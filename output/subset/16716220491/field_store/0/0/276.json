Those who desire to study further the mystical and spiritual meanings will find much helpful suggestion in such books as The Argument and Mystery of Parsifal, by Charles T. Gatty, F.S.A. (London); A Study of Parsifal, by Alfred Gurney, M.A. (London); Parsifal,--the Finding of Christ through Art, by A.R. Parsons (New York); or My Musical Memories, by Rev. H.R. Haweis (chapter on \"Parsifal\").  It may be some time before the real Parsifal as given at Bayreuth is fully appreciated by the English-speaking public, although shortly the special conditions which have hitherto reserved its production to Bayreuth alone will be released, and the great drama will be heard in other musical centres. This version is intended to be a vivid reminder of the drama to those who have seen it at Bayreuth, and also to give to those who have not seen it a fuller glimpse of the majestic story than has hitherto been possible to find in English. The genius of Wagner as a musician has so far overshadowed all else, that his genius as a poet and as an exquisite reteller of the old legends has not been fully appreciated.  Galahad, as Tennyson portrays him, will always hold the first place with English readers as the ideal knight of the Holy Grail. The matchless diction of Tennyson has given the less perfect form of the legend a supreme charm and beauty. But Wolfram von Eschenbach's Parsifal, as spiritualized and humanized in Wagner's lyric drama, will be seen to be in fuller accord with the whole cycle and development of the Grail legends, and at the same time gives the nobler story. It is a consummate parable of the contending passions and the heavenly aspiration, the ineffable pity and the mystic glory, of the human heart. It portrays an intensely human and heroic life, imaginatively identified with that of the very Christ.  \"However mediaeval the language and symbolism of Parsifal may be,\" says a modern critic, \"one cannot but acknowledge the simplicity and power of the story. Its spiritual significance is universal. Whatever more it may mean, we see clearly that the guileless knight is Purity, Kundry is the Wickedness of the world expressed in its most enticing form, and King Amfortas suffering with his open wound is Humanity. One cannot read the drama without a thrill, without a clutching at the heart, at its marvellous meaning, its uplifting and ennobling lessons.\"  O.H.  Baltimore, Maryland, January 7th, 1903.     PARSIFAL. PART I    THE COMING OF PARSIFAL   Within a noble stretch of mountain woods, Primeval forest, deep and dark and grand, There rose a glorious castle towering high,-- And at its foot a smiling, shimmering lake Lay in the still lap of a verdant glade. 'T was daybreak, and the arrows of the dawn Were shot in golden glory through the trees, And from the castle came a trumpet blast To waken life in all the slumbering host,-- Warriors and yeomen in the castle halls.  And at the trumpet Gurnemanz rose up,-- Ancient and faithful servant of the Grail,-- Who sleeping lay under a spreading oak, And called aloud to two youths sleeping yet: \"Hey! ho! ye foresters, loving the woods, Loving your sleep as well. Wake with the day! Hear ye the trumpet! Come, let us thank God That we have power to hear the call of life, And power to answer as the duty calls!\" And up they started, knelt in prayer with him, And offered unto God their morning praise.  Then Gurnemanz: \"Up now, my gallant youths, Prepare the royal bath, and wait the King!... Behold, his litter now is coming forth, I see the heralds coming on before.... Hail, royal heralds! Hail and welcome both! How fares my Lord Amfortas' health to-day? I hope his early coming to the bath Doth presage nothing worse. I fain had thought The healing herb that Sir Gawain had found With wisest skill and bravest deed might bring Some quick and sure relief unto the King.\"  To whom the herald-knight did make reply: \"Thou knowest all of this dread secret wound,-- The shame, the sorrow, and the depth of it, Its evil cause and the dark curse upon it,-- And yet forsooth thou seemest still to hope?... The healing herb no soothing brought, nor peace. All night the sleepless King has tossed in pain, Longing for morning and the cooling bath.\"  Then Gurnemanz, downcast and saddened, said: \"Yea, it is useless, hoping thus to ease The pain unless we use the one sure cure,-- Naught else avails although we search the world. Only one healer and one healing thing Can staunch the gaping wound and save the King.\"  And eagerly the herald asked: \"What cure is this, And who the healer that can save the King?\"  But Gurnemanz quick answered: \"See the bath Is needing thee, for here doth come the King!\"  But as he spake, e'er yet the King appeared, Another herald, looking far away, Beheld a woman coming, riding wild, And quick exclaimed: \"See there, a flying witch! Ha! how the devil's mare is racing fast With madly flying mane! Nearer she comes!... 'Tis Kundry, wretched Kundry, mad old Kundry-- Perhaps she brings us urgent news? Who knows? The mare is staggering with weariness,-- No wonder, for its flight was through the air,-- But now it nears the ground, and seems to brush The moss with sweeping mane. And now, look ye! The wild witch flings herself from off the mare And rushes toward us!\"                          And Kundry came, Her dark eyes flashing wildly, piercing bright; Her black hair loose; her rude garb looser still, Yet partly bound with glittering skins of snakes; And panting, staggering ran to Gurnemanz, And thrust into his hands a crystal flask With the scant whisper, \"Balsam--for the King!\" And on his asking, \"Whence this healing balm?\" She answered: \"Farther than thy thought can guess. For if this balsam fail, then Araby Hath nothing further for the King's relief. Ask me no further. I am weak and worn.\"  And now the litter of the King drew near, Attended by a retinue of knights. High on the couch the King Amfortas lay, His pale face lined with suffering and care; And looking toward the King, then Gurnemanz Spake with his own sad heart: \"He comes, my King,-- A helpless burden to his servitors. Alas, alas! That these mine eyes should see The sovereign of a strong and noble race, Now in the very flower and prime of life, Brought low, and made a bounden slave Unto a shameful and a stubborn sickness!... Ye servitors, be careful of this couch! Careful! Set down the litter tenderly! I hear the King, our Master, groan in pain.\"  Then they set down the couch, and soon the King, Raising himself a little, spake to them: \"My loving thanks, sir knights. Rest here awhile. How sweet this morning and these fragrant woods To one who tossed the weary night in pain. And this pure lake with all its freshening waves Will lighten pain and brighten my dark woe. Where is my dear Gawain?\"                            And one spake up: \"My Lord Gawain has hasted quick away. For when the healing herb that he had brought After such daring toils, did disappoint, Then he set forth upon another quest.\"  Then said the King: \"Without our word? Alas that he should go on useless quests And seem to do despite unto the Grail! For it is ordered by divine command That I should suffer for my grievous sin, And naught can help me but one single thing. O woe, if in his far-off quests for me He is ensnared by Klingsor's hateful arts! I pray you, sirs, venture no more for me,-- It only breaks my peace, and grieves my heart. Naught will avail. I only wait for Him,-- '_By pity 'lightened._' Was not this the word?\"  And Gurnemanz: \"So thou hast said to us.\"  And softly yet spake on the suffering King: \"'_The guileless One._' Methinks I know him now! His name is Death, for only Death can free me!\"  Then Gurnemanz to ease the King's sad thoughts Held forth the crystal flask with soothing words: \"Nay, nay, my King. Essay once more a cure,-- A balsam brought for thee from Araby.\"  And the King asked: \"Whence came this balsam flask, So strange in form, and who has brought it here?\"  And Gurnemanz: \"There lies the woman now! The wild-eyed Kundry, weak and weary-worn, As if the journey sapped her very life.... Up, Kundry! Here's his majesty the King!\"  But Kundry would not rise, or could not else.  Then spake the King: \"O Kundry, restless, strange, Am I again thy debtor for such help? Yet I will try thy balsam for my wound, And for thy service take my grateful thanks.\"  But Kundry muttered: \"Give no thanks to me. What will it help,--or this, or e'en the bath? And yet, away, I say! On to the bath!\" Then the King left her, lying on the ground, And off he moved upon the couch of pain, Longing to bathe him in the shining lake, Hoping against all hope to ease his soul, And quiet in his body the fierce pains.  And one spake up: \"Why lies that woman there,-- A foul and snarling thing on holy ground? Methinks her healing balm is witching drug To work a further poison in the King.... She hates us! See her now! How hellishly She looks at us with hot and spiteful eyes! She is a heathen witch and sorceress!\"  But Gurnemanz, who knew her well, replied: \"What harm has ever come to you from her? And oft she serves us in the kindliest ways. For when we want a messenger to send To distant lands where warrior-knights in fight Are serving God, she quick takes up the task; Before you scarcely know is gone and back. A marvel is her wondrous speed of flight. Nor does she ask your help at any time, Nor tire you with her presence, nor her words. But in the hour of danger, she is near,-- Inspiring by her brave and fiery zeal, Nor asking of you all one word of thanks. Methinks a curse may still be on her life,-- She is so wild and strange, so sad her very eyes. But now, whate'er the past, she is with us, And"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11633"],["title","Parsifal (#2)"],["body","us to atone for earlier guilt. Perchance her work may shrive her of her sins. Surely she does full well to serve us well, And in the serving-help herself and us.\"  Then spake again a knight: \"Perchance her guilt It was, that brought calamity on all our land.\"  But Gurnemanz: \"My thought of her goes far In memory to days and years long past. And it was always when she was away And we alone, that sudden mishap fell. This I have seen through many, many years. The agèd King, our Titurel beloved, He knew her well for many years beyond. 'Twas he who found her sleeping in these woods, All stiff and rigid, pale and seeming dead, When he was building yonder castle-towers. And so did I myself, in recent days, Find her asleep and rigid in the woods,-- 'Twas when calamity on us had come So evil and so shameful from our foe,-- That dread magician of the mountain heights. Say, Kundry, wake and answer me this word? Where hadst thou been in those dark evil days,-- At home, afar, awake or fast asleep,-- When our good King did lose the holy Spear? Why were you not at hand to give us help?\"  And Kundry muttered: \"Never do I help!\" Then said a knight: \"O brother Gurnemanz, If she is now so true in serving us, And if she does such strange and wondrous deeds, Then send her for the missing holy Spear For which the King and all the land are fain.\"  But Gurnemanz with gloomy looks replied: \"That were a quest beyond her, beyond all-- That lies within the guarded will of God. O how my heart leaps up in memory Of that blest symbol of the Saviour's power! O wounding, healing, wonder-working Spear, Companion of the Grail in grace divine, A radiant shaft for consecrated hands. What saw I? Hands unholy snatched thee up, And sought to wield thee in unholy ways. I see it all again,--that dark and fatal day When our good King Amfortas, all too bold, Forgetful of the evil in the world, Went straying far out from the castle walls, And loitered through the green and shady woods; And there he met a woman passing fair, With great eyes that bewitched him with their light, And as he stayed and lost his heart to her, He lost the Spear. For on a sudden came Athwart them that foul-hearted, fallen knight, The evil-minded Klingsor, and he snatched The holy Spear and mocking rushed away. Then broke an awful cry from the King's lips; I heard and hurrying fought the evil knight, As did the King, parrying blow on blow, And at the last the King fell wounded sore By that same Spear that once was holy health. This is the fatal wound that burns his side,-- This wound it is that ne'er will close again.\"  And when the knights asked further of the deed And what of Klingsor, the foul-hearted knight, Then Gurnemanz sat down and told this tale,-- The four young knights ensconced around his feet,-- \"Our holy Titurel knew Klingsor well. For in the ancient days when savage foes Distressed the kingdom with their heathen craft, One mystic midnight came a messenger Of God to Titurel, and gave to him The Holy Grail, the vessel lustrous pure, Wherein the crimson wine blushed rosy-red At that Last Supper of the feast of love; Wherein the later wine of His own blood Was caught and cherished from the cruel Cross. This gave the angel unto holy Titurel And with it gave the radiant sacred Spear That pierced the side and broke the suffering heart Of Him, our heavenly Saviour on the Cross, So that the water and the blood flowed forth In mingled tide,--the sacrifice of love. And for these precious witnesses of God That told to men of saving-health and power, The holy Titurel did build an holy house,-- A sanctuary-stronghold on the heights Of Monsalvat, forever given to God. And ye, blest servants of the Holy Grail, Ye know the sacred ways by which ye came Into this holy service. Ye gave all And purified your lives and hearts to God. And with the consecration came the power, By vision of the Grail, to do high deeds And live the life of warriors of God. This Klingsor came to holy Titurel And asked to come into the company. Long had he lived in yonder heathen vale Alone, and shunned by all his kind. I never knew what sin had stained his heart, Or why he sought the castle of the Grail; But holy Titurel discerned his heart And saw the festering evil of his life, And knew unholy purpose filled his soul And steadfastly refused him at the gates. Whereat in wrath the evil Klingsor swore That if he could not serve the Holy Grail, The Holy Grail should serve him by its power; And he would seize it in his own right hand, And some day be the master of them all. Henceforth he waged a subtle, ceaseless war Against Monsalvat and the holy knights. He gave himself to dark and evil life And learned the witchery of magic arts To work the ruin of the Holy Grail. Fair gardens he created by his art, Through all the deserts, and therein he placed Maidens of winsome witchery and power, Who bloomed like flowers in beauty and in grace. And in these subtle snares full many a knight Was caught by magic wiles and lured and lost, And no one knew where they had gone or why. Then holy Titurel, grown old in years, Gave up the kingdom to his only son, The brave Amfortas. And by ceaseless quest Amfortas learned the truth and waged fierce war Against this Klingsor, evil to the heart, Until at last in one unguarded moment, As I have told you, e'en our noble King, The good Amfortas, yielded to a sin,-- And lost the Spear, and had his fatal wound. Now with the Spear within his evil grasp Klingsor exults, and mockingly does tell How his black fingers soon will hold the Grail.\"  [Illustration]  Then the young knights who listened to the tale Upstarted with the cry: \"God give us grace To wrest that sacred Spear from impious hands!\"  But Gurnemanz thus checked them: \"Listen yet! Long did our King Amfortas kneel before The sanctuary, praying in his pain And seeking for a word of hope from God. At length a radiance glowed around the Grail, And from its glory shone a Sacred Face That spake this oracle of mystic words:    _\"By pity 'lightened,        My guileless One,--      Wait for him,        Till My will is done!\"_  And as the knights repeated these weird words,-- There came wild cries and shouting from the lake: \"Shame! shame! alas, the shame to shoot the swan!\" And as they looked, a wild swan came in sight; It floated feebly o'er the flurried lake And strove to fly, but wounded fluttered down And sank upon the lake-shore, and was dead. And Gurnemanz cried out: \"Who shot the swan? The King had hailed it as a happy sign, Whene'er a swan came near him in its flight For since the earliest ages has this bird Meant hope and health and holiness to men.-- Who dared to do this dastard deed of shame?\"  Then came a knight leading a guileless boy And said: \"This is the one who shot the swan,-- And here more arrows like the cruel shaft That hides itself within the bleeding breast.\"  To whom spake Gurnemanz: \"What mean'st thou, boy, By such a cruel, shameless deed as this?\"  But the boy answered: \"Yea, it was my shot. I shot the swan in flight when high in air.\"  Then Gurnemanz: \"Shame to confess such deed! Such sacrilege within these holy woods, Where seems to dwell the perfect peace of God. Were not the woodland creatures kind to thee,-- Did not the sweet birds sing their songs to thee, When first thou camest to these leafy haunts? And this poor swan, so mild and beautiful,--- How could thy heart determine on such deed? It hovered o'er the lake in circling grace, Seeking the dear companion of its love,-- For e'en the heart of bird doth know sweet love,-- And seeming to make sacred all the lake. Didst thou not marvel at its queenly flight, And feel a reverence in thine inmost soul? What tempted thee to shoot the fatal shaft, And slay the bird and grieve the loving King?... See where the deadly arrow smote its breast! Behold the snowy plumage splashed with blood! The spreading pinions drooping helpless now, And in its eye the agony of death! Slain by thy cruel heart that knows no shame! Dost thou not see how wicked is thy deed?\"  Then was the young boy stricken with remorse, And drew his hand across his moistened eyes, As if new pity dawned within his soul; Then quickly snatching up his strong arched bow, He broke it, and his arrows flung away. And clutching at his breast as if in pain He stood a time in conscious agony,-- Deep feeling surging through his stricken heart; And then he turned again to Gurnemanz With the brave words: \"I did not understand What evil I was doing with my bow.\"  \"Whence art thou?\" Gurnemanz did ask of him; And dazed he answered: \"That I do not know.\" \"But who thy father?\"--\"That I do not know.\" \"Who sent thee here?\"--\"I do not know e'en that.\" Then Gurnemanz: \"Yet tell me but thy name.\"  And in a strange and dazed way he replied: \"Once I had many. Now, I do not know.\" And Gurnemanz spake sharply, half in wrath, \"Thou knowest nothing. Such a guileless soul,-- So wisely foolish, and so foolish wise,-- A very child in heart, yet strangely strong, Ne'er have I found, except in Kundry here.... Come, brother-knights, lift up the stricken swan And bear it on these branches to the lake; Nor speak of this sad sorrow to the King To further grieve his deep-afflicted heart Stricken the King and wounded to his death, This omen he may dwell on to his hurt.\"  And back unto the King's bath went the knights, While Gurnemanz spake further to the lad: \"Speak out thy heart to me. I am thy friend. Surely thou knowest much that thou canst say.\"  Then spake the boy and told him of his life: \"I have a mother,--Heartsrue is she called. And on the barren moorland is our home. My bow and arrows have I made myself To scare the eagles in the forest wilds.\"  Then Gurnemanz: \"Yea, thou hast told me true, For thou thyself art of the eagle brood. I see a something kingly in thy look. Yet better had thy mother taught thy hands To spear and sword than this unmanly bow.\"  Whereat the wild witch Kundry raised herself From where she lay along"]]]
