But the tall one--never.  He was a Bedouin, if ever a son of the desert breathed.  If he had visited the States, then he had come back as unchanged as gold out of an acid bath;  and as for being born there--  \"That little beady-eyed, rat-faced fellow may be an American,\" I said.  \"In fact, of course he is, since you say so.  But as for being up to any good--\"  \"You're mistaken.  You're looking at the wrong man.  Observe the other one.\"  I was more than ever sure I was not mistaken.  Stately gesture, dignity, complexion, attitude--to say nothing of his Bedouin array and the steadiness with which he kept his dark eyes fixed on the smaller man he was talking to, had laid the stamp of the desert on the taller man from head to heel.  \"That tall man is an American officer in the British army. Doesn't look the part, eh?  They say he was the first American to be granted a commission without any pretense of his being a Canadian.  They accepted him as an American.  It was a case of that or nothing.  Lived here for years, and knew the country so well that they felt they had to have him on his own terms.\"   You can believe anything in Jerusalem after you have been in the place a week or two, so, seeing who my informant was, I swallowed the fact.  But it was a marvel.  It seemed even greater when the man strolled out, pausing to salute my host with the solemn politeness that warfare with the desert breeds.  You could not imagine that at Ellis Island, or on Broadway--even on the stage. It was too untheatrical to be acting;  too individual to be imitation;  to unself-conscious to have been acquired.  I hazarded a guess.  \"A red man, then.  Carlisle for education.  Swallowed again by the first desert he stayed in for more than a week.\"  \"Wrong.  His name is Grim.  Sounds like Scandinavian ancestry, on one side.  James Schuyler Grim--Dutch, then, on the other;  and some English.  Ten generations in the States at any rate.  He can tell you all about this country.  Why not call on him?\"  It did not need much intelligence to agree to that suggestion; but the British military take their code with them to the uttermost ends of earth, behind which they wonder why so many folks with different codes, or none, dislike them.  \"Write me an introduction,\" I said.  \"You won't need one.  Just call on him.  He lives at a place they call the junior Staff Officers' Mess--up beyond the Russian Convent and below the Zionist Hospital.\"  So I went that evening, finding the way with difficulty because they talk at least eighteen languages in Jerusalem and, with the exception of official residences, no names were posted anywhere. That was not an official residence.  It was a sort of communal boarding-house improvised by a dozen or so officers in preference to the bug-laden inconvenience of tents--in a German-owned (therefore enemy property) stone house at the end of an alley, in a garden full of blooming pomegranates.  I sent my card in by a flat-footed old Russian female, who ran down passages and round corners like a wet hen, trying to find a man-servant.  The place seemed deserted, but presently she came on her quarry in the back yard, and a very small boy in a tarboosh and knickerbockers carried the card on a tray into a room on the left.  Through the open door I could hear one quiet question and a high-pitched disclaimer of all knowledge;  then an order, sounding like a grumble, and the small boy returned to the hall to invite me in, in reasonably good English, of which he seemed prouder than I of my Arabic.  So I went into the room on the left, with that Bedouin still in mind.  There was only one man in there, who got out of a deep armchair as I entered, marking his place in a book with a Damascus dagger.  He did not look much more than middle height, nor more than medium dark complexioned, and he wore a major's khaki uniform.  \"Beg pardon,\" I said.  \"I've disturbed the wrong man.  I came to call on an American named Major Grim.\"  \"I'm Grim.\"  \"Must be a mistake, though.  The man I'm looking for is taller than you--very dark--looks, walks, speaks and acts like a Bedouin.  I saw him this afternoon in Bedouin costume in the American Colony store.\"  \"Yes, I noticed you.  Sit down, won't you?  Yes, I'm he--the Bedouin abayi* seems to add to a man's height.  Soap and water account for the rest of it.  These cigars are from the States.\" [*Long-sleeved outer cloak.]  It was hard to believe, even on the strength of his straight statement--he talking undisguised American, and smiling at me, no doubt vastly pleased with my incredulity.  \"Are you a case of Jekyll and Hyde?\" I asked.  \"No.  I'm more like both sides of a sandwich with some army mule- meat in the middle.  But I won't be interviewed.  I hate it. Besides, it's against the regulations.\"  His voice was not quite so harshly nasal as those of the Middle West, but he had not picked up the ultra-English drawl and clipped-off consonants that so many Americans affect abroad and overdo.  I don't think a wise crook would have chosen him as a subject for experiments.  He had dark eyes with noticeably long lashes; heavy eyebrows;  what the army examination-sheets describe as a medium chin;  rather large hands with long, straight fingers; and feet such as an athlete stands on, fully big for his size, but well shaped.  He was young for a major--somewhere between thirty and thirty-five.  Once he was satisfied that I would not write him up for the newspapers he showed no disinclination to talk, although it was difficult to keep him on the subject of himself, and easy to let him lose you in a maze of tribal history.  He seemed to know the ins and outs of every blood-feud from Beersheba to Damascus, and warmed to his subject as you listened.  \"You see,\" he said, by way of apology when I laughed at a string of names that to me conjured up only confusion, \"my beat is all the way from Cairo to Aleppo--both sides of the Jordan.  I'm not on the regular strength, but attached to the Intelligence--no, not permanent--don't know what the future has in store--that probably depends on whether or not the Zionists get full control, and how soon.  Meanwhile, I'm my own boss more or less--report direct to the Administrator, and he's one of those men who allows you lots of scope.\"  That was the sort of occasional glimpse he gave of himself, and then switched off into straight statements about the Zionist problem.  All his statements were unqualified, and given with the air of knowing all about it right from the beginning.  \"There's nothing here that really matters outside the Zionist- Arab problem.  But that's a big one.  People don't realize it-- even on the spot--but it's a world movement with ramifications everywhere.  All the other politics of the Near East hinge on it, even when it doesn't appear so on the surface.  You see, the Jews have international affiliations through banks and commerce.  They have blood-relations everywhere.  A ripple here may mean there's a wave in Russia, or London, or New York.  I've known at least one Arab blood-feud over here that began with a quarrel between a Jew and a Christian in Chicago.\"  \"Are the Zionists as dangerous as the Arabs seem to think?\" I asked.  \"Yes and no.  Depends what you call danger.  They're like an incoming tide.  All you can do is accept the fact and ride on top of it, move away in front of it, or go under.  The Arabs want to push it back with sword-blades.  Can't be done!\"  \"Speaking as a mere onlooker, I feel sorry for the Arabs,\" I said.  \"It has been their country for several hundred years. They didn't even drive the Jews out of it;  the Romans attended to that, after the Assyrians and Babylonians had cleaned up nine-tenths of the population.  And at that, the Jews were invaders themselves.\"  \"Sure,\" Grim answered.  \"But you can't argue with tides.  The Arabs are sore, and nobody has any right to blame them.  The English betrayed the Arabs--I don't mean the fellows out here, but the gang at the Foreign Office.\"  I glanced at his uniform.  That was a strange statement coming from a man who wore it.  He understood, and laughed.  \"Oh, the men out here all admit it.  They're as sore as the Arabs are themselves.\"  \"Then you're on the wrong side, and you know it?\" I suggested.  \"The meat,\" he said, \"is in the middle of the sandwich.  In a small way you might say I'm a doctor, staying on after a riot to stitch up cuts.  The quarrel was none of my making, although I was in it and did what I could to help against the Turks.  Like everybody else who knows them, I admire the Turks and hate what they stand for--hate their cruelty.  I was with Lawrence across the Jordan--went all the way to Damascus with him--saw the war through to a finish--in case you choose to call it finished.\"  Vainly I tried to pin him down to personal reminiscences.  He was not interested in his own story.  \"The British promised old King Hussein of Mecca that if he'd raise an Arab army to use against the Turks, there should be a united Arab kingdom afterward under a ruler of their own choosing.  The kingdom was to include Syria, Arabia and Palestine.  The French agreed.  Well, the Arabs raised the army; Emir Feisul, King Hussein's third son, commanded it;  Lawrence did so well that he became a legend.  The result was, Allenby could concentrate his army on this side of the Jordan and clean up.  He made a good job of it.  The Arabs were naturally cock-a-hoop.\"  I suggested that the Arabs with that great army could have enforced the contract, but he laughed again.  \"They were being paid in gold by the British, and had Lawrence to hold them together.  The flow of gold stopped, and Lawrence was sent home.  Somebody at the Foreign Office had changed his mind. You see, they were all taken by surprise at the speed of Allenby's campaign.  The Zionists saw their chance, and claimed Palestine.  No doubt they had"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11357"],["title","Jimgrim and Allah's Peace (#2)"],["body","and influence.  Perhaps it was Jewish gold that had paid the wages of the Arab army. Anyhow, the French laid claim to Syria.  By the time the war was over the Zionists had a hard-and-fast guarantee, the French claim to Syria had been admitted, and there wasn't any country left except some Arabian desert to let the Arabs have.  That's the situation.  Feisul is in Damascus, going through the farce of being proclaimed king, with the French holding the sea-ports and getting ready to oust him.  The Zionists are in Jerusalem, working like beavers, and the British are getting ready to pull out as much as possible and leave the Zionists to do their own worrying.  Mesopotamia is in a state of more or less anarchy. Egypt is like a hot-box full of explosive--may go off any minute. The Arabs would like to challenge the world to mortal combat, and then fight one another while the rest of the world pays the bill--\"  \"And you?\"  \"The French, for instance.  Their army is weak at the moment. They've neither men nor money--only a hunger to own Syria.  They don't play what the English call 'on side.'  They play a mean game.  The French General Staff figure that if Feisul should attack them now he might beat them.  So they've conceived the brilliant idea of spreading sedition and every kind of political discontent into Palestine and across the Jordan, so that if the Arabs make an effort they'll make it simultaneously in both countries.  Then the British, being in the same mess with the French, would have to take the French side and make a joint campaign of it.\"  \"But don't the British know this?\"  \"You bet they know it.  What's the Intelligence for?  The French are hiring all the Arab newspapers to preach against the British. A child could see it with his eyes shut.\"  \"Then why in thunder don't the British have a showdown?\"  \"That's where the joker comes in.  The French know there's a sort of diplomatic credo at the London Foreign Office to the general effect that England and France have got to stand together or Europe will go to pieces.  The French are realists.  They bank on that.  They tread on British corns, out here, all they want to, while they toss bouquets, backed by airplanes, across the English Channel.\"  \"Then the war didn't end the old diplomacy?\"  \"What a question!  But I haven't more than scratched the Near East surface for you yet.  There's Mustapha Kemal in Anatolia, leader of the Turkish Nationalists, no more dead or incapacitated than a possum.  He's playing for his own hand--Kaiser Willy stuff--studying Trotzky and Lenin, and flirting with Feisul's party on the side.  Then there's a Bolshevist element among the Zionists--got teeth, too.  There's an effort being made from India to intrigue among the Sikh troops employed in Palestine. There's a very strong party yelling for an American mandate.  The Armenians, poor devils, are pulling any string they can get hold of, in the hope that anything at all may happen.  The orthodox Jews are against the Zionists;  the Arabs are against them both, and furious with one another.  There's a pan-Islam movement on foot, and a pan-Turanian--both different, and opposed.  About 75 per cent of the British are as pro-Arab as they dare be, but the rest are strong for the Zionists.  And the Administrator's neutral!--strong for law and order but taking no sides.\"  \"And you?\"  \"I'm one of the men who is trying to keep the peace.\"  He invited me to stay to dinner.  The other members of the mess were trooping in, all his juniors, all obviously fond of him and boisterously irreverent of his rank.  Dinner under his chairmanship was a sort of school for repartee.  It was utterly unlike the usual British mess dinner.  If you shut your eyes for a minute you couldn't believe that any one present had ever worn a uniform.  I learned afterward that there was quite a little competition to get into that mess.  After dinner most of them trooped out again, to dance with Zionist ladies at an institute affair.  But he and I stayed, and talked until midnight.  Before I left, the key of Palestine and Syria was in my hands.  \"You seem interested,\" he said, coming with me to the door.  \"If you don't mind rough spots now and then, I'll try to show you a few things at first hand.\"      Chapter Two  \"No objection;  only a stipulation.\"   The showmanship began much sooner than I hoped.  The following day was Sunday, and I had an invitation to a sort of semi-public tea given by the American Colony after their afternoon religious service.  They received their guests in a huge, well-furnished room on the upper floor of a stone house built around a courtyard filled with flowers.  I think they were a little proud of the number of fierce-looking Arabs, who had traveled long distances in order to be present.  Ten Arab chieftains in full costume, with fifteen or twenty of their followers, all there at great expense of trouble, time and money, for friends sake, were, after all, something to feel a bit chesty about.  Every member of the Colony seemed able to talk Arabic like a native and, as they used to say in the up- state papers, a good time was being had by all.  The Near East adores ice-cream, and there was lots of it.  Two of the Arab chiefs were Christians;  the rest were not.  The peace and war record of the Colony was what had brought them all there.  Hardly an Arab in the country was not the Colony's debtor for disinterested help, direct or indirect, at some time in some way.  The American Colony was the one place in the country where a man of any creed could go and be sure that whatever he might say would not be used against him.  So they were talking their heads off.  Hot air and Arab politics have quite a lot in common. But there was a broad desert-breath about it all.  It wasn't like the little gusty yaps you hear in the city coffee-shops.  A lot of the talk was foolish, but it was all magnificent.  There was one sheikh named Mustapha ben Nasir dressed in a blue serge suit and patent-leather boots, with nothing to show his nationality except a striped silk head-dress with the camel-hair band around the forehead.  He was a handsome fellow, with a black beard trimmed to a point, and perfect manners, polished no doubt in a dozen countries, but still Eastern in slow, deferential dignity.  He could talk good French.  I fell in conversation with him.  The frankness with which treason is mooted, admitted and discussed in the Near East is one of the first things that amaze you.  They are so open about it that nobody takes them seriously. Apparently it is only when they don't talk treason openly that the ruling authorities get curious and make arrests.  To me, a total stranger, with nothing to recommend me but that for an hour or two that afternoon I was a guest of the American Colony, Mustapha ben Nasir made no bones whatever about the fact that the was being paid by the French to stir up feeling over Jordan against the British.  \"I receive a monthly salary,\" he boasted.  \"I am just from Damascus, where the French Liaison-officer paid me and gave me some instructions.\"  \"Where is your home?\" I asked him.  \"At El-Kerak, in the mountains of Moab, across the Dead Sea.  I start this evening.  Will you come with me?\"  \"Je m'en bien garderai!\"  He smiled.  \"Myself, I am in favor of the British.  The French pay my expenses, that is all.  What we all want is an independent Arab government--some say kingdom, some say republic.  If it is not time for that yet, then we would choose an American mandate. But America has deserted us.  Failing America, we prefer the English for the present.  Anything except France!  We do not want to become a new Algeria.\"  \"What is the condition now at El-Kerak?\"  \"Condition?  There is none.  There is chaos.  You see, the British say their authority ceases at the River Jordan and at a line drawn down the middle of the Dead Sea.  That leaves us with a choice between two other governments--King Hussein's government of Mecca, and Feisul's in Syria.  But Hussein's arm is not long enough to reach us from the South, and Feisul's is not nearly strong enough to interfere from the North.  So there is no government, and each man is keeping the peace with his own sword.\"  \"You mean;  each man on his own account?\"  \"Yes.  So there is peace.  Five--fifteen--thirty throats are cut daily;  and if you go down to the Jordan and listen, you will hear the shots being fired from ambush any day.\"  \"And you invite me to make the trip with you?\"  \"Oh, that is nothing.  In the first place, you are American. Nobody will interfere with an American.  They are welcome.  In the second place, there is a good reason for bringing you;  we all want an American school at El-Kerak.\"  \"But I am no teacher.\"  \"But you will be returning to America?  It is enough, then, that you look the situation over, and tell what you know on your return.  We will provide a building, a proper salary, and guarantee the teacher's life.  We would prefer a woman, but it would be wisest to send a man.\"  \"How so?  The woman might not shoot straight?  I've some of our Western women do tricks with a gun that would--\"  \"There would be no need.  She would have our word of honour.  But every sheikh who has only three wives would want to make her his fourth.  A man would be best.  Will you come with me?\"  \"On your single undertaking to protect me?  Are you king of all that countryside?\"  \"If you will come, you shall have an escort, every man of whom will die before he would let you be killed.  And if they, and you, should all be killed, their sons and grandsons would avenge you to the third generation of your murderers.\"  \"That's undoubtedly handsome, but--\"  \"Believe me, effendi,\" he urged, \"many a soul has been consoled in hell-fire by the knowledge that his adversaries would be cut off in their prime by friends who are true to their given word.\"  Meaning to back out politely, I assured him I would think the offer over.  \"Well and good,\" he answered."]]]
