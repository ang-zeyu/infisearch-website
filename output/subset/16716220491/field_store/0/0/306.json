And Jane is crying her heart out upstairs.\"  There followed a period of silence. Jane, as I have said, stopped singing about the house, and began to care for our brittle possessions, which struck my wife as being a very sad sign indeed. The next Sunday, and the next, Jane asked to go out, \"to walk with William,\" and my wife, who never attempts to extort confidences, gave her permission, and asked no questions. On each occasion Jane came back looking flushed and very determined. At last one day she became communicative.  \"William is being led away,\" she remarked abruptly, with a catching of the breath, apropos of tablecloths. \"Yes, m'm. She is a milliner, and she can play on the piano.\"  \"I thought,\" said my wife, \"that you went out with him on Sunday.\"  \"Not out with him, m'm--after him. I walked along by the side of them, and told her he was engaged to me.\"  \"Dear me, Jane, did you? What did they do?\"  \"Took no more notice of me than if I was dirt. So I told her she should suffer for it.\"  \"It could not have been a very agreeable walk, Jane.\"  \"Not for no parties, ma'am.\"  \"I wish,\" said Jane, \"I could play the piano, ma'am. But anyhow, I don't mean to let _her_ get him away from me. She's older than him, and her hair ain't gold to the roots, ma'am.\"  It was on the August Bank Holiday that the crisis came. We do not clearly know the details of the fray, but only such fragments as poor Jane let fall. She came home dusty, excited, and with her heart hot within her.  The milliner's mother, the milliner, and William had made a party to the Art Museum at South Kensington, I think. Anyhow, Jane had calmly but firmly accosted them somewhere in the streets, and asserted her right to what, in spite of the consensus of literature, she held to be her inalienable property. She did, I think, go so far as to lay hands on him. They dealt with her in a crushingly superior way. They \"called a cab.\" There was a \"scene,\" William being pulled away into the four-wheeler by his future wife and mother-in-law from the reluctant hands of our discarded Jane. There were threats of giving her \"in charge.\"  \"My poor Jane!\" said my wife, mincing veal as though she was mincing William. \"It's a shame of them. I would think no more of him. He is not worthy of you.\"  \"No, m'm,\" said Jane. \"He _is_ weak.  \"But it's that woman has done it,\" said Jane. She was never known to bring herself to pronounce \"that woman's\" name or to admit her girlishness. \"I can't think what minds some women must have--to try and get a girl's young man away from her. But there, it only hurts to talk about it,\" said Jane.  Thereafter our house rested from William. But there was something in the manner of Jane's scrubbing the front doorstep or sweeping out the rooms, a certain viciousness, that persuaded me that the story had not yet ended.  \"Please, m'm, may I go and see a wedding tomorrow?\" said Jane one day.  My wife knew by instinct whose wedding. \"Do you think it is wise, Jane?\" she said.  \"I would like to see the last of him,\" said Jane.  \"My dear,\" said my wife, fluttering into my room about twenty minutes after Jane had started, \"Jane has been to the boot-hole and taken all the left-off boots and shoes, and gone off to the wedding with them in a bag. Surely she cannot mean--\"  \"Jane,\" I said, \"is developing character. Let us hope for the best.\"  Jane came back with a pale, hard face. All the boots seemed to be still in her bag, at which my wife heaved a premature sigh of relief. We heard her go upstairs and replace the boots with considerable emphasis.  \"Quite a crowd at the wedding, ma'am,\" she said presently, in a purely conversational style, sitting in our little kitchen, and scrubbing the potatoes; \"and such a lovely day for them.\" She proceeded to numerous other details, clearly avoiding some cardinal incident.  \"It was all extremely respectable and nice, ma'am; but _her_ father didn't wear a black coat, and looked quite out of place, ma'am. Mr. Piddingquirk--\"  \"_Who_?\"  \"Mr. Piddingquirk--William that was, ma'am--had white gloves, and a coat like a clergyman, and a lovely chrysanthemum. He looked so nice, ma'am. And there was red carpet down, just like for gentlefolks. And they say he gave the clerk four shillings, ma'am. It was a real kerridge they had--not a fly. When they came out of church there was rice-throwing, and her two little sisters dropping dead flowers. And someone threw a slipper, and then I threw a boot--\"  \"Threw a _boot_, Jane!\"  \"Yes, ma'am. Aimed at her. But it hit _him_. Yes, ma'am, hard. Gev him a black eye, I should think. I only threw that one. I hadn't the heart to try again. All the little boys cheered when it hit him.\"  After an interval--\"I am sorry the boot hit _him_.\"  Another pause. The potatoes were being scrubbed violently. \"He always _was_ a bit above me, you know, ma'am. And he was led away.\"  The potatoes were more than finished. Jane rose sharply with a sigh, and rapped the basin down on the table.  \"I don't care,\" she said. \"I don't care a rap. He will find out his mistake yet. It serves me right. I was stuck up about him. I ought not to have looked so high. And I am glad things are as things are.\"  My wife was in the kitchen, seeing to the higher cookery. After the confession of the boot-throwing, she must have watched poor Jane fuming with a certain dismay in those brown eyes of hers. But I imagine they softened again very quickly, and then Jane's must have met them.  \"Oh, ma'am,\" said Jane, with an astonishing change of note, \"think of all that _might_ have been! Oh, ma'am, I _could_ have been so happy! I ought to have known, but I didn't know...You're very kind to let me talk to you, ma'am...for it's hard on me, ma'am...it's har-r-r-r-d--\"  And I gather that Euphemia so far forgot herself as to let Jane sob out some of the fullness of her heart on a sympathetic shoulder. My Euphemia, thank Heaven, has never properly grasped the importance of \"keeping up her position.\" And since that fit of weeping, much of the accent of bitterness has gone out of Jane's scrubbing and brush work.  Indeed, something passed the other day with the butcher-boy--but that scarcely belongs to this story. However, Jane is young still, and time and change are at work with her. We all have our sorrows, but I do not believe very much in the existence of sorrows that never heal.       II.    THE CONE.   The night was hot and overcast, the sky red-rimmed with the lingering sunset of midsummer. They sat at the open window, trying to fancy the air was fresher there. The trees and shrubs of the garden stood stiff and dark; beyond in the roadway a gas-lamp burnt, bright orange against the hazy blue of the evening. Farther were the three lights of the railway signal against the lowering sky. The man and woman spoke to one another in low tones.  \"He does not suspect?\" said the man, a little nervously.  \"Not he,\" she said peevishly, as though that too irritated her. \"He thinks of nothing but the works and the prices of fuel. He has no imagination, no poetry.\"  \"None of these men of iron have,\" he said sententiously. \"They have no hearts.\"  \"_He_ has not,\" she said. She turned her discontented face towards the window. The distant sound of a roaring and rushing drew nearer and grew in volume; the house quivered; one heard the metallic rattle of the tender. As the train passed, there was a glare of light above the cutting and a driving tumult of smoke; one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight black oblongs--eight trucks--passed across the dim grey of the embankment, and were suddenly extinguished one by one in the throat of the tunnel, which, with the last, seemed to swallow down train, smoke, and sound in one abrupt gulp.  \"This country was all fresh and beautiful once,\" he said; \"and now--it is Gehenna. Down that way--nothing but pot-banks and chimneys belching fire and dust into the face of heaven...But what does it matter? An end comes, an end to all this cruelty..._To-morrow.\"_ He spoke the last word in a whisper.  \"_To-morrow,\"_ she said, speaking in a whisper too, and still staring out of the window.  \"Dear!\" he said, putting his hand on hers.  She turned with a start, and their eyes searched one another's. Hers softened to his gaze. \"My dear one!\" she said, and then: \"It seems so strange--that you should have come into my life like this--to open--\" She paused.  \"To open?\" he said.  \"All this wonderful world\"--she hesitated, and spoke still more softly-- \"this world of _love_ to me.\"  Then suddenly the door clicked and closed. They turned their heads, and he started violently back. In the shadow of the room stood a great shadowy figure-silent. They saw the face dimly in the half-light, with unexpressive dark patches under the pent-house brows. Every muscle in Raut's body suddenly became tense. When could the door have opened? What had he heard? Had he heard all? What had he seen? A tumult of questions.  The new-comer's voice came at last, after a pause that seemed interminable. \"Well?\" he said.  \"I was afraid I had missed you, Horrocks,\" said the man at the window, gripping the window-ledge with his hand. His voice was unsteady.  The clumsy figure of Horrocks came forward out of the shadow. He made no answer to Raut's remark. For a moment he stood above them.  The woman's heart was cold within her. \"I told Mr. Raut it was just possible you might come back,\" she said in a voice that never quivered.  Horrocks, still silent, sat down abruptly in the chair by her little work-table. His big hands were clenched; one saw now the fire of his eyes under the shadow of his brows. He was trying to get his breath. His eyes went from the woman he had trusted to the friend he had trusted, and then back to the woman.  By this time and for the moment all three half understood one another. Yet none dared say a word to ease the pent-up things that choked them.  It was the husband's voice that broke"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1188"],["title","The Lair of the White Worm (#1)"],["body","you what I was speaking of last night.  Our route is to be by Salisbury, Bath, Bristol, Cheltenham, Worcester, Stafford; and so home.\"  Adam remained silent a few minutes, during which he seemed all eyes, for he perpetually ranged the whole circle of the horizon.  \"Has our journey to-day, sir,\" he asked, \"any special relation to what you said last night that you wanted to tell me?\"  \"Not directly; but indirectly, everything.\"  \"Won't you tell me now--I see we cannot be overheard--and if anything strikes you as we go along, just run it in.  I shall understand.\"  So old Salton spoke:  \"To begin at the beginning, Adam.  That lecture of yours on 'The Romans in Britain,' a report of which you posted to me, set me thinking--in addition to telling me your tastes.  I wrote to you at once and asked you to come home, for it struck me that if you were fond of historical research--as seemed a fact--this was exactly the place for you, in addition to its being the home of your own forbears.  If you could learn so much of the British Romans so far away in New South Wales, where there cannot be even a tradition of them, what might you not make of the same amount of study on the very spot.  Where we are going is in the real heart of the old kingdom of Mercia, where there are traces of all the various nationalities which made up the conglomerate which became Britain.\"  \"I rather gathered that you had some more definite--more personal reason for my hurrying.  After all, history can keep--except in the making!\"  \"Quite right, my boy.  I had a reason such as you very wisely guessed.  I was anxious for you to be here when a rather important phase of our local history occurred.\"  \"What is that, if I may ask, sir?\"  \"Certainly.  The principal landowner of our part of the county is on his way home, and there will be a great home-coming, which you may care to see.  The fact is, for more than a century the various owners in the succession here, with the exception of a short time, have lived abroad.\"  \"How is that, sir, if I may ask?\"  \"The great house and estate in our part of the world is Castra Regis, the family seat of the Caswall family.  The last owner who lived here was Edgar Caswall, grandfather of the man who is coming here--and he was the only one who stayed even a short time.  This man's grandfather, also named Edgar--they keep the tradition of the family Christian name--quarrelled with his family and went to live abroad, not keeping up any intercourse, good or bad, with his relatives, although this particular Edgar, as I told you, did visit his family estate, yet his son was born and lived and died abroad, while his grandson, the latest inheritor, was also born and lived abroad till he was over thirty--his present age.  This was the second line of absentees.  The great estate of Castra Regis has had no knowledge of its owner for five generations--covering more than a hundred and twenty years.  It has been well administered, however, and no tenant or other connected with it has had anything of which to complain.  All the same, there has been much natural anxiety to see the new owner, and we are all excited about the event of his coming.  Even I am, though I own my own estate, which, though adjacent, is quite apart from Castra Regis.--Here we are now in new ground for you.  That is the spire of Salisbury Cathedral, and when we leave that we shall be getting close to the old Roman county, and you will naturally want your eyes.  So we shall shortly have to keep our minds on old Mercia.  However, you need not be disappointed.  My old friend, Sir Nathaniel de Salis, who, like myself, is a free-holder near Castra Regis--his estate, Doom Tower, is over the border of Derbyshire, on the Peak--is coming to stay with me for the festivities to welcome Edgar Caswall.  He is just the sort of man you will like.  He is devoted to history, and is President of the Mercian Archaeological Society.  He knows more of our own part of the country, with its history and its people, than anyone else.  I expect he will have arrived before us, and we three can have a long chat after dinner.  He is also our local geologist and natural historian.  So you and he will have many interests in common.  Amongst other things he has a special knowledge of the Peak and its caverns, and knows all the old legends of prehistoric times.\"  They spent the night at Cheltenham, and on the following morning resumed their journey to Stafford.  Adam's eyes were in constant employment, and it was not till Salton declared that they had now entered on the last stage of their journey, that he referred to Sir Nathaniel's coming.  As the dusk was closing down, they drove on to Lesser Hill, Mr. Salton's house.  It was now too dark to see any details of their surroundings. Adam could just see that it was on the top of a hill, not quite so high as that which was covered by the Castle, on whose tower flew the flag, and which was all ablaze with moving lights, manifestly used in the preparations for the festivities on the morrow.  So Adam deferred his curiosity till daylight.  His grand-uncle was met at the door by a fine old man, who greeted him warmly.  \"I came over early as you wished.  I suppose this is your grand-nephew--I am glad to meet you, Mr. Adam Salton.  I am Nathaniel de Salis, and your uncle is one of my oldest friends.\"  Adam, from the moment of their eyes meeting, felt as if they were already friends.  The meeting was a new note of welcome to those that had already sounded in his ears.  The cordiality with which Sir Nathaniel and Adam met, made the imparting of information easy.  Sir Nathaniel was a clever man of the world, who had travelled much, and within a certain area studied deeply.  He was a brilliant conversationalist, as was to be expected from a successful diplomatist, even under unstimulating conditions.  But he had been touched and to a certain extent fired by the younger man's evident admiration and willingness to learn from him.  Accordingly the conversation, which began on the most friendly basis, soon warmed to an interest above proof, as the old man spoke of it next day to Richard Salton.  He knew already that his old friend wanted his grand-nephew to learn all he could of the subject in hand, and so had during his journey from the Peak put his thoughts in sequence for narration and explanation. Accordingly, Adam had only to listen and he must learn much that he wanted to know.  When dinner was over and the servants had withdrawn, leaving the three men at their wine, Sir Nathaniel began.  \"I gather from your uncle--by the way, I suppose we had better speak of you as uncle and nephew, instead of going into exact relationship?  In fact, your uncle is so old and dear a friend, that, with your permission, I shall drop formality with you altogether and speak of you and to you as Adam, as though you were his son.\"  \"I should like,\" answered the young man, \"nothing better!\"  The answer warmed the hearts of both the old men, but, with the usual avoidance of Englishmen of emotional subjects personal to themselves, they instinctively returned to the previous question.  Sir Nathaniel took the lead.  \"I understand, Adam, that your uncle has posted you regarding the relationships of the Caswall family?\"  \"Partly, sir; but I understood that I was to hear minuter details from you--if you would be so good.\"  \"I shall be delighted to tell you anything so far as my knowledge goes. Well, the first Caswall in our immediate record is an Edgar, head of the family and owner of the estate, who came into his kingdom just about the time that George III. did.  He had one son of about twenty-four.  There was a violent quarrel between the two.  No one of this generation has any idea of the cause; but, considering the family characteristics, we may take it for granted that though it was deep and violent, it was on the surface trivial.  \"The result of the quarrel was that the son left the house without a reconciliation or without even telling his father where he was going.  He never came back again.  A few years after, he died, without having in the meantime exchanged a word or a letter with his father.  He married abroad and left one son, who seems to have been brought up in ignorance of all belonging to him.  The gulf between them appears to have been unbridgable; for in time this son married and in turn had a son, but neither joy nor sorrow brought the sundered together.  Under such conditions no _rapprochement_ was to be looked for, and an utter indifference, founded at best on ignorance, took the place of family affection--even on community of interests.  It was only due to the watchfulness of the lawyers that the birth of this new heir was ever made known.  He actually spent a few months in the ancestral home.  \"After this the family interest merely rested on heirship of the estate. As no other children have been born to any of the newer generations in the intervening years, all hopes of heritage are now centred in the grandson of this man.  \"Now, it will be well for you to bear in mind the prevailing characteristics of this race.  These were well preserved and unchanging; one and all they are the same: cold, selfish, dominant, reckless of consequences in pursuit of their own will.  It was not that they did not keep faith, though that was a matter which gave them little concern, but that they took care to think beforehand of what they should do in order to gain their own ends.  If they should make a mistake, someone else should bear the burthen of it.  This was so perpetually recurrent that it seemed to be a part of a fixed policy.  It was no wonder that, whatever changes took place, they were always ensured in their own possessions. They were absolutely cold and hard by nature.  Not one of them--so far as we have any knowledge--was ever known to be touched by the softer sentiments, to swerve from his purpose, or hold his hand in obedience to the dictates of his heart.
