But fidgety Phil,     He won't sit still;     He wriggles,     And giggles,     And then, I declare,     Swings backwards and forwards,     And tilts up his chair,     Just like any rocking horse--     \"Philip! I am getting cross!\"      See the naughty, restless child     Growing still more rude and wild,     Till his chair falls over quite.     Philip screams with all his might,     Catches at the cloth, but then     That makes matters worse again.     Down upon the ground they fall,     Glasses, plates, knives, forks, and all.     How Mamma did fret and frown,     When she saw them tumbling down!     And Papa made such a face!     Philip is in sad disgrace.      Where is Philip, where is he?     Fairly covered up you see!     Cloth and all are lying on him;     He has pulled down all upon him.     What a terrible to-do!     Dishes, glasses, snapt in two!     Here a knife, and there a fork!     Philip, this is cruel work.     Table all so bare, and ah!     Poor Papa, and poor Mamma     Look quite cross, and wonder how     They shall have their dinner now.     The Story of Johnny Head-in-Air       As he trudged along to school,     It was always Johnny's rule     To be looking at the sky     And the clouds that floated by;     But what just before him lay,     In his way,     Johnny never thought about;     So that every one cried out     \"Look at little Johnny there,     Little Johnny Head-In-Air!\"      Running just in Johnny's way     Came a little dog one day;     Johnny's eyes were still astray     Up on high,     In the sky;     And he never heard them cry     \"Johnny, mind, the dog is nigh!\"     Bump!     Dump!     Down they fell, with such a thump,     Dog and Johnny in a lump!      Once, with head as high as ever,     Johnny walked beside the river.     Johnny watched the swallows trying     Which was cleverest at flying.     Oh! what fun!     Johnny watched the bright round sun     Going in and coming out;     This was all he thought about.     So he strode on, only think!     To the river's very brink,     Where the bank was high and steep,     And the water very deep;     And the fishes, in a row,     Stared to see him coming so.      One step more! oh! sad to tell!     Headlong in poor Johnny fell.     And the fishes, in dismay,     Wagged their tails and swam away.      There lay Johnny on his face,     With his nice red writing-case;     But, as they were passing by,     Two strong men had heard him cry;     And, with sticks, these two strong men     Hooked poor Johnny out again.      Oh! you should have seen him shiver     When they pulled him from the river.     He was in a sorry plight!     Dripping wet, and such a fright!     Wet all over, everywhere,     Clothes, and arms, and face, and hair:     Johnny never will forget     What it is to be so wet.      And the fishes, one, two, three,     Are come back again, you see;     Up they came the moment after,     To enjoy the fun and laughter.     Each popped out his little head,     And, to tease poor Johnny, said     \"Silly little Johnny, look,     You have lost your writing-book!\"     The Story of Flying Robert       When the rain comes tumbling down     In the country or the town,     All good little girls and boys     Stay at home and mind their toys.     Robert thought, \"No, when it pours,     It is better out of doors.\"     Rain it did, and in a minute     Bob was in it.     Here you see him, silly fellow,     Underneath his red umbrella.      What a wind! oh! how it whistles     Through the trees and flowers and thistles!     It has caught his red umbrella:     Now look at him, silly fellow--     Up he flies     To the skies.     No one heard his screams and cries;     Through the clouds the rude wind bore him,     And his hat flew on before him.      Soon they got to such a height,     They were nearly out of sight.     And the hat went up so high,     That it nearly touched the sky.     No one ever yet could tell     Where they stopped, or where they fell:     Only this one thing is plain,     Bob was never seen again!"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12122"],["title","The Monkey's Paw (#1)"],["body","in its virtues.  \"I suppose all old soldiers are the same,\" said Mrs. White.  \"The idea of our listening to such nonsense!  How could wishes be granted in these days?  And if they could, how could two hundred pounds hurt you, father?\"  \"Might drop on his head from the sky,\" said the frivolous Herbert.  \"Morris said the things happened so naturally,\" said his father, \"that you might if you so wished attribute it to coincidence.\"  \"Well, don't break into the money before I come back,\" said Herbert as he rose from the table.  \"I'm afraid it'll turn you into a mean, avaricious man, and we shall have to disown you.\"  His mother laughed, and following him to the door, watched him down the road; and returning to the breakfast table, was very happy at the expense of her husband's credulity.  All of which did not prevent her from scurrying to the door at the postman's knock, nor prevent her from referring somewhat shortly to retired sergeant-majors of bibulous habits when she found that the post brought a tailor's bill.  \"Herbert will have some more of his funny remarks, I expect, when he comes home,\" she said, as they sat at dinner.  \"I dare say,\" said Mr. White, pouring himself out some beer; \"but for all that, the thing moved in my hand; that I'll swear to.\"  \"You thought it did,\" said the old lady soothingly.  \"I say it did,\" replied the other.  \"There was no thought about it; I had just---- What's the matter?\"  His wife made no reply.  She was watching the mysterious movements of a man outside, who, peering in an undecided fashion at the house, appeared to be trying to make up his mind to enter.  In mental connection with the two hundred pounds, she noticed that the stranger was well dressed, and wore a silk hat of glossy newness.  Three times he paused at the gate, and then walked on again.  The fourth time he stood with his hand upon it, and then with sudden resolution flung it open and walked up the path. Mrs. White at the same moment placed her hands behind her, and hurriedly unfastening the strings of her apron, put that useful article of apparel beneath the cushion of her chair.  She brought the stranger, who seemed ill at ease, into the room.  He gazed at her furtively, and listened in a preoccupied fashion as the old lady apologized for the appearance of the room, and her husband's coat, a garment which he usually reserved for the garden.  She then waited as patiently as her sex would permit, for him to broach his business, but he was at first strangely silent.  \"I--was asked to call,\" he said at last, and stooped and picked a piece of cotton from his trousers.  \"I come from 'Maw and Meggins.'\"  The old lady started.  \"Is anything the matter?\"  she asked, breathlessly.  \"Has anything happened to Herbert?  What is it?  What is it?\"  Her husband interposed.  \"There, there, mother,\" he said, hastily.  \"Sit down, and don't jump to conclusions.  You've not brought bad news, I'm sure, sir;\" and he eyed the other wistfully.  \"I'm sorry--\" began the visitor.  \"Is he hurt?\"  demanded the mother, wildly.  The visitor bowed in assent.  \"Badly hurt,\" he said, quietly, \"but he is not in any pain.\"  \"Oh, thank God!\" said the old woman, clasping her hands.  \"Thank God for that!  Thank--\"  She broke off suddenly as the sinister meaning of the assurance dawned upon her and she saw the awful confirmation of her fears in the other's averted face.  She caught her breath, and turning to her slower-witted husband, laid her trembling old hand upon his.  There was a long silence.  \"He was caught in the machinery,\" said the visitor at length in a low voice.  \"Caught in the machinery,\" repeated Mr. White, in a dazed fashion, \"yes.\"  He sat staring blankly out at the window, and taking his wife's hand between his own, pressed it as he had been wont to do in their old courting-days nearly forty years before.  \"He was the only one left to us,\" he said, turning gently to the visitor. \"It is hard.\"  The other coughed, and rising, walked slowly to the window.  \"The firm wished me to convey their sincere sympathy with you in your great loss,\" he said, without looking round.  \"I beg that you will understand I am only their servant and merely obeying orders.\"  There was no reply; the old woman's face was white, her eyes staring, and her breath inaudible; on the husband's face was a look such as his friend the sergeant might have carried into his first action.  \"I was to say that 'Maw and Meggins' disclaim all responsibility,\" continued the other.  \"They admit no liability at all, but in consideration of your son's services, they wish to present you with a certain sum as compensation.\"  Mr. White dropped his wife's hand, and rising to his feet, gazed with a look of horror at his visitor.  His dry lips shaped the words, \"How much?\"  \"Two hundred pounds,\" was the answer.  Unconscious of his wife's shriek, the old man smiled faintly, put out his hands like a sightless man, and dropped, a senseless heap, to the floor.   III.  In the huge new cemetery, some two miles distant, the old people buried their dead, and came back to a house steeped in shadow and silence.  It was all over so quickly that at first they could hardly realize it, and remained in a state of expectation as though of something else to happen --something else which was to lighten this load, too heavy for old hearts to bear.  But the days passed, and expectation gave place to resignation--the hopeless resignation of the old, sometimes miscalled, apathy.  Sometimes they hardly exchanged a word, for now they had nothing to talk about, and their days were long to weariness.  It was about a week after that the old man, waking suddenly in the night, stretched out his hand and found himself alone.  The room was in darkness, and the sound of subdued weeping came from the window.  He raised himself in bed and listened.  \"Come back,\" he said, tenderly.  \"You will be cold.\"  \"It is colder for my son,\" said the old woman, and wept afresh.  The sound of her sobs died away on his ears.  The bed was warm, and his eyes heavy with sleep.  He dozed fitfully, and then slept until a sudden wild cry from his wife awoke him with a start.  \"The paw!\"  she cried wildly.  \"The monkey's paw!\"  He started up in alarm.  \"Where?  Where is it?  What's the matter?\"  She came stumbling across the room toward him.  \"I want it,\" she said, quietly.  \"You've not destroyed it?\"  \"It's in the parlour, on the bracket,\" he replied, marvelling.  \"Why?\"  She cried and laughed together, and bending over, kissed his cheek.  \"I only just thought of it,\" she said, hysterically.  \"Why didn't I think of it before?  Why didn't you think of it?\"  \"Think of what?\"  he questioned.  \"The other two wishes,\" she replied, rapidly. \"We've only had one.\"  \"Was not that enough?\"  he demanded, fiercely.  \"No,\" she cried, triumphantly; \"we'll have one more.  Go down and get it quickly, and wish our boy alive again.\"  The man sat up in bed and flung the bedclothes from his quaking limbs. \"Good God, you are mad!\"  he cried, aghast.  \"Get it,\" she panted; \"get it quickly, and wish--Oh, my boy, my boy!\"  Her husband struck a match and lit the candle.  \"Get back to bed,\" he said, unsteadily.  \"You don't know what you are saying.\"  \"We had the first wish granted,\" said the old woman, feverishly; \"why not the second?\"  \"A coincidence,\" stammered the old man.  \"Go and get it and wish,\" cried his wife, quivering with excitement.  The old man turned and regarded her, and his voice shook.  \"He has been dead ten days, and besides he--I would not tell you else, but--I could only recognize him by his clothing.  If he was too terrible for you to see then, how now?\"  \"Bring him back,\" cried the old woman, and dragged him toward the door. \"Do you think I fear the child I have nursed?\"  He went down in the darkness, and felt his way to the parlour, and then to the mantelpiece.  The talisman was in its place, and a horrible fear that the unspoken wish might bring his mutilated son before him ere he could escape from the room seized upon him, and he caught his breath as he found that he had lost the direction of the door.  His brow cold with sweat, he felt his way round the table, and groped along the wall until he found himself in the small passage with the unwholesome thing in his hand.  Even his wife's face seemed changed as he entered the room.  It was white and expectant, and to his fears seemed to have an unnatural look upon it. He was afraid of her.  \"Wish!\"  she cried, in a strong voice.  \"It is foolish and wicked,\" he faltered.  \"Wish!\"  repeated his wife.  He raised his hand.  \"I wish my son alive again.\"  The talisman fell to the floor, and he regarded it fearfully.  Then he sank trembling into a chair as the old woman, with burning eyes, walked to the window and raised the blind.  He sat until he was chilled with the cold, glancing occasionally at the figure of the old woman peering through the window.  The candle-end, which had burned below the rim of the china candlestick, was throwing pulsating shadows on the ceiling and walls, until, with a flicker larger than the rest, it expired.  The old man, with an unspeakable sense of relief at the failure of the talisman, crept back to his bed, and a minute or two afterward the old woman came silently and apathetically beside him.  Neither spoke, but lay silently listening to the ticking of the clock.  A stair creaked, and a squeaky mouse scurried noisily through the wall. The darkness was oppressive, and after lying for some time screwing up his courage, he took the box of matches, and striking one, went downstairs for a candle.  At the foot of the stairs the match went out, and he paused to strike another; and at the same moment a knock, so quiet and stealthy as to be scarcely audible, sounded on the front door.  The matches fell from his hand and spilled in the passage.  He stood motionless, his breath suspended until the knock was repeated.  Then he turned and fled swiftly back to his room,"]]]
