Indeed, he would have gone without eating it if she had not protested in a way that made Billy foolishly glad to submit; as it was, he saddled his horse while he waited, and reached for his sheepskin-lined, \"sour-dough\" coat before the last mouthful was fairly swallowed. At the last minute he unbuckled his gun belt and held it out to her.  \"I'll leave you this,\" he remarked, with an awkward attempt to appear careless. \"You'll feel safer if you have a gun, and--and if you're scared at anything, shoot it.\" He finished with another smile that lighted wonderfully his face and his eyes.  She shook her head. \"I've often stayed alone. There's nothing in the world to be afraid of--and anyway, I'll have the dog. Thank you, all the same.\"  Charming Billy looked at her, opened his mouth and closed it without speaking. He laid the gun down on the table and turned to go. \"If anything scares yuh,\" he repeated stubbornly, \"shoot it. Yuh don't want to count too much on that dawg.\"  He discovered then that Flora Bridger was an exceedingly willful young woman. She picked up the gun, overtook him, and fairly forced it into his hands. \"Don't be silly; I don't want it. I'm not such a coward as all that. You must have a very poor opinion of women. I--I'm deadly afraid of a gun!\"  Billy was not particularly impressed by the last statement, but he felt himself at the end of his resources and buckled the belt around him without more argument. After all, he told himself, it was not likely that she would have cause for alarm in the few hours that he would be gone, and those hours he meant to trim down as much as possible.  Out of the coulée where the high wall broke the force of the storm, he faced the snow and wind and pushed on doggedly. It was bitter riding, that night, but he had seen worse and the discomfort of it troubled him little; it was not the first time he had bent head to snow and driving wind and had kept on so for hours. What harassed him most were the icy hills where the chinook had melted the snow, and the north wind, sweeping over, had frozen it all solid again. He could not ride as fast as he had counted upon riding, and he realized that it would be long hours before he could get back to the cabin with a horse from Bridger's.  Billy could not tell when first came the impulse to turn back. It might have been while he was working his way cautiously up a slippery coulée side, or it might have come suddenly just when he stopped; for stop he did (just when he should logically have ridden faster because the way was smoother) and turned his horse's head downhill.  \"If she'd kept the gun--\" he muttered, apologizing to himself for the impulse, and flayed his horse with his _romal_ because he did not quite understand himself and so was ill at ease. Afterward, when he was loping steadily down the coulée bottom with his fresh-made tracks pointing the way before him, he broke out irrelevantly and viciously: \"A real, old range rider yuh can bank on, one way or the other--but damn a pilgrim!\"  The wind and the snow troubled him not so much now that his face was not turned to meet them, but it seemed to him that the way was rougher and that the icy spots were more dangerous to the bones of himself and his horse than when he had come that way before. He did not know why he need rage at the pace he must at times keep, and it did strike him as being a foolish thing to do--this turning back when he was almost halfway to his destination; but for every time he thought that, he urged his horse more.  The light from the cabin window, twinkling through the storm, cheered him a little, which was quite as unreasonable as his uneasiness. It did not, however, cause him to linger at turning his horse into the stable and shutting the door upon him. When he passed the cabin window he glanced anxiously in and saw dimly through the half-frosted glass that Miss Bridger was sitting against the wall by the table, tight-lipped and watchful. He hurried to the door and pushed it open.  \"Why, hello,\" greeted the Pilgrim uncertainly, The Pilgrim was standing in the centre of the room, and he did not look particularly pleased. Charming Billy, every nerve on edge, took in the situation at a glance, kicked the Pilgrim's dog and shook the snow from his hat.  \"I lost the trail,\" he lied briefly and went over to the stove. He did not look at Miss Bridger directly, but he heard the deep breath which she took.  \"Well, so did I,\" the Pilgrim began eagerly, with just the least slurring of his syllables. \"I'd have been here before dark, only one of the horses slipped and lamed himself. It was much as ever I got home at all. He come in on three legs, and toward the last them three like to went back on him.\"  \"Which hoss?\" asked Billy, though he felt pessimistically that he knew without being told. The Pilgrim's answer confirmed his pessimism. Of course, it was the only gentle horse they had.  \"Say, Billy, I forgot your tobacco,\" drawled the Pilgrim, after a very short silence which Billy used for much rapid thinking.  Ordinarily, Billy would have considered the over sight as something of a catastrophe, but he passed it up as an unpleasant detail and turned to the girl. \"It's storming something fierce,\" he told her in an exceedingly matter-of-fact way, \"but I think it'll let up by daylight so we can tackle it. Right now it's out of the question; so we'll have another supper--a regular blowout this time, with coffee and biscuits and all those luxuries. How are yuh on making biscuits?\"  So he got her out of the corner, where she had looked too much at bay to please him, and in making the biscuits she lost the watchful look from her eyes. But she was not the Flora Bridger who had laughed at their makeshifts and helped cook the chicken, and Charming Billy, raving inwardly at the change, in his heart damned fervently the Pilgrim.  In the hours that followed, Billy showed the stuff he was made of. He insisted upon cooking the things that would take the longest time to prepare; boasted volubly of the prune pies he could make, and then set about demonstrating his skill and did not hurry the prunes in the stewing. He fished out a package of dried lima beans and cooked some of them, changing the water three times and always adding cold water. For all that, supper was eventually ready and eaten and the dishes washed--with Miss Bridger wiping them and with the Pilgrim eying them both in a way that set on edge the teeth of Charming Billy.  When there was absolutely nothing more to keep them busy, Billy got the cards and asked Miss Bridger if she could play coon-can--which was the only game he knew that was rigidly \"two-handed.\" She did not know the game and he insisted upon teaching her, though the Pilgrim glowered and hinted strongly at seven-up or something else which they could all play.  \"I don't care for seven-up,\" Miss Bridger quelled, speaking to him for the first time since Billy returned. \"I want to learn this game that--er--Billy knows.\" There was a slight hesitation on the name, which was the only one she knew to call him by.  The Pilgrim grunted and retired to the stove, rattled the lids ill-naturedly and smoked a vile cigar which he had brought from town. After that he sat and glowered at the two.  Billy did the best he could to make the time pass quickly. He had managed to seat Miss Bridger so that her back was toward the stove and the Pilgrim, and he did it so unobtrusively that neither guessed his reason. He taught her coon-can, two-handed whist and Chinese solitaire before a gray lightening outside proclaimed that the night was over. Miss Bridger, heavy-eyed and languid, turned her face to the window; Billy swept the cards together and stacked them with an air of finality.  \"I guess we can hit the trail now without losing ourselves,\" he remarked briskly. \"Pilgrim, come on out and help me saddle up; we'll see if that old skate of yours is able to travel.\"  The Pilgrim got up sullenly and went out, and Billy followed him silently. His own horse had stood with the saddle on all night, and the Pilgrim snorted when he saw it. But Billy only waited till the Pilgrim had put his saddle on the gentlest mount they had, then took the reins from him and led both horses to the door.  \"All right,\" he called to the girl; helped her into the saddle and started off, with not a word of farewell from Miss Bridger to the Pilgrim.  The storm had passed and the air was still and biting cold. The eastern sky was stained red and purple with the rising sun, and beneath the feet of their horses the snow creaked frostily. So they rode down the coulée and then up a long slope to the top, struck the trail and headed straight north with a low line of hills for their goal. And in the hour and a half of riding, neither spoke a dozen words.  At the door of her own home Billy left her, and gathered up the reins of the Pilgrim's horse. \"Well, good-by. Oh, that's all right--it wasn't any trouble at all,\" he said huskily when she tried to thank him, and galloped away.     CHAPTER III.  _Charming Billy Has a Fight._   If Billy Boyle had any ideals he did not recognize them as such, and he would not have known just how to answer you if you had asked him what was his philosophy of life. He was range-bred--as purely Western as were the cattle he tended--but he was not altogether ignorant of the ways of the world, past or present. He had that smattering of education which country schools and those of \"the county seat\" may give a boy who loves a horse better than books, and who, sitting hunched behind his geography, dreams of riding afar, of shooting wild things and of sleeping under the stars.  From the time he was sixteen he had lived chiefly in tents and line-camp cabins, his world the land of far horizons, of big sins, and virtues bigger. One creed he owned: to live \"square,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1221"],["title","A Preliminary Revision of the North American Species of Cactus, Anhalonium, and (#1)"],["body","than are certain species of Coryphantha and Echinocactus.  If genera are simply groups of convenience the separation should be made.  I. EUMAMILLARIA.  Flowers from the axils of the older or full-grown tubercles (hence usually appearing lateral), mostly small, and generally from whitish to pink or red: tubercles never grooved: fruit almost always clavate and scarlet.  A. Tubercles more or less quadrangular.  *  Central spines not hooked. +  More than one central spine.   1. Cactus alternatus, sp. nov.  Subglobose, 10 cm. in diameter, simple: tubercles long (15 to 20 mm.) and spreading, with woolly axils: radial spines 3, rigid and recurved, 5 mm. long; central spines 3, very stout and much recurved, 20 to 30 mm. long, alternating with the radials; all ashy colored and often twisted: flower and fruit unknown.--Type in Herb. Coulter.  The few spines, with the very short radials alternating with the very long and stout centrals, furnish a striking character. Occasionally one of the centrals is wanting.  2.Cactus acanthophlegmus (Lehm.) Kuntze, Rev. Gen. Pl. 260 (1891).    Mamillaria acanthophlegma Lehm. Delect. Sem. Hamb. (1833)  Subglobose with a deeply depressed vertex, or becoming cylindrical, 3 to 8.5 cm. in diameter: tubercles sharply quadrangular-conical, with densely woolly axils: radial spines 15 to 30, white, very slender (bristly) and radiant, sometimes coarse capillary, 4 to 7 mm. long, interwoven with those of neighboring tubercles and so covering the whole plant; central spines 2 to 4, robust and straight, erect or divergent, whitish or reddish, black-tipped, 5 to 6.5 mm. long: flowers reddish, 1 to 2 cm. broad: fruit unknown.  Type unknown.  From Coahuila and San Luis Potosi to Oaxaca.  Fl. May.  Specimens examined: Coahuila (Poselger of 1856; Pringle 3116 of 1890): San Luis Potosi (Eschanzier of 1891).  The central spines are quite variable in number and arrangement. In case there are two they are vertically placed and are either erect and parallel or widely divergent.  Even three centrals may occur in the same vertical plane; but more usually the three or four centrals are arranged about a center and are widely divergent.  The tubercles are apt to persist and to become naked and corky with age.  The axillary wool and the capillary radials are also apt to be more or less persistent, thus giving the whole plant a woolly appearance.  3.Cactus brandegei, sp. nov.  Cylindrical: tubercles sharply quadrangular-conical, 6 to 8 mm. long, with densely woolly axils: radial spines about 10, slender and rigid, whitish with dusky tips, spreading but not radiant, 7 to 10 mm. long; central spines 3 or 4, stouter and slightly longer, erect-spreading (sometimes slightly curved), reddish-brown below, becoming blackish above: flowers small (scarcely longer than the tubercle?): fruit unknown.  Type in Herb. Calif. Acad.  San Jorge, Lower California.  Fl. April.  Specimens examined: Lower California (Brandegee of 1889, at San Jorge).  The species has somewhat the spine characters of C. palmeri, but the sharply quadrangular and longer tubercles with axillary wool free from bristles suggest a very different affinity.  4.Cactus densispinus, sp. nov.  Globose, 7.5 cm. in diameter, simple: tubercles short, with woolly axils: radial spines about 25, erect-spreading, slender but rigid, yellow (brownish to black with age), unequal, 8 to 10 mm. long; central spines 6, a little longer (10 to 12 mm.) and straight, more rigid and darker, black-tipped: seeds obovate, reddish-brown, 1 mm. long.  Type in Herb. Coulter.  Very easily distinguished by its dense, erect spines, which so completely cover the plant as to give it the appearance of a large chestnut bur.  Another much smaller form, which seems to be a variety, has stouter and longer ashy-white spines, the centrals darker-tipped, and the lower centrals slightly curved.  ++ One short central spine (rarely two or none): ovaries immersed: seeds small, yellow and rugulose: simple.  5.Cactus heyderi (Muhlenpf.) Kuntze, Rev. Gen. Pl. 260 (1891).    Mamillaria heyderi  Muhlenpf. Allg. Gart. Zeit. xvi. 20(1848).   Mamillaria declivis  Dietr. Allg. Gart. Zeit. xviii. 235 (1850).   Mamillaria applanata  Engelm. Pl. Lindh 198 (1850).   Mamillaria texensis  Labouret, Monogr. Cact. 89 (1858).  Depressed, globose, usually with depressed vertex, 8 to 12 cm. broad, 2.5 to 5 cm. high: tubercles elongated: radial spines 10 to 22, whitish, 5 to 12 mm. long, the lower usually the longer, stouter, and often darker; central spine 4 to 8 mm. long, light yellowish-brown, stout, straight, and porrect: flowers 2 to 2.5 cm. long, reddish-white: fruit incurved, 1.5 to 3 cm. long. (Ill. Cact. Mex. Bound. t. 9. figs. 4-14).  Type unknown.  From the Guadalupe River, Texas, to the mouth of the Rio Grande, and westward to Arizona and Sonora.  Fl. April, May.  Specimens examined: Texas (Lindheimer of 1845, 1847, 1853; Wright 226, also collections of 1849, 1852, 1853, 1855, 1856; Bigelow of 1853; Trelease of 1892; Nealley of 1892): New Mexico (Wright 311; Bigelow of 1853, Evans of 1891): Arizona (Pringle of 1881): also growing in Mo. Bot. Gard. 1893; and in the World's Fair collection of Mrs. Nickels.  The radial spines are somewhat variable in relative length, often becoming almost equal, while sometimes the upper radials are very much reduced.  The figure referred to in Cact. Mex. Bound. is not satisfactory as to the general habit of the plant, which is flat-topped rather than hemispherical.  6.Cactus heyderi hemisphaericus (Engelm.).    Mamillaria hemisphaerica  Engelm. Pl. Lindh. 198 (1850).  Differs in being hemispherical instead of flat-topped, in its fewer (9 to 12) and shorter (4 to 8 mm.) radial spines, and much smaller less rough and lighter-colored seeds.  (Ill. Cact. Mex. Bound. t. 9. figs. 15-17)  Type, the \"Goebel's Garden\" plants in Herb. Mo. Bot. Gard.  Throughout southern Texas and southern New Mexico, and southward; not extending so far north or west as the species, and apparently not so abundant within the United States.  Fl. May.  Specimens examined: Texas(Schott 322, 614): New Mexico (Evans of 1891): also specimens cultivated in the Goebel Garden, St. Louis, in 1847, brought from \"below Matamoras on the Rio Grande\" by the St. Louis Volunteers, in 1816.  On account of its convex top the variety becomes somewhat higher than the species (5 to 7.5 cm.), and the flowers are sometimes slightly longer (2 to 3 cm.).  7.Cactus meiacanthus (Engelm.) Kuntze, Rev. Gen. Pl. 260 (1891).    Mamillaria meiacantha  Engelm. Syn. Cact. 263 (1856)  Hemispherical or with depressed vertex, 7.5 to 12.5 cm. in diameter, with a broad top-shaped base: tubercles compressed, 14 to 18 mm. long: radial spines 5 to 9 (usually about 6), stout and strongly subulate, 6 to 10 mm. long, straight or somewhat curved, whitish or yellowish, the lower mostly a little longer, the upper one sometimes wanting; central spine shorter and stout, darker, straight, and porrect, turned upwards among the radials, or rarely wanting: flowers 2.5 to 3 cm. long, reddish-white: fruit incurved, 2 to 3 cm. long.  (Ill. Cact. Mex. Bound. t. 9, figs.  1-3).  Type specimens are those of the collections of 1847, 1851, 1852, and 1853, from which the original description was drawn and all of which are in Herb. Mo. Bot. Gard.  From the Guadalupe River, Texas, to the \"Great Bend\" of the Rio Grande, westward through western Texas and New Mexico; also northern Mexico (Hemsley); Fl.  May, June.  Specimens examined: Texas (Wright of 1851, 1852; Bigelow of 1853): New Mexico (\"Missouri Volunteers\" of 1847; unknown collector in 1880); also specimens cultivated in St. Louis in 1853, and others growing in Mo. Bot. Gard. 1893.  Dr. Engelmann regarded this species as possibly only a variety of C. heyderi, to which it is certainly very closely allied through var. hemisphaerica, but the different tubercles and fewer stouter spines serve so well to distinguish it that it seems best to retain its specific rank.  In reference to the citation of the original description an explanation seems necessary, which will apply to numerous similar cases.  The Pacif. R. Rep. iv. 27 (1856), Syn. Cact. 263 (1858), and Cact. Mex. Bound. 9 (1859), have each been cited as the original publication.  The confusion has arisen from the fact that in both the publications of 1856 the description in the Rep. Mex. Bound. is referred to, and in that report the plant is fully described as \"sp. nov.\"  However, the publication of the Boundary Report was long delayed on account of the preparation of the plates, and in the meantime both the publications of 1856 had appeared, in each one of which the species is distinctly characterized and reference made to the description in the forthcoming Boundary Report. As between the two publications of 1856 the Syn. Cact. (Proc. Amer. Acad. iii. 259) was evidently distributed first.  8.Cactus gummiferus (Engelm.) Kuntze. Rev. Gen. Pl. 260 (1891).    Mamillaria gummifera  Engelm. Wisliz. Rep. 21 (1848).  Hemispherical, 7.5 to 12.5 cm. broad and 6 to 10 cm. high: tubercles 12 to 15 mm. long: radial spines 10 to 12, the lower stout, with dusky apex, 12 to 15 mm. long, twice or thrice as long as the whitish setaceous upper ones; central spine (sometimes two) shorter (about 4 mm.), stout, dusky and porrect: flowers 3 cm. long, reddish-white, brownish-red outside: fruit unknown. (Ill. Cact. Mex. Bound. t. 9. figs. 18-20)  Type probably lost, as no specimens could be found in the Engelmann Herbarium.  Chihuahua, near Cosihuiriachi.  So far as can be discovered, this species has not been collected since the original Wislizenus collection of 1846-47.  The plants were cultivated by Dr. Engelmann and made to bloom, showing the flowers to be larger and darker colored than in the rest of the group, from which the species also differs in its more robust habit, its very unequal radial spines, and the occasional occurrence of two centrals.    ** Central spine hooked."]]]
