The proprietor was somebody's chauffeur at the front, and we drank to his excellent health) --at a little village in a twilight full of the petrol of many cars and the wholesome flavour of healthy troops.  There is no better guide to camp than one's own thoughtful nose; and though I poked mine everywhere, in no place then or later did it strike that vile betraying taint of underfed, unclean men. And the same with the horses.  THE LINE THAT NEVER SLEEPS  It is difficult to keep an edge after hours of fresh air and experiences; so one does not get the most from the most interesting part of the day--the dinner with the local headquarters.  Here the professionals meet--the Line, the Gunners, the Intelligence with stupefying photo-plans of the enemy's trenches; the Supply; the Staff, who collect and note all things, and are very properly chaffed; and, be sure, the Interpreter, who, by force of questioning prisoners, naturally develops into a Sadducee.  It is their little asides to each other, the slang, and the half-words which, if one understood, instead of blinking drowsily at one's plate, would give the day's history in little.  But tire and the difficulties of a sister (not a foreign) tongue cloud everything, and one goes to billets amid a murmur of voices, the rush of single cars through the night, the passage of battalions, and behind it all, the echo of the deep voices calling one to the other, along the line that never sleeps.  .    .    .    .    .    .    .  The ridge with the scattered pines might have hidden children at play.  Certainly a horse would have been quite visible, but there was no hint of guns, except a semaphore which announced it was forbidden to pass that way, as the battery was firing. The Boches must have looked for that battery, too.  The ground was pitted with shell holes of all calibres--some of them as fresh as mole-casts in the misty damp morning; others where the poppies had grown from seed to flower all through the summer.  \"And where are the guns?\" I demanded at last.  They were almost under one's hand, their ammunition in cellars and dug-outs beside them.  As far as one can make out, the 75 gun has no pet name.  The bayonet is Rosalie the virgin of Bayonne, but the 75, the watchful nurse of the trenches and little sister of the Line, seems to be always \"soixante- quinze.\"  Even those who love her best do not insist that she is beautiful.  Her merits are French--logic, directness, simplicity, and the supreme gift of \"occasionality.\"  She is equal to everything on the spur of the moment.  One sees and studies the few appliances which make her do what she does, and one feels that any one could have invented her.  FAMOUS FRENCH 75's  \"As a matter of fact,\" says a commandant, \"anybody--or, rather, everybody did.  The general idea is after such-and-such system, the patent of which had expired, and we improved it; the breech action, with slight modification, is somebody else's; the sighting is perhaps a little special; and so is the traversing, but, at bottom, it is only an assembly of variations and arrangements.\"  That, of course, is all that Shakespeare ever got out of the alphabet.  The French Artillery make their own guns as he made his plays.  It is just as simple as that.  \"There is nothing going on for the moment; it's too misty,\" said the Commandant.  (I fancy that the Boche, being, as a rule methodical, amateurs are introduced to batteries in the Boche's intervals.  At least, there are hours healthy and unhealthy which vary with each position.)  \"But,\" the Commandant reflected a moment, \"there is a place--and a distance.  Let us say  .  .  .  \"  He gave a range.  The gun-servers stood back with the bored contempt of the professional for the layman who intrudes on his mysteries. Other civilians had come that way before--had seen, and grinned, and complimented and gone their way, leaving the gunners high up on the bleak hillside to grill or mildew or freeze for weeks and months.  Then she spoke.  Her voice was higher pitched, it seemed, than ours--with a more shrewish tang to the speeding shell.  Her recoil was as swift and as graceful as the shrug of a French-woman's shoulders; the empty case leaped forth and clanged against the trail; the tops of two or three pines fifty yards away nodded knowingly to each other, though there was no wind.  \"They'll be bothered down below to know the meaning of our single shot.  We don't give them one dose at a time as a rule,\" somebody laughed.  We waited in the fragrant silence.  Nothing came back from the mist that clogged the lower grounds, though no shell of this war was ever launched with more earnest prayers that it might do hurt.  Then they talked about the lives of guns; what number of rounds some will stand and others will not; how soon one can make two good guns out of three spoilt ones, and what crazy luck sometimes goes with a single shot or a blind salvo.  LESSON FROM THE \"BOCHE\"  A shell must fall somewhere, and by the law of averages occasionally lights straight as a homing pigeon on the one spot where it can wreck most.  Then earth opens for yards around, and men must be dug out,--some merely breathless, who shake their ears, swear, and carry on, and others whose souls have gone loose among terrors.  These have to be dealt with as their psychology demands, and the French officer is a good psychologist.  One of them said:  \"Our national psychology has changed.  I do not recognize it myself.\"  \"What made the change?\"  \"The Boche.  If he had been quiet for another twenty years the world must have been his--rotten, but all his.  Now he is saving the world.\"  \"How?\"  \"Because he has shown us what Evil is.  We--you and I, England and the rest--had begun to doubt the existence of Evil.  The Boche is saving us.\"  Then we had another look at the animal in its trench--a little nearer this time than before, and quieter on account of the mist.  Pick up the chain anywhere you please, you shall find the same observation-post, table, map, observer, and telephonist; the same always-hidden, always-ready guns; and same vexed foreshore of trenches, smoking and shaking from Switzerland to the sea.  The handling of the war varies with the nature of the country, but the tools are unaltered.  One looks upon them at last with the same weariness of wonder as the eye receives from endless repetitions of Egyptian hieroglyphics.  A long, low profile, with a lump to one side, means the field-gun and its attendant ammunition-case; a circle and slot stand for an observation-post; the trench is a bent line, studded with vertical plumes of explosion; the great guns of position, coming and going on their motors, repeat themselves as scarabs; and man himself is a small blue smudge, no larger than a foresight, crawling and creeping or watching and running among all these terrific symbols.  TRAGEDY OF RHEIMS  But there is no hieroglyphic for Rheims, no blunting of the mind at the abominations committed on the cathedral there. The thing peers upward, maimed and blinded, from out of the utter wreckage of the Archbishop's palace on the one side and dust-heaps of crumbled houses on the other.  They shelled, as they still shell it, with high explosives and with incendiary shells, so that the statues and the stonework in places are burned the colour of raw flesh.  The gargoyles are smashed; statues, crockets, and spires tumbled; walls split and torn; windows thrust out and tracery obliterated.  Wherever one looks at the tortured pile there is mutilation and defilement, and yet it had never more of a soul than it has to-day.  Inside--(\"Cover yourselves, gentlemen,\" said the sacristan, \"this place is no longer consecrated\")--everything is swept clear or burned out from end to end, except two candlesticks in front of the niche where Joan of Arc's image used to stand. There is a French flag there now.  [And the last time I saw Rheims Cathedral was in a spring twilight, when the great west window glowed, and the only lights within were those of candles which some penitent English had lit in Joan's honour on those same candlesticks.]  The high altar was covered with floor-carpets; the pavement tiles were cracked and jarred out by the rubbish that had fallen from above, the floor was gritty with dust of glass and powdered stone, little twists of leading from the windows, and iron fragments.  Two great doors had been blown inwards by the blast of a shell in the Archbishop's garden, till they had bent grotesquely to the curve of a cask.  There they had jammed.  The windows--but the record has been made, and will be kept by better hands than mine.  It will last through the generation in which the Teuton is cut off from the fellowship of mankind--all the long, still years when this war of the body is at an end, and the real war begins.  Rheims is but one of the altars which the heathen have put up to commemorate their own death throughout all the world.  It will serve.  There is a mark, well known by now, which they have left for a visible seal of their doom.  When they first set the place alight some hundreds of their wounded were being tended in the Cathedral.  The French saved as many as they could, but some had to be left.  Among them was a major, who lay with his back against a pillar.  It has been ordained that the signs of his torments should remain--an outline of both legs and half a body, printed in greasy black upon the stones.  There are very many people who hope and pray that the sign will be respected at least by our children's children.  IRON NERVE AND FAITH  And, in the meantime, Rheims goes about what business it may have with that iron nerve and endurance and faith which is the new inheritance of France.  There is agony enough when the big shells come in; there is pain and terror among the people; and always fresh desecration to watch and suffer.

And up at the third turn you'll find a good wheel off'n the stage.\" He slid down from the sweaty back of his nigh leader and stood slightly bow-legged and very determined before the garage owner, Bill Masters.  \"Wel-l--there ain't much sale for horses, Casey. I ain't got any place to keep 'em, nor any feed. I'll sell yuh a Ford on time, and--\"  Casey glanced over his shoulder to make sure the horses were standing quiet, dropped the reins and advanced upon Bill.  \"You _trade_,\" he stated flatly.  Bill backed a little. \"Oh, all right, if that's the way yuh feel. What yuh askin' for the four just as they stand?\"  \"Me? A Ford auty-_mo_-bile. I told yuh that, Bill. And I want you to put on the biggest horn that's made; one that can be heard from here to Pinnacle and back when I turn 'er loose. And run the damn thing out here right away and show me how it works, and how often you gotta wind it and when. Lucky I didn't bring no passengers down--I was runnin' empty. But I gotta take back a load of Bohunks to the Bluebird this afternoon, and my stage, she's a total wreck. I'll sign papers to-night if you got any to sign.\"     CHAPTER II   Thus was the trade effected with much speed and few preliminaries, because Bill knew Casey Ryan very intimately and had seen him in action when his temper was up. Bill adjusted an extra horn which he happened to have in stock. One of those terrific things that go far toward making the life of a pedestrian a nerve-racking succession of startles. Casey tried it out on himself before he would accept it. He walked several doors down the street with the understanding that Bill would honk at him when he was some little distance away. Bill waited until Casey's attention was drawn to a lady with thick ankles who was crossing the street in a hurry and a stiff breeze. Bill came down on the metal plunger of the horn with all his might, and Casey jumped perceptibly and came back grinning.  \"She'll do. What'll put a crimp in Casey Ryan's spine is good enough for anybody. Bring her out here and show me how yuh work the damn thing. Guess she'll hold six Bohunks, won't she--with sideboards on? I'll run 'er around a coupla times b'fore I start out--and that's all I will do.\"  Naturally the garage man was somewhat perturbed at this nonchalant manner of getting acquainted with a Ford. He knew the road from Lund to Pinnacle. He had driven it himself, with a conscious sigh of relief when he had safely negotiated the last hair-pin curve; and Bill was counted a good driver. He suggested an insurance policy to Casey, not half so jokingly as he tried to sound.  Casey turned and gave him a pale blue, unwinking stare. \"Say! Never you mind gettin' out insurance on _this_ auty-_mo_-bile. What you wanta do is insure the cars that's liable to meet up with me in the trail.\"  Bill saw the sense of that, too, and said no more about insuring Casey. He drove down the canyon where the road is walled in on both sides by cliffs, and proceeded to give Casey a lesson in driving. Casey did not think that he needed to be taught how to drive. All he wanted to know, he said, was how to stop 'er and how to start 'er. Bill needn't worry about the rest of it.  \"She's darn tender-bitted,\" he commented, after two round trips over the straight half-mile stretch,--and fourteen narrow escapes. \"And the man that made 'er sure oughta known better than to make 'er neck rein in harness. And I don't like this windin' 'er up every time you wanta start. But she can sure _go_--and that's what Casey Ryan's after every day in the week.  \"All right, Bill. I'll go gather up the Bohunks and start. You better 'phone up to Pinnacle that Casey's on the road--and tell 'em he says it's his road's long's he's on it. They'll know what I mean.\"  Pinnacle did know, and waited on the sidewalk that afforded a view of the long hill where the road curled down around the head of the gulch and into town. Much sooner than his most optimistic backers had a right to expect-- for there were bets laid on the outcome there in Pinnacle--on the brow of the hill a swirl of red dust grew rapidly to a cloud. Like a desert whirlwind it swept down the road, crossed the narrow bridge over the deep cut at the head of the gulch where the famous Youbet mine belched black smoke, and rolled on down the steep, narrow little street.  Out of the whirlwind poked the pugnacious little brass-rimmed nose of a new Ford, and behind the windshield Casey Ryan grinned widely as he swung up to the postoffice and stopped as he had always stopped his four-horse stage,--with a flourish. Stopping with a flourish is fine and spectacular when you are driving horses accustomed to that method and on the lookout for it. Horses have a way of stiffening their forelegs and sliding their hind feet and giving a lot of dramatic finish to the performance. But there is no dramatic sense at all in the tin brain of a Ford. It just stopped. And the insecure fourth Bohunk in the tonneau went hurtling forward into the front seat straight on his way through the windshield. Casey threw up an elbow instinctively and caught him in the collar button and so avoided breakage and blood spattered around. Three other foreigners were scrambling to get out when Casey stopped them with a yell that froze them quiet where they were.  \"Hey! You stay right where y'are! I gotta deliver yuh up to the Bluebird in a minute.\"  There were chatterings and gesticulations in the tonneau. Out of the gabble a shrill voice rose be-seechingly in English. \"We will _walk_, meester'. If you _pleese_, meester! We are 'fraid for ride wit' dees may_chine_, meester!\"  Casey was nettled by the cackling and the thigh-slapping of the audience on the sidewalk. He reached for his stage whip, and missing it used his ready Irish fists. So the Bohunks crawled unhappily back into the car and subsided shivering and with tears in their eyes.  \"Dammit, when I take on passengers to ride, they're goin' to _ride_ till they git there. You shut up, back there!\"  A friend of Casey's stepped forward and cranked the machine, and Casey pulled down the gas lever until the motor howled, turned in the shortest possible radius and went lunging up the crooked steep trail to the Bluebird mine on top of the hill, his engine racing and screaming in low.  Thereafter Pinnacle and Lund had a new standard by which to measure the courage of a man. Had he made the trip with Casey Ryan and his new Ford? He _had_? By golly, he sure had nerve. One man passed the peak for sheer bravery and rode twice with Casey, but certain others were inclined to disparage the feat, on the ground that on the second trip he was drunk.  Casey did not like that. He admitted that he was a hard driver; he had always been proud because men called him the hardest driver in the West. But he argued that he was also a safe driver, and that they had no business to make such a fuss over riding with him. Didn't he ride after his own driving every day of his life? Had he ever got killed? Had he ever killed anybody else? Well! What were they all yawping about, then? Pinnacle and Lund made him tired.  \"If you fellers think I can't bounce that there tin can down the road fast as any man in the country, why don't yuh pass me on the road? You're welcome. Just try it.\"  No one cared to try, however. Meeting him was sufficiently hazardous. There were those who secretly timed their traveling so that they would not see Casey Ryan at all, and I don't think you can really call them cowards, either. A good many had families, you know.  Casey had an accident now and then; and his tire expense was such as to keep him up nights playing poker for money to support his Ford. You simply can't whirl into town at a thirty-mile gait--I am speaking now of Pinnacle, whose street was a gravelly creek bed quite dry and ridgy between rains--and stop in twice the car's length without scouring more rubber off your tires than a capacity load of passengers will pay for. Besides, you run short of passengers if you persist in doing it. Even the strangers who came in on the Salt Lake line were quite likely to look once at the cute little narrow-gauge train with its cunning little day coach hitched behind a string of ore cars, glance at Casey's Ford stage with indifference and climb into the cunning day coach for the trip to Pinnacle. The psychology of it passed quite over Casey's head, but his pocket felt the change.  In two weeks--perhaps it was less, though I want to be perfectly just-- Casey was back, afoot and standing bow-legged in the doorway of Bill Master's garage at Lund.  \"Gimme another one of them Ford auty-_mo_-biles,\" he requested, grinning a little. \"I guess mebby I oughta take two or three--but I'm a little short right now, Bill. I ain't been gitting any good luck at poker, lately.\"  Bill asked a question or two while he led Casey to the latest model of Fords, just in from the factory.  Casey took a chew of tobacco and explained. \"Well, I had a bet up, y'see. That red-headed bartender in Pinnacle bet me a hundred dollars I couldn't beat my own record ten minutes on the trip down. I knowed I could, so I took him up on it. A man would be a fool if he didn't grab any easy money like that. And so I pounded 'er on the tail, coming down. And I had eight minutes peeled off my best time, and then Jim Black he had to go git in the road on that last turn up there. We rammed our noses together and I pushed him on ahead of me for fifty rods, Bill--and him yelling at me to quit--but something busted in the insides of my car, I guess. She give a grunt and quit.
