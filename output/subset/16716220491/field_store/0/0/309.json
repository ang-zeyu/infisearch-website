It might not have been noticed by eyes less keen, but they understood at once that it was a signal. Robert noted its drifting progress across the heavens, and then he said to Willet:  \"How far from here do you calculate the base of that smoke is, Dave?\"  \"A long distance, Robert. Several miles maybe. The fire, I've no doubt, was kindled on top of a hill. It may be French speaking to Indians, or Indians talking to Indians.\"  \"And you don't think it's people of ours?\"  \"I'm sure it isn't. We've no hunters or runners in these parts, except ourselves.\"  \"And it's not Tandakora,\" said the Onondaga. \"He must be much farther away.\"  \"But the signal may be intended for him,\" said the hunter. \"It may be carried to him by relays of smoke. I wish I could read that trail across the sky.\"  \"It's thinning out fast,\" said Robert. \"You can hardly see it! and now it's gone entirely!\"  But the hunter continued to look thoughtfully at the sky, where the smoke had been. He never underrated the activity of the French, and he believed that a movement of importance, something the nature of which they should discover was at hand.  \"Lads,\" he said, \"I expected an easy night of good sleep for all three of us, but I'm thinking instead that we'd better take to the trail, and travel toward the place where that smoke was started.\"  \"It's what scouts would do,\" said Tayoga tersely.  \"And such we claim to be,\" said Robert.  As the sun began to sink they saw far in the west another smoke, that would have been invisible had it not been outlined against a fiery red sky, across which it lay like a dark thread. It was gone in a few moments, and then the dusk began to come.  \"An answer to the first signal,\" said Tayoga. \"It is very likely that a strong force is gathering. Perhaps Tandakora has come back and is planning a blow.\"  \"It can't be possible that they're aiming it at us,\" said the hunter, thoughtfully. \"They don't know of our presence here, and if they did we've too small a party for such big preparations.\"  \"Perhaps a troop of Pennsylvanians are marching westward,\" said Tayoga, \"and the French and their allies are laying a trap for them.\"  \"Then,\" said Robert, \"there is but one thing for us to do. We must warn our friends and save them from the snare.\"  \"Of course,\" said Willet, \"but we don't know where they are, and meanwhile we'd better wait an hour or two. Perhaps something will happen that will help us to locate them.\"  Robert and Tayoga nodded and the three remained silent while the night came. The blazing red in the west faded rapidly and darkness swept down over the wilderness. The three, each leaning against his tree, did not move but kept their rifles across their knees ready at once for possible use. Tayoga had fastened his bow over his back by the side of his quiver, and their packs were adjusted also.  Robert was anxious not so much for himself as for the unknown others who were marching through the wilderness, and for whom the French and Indians were laying an ambush. It had been put forward first as a suggestion, but it quickly became a conviction with him, and he felt that his comrades and he must act as if it were a certainty. But no sound that would tell them which way to go came out of this black forest, and they remained silent, waiting for the word.  The night thickened and they were still uncertain what to do. Robert made a silent prayer to the God of the white man, the Manitou of the red man, for a sign, but none came, and infected strongly as he was with the Indian philosophy and religion, he felt that it must be due to some lack of virtue in himself. He searched his memory, but he could not discover in what particular he had erred, and he was forced to continue his anxious waiting, until the stars should choose to fight for him.  Tayoga too was troubled, his mind in its own way being as active as Robert's. He knew all the spirits of earth, air and water were abroad, but he hoped at least one of them would look upon him with favor, and give him a warning. He sought Tododaho's star in the heavens, but the clouds were too thick, and, eye failing, he relied upon his ear for the signal which he and his young white comrade sought so earnestly.  If Tayoga had erred either in omission or commission then the spirits that hovered about him forgave him, as when the night was thickest they gave the sign. It was but the faint fall of a foot, and, at first, he thought a bear or a deer had made it, but at the fourth or fifth fall he knew that it was a human footstep and he whispered to his comrades:  \"Some one comes!\"  As if by preconcerted signal the three arose and crept silently into the dense underbrush, where they crouched, their rifles thrust forward.  \"It is but one man and he walks directly toward us,\" whispered Tayoga.  \"I hear him now,\" said Robert. \"He is wearing moccasins, as his step is too light for boots.\"  \"Which means that he's a rover like ourselves,\" said Willet. \"Now he's stopped. There isn't a sound. The man, whoever he is, has taken alarm, or at least he's decided that it's best for him to be more watchful. Perhaps he's caught a whiff from the ashes of our fire. He's white or he wouldn't be here alone, and he's used to the forest, or he wouldn't have suspected a presence from so little.\"  \"The Great Bear thinks clearly,\" said Tayoga. \"It is surely a white man and some great scout or hunter. He moved a little now to the right, because I heard his buckskin brush lightly against a bush. I think Great Bear is right about the fire. The wind has brought the ashes from it to his nostrils, and he will lie in the bush long before moving.\"  \"Which doesn't suit our plans at all,\" said Willet. \"There's a chance, just a chance, that I may know who he is. White men of the kind to go scouting through the wilderness are not so plenty on the border that one has to make many guesses. You lads move away a little so you won't be in line if a shot comes, and I'll give a signal.\"  Robert and Tayoga crept to other points in the brush, and the hunter uttered a whistle, low but very clear and musical. In a moment or two, a like answer came from a place about a hundred yards away, and Willet rising, advanced without hesitation. Robert and Tayoga followed promptly, and a tall figure, emerging from the darkness, came forward to meet them.  The stranger was a man of middle years, and of a singularly wild appearance. His eyes roved continually, and were full of suspicion, and of a sort of smoldering anger, as if he had a grievance against all the world. His hair was long and tangled, his face brown with sun and storm, and his dress more Indian than white. He was heavily armed, and, whether seen in the dusk or in the light, his whole aspect was formidable and dangerous. But Willet continued to advance without hesitation.  \"Captain Jack,\" he said extending his hand. \"We were not looking for you tonight, but no man could be more welcome. These are young friends of mine, brave warriors both, the white and the red, Robert Lennox, who is almost a son to me, and Tayoga, the Onondaga, to whom I feel nearly like a father too.\"  Now Robert knew him, and he felt a thrill of surprise, and of the most intense curiosity. Who along the whole border had not heard of Captain Jack, known also as the Black Hunter, the Black Rifle and by many other names? The tale had been told in every cabin in the woods how returning home, he had found his wife and children tomahawked and scalped, and how he had taken a vow of lifelong vengeance upon the Indians, a vow most terribly kept. In all the villages in the Ohio country and along the Great Lakes, the name of Black Rifle was spoken with awe and terror. No more singular and ominous figure ever crossed the pages of border story.  He swept the two youths with questing glances, but they met his gaze firmly, and while his eye had clouded at first sight of the Onondaga the threatening look soon passed.  \"Friends of yours are friends of mine, Dave Willet,\" he said. \"I know you to be a good man and true, and once when I was at Albany I heard of Robert Lennox, and of the great young warrior, Tayoga, of the clan of the Bear, of the nation Onondaga, of the great League of the Hodenosaunee.\"  The young Onondaga's eyes flashed with pleasure, but he was silent.  \"How does it happen, Willet?\" asked Black Rifle, \"that we meet here in the forest at such a time?\"  \"We're on our way to the Ohio country to learn something about the gathering of the French and Indian forces. Just before sundown we saw smoke signals and we think our enemies are planning to cut off a force of ours, somewhere here in the forest.\"  Black Rifle laughed, but it was not a pleasant laugh. It had in it a quality that made Robert shudder.  \"Your guesses are good, Dave,\" said Black Rifle. \"About fifty men of the Pennsylvania militia are in camp on the banks of a little creek two miles from here. They have been sent out to guard the farthest settlements. Think of that, Dave! They're to be a guard against the French and Indians!\"  His face contracted into a wry smile, and Robert understood his feeling of derision for the militia.  \"As I told you, they're in camp,\" continued Black Rifle. \"They built a fire there to cook their supper, and to show the French and Indians where they are, lest they miss 'em in the darkness. They don't know what part of the country they're in, but they're sure it's a long distance west of Philadelphia, and if the Indians will only tell 'em when they're coming they'll be ready for 'em. Oh, they're brave enough! They'll probably all die with their faces to the enemy.\"  He spoke with grim irony and Robert shuddered. He knew how helpless men from the older parts of the country were in the depths of the wilderness, and he was sure that the net was already being drawn about the Pennsylvanians.  \"Are the French here too, Black Rifle?\" asked Willet.  The strange man pointed toward the north.  \"A band led by a Frenchman is there,\" he"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11904"],["title","Ailsa Paige: A Novel (#1)"],["body","You'd better know the truth.  It is too late now to discuss whose fault it was that the trouble arose between your mother and me.  We lived together only a few weeks.  She was in love with her cousin; she didn't realise it until she'd married me.  I have nothing more to say on that score; she tried to be faithful, I believe she was; but he was a scoundrel.  And she ended by thinking me one.  \"Even before I married her I was made painfully aware that our dispositions and temperaments were not entirely compatible.  I think,\" he added grimly, \"that in the letters read to you this afternoon she used the expression, 'ice and fire,' in referring to herself and me.\"  Berkley only looked at him.  \"There is now nothing to be gained in reviewing that unhappy affair,\" continued the other.  \"Your mother's family are headlong, impulsive, fiery, unstable, emotional.  There was a last shameful and degrading scene.  I offered her a separation; but she was unwisely persuaded to sue for divorce.\"  Colonel Arran bent his head and touched his long gray moustache with bony fingers.  \"The proceeding was farcical; the decree a fraud.  I warned her; but she snapped her fingers at me and married her cousin the next day. . . .  And then I did my duty by civilisation.\"  Still Berkley never stirred.  The older man looked down at the wine-soiled cloth, traced the outline of the crimson stain with unsteady finger.  Then, lifting his head:  \"I had that infamous decree set aside,\" he said grimly.  \"It was a matter of duty and of conscience, and I did it without remorse. . . .  They were on what they supposed to be a wedding trip. But I had warned her.\"  He shrugged his massive shoulders.  \"If they were not over-particular they were probably happy.  Then he broke his neck hunting--before you were born.\"  \"Was he my father?\"  \"I am taking the chance that he was not.\"  \"You had reason to believe----\"  \"I thought so.  But--your mother remained silent.  And her answer to my letters was to have you christened under the name you bear to-day, Philip Ormond Berkley.  And then, to force matters, I made her status clear to her.  Maybe--I don't know--but my punishment of her may have driven her to a hatred of me--a desperation that accepted everything--even _you_!\"  Berkley lifted a countenance from which every vestige of colour had fled.  \"Why did you tell me this?\"  \"Because I believe that there is every chance--that you may be legally entitled to my name.  Since I have known who you are, I--I _have_ had you watched.  I have hesitated--a long while.   My brokers have watched you for a year, now; my attorneys for much longer.  To-day you stand in need of me, if ever you have stood in need of anybody.  I take the chance that you have that claim on me; I offer to receive you, provide for you.  That is all, Berkley. Now you know everything.\"  \"Who else--knows?\"  \"Knows what?\"  \"Knows what you did to my mother?\"  \"Some people among the families immediately concerned,\" replied Colonel Arran coolly.  \"Who are they?\"  \"Your mother's relatives, the Paiges, the Berkleys--my family, the Arrans, the Lents----\"  \"What Lents?\" interrupted the young man looking up sharply.  \"They live in Brooklyn.  There's a brother and a sister, orphans; and an uncle.  Captain Josiah Lent.\"  \"Oh. . . .  Who else?\"  \"A Mrs. Craig who lives in Brooklyn.  She was Celia Paige, your mother's maid of honour.\"  \"Who else?\"  \"A sister-in-law of Mrs. Craig, formerly my ward.  She is now a widow, a Mrs. Paige, living on London Terrace.  She, however, has no knowledge of the matter in question; nor have the Lents, nor any one in the Craig family except Mrs. Craig.\"  \"Who else?\"  \"Nobody.\"  \"I see. . . .  And, as I understand it, you are now stepping forward to offer me--on the chance of--of----\"  \"I offer you a place in this house as my son.  I offer to deal with you as a father--accepting that belief and every responsibility, and every duty, and every sacrifice that such a belief entails,\"  For a long time the young fellow stood there without stirring, pallid, his dark, expressionless eyes, fixed on space.  And after a while he spoke.  \"Colonel Arran, I had rather than all the happiness on earth, that you had left me the memory of my mother.  You have chosen not to do so.  And now, do you think I am likely to exchange what she and I really are, for anything more respectable that you believe you can offer?  \"How, under God, you could have punished her as you did--how you could have reconciled your conscience to the invocation of a brutal law which rehabilitated you at the expense of the woman who had been your wife--how you could have done this in the name of duty and of conscience, I can not comprehend.  \"I do not believe that one drop of your blood runs in my veins.\"  He bent forward, laying his hands flat on the cloth, then gripping it fiercely in clenched fists:  \"All I want of you is what was my mother's.  I bear the name she gave me; it pleased her to bestow it; it is good enough for me to wear.  If it be hers only, or if it was also my father's, I do not know; but that name, legitimate or otherwise, is not for exchange! I will keep it, Colonel Arran.  I am what I am.\"  He hesitated, rigid, clenching and unclenching his hands--then drew a deep, agonised breath:  \"I suppose you have meant to be just to me, I wish you might have dealt more mercifully with my mother.  As for what you have done to me--well--if she was illegally my mother, I had rather be her illegitimate son than the son of any woman who ever lived within the law.  Now may I have her letters?\"  \"Is that your decision, Berkley?\"  \"It is.  I want only her letters from you--and any little keepsakes--relics--if there be any----\"  \"I offer to recognise you as my son.\"  \"I decline--believing that you mean to be just--and perhaps kind--God knows what you do mean by disinterring the dead for a son to look back upon----\"  \"Could I have offered you what I offer, otherwise?\"  \"Man!  Man!  _You_ have nothing to offer _me_!  Your silence was the only kindness you could have done me!  You have killed something in me.  I don't know what, yet--but I think it was the best part of me.\"  \"Berkley, do you suppose that I have entered upon this matter lightly?\"  Berkley laughed, showing his teeth.  \"No.  It was your damned conscience; and I suppose you couldn't strangle it.  I am sorry you couldn't.  Sometimes a strangled conscience makes men kinder.\"  Colonel Arran rang.  A dark flush had overspread his forehead; he turned to the butler.  \"Bring me the despatch box which stands on: my study table.\"  Berkley, hands behind his back, was pacing the dining-room carpet.  \"Would you accept a glass of wine?\" asked Colonel Arran in a low voice.  Berkley wheeled on him with a terrible smile.  \"Shall a man drink wine with the slayer of souls?\" Then, pallid face horribly distorted, he stretched out a shaking arm.  \"Not that you ever could succeed in getting near enough to murder _hers_! But you've killed mine.  I know now what died in me.  It was that! . . .  And I know now, as I stand here excommunicated by you from all who have been born within the law, that there is not left alive in me one ideal, one noble impulse, one spiritual conviction.  I am what your righteousness has made me--a man without hope; a man with nothing alive in him except the physical brute. . . .  Better not arouse that.\"  \"You do not know what you are saying, Berkley\"--Colonel Arran choked; turned gray; then a spasm twitched his features and he grasped the arms of his chair, staring at Berkley with burning eyes.  Neither spoke again until Larraway entered, carrying an inlaid box.  \"Thank you, Larraway.  You need not wait.\"  \"Thank _you_, sir.\"  When they were again alone Colonel Arran unlocked and opened the box, and, behind the raised lid, remained invisibly busy for some little time, apparently sorting and re-sorting the hidden contents. He was so very long about it that Berkley stirred at last in his chair; and at the same moment the older man seemed to arrive at an abrupt decision, for he closed the lid and laid two packages on the cloth between them.  \"Are these mine?\" asked Berkley.  \"They are mine,\" corrected the other quietly, \"but I choose to yield them to you.\"  \"Thank you,\" said Berkley.  There was a hint of ferocity in his voice.  He took the letters, turned around to look for his hat, found it, and straightened up with a long, deep intake of breath.  \"I think there is nothing more to be said between us, Colonel Arran?\"  \"That lies with you.\"  Berkley passed a steady hand across his eyes.  \"Then, sir, there remain the ceremonies of my leave taking--\" he stepped closer, level-eyed--\"and my very bitter hatred.\"  There was a pause.  Colonel Arran waited a moment, then struck the bell:  \"Larraway, Mr. Berkley has decided to go.\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"You will accompany Mr. Berkley to the door.\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"And hand to Mr. Berkley the outer key of this house.\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"And in case Mr. Berkley ever again desires to enter this house, he is to be admitted, and his orders are to be obeyed by every servant in it.\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  Colonel Arran rose trembling.  He and Berkley looked at each other; then both bowed; and the butler ushered out the younger man.  \"Pardon--the latch-key, sir.\"  Berkley took it, examined it, handed it back.  \"Return it to Colonel Arran with Mr. Berkley's undying--compliments,\" he said, and went blindly out into the April night, but his senses were swimming as though he were drunk.   Behind him the door of the house of Arran clanged.  Larraway stood stealthily peering through the side-lights; then tiptoed toward the hallway and entered the dining-room with velvet tread.  \"Port or brandy, sir?\" he whispered at Colonel Arran's elbow.  The Colonel shook his head.  \"Nothing more.  Take that box to my study.\"  Later, seated at his study table before the open box, he heard Larraway knock; and he quietly laid away the miniature of Berkley's mother which had"]]]
