Handsome and trim and affable, he defied chronology by looking ten years younger than he was known to be. For at least a decade he had been invaluable to Lichfield matrons alike against the entertainment of an \"out-of-town girl,\" the management of a cotillion and the prevention of unpleasant pauses among incongruous dinner companies.  In short, he was by all accounts the social triumph of his generation; and his military title, won by four years of arduous service at receptions and parades while on the staff of a former Governor of the State, this seasoned bachelor carried off with plausibility and distinction.  The story finds him \"Librarian and Corresponding Secretary\" of the Lichfield Historical Association, which office he had held for some six years. The salary was small, and the colonel had inherited little; but his sister, Miss Agatha Musgrave, who lived with him, was a notable housekeeper. He increased his resources in a gentlemanly fashion by genealogical research, directed mostly toward the rehabilitation of ambiguous pedigrees; and for the rest, no other man could have fulfilled more gracefully the main duty of the Librarian, which was to exhibit the Association's collection of relics to hurried tourists \"doing\" Lichfield.  His \"Library manner\" was modeled upon that which an eighteenth century portrait would conceivably possess, should witchcraft set the canvas breathing.     III   Also the story finds Colonel Musgrave in the company of his sister on a warm April day, whilst these two sat upon the porch of the Musgrave home in Lichfield, and Colonel Musgrave waited until it should be time to open the Library for the afternoon. And about them birds twittered cheerily, and the formal garden flourished as gardens thrive nowhere except in Lichfield, and overhead the sky was a turkis-blue, save for a few irrelevant clouds which dappled it here and there like splashes of whipped cream.  Yet, for all this, the colonel was ill-at-ease; and care was on his brow, and venom in his speech.  \"And one thing,\" Colonel Musgrave concluded, with decision, \"I wish distinctly understood, and that is, if she insists on having young men loafing about her--as, of course, she will--she will have to entertain them in the garden. I won't have them in the house, Agatha. You remember that Langham girl you had here last Easter?\" he added, disconsolately --\"the one who positively littered up the house with young men, and sang idiotic jingles to them at all hours of the night about the Bailey family and the correct way to spell chicken? She drove me to the verge of insanity, and I haven't a doubt that this Patricia person will be quite as obstreperous. So, please mention it to her, Agatha--casually, of course--that, in Lichfield, when one is partial to either vocal exercise or amorous daliance, the proper scene of action is the garden. I really cannot be annoyed by her.\"  \"But, Rudolph,\" his sister protested, \"you forget she is engaged to the Earl of Pevensey. An engaged girl naturally wouldn't care about meeting any young men.\"  \"H'm!\" said the colonel, drily.  Ensued a pause, during which the colonel lighted yet another cigarette.  Then, \"I have frequently observed,\" he spoke, in absent wise, \"that all young women having that peculiarly vacuous expression about the eyes--I believe there are misguided persons who describe such eyes as being 'dreamy,'--are invariably possessed of a fickle, unstable and coquettish temperament. Oh, no! You may depend upon it, Agatha, the fact that she contemplates purchasing the right to support a peculiarly disreputable member of the British peerage will not hinder her in the least from making advances to all the young men in the neighborhood.\"  Miss Musgrave was somewhat ruffled. She was a homely little woman with nothing of the ordinary Musgrave comeliness. Candor even compels the statement that in her pudgy swarthy face there was a droll suggestion of the pug-dog.  \"I am sure,\" Miss Musgrave remonstrated, with placid dignity, \"that you know nothing whatever about her, and that the reports about the earl have probably been greatly exaggerated, and that her picture shows her to be an unusually attractive girl. Though it is true,\" Miss Musgrave conceded after reflection, \"that there are any number of persons in the House of Lords that I wouldn't in the least care to have in my own house, even with the front parlor all in linen as it unfortunately is. So awkward when you have company! And the Bible does bid us not to put our trust in princes, and, for my part, I never thought that photographs could be trusted, either.\"  \"Scorn not the nobly born, Agatha,\" her brother admonished her, \"nor treat with lofty scorn the well-connected. The very best people are sometimes respectable. And yet,\" he pursued, with a slight hiatus of thought, \"I should not describe her as precisely an attractive-looking girl. She seems to have a lot of hair,--if it is all her own, which it probably isn't,--and her nose is apparently straight enough, and I gather she is not absolutely deformed anywhere; but that is all I can conscientiously say in her favor. She is artificial. Her hair, now! It has a--well, you would not call it exactly a crinkle or precisely a wave, but rather somewhere between the two. Yes, I think I should describe it as a ripple. I fancy it must be rather like the reflection of a sunset in--a duck-pond, say, with a faint wind ruffling the water. For I gather that her hair is of some light shade,--induced, I haven't a doubt, by the liberal use of peroxides. And this ripple, too, Agatha, it stands to reason, must be the result of coercing nature, for I have never seen it in any other woman's hair. Moreover,\" Colonel Musgrave continued, warming somewhat to his subject, \"there is a dimple--on the right side of her mouth, immediately above it,--which speaks of the most frivolous tendencies. I dare say it comes and goes when she talks,--winks at you, so to speak, in a manner that must be simply idiotic. That foolish little cleft in her chin, too--\"  But at this point, his sister interrupted him.  \"I hadn't a notion,\" said she, \"that you had even looked at the photograph. And you seem to have it quite by heart, Rudolph,--and some people admire dimples, you know, and, at any rate, her mother had red hair, so Patricia isn't really responsible. I decided that it would be foolish to use the best mats to-night. We can save them for Sunday supper, because I am only going to have eggs and a little cold meat, and not make company of her.\"  For no apparent reason, Rudolph Musgrave flushed.  \"I inspected it--quite casually--last night. Please don't be absurd, Agatha! If we were threatened with any other direful visitation --influenza, say, or the seventeen-year locust,--I should naturally read up on the subject in order to know what to expect. And since Providence has seen fit to send us a visitor rather than a visitation--though, personally, I should infinitely prefer the influenza, as interfering in less degree with my comfort,--I have, of course, neglected no opportunity of finding out what we may reasonably look forward to. I fear the worst, Agatha. For I repeat, the girl's face is, to me, absolutely unattractive!\"  The colonel spoke with emphasis, and flung away his cigarette, and took up his hat to go.  And then, \"I suppose,\" said Miss Musgrave, absently, \"you will be falling in love with her, just as you did with Anne Charteris and Aline Van Orden and all those other minxes. I _would_ like to see you married, Rudolph, only I couldn't stand your having a wife.\"  \"I! I!\" sputtered the colonel. \"I think you must be out of your head! I fall in love with that chit! Good Lord, Agatha, you are positively idiotic!\"  And the colonel turned on his heel, and walked stiffly through the garden. But, when half-way down the path, he wheeled about and came back.  \"I beg your pardon, Agatha,\" he said, contritely, \"it was not my intention to be discourteous. But somehow--somehow, dear, I don't quite see the necessity for my falling in love with anybody, so long as I have you.\"  And Miss Musgrave, you may be sure, forgave him promptly; and afterward--with a bit of pride and an infinity of love in her kind, homely face,--her eyes followed him out of the garden on his way to open the Library. And she decided in her heart that she had the dearest and best and handsomest brother in the universe, and that she must remember to tell him, accidentally, how becoming his new hat was. And then, at some"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10041"],["title","The Rivet in Grandfather's Neck: A Comedy of Limitations (#2)"],["body","thought, she smiled, wistfully.  \"She would be a very lucky girl if he did,\" said Miss Musgrave, apropos of nothing in particular; and tossed her grizzly head.  \"An earl, indeed!\" said Miss Musgrave     IV   And this is how it came about:  Patricia Vartrey (a second cousin once removed of Colonel Rudolph Musgrave's), as the older inhabitants of Lichfield will volubly attest, was always a person who did peculiar things. The list of her eccentricities is far too lengthy here to be enumerated; but she began it by being born with red hair--Titian reds and auburns were undiscovered euphemisms in those days--and, in Lichfield, this is not regarded as precisely a lady-like thing to do; and she ended it, as far as Lichfield was concerned, by eloping with what Lichfield in its horror could only describe, with conscious inadequacy, as \"a quite unheard-of person.\"  Indisputably the man was well-to-do already; and from this nightmarish topsy-turvidom of Reconstruction the fellow visibly was plucking wealth. Also young Stapylton was well enough to look at, too, as Lichfield flurriedly conceded.  But it was equally undeniable that he had made his money through a series of commercial speculations distinguished both by shiftiness and daring, and that the man himself had been until the War a wholly negligible \"poor white\" person,--an overseer, indeed, for \"Wild Will\" Musgrave, Colonel Musgrave's father, who was of course the same Lieutenant-Colonel William Sebastian Musgrave, C.S.A., that met his death at Gettysburg.  This upstart married Patricia Vartrey, for all the chatter and whispering, and carried her away from Lichfield, as yet a little dubious as to what recognition, if any, should be accorded the existence of the Stapyltons. And afterward (from a notoriously untruthful North, indeed) came rumors that he was rapidly becoming wealthy; and of Patricia Vartrey's death at her daughter's birth; and of the infant's health and strength and beauty, and of her lavish upbringing,--a Frenchwoman, Lichfield whispered, with absolutely nothing to do but attend upon the child.  And then, little by little, a new generation sprang up, and, little by little, the interest these rumors waked became more lax; and it was brought about, at last, by the insidious transitions of time, that Patricia Vartrey was forgotten in Lichfield. Only a few among the older men remembered her; some of them yet treasured, as these fogies so often do, a stray fan or an odd glove; and in bycorners of sundry time-toughened hearts there lurked the memory of a laughing word or of a glance or of some such casual bounty, that Patricia Vartrey had accorded these hearts' owners when the world was young.  But Agatha Musgrave, likewise, remembered the orphan cousin who had been reared with her. She had loved Patricia Vartrey; and, in due time, she wrote to Patricia's daughter,--in stately, antiquated phrases that astonished the recipient not a little,--and the girl had answered. The correspondence flourished. And it was not long before Miss Musgrave had induced her young cousin to visit Lichfield.  Colonel Rudolph Musgrave, be it understood, knew nothing of all this until the girl was actually on her way. And now, she was to arrive that afternoon, to domicile herself in his quiet house for two long weeks--this utter stranger, look you!--and upset his comfort, ask him silly questions, expect him to talk to her, and at the end of her visit, possibly, present him with some outlandish gimcrack made of cardboard and pink ribbons, in which she would expect him to keep his papers. The Langham girl did that.         *       *       *       *       *  It is honesty's part to give you the man no better than he was. Lichfield at large had pampered him; many women had loved him; and above all, Miss Agatha had spoiled him. After fifteen years of being the pivot about which the economy of a household revolves, after fifteen years of being the inevitable person whose approval must be secured before any domestic alteration, however trivial, may be considered, no mortal man may hope to remain a paragon of unselfishness.  Colonel Musgrave joyed in the society of women. But he classed them--say, with the croquettes adorned with pink paper frills which were then invariably served at the suppers of the Lichfield German Club,--as acceptable enough, upon a conscious holiday, but wholly incongruous with the slippered ease of home. When you had an inclination for feminine society, you shaved and changed your clothes and thought up an impromptu or so against emergency, and went forth to seek it. That was natural; but to have a petticoated young person infesting your house, hourly, was as preposterous as ice-cream soda at breakfast.  The metaphor set him off at a tangent. He wondered if this Patricia person could not (tactfully) be induced to take her bath after breakfast, as Agatha did? after he had his? Why, confound the girl, he was not responsible for there being only one bathroom in the house! It was necessary for him to have his bath and be at the Library by nine o'clock. This interloper must be made to understand as much.  The colonel reached the Library undecided as to whether Miss Stapylton had better breakfast in her room, or if it would be entirely proper for her to come to the table in one of those fluffy lace-trimmed garments such as Agatha affected at the day's beginning?  The question was a nice one. It was not as though servants were willing to be bothered with carrying trays to people's rooms; he knew what Agatha had to say upon that subject. It was not as though he were the chit's first cousin, either. He almost wished himself in the decline of life, and free to treat the girl paternally.  And so he fretted all that afternoon.         *       *       *       *       *  Then, too, he reflected that it would be very awkward if Agatha should be unwell while this Patricia person was in the house. Agatha in her normal state was of course the kindliest and cheeriest gentlewoman in the universe, but any physical illness appeared to transform her nature disastrously. She had her \"attacks,\" she \"felt badly\" very often nowadays, poor dear; and how was a Patricia person to be expected to make allowances for the fact that at such times poor Agatha was unavoidably a little cross and pessimistic?     V   Yet Colonel Musgrave strolled into his garden, later, with a tolerable affectation of unconcern. Women, after all, he assured himself, were necessary for the perpetuation of the species; and, resolving for the future to view these weakly, big-hipped and slope-shouldered makeshifts of Nature's with larger tolerance, he cocked his hat at a devil-may-carish angle, and strode up the walk, whistling jauntily and having, it must be confessed, to the unprejudiced observer very much the air of a sheep in wolf's clothing.  \"At worst,\" he was reflecting, \"I can make love to her. They, as a rule, take kindlily enough to that; and in the exercise of hospitality a host must go to all lengths to divert his guests. Failure is not permitted....\"  Then She came to him.  She came to him across the trim, cool lawn, leisurely, yet with a resilient tread that attested the vigor of her slim young body. She was all in white, diaphanous, ethereal, quite incredibly incredible; but as she passed through the long shadows of the garden--fire-new, from the heart of the sunset, Rudolph Musgrave would have sworn to you,--the lacy folds and furbelows and semi-transparencies that clothed her were now tinged with gold, and now, as a hedge or flower-bed screened her from the horizontal rays, were softened into multitudinous graduations of grays and mauves and violets.  \"Failure is not permitted,\" he was repeating in his soul....  \"You're Cousin Rudolph, aren't you?\" she asked. \"How perfectly entrancing! You see until to-day I always thought that if I had been offered the choice between having cousins or appendicitis I would have preferred to be operated on.\"  And Rudolph Musgrave noted, with a delicious tingling somewhere about his heart, that her hair was really like the reflection of a sunset in rippling waters,--only many times more beautiful, of course,--and that her mouth was an inconsiderable trifle, a scrap of sanguine curves, and that her eyes were purple glimpses of infinity.  Then he observed that his own mouth was giving utterance to divers irrelevant and foolish sounds, which eventually resolved themselves into the statement he was glad to see her. And immediately afterward the banality of this remark brought the hot blood to his face and, for the rest of the day, stung him and teased him, somewhere in the background of his mind, like an incessant insect.  Glad, indeed!  Before he had finished shaking hands with Patricia Stapylton, it was all over with the poor man.  \"Er--h'm!\" quoth he.  \"Only,\" Miss Stapylton was meditating, with puckered brow, \"it would be unseemly for me to call you Rudolph--\"  \"You impertinent minx!\" cried he, in his soul; \"I should rather think it would be!\"  \"--and Cousin Rudolph sounds exactly like a dried-up little man with eyeglasses and crows' feet and a gentle nature. I rather thought you were going to be like that, and I regard it as extremely hospitable of you not to be. You are more like--like what now?\" Miss Stapylton put her head to one side and considered the contents of her vocabulary,--\"you are like a viking. I shall call you Olaf,\" she announced, when she had reached a decision.  This, look you, to the most dignified man in Lichfield,--a person who had never borne a nickname in his life. You must picture for yourself how the colonel stood before her, big, sturdy and blond, and glared down at her, and assured himself that he was very indignant; like Timanthes, the colonel's biographer prefers to draw a veil before the countenance to which art is unable to do justice.  Then, \"I have no admiration for the Northmen,\" Rudolph Musgrave declared, stiffly. \"They were a rude and "]]]
