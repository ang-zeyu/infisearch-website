But, mother, I didn't tell you of my good luck. See this,\" and he displayed the dollar bill.  \"How did you get it?\" asked his mother.  \"Holding horses. Here, take it, mother; I warrant you'll find a use for it.\"  \"It comes in good time,\" said Mrs. Harding. \"We're out of flour, and I had no money to buy any. Before you take off your boots, Jack, I wish you'd run over to the grocery store, and buy half a dozen pounds. You may get a pound of sugar, and quarter of a pound of tea also.\"  \"You see the Lord hasn't forgotten us,\" she remarked, as Jack started on his errand.  \"What's a dollar?\" said Rachel, gloomily. \"Will it carry us through the winter?\"  \"It will carry us through to-night, and perhaps Timothy will have work to-morrow. Hark, that's his step.\"  At this moment the outer door opened, and Timothy Harding entered, not with the quick, elastic step of one who brings good tidings, but slowly and deliberately, with a quiet gravity of demeanor in which his wife could read only too well that he had failed in his efforts to procure work.  Reading all this in his manner, she had the delicacy to forbear intruding upon him questions to which she saw it would only give him pain to reply.  Not so Aunt Rachel.  \"I needn't ask,\" she began, \"whether you've got work, Timothy. I knew beforehand you wouldn't. There ain't no use in tryin'! The times is awful dull, and mark my words, they'll be wuss before they're better. We mayn't live to see 'em. I don't expect we shall. Folks can't live without money; and if we can't get that, we shall have to starve.\"  \"Not so bad as that, Rachel,\" said the cooper, trying to look cheerful; \"I don't talk about starving till the time comes. Anyhow,\" glancing at the table, on which was spread a good plain meal, \"we needn't talk about starving till to-morrow with that before us. Where's Jack?\"  \"Gone after some flour,\" replied his wife.  \"On credit?\" asked the cooper.  \"No, he's got money enough to pay for a few pounds,\" said Mrs. Harding, smiling with an air of mystery.  \"Where did it come from?\" asked Timothy, who was puzzled, as his wife anticipated. \"I didn't know you had any money in the house.\"  \"No more we had; but he earned it himself, holding horses, this afternoon.\"  \"Come, that's good,\" said the cooper, cheerfully. \"We ain't so bad off as we might be, you see, Rachel.\"  \"Very likely the bill's bad,\" she said, with the air of one who rather hoped it was.  \"Now, Rachel, what's the use of anticipating evil?\" said Mrs. Harding. \"You see you're wrong, for here's Jack with the flour.\"  The family sat down to supper.  \"You haven't told us,\" said Mrs. Harding, seeing her husband's cheerfulness in a measure restored, \"what Mr. Blodgett said about the chances for employment.\"  \"Not much that was encouraging,\" answered Timothy. \"He isn't at all sure when it will be safe to commence work; perhaps not before spring.\"  \"Didn't I tell you so?\" commented Rachel, with sepulchral sadness.  Even Mrs. Harding couldn't help looking sober.  \"I suppose, Timothy, you haven't formed any plans,\" she said.  \"No, I haven't had time. I must try to get something else to do.\"  \"What, for instance?\"  \"Anything by which I can earn a little; I don't care if it's only sawing wood. We shall have to get along as economically as we can--cut our coat according to our cloth.\"  \"Oh, you'll be able to earn something, and we can live very plain,\" said Mrs. Harding, affecting a cheerfulness she didn't feel.  \"Pity you hadn't done it sooner,\" was the comforting suggestion of Rachel.  \"Mustn't cry over spilt milk,\" said the cooper, good-humoredly. \"Perhaps we might have lived a leetle more economically, but I don't think we've been extravagant.\"  \"Besides, I can earn something, father,\" said Jack, hopefully. \"You know I did this afternoon.\"  \"So you can,\" said his mother, brightly.  \"There ain't horses to hold every day,\" said Rachel, apparently fearing that the family might become too cheerful, when, like herself, it was their duty to be profoundly gloomy.  \"You're always tryin' to discourage people, Aunt Rachel,\" said Jack, discontentedly.  Rachel took instant umbrage at these words.  \"I'm sure,\" said she, mournfully, \"I don't want to make you unhappy. If you can find anything to be cheerful about when you're on the verge of starvation, I hope you'll enjoy yourselves, and not mind me. I'm a poor, dependent creetur, and I feel I'm a burden.\"  \"Now, Rachel, that's all foolishness,\" said Timothy. \"You don't feel anything of the kind.\"  \"Perhaps others can tell how I feel better than I can myself,\" answered his sister, with the air of a martyr. \"If it hadn't been for me, I know you'd have been able to lay up money, and have something to carry you through the winter. It's hard to be a burden on your relations, and bring a brother's family to this poverty.\"  \"Don't talk of being a burden, Rachel,\" said Mrs. Harding. \"You've been a great help to me in many ways. That pair of stockings, now, you're knitting for Jack--that's a help, for I couldn't have got time for them myself.\"  \"I don't expect,\" said Aunt Rachel, in the same sunny manner, \"that I shall be able to do it long. From the pains I have in my hands sometimes, I expect I'm goin' to lose the use of 'em soon, and be as useless as old Mrs. Sprague, who for the last ten years of her life had to sit with her hands folded on her lap. But I wouldn't stay to be a burden--I'd go to the poorhouse first. But perhaps,\" with the look of a martyr, \"they wouldn't want me there, because I'd be discouragin' 'em too much.\"  Poor Jack, who had so unwittingly raised this storm, winced under the last words, which he knew were directed at him.  \"Then why,\" asked he, half in extenuation, \"why don't you try to look pleasant and cheerful? Why won't you be jolly, as Tom Piper's aunt is?\"  \"I dare say I ain't pleasant,\" said Rachel, \"as my own nephew twits me with it. There is some folks that can be cheerful when their house is a-burnin' down before their eyes, and I've heard of one young man that laughed at his aunt's funeral,\" directing a severe glance at Jack; \"but I'm not one of that kind. I think, with the Scriptures, that there's a time to weep.\"  \"Doesn't it say there's a time to laugh, too?\" asked Mrs. Harding.  \"When I see anything to laugh about, I'm ready to laugh,\" said Aunt Rachel; \"but human nater ain't to be forced. I can't see anything to laugh at now, and perhaps you won't by and by.\"  It was evidently quite useless to persuade Rachel to cheerfulness, and the subject dropped.  The tea things were cleared away by Mrs. Harding, who then sat down to her sewing. Aunt Rachel continued to knit in grim silence, while Jack seated himself on a three-legged stool near his aunt, and began to whittle out a boat, after a model lent him by Tom Piper, a young gentleman whose aunt has already been referred to.  The cooper took out his spectacles, wiped them carefully with his handkerchief, and as carefully adjusted them to his nose. He then took down from the mantelpiece one of the few books belonging to his library--\"Dr. Kane's Arctic Explorations\"--and began to read, for the tenth time, it might be, the record of these daring explorers.  The plain little room presented a picture of graceful tranquillity, but it proved to be only the calm which preceded the storm.  The storm in question, I regret to say, was brought about by the luckless Jack. As has been said, he was engaged in constructing a boat, the particular operation he was now intent upon being the excavation, or hollowing out. Now three-legged stools are not the most secure seats in the world. This, I think, no one will deny who has any practical acquaintance with them. Jack was working quite vigorously, the block from which the boat was to be fashioned being held firmly between his knees. His knife having got wedged in the wood, he made an unusual effort to draw it out, in which he lost his balance, and disturbed the equilibrium of his stool, which, with its load, tumbled over backward. Now, it very unfortunately happened that Aunt Rachel sat close behind, and the treacherous stool came down with considerable force upon her foot.  A piercing shriek was heard, and Aunt Rachel, lifting her foot, clung to it convulsively, while an expression of pain disturbed her features.  At the sound, the cooper hastily removed his spectacles, and, letting \"Dr. Kane\" fall to the floor, started up in great dismay. Mrs. Harding likewise dropped her sewing, and jumped to her feet in alarm.  It did not take long to see how matters stood.  \"Hurt ye much, Rachel?\" inquired Timothy.  \"It's about killed me,\" groaned the afflicted maiden. \"Oh, I shall have to have my foot cut off, or be a cripple anyway.\" Then, turning upon Jack fiercely: \"You careless, wicked, ungrateful boy, that I've been wearin' myself out knittin' for. I'm almost sure you did it a purpose. You won't be satisfied till you've got me out of the world, and then--then, perhaps\"--here Rachel began to whimper--\"perhaps you'll get Tom Piper's aunt to knit your stockings.\"  \"I didn't mean to, Aunt Rachel,\" said Jack, penitently, eying his aunt, who was rocking to and fro in her chair. \"You know I didn't. Besides, I hurt myself like thunder,\" rubbing himself vigorously.  \"Served you right,\" said his aunt, still clasping her foot.  \"Shan't I get something for you to put on it, Rachel?\" asked Mrs. Harding.  But this Rachel steadily refused, and, after a few more postures indicating a great amount of anguish, limped out of the room, and ascended the stairs to her own apartment.     CHAPTER III  JACK'S NEW PLAN   Aunt Rachel was right in one thing, as Jack realized. He could not find horses to hold every day, and even if he had succeeded in that, few would have paid him so munificently as the stranger of the day before. In fact, matters came to a crisis, and something must be sold to raise funds for immediate necessities."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10729"],["title","Jack's Ward; Or, The Boy Guardian (#2)"],["body"," Now, the only article of luxury--if it could be called so--in the possession of the family was a sofa, in very good preservation, indeed nearly new, for it had been bought only two years before when business was good. A neighbor was willing to pay fifteen dollars for this, and Mrs. Harding, with her husband's consent, agreed to part with it.  \"If ever we are able we will buy another,\" said Timothy.  \"And, at any rate, we can do without it,\" said his wife.  \"Rachel will miss it.\"  \"She said the other day that it was not comfortable, and ought never to have been bought; that it was a shameful waste of money.\"  \"In that case she won't be disturbed by our selling it.\"  \"No, I should think not; but it's hard to tell how Rachel will take anything.\"  This remark was amply verified.  The sofa was removed while the spinster was out, and without any hint to her of what was going to happen. When she returned, she looked around for it with surprise.  \"Where's the sofy?\" she asked.  \"We've sold it to Mrs. Stoddard,\" said Mrs. Harding, cheerfully.  \"Sold it!\" echoed Rachel, dolefully.  \"Yes; we felt that we didn't need it, and we did need money. She offered me fifteen dollars for it, and I accepted.\"  Rachel sat down in a rocking-chair, and began straightway to show signs of great depression of spirits.  \"Life's full of disappointments!\" she groaned. \"Our paths is continually beset by 'em. There's that sofa. It's so pleasant to have one in the house when a body's sick. But, there, it's gone, and if I happen to get down, as most likely I shall, for I've got a bad feeling in my stummick this very minute, I shall have to go upstairs, and most likely catch my death of cold, and that will be the end of me.\"  \"Not so bad as that, I hope,\" said Mrs. Harding, cheerfully. \"You know when you was sick last, you didn't want to use the sofa; you said it didn't lay comfortable. Besides, I hope before you are sick we may be able to buy it back again.\"  Aunt Rachel shook her head despondingly.  \"There ain't any use in hoping that,\" she said. \"Timothy's got so much behindhand that he won't be able to get up again; I know he won't!\"  \"But, if he only manages to find steady work soon, he will.\"  \"No, he won't,\" said Rachel, positively. \"I'm sure he won't. There won't be any work before spring, and most likely not then.\"  \"You are too desponding, Aunt Rachel.\"  \"Enough to make me so. If you had only taken my advice, we shouldn't have come to this.\"  \"I don't know what advice you refer to, Rachel,\" said Mrs. Harding, patiently.  \"No, I don't expect you do. My words don't make no impression. You didn't pay no attention to what I said, that's the reason.\"  \"But if you'll repeat the advice, Rachel, perhaps we can still profit by it,\" answered Mrs. Harding, with imperturbable good humor.  \"I told you you ought to be layin' up something agin' a rainy day. But that's always the way. Folks think when times is good it's always a-goin' to be so, but I know better.\"  \"I don't see how we could have been much more economical,\" said Mrs. Harding, mildly.  \"There's a hundred ways. Poor folks like us ought not to expect to have meat so often. It's frightful to think what the butcher's bill must have been for the last two months.\"  Inconsistent Rachel! Only the day before she had made herself very uncomfortable because there was no meat for dinner, and said she couldn't live without it. Mrs. Harding might have reminded her of this, but the good woman was too kind and forbearing to make the retort. She really pitied Rachel for her unhappy habit of despondency. So she contented herself by saying that they must try to do better in future.  \"That's always the way,\" muttered Rachel; \"shut the stable door after the horse is stolen. Folks never learn from experience till it's too late to be of any use. I don't see what the world was made for, for my part. Everything goes topsy-turvy, and all sorts of ways except the right way. I sometimes think 'tain't much use livin'!\"  \"Oh, you'll feel better by and by, Rachel.\"  \"No, I shan't; I feel my health's declinin' every day. I don't know how I can stand it when I have to go to the poorhouse.\"  \"We haven't gone there yet, Rachel.\"  \"No, but it's comin' soon. We can't live on nothin'.\"  \"Hark, there's Jack coming,\" said his mother, hearing a quick step outside.  \"Yes, he's whistlin' just as if nothin' was the matter. He don't care anything for the awful condition of the family.\"  \"You're wrong there, Rachel; Jack is trying every day to get something to do. He wants to do his part.\"  Rachel would have made a reply disparaging to Jack, but she had no chance, for our hero broke in at this instant.  \"Well, Jack?\" said his mother, inquiringly.  \"I've got a plan, mother,\" he said.  \"What's a boy's plan worth?\" sniffed Aunt Rachel.  \"Oh, don't be always hectorin' me, Aunt Rachel,\" said Jack, impatiently.  \"Hectorin'! Is that the way my own nephew talks to me?\"  \"Well, it's so. You don't give a feller a chance. I'll tell you what I'm thinking of, mother. I've been talkin' with Tom Blake; he sells papers, and he tells me he makes sometimes a dollar a day. Isn't that good?\"  \"Yes, that is very good wages for a boy.\"  \"I want to try it, too; but I've got to buy the papers first, you know, and I haven't got any money. So, if you'll lend me fifty cents, I'll try it this afternoon.\"  \"You think you can sell them, Jack?\"  \"I know I can. I'm as smart as Tom Blake, any day.\"  \"Pride goes before a fall!\" remarked Rachel, by way of a damper. \"Disappointment is the common lot.\"  \"That's just the way all the time,\" said Jack, provoked.  \"I've lived longer than you,\" began Aunt Rachel.  \"Yes, a mighty lot longer,\" interrupted Jack. \"I don't deny that.\"  \"Now you're sneerin' at me on account of my age, Jack. Martha, how can you allow such things?\"  \"Be respectful, Jack.\"  \"Then tell Aunt Rachel not to aggravate me so. Will you let me have the fifty cents, mother?\"  \"Yes, Jack. I think your plan is worth trying.\"  She took out half a dollar from her pocketbook and handed it to Jack.  \"All right, mother. I'll see what I can do with it.\"  Jack went out, and Rachel looked more gloomy than ever.  \"You'll never see that money again, you may depend on't, Martha,\" she said.  \"Why not, Rachel?\"  \"Because Jack'll spend it for candy, or in some other foolish way.\"  \"You are unjust, Rachel. Jack is not that kind of boy.\"  \"I'd ought to know him. I've had chances enough.\"  \"You never knew him to do anything dishonest.\"  \"I suppose he's a model boy?\"  \"No, he isn't. He's got faults enough, I admit; but he wouldn't spend for his own pleasure money given him for buying papers.\"  \"If he buys the papers, I don't believe he can sell them, so the money's wasted anyway,\" said Rachel, trying another tack.  \"We will wait and see,\" said Mrs. Harding.  She saw that Rachel was in one of her unreasonable moods, and that it was of no use to continue the discussion.     CHAPTER IV  MRS. HARDING TAKES A BOARDER   Jack started for the newspaper offices and bought a supply of papers.  \"I don't see why I can't sell papers as well as other boys,\" he said to himself. \"I'm going to try, at any rate.\"  He thought it prudent, however, not to buy too large stock at first. He might sell them all, but then again he might get \"stuck\" on a part, and this might take away all his profits.  Jack, however, was destined to find that in the newspaper business, as well as in others, there was no lack of competition. He took his place just below the Astor House, and began to cry his papers. This aroused the ire of a rival newsboy a few feet away.  \"Get away from here!\" he exclaimed, scowling at Jack.  \"What for?\" said Jack.  \"This is my stand.\"  \"Keep it, then. This is mine,\" retorted Jack, composedly.  \"I don't allow no other newsboys in this block,\" said the other.  \"Don't you? You ain't the city government, are you?\"  \"I don't want any of your impudence. Clear out!\"  \"Clear out yourself!\"  \"I'll give you a lickin'!\"  \"Perhaps you will when you're able.\"  Jack spoke manfully; but the fact was that the other boy probably was able, being three years older, and as many inches taller.  Jack kept on crying his papers, and his opponent, incensed at the contemptuous disregard of his threats, advanced toward him, and, taking Jack unawares, pushed him off the sidewalk with such violence that he nearly fell flat. Jack felt that the time for action had arrived. He dropped his papers temporarily on the sidewalk, and, lowering his head, butted against his young enemy with such force as to double him up, and seat him, gasping for breath, on the sidewalk. Tom Rafferty, for this was his name, looked up in astonishment at the unexpected form of the attack.  \"Well done, my lad!\" said a hearty voice.  Jack turned toward the speaker, and saw a stout man dressed in a blue coat with brass buttons. He was dark and bronzed with exposure to the weather, and there was something about him which plainly indicated the sailor.  \"Well done, my lad!\" he repeated. \"You know how to pay off your debts.\"  \"I try to,\" said Jack, modestly. \"But where's my papers?\"  The papers, which he had dropped, had disappeared. One of the boys who had seen the fracas had seized the opportunity to make off with them, and poor Jack was in the position of a merchant who had lost his stock in trade.  \"Who took them papers?\" he asked, looking about him.  \"I saw a boy run off with them,\" said a bystander.  \"I'm glad of it,\" said Tom Rafferty, sullenly.  Jack looked as if he was ready to pitch into him again, but the sailor interfered.  \"Don't mind the papers, my lad. What were they worth?\"  \"I gave twenty cents for 'em.\"  \"Then here's thirty.\"  \"I don't think I ought to take it,\" said Jack. \"It's my loss.\"  \"Take it, my boy. It won't ruin me. I've got plenty more behind.\"  \"Thank you, sir; I'll go and buy some more papers.\"  \"Not to-night. I want you to take a cruise with me.\"  \"All right, sir.\"  \"I suppose you'd like to know who I am?\" said the"]]]
