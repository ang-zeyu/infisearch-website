None of these, however, had been effective and the encounter of that day was the first chance Jack had had to work off any of his rancor on Rob Blake's patrol.  Young Blake was the only son of Mr. Albert Blake, the president of the local bank.  His corporal, Merritt Crawford, was the eldest of the numerous family of Jared Crawford, the blacksmith and wheelwright of the little town, and Tubby Hopkins was the offspring of Mrs. Hopkins--a widow in comfortable circumstances. The other lads of the Patrol whom we shall meet as the story of their doings and adventures progresses were all natives of the town, which was situated on the south shore of Long Island--as has been said--and on an inlet which led out to the Atlantic itself.  The scouts trudged back into Hampton just at twilight and made their way at once to their armory--as they called it--which was situated In a large room above the bank of which Rob's father was president.  At one side of it was a row of lockers and each lad--after changing his uniform for street clothes--placed his \"regimentals\" in these receptacles.  This done the lads broke up and started for their various homes. Rob and his young corporal left the armory together, after locking the door and descending the stairs which led onto a side street.  \"I wonder if that fellow Curtiss means to carry out his threat of getting even?\" said Crawford as they made their way down the street arm in arm, for their homes were not far apart and both on Main Street.  \"He's mean enough to attempt anything,\" rejoined Rob, \"but I don't think he's got nerve enough to carry out any of his schemes.  Hullo!\" he broke off suddenly, \"there he is now across the street by the post office, talking to Bill Bender and Sam Redding.  I'll bet they are hatching up some sort of mischief. Just look at them looking at us. I'll bet a doughnut they were talking about us.\"  \"Shouldn't wonder,\" agreed his companion.  \"By the way, I've got to go and see if there is any mail.  Come on over.\"  The two lads crossed the street and as they entered the post office, although neither of them had much use for either of the bullies' two chums, they nodded to them pleasantly.  \"You kids think you're pretty fine with your Eagle Patrol or whatever you call it, don't you,\" sneered Bill Bender, as they walked by.  \"I'll bet the smell of a little real powder would make your whole regiment run to cover.\"  \"Don't pay any attention to him,\" whispered the young corporal to Rob, who doubled up his fists and flushed angrily at the sneering tone Jack Curtiss' friend had adopted.  Rob restrained his anger with an effort, and by the time they emerged from the post office the trio of worthies--who, as Rob had rightly guessed, had been discussing them--had moved on up the street.  \"I had trouble with those kids myself this afternoon,\" remarked Jack Curtiss with a scowl, as they wended their way toward a shed in the rear of Bill Bender's home, which had been fitted tip as a sort of clubroom.  \"What did they do to you?\" incautiously inquired Sam Redding, a youth as big as the other two, but not so powerful.  In fact he was used more or less as a tool by them.  \"Do to me,\" roared the bully, \"what did I do to them, you mean.\"  \"Well what did you do to them then?\" asked Bill Bender, as they entered the clubroom before referred to and he produced some cigarettes, which all three had been strictly forbidden to smoke.  \"Chased them off my land,\" rejoined the other, lighting a paper roll and blowing out a cloud of smoke, \"you should have seen them run.  If they want to play their fool games they've got to do it on the property of folks who'll let them.  They can't come on my land.\"  \"You mean your father's, don't you?\" put in the unlucky Sam Redding.  \"Sam, you've got a head like a billiard ball,\" retorted the bully, turning on the other, \"it'll be mine some day, won't it? Therefore it's as good as mine now.\"  Although he didn't quite see the logic of the foregoing, Sam Redding gave a sage nod and agreed that his leader was right.  \"Yes, those kids need a good lesson from somebody,\" chimed in Bill Bender.  \"I think we had better be the 'somebodies' to give it to them,\" rejoined Jack Curtiss.  \"They are getting insufferable.  They actually twitted me this afternoon with being sore at them because I didn't get my patrol--as if I really wanted one.  That Blake kid is the worst of the bunch.  Just because his father has a little money he gives himself all kinds of airs.  My father is as rich as his, even if he isn't a banker.\"  \"I've been thinking of a good trick we can put up on them, but it will take some nerve to carry it out,\" announced Bill Bender, after some more discussion of the lads of the Eagle Patrol.  \"Out with it, then,\" urged the bully, \"what is it?\"  In a lowered tone Bill Bender sketched out his scheme in detail, while Jack and Sam nodded their approval.  At length he ceased talking and the other two broke out into a delighted laugh, in which malice as much as merriment prevailed.  \"It's the very thing,\" exclaimed Jack.  \"Bill, you're a genius. We'll do it as soon as possible.  If that doesn't take some starch out of those tin soldiers nothing will.\"  Half an hour later the three cronies parted for the night.  Sam went to his home near the waterfront, for his father was a boat builder, and Jack started to walk the three miles to his father's farm in the moonlight.  His way took him by the bank.  As he passed it he gazed up at the windows of the armory on which was lettered in gilt: \"Eagle Patrol of the Boy Scouts of America.\"  \"That's a slick idea of Bill's,\" said the bully to himself, \"I can hardly wait till we get a chance to carry it out.\"     CHAPTER II  A CRUISE TO THE ISLAND   \"Whatever are you doing, Rob?\"  It was the morning after the consultation of Jack Curtiss and his cronies, and Corporal Crawford was looking over the fence into his leader's yard.  Rob was bending over a curious-looking apparatus, consisting of a bent stick held in a bow-shape by a taut leather thong.  The appliance was twisted about an upright piece of wood sharpened at one end--which was rotated as the lad ran the bow back and forth across it.  Presently smoke began to rise from the flat piece of timber into which the point of the upright stick had been boring and depositing sawdust, and Rob, by industriously blowing at the accumulation, presently caused it to burst into flame.  \"There I've done it,\" he exclaimed triumphantly, arising with a flushed face from his labors.  \"Done what?\" inquired young Crawford interestedly.  \"Made fire in the Indian way,\" replied Rob triumphantly.  \"I thought they made it by rubbing two sticks together.\"  \"Only book Indians do that,\" replied Rob, \"I'll tell you it took me a time to get the hang of it, but I've got it now.\"  \"It's quite a stunt, all right,\" commented the corporal admiringly.  \"You bet, and it's useful, too,\" replied Rob.  \"I'll put the bow and drill in my pocket, and then any time we get stuck for matches we'll have no trouble in making a signal smoke or lighting cooking fires.\"  \"Say, I've got some news for you,\" went on young Crawford, \"did you know that Sam Redding has entered that freak motor boat he's been building in the yacht club regatta?  He's out for the club trophy.\"  \"No, is he, though?\" exclaimed Rob, keenly interested.  \"Then the crew and skipper of the Flying Fish will have to look alive. I know that Sam's father helped him out with that boat and put a lot of new wrinkles in it.  I didn't think, though, he'd have it ready in time for the races.\"  The boys referred to the coming motor-boat races which were to take place shortly on the inlet at Hampton.  Like most of the other lads in the seashore town, Merritt and Rob had a lot of experience on the water and some time before had built a speedy motor boat from knock-down frames.  The Flying Fish, as they called her, was entered for the main event referred to, the prize for which was a silver cup, donated by the merchants of the town.  There were several other entries in the race, but Rob and his crew, consisting of Merritt and Tubby Hopkins, confidently expected the Flying Fish to easily lead them all.  \"I wonder if the Sam Redding can show her stern to the Flying Fish?\" mused Rob.  \"I'd like to lake a good look at her.\"  \"Let's go down to Redding's boat yard,\" suggested Merritt; \"she's lying there on the ways.  I don't suppose any one would object to our sizing her up.\"  Rob hailed the suggestion as a good one.  \"We can call in for Tubby on the way,\" he said, as he darted into the house after his hat.  The boys dropped in at Tubby's house on their way to the water-front, and received from the stout youth some additional details regarding Sam's boat.  \"She's a hydroplane,\" volunteered Tubby, \"and Tom Jennings, down at the yard, says she's as fast as a race horse.\"  \"A hydroplane?--that's one of those craft that cut along the top of the water like a skimming dish, isn't it?\" asked Merritt.  \"That's the idea,\" responded Rob.  \"They're supposed to be as speedy as anything afloat in smooth water.\"  Thus conversing they reached the boat-building yard of Sam Redding's father and were greeted by Tom Jennings, a big good-natured ship carpenter.  \"Hullo, Tom!  Can we see that new boat of Sam's?\" inquired Rob.  \"Sure, I guess there's no objection,\" grinned Tom, \"come right this way.  There she is, over there by that big winch.\"  Report had not erred apparently as to the novel qualities of Sam Redding's speed craft.  She was about twenty-five feet long, narrow and painted black.  She was perfectly flat-bottomed, her underside being deeply notched at frequent intervals.  On the edge of those notches she was supposed to glide over the water when driven at top speed.  \"She certainly looks like a winner,\" commented Rob, as he gazed at her"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12112"],["title","The Boy Scouts of the Eagle Patrol (#2)"],["body","n, slender lines and sharp bow.  \"She's got wonderful speed,\" Tom Jennings confided.  \"We tried her out the other night when no one was around.  But I don't think that in rough water she'll be much good.\"  \"No, I'd prefer the Flying Fish for the waters hereabouts,\" agreed Rob, \"it's liable to come on rough in a hurry and then a chap who was out in a dry-goods box, like that thing, would be in trouble.\"  \"What are you calling a dry-goods box?\" demanded an indignant voice behind them, and turning, the lads saw Sam Redding with a menacing look on his face.  A little way behind him stood Bill Bender and Jack Curtiss.  \"Oh, I beg your pardon, Sam,\" said Rob.  \"I really admire your hydroplane very much, and I think it will give us a tussle for the trophy, all right; but I don't think she'd be much good in any kind of a sea-way.\"  \"That's my business, you interfering little runt,\" snapped Sam, who, with Bill Bender and Jack Curtiss to back him, felt very brave; though ordinarily he would have avoided trouble with the young scouts.  \"What are you doing spying around the yard here, anyhow?\" he went on insolently.  \"We are not spying,\" indignantly burst out Merritt.  \"We asked Tom Jennings if we couldn't look at your hydroplane, as we were naturally interested in her, and he gave us permission.\"  \"Well, he had no business to,\" growled Sam; \"he ought to be attending to his work instead of showing a lot of nosy young cubs my new boat.\"  \"They are capable of stealing your ideas,\" chimed in Jack Curtiss, \"and putting them on their own boat.\"  \"That's ridiculous,\" laughed Rob, \"as I said I wouldn't want to have anything to do with such a contrivance except on a lake or a river.\"  \"Well, you keep your advice and your ideas to yourself, and get out of this yard!\" roared Sam, waxing bolder and bolder, and mistaking Rob's conciliatory manner for cowardice.  \"I've a good mind to punch your head.\"  \"Better come on and try it,\" retorted Rob, preparing for the immediate onslaught which it seemed reasonable from Sam's manner to expect.  But it didn't come.  Muttering something about \"young cubs,\" and \"keeping the boat-yard gate locked,\" Sam turned to his chums and invited them to come and try out his new motor in the shop.  As the three chums had no desire to \"mix it up with Sam on his own place,\" as Tubby put it, they left the yard promptly, and walked on down the water-front to the wharf at which lay the Flying Fish, the fastest craft in the Hampton Motor Boat Club. Rob's boat was, to tell the truth, rather broad of beam for a racer and drew quite a little water.  She had a powerful motor and clean lines, however, and while not primarily designed solely for \"mug-hunting,\" had beaten everything she had raced with during the few months since the boys had completed her.  The money for her motor had been given to Rob by his father, who was quite indulgent to Rob in money matters, having noticed that the lad always expended the sums given him wisely.  \"Let's take a spin,\" suddenly suggested Tubby.  \"Nothing to prevent us,\" answered Rob; \"we've got plenty of time before dinner. Come on, boys.\"  The lads were soon on board and examining the gasoline tank, to see how much fuel they had on hand, and oiling up the engine. The fuel receptacle proved to be almost full, so after filling the lubricant cups and attending to the batteries, they started up the engine--a powerful, three cylindered, twelve-horse affair capable of driving the twenty-two foot Flying Fish through the water at twelve miles an hour or better.  Just as Rob was casting off the head-line there came a hail from the wharf above them.  \"Ahoy, there, shipmates!  Where are yer bound fer this fine, sunny day?\"  The lads looked up to see the weather-beaten countenance of Captain Job Hudgins, one of the characters of the vicinity.  He was a former whaler, and lived on a small island some distance from Hampton.  On his little territory he fished and grew a few vegetables, \"trading in\" his produce at the Hampton grocery stores for his simple wants.  He, however, had a pension, and was supposed to have a \"snug little fortune\" laid by.  His only companion in his island solitude was it big Newfoundland dog named \"Skipper.\"  The animal stood beside its master on the dock and wagged its tail at the sight of the boys, whom it knew quite well from their frequent visits to the captain's little island.  \"Hullo, captain!\" shouted Rob, as the veteran saluted his three young friends.   \"Where's your boat?\"  \"Oh, her engine went--busted, and I had to leave her at the yard below fer repairs,\" explained the captain.  \"I wonder if yer boys can give me a lift back if yer goin' near Topsail Island?\"  \"Surest thing you know,\" rejoined Rob hastily.  \"Come right aboard. But how are you going to get off your island again if your motor is laid up here to be fixed?\"  \"Oh, I'll use my rowboat,\" responded the old mariner, clambering down into the Flying Fish.  \"Say, this is quite a right smart contraption, ain't she?\"  \"We think she is a pretty good little boat,\" modestly replied Rob, taking his place at the wheel.  \"Now, then, Merritt, start up that engine.\"  \"Hold on a minute!\" shouted Tubby.  \"We forgot the dog.\"  Sure enough, Skipper was dashing up and down the wharf in great distress at the prospect of being deserted.  \"Put yer boat alongside that landin' stage at the end of the wharf,\" suggested his master.  \"Skipper can get aboard from there, I reckon.\"  Rob steered the Flying Fish round to the floating landing, to which an inclined runway led from the wharf.  Skipper dashed down it as soon as he saw what was happening, and was waiting, ready to embark, when the Flying Fish came alongside.  \"Poor old Skipper, I reckon yer thought we was goin' ter maroon yer,\" said Captain Job, as the animal jumped on board with a bark of \"thanks\" for his rescue.  \"I tell yer, boys, I wouldn't lose that dog fer all the money in Rob's father's bank.  He keeps good watch out an the Island, I'll tell yer.\"  \"I didn't think any one much came there, except us,\" said Rob, as the Flying Fish headed away from the wharf and began to cut through the waters of the inlet.  \"Oh, yes; there's others,\" responded the old man.  \"That Jack Curtiss lad and his two chums are out there quite often.\"  \"Bill Bender and Sam Redding, I suppose you mean,\" said Tubby.  \"Those their names?\" asked the captain.  \"Well, I don't know any good uv any uv 'em.  Old Skipper here chased 'em away from my melon patch the other day.  I reckon they thought Old Scratch was after them, the way they run; but they got away with some melons, just the same.\"  The old man laughed aloud at the recollection of the marauders' precipitous flight.  That Jack Curtiss and his two cronies had made a rendezvous of the island was news to the boys, and not agreeable news, either. They had been planning a patrol camp there later on in the summer, and the bully and his two chums were not regarded by them as desirable neighbors. However, they said nothing, as they could not claim sole right to use the island, which was property that had been so long in litigation that It had come to be known as \"No Man's Land\" as well as by its proper name.  The captain was only a squatter there, but no one cared to disturb him, and he had led the existence of a semi-hermit there for many years.  The Flying Fish rapidly covered the calm waters of the inlet and was soon dancing over the swells outside.  \"I'm going to let her out a bit,\" said Rob suddenly; \"look out for spray.\"  \"Spray don't bother a brine-pickled old salt like me,\" laughed the captain.  \"Let her go.\"  The Flying Fish seemed fairly to leap forward as Merritt gave her the full power of her engine.  As Rob had said, it did indeed behoove her occupants to look out for spray.  The sparkling spume came flying back in sheets as she cut through the waves, but the boys didn't mind that any more than did their weather-beaten companion.  As for Skipper, he barked aloud in sheer joy as the Flying Fish slid along as if she were trying to live up to her name to her utmost ability.  \"This is a good little sea boat,\" remarked the captain, as they plunged onward.  \"She's as seaworthy as she is speedy, I guess.\"  \"She'll stand a lot of knocking about, and that's a fact,\" agreed Rob.  \"Well,\" remarked the old man, gazing about him, \"it's a good thing that she is, fer, if I'm not mistaken--and I'm not often off as regards the weather--we are goin' ter have quite a little blow before yer boys get back home.\"  \"A storm?\" asked Tubby, somewhat alarmed.  \"Oh, no; not what yer might call a storm,\" laughed the captain; \"but just what we used to term a 'capful uv wind.'\"  \"Well, so long as it isn't a really bad blow, it won't trouble the Flying Fish,\" Rob assured him.  \"Hullo!\" exclaimed the old man suddenly.  \"What queer kind uv craft is that?\"  He pointed back to the mouth of the now distant inlet, from which a curious-looking black craft was emerging at what seemed to be great speed.  \"It's that hydroplane of Sam Redding's, for a bet!\" cried Rob. \"Here, Tubby, take the wheel a minute, while I put the glasses on her.\"  The lad stood up in the heaving motor craft, steadying himself against the bulwarks by his knees, and peered through his marine-glasses.  \"It's the hydroplane, sure enough,\" he said.  \"By ginger, but she can go, all right!  Sam and Jack and Bill are all in her.  They seem to be heading right out to sea, too.\"  \"Say!\" exclaimed Tubby suddenly, \"if it comes on to blow, as the captain said it would, they'll be in a bad fix, won't they?\"  \"In that ther shoe-box thing,\" scornfully exclaimed the old captain, who had also been looking through the glasses, \"why, I wouldn't give a confederate dollar bill with a hole in it fer their lives.\"     CHAPTER III  BOY SCOUTS TO THE RESCUE   \"Hadn't we better put back and warn them?\" suggested Merritt rather anxiously, for he was alarmed by the confident manner in which the old seaman prophesied certain"]]]
