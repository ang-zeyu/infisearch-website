What, they asked, would befall the live stock they had abandoned, the ducks on the pond, the cattle in the field? Who would feed them and give them water? At the question the tears would break out afresh. Heart-broken, weary, hungry, they passed in an unending caravan. With them, all fleeing from the same foe, all moving in one direction, were family carriages, the servants on the box in disordered livery, as they had served dinner, or coatless, but still in the striped waistcoats and silver buttons of grooms or footmen, and bicyclers with bundles strapped to their shoulders, and men and women stumbling on foot, carrying their children. Above it all rose the breathless scream of the racing-cars, as they rocked and skidded, with brakes grinding and mufflers open; with their own terror creating and spreading terror.  Though eager in sympathy, the people of Brussels themselves were undisturbed. Many still sat at the little iron tables and smiled pityingly upon the strange figures of the peasants. They had had their trouble for nothing, they said. It was a false alarm. There were no Germans nearer than Liege. And, besides, should the Germans come, the civil guard would meet them.  But, better informed than they, that morning the American minister, Brand Whitlock, and the Marquis Villalobar, the Spanish minister, had called upon the burgomaster and advised him not to defend the city. As Whitlock pointed out, with the force at his command, which was the citizen soldiery, he could delay the entrance of the Germans by only an hour, and in that hour many innocent lives would be wasted and monuments of great beauty, works of art that belong not alone to Brussels but to the world, would be destroyed. Burgomaster Max, who is a splendid and worthy representative of a long line of burgomasters, placing his hand upon his heart, said: \"Honor requires it.\"  To show that in the protection of the Belgian Government he had full confidence, Mr. Whitlock had not as yet shown his colors. But that morning when he left the Hôtel de Ville he hung the American flag over his legation and over that of the British. Those of us who had elected to remain in Brussels moved our belongings to a hotel across the street from the legation. Not taking any chances, for my own use I reserved a green leather sofa in the legation itself.  Except that the cafés were empty of Belgian officers, and of English correspondents, whom, had they remained, the Germans would have arrested, there was not, up to late in the afternoon of the 19th of August, in the life and conduct of the citizens any perceptible change. They could not have shown a finer spirit. They did not know the city would not be defended; and yet with before them on the morrow the prospect of a battle which Burgomaster Max had announced would be contested to the very heart of the city, as usual the cafés blazed like open fire-places and the people sat at the little iron tables. Even when, like great buzzards, two German aeroplanes sailed slowly across Brussels, casting shadows of events to come, the people regarded them only with curiosity. The next morning the shops were open, the streets were crowded. But overnight the soldier-king had sent word that Brussels must not oppose the invaders; and at the gendarmerie the civil guard, reluctantly and protesting, some even in tears, turned in their rifles and uniforms.  The change came at ten in the morning. It was as though a wand had waved and from a fête-day on the Continent we had been wafted to London on a rainy Sunday. The boulevards fell suddenly empty. There was not a house that was not closely shuttered. Along the route by which we now knew the Germans were advancing, it was as though the plague stalked. That no one should fire from a window, that to the conquerors no one should offer insult, Burgomaster Max sent out as special constables men he trusted. Their badge of authority was a walking-stick and a piece of paper fluttering from a buttonhole. These, the police, and the servants and caretakers of the houses that lined the boulevards alone were visible. At eleven o'clock, unobserved but by this official audience, down the Boulevard Waterloo came the advance-guard of the German army. It consisted of three men, a captain and two privates on bicycles. Their rifles were slung across their shoulders, they rode unwarily, with as little concern as the members of a touring-club out for a holiday. Behind them, so close upon each other that to cross from one sidewalk to the other was not possible, came the Uhlans, infantry, and the guns. For two hours I watched them, and then, bored with the monotony of it, returned to the hotel. After an hour, from beneath my window, I still could hear them; another hour and another went by. They still were passing.  Boredom gave way to wonder. The thing fascinated you, against your will, dragged you back to the sidewalk and held you there open-eyed. No longer was it regiments of men marching, but something uncanny, inhuman, a force of nature like a landslide, a tidal wave, or lava sweeping down a mountain. It was not of this earth, but mysterious, ghostlike. It carried all the mystery and menace of a fog rolling toward you across the sea. The uniform aided this impression. In it each man moved under a cloak of invisibility. Only after the most numerous and severe tests at all distances, with all materials and combinations of colors that give forth no color, could this gray have been discovered. That it was selected to clothe and disguise the German when he fights is typical of the General Staff, in striving for efficiency, to leave nothing to chance, to neglect no detail.  After you have seen this service uniform under conditions entirely opposite you are convinced that for the German soldier it is one of his strongest weapons. Even the most expert marksman cannot hit a target he cannot see. It is not the blue-gray of our Confederates, but a green-gray. It is the gray of the hour just before daybreak, the gray of unpolished steel, of mist among green trees.  I saw it first in the Grand Place in front of the Hôtel de Ville. It was impossible to tell if in that noble square there was a regiment or a brigade. You saw only a fog that melted into the stones, blended with the ancient house fronts, that shifted and drifted, but left you nothing at which to point.  Later, as the army passed under the trees of the Botanical Park, it merged and was lost against the green leaves. It is no exaggeration to say that at a few hundred yards you can see the horses on which the Uhlans ride but cannot see the men who ride them.  If I appear to overemphasize this disguising uniform it is because, of all the details of the German outfit, it appealed to me as one of the most remarkable. When I was near Namur with the rear-guard of the French Dragoons and Cuirassiers, and they threw out pickets, we could distinguish them against the yellow wheat or green corse at half a mile, while these men passing in the street, when they have reached the next crossing, become merged into the gray of the paving-stones and the earth swallowed them. In comparison the yellow khaki of our own American army is about as invisible as the flag of Spain.  Major-General von Jarotsky, the German military governor of Brussels, had assured Burgomaster Max that the German army would not occupy the city but would pass through it. He told the truth. For three days and three nights it passed. In six campaigns I have followed other armies, but, excepting not even our own, the Japanese, or the British, I have not seen one so thoroughly equipped. I am not speaking of the fighting qualities of any army, only of the equipment and organization. The German army moved into Brussels as smoothly and as compactly as an Empire State express. There were no halts, no open places, no stragglers. For the gray automobiles and the gray motorcycles bearing messengers one side of the street always was kept clear; and so compact was the column, so rigid the vigilance of the file-closers, that at the rate of forty miles an hour a car could race the length of the column and need not for a single horse or man once swerve from its course.  All through the night, like the tumult of a river when it races between the cliffs of a canyon, in my sleep I could hear the steady roar of the passing army. And when early in the morning I went to the window the chain of steel was still unbroken. It was like the torrent that swept down the Connemaugh Valley and destroyed Johnstown. As a correspondent I have seen all the great armies and the military processions at the coronations in Russia, England, and Spain, and our own inaugural parades down Pennsylvania Avenue, but those armies and processions were made up of men. This was a machine, endless, tireless, with the delicate organization of a watch and the brute power of a steam roller. And for three days and three nights through Brussels it roared and rumbled, a cataract of molten lead. The infantry marched singing, with their iron-shod boots beating out the time. They sang \"Fatherland, My Fatherland.\" Between each line of song they took three steps. At times two thousand men were singing together in absolute rhythm and beat. It was like the blows from giant pile-drivers. When the melody gave way the silence was broken only by the stamp of iron-shod boots, and then again the song rose. When the singing ceased the bands played marches. They were followed by the rumble of the howitzers, the creaking of wheels and of chains clanking against the cobblestones, and the sharp, bell- like voices of the bugles.  More Uhlans followed, the hoofs of their magnificent horses ringing like thousands of steel hammers breaking stones in a road; and after them the giant siege-guns rumbling, growling, the mitrailleuse with drag-chains ringing, the field-pieces with creaking axles, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11748"],["title","French Conversation and Composition (#1)"],["body","The woman's books, the young   homme, de l'élève, des enfants,     man's, the pupil's, etc.   des petites filles.

PITIÉ TOUCHANTE  C'était pendant la guerre de Crimée. Un soir de combat, deux blessés gisaient côte à côte sur le champ de bataille. La nuit tomba, et le froid terrible qui sévissait augmenta encore leurs souffrances. Ils essayèrent d'échanger quelques paroles, mais ils ne se comprirent pas, car l'un était un Français et l'autre était un Russe. Le sommeil vint enfin clore leurs yeux. Hélas! ceux du Français ne devaient plus voir le jour.  Le matin, en s'éveillant, le Russe vit sur lui un manteau qui ne lui appartenait pas. Son voisin ne bougeait plus. Ce généreux adversaire, sentant approcher la mort, avait jeté sur son compagnon d'infortune un vêtement qui désormais lui était inutile. Il avait ainsi mis en pratique cette maxime: Soyons bons, même envers nos ennemis.--(D'après BERSOT.)

Un jour il reçoit une lettre où, avec les compliments les plus flatteurs sur son talent, on le priait d'envoyer sa recette.  Le grand homme se rend avec joie à cette demande, et remercie l'auteur de la lettre de la bonne opinion qu'il a de lui; puis, saisi tout à coup de méfiance, il ajoute: j'espère cependant que votre demande n'est pas une ruse pour vous procurer mon autographe.   Quel don notre homme avait-il?--S'en faisait-il fort?--Le bruit de son talent s'est-il répandu?--Quelle demande ce monsieur a-t-il reçue un jour?--S'y est-it rendu?--De quelle arrière-pensée a-t-il été tout à coup saisi?   7. AUGUSTE ET LE VÉTÉRAN  Le succès de nos affaires dépend souvent de notre présence d'esprit.  Un vieux soldat d'Auguste, qui s'était distingué par sa bravoure et ses actions d'éclat, fut cité en justice sur une fausse accusation. Il craignait d'être condamné, car son adversaire était un grand officier de la cour. En cette conjoncture difficile, il pria l'empereur lui-même de prendre en main sa défense. Auguste appela un de ses courtisans et lui dit: \"Je te recommande de faire ton possible pour faire acquitter ce brave homme. Et toi, continua-t-il en s'adressant au vétéran, va en paix: tes affaires sont en bonnes mains, ta cause triomphera.--Mon puissant empereur, répliqua le soldat, quand votre pouvoir fut menacé à la bataille d'Actium, je n'ai point chargé un autre du soin de votre défense. J'ai combattu moi-même, exposant ma vie pour sauver vos jours. Voyez ces cicatrices! Ces traces ineffaçables prouvent avec quel dévouement je vous ai servi!\" En même temps il découvrit sa poitrine pour montrer les blessures qu'il avait reçues. Cet appel hardi à de vieux souvenirs valut au vétéran la protection efficace de l'empereur qui lui fit gagner sa cause.   De quoi dépend quelquefois le succès de nos affaires?--Comment le vieux soldat s'était-il distingué?--Qu'est-ce qui lui est arrivé un jour?--Quel était son adversaire?--Quelle prière a-t-il adressée à l'empereur?--Entre les mains de qui l'empereur voulait-il laisser l'affaire?--Comment a-t-il voulu rassurer le soldat?--Mais qu'est-ce que celui-ci a trouvé à redire à cela?--Quelles preuves a-t-il montrées de son dévouement?--Qu'est-ce que son appel lui a valu?

LE MÉDECIN ET SA MULE  Un Esculape, monté sur sa mule, allait voir un malade qui avait un apostème dans le larynx. Notre docteur rencontre une connaissance à la porte même de son client. Il quitte les étriers pour causer plus à son aise, et laisse sa monture qui, trouvant la porte ouverte, pénètre toute seule dans la maison. La chambre du malade était au niveau du sol. La mule, d'un pas délibéré, et toute enharnachée, pénètre dans l'appartement où le pauvre diable était couché. Celui-ci, qui entend du bruit, s'imagine que c'est le docteur, et avance son pouls sans se retourner. La mule, qui voit un bras tendu devant elle sans savoir pourquoi, saisit le poignet avec les dents. Le malade, épouvanté, tourne la tête et saute au bas du lit pour chasser l'animal; puis il est pris d'un tel accès de rire, que l'apostème en crève.  Le docteur, qui survient, veut flapper la mule à coups de cravache. Mais le malade s'écrie: \"Arrêtez, monsieur le docteur! il y a de quoi être émerveillé de l'aventure: votre mule a guéri le mal dont toute votre science ne pouvait venir à bout. Désormais, s'il m'arrivait de retomber dans ce piteux état, envoyez-moi votre mule, et restez en paix chez vous.\"   Le médecin où allait-il?--Allait-il à pied?--De quoi souffrait son client?--Où le médecin s'est-il arrêté en route?--Est-il descendu de sa mule?--Qu'a fait la bête ensuite?--L'entrée de la maison était-elle facile?--Le malade a-t-il entendu entrer quelqu'un?--Qu'a-t-il pensé?--En quelle posture le malade se trouvait-il?--La mule a-t-elle voulu jouer le rôle de médecin?--A-t-elle tâté le pouls du client?--Celui-ci a-t-il été surpris de trouver la mule dans sa chambre?--Quel heureux effet la peur du malade a-t-elle eu?--Quel conseil cet homme a-t-il donné au médecin?  Écrivez cette histoire en 200 mots.  Cherchez un verbe, s'il y en a, pour tous les substantifs dans cette histoire: _e.g._ connaissance: connaître.
