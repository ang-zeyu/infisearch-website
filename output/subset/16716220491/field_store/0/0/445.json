It was just at the end of this conversation that the lads had joined the crowd before the palace, and Chester had made the remark that opens this story.     CHAPTER III.  THE MOB.   Hal sat up and passed his right hand gently over his head.  \"Quite a bump,\" he muttered to himself. \"What a fool I was not to have been prepared for that ruse. Well, I'll know better next time.\"  The lad pulled himself to his feet and gazed in the direction in which the other had disappeared. He made as if to move after him, and then changed his mind.  \"Not much chance of finding him now, I guess,\" he muttered.  He turned on his heel, and then, for the first time, his eyes fell upon Chester's prostrate form.  \"So he got you, too, eh?\" he said to himself.  He hurried forward and bent over his chum. At the same moment Chester opened his eyes and smiled up at him feebly.  \"Hello,\" he said; \"where's our friend?\"  \"Gone,\" replied Hal briefly, raising Chester's head to his knee. \"How do you feel?\"  \"A little rocky, and that's a fact,\" was the reply.  \"What did he bump you over with--gun?\"  \"No; fist.\"  \"I don't see any marks.\"  \"I feel 'em,\" said Chester, rubbing his chin ruefully. \"He landed an uppercut that was a beauty.\"  \"I am glad you are well enough to appreciate it,\" said Hal, with a slight smile. \"He was big enough to have put you out for keeps.\"  \"I'm not to be gotten rid of so easily,\" returned Chester. \"Help me up.\"  Hal lent a supporting hand and Chester struggled to his feet.  \"Dizzy?\" queried Hal.  \"A little,\" was the reply. \"I'll be all right in a minute, though.\"  He shook his head several times and at last appeared to have gotten rid of the effects of the blow. He threw off Hal's hand.  \"Well, what now?\" he asked.  Hal hesitated.  \"I hate to see that fellow get away,\" he said finally. \"He probably has stolen important information.\"  \"I guess there is not much doubt of that,\" replied Chester, \"but Rome is a pretty sizeable town. A slim chance we have of finding him.\"  \"I'd know him if I see him,\" said Hal  \"So will I. Did you notice the scar across his face?\"  \"Yes; that's why I say I would know him any place. What do you suppose it was he stole?\"  \"A paper of some kind; I saw that. Probably has to do with troop movements or something of the sort. You remember he stole it from an army officer.\"  \"Yes; which reminds me that he also disposed of said army officer without much trouble. The last I saw of him he was floundering about on the ground in the midst of the crowd.\"  \"Let's go back and have a look for him.\"  \"Good; come on.\"  The boys turned and retraced their steps. Rounding a corner they came again within sight of the palace.  \"Crowd still there,\" Hal commented briefly.  It was true. The crowd seemed to have grown rather than to have diminished.  \"Something must have happened while we were gone,\" said Chester. \"Hear them yell.\"  \"I guess it means war,\" was Hal's quiet response. \"Well, I'm glad.\"  \"And so am I. This German business should be settled without much trouble now.\"  \"Don't you believe it. The Kaiser is good for a long, hard fight yet.\"  They pushed their way through the crowd. Suddenly they came to a stop, their further progress being barred by a solid mass of humanity directly in front of them, Hal took Chester by the arm.  \"Let's see what is going on here,\" he said.  By dint of hard pushing and shoving they worked their way gradually through the crowd.  \"As I live, it's our friend the army officer,\" ejaculated Hal.  \"So it is,\" agreed Chester, \"and he seems to be rather excited. Look at him waving his arms about.\"  Surrounded by a curious crowd, the officer referred to was declaiming eloquently. It was plain from the attitude of the crowd, however, that he wasn't making himself plain.  \"He's too excited to talk coherently,\" said Hal. \"Maybe we can help him out a bit. Let's get through the rest of this gang.\"  He put his elbows in front of him, and closely followed by Chester, threw his weight upon the mass of humanity in front. The crowd parted, and the lads pushed their way through, unheeding the protests their rough methods called forth. They stopped beside the still excited officer.  \"Signor--\" began Hal, but the officer paid no attention to him, and continued to wave his arms violently about.  \"You can't get his attention that way,\" said Chester. \"Let me try.\"  He grasped the Italian officer roughly by the arm and whirled him about.  Immediately the latter's arms ceased their violent gesticulations and he turned an angry face upon Chester.  \"How dare you lay your hands upon an officer of the king?\" he demanded in a harsh voice.  His hand dropped to his holster.  \"Here! Here!\" exclaimed Hal. \"Hold your horses now and don't get excited. We've come to tell you something about that paper you lost.\"  \"Ah!\" cried the Italian. \"So you have it, eh? Give it to me!\"  He held out a hand expectantly.  \"No, we haven't it,\" replied Hal, \"but--\"  \"Give me the paper!\" cried the officer, his voice becoming shrill with anger.  \"I tell you we haven't the paper,\" said Hal.  \"That's a lie!\" shouted the Italian. \"You knocked me down and stole the paper.\"  He clutched Hal by the arm.  \"Let go of me,\" said the lad angrily. \"We are trying to help you and--\"  The Italian officer now suddenly drew his revolver, and pointed it squarely at Hal.  \"Give me the paper or I shall shoot,\" he said more quietly.  He staggered suddenly backward and the revolver dropped to the ground with a clatter. The Italian wheeled and confronted the angry face of Chester, who had struck up the weapon.  \"What's the matter with you? Can't you see we are trying to help you?\" demanded Chester.  At this point there came a diversion. Members of the crowd who had witnessed the dispute between the officer and the two lads suddenly set up a cry of \"spies.\"  Others behind them took it up.  \"Spies! Spies!\" a hundred voices rang out.  The crowd surged in about them.  Hal gave one quick look about, and then said quietly to Chester:  \"We are in for it now, old man. We'll have to make a break for it.\"  \"All right,\" said Chester grimly. \"Lead the way.\"  Once more the Italian officer stretched forth a detaining hand, but this time Hal wasted no time in explanation. He struck out straight from the shoulder, and the officer toppled to the ground.  \"Second fall for him to-day,\" muttered Hal between his teeth.  He felt Chester's arm press his elbow.  \"Come on,\" he said.  Side by side the lads stepped forward in the very faces of the mob that barred their path, and for a moment the crowd gave back. Then one man, bolder than the rest, sprang forward and sought to clutch Chester's arm. The lad's fist met him half way and he dropped silently to the ground.  An angry roar went up from the crowd.  Chester's hand dropped to his pocket. Hal perceived the motion and cried out:  \"No guns, Chester!\"  Chester realized the soundness of the warning and his revolver remained where it was.  Two of the crowd sprang forward together, but Hal and Chester, with their greater strength and reach, disposed of them easily. A blow from behind landed on Chester's neck and he staggered forward. He recovered himself in a moment, however, and shouted.  \"Rush 'em, Hal!\"  The latter also realized that to stand still and fight gave the crowd behind too great an opening and he obeyed Chester's injunction. At the same moment both sprang forward, and the crowd opened before them.  Straight ahead they went, striking out right and left, but rushing forward as fast as possible all the time. Men fell on both sides of them beneath their heavy blows, and so far neither lad had received a severe jolt.  At that moment, however, Hal felt a keen pain in his left arm. He glanced down curiously and saw a tiny stream of red spout forth. His lips set in a thin line.  \"Guns, Chester,\" he said quietly, halting in his tracks. \"They are using knives.\"  \"Good,\" said Chester, also halting. \"Back to back.\"  The lads whipped out their automatics simultaneously, and, back to back, confronted the crowd. Hal spoke.  \"We are not spies,\" he shouted, \"but we are not going to be killed without a fight. We are British army officers. Stand back!\"  Before the threatening muzzles of the two automatics the crowd hesitated. Then, from directly ahead of Chester, a shot rang out. The lad heard something whiz past his head, and from beyond came a cry of pain.  \"Shot one of his own number,\" muttered the lad.  His finger tightened on the trigger as he saw a man about to leap forward regardless of the automatic.  \"I'm going to shoot, Hal,\" he called.  \"I guess it can't be helped,\" replied the lad quietly. \"When I give the word turn loose on 'em, and then we'll make another break.\"  He hesitated a single instant and then called:  \"Ready?\"  \"Ready!\" came the reply.  \"Then--\" began Hal, and suddenly cried, \"Wait!\"  For at that moment the crowd in front of him suddenly began to scatter, and from beyond Hal made out a troop of Italian cavalry bearing down on them with drawn sabers. Hal lowered his weapon and called out:  \"It's all right, Chester!\"     CHAPTER IV.  AN OLD FRIEND.   \"What's the meaning of this?\" demanded an officer, pulling in his horse beside the two lads, while his troop gave their attention to driving back the crowd, which gave ground slowly.  \"We were attacked by the crowd, captain,\" Hal explained.  \"Why?\" asked the officer.  \"We were accused of being spies.\"  \"By whom?\"  \"By an Italian army officer back there,\" replied Hal, making a gesture with his hand.  \"Here he comes now,\" interrupted Chester.  The man who had caused all the trouble now came pompously forward. At sight of him, the mounted officer sprang from the saddle and came to attention.  \"What is the matter, sir?\" he asked.  \"Arrest these two,\" said his superior, pointing to Hal and Chester. \"They are spies, and they knocked me down.\"  The Italian"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12684"],["title","Dorian (#1)"],["body","way.  The new canal for which the farmers of Greenstreet had worked and waited so long had just been completed. The big ditch, now full of running water, was a source of delight to the children as well as to the more practical adults. The boys and girls played on its banks, and waded and sported in the cool stream. Near the village of Greenstreet was a big headgate, from which the canal branched into two divisions. As Dorian walked along the canal bank that afternoon, he saw a group of children at play near the headgate. They were making a lot of robust noise, and Dorian stopped to watch them. He was always interested in the children, being more of a favorite among them than among the boys of his own age.  \"There's Dorian,\" shouted one of the boys. \"Who are you going to marry?\"  What in the world were the youngsters talking about, thought the young man, as the chattering children surrounded him.  \"What's all this?\" asked Dorian, \"a party?\"  \"Yes; it's Carlia's birthday; we're just taking a walk by the canal to see the water; my, but it's nice!\"  \"What, the party or the water?\"  \"Why, the water.\"  \"Both\" added another.  \"We've all told who we're going to marry,\" remarked a little rosy-faced miss, \"all but Carlia, an' she won't tell.\"  \"Well, but perhaps Carlia don't know. You wouldn't have her tell a fib, would you?\"  \"Oh, shucks, she knows as well as us.\"  \"She's just stubborn.\"  She who was receiving these criticisms seemed to be somewhat older and larger than her companions. Just now, not deigning to notice the accusation of her friends, she was throwing sticks into the running water and watching them go over the falls at the headgate and dance on the rapids below. Her white party dress was as yet spotless. She swung her straw hat by the string. Her brown-black hair was crowned by an unusually large bow of red ribbon. She was not the least discomposed by the teasing of the other children, neither by Dorian's presence. This was her party, and why should not she do and say what she pleased.  Carlia now led the way along the canal bank until she came to where a pole spanned the stream. She stopped, looked at the somewhat insecure footbridge, then turning to her companions, said:  \"I can back you out.\"  \"How? Doin' what?\" they asked.  \"Crossing the canal on the pole.\"  \"Shucks, you can't back me out,\" declared one of the boys, at which he darted across the swaying pole, and with a jump, landed safely across. Another boy went at it gingerly, and with the antics of a tight-rope walker, he managed to get to the other side. The other boys held back; none of the girls ventured.  \"All right, Carlia,\" shouted the boys on the other bank.  The girl stood looking at the frail pole.  \"Come on, it's easy,\" they encouraged.  Carlia placed her foot on the pole as if testing it. The other girls protested. She would fall in and drown.  \"You dared us; now who's the coward,\" cried the boys.  Carlia took a step forward, balanced herself, and took another. The children stood in spell-bound silence. The girl advanced slowly along the frail bridge until she reached the middle where the pole swayed dangerously.  \"Balance yourself,\" suggested the second boy.  \"Run,\" said the first.  But Carlia could neither balance nor run. She stood for a moment on the oscillating span, then threw up her hands, and with a scream she plunged into the waters of the canal.  No thought of danger had entered Dorian's mind as he stood watching the capers of the children. If any of them fell in, he thought, they would only get a good wetting. But as Carlia fell, he sprang forward. The water at this point was quite deep and running swiftly. He saw that Carlia fell on her side and went completely under. The children screamed. Dorian, startled out of his apathy, suddenly ran to the canal and jumped in. It was done so impulsively that he still held on to his package of books. With one hand he lifted the girl out of the water, but in her struggles, she knocked the bundle from his hand, and the precious books splashed into the canal and floated down the stream. Dorian made an effort to rescue them, but Carlia clung so to his arms that he could do nothing but stand and see the package glide over the falls at the headgate and then go dancing over the rapids, even as Carlia's sticks had done. For a moment the young man's thoughts were with his books, and it seemed that he stood there in the canal for quite a while in a sort of daze, with the water rushing by his legs. Then mechanically he carried the girl to the bank and would have set her down again with her companions, but she clung to him so closely and with such terror in her eyes that he lifted her into his arms and talked reassuringly to her:  \"There, now,\" he said, \"you're only a bit wet. Don't cry.\"  \"Take me home. I--I want to go home,\" sobbed the girl.  \"Sure,\" said Dorian. \"Come on everybody.\"  He led the way, and the rest of the children followed.  \"I suppose the party's about over, anyway,\" suggested he.  \"I--I guess so.\"  They walked on in silence for a time; then Carlia said:  \"I guess I'm heavy.\"  \"Not at all\", lied the young man bravely, for she was heavier than he had supposed; but she made no offer to walk. By the time they reached the gate, Carlia was herself again, and inclined to look upon her wetting and escape as quite an adventure.  \"There,\" said Dorian as he seated the girl on the broad top of the gate post; \"I'll leave you there to dry. It won't take long.\"  He looked at his own wet clothes, and then at his ragged, mud-laden shoes. He might as well carry the girl up the path to her home, but then, that was not necessary. The day was warm, there was no danger of colds, and she could run up the path in a few minutes.  \"Well, I'll go now. Goodby,\" he said.  \"Wait a minute--Say, I'm glad you saved me, but I'm sorry you lost your package. What was in it?\"  \"Only books.\"  \"I'll get you some more, when I get the money, yes I will. Come here and lift me down before you go.\"  He obeyed. She put a wet arm about his neck and cuddled her dark, damp curls against his russet mop. He lifted her lightly down, and then he slipped a chocolate secretly into her hand.  \"Oh girls,\" exclaimed one of the party, \"I know now.\"  \"Know what?\" asked Carlia.  \"I know who you are going to marry.\"  \"Who?\"  \"You're going to marry Dorian.\"     CHAPTER TWO.   The disposition to lie or evade never remained long with Dorian Trent; but that evening as he turned into the lane which led up to the house, he was sorely-tempted. Once or twice only, as nearly as he could remember, had he told an untruth to his mother with results which he would never forget. He must tell her the truth now.  But he would put off the ordeal as long as possible. There could be no harm in that. Everything was quiet about the house, as his mother was away. He hurriedly divested himself of his best clothes and put on his overalls. He took the milk pail and hung it on the fence until he brought the cows from the pasture. After milking, he did his other chores. There were no signs of mother. The dusk turned to darkness, yet no light appeared in the house. Dorian went in and lighted the lamp and proceeded to get supper.  The mother came presently, carrying a bag of wool. \"A big herd of sheep went by this afternoon,\" she explained, \"and they left a lot of fine wool on the barbed-wire fences. See, I have gathered enough for a pair of stockings.\" She seated herself.  \"You're tired,\" said Dorian.  \"Yes.\"  \"Well, you sit and rest; I'll soon have the supper on the table.\" This was no difficult task, as the evening meal was usually a very simple one, and Dorian had frequently prepared it. This evening as the mother sat there quietly she looked at her son with admiring eyes. What a big boy he was getting to be! He had always been big, it seemed to her. He had been a big baby and a big little boy, and now he was a big young man. He had a big head and big feet, big hands. His nose and mouth were big, and big freckles dotted his face--yes, and a big heart, as his mother very well knew. Along with his bigness of limb and body there was a certain awkwardness. He never could run as fast as the other boys, and he always fumbled the ball in their games though he could beat them swimming. So far in his youthful career he had not learned to dance. The one time he had tried, his girl partner had made fun of his awkwardness, so that ended his dancing. But Dorian was not clumsy about his mother's home and table. He handled the dishes as daintily as a girl, and the table was set and the food served in a very proper manner.  \"Did you get your shoes, Dorian?\"  Dorian burned his fingers on a dish which was not at all hot.  \"Mother, sit up; supper is ready.\"  They both drew up their chairs. Dorian asked the blessing, then became unusually solicitous in helping his mother, continually talking as he did so.  \"That little Duke girl was nearly drowned in the canal, this afternoon,\" he told her, going on with the details. \"She's a plucky little thing. Ten minutes after I had her out of the canal, she was as lively as ever.\"  The mother liked to hear him talk, so she did not interrupt him. After they had eaten, he forced her to take her rocking-chair while he cleared the table and washed the few dishes. She asked no more questions about shoes, but leaned back in her chair with half-closed eyes. Dorian thought to give her the mint lozenges, but fearing that it might lead to more questions, he did not.  Mrs. Trent was not old in years, but hard work had bent her back and roughened her hands. Her face was pleasant to look upon, even if there were some wrinkles now, and the hair was white at the temples. She closed her eyes as if she were going to sleep.  \"Now, mother, you're going to bed\", said Dorian. \"You have tired yourself out with this wool picking. I thought I told you before that I would gather what wool there was.\"  \"But you weren't here, and I could not stand to see the wind"]]]
