Upon a measure so significant and so defended, debate waxed hot, so that one gentleman proposed that the bill should be sent back to the committee with instructions not to report it back \"until the cold weather.\" The irritation and alarm of the Border States rendered modification necessary unless tact and caution were to be wholly thrown to the winds. Ultimately, therefore, the offensive title was exchanged for the simple one of \"An Act to secure freedom to all persons within the Territories of the United States,\" and the bill, curtailed to accord with this expression, became law by approval of the President on June 19.  A measure likely in its operation to affect a much greater number of persons than any other of those laws which have been mentioned was introduced by Senator Trumbull of Illinois. This was \"for the confiscation of the property of rebels, and giving freedom to the persons they hold in slavery.\" It made the slaves of all who had taken up arms against the United States \"forever thereafter free.\" It came up for debate on February 25, and its mover defended it as \"destroying to a great extent the source and origin of the rebellion, and the only thing which had ever seriously threatened the peace of the Union.\" The men of the Border States, appalled at so general a manumission, declared that it would produce intolerable conditions in their States, leading either to reënslavement or extermination. So strenuous an anti-slavery man as Senator Hale also suggested that the measure was unconstitutional. Similar discussion upon similar propositions went forward contemporaneously in the House. For once, in both bodies, the Democrats won in many skirmishes. Ultimately, as the outcome of many amendments, substitutes, recommitments, and conferences, a bill was patched up, which passed by 27 to 12 in the Senate and 82 to 42 in the House, and was approved by the President July 17. It was a very comprehensive measure; so much so, that Mr. Blaine has said of it: \"Even if the war had ended without a formal and effective system of emancipation, it is believed that this statute would have so operated as to render the slave system practically valueless.\"  The possibility of enlisting negroes as soldiers received early consideration. Black troops had fought in the Revolution; why, then, should not black men now fight in a war of which they themselves were the ultimate provocation? The idea pleased the utilitarian side of the Northern mind and shocked no Northern prejudice. In fact, as early as the spring of 1862 General Hunter, in the Department of the South, organized a negro regiment. In July, 1862, pending consideration of a bill concerning calling forth the militia, reported by the Senate Committee on Military Affairs, amendments were moved declaring that \"there should be no exemption from military service on account of color,\" permitting the enlistment of \"persons of African descent,\" and making \"forever thereafter free\" each person so enlisted, his mother, his wife, and his children. No other measure so aroused the indignation of the border-state men. Loyalty to the Union could not change their opinion of the negro. To put arms into the hands of slaves, or ex-slaves, was a terrible proposition to men who had too often vividly conceived the dread picture of slave insurrection. To set black men about the business of killing white men, to engage the inferior race to destroy the superior race, seemed a blasphemy against Nature. A few also of the Northerners warmly sympathized with this feeling. Black men shooting down white men was a spectacle which some who were friends of the black men could not contemplate without a certain shudder. Also many persons believed that the white soldiers of the North would feel degraded by having regiments of ex-slaves placed beside them in camp and in battle. Doubts were expressed as to whether negroes would fight, whether they would not be a useless charge, and even a source of peril to those who should depend upon them. Language could go no farther in vehemence of protest and denunciation than the words of some of the slave-state men in the House and Senate. Besides this, Garrett Davis of Kentucky made a very effective argument when he said: \"There is not a rebel in all Secessia whose heart will not leap when he hears that the Senate of the United States is originating such a policy. It will strengthen his hopes of success by an ultimate union of all the slave States to fight such a policy to the death.\" It was, however, entirely evident that, in the present temper of that part of the country which was represented in Congress, there was not much use in opposing any anti-slavery measure by any kind of argument whatever; even though the special proposition might be distasteful to many Republicans, yet at last, when pressed to the issue, they all faithfully voted Yea. In this case the measure, finally so far modified as to relate only to slaves of rebel owners, was passed and was signed by the President on July 17. Nevertheless, although it thus became law, the certainty that, by taking action under it, he would alienate great numbers of loyalists in the Border States induced him to go very slowly. At first actual authority to enlist negroes was only extorted from the administration with much effort. On August 25 obstinate importunity elicited an order permitting General Saxton, at Hilton Head, to raise 5,000 black troops; but this was somewhat strangely accompanied, according to Mr. Wilson, with the suggestive remark, that it \"must never see daylight, because it was so much in advance of public sentiment.\" After the process had been on trial for a year, however, Mr. Lincoln said that there was apparent \"no loss by it in our foreign relations, none in our home popular sentiment, none in our white military force,--no loss by it anyhow or anywhere.\" On the other hand, it had brought a reinforcement of 130,000 soldiers, seamen, and laborers. \"And now,\" he said, \"let any Union man who complains of this measure test himself by writing down in one line that he is for subduing the rebellion by force of arms, and in the next that he is for taking these 130,000 men from the Union side, and placing them where they would be best for the measure he condemns.\" Yet so ineradicable was the race prejudice that it was not until the spring of 1864, after all efforts for action by Congress had failed, that the attorney-general declared black soldiers to be entitled to the same pay as white soldiers. Regarding a soldier merely as a marketable commodity, doubtless the white was worth more money; yet life was about the same to each, and it was hard to see why one should be expected to sell his life for fewer dollars than satisfied the other.  Besides these measures, Congress gave evidence of its sentiments by passing an act for appointing diplomatic representatives to Hayti and Liberia; also further evidence by passing certain legislation against the slave trade.  The recital of all these doings of the legislators sufficiently indicates the hostility of Congress towards slavery. In fact, a large majority both in the Senate and in the House had moved out against it upon nearly every practicable line to the extremity of the constitutional tether. Neither arguments, nor the entreaties of the border-state men, nor any considerations of policy, had exercised the slightest restraining influence. It is observable that this legislation did not embody that policy which Mr. Lincoln had suggested, and to which he had become strongly attached. On the contrary, Congress had done everything to irritate, where the President wished to do everything to conciliate; Congress made that compulsory which the President hoped to make voluntary. Mr. Lincoln remained in 1862, as he had been in 1858, tolerant towards the Southern men who by inheritance, tradition, and the necessity of the situation, constituted a slaveholding community. To treat slave-ownership as a crime, punishable by confiscation and ruin, seemed to him unreasonable and merciless. Neither does he seem ever to have accepted the opinion of many Abolitionists, that the negro was the equal of the white man in natural endowment. There is no reason to suppose that he did not still hold, as he had done in the days of the Douglas debates, that it was undesirable, if not impossible, that the two races should endeavor to abide together in freedom as a unified community. In the inevitable hostility and competition he clearly saw that the black man was likely to fare badly. It was by such feelings that he was led straight to the plan of compensation of owners and colonization of freedmen, and to the hope that a system of gradual emancipation, embodying these principles, might be voluntarily undertaken by the Border States under the present stress. If the executive and the legislative departments should combine upon the policy of encouraging and aiding such steps as any Border State could be induced to take in this direction, the President believed that he could much more easily extend loyalty and allegiance among the people of those States,--a matter which he valued far more highly than other persons were inclined to do. Such were his views and such his wishes. To discuss their practicability and soundness would only be to wander in the unprofitable vagueness of hypothesis, for in spite of all his efforts they were never tested by trial. It must be admitted that general opinion, both at that day and ever since, has regarded them as visionary; compensation seemed too costly, colonization probably was really impossible.  After the President had suggested his views in his message he waited patiently to see what action Congress would take concerning them. Three months elapsed and Congress took no such action. On the contrary, Congress practically repudiated them. Not only this, it was"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12805"],["title","The Boy Allies in the Balkan Campaign; Or, the Struggle to Save a Nation (#1)"],["body","his revolver carefully.  Colonel Anderson also nodded his agreement to this plan.  Hal now changed his course and the airship headed toward the south, bearing off a trifle to the east, in a direction that he believed, eventually, would land them in Serbia.  It became apparent now that the Austrian had not boasted of the speed of his craft without reason, for he gained perceptibly.  \"We can't out-run him, Hal,\" shouted Chester.  \"Then we shall have to try something else,\" was the reply.  Abruptly he reduced the speed of the craft and the Austrians dashed in range of the revolvers of the fugitives almost before they could have realized it.  \"Crack! Crack!\"  Chester and Colonel Anderson had fired. There came a scream of pain from behind and the Austrian craft wobbled crazily. A moment later a man sprang to his feet, sought to retain his footing, threw up his arms and went hurtling into space.  \"Got one, Hal!\" said Chester, quietly.  \"Good!\"  Came a volley of small arm fire from behind and bullets whined about the four friends. Again Chester and Colonel Anderson fired almost simultaneously and again their efforts were rewarded. A second man was put out of the fight, as they could see.  At this moment Stubbs came into action.  He arose from his seat and, grasping the side of the speeding craft with his left hand for support, stood to his full height. His right arm drew back, then flashed sharply forward again and a small object went spinning through the air toward the Austrian airship.  It struck home and there was a terrible explosion, followed by several sharp cries of pain, as the Austrian airship seemed to split into a thousand pieces. A moment later these pieces disappeared.  The three friends turned upon Stubbs.  \"What is this, magic?\" asked Chester in surprise.  \"No,\" replied Stubbs, quietly. \"Melenite. I just happened to see a stick of it here, so I threw it.\"  \"Well, you did a pretty good job, Stubbs,\" said Colonel Anderson.  \"I didn't pitch for my college team two years for nothing,\" returned Stubbs modestly. \"But now let's go down. I want to get my feet on the ground again.\"  \"It won't be much longer, Stubbs,\" said Hal. \"Another two hours at this speed should put us across the Serbian frontier. Just be patient.\"  \"I'll wait,\" replied Stubbs, \"but I won't promise to be patient.\"  He sank back to his place and refused to talk further.  While the big army craft is speeding across Austria it will be a good time to explain the presence of the four friends in their present predicament and introduce them briefly to those who have not met them before.  Hal Paine and Chester Crawford were both American lads. With the former's mother, they had been in Berlin at the outbreak of the great war, and, after a series of interesting and exciting adventures, they made their way to Liége just in time to take part in the defense of that stronghold with the Belgian army.  There they won distinction and lieutenancies in the Belgian service, the latter bestowed upon them by King Albert himself. They had been in France with the British troops that had stopped the German drive on Paris and had gone with the Allied army on its advance. They had seen service on all fronts and now considered themselves veteran campaigners.  Colonel Anderson they had met in Berlin just after the Kaiser had declared war upon France. The colonel, lieutenant then, and Major Derevaux, a Frenchman, had taken the boys with them on their flight and the four had later encountered each other in many strange and unexpected places.  Stubbs they also had met while on one of their many missions and had earned the little man's undying gratitude; but he had repaid whatever they had done for him, with interest, more than once.  The boys, in their latest exploit, had been with the Italian army in the Alps. Two of the four friends having fallen into the hands of the enemy, the others had entered the enemy's lines in an effort to effect their escape.  It was a daring adventure, but after a fight and chase, the four had managed to seize the airship in which we now find them and had at last fought their way clear. They had then held a council of war and decided that it was best to head for the Balkans, rather than to run the gauntlet of the Austrian flying craft which kept constant vigil in the direction of the Italian lines.  Hal and Chester, typical American lads, were large and strong for their ages, which were within a year of each other, seventeen and eighteen now. In the rough lumber camps of the north, the two had had considerable experience in the use of firearms and the art of self-defense--fists. Also, during the school term each had practiced the use of the sword until, though by no means experts, they could give a fair account of themselves with this weapon--as each had done more than once.  Fortunately, both lads had made a study of languages and spoke French and German fluently. They never had trouble on that score.  The great war up to this point had not gone as successfully as the Entente Allies had hoped in the early days. The German lines on all fronts were seemingly stronger than ever before. Even the entrance of Italy into the war on the side of the Allies had failed to turn the balance, as it had been confidently expected it would. East and west, the German lines held, while in the Balkans the enemy was even now advancing against the heroic little Serbian army, which, before many days, was to be forced to relinquish its country to the iron heel of the invader. Montenegro, the smallest factor in the war, still was fighting hard--the rugged and gigantic mountaineers giving a good account of themselves upon all sides.  This was the situation, then, as the airship containing Colonel Anderson, British officer, Anthony Stubbs, American war correspondent, and Hal Paine and Chester Crawford sped southward over Austria.  Several hours after the sinking of the Austrian aeroplane Chester spoke.  \"Where do you suppose we are now, Hal?\" he asked.  \"I believe we must have crossed the frontier,\" replied Hal. \"However, we'll wait another half hour before descending to have a look.\"  The half hour up, Hal sent the airship lower and lower. Soon, a faint gray speck below became visible, assuming larger and larger proportions, until all aboard made out the ground beneath.  And then, half a mile ahead, a body of troops were seen. Hal checked the speed of the craft immediately.  \"Don't know who they are,\" he explained. \"We'll be careful. They may be all right and then again they may not be.\"  He sent the machine higher again and a few minutes later the craft hung directly above the troops below.  \"I can't make out those uniforms,\" declared Chester.  \"Nor I,\" said Hal. \"However, they are not Austrian, I can see that. We'll take a chance and go down.\"  Again the machine moved closer toward the earth, and a few minutes later came to rest upon the ground a short distance from the main body of troops. A squad of men, let by an officer, came hurriedly forward, covering the four friends with their rifles.  \"By Jove!\" exclaimed Colonel Anderson. \"You must have miscalculated a bit, Hal. I recognize them now.\"  \"Well, who are they?\" demanded the lad.  \"Montenegrins.\"  \"Good,\" cried Chester. \"Then we are among friends.\"  The four friends raised their hands in token of surrender as the officer and his men came toward them. A few paces away, the officer halted and addressed them.  Hal shook his head.  \"Can't understand that lingo,\" he exclaimed.  He addressed the officer in English and the officer also indicated that he could not understand.  \"Don't want to tackle him in German if I can help it,\" said Hal. \"It might not suit him.\"  \"Well, what's the matter with French?\" Chester wanted to know.  \"Nothing, I guess,\" returned Hal. \"I'll try him. We are British officers,\" he said, addressing the Montenegrin officer, \"and we have just escaped from the Austrians.\"  The Montenegrin understood and replied in broken French:  \"How am I to know you are not of the enemy?\"  \"Well, I don't know, to tell the truth,\" Hal replied with a pleasant smile. \"I am afraid it does look a little bad for us, as we have nothing to prove our identities. But if you have a British or French officer about here, perhaps we can convince him.\"  The Montenegrin nodded.  \"Fortunately, we have,\" he said. He ordered one of his men to summon Colonel Edwards.  \"By Jove!\" said Anderson. \"I know an Edwards. I wonder can it be the same?\"  \"No such luck, I am afraid,\" said Chester.  But it was; and a few moments later Colonel Edwards and Colonel Anderson were shaking hands affectionately.     CHAPTER III.  THE KING OF THE MONTENEGRINS.   With his hand upon Edwards' arm, Colonel Anderson approached Hal and Chester.  \"I want you to meet my two young friends,\" he said.  Colonel Edwards shook hands with each lad in turn and then turned to Stubbs, who, during all this time, had been standing quietly, while he cast a critical eye upon the Montenegrin troopers who stood near.  \"A likely looking bunch of men,\" he muttered to himself. \"I'll bet they could give a good account of themselves in a--\"  He faced about just in time to acknowledge Colonel Anderson's introduction to Colonel Edwards; then turned again to survey the mountaineers.  \"Good fighters, these,\" he said to himself, \"or I miss my guess.\"  \"Now,\" said Hal to Colonel Edwards, \"there is really no use of our standing here. I'd like to look up a place where I can turn in for a few winks. I'm dead tired and I imagine the rest of you are, too.\"  Chester seconded Hal's motion and Colonel Anderson admitted his own fatigue. Stubbs settled the matter.  \"Where there are men there are beds,\" he said; \"or at least cots, or pallets, or something. I'm going to find one.\"  He moved toward a row of tents in the distance.  \"Hold on there,\" said Chester. \"We're all going, Stubbs.\"  In the meantime Colonel Edwards had been holding a consultation with the Montenegrin officer who had"]]]
