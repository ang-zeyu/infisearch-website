There's nothing but little poles that will scarcely make six-inch boards. We don't produce one-fourth of the lumber we use in this state, and we are using wood ten times as fast as our forests are growing it.\"  \"I thought Pennsylvania was a great lumbering state,\" protested Lew.  \"For a good many years it led the nation in the production of lumber, young man, but now it ranks twentieth among the states. If only fire could be kept out of the forests, we might some day raise our own timber again. But the lumbermen chopped down the big trees and fire has destroyed the little ones and even burned the forest soil so that nothing grows in it again. We have not only destroyed our forests, but we have so injured the land that new trees do not grow to take the place of those we cut.\"  The two boys stared at the lumberman in amazement. \"Where <i>do</i> we get our lumber from?\" demanded Lew.  \"Practically all of it comes from the South. That's one reason lumber costs so much here. The people of Pennsylvania pay $25,000,000 a year in freight charges on the lumber they use. That's one of the reasons those cedar boards you were looking at cost so much. When the new freight rates go into effect the cost of hauling our lumber to us will be something like $40,000,000 a year.\"  The two boys were very thoughtful as they made their way back to Charley's shop.  \"What are people going to do for wood pretty soon?\" Lew inquired of his companion. \"If we can't build a little boat because the wood costs too much, how are people going to get homes and furniture and wagons and motor-cars and a thousand other things? Seems to me pretty much everything we use is made of wood.\"  \"I don't know,\" replied Charley. \"But what bothers me more just now is to know what we are going to do during Easter vacation. It may be the last vacation I shall ever have, and I'd like to have a good time.\"  \"Why not follow the lumber dealer's suggestion and go out to the forests? Easter doesn't come this year until after the trout season opens. We could go out to our old camp in the mountains and spend the vacation there, fishing and hiking.\"  \"That's a mighty good suggestion, Lew. If we have our packs ready, we can start from high school the minute it is dismissed. We can make that early afternoon train and get off at that little flag-station at the foot of Stone Mountain. Then we can hike through the notch and reach the far slope of Old Ironsides before dark. We shall have to camp overnight along the run from the spring there, as it is the only water for miles around. Then the next day we can go on into that little valley where we saw so many trout. That is so hard to reach that not many fishermen ever go there. The little stream from the spring on Old Ironsides runs into that brook. Do you remember what lots of little trout we saw not far below the spring? They will have become big fellows by this time and moved down into the larger stream. There ought to be some fine fishing there this spring.\"  \"They say it's an ill wind that blows nobody good. I'm sorry we can't build the boat, but we shall have just as good a time in the mountains as we should have had on the river. We'll borrow that little pup tent of Johnnie Lee's, and take our blankets, hatchets, fishing-rods, and grub.\"  \"I'd rather leave the tent at home and build a lean-to after we get there. Then we could take a portable wireless outfit and talk to the fellows at home here in the evening. Half a dozen dry cells would give us one-sixth of a kilowatt of current, and that ought to carry a message twenty-five or thirty miles easily. At night we might be able to talk fifty miles. We can carry six cells easily. The remainder of the outfit won't weigh much. We'll have to go as light as we can, for it's a mighty tough hike over Old Ironsides and on into that little valley.\"  \"Shall we take our pistols?\" asked Charley.  \"We'd better have at least one. You never can tell when you're going to need a pistol in the forest. Remember the time that bear treed me on the first hike of the Wireless Patrol? I don't ever want to get into another situation like that without something to shoot with.\"  Charley chuckled. \"It wasn't a pistol that saved you then,\" he smiled, \"but Willie Brown and his spark-gap.\"  \"Then we'll be doubly armed,\" replied Lew. \"Since you have so much faith in wireless, you can carry the outfit. I'll pack the gun. We're almost certain to have some kind of adventure, for every time the Wireless Patrol or any of its members venture into the woods, something exciting happens.\"     Chapter III  Off to the Mountains    Busy, indeed, were the succeeding ten days. The outfit that the two boys were to carry was packed and repacked several times, and each time it was overhauled something was eliminated from the packs; for both boys knew well enough that the trip before them would test their endurance even with the lightest of packs. Finally their outfit was reduced to two fishing-rods, one hatchet, a first-aid kit, a flash-light, the necessary food and dishes, one canteen, and one pistol, with the wireless equipment.  This was made as simple as possible. Six new dry cells were to be taken to provide current. Then there were a spark-gap, a spark-coil, a key, and a detector, with the receiving set, switch, and aerial. To be sure, the entire aerial was not packed, but merely the wires and insulators, as spreaders could be made in the forest. Then there was an additional coil of wire to be used for lead-in and suspension wires. No tuning instrument was necessary, because the wireless outfits of all the members of the Camp Brady Wireless Patrol were exactly alike and so were already in tune with one another. Without a tuning instrument, to be sure, it might not be possible for Charley and Lew to talk with anybody except their fellows of the Wireless Patrol, but in the present circumstances that made no difference to them. They had no intention of talking to anybody else.  The various instruments were carefully packed so that they could be carried without injury. The dishes were nested as well as possible. Then all were stowed away in the pack bags, together with the food supplies. The two blankets were tightly folded and tied, ready to be slung over the shoulders. Long before that last session of school, everything was in readiness. When finally that last session was over, the two lads had only to strap their packs on their backs, sling their blankets into place, and pick up their little fishing-rods, unjointed and compactly packed in cloth cases. Lew buckled the pistol to his belt and suspended the canteen from his shoulder, while Charley sheathed his little axe and hung it on his hip. Then, completely ready, the two lads waved farewell to their envious comrades and hastened away to the train. In less than an hour the train stopped to let them off at the little flag-station at the foot of Stone Mountain. In a moment more it had gone whistling around the shoulder of the hill, leaving the two boys alone on the edge of the wilderness.  Quickly they adjusted their packs and started back along the railroad-track toward the gap through which they were to pass to Old Ironsides. Rapidly they made their way along the road-bed.  \"We'd better hustle while the going's good,\" commented Lew, glancing at the heavy clouds that obscured the sun, \"for it will get dark early to-night. It'll be slow enough going once we leave the track.\"  \"There's one thing sure,\" replied Charley. \"We won't be bothered with wet ground. I think I never saw the earth so dry at this season of the year. There was almost no snow last winter and we've hardly had a rain this spring. Usually it rains every day at this time of year.\"  Charley's prediction proved true. When the boys at last reached the notch in the mountains and left the railroad-track, they found the way almost as dry as a village street. Years before, the timber had been cut from Stone Mountain, and a logging trail had passed up the very gap through which the boys were now traveling. But brush and brambles had come in soon after the lumbermen left and now a thick stand of saplings also helped to choke the path. The briars tore at the boys' clothing and blankets. The bushy growths caught in their packs and straps and wrapped themselves about their feet and legs. Very quickly it became evident that a hard struggle lay before them.  Back from the trail, in the forest proper, there was little underbrush, but the stand of young trees was dense and the way underfoot was so rough and uneven that it was almost impossible to make any headway there. For Stone Mountain was a stone mountain in very truth. It appeared to be just one enormous heap of rocks and boulders. In a very little while both boys were perspiring profusely from their efforts, and both were conscious that they were tiring fast; for the grade up the notch was steep.  \"Gee!\" said Lew, at last. \"This is tougher than anything I ever saw when I was in the Maine woods with Dad. We've got to take it easy or we'll be tuckered out before we get through this gap. Let's rest a bit.\"  He sat down on a stone and Charley followed his example. As they rested, they looked sharply about them. They could see for some distance through the naked forest. The tree trunks stood straight and tall, and seemed to be crowded as close together as pickets on a fence.  \"This sure is a fine stand of poles,\" remarked Lew, \"but it's just as that lumber dealer said. There isn't a tree in it that would make a board wider than six inches. But there's some good timber farther back in the mountains. Do you remember the fine stand of pines in that little valley we're heading for? When we were there three years ago there hadn't been a tree cut in that valley. There must be millions and millions of feet of lumber there.\"  \"And do you remember,\" replied Charley, \"h"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12841"],["title","John Marr and Other Poems (#1)"],["body","there the ball, And partners were taken, and the red dance began, War’s red dance o’ death!—Well, we, to a man, We sailors o’ the North, wife, how could we lag?— Strike with your kin, and you stick to the flag! But to sailors o’ the South that easy way was barred. To some, dame, believe (and I speak o’ what I know), Wormwood the trial and the Uzzite’s black shard; And the faithfuller the heart, the crueller the throe. Duty? It pulled with more than one string, This way and that, and anyhow a sting. The flag and your kin, how be true unto both? If either plight ye keep, then ye break the other troth. But elect here they must, though the casuists were out; Decide—hurry up—and throttle every doubt.  Of all these thrills thrilled at keelson, and throes, Little felt the shoddyites a-toasting o’ their toes; In mart and bazar Lucre chuckled the huzza, Coining the dollars in the bloody mint of war.  But in men, gray knights o’ the Order o’ Scars, And brave boys bound by vows unto Mars, Nature grappled honor, intertwisting in the strife:— But some cut the knot with a thoroughgoing knife. For how when the drums beat? How in the fray In Hampton Roads on the fine balmy day?  There a lull, wife, befell—drop o’ silent in the din. Let us enter that silence ere the belchings re-begin. Through a ragged rift aslant in the cannonade’s smoke An iron-clad reveals her repellent broadside Bodily intact. But a frigate, all oak, Shows honeycombed by shot, and her deck crimson-dyed. And a trumpet from port of the iron-clad hails, Summoning the other, whose flag never trails: “Surrender that frigate, Will! Surrender, Or I will sink her—_ram_, and end her!”  ’T was Hal. And Will, from the naked heart-o’-oak, Will, the old messmate, minus trumpet, spoke, Informally intrepid,—“Sink her, and be damned!”*  [* Historic.] Enough. Gathering way, the iron-clad _rammed_. The frigate, heeling over, on the wave threw a dusk. Not sharing in the slant, the clapper of her bell The fixed metal struck—uinvoked struck the knell Of the _Cumberland_ stillettoed by the _Merrimac’s_ tusk; While, broken in the wound underneath the gun-deck, Like a sword-fish’s blade in leviathan waylaid, The tusk was left infixed in the fast-foundering wreck. There, dungeoned in the cockpit, the wounded go down, And the chaplain with them. But the surges uplift The prone dead from deck, and for moment they drift Washed with the swimmers, and the spent swimmers drown. Nine fathom did she sink,—erect, though hid from light Save her colors unsurrendered and spars that kept the height.  Nay, pardon, old aunty! Wife, never let it fall, That big started tear that hovers on the brim; I forgot about your nephew and the _Merrimac’s_ ball; No more then of her, since it summons up him. But talk o’ fellows’ hearts in the wine’s genial cup:— Trap them in the fate, jam them in the strait, Guns speak their hearts then, and speak right up. The troublous colic o’ intestine war It sets the bowels o’ affection ajar. But, lord, old dame, so spins the whizzing world, A humming-top, ay, for the little boy-gods Flogging it well with their smart little rods, Tittering at time and the coil uncurled.  Now, now, sweetheart, you sidle away, No, never you like _that_ kind o’ _gay;_ But sour if I get, giving truth her due, Honey-sweet forever, wife, will Dick be to you!  But avast with the War! ‘Why recall racking days Since set up anew are the slip’s started stays? Nor less, though the gale we have left behind, Well may the heave o’ the sea remind. It irks me now, as it troubled me then, To think o’ the fate in the madness o’ men. If Dick was with Farragut on the night-river, When the boom-chain we burst in the fire-raft’s glare, That blood-dyed the visage as red as the liver; In the _Battle for the Bay_ too if Dick had a share, And saw one aloft a-piloting the war— Trumpet in the whirlwind, a Providence in place— Our Admiral old whom the captains huzza, Dick joys in the man nor brags about the race.  But better, wife, I like to booze on the days Ere the Old Order foundered in these very frays, And tradition was lost and we learned strange ways. Often I think on the brave cruises then; Re-sailing them in memory, I hail the press o’ men On the gunned promenade where rolling they go, Ere the dog-watch expire and break up the show. The Laced Caps I see between forward guns; Away from the powder-room they puff the cigar; “Three days more, hey, the donnas and the dons!” “Your Zeres widow, will you hunt her up, Starr?” The Laced Caps laugh, and the bright waves too; Very jolly, very wicked, both sea and crew, Nor heaven looks sour on either, I guess, Nor Pecksniff he bosses the gods’ high mess. Wistful ye peer, wife, concerned for my head, And how best to get me betimes to my bed.  But king o’ the club, the gayest golden spark, Sailor o’ sailors, what sailor do I mark? Tom Tight, Tom Tight, no fine fellow finer, A cutwater nose, ay, a spirited soul; But, bowsing away at the well-brewed bowl, He never bowled back from that last voyage to China.  Tom was lieutenant in the brig-o’-war famed When an officer was hung for an arch-mutineer, But a mystery cleaved, and the captain was blamed, And a rumpus too raised, though his honor it was clear. And Tom he would say, when the mousers would try him, And with cup after cup o’ Burgundy ply him: “Gentlemen, in vain with your wassail you beset, For the more I tipple, the tighter do I get.” No blabber, no, not even with the can— True to himself and loyal to his clan.  Tom blessed us starboard and d—d us larboard, Right down from rail to the streak o’ the garboard. Nor less, wife, we liked him.—Tom was a man In contrast queer with Chaplain Le Fan, Who blessed us at morn, and at night yet again, D—ning us only in decorous strain; Preaching ’tween the guns—each cutlass in its place— From text that averred old Adam a hard case. I see him—Tom—on _horse-block_ standing, Trumpet at mouth, thrown up all amain, An elephant’s bugle, vociferous demanding Of topmen aloft in the hurricane of rain, “Letting that sail there your faces flog? Manhandle it, men, and you’ll get the good grog!” O Tom, but he knew a blue-jacket’s ways, And how a lieutenant may genially haze; Only a sailor sailors heartily praise.  Wife, where be all these chaps, I wonder? Trumpets in the tempest, terrors in the fray, Boomed their commands along the deck like thunder; But silent is the sod, and thunder dies away. But Captain Turret, _“Old Hemlock”_ tall, (A leaning tower when his tank brimmed all,) Manoeuvre out alive from the war did he? Or, too old for that, drift under the lee? Kentuckian colossal, who, touching at Madeira, The huge puncheon shipped o’ prime _Santa-Clara;_ Then rocked along the deck so solemnly! No whit the less though judicious was enough In dealing with the Finn who made the great huff; Our three-decker’s giant, a grand boatswain’s mate, Manliest of men in his own natural senses; But driven stark mad by the devil’s drugged stuff, Storming all aboard from his run-ashore late, Challenging to battle, vouchsafing no pretenses, A reeling King Ogg, delirious in power, The quarter-deck carronades he seemed to make cower. “Put him in _brig_ there!” said Lieutenant Marrot. “Put him in _brig!_” back he mocked like a parrot; “Try it, then!” swaying a fist like Thor’s sledge, And making the pigmy constables hedge— Ship’s corporals and the master-at-arms. “In _brig_ there, I say!”—They dally no more; Like hounds let slip on a desperate boar, Together they pounce on the formidable Finn, Pinion and cripple and hustle him in. Anon, under sentry, between twin guns, He slides off in drowse, and the long night runs.  Morning brings a summons. Whistling it calls, Shrilled through the pipes of the boatswain’s four aids; Trilled down the hatchways along the dusk halls: _Muster to the Scourge!_—Dawn of doom and its blast! As from cemeteries raised, sailors swarm before the mast, Tumbling up the ladders from the ship’s nether shades.  Keeping in the background and taking small part, Lounging at their ease, indifferent in face, Behold the trim marines uncompromised in heart; Their Major, buttoned up, near the staff finds room— The staff o’ lieutenants standing grouped in their place. All the Laced Caps o’ the ward-room come, The Chaplain among them, disciplined and dumb. The blue-nosed boatswain, complexioned like slag, Like a blue Monday lours—his implements in bag. Executioners, his aids, a couple by him stand, At a nod there the thongs to receive from his hand. Never venturing a caveat whatever may betide, Though functionally here on humanity’s side, The grave Surgeon shows, like the formal physician Attending the rack o’ the Spanish Inquisition.  The angel o’ the “brig” brings his prisoner up; Then, steadied by his old _Santa-Clara_, a sup, Heading all erect, the ranged assizes there, Lo, Captain Turret, and under starred bunting, (A florid full face and fine silvered hair,) Gigantic the yet greater giant confronting.  Now the culprit he liked, as a tall captain can A Titan subordinate and true _sailor-man;_ And frequent he’d shown it—no worded advance, But flattering the Finn with a well-timed glance. But what of that now? In the martinet-mien Read the _Articles of War_, heed the naval routine; While, cut to the heart a dishonor there to win, Restored to his senses, stood the Anak Finn; In racked self-control the squeezed tears peeping, Scalding the eye with repressed inkeeping. Discipline must be; the scourge is deemed due. But ah for the sickening and strange heart- benumbing, Compassionate abasement in shipmates that view; Such a grand champion shamed there succumbing! “Brown, tie him up.”—The cord he brooked: How else?—his arms spread apart—never threaping; No, never he flinched, never sideways he looked, Peeled to the waistband, the marble flesh creeping, Lashed by the sleet the officious winds urge.  In function his fellows their fellowship merge— The twain standing nigh—the two boatswain’s mates,"]]]
