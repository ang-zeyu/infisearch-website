Macgregor spat lightly on his palms.  'I've nae time to waste.'  Willie cast his jacket on the ground.  'I'll wrastle ye,' he said, with a gleam of hope.  'Thenk ye; but I'm no for dirtyin' ma guid claes.  Come on!'  To Willie's credit, let it be recorded, he did come on, and so promptly that Macgregor, scarcely prepared, had to take a light tap on the chin.  A brief display of thoroughly unscientific boxing ensued, and then Macgregor got home between the eyes.  Willie, tripping over his own jacket, dropped to earth.  'I wasna ready that time,' he grumbled, sitting up.  Macgregor seized his hand and dragged him to his feet, with the encouraging remark, 'Ye'll be readier next time.'  In the course of the second round Willie achieved a smart clip on his opponent's ear, but next moment he received, as it seemed, an express train on the point of his nose, and straightway sat down in agony.  'Is't bled, Wullie?' Macgregor presently inquired with compunction as well as satisfaction.  'It's near broke, ye----!' groaned the sufferer, adding, 'I kent fine ye wud bate me.'  'What for did ye fecht then?'  'Nane o' your business.'  'Weel, get up.  Yer breeks'll get soakit sittin' there.'  The victor donned his jacket.  'Ma breeks is nane o' your business, neither.'  'Ach, Wullie, dinna be a wean.  Get up an' shake han's.  I've got to gang.'  'Gang then!  Awa' an' boast to yer girl that ye hut a man on his nose behind his back----'  'Havers, man!  What's wrang wi' ye?'  'I'll tell ye what's wrang wi' you, Macgreegor Robi'son!'  Willie cleared his throat noisily.  'Listen!  Ye're ower weel aff.  Ye've got a dacent fayther an' mither an' brither an' sister; ye've got a dacent uncle; ye've got a dacent girl. . . .  An' what the hell ha'e I got?  A rotten aunt!' Maybe she canna help bein' rotten, but she is--damp rotten!  She wud be gled, though she wud greet, if I got a bullet the morn.  There ye are!  That's me!'  'Wullie!' Macgregor exclaimed, holding out his hand, which the other ignored.  'I'm rotten, tae,' he went on, bitterly.  'Fine I ken it.  But I never had an equal chance wi' you.  I'm no blamin' ye.  Ye've aye shared me what ye had.  I treated ye ill aboot the enlistin'.  But I wasna gaun to enlist to please you, nor ma aunt, neither.' He rose slowly and picked up his shabby jacket.  'But, by ----, I'll enlist to please masel'!'  He held out his hand.  'There it is, if ye want it, Macgreegor. . . .  Ha'e ye a match?  Weel, show a licht.  Is ma nose queer-like?'  'Ay,' Macgregor unwillingly replied, and, with inspiration, added consolingly, 'But it was aye that, Wullie.'     IV  THE RING  'Wha' was chasin' ye?' Christina inquired, as Macgregor came breathless to the counter, which she was tidying up for the night.  'I was feart I was gaun to be late.' he panted.  'I wud ha'e excused ye under the unique circumstances,' she said graciously.  'Sit doon an' recover yer puff.'  He took the chair, saying: 'It was Wullie Thomson.  He's awa' to enlist.'  'Wullie Thomson!  Weel, that's a bad egg oot the basket.  Hoo did ye manage it, Mac?'  'It wasna me,' Macgregor replied, not a little regretfully.  'He's enlistin' to please hissel'.  He says he's fed up wi' his aunt.'  'She's been feedin' him up for a lang while, puir body.  But ye're a queer lad,' she said softly, 'the way ye stick to a fushionless character like him.  I was tellin' Miss Tod,' she continued, 'aboot----'  'Oor engagement!' he burst out, scarlet.  'Whist, man!--ye've a wild imagination!--aboot ye enlistin'.  She's been in a state o' patriotic tremulosity ever since.  Dinna be surprised if she tries for to kiss ye.'  'I wud be mair surprised,' said Macgregor, with unexpected boldness, 'if you tried it.'  'Naething could exceed ma ain amazement,' she rejoined, 'if I did.'  'I've got the ring,' he announced, his hand in his pocket.  'Order!  Remember, I'm still at the receipt o' custom--three bawbees since seeven o'clock.'  'I hope ye'll like it,' he said, reluctantly withdrawing his hand empty.  'Miss Tod canna hear us, can she?'  'Ye never can tell what a spinster'll hear when she's interested. At present she's nourishin' hersel' on tea--her nineteenth cup for the day; but she'll be comin' shortly to embrace ye an' shut the shop.  I micht as weel get on ma hat. . . .  An' 'what did yer parents say to ye?'  'They said ye was an awfu' nice, clever, bonny, handsome lassie----'  'Tit, tit!  Aboot the enlistin', I meant.  But I'll no ask ye that. They wud be prood, onyway.'  'Ma uncle's raised ma wages, an' they're to be payed a' the time I'm awa'.'  'Shakespeare!  That's a proper uncle to ha'e!  But dinna be tempted to stop awa' till ye're a millionaire.  Oh, here's Miss Tod.  Keep calm.  She'll no bite ye.'  The little elderly woman who entered had made the acquaintance of Macgregor in his early courting days, especially during the period wherein he had squandered his substance in purchases of innumerable and unnecessary lead pencils, etcetera, doubtless with a view to acquiring merit in her eyes as well as in her assistant's.  She now proceeded to hold his hand, patting it tenderly, while she murmured 'brave lad' over and over again, to his exquisite embarrassment.  'But ye'll bate the nesty Rooshians, dearie--I meant for to say the Prooshians, Christina--an' ye'll come marchin' hame a conductor or an inspector, or whatever they ca' it, wi' medals on yer breist an' riches in yer purse----'  'An' rings on his fingers an' bells----'  'Noo, noo, lassie, ye're no to mak' fun o' me!  Whaur's his case?'  Christina handed her an aluminium cigarette case--the best in the shop--and she presented it to Macgregor, saying: 'Ye're no to gang an' hurt yer health wi' smokin'; but when ye tak' a ceegarette, ye'll maybe gi'e a thocht to an auld body that'll be rememberin' ye, baith mornin' an' nicht.'  'If he smokes his usual, he'll be thinkin' o' ye every twinty meenutes,' remarked the girl, and drawing on her gloves, she came round to the door in order to close an interview which threatened to become lugubrious for all parties.       *     *     *     *     *  'Everybody's terrible kind,' Macgregor observed, when he found himself alone with Christina on the pavement.  'Will ye look at the ring noo?'  She shook her head and stepped out briskly.  After a little while he revived.  'I hope ye'll like it, Christina. It's got pearls on it.  I hope it'll fit ye.'  A long pause.  'I wish ye wud say something.'  'What'll I say?'  'Onything.  I never heard ye dumb afore.'  'Maybe I'm reformin'.'  'Christina!'  'That's ma name, but ye needna tell everybody.'  'Dinna tease.  We--we ha'e awfu' little time.  Tak' aff yer glove an' try the ring.  Naebody'll notice.  Ye can look at it later on.'  'I'm no in the habit o' acceptin' rings frae young men.'  'But--but we're engaged.'  'That's news, but I doobt it's no official.'  'At least we're near engaged.  Say we are, Christina.'  'This is most embarrassing, Mr. Robinson.'  'Aw, Christina!' said the boy, helplessly.  She let him remain in silent suspense for several minutes, until, in fact, they turned into the quiet street of her abode.  Then she casually remarked:  'Ma han's gettin' cauld wantin' its glove, Mac.'  He seized it joyfully and endeavoured to put the ring on.  'It's ower wee!' he cried, aghast.  'That's ma middle finger.'  It fitted nicely.  Triumphantly he exclaimed: '_Noo_ we're engaged!'  She had no rejoinder ready.  'Ye can tak' ma arm, if ye like,' he said presently, just a little too confidently.  'I dinna feel in danger o' collapsin' at present,' she replied, regarding the ring under the lamp they were passing.  'Ye're an extravagant thing!' she went on.  'I hope ye got it on appro.'  'What--dae ye no like it?'  'I like the feel o' it,' she admitted softly, 'an' it's real bonny; but ye--ye shouldna ha'e done it, Mac.'  She made as if to remove the ring.  He caught her hand.  'But we're engaged!'  'Ye're ower sure o' that,' she said a trifle sharply.  He stared at her.  'Firstly, I never said I wud tak' the ring for keeps,' she proceeded.  'Secondly, ye ha'ena seen ma uncle yet----'  'I'm no feart for him--if ye back me up.  Him an' yer aunt'll dae onything ye like.'  'Thirdly, ye ha'e never. . . .'  She broke off as they reached the close leading to her home.  'What ha'e I no done, Christina?'  'Never heed. . . .  Leave go ma finger.'  'Will ye keep the ring?'  'Hoo can I keep the ring when ye ha'e never. . .'  Again the sentence was not completed.  She freed her hand and stepped within the close.  'Tell me, an' I'll dae it, Christina,' he cried.  She shook her head, smiling rather ruefully.  'Tell me,' he pleaded.  'I canna--an' maybe ye wouldna like me ony better if I could.'  She took off the ring and with a wistful glance at it offered it to him.  He took it, and before she knew, it was on her finger again.  'Ye've jist got to keep it!' he said, desperately.  'An' Christina, I--I'm gaun to kiss ye!'  'Oh, mercy!'  But he had none. . . .  'Are we engaged or no?' he whispered at last.  'Let me get ma breath.'  'Hurry up!'  She laughed, though her eyes were wet.  'Oh, dear,' she murmured, 'I never thought I wud get engaged wi'oot a--a . . .'  'A what?'  Suddenly she leaned forward and touched his cheek.  'Dinna fash yersel', Mac.  Bein' in war-time, I suppose the best o' us has got to dae wi'oot some luxury or ither--sich as a proper High-Class Proposal.'     V  IN UNIFORM  There happened to be a little delay in providing the later batches of recruits with the garb proper to their battalion, and it was the Monday of their third week in training when Privates Robinson--otherwise Macgregor--and Thomson saw themselves for the first time in the glory of the kilt.  Their dismay would doubtless have been overwhelming had they been alone in that glory; even with numerous comrades in similar distress they displayed much awkwardness and self-c"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12272"],["title","The History of Puerto Rico (#1)"],["body"," FLORIDA             AND DEATH. 1520-1537      XII.--INCURSIONS OF FUGITIVE BORIQUÉN INDIANS AND CARIBS. 1520-1582     XIII.--DEPOPULATION OF THE ISLAND.

Boabdil, the last of the Moorish kings, had delivered the keys of Granada into the hands of Queen Isabel, the proud banner of the united kingdoms of Castile and Aragon floated triumphant from the walls of the Alhambra, and Providence, as if to recompense Iberian knighthood for turning back the tide of Moslem conquest, which threatened to overrun the whole of meridional Europe, had laid a new world, with all its inestimable treasures and millions of benighted inhabitants, at the feet of the Catholic princes.  Columbus had just returned from his first voyage. He had been scorned as an adventurer by the courtiers of Lisbon, mocked as a visionary by the learned priests of the Council in Salamanca, who, with texts from the Scriptures and quotations from the saints, had tried to convince him that the world was flat; he had been pointed at by the rabble in the streets as a madman who maintained that there was a land where the people walked with their heads down; and, after months of trial, he had been able to equip his three small craft and collect a crew of ninety men only by the aid of a royal schedule offering exemption from punishment for offenses against the laws to all who should join the expedition.  At last he had sailed amid the murmurs of an incredulous crowd, who thought him and his companions doomed to certain destruction, and now he had returned[1] bringing with him the living proofs of what he had declared to exist beyond that mysterious ocean, and showed to the astounded people samples of the unknown plants and animals, and of _the gold_ which he had said would be found there in fabulous quantities.  It was the proudest moment of the daring navigator's life when, clad in his purple robe of office, bedecked with the insignia of his rank, he entered the throne-room of the palace in Barcelona and received permission to be seated in the royal presence to relate his experiences. Around the hall stood the grandees of Spain and the magnates of the Church, as obsequious and attentive to him now as they had been proud and disdainful when, a hungry wanderer, he had knocked at the gates of La Rabida to beg bread for his son. It was the acme of the discoverer's destiny, the realization of his dream of glory, the well-earned recompense of years of persevering endeavor.  The news of the discovery created universal enthusiasm. When it was announced that a second expedition was being organized there was no need of a royal schedule of remission of punishment to criminals to obtain crews. The Admiral's residence was besieged all day long by the hidalgos[2] who were anxious to share with him the expected glories and riches. The cessation of hostilities in Granada had left thousands of knights, whose only patrimony was their sword, without occupation--men with iron muscles, inured to hardship and danger, eager for adventure and conquest.  Then there were the monks and priests, whose religious zeal was stimulated by the prospect of converting to Christianity the benighted inhabitants of unknown realms; there were ruined traders, who hoped to mend their fortunes with the gold to be had, as they thought, for picking it up; finally, there were the protégés of royalty and of influential persons at court, who aspired to lucrative places in the new territories; in short, the Admiral counted among the fifteen hundred companions of his second expedition individuals of the bluest blood in Spain.  As for the mariners, men-at-arms, mechanics, attendants, and servants, they were mostly greedy, vicious, ungovernable, and turbulent adventurers.[3]  The confiscated property of the Jews, supplemented by a loan and some extra duties on articles of consumption, provided the funds for the expedition; a sufficient quantity of provisions was embarked; twenty Granadian lancers with their spirited Andalusian horses were accommodated; cuirasses, swords, pikes, crossbows, muskets, powder and balls were ominously abundant; seed-corn, rice, sugar-cane, vegetables, etc., were not forgotten; cattle, sheep, goats, swine, and fowls for stocking the new provinces, provided for future needs; and a breed of mastiff dogs, originally intended, perhaps, as watch-dogs only, but which became in a short time the dreaded destroyers of natives. Finally, Pope Alexander VI, of infamous memory, drew a line across the map of the world, from pole to pole,[4] and assigned all the undiscovered lands west of it to Spain, and those east of it to Portugal, thus arbitrarily dividing the globe between the two powers.  At daybreak, September 25, 1493, seventeen ships, three carácas of one hundred tons each, two naos, and twelve caravels, sailed from Cadiz amid the ringing of bells and the enthusiastic Godspeeds of thousands of spectators. The son of a Genoese wool-carder stood there, the equal in rank of the noblest hidalgo in Spain, Admiral of the Indian Seas, Viceroy of all the islands and continents to be discovered, and one-tenth of all the gold and treasures they contained would be his!  Alas for the evanescence of worldly greatness! All this glory was soon to be eclipsed. Eight years after that day of triumph he again landed on the shore of Spain a pale and emaciated prisoner in chains.  It may easily be conceived that the voyage for these fifteen hundred men, most of whom were unaccustomed to the sea, was not a pleasure trip.  Fortunately they had fine weather and fair wind till October 26th, when they experienced their first tropical rain and thunder-storm, and the Admiral ordered litanies. On November 2d he signaled to the fleet to shorten sail, and on the morning of the 3d fifteen hundred pairs of wondering eyes beheld the mountains of an island mysteriously hidden till then in the bosom of the Atlantic Ocean.  Among the spectators were Bernal Diaz de Pisa, accountant of the fleet, the first conspirator in America; thirteen Benedictine friars, with Boil at their head, who, with Morén Pedro de Margarit, the strategist, respectively represented the religious and military powers; there was Roldán, another insubordinate, the first alcalde of the Española; there were Alonzo de Ojeda and Guevára, true knights-errant, who were soon to distinguish themselves: the first by the capture of the chief Caonabó, the second by his romantic love-affair with Higuemota, the daughter of the chiefess Anacaóna. There was Adrian Mojíca, destined shortly to be hanged on the ramparts of Fort Concepción by order of the Viceroy. There was Juan de Esquivél, the future conqueror of Jamaica; Sebastian Olano, receiver of the royal share of the gold and other riches that no one doubted to find; Father Marchena, the Admiral's first protector, friend, and counselor; the two knight commanders of military orders Gallego and Arroyo; the fleet's physician, Chanca; the queen's three servants,"]]]
