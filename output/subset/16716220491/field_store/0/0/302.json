But, the breathless moment past, the car was pulled up, head on to the railings; and a man in evening clothes was demanding excitedly what had happened. Smith, a hatless, disheveled figure, stepped up to the door.  “My name is Nayland Smith,” he said rapidly--“Burmese Commissioner.” He snatched a letter from his pocket and thrust it into the hands of the bewildered man. “Read that. It is signed by another Commissioner--the Commissioner of Police.”  With amazement written all over him, the other obeyed.  “You see,” continued my friend, tersely--“it is carte blanche. I wish to commandeer your car, sir, on a matter of life and death!”.  The other returned the letter.  “Allow me to offer it!” he said, descending. “My man will take your orders. I can finish my journey by cab. I am--”  But Smith did not wait to learn whom he might be.  “Quick!” he cried to the stupefied chauffeur--“You passed a car a minute ago--yonder. Can you overtake it?”  “I can try, sir, if I don’t lose her track.”  Smith leaped in, pulling me after him.  “Do it!” he snapped. “There are no speed limits for me. Thanks! Goodnight, sir!”  We were off! The car swung around and the chase commenced.  One last glimpse I had of the man we had dispossessed, standing alone by the roadside, and at ever increasing speed, we leaped away in the track of Eltham’s captors.  Smith was too highly excited for ordinary conversation, but he threw out short, staccato remarks.  “I have followed Fu-Manchu from Hongkong,” he jerked. “Lost him at Suez. He got here a boat ahead of me. Eltham has been corresponding with some mandarin up-country. Knew that. Came straight to you. Only got in this evening. He--Fu-Manchu--has been sent here to get Eltham. My God! and he has him! He will question him! The interior of China--a seething pot, Petrie! They had to stop the leakage of information. He is here for that.”  The car pulled up with a jerk that pitched me out of my seat, and the chauffeur leaped to the road and ran ahead. Smith was out in a trice, as the man, who had run up to a constable, came racing back.  “Jump in, sir--jump in!” he cried, his eyes bright with the lust of the chase; “they are making for Battersea!”  And we were off again.  Through the empty streets we roared on. A place of gasometers and desolate waste lots slipped behind and we were in a narrow way where gates of yards and a few lowly houses faced upon a prospect of high blank wall.  “Thames on our right,” said Smith, peering ahead. “His rathole is by the river as usual. Hi!”--he grabbed up the speaking-tube--“Stop! Stop!”  The limousine swung in to the narrow sidewalk, and pulled up close by a yard gate. I, too, had seen our quarry--a long, low bodied car, showing no inside lights. It had turned the next corner, where a street lamp shone greenly, not a hundred yards ahead.  Smith leaped out, and I followed him.  “That must be a cul de sac,” he said, and turned to the eager-eyed chauffeur. “Run back to that last turning,” he ordered, “and wait there, out of sight. Bring the car up when you hear a police-whistle.”  The man looked disappointed, but did not question the order. As he began to back away, Smith grasped me by the arm and drew me forward.  “We must get to that corner,” he said, “and see where the car stands, without showing ourselves.”    CHAPTER III. THE WIRE JACKET  I suppose we were not more than a dozen paces from the lamp when we heard the thudding of the motor. The car was backing out!  It was a desperate moment, for it seemed that we could not fail to be discovered. Nayland Smith began to look about him, feverishly, for a hiding-place, a quest in which I seconded with equal anxiety. And Fate was kind to us--doubly kind as after events revealed. A wooden gate broke the expanse of wall hard by upon the right, and, as the result of some recent accident, a ragged gap had been torn in the panels close to the top.  The chain of the padlock hung loosely; and in a second Smith was up, with his foot in this as in a stirrup. He threw his arm over the top and drew himself upright. A second later he was astride the broken gate.  “Up you come, Petrie!” he said, and reached down his hand to aid me.  I got my foot into the loop of chain, grasped at a projection in the gatepost and found myself up.  “There is a crossbar on this side to stand on,” said Smith.  He climbed over and vanished in the darkness. I was still astride the broken gate when the car turned the corner, slowly, for there was scanty room; but I was standing upon the bar on the inside and had my head below the gap ere the driver could possibly have seen me.  “Stay where you are until he passes,” hissed my companion, below. “There is a row of kegs under you.”  The sound of the motor passing outside grew loud--louder--then began to die away. I felt about with my left foot; discerned the top of a keg, and dropped, panting, beside Smith.  “Phew!” I said--“that was a close thing! Smith--how do we know--”  “That we have followed the right car?” he interrupted. “Ask yourself the question: what would any ordinary man be doing motoring in a place like this at two o’clock in the morning?”  “You are right, Smith,” I agreed. “Shall we get out again?”  “Not yet. I have an idea. Look yonder.”  He grasped my arm, turning me in the desired direction.  Beyond a great expanse of unbroken darkness a ray of moonlight slanted into the place wherein we stood, spilling its cold radiance upon rows of kegs.  “That’s another door,” continued my friend--I now began dimly to perceive him beside me. “If my calculations are not entirely wrong, it opens on a wharf gate--”  A steam siren hooted dismally, apparently from quite close at hand.  “I’m right!” snapped Smith. “That turning leads down to the gate. Come on, Petrie!”  He directed the light of the electric torch upon a narrow path through the ranks of casks, and led the way to the further door. A good two feet of moonlight showed along the top. I heard Smith straining; then--  “These kegs are all loaded with grease!” he said, “and I want to reconnoiter over that door.”  “I am leaning on a crate which seems easy to move,” I reported. “Yes, it’s empty. Lend a hand.”  We grasped the empty crate, and between us, set it up on a solid pedestal of casks. Then Smith mounted to this observation platform and I scrambled up beside him, and looked down upon the lane outside.  It terminated as Smith had foreseen at a wharf gate some six feet to the right of our post. Piled up in the lane beneath us, against the warehouse door, was a stack of empty casks. Beyond, over the way, was a kind of ramshackle building that had possibly been a dwelling-house at some time. Bills were stuck in the ground-floor window indicating that the three floors were to let as offices; so much was discernible in that reflected moonlight.  I could hear the tide, lapping upon the wharf, could feel the chill from the river and hear the vague noises which, night nor day, never cease upon the great commercial waterway.  “Down!” whispered Smith. “Make no noise! I suspected it. They heard the car following!”  I obeyed, clutching at him for support; for I was suddenly dizzy, and my heart was leaping wildly--furiously.  “You saw her?” he whispered.  Saw her! yes, I had seen her! And my poor dream-world was toppling about me, its cities, ashes and its fairness, dust.  Peering from the window, her great eyes wondrous in the moonlight and her red lips parted, hair gleaming like burnished foam and her anxious gaze set upon the corner of the lane--was Karamaneh... Karamaneh whom once we had rescued from the house of this fiendish Chinese doctor; Karamaneh who had been our ally; in fruitless quest of whom,--when, too late, I realized how empty my life was become--I had wasted what little of the world’s goods I possessed;--Karamaneh!  “Poor old Petrie,” murmured Smith--“I knew, but I hadn’t the heart--He has her again--God knows by what chains he holds her. But she’s only a woman, old boy, and women are very much alike--very much alike from Charing Cross to Pagoda Road.”  He rested his hand on my shoulder for a moment; I am ashamed to confess that I was trembling; then, clenching my teeth with that mechanical physical effort which often accompanies a mental one, I swallowed the bitter draught of Nayland Smith’s philosophy. He was raising himself, to peer, cautiously, over the top of the door. I did likewise.  The window from which the girl had looked was nearly on a level with our eyes, and as I raised my head above the woodwork, I quite distinctly saw her go out of the room. The door, as she opened it, admitted a dull light, against which her figure showed silhouetted for a moment. Then the door was reclosed.  “We must risk the other windows,” rapped Smith.  Before I had grasped the nature of his plan he was over and had dropped almost noiselessly upon the casks outside. Again I followed his lead.  “You are not going to attempt anything, singlehanded--against him?” I asked.  “Petrie--Eltham is in that house. He has been brought here to be put to the question, in the medieval, and Chinese, sense! Is there time to summon assistance?”  I shuddered. This had been in my mind, certainly, but so expressed it was definitely horrible--revolting, yet stimulating.  “You have the pistol,” added Smith--“follow closely, and quietly.”  He walked across the tops of the casks and leaped down, pointing to that nearest to the closed door of the house. I helped him place it under the open window. A second we set beside it, and, not without some noise, got a third on top.  Smith mounted.  His jaw muscles were very prominent and his eyes shone like steel; but he was as cool as though he were about to enter a theater and not the den of the most stupendous genius who ever worked for evil. I would forgive any man who, knowing Dr. Fu-Manchu, feared him; I feared him myself--feared him as one fears a scorpion;"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1184"],["title","The Count of Monte Cristo, Illustrated (#1)"],["body","when he assumed the command without consulting anyone, and he caused us to lose a day and a half at the Island of Elba, instead of making for Marseilles direct.”  0025m    “As to taking command of the vessel,” replied Morrel, “that was his duty as captain’s mate; as to losing a day and a half off the Island of Elba, he was wrong, unless the vessel needed repairs.”  “The vessel was in as good condition as I am, and as, I hope you are, M. Morrel, and this day and a half was lost from pure whim, for the pleasure of going ashore, and nothing else.”  “Dantès,” said the shipowner, turning towards the young man, “come this way!”  “In a moment, sir,” answered Dantès, “and I’m with you.” Then calling to the crew, he said, “Let go!”  The anchor was instantly dropped, and the chain ran rattling through the port-hole. Dantès continued at his post in spite of the presence of the pilot, until this manœuvre was completed, and then he added, “Half-mast the colors, and square the yards!”  “You see,” said Danglars, “he fancies himself captain already, upon my word.”  “And so, in fact, he is,” said the owner.  “Except your signature and your partner’s, M. Morrel.”  “And why should he not have this?” asked the owner; “he is young, it is true, but he seems to me a thorough seaman, and of full experience.”  A cloud passed over Danglars’ brow.  “Your pardon, M. Morrel,” said Dantès, approaching, “the vessel now rides at anchor, and I am at your service. You hailed me, I think?”  Danglars retreated a step or two. “I wished to inquire why you stopped at the Island of Elba?”  “I do not know, sir; it was to fulfil the last instructions of Captain Leclere, who, when dying, gave me a packet for Marshal Bertrand.”  “Then did you see him, Edmond?”  “Who?”  “The marshal.”  “Yes.”  Morrel looked around him, and then, drawing Dantès on one side, he said suddenly—  “And how is the emperor?”  “Very well, as far as I could judge from the sight of him.”  “You saw the emperor, then?”  “He entered the marshal’s apartment while I was there.”  “And you spoke to him?”  “Why, it was he who spoke to me, sir,” said Dantès, with a smile.  “And what did he say to you?”  “Asked me questions about the vessel, the time she left Marseilles, the course she had taken, and what was her cargo. I believe, if she had not been laden, and I had been her master, he would have bought her. But I told him I was only mate, and that she belonged to the firm of Morrel & Son. ‘Ah, yes,’ he said, ‘I know them. The Morrels have been shipowners from father to son; and there was a Morrel who served in the same regiment with me when I was in garrison at Valence.’”  “_Pardieu!_ and that is true!” cried the owner, greatly delighted. “And that was Policar Morrel, my uncle, who was afterwards a captain. Dantès, you must tell my uncle that the emperor remembered him, and you will see it will bring tears into the old soldier’s eyes. Come, come,” continued he, patting Edmond’s shoulder kindly, “you did very right, Dantès, to follow Captain Leclere’s instructions, and touch at Elba, although if it were known that you had conveyed a packet to the marshal, and had conversed with the emperor, it might bring you into trouble.”  0027m    “How could that bring me into trouble, sir?” asked Dantès; “for I did not even know of what I was the bearer; and the emperor merely made such inquiries as he would of the first comer. But, pardon me, here are the health officers and the customs inspectors coming alongside.” And the young man went to the gangway. As he departed, Danglars approached, and said,—  “Well, it appears that he has given you satisfactory reasons for his landing at Porto-Ferrajo?”  “Yes, most satisfactory, my dear Danglars.”  “Well, so much the better,” said the supercargo; “for it is not pleasant to think that a comrade has not done his duty.”  “Dantès has done his,” replied the owner, “and that is not saying much. It was Captain Leclere who gave orders for this delay.”  “Talking of Captain Leclere, has not Dantès given you a letter from him?”  “To me?—no—was there one?”  “I believe that, besides the packet, Captain Leclere confided a letter to his care.”  “Of what packet are you speaking, Danglars?”  “Why, that which Dantès left at Porto-Ferrajo.”  “How do you know he had a packet to leave at Porto-Ferrajo?”  Danglars turned very red.  “I was passing close to the door of the captain’s cabin, which was half open, and I saw him give the packet and letter to Dantès.”  “He did not speak to me of it,” replied the shipowner; “but if there be any letter he will give it to me.”  Danglars reflected for a moment. “Then, M. Morrel, I beg of you,” said he, “not to say a word to Dantès on the subject. I may have been mistaken.”  At this moment the young man returned; Danglars withdrew.  “Well, my dear Dantès, are you now free?” inquired the owner.  “Yes, sir.”  “You have not been long detained.”  “No. I gave the custom-house officers a copy of our bill of lading; and as to the other papers, they sent a man off with the pilot, to whom I gave them.”  “Then you have nothing more to do here?”  “No—everything is all right now.”  “Then you can come and dine with me?”  “I really must ask you to excuse me, M. Morrel. My first visit is due to my father, though I am not the less grateful for the honor you have done me.”  0029m    “Right, Dantès, quite right. I always knew you were a good son.”  “And,” inquired Dantès, with some hesitation, “do you know how my father is?”  “Well, I believe, my dear Edmond, though I have not seen him lately.”  “Yes, he likes to keep himself shut up in his little room.”  “That proves, at least, that he has wanted for nothing during your absence.”  Dantès smiled. “My father is proud, sir, and if he had not a meal left, I doubt if he would have asked anything from anyone, except from Heaven.”  “Well, then, after this first visit has been made we shall count on you.”  “I must again excuse myself, M. Morrel, for after this first visit has been paid I have another which I am most anxious to pay.”  “True, Dantès, I forgot that there was at the Catalans someone who expects you no less impatiently than your father—the lovely Mercédès.”  Dantès blushed.  “Ah, ha,” said the shipowner, “I am not in the least surprised, for she has been to me three times, inquiring if there were any news of the _Pharaon_. _Peste!_ Edmond, you have a very handsome mistress!”  “She is not my mistress,” replied the young sailor, gravely; “she is my betrothed.”  “Sometimes one and the same thing,” said Morrel, with a smile.  “Not with us, sir,” replied Dantès.  “Well, well, my dear Edmond,” continued the owner, “don’t let me detain you. You have managed my affairs so well that I ought to allow you all the time you require for your own. Do you want any money?”  “No, sir; I have all my pay to take—nearly three months’ wages.”  “You are a careful fellow, Edmond.”  “Say I have a poor father, sir.”  “Yes, yes, I know how good a son you are, so now hasten away to see your father. I have a son too, and I should be very wroth with those who detained him from me after a three months’ voyage.”  “Then I have your leave, sir?”  “Yes, if you have nothing more to say to me.”  “Nothing.”  “Captain Leclere did not, before he died, give you a letter for me?”  “He was unable to write, sir. But that reminds me that I must ask your leave of absence for some days.”  “To get married?”  “Yes, first, and then to go to Paris.”  “Very good; have what time you require, Dantès. It will take quite six weeks to unload the cargo, and we cannot get you ready for sea until three months after that; only be back again in three months, for the _Pharaon_,” added the owner, patting the young sailor on the back, “cannot sail without her captain.”  “Without her captain!” cried Dantès, his eyes sparkling with animation; “pray mind what you say, for you are touching on the most secret wishes of my heart. Is it really your intention to make me captain of the _Pharaon_?”  “If I were sole owner we’d shake hands on it now, my dear Dantès, and call it settled; but I have a partner, and you know the Italian proverb—_Chi ha compagno ha padrone_—‘He who has a partner has a master.’ But the thing is at least half done, as you have one out of two votes. Rely on me to procure you the other; I will do my best.”  “Ah, M. Morrel,” exclaimed the young seaman, with tears in his eyes, and grasping the owner’s hand, “M. Morrel, I thank you in the name of my father and of Mercédès.”  “That’s all right, Edmond. There’s a providence that watches over the deserving. Go to your father; go and see Mercédès, and afterwards come to me.”  “Shall I row you ashore?”  “No, thank you; I shall remain and look over the accounts with Danglars. Have you been satisfied with him this voyage?”  “That is according to the sense you attach to the question, sir. Do you mean is he a good comrade? No, for I think he never liked me since the day when I was silly enough, after a little quarrel we had, to propose to him to stop for ten minutes at the island of Monte Cristo to settle the dispute—a proposition which I was wrong to suggest, and he quite right to refuse. If you mean as responsible agent when you ask me the question, I believe there is nothing to say against him, and that you will be content with the way in which he has performed his duty.”  “But tell me, Dantès, if you had command of the _Pharaon_ should you be glad to see Danglars remain?”  “Captain or mate, M. Morrel, I shall always have the greatest respect for those who possess the owners’ confidence.”  “That’s right, that’s right, Dantès! I see you are a thoroughly good fellow, and will detain you no longer. Go, for I see how impatient you are.”  “Then I have leave?”  “Go, I tell you.”  “May I have the use of your skiff?”  “Certainly.”  “Then, for the present, M. Morrel, farewell, and a thousand thanks!”  “I hope soon to see you again, my dear Edmond. Good luck to you.”  The young sailor jumped into the skiff, and sat down "]]]
