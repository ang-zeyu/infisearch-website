If these pieces were securely glued together they would no longer slip, but the tendency to do so would exist just the same. Moreover, it would be found in the latter case that the bow would be much harder to bend than where the pieces were not glued together--in other words, the _stiffness_ of the bow would be materially increased.  ~Stiffness~ is the property by means of which a body acted upon by external forces tends to retain its natural size and shape, or resists deformation. Thus a material that is difficult to bend or otherwise deform is stiff; one that is easily bent or otherwise deformed is _flexible_. Flexibility is not the exact counterpart of stiffness, as it also involves toughness and pliability.  If successively larger loads are applied to a body and then removed it will be found that at first the body completely regains its original form upon release from the stress--in other words, the body is ~elastic~. No substance known is perfectly elastic, though many are practically so under small loads. Eventually a point will be reached where the recovery of the specimen is incomplete. This point is known as the ~elastic limit~, which may be defined as the limit beyond which it is impossible to carry the distortion of a body without producing a permanent alteration in shape. After this limit has been exceeded, the size and shape of the specimen after removal of the load will not be the same as before, and the difference or amount of change is known as the ~permanent set~.  Elastic limit as measured in tests and used in design may be defined as that unit stress at which the deformation begins to increase in a faster ratio than the applied load. In practice the elastic limit of a material under test is determined from the stress-strain diagram. It is that point in the line where the diagram begins perceptibly to curve.[2] (See Fig. 1.)  [Footnote 2: If the straight portion does not pass through the origin, a parallel line should be drawn through the origin, and the load at elastic limit taken from this line. (See Fig. 32.)]  ~Resilience~ is the amount of work done upon a body in deforming it. Within the elastic limit it is also a measure of the potential energy stored in the material and represents the amount of work the material would do upon being released from a state of stress. This may be graphically represented by a diagram in which the abscissæ represent the amount of deflection and the ordinates the force acting. The area included between the stress-strain curve and the initial line (which is zero) represents the work done. (See Fig. 1.) If the unit of space is in inches and the unit of force is in pounds the result is inch-pounds. If the elastic limit is taken as the apex of the triangle the area of the triangle will represent the ~elastic resilience~ of the specimen. This amount of work can be applied repeatedly and is perhaps the best measure of the toughness of the wood as a working quality, though it is not synonymous with toughness.  Permanent set is due to the ~plasticity~ of the material. A perfectly plastic substance would have no elasticity and the smallest forces would cause a set. Lead and moist clay are nearly plastic and wood possesses this property to a greater or less extent. The plasticity of wood is increased by wetting, heating, and especially by steaming and boiling. Were it not for this property it would be impossible to dry wood without destroying completely its cohesion, due to the irregularity of shrinkage.  A substance that can undergo little change in shape without breaking or rupturing is ~brittle~. Chalk and glass are common examples of brittle materials. Sometimes the word _brash_ is used to describe this condition in wood. A brittle wood breaks suddenly with a clean instead of a splintery fracture and without warning. Such woods are unfitted to resist shock or sudden application of load.  The measure of the stiffness of wood is termed the ~modulus of elasticity~ (or _coefficient of elasticity_). It is the ratio of stress per unit of area to the deformation per unit of         {      unit stress  } length. { E = ------------- } It is a number indicative of         {      unit strain  } stiffness, not of strength, and only applies to conditions within the elastic limit. It is nearly the same whether derived from compression tests or from tension tests.  A large modulus indicates a stiff material. Thus in green wood tested in static bending it varies from 643,000 pounds per square inch for arborvitæ to 1,662,000 pounds for longleaf pine, and 1,769,000 pounds for pignut hickory. (See Table IX.) The values derived from tests of small beams of dry material are much greater, approaching 3,000,000 for some of our woods. These values are small when compared with steel which has a modulus of elasticity of about 30,000,000 pounds per square inch.

This external pull is communicated to the interior, so that any portion of the material exerts a pull or tensile force upon the remainder, the ability to do so depending upon the property of cohesion. The result is an elongation or stretching of the material in the direction of the applied force. The action is the opposite of compression.  Wood exhibits its greatest strength in tension parallel to the grain, and it is very uncommon in practice for a specimen to be pulled in two lengthwise. This is due to the difficulty of making the end fastenings secure enough for the full tensile strength to be brought into play before the fastenings shear off longitudinally. This is not the case with metals, and as a result they are used in almost all places where tensile strength is particularly needed, even though the remainder of the structure, such as sills, beams, joists, posts, and flooring, may be of wood. Thus in a wooden truss bridge the tension members are steel rods.  The tensile strength of wood parallel to the grain depends upon the strength of the fibres and is affected not only by the nature and dimensions of the wood elements but also by their arrangement. It is greatest in straight-grained specimens with thick-walled fibres. Cross grain of any kind materially reduces the tensile strength of wood, since the tensile strength at right angles to the grain is only a small fraction of that parallel to the grain.  |--------------------------------------------------------------| |                           TABLE II                           | |--------------------------------------------------------------| |   RATIO OF STRENGTH OF WOOD IN TENSION AND IN COMPRESSION    | |           (Bul. 10, U.

The world was at least ignorant of its bereavement, while to me it was a real and terrible actuality.  \"What can we do?\" I asked, hiding my perturbation beneath the mask of a low and level voice.  \"We may stop here, and die of asphyxiation when our atmosphere tanks are empty,\" replied Perry, \"or we may continue on with the slight hope that we may later sufficiently deflect the prospector from the vertical to carry us along the arc of a great circle which must eventually return us to the surface.  If we succeed in so doing before we reach the higher internal temperature we may even yet survive.  There would seem to me to be about one chance in several million that we shall succeed--otherwise we shall die more quickly but no more surely than as though we sat supinely waiting for the torture of a slow and horrible death.\"  I glanced at the thermometer.  It registered 110 degrees.  While we were talking the mighty iron mole had bored its way over a mile into the rock of the earth's crust.  \"Let us continue on, then,\" I replied.  \"It should soon be over at this rate.  You never intimated that the speed of this thing would be so high, Perry.  Didn't you know it?\"  \"No,\" he answered.  \"I could not figure the speed exactly, for I had no instrument for measuring the mighty power of my generator.  I reasoned, however, that we should make about five hundred yards an hour.\"  \"And we are making seven miles an hour,\" I concluded for him, as I sat with my eyes upon the distance meter.  \"How thick is the Earth's crust, Perry?\" I asked.  \"There are almost as many conjectures as to that as there are geologists,\" was his answer.  \"One estimates it thirty miles, because the internal heat, increasing at the rate of about one degree to each sixty to seventy feet depth, would be sufficient to fuse the most refractory substances at that distance beneath the surface.  Another finds that the phenomena of precession and nutation require that the earth, if not entirely solid, must at least have a shell not less than eight hundred to a thousand miles in thickness.  So there you are.  You may take your choice.\"  \"And if it should prove solid?\" I asked.  \"It will be all the same to us in the end, David,\" replied Perry.  \"At the best our fuel will suffice to carry us but three or four days, while our atmosphere cannot last to exceed three.  Neither, then, is sufficient to bear us in safety through eight thousand miles of rock to the antipodes.\"  \"If the crust is of sufficient thickness we shall come to a final stop between six and seven hundred miles beneath the earth's surface; but during the last hundred and fifty miles of our journey we shall be corpses.  Am I correct?\" I asked.  \"Quite correct, David.  Are you frightened?\"  \"I do not know.  It all has come so suddenly that I scarce believe that either of us realizes the real terrors of our position.  I feel that I should be reduced to panic; but yet I am not.  I imagine that the shock has been so great as to partially stun our sensibilities.\"  Again I turned to the thermometer.  The mercury was rising with less rapidity.  It was now but 140 degrees, although we had penetrated to a depth of nearly four miles.  I told Perry, and he smiled.  \"We have shattered one theory at least,\" was his only comment, and then he returned to his self-assumed occupation of fluently cursing the steering wheel.  I once heard a pirate swear, but his best efforts would have seemed like those of a tyro alongside of Perry's masterful and scientific imprecations.  Once more I tried my hand at the wheel, but I might as well have essayed to swing the earth itself.  At my suggestion Perry stopped the generator, and as we came to rest I again threw all my strength into a supreme effort to move the thing even a hair's breadth--but the results were as barren as when we had been traveling at top speed.  I shook my head sadly, and motioned to the starting lever.  Perry pulled it toward him, and once again we were plunging downward toward eternity at the rate of seven miles an hour.  I sat with my eyes glued to the thermometer and the distance meter.  The mercury was rising very slowly now, though even at 145 degrees it was almost unbearable within the narrow confines of our metal prison.  About noon, or twelve hours after our start upon this unfortunate journey, we had bored to a depth of eighty-four miles, at which point the mercury registered 153 degrees F.  Perry was becoming more hopeful, although upon what meager food he sustained his optimism I could not conjecture.  From cursing he had turned to singing--I felt that the strain had at last affected his mind.  For several hours we had not spoken except as he asked me for the readings of the instruments from time to time, and I announced them.  My thoughts were filled with vain regrets.  I recalled numerous acts of my past life which I should have been glad to have had a few more years to live down.  There was the affair in the Latin Commons at Andover when Calhoun and I had put gunpowder in the stove--and nearly killed one of the masters.  And then--but what was the use, I was about to die and atone for all these things and several more.  Already the heat was sufficient to give me a foretaste of the hereafter.  A few more degrees and I felt that I should lose consciousness.  \"What are the readings now, David?\" Perry's voice broke in upon my somber reflections.  \"Ninety miles and 153 degrees,\" I replied.  \"Gad, but we've knocked that thirty-mile-crust theory into a cocked hat!\" he cried gleefully.  \"Precious lot of good it will do us,\" I growled back.  \"But my boy,\" he continued, \"doesn't that temperature reading mean anything to you?  Why it hasn't gone up in six miles.  Think of it, son!\"  \"Yes, I'm thinking of it,\" I answered; \"but what difference will it make when our air supply is exhausted whether the temperature is 153 degrees or 153,000?  We'll be just as dead, and no one will know the difference, anyhow.\" But I must admit that for some unaccountable reason the stationary temperature did renew my waning hope.  What I hoped for I could not have explained, nor did I try.  The very fact, as Perry took pains to explain, of the blasting of several very exact and learned scientific hypotheses made it apparent that we could not know what lay before us within the bowels of the earth, and so we might continue to hope for the best, at least until we were dead--when hope would no longer be essential to our happiness.  It was very good, and logical reasoning, and so I embraced it.  At one hundred miles the temperature had DROPPED TO 152 1/2 DEGREES! When I announced it Perry reached over and hugged me.  From then on until noon of the second day, it continued to drop until it became as uncomfortably cold as it had been unbearably hot before. At the depth of two hundred and forty miles our nostrils were assailed by almost overpowering ammonia fumes, and the temperature had dropped to TEN BELOW ZERO!  We suffered nearly two hours of this intense and bitter cold, until at about two hundred and forty-five miles from the surface of the earth we entered a stratum of solid ice, when the mercury quickly rose to 32 degrees.  During the next three hours we passed through ten miles of ice, eventually emerging into another series of ammonia-impregnated strata, where the mercury again fell to ten degrees below zero.  Slowly it rose once more until we were convinced that at last we were nearing the molten interior of the earth.  At four hundred miles the temperature had reached 153 degrees.  Feverishly I watched the thermometer.  Slowly it rose.  Perry had ceased singing and was at last praying.  Our hopes had received such a deathblow that the gradually increasing heat seemed to our distorted imaginations much greater than it really was.  For another hour I saw that pitiless column of mercury rise and rise until at four hundred and ten miles it stood at 153 degrees.  Now it was that we began to hang upon those readings in almost breathless anxiety.  One hundred and fifty-three degrees had been the maximum temperature above the ice stratum.  Would it stop at this point again, or would it continue its merciless climb?  We knew that there was no hope, and yet with the persistence of life itself we continued to hope against practical certainty.  Already the air tanks were at low ebb--there was barely enough of the precious gases to sustain us for another twelve hours.  But would we be alive to know or care?  It seemed incredible.  At four hundred and twenty miles I took another reading.  \"Perry!\" I shouted.  \"Perry, man!  She's going down! She's going down! She's 152 degrees again.\"  \"Gad!\" he cried.  \"What can it mean?  Can the earth be cold at the center?\"  \"I do not know, Perry,\" I answered; \"but thank God, if I am to die it shall not be by fire--that is all that I have feared.  I can face the thought of any death but that.\"  Down, down went the mercury until it stood as low as it had seven miles from the surface of the earth, and then of a sudden the realization broke upon us that death was very near.  Perry was the first to discover it.  I saw him fussing with the valves that regulate the air supply.  And at the same time I experienced difficulty in breathing. My head felt dizzy--my limbs heavy.  I saw Perry crumple in his seat.  He gave himself a shake and sat erect again.  Then he turned toward me.  \"Good-bye, David,\" he said.  \"I guess this is the end,\" and then he smiled and closed his eyes.  \"Good-bye, Perry, and good luck to you,\" I answered, smiling back "]]]
