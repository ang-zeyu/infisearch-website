Sure enough, the case was accorded first place in the November Sessions, with a fair start on a Monday morning toward the latter end of the month. In the purlieus of the mean, historic court, it was a morning not to be forgotten, and only to be compared with those which followed throughout the week. The prisoner's sex, her youth, her high bearing, and the peculiar isolation of her position, without a friend to stand by her in her need, all appealed to the popular imagination, and produced a fascination which was only intensified by the equally general feeling that no one else could have committed the crime. From the judge downward, all connected with the case were pestered for days beforehand with more or less unwarrantable applications for admission. And when the time came, the successful suppliant had to elbow every yard of his way from Newgate Street or Ludgate Hill; to pass three separate barriers held by a suspicious constabulary; to obtain the good offices of the Under Sheriff, through those of his liveried lackeys; and finally to occupy the least space, on the narrowest of seats, in a varnished stall filled with curiously familiar faces, within a few feet of the heavily veiled prisoner in the dock, and not many more from the red-robed judge upon the bench.  The first to take all this trouble on the Monday morning, and the last to escape from the foul air (shot by biting draughts) when the court adjourned, was a white-headed gentleman of striking appearance and stamina to match; for, undeterred by the experience, he was in like manner first and last upon each subsequent day. Behind him came and went the well-known faces, the authors and the actors with a semi-professional interest in the case; but they were not well known to the gentleman with the white head. He heard no more than he could help of their constant whisperings, and, if he knew not at whom he more than once had occasion to turn and frown, he certainly did not look the man to care. He had a well-preserved reddish face, with a small mouth of extraordinary strength, a canine jaw, and singularly noble forehead; but his most obvious distinction was his full head of snowy hair. The only hair upon his face, a pair of bushy eyebrows, was so much darker as to suggest a dye; but the eyes themselves were black as midnight, with a glint of midnight stars, and of such a subtle inscrutability that a certain sweetness of expression came only as the last surprise in a face full of contrast and contradiction.  No one in court had ever seen this man before; no one but the Under Sheriff learnt his name during the week; but by the third day his identity was a subject of discussion, both by the professional students of the human countenance, who sat behind him (balked of their study by the prisoner's veil), and among the various functionaries who had already found him as free with a sovereign as most gentlemen are with a piece of silver. So every day he was ushered with ceremony to the same place, at the inner end of the lowest row; there he would sit watching the prisoner, a trifle nearer her than those beside or behind him; and only once was his attentive serenity broken for an instant by a change of expression due to any development of the case.  It was not when the prisoner pleaded clearly through her veil, in the first breathless minutes of all; it was not a little later, when the urbane counsel for the prosecution, wagging his pince-nez at the jury, thrilled every other hearer with a mellifluous forecast of the new evidence to be laid before them. The missing watch and chain had been found; they would presently be produced, and the jury would have an opportunity of examining them, together with a plan of the chimney of the room in which the murder had been committed; for it was there that they had been discovered upon a second search instituted since the proceedings before the magistrates. The effect of this announcement may be conceived; it was the sensation of the opening day. The whole case of the prosecution rested on the assumption that there had been, on the part of some inmate of the house, who alone (it was held) could have committed the murder, a deliberate attempt to give it the appearance of the work of thieves. Thus far this theory rested on the bare facts that the glass of the broken window had been found outside, instead of within; that no other mark of foot or hand had been made or left by the supposititious burglars; whereas a brace of revolvers had been discovered in the dead man's bureau, both loaded with such bullets as the one which had caused his death, while one of them had clearly been discharged since the last cleaning. The discovery of the missing watch and chain, in the very chimney of the same room, was a piece of ideal evidence of the confirmatory kind. But it was not the point that made an impression on the man with the white hair; it did not increase his attention, for that would have been impossible; he was perhaps the one spectator who was not, if only for the moment, perceptibly thrilled.  Thrilling also was the earlier evidence, furnished by maid-servants and police constables in pairs; but here there was no surprise. The maids were examined not only as to what they had seen and heard on the night of the murder--and they seemed to have heard everything except the fatal shot--but upon the previous relations of their master and mistress--of which they showed an equally extensive knowledge. The constables were perforce confined to their own discoveries and observations when the maids had called them in. But all four witnesses spoke to the prisoner's behavior when shown the dead body of her husband, and there was the utmost unanimity in their several tales. The prisoner had exhibited little or no surprise; it was several minutes before she had uttered a syllable; and then her first words had been to point out that burglars alone could have committed the murder.  In cross-examination the senior counsel for the defence thus early showed his hand; and it was not a strong one to those who knew the game. A Queen's Counsel, like the leader for the Crown, this was an altogether different type of lawyer; a younger man, with a more engaging manner; a more brilliant man, who sought with doubtful wisdom to blind the jury with his brilliance. His method was no innovation at the Old Bailey; it was to hold up every witness in turn to the derision and contempt of the jury and the court. So both the maids were reduced to tears, and each policeman cleverly insulted as such. But the testimony of all four remained unshaken; and the judge himself soothed the young women's feelings with a fatherly word, while wigs were shaken in the well of the court. That was no road to the soft side of a decent, conscientious, hard-headed jury, of much the same class as these witnesses themselves; even the actors and authors had a sound opinion on the point, without waiting to hear one from the professional gentlemen in the well. But the man in front with the very white hair--the man who was always watching the prisoner at the bar--there was about as much expression of opinion upon his firm, bare face as might be seen through the sable thickness of her widow's veil.  It was the same next day, when, for some five hours out of a possible five and a half, the attention of the court was concentrated upon a point of obviously secondary significance. It was suggested by the defence that the watch and chain found up the study chimney were not those worn by the deceased at the time he met his death. The contention was supported by photographs of Alexander Minchin wearing a watch-chain that might or might not be of another pattern altogether; expert opinions were divided on the point; and experts in chains as well as in photography were eventually called by both sides. Interesting in the beginning, the point was raised and raised again, and on subsequent days, until all were weary of the sight of the huge photographic enlargements, which were handed about the court upon each occasion. Even the prisoner would droop in her chair when the \"chain photograph\" was demanded for the twentieth time by her own unflagging counsel; even the judge became all but inattentive on the point, before it was finally dropped on an intimation from the jury that they had made up their minds about the chains; but no trace of boredom had crossed the keen, alert face of the unknown gentleman with the snowy hair.  So the case was fought for Mrs. Minchin, tooth and nail indeed, yet perhaps with more asperity than conviction, and certainly at times upon points which were hardly worth the fighting. Yet, on the Friday afternoon, when her counsel at last played his masterstroke, and, taking advantage of the then new Act, put the prisoner herself in the witness-box, it was done with the air of a man who is throwing up his case. The truth could be seen at a glance at the clean-cut, handsome, but too expressive profile of the crushing cross-examiner of female witnesses and insolent foe to the police. As it had been possible to predict, from the mere look with which he had risen to his feet, the kind of cross-examination in store for each witness called by the prosecution, so it was obvious now that his own witness had come forward from her own wilful perversity and in direct defiance of his advice.  It was a dismal afternoon, and the witness-box at the Old Bailey is so situated that evidence is given with the back to the light; thus, though her heavy veil was raised at last, and it could be seen that she was very pale, it was not yet that Rachel Minchin afforded a chance to the lightning artists of the half-penny press, or even to the students of physiognomy behind the man with "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/126"],["title","The Poison Belt (#1)"],["body","to the hat-ribbons of some young and ambitious cricket club.  He pointed out to me that there were certain black lines which formed crossbars upon the series of brilliant colours extending from the red at one end through gradations of orange, yellow, green, blue, and indigo to the violet at the other.  \"Those dark bands are Fraunhofer's lines,\" said he.  \"The colours are just light itself.  Every light, if you can split it up with a prism, gives the same colours.  They tell us nothing.  It is the lines that count, because they vary according to what it may be that produces the light.  It is these lines that have been blurred instead of clear this last week, and all the astronomers have been quarreling over the reason. Here's a photograph of the blurred lines for our issue to-morrow.  The public have taken no interest in the matter up to now, but this letter of Challenger's in the Times will make them wake up, I'm thinking.\"  \"And this about Sumatra?\"  \"Well, it's a long cry from a blurred line in a spectrum to a sick nigger in Sumatra.  And yet the chiel has shown us once before that he knows what he's talking about.  There is some queer illness down yonder, that's beyond all doubt, and to-day there's a cable just come in from Singapore that the lighthouses are out of action in the Straits of Sundan, and two ships on the beach in consequence.  Anyhow, it's good enough for you to interview Challenger upon.  If you get anything definite, let us have a column by Monday.\"  I was coming out from the news editor's room, turning over my new mission in my mind, when I heard my name called from the waiting-room below.  It was a telegraph-boy with a wire which had been forwarded from my lodgings at Streatham.  The message was from the very man we had been discussing, and ran thus:--  Malone, 17, Hill Street, Streatham.--Bring oxygen.--Challenger.  \"Bring oxygen!\"  The Professor, as I remembered him, had an elephantine sense of humour capable of the most clumsy and unwieldly gambollings. Was this one of those jokes which used to reduce him to uproarious laughter, when his eyes would disappear and he was all gaping mouth and wagging beard, supremely indifferent to the gravity of all around him?  I turned the words over, but could make nothing even remotely jocose out of them.  Then surely it was a concise order--though a very strange one.  He was the last man in the world whose deliberate command I should care to disobey.  Possibly some chemical experiment was afoot; possibly----Well, it was no business of mine to speculate upon why he wanted it.  I must get it.  There was nearly an hour before I should catch the train at Victoria.  I took a taxi, and having ascertained the address from the telephone book, I made for the Oxygen Tube Supply Company in Oxford Street.  As I alighted on the pavement at my destination, two youths emerged from the door of the establishment carrying an iron cylinder, which, with some trouble, they hoisted into a waiting motor-car.  An elderly man was at their heels scolding and directing in a creaky, sardonic voice.  He turned towards me.  There was no mistaking those austere features and that goatee beard.  It was my old cross-grained companion, Professor Summerlee.  \"What!\" he cried.  \"Don't tell me that _you_ have had one of these preposterous telegrams for oxygen?\"  I exhibited it.  \"Well, well!  I have had one too, and, as you see, very much against the grain, I have acted upon it.  Our good friend is as impossible as ever. The need for oxygen could not have been so urgent that he must desert the usual means of supply and encroach upon the time of those who are really busier than himself.  Why could he not order it direct?\"  I could only suggest that he probably wanted it at once.  \"Or thought he did, which is quite another matter.  But it is superfluous now for you to purchase any, since I have this considerable supply.\"  \"Still, for some reason he seems to wish that I should bring oxygen too. It will be safer to do exactly what he tells me.\"  Accordingly, in spite of many grumbles and remonstrances from Summerlee, I ordered an additional tube, which was placed with the other in his motor-car, for he had offered me a lift to Victoria.  I turned away to pay off my taxi, the driver of which was very cantankerous and abusive over his fare.  As I came back to Professor Summerlee, he was having a furious altercation with the men who had carried down the oxygen, his little white goat's beard jerking with indignation.  One of the fellows called him, I remember, \"a silly old bleached cockatoo,\" which so enraged his chauffeur that he bounded out of his seat to take the part of his insulted master, and it was all we could do to prevent a riot in the street.  These little things may seem trivial to relate, and passed as mere incidents at the time.  It is only now, as I look back, that I see their relation to the whole story which I have to unfold.  The chauffeur must, as it seemed to me, have been a novice or else have lost his nerve in this disturbance, for he drove vilely on the way to the station.  Twice we nearly had collisions with other equally erratic vehicles, and I remember remarking to Summerlee that the standard of driving in London had very much declined.  Once we brushed the very edge of a great crowd which was watching a fight at the corner of the Mall. The people, who were much excited, raised cries of anger at the clumsy driving, and one fellow sprang upon the step and waved a stick above our heads.  I pushed him off, but we were glad when we had got clear of them and safe out of the park.  These little events, coming one after the other, left me very jangled in my nerves, and I could see from my companion's petulant manner that his own patience had got to a low ebb.  But our good humour was restored when we saw Lord John Roxton waiting for us upon the platform, his tall, thin figure clad in a yellow tweed shooting-suit.  His keen face, with those unforgettable eyes, so fierce and yet so humorous, flushed with pleasure at the sight of us.  His ruddy hair was shot with grey, and the furrows upon his brow had been cut a little deeper by Time's chisel, but in all else he was the Lord John who had been our good comrade in the past.  \"Hullo, Herr Professor!  Hullo, young fella!\" he shouted as he came toward us.  He roared with amusement when he saw the oxygen cylinders upon the porter's trolly behind us.  \"So you've got them too!\" he cried.  \"Mine is in the van.  Whatever can the old dear be after?\"  \"Have you seen his letter in the Times?\" I asked.  \"What was it?\"  \"Stuff and nonsense!\" said Summerlee harshly.  \"Well, it's at the bottom of this oxygen business, or I am mistaken,\" said I.  \"Stuff and nonsense!\" cried Summerlee again with quite unnecessary violence.  We had all got into a first-class smoker, and he had already lit the short and charred old briar pipe which seemed to singe the end of his long, aggressive nose.  \"Friend Challenger is a clever man,\" said he with great vehemence.  \"No one can deny it.  It's a fool that denies it.  Look at his hat.  There's a sixty-ounce brain inside it--a big engine, running smooth, and turning out clean work.  Show me the engine-house and I'll tell you the size of the engine.  But he is a born charlatan--you've heard me tell him so to his face--a born charlatan, with a kind of dramatic trick of jumping into the limelight.  Things are quiet, so friend Challenger sees a chance to set the public talking about him.  You don't imagine that he seriously believes all this nonsense about a change in the ether and a danger to the human race?  Was ever such a cock-and-bull story in this life?\"  He sat like an old white raven, croaking and shaking with sardonic laughter.  A wave of anger passed through me as I listened to Summerlee.  It was disgraceful that he should speak thus of the leader who had been the source of all our fame and given us such an experience as no men have ever enjoyed.  I had opened my mouth to utter some hot retort, when Lord John got before me.  \"You had a scrap once before with old man Challenger,\" said he sternly, \"and you were down and out inside ten seconds.  It seems to me, Professor Summerlee, he's beyond your class, and the best you can do with him is to walk wide and leave him alone.\"  \"Besides,\" said I, \"he has been a good friend to every one of us. Whatever his faults may be, he is as straight as a line, and I don't believe he ever speaks evil of his comrades behind their backs.\"  \"Well said, young fellah-my-lad,\" said Lord John Roxton.  Then, with a kindly smile, he slapped Professor Summerlee upon his shoulder.  \"Come, Herr Professor, we're not going to quarrel at this time of day.  We've seen too much together.  But keep off the grass when you get near Challenger, for this young fellah and I have a bit of a weakness for the old dear.\"  But Summerlee was in no humour for compromise.  His face was screwed up in rigid disapproval, and thick curls of angry smoke rolled up from his pipe.  \"As to you, Lord John Roxton,\" he creaked, \"your opinion upon a matter of science is of as much value in my eyes as my views upon a new type of shot-gun would be in yours.  I have my own judgment, sir, and I use it in my own way.  Because it has misled me once, is that any reason why I should accept without criticism anything, however far-fetched, which this man may care to put forward?  Are we to have a Pope of science, with infallible decrees laid down _ex cathedra_, and accepted without question by the poor humble public?  I tell you, sir, that I have a brain of my own and that I should feel myself to be a snob and a slave if I did not use it.  If it pleases you to believe this rigmarole about ether and Fraunhofer's lines upon the spectrum, do so by all means, but do not ask one who is older and wiser than yourself to share in your folly.  Is it not evident that if the ether were affected to the degree which he maintains, and if"]]]
