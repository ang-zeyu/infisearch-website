The foreign manufacturer appreciates the advantage of having it said that his eight horse-power machine will run faster and climb better than the eight horsepower machine of a rival maker; hence the tendency to increase the power without changing the nominal rating. The American manufacturer caters to the demand of his customers for machines of high power by advancing the nominal rating quite beyond the power actually developed.  But already things are changing here, and makers show a disposition to rate their machines low, for the sake of astonishing in performance. A man dislikes to admit his machine is rated at forty horse-power and to acknowledge defeat by a machine rated at twenty, when the truth is that each machine is probably about thirty.  The tendency at the present moment is decidedly towards the French type,--two or four cylinders placed in front.  In the construction of racing-cars and high-speed machines for such roads as they have on the other side, we have much to learn from the French,--and we have been slow in learning it. The conceit of the American mechanic amounts often to blind stubbornness, but the ease with which the foreign machines have passed the American in all races on smooth roads has opened the eyes of our builders; the danger just now is that they will go to the other extreme and copy too blindly.  In the hands of experts, the foreign racing-cars are the most perfect road locomotives yet devised; for touring over American roads in the hands of the amateur they are worse than useless; and even experts have great difficulty in running week in and week out without serious breaks and delays. To use a slang phrase, \"They will not stand the racket.\" However \"stunning\" they look on asphalt and macadam with their low, rakish bodies, resplendent in red and polished brass, on country roads they are very frequently failures. A thirty horse-power foreign machine costing ten or twelve thousand dollars, accompanied by one or more expert mechanics, may make a brilliant showing for a week or so; but when the time is up, the ordinary, cheap, country-looking, American automobile will be found a close second at the finish; not that it is a finer piece of machinery, for it is not; but it has been developed under the adverse conditions prevailing in this country and is built to surmount them. The maker in this country who runs his machine one hundred miles from his factory, would find fewer difficulties between Paris and Berlin.  The temptation is great to purchase a foreign machine on sight; resist the temptation until you have ridden in it over a hundred miles of sandy, clayey, and hilly American roads; you may then defer the purchase indefinitely, unless you expect to carry along a man.  Machine for machine, regardless of price, the comparison is debatable; but price for price, there is no comparison whatsoever; in fact, there is no inexpensive imported machine which compares for a moment with the American product.  A single-cylinder motor possesses a few great advantages to compensate for many disadvantages; it has fewer parts to get out of order, and troubles can be much more quickly located and overcome. Two, three, and four cylinders run with less vibration and are better in every way, except that with every cylinder added the chances of troubles are multiplied, and the difficulty of locating them increased. Each cylinder must have its own lubrication, its ignition, intake, and exhaust mechanisms,--the quartette that is responsible for nine-tenths of the stops.  Beyond eight or ten horse-power the single cylinder is hardly practicable. The kick from the explosion is too violent, the vibration and strain too great, and power is lost in transmission. But up to eight or ten horse-power the single-cylinder motor with a heavy fly-wheel is practicable, runs very smoothly at high speeds, mounts hills and ploughs mud quite successfully. The American ten horse-power single-cylinder motor will go faster and farther on our roads than most foreign double-cylinder machines of the same horse-power. It will last longer and require less repairs.  The amateur who is not a pretty good mechanic and who wishes to tour without the assistance of an expert will do well to use the single-cylinder motor; he will have trouble enough with that without seeking further complications by the adoption of multiple cylinders.  It is quite practicable to attain speeds of from twenty to thirty miles per hour with a single-cylinder motor, but for bad roads and hilly countries a low gear with a maximum of twenty to twenty-five miles per hour is better. The average for the day will be higher because better speed is maintained through heavy roads and on up grades.  So far as resiliency is concerned, there is no comparison between the French double-tube tire and the heavy American single tube, --the former is far ahead, and is, of course, easily repaired on the road, but it does not seem to stand the severe wear of American roads, and it is very easily punctured. Our highways both in and out of cities are filled with things that cut, and bristle with wire-nails. The heavy American single-tube tire holds out quite well; it gets many deep cuts and takes nails like a pin-cushion, but comparatively few go through. The weight of the tire makes it rather hard riding, very hard, indeed, as compared with a fine Michelin.  There are many devices for carrying luggage, but for getting a good deal into a small compass there is nothing equal to a big Scotch hold-all. It is waterproof to begin with, and holds more than a small steamer-trunk. It can be strapped in or under the machine anywhere. Trunks and hat-boxes may remain with the express companies, always within a few hours' call.  What to wear is something of a problem. In late autumn and winter fur is absolutely essential to comfort. Even at fifteen or twenty miles an hour the wind is penetrating and goes through everything but the closest of fur. For women, fur or leather-lined coats are comfortable even when the weather seems still quite warm.  Leather coats are a great protection against both cold and dust. Unhappily, most people who have no machines of their own, when invited to ride, have nothing fit to wear; they dress too thinly, wear hats that blow off, and they altogether are, and look, quite unhappy--to the great discomfort of those with them. It is not a bad plan to have available one or two good warm coats for the benefit of guests, and always carry water-proof coats and lap-covers. In emergency, thin black oil-cloth, purchasable at any country store, makes a good water-proof covering.  Whoever is running a machine must be prepared for  emergencies, for at any moment it may be necessary to get underneath.  The man who is going to master his own machine must expect to get dirty; dust, oil, and grime plentifully distributed,--but dirt is picturesque, even if objectionable. Character is expressed in dirt; the bright and shining school-boy face is devoid of interest, an artificial product, quite unnatural; the smutty street urchin is an actor on life's stage, every daub, spot, and line an essential part of his make-up.  The spic and span may go well with a coach and four, but not with the automobile. Imagine an engineer driving his locomotive in blue coat, yellow waistcoat, and ruffles,--quite as appropriate as a fastidious dress on the automobile.  People are not yet quite accustomed to the grime of automobiling; they tolerate the dust of the golf links, the dirt of base-ball and cricket, the mud of foot-ball, and would ridicule the man who failed to dress appropriately for those games, but the mechanic's blouse or leather coat of automobiling, the gloves saturated with oil--these are comparatively unfamiliar sights; hence men are seen starting off for a hard run in ducks and serges, sacks, cutaways, even frocks, and hats of all styles; give a farmer a silk hat and patent leather boots to wear while threshing, and he would match them.  Every sport has its own appropriate costume, and the costume is not the result of arbitrary choice, but of natural selection; if we hunt, fish, or play any outdoor game, sooner or later we find ourselves dressing like our associates. The tenderfoot may put on his cowboy's suit a little too soon and look and be very uncomfortable, but the costume is essential to success in the long run.  The Russian cap so commonly seen is an affectation,--it catches the wind and is far from comfortable. The best head covering is a closely fitting Scotch cap.     CHAPTER THREE  THE START \"IS THIS ROAD TO--\"  The trip was not premeditated--it was not of malice aforethought; it was the outcome of an idle suggestion made one hot summer afternoon, and decided upon in the moment. Within the same half-hour a telegram was sent the Professor inviting him for a ride to Buffalo. Beyond that point there was no thought,--merely a nebulous notion that might take form if everything went well.  Hampered by no announcements, with no record to make or break, the trip was for pleasure,--a mid-summer jaunt. We did intend to make the run to Buffalo as fast as roads would permit,--but for exhilaration only, and not with any thought of making a record that would stand against record-making machines, driven by record-breaking men.  It is much better to start for nowhere and get there than to start for somewhere and fall by the wayside. Just keep going, and the machine will carry you beyond your expectations.  The Professor knew nothing about machinery and less about an automobile, but where ignorance is bliss it is double-distilled folly to know anything about the eccentricities of an automobile.  To enjoy automobiling, one must know either all or nothing about the machine,--a little knowledge is a dangerous thing; on the part of the guest it leads to all sorts of apprehensions, on the part of the chauffeur to all sorts of experiments.

On they came: they yelped, and fired;     His spirit sped; We leveled right in, and the half-breeds fled,     Nor stayed the iron, Nor captured the crimson corse of Lyon.  This seer foresaw his soldier-doom,     Yet willed the fight. He never turned; his only flight     Was up to Zion, Where prophets now and armies greet brave Lyon.    Ball’s Bluff. A Reverie. (October, 1861.)   One noonday, at my window in the town,   I saw a sight--saddest that eyes can see--   Young soldiers marching lustily       Unto the wars, With fifes, and flags in mottoed pageantry;     While all the porches, walks, and doors Were rich with ladies cheering royally.  They moved like Juny morning on the wave,   Their hearts were fresh as clover in its prime   (It was the breezy summer time),       Life throbbed so strong, How should they dream that Death in a rosy clime     Would come to thin their shining throng? Youth feels immortal, like the gods sublime.  Weeks passed; and at my window, leaving bed,   By night I mused, of easeful sleep bereft,   On those brave boys (Ah War! thy theft);       Some marching feet Found pause at last by cliffs Potomac cleft;     Wakeful I mused, while in the street Far footfalls died away till none were left.    Dupont’s Round Fight. (November, 1861.)   In time and measure perfect moves   All Art whose aim is sure; Evolving ryhme and stars divine   Have rules, and they endure.  Nor less the Fleet that warred for Right,   And, warring so, prevailed, In geometric beauty curved,   And in an orbit sailed.  The rebel at Port Royal felt   The Unity overawe, And rued the spell. A type was here,   And victory of Law.    The Stone Fleet.[2] An Old Sailor’s Lament. (December, 1861.)   I have a feeling for those ships,   Each worn and ancient one, With great bluff bows, and broad in the beam;   Ay, it was unkindly done.       But so they serve the Obsolete--       Even so, Stone Fleet!  You’ll say I’m doting; do but think   I scudded round the Horn in one-- The Tenedos, a glorious   Good old craft as ever run--       Sunk (how all unmeet!)       With the Old Stone Fleet.  An India ship of fame was she,   Spices and shawls and fans she bore; A whaler when her wrinkles came--   Turned off! till, spent and poor,       Her bones were sold (escheat)!       Ah! Stone Fleet.  Four were erst patrician keels   (Names attest what families be), The Kensington, and Richmond too,   Leonidas, and Lee:       But now they have their seat       With the Old Stone Fleet.  To scuttle them--a pirate deed--   Sack them, and dismast; They sunk so slow, they died so hard,   But gurgling dropped at last.       Their ghosts in gales repeat       _Woe’s us, Stone Fleet!_  And all for naught. The waters pass--   Currents will have their way; Nature is nobody’s ally; ’tis well;   The harbor is bettered--will stay.       A failure, and complete,       Was your Old Stone Fleet.    Donelson. (February, 1862.)   The bitter cup   Of that hard countermand Which gave the Envoys up, Still was wormwood in the mouth,   And clouds involved the land, When, pelted by sleet in the icy street,   About the bulletin-board a band Of eager, anxious people met, And every wakeful heart was set On latest news from West or South. “No seeing here,” cries one--“don’t crowd--” “You tall man, pray you, read aloud.”  IMPORTANT.     _We learn that General Grant,   Marching from Henry overland, And joined by a force up the Cumberland sent   (Some thirty thousand the command), On Wednesday a good position won-- Began the siege of Donelson.  The stronghold crowns a river-bluff,   A good broad mile of leveled top; Inland the ground rolls off   Deep-gorged, and rocky, and broken up-- A wilderness of trees and brush.   The spaded summit shows the roods Of fixed intrenchments in their hush;   Breast-works and rifle-pits in woods Perplex the base.--                    The welcome weather   Is clear and mild; ’tis much like May. The ancient boughs that lace together Along the stream, and hang far forth,   Strange with green mistletoe, betray A dreamy contrast to the North.  Our troops are full of spirits--say   The siege won’t prove a creeping one. They purpose not the lingering stay Of old beleaguerers; not that way;   But, full of _vim_ from Western prairies won,   They’ll make, ere long, a dash at Donelson._  Washed by the storm till the paper grew Every shade of a streaky blue, That bulletin stood. The next day brought A second.   LATER FROM THE FORT. _Grant’s investment is complete--     A semicircular one. Both wings the Cumberland’s margin meet, Then, backwkard curving, clasp the rebel seat.   On Wednesday this good work was done;   But of the doers some lie prone. Each wood, each hill, each glen was fought for; The bold inclosing line we wrought for Flamed with sharpshooters. Each cliff cost A limb or life. But back we forced Reserves and all; made good our hold; And so we rest.                 Events unfold. On Thursday added ground was won,   A long bold steep: we near the Den. Later the foe came shouting down   In sortie, which was quelled; and then We stormed them on their left. A chilly change in the afternoon; The sky, late clear, is now bereft Of sun. Last night the ground froze hard-- Rings to the enemy as they run Within their works. A ramrod bites The lip it meets. The cold incites To swinging of arms with brisk rebound. Smart blows ’gainst lusty chests resound.  Along the outer line we ward   A crackle of skirmishing goes on. Our lads creep round on hand and knee,   They fight from behind each trunk and stone;   And sometimes, flying for refuge, one Finds ’tis an enemy shares the tree. Some scores are maimed by boughs shot off   In the glades by the Fort’s big gun.   We mourn the loss of colonel Morrison,   Killed while cheering his regiment on. Their far sharpshooters try our stuff; And ours return them puff for puff: ’Tis diamond-cutting-diamond work.   Woe on the rebel cannoneer Who shows his head. Our fellows lurk   Like Indians that waylay the deer By the wild salt-spring.--The sky is dun, Fordooming the fall of Donelson.  Stern weather is all unwonted here.   The people of the country own We brought it. Yea, the earnest North Has elementally issued forth   To storm this Donelson._  FURTHER.          A yelling rout Of ragamuffins broke profuse   To-day from out the Fort.   Sole uniform they wore, a sort Of patch, or white badge (as you choose)   Upon the arm. But leading these, Or mingling, were men of face And bearing of patrician race, Splendid in courage and gold lace--   The officers. Before the breeze Made by their charge, down went our line; But, rallying, charged back in force, And broke the sally; yet with loss. This on the left; upon the right Meanwhile there was an answering fight;   Assailants and assailed reversed. The charge too upward, and not down-- Up a steep ridge-side, toward its crown,   A strong redoubt. But they who first Gained the fort’s base, and marked the trees Felled, heaped in horned perplexities,   And shagged with brush; and swarming there Fierce wasps whose sting was present death-- They faltered, drawing bated breath,   And felt it was in vain to dare; Yet still, perforce, returned the ball, Firing into the tangled wall Till ordered to come down. They came; But left some comrades in their fame, Red on the ridge in icy wreath And hanging gardens of cold Death.   But not quite unavenged these fell; Our ranks once out of range, a blast   Of shrapnel and quick shell Burst on the rebel horde, still massed,   Scattering them pell-mell.     (This fighting--judging what we read--     Both charge and countercharge,     Would seem but Thursday’s told at large,     Before in brief reported.--Ed.) Night closed in about the Den   Murky and lowering. Ere long, chill rains. A night not soon to be forgot,   Reviving old rheumatic pains And longings for a cot.    No blankets, overcoats, or tents. Coats thrown aside on the warm march here-- We looked not then for changeful cheer; Tents, coats, and blankets too much care.   No fires; a fire a mark presents;   Near by, the trees show bullet-dents. Rations were eaten cold and raw.   The men well soaked, come snow; and more-- A midnight sally. Small sleeping done--     But such is war; No matter, we’ll have Fort Donelson._            “Ugh! ugh! ’Twill drag along--drag along” Growled a cross patriot in the throng, His battered umbrella like an ambulance-cover Riddled with bullet-holes, spattered all over. “Hurrah for Grant!” cried a stripling shrill; Three urchins joined him with a will, And some of taller stature cheered. Meantime a Copperhead passed; he sneered.   “Win or lose,” he pausing said, “Caps fly the same; all boys, mere boys; Any thing to make a noise.   Like to see the list of the dead; These ‘_craven Southerners_’ hold out; Ay, ay, they’ll give you many a bout”   “We’ll beat in the end, sir” Firmly said one in staid rebuke, A solid merchant, square and stout.   “And do you think it? that way tend, sir” Asked the lean Cooperhead, with a look Of splenetic pity. “Yes, I do” His yellow death’s head the croaker shook: “The country’s ruined, that I know” A shower of broken ice and snow,   In lieu of words, confuted him; They saw him hustled round the corner go,   And each by-stander said--Well suited him.  Next day another crowd was seen In the dark weather’s sleety spleen. Bald-headed to the storm came out A man, who, ’mid a joyous shout, Silently posted this brief sheet:  GLORIOUS VICTORY OF THE FLEET!  FRIDAY’S GREAT EVENT!  THE ENEMY’S WATER-BATTERIES BEAT!  WE SILENCED EVERY GUN!  THE OLD COMMODORE’S COMPLIMENTS SENT PLUMP INTO DONELSON!  “Well, well, go on!” exclaimed the crowd To him who thus much read aloud. “That’s all,” he said. “What! nothing more” “Enough for a cheer, though--hip, hurrah!” “But here’s old Baldy come again--” “More news!”--And now a different strain.
