[Footnote A: _Gentleman's Magazine, Supplement, 1763. Extract of a letter wrote from the island of Senegal, by Mr. Boone, practitioner of physic there, to Dr. Brocklesby of London._      \"To form just idea of the unhealthiness of the climate, it will     be necessary to conceive a country extending three hundred     leagues East, and more to the North and South. Through this     country several large rivers empty themselves into the sea;     particularly the Sanaga, Gambia and Sherbro; these, during the     rainy months, which begin in July and continue till October,     overflow their banks, and lay the whole flat country under     water; and indeed, the very sudden rise of these rivers is     incredible to persons who have never been within the tropicks,     and are unacquainted with the violent rains that fall there. At     Galem, nine hundred miles from the mouth of the Sanaga, I am     informed that the waters rise one hundred and fifty feet     perpendicular, from the bed of the river. This information I     received from a gentleman, who was surgeon's mate to a party     sent there, and the only survivor of three captains command,     each consisting of one captain, two lieutenants, one ensign, a     surgeon's mate, three serjeants, three corporals, and fifty     privates.      \"When the rains are at an end, which usually happens in October,     the intense heat of the sun soon dries up the waters which lie     on the higher parts of the earth, and the remainder forms lakes     of stagnated waters, in which are found all sorts of dead     animals. These waters every day decrease, till at last they are     quite exhaled, and then the effluvia that arises is almost     insupportable. At this season, the winds blow so very hot from     off the land, that I can compare them to nothing but the heat     proceeding from the mouth of an oven. This occasions the     Europeans to be sorely vexed with bilious and putrid fevers.     From this account you will not be surprized, that the total loss     of British subjects in this island only, amounted to above two     thousand five hundred, in the space of three years that I was     there, in such a putrid moist air as I have described.\"  ]   [Footnote B: James Barbot, agent general to the French African company, in his account of Africa, page 105, says, \"The natives are seldom troubled with any distempers, being little affected with the unhealthy air. In tempestuous times they keep much within doors; and when exposed to the weather, their skins being suppled, and pores closed by daily anointing with palm oil, the weather can make but little impression on them.\"]  That part of Africa from which the Negroes are sold to be carried into slavery, commonly known by the name of Guinea, extends along the coast three or four thousand miles. Beginning at the river Senegal, situate about the 17th degree of North latitude, being the nearest part of Guinea, as well to Europe as to North America; from thence to the river Gambia, and in a southerly course to Cape Sierra Leona, comprehends a coast of about seven hundred miles; being the same tract for which Queen Elizabeth granted charters to the first traders to that coast: from Sierra Leona, the land of Guinea takes a turn to the eastward, extending that course about fifteen hundred miles, including those several civilians known by name of _the Grain Coast, the Ivory Coast, the Gold Coast, and the Slave Coast, with the large kingdom of Benin_. From thence the land runs southward along the coast about twelve hundred miles, which contains the _kingdoms of Congo and Angola_; there the trade for slaves ends. From which to the southermost Cape of Africa, called the Cape of Good Hope, the country is settled by Caffres and Hottentots, who have never been concerned in the making or selling slaves.  Of the parts which are above described, the first which presents itself to view, is that situate on the great river Senegal, which is said to be navigable more than a thousand miles, and is by travellers described to be very agreeable and fruitful. Andrew Brue, principal factor for the French African company, who lived sixteen years in that country, after describing its fruitfulness and plenty, near the sea, adds,[A] \"The farther you go from the sea, the country on the river seems the more fruitful and well improved; abounding with Indian corn, pulse, fruit, &c. Here are vast meadows, which feed large herds of great and small cattle, and poultry numerous: The villages that lie thick on the river, shew the country is well peopled.\" The same author, in the account of a voyage he made up the river Gambia, the mouth of which lies about three hundred miles South of the Senegal, and is navigable about six hundred miles up the country, says,[B] \"That he was surprized to see the land so well cultivated; scarce a spot lay unimproved; the low lands, divided by small canals, were all formed with rice, &c. the higher ground planted with millet, Indian corn, and pease of different sorts; their beef excellent; poultry plenty, and very cheap, as well as all other necessaries of life.\" Francis Moor, who was sent from England about the year 1735, in the service of the African company, and resided at James Fort, on the river Gambia, or in other factories on that river, about five years, confirms the above account of the fruitfulness of the country. William Smith, who was sent in the year 1726, by the African company, to survey their settlements throughout the whole coast of Guinea[C] says, \"The country about the Gambia is pleasant and fruitful; provisions of all kinds being plenty and exceeding cheap.\" The country on and between the two above-mentioned rivers is large and extensive, inhabited principally by those three Negro nations known by the name of Jalofs, Fulis, and Mandingos. The Jalofs possess the middle of the country. The Fulis principal settlement is on both sides of the Senegal; great numbers of these people are also mixed with the Mandingos; which last are mostly settled on both sides the Gambia. The government of the Jalofs is represented as under a better regulation than can be expected from the common opinion we entertain of the Negroes. We are told in the Collection,[D] \"That the King has under him several ministers of state, who assist him in the exercise of justice. _The grand Jerafo_ is the chief justice thro' all the King's dominions, and goes in circuit from time to time to hear complaints, and determine controversies. _The King's treasurer_ exercises the same employment, and has under him Alkairs, who are governors of towns or villages. That the _Kondi_, or _Viceroy_, goes the circuit with the chief justice, both to hear causes, and inspect into the behaviour of the _Alkadi_, or chief magistrate of every village in their several districts[E].\" _Vasconcelas_, an author mentioned in the collection, says, \"The ancientest are preferred to be the _Prince's counsellors_, who keep always about his person; and the men of most judgment and experience are the judges.\" _The Fulis_ are settled on both sides of the river _Senegal_: Their country, which is very fruitful and populous, extends near four hundred miles from East to West. They are generally of a deep tawny complexion, appearing to bear some affinity with the Moors, whose country they join on the North. They are good farmers, and make great harvest of corn, cotton, tobacco, &c. and breed great numbers of cattle of all kinds. _Bartholomew Stibbs_, (mentioned by _Fr. Moor_) in his account of that country says,[F] \"_They were a cleanly, decent, industrious people, and very affable_.\" But the most particular account we have, of these people, is from _Francis Moor_ himself, who says,[G] \"Some of these Fuli blacks who dwell on both sides the river Gambia, are in subjection to the Mandingos, amongst whom they dwell, having been probably driven out of their country by war or famine. They have chiefs of their own, who rule with much moderation. Few of them will drink brandy, or any thing stronger than water and sugar, being strict Mahometans. Their form of government goes on easy, because the people are of a good quiet disposition, and so well instructed in what is right, that a man who does ill, is the abomination of all, and, none will support him against the chief. In these countries, the natives are not covetous of land, desiring no more than what they use; and as they do not plough with horses and cattle, they can use but very little, therefore the Kings are willing to give the Fulis leave to live in their country, and cultivate their lands. If any of their people are known to be made slaves, all the Fulis will join to redeem them; they also support the old, the blind, and lame, amongst themselves; and as far as their abilities go, they supply the necessities of the Mandingos, great numbers of whom they have maintained in famine.\" _The author_, from his own observations, says, \"They were rarely angry, and that he never heard them abuse one another.\"  [Footnote A: Astley's collect. vol. 2. page 46.]   [Footnote B: Astley's collection of voyages, vol. 2, page 86.]   [Footnote C: William Smith's voyage to Guinea, page 31, 34.]   [Footnote D: Astley's collection, vol. 2, page 358.]   [Footnote E: Idem. 259.]   [Footnote F: Moor's travels into distant parts of Africa, page 198.]   [Footnote G: Ibid, page 21.]  _The Mandingos_ are said by _A. Brue_ before mentioned, \"To be the most numerous nation on the Gambia, besides which, numbers of them are dispersed over all these countries; being the most rigid Mahometans amongst the Negroes, they drink neither wine nor brandy, and are politer than the other Negroes. The chief of the trade goes through their hands. Many are industrious and laborious, keeping their ground well cultivated, and breeding a good stock of cattle.[A] Every town "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11489"],["title","Some Historical Account of Guinea, Its Situation, Produce, and the General (#2)"],["body","an _Alkadi_, or _Governor_, who has great power; for most of them having two common fields of clear ground, one for corn, and the other for rice, _the Alkadi_ appoints the labour of all the people. The men work the corn ground, and the women and girls the rice ground; and as they all equally labour, so he equally divides the corn amongst them; and in case they are in want, the others supply them. This Alkadi decides all quarrels, and has the first voice in all conferences in town affairs.\" Some of these Mandingos who are settled at Galem, far up the river Senegal, can read and write Arabic tolerably, and are a good hospitable people, who carry on a trade with the inland nations.\"[B] They are extremely populous in those parts, their women being fruitful, and they not suffering any person amongst them, but such as are guilty of crimes, to be made slaves.\" We are told from Jobson,\"[C] That the Mahometan Negroes say their prayers thrice a day. Each village has a priest who calls them to their duty. It is surprizing (says the author) as well as commendable, to see the modesty, attention, and reverence they observe during their worship. He asked some of their priests the purport of their prayers and ceremonies; their answer always was, _That they adored God by prostrating themselves before him; that by humbling themselves, they acknowledged their own insignificancy, and farther intreated him to forgive their faults, and to grant them all good and necessary things as well as deliverance from evil.\"_ Jobson takes notice of several good qualities in these Negroe priests, particularly their great sobriety. They gain their livelihood by keeping school for the education of the children. The boys are taught to read and write. They not only teach school, but rove about the country, teaching and instructing, for which the whole country is open to them; and they have a free course through all places, though the Kings may be at war with one another.  [Footnote A: Astley's collect. vol. 2, page 269.]   [Footnote B: Astley's collect. vol. 2, page 73.]   [Footnote C: Ibid, 296.]  The three fore-mentioned nations practise several trades, as smiths, potters, sadlers, and weavers. Their smiths particularly work neatly in gold and silver, and make knifes, hatchets, reaping hooks, spades and shares to cut iron, &c. &c. Their potters make neat tobacco pipes, and pots to boil their food. Some authors say that weaving is their principal trade; this is done by the women and girls, who spin and weave very fine cotton cloth, which they dye blue or black.[A] F. Moor says, the Jalofs particularly make great quantities of the cotton cloth; their pieces are generally twenty-seven yards long, and about nine inches broad, their looms being very narrow; these they sew neatly together, so as to supply the use of broad cloth.  [Footnote A: F. Moor, 28.]  It was in these parts of Guinea, that M. Adanson, correspondent of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris, mentioned in some former publications, was employed from the year 1749, to the year 1753, wholly in making _natural_ and _philosophical_ observations on the country about the rivers Senegal and Gambia. Speaking of the great heats in Senegal, he says,[A] \"It is to them that they are partly indebted for the fertility of their lands; which is so great, that, with little labour and care, there is no fruit nor grain but grow in great plenty.\"  [Footnote A: M. Adanson's voyage to Senegal, &c, page 308.]  Of the soil on the Gambia, he says,[A] \"It is rich and deep, and amazingly fertile; it produces spontaneously, and almost without cultivation, all the necessaries of life, grain, fruit, herbs, and roots. Every thing matures to perfection, and is excellent in its kind.\"[B] One thing, which always surprized him, was the prodigious rapidity with which the sap of trees repairs any loss they may happen to sustain in that country: \"And I was never,\" says he, \"more astonished, than when landing four days after the locusts had devoured all the fruits and leaves, and even the buds of the trees, to find the trees covered with new leaves, and they did not seem to me to have suffered much.\"[C] \"It was then,\" says the same author; \"the fish season; you might see them in shoals approaching towards land. Some of those shoals were fifty fathom square, and the fish crowded together in such a manner, as to roll upon one another, without being able to swim. As soon as the Negroes perceive them coming towards land, they jump into the water with a basket in one hand, and swim with the other. They need only to plunge and to lift up their basket, and they are sure to return loaded with fish.\" Speaking of the appearance of the country, and of the disposition of the people, he says,[D] \"Which way soever I turned mine eyes on this pleasant spot, I beheld a perfect image of pure nature; an agreeable solitude, bounded on every side by charming landscapes; the rural situation of cottages in the midst of trees; the ease and indolence of the Negroes, reclined under the shade of their spreading foliage; the simplicity of their dress and manners; the whole revived in my mind the idea of our first parents, and I seemed to contemplate the world in its primitive state. They are, generally speaking, very good-natured, sociable, and obliging. I was not a little pleased with this my first reception; it convinced me, that there ought to be a considerable abatement made in the accounts I had read and heard every where of the savage character of the Africans. I observed both in Negroes and Moors, great humanity and sociableness, which gave me strong hopes that I should be very safe amongst them, and meet with the success I desired in my enquiries after the curiosities of the country.\"[E] He was agreeably amused with the conversation of the Negroes, their _fables, dialogues_, and _witty stories_ with which they entertain each other alternately, according to their custom. Speaking of the remarks which the natives made to him, with relation to the _stars_ and _planets_, he says, \"It is amazing, that such a rude and illiterate people, should reason so pertinently in regard to those heavenly bodies; there is no manner of doubt, but that with proper instruments, and a good will, they would become _excellent astronomers_.\"  [Footnote A: Idem, page 164.]   [Footnote B: M. Adanson, page 161.]   [Footnote C: Idem, page 171.]   [Footnote D: Ibid, page 54.]   [Footnote E: Adanson, page 252, ibid.]      CHAP. II   _The Ivory Coast_; its soil and produce. The character of the _natives_ misrepresented by some authors. These misrepresentations occasioned by _the Europeans_ having treacherously carried off many of their people. _John Smith, surveyor to the African company_, his observations thereon. _John Snock's_ remarks. _The Gold Coast_ and _Slave Coast_, these have the most _European factories_, and furnish the greatest number of slaves to _the Europeans_. Exceeding fertile. The country of _Axim_, and of _Ante_. Good account of the _inland people_ Great fishery. Extraordinary trade for slaves. _The Slave Coast. The kingdom of Whidah_. Fruitful and pleasant. The natives kind and obliging. Very populous. Keep regular markets and fairs. Good order therein. Murder, adultery, and theft severely punished. The King's revenues. The principal people have an idea of the true God. Commendable care of the poor. Several small governments depend on _plunder_ and the _slave_ trade.  That part of Guinea known by the name of the _Grain_, and _Ivory Coast,_ comes next in course. This coast extends about five hundred miles. The soil appears by account, to be in general fertile, producing abundance of rice and roots; indigo and cotton thrive without cultivation, and tobacco would be excellent, if carefully manufactured; they have fish in plenty; their flocks greatly increase, and their trees are loaded with fruit. They make a cotton cloth, which sells well on the Coast. In a word, the country is rich, and the commerce advantageous, and might be greatly augmented by such as would cultivate the friendship of the natives. These are represented by some writers as a rude, _treacherous people_, whilst several other _authors_ of credit give them a very different character, representing them as _sensible, courteous and the fairest traders on the coast of Guinea_. In the Collection, they are said[A] to be averse to drinking to excess, and such as do, are severely punished by the King's order: On enquiry why there is such a disagreement in the character given of these people, it appears, that though they are naturally inclined to be _kind to strangers_, with whom they are _fond_ of _trading_, yet the _frequent injuries_ done them by Europeans, have occasioned their being _suspicious and shy_. The same cause has been the occasion of the ill treatment they have sometimes given to innocent strangers, who have attempted to trade with them. As the Europeans have no settlement on this part of Guinea, the trade is carried on by signals from the ships, on the appearance of which the natives usually come on board in their canoes, bringing their gold-dust, ivory, &c. which has given opportunity to some villainous Europeans to carry them off with their effects, or retain them on board till a ransom is paid. It is noted by some, that since the European voyagers have carried away several of these people, their mistrust is so great, that it is very difficult to prevail on them to come on board. _William Smith_ remarks,[B] \"As we past along this coast, we very often lay before a town, and fired a gun for the natives to come off, but no soul came near us; at length we learnt by some ships that were trading down the coast, that the natives came seldom on board an English ship, for fear of being detained or carried off; yet last some ventured on board, but if those chanced to spy any arms, they would all immediately take to their canoes, and make the best of their way home.
