Grethel! I want you. Be quick! Haven't you got              out of bed?\"     I ran to the window and said, \"What is it, dear Fritz?\" and he said,              \"I want to tell you that I've changed my mind.     Hans-Wandermann is here, and he says there are real sapphires on the              beach; so I'm off to see what I can find.\"     \"Oh, Fritz!\" I said, \"can't I come too?\" but he said, \"You'd better              not, you'll only be in the way.     You can stop quietly at home with Katerina, and you may have Nickel              too, if he'll stay.\"     But Nickel wouldn't. I give him far more of my cake than Fritz does,              but he likes Fritz better than me.     So dear Katerina and I had breakfast together on the leads under the              old myrtle tree.         THE WILLOW-MAN.       There once was a Willow, and he was very old,     And all his leaves fell off from him, and left him in the cold;     But ere the rude winter could buffet him with snow,     There grew upon his hoary head a crop of Mistletoe.      All wrinkled and furrowed was this old Willow's skin,     His taper fingers trembled, and his arms were very thin;     Two round eyes and hollow, that stared but did not see,     And sprawling feet that never walked, had this most ancient tree.      A Dame who dwelt near was the only one who knew     That every year upon his head the Christmas berries grew;     And when the Dame cut them, she said--it was her whim--     \"A merry Christmas to you, Sir!\" _and left a bit for him_.      \"Oh, Granny dear, tell us,\" the children cried, \"where we     May find the shining Mistletoe that grows upon the tree?\"     At length the Dame told them, but cautioned them to mind     To greet the Willow civilly, _and leave a bit behind_.      \"Who cares,\" said the children, \"for this old Willow-man?     We'll take the Mistletoe, and he may catch us if he can.\"     With rage the ancient Willow shakes in every limb,     For they have taken all, and _have not left a bit for him_!      Then bright gleamed the holly, the Christmas berries shone,     But in the wintry wind without the Willow-man did moan:     \"Ungrateful, and wasteful! the mystic Mistletoe     A hundred years hath grown on me, but never more shall grow.\"      A year soon passed by, and the children came once more,     But not a sprig of Mistletoe the aged Willow bore.     Each slender spray pointed; he mocked them in his glee,     And chuckled in his wooden heart, that ancient Willow-tree.      MORAL.      Oh, children, who gather the spoils of wood and wold,     From selfish greed and wilful waste your little hands withhold.     Though fair things be common, this moral bear in mind,     \"Pick thankfully and modestly, and leave a bit behind.\"         [Illustration]      OUR GARDEN.       The winter is gone; and at first Jack and I were sad,     Because of the snow-man's melting, but now we are glad;     For the spring has come, and it's warm, and we're allowed to garden              in the afternoon;     And summer is coming, and oh, how lovely our flowers will be in June!     We are so fond of flowers, it makes us quite happy to think     Of our beds--all colours--blue, white, yellow, purple, and pink,     Scarlet, lilac, and crimson! And we're fond of sweet scents as well,     And mean to have pinks, roses, sweet peas, mignonette, clove              carnations, musk, and everything good to smell;     Lavender, rosemary, and we should like a lemon-scented verbena, and              a big myrtle tree!     And then if we could get an old \"preserved-ginger\" pot, and some              bay-salt, we could make _pot-pourri_.     Jack and I have a garden, though it's not so large as the big one,              you know;     But whatever can be got to grow in a garden we mean to grow.     We've got Bachelor's Buttons, and London Pride, and Old Man, and              everything that's nice:     And last year Jack sowed green peas for our dolls' dinners, but they              were eaten up by the mice.     And he would plant potatoes in furrows, which made the garden in a              mess,     So this year we mean to have no kitchen-garden but mustard and cress.     One of us plants, and the other waters, but Jack likes the              watering-pot;     And then when my turn comes to water he says it's too hot!     We sometimes quarrel about the garden, and once Jack hit me with              the spade;     So we settled to divide it in two by a path up the middle, and              that's made.     We want some yellow sand now to make the walk pretty, but there's none              about here,     So we mean to get some in the old carpet-bag, if we go to the seaside              this year.     On Monday we went to the wood and got primrose plants and a sucker of              a dog-rose;     It looks like a green stick in the middle of the bed at present; but              wait till it blows!     The primroses were in full flower, and the rose ought to flower soon;     You've no idea how lovely they are in that wood in June!     The primroses look quite withered now, I am sorry to say,     But that is not our fault but Nurse's, and it shows how hard it is to              garden when you can't have your own way.     We planted them carefully, and were just going to water them all in              a lump,     When Nurse fetched us both indoors, and put us to bed for wetting our              pinafores at the pump.     It's very hard, and I'm sure the gardener's plants wouldn't grow any              better than ours,     If Nurse fetched him in and sent him to bed just when he was going to              water his flowers.     We've got Blue Nemophila and Mignonette, and Venus's Looking-glass,              and many other seeds;     The Nemophila comes up spotted, which is how we know it from the weeds.     At least it's sure to come up if the hens haven't scratched it up              first.     But when it is up the cats roll on it, and that is the worst!     I sowed a ring of sweet peas, and the last time I looked they were              coming nicely on,     Just sprouting white, and I put them safely back; but when Jack looked              he found they were gone.     Jack made a great many cuttings, but he has had rather bad luck,     I've looked at them every day myself, and not one of them has struck.     The gardener gave me a fine moss-rose, but Jack took it to his side,     I kept moving it back, but he took it again, and at last it died.     But now we've settled to dig up the path, and have the bed as it was              before,     So everything will belong to us both, and we shan't ever quarrel              any more.     It is such a long time, too, to wait for the sand, and perhaps              sea-sand does best on the shore.     We're going to take everything up, for it can't hurt the plants to              stand on the grass for a minute,     And you really can't possibly rake a bed smooth with so many              things in it.     We shall dig it all over, and get leaf-mould from the wood, and hoe              up the weeds,     And when it's tidy we shall plant, and put labels, and strike cuttings,              and sow seeds.     We are so fond of flowers, Jack and I often dream at night     Of getting up and finding our garden ablaze with all colours, blue,              red, yellow, and white.     And Midsummer's coming, and big brother Tom will sit under the tree     With his book, and Mary will beg sweet nosegays of Jack and me.     The worst is, we often start for the seaside about Midsummer Day,     And no one takes care of our gardens whilst we are away.     But if we sow lots of seeds, and take plenty of cuttings before we              leave home,     When we come back, our flowers will be all in full bloom,     Bright, bright sunshine above, and sweet, sweet flowers below.     Come, oh Midsummer, quickly come! and go quickly, Midsummer, go!      P.S. It is so tiresome! Jack wants to build a green-house now,     He has found some bits of broken glass, and an old window-frame, and              he says he knows how.     I tell him there's not glass enough, but he says there's lots,     And he's taken all the plants that belong to the bed and put              them in pots.         A FRIEND IN THE GARDEN.       He is not John the gardener,       And yet the whole day long     Employs himself most usefully,       The flower-beds among.      He is not Tom the pussy-cat,       And yet the other day,     With stealthy stride and glistening eye,       He crept upon his prey.      He is not Dash the dear old dog,       And yet, perhaps, if you     Took pains with him and petted him,       You'd come to love him too.      He's not a Blackbird, though he chirps,       And though he once was black;     And now he wears a loose grey coat,       All wrinkled on the back.      He's got a very dirty face,       And very shining eyes!     He sometimes comes and sits indoors;       He looks--and p'r'aps is--wise.      But in a sunny flower-bed       He has his fixed abode;     He eats the things that eat my plants--       He is a friendly TOAD.         [Illustration]      THREE LITTLE NEST BIRDS.                 We meant to be very kind,                   But if ever we find     Another soft, grey-green, moss-coated, feather-lined nest in a hedge,               We have taken a pledge--     Susan, Jemmy, and I--with remorseful"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16686"],["title","Verses for Children, and Songs for Music (#2)"],["body",", at this very minute,     That if there are eggs or little birds in it--     Robin or wren, thrush, chaffinch or linnet--                 We'll leave them there                 To their mother's care.     There were three of us--Kate, and Susan, and Jem--                 And three of them--     I don't know _their_ names, for they couldn't speak,     Except with a little imperative squeak,                 Exactly like Poll,                 Susan's squeaking doll;     But squeaking dolls will lie on the shelves     For years and never squeak of themselves:     The reason we like little birds so much better than toys     Is because they are _really_ alive, and know how to make a noise.      There were three of us, and three of them;     Kate,--that is I,--and Susan, and Jem.                 Our mother was busy making a pie,                 And theirs, we think, was up in the sky;     But for all Susan, Jemmy, or I can tell,     She may have been getting their dinner as well.               They were left to themselves (and so were we)               In a nest in the hedge by the willow tree;     And when we caught sight of three red little fluff-tufted, hazel-eyed,              open-mouthed, pink-throated heads, we all shouted for glee.      The way we really did wrong was this:               We took them for Mother to kiss,               And she told us to put them back;     Whilst out on the weeping-willow _their_ mother was crying \"Alack!\"               We really heard     Both what Mother told us to do, and the voice of the mother-bird.               But we three--that is Susan and I and Jem--               Thought we knew better than either of them:     And in spite of our mother's command and the poor bird's cry,     We determined to bring up her three little nestlings ourselves              on the sly.                We each took one,               It did seem such excellent fun!               Susan fed hers on milk and bread,               Jem got wriggling worms for his instead.                   I gave mine meat,     For, you know, I thought, \"Poor darling pet! why shouldn't it have              roast beef to eat?\"     But, oh dear! oh dear! oh dear! how we cried     When in spite of milk and bread and worms and roast beef, the              little birds died!               It's a terrible thing to have heart-ache,               I thought mine would break               As I heard the mother-bird's moan,     And looked at the grey-green, moss-coated, feather-lined nest she had              taken such pains to make,     And her three little children dead, and as cold as stone.               Mother said, and it's sadly true,               \"There are some wrong things one can never undo.\"               And nothing that we could do or say               Would bring life back to the birds that day.      The bitterest tears that we could weep     Wouldn't wake them out of their stiff cold sleep.                               But then,     We--Susan and Jem and I--mean never to be so selfish, and wilful,              and cruel again.     And we three have buried those other three     In a soft, green, moss-covered, flower-lined grave at the foot of              the willow tree.               And all the leaves which its branches shed               We think are tears because they are dead.         DOLLY'S LULLABY.      A NURSERY RHYME       Hush-a-by, Baby! _Your_ baby, Mamma,     No one but pussy may go where you are;     Soft-footed pussy alone may pass by,     For, if he wakens, your baby will cry.      Hush-a-by, Dolly! My baby are you,     Yellow-haired Dolly, with eyes of bright blue;     Though I say \"Hush!\" because Mother does so,     You wouldn't cry like her baby, I know!      Hush-a-by, Baby! Mamma walks about,     Sings to you softly, or rocks you without;     If you slept sounder, then I might walk too,     Sing to my Dolly, and rock her like you!      Hush-a-by Dolly! Sleep sweetly, my pet!     Dear Mamma made you this fine berceaunette,     Muslin and rose-colour, ribbon and lace;     When had a baby a cosier place?      Hush-a-by, Baby! the baby who cries.     Why, dear Mamma, don't you shut baby's eyes?     Pull down his wire, as I do, you see;     Lay him by Dolly, and come out with me.      Hush-a-by, Dolly! Mamma will not speak;     You, my dear baby, would sleep for a week.     Poor Mamma's baby allows her no rest,     Hush-a-by, Dolly, of babies the best!         [Illustration]      A HERO TO HIS HOBBY-HORSE.       Hear me now, my hobby-horse, my steed of prancing paces!     Time is it that you and I won something more than races.     I have got a fine cocked hat, with feathers proudly waving;     Out into the world we'll go, both death and danger braving.      Doubt not that I know the way--the garden-gate is clapping:     Who forgot to lock it last deserves his fingers slapping.     When they find we can't be found, oh won't there be a chorus!     You and I may laugh at that, with all the world before us.      All the world, the great green world that lies beyond the paling!     All the sea, the great round sea where ducks and drakes are sailing!     I a knight, my charger thou, together we will wander     Out into that grassy waste where dwells the Goosey Gander.      Months ago, my faithful steed, that Goose attacked your master;     How it hissed, and how I cried! It ran, but I ran faster!     Down upon my face I fell, its awful wings were o'er me,     Mother came and picked me up, and off to bed she bore me.      Months have passed, my faithful steed, both you and I are older,     Sheathless is my wooden sword, my heart I think is bolder.     Always ready bridled thou, with reins of crimson leather;     Woe betide the Goose to-day who meets us both together!      Up then now, my hobby-horse, my steed of prancing paces!     Time it is that you and I won something more than races.     I a knight, my charger thou, together we will wander     Out into that grassy waste where dwells the Goosey Gander.         THE DOLLS' WASH.       Sally is the laundress, and every Saturday     She sends our clean clothes up from the wash, and Nurse puts them away.     Sometimes Sally is very kind, but sometimes she's as cross as a Turk;     When she's good-humoured we like to go and watch her at work.     She has tubs and a copper in the wash-house, and a great big fire and              plenty of soap;     And outside is the drying-ground with tall posts, and pegs bought from              the gipsies, and long lines of rope.     The laundry is indoors with another big fire, and long tables, and a              lot of irons, and a crimping-machine;     And horses (not live ones with tails, but clothes-horses) and the same              starch that is used by the Queen.     Sally wears pattens in the wash-house, and turns up her sleeves, and              splashes, and rubs,     And makes beautiful white lather which foams over the tops of the tubs,     Like waves at the seaside dashing against the rocks, only not so              strong.     If I were Sally I should sit and blow soap-bubbles all the day long.     Sally is angry sometimes because of the way we dirty our frocks,     Making mud pies, and rolling down the lawn, and climbing trees, and              scrambling over the rocks.     She says we do it on purpose, and never try to take care;     But if things have got to go to the wash, what can it matter how              dirty they are?     Last week Mary and I got a lot of kingcups from the bog, and I              carried them home in my skirt;     It was the end of the week, and our frocks were done, so we didn't              mind about the dirt.     But Sally was as cross as two sticks, and won't wash our dolls'              clothes any more--so she said,--     But never mind, for we'll ask Mamma if we may have a real Dolls'              Wash of our own instead.         *       *       *       *       *      Mamma says we may on one condition, to which we agree;     We're to _really_ wash the dolls' clothes, and make them just              what clean clothes should be.     She says we must wash them thoroughly, which of course we intend to do,     We mean to rub, wring, dry, mangle, starch, iron, and air them too.     A regular wash must be splendid fun, and everybody knows     That any one in the world can wash out a few dirty clothes.         *       *       *       *       *      Well, we've had the Dolls' Wash, but it's only pretty good fun.     We're glad we've had it, you know, but we're gladder still that              it's done.     As we wanted to have as big a wash as we could, we collected              everything we could muster,     From the dolls' bed dimity hangings to Victoria's dress, which I'd              used as a duster.     It was going to the wash, and Mary and I were house-maids--fancy              house-maids, I mean--     And I took it to dust the bookshelf, for I knew it would come back              clean.     Well, we washed in the wash-hand-basin, which holds a good deal, as              the things are small;     We made a glorious lather, and splashed half over the floor; but the              clothes weren't white after all.     However, we hung them out in our drying-ground in the garden, which              we made with dahlia-sticks and long strings,     And then Dash went and knocked over one of the posts, and down in the              dirt went our things!     So we washed them again and hung them on the towel-horse, and most of              them came all right,     But Victoria's muslin dress--though I rinsed it again and again--will              never dry white!     And the grease-spots on Mary's doll's dress don't seem to come out, and              we can't think how they got there;     Unless it was when we made that Macassar-oil, because she has              real hair.     I knew mine was going to the wash, but I'm sorry I used it as a duster              before it "]]]
