Of what variety?\"  \"_Cornus bustabus_, or something like that. Sam, what was the name, do you know?\"  \"That must be something like it, Tom,\" grinned the youngest Rover.  \"Took two men to lift some of those potatoes,\" went on Tom calmly.  \"Two men? Thomas, surely you are joking.\"  \"No, uncle, I am telling nothing but the strict truth.\"  \"But two men! The potatoes must have been of monstrous size!\"  \"Oh, not so very big. But they did weigh a good deal, no question of it.\"  \"Think of two men lifting one potato!\"  \"I didn't say one potato, Uncle Randolph. I said some of those potatoes.\"  \"Eh?\"  \"The men had a barrel full of 'em.\"  \"Thomas!\" The uncle shook his finger threateningly. \"At your old tricks, I see. I might have known it.\" And then he stalked off to hide his chagrin.  \"Tom, that was rather rough on Uncle Randolph,\" said Sam, after a laugh.  \"So it was, Sam. But I've got to do something. This being boxed up, when one might be fishing or swimming, or playing baseball, is simply dreadful,\" answered the other.  Just before the evening meal was announced Jack Ness came up from the barn, and sought out Randolph Rover.  \"Found a man slinking around the cow-shed a while ago,\" he said. \"He looked like a tramp. I wanted to talk to him, but he scooted in double-quick order.\"  \"Humph! We haven't had any tramps here in a long time,\" came from Randolph Rover. \"Where did he go to?\"  \"Down toward the berry patch.\"  \"Did you follow him up?\"  \"I did, sir, but he got away from me.\"  \"You must keep a close watch for those fellows,\" said Randolph Rover bluntly. \"I don't want any of them getting in our barn and burning it down to the ground.\"  \"You are right, Randolph,\" said Anderson Rover. \"Make them keep away from the place by all means, Jack.\"  \"I'll keep my eye peeled for 'em,\" answered the hired man.  The wind was now blowing a gale, causing the trees near the farmhouse to creak and groan, and banging more than one shutter. But the boys did not mind this, and went to bed promptly at the usual hour.  \"A storm like this on land is nothing to one on the sea,\" was the way Tom expressed himself. \"I don't like anything better than to listen to the whistling of the wind when I am snug in bed.\"  For the time being Sam and Tom were occupying a room in the L of the farmhouse, and Dick had a small bedchamber adjoining. The boys were soon undressed, and, having said their prayers, hopped into bed, and were soon sound asleep.  It was not until half an hour later that the older folks retired. Anderson Rover was the last to leave the sitting room, where he had been busy writing some letters at the desk that stood there.  As he was about to retire he fancied he heard a noise outside of one of the windows. He drew up the curtain and looked through the glass, but could see nothing.  \"It must have been the wind,\" he murmured. \"But, somehow, it didn't sound like it.\"  As he stepped into the dark hallway an uneasy feeling took possession of him--a feeling hard to define, and one for which he could not account.  \"I think I had better go around and see that all the doors and windows are properly locked,\" he told himself. \"Brother Randolph may have overlooked one of them.\"  He walked the length of the hallway, and stepped into the kitchen and over to a side window.  As he had his hand on the window-latch he heard a quick step directly behind him.  He started to turn, but before he could do so he received a blow on the head from a club that staggered him. Then he was jerked backward to the floor.  \"Silence!\" muttered a voice close to his ear. \"Don't you dare to make a sound!\"  \"What does this mean--\" he managed to gasp.  \"Silence, I tell you!\" was the short answer. \"If you say another word, I will hit you again!\"  Having no desire to receive a blow that might render him totally unconscious, or, perhaps, take his life, Anderson Rover said no more. He heard a match struck, and then a bit of a tallow candle was lit and placed on the edge of the kitchen table.  By this dim light the father of the Rover boys saw standing over him a tall man, beardless, and with his head closely cropped. One glance into that hardened face sufficed to tell him who the unwelcome visitor was.  \"Arnold Baxter!\"  \"I see you recognize me,\" was the harsh reply. \"Not so loud, please, unless you want that crack I promised you.\"  \"What brings you here, and at such an hour as this?\"  \"I find it more convenient to travel during the night than in the daytime.\"  \"The police are on your track.\"  \"I know that as well you, Rover.\"  \"What do you want here?\"  \"What does any man want when he has been stripped of all his belongings? I want money.\"  \"I have none for you.\"  \"Bosh! Do you think I have forgotten how you and your boys swindled me out of my rights to that mine in the far West?\"  \"We did not swindle you, Baxter. The claim was lawfully mine.\"  \"I can't stop to argue the question, and I don't want you to talk so loud, remember that. No, don't try to get up,\" went on the midnight visitor, as Anderson Rover attempted to rise. \"Stay just where you are.\"  He was feeling in his pocket, and now he brought forth a strip of cloth, with a knot tied in the middle.  It was a gag, and he started to place it in Anderson Rover's mouth, when the latter leaped up and began to struggle with all the force he could command.  \"Stop, I tell you!\" cried Arnold Baxter softly.  \"Stop!\" And then, catching up his club once more, he dealt Anderson Rover another blow, this time directly across the temple. The gentleman wavered for an instant, gave a deep groan, and fell like a log to the floor.     CHAPTER IV  A USELESS PURSUIT   Half an hour later Tom awoke with a start. For the moment he could not tell what had aroused him. Then he remembered hearing the slam of a door or a window sash.  \"Must have been the storm,\" he told himself, and was about to turn over and go to sleep when he heard a gun-shot from the direction of the barn.  \"Something is wrong, that's certain!\" he cried. \"Sam, wake up!\"  \"What's the row, Tom?\" questioned the youngest brother sleepily.  Before Tom could reply they heard Dick getting up, and also their Uncle Randolph and Aunt Martha.  \"What did that shot mean?\" demanded Randolph Rover, coming toward the boys' rooms. \"Did any of you fire it?\"  \"No, it came from outside,\" returned Torn. \"Hark!\"  \"Hullo, in the house!\" came in the voice of Jack Ness. \"Wake up, everybody! Something is wrong!\"  After this it did not take long for those upstairs to slip into some clothing, and go below. Randolph Rover ran to the side door, to find it wide open. Dick lit the hall lamp.  \"Saw a man running across the garden,\" said Jack Ness, who had his shot-gun with him. \"I yelled to him to stop, and then fired the gun. I think he came from the house.\"  \"How did you happen to be up?\" asked Sam.  \"One of the horses is sick, and I was attending to him.\"  By this time some of the others were looking into the various rooms.  \"The desk has been broken open!\" cried Dick. \"And the pantry in the corner, too!\"  \"Mercy, save us!\" shrieked Mrs. Rover, from the kitchen. \"Come here at once. Poor Anderson has been killed!\"  \"Killed!\" gasped Tom; and then all ran to the kitchen as quickly as they could.  They found Anderson Rover lying where he had fallen, and still unconscious. There was a lump on his forehead, and a thin stream of blood trickled down one side of his face.  \"Thank heaven, he is not dead!\" murmured Dick, as he knelt beside his father. \"But he has been struck some cruel blows. Somebody fetch water and a bandage.\"  The water was procured, and also a bandage, and under skillful treatment, Anderson Rover was presently restored to consciousness.  \"Where--where is he?\" he questioned, when he could speak.  \"Do you mean the person who struck you down?\" asked Dick.  \"Ye--yes.\"  \"I don't know. Got away, I guess.\"  \"The villain! He attacked me most foully!\"  \"I saw him running across the garden,\" put in the hired man. \"Did he steal anything?\"  \"To be sure he stole something,\" said Sam. \"He ransacked the whole lower floor, by the looks of things.\"  \"Wonder who it was?\" put in Tom.  \"It was Arnold Baxter,\" answered his father.  \"Arnold Baxter!\" cried the others in chorus.  \"Are you certain?\" asked Dick.  \"Yes. He struck me down, and then lit the bit of tallow candle you see lying there. Then we struggled, and he hit me again, and that is all I know. But I am sure it was Baxter, for I spoke to him. He accused us of having robbed him of that mine out West.\"  \"Was he alone?\" asked Randolph Rover.  \"I saw no one else.\"  \"We ought to follow him up,\" declared Tom, now that he realized his father was not so badly hurt as at first feared.  \"That's the talk!\" ejaculated Dick. \"Wait till I get my pistol.\"  \"Boys, do keep out of harm,\" pleaded Mrs. Rover. \"Remember that this Arnold Baxter is a desperate criminal.\"  \"We are not afraid of him,\" answered Tom.  \"We'll show him that he can't come here and attack father,\" added Sam.  Leaving their father in the care of their Aunt Martha, the three Rover boys armed themselves and sallied forth, accompanied by their uncle and Alexander Pop, the latter carrying a horse-pistol of the old-fashioned variety.  \"Dat dar Baxter am a rascal of de fust water,\" was Aleck's comment. \"He deserbes to be shot full ob holes, an' I am de boy to do dat same, if only I gets de chance.\"  Jack Ness was closely questioned, and he described the spot where he had last seen the unwelcome midnight visitor.  \"He had a bag of something over his shoulder,\" he declared.  \"Most likely the stuff taken from the house,\" declared Dick.  The party crossed the garden patch and then took to the path which ran down toward the river.  Here all was intensely dark, although it had stopped raining, and the wind was trying its best to scatter the heavy clouds that obscured the stars.  \"Not a thing to see,\" observed Randolph Rover. \"We may as well go back.\"  \"Let us scatter and make a search,\" came"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15798"],["title","Clover (#1)"],["body",",--or were before they got to be so hackneyed. I can imagine the first bridal procession up the aisle of some early cathedral as having been perfectly beautiful. But nowadays, when the butcher and baker and candlestick-maker and everybody else do it just alike, the custom seems to me to have lost its charm. I never did enjoy having things exactly as every one else has them,--all going in the same direction like a flock of sheep. I would like my little wedding to be something especially my own. There was a poetical meaning in those old customs; but now that the custom has swallowed up so much of the meaning, it would please me better to retain the meaning and drop the custom.\"  \"I see what you mean,\" said Clover, not quite convinced, but inclined as usual to admire Katy and think that whatever she meant must be right. \"But tell me a little more. You mean to have a wedding-dress, don't you?\" doubtfully.  \"Yes, indeed!\"  \"Have you thought what it shall be?\"  \"Do you recollect that beautiful white crape shawl of mamma's which papa gave me two years ago? It has a lovely wreath of embroidery round it; and it came to me the other day that it would make a charming gown, with white surah or something for the under-dress. I should like that better than anything new, because mamma used to wear it, and it would seem as if she were here still, helping me to get ready. Don't you think so?\"  \"It is a lovely idea,\" said Clover, the ever-ready tears dimming her happy blue eyes for a moment, \"and just like you. Yes, that shall be the dress,--dear mamma's shawl. It will please papa too, I think, to have you choose it.\"  \"I thought perhaps it would,\" said Katy, soberly. \"Then I have a wide white watered sash which Aunt Izzy gave me, and I mean to have that worked into the dress somehow. I should like to wear something of hers too, for she was really good to us when we were little, and all that long time that I was ill; and we were not always good to her, I am afraid. Poor Aunt Izzy! What troublesome little wretches we were,--I most of all!\"  \"Were you? Somehow I never can recollect the time when you were not a born angel. I am afraid I don't remember Aunt Izzy well. I just have a vague memory of somebody who was pretty strict and cross.\"  \"Ah, you never had a back, and needed to be waited on night and day, or you would recollect a great deal more than that. Cousin Helen helped me to appreciate what Aunt Izzy really was. By the way, one of the two things I have set my heart on is to have Cousin Helen come to my wedding.\"  \"It would be lovely if she could. Do you suppose there is any chance?\"  \"I wrote her week before last, but she hasn't answered yet. Of course it depends on how she is; but the accounts from her have been pretty good this year.\"  \"What is the other thing you have set your heart on? You said 'two.'\"  \"The other is that Rose Red shall be here, and little Rose. I wrote to her the other day also, and coaxed hard. Wouldn't it be too enchanting? You know how we have always longed to have her in Burnet; and if she could come now it would make everything twice as pleasant.\"  \"Katy, what an enchanting thought!\" cried Clover, who had not seen Rose since they all left Hillsover. \"It would be the greatest lark that ever was to have the Roses. When do you suppose we shall hear? I can hardly wait, I am in such a hurry to have her say 'Yes.'\"  \"But suppose she says 'No'?\"  \"I won't think of such a possibility. Now go on. I suppose your principles don't preclude a wedding-cake?\"  \"On the contrary, they include a great deal of wedding-cake. I want to send a box to everybody in Burnet,--all the poor people, I mean, and the old people and the children at the Home and those forlorn creatures at the poor-house and all papa's patients.\"  \"But, Katy, that will cost a lot,\" objected the thrifty Clover.  \"I know it; so we must do it in the cheapest way, and make the cake ourselves. I have Aunt Izzy's recipe, which is a very good one; and if we all take hold, it won't be such an immense piece of work. Debby has quantities of raisins stoned already. She has been doing them in the evenings a few at a time for the last month. Mrs. Ashe knows a factory where you can get the little white boxes for ten dollars a thousand, and I have commissioned her to send for five hundred.\"  \"Five hundred! What an immense quantity!\"  \"Yes; but there are all the Hillsover girls to be remembered, and all our kith and kin, and everybody at the wedding will want one. I don't think it will be too many. Oh, I have arranged it all in my mind. Johnnie will slice the citron, Elsie will wash the currants, Debby measure and bake, Alexander mix, you and I will attend to the icing, and all of us will cut it up.\"  \"Alexander!\"  \"Alexander. He is quite pleased with the idea, and has constructed an implement--a sort of spade, cut out of new pine wood--for the purpose. He says it will be a sight easier than digging flower-beds. We will set about it next week; for the cake improves by keeping, and as it is the heaviest job we have to do, it will be well to get it out of the way early.\"  \"Sha'n't you have a floral bell, or a bower to stand in, or something of that kind?\" ventured Clover, timidly.  \"Indeed I shall not,\" replied Katy. \"I particularly dislike floral bells and bowers. They are next worst to anchors and harps and 'floral pillows' and all the rest of the dreadful things that they have at funerals. No, we will have plenty of fresh flowers, but not in stiff arrangements. I want it all to seem easy and to _be_ easy. Don't look so disgusted, Clovy.\"  \"Oh, I'm not disgusted. It's your wedding. I want you to have everything in your own way.\"  \"It's everybody's wedding, I think,\" said Katy, tenderly. \"Everybody is so kind about it. Did you see the thing that Polly sent this morning?\"  \"No. It must have come after I went out. What was it?\"  \"Seven yards of beautiful nun's lace which she bought in Florence. She says it is to trim a morning dress; but it's really too pretty. How dear Polly is! She sends me something almost every day. I seem to be in her thoughts all the time. It is because she loves Ned so much, of course; but it is just as kind of her.\"  \"I think she loves you almost as much as Ned,\" said Clover.  \"Oh, she couldn't do that; Ned is her only brother. There is Amy at the gate now.\"  It was a much taller Amy than had come home from Italy the year before who was walking toward them under the budding locust-boughs. Roman fever had seemed to quicken and stimulate all Amy's powers, and she had grown very fast during the past year. Her face was as frank and childlike as ever, and her eyes as blue; but she was prettier than when she went to Europe, for her cheeks were pink, and the mane of waving hair which framed them in was very becoming. The hair was just long enough now to touch her shoulders; it was turning brown as it lengthened, but the ends of the locks still shone with childish gold, and caught the sun in little shining rings as it filtered down through the tree branches.  She kissed Clover several times, and gave Katy a long, close hug; then she produced a parcel daintily hid in silver paper.  \"Tanta,\" she said,--this was a pet name lately invented for Katy,--\"here is something for you from mamma. It's something quite particular, I think, for mamma cried when she was writing the note; not a hard cry, you know, but just two little teeny-weeny tears in her eyes. She kept smiling, though, and she looked happy, so I guess it isn't anything very bad. She said I was to give it to you with her best, _best_ love.\"  Katy opened the parcel, and beheld a square veil of beautiful old blonde. The note said:      This was my wedding-veil, dearest Katy, and my mother wore it     before me. It has been laid aside all these years with the idea     that perhaps Amy might want it some day; but instead I send it     to you, without whom there would be no Amy to wear this or     anything else. I think it would please Ned to see it on your     head, and I know it would make me very happy; but if you don't     feel like using it, don't mind for a moment saying so to       Your loving                               POLLY.   [Illustration: \"Katy opened the parcel, and beheld a square veil of beautiful old blonde.\"]   Katy handed the note silently to Clover, and laid her face for a little while among the soft folds of the lace, about which a faint odor of roses hung like the breath of old-time and unforgotten loves and affections.  \"Shall you?\" queried Clover, softly.  \"Why, of course! Doesn't it seem too sweet? Both our mothers!\"  \"There!\" cried Amy, \"you are going to cry too, Tanta! I thought weddings were nice funny things. I never supposed they made people feel badly. I sha'n't ever let Mabel get married, I think. But she'll have to stay a little girl always in that case, for I certainly won't have her an old maid.\"  \"What do you know about old maids, midget?\" asked Clover.  \"Why, Miss Clover, I have seen lots of them. There was that one at the Pension Suisse; you remember, Tanta? And the two on the steamer when we came home. And there's Miss Fitz who made my blue frock; Ellen said she was a regular old maid. I never mean to let Mabel be like that.\"  \"I don't think there's the least danger,\" remarked Katy, glancing at the inseparable Mabel, who was perched on Amy's arm, and who did not look a day older than she had done eighteen months previously. \"Amy, we're going to make wedding-cake next week,--heaps and heaps of wedding-cake. Don't you want to come and help?\"  \"Why, of course I do. What fun! Which day may I come?\"  The cake-making did really turn out fun. Many hands made light work of what would have been a formidable job for one or two. It was all done gradually. Johnnie cut the golden citron quarters into thin transparent slices in the sitting-room one morning while the others were sewing, and reading Tennyson aloud. Elsie and Amy made a regular frolic of the currant-washing."]]]
