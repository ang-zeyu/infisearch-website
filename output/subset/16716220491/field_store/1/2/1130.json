I would remark to any impatient reader for mere entertainment, who may find fault with the abundance of Rommany or Gipsy language in the following pages, that _the principal object of the Author was to collect and preserve such specimens of a rapidly-vanishing language_, and that the title-page itself indirectly indicates such an object.  I have, however, invariably given with the Gipsy a translation immediately following the text in plain English--at times very plain--in order that the literal meaning of words may be readily apprehended.  I call especial attention to this fact, so that no one may accuse me of encumbering my pages with Rommany.  While writing this book, or in fact after the whole of the first part was written, I passed a winter in Egypt; and as that country is still supposed by many people to be the fatherland of the Gipsies, and as very little is known relative to the Rommany there, I have taken the liberty of communicating what I could learn on the subject, though it does not refer directly to the Gipsies of England.  Those who are interested in the latter will readily pardon the addition.  There are now in existence about three hundred works on the Gipsies, but of the entire number comparatively few contain fresh material gathered from the Rommany themselves.  Of late years the first philologists of Europe have taken a great interest in their language, which is now included in \"Die Sprachen Europas\" as the only Indian tongue spoken in this quarter of the world; and I believe that English Gipsy is really the only strongly-distinct Rommany dialect which has never as yet been illustrated by copious specimens or a vocabulary of any extent.  I therefore trust that the critical reader will make due allowances for the very great difficulties under which I have laboured, and not blame me for not having done better that which, so far as I can ascertain, would possibly not have been done at all.  Within the memory of man the popular Rommany of this country was really grammatical; that which is now spoken, and from which I gathered the material for the following pages, is, as the reader will observe, almost entirely English as to its structure, although it still abounds in Hindu words to a far greater extent than has been hitherto supposed.     CHAPTER I.  INTRODUCTORY.   The Rommany of the Roads.--The Secret of Vagabond Life in England.--Its peculiar and thoroughly hidden Nature.--Gipsy Character and the Causes which formed it.--Moral Results of hungry Marauding.--Gipsy ideas of Religion.  The Scripture story of the Seven Whistlers.--The Baker's Daughter.--Difficulties of acquiring Rommany.--The Fable of the Cat.--The Chinese, the American Indian, and the Wandering Gipsy.  Although the valuable and curious works of Mr George Borrow have been in part for more than twenty years before the British public, {1} it may still be doubted whether many, even of our scholars, are aware of the remarkable, social, and philological facts which are connected with an immense proportion of our out-of-door population.  There are, indeed, very few people who know, that every time we look from the window into a crowded street, the chances are greatly in favour of the assertion, that we shall see at least one man who bears in his memory some hundreds of Sanscrit roots, and that man English born; though it was probably in the open air, and English bred, albeit his breeding was of the roads.  For go where you will, though you may not know it, you encounter at every step, in one form or the other, _the Rommany_.  True, the dwellers in tents are becoming few and far between, because the \"close cultivation\" of the present generation, which has enclosed nearly all the waste land in England, has left no spot in many a day's journey, where \"the travellers,\" as they call themselves, can light the fire and boil the kettle undisturbed.  There is almost \"no tan to hatch,\" or place to stay in.  So it has come to pass, that those among them who cannot settle down like unto the Gentiles, have gone across the Great Water to America, which is their true Canaan, where they flourish mightily, the more enterprising making a good thing of it, by _prastering graias_ or \"running horses,\" or trading in them, while the idler or more moral ones, pick up their living as easily as a mouse in a cheese, on the endless roads and in the forests.  And so many of them have gone there, that I am sure the child is now born, to whom the sight of a real old-fashioned gipsy will be as rare in England as a Sioux or Pawnee warrior in the streets of New York or Philadelphia.  But there is a modified and yet real Rommany-dom, which lives and will live with great vigour, so long as a regularly organised nomadic class exists on our roads--and it is the true nature and inner life of this class which has remained for ages, an impenetrable mystery to the world at large.  A member of it may be a tramp and a beggar, the proprietor of some valuable travelling show, a horse-dealer, or a tinker.  He may be eloquent, as a Cheap Jack, noisy as a Punch, or musical with a fiddle at fairs.  He may \"peddle\" pottery, make and sell skewers and clothes-pegs, or vend baskets in a caravan; he may keep cock-shys and Aunt Sallys at races.  But whatever he may be, depend upon it, reader, that among those who follow these and similar callings which he represents, are literally many thousands who, unsuspected by the _Gorgios_, are known to one another, and who still speak among themselves, more or less, that curious old tongue which the researches of the greatest living philologists have indicated, is in all probability not merely allied to Sanscrit, but perhaps in point of age, an elder though vagabond sister or cousin of that ancient language.  For THE ROMMANY is the characteristic leaven of all the real tramp life and nomadic callings of Great Britain.  And by this word I mean not the language alone, which is regarded, however, as a test of superior knowledge of \"the roads,\" but a curious _inner life_ and freemasonry of secret intelligence, ties of blood and information, useful to a class who have much in common with one another, and very little in common with the settled tradesman or worthy citizen.  The hawker whom you meet, and whose blue eyes and light hair indicate no trace of Oriental blood, may not be a _churdo_, or _pash-ratt_, or half-blood, or _half-scrag_, as a full Gipsy might contemptuously term him, but he may be, of his kind, a quadroon or octoroon, or he may have \"gipsified,\" by marrying a Gipsy wife; and by the way be it said, such women make by far the best wives to be found among English itinerants, and the best suited for \"a traveller.\" But in any case he has taken pains to pick up all the Gipsy he can.  If he is a tinker, he knows _Kennick_, or cant, or thieves' slang by nature, but the Rommany, which has very few words in common with the former, is the true language of the mysteries; in fact, it has with him become, strangely enough, what it was originally, a sort of sacred Sanscrit, known only to the Brahmins of the roads, compared to which the other language is only commonplace _Prakrit_, which anybody may acquire.  He is proud of his knowledge, he makes of it a deep mystery; and if you, a gentleman, ask him about it, he will probably deny that he ever heard of its existence.  Should he be very thirsty, and your manners frank and assuring, it is, however, not impossible that after draining a pot of beer at your expense, he may recall, with a grin, the fact that he _has_ heard that the Gipsies have a queer kind of language of their own; and then, if you have any Rommany yourself at command, he will perhaps _rakker Rommanis_ with greater or less fluency.  Mr Simeon, in his \"History of the Gipsies,\" asserts that there is not a tinker or scissors- grinder in Great Britain who cannot talk this language, and my own experience agrees with his declaration, to this extent--that they all have some knowledge of it, or claim to have it, however slight it may be.  So rare is a knowledge of Rommany among those who are not connected in some way with Gipsies, that the slightest indication of it is invariably taken as an irrefutable proof of relationship with them.  It is but a few weeks since, as I was walking along the Marine Parade in Brighton, I overtook a tinker.  Wishing him to sharpen some tools for me, I directed him to proceed to my home, and _en route_ spoke to him in Gipsy.  As he was quite fair in complexion, I casually remarked, \"I should have never supposed you could speak Rommany--you don't look like it.\"  To which he replied, very gravely, in a tone as of gentle reproach, \"You don't look a Gipsy yourself, sir; but you know you _are_ one--_you talk like one_.\"  Truly, the secret of the Rommany has been well kept in England.  It seems so to me when I reflect that, with the exception of Lavengro and the Rommany Rye, {5} I cannot recall a single novel, in our language, in which the writer has shown familiarity with the _real_ life, habits, or language of the vast majority of that very large class, the itinerants of the roads.  Mr Dickens has set before us Cheap Jacks, and a number of men who were, in their very face, of the class of which I speak; but I cannot recall in his writings any indication that he knew that these men had a singular secret life with their _confreres_, or that they could speak a strange language; for we may well call that language strange which is, in the main, Sanscrit, with many Persian words intermingled.  Mr Dickens, however, did not pretend, as some have done, to specially treat of Gipsies, and he made no affectation of a knowledge of any"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16358"],["title","The English Gipsies and Their Language (#2)"],["body","steries.  He simply reflected popular life as he saw it.  But there are many novels and tales, old and new, devoted to setting forth Rommany life and conversation, which are as much like the originals as a Pastor Fido is like a common shepherd.  One novel which I once read, is so full of \"the dark blood,\" that it might almost be called a gipsy novel.  The hero is a gipsy; he lives among his kind--the book is full of them; and yet, with all due respect to its author, who is one of the most gifted and best- informed romance writers of the century, I must declare that, from beginning to end, there is not in the novel the slightest indication of any real and familiar knowledge of gipsies.  Again, to put thieves' slang into the mouths of gipsies, as their natural and habitual language, has been so much the custom, from Sir Walter Scott to the present day, that readers are sometimes gravely assured in good faith that this jargon is pure Rommany.  But this is an old error in England, since the vocabulary of cant appended to the \"English Rogue,\" published in 1680, was long believed to be Gipsy; and Captain Grose, the antiquary, who should have known better, speaks with the same ignorance.  It is, indeed, strange to see learned and shrewd writers, who pride themselves on truthfully depicting every element of European life, and every type of every society, so ignorant of the habits, manners, and language of thousands of really strange people who swarm on the highways and bye-ways!  We have had the squire and the governess, my lord and all Bohemia--Bohemia, artistic and literary--but where are our _Vrais Bohemiens_?--Out of Lavengro and Rommany Rye--nowhere.  Yet there is to be found among the children of Rom, or the descendants of the worshippers of Rama, or the Doms or Coptic Romi, whatever their ancestors may have been, more that is quaint and adapted to the purposes of the novelist, than is to be found in any other class of the inhabitants of England.  You may not detect a trace of it on the roads; but once become truly acquainted with a fair average specimen of a Gipsy, pass many days in conversation with him, and above all acquire his confidence and respect, and you will wonder that such a being, so entirely different from yourself, could exist in Europe in the nineteenth century.  It is said that those who can converse with Irish peasants in their own native tongue, form far higher opinions of their appreciation of the beautiful, and of the elements of humour and pathos in their hearts, than do those who know their thoughts only through the medium of English.  I know from my own observation that this is quite the case with the Indians of North America, and it is unquestionably so with the Gipsy.  When you know a true specimen to the depths of his soul, you will find a character so entirely strange, so utterly at variance with your ordinary conceptions of humanity, that it is no exaggeration whatever to declare that it would be a very difficult task for the best writer to convey to the most intelligent reader an idea of his subject's nature.  You have in him, to begin with, a being whose every condition of life is in direct contradiction to what you suppose every man's life in England must be.  \"I was born in the open air,\" said a Gipsy to me a few days since; \"and put me down anywhere, in the fields or woods, I can always support myself.\" Understand me, he did not mean by pilfering, since it was of America that we were speaking, and of living in the lonely forests.  We pity with tears many of the poor among us, whose life is one of luxury compared to that which the Gipsy, who despises them, enjoys with a zest worth more than riches.  \"What a country America must be,\" quoth Pirengro, the Walker, to me, on the occasion just referred to.  \"Why, my pal, who's just welled apopli from dovo tem--(my brother, who has just returned from that country), tells me that when a cow or anything dies there, they just chuck it away, and nobody ask a word for any of it.\"  \"What would _you_ do,\" he continued, \"if you were in the fields and had nothing to eat?\"  I replied, \"that if any could be found, I should hunt for fern-roots.\"  \"I could do better than that,\" he said.  \"I should hunt for a _hotchewitchi_,--a hedge-hog,--and I should be sure to find one; there's no better eating.\"  Whereupon assuming his left hand to be an imaginary hedge-hog, he proceeded to score and turn and dress it for ideal cooking with a case- knife.  \"And what had you for dinner to-day?\" I inquired.  \"Some cocks' heads.  They're very fine--very fine indeed!\"  Now it is curious but true that there is no person in the world more particular as to what he eats than the half-starved English or Irish peasant, whose sufferings have so often been set forth for our condolence.  We may be equally foolish, you and I--in fact chemistry proves it--when we are disgusted at the idea of feeding on many things which mere association and superstition render revolting.  But the old fashioned gipsy has none of these qualms--he is haunted by no ghost of society--save the policeman, he knows none of its terrors.  Whatever is edible he eats, except horse-meat; wherever there is an empty spot he sleeps; and the man who can do this devoid of shame, without caring a pin for what the world says--nay, without even knowing that he does not care, or that he is peculiar--is independent to a degree which of itself confers a character which is not easy to understand.  I grew up as a young man with great contempt for Helvetius, D'Holbach, and all the French philosophers of the last century, whose ideal man was a perfect savage; but I must confess that since I have studied gipsy nature, my contempt has changed into wonder where they ever learned in their _salons_ and libraries enough of humanity to theorise so boldly, and with such likeness to truth, as they did.  It is not merely in the absolute out-of-doors independence of the old-fashioned Gipsy, freer than any wild beast from care for food, that his resemblance to a \"philosopher\" consists, or rather to the ideal man, free from imaginary cares.  For more than this, be it for good or for evil, the real Gipsy has, unlike all other men, unlike the lowest savage, positively no religion, no tie to a spiritual world, no fear of a future, nothing but a few trifling superstitions and legends, which in themselves indicate no faith whatever in anything deeply seated.  It would be difficult, I think, for any highly civilised man, who had not studied Thought deeply, and in a liberal spirit, to approach in the least to a rational comprehension of a real Gipsy mind.  During my life it has been my fortune to become intimate with men who were \"absolutely\" or \"positively\" free-thinkers--men who had, by long study and mere logic, completely freed themselves from any mental tie whatever.  Such men are rare; it requires an enormous amount of intellectual culture, an unlimited expenditure of pains in the metaphysical hot-bed, and tremendous self- confidence to produce them--I mean \"the real article.\"  Among the most thorough of these, a man on whom utter and entire freedom of thought sat easily and unconsciously, was a certain German doctor of philosophy named P---.  To him God and all things were simply ideas of development.  The last remark which I can recall from him was \"_Ja, ja_.  We advanced Hegelians agree exactly on the whole with the Materialists.\"  Now, to my mind, nothing seems more natural than that, when sitting entire days talking with an old Gipsy, no one rises so frequently from the past before me as Mr P---.  To him all religion represented a portion of the vast mass of frozen, petrified developments, which simply impede the march of intelligent minds; to my Rommany friend, it is one of the thousand inventions of _gorgio_ life, which, like policemen, are simply obstacles to Gipsies in the search of a living, and could he have grasped the circumstances of the case, he would doubtless have replied \"_Avali_, we Gipsies agree on the whole exactly with Mr P---.\"  Extremes meet.  One Sunday an old Gipsy was assuring me, with a great appearance of piety, that on that day she neither told fortunes nor worked at any kind of labour--in fact, she kept it altogether correctly.  \"_Avali_, _dye_,\" I replied.  \"Do you know what the Gipsies in Germany say became of their church?\"  \"_Kek_,\" answered the old lady.  \"No.  What is it?\"  \"They say that the Gipsies' church was made of pork, and the dogs ate it.\"  Long, loud, and joyously affirmative was the peal of laughter with which the Gipsies welcomed this characteristic story.  So far as research and the analogy of living tribes of the same race can establish a fact, it would seem that the Gipsies were, previous to their quitting India, not people of high caste, but wandering Pariahs, outcasts, foes to the Brahmins, and unbelievers.  All the Pariahs are not free-thinkers, but in India, the Church, as in Italy, loses no time in making of all detected free-thinkers Pariahs.  Thus we are told, in the introduction to the English translation of that very curious book, \"The Tales of the Gooroo Simple,\" which should be read by every scholar, that all the true literature of the country--that which has life, and freedom, and humour--comes from the Pariahs.  And was it different in those days, when Rabelais, and Von Hutten, and Giordano Bruno were, in their wise, Pariahs and Gipsies, roving from city to city, often wanting bread and dreading fire, but asking for nothing but freedom?  The more I have conversed intimately with Gipsies, the more have I been struck by the fact, that my mingled experiences of European education and of life in the Far West of America have given me a basis of mutual intelligence which had otherwise been utterly wanting.  I, myself, have known in a wild country what it is to be half-starved for many days--to feel that all my thoughts and intellectual exertions, hour by hour, were all"]]]
