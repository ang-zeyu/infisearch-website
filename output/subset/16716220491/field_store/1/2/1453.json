There could be no better illustration of his desperation as a scout missionary than this artless proposition to the sentinel of Barrel Alley.  \"Who can't catch?\" Keekie Joe demanded.  \"You can't.\"  \"Me?\"  \"Yes, you.\"  \"Yer dasn' say it again.\"  \"You can't catch, you can't catch, you can't catch,\" said Pee-wee.  There seemed nothing left now but to break off diplomatic relations altogether.  The issue was clear.  But Keekie Joe did not plunge his outlandish person into war.  \"If I didn' have ter lay keekie I'd slam yer one,\" he announced.  \"What's the use of giving you candy if we can't be friends?\" Pee-wee said.  \"Gee whiz, I wouldn't care how much candy fellers threw at me; the more the merrier.  They can throw mince pies at me for all I care,\" he added.  \"If you want to be a scout I'll show you how and we can start a patrol maybe.\"  [Illustration: Keekie Joe interviews Pee-wee]  The word patrol seemed to suggest something ominous to Keekie Joe, for he glanced furtively up and down the alley, and then waved his hand reassuringly to the group in the middle of the field.  Pee-wee perceived now that the scene of the crap game had been selected with keen military wisdom, affording a safe avenue of precipitate retreat in any direction.  Disaster could have resulted only from a surrounding host.  Officer McMahon, the tyrant on this squalid beat, was large.  But he was not large enough to surround the camp.  The crap-shooters of Barrel Alley had been surprised in every nook and corner of their neighborhood until they had hit upon the bold expedient of playing in an open lot, reposing their trust in a sentinel.  It would not have been well for the sentinel to relax his vigilance.  \"What I want ter join them scout kids fer?\" Keekie Joe inquired.  \"Der yer call me a sissy?\"  \"Do you call the scouts sissies?\" Pee-wee inquired angrily.  \"They have more fun than you do, that's one sure thing.  If you don't want to join you don't have to but you don't have to get mad about it.  Gee whiz, you're always mad, kind of.  I guess you got up out of the wrong side of the bed, that's what _I_ think.\"  This was not true, for indeed Keekie Joe did not sleep in a bed at all; he slept on a heap of old inner tubes in Ike Levine's tire repair shop. He was about to resent this slander from Pee-wee with a glowering look and a threat, when suddenly something happened, which precipitately terminated his performance of his official functions.  His father called him from a tenement across the street, accompanying his summons with such dismal predictions of what would happen if he did not obey that the official sentinel had no choice but to desert his post.  \"If I have ter come over there'n git yer,\" the father said, \"I'll----\"  Poor Joe glanced at his father in the window, then at the gamesters in the field.  It was evident that chastisement of the severest character awaited him in any case.  For a moment he had a wild notion of making a spectacular retreat along the street, crawling through a broken part of the fence beyond the range of parental vision, and resuming his duties of sentinel at another vantage point.  Such a maneuver would at least postpone a reckoning with his father and enable him to be faithful to his trust.  A very unworthy trust it may have been but his one thought was to be faithful to it.  And there you have Keekie Joe in a nutshell . . .     CHAPTER V  A QUESTION OF DUTY  Pee-wee's advice to Joe in this predicament was rather singular, and the scout law on which he based it covered a rather larger field of obligation than was necessary in the circumstances.  \"Go ahead over,\" he whispered; \"you have to obey your parents and all other duly constituted authorities.  I'll lay keekie for you while you're gone; go ahead over, I'll keep watch.\"  \"Yes, you will!\" said Joe incredulously.  \"I know youz guys, y'll put one over, that's what y'll do.  Wat'd'yer mean, constute--con--authorities? Yes yer will, _not_!\"  \"That shows how much you know about scouts,\" Pee-wee said, always ready to explain the ins and outs of scouting.  \"Do you think I'd cheat?  Gee whiz, I've got to be faithful to a trust, haven't I?  If I say I'll do a thing I'll do it.  You go ahead over and I'll keep watch and if I don't do it you can punch me in the eye the next time you see me.\"  It was not so much this proffer of indemnity as a supplementary threat from the window across the way which decided Keekie Joe.  He did not believe in Pee-wee for he did not believe in anybody.  But he was a bit puzzled at this self-possessed little stranger from another world.  There was a straightforward, clear look in the little scout's eyes which bespoke both friendliness and sincerity and Keekie Joe did not understand this.  The emergency decided him to repose faith in the strange boy but it was not in him to do this graciously.  \"You keep yer eyes peeled till I git back, and giv'm the high sign, d'yer hear?\" he said with insolent skepticism, \"or the first time I see yer on Main Street I'll black up both yer eyes fer yer, d'yer see?\"  \"That's one thing I like about you,\" said Pee-wee; \"gee whiz, you obey scout laws without even knowing them.  That shows you're a kind of a scout and you don't know it.\"  Keekie Joe did not look much like a scout, as he shuffled across the street; he did not even look like the rawest of raw scout material.  But statues are carved out of hard rock.  And Keekie Joe was a very hard rock indeed.  Pee-wee vaulted up onto the ramshackle fence, placed one of those granite bricks known as a licorice jaw-breaker in his mouth, and prepared for his indefinite vigil.  He was not thinking of the \"constituted authorities,\" he was not thinking of the crap-shooters either; his back was turned to them and his all seeing eye was fixed on the distant street corner.  He was thinking of Keekie Joe and of how Keekie Joe had tried to obey one of the good scout laws by being faithful to a trust.  And there you have Pee-wee Harris in a nut-shell . . .  The game in the middle of the large field must have become exciting, for its votaries were gathered into a close group.  None of the players seemed able now to spare so much as a cautious glance toward the street. Once, during his intense preoccupation, Slats Corbett gave a quick, furtive glance afar, but it was only in a sort of sub-consciousness that he glimpsed a figure sitting on the fence, its back toward him.  That was enough.  The group gathered closer, voices were heard in excited altercation, there were long intervals of silence.  The group had shrunken and become compact.  All were stooping.  Their preoccupation seemed intense.  They had forgotten all about the lookout.  Occasionally some civilian passed along the distant alley and guilty instinct caused one or another of the group to glance thither to give a hasty appraisal of his mission and character.  And so the wicked game went on.  And the sports of Barrel Alley never knew that their stronghold had been invaded by the boy scouts.  Then around the distant corner appeared two figures in civilian clothes, strangers in Barrel Alley.  They were County Detectives Slippett and Spotson.  They strolled down the alley innocently.  Keekie Joe, whose activities were chiefly local, knew them not.  But Pee-wee Harris, Scout, knew them.  On one of his long hikes he had seen them arrest a motorist in Northvale.  He had seen them loitering in the post office at Little Valley.  They did duty in the various municipalities of the county where the familiar faces of the local officials were a stumbling block to the apprehension of wrongdoers.  They were going to break up this ring of gambling rowdies, and so forth and so forth and so forth . . .  Pee-wee's first impulse was to shout, but on second thought it occurred to him that the army of invasion consisting of two, one of them might make a flank move on hearing his warning voice, and that one detective could thus drive the criminals into the very arms of the other, as they passed through the back yard of Chin Foo's laundry.  Chin Foo's back yard was a sort of trap.  So instead of shouting he descended from the fence with lightning agility and ran across the field as fast as his legs would carry him, and pell-mell into the group.  \"Two detectives are coming down the alley,\" he panted.  \"Beat it over that way and then you'll _sure_ not run into one of them because they've got--got--a lot of strat--strat--strat--strat--egy--they have--you'd better hurry up.\"  The time it required for the group to disperse can not be indicated by any word in the English language.  They were there and then they were _not_ there.  As Pee-wee stood amid scattered coins and dice he was conscious of distant forms scaling fences, wriggling through holes, and of one pair of legs disappearing majestically over a dilapidated roof.  As a disorderly retreat it was a masterpiece.  It was not in Pee-wee's nature to run from anything or anybody.  So there he stood amid the telltale mementoes of the dreadful game while Detectives Slippett and Spotson strolled into the field.  They were just in time to behold a fleeting vision of forms wriggling through fences, gliding around buildings, and scrambling over roof tops.  County Detective Spotson was quick to sense the situation.  Taking Pee-wee roughly by the shoulder he demanded in that sophisticated voice and manner which all detectives acquire and which sometimes passes for shrewdness, \"What's the big idea, huh?  Tipped them off, did you?  Well, you're a very clever kid, ain't you?\"  He removed his big hand from Pee-wee's shoulder and injected his fingers down the back of the boy's neck, grabbing him by the collar and gathering it so that it almost choked him.

There was one change, however, which went to Ida's heart. The little old lady had no longer a flower to take to church with her. At Christmas she took a sprig of holly, and after that a spray of myrtle, but Ida felt that these were poor substitutes for a rose. She knew that Mrs. Overtheway had flowers somewhere, it is true, for certain pots of forced hyacinths had passed through the little green gate to the Christmas church decorations; but one's winter garden is too precious to be cropped as recklessly as summer rose-bushes, and the old lady went flowerless to church and enjoyed her bulbs at home. But the change went to Ida's heart.  Spring was early that year. At the beginning of February there was a good deal of snow on the ground, it is true, but the air became milder and milder, and towards the end of the month there came a real spring day, and all the snow was gone.  \"You may go and play in the garden, Miss Ida,\" said Nurse, and Ida went.  She had been kept indoors for a long time by the weather and by a cold, and it was very pleasant to get out again, even when the only amusement was to run up and down the shingly walks and wonder how soon she might begin to garden, and whether the gardener could be induced to give her a piece of ground sufficiently extensive to grow a crop of mustard-and-cress in the form of a capital I. It was the kitchen garden into which Ida had been sent. At the far end it was cut off from the world by an overgrown hedge with large gaps at the bottom, through which Ida could see the high road, a trough for watering horses, and beyond this a wood. The hedge was very thin in February, and Ida had a good view in consequence, and sitting on a stump in the sunshine she peered through the gap to see if any horses came to drink. It was as good as a peep-show, and indeed much better.  \"The snow has melted,\" gurgled the water, \"here I am.\" It was everywhere. The sunshine made the rich green mosses look dry, but in reality they were wet, and so was everything else. Slish! slosh! Put your feet where you would, the water was everywhere. It filled the stone trough, which, being old and grey and steady, kept it still, and bade it reflect the blue sky and the gorgeous mosses; but the trough soon overflowed, and then the water slipped over the side, and ran off in a wayside stream. \"Winter is gone!\" it spluttered as it ran. \"Winter is gone, winter-is-gone, winterisgone!\" And, on the principle that a good thing cannot be said too often, it went on with this all through the summer, till the next winter came and stopped its mouth with icicles. As the stream chattered, so the birds in the wood sang--Tweet! tweet! chirrup! throstle! Spring! Spring! Spring!--and they twittered from tree to tree, and shook the bare twigs with melody; whilst a single blackbird sitting still upon a bough below, sang \"Life!\" \"Life!\" \"Life!\" with the loudest pipe of his throat, because on such a day it was happiness only to be alive.  It was like a wonderful fairy-tale, to which Ida listened with clasped hands.  Presently another song came from the wood: it was a hymn sung by children's voices, such as one often hears carolled by a troop of little urchins coming home from school. The words fell familiarly on Ida's ears:      \"Quite through the streets with silver sound,       The flood of life doth flow;     Upon whose banks on every side       The wood of life doth grow.      \"Thy gardens and thy gallant walks       Continually are green;     There grow such sweet and pleasant flowers       As nowhere else are seen.      \"There trees for evermore bear fruit,       And evermore do spring;     There evermore the Angels sit,       And evermore do sing.\"  Here the little chorus broke off, and the children came pouring out of the wood with chattering and laughter. Only one lingered, playing under a tree, and finishing the song. The child's voice rose shrill and clear like that of the blackbird above him. He also sang of Life--Eternal life--knowing little more than the bird of the meaning of his song, and having little less of that devotion of innocence in which happiness is praise.  But Ida had ceased to listen to the singing. Her whole attention was given to the children as they scampered past the hedge, dropping bits of moss and fungi and such like woodland spoil. For, tightly held in the grubby hands of each--plucked with reckless indifference to bud and stalk, and fading fast in their hot prisons--were primroses. Ida started to her feet, a sudden idea filling her brain. The birds were right, Spring had come, and there were flowers--_flowers for Mrs. Overtheway_.  Ida was a very quiet, obedient little girl, as a general rule; indeed, in her lonely life she had small temptation to pranks or mischief of any kind. She had often been sent to play in the back garden before, and had never thought of straying beyond its limits; but to-day a strong new feeling had been awakened by the sight of the primroses.  \"The hole is very large,\" said Ida, looking at the gap in the hedge; \"if that dead root in the middle were pulled up, it would be wonderfully large.\"  She pulled the root up, and, though wonderful is a strong term, the hole was certainly larger.  \"It is big enough to put one's head through,\" said Ida, and, stooping down, she exemplified the truth of her observation.  \"Where the head goes, the body will follow,\" they say, and Ida's little body was soon on the other side of the hedge; the adage says nothing about clothes, however, and part of Ida's dress was left behind. It had caught on the stump as she scrambled through. But accidents will happen, and she was in the road, which was something.  \"It is like going into the world to seek one's fortune,\" she thought; \"thus Gerda went to look for little Kay, and so Joringel sought for the enchanted flower. One always comes to a wood.\"  And into the wood she came. Dame Nature had laid down her new green carpets, and everything looked lovely; but, as has been before said, it certainly was damp. The little singer under the tree cared no more for this, however, than the blackbird above him.  \"Will you tell me, please, where you got your primroses?\" asked Ida.  The child made a quaint, half-military salute; and smiled.  \"Yonder,\" he said laconically, and, pointing up the wood, he went on with the song that he could not understand:      \"Ah, my sweet home, Jerusalem,       Would God I were in thee!      Would God my woes were at an end,       Thy joys that I might see!\"  Ida went on and on, looking about her as she ran. Presently the wood sloped downwards, and pretty steeply, so that it was somewhat of a scramble; yet still she kept a sharp look-out, but no primroses did she see, except a few here and there upon the ground, which had been plucked too close to their poor heads to be held in anybody's hands. These showed the way, however, and Ida picked them up in sheer pity and carried them with her.  \"This is how Hop-o'-my-Thumb found his way home,\" she thought.  At the bottom of the hill ran a little brook, and on the opposite side of the brook was a bank, and on the top of the bank was a hedge, and under the hedge were the primroses. But the brook was between!  Ida looked and hesitated. It was too wide to jump across, and here, as elsewhere, there was more water than usual. To turn back, however, was out of the question. Gerda would not have been daunted in her search by coming to a stream, nor would any one else that ever was read of in fairy tales. It is true that in Fairy-land there are advantages which cannot always be reckoned upon by commonplace children in this commonplace world. When the straw, the coal, and the bean came to a rivulet in their travels, the straw laid himself across as a bridge for the others, and had not the coal been a degree too hot on that unlucky occasion, they might (for anything Ida knew to the contrary) still have been pursuing their journey in these favourable circumstances. But a travelling-companion who expands into a bridge on an emergency is not to be met with every day; and as to poor Ida--she was alone. She stood first on one leg, and then on the other, she looked at the water, and then at the primroses, and then at the water again, and at last perceived that in one place there was a large, flat, moss-covered stone in the middle of the stream, which stood well out of the water, and from which--could she but reach it--she might scramble to the opposite bank. But how to reach it? that nice, large, secure, comfortable-looking stone.  \"I must put some more stones,\" thought Ida. There were plenty in the stream, and Ida dragged them up, and began to make a ford by piling them together. It was chilly work, for a cloud had come over the sun; and Ida was just a little bit frightened by the fresh-water shrimps, and some queer, many-legged beasts, who shot off the stones as she lifted them. At last the ford was complete. Ida stepped daintily over the bridge she had made, and jumped triumphantly on to the big stone. Alas! for trusting to appearances. The stone that looked so firm, was insecurely balanced below, and at the first shock one side went down with a splash, and Ida went with it. What a triumph for the shrimps! She scrambled to the bank, however, made up a charming bunch of primroses, and turned to go home. Never mind how she got back across the brook. We have all waded streams before now, and very good fun it is in June, but rather chilly work in February; and, in spite of running home, Ida trembled as much with cold as with excitement when she stood at last before Mrs. Overtheway's green gate.  Click! Ida went up the white steps, marking them sadly with her wet feet, and gave a valiant rap. The door was opened, and a tall, rather severe-looking housekeeper asked:  \"What do you want, my dear?\"  A shyness, amounting to terror, had seized upon Ida,"]]]
