How do they feel there with our army only about twenty miles away?\"  \"They're quiet and seem to be confident, but I believe they know their danger.\"  \"Have you by any chance seen or heard of my cousin, Harry Kenton, who is a lieutenant on the staff of the Southern commander-in-chief?\"  Shepard smiled, as if the question brought memories that pleased him.  \"A fine youth,\" he said.  \"Yes, I've seen him more than once.  I'm free to tell you, Lieutenant Mason, that I know a lot about this rebel cousin of yours.  He and I have come into conflict on several occasions, and I did not win every time.\"  \"Nobody could beat Harry always,\" exclaimed Dick with youthful loyalty. \"He was always the strongest and most active among us, and the best in forest and water.  He could hunt and fish and trail like the scouts of our border days.\"  \"I found him in full possession of all these qualities and he used them against me.  I should grieve if that cousin of yours were to fall, Mr. Mason.  I want to know him still better after the war.\"  Dick would have asked further questions about the encounters between Harry and the spy, but he judged that Shepard did not care to answer them, and he forbore.  Yet the man aroused the most intense curiosity in him. There were spies and spies, and Shepard was one of them, but he was not like the others.  He was unquestionably a man of great mental power. His calm, steady gaze and his words to the point showed it.  No one patronized Shepard.  \"I should like to go into Richmond with you some dark night,\" said Dick, who hid a strong spirit of adventure under his quiet exterior.  \"You're not serious, Lieutenant Mason?\"  \"I wasn't, maybe, when I began to say it, but I believe I am now. Why shouldn't I be curious about Richmond, a place that great armies have been trying to take for three years?  Just at present it's the center of the world to me in interest.\"  \"You must not think of such a thing, Mr. Mason.  Detection means certain death.\"  \"No more for me than for you.\"  \"But I have had a long experience and I have resources of which you can't know.  Don't think of it again, Mr. Mason.\"  \"I was merely jesting.  I won't,\" said Dick.  He involuntarily looked toward the point beyond the horizon where Richmond lay, and Shepard meanwhile studied him closely.  Young Mason had not come much under his notice until lately, but now he began to interest the spy greatly.  Shepard observed what a strong, well-built young fellow he was, tall and slender but extremely muscular.  He also bore a marked resemblance to his cousin, Harry Kenton, and such was the quality of Shepard that the likeness strongly recommended Dick to him. Moreover, he read the lurking thought that persisted in Dick's mind.  \"You mustn't dream of such a thing as entering Richmond, Mr. Mason,\" he said.  \"It was just a passing thought.  But aren't you going in again?\"  \"Later on, no doubt, but not just now.  I understand that we're planning some movement.  I don't know what it is, but I'm to wait here until it's over.  Good-by, Mr. Mason.  Since things are closing in it's possible that you and I will see more of each other than before.\"  \"Of course, when I'm personally conducted by you on that trip into Richmond.\"  Shepard, who had left the portico, turned and shook a warning finger.  \"Dismiss that absolutely and forever from your mind, Mr. Mason,\" he said.  Dick laughed, and watched the stalwart figure of the spy as he strode away.  Again the singular ease and lightness of his step struck him. To the lad's fancy the grass did not bend under his feet.  Upon Dick as upon Harry, Shepard made the impression of power, not only of strength but of subtlety and courage.  \"I'm glad that man's on our side,\" said Dick to himself, as Shepard's figure disappeared among the trees.  Then he left the portico and went down in the valley to Colonel Winchester's regiment, where he was received with joyous shouts by several young men, including Warner and Pennington, who had gone on before.  Colonel Winchester himself smiled and nodded, and Dick saluted respectfully.  The Winchesters, as they loved to call themselves, were faring well at this particular time.  Like the Invincibles on the other side, this regiment had been decimated and filled up again several times.  It had lost heavily in the Wilderness and at Spottsylvania, but its colonel had escaped without serious hurt and had received special mention for gallantry and coolness.  It had been cut up once more at Cold Harbor, and because of its great services and losses it was permitted to remain a while in the rear as a reserve, and obtain the rest it needed so sorely.  The brave youths were recovering fast from their wounds and exertions. Their camp was beside a clear brook and there were tents for the officers, though they were but seldom used, most of them, unless it should be raining, preferring to sleep in their blankets under the trees.  The water was good to drink, and farther down were several deep pools in which they bathed.  Food, as usual in the Northern army, was good and plentiful, and for the Winchesters it seemed more a period of play than of war.  \"What did you see at the house, Dick?\" asked Colonel Winchester.  \"The spy, Shepard.  I talked a while with him.  He says the Confederacy is growing weaker every day, but if we try to storm Lee's lines we'll be cut to pieces.\"  \"I think he's right in both respects, although I feel sure that some kind of a movement will soon be attempted.  But Dick, a mail from the west has arrived and here is a letter for you.\"  He handed the lad a large square envelope, addressed in tall, slanting script, and Dick knew at once that it was from his mother.  He seized it eagerly, and Colonel Winchester, suppressing the wish to know what was inside, turned away.            *          *          *          *  I have not heard from my dearest boy since the terrible battles in the east [Mrs. Mason wrote], but I hope and pray that you have come safely through them.  You have escaped so many dangers that I feel you must escape all the rest.  The news reaches us that the fighting in Virginia has been of the most dreadful character, but when it arrives in Pendleton it has two meanings.  Those of our little town who are for the Confederacy say General Grant's losses have been so enormous that he can go no farther, and that the last and greatest effort of the North has failed.  Those who sympathize with the Union say General Lee has been reduced so greatly that he must be crushed soon and with him the Confederacy. As you know, I wish the latter to be true, but I suspect that the truth is somewhere between the two statements.  But the truth either way brings me great grief.  I cannot hate the Southern people.  We are Southern ourselves in all save this war, and, although our dear little town is divided in feeling, I have received nothing but kindness from those on the other side.  Dr. Russell often asks about you.  He says you were the best Latin scholar in the Academy, and he expects you to have a great future, as a learned man, after the war.  He speaks oftenest of you and Harry Kenton, and I believe that you two were his favorite pupils.  He says that Harry's is the best mathematical mind he has ever found in his long years of teaching.  Your room remains just as it was when you left.  Juliana brushes and airs it every day, and expects at any time to see her young Master Dick come riding home.  She keeps in her mind two pictures of you, absolutely unlike.  In one of these pictures you are a great officer, carrying much of the war's weight on your shoulders, consulted continually by General Grant, who goes wrong only when he fails to take your advice.  In the other you are a little boy whom she alternately scolds and pets.  And it may be that I am somewhat like Juliana in this respect.  The garden is very fine this year.  The vegetables were never more plentiful, and never of a finer quality.  I wish you were here for your share.  It must be a trial to have to eat hard crackers and tough beef and pork day after day.  I should think that you would grow to hate the sight of them.  Sam, the colored man who has been with us so long, has proved as faithful and trustworthy as Juliana.  He makes a most excellent farmer, and the yield of corn in the bottom land is going to be amazing.  They say that since the Federal successes in the West the operations of Skelly's band of guerrillas have become bolder, but he has not threatened Pendleton again.  They say also that a little farther south a band of like character, who call themselves Southern, under a man named Slade, are ravaging, but I suppose that you, who see great generals and great armies daily, are not much concerned about outlaws.  Always keep your feet dry and warm if you can, and never fail to spread a blanket between you and the damp grass.  Give my respects to Colonel Winchester.  Tell him that we hear of him now and then in Kentucky and that we hear only good.  Don't forget about the blanket.            *          *          *          *  There was more, but it was these passages over which Dick lingered longest.  He read the letter three times--letters were rare in those years, and men prized them highly--and put it away in his strongest pocket. Colonel Winchester was standing by the edge of the brook, and Dick, saluting him, said:  \"My mother wishes me to deliver to you her respects and best wishes.\"  A flush showed through the tan of the colonel's face, and Dick, noticing it, was startled by a sudden thought.  At first his feeling was jealousy, but it passed in an instant, never to come again.  There was no finer man in the world than Colonel Winchester.  \"She is well,\" he added, \"and affairs could go no better at Pendleton.\"  \"I am glad,\" said Colonel Winchester simply.  Then he turned to a man with very broad shoulders and asked:  \"How are the new"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17678"],["title","The Apology of the Church of England (#1)"],["body","sorts.  Hereupon kings and princes, being led then by such persuasions, killed all the Prophets of God, letting none escape.  Esay with a saw, Jeremy with stones, Daniel with lions, Amos with an iron bar, Paul with the sword, and Christ upon the cross; and condemned all Christians to imprisonments, to torments, to the pikes, to be thrown down headlong from rocks and steep places, to be cast to wild beasts, and to be burnt: and made great fires of their quick bodies, for the only purpose to give light by night, and for a very scorn and mocking stock; and did count them no better than the vilest filth, the offscourings and laughing games of the whole world.  Thus, as ye see, have the authors and professors of the truth ever been intreated.  Wherefore, we ought to bear it the more quietly, which have taken upon us to profess the Gospel of Christ, if we for the same cause be handled after the same sort; and if we, as our forefathers were long ago, be likewise at this day tormented, and baited with railings, with spiteful dealings, and with lies; and that for no desert of our own, but only because we teach and acknowledge the truth.  They cry out upon us at this present everywhere, that we are all heretics, and have forsaken the faith, and have with new persuasions and wicked learning utterly dissolved the concord of the Church; that we renew, and, as it were, fetch again from hell the old and many a day condemned heresies; that we sow abroad new sects, and such broils as never yearst were heard of: also that we are already divided into contrary parts and opinions, and could yet by no means agree well among ourselves; that we be cursed creatures, and, like the giants, do war against God Himself, and live clean without any regard or worshipping of God; that we despise all good deeds; that we use no discipline of virtue, no laws, no customs; that we esteem neither right, nor order, nor equity, nor justice; that we give the bridle to all naughtiness, and provoke the people to all licentiousness and lust; that we labour and seek to overthrow the state of monarchies and kingdoms, and to bring all things under the rule of the rash inconstant people and unlearned multitude; that we have seditiously fallen from the Catholic Church, and by a wicked schism and division have shaken the whole world, and troubled the common peace and universal quiet of the Church; and that, as Dathan and Abiram conspired in times past against Moses and Aaron, even so we at this day have renounced the Bishop of Rome without any cause reasonable; that we set nought by the authority of the ancient fathers and councils of old time; that we have rashly and presumptuously disannulled the old ceremonies, which have been well allowed by our fathers and forefathers many hundred years past, both by good customs, and also in ages of more purity; and that we have by our own private head, without the authority of any sacred and general council, brought new traditions into the Church: and have done all these things not for religion's sake, but only upon a desire of contention and strife; but that they for their part have changed no manner of thing, but have held and kept still such a number of years to this very day all things as they were delivered from the Apostles and well approved by the most ancient fathers.  And that this matter should not seem to be done but upon privy slander, and to be tossed to and fro in a corner, only to spite us, there have been besides wilily procured by the Bishop of Rome certain persons of eloquence enough, and not unlearned neither, which should put their help to this cause, now almost despaired of, and should polish and set forth the same, both in books, and with long tales to the end that, when the matter was trimly and eloquently handled, ignorant and unskilful persons might suspect there was some great thing in it.  Indeed they perceived that their own cause did everywhere go to wrack; that their sleights were now espied, and less esteemed; and that their helps did daily fail them; and that their matter stood altogether in great need of a cunning spokesman.  Now as for those things which by them have been laid against us, in part they be manifestly false, and condemned so by their own judgments which spake them; partly again, though they be as false, too, indeed, yet bear they a certain show and colour of truth, so as the reader (if he take not good heed) may easily be tripped and brought into error by them, specially when their fine and cunning tale is added thereunto.  And part of them be of such sort as we ought not to shun them as crimes or faults, but to acknowledge and profess them as things well done, and upon very good reason.  For shortly to say the truth, these folk falsely accuse and slander all our doings; yea the same things which they themselves cannot deny but to be rightly and orderly done; and for malice do so misconstrue and deprave all our sayings and doings, as though it were impossible that anything could be rightly spoken or done by us.  They should more plainly and sincerely have gone to work if they would have dealt truly.  But now they neither truly, nor sincerely, nor yet Christianly, but darkly and craftily charge and batter us with lies, and do abuse the blindness and fondness of the people, together with the ignorance of princes, to cause us to be hated and the truth to be suppressed.  This, lo, ye, is the power of darkness, and of men which lean more to the amazed wondering of the rude multitude and to darkness than they do to truth and light; and as St. Hierom saith, which do openly gainsay the truth, closing up their eyes, and will not see for the nonce.  But we give thanks to the most good and mighty God, that such is our cause, whereagainst (when they would fainest) they were able to utter no despite, but the same which might as well be wrested against the holy fathers, against the Prophets, against the Apostles, against Peter, against Paul, and against Christ Himself.  Now, therefore, if it be lawful for these folks to be eloquent and fine- tongued in speaking evil, surely it becometh not us in our cause, being so very good, to be dumb in answering truly.  For men to be careless what is spoken by them and their own matter, be it never so falsely and slanderously spoken (especially when it is such that the majesty of God and the cause of religion may thereby be damaged), is the part doubtless of dissolute and wretchless persons, and of them which wickedly wink at the injuries done unto the Name of God.  For although other wrongs, yea oftentimes great, may be borne and dissembled of a mild and Christian man, yet he that goeth smoothly away, and dissembleth the matter when he is noted of heresy, Ruffinus was wont to deny that man to be a Christian. We therefore will do the same thing, which all laws, which nature's own voice doth command to be done, and which Christ Himself did in like case, when He was checked and reviled: to the intent we may put off from us these men's slanderous accusations, and may defend soberly and truly our own cause and innocency.  For Christ verily, when the Pharisees charged Him with sorcery, as one that had some familiar spirits, and wrought many things by their help: \"I,\" said He, \"have not the devil, but do glorify my Father: but it is you that have dishonoured me, and put me to rebuke and shame.\"  And St. Paul, when Festus the lieutenant scorned him as a madman: \"I,\" said he, \"most dear Festus, am not mad, as thou thinkest, but I speak the words of truth and soberness.\"  And the ancient Christians, when they were slandered to the people for mankillers, for adulterers, for committers of incest, for disturbers of the commonweals, and did perceive that by such slanderous accusations the religion which they professed might be brought in question, namely, if they should seem to hold their peace, and in manner to confess the fault; lest this might hinder the free course of the Gospel, they made orations, they put up supplications, and made means to emperors and princes, that they might defend themselves and their fellows in open audience.  But we truly, seeing that so many thousands of our brethren in these last twenty years have borne witness unto the truth, in the midst of most painful torments that could be devised; and when princes, desirous to restrain the Gospel, sought many ways, but prevailed nothing; and that now almost the whole world doth begin to open their eyes to behold the light; we take it that our cause hath already been sufficiently declared and defended, and think it not needful to make many words, seeing the matter saith enough for itself.  For if the popes would, or else if they could weigh with their own selves the whole matter, and also the beginnings and proceedings of our religion, how in a manner all their travail hath come to nought, nobody driving it forward; and how on the other side, our cause, against the will of emperors from the beginning, against the wills of so many kings, in spite of the popes, and almost maugre the head of all men, hath taken increase, and by little and little spread over into all countries, and is come at length even into kings' courts and palaces; these same things, methinketh, might be tokens great enough to them, that God Himself doth strongly fight in our quarrel, and doth from heaven laugh at their enterprises; and that the force of truth is such, as neither man's power, nor yet hell-gates are able to root it out.  For they be not all mad at this day, so many free cities, so many kings, so many princes, which have fallen away from the seat of Rome, and have rather joined themselves to the Gospel of Christ.  And although the popes had never hitherunto leisure to consider diligently and earnestly of these matters, or though some other cares do now let them, and diverse ways pull them, or though they count these to be but common and trifling studies, and nothing to appertain to the Pope's worthiness,"]]]
