How Mr. Mouse trembled!  He nearly fell off the clock, he was so frightened.  He took one jump down to the floor, and then he ran.  Oh, how he ran! Across the dining-room, across the kitchen, across the pantry, and into his hole he ran!  \"Oh, my dear, my dear! what is the matter?\" cried his wife. \"Did you see the dog? Was the cat chasing you?\"  \"No, no!\" panted Mr. Mouse.  \"I was hunting for a house, and I climbed up on a tall box.  \"Just as I had found the very place for us, there was an awful noise inside the box.\"  \"That was a clock, my dear,\" said his wife.  \"It tells Boy Blue's mother when to have dinner, and when to put the baby to bed.  \"I have heard her telling Boy Blue about it.\"  \"I think it was telling me it was time to go home,\" said Mr. Mouse, and they both laughed softly so as not to wake up the babies.  The next night Mr. Mouse went house hunting in the barn.  There he found a very good home in a box of grain.       Mistress Mary, quite contrary,     How does your garden grow?   With silver bells, and cockle shells,     And pretty maids all in a row.     MISTRESS MARY   Once upon a time there was a little girl named Mary.  She had no brothers and sisters, but she had a dear, good father and mother.  Mary always went to school with her little friends.  She played with them after school and on Saturdays.  One Saturday in winter all the children went coasting down the long hill near the school-house.  Mary took her new red sled and went with them.  Oh, it was such fun to coast down that long hill!  The children ran and laughed and shouted all the way.  They had not been coasting long when Mary fell off her sled right into a snow bank.  That was fun, too, and Mary didn't care one bit.  But when she tried to stand up, it hurt her so it made tears come into her brown eyes.  \"Are you hurt very much?\" asked Little Boy Blue.  \"My foot hurts,\" said Mary, trying not to cry.  \"We'll give you a ride home,\" said Jack Horner.  So Mary sat on her sled, and Boy Blue and Jack Horner played they were her horses.  They trotted so fast that Mary was soon at home and in her mother's arms.  When the doctor saw Mary's foot he shook his head.  \"This little girl has sprained her foot,\" he said.  \"She will have to stay in the house for some time.\"  I am afraid Mary cried when the doctor said this.  She did not like to stay at home.  She wanted to go to school with all her playmates.  She wanted to go coasting and skating and play in the snow.  In a few days Mary could sit by the window and watch the children.  Then she was not so lonely.  Jack brought home her school books and she studied very hard.  \"I want to keep up with my class, Mamma,\" she said.  So every day Mary and her mother played school together.  Every week Miss Brown came in to see how the little girl was getting along.  Of course the children went to see Mary very often.  They told her everything they had been doing in school.  One day Jack said, \"I think it would be good fun to give Mary a surprise party.\"  \"Oh yes,\" said Alice, \"and we can all take something to make her happy.\"  \"We can have the party next Saturday afternoon,\" said Jack.  \"I asked Mary's mother, and she said we could come at two o'clock.\"  At recess the children told Miss Brown about the surprise party.  \"Why don't you take some plants to Mary?\" she said.  \"Then she could have a garden to watch while she has to stay in the house.\"  \"Oh, that's just the thing for Mistress Mary,\" said Jack.  And all the children began to sing:--   \"Mistress Mary quite contrary     How does your garden grow?   With silver bells, and cockle shells,     And pretty maids all in a row.\"  Saturday afternoon Mary was playing with her dolls when the bell rang.  \"Alice has come to play with me,\" she thought.  Just then the door opened and there stood twelve little boys and girls.  [Illustration]  Each one was carrying a plant with a pretty, bright blossom.  They marched in singing \"Mistress Mary,\" and little Mistress Mary laughed, and cried, and clapped her hands, all in one minute.  Then the children put the plants on a table near the window where Mary could see them.  There were geraniums, and pinks; a sweet heliotrope, and a rose-bush with a pink rose.  Alice brought the heliotrope, and Jack brought the rose-bush.  How bright and cheerful the plants made the room look!  The children stayed an hour and played games with Mary.  They played \"hide the thimble\" and one or two guessing games, because Mary could not run around the room with them.  Then they had some little cakes and cookies which Mary's mother had made for them.  When it was time to go home they left a very happy little girl.  \"Good-bye,\" said Mary, \"I hope you will come very often.  \"Thank you for the lovely plants. My table looks like a flower garden.\"  \"Yes, Mistress Mary,\" said Jack, \"we'll come to see how your garden grows. You ought to have some silver bells and some cockle shells.\"  In a few weeks Mistress Mary, as every one called her now, came back to school.  She could run and play as well as any of the children.  But she did not forget her garden, and she often brought some of her flowers to school.  When the spring came she made a garden out of doors for her plants.  And what do you think she put all around the flower bed?  She put a splendid row of little white shells.       Little Tommy Tucker,     Sings for his supper.   What shall he eat?     White bread and butter.   How can he cut it without any knife?   How can he marry without any wife?     TOMMY TUCKER   One summer Mary went to make Grandma Hall a visit.  Grandma's little girls were all grown up now, and Grandma and Grandpa lived alone on the farm.  Mary liked to go there to visit because Grandma could tell such splendid stories, and there were always so many things to do.  It was Saturday and Mary had been busy all the morning helping Grandma make cookies, and pies, and cakes.  After dinner Grandma and little Mary took their sewing and sat out under the old apple-tree in the garden.  Grandma was making a cap, and Mary was making a white apron for her mother.  They had been sitting there only a little while when Mary saw a ragged boy coming down the road towards the house.  Running along close behind him was a ragged little dog.  The boy had a violin in his hand.  When he saw the little girl and her grandmother he stood still and began to play.  As he played, the little dog stood up on his hind legs and tried to sing.  \"Bow--wow, wow!\" he barked, and oh he did look so funny!  \"Please ask the boy to bring that funny dog over here, Grandma,\" said Mary.  \"Come here, little boy,\" said Grandma. \"What is your name?\"  \"My name is Tommy,\" said the boy, \"and this is my dog Rags.\"  \"Run and get Tommy and the dog some cookies, Mary,\" said Grandma, \"I guess they are both hungry.\"  Tommy looked so tired that Mrs. Hall asked him to sit down and rest.  \"Where do you live?\" she asked.  \"I don't live anywhere,\" replied Tommy, \"I just have my dog Rags, and he and I sleep wherever we can.\"  \"Well,\" said Grandma, \"you must both stay here to-night. We can find a place for a boy and a dog somewhere in this big house.\"  I can't tell you how happy Tommy was.  Rags seemed happy, too.  He did all the tricks he knew, and for every trick he got a big, sweet cookie.  After supper Tommy wanted to help, so he went out to the barn with Grandpa Hall.  Rags trotted along behind him, wagging his tail and barking at everything he saw.  \"What can you do, Tommy?\" asked Grandpa.  \"I can play my violin and sing,\" said Tommy. \"That is all I know how to do.\"    \"Little Tommy Tucker,   Sings for his supper.  \"I think we shall have to call you 'Tommy Tucker',\" said Grandpa.  But Tommy could do many things besides sing and play.  He helped Grandpa Hall feed the hens and chickens.  He gave them fresh water and found all the eggs.  Then he brought in some wood for Grandma's fire.  There are a great many things for a boy to do on a farm.  That night, after the children had gone to bed, Grandpa said,  \"I wish Tommy could live here with us all the time.  \"I would like a good boy to help me.\"  \"That is a good idea,\" said Grandma.  \"It is lonely now that all our children are gone.  \"And Tommy is just the kind of a boy I like.\"  So the next morning Grandma asked Tommy if he would like to live with them.  [Illustration]  \"Could Rags stay here, too?\" asked Tommy.  \"Of course he could,\" said Grandma.  \"You could help Grandpa in the summer, and in the winter you could go to school.\"  What do you think Tommy did?  He couldn't say a word.  He threw his arms around Grandma's neck and kissed her.  \"Bow-wow,\" said Rags, jumping up beside them and barking as hard as he could.  \"Bow-wow, this is a good home, Tommy.\"  And Tommy thought so too.       This little pig went to market,   This little pig stayed at home,   This little pig had bread and butter,   This little pig had none,   This little pig cried, \"Wee, wee, wee!   I can't find my way home!\"     FIVE LITTLE PIGS   Tommy Tucker and Mary had been busy all day helping Grandpa Hall pick apples.  Now the supper dishes were done and the lamp was lighted.  \"Tell us a story, Grandma,\" they begged.  \"What shall I tell you?\" said Grandma. \"Shall I tell you about 'The Three Bears,' or 'Tom Thumb,' or 'Red Riding Hood'?\"  \"Tell us a new story, please,\" said Mary.  \"Well, I will tell you the story of the 'Five Little Pigs'.\"  \"What five little pigs?\" the children asked at the same moment.  \"You know,\" said Grandma.   \"This little pig went to market,   This little pig stayed at home,   This little pig had bread and butter,   This little pig had none,   This little pig cried, 'Wee, wee, wee!      'I can't find my way home!'\"  \"Is there a story about those little pigs?\" asked Mary. \"I know I should like that.\"  So Grandma Hall told the children this story:  Once upon a time there was a mother pig and she had five"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1605"],["title","The Crock of Gold (#1)"],["body","high prices for their information, and a bonus on any gains which accrued through the following of their advices. It is unnecessary to state that their following was small when compared with those who sought the assistance of their husbands, for scarcely a week passed but some person came through the pine wood with his brows in a tangle of perplexity.  In these people the children were deeply interested. They used to go apart afterwards and talk about them, and would try to remember what they looked like, how they talked, and their manner of walking or taking snuff. After a time they became interested in the problems which these people submitted to their parents and the replies or instructions wherewith the latter relieved them. Long training had made the children able to sit perfectly quiet, so that when the talk came to the interesting part they were entirely forgotten, and ideas which might otherwise have been spared their youth became the commonplaces of their conversation.  When the children were ten years of age one of the Philosophers died. He called the household together and announced that the time had come when he must bid them all good-bye, and that his intention was to die as quickly as might be. It was, he continued, an unfortunate thing that his health was at the moment more robust than it had been for a long time, but that, of course, was no obstacle to his resolution, for death did not depend upon ill-health but upon a multitude of other factors with the details whereof he would not trouble them.  His wife, the Grey Woman of Dun Gortin, applauded this resolution and added as an amendment that it was high time he did something, that the life he had been leading was an arid and unprofitable one, that he had stolen her fourteen hundred maledictions for which he had no use and presented her with a child for which she had none, and that, all things concerned, the sooner he did die and stop talking the sooner everybody concerned would be made happy.  The other Philosopher replied mildly as he lit his pipe: “Brother, the greatest of all virtues is curiosity, and the end of all desire is wisdom; tell us, therefore, by what steps you have arrived at this commendable resolution.”  To this the Philosopher replied: “I have attained to all the wisdom which I am fitted to bear. In the space of one week no new truth has come to me. All that I have read lately I knew before; all that I have thought has been but a recapitulation of old and wearisome ideas. There is no longer an horizon before my eves. Space has narrowed to the petty dimensions of my thumb. Time is the tick of a clock. Good and evil are two peas in the one pod. My wife’s face is the same for ever. I want to play with the children, and yet I do not want to. Your conversation with me, brother, is like the droning of a bee in a dark cell. The pine trees take root and grow and die.--It’s all bosh. Good-bye.”  His friend replied:  “Brother, these are weighty reflections, and I do clearly perceive that the time has come for you to stop. I might observe, not in order to combat your views, but merely to continue an interesting conversation, that there are still some knowledges which you have not assimilated--you do not yet know how to play the tambourine, nor how to be nice to your wife, nor how to get up first in the morning and cook the breakfast. Have you learned how to smoke strong tobacco as I do? or can you dance in the moonlight with a woman of the Shee? To understand the theory which underlies all things is not sufficient. It has occurred to me, brother, that wisdom may not be the end of everything. Goodness and kindliness are, perhaps, beyond wisdom. Is it not possible that the ultimate end is gaiety and music and a dance of joy? Wisdom is the oldest of all things. Wisdom is all head and no heart. Behold, brother, you are being crushed under the weight of your head. You are dying of old age while you are yet a child.”  “Brother,” replied the other Philosopher, “your voice is like the droning of a bee in a dark cell. If in my latter days I am reduced to playing on the tambourine and running after a hag in the moonlight, and cooking your breakfast in the grey morning, then it is indeed time that I should die. Good-bye, brother.”  So saying, the Philosopher arose and removed all the furniture to the sides of the room so that there was a clear space left in the centre. He then took off his boots and his coat, and standing on his toes he commenced to gyrate with extraordinary rapidity. In a few moments his movements became steady and swift, and a sound came from him like the humming of a swift saw; this sound grew deeper and deeper, and at last continuous, so that the room was filled with a thrilling noise. In a quarter of an hour the movement began to noticeably slacken. In another three minutes it was quite slow. In two more minutes he grew visible again as a body, and then he wobbled to and fro, and at last dropped in a heap on the floor. He was quite dead, and on his face was an expression of serene beatitude.  “God be with you, brother,” said the remaining Philosopher, and he lit his pipe, focused his vision on the extreme tip of his nose, and began to meditate profoundly on the aphorism whether the good is the all or the all is the good. In another moment he would have become oblivious of the room, the company, and the corpse, but the Grey Woman of Dun Gortin shattered his meditation by a demand for advice as to what should next be done. The Philosopher, with an effort, detached his eyes from his nose and his mind from his maxim.  “Chaos,” said he, “is the first condition. Order is the first law. Continuity is the first reflection. Quietude is the first happiness. Our brother is dead--bury him.” So saying, he returned his eyes to his nose, and his mind to his maxim, and lapsed to a profound reflection wherein nothing sat perched on insubstantiality, and the Spirit of Artifice goggled at the puzzle.  The Grey Woman of Dun Gortin took a pinch of snuff from her box and raised the keen over her husband:  “You were my husband and you are dead.  It is wisdom that has killed you.  If you had listened to my wisdom instead of to your own you would still be a trouble to me and I would still be happy.  Women are stronger than men--they do not die of wisdom.  They are better than men because they do not seek wisdom.  They are wiser than men because they know less and understand more.  I had fourteen hundred maledictions, my little store, and by a trick you stole them and left me empty.  You stole my wisdom and it has broken your neck.  I lost my knowledge and I am yet alive raising the keen over your body, but it was too heavy for you, my little knowledge.  You will never go out into the pine wood in the morning, or wander abroad on a night of stars.  You will not sit in the chimney-corner on the hard nights, or go to bed, or rise again, or do anything at all from this day out.  Who will gather pine cones now when the fire is going down, or call my name in the empty house, or be angry when the kettle is not boiling?  Now I am desolate indeed. I have no knowledge, I have no husband, I have no more to say.”  “If I had anything better you should have it,” said she politely to the Thin Woman of Inis Magrath.  “Thank you,” said the Thin Woman, “it was very nice. Shall I begin now? My husband is meditating and we may be able to annoy him.”  “Don’t trouble yourself,” replied the other, “I am past enjoyment and am, moreover, a respectable woman.”  “That is no more than the truth, indeed.”  “I have always done the right thing at the right time.”  “I’d be the last body in the world to deny that,” was the warm response.  “Very well, then,” said the Grey Woman, and she commenced to take off her boots. She stood in the centre of the room and balanced herself on her toe.  “You are a decent, respectable lady,” said the Thin Woman of Inis Magrath, and then the Grey Woman began to gyrate rapidly and more rapidly until she was a very fervour of motion, and in three-quarters of an hour (for she was very tough) she began to slacken, grew visible, wobbled, and fell beside her dead husband, and on her face was a beatitude almost surpassing his.  The Thin Woman of Inis Magrath smacked the children and put them to bed, next she buried the two bodies under the hearthstone, and then, with some trouble, detached her husband from his meditations. When he became capable of ordinary occurrences she detailed all that had happened, and said that he alone was to blame for the sad bereavement. He replied:  “The toxin generates the anti-toxin. The end lies concealed in the beginning. All bodies grow around a skeleton. Life is a petticoat about death. I will not go to bed.”  CHAPTER III  ON the day following this melancholy occurrence Meehawl MacMurrachu, a small farmer in the neighbourhood, came through the pine trees with tangled brows. At the door of the little house he said, “God be with all here,” and marched in.  The Philosopher removed his pipe from his lips-“God be with yourself,”  said he, and he replaced his pipe.  Meehawl MacMurrachu crooked his thumb at space, “Where is the other one?”  said he.  “Ah!” said the Philosopher.  “He might be outside, maybe?”  “He might, indeed,” said the Philosopher gravely.  “Well, it doesn’t matter,” said the visitor, “for you have enough knowledge by yourself to stock a shop. The reason I came here to-day was to ask your honoured advice about my wife’s washing-board. She only has it a couple of years, and the last time she used it was when she washed out my Sunday shirt and her black skirt with the red things on it--you know the one?”  “I do not,” said the Philosopher.  “Well, anyhow, the washboard is gone, and my wife says it was either taken by the fairies or by Bessie Hannigan--you know Bessie Hannigan? She has whiskers like a goat and a lame leg!” “I do not,” said the Philosopher.  “No matter,” said Meehawl MacMurrachu. “She didn’t take"]]]
