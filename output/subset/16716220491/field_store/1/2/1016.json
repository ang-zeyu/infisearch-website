Of writers who manifest the archaizing tendency most conspicuously may be mentioned Fronto, from whose hand we have a collection of letters addressed to the Emperors Antoninus Pius and Marcus Aurelius; also Aulus Gellius, author of the \"Attic Nights.\" Both of these writers flourished in the second half of the second century A.D.  f. _The Period of the Decline_, from 180 to the close of literary activity in the sixth century A.D. This period is characterized by rapid and radical alterations in the language. The features of the conversational idiom of the lower strata of society invade the literature, while in the remote provinces, such as Gaul, Spain, Africa, the language suffers from the incorporation of local peculiarities. Representative writers of this period are:    Tertullian, about 160-about 240 A.D. (Christian Writer).   Cyprian, about 200-258 A.D. (Christian Writer).   Lactantius, flourished about 300 A.D. (Defense of Christianity).   Ausonius, about 310-about 395 A.D. (Poet).   Jerome, 340-420 A.D. (Translator of the Scriptures).   Ambrose, about 340-397 (Christian Father).   Augustine, 354-430 (Christian Father--\"City of God\").   Prudentius, flourished 400 A.D. (Christian Poet).   Claudian, flourished 400 A.D. (Poet).   Boëthius, about 480-524 A.D. (\"Consolation of Philosophy \").  4. Subsequent History of the Latin Language.--After the sixth century A.D. Latin divides into two entirely different streams. One of these is the literary language maintained in courts, in the Church, and among scholars. This was no longer the language of people in general, and as time went on, became more and more artificial. The other stream is the colloquial idiom of the common people, which developed ultimately in the provinces into the modern so-called Romance idioms. These are the Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, French, Provençal (spoken in Provence, i.e. southeastern France), the Rhaeto-Romance (spoken in the Canton of the Grisons in Switzerland), and the Roumanian, spoken in modern Roumania and adjacent districts. All these Romance languages bear the same relation to the Latin as the different groups of the Indo-European family of languages bear to the parent speech.         *       *       *       *       *  PART I.         *       *       *       *       *  SOUNDS, ACCENT, QUANTITY.         *       *       *       *       *  THE ALPHABET.  1. The Latin Alphabet is the same as the English, except that the Latin has no w.  1. K occurs only in _Kalendae_ and a few other words; y and z were introduced from the Greek about 50 B.C., and occur only in foreign words--chiefly Greek.  2. With the Romans, who regularly employed only capitals, I served both as vowel and consonant; so also V. For us, however, it is more convenient to distinguish the vowel and consonant sounds, and to write i and u for the former, j and v for the latter. Yet some scholars prefer to employ i and u in the function of consonants as well as vowels.  CLASSIFICATION OF SOUNDS.  2. 1. The Vowels are a, e, i, o, u, y. The other letters are Consonants. The Diphthongs are ae, oe, ei, au, eu, ui.  2. Consonants are further subdivided into Mutes, Liquids, Nasals, and Spirants.  3. The Mutes are p, t, c, k, q; b, d, g; ph, th, ch. Of these,--    a) p, t, c, k, q are voiceless,[4] i.e. sounded _without_ voice or   vibration of the vocal cords.    b) b, d, g are voiced,[5] i.e. sounded _with_ vibration of the vocal   cords.    c) ph, th, ch are aspirates. These are confined almost exclusively to   words derived from the Greek, and were equivalent to p + h, t + h, c + h,   i.e. to the corresponding voiceless mutes with a following breath, as in   Eng. _loop-hole_, _hot-house_, _block-house_.  4. The Mutes admit of classification also as    Labials,                        p, b, ph.   Dentals (or Linguals),          t, d, th.   Gutturals (or Palatals),        c, k, q, g, ch.  5. The Liquids are l, r. These sounds were voiced.  6. The Nasals are m, n. These were voiced. Besides its ordinary sound, n, when followed by a guttural mute also had another sound,--that of ng in _sing_,--the so-called n _adulterīnum_; as,--    anceps, _double_, pronounced angceps.  7. The Spirants (sometimes called Fricatives) are f, s, h. These were voiceless.  8. The Semivowels are j and v. These were voiced.  9. Double Consonants are x and z. Of these, x was equivalent to cs, while the equivalence of z is uncertain. See § 3, 3.  10. The following table will indicate the relations of the consonant sounds:--                   VOICELESS.     VOICED.      ASPIRATES.                      p,            b,           ph,       (Labials).   Mutes,             t,            d,           th,       (Dentals).                   c, k, q,         g,           ch,       (Gutturals).   Liquids,                       l, r,   Nasals,                        m, n,                      f,                                   (Labial).   Spirants,          s,                                   (Dental).                      h,                                   (Guttural).   Semivowels,                    j, v.    a. The Double Consonants, x and z, being compound sounds, do not admit of   classification in the above table.  SOUNDS OF THE LETTERS.  3. The following pronunciation (often called Roman) is substantially that employed by the Romans at the height of their civilization; i.e., roughly, from 50 B.C. to 50 A.D.  1. Vowels.    ā as in _father_;          ă as in the first syllable _ahá_;   ē as in _they_;            ĕ as in _met_;   ī as in _machine_;         ĭ as in _pin_;   ō as in _note_;            ŏ as in _obey_, _melody_;   ū as in _rude_;            ŭ as in _put_;   y like French _u_, German   _ü_.  2. Diphthongs.    ae like _ai_ in            eu with its two elements, ĕ and ŭ,   _aisle_;                   pronounced in rapid succession;   oe like _oi_ in _oil_;     ui occurs almost exclusively in   ei as in _rein_;           _cui_ and _huic_. These words may   au like _ow_ in _how_;     be pronounced as  though written                              _kwee_ and _wheek_.  3. Consonants.    b, d, f, h, k, l, m, n, p, qu are pronounced as in English, except that   bs, bt are pronounced _ps_, _pt_.    c is always pronounced as _k_.    t is always a plain _t_, never with the sound of _sh_ as in Eng.   _oration_.    g always as in _get_; when ngu precedes a vowel, gu has the sound of   _gw_, as in anguis, languidus.    j has the sound of _y_ as in _yet_.    r was probably slightly trilled with the tip of the tongue.    s always voiceless as in _sin_; in suādeō, suāvis, suēscō, and in   compounds and derivatives of these words, su has the sound of _sw_.    v like _w_.    x always like _ks_; never like Eng. _gz_ or _z_.    z uncertain in sound; possibly like Eng. _zd_, possibly like _z_. The   latter sound is recommended.    The aspirates ph, ch, th were pronounced very nearly like our stressed   Eng. _p_, c, _t_--so nearly so, that, for practical purposes, the latter   sounds suffice.    Doubled letters, like ll, mm, tt, etc., should be so pronounced that both   members of the combination are distinctly articulated.  SYLLABLES.  4. There are as many syllables in a Latin word as there are separate vowels and diphthongs.  In the division of words into syllables,--  1. A single consonant is joined to the following vowel; as, vo-lat, ge-rit, pe-rit, a-dest.  2. Doubled consonants, like tt, ss, etc., are always separated; as, vit-ta, mis-sus.  3. Other combinations of two or more consonants are regularly separated, and the first consonant of the combination is joined with the preceding vowel; as, ma-gis-trī, dig-nus, mōn-strum, sis-te-re.  4. An exception to Rule 3 occurs when the two consonants consist of a mute followed by l or r (pl, cl, tl; pr, cr, tr, etc.). In such cases both consonants are regularly joined to the following vowel; as, a-grī, vo-lu-cris, pa-tris, mā-tris. Yet if the l or r introduces the second part of a compound, the two consonants are separated; as, ab-rumpō, ad-lātus.  5. The double consonant x is joined to the preceding vowel; as, ax-is, tēx-ī.  QUANTITY.  5. A. Quantity of Vowels.  A vowel is _long_ or _short_ according to the length of time required for its pronunciation. No absolute rule can be given for determining the quantity of Latin vowels. This knowledge must be gained, in large measure, by experience; but the following principles are of aid:--  1. A vowel is long,[6]--    a) before nf or ns; as, īnfāns, īnferior, cōnsūmō, cēnseō, īnsum.    b) when the result of contraction; as, nīlum for nihilum.  2. A vowel is short,--    a) before nt, nd; as, amant, amandus. A few exceptions occur in compounds   whose first member has a long vowel; as, nōndum (nōn dum).    b) before another vowel, or h; as, meus, trahō. Some exceptions occur,   chiefly in proper names derived from the Greek; as, Aenēās.  B. Quantity of Syllables.  Syllables are distinguished as _long_ or _short_ according to the length of time required for their pronunciation.  1.

But of these, none marked with an asterisk belong to the Chinook or any of its dialects. The greater part of them are undoubtedly Nootkan, though there are errors in the spelling and, in some instances, in the meaning. Of the rest, the Nootkan _tchaak_ and the Chinook _tl'tsuk_ alone presents an analogy. _Klahowiah_ does not mean \"now,\" nor do I believe it is Nootkan, in any sense. It is, as explained in the dictionary, the Chinook salutation, \"How do you,\" \"Good-bye,\" and is supposed to be derived from the word for _poor_, _miserable_. _Mischemas_ is not Chinook, and is probably not Nootkan. With the exception of Franchere, whose short vocabulary was published by Mr. Gallatin, and Mr. Hale, all the writers mentioned by Ludwig who have given specimens of the Chinook language, have presented it in its Jargon form, more or less mixed with the neighboring ones, and with corruptions of French and English words. Mr. Swan, among others, has been led into this error. The place of his residence, Shoalwater Bay, is common ground of the Chinook and Chihalis Indians, and the degraded remnants of the two tribes are closely intermarried, and use both languages almost indifferently.  Setting aside interjections, common in a more or less modified form to several adjoining tribes, twenty-one words of those given in this vocabulary present noticeable analogies between the Chinook and other native languages. They are as follows:  _English._         _Chinook._      _Hailtzuk and Belbella._  salmon berries,    klalilli,       olalli.   _English._       _Chinook and Clatsop._    _Nootka._                                            Jewitt and Cook.  water,           tl'tsuk : tl'chukw,       chauk : chahak.   _English._    _Chinook._    _Cowlitz._    _Kwantlen._    _Selish._  six,          tákhum,       tukh'um,      tuckhum',      táckan.   _English._        _Chinook._    _Chihalis._    _Nisqually._  deep,             kellippe,     kluputl,       klep  glad,             kwan,                        kwal (_tame_)  proud,            eyútl,                       júil.  demon,            ichiatku,     tsiatko,       tsiatko.  black bear,       eitchhut,                    chetwut.  crow,             skaka,                       skaka.  oyster,           klokhklokh,   chetlókh,      klokhklokh.  game of \"hands,\"  itlokum,      setlokum.   _English._        _Chinook._    _Yakama and Klikatat._  certainly,        nawitka,      n'witka.  always,           kwanisum,     kwálisim.  younger sister,   ats,          atse.  road,             wehut,        wiet (_far_).  barrel,           tamtúlitsh,   tamolitsh.  buffalo,          emúsmus,      músmus.  coyote,           itálipus,     talipa (_gray fox_).  mouse,            kholkhol,     khóilkhoil.  bread,            tsapelil,     saplil.  needle,           okwépowa,     kapus (_a pin_).  The Clatsop (Klátsop) is merely a dialect of the Chinook (Tchinúk); the Cowlitz (Káualitsk), Kwantlen, Chihalis (Tsihélis), and Nisqually (N'skwáli), are severally languages belonging to the Sélish family. The Yakama and Klikatat are dialects of one of the Sahaptin languages; and the Tokwaht (Tokwát), Nittinat, and Makah (Maká), quoted in the dictionary, are dialects of the Nootka (Nútka), of which the Hailtzuk or Belbella (variously spelled Haeeltzuk and Hailtsa) is probably the northern type. It thus appears that, with two or three exceptions, the analogies of the Chinook, as contained in this vocabulary, are to be sought in the immediately adjoining tongues, or those of languages belonging to the same families with them; that these analogies, with perhaps one or two exceptions, can by no means be considered radical, and that their correspondence, or rather adoption, is easily accounted for by neighborhood and habits of intermarriage. A much more remarkable coincidence is the fact that two words included in this Jargon,--one from the Nootkan, viz., _Mawitch_, a deer, venison; and the other Chinook, _Mooluk_, an elk,--are also to be found in the Kowilth, the language of Humboldt Bay, in California. As this bay was first discovered in the winter of 1849-50, the words could not have been introduced by the fur trappers.  With regard to the form into which this dictionary has been thrown, an explanation is necessary. The Jargon must in some degree be regarded as a written language, the orthography of which is English. In Mr. Hale's vocabulary alone has one more scientific been attempted, and of several other printed, and numerous manuscript dictionaries in circulation, M. Lionnet's alone, that I have met with, is according to the French. Although no fixed system of spelling exists among them, I have therefore deemed it best to preserve for the Jargon words that which most distinctly represents the common English pronunciation; while for the Indian derivations, I have adopted that recommended by the Smithsonian Institution in collecting Indian vocabularies, using the Italian sounds of the vowels, and representing the guttural of the German _ich_ by _kh_. This seemed the more proper, as the work would thereby be rendered of practical use, independent of what philological value it may possess.  In collating the words of the present work and obtaining their derivations, I have been assisted by a number of friends; among whom I should specially mention Mr. Alexander C. Anderson, of Victoria, V.I., and Mr. Solomon H. Smith, of Clatsop, Oregon.     ~Bibliography of the Chinook Jargon.~   _Journal of Travels over the Rocky Mountains._ By Rev. Samuel Parker. 12mo.
