In the same spiritual condition I have been able to replace dislocated joints and raise the dying to instantaneous health. People are now living who can bear witness to these cures. Herein is my evidence, from on high, that the views here promulgated on this subject are correct.  Certain self-proved propositions pour into my waiting thought in connection with these experiences; and here is one such conviction: that an acknowledgment of the perfection of the infinite Unseen confers a power nothing else can. An incontestable point in divine Science is, that because God is All, a realization of this fact dispels even the sense or consciousness of sin, and brings us nearer to God, bringing out the highest phenomena of the All-Mind.     Seedtime and Harvest   Let another query now be considered, which gives much trouble to many earnest thinkers before Science answers it.   _Is anything real of which the physical senses are cognizant?_  Everything is as real as you make it, and no more so. What you see, hear, feel, is a mode of consciousness, and can have no other reality than the sense you entertain of it.  It is dangerous to rest upon the evidence of the senses, for this evidence is not absolute, and therefore not real, in our sense of the word. All that is beautiful and good in your individual consciousness is permanent. That which is not so is illusive and fading. My insistence upon a proper understanding of the unreality of matter and evil arises from their deleterious effects, physical, moral, and intellectual, upon the race.  All forms of error are uprooted in Science, on the same basis whereby sickness is healed,--namely, by the establishment, through reason, revelation, and Science, of the nothingness of every claim of error, even the doctrine of heredity and other physical causes. You demonstrate the process of Science, and it proves my view conclusively, that mortal mind is the cause of all disease. Destroy the mental sense of the disease, and the disease itself disappears. Destroy the sense of sin, and sin itself disappears.  Material and sensual consciousness are mortal. Hence they must, some time and in some way, be reckoned unreal. That time has partially come, or my words would not have been spoken. Jesus has made the way plain,--so plain that all are without excuse who walk not in it; but this way is not the path of physical science, human philosophy, or mystic psychology.  The talent and genius of the centuries have wrongly reckoned. They have not based upon revelation their arguments and conclusions as to the source and resources of being,--its combinations, phenomena, and outcome,--but have built instead upon the sand of human reason. They have not accepted the simple teaching and life of Jesus as the only true solution of the perplexing problem of human existence.  Sometimes it is said, by those who fail to understand me, that I _monopolize_; and this is said because ideas akin to mine have been held by a few spiritual thinkers in all ages. So they have, but in a far different form. Healing has gone on continually; yet healing, as I teach it, has not been practised since the days of Christ.  What is the cardinal point of the difference in my metaphysical system? This: that _by knowing the unreality of disease, sin, and death_, you demonstrate the allness of God. This difference wholly separates my system from all others. The reality of these so-called existences I deny, because they are not to be found in God, and this system is built on Him as the sole cause. It would be difficult to name any previous teachers, save Jesus and his apostles, who have thus taught.  If there be any _monopoly_ in my teaching, it lies in this utter reliance upon the one God, to whom belong all things.  Life is God, or Spirit, the supersensible eternal. The universe and man are the spiritual phenomena of this one infinite Mind. Spiritual phenomena never converge toward aught but infinite Deity. Their gradations are spiritual and divine; they cannot collapse, or lapse into their opposites, for God is their divine Principle. They live, because He lives; and they are eternally perfect, because He is perfect, and governs them in the Truth of divine Science, whereof God is the Alpha and Omega, the centre and circumference.  To attempt the calculation of His mighty ways, from the evidence before the material senses, is fatuous. It is like commencing with the minus sign, to learn the principle of positive mathematics.  God was not in the whirlwind. He is not the blind force of a material universe. Mortals must learn this; unless, pursued by their fears, they would endeavor to hide from His presence under their own falsities, and call in vain for the mountains of unholiness to shield them from the penalty of error.  Jesus taught us to walk _over_, not _into_ or _with_, the currents of matter, or mortal mind. His teachings beard the lions in their dens. He turned the water into wine, he commanded the winds, he healed the sick,--all in direct opposition to human philosophy and so-called natural science. He annulled the laws of matter, showing them to be laws of mortal mind, not of God. He showed the need of changing this mind and its abortive laws. He demanded a change of consciousness and evidence, and effected this change through the higher laws of God. The palsied hand moved, despite the boastful sense of physical law and order. Jesus stooped not to human consciousness, nor to the evidence of the senses. He heeded not the taunt, \"That withered hand looks very real and feels very real;\" but he cut off this vain boasting and destroyed human pride by taking away the material evidence. If his patient was a theologian of some bigoted sect, a physician, or a professor of natural philosophy,--according to the ruder sort then prevalent,--he never thanked Jesus for restoring his senseless hand; but neither red tape nor indignity hindered the divine process. Jesus required neither cycles of time nor thought in order to mature fitness for perfection and its possibilities. He said that the kingdom of heaven is here, and is included in Mind; that while ye say, There are yet four months, and _then_ cometh the harvest, I say, Look up, not down, for your fields are already white for the harvest; and gather the harvest by mental, not material processes. The laborers are few in this vineyard of Mind-sowing and reaping; but let them apply to the waiting grain the curving sickle of Mind's eternal circle, and bind it with bands of Soul.     The Deep Things of God   Science reverses the evidence of the senses in theology, on the same principle that it does in astronomy. Popular theology makes God tributary to man, coming at human call; whereas the reverse is true in Science. Men must approach God reverently, doing their own work in obedience to divine law, if they would fulfil the intended harmony of being.  The principle of music knows nothing of discord. God is harmony's selfhood. His universal laws, His unchangeableness, are not infringed in ethics any more than in music. To Him there is no moral inharmony; as we shall learn, proportionately as we gain the true understanding of Deity. If God could be conscious of sin, His infinite power would straightway reduce the universe to chaos.  If God has any real knowledge of sin, sickness, and death, they must be eternal; since He is, in the very fibre of His being, \"without beginning of years or end of days.\" If God knows that which is not permanent, it follows that He knows something which He must learn to _unknow_, for the benefit of our race.  Such a view would bring us upon an outworn theological platform, which contains such planks as the divine repentance, and the belief that God must one day do His work over again, because it was not at first done aright.  Can it be seriously held, by any thinker, that long after God made the universe,--earth, man, animals, plants, the sun, the moon, and \"the stars also,\"--He should so gain wisdom and power from past experience that He could vastly improve upon His own previous work,--as Burgess, the boatbuilder, remedies in the Volunteer the shortcomings of the Puritan's model?  Christians are commanded to _grow in grace_. Was it necessary for God to grow in grace, that He might rectify His spiritual universe?  The Jehovah of limited Hebrew faith might need repentance, because His created children proved sinful; but the New Testament tells us of \"the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.\" God is not the shifting vane on the spire, but the corner-stone of living rock, firmer than everlasting hills.  As God is Mind, if this Mind is familiar with evil, all cannot be good therein. Our infinite model would be taken away. What is in eternal Mind must be reflected in man, Mind's image. How then could man escape, or hope to escape, from a knowledge which is everlasting in his creator?  God never said that man would become better by learning to distinguish evil from good,--but the contrary, that by this knowledge, by man's first disobedience, came \"death into the world, and all our woe.\"  \"Shall mortal man be more just than God?\" asks the poet-patriarch. May men rid themselves of an incubus which God never can throw off? Do mortals know more than God, that they may declare Him absolutely cognizant of sin?  God created all things, and pronounced them good. Was evil among these good things? Man is God's child and image. If God knows evil, so must man, or the likeness is incomplete, the image marred.  If man must be destroyed by the knowledge of evil, then his destruction comes through the very knowledge caught from God, and the creature is punished for his likeness to his creator.  God is commonly called the _sinless_, and man the _sinful_; but if the thought of sin could be possible in Deity, would Deity then be sinless? "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16591"],["title","Unity of Good (#2)"],["body","God not of necessity take precedence as the infinite sinner, and human sin become only an echo of the divine?  Such vagaries are to be found in heathen religious history. There are, or have been, devotees who worship not the good Deity, who will not harm them, but the bad deity, who seeks to do them mischief, and whom therefore they wish to bribe with prayers into quiescence, as a criminal appeases, with a money-bag, the venal officer.  Surely this is no Christian worship! In Christianity man bows to the infinite perfection which he is bidden to imitate. In Truth, such terms as _divine sin_ and _infinite sinner_ are unheard-of contradictions,--absurdities; but _would_ they be sheer nonsense, if God has, or can have, a real knowledge of sin?     Ways Higher than Our Ways   A lie has only one chance of successful deception,--to be accounted true. Evil seeks to fasten all error upon God, and so make the lie seem part of eternal Truth.  Emerson says, \"Hitch your wagon to a star.\" I say, Be allied to the deific power, and all that is good will aid your journey, as the stars in their courses fought against Sisera. (Judges v. 20.) Hourly, in Christian Science, man thus weds himself with God, or rather he ratifies a union predestined from all eternity; but evil ties its wagon-load of offal to the divine chariots,--or seeks so to do,--that its vileness may be christened purity, and its darkness get consolation from borrowed scintillations.  Jesus distinctly taught the arrogant Pharisees that, from the beginning, their father, the devil, was the would-be murderer of Truth. A right apprehension of the wonderful utterances of him who \"spake as never man spake,\" would despoil error of its borrowed plumes, and transform the universe into a home of marvellous light,--\"a consummation devoutly to be wished.\"  Error says God must know evil because He knows all things; but Holy Writ declares God told our first parents that in the day when they should partake of the fruit of evil, they must surely die. Would it not absurdly follow that God must perish, if He knows evil and evil necessarily leads to extinction? Rather let us think of God as saying, I am infinite good; therefore I know not evil. Dwelling in light, I can see only the brightness of My own glory.  Error may say that God can never save man from sin, if He knows and sees it not; but God says, I am too pure to behold iniquity, and destroy everything that is unlike Myself.  Many fancy that our heavenly Father reasons thus: If pain and sorrow were not in My mind, I could not remedy them, and wipe the tears from the eyes of My children. Error says you must know grief in order to console it. Truth, God, says you oftenest console others in troubles that you have not. Is not our comforter always from outside and above ourselves?  God says, I show My pity through divine law, not through human. It is My sympathy with and My knowledge of harmony (not inharmony) which alone enable Me to rebuke, and eventually destroy, every supposition of discord.  Error says God must know death in order to strike at its root; but God saith, I am ever-conscious Life, and thus I conquer death; for to be ever conscious of Life is to be never conscious of death. I am All. A knowledge of aught beside Myself is impossible.  If such knowledge of evil were possible to God, it would lower His rank.  With God, _knowledge_ is necessarily _foreknowledge_; and _foreknowledge_ and _foreordination_ must be one, in an infinite Being. What Deity _foreknows_, Deity must _foreordain_; else He is not omnipotent, and, like ourselves, He foresees events which are contrary to His creative will, yet which He cannot avert.  If God knows evil at all, He must have had foreknowledge thereof; and if He foreknew it, He must virtually have intended it, or ordered it aforetime,--foreordained it; else how could it have come into the world?  But this we cannot believe of God; for if the supreme good could predestine or foreknow evil, there would be sin in Deity, and this would be the end of infinite moral unity. \"If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness!\" On the contrary, evil is only a delusive deception, without any actuality which Truth can know.     Rectifications   How is a mistake to be rectified? By reversal or revision,--by seeing it in its proper light, and then turning it or turning from it.  We undo the statements of error by reversing them.  Through these three statements, or misstatements, evil comes into authority:--      _First:_ The Lord created it.     _Second:_ The Lord knows it.     _Third:_ I am afraid of it.  By a reverse process of argument evil must be dethroned:--      _First:_ God never made evil.     _Second:_ He knows it not.     _Third:_ We therefore need not fear it.  Try this process, dear inquirer, and so reach that perfect Love which \"casteth out fear,\" and then see if this Love does not destroy in you all hate and the sense of evil. You will awake to the perception of God as All-in-all. You will find yourself losing the knowledge and the operation of sin, proportionably as you realize the divine infinitude and believe that He can see nothing outside of His own focal distance.     A Colloquy   In Romans (ii. 15) we read the apostle's description of mental processes wherein human thoughts are \"the mean while accusing or else excusing one another.\" If we observe our mental processes, we shall find that we are perpetually arguing with ourselves; yet each mortal is not two personalities, but one.  In like manner good and evil talk to one another; yet they are not two but one, for evil is naught, and good only is reality.  _Evil._ God hath said, \"Ye shall eat of every tree of the garden.\" If you do not, your intellect will be circumscribed and the evidence of your personal senses be denied. This would antagonize individual consciousness and existence.  _Good._ The Lord is God. With Him is no consciousness of evil, because there is nothing beside Him or outside of Him. Individual consciousness in man is inseparable from good. There is no sensible matter, no sense in matter; but there is a spiritual sense, a sense of Spirit, and this is the only consciousness belonging to true individuality, or a divine sense of being.  _Evil._ Why is this so?  _Good._ Because man is made after God's eternal likeness, and this likeness consists in a sense of harmony and immortality, in which no evil can possibly dwell. You may eat of the fruit of Godlikeness, but as to the fruit of ungodliness, which is opposed to Truth,--ye shall not touch it, lest ye die.  _Evil._ But I would taste and know error for myself.  _Good._ Thou shalt not admit that error is something to know or be known, to eat or be eaten, to see or be seen, to feel or be felt. To admit the existence of error would be to admit the truth of a lie.  _Evil._ But there is something besides good. God knows that a knowledge of this something is essential to happiness and life. A lie is as genuine as Truth, though not so legitimate a child of God. Whatever exists must come from God, and be important to our knowledge. Error, even, is His offspring.  _Good._ Whatever cometh not from the eternal Spirit, has its origin in the physical senses and material brains, called _human intellect_ and _will-power_,--_alias_ intelligent matter.  In Shakespeare's tragedy of King Lear, it was the traitorous and cruel treatment received by old Gloster from his bastard son Edmund which makes true the lines:      The gods are just, and of our pleasant vices     Make instruments to scourge us.  His lawful son, Edgar, was to his father ever loyal. Now God has no bastards to turn again and rend their Maker. The divine children are born of law and order, and Truth knows only such.  How well the Shakespearean tale agrees with the word of Scripture, in Hebrews xii. 7, 8: \"If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not? But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons.\"  The doubtful or spurious evidence of the senses is not to be admitted,--especially when they testify concerning Spirit, whereof they are confessedly incompetent to speak.  _Evil._ But mortal mind and sin really exist!  _Good._ How can they exist, unless God has created them? And how can He create anything so wholly unlike Himself and foreign to His nature? An evil material mind, so-called, can conceive of God only as like itself, and knowing both evil and good; but a purely good and spiritual consciousness has no sense whereby to cognize evil. Mortal mind is the opposite of immortal Mind, and sin the opposite of goodness. I am the infinite All. From me proceedeth all Mind, all consciousness, all individuality, all being. My Mind is divine good, and cannot drift into evil. To believe in minds many is to depart from the supreme sense of harmony. Your assumptions insist that there is more than the one Mind, more than the one God; but verily I say unto you, God is All-in-all; and you can never be outside of His oneness.  _Evil._ I am a finite consciousness, a material individuality,--a mind in matter, which is both evil and good.  _Good._ All consciousness is Mind; and Mind is God,--an infinite, and not a finite consciousness. This consciousness is reflected in individual consciousness, or man, whose source is infinite Mind. There is no really finite mind, no finite consciousness. There is no material substance, for Spirit is all that endureth, and hence is the only substance. There is, can be, no evil mind, because Mind is God. God and His ideas--that is, God and the universe--constitute all that exists. Man, as God's offspring, must be spiritual, perfect, eternal.  _Evil._ I am something separate from good or God. I am substance. My mind is more than matter. In my mortal mind, matter becomes conscious, and is able to see, taste, hear, feel, smell. Whatever matter thus"]]]
