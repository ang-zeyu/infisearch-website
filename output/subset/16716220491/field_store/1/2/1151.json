And all true Greeks and wise are there;    And with his hand upon the hair       Of Phaedo, saw I Socrates,    About him many youths and fair,       Hylas, Narcissus, and with these    Him whom the quoit of Phoebus slew       By fleet Eurotas, unaware!     All these their mirth and pleasure made       Within the plain Elysian,          The fairest meadow that may be,    With all green fragrant trees for shade       And every scented wind to fan,          And sweetest flowers to strew the lea;    The soft Winds are their servants fleet       To fetch them every fruit at will       And water from the river chill;    And every bird that singeth sweet       Throstle, and merle, and nightingale       Brings blossoms from the dewy vale,—    Lily, and rose, and asphodel—       With these doth each guest twine his crown       And wreathe his cup, and lay him down          Beside some friend he loveth well.     There with the shining Souls I lay    When, lo, a Voice that seemed to say,       In far-off haunts of Memory,    _Whoso death taste the Dead Men’s bread_,    _Shall dwell for ever with these Dead_,       _Nor ever shall his body lie_    _Beside his friends_, _on the grey hill_    _Where rains weep_, _and the curlews shrill_       _And the brown water wanders by_!     Then did a new soul in me wake,    The dead men’s bread I feared to break,    Their fruit I would not taste indeed    Were it but a pomegranate seed.    Nay, not with these I made my choice    To dwell for ever and rejoice,    For otherwhere the River rolls    That girds the home of Christian souls,    And these my whole heart seeks are found    On otherwise enchanted ground.     Even so I put the cup away,       The vision wavered, dimmed, and broke,       And, nowise sorrowing, I woke    While, grey among the ruins grey    Chill through the dwellings of the dead,       The Dawn crept o’er the Northern sea,    Then, in a moment, flushed to red,       Flushed all the broken minster old,       And turned the shattered stones to gold,    And wakened half the world with me!   L’Envoi.                                  To E. W. G.           (Who also had rhymed on the Fortune Islands of Lucian).     _Each in the self-same field we glean_    _The field of the Samosatene_,    _Each something takes and something leaves_       _And this must choose_, _and that forego_    _In Lucian’s visionary sheaves_,       _To twine a modern posy so_;    _But all any gleanings_, _truth to tell_,    _Are mixed with mournful asphodel_,    _While yours are wreathed with poppies red_,       _With flowers that Helen’s feet have kissed_,    _With leaves of vine that garlanded_       _The Syrian Pantagruelist_,    _The sage who laughed the world away_,       _Who mocked at Gods_, _and men_, _and care_,    _More sweet of voice than Rabelais_,       _And lighter-hearted than Voltaire_.    THE NEW MILLENIUM.                          (_THE UNFORTUNATE ISLANDS_.)    A VISION IN THE STRAND.      THE jaded light of late July       Shone yellow down the dusty Strand,    The anxious people bustled by,    Policeman, Pressman, you and I,       And thieves, and judges of the land.     So swift they strode they had not time       To mark the humours of the Town,    But I, that mused an idle rhyme,       Looked here and there, and up and down,    And many a rapid cart I spied       That drew, as fast as ponies can,    The Newspapers of either side,       These joys of every Englishman!     The _Standard_ here, the _Echo_ there,    And cultured ev’ning papers fair,    With din and fuss and shout and blare    Through all the eager land they bare,       The rumours of our little span.     ’Midst these, but ah, more slow of speed,       A biggish box of sanguine hue    Was tugged on a velocipede,       And in and out the crowd, and through,    An earnest stripling urged it well    Perched on a cranky tricycle!     A seedy tricycle he rode,       Perchance some three miles in the hour,    But, on the big red box that glowed       Behind him, was a name of Power,    _JUSTICE_, (I read it e’er I wist,)    _The Organ of the Socialist_!     The paper carts fled fleetly by       And vanished up the roaring Strand,    And eager purchasers drew nigh       Each with his penny in his hand,    But _Justice_, scarce more fleet than I,       Began to permeate the land,    And dark, methinks, the twilight fell,       Or ever _Justice_ reached Pall Mall.     Oh Man, (I stopped to moralize,)       How eager thou to fight with Fate,    To bring Astraea from the skies;       Yet ah, how too inadequate    The means by which thou fain wouldst cope    With Laws and Morals, King and Pope!    “_Justice_!”—how prompt the witling’s sneer,—    “Justice!  Thou wouldst have Justice here!    And each poor man should be a squire,    Each with his competence a year,    Each with sufficient beef and beer,       And all things matched to his desire,    While all the Middle Classes should       With every vile Capitalist    Be clean reformed away for good,       And vanish like a morning mist!     “Ah splendid Vision, golden time,    An end of hunger, cold, and crime.    An end of Rent, an end of Rank,    An end of balance at the Bank,    An end of everything that’s meant    To bring Investors five per cent!”     How fair doth Justice seem, I cried,       Yet oh, how strong the embattled powers    That war against on every side       Justice, and this great dream of ours,    And what have we to plead our cause    ’Gainst Masters, Capital, and laws,    What but a big red box indeed,    With copies of a weekly screed,       That’s slowly jolted, up and down,    Behind an old velocipede       To clamour _Justice_ through the town:    How touchingly inadequate    These arms wherewith we’d vanquish Fate!     Nay, the old Order shall endure       And little change the years shall know,    And still the Many shall be poor,       And still the Poor shall dwell in woe;    Firm in the iron Law of things       The strong shall be the wealthy still,    And (called Capitalists or Kings)       Shall seize and hoard the fruits of skill.    Leaving the weaker for their gain,       Leaving the gentler for their prize    Such dens and husks as beasts disdain,—       Till slowly from the wrinkled skies    The fireless frozen Sun shall wane,    Nor Summer come with golden grain;       Till men be glad, mid frost and snow    To live such equal lives of pain       As now the hutted Eskimo!    Then none shall plough nor garner seed,       Then, on some last sad human shore,    Equality shall reign indeed,       The Rich shall be with us no more,    Thus, and not otherwise, shall come    The new, the true Millennium!     ALMAE MATRES.                       (ST. ANDREWS, 1862.  OXFORD, 1865)     _St. Andrews by the Northern sea_,       _A haunted town it is to me_!    A little city, worn and grey,       The grey North Ocean girds it round.    And o’er the rocks, and up the bay,       The long sea-rollers surge and sound.    And still the thin and biting spray       Drives down the melancholy street,    And still endure, and still decay,       Towers that the salt winds vainly beat.    Ghost-like and shadowy they stand    Dim mirrored in the wet sea-sand.     St. Leonard’s chapel, long ago       We loitered idly where the tall    Fresh budded mountain ashes blow       Within thy desecrated wall:    The tough roots rent the tomb below,       The April birds sang clamorous,    We did not dream, we could not know       How hardly Fate would deal with us!     O, broken minster, looking forth       Beyond the bay, above the town,    O, winter of the kindly North,       O, college of the scarlet gown,    And shining sands beside the sea,       And stretch of links beyond the sand,    Once more I watch you, and to me       It is as if I touched his hand!     And therefore art thou yet more dear,       O, little city, grey and sere,    Though shrunken from thine ancient pride       And lonely by thy lonely sea,    Than these fair halls on Isis’ side,       Where Youth an hour came back to me!     A land of waters green and clear,       Of willows and of poplars tall,    And, in the spring time of the year,       The white may breaking over all,    And Pleasure quick to come at call.       And summer rides by marsh and wold,    And Autumn with her crimson pall       About the towers of Magdalen rolled;    And strange enchantments from the past,       And memories of the friends of old,    And strong Tradition, binding fast       The “flying terms” with bands of gold,—     All these hath Oxford: all are dear,       But dearer far the little town,    The drifting surf, the wintry year,       The college of the scarlet gown,          _St. Andrews by the Northern sea_,          _That is a haunted town to me_!     DESIDERIUM.                              IN MEMORIAM S. F. A.     THE call of homing rooks, the shrill       Song of some bird that watches late,    The cries of children break the still       Sad twilight by the churchyard gate.     And o’er your far-off tomb the grey       Sad twilight broods, and from the trees    The rooks call on their homeward way,       And are you heedless quite of these?     The clustered rowan berries red       And Autumn’s may, the clematis,    They droop above your dreaming head,       And these, and all things must you miss?     Ah, you that loved the twilight air,       The dim lit hour of quiet best,    At last, at last you have your share       Of what life gave so seldom, rest!     Yes, rest beyond all dreaming deep,       Or labour, nearer the Divine,    And pure from fret, and smooth as sleep,       And gentle as thy soul, is thine!     So let it be!  But could I know       That thou in this soft autumn eve,    This hush of earth that pleased thee so,       Hadst pleasure still, I might not grieve.     RHYMES A "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1645"],["title","Rhymes a la Mode (#2)"],["body","MODE.   BALLADE OF MIDDLE AGE.      OUR youth began with tears and sighs,    With seeking what we could not find;    Our verses all were threnodies,    In elegiacs still we whined;    Our ears were deaf, our eyes were blind,    We sought and knew not what we sought.    We marvel, now we look behind:    Life’s more amusing than we thought!     Oh, foolish youth, untimely wise!    Oh, phantoms of the sickly mind!    What? not content with seas and skies,    With rainy clouds and southern wind,    With common cares and faces kind,    With pains and joys each morning brought?    Ah, old, and worn, and tired we find    Life’s more amusing than we thought!     Though youth “turns spectre-thin and dies,”    To mourn for youth we’re not inclined;    We set our souls on salmon flies,    We whistle where we once repined.    Confound the woes of human-kind!    By Heaven we’re “well deceived,” I wot;    Who hum, contented or resigned,    “Life’s more amusing than we thought!”                                     ENVOY.     _O nate mecum_, worn and lined    Our faces show, but _that_ is naught;    Our hearts are young ’neath wrinkled rind:    Life’s more amusing than we thought!    THE LAST CAST.                             THE ANGLER’S APOLOGY.     JUST one cast more! how many a year       Beside how many a pool and stream,    Beneath the falling leaves and sere,       I’ve sighed, reeled up, and dreamed my dream!     Dreamed of the sport since April first       Her hands fulfilled of flowers and snow,    Adown the pastoral valleys burst       Where Ettrick and where Teviot flow.     Dreamed of the singing showers that break,       And sting the lochs, or near or far,    And rouse the trout, and stir “the take”       From Urigil to Lochinvar.     Dreamed of the kind propitious sky       O’er Ari Innes brooding grey;    The sea trout, rushing at the fly,       Breaks the black wave with sudden spray!                                    * * * * *     Brief are man’s days at best; perchance       I waste my own, who have not seen    The castled palaces of France       Shine on the Loire in summer green.     And clear and fleet Eurotas still,       You tell me, laves his reedy shore,    And flows beneath his fabled hill       Where Dian drave the chase of yore.     And “like a horse unbroken” yet       The yellow stream with rush and foam,    ’Neath tower, and bridge, and parapet,       Girdles his ancient mistress, Rome!     I may not see them, but I doubt       If seen I’d find them half so fair    As ripples of the rising trout       That feed beneath the elms of Yair.     Nay, Spring I’d meet by Tweed or Ail,       And Summer by Loch Assynt’s deep,    And Autumn in that lonely vale       Where wedded Avons westward sweep,     Or where, amid the empty fields,       Among the bracken of the glen,    Her yellow wreath October yields,       To crown the crystal brows of Ken.     Unseen, Eurotas, southward steal,       Unknown, Alpheus, westward glide,    You never heard the ringing reel,       The music of the water side!     Though Gods have walked your woods among,       Though nymphs have fled your banks along;    You speak not that familiar tongue       Tweed murmurs like my cradle song.     My cradle song,—nor other hymn       I’d choose, nor gentler requiem dear    Than Tweed’s, that through death’s twilight dim,       Mourned in the latest Minstrel’s ear!    TWILIGHT.                                    SONNET.                              (AFTER RICHEPIN.)     LIGHT has flown!    Through the grey    The wind’s way    The sea’s moan    Sound alone!       For the day       These repay    And atone!     Scarce I know,    Listening so       To the streams          Of the sea,       If old dreams          Sing to me!    BALLADE OF SUMMER.                                TO C. H. ARKCOLL     WHEN strawberry pottles are common and cheap,    Ere elms be black, or limes be sere,    When midnight dances are murdering sleep,    Then comes in the sweet o’ the year!    And far from Fleet Street, far from here,    The Summer is Queen in the length of the land,    And moonlit nights they are soft and clear,    When fans for a penny are sold in the Strand!     When clamour that doves in the lindens keep    Mingles with musical plash of the weir,    Where drowned green tresses of crowsfoot creep,    Then comes in the sweet o’ the year!    And better a crust and a beaker of beer,    With rose-hung hedges on either hand,    Than a palace in town and a prince’s cheer,    When fans for a penny are sold in the Strand!     When big trout late in the twilight leap,    When cuckoo clamoureth far and near,    When glittering scythes in the hayfield reap,    Then comes in the sweet o’ the year!    And it’s oh to sail, with the wind to steer,    Where kine knee deep in the water stand,    On a Highland loch, on a Lowland mere,    When fans for a penny are sold in the Strand!                                     ENVOY.     Friend, with the fops while we dawdle here,    Then comes in the sweet o’ the year!    And the Summer runs out, like grains of sand,    When fans for a penny are sold in the Strand!    BALLADE OF CHRISTMAS GHOSTS.      BETWEEN the moonlight and the fire    In winter twilights long ago,    What ghosts we raised for your desire    To make your merry blood run slow!    How old, how grave, how wise we grow!    No Christmas ghost can make us chill,    Save _those_ that troop in mournful row,    The ghosts we all can raise at will!     The beasts can talk in barn and byre    On Christmas Eve, old legends know,    As year by year the years retire,    We men fall silent then I trow,    Such sights hath Memory to show,    Such voices from the silence thrill,    Such shapes return with Christmas snow,—    The ghosts we all can raise at will.     Oh, children of the village choir,    Your carols on the midnight throw,    Oh bright across the mist and mire    Ye ruddy hearths of Christmas glow!    Beat back the dread, beat down the woe,    Let’s cheerily descend the hill;    Be welcome all, to come or go,    The ghosts we all can raise at will!                                     ENVOY.     Friend, _sursum corda_, soon or slow    We part, like guests who’ve joyed their fill;    Forget them not, nor mourn them so,    The ghosts we all can raise at will!    LOVE’S EASTER.                                     SONNET     LOVE died here    Long ago;—    O’er his bier,       Lying low,       Poppies throw;          Shed no tear;          Year by year,       Roses blow!     Year by year,    Adon—dear       To Love’s Queen—          Does not die!       Wakes when green          May is nigh!    BALLADE OF THE GIRTON GIRL.      SHE has just “put her gown on” at Girton,       She is learned in Latin and Greek,    But lawn tennis she plays with a skirt on       That the prudish remark with a shriek.    In her accents, perhaps, she is weak       (Ladies _are_, one observes with a sigh),    But in Algebra—_there_ she’s unique,       But her forte’s to evaluate π.     She can talk about putting a “spirt on”       (I admit, an unmaidenly freak),    And she dearly delighteth to flirt on       A punt in some shadowy creek;    Should her bark, by mischance, spring a leak,       She can swim as a swallow can fly;    She can fence, she can put with a cleek,       But her forte’s to evaluate π.     She has lectured on Scopas and Myrton,       Coins, vases, mosaics, the antique,    Old tiles with the secular dirt on,       Old marbles with noses to seek.    And her Cobet she quotes by the week,       And she’s written on κεν and on καὶ,    And her service is swift and oblique,       But her forte’s to evaluate π.                                     ENVOY.     Princess, like a rose is her cheek,       And her eyes are as blue as the sky,    And I’d speak, had I courage to speak,       But—her forte’s to evaluate pi.    RONSARD’S GRAVE.      YE wells, ye founts that fall    From the steep mountain wall,       That fall, and flash, and fleet          With silver feet,     Ye woods, ye streams that lave    The meadows with your wave,       Ye hills, and valley fair,          Attend my prayer!     When Heaven and Fate decree    My latest hour for me,       When I must pass away          From pleasant day,     I ask that none my break    The marble for my sake,       Wishful to make more fair          My sepulchre.     Only a laurel tree    Shall shade the grave of me,       Only Apollo’s bough          Shall guard me now!     Now shall I be at rest    Among the spirits blest,       The happy dead that dwell—          Where,—who may tell?     The snow and wind and hail    May never there prevail,       Nor ever thunder fall          Nor storm at all.     But always fadeless there    The woods are green and fair,       And faithful ever more          Spring to that shore!     There shall I ever hear    Alcaeus’ music clear,       And sweetest of all things          There SAPPHO sings.    SAN TERENZO.    (The village in the bay of Spezia, near which Shelley was living before                        the wreck of the Don Juan.)     MID April seemed like some November day,       When through the glassy waters, dull as lead,    Our boat, like shadowy barques that bear the dead,       Slipped down the long shores of the Spezian bay,       Rounded a point,—and San Terenzo lay    Before us, that gay village, yellow and red,    The roof that covered Shelley’s homeless head,—       His house, a place deserted, bleak and grey.     The waves broke on the door-step; fishermen       Cast their long nets, and drew, and cast again.       Deep in the ilex woods we wandered free,    When suddenly the forest glades were stirred       With waving pinions, and a great sea bird    Flew forth, like Shelley’s spirit, to the sea!                                                                       1880.
