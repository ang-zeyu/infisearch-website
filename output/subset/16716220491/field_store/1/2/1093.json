Art was the only thing worth living and dying for; the world was full of women, and they were all alike, old, young, ugly, handsome--all a pack of heartless jades; but art was one, beautiful, true, deathless and unchanging.  He looked up from the furnace door, and he felt the blood rush to his face. Marietta was standing near and watching him with her strangely veiled eyes.  \"Poor Zorzi!\" she exclaimed in a soft voice. \"How hot you look!\"  He did not remember that he had ever cared a straw whether any one noticed that he was hot or not, until that moment; but for some complicated reason connected with his own thoughts the remark stung him like an insult, and fully confirmed his recent verdict concerning women in general and their total lack of all human kindness where men were concerned. He rose to his feet suddenly and turned away without a word.  \"Come out into the garden,\" said Marietta. \"Do you need Zorzi just now?\" she asked, turning to her father, who only shook his head by way of answer, for he was very busy.  \"But I assure you that I am not too hot,\" answered Zorzi. \"Why should I go out?\"  \"Because I want you to fasten up one of the branches of the red rose. It catches in my skirt every time I pass. You will need a hammer and a little nail.\"  She had not been thinking of his comfort after all, thought Zorzi as he got the hammer. She had only wanted something done for herself. He might have known it. But for the rose that caught in her skirt, he might have roasted alive at the furnace before she would have noticed that he was hot. He followed her out. She led him to the end of the walk farthest from the door of the laboratory; the sun was low and all the little garden was in deep shade. A branch of the rose-bush lay across the path, and Zorzi thought it looked very much as if it had been pulled down on purpose. She pointed to it, and as he carefully lifted it from the ground she spoke quickly, in a low tone.  \"What was my father saying to you a while ago?\" she asked.  Zorzi held up the branch in his hand, ready to fasten it against the wall, and looked at her. He saw at a glance that she had brought him out to ask the question.  \"The master was giving me certain orders,\" he said.  \"He rarely makes such long speeches when he gives orders,\" observed the girl.  \"His instructions were very particular.\"  \"Will you not tell me what they were?\"  Zorzi turned slowly from her and let the long branch rest on the bush while he began to drive a nail into the wall. Marietta watched him.  \"Why do you not answer me?\" she asked.  \"Because I cannot,\" he said briefly.  \"Because you will not, you mean.\"  \"As you choose.\" Zorzi went on striking the nail.  \"I am sorry,\" answered the young girl. \"I really wish to know very much. Besides, if you will tell me, I will give you something.\"  Zorzi turned upon her suddenly with angry eyes.  \"If money could buy your father's secrets from me, I should be a rich man by this time.\"  \"I think I know as much of my father's secrets as you do,\" answered Marietta more coldly, \"and I did not mean to offer you money.\"  \"What then?\" But as he asked the question Zorzi turned away again and began to fasten the branch.  Marietta did not answer at once, but she idly picked a rose from the bush and put it to her lips to breathe in its freshness.  \"Why should you think that I meant to insult you?\" she asked gently.  \"I am only a servant, after all,\" answered Zorzi, with unnecessary bitterness. \"Why should you not insult your servants, if you please? It would be quite natural.\"  \"Would it? Even if you were really a servant?\"  \"It seems quite natural to you that I should betray your father's confidence. I do not see much difference between taking it for granted that a man is a traitor and offering him money to act as one.\"  \"No,\" said Marietta, smelling the rose from time to time as she spoke, \"there is not much difference. But I did not mean to hurt your feelings.\"  \"You did not realise that I could have any, I fancy,\" retorted Zorzi, still angry.  \"Perhaps I did not understand that you would consider what my father was telling you in the same light as a secret of the art,\" said Marietta slowly, \"nor that you would look upon what I meant to offer you as a bribe. The matter concerned me, did it not?\"  \"Your name was not spoken. I have fastened the branch. Is there anything else for me to do?\"  \"Have you no curiosity to know what I would have given you?\" asked Marietta.  \"I should be ashamed to want anything at such a price,\" returned Zorzi proudly.  \"You hold your honour high, even in trifles.\"  \"It is all I have--my honour and my art.\"  \"You care for nothing else? Nothing else in the whole world?\"  \"Nothing,\" said Zorzi.  \"You must be very lonely in your thoughts,\" she said, and turned away.  As she went slowly along the path her hand hung by her side, and the rose she held fell from her fingers. Following her at a short distance, on his way back to the laboratory, Zorzi stooped and picked up the flower, not thinking that she would turn her head. But at that moment she had reached the door, and she looked back and saw what he had done. She stood still and held out her hand, expecting him to come up with her.  \"My rose!\" she exclaimed, as if surprised. \"Give it back to me.\"  Zorzi gave it to her, and the colour came to his face a second time. She fastened it in her bodice, looking down at it as she did so.  \"I am so fond of roses,\" she said, smiling a little. \"Are you?\"  \"I planted all those you have here,\" he answered.  \"Yes--I know.\"  She looked up as she spoke, and met his eyes, and all at once she laughed, not unkindly, nor as if at him, nor at what he had said, but quietly and happily, as women do when they have got what they want. Zorzi did not understand.  \"You are gay,\" he said coldly.  \"Do you wonder?\" she asked. \"If you knew what I know, you would understand.\"  \"But I do not.\"  Zorzi went back to his furnace, Marietta exchanged a few words with her father and left the room again to go home.  In the garden she paused a moment by the rose-bush, where she had talked with Zorzi, but there was not even the shadow of a smile in her face now. She went down the dark corridor and called the porter, who roused himself, opened the door and hailed the house opposite. A woman looked out in the evening light, nodded and disappeared. A few seconds later she came out of the house, a quiet little middle-aged creature in brown, with intelligent eyes, and she crossed the shaky wooden bridge over the canal to come and bring Marietta home. It would have been a scandalous thing if the daughter of Angelo Beroviero had been seen by the neighbours to walk a score of paces in the street without an attendant. She had thrown a hood of dark green cloth over her head, and the folds hung below her shoulders, half hiding her graceful figure. Her step was smooth and deliberate, while the little brown serving-woman trotted beside her across the wooden bridge.  The house of Angelo Beroviero hung over the paved way, above the edge of the water, the upper story being supported by six stone columns and massive wooden beams, forming a sort of portico which was at the same time a public thoroughfare; but as the house was not far from the end of the canal of San Piero which opens towards Venice, few people passed that way.  Marietta paused a moment while the woman held the door open for her. The sun had just set and the salt freshness that comes with the rising tide was already in the air.  \"I wish I were in Venice this evening,\" she said, almost to herself.  The serving-woman looked at her suspiciously.     CHAPTER II   The June night was dark and warm as Zorzi pushed off from the steps before his master's house and guided his skiff through the canal, scarcely moving the single oar, as the rising tide took his boat silently along. It was not until he had passed the last of the glass-houses on his right, and was already in the lagoon that separates Murano from Venice, that he began to row, gently at first, for fear of being heard by some one ashore, and then more quickly, swinging his oar in the curved crutch with that skilful, serpentine stroke which is neither rowing nor sculling, but which has all the advantages of both, for it is swift and silent, and needs scarcely to be slackened even in a channel so narrow that the boat itself can barely pass.  Now that he was away from the houses, the stars came out and he felt the pleasant land breeze in his face, meeting the rising tide. Not a boat was out upon the shallow lagoon but his own, not a sound came from the town behind him; but as the flat bow of the skiff gently slapped the water, it plashed and purled with every stroke of the oar, and a faint murmur of voices in song was borne to him on the wind from the still waking city.  He stood upright on the high stern of the shadowy craft, himself but a moving shadow in the starlight, thrown forward now, and now once more erect, in changing motion; and as he moved the same thought came back and back again in a sort of halting and painful rhythm. He was out that night on a bad errand, it said, helping to sell the life of the woman he loved, and what he was doing could never be undone. Again and again the words said themselves, the far-off voices said them, the lapping water took them up and repeated them, the breeze whispered them quickly as it passed, the oar pronounced them as it creaked softly in the crutch rowlock, the stars spelled out the sentences in the sky, the lights of Venice wrote them in the water in broken reflections. He was not alone any more, for everything in heaven and earth was crying to him to go back.  That was folly, and he knew it. The master who had trusted him would drive him out of his house, and out of Venetian land and water, too, if he chose, and he should never see Marietta again; and she would be"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16116"],["title","Studies of Trees (#1)"],["body","oil, but will grow in almost     any soil.  Enemies: Sucking insects forming white downy patches on the bark and     twigs, the _white pine weevil_, a boring insect, and the _white pine     blister rust_, a fungus, are among its principal enemies.  [Illustration: FIG. 3.--The White Pine.]  Value for planting: Aside from its value as an ornamental tree, the     white pine is an excellent tree to plant on abandoned farms and for     woodlands and windbreaks throughout the New England States, New     York, Pennsylvania, and the Lake States.  Commercial value: The wood is easily worked, light, durable, and will     not warp. It is used for naval construction, lumber, shingles,     laths, interior finish, wooden ware, etc.  Other characters: The _fruit_ is a cone, four to six inches long.  Comparisons: The tree is apt to be confused with the _Bhotan pine_     (_Pinus excelsa_), which is commonly grown as an ornamental tree.     The Bhotan pine, however, has needles much longer and more drooping     in appearance.   THE PITCH PINE (_Pinus rigida_)  Distinguishing characters: Here there are *three* needles to each     cluster, Fig. 4. They are dark, yellowish-green needles about four     inches long. The rough-looking _branches_ of the tree may be seen     _studded with cones_ throughout the year, and _clusters of leaves_     may be seen _sprouting directly from the trunk_ of the tree; see     Fig. 5. The last two are very characteristic and will distinguish     the tree at a glance.   Form and size: It is a low tree of uncertain habit and extremely rough     looking at every stage of its life. It is constantly full of dead     branches and old cones which persist on the tree throughout the     year.  Range: Eastern United States.  Soil and location: Grows in the poorest and sandiest soils where few     other trees will grow. In New Jersey and on Long Island where it is     native, it proves so hardy and persistent that it often forms pure     stands excluding other trees.  [Illustration: FIG. 4.--Twig of the Pitch Pine.]  Enemies: None of importance.  Value for planting: Well adapted for the sea coast and other exposed     places. It is of extremely uncertain habit and is subject to the     loss of the lower limbs. It frequently presents a certain     picturesqueness of outline, but it could not be used as a specimen     tree on the lawn.  [Illustration: FIG. 5.--The Pitch Pine.]  Commercial value: The wood is coarse grained and is used for rough     lumber, fuel, and charcoal.  Other characters: The _fruit_ is a cone one to three inches long, persistent on the tree for several years.   THE SCOTCH PINE (_Pinus sylvestris_)  Distinguishing characters: There are *two* needles to each cluster, and     these are _short_ compared with those of the white pine, and     _slightly twisted_; see Fig. 6. The _bark_, especially along the     upper portion of the trunk, _is reddish_ in color.  Form and size: A medium-sized tree with a short crown.  Range: Europe, Asia, and eastern United States.  Soil and location: Will do best on a deep, rich, sandy soil, but will     also grow on a dry, porous soil.  Enemies: In Europe the Scotch pine has several insect enemies, but in     America it appears to be free from injury.  Value for planting: Suitable for windbreaks and woodland planting. Many     excellent specimens may also be found in our parks.  Commercial value: In the United States, the wood is chiefly used for     fuel, though slightly used for barrels, boxes, and carpentry. In     Europe, the Scotch pine is an important timber tree.  Comparisons: The Scotch pine is apt to be confused with the _Austrian     pine_ (_Pinus austriaca_), because they both have two needles to     each cluster. The needles of the Austrian pine, however, are much     longer, coarser, straighter, and darker than those of the Scotch     pine; Fig. 1. The form of the Austrian pine, too, is more     symmetrical and compact.  [Illustration: FIG. 6.--Twig of the Scotch Pine.]      The _red pine_ (_Pinus resinosa_) is another tree that has two     needles to each cluster, but these are much longer than those of the     Scotch pine (five to six inches) and are straighter. The bark, which     is reddish in color, also differentiates the red pine from the     Austrian pine. The position of the cones on the red pine, which     point outward and downward at maturity, will also help to     distinguish this tree from the Scotch and the Austrian varieties.    GROUP II. THE SPRUCE AND HEMLOCK  How to tell them from other trees: The spruce and hemlock belong to the     evergreen class and may be told from the other trees by their     _leaves_. The characteristic leaves of the spruce are shown in Fig.     9; those of the hemlock in Fig. 10. These are much shorter than the     needles of the pines but are longer than the leaves of the red cedar     or arbor vitae. They are neither arranged in clusters like those of     the larch, nor in feathery layers like those of the cypress. They     adhere to the tree throughout the year, while the leaves of the     larch and cypress shed in the fall.      The spruces are pyramidal-shaped trees, with tall and tapering     trunks, thickly covered with branches, forming a compact crown. They     are widely distributed throughout the cold and temperate regions of     the northern hemisphere, where they often form thick forests over     extended areas.      There are eighteen recognized species of spruce. The Norway spruce     has been chosen as a type for this group because it is so commonly     planted in the northeastern part of the United States.      The hemlock is represented by seven species, confined to temperate     North America, Japan, and Central and Western China.  [Illustration: FIG. 7.--The Norway Spruce.]  How to tell them from each other: The needles and branches of the spruce     are _coarse_; those of the hemlock are _flat and graceful_. The     individual leaves of the spruce, Fig. 9, are four-sided and green or     blue on the under side, while those of the hemlock, Fig. 10, are     flat and are _marked by two white lines_ on the under side.   THE NORWAY SPRUCE (_Picea excelsa_)  Distinguishing characters: The characteristic appearance of the     full-grown tree is due to the *drooping branchlets* carried on *main     branches which bend upward* (Fig. 7).  Leaf: The leaves are dark green in color and are _arranged spirally_,     thus making the twigs coarser to the touch than the twigs of the     hemlock or fir. In cross-section, the individual leaflet is     quadrilateral, while that of the pine is triangular.  Form and size: A large tree with a straight, undivided trunk and a     well-shaped, conical crown (Fig. 7).  Range: Northern Europe, Asia, northern North America.  Soil and location: Grows in cool, moist situations.  Enemies: The foliage of the spruce is sometimes affected by _red     spider_, but is apt to be more seriously injured by drought, wind,     and late frosts.  Value for planting: Commonly planted as an ornamental tree and for     hedges. It does well for this purpose in a cool northern climate,     but in the vicinity of New York City and further south it does not     do as well, losing its lower branches at an early age, and becoming     generally scraggly in appearance.  [Illustration: FIG. 8.--A Group of Hemlock.]  Commercial value: The wood is light and soft and is used for     construction timber, paper pulp, and fuel.  Other characters: The _fruit_ is a large slender cone, four to seven     inches long.  Comparisons: The _white spruce_ (_Picea canadensis_) may be told from     the Norway spruce by the whitish color on the under side of its     leaves and the unpleasant, pungent odor emitted from the needles     when bruised. The cones of the white spruce, about two inches long,     are shorter than these of the Norway spruce, but are longer than     those of the black spruce.      It is essentially a northern tree growing in all sorts of locations     along the streams and on rocky mountain slopes as far north as the     Arctic Sea and Alaska. It often appears as an ornamental tree as far     south as New York and Pennsylvania.      The _black spruce_ (_Picea mariana_) may be told from the other     spruces by its small cone, which is usually only about one inch in     length. In New England it seldom grows to as large a size as the     other spruce trees.      It covers large areas in various parts of northern North America and     grows to its largest size in Manitoba. The black spruce has little     value as an ornamental tree.      The _Colorado blue spruce_ (_Picea parryana_ or _Picea pungens_)     which is commonly used as an ornamental tree on lawns and in parks,     can be told from the other spruces by its pale-blue or sage-green     color and its sharp-pointed, coarse-feeling twigs. Its small size     and sharp-pointed conical form are also characteristic.      It grows to a large size in Colorado and the Middle West. In the     Eastern States and in northern Europe where it is planted as an     ornamental tree, it is usually much smaller.  [Illustration: FIG. 9.--Twig of the Norway Spruce.]   HEMLOCK (_Tsuga canadensis_)  Distinguishing characters: Its leaves are arranged in *flat layers*,     giving a flat, horizontal and graceful appearance to the whole     branch (Fig. 8). The individual leaves are dark green above, lighter     colored below, and are *marked by two white lines on the under side*     (Fig. 10).      The leaves are arranged on little stalks, a characteristic that does     not appear in the other evergreen trees.  Form and size: A large tree with a broad-based pyramidal head, and a     trunk conspicuously tapering toward the apex. The branches extend     almost to the ground.  Range: The hemlock is a northern tree, growing in Canada and the United     States.  Soil and location: Grows on all sorts of soils, in the deepest woods as     well as on high mountain "]]]
