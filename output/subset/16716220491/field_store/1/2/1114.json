My mother told us that she was positive he was president of a college.  \"The _melolontha vulgaris_ is the most destructive of beetles, but the larvae are still more injurious.  They do incalculable damage to the farmer.  Fortunately enormous numbers of these grubs are eaten by the birds.\"  \"Unfortunately the birds are not so numerous as they used to be.  They are being destroyed so rapidly, more's the pity!  These grounds and woods yonder were formerly alive with birds of all kinds.  Flocks of the purple grakle used to follow the plow and eat up the worms at a great rate.  You are familiar with their habits?  You know they are most devoted parents.  I have often watched them feeding their young. The little ones have such astonishingly good appetites that it keeps the old folks busy to supply them with enough to eat.  They work like beavers as long as daylight lasts, going to and from the fields carrying on each return trip a fat grub or a toothsome grasshopper.\"  \"I am a great lover of birds,\" returned the professor enthusiastically, \"and I find them very interesting subjects of study.  By the way, I was reading the other day a little incident connected with one of America's great men which impressed me deeply.  The story goes that he was one day walking in company with some noted statesmen, busily engaged in conversation.  But he was not too much occupied to notice that a young bird had fallen from its nest near the path where they were walking. He stopped short and crossing over to where the bird was lying, tenderly picked it up and put it back into its nest.  There was a gentleman of a noble nature!  No wonder that man was a leader and a liberator!\"  \"Who was he?\"  \"The grand, the great Abraham Lincoln,\" responded the professor impressively.  \"Well, he'd be the very one to do just such a kind deed as that,\" was the colonel's hearty response.  \"No man ever lived who had a bigger, more merciful heart than 'Honest Abe.'\"  For myself I did not know who Abraham Lincoln was.  I had never heard the name before, but I was quite sure from the proud tone of the professor's voice that he was a distinguished man, as I was equally sure from the story of his pity for the helpless bird, that he was a good man.  \"You mentioned the industry of the grakle a moment ago,\" resumed the professor.  \"Do you know that the redwing is equally as useful, and besides he is a delightful singer?    \"The redwing flutes his o-ka-lee.  \"Do you remember that line, colonel?\" and the professor softly whistled a strain in imitation of a bird's note.  \"The services of our little brothers of the air are exceedingly valuable to the horticulturist. And think of the damage done to arboriculture by the woodborers alone were it not for the help given by the birds.  Did you ever notice those borers at work, colonel?  Some writer has well described them as animated gimlets.  They just stick their pointed heads into the bark and turn their bodies around and around and out pours a little stream of sawdust.  The birds would pick off such pests fast enough if people would only give them a chance and not scare them off with shotguns.\"  \"Yes, the birds earn their way, there is no denying it, and he is a very stupid farmer who begrudges them the little corn and wheat they take from the fields.  The account is more than balanced by the good they do.\"  Then the conversation ceased, for the colonel and his friend moved off to inspect the quince bushes.  Pleased by the praises they had bestowed on us for our efforts in cleaning the fruit trees and cornfields of injurious insects, I went to work with new vigor to get out some bugs for my luncheon, and was thus pleasantly employed when a sharp twitter from my mother attracted my attention.  \"Look, children!\" she exclaimed.  \"Here come our young ladies with some company from the city.  Be careful to notice what they have on their heads and then tell me what you think of our sweet, pretty ladies.\"  One of my brothers was swaying lightly on a little swing below me.  I flew down hastily and placed myself on the next bough, where I could also get a good view of the ladies as they strolled toward us.  They were in a very merry mood and each one seemed striving to say something more arousing than her companions.  Miss Dorothy led the way, her arm linked in that of one of the stranger guests.  Then followed the others with Miss Katie and Marian hand in hand in the rear.  They were all very handsomely dressed, and having just returned from a drive had not yet removed their hats.  As they came under the tree where we were perched, which was a favorite spot with Miss Katie, they halted for some time and consequently I had an excellent opportunity to look, as my mother had bidden me.  And what did I see?  I saw six ladies' hats trimmed with dead birds.  Fastened on sidewise, head downward, on one was a magnificent scarlet tanager, his body half concealed by folds of tulle, his fixed eye staring into vacancy.  On another was the head and breast of a beautiful yellow-hammer; it was surmounted by the tall sweeping plumes of the egret, which this bird produces only at breeding time.  Oh, how much joy and beauty the world had lost by that cruel deed!  A third hat had two song sparrows imprisoned in meshes of star-studded lace.  Their blithesome carol had been rudely silenced, their cheer to the world cut short, simply that they might be used for hat trimming.  Of the remaining ones some were as yet unknown to me, but my mother, who had an extensive acquaintance with foreign birds, said that in that strange murderous mixture of millinery, far-away Australia had furnished the filmy feathers of the lyre bird which swept upward from a knot of ribbons, and that the forests of Germany had contributed the pretty green linnet.  Dove's wings and the rosy breast of the grosbeak completed the barbarous display.  How my heart sickened as I gazed at these pleasant, refined, soft-voiced women flaunting the trophies of their cruelty in the beautiful sunlight.  Had they no compassion for the feathered mother who had been robbed of her young for the sake of a hat?  \"Oh, how can they do such dreadful, such wicked things!\" I moaned.  My mother heard my lament and signaled for us to come up where she was perching.  \"You see now who are our worst enemies,\" said she.  \"The cat preys on us to satisfy his bodily hunger, but women have no such excuse.  We are not slaughtered to sustain their lives but to minister to their vanity. For years the women of Christian lands have waged their unholy war against us.  We have been driven from our old haunts and forced to seek new places.  We have been shot down by thousands every season until now many species are destroyed from the face of the earth.  There is no security for us in any place.  The hunter with his gun penetrates into the deepest forests, he perils his life in scaling the most dangerous cliffs, he wades through bog and marsh and mud and tracks us to our feeding grounds to surprise us with the deadly shot, and kills the mother hovering over the nest of her helpless offspring with as little compunction as if she were a poisonous reptile instead of a melodious joy-giver.  And all this horrible slaughter is for women.\"  I grew feverish with excitement at this terrible arraignment of the \"gentler sex.\"  \"But why are they so cruel?  Why do they do this wicked thing?\" I asked.  \"For the sake of Fashion,\" said my mother.  \"Fashion, what is that?\"  My mother was very patient with me, so when I asked questions she did not put me off by telling me she didn't know, or advise me to fly away and play, or tell me she was busy and couldn't be bothered just then, therefore she now took pains to make me understand.  \"You ask me what is Fashion,\" she began.  \"Well, Fashion is an exacting ruler, a great, tyrannical god who has many, many worshipers, and these he rules with an iron hand.  His followers cannot be induced to do anything contrary to his wishes.  He sits on a high throne from which he dictates to his slaves what they must do.  Often they do the most outrageous things, not because they like to, but because he demands it. He is constantly laying down new laws for their guidance, and some of these laws are so unreasonable and absurd that a part of his followers frequently threaten to rebel.  They do not hold out against him long, for he manages to make it quite unpleasant for those who disobey him or refuse to come under his yoke.\"  \"Has he any men slaves?\" asked my brother.  \"Yes, he has some slaves among men, but the larger number of those who wear his most galling fetters are women.  If he but crooks his little finger these bond-women rush pell-mell in the direction he points. They are thus keen to do his bidding, because each woman who is the first to carry out his rules in her own particular town or neighborhood acquires great distinction in the eyes of the other worshipers.\"  \"His slaves are nearly always rich women, aren't they?\" asked my brother.  \"By no means.  Many of them are poor working women who have to labor hard for a living.  But they will rob themselves of necessities and needed rest to get the means to follow his demands.  Often it takes them a long time to do this, and perhaps just as they have accomplished the weary task he suddenly proclaims a new law, and all this toiling and drudging and stinting must begin over again.  In this way the unhappy creatures have never a breathing spell.  It is utterly impossible for them to conform to the new law when it is first proclaimed by the god, and so they are always struggling to keep up. Their chains are never lifted or lightened a particle.\"  \"If the chain is so heavy why don't they break it?\" I asked impatiently.  \"Because they are afraid,\" she replied.  \"Afraid of the god?\"  \"No, no, child, they are afraid of each other.  They are afraid the richer slaves, who are able to comply with the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16259"],["title","The Surprising Adventures of the Magical Monarch of Mo and His People (#1)"],["body","as happy as ever.  But the Queen was not contented.  \"My love,\" she said to him, \"I can not kiss you any more, and that will break my heart.\"  Thereupon the King sent word throughout the Valley that any one who could procure for him a new head should wed one of the princesses.  The princesses were all exceedingly pretty girls, and so it was not long before one man made a very nice head out of candy and brought it to the King. It did not look exactly like the old head, but the efface was very sweet, nevertheless; so the King put it on and the Queen kissed it at once with much satisfaction.  The young man had put a pair of glass eyes in the head, with which the King could see very well after he got used to them.  According to the royal promise, the young man was now called into the palace and asked to take his pick of the princesses. There were all so sweet and lady-like that he had some trouble in making a choice; but at last he took the biggest, thinking that he would thus secure the greatest reward, and they were married amid great rejoicing.  But, a few days afterward, the King was caught out in a rainstorm, and before he could get home his new head had melted in the great shower of lemonade that fell. Only the glass eyes were left, and these he put in his pocket and went sorrowfully to tell the Queen of his new misfortune.  Then another young man who wanted to marry a princess made the King a head out of dough, sticking in it the glass eyes; and the King tried it on and found that it fitted very well. So the young man was given the next biggest princess.  But the following day the sun chance to shine extremely hot, and when the King walked out it baked his dough head into bread, at which the monarch felt very light-headed. And when the birds saw the bread they flew down from the trees, perched upon the King's shoulder and quickly ate up his new head. All but the glass eyes.  Again the good King was forced to go home to the Queen without a head, and the lady firmly declared that this time her husband must have a head warranted to last at least as long as the honeymoon of the young man who made it; which was not at all unreasonable under the circumstances.  So a request was sent to all loyal subjects throughout the Valley asking them to find a head for their King that was neat and substantial.  In the meantime the King had a rather hard time of it. When he wished to go any place he was obliged to hold out in front of him, between his thumbs and fingers, the glass eyes, that they might guide his footsteps. This, as you may imagine, made his Majesty look rather undignified, and dignity is very important to every royal personage.  At last a wood-chopper in the mountains made a head out of wood and sent it to the King. It was neatly carved, besides being solid and durable; moreover, it fitted the monarch's neck to the T. So the King rummaged in his pocket and found the glass eyes, and when these were put in the new head the King announced his satisfaction.  There was only one drawback--he couldn't smile, as the wooden face was too stiff; and it was funny to hear his Majesty laughing heartily while his face maintained a solemn expression. But the glass eyes twinkled merrily and every one knew that he was the same kind-hearted monarch of old, although he had become, of necessity, rather hard-headed.  Then the King sent word to the wood-chopper to come to the palace and take his pick of the princesses, and preparations were at once begun for the wedding.  But the wood-chopper, on his way to the court, unfortunately passed by the dwelling of the Purple Dragon and stopped to speak to the monster.  Now it seems that when the Dragon had swallowed the King's head, the unusual meal made the beast ill. It was more accustomed to berries and caramels for dinner than to heads, and the sharp points of the King's crown (which was firmly fastened to the head) pricked the Dragon's stomach and made the creature miserable. After a few days of suffering the Dragon disgorged the head, and, not knowing what else to do with it, locked it up in a cupboard and put the key in its pocket.  When the Dragon met the wood-chopper and learned he had made a new head for the King, and as a reward was to wed one of the princesses, the monster became very angry. It resolved to do a wicked thing; which will not surprise you when you remember the beast's purple color.  \"Step into my parlor and rest yourself,\" said the Dragon, politely. Wicked people are most polite when they mean mischief.  \"Thank you, I'll stop for a few minutes,\" replied the wood-chopper; \"but I can not stay long, as I am expected at court.\"  When he had entered the parlor the Dragon suddenly opened its mouth and snapped off the poor wood-chopper's head. Being warned by experience, however, it did not swallow the head, but placed it in the cupboard. Then the Dragon took from a shelf the King's head and glued it on the wood-chopper's neck.  \"Now,\" said the beast, with a cruel laugh, \"you are the King! Go home and claim your wife and your kingdom.\"  The poor wood-chopper was much amazed; for at first he did not really know which he was, the King or the wood-chopper.  He looked in the mirror and, seeing the King, made a low bow. Then the King's head thought: \"Who am I bowing to? There is no one greater than the King!\" And so at once there began a conflict between the wood-chopper's heart and the King's head.  The Dragon was mightily pleased at the result of its wicked stratagem, and having pushed the bewildered wood-chopper out of the castle, immediately sent him on his way to the court.  When the poor man neared the town the people ran out and said: \"Why, this is the King come back again. All hail, your Majesty!\"  \"All nonsense!\" returned the wood-chopper. \"I am only a poor man with the King's head on my shoulders. You can easily see it isn't mine, for it's crooked; the Dragon didn't glue it on straight.\"  \"Where, then, is your own head?\" they asked.  \"Locked up in the Dragon's cupboard,\" replied the poor fellow, beginning to weep.  \"Here,\" cried the King's head; \"stop this. You mustn't cry out of my eyes! The King never weeps.\"  \"I beg pardon, your Majesty,\" said the wood-chopper, meekly, \"I'll not do it again.\"  \"Well, see that you don't,\" returned the head more cheerfully.  The people were greatly amazed at this, and took the wood-chopper to the palace, where all was soon explained.  When the Queen saw the King's head she immediately kissed it; but the King rebuked her, saying she must kiss only him.  \"But it is your head,\" said the poor Queen.  \"Probably it is,\" replied the King; \"but it is on another man. You must confine yourself to kissing my wooden head.\"  \"I'm sorry,\" sighed the Queen, \"for I like to kiss the real head best.\"  \"And so you shall,\" said the King's head; \"I don't approve your kissing that wooden head at all.\"  The poor lady looked from one to the other in perplexity. Finally a happy thought occurred to her.  \"Why don't you trade heads?\" she asked.  \"Just the thing!\" cried the King; and, the wood-chopper consenting, the exchange was made, and the Monarch of Mo found himself in possession of his own head again, whereat he was so greatly pleased that he laughed long and merrily.  The wood-chopper, however, did not even smile. He couldn't because of the wooden face. The head he had made for the King he now was compelled to wear himself.  \"Bring hither the princesses,\" commanded the King. \"This good man shall choose his bride at once, for he has restored to me my own head.\"  But when the princesses arrived and saw that the wood-chopper had a wooden head, they each and all refused to marry him, and begged so hard to escape that the King was in a quandary.  \"I promised him one of my daughters,\" he argued, \"and a King never breaks his word.\"  \"But he hadn't a wooden head then,\" explained one of the girls.  The King realized the truth of this. Indeed, when he came to look carefully at the wooden head, he did not blame his daughters for not wishing to marry it. Should he force one of them to consent, it was not unlikely she would call her husband a blockhead--a term almost certain to cause trouble in any family.  After giving the matter deep thought, the King resolved to go to the Purple Dragon and oblige it to give up the wood-chopper's head.  So all the fighting men in the kingdom were got together, and, having picked ripe swords off the sword-trees, they marched in a great body to the Dragon's castle.  Now the Purple Dragon realized that if it attempted to fight all this army, it would perhaps be cut to pieces; so it retired within its castle and refused to come out.  The wood-chopper was a brave man.  \"I'll go in and fight the Dragon alone,\" he said; and in he went. By this time the Dragon was both frightened and angry, and the moment it saw the man it rushed forward and made a snap at his head.  The wooden head came off at once, and the Dragon's long, sharp teeth got stuck in the wood and would not come out again; so the monster was unable to do anything but flop its tail and groan.  The wood-chopper now ran to the cupboard, took out his head and placed it upon his shoulders where it belonged. Then he proudly walked out of the castle and was greeted with loud shouts by the army, which carried him back in triumph to the King's palace.  And, now that he wore his own head again, one of the prettiest of the young princesses willingly agreed to marry him; so the wedding ceremony was performed amidst great rejoicing.    _The Third Surprise_  THE TRAMP DOG AND THE MONARCH'S LOST TEMPER   One day the Monarch of Mo, having nothing better to do, resolved to go hunting blackberries among the bushes that grew at the foot of the mountains.  So he put on an old crown that would not get tarnished if it rained, and, having found a tin pail in the pantry, started off without telling any one where he was going.  For some distance the path was a nice, smooth taffy, that was very"]]]
