Sez Sonny: \"Lay 'em open! Give 'em      blotches on the rind!\"  Then bricks was flyin' in the wind. Mine      dinted Otto's chin; Ole Nosey got his brother, which he never      more will roam. When Ulrich stopped a Port bookay he rolled      his alley in. Their fire was somethin' fierce. Poor Son      was blowin' blood 'n' foam, \"Fill up,\" he coughs, \"'n' plug 'em! S'elp      me Gord, we're goin' 'ome!\"  With bricks we drove right at 'em 'n' we      wanged 'em best we could. 'Twas either bed 'n' breakfast or a scribble      and a wreath. Haynes bust a Prussian's almond, took the      bay'net where he stood, Then heaved his last 'arf-Brunswick, split      the demon's grinnin' teeth, And Son went down in glory, with a German      underneath!  We'd started out with gibbers in our clobber      and our 'ats. They gave us floatin' lead enough to stop an      army cor. We yelled like fiends, 'n' countered with a      lovely flight of bats, Then rushed in close formation, heavin' cot-      tages, n' tore Through blinded, bleedin' Bosches, 'n' lor      love yeh, it was war!  We came peltin', headfirst, 'elpless, in a drain      among a lot Of dirty, damned old Tommies (Gord! The      best that ever blew!) Eight left of us, all punctured, each man      holdin' what he'd got. Me wild, a rat hole in me lung, but in me      mauley, too, A bull-nosed brick with whiskers where no      whiskers ever grew.  There's nothin' doin' now. I wear me blan-      kets like a toff. The way this fat nurse pets me, strewth, it's      well to be so sick, A-dreamin' of our contract 'n' the way we      pulled it off. I reckon Haig is phonin' Hughes: \"Hullo,      there, Billy. Quick-- A dozen of the pushes and a thousan' tons      of brick!\"    MUD.  THIS war's a waste of slurry, and its at-      mosphere is mud,    All is bog from here to sunset. Wadin'      through We're the victims of a thicker sort of universal      flood,    With discomforts that old Noah never knew.  We have dubbed our trench The Cecil.      There's a brass-plate and a dome,    And a quagmire where the doormat used      to be, If you're calling, second Tuesday is our reg'-      lar day at home,    So delighted if you'll toddle in to tea!  There is mud along the corridors enough to      bog a cow;    In the air there hangs a musty kind of      woof; There's a frog-pond in the parlour, and the      kitchen is a slough.    She has neither doors nor windows, nor a      roof.  When they post our bald somnambulist as      missing from his flat   We take soundings for the digger with a      prop. By the day the board is gratis, by the week      it's half of that;   For the season there's a corresponding drop.  Opening off the spacious hallway is my natty      little suite,    A commodious and accessible abode. By judicious disposition, with exclusion of      my feet,    There is sleeping room for Oliver the toad.  Though the ventilation's gusty, and in gobs      the ceiling falls--    Which with oral respiration disagrees-- Though there comes a certain quantity of      seepage from the walls,    There are some I knew in diggings worse      than these.  On my right is Cobber Carkeek. There's a      spring above his head,    And his mattress is a special kind of clay. He's a most punctilious bloke about the      fashion of his bed,    And he makes it with a shovel every day.  Man is dust. If so, the Cobber has been      puddled up a treat.    On domestic sanitation he's a toff, For he lights a fire on Sunday, bakes his sur-      face in the heat,    Then he takes a little maul, and cracks it      off.  After hanging out a winter in this Cimmerian      hole    We're forgetting sheets, and baths, and      tidy skins. In the dark and deadly calm last night they      took us on patrol.    Seven, little fellows, thinking of their sins.  It was ours like blinded snails to prowl the      soggy, slimy night,    With a feeler pricking out at every pore For the death that stalks in darkness, or the      blinking stab of light,    And the other trifling matters that are war.  That's the stuff to get your liver, that's the      acid on a man,    For it tries his hones, and seeks his marrow      throngh. You have got the thought to comfort you that      life is but a span,    If Fritz squirts his loathly limelight over      you.  We got back again at daybreak. Cobber      ducked to doss and said,    From the soft, embracing mud: \"No more      I'll roam. \"Oh, thank Heaven, blokes,\" he murmured,      \"for the comforts of a bed!    Gorstruth, but ain't it good to have a      home!\"    MICKIE MOLLYNOO.  A MILE-LONG panto dragon ploddin'      'opeless all the day, Stuffed out with kits, 'n' spiked with rifles,      steamin' in its sweat, A-heavin' down the misty road, club-footed      through the clay, By waggons bogged 'n' buckin' guns,      the wildest welter yet, Like 'arf creation's tenants shiftin' early      in the wet.  We're marchin' out, we dunno where, to meet      we dunno who; But here we lights eventual, 'n' sighs 'n'      slips the kit, 'N', 'struth, the first to take us on is Mickie      Mollynoo! A copper of the Port he was, when 'istory      was writ. Sez I : \"We're sent to face the foe, 'n', selp      me, this is It.\"  A shine John. Hop is Mollynoo. A mix-up      with the push Is all his joy. One evenin' when his      baton's flyin' free I takes a baby brick, 'n' drives it hard agin      the cush, 'N' Privit Mick is scattered out fer all the      world to see, But not afore indelible he's put his mark on      me.  I got the signs Masonic all inlaid along me      lug Where Molly, P.C., swiped me in them      'appy, careless days. He's sargin' now, a vet'ran; I'm a newchum      and a mug, 'N' when he sorter fixes me there's some-      thin' in his gaze That's pensive like. \"Move on!\" sez he.      \"Keep movin' there!\" he says.  If after this I dreams of scraps promiscuous      and crool, The mills in Butcher's Alley when the      watch is on the wine, Those nights he raided Wylie's shed to break      the two-up school, I takes a screw at Molly. With a grin that      ain't divine He's toyin' with a scar of old I reckernise      as mine.  'N' so I'm layin' for it, 'n' I'm wonderin' how      'n' what. We're signed on with the Germans, 'n' there      ain't a vacant date; But sure it's comin' to me, 'n' it's comin' 'ard      'n' 'ot. Me lurk is patient waitin', but I'm trim-      min' while I wait A brick to jab or swing with, in a willin'      tatertate.  Oh, judge me wonder! There's a scrim that      follers on a raid. I'm roughin' it all-in with Hans. He sock      me such a bat I slides on somethin' narsty, 'n' me little grave      is made; But Molly butts my Hun, 'n' leaves no face      beneath his hat, 'N', \"'Scuse me, Mister Herr,\" sez he, \"I have a lien on that!\"  He helps me under cover, 'n' he 'ands me      somethin' wet (I've got a lick or two that leaves me feelin'      pretty sick). \"Lor love yeh, ole John Hop,\" sez I, \"yiv      buried me in debt.\" \"Don't minton ut at all,\" he sez, 'n' eyes      me arf-a-tick. 'N' back there in the trench I sits, 'n' trims      another brick.  'Tis all this how a month or more; then      Mollynoo sez he: \"Come aisy, Jumm, yeh loafer, little hell 'n'      all to view. A job most illegant is on, cut out fer you 'n'      me. The damnedest, dirtiest fighter on the      Continent is you, Bar one, yeh gougin' thafe, 'n' that is      Sargin' Mollynoo!\"  I take, with knife 'n' pistol, arf a brick to line      me shirt. We creeps a thousan' yards or so to jigger      up a gun Which seven Huns is workin' on the Irish like      a squirt. We gets across them, me 'n' him. I pots      the extra one; Mick chokes his third in comfort, 'n',      be'old, the thing is done!  He stands above me, rakin' sweat from off his      gleamin' nut. \"Me dipper's leakin', Mick,\" sez I; \"me      leg is bit in two.\" Sez he: \"Bleed there in comfort, I'm for      bringin' help, ye scut.\" He's back in twenty minutes, with a dillied      German crew. \"Three'll carry in the gun,\" sez he, \"the      rest will carry you.\"  I dunno how he got 'em, but he made them      barrer me. They lugged the gun before him, 'n' he      yarded them like geese. Then Mickie s'lutes the Major. \"They're in      custody,\" sez he, \"Fer conduc' calculated to provoke a breach      iv peace, A-tearin' iv me uniform, 'n' 'saultin' the      po-lice.\"  Then down he dumped. His wounds would      make a 'arf a column list. When hack to front I chucks me bricks 'n'      smiles the best I can. He grins at me: \"Yer right,\" sez he, \"Hold      out yer bla'-guard fist, I couldn't fight yeh, blarst yeh, if yeh dinted      in me pan. This messin' round wid Germans makes a      chicken iv a man.\"    JAM. (A Hymn of Hate).

Dane longed to be able to turn his head, just enough to see which one of the local lordlings they blocked.  \"Houu--\" there was a questioning note in the cry now and the heavy thud-thud of feet was slacking. The clan party had seen them, were hesitant about the wisdom of trying to shove them aside.  Van Rycke marched steadily onward and Dane matched his pace. They might not possess a leather-lunged herald to clear their road, but they gave every indication of having the right to occupy as much of it as they wished. And that unruffled poise had its affect upon those behind. The pound of feet slowed to a walk, a walk which would keep a careful distance behind the two Terrans. It had worked--the Salariki--or these Salariki--were accepting them at their own valuation--a good omen for the day's business. Dane's spirits rose, but he schooled his features into a mask as wooden as his superior's. After all this was a very minor victory and they had ten or twelve hours of polite, and hidden, maneuvering before them.  The Solar Queen had set down as closely as possible to the trading center marked on Traxt Cam's private map and the Terrans now had another five minutes march, in the middle of the road, ahead of the chieftain who must be inwardly boiling at their presence, before they came out in the clearing containing the roofless, circular erection which served the Salariki of the district as a market place and a common meeting ground for truce talks and the mending of private clan alliances. Erect on a pole in the middle, towering well above the nodding fronds of the grass trees, was the pole bearing the trade shield which promised not only peace to those under it, but a three day sanctuary to any feuder or duelist who managed to win to it and lay hands upon its weathered standard.  They were not the first to arrive, which was also a good thing. Gathered in small groups about the walls of the council place were the personal attendants, liege warriors, and younger relatives of at least four or five clan chieftains. But, Dane noted at once, there was not a single curtained litter or riding orgel to be seen. None of the feminine part of the Salariki species had arrived. Nor would they until the final trade treaty was concluded and established by their fathers, husbands, or sons.  With the assurance of one who was master in his own clan, Van Rycke, displaying no interest at all in the shifting mass of lower rank Salariki, marched straight on to the door of the enclosure. Two or three of the younger warriors got to their feet, their brilliant cloaks flicking out like spreading wings. But when Van Rycke did not even lift an eyelid in their direction, they made no move to block his path.  As fighting men, Dane thought, trying to study the specimens before him with a totally impersonal stare, the Salariki were an impressive lot. Their average height was close to six feet, their distant feline ancestry apparent only in small vestiges. A Salarik's nails on both hands and feet were retractile, his skin was gray, his thick hair, close to the texture of plushy fur, extended down his backbone and along the outside of his well muscled arms and legs, and was tawny-yellow, blue-gray or white. To Terran eyes the broad faces, now all turned in their direction, lacked readable expression. The eyes were large and set slightly aslant in the skull, being startlingly orange-red or a brilliant turquoise green-blue. They wore loin cloths of brightly dyed fabrics with wide sashes forming corselets about their slender middles, from which gleamed the gem-set hilts of their claw knives, the possession of which proved their adulthood. Cloaks as flamboyant as their other garments hung in bat wing folds from their shoulders and each and every one moved in an invisible cloud of perfume.  Brilliant as the assemblage of liege men without had been, the gathering of clan leaders and their upper officers within the council place was a riot of color--and odor. The chieftains were installed on the wooden stools, each with a small table before him on which rested a goblet bearing his own clan sign, a folded strip of patterned cloth--his \"trade shield\"--and a gemmed box containing the scented paste he would use for refreshment during the ordeal of conference.  A breeze fluttered sash ends and tugged at cloaks, otherwise the assembly was motionless and awesomely quiet. Still making no overtures Van Rycke crossed to a stool and table which stood a little apart and seated himself. Dane went into the action required of him. Before his superior he set out a plastic pocket flask, its color as alive in the sunlight as the crudely cut gems which the Salariki sported, a fine silk handkerchief, and, last of all, a bottle of Terran smelling salts provided by Medic Tau as a necessary restorative after some hours combination of Salariki oratory and Salariki perfumes. Having thus done the duty of liege man, Dane was at liberty to seat himself, cross-legged on the ground behind his chief, as the other sons, heirs, and advisors had gathered behind their lords.  The chieftain whose arrival they had in a manner delayed came in after them and Dane saw that it was Fashdor--another piece of luck--since that clan was a small one and the chieftain had little influence. Had they so slowed Halfer or Paft it might be a different matter altogether.  Fashdor was established at his seat, his belongings spread out, and Dane, counting unobtrusively, was certain that the council was now complete. Seven clans Traxt Cam had recorded divided the sea coast territory and there were seven chieftains here--indicative of the importance of this meeting since some of these clans beyond the radius of the shield peace, must be fighting a vicious blood feud at that very moment. Yes, seven were here. Yet there still remained a single stool, directly across the circle from Van Rycke. An empty stool--who was the late comer?  That question was answered almost as it flashed into Dane's mind. But no Salariki lordling came through the door. Dane's self-control kept him in his place, even after he caught the meaning of the insignia emblazoned across the newcomer's tunic. Trader--and not only a Trader but a Company man! But why--and how? The Companies only went after big game--this was a planet thrown open to Free Traders, the independents of the star lanes. By law and right no Company man had any place here. Unless--behind a face Dane strove to keep as impassive as Van's his thoughts raced. Traxt Cam as a Free Trader had bid for the right to exploit Sargol when its sole exportable product was deemed to be perfume--a small, unimportant trade as far as the Companies were concerned. And then the Koros stones had been found and the importance of Sargol must have boomed as far as the big boys could see. They probably knew of Traxt Cam's death as soon as the Patrol report on Limbo had been sent to Headquarters. The Companies all maintained their private information and espionage services. And, with Traxt Cam dead without an heir, they had seen their chance and moved in. Only, Dane's teeth set firmly, they didn't have the ghost of a chance now. Legally there was only one Trader on Sargol and that was the Solar Queen, Captain Jellico had his records signed by the Patrol to prove that. And all this Inter-Solar man would do now was to bow out and try poaching elsewhere.  But the I-S man appeared to be in no haste to follow that only possible course. He was seating himself with arrogant dignity on that unoccupied stool, and a younger man in I-S uniform was putting before him the same type of equipment Dane had produced for Van Rycke. The Cargo-master of the Solar Queen showed no surprise, if the Eysies' appearance had been such to him.  One of the younger warriors in Paft's train got to his feet and brought his hands together with a clap which echoed across the silent gathering with the force of an archaic solid projectal shot. A Salarik, wearing the rich dress of the upper ranks, but also the collar forced upon a captive taken in combat, came into the enclosure carrying a jug in both hands. Preceded by Paft's son he made the rounds of the assembly pouring a purple liquid from his jug into the goblet before each chieftain, a goblet which Paft's heirs tasted ceremoniously before it was presented to the visiting clan leader. When they paused before Van Rycke the Salarik nobleman touched the side of the plasta flask in token. It was recognized that off world men must be cautious over the sampling of local products and that when they joined in the Taking of the First Cup of Peace, they did so symbolically.  Paft raised his cup, his gesture copied by everyone around the circle. In the harsh tongue of his race he repeated a formula so archaic that few of the Salariki could now translate the sing-song words. They drank and the meeting was formally opened.  But it was an elderly Salarik seated to the right of Halfer, a man who wore no claw knife and whose dusky yellow cloak and sash made a subdued note amid the splendor of his fellows, who spoke first, using the click-clack of the Trade Lingo his nation had learned from Cam.  \"Under the white,\" he pointed to the shield aloft, \"we assemble to hear many things. But now come two tongues to speak where once there was but one father of a clan. Tell us, outlanders, which of you must we now hark to in truth?\" He looked from Van Rycke to the I-S representative.  The Cargo-master from the Queen did not reply. He stared across the circle at the Company man. Dane waited eagerly. What _was_ the I-S going to say to that?  But the fellow did have an answer, ready and waiting. \"It is true, fathers of clans, that here are two voices, where by right and custom"]]]
