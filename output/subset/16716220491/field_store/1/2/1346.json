Every new boy had to do it, sooner or later. Fortunately on the second occasion I came off victor, much to my surprise.  How I managed to beat my opponent I never could understand. Anyhow the victory gave me a better standing in the school, though it did not lessen in the least my hatred of the battles that raged periodically with other schools.  I never had to fight again except as an unwilling participant in our foreign warfare.     CHAPTER III. THE MIDLAND RAILWAY AND \"KING HUDSON\"   In the year 1851 the Midland Railway was 521 miles long; it is now 2,063. Then its capital was 15,800,000, against 130,000,000 pounds to-day.  Then the gross revenue was 1,186,000 and now it has reached 15,960,000 pounds. When I say _now_, I refer to 1913, the year prior to the war, as since then, owing to Government control, non-division of through traffic and curtailment of accounts, the actual receipts earned by individual companies are not published, and, indeed, are not known.  Eighteen hundred and fifty-one was a period of anxiety to the Midland and to railway companies generally.  Financial depression had succeeded a time of wild excitement, and the Midland dividend had fallen from seven to two per cent.!  It was the year of the great Exhibition, which Lord Cholmondeley considered _the_ event of modern times and many over-sanguine people expected it to inaugurate a universal peace.  On the other hand Carlyle uttered fierce denunciations against it.  It certainly excited far more interest than has any exhibition since.  Then, nothing of the kind had ever before been seen.  Railway expectations ran high; immense traffic receipts, sorely needed, ought to have swelled the coffers of the companies.  But no! vast numbers of people certainly travelled to London, but a mad competition, as foolish almost as the preceding _mania_, set in, and passenger fares were again and again reduced, till expected profits disappeared and loss and disappointment were the only result.  The policy of Parliament in encouraging the construction of rival railway routes and in fostering competition in the supposed interest of the public was, even in those early days, bearing fruit--dead sea fruit, as many a luckless holder of railway stock learned to his cost.  Railway shareholders throughout the kingdom were growing angry.  In the case of the Midland--they appointed a committee of inquiry, and the directors assented to the appointment.  This committee was to examine and report upon the general and financial conditions of the company, and was invested with large powers.  About the same time also interviews took place between the Midland and the London and North-Western, with the object of arranging an amalgamation of the two systems.  Some progress was made, but no formal _engagement_ resulted, and so a very desirable union, between an aristocratic bridegroom and a democratic bride, remained unaccomplished.  Mr. Ellis was chairman of the Midland at this time and Mr. George Carr Glyn, afterwards the first Lord Wolverton, occupied a similar position on the Board of the London and North-Western.  Mr. Ellis had succeeded Mr. Hudson--the \"_Railway King_,\" so christened by Sydney Smith.  Mr. Hudson in 1844 was chairman of the first shareholders' meeting of the Midland Railway.  Prior to that date the Midland consisted of three separate railways.  In 1849 Mr. Hudson presided for the last time at a Midland meeting, and in the following year resigned his office of chairman of the company.  The story of the meteoric reign of the \"_Railway King_\" excited much interest when I was young, and it may not be out of place to touch upon some of the incidents of his career.  George Hudson was born in 1800, served his apprenticeship in the cathedral city of York and subsequently became a linendraper there and a man of property.  Many years afterwards he is reported to have said that the happiest days of his life passed while he stood behind his counter using the yardstick, a statement which should perhaps only be accepted under reservation.  He was undoubtedly a man of a bold and adventurous spirit, possessed of an ambition which soared far above the measuring of calicoes or the retailing of ribbons; but perhaps the observation was tinged by the environment of later and less happy days when his star had set, his kingly reign come to an end, and when possibly vain regrets had embittered his existence.  It was, I should imagine, midst the fierceness of the strife and fury of the _mania_ times, when his powerful personality counted for so much, that he reached the zenith of his happiness.  [George Hudson: hudson.jpg]  Whilst conducting in York his linendraper business, a relation died and left him money.  The railway boom had then begun.  He flung his yardstick behind him and entered the railway fray.  The Liverpool and Manchester line and its wonderful success--it paid ten per cent.--greatly impressed the public mind, and the good people of York determined they would have a railway to London.  A committee was appointed to carry out the project.  On this committee Mr. Hudson was placed, and it was mainly owing to his energy and skill that the scheme came to a successful issue.  He was rewarded by being made chairman of the company.  This was his entrance into the railway world where, for a time, he was monarch.  He must have been a man of shrewdness and capacity.  It is recorded that he acquired the land for the York to London railway at an average cost of 1,750 pounds per mile whilst that of the North Midland cost over 5,000 pounds.  On the 1st July, 1840, this linendraper of York had the proud pleasure of seeing the first train from York to London start on its journey.  From this achievement he advanced to others.  He and his friends obtained the lease, for thirty-one years, of a rival line, which turned out a great financial success.  His enterprise and energy were boundless.  It is said that his bold spirit, his capacity for work and his great influence daunted his most determined opponents.  For instance, the North Midland railway, part predecessor of _the_ Midland, was involved in difficulty.  He appeared before the shareholders, offered, if his advice and methods were adopted, to guarantee double the then dividend.  His offer was accepted and he was made chairman, and from that position became chairman, and for a time dictator, of the amalgamated Midland system.  Clearly his business abilities were great; his reforms were bold and drastic, and success attended his efforts.  He soon became the greatest railway authority in England.  For a time the entire railway system in the north was under his control, and the confidence reposed in him was unbounded.  He was the lion of the day: princes, peers and prelates, capitalists and fine ladies sought his society, paid homage to his power, besought his advice and lavished upon him unstinted adulation.  In 1845 the railway mania was at its height.  It is said that during two or three months of that year as much as 100,000 pounds per week were expended in advertisements in connection with railway promotions, railway meetings and railway matters generally.  Scarcely credible this, but so it is seriously stated.  Huge sums were wasted in the promotion and construction of British railways in early days, from which, in their excessive capital cost, they suffer now.  In the _mania_ period railways sprang into existence so quickly that, to use the words of Robert Stephenson, they \"appeared like the realisation of fabled powers or the magician's wand.\"  The _Illustrated London News_ of the day said: \"Railway speculation has become the sole object of the world--cupidity is aroused and roguery shields itself under its name, as a more safe and rapid way of gaining its ends.  Abroad, as well as at home, has it proved the rallying point of all rascality--the honest man is carried away by the current and becomes absorbed in the vortex; the timid, the quiet, the moral are, after some hesitation, caught in the whirlpool and follow those whom they have watched with pity and derision.\"  Powers were granted by Parliament in the year 1845 to construct no less than 2,883 miles of new railway at an expenditure of about 44,000,000 pounds; and in the next year (1846) applications were made to Parliament for authority to raise 389,000,000 pounds for the construction of further lines.  These powers were granted to the extent of 4,790 miles at a cost of about 120,000,000 pounds.  Soon there came a change; disaster followed success; securities fell; dividends diminished or disappeared altogether or, as was in some cases discovered, were paid out of capital, and disappointment and ruin followed.  King Hudson's methods came under a fierce fire of criticism; adulation was succeeded by abuse and he was disgraced and dethroned.  A writer of the day said, \"Mr. Hudson is neither better nor worse than the morality of his time.\"  From affluence he came to want, and in his old age a fund was raised sufficient to purchase him an annuity of 600 pounds a year.  About this time, that most useful Institution the Railway Clearing House received Parliamentary sanction.  The _Railway Clearing System Act_ 1850 gave it statutory recognition.  Its functions have been defined thus: \"To settle and adjust the receipts arising from railway traffic within, or partly within, the United Kingdom, and passing over more than one railway within the United Kingdom, booked or invoiced at throughout rates of fares.\"  The system had then been in existence, in a more or less informal way, for about eight years.  Mr. Allport, on one occasion, said that whilst he was with the Birmingham and Derby railway (before he became general manager of the Midland) the process of settlement of receipts for through traffic was tedious and difficult, and it occurred to him that a system should be adopted similar to that which existed in London and was known "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/173"],["title","The Insidious Dr. Fu Manchu (#1)"],["body","it affords me no assistance.\"  \"Nothing,\" I replied.  \"It is most curious.\"  \"Excuse me, Mr. Burboyne,\" said Smith, now turning to the secretary, \"but Inspector Weymouth will tell you that I act with authority.  I understand that Sir Crichton was--seized with illness in his study?\"  \"Yes--at half-past ten.  I was working here in the library, and he inside, as was our custom.\"  \"The communicating door was kept closed?\"  \"Yes, always.  It was open for a minute or less about ten-twenty-five, when a message came for Sir Crichton.  I took it in to him, and he then seemed in his usual health.\"  \"What was the message?\"  \"I could not say.  It was brought by a district messenger, and he placed it beside him on the table.  It is there now, no doubt.\"  \"And at half-past ten?\"  \"Sir Crichton suddenly burst open the door and threw himself, with a scream, into the library.  I ran to him but he waved me back.  His eyes were glaring horribly.  I had just reached his side when he fell, writhing, upon the floor.  He seemed past speech, but as I raised him and laid him upon the couch, he gasped something that sounded like 'The red hand!' Before I could get to bell or telephone he was dead!\"  Mr. Burboyne's voice shook as he spoke the words, and Smith seemed to find this evidence confusing.  \"You do not think he referred to the mark on his own hand?\"  \"I think not.  From the direction of his last glance, I feel sure he referred to something in the study.\"  \"What did you do?\"  \"Having summoned the servants, I ran into the study. But there was absolutely nothing unusual to be seen.  The windows were closed and fastened.  He worked with closed windows in the hottest weather.  There is no other door, for the study occupies the end of a narrow wing, so that no one could possibly have gained access to it, whilst I was in the library, unseen by me.  Had someone concealed himself in the study earlier in the evening--and I am convinced that it offers no hiding-place--he could only have come out again by passing through here.\"  Nayland Smith tugged at the lobe of his left ear, as was his habit when meditating.  \"You had been at work here in this way for some time?\"  \"Yes.  Sir Crichton was preparing an important book.\"  \"Had anything unusual occurred prior to this evening?\"  \"Yes,\" said Mr. Burboyne, with evident perplexity; \"though I attached no importance to it at the time.  Three nights ago Sir Crichton came out to me, and appeared very nervous; but at times his nerves--you know?  Well, on this occasion he asked me to search the study.  He had an idea that something was concealed there.\"  \"Some THING or someone?\"  \"'Something' was the word he used.  I searched, but fruitlessly, and he seemed quite satisfied, and returned to his work.\"  \"Thank you, Mr. Burboyne.  My friend and I would like a few minutes' private investigation in the study.\"    CHAPTER II   SIR CRICHTON DAVEY'S study was a small one, and a glance sufficed to show that, as the secretary had said, it offered no hiding-place. It was heavily carpeted, and over-full of Burmese and Chinese ornaments and curios, and upon the mantelpiece stood several framed photographs which showed this to be the sanctum of a wealthy bachelor who was no misogynist.  A map of the Indian Empire occupied the larger part of one wall.  The grate was empty, for the weather was extremely warm, and a green-shaded lamp on the littered writing-table afforded the only light.  The air was stale, for both windows were closed and fastened.  Smith immediately pounced upon a large, square envelope that lay beside the blotting-pad. Sir Crichton had not even troubled to open it, but my friend did so.  It contained a blank sheet of paper!  \"Smell!\" he directed, handing the letter to me.  I raised it to my nostrils.  It was scented with some pungent perfume.  \"What is it?\"  I asked.  \"It is a rather rare essential oil,\" was the reply, \"which I have met with before, though never in Europe.  I begin to understand, Petrie.\"  He tilted the lamp-shade and made a close examination of the scraps of paper, matches, and other debris that lay in the grate and on the hearth.  I took up a copper vase from the mantelpiece, and was examining it curiously, when he turned, a strange expression upon his face.  \"Put that back, old man,\" he said quietly.  Much surprised, I did as he directed.  \"Don't touch anything in the room.  It may be dangerous.\"  Something in the tone of his voice chilled me, and I hastily replaced the vase, and stood by the door of the study, watching him search, methodically, every inch of the room--behind the books, in all the ornaments, in table drawers, in cupboards, on shelves.  \"That will do,\" he said at last.  \"There is nothing here and I have no time to search farther.\"  We returned to the library.  \"Inspector Weymouth,\" said my friend, \"I have a particular reason for asking that Sir Crichton's body be removed from this room at once and the library locked.  Let no one be admitted on any pretense whatever until you hear from me.\" It spoke volumes for the mysterious credentials borne by my friend that the man from Scotland Yard accepted his orders without demur, and, after a brief chat with Mr. Burboyne, Smith passed briskly downstairs.  In the hall a man who looked like a groom out of livery was waiting.  \"Are you Wills?\" asked Smith.  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"It was you who heard a cry of some kind at the rear of the house about the time of Sir Crichton's death?\"  \"Yes, sir.  I was locking the garage door, and, happening to look up at the window of Sir Crichton's study, I saw him jump out of his chair. Where he used to sit at his writing, sir, you could see his shadow on the blind.  Next minute I heard a call out in the lane.\"  \"What kind of call?\"  The man, whom the uncanny happening clearly had frightened, seemed puzzled for a suitable description.  \"A sort of wail, sir,\" he said at last.  \"I never heard anything like it before, and don't want to again.\"  \"Like this?\" inquired Smith, and he uttered a low, wailing cry, impossible to describe.  Wills perceptibly shuddered; and, indeed, it was an eerie sound.  \"The same, sir, I think,\" he said, \"but much louder.\"  \"That will do,\" said Smith, and I thought I detected a note of triumph in his voice.  \"But stay!  Take us through to the back of the house.\"  The man bowed and led the way, so that shortly we found ourselves in a small, paved courtyard.  It was a perfect summer's night, and the deep blue vault above was jeweled with myriads of starry points.  How impossible it seemed to reconcile that vast, eternal calm with the hideous passions and fiendish agencies which that night had loosed a soul upon the infinite.  \"Up yonder are the study windows, sir.  Over that wall on your left is the back lane from which the cry came, and beyond is Regent's Park.\"  \"Are the study windows visible from there?\"  \"Oh, yes, sir.\"  \"Who occupies the adjoining house?\"  \"Major-General Platt-Houston, sir; but the family is out of town.\"  \"Those iron stairs are a means of communication between the domestic offices and the servants' quarters, I take it?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Then send someone to make my business known to the Major-General's housekeeper; I want to examine those stairs.\"  Singular though my friend's proceedings appeared to me, I had ceased to wonder at anything.  Since Nayland Smith's arrival at my rooms I seemed to have been moving through the fitful phases of a nightmare.  My friend's account of how he came by the wound in his arm; the scene on our arrival at the house of Sir Crichton Davey; the secretary's story of the dying man's cry, \"The red hand!\"; the hidden perils of the study; the wail in the lane--all were fitter incidents of delirium than of sane reality.  So, when a white-faced butler made us known to a nervous old lady who proved to be the housekeeper of the next-door residence, I was not surprised at Smith's saying:  \"Lounge up and down outside, Petrie.  Everyone has cleared off now.  It is getting late.  Keep your eyes open and be on your guard.  I thought I had the start, but he is here before me, and, what is worse, he probably knows by now that I am here, too.\"  With which he entered the house and left me out in the square, with leisure to think, to try to understand.  The crowd which usually haunts the scene of a sensational crime had been cleared away, and it had been circulated that Sir Crichton had died from natural causes.  The intense heat having driven most of the residents out of town, practically I had the square to myself, and I gave myself up to a brief consideration of the mystery in which I so suddenly had found myself involved.  By what agency had Sir Crichton met his death?  Did Nayland Smith know? I rather suspected that he did.  What was the hidden significance of the perfumed envelope?  Who was that mysterious personage whom Smith so evidently dreaded, who had attempted his life, who, presumably, had murdered Sir Crichton?  Sir Crichton Davey, during the time that he had held office in India, and during his long term of service at home, had earned the good will of all, British and native alike.  Who was his secret enemy?  Something touched me lightly on the shoulder.  I turned, with my heart fluttering like a child's. This night's work had imposed a severe strain even upon my callous nerves.  A girl wrapped in a hooded opera-cloak stood at my elbow, and, as she glanced up at me, I thought that I never had seen a face so seductively lovely nor of so unusual a type.  With the skin of a perfect blonde, she had eyes and lashes as black as a Creole's, which, together with her full red lips, told me that this beautiful stranger, whose touch had so startled me, was not a child of our northern shores.  \"Forgive me,\" she said, speaking with an odd, pretty accent, and laying a slim hand, with jeweled fingers, confidingly upon my arm, \"if I startled you.  But--is it true that Sir Crichton Davey has been--murdered?\"  I looked into her big,"]]]
