And King Henry loved to watch the sports of his subjects. His simple mind; that shrank from the intrigues of court life, seemed to gather strength and health when removed from the strife and turmoil of parties. His malady, which at times completely incapacitated him from tasking part in the government, was always liable to recur, and it was with a view of recuperating his health, and calming his anxieties and fears for himself and those he loved best, that the queen had decided upon this progress through the loyal midland counties, and encouraged the people to display their skill in manly sports before their king; for nothing seemed more beneficial to him than the interest evoked by any spectacles of this kind.  And little Paul Stukely was an eager spectator of the encounters and feats that were taking place before royalty that bright summer day. Paul felt as if he were living and moving in a wonderful dream. He kept pulling off his little velvet cap to make sure that the silver swan--the prince's token--was still in its place; and even when most interested in any contest going on upon the green, his eyes would turn instinctively toward the fair child leaning upon his father's knee, and eagerly watching the rustic revels.  The royal guests were sumptuously lodged beneath a silken awning under a mighty oak tree that gave a refreshing shade. A platform had been erected for them beneath the awning, and chairs of state set thereon. From this vantage ground they could watch everything that went on, and reward the victors with words of praise, small pieces of silver, or some fragment of lace or ribbon from the royal apparel, as best suited the rank of the aspirant for honour; and the kindly smiles and gracious words bestowed upon all who approached increased each hour the popularity of the Lancastrian cause and the devotion of the people to their king.  But Paul had not, so far, ventured to present himself before the platform where the little prince was standing. He had not forgotten a single one of the kind words spoken by the youthful Edward yesterday, but he was fearful of presuming upon the favour thus shown him, and his very admiration for the princely child seemed to hold him back.  He knew that his father and brothers might rebuke him for forwardness if he presumed to thrust himself into notice. Sir James was one of those appointed to keep order upon the ground, and withhold the rustics from incommoding in any way the royal visitors; and the child knew that he would be the first to rebuke his own son for putting himself unduly forward. As the youngest in the house, Paul was accustomed to be held in small repute, and had no desire to provoke a rebuff which might even reach the ears of the little prince himself.  So he contented himself by hanging about on the outskirts of the crowd, casting many longing, lingering glances toward the group beneath the giant oak, and at other times diverting himself by watching the wrestlers, the mummers, or the archers, who in turn came forward to try their skill and strength. The quarterstaff contests were very exciting, and several broken heads were the result of the hearty encounters with that formidable weapon.  But Paul was familiar with most of the sports, and presently grew weary of watching. It was hot, too, and there was not much shade to be had in that big meadow; so he wandered a little apart, toward a copse beside a small stream, on the opposite side of which a thick forest rose stately and grand, and sitting down beside the merry brook, he clasped his hands round his knees and sank into a reverie.  He was so engrossed in his thoughts that he did not notice the light tread of approaching footsteps, and gave a great start when he suddenly felt an arm flung caressingly about his neck. He sprang to his feet with a cry of astonishment, and stood face to face with the little prince.  \"You see I have found you,\" cried the child gleefully. \"I saw you several times in the crowd today, but you would not come near me. Never mind; this is much better, for here we can talk, here we can be friends. Are you aweary of their gay shows? So am I, in faith. We have seen the same thing everywhere, and it is so good to be alone sometimes. I love not to be always followed and watched.  \"See you that dim, dark wood? Let us e'en hide ourselves therein for a short hour. My mother will miss me from her side anon, and will send to seek me. I would not be found too easily. Come, let us hide ourselves there, and you shall tell me all about yourself, and we will play at being trusty friends and comrades.  \"It is dull work being always a prince. I would that we could change parts for once. You shall be the prince and I will be the bold knight's son, and your very faithful servant.\"  \"O my lord!\" faltered Paul, almost overcome with excitement and pleasure at this strange encounter.  But the little prince stamped his foot and spoke with the air of a regular little autocrat.  \"Nay, call me not that. Did I not say I would be nobody's lord for the nonce? What is your name? Paul? Then I will be called Paul for this next hour, and you shall be Edward. See, here is my jewelled collar and the cap with the ostrich plume--the badge of the Prince of Wales. Yes, put them on, put them on. Marry, I could think it was my very self, but a short inch the taller.  \"Now, see, I take your cap instead; and now I am Paul, and you must bid me follow you and attend you in your journey through the forest. See, we will be fugitives, flying from the wicked Duke of York, who would fain grasp at the king's power, but my mother will not let him.\"  For a moment the child's eyes flashed, and his clenched hands and heaving breast showed that the spirit of Margaret of Anjou lived again in her child; but pulling himself up short with a laugh, the little prince added with a deferential bow, resuming his character of subject, \"But I crave your pardon, sweet prince, if I lose control of myself in the thought of your wrongs. Lead on, noble lord, and I follow. Let us seek safety in the dim aisles of yon giant wood. Surely there is some ford or bridge nigh at hand which will give us safe crossing without wetting ourselves.\"  Children are children all the world over, and at any period of its history. Childhood ever delights in romance and imaginative situations and adventures; and before ten minutes had passed the boys had completely entered into the spirit of their play. Paul, shaking off the awe which had at first held him silent and abashed, played the part of prince with an energy and zeal which evoked the delight and admiration of his companion; whilst the younger boy was amused to lay aside for the moment any pretence at royalty, and pay his humble devoirs to his liege lord.  Paul knew of some stepping stones which led across the stream into the dark wood, and soon the boys were in what seemed to them the heart of the great forest. The prince was delighted by all he saw. The sense of freedom was enchanting, and his curiosity unbounded. He had never in his life before enjoyed a game of play in so unfettered a fashion with a comrade of nearly his own age; and soon forgetting even their own game, the boys were walking with arms twined round each other's neck, telling each other all that was in their hearts, and exchanging vows of unalterable affection.  \"When I am grown to manhood, and am a belted knight with noble gentlemen of mine own to attend me, you shall be my very first esquire, Paul,\" said the prince emphatically; \"and we will ride through the world together, seeking adventures which shall make all men wonder when they hear of them. And when I am king you shall be my first counsellor and greatest lord. I will degrade from office and dignity those proud nobles who have been traitors at heart to my kingly father, and to you I will give their broad lands and high titles. We will thus be comrades and friends through life. You would never desert me, would you, Paul?\"  \"I would lay down my life for your highness,\" cried Paul with enthusiasm. \"I will live and die true to the Red Rose--to the sign of the silver swan.\"  The little prince's eyes kindled.  \"I believe you would. I love you, Paul, and methinks that you would love me too. I would that I could take you with me now to be my friend and comrade through life; but perchance your lady mother could ill spare you, by what you say. I know what a mother's love is like.\"  Paul's face was grave. For the first time in his life he was confronted by the problem of a divided duty--that problem which troubles us all more or less at some time in our history.  \"I would gladly go with your highness to the world's end,\" he said. \"I should love to live and die at your side; but I doubt me if it would not be cruel to my mother. She sometimes tells me that her life would be a lone one without me.\"  \"And you must stay with her,\" said the prince with decision; \"at least so long as you are a child. When you are a grown man it will be different. Some day I will send for you, and you shall be my first and best friend; but it cannot be now. My mother might not approve my choice, and yours might not let you go. Princes as well as other men have to wait for what they want\"--and the child sighed--\"but some day our turn will come.\"  Then they resumed their play, and the hoary wood resounded to the merry shouts of the boys as they ran hither and thither in active sport, till the little prince was fairly tired out, though, still exulting in his escape from maternal vigilance, he stoutly protested against going back.  \"See, good Paul,\" he said, \"here is a right commodious hollow tree, heaped with last year's dead leaves. I will rest awhile hidden away here, where none will find me were they to look for me ever so. And if you could find and bring me here a draught of water from the brook or from some spring, I should be ever grateful. I am sore athirst and weary, too.\"  The child"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15770"],["title","Germany, The Next Republic?

Announcement No. 3.  To the Chief Telegraph Office:  From to-day on, the Post and Telegraph communications between Germany on the one hand and:    1. England,   2. France,   3. Russia,   4. Japan,   5. Belgium,   6. Italy,   7. Montenegro,   8. Servia,   9. Portugal;  on the other hand are interrupted because Germany finds herself in a state of war.  (Signed) Director of the Post and Telegraph.   This notice, which was never published, shows that the man who directed the Post and Telegraph Service of the Imperial Government knew on the 2nd of August, 1914, who Germany's enemies would be.  Of the eleven enemies of Germany to-day only Roumania and the United States were not included.  If the Director of the Post and Telegraph knew what to expect, it is certain that the Imperial Government knew.  This announcement shows that Germany expected war with nine different nations, but at the time it was posted on the bulletin board of the Haupttelegraphenamt, neither Italy, Japan, Belgium nor Portugal had declared war.  Italy did not declare war until nearly a year and a half afterwards, Portugal nearly two years afterward and Japan not until December, 1914.  This document throws an interesting light upon the preparations Germany made for a world war.  The White, Yellow, Grey and Blue Books, which all of the belligerents published after the beginning of the war, dealt only with the attempts of these nations to prevent the war.  None of the nations has as yet published white books to show how it prepared for war, and still, every nation in Europe had been expecting and preparing for a European conflagration.  Winston Churchill, when he was First Lord of the Admiralty, stated at the beginning of the war that England's fleet was mobilised.  France had contributed millions of francs to fortify the Russian border in Poland, although Germany had made most of the guns. Belgium had what the Kaiser called, \"a contemptible little army\" but the soldiers knew how to fight when the invaders came.  Germany had new 42 cm. guns and a network of railroads which operated like shuttles between the Russian and French and Belgian frontiers.  Ever since 1870 Europe had been talking war.  Children were brought up and educated into the belief that some day war would come.  Most people considered it inevitable, although not every one wanted it.  During the exciting days of August, 1914, I was calling at the belligerent embassies and legations in Washington.  Neither M. Jusserand, the French Ambassador, nor Sir Cecil Spring-Rice, the British Ambassador, nor Count von Bernstorff, the Kaiser's representative, were in Washington then.  But it was not many weeks until all three had hastened to this country from Europe.  Almost the first act of the belligerents was to send their envoys to Washington.  As I met these men I was in a sense an agent of public opinion who called each day to report the opinions of the belligerents to the readers of American newspapers.  One day at the British Embassy I was given copies of the White Book and of many other documents which Great Britain had issued to show how she tried to avoid the war.  In conversations later with Ambassador von Bernstorff, I was given the German viewpoint.  The thing which impressed me at the time was the desire of these officials to get their opinions before the American people.  But why did these ambassadors want the standpoints of their governments understood over here?  Why was the United States singled out of all other neutrals?  If all the belligerents really wanted to avoid war, why did they not begin twenty years before, to prevent it, instead of, to prepare for it?  All the powers issued their official documents for one primary purpose--to win public opinion.  First, it was necessary for each country to convince its own people that their country was being attacked and that their leaders had done everything possible to avoid war.  Even in Europe people would not fight without a reason.  The German Government told the people that unless the army was mobilised immediately Russia would invade and seize East Prussia.  England, France and Belgium explained to their people that Germany was out to conquer the world by way of Belgium and France.  But White Books were not circulated alone in Europe; they were sent by the hundreds of thousands into the United States and translated into every known language so that the people of the whole world could read them.  Then the word battles between the Allies and the Central Powers began in the United States.  While the soldiers fought on the battlefields of Belgium, France, East Prussia and Poland, an equally bitter struggle was carried on in the United States.  In Europe the object was to stop the invaders.  In America the goal was public opinion.  It was not until several months after the beginning of the war that Sir Edward Grey and Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg began to discuss what the two countries had done before the war, to avoid it.  The only thing either nation could refer to was the 1912 Conference between Lord Haldane and the Chancellor.  This was the only real attempt made by the two leading belligerents to come to an understanding to avoid inevitable bloodshed.  Discussions of these conferences were soon hushed up in Europe because of the bitterness of the people against each other.  The Hymn of Hate had stirred the German people and the Zeppelin raids were beginning to sow the seeds of determination in the hearts of the British.  It was too late to talk about why the war was not prevented.  So each set of belligerents had to rely upon the official documents at the beginning of the war to show what was done to avoid it.  These White Books were written to win public opinion.  But why were the people _suddenly_ taken into the confidence of their governments?  Why had the governments of England, France, Germany and Russia not been so frank before 1914?  Why had they all been interested in making the people speculate as to what would come, and how it would come about? Why were all the nations encouraging suspicion?  Why did they always question the motives, as well as the acts, of each other?  Is it possible that the world progressed faster than the governments and that the governments suddenly realised that public opinion was the biggest factor in the world?  Each one knew that a war could not be waged without public support and each one knew that the sympathy of the outside world depended more upon public opinion than upon business or military relations.   II  How America Was Shocked by the War  Previous to July, 1914, the American people had thought very little about a European war.  While the war parties and financiers of Europe had been preparing a long time for the conflict, people over here had been thinking about peace.  Americans discussed more of the possibilities of international peace and arbitration than war. Europeans lived through nothing except an expectancy of war.  Even the people knew who the enemies might be.  The German government, as the announcement of the Post and Telegraph Director shows, knew nine of its possible enemies before war had been declared.  So it was but natural, when the first reports reached the United States saying that the greatest powers of Europe were engaged in a death struggle, that people were shocked and horrified.  And it was but natural for thousands of them to besiege President Wilson with requests for him to offer his services as a mediator.  The war came, too, during the holiday season in Europe.  Over 90,000 Americans were in the war zones.  The State Department was flooded with telegrams.  Senators and Congressmen were urged to use their influence to get money to stranded Americans to help them home.  The 235 U.S. diplomatic and consular representatives were asked to locate Americans and see to their comfort and safety.  Not until Americans realised how closely they were related to Europe could they picture themselves as having a direct interest in the war.  Then the stock market began to tumble.  The New York Stock Exchange was closed.  South America asked New York for credit and supplies, and neutral Europe, as well as China in the Far East, looked to the United States to keep the war within bounds.  Uncle Sam became the Atlas of the world and nearly every belligerent requested this government to take over its diplomatic and consular interests in enemy countries.  Diplomacy, commerce, finance and shipping suddenly became dependent upon this country.  Not only the belligerents but the neutrals sought the leadership of a nation which could look after all the interests, except those of purely military and naval operations.  The eyes of the world centred upon Washington. President Wilson, as the official head of the government, was signalled out as the one man to help them in their suffering and to listen to their appeals.  The belligerent governments addressed their protests and their notes to Wilson.  Belgium sent a special commission to gain the President's ear.  The peace friends throughout the world, even those in the belligerent countries, looked to Wilson for guidance and help.  In August, 1914, Mrs. Woodrow Wilson, the President's wife, was dangerously ill.  I was at the White House every day to report the developments there for the United Press.  On the evening of the 5th of August Secretary Tumulty called the correspondents and told them that the President, who was deeply distressed by the war, and who was suffering personally because of his wife's illness, had written at his wife's bedside the following message:   \"As official head of one of the powers signatory to The Hague Convention, I feel it to be my privilege and my duty, under Article III of that Convention, to say to you in the spirit of most "]]]
