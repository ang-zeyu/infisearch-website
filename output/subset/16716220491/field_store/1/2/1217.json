An apoplexy on your softness! The papers speak as loudly as they please--why should I hold my tongue? A dog-butcher of a priest!\"  \"Well,\" answered Gianbattista in a meditative tone, as he selected another chisel, \"he has the money to pay for what he orders. If he had not, we would not work for him, I suppose.\"  \"If we had the money, you mean,\" retorted Marzio. \"Why the devil should he have money rather than we? Why don't you answer? Why should he wear silk stockings--red silk stockings, the animal? Why should he want a silver ewer and basin to wash his hands at his mass? Why would not an earthen one do as well, such as I use? Why don't you answer? Eh?\"  \"Why should Prince Borghese live in a palace and keep scores of horses?\" inquired the young man calmly.  \"Ay--why should he? Is there any known reason why he should? Am I not a man as well as he? Are you not a man--you young donkey? I hate to think that we, who are artists, who can work when we are put to it, have to slave for such fellows as that--mumbling priests, bloated princes, a pack of fools who are incapable of an idea! An idea! What am I saying? Who have not the common intelligence of a cabbage-seller in the street! And look at the work we give them--the creation of our minds, the labour of our hands--\"  \"They give us their money in return,\" observed Gianbattista. \"The ancients, whom you are so fond of talking about, used to get their work done by slaves chained to the bench--\"  \"Yes! And it has taken us two thousand years to get to the point we have reached! Two thousand years--and what is it? Are we any better than slaves, except that we work better?\"  \"I doubt whether we work better.\"  \"What is the matter with you this morning?\" cried Marzio. \"Have you been sneaking into some church on your way here? Pah! You smell of the sacristy! Has Paolo been here? Oh, to think that a brother of mine should be a priest! It is not to be believed!\"  \"It is the irony of fate. Moreover, he gets you plenty of orders.\"  \"Yes, and no doubt he takes his percentage on the price. He had a new cloak last month, and he asked me to make him a pair of silver buckles for his shoes. Pretty, that--an artist's brother with silver buckles! I told him to go to the devil, his father, for his ornaments. Why does he not steal an old pair from the cardinal, his bondmaster? Not good enough, I suppose--beast!\"  Marzio laid aside his hammer and chisel, and lit the earthen pipe with the rough wooden stem that lay beside him. Then he examined the beautiful head of the angel he had been making upon the body of the ewer. He touched it lovingly, loosed the cord, and lifted the piece from the pad, turning it towards the light and searching critically for any defect in the modelling of the little face. He replaced it on the table, and selecting a very fine-pointed punch, laid down his pipe for a moment and set about putting the tiny pupils into the eyes. Two touches were enough. He began smoking again, and contemplated what he had done. It was the body of a large silver ewer of which Gianbattista was ornamenting the neck and mouth, which were of a separate piece. Amongst the intricate arabesques little angels'-heads were embossed, and on one side a group of cherubs was bearing a \"monstrance\" with the sacred Host through silver clouds. A hackneyed subject on church vessels, but which had taken wonderful beauty under the skilled fingers of the artist, who sat cursing the priest who was to use it, while expending his best talents on its perfections.  \"It is not bad,\" he said rather doubtfully. \"Come and look at it, Tista,\" he added. The young man left his place and came and bent over his master's shoulder, examining the piece with admiration. It was characteristic of Marzio that he asked his apprentice's opinion. He was an artist, and had the chief peculiarities of artists--namely, diffidence concerning what he had done, and impatience of the criticism of others, together with a strong desire to show his work as soon as it was presentable.  \"It is a masterpiece!\" exclaimed Gianbattista. \"What detail! I shall never be able to finish anything like that cherub's face!\"  \"Do you think it is as good as the one I made last year, Tista?\"  \"Better,\" returned the young man confidently. \"It is the best you have ever made. I am quite sure of it. You should always work when you are in a bad humour; you are so successful!\"  \"Bad humour! I am always in a bad humour,\" grumbled Marzio, rising and walking about the brick floor, while he puffed clouds of acrid smoke from his coarse pipe. \"There is enough in this world to keep a man in a bad humour all his life.\"  \"I might say that,\" answered Gianbattista, turning round on his stool and watching his master's angular movements as he rapidly paced the room. \"I might abuse fate--but you! You are rich, married, a father, a great artist!\"  \"What stuff!\" interrupted Marzio, standing still with his long legs apart, and folding his arms as he spoke through his teeth, between which he still held his pipe. \"Rich? Yes--able to have a good coat for feast-days, meat when I want it, and my brother's company when I don't want it--for a luxury, you know! Able to take my wife to Frascati on the last Thursday of October as a great holiday. My wife, too! A creature of beads and saints and little books with crosses on them--who would leer at a friar through the grating of a confessional, and who makes the house hideous with her howling if I choose to eat a bit of pork on a Friday! A good wife indeed! A jewel of a wife, and an apoplexy on all such jewels! A nice wife, who has a face like a head from a tombstone in the Campo Varano for her husband, and who has brought up her daughter to believe that her father is condemned to everlasting flames because he hates cod-fish--salt cod-fish soaked in water! A wife who sticks images in the lining of my hat to convert me, and sprinkles holy water on me Then she thinks I am asleep, but I caught her at that the other night--\"  \"Indeed, they say the devil does not like holy water,\" remarked Gianbattista, laughing.  \"And you want to many my daughter, you young fool,\" continued Marzio, not heeding the interruption. \"You do. I will tell you what she is like. My daughter--yes!--she has fine eyes, but she has the tongue of the--\"  \"Of her father,\" suggested Gianbattista, suddenly frowning.  \"Yes--of her father, without her father's sense,\" cried Marzio angrily. \"With her eyes, those fine eyes!--those eyes!--you want to marry her. If you wish to take her away, you may, and good riddance. I want no daughter; there are too many women in the world already. They and the priests do all the harm between them, because the priests know how to think too well, and women never think at all. I wish you good luck of your marriage and of your wife. If you were my son you would never have thought of getting married. The mere idea of it made you send your chisel through a cherub's eye last week and cost an hoax's time for repairing. Is that the way to look at the great question of humanity? Ah! if I were only a deputy in the Chambers, I would teach you the philosophy of all that rubbish!\"  \"I thought you said the other day that you would not have any deputies at all,\" observed the apprentice, playing with his hammer.  \"Such as these are--no! A few of them I would put into the acid bath, as I would a casting, to clean them before chiselling them down. They might be good for something then. You must begin by knocking down, boy, if you want to build up. You must knock down everything, raze the existing system to the ground, and upon the place where it stood shall rise the mighty temple of immortal liberty.\"  \"And who will buy your chalices and monstrances under the new order of things?\" inquired Gianbattista coldly.  \"The foreign market,\" returned Marzio. \"Italy shall be herself again, as she was in the days of Michael Angelo; of Leonardo, who died in the arms of a king; of Cellini, who shot a prince from the walls of Saint Angelo. Italy shall be great, shall monopolise the trade, the art, the greatness of all creation!\"  \"A lucrative monopoly!\" exclaimed the young man.  \"Monopolies! There shall be no monopolies! The free artisan shall sell what he can make and buy what he pleases. The priests shall be turned out in chain gangs and build roads for our convenience, and the superfluous females shall all be deported to the glorious colony of Massowah! If I could but be absolute master of this country for a week I could do much.\"  \"I have no doubt of it,\" answered Gianbattista, with a quiet smile.  \"I should think not,\" assented Marzio proudly; then catching sight of the expression on the young man's face, he turned sharply upon him. \"You are mocking me, you good-for-nothing!\" he cried angrily. \"You are laughing at me, at your master, you villain you wretch, you sickly hound, you priest-ridden worm! It is intolerable! It is the first time you have ever dared; do you think I am going to allow you to think for yourself after all the pains I have taken to educate you, to teach you my art, you ungrateful reptile?\"  \"If you were not such a great artist I would have left you long ago,\" answered the apprentice. \"Besides, I believe in your principles. It is your expression of them that makes me laugh now and then; I think you go too far sometimes!\"  \"As if any one had ever gone far enough\" exclaimed Marzio, somewhat pacified, for his moods were very quick. \"Since there are still men who are richer than others, it is a sign that we have not gone to the end--to the great end in which we believe. I am sure you believe in it too, Tista, don't you?\"  \"Oh yes--in the end--certainly.

I must do another leaf before dinner.\"  \"I will get in another cherub's nose,\" said his master, preparing to relight his pipe for a whiff before going to work again. \"Body of a dog, these priests!\" he grumbled, as he attacked the next angel on the ewer with matchless dexterity and steadiness. A long pause followed the animated discourse of the chiseller. Both men were intent upon their work, alternately holding their breath for the delicate strokes, and breathing more freely as the chisel reached the end of each tiny curve.  \"I think you said a little while ago that I might marry Lucia,\" observed Gianbattista, without looking up, \"that is, if I would take her away!\"  \"And if you take her away,\" retorted the other, \"where will you get bread?\"  \"Where I get it now. I could live somewhere else and come here to work; it seems simple enough.\"  \"It seems simple, but it is not,\" replied Marzio. \"Perhaps you could try and get Paolo's commissions away from me, and then set up a studio for yourself; but I doubt whether you could succeed. I am not old yet, nor blind, nor shaky, thank God!\"  \"I did not catch the last words,\" said Gianbattista, hiding his smile over his work.  \"I said I was not old, nor broken down yet, thanks to my strength,\" growled the chiseller; \"you will not steal my commissions yet awhile. What is the matter with you to-day? You find fault with half I say, and the other half you do not hear at all. You seem to have lost your head, Tista. Be steady over those acanthus leaves; everybody thinks an acanthus leaf is the easiest thing in the world, whereas it is one of the most difficult before you get to figures. Most chisellers seem to copy their acanthus leaves from the cabbage in their soup. They work as though they had never seen the plant growing. When the Greeks began to carve Corinthian capitals, they must have worked from real leaves, as I taught you to model when you were a boy. Few things are harder than a good acanthus leaf.\"  \"I should think women could do the delicate part of our work very well,\" said the apprentice, returning to the subject from which Marzio was evidently trying to lead him. \"Lucia has such very clever fingers.\"  \"Idiot!\" muttered Marzio between his teeth, not deigning to make any further answer.  The distant boom of a gun broke upon the silence that followed, and immediately the bells of all the neighbouring churches rang out in quick succession. It was midday.  \"I did not expect to finish that nose,\" said Marzio, rising from his stool. He was a punctual man, who exacted punctuality in others, and in spite of his thin frame and nervous ways, he loved his dinner. In five minutes all the men had left the workshop, and Marzio and his apprentice stood in the street, the former locking the heavy door with a lettered padlock, while the younger man sniffed the fresh spring air that blew from the west out of the square of San Carlo a Catenari down the Via dei Falegnami in which the establishment of the silver-chiseller was situated.  As Marzio fumbled with the fastenings of the door, two women came up and stopped. Marzio had his back turned, and Gianbattista touched his hat in silence. The younger of the two was a stout, black-haired woman of eight-and-thirty years, dressed in a costume of dark green cloth, which fitted very closely to her exuberantly-developed bust, and was somewhat too elaborately trimmed with imitation of jet and black ribands. A high bonnet, decorated with a bunch of purple glass grapes and dark green leaves, surmounted the lady's massive head, and though carefully put on and neatly tied, seemed too small for the wearer. Her ears were adorned by long gold earrings, in each of which were three large garnets, and these trinkets dangled outside and over the riband of the bonnet, which passed under her chin. In her large hands, covered with tight black gloves, she carried a dark red parasol and a somewhat shabby little black leather bag with steel fastenings. The stout lady's face was of the type common among the Roman women of the lower class--very broad and heavy, of a creamy white complexion, the upper lip shaded by a dark fringe of down, and the deep sleepy eyes surmounted by heavy straight eyebrows. Her hair, brought forward from under her bonnet, made smooth waves upon her low forehead and reappeared in thick coils at the back of her neck. Her nose was relatively small, but too thick and broad at the nostrils, although it departed but little from the straight line of the classic model. Altogether the Signora Pandolfi, christened Maria Luisa, and wife to Marzio the silver-chiseller, was a portly and pompous-looking person, who wore an air of knowing her position, and of being sure to maintain it. Nevertheless, there was a kindly expression in her fat face, and if her eyes looked sleepy they did not look dishonest.  Signora Pandolfi's companion was her old maid-of-all-work, Assunta, commonly called Suntarella, without whom she rarely stirred abroad--a little old woman, in neat but dingy-coloured garments, with a grey woollen shawl drawn over her head like a cowl, instead of a bonnet.  Marzio finished fastening the door, and then turned round. On seeing his wife he remained silent for a moment, looking at her with an expression of dissatisfied inquiry. He had not expected her.  \"Well?\" he ejaculated at last.  \"It is dinner time,\" remarked the stout lady.  \"Yes, I heard the gun,\" answered Marzio drily. \"It is the same as if you had told me,\" he added ironically, as he turned and led the way across the street.  \"A pretty answer!\" exclaimed Maria Luisa, tossing her large head as she followed her lord and master to the door of their house. Meanwhile Assunta, the old servant, glanced at Gianbattista, rolled up her eyes with an air of resignation, and spread out her withered hands for a moment with a gesture of despair, instantly drawing them in again beneath the folds of her grey woollen shawl.  \"Gadding!\" muttered Marzio, as he entered the narrow door from which the dark steps led abruptly upwards. \"Gadding--always gadding! And who minds the soup-kettle when you are gadding, I should like to know? The cat, I suppose! Oh, these women and their priests! These priests and these women!\"  \"Lucia is minding the soup-kettle,\" gasped Maria Luisa, as she puffed up stairs behind her thin and active husband.  \"Lucia!\" cried Marzio angrily, a flight of steps higher. \"I suppose you will bring her up to be woman of all work? Well, she could earn her living then, which is more than you do! After all, it is better to mind a soup-kettle than to thump a piano and to squeal so that I can hear her in the shop opposite, and it is better than hanging about the church all the morning, or listening to Paolo's drivelling talk. By all means keep her in the kitchen.\"  It was hard to say whether Signora Pandolfi was puffing or sighing as she paused for breath upon the landing, but there was probably something of both in the labour of her lungs. She was used to Marzio. She had lived with him for twenty years, and she knew his moods and his ways, and detected the coming storm from afar. Unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately, for her, there was little variety in the sequence of his ideas. She was accustomed to his beginning at the grumbling stage before dinner, and proceeding by a crescendo movement to the pitch of rage, which was rarely reached until he had finished his meal, when he generally seized his hat and dragged Gianbattista away with him, declaring loudly that women were not fit for human society. The daily excitement of this comedy had long lost its power to elicit anything more than a sigh from the stout Maria Luisa, who generally bore Marzio's unreasonable anger with considerable equanimity, waiting for his departure to eat her boiled beef and salad in peace with Lucia, while old Assunta sat by the table with the cat in her lap, putting in a word of commiseration alternately with a word of gossip about the lodgers on the other side of the landing. The latter were a young and happy pair: the husband, a chorus singer at the Apollo, who worked at glove cleaning during the day time; his wife, a sempstress, who did repairs upon the costumes of the theatre. Their apartments consisted of two rooms and a kitchen, while Marzio and his family occupied the rest of the floor, and entered their lodging by the opposite door.  Maria Luisa envied the couple in her sleepy fashion. Her husband was indeed comparatively rich, and though economical in his domestic arrangements, he had money in the bank enough to keep him comfortably for the rest of his days. His violence did not extend beyond words and black looks, and he was not miserly about a few francs for dress, or a dinner at the Falcone two or three times a year. But in the matter of domestic peace his conduct left much to be desired. He was a sober man, but his hours were irregular, for he attended the meetings of a certain club which Maria Luisa held in abhorrence, and brought back opinions which made her cross herself with her fat fingers, shuddering at the things he said. As for Gianbattista Bordogni, who lived with them, and consequently received most of his wages in the shape of board and lodging, he loved Lucia Pandolfi, his master's daughter, and though he shared Marzio's opinions, he held his tongue in the house. He understood how necessary to him the mother's sympathy must be, and, with subtle intelligence, he knew how to create a contrast between himself and his master by being reticent at the right moment.  Lucia opened the door in answer to the bell her father had rung, and stood aside in the narrow way to let members of the household pass by, one by one. Lucia was seventeen years old, and probably resembled her mother as the latter had looked at the same age. She was slight, and tall, and dark, with a quantity of glossy black hair coiled behind her head. Her black eyes had not yet"]]]
