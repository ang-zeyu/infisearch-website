The grotesque idea momentarily possessed me that, were the bloom of her red lips due to art and not to nature, their kiss would leave--though not indelibly--just such a mark as I had seen upon the dead man's hand. But I dismissed the fantastic notion as bred of the night's horrors, and worthy only of a mediaeval legend.  No doubt she was some friend or acquaintance of Sir Crichton who lived close by.  \"I cannot say that he has been murdered,\" I replied, acting upon the latter supposition, and seeking to tell her what she asked as gently as possible.  \"But he is--Dead?\"  I nodded.  She closed her eyes and uttered a low, moaning sound, swaying dizzily. Thinking she was about to swoon, I threw my arm round her shoulder to support her, but she smiled sadly, and pushed me gently away.  \"I am quite well, thank you,\" she said.  \"You are certain?  Let me walk with you until you feel quite sure of yourself.\"  She shook her head, flashed a rapid glance at me with her beautiful eyes, and looked away in a sort of sorrowful embarrassment, for which I was entirely at a loss to account.  Suddenly she resumed:  \"I cannot let my name be mentioned in this dreadful matter, but--I think I have some information--for the police.  Will you give this to--whomever you think proper?\"  She handed me a sealed envelope, again met my eyes with one of her dazzling glances, and hurried away.  She had gone no more than ten or twelve yards, and I still was standing bewildered, watching her graceful, retreating figure, when she turned abruptly and came back.  Without looking directly at me, but alternately glancing towards a distant corner of the square and towards the house of Major-General Platt-Houston, she made the following extraordinary request:  \"If you would do me a very great service, for which I always would be grateful,\"--she glanced at me with passionate intentness--\"when you have given my message to the proper person, leave him and do not go near him any more to-night!\"  Before I could find words to reply she gathered up her cloak and ran. Before I could determine whether or not to follow her (for her words had aroused anew all my worst suspicions) she had disappeared!  I heard the whir of a restarted motor at no great distance, and, in the instant that Nayland Smith came running down the steps, I knew that I had nodded at my post.  \"Smith!\"  I cried as he joined me, \"tell me what we must do!\" And rapidly I acquainted him with the incident.  My friend looked very grave; then a grim smile crept round his lips.  \"She was a big card to play,\" he said; \"but he did not know that I held one to beat it.\"  \"What!  You know this girl!  Who is she?\"  \"She is one of the finest weapons in the enemy's armory, Petrie.  But a woman is a two-edged sword, and treacherous.  To our great good fortune, she has formed a sudden predilection, characteristically Oriental, for yourself.  Oh, you may scoff, but it is evident.  She was employed to get this letter placed in my hands.  Give it to me.\"  I did so.  \"She has succeeded.  Smell.\"  He held the envelope under my nose, and, with a sudden sense of nausea, I recognized the strange perfume.  \"You know what this presaged in Sir Crichton's case?  Can you doubt any longer?  She did not want you to share my fate, Petrie.\"  \"Smith,\" I said unsteadily, \"I have followed your lead blindly in this horrible business and have not pressed for an explanation, but I must insist before I go one step farther upon knowing what it all means.\"  \"Just a few steps farther,\" he rejoined; \"as far as a cab.  We are hardly safe here.  Oh, you need not fear shots or knives.  The man whose servants are watching us now scorns to employ such clumsy, tell-tale weapons.\"  Only three cabs were on the rank, and, as we entered the first, something hissed past my ear, missed both Smith and me by a miracle, and, passing over the roof of the taxi, presumably fell in the enclosed garden occupying the center of the square.  \"What was that?\" I cried.  \"Get in--quickly!\"  Smith rapped back.  \"It was attempt number one! More than that I cannot say.  Don't let the man hear.  He has noticed nothing.  Pull up the window on your side, Petrie, and look out behind. Good!  We've started.\"  The cab moved off with a metallic jerk, and I turned and looked back through the little window in the rear.  \"Someone has got into another cab.  It is following ours, I think.\"  Nayland Smith lay back and laughed unmirthfully.  \"Petrie,\" he said, \"if I escape alive from this business I shall know that I bear a charmed life.\"  I made no reply, as he pulled out the dilapidated pouch and filled his pipe.  \"You have asked me to explain matters,\" he continued, \"and I will do so to the best of my ability.  You no doubt wonder why a servant of the British Government, lately stationed in Burma, suddenly appears in London, in the character of a detective.  I am here, Petrie--and I bear credentials from the very highest sources--because, quite by accident, I came upon a clew.  Following it up, in the ordinary course of routine, I obtained evidence of the existence and malignant activity of a certain man.  At the present stage of the case I should not be justified in terming him the emissary of an Eastern Power, but I may say that representations are shortly to be made to that Power's ambassador in London.\"  He paused and glanced back towards the pursuing cab.  \"There is little to fear until we arrive home,\" he said calmly. \"Afterwards there is much.  To continue:  This man, whether a fanatic or a duly appointed agent, is, unquestionably, the most malign and formidable personality existing in the known world today.  He is a linguist who speaks with almost equal facility in any of the civilized languages, and in most of the barbaric.  He is an adept in all the arts and sciences which a great university could teach him.  He also is an adept in certain obscure arts and sciences which no university of to-day can teach.  He has the brains of any three men of genius. Petrie, he is a mental giant.\"  \"You amaze me!\" I said.  \"As to his mission among men.  Why did M. Jules Furneaux fall dead in a Paris opera house?  Because of heart failure?  No!  Because his last speech had shown that he held the key to the secret of Tongking.  What became of the Grand Duke Stanislaus?  Elopement?  Suicide?  Nothing of the kind.  He alone was fully alive to Russia's growing peril.  He alone knew the truth about Mongolia.  Why was Sir Crichton Davey murdered?  Because, had the work he was engaged upon ever seen the light it would have shown him to be the only living Englishman who understood the importance of the Tibetan frontiers.  I say to you solemnly, Petrie, that these are but a few.  Is there a man who would arouse the West to a sense of the awakening of the East, who would teach the deaf to hear, the blind to see, that the millions only await their leader?  He will die.  And this is only one phase of the devilish campaign.  The others I can merely surmise.\"  \"But, Smith, this is almost incredible!  What perverted genius controls this awful secret movement?\"  \"Imagine a person, tall, lean and feline, high-shouldered, with a brow like Shakespeare and a face like Satan, a close-shaven skull, and long, magnetic eyes of the true cat-green. Invest him with all the cruel cunning of an entire Eastern race, accumulated in one giant intellect, with all the resources of science past and present, with all the resources, if you will, of a wealthy government--which, however, already has denied all knowledge of his existence.  Imagine that awful being, and you have a mental picture of Dr. Fu-Manchu, the yellow peril incarnate in one man.\"    CHAPTER III   I SANK into an arm-chair in my rooms and gulped down a strong peg of brandy.  \"We have been followed here,\" I said.  \"Why did you make no attempt to throw the pursuers off the track, to have them intercepted?\"  Smith laughed.  \"Useless, in the first place.  Wherever we went, HE would find us.  And of what use to arrest his creatures?  We could prove nothing against them.  Further, it is evident that an attempt is to be made upon my life to-night--and by the same means that proved so successful in the case of poor Sir Crichton.\"  His square jaw grew truculently prominent, and he leapt stormily to his feet, shaking his clenched fists towards the window.  \"The villain!\" he cried.  \"The fiendishly clever villain!  I suspected that Sir Crichton was next, and I was right.  But I came too late, Petrie!  That hits me hard, old man.  To think that I knew and yet failed to save him!\"  He resumed his seat, smoking hard.  \"Fu-Manchu has made the blunder common to all men of unusual genius,\" he said.  \"He has underrated his adversary.  He has not given me credit for perceiving the meaning of the scented messages.  He has thrown away one powerful weapon--to get such a message into my hands--and he thinks that once safe within doors, I shall sleep, unsuspecting, and die as Sir Crichton died.  But without the indiscretion of your charming friend, I should have known what to expect when I receive her 'information'--which by the way, consists of a blank sheet of paper.\"  \"Smith,\" I broke in, \"who is she?\"  \"She is either Fu-Manchu's daughter, his wife, or his slave.  I am inclined to believe the last, for she has no will but his will, except\"--with a quizzical glance--\"in a certain instance.\"  \"How can you jest with some awful thing--Heaven knows what--hanging over your head?  What is the meaning of these perfumed envelopes?  How did Sir Crichton die?\"  \"He died of the Zayat Kiss.  Ask me what that is and I reply 'I do not know.'  The zayats are the Burmese caravanserais, or rest-houses. Along a certain route--upon which I set eyes, for the first and only time, upon Dr. Fu-Manchu--travelers who use them sometimes die as Sir"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17302"],["title","Transactions of the American Society of Civil Engineers, vol.

St. April 24, 07.]  [Illustration: PLATE XLVII, FIG. 4.--TW 28, P.T. & T.R.R. Co. Terminal Station West. East side of 9th Avenue, North of 32nd St. looking West, showing rock excavation and supports of 9th Avenue structures. Aug. 17, 07.]  Fig. 1, Plate XLVII, shows the elevated railway structure and the street surface prior to the commencement of the work.  The east track is used for north-bound local trains, the west track for south-bound local trains, and the central track for south-bound express trains between 7 and 9.30 A.M. and for north-bound express trains between 2.30 and 7 P.M. It is said that an average of 90,000 passengers are carried over this structure every 24 hours.  _Surface Railway Structure of the New York City Railway Company._--This is an electric surface railway of the ordinary type, the rail and slot being bedded in concrete, with cast-iron yokes every 5 ft. There are manholes every 100 ft., and cleaning-out holes every 15 ft. Power conduits are bedded in the concrete on the east side of the east track.  _Forty-eight-Inch Brick Sewer._--This sewer was in the center of Ninth Avenue, with the invert about 12 ft. below the surface, and manholes about 100 ft. apart, and had to be abandoned in this position to allow the transverse girders to be put in place to carry all structures while the excavation was being done.  _Twenty-four-Inch Cast-Iron Water Main._--This water main was laid under the west elevated railway columns, with its top about 3 ft. below the surface, a space being left for it in the brick foundations, and a large column base casting being used to span it. Valves were installed, one north of 33d Street and one south of 31st Street, prior to excavating near the pipe, so that if it was broken the water could be shut off promptly.  _Street Surface._--It was the original intention to close and excavate the east side of the avenue and to erect there a street-traffic trestle before closing the west side, but, at the contractor's request, both sides were closed, and all vehicular traffic was turned into the center. A light trestle on the west side of the avenue provided for pedestrian traffic.  _Other Sub-surface Structures._--There were various gas mains, water mains, electric conduits, manholes, hydrants, etc., in the avenue, and most of these were cut out temporarily, at the contractor's request, to be replaced subsequently.  _Supports for Elevated Railway Structure._--As stated previously, the central track had to be supported independently.  The overhead girders, known as girders \"B\", were therefore designed as shown on Fig. 1, and put in place as shown on Figs. 2 and 3. The outside tracks were blocked directly on these girders, and the central track was supported by blocking up the transverse girders on I-beams placed between the girders \"B\"; and no blocking was placed between the girders \"B\" and the longitudinal girders carrying the central track. The weight on each column was assumed to be 172,000 lb.  [Illustration: FIG. 1. (Full page image)  DETAILS OF STEEL GIRDERS, ETC. SUPPORTING NINTH AVENUE STRUCTURES]  _Supports for Surface Railway Structure._--A uniform load of 3,000 lb. per lin. ft. of single track, with the weight of a car at 39,000 lb., was assumed. Several feet of earth, between the structure and the rock, were mined out, and the structure was supported on I-beams and posts, and ultimately on the transverse girders by using timber bents under the I-beams, as shown on Fig. 3.  _Water Mains and Sewer._--Cradles were designed for the support of the 48-in. and 24-in. water mains, resting on the transverse girders, and the 48-in. cast-iron sewer on the east side of the avenue was carried on I-beams bracketed to the ends of the transverse girders, as shown on Figs. 1 and 2.  [Illustration: FIG. 2. (Full page image)  METHOD OF SUPPORTING ELEVATED RAILWAY STRUCTURE]  [Illustration: FIG. 3. (Full page image)  METHOD OF SUPPORTING TRACKS OF NEW YORK CITY RAILWAY CO.]  _Girders \"C.\"_--The transverse girders below the street surface, referred to above, were known as girders \"C,\" and they were put in place at first resting on concrete piers on the central core; the weight of all structures was placed on them while the sides of the avenue were being excavated, and the sides of the viaduct were being built. The ends of these girders were then picked up on the sides of the viaduct, and, spanning the central rock core, carried all structures while the core was being excavated and the viaduct completed. New foundations were then placed on the deck of the viaduct to carry all structures.  Fifty-four of these girders were required, each weighing about 19,000 lb. The bents carrying the ends of these girders on the sides of the viaduct are shown on Fig. 2. They were of long-leaf yellow pine. These girders were located so that a cradle could be laid on them east of the elevated railway structure to carry a proposed 48-in. cast-iron water main.  _Girders \"B.\"_--Eighteen of these girders were required, each weighing about 6,000 lb. The timber bents supporting these girders, shown on Fig. 2, were of long-leaf yellow pine.  The total weight, including the elevated railway structure, surface railway structure, pipes, etc., supported during the work, amounted to about 5,000 tons.  _Details of the Work._--The method in general is shown on Figs. 4 and 5. At first the east side of the avenue was closed and excavated down to rock, the earth was mined out under alternate yokes of the surface railway structure, and temporary posts were placed under the yokes to support the structure while the remainder of the earth was being removed. Then needle-beams and posts were placed under each yoke. The concrete forming the track structure was then enclosed with planking to prevent it from cracking and falling. I-beams were then placed under the needle-beams carrying the structures, and these were carried on posts; they were changed alternately until the excavation had been taken out to a depth of about 16 ft. below the surface. In placing these I-beams, heavier blocking was used in the center of the span than at the ends where the bents would come, to prevent the subsidence of the track owing to the sag in the I-beams. As much excavation, to a depth of about 20 ft., was taken out adjoining the elevated railway foundations as could be done with safety. Fig. 2, Plate XLVII, shows this condition of the work. The 48-in. brick sewer was broken, and the sewage was pumped across the excavation.  The overhead girders \"B\" were then put in place, and two of the girders \"C\" were used as temporary shoring girders at each column. These, as shown by Fig. 3, Plate XLVII, were placed parallel to the elevated railway, with blocking between them and the girders \"B.\" Double bents, independent of each other, were placed under the ends of these temporary shoring girders, and these were braced securely to prevent possible dislodgment during the removal of the rock. The weight of the structure was then taken by jacking up the girders near the bents until the column was lifted off the old foundation; blocking was put in between the girders and the bents during the jacking, so that when the jacks were released the base of the column was still clear of the old foundation. One 80-ton jack was used for this purpose, and the general method is shown by Fig. 1, Plate LII.  [Illustration: FIG. 4.

Four sets of these temporary shoring girders were used in this manner, two sets starting at the north end and two sets at about the middle of the work, and these sets were moved south as they were released.  The columns being thus supported on temporary shoring girders, the old foundations were removed and the excavation was taken down to a level about 16 ft. below the surface.  Two sets of three of the girders \"C\" were then put in place under the avenue at each column, each set being placed on four concrete piers 6 ft. square with spaces of 4 ft. between them, so that the outside of the outside pier would be 18 ft. from the center of the avenue and 32 ft. from the house line. This is shown on Fig. 5 and on Fig. 3, Plate XLVII. Four small piers were used, as they could be more easily removed than one continuous pier. The girders \"C\" were set to line and grade, and the piers were built under them, great care being taken to "]]]
