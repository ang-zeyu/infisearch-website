And here is a tale of the crafty Ogs,    In their neighbouring land of Podge; Of their sayings and doings and plottings and brewings,    And something about Sir Stodge.       Wise to profundity,       Stout to rotundity,    That was the Knight, Sir Stodge.  Oh, the King was rich, and the Queen was fair, And they made a very respectable pair.    And whenever a Glug in that peaceful land,    Did anything no one could understand, The Knight, Sir Stodge, he looked in a book, And charged that Glug with a crime called Crook.    And the great Judge Fudge, who wore for a hat    The sacred skin of a tortoiseshell cat, He fined that Glug for his action rash, And frequently asked a deposit in cash.    Then every Glug, he went home to his rest    With his head in a bag and his toes to the West;       For they knew it was best,    Since their grandpas slept with their toes to the West.  But all of the tale that is so far told    Has nothing whatever to do With the Ogs of Podge, and their crafty dodge,    And the trade in pickles and glue. To trade with the Glugs came the Ogs to Gosh,    And they said in seductive tones, \"We'll sell you pianers and pickels and spanners    For seventeen shiploads of stones:       Smooth 'uns or nobbly 'uns,       Firm 'uns or wobbly 'uns,    All we ask is stones.\"  And the King said, \"What?\" and the Queen said, \"Why, That is awfully cheap to the things I buy!    For that grocer of ours in the light brown hat    Asks two and eleven for pickles like that!\" But a Glug stood up with a wart on his nose, And cried, \"Your Majesties! Ogs is foes!\"    But the Glugs cried, \"Peace! Will you hold your jaw!    How did our grandpas fashion the law?\" Said the Knight, Sir Stodge, as he opened his Book, \"When the goods were cheap then the goods we took.\"    So they fined the Glug with the wart on his nose    For wearing a wart with his everyday clothes. And the goods were brought home thro' a Glug named Ghones; And the Ogs went home with their loads of stones,    Which they landed with glee in the land of Podge.       Do you notice the dodge?    Not yet did the Glugs, nor the Knight, Sir Stodge.  In the following Summer the Ogs came back    With a cargo of eight-day clocks, And hand-painted screens, and sewing machines,    And mangles, and scissors, and socks. And they said, \"For these excellent things we bring    We are ready to take more stones;       And in bricks or road-metal       For goods you will settle    Indented by your Mister Ghones.\"       Cried the Glugs praisingly,       \"Why how amazingly    Smart of industrious Ghones!\"  And the King said, \"Hum,\" and the Queen said, \"Oo! That curtain!  What a bee-ootiful blue!\"    But a Glug stood up with some very large ears,    And said, \"There is more in this thing than appears! And we ought to be taxing those goods of the Ogs, Or our industries soon will be gone to the dogs.\"    And the King said, \"Bosh!  You're un-Gluggish and rude!\"    And the Queen said, \"What an absurd attitude!\" Then the Glugs cried, \"Down with political quacks! How did our grandpas look at a tax?\"    So the Knight, Sir Stodge, he opened his Book.    \"No tax,\" said he, \"wherever I look.\" Then they fined the Glug with the prominent ears For being old-fashioned by several years;    And the Ogs went home with the stones, full-steam.       Did you notice the scheme?    Nor yet did the Glugs in their dreamiest dreams.  Then every month to the land of the Gosh    The Ogs, they continued to come, With buttons and hooks, and medical books,    And rotary engines, and rum, Large cases with labels, occasional tables,    Hair tonic and fiddles and 'phones; And the Glugs, while copncealing their joy in the dealing,    Paid promptly in nothing but stones.       Why, it was screamingly       Laughable, seemingly---    Asking for nothing but stones!  And the King said, \"Haw!\" and the Queen said, \"Oh! Our drawing-room now is a heavenly show    Of large overmantels, and whatnots, and chairs,    And a statue of Splosh at the head of the stairs!\" But a Glug stood up with a cast in his eye, And he said, \"Far too many baubles we buy;    With all the Gosh factories closing their doors,    And importers' warehouses lining our shores.\" But the Glugs cried, \"Down with such meddlesome fools! What did our grandpas lay down in their rules?\"    And the Knight, Sir Stodge, he opened his Book:    \"To Cheapness,\" he said, \"was the road they took.\" Then every Glug who was not too fat Turned seventeen handsprings, and jumped on his hat.    They fined the Glug with the cast in his eye    For looking both ways--which he did not deny-- And for having no visible precedent, which Is a crime in the poor and a fault in the rich.  So the Glugs continued, with greed and glee, To buy cheap clothing, and pills, and tea;    Till every Glug in the land of Gosh    Owned three clean shirts and a fourth in the wash. But they all grew idle, and fond of ease, And easy to swindle, and hard to please;    And the voice of Joi was a lonely voice,    When he railed at Gosh for its foolish choice. But the great King grinned, and the good Queen gushed, As the goods of the Ogs were madly rushed.    And the Knight, Sir Stodge, with a wave of his hand,    Declared it a happy and prosperous land.    IV.  SYM, THE SON OF JOI  Now Joi, the rebel, he had a son   In far, far Gosh where the tall trees wave. Said Joi: \"In Gosh there shall yet be one   To scorn this life of a self-made slave; To spurn the law of the Knight, Sir Stodge,   And end the rule of the great King Splosh; Who shall warn the Glugs of their crafty dodge,   And at last bring peace, sweet peace, to Gosh.\"  Said he: \"Whenever the kind sun showers His golden treasure on grateful flowers,   With upturned faces and hearts bowed low,   The Glugs shall know what the wild things know.\" Said he: \"Wherever the broad fields smile, They shall walk with clean minds, free of guile;   They shall scoff aloud at the call of Greed,   And turn to their labours and never heed.\"  So Joi had a son, and his name was Sym;   And his eyes were wide as the eyes of Truth; And there came to the wondering mind of him    Long thoughts of the riddle that vexes youth. And, \"Father,\" he said, \"in the mart's loud din    Is there aught of pleasure?  Do some find joy?\" But his father tilted the beardless chin,    And looked in the eyes of the questing boy.  Said he: \"Whenever the fields are green, Lie still, where the wild rose fashions a screen,    While the brown thrush calls to his love-wise mate,    And know what they profit who trade with Hate.\" Said he: \"Whenever the great skies spread, In the beckoning vastness overhead,    A tent for the blue wren building a nest,    Then, down in the heart of you, learn what's best.\"  And there came to Sym as he walked afield    Deep thoughts of the world and the folk of Gosh. He saw the idols to which they kneeled;    He marked them cringe to the name of Splosli. Is it meet,\" he asked, \"that a soul should crawl    To a purple robe or a gilded chair?\" But his father walked to the garden's wall    And stooped to a rose-bush flowering there.  Said he: \"Whenever a bursting bloom Looks up to the sun, may a soul find room   For a measure of awe at the wondrous birth   Of one more treasure to this glad earth.\" Said he: \"Whenever a dewdrop clings To a gossamer thread, and glitters and swings,   Deep in humility bow your head   To a thing for a blundering rnortal's dread.\"  And there came to Sym in his later youth,   With the first clear glance in the face of guile, Thirst for knowledge and thoughts of truth,   Of gilded baubles, and things worth while. And he said, \"There is much that a Glug should know;   But his mind is clouded, his years are few.\" Then joi, the father, he answered low   As his thoughts ran back to the youth he knew.  Said he: \"Whenever the West wind stirs, And birds in feathers and beasts in furs   Steal out to dance in the glade, lie still:   Let your heart teach you what it will.\" Said he: \"Whenever the moonlight creeps Thro' inlaced boughs, a'nd a shy star peeps   Adown from its crib in the cradling sky,   Know of their folly who fear to die.\"  New interest came to the mind of Sym,   As 'midst his fellows he lived and toiled. But the ways of the Glug folk puzzled him;   For some won honour, while some were foiled; Yet all were filled with a vague unrest   As they climbed their trees in an endless search. But joi, the father, he mocked their quest,   When he marked a Glug on his hard-won perch.  Said he: \"Whenever these tales are heard Of the Feasible Dog or the Guffer Bird,   Then laugh and laugh till the fat tears roll   To the roots of the joy-bush deep in your soul. When you see them squat on the tree-tops high, Scanning for ever that heedless sky,   Lie flat on your back on the good, green earth   And roar till the great vault echoes your mirth.\"  As he walked in the city, to Sym there came   Sounds envenomed with fear and hate, Shouts of anger and words of shame,   As Glug blamed Glug for his woeful state. \"This blame?\" said Sym, \"Is it mortal's right   To blame his fellow for aught he be?\" But the father said, \"Do we blame the night   When darkness gathers and none can see?\"  Said he: \"Whenever there springs from earth A plant all crooked and marred at birth,    Shall we, unlearned in the Gardener's scheme,    Blame plant or earth for the faults that seem?\" Said he: \"Whenever your wondering eyes Look out on the glory of earth and skies,    Shall you, 'mid the blessing of fields a-bloom,    Fling blame at the blind man, prisoned in gloom?\"  So Joi had a son, and his name was Sym;    Far from the ken of the great King Splosh. And small was the Glugs' regard of him,    Mooning along in the streets of Gosh. But many a creature by field and ford    Shared in the schooling of that strange boy, Dreaming and planning to gather and hoard    Knowledge of all things precious to Joi.    V.  THE GROWTH OF SYM  Now Sym was a Glug; and 'tis"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16362"],["title","The Glugs of Gosh (#2)"],["body","so That the tale reads perfectly plain as we go.    In his veins ran blood of that stupid race    Of docile folk, who inhabit the place Called Gosh, sad Gosh, where the tall trees sigh With a strange, significant sort of cry When the gloaming creeps and the wind is high.  When the deep shades creep and the wind is high The trees bow low as the gods ride by:    Gods of the gloaming, who ride on the breeze,    Stooping to heaften the birds and the trees. But each dull Glug sits down by his door, And mutters, \" 'Tis windy!\" and nothing more, Like the long-dead Glugs in the days of yore.  When Sym was born there was much to-do, And his parents thought him a joy to view;    But folk not prejudiced saw the Glug,    As his nurse remarked, \"In the cut of his mug.\" For he had their hair, and he had their eyes, And the Glug expression of pained surprise, And their predilection for pumpkin pies.  And his parents' claims were a deal denied By his maiden aunt on his mother's side,    A tall Glug lady of fifty-two    With a slight moustache of an auburn hue. \"Parental blither!\" she said quite flat. \"He's an average Glug; and he's red and fat! And exceedingly fat and red at that!\"  But the father, joi, when he gazed on Sym, Dreamed great and wonderful things for him.    Said he, \"If the mind of a Glug could wake    Then, Oh, what a wonderful Glug he'd make! We shall teach this laddie to play life's game With a different mind and a definite aim: A Glug in appearance, yet not the same.\"  But the practical aunt said, \"Fudge!  You fool! We'll pack up his dinner and send him to school.    He shall learn about two-times and parsing and capes,    And how to make money with inches on tapes. We'll apprentice him then to the drapery trade, Where, I've heard it reported, large profits are made; Besides, he can sell us cheap buttons and braid.\"  So poor young Sym, he was sent to school, Where the first thing taught is the Golden Rule.    \"Do unto others,\" the teacher said . . .    Then suddenly stopped and scratched his head. \"You may look up the rest in a book,\" said he. \"At present it doesn't occur to me; But do it, whatever it happens to be.\"  \"And now,\" said the teacher, \"the day's task brings Consideration of practical things.    If a man makes a profit of fifteen pounds    On one week's takings from two milk rounds, How many . . .\" And Sym went dreaming away To the sunlit lands where the field-mice play, And wrens hold revel the livelong day.  He walked in the welcoming fields alone, While from far, far away came the pedagogue's drone:    \"If a man makes  . . .Multiply . . . Abstract nouns . . .    From B take   . . .Population of towns . . . Rods, poles or perches . . . Derived from Greek Oh, the hawthorn buds came out this week, And robins are nesting down by the creek.  So Sym was head of his class not once; And his aunt repeatedly dubbed him \"Dunce.\"    But, \"Give him a chance,\" said his father, Joi.    \"His head is abnormally large for a boy.\" But his aunt said, \"Piffie! It's crammed with bosh! Why, he don't know the rivers and mountains of Gosh, Nor the names of the nephews of good King Splosh!\"  In Gosh, when a youth gets an obstinate look, And copies his washing-bill into a book,    And blackens his boot-heels, and frowns at a joke,    \"Ah, he's getting sense,\" say the elderly folk. But Sym, he would laugh when he ought to be sad; Said his aunt, \"Lawk-a-mussy!  What's wrong with the lad?    He romps with the puppies, and talks to the ants,    And keeps his loose change in his second-best pants,    And stumbles all over my cauliflower plants!\"  \"There is wisdom in that,\" laughed the father, Joi. But the aunt said, \"Toity!\" and, \"Drat the boy!\"    \"He shall play,\" said the father, \"some noble part.    Who knows but it may be in letters or art? 'Tis a dignified business to make folk think.\" But the aunt cried, \"What!  Go messing with ink? And smear all his fingers, and take to drink? Paint hussies and cows, and end in the clink?\"  So the argument ran; but one bright Spring day Sym settled it all in his own strange way.    \"'Tis a tramp,\" he announced, \"I've decided to be;    And I start next Monday at twenty to three . . .\" When the aunt recovered she screamed, \"A tramp? A low-lived, pilfering, idle scamp, Who steals people's washing, and sleeps in the damp?\"  Sharp to the hour Sym was ready and dressed. \"Young birds,\" sighed the father, \"must go from the nest.    When the green moss covers those stones you tread,    When the green grass whispers above my head, Mark well, wherever your path may turn, They have reached the valley of peace who learn That wise hearts cherish what fools may spurn.\"  So Sym went off; and a year ran by, And the father said, with a smile-masked sigh,    \"It is meet that the young should leave the nest.\"    Said the aunt, \"Don't spill that soup on your vest! Nor mention his name! He's our one disgrace! And he's probably sneaking around some place With fuzzy black whiskers all over his face.\"  But, under a hedge, by a flowering peach, A youth with a little blue wren held speech.    With his back to a tree and his feet in the grass,    He watched the thistle-down drift and pass, And the cloud-puffs, borne on a lazy breeze, Move by on their errand, above the trees, Into the vault of the mysteries.  \"Now, teach me, little blue wren,\" said he. \"'Tis you can unravel this riddle for me.    I am 'mazed by the gifts of this kindly earth.    Which of them all has the greatest worth?\" He flirted his tail as he answered then, He bobbed and he bowed to his coy little hen: \"Why, sunlight and worms!\" said the little blue wren.    VI.  THE END OF JOI  They climbed the trees . . . As was told before, The Glugs climbed trees in the days of yore,    When the oldes tree in the land to-day    Was a tender little seedling--Nay, This climbing habit was old, so old That even the cheeses could not have told    When the past Glug people first began    To give their lives to the climbing plan.            And the legend ran    That the art was old as the mind of man.   And even the mountains old and hoar, And the billows that broke on Gosh's shore    Since the far-off neolithic night,    All knew the Glugs quite well by sight. And they tell of a perfectly easy way: For yesterday's Glug is the Glug of to-day.    And they climb the trees when the thunder rolls,    To solemnly salve their shop-worn souls.            For they fear the coals    That threaten to frizzle their shop-worn souls.   They climbed the trees. 'Tis a bootless task To say so over again, or ask    The cause of it all, or the reason why    They never felt happier up on high. For Joi asked why; and Joi was a fool, And never a Glug of the fine old school    With fixed opinions and Sunday clothes,    And the habit of looking beyond its nose,            And treating foes    With the calm contempt of the One Who Knows.   And every spider who heaves a line And trusts to his luck when the day is fine,    Or reckless swings from an awful height,    He knows the Glugs quite well by sight. \"You can never mistake them,\" he will say; \"For they always act in a Gluglike way.    And they climb the trees when the glass points fair,    With circumspection and proper care,            For they fear to tear    The very expensive clothes they wear.\"   But Joi was a Glug with a twisted mind Of the nasty, meditative kind.    He'd meditate on the modes of Gosh,    And dared to muse on the acts of Splosh; He dared to speak, and, worse than that, He spoke out loud, and he said it flat.    \"Why climb?\" said he.  \"When you reach the top    There's nowhere to go, and you have to stop,            Unless you drop.    And the higher you are the worse you flop.\"   And every cricket that chirps at eve, And scoffs at the folly of fools who grieve,    And the furtive mice who revel at night,    All know the Glugs quite well by sight. For, \"Why,\" they say, \" in the land of Gosh There is no one else who will bow to Splosh.    And they climb the trees when the rain pelts down    And feeds the gutters that thread the town;            For they fear to drown,    When floods are frothy and waters brown.\"   Said the Glug called Joi, \"This climbing trees Is a foolish art, and things like these    Cause much distress in the land of Gosh.    Let's stay on the ground and kill King Splosh!\" But Splosh, the king, he smiled a smile, And beckoned once to his hangman, Guile,    Who climbed a tree when the weather was calm;    And they hanged poor Joi on a Snufflebust Palm;            Then they sang a psalm,    Did those pious Glugs 'neath the Snufflebust Palm.   And every bee that kisses a flow'r, And every blossom, born for an hour,    And every bird on its gladsome flight,    All know the Glugs quite well by sight. For they say, \"'Tis a simple test we've got: If you know one Glug, why, you know the lot!\"    So, they climbed a tree in the bourgeoning Spring,    And they hanged poor Joi with some second-hand string.            'Tis a horrible thing    To be hanged by Glugs with second-hand string.   Then Splosh, the king, rose up and said, \"It's not polite; but he's safer dead.    And there's not much room in the land of Gosh    For a Glug named Joi and a king called Splosh!\" And every Glug flung high his hat, And cried, \"We're Glugs! and you can't change that!\"    So they climbed the trees, since the weather was cold,    While the brazen bell of the city tolled            And tolled, and told    The fate of a Glug who was over-bold.   And every cloud that sails the blue, And every dancing sunbeam too,    And every sparkling dewdrop bright    All know the Glugs quite well by sight. \"We tell,\" say they, \"by a simple test; For any old Glug is like the rest.    And they climb the trees when there's weather about,    In a general way, as a cure for gout;            Tho' some folks doubt    If the climbing habit is good for gout.\"   So Joi was hanged, and his race was run, And the Glugs were tickled with what"]]]
