William's socialism is all of the same brand.  His first display of affection for the tyrant lower down was due to the fact that he used him to overthrow a tyrant higher up: it was the socialist voter who broke the power of Bismarck.  When we see William embarking upon so many schemes of social reform all at once, we may be sure that he has no serious intention of carrying out any one of them.  After having made all sorts of lavish promises to the industrial workers, he is now busy giving undertakings to make the welfare of the peasantry his special care!  In his speech to the Reichstag there is no mention even of the one definite benefit that the workers had a right to expect--namely, a reduction of the hours of labour; but the threat of shooting \"them in the back\" reappears in a new guise.  William II warns the working classes of \"the dangers which they will incur in the event of their doing anything to disturb the order of government.\"  \"My august confederates and I,\" adds the Emperor, \"are determined to defend this order with unshakable energy.\"  Delicious to my way of thinking, this expression \"my august confederates.\"  Is there not something astounding about the use of the possessive pronoun in connection with the word \"august,\" implying sovereignty?  One wonders what part can they have to play, these confederates, led and dominated by a personality as jealous and self-centred as this \"young Emperor.\"  There is only one thing about which William II really concerns himself, over and above his blind passion for increasing the forces of Germany, and that is, other people's morals--the morals of working men or officers.  The devil has always had his days for playing the monk.    May 20, 1890. [5]  Do my readers remember my last article but one, written at a moment when the whole Press was singing the praises of William the Pacifist, on the eve of the day when _The Times_ published its despatch, proclaiming the complete agreement between Tzar and Kaiser, the _entente_ that assures the world of the peace that shall come down from William's starry heavens?  It was then that I wrote--  \"Is there a single reason to be found, either in the traditions of his race, or in his own character, or in the logic of Prussian militarism, which can justify, any clear-thinking mind in believing that William is a Pacifist?\"  Hardly had that number of May 1 appeared when the German Emperor made his speech at Königsberg!  In his cups, the King of Prussia reveals his true nature, just as a champagne cork flies from a badly wired bottle. After giving expression once again to his animosity towards France, he borrows from us one of the famous dicta of Monsieur Prudhomme--  \"The duty of an Emperor,\" he declared, \"is to keep the peace, and I am determined to do it; but should I be compelled to draw the sword to preserve peace, Germany's blows will fall like hail upon those who have dared to disturb it.\"  Next, in the neighbourhood of the Russian frontier, he used the following provocative language: \"I will not permit that any one should touch my eastern provinces and he who tries to do so, will find that my power and my might are as rocks of bronze.\"  Sire, beware!  The God of the Hohenzollern will prove to you before long that your power and your might, those rocks of bronze, are no more in His hands than a feather tossed in the wind; He will show you that a tricky horse can unseat you, regardless of your dignity, when you take your favourite ride, the road to Peacock island, with your august brother-in-law.  Say what you will, the Prussians have not yet acquired either wit or good taste!  There is proof of this not only in the speeches of William II at Konigsberg, but even more convincing, in that which was delivered before the Reichstag by that famous strategist, our conqueror de Moltke, on the subject of the proposed increase in the peace-footing effectives.  One must read the whole speech to get an idea of the sort of nonsense that \"honorable\" Germans are prepared to listen to.  In urging the vote of credit, \"the Victor\" said: \"Confronted with the fundamental problem of the army, the question of money is of secondary importance; for what becomes of your prosperous finances in war-time?\"  Having proved that conquerors are the greatest benefactors of the human race, M. de Moltke goes on to declare that it is not the rulers, but the peoples, who want war to-day.  In Germany, it is \"the cupidity of the classes whom fate has neglected\"; it is also the socialists who decline to vote more soldiers because they desire to trouble the world's peace and expect \"to sacrifice hundreds of thousands of lives in the next war and to threaten the existence of morality and civilisation.\"  I do not know whether my readers can make head or tail of this speech--I certainly cannot--but its intention is plain enough.  William II has been careful to emphasise it, by declaring that the increase in the peace strength of the army is intended to reinforce the eastern and western frontiers.  Several officious newspapers (we no longer call them reptile, but to do so would make them more authoritative) sum up the matter in these words--  \"The nearer the peace-footing of the troops on our frontiers approaches to war-strength, the more effectively these troops are provided with everything necessary to enable them to leave within _three hours_ of receiving marching orders, the more secure becomes Germany's position.\"  Quite so!  By next October there will be 200,000 men in Alsace-Lorraine.  As you see, the new law adds to the security of Germany precisely what it takes from ours.    June 12, 1890. [6]  My readers will recollect that after a journey in Switzerland, two years ago, I proved by statements which could not be (and never were) refuted, that the Russian Nihilists established in Switzerland before the Federal Government's inquiry, were all either deliberate or unconscious tools of the German police.  On the one hand, M. de Puttkamer, Minister of the Interior, unable to refute the evidence brought forward by the socialist deputy, Bebel, had then been compelled to confess that the socialist agitators Haupt and Schneider were his agents in Switzerland.  On the other hand, at the inquiry into the proceedings of these socialists, there was the evidence furnished by letters seized on Schmidt and Friedmann, associates of Haupt and Schneider, that Schmidt had been commissioned by M. Krüger of the Berlin Police to commit a crime.  In one of the seized letters, the following words were actually used by Krüger: \"The next attempt upon the life of the Emperor Alexander must be prepared at Geneva.  Write to me; I await your reports.\" [7]  Whenever the alleged liberalism of William II finds its expression in anything else but speeches, it is easy to take its measure.  He has just shown once more what it really amounts to, in the Treaty of Establishment with Switzerland, wherein restrictions are placed upon the issue of good moral character certificates by German parishes to their parishioners.  These will no longer be available to enable a German to take up his residence in Switzerland.  Henceforward it will be the business of the German Legation to pick and choose those whom it considers eligible to reside in Switzerland, either to practise a profession or to conduct an export business there.  It will be for Germany to decide whether or not her subjects are dangerous abroad. This would be well enough if it were only a question of restraining rogues, but it is anything but reassuring when we come to deal with the ever advancing phalanx of German spies.    July 9, 1890. [8]  It seems to me that this Wagnerian Emperor, pursuing his legends to the uttermost parts of the earth, is doing his utmost to darken our horizon.  Everywhere, always he confronts us, appearing on the scene to deprive us of the last remnants of good-will left to us in Europe.  In the Scandinavian States, even after 1870, we had preserved certain trusty friendships: of these William II now tries to rob us.  He appears and, to use his own expression, draws men to him by magic strings.  To the people who are offshoots of Germany he figures as \"the Emperor,\" unique, mysterious, he who goes forward in the name of the fables of mythology, gathering and uniting anew in his slumbering people the instincts of vassalage.  \"Super-German virtues,\" he calls them, \"ornaments of old-time Germany.\"  This monarch who, in his own land, is pleased to pose as a Liberal!  Can it be that this same William who, on the Bosphorus held communion with the stars, who, writing to Bismarck, said, \"I talk with God,\" finds the celestial responses so inadequate that his mind must needs invoke a retinue of Teutonic deities?  \"Let the Latins, Slavs and Gauls know it,\" says he, \"the German Emperor bears to Germans the glad tidings which promise them the sovereignty of the world!\"  Have not even the Anglo-Saxons bowed before the sovereign will of William II, so that before long the island of Heligoland will see the German flag floating over its rocky shores?  Yes, let her Press and public men say what they will, proud Albion has delivered herself over to Germany.  She has made surrender to our enemy in the hope that we shall thus become for her an easier victim, that she will be able to recover at our expense what Germany has taken from her.  Lord Salisbury hopes, in return for the plum he has yielded, to be able to help himself to ours, to those of Italy and Portugal, and to share others with Germany.  But such is the character of William II that he despises those who serve him or who yield to his will.  Like Don Juan, he seeks ever new worlds to conquer, new resistances to overcome, and neglects no means to secure his desired ends.  England and Austria to-day count for less than nothing in his schemes.

Animal fibres are not nearly so sensitive under these conditions. But whereas caustic alkalis have not much effect on vegetable fibres, if kept out of contact with the air, the animal fibres are very quickly attacked. Superheated steam alone has but little effect on cotton or vegetable fibres, but it would fuse or melt wool. Based on these differences, methods have been devised and patented for treating mixed woollen and cotton tissues--(1) with hydrochloric acid gas, or moistening with dilute hydrochloric acid and steaming, to remove all the cotton fibre; or (2) with a jet of superheated steam, under a pressure of 5 atmospheres (75 lb. per square inch), when the woollen fibre is simply melted out of the tissue, and sinks to the bottom of the vessel, a vegetable tissue remaining (Heddebault). If we write on paper with dilute sulphuric acid, and dry and then heat the place written upon, the cellulose is destroyed and charred, and we get black writing produced. The principle involved is the same as in the separation of cotton from mixed woollen and cotton goods by means of sulphuric acid or vitriol. The fabric containing cotton, or let us say cellulose particles, is treated with dilute vitriol, pressed or squeezed, and then roughly dried. That cellulose then becomes mere dust, and is simply beaten out of the intact woollen texture. The cellulose is, in a pure state, a white powder, of specific gravity 1·5, _i.e._ one and a half times as heavy as water, and is quite insoluble in such solvents as water, alcohol, ether; but it does dissolve in a solution of hydrated oxide of copper in ammonia. On adding acids to the cupric-ammonium solution, the cellulose is reprecipitated in the form of a gelatinous mass. Cotton and linen are scarcely dissolved at all by a solution of basic zinc chloride.  [Footnote 1: _J.S.C.I. = Journal of the Society of Chemical Industry._]  [Illustration: FIG. 1.]  [Illustration: FIG. 2.]  [Illustration: FIG. 3.]  [Illustration: FIG. 4.]  _Silk._--We now pass on to the animal fibres, and of these we must first consider silk. This is one of the most perfect substances for use in the textile arts. A silk fibre may be considered as a kind of rod of solidified flexible gum, secreted in and exuded from glands placed on the side of the body of the silk-worm. In Fig. 4 are shown the forms of the silk fibre, in which there are no central cavities or axial bores as in cotton and flax, and no signs of any cellular structure or external markings, but a comparatively smooth, glassy surface. There is, however, a longitudinal groove of more or less depth. The fibre is semi-transparent, the beautiful pearly lustre being due to the smoothness of the outer layer and its reflection of the light. In the silk fibre there are two distinct parts: first, the central portion, or, as we may regard it, the true fibre, chemically termed _fibroïn_; and secondly, an envelope composed of a substance or substances, chemically termed _sericin_, and often \"silk-glue\" or \"silk-gum.\" Both the latter and _fibroïn_ are composed of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen. Here there is thus one element more than in the vegetable fibres previously referred to, namely, nitrogen; and this nitrogen is contained in all the animal fibres. The outer envelope of silk-glue or sericin can be dissolved off the inner fibroïn fibre by means of hot water, or warm water with a little soap. Warm dilute (that is, weak) acids, such as sulphuric acid, etc., also dissolve this silk-glue, and can be used like soap solutions for ungumming silk. Dilute nitric acid only slightly attacks silk, and colours it yellow; it would not so colour vegetable fibres, and this forms a good test to distinguish silk from a vegetable fibre. Cold strong acetic acid, so-called glacial acetic acid, removes the yellowish colouring matter from raw silk without dissolving the sericin or silk-gum. By heating under pressure with acetic acid, however, silk is completely dissolved. Silk is also dissolved by strong sulphuric acid, forming a brown thick liquid. If we add water to this thick liquid, a clear solution is obtained, and then on adding tannic acid the fibroïn is precipitated. Strong caustic potash or soda dissolves silk; more easily if warm. Dilute caustic alkalis, if sufficiently dilute, will dissolve off the sericin and leave the inner fibre of fibroïn; but they are not so good for ungumming silk as soap solutions are, as the fibre after treatment with them is deficient in whiteness and brilliancy. Silk dissolves completely in hot basic zinc chloride solution, and also in an alkaline solution of copper and glycerin, which solutions do not dissolve vegetable fibres or wool. Chlorine and bleaching-powder solutions soon attack and destroy silk, and so another and milder agent, namely, sulphurous acid, is used to bleach this fibre. Silk is easily dyed by the aniline and coal-tar colours, and with beautiful effect, but it has little attraction for the mineral colours.  _Wool_.--Next to silk as an animal fibre we come to wool and different varieties of fur and hair covering certain classes of animals, such as sheep, goats, rabbits, and hares. Generally, and without going at all deeply into the subject, we may say that wool differs from fur and hair, of which we may regard it as a variety, by being usually more elastic, flexible, and curly, and because it possesses certain features of surface structure which confer upon it the property of being more easily matted together than fur and hair are. We must first shortly consider the manner of growth of hair without spending too much time on this part of the subject. The accompanying figure (see Fig. 5) shows a section of the skin with a hair or wool fibre rooted in it. Here we may see that the ground work, if we may so term it, is four-fold in structure. Proceeding downwards, we have--(first) the outer skin, scarf-skin or cuticle; (second) a second layer or skin called the _rete mucosum_, forming the epidermis; (third) papillary layer; (fourth) the corium layer, forming the dermis. The peculiar, globular, cellular masses below in the corium are called adipose cells, and these throw off perspiration or moisture, which is carried away to the surface by the glands shown (called sudoriparous glands), which, as is seen, pass independently off to the surface. Other glands terminate under the skin in the hair follicles, which follicles or hair sockets contain or enclose the hair roots. These glands terminating in the hair follicles secrete an oily substance, which bathes and lubricates as well as nourishes the hair. With respect to the origin of the hair or wool fibre, this is formed inside the follicle by the exuding therefrom of a plastic liquid or lymph; this latter gradually becomes granular, and is then formed into cells, which, as the growth proceeds, are elongated into fibres, which form the central portion of the hair. Just as with the trunk of a tree, we have an outer dense portion, the bark, an inner less dense and more cellular layer, and an inmost portion which is most cellular and porous; so with a hair, the central portion is loose and porous, the outer more and more dense. On glancing at the figure (Fig. 6) of the longitudinal section of a human hair, we see first the outer portion, like the bark of a tree, consisting of a dense sheath of flattened scales, then comes an inner lining of closely-packed fibrous cells, and frequently an inner well-marked central bundle of larger and rounder cells, forming a medullary axis. The transverse section (Fig. 7) shows this exceedingly well. The end of a hair is generally pointed, sometimes filamentous. The lower extremity is larger than the shaft, and terminates in a conical bulb, or mass of cells, which forms the root of the hair. In the next figure (Fig. 8) we are supposed to have separated these cells, and above, (a), we see some of the cells from the central pith or medulla, and fat globules; between, (b), some of the intermediate elongated or angular cells; and below, (c), two flattened, compressed, structureless, and horny scales from the outer portion of the hair. Now these latter flattened scales are of great importance. Their character and mode of connection with the stratum, or cortical substance, below, not only make all the difference between wool and hair, but also determine the extent and degree of that peculiar property of interlocking of the hairs known as felting. Let us now again look at a human hair. The light was reflected from this hair as it lay under the microscope, and now we see the reason of the saw-like edge in the longitudinal section, for just as the tiles lie on the roof of a house, or the scales on the back of a fish, so the whole surface of the hair is externally coated with a firmly adhering layer of flat overlying scales, with not very even upper edges, as you see. The upper or free edges of these scales are all directed towards the end of the hair, and away from the root. But when you look at a hair in its natural state you cannot see these scales, so flat do they lie on the hair-shaft. What you see are only irregular transverse lines across it. Now I come to a matter of great importance, as will later on appear in connection with means for promoting felting properties. If a hair such as described, with the scales lying flat on the shaft, be treated with certain substances or reagents which act upon and dissolve, or decompose or disintegrate its parts, then the free edges of these scales rise up, they \"set their backs up,\" so to say. They, in fact, stand off like the scales of a fir-cone, and at length act like the fir-cone in ripening, at last becoming entirely loose. As regards wool and fur, these scales are of the utmost importance, for very marked differences exist even in the wool of a single sheep, or the fur of a single hare. It is the duty of the wool-sorter to distinguish and separate the various"]]]
