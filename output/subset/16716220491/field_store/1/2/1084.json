Mary had a little lamb,     Its fleece was white as snow,   And everywhere that Mary went     The lamb was sure to go.    He followed her to school one day,     Which was against the rule.   It made the children laugh and play     To see a lamb at school.    And so the teacher put him out,     But still he lingered near,   And waited patiently about     Till Mary did appear.     MARY'S LAMB   Of course you know all about Mary and her little lamb.  The little girl in this story was named Mary, and she had a little lamb, too.  Mary was Boy Blue's cousin.  She lived in the city, and her father owned a big toy-store.  Mary liked to go to the store with him.  She liked to see all the dolls and toys and books.  Sometimes she played store with her own toys.  But I must tell you about her lamb.  One summer Mary went to the country to visit Boy Blue.  Of course there were cows, and pigs, and sheep, and lambs on the farm,  Mary liked the lambs best, and one of them was a great pet.  She called him Fleecy, and pulled sweet clover for him to eat.  Fleecy followed Mary all over the farm. Sometimes he even ran down the road after her.  When Mary was going home her uncle said to her, \"You may take Fleecy with you, if you wish.\"  So the next day Fleecy had a long ride in the train.  [Illustration]  I don't think he liked it very well, but he didn't say a word.  When Mary took him out of the box he was glad to run about in the yard.  He soon became used to his new home.  He liked to play with the children.  They often played hide and seek.  When they hid behind the trees he could always find them.     THE LAMB AT SCHOOL   One morning Fleecy could not find Mary.  He looked everywhere for her.  She was not in the yard, and she was not in the barn.  He went to the gate, and looked down the street, but he could not see her.  Then he went to the back door, and called, \"Baa-a, Baa-a!\" but she did not come.  Where could she be?  After a long time she came running into the yard.  Fleecy trotted up to her.  \"Baa-a, Baa-a!\" he said; which meant, I think, \"Where have you been, Mary?\"  \"I have been to school,\" said Mary.  You see she knew what he meant.  \"To school,\" thought Fleecy. \"I wonder what that is.\"  Everyday Mary went away and left him.  Did I say every day?  Once in a while she stayed at home.  Then Mary and the lamb played together in the yard.  \"Now,\" thought Fleecy, \"she is going to stay at home with me.\"  But no, on Monday Mary went away again.  At last Fleecy could bear it no longer.  \"I must go to school, too,\" he said.  \"I must see what Mary does all day.  \"If she goes to school to play games, I can play with her.\"  The next day Fleecy watched Mary go through the gate.  Then he followed her very quietly.  Mary ran along with the other little girls and boys.  They were playing tag and they did not see Fleecy.  Soon he heard a bell ring.  Then how the children ran!  They all ran into a little house and shut the door.  \"Oh!\" thought Fleecy, \"What shall I do? I can never open that door.\"  Just then he saw a little boy running very fast.  The boy ran up to the same little house.  He opened the door and went in, but he did not shut it.  Fleecy climbed up the steps.  He put his head in at the door and looked around.  He could see no one, so he walked in.  There was another door, and that was open, too.  Fleecy stood still and listened.  The children were singing as if they were very happy.  Then he put his head against the door and pushed it wide open.  What a room-full of children he saw!  And they were all sitting very still, and not playing at all.  \"I don't think I shall like school,\" thought Fleecy.  Just then the children saw him.  How they did laugh to see a lamb at school!  The moment Fleecy saw Mary he ran up to her.  [Illustration]  The children laughed and laughed.  The teacher laughed, too.  Of course the lamb could not stay in school all the morning.  The children could not work because they liked to watch him.  So Mary put him out and shut the door.  But Fleecy nibbled some sweet clover and waited for Mary.  When the children came out he trotted home with them.  After that day Fleecy often went to school with the children.  But he never went in again.  I think he liked clover better than books.       Little Bo-peep has lost her sheep,     And can't tell where to find them;   Leave them alone, and they'll come home,     And bring their tails behind them.    Little Bo-peep fell fast asleep,     And dreamed she heard them bleating;   But when she awoke she found it a joke,     For they were still a-fleeting.    Then up she took her little crook,     Determined for to find them;   She found them, indeed, but it made her heart bleed,     For they'd left their tails behind them.     LITTLE BO-PEEP   Alice is seven years old to-day.  She is going to have a birthday party.  Alice's aunt wrote the invitations, and Alice gave them to all her little school friends.  The invitation said:--  \"Little Bo-peep is to have a birthday party. She would like to have you come and help her take care of her sheep. Please come Friday afternoon after school.\"  Of course the children asked Alice about her party.  \"Are you little Bo-peep?\" they said.  \"Have you lost your sheep?  \"Are we going to help you find them?\"  \"No,\" said Alice, \"But my sheep have lost their tails, I think.  \"You'll know all about it on Friday.\"  At last it was Friday afternoon.  The children came to school all dressed for the party.  It was very hard to wait.  How slowly the clock ticked!  Two o'clock! Three o'clock! Four o'clock, at last!  The children ran almost all the way to Alice's house.  When they were all ready Alice put on a tall cap.  Then she took a long crook and stood in the middle of the floor.  As she called the names of the children they stood in a line behind her.  Then they began to march and sing:   \"Little Bo-peep has lost her sheep,     And can't tell where to find them;   Let them alone, and they'll come home,     And bring their tails behind them.\"  The children marched around the room, and through the hall into the dining-room.  There they saw a big green curtain, and there they found the sheep.  \"She found them, indeed, but it made her heart bleed, For they'd left their tails behind them.\"  Sure enough! There was a sheep on the curtain, but it had no tail.  There were some tails in a box on the table.  Bo-peep's mother gave one of them to each of the children.  \"Now,\" said Bo-peep, \"I will try first to pin a tail on the sheep.\"  So her mother tied a handkerchief over her eyes, turned her around three times, and said, \"Go.\"  Bo-peep started off bravely, and pinned the tail to her mother's apron!  How the children laughed! and Bo-peep laughed too, when she saw what she had done.  Boy Blue was sure he could pin a tail on the sheep.  But he pinned it right on the corner of the table cloth.  Then it was Mary's turn. She shut her eyes tight and walked very straight.  She was going to pin the tail in just the right place.  All the children stood still and watched her cross the room.  She pinned on the tail, and how they all shouted!  She had put it into the sheep's mouth.  But she did better than any one else.  So Bo-peep's mother gave her a little woolly lamb to take home to her baby brother.  All the children had a good time at the party.  They played games and ate ice-cream and cake and candy.  Then they sang songs, and Alice's mother told them some stories.  Last of all they sang \"Little Bo-peep\" again.  And to this day they call Alice \"Little Bo-peep.\"  [Illustration: \"All the children had a good time at the party.\"]       Hickory, dickory, dock!   The mouse ran up the clock.     The clock struck one     And down he run.   Hickory, dickory, dock!     HICKORY, DICKORY, DOCK   It was very quiet all over the house.  Little Boy Blue was fast asleep, dreaming of Santa Claus.  Boy Blue's father and mother were asleep, too, but I don't know what they were dreaming about.  \"Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.\"  Hark! Was that a mouse? Yes, I think it was.  Some one was awake after all.  Mr. and Mrs. Mouse lived in a hole in the pantry wall.  They were talking quite loud now.  \"Yes, we must move right away,\" Mrs. Mouse was saying.  \"This nest is not large enough for six.\"  \"That is true,\" said Mr. Mouse. \"I can't get my tail in now, and when the babies grow, it will be still worse.\"  \"But where shall we go?\" said Mrs. Mouse.  \"I will go house-hunting this very night, my dear.\"  \"Be sure you find a large house, where the cat can't find us.\"  \"Yes, indeed!\" said Mr. Mouse. Then he whisked through a little hole and went away.  \"Be careful, dear,\" called Mrs. Mouse, and she peeped through the hole and watched him out of sight.  Mr. Mouse ran across the kitchen floor into the dining-room.  It was very still!  Then he ran into the hall.  \"This is too far from the kitchen,\" he thought.  \"I am afraid the babies would have to go to bed hungry in here.\"  Then he went back into the dining-room.  \"This would be a good place for us,\" he thought.  He looked all around the room.  Where could he find a home?  It must be high up out of the reach of Pussy Cat, and big enough for Mrs. Mouse and her four babies.  What was that in the corner?  It was like a box, only very, very tall.  Mr. Mouse certainly did not know what it was, but I will tell you.  It was Boy Blue's grandfather's clock.  It had stood in that corner a long, long time, but Mr. Mouse had never seen it before.  \"I think I could make a good nest on top of that box,\" he thought.  \"Pussy Cat could not get up there, I know.\"  So Mr. Mouse began to run up the clock.  He heard it ticking very loudly.  \"Tick-tock! Tick-tock!\" it was saying.  \"I wonder what that noise is,\" he said to himself.  \"I hope it doesn't make that noise in the day-time.  \"It might keep the babies awake.\"  He climbed a little higher, looking this way and"]]]
