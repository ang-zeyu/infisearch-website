How perfectly it all chimed into the mood of St. Agnes' Eve! The opening door would bring a gust of lively sound from down the corridor, a swelling jingle of music, shouts from some humorous \"rough-house\" (probably those sophomores on the floor below)--            The boisterous, midnight, festive clarion           The kettle-drum, and far-heard clarionet           Affray his ears, though but in dying tone--           The hall-door shuts again, and all the noise is gone.  It did not take very long for J---- to work through the fifty pages of Keats reprinted in Professor Hidden Page's anthology; and then he, a lone and laughing faun among that pack of stern sophomores--so flewed, so sanded, out of the Spartan kind, crook-knee'd and dewlapped like Thessalian bulls--sped away into thickets of Landor, Tennyson, the Brownings. There I, an unprivileged and unsuspected hanger-on, lost their trail, returning to my own affairs. For some reason--I don't know just why--I never \"took\" that course in Nineteenth Century Poets, in the classroom at any rate. But just as Mr. Chesterton, in his glorious little book, \"The Victorian Age in Literature,\" asserts that the most important event in English history was the event that never happened at all (you yourself may look up his explanation) so perhaps the college course that meant most to me was the one I never attended. What it meant to those sophomores of the class of 1909 is another gentle speculation. Three years later, when I was a senior, and those sophomores had left college, another youth and myself were idly prowling about a dormitory corridor where some of those same sophomores had previously lodged. An unsuspected cupboard appeared to us, and rummaging in it we found a pile of books left there, forgotten, by a member of that class. It was a Saturday afternoon, and my companion and I had been wondering how we could raise enough cash to go to town for dinner and a little harmless revel. To shove those books into a suitcase and hasten to Philadelphia by trolley was the obvious caper; and Leary's famous old bookstore ransomed the volumes for enough money to provide an excellent dinner at Lauber's, where, in those days, the thirty-cent bottle of sour claret was considered the true, the blushful Hippocrene. But among the volumes was a copy of Professor Page's anthology which had been used by one of J----'s companions in that poetry course. This seemed to me too precious to part with, so I retained it; still have it; and have occasionally studied the former owner's marginal memoranda. At the head of The Eve of St. Agnes he wrote: \"Middle Ages. N. Italy. Guelph, Guibilline.\" At the beginning of Endymion he recorded: \"Keats tries to be spiritualized by love for celestials.\" Against Sleep and Poetry: \"Desultory. Genius in the larval state.\" The Ode on a Grecian Urn, he noted: \"Crystallized philosophy of idealism. Embalmed anticipation.\" The Ode on Melancholy: \"Non-Gothic. Not of intellect or disease. Emotions.\"  Darkling I listen to these faint echoes from a vanished lecture room, and ponder. Did J---- keep his copy of the book, I wonder, and did he annotate it with lively commentary of his own? He left college at the end of our second year, and I have not seen or heard from him these thirteen years. The last I knew--six years ago--he was a contractor in an Ohio city; and (is this not significant?) in a letter written then to another classmate, recalling some waggishness of our own sophomore days, he used the phrase \"Like Ruth among the alien corn.\"  In so far as one may see turning points in a tangle of yarn, or count dewdrops on a morning cobweb, I may say that a few evenings with my friend J---- were the decisive vibration that moved one more minor poet toward the privilege and penalty of Parnassus. One cannot nicely decipher such fragile causes and effects. It was a year later before the matter became serious enough to enforce abandoning library copies of Keats and buying an edition of my own. And this, too, may have been not unconnected with the gracious influence of the other sex as exhibited in a neighbouring athen√¶um; and was accompanied by a gruesome spate of florid lyrics: some (happily) secret, and some exposed with needless hardihood in a college magazine. The world, which has looked leniently upon many poetical minorities, regards such frenzies with tolerant charity and forgetfulness. But the wretch concerned may be pardoned for looking back in a mood of lingering enlargement. As Sir Philip Sidney put it, \"Self-love is better than any gilding to make that seem gorgeous wherein ourselves be parties.\"         *       *       *       *       *  There is a vast deal of nonsense written and uttered about poetry. In an age when verses are more noisily and fluently circulated than ever before, it might seem absurd to plead in the Muse's defence. Yet poetry and the things poets love are pitifully weak to-day. In essence, poetry is the love of life--not mere brutish tenacity of sensation, but a passion for all the honesties that make life free and generous and clean. For two thousand years poets have mocked and taunted the cruelties and follies of men, but to what purpose? Wordsworth said: \"In spite of difference of soil and climate, of language and manners, of laws and customs, in spite of things silently gone out of mind, and things violently destroyed, the Poet binds together by passion and knowledge the vast empire of human society, as it is spread over the whole earth, and over all time.\" Sometimes it seems as though \"things violently destroyed,\" and the people who destroy them, are too strong for the poets. Where, now, do we see any cohesive binding together of humanity? Are we nearer these things than when Wordsworth and Coleridge walked and talked on the Quantock Hills or on that immortal road \"between Porlock and Linton\"? Hardy writes \"The Dynasts,\" Joseph Conrad writes his great preface to \"The Nigger of the _Narcissus_,\" but do the destroyers hear them? Have you read again, since the War, Gulliver's \"Voyage to the Houyhnhnms,\" or Herman Melville's \"Moby Dick\"? These men wrote, whether in verse or prose, in the true spirit of poets; and Swift's satire, which the text-book writers all tell you is so gross and savage as to suggest the author's approaching madness, seems tender and suave by comparison with what we know to-day.  Poetry is the log of man's fugitive castaway soul upon a doomed and derelict planet. The minds of all men plod the same rough roads of sense; and in spite of much knavery, all win at times \"an ampler ether, a diviner air.\" The great poets, our masters, speak out of that clean freshness of perception. We hear their voices--       I there before thee, in the country that well thou knowest,      Already arrived am inhaling the odorous air.  So it is not vain, perhaps, to try clumsily to tell how this delicious uneasiness first captured the spirit of one who, if not a poet, is at least a lover of poetry. Thus he first looked beyond the sunset; stood, if not on Parnassus, tiptoe upon a little hill. And overhead a great wind was blowing.         [Illustration]    THE OLD RELIABLE   \"Express train stalled in a snowdrift,\" said one. \"The irascible old white-haired gentleman in the Pullman smoker; the good-natured travelling salesman; the wistful young widow in the day coach, with her six-year-old blue-eyed little daughter. A coal-black Pullman porter who braves the shrieking gale to bring in a tree from the copse along the track. Red-headed brakeman (kiddies of his own at home), frostbitten by standing all night between the couplings, holding parts of broken steampipe together so the Pullman car will keep warm. Young widow and her child, of course, sleeping in the Pullman; white-haired old gentleman vacates his berth in their favour. Good-natured travelling salesman up all night, making cigar-band decorations for the Tree, which is all ready in the dining car in the morning----\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"Old English inn on a desolate moor,\" said another. \"Bright fire of coals in the coffee room, sporting prints, yellow old newspaper cutting framed on the mantelpiece describing gruesome murder committed in the house in 1760.

Pretty chambermaid in evident anxiety about something; guest tries to kiss her in the corridor; she's too distrait to give the matter proper attention. She has heard faint agonized cries above the howling of the gale----\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"I like the sound of hymns,\" ventured a third. \"Frosty vestibule of fashionable church, rolling thunders of the organ, fringes of icicles silvered by moonlight, poor old Salvation Army Santa Claus shivering outside and tinkling his pathetic little bell.

One train had taken the girls southward to Santa Barbara, and another had taken the boys eastward to Denver and to Chicago. At the latter city the lads had made a quick change, and twenty-six hours later found them at Oak Run, and in the carriage for the farm.     CHAPTER II  NEWS OF INTEREST   \"My boys! my boys!\"  Such was the cry given by Anderson Rover, when he caught sight of the occupants of the carriage, as the turnout swept up to the piazza of the comfortable farm home.     \"Home again! Home again    Safe from a foreign shore!\"  sang out Tom, and leaping to the ground, he caught his father around the shoulders. \"Aren't you glad to see us, father?\" he went on.  \"Glad doesn't express it, Tom,\" replied the fond parent, as he embraced first one and then another. \"My heart is overflowing with joy, and I thank God that you have returned unharmed, after having passed through so many grave perils. How brown all of you look!\"  \"Tanned by the tropical sun,\" answered Sam. \"Oh, here is Aunt Martha, and Uncle Randolph!\"  \"Sam!\" burst out the motherly aunt, as she kissed him. \"Oh, how you must have suffered on that lonely island!\" And then she kissed the others.  \"We've certainly had our fill of adventures,\" came from Dick, who was shaking hands with his Uncle Randolph. \"And more than once we thought we should never see Valley Brook farm again.\"  \"We were real Robinson Crusoes,\" went on Sam. \"And the girls were Robinson Crusoes, too.\"  \"Are the girls well?\" questioned Mrs. Rover.  \"Very well, auntie. If they hadn't been we shouldn't have parted with them in San Francisco. They went back to Santa Barbara to finish their vacation.\"  \"I see. Well, it certainly was a wonderful trip. You'll have to tell us all the particulars this evening. I suppose you are as hungry as bears just now. Tom is, I'm sure.\"  \"Oh, Aunt Martha, I see you haven't forgotten my failing,\" piped in the youth mentioned, with a twinkle in his eye. \"And do I get pie for dinner?\"  \"Yes, Tom, and all you care to eat, too. We are going to make your home-coming a holiday.\"  \"Good!\"  They were soon in the house, every nook and corner of which was so familiar to them. They rushed up to their rooms, and, after a brushing and a washing up, came down to the big dining room, where the table fairly groaned with good things.  \"Gosh! this is a regular Christmas spread!\" observed Tom, as he looked the table over. \"Tell you what, Aunt Martha, I'm going to be cast away every week after this.\"  \"Oh, Tom, don't speak of it! After this you must stay right here. Neither your father nor your uncle nor myself will want to leave you out of sight.\"  \"Pooh! We can't stay home. But we'll be careful of our trips in the future, you can be sure of that.\"  \"Have you heard anything about Putnam Hall since we went away?\" asked Dick, during the meal.  \"The academy opened again last week, Dick,\" answered his father. \"We received a circular letter from Captain Putnam. The scarlet fever scare did not amount to much, for which the captain is very thankful.\"  \"I sent him a telegram, stating we were safe,\" said Sam. \"I knew he would like to hear from us. The captain is a brick.\"  \"The best ever,\" said Tom, with his mouth full of chicken.  \"And ditto, Mr. Strong,\" put in Dick, referring to the head assistant at the Hall.  \"Exactly, Dick. But no more Jasper Grinders in mine,\" went on Tom, referring to a tyrannical teacher who had caused them much trouble, and who had been discharged from the academy, as already mentioned in \"The Rover Boys in the Mountains.\"  \"Or Josiah Crabtrees,\" said Dick, referring to another teacher, who had been made to leave Putnam Hall, and who had wanted to marry the widow Stanhope, in an endeavor to get control of the money that was coming to Dora. Crabtree's misdeeds had landed him in prison, where he was likely to stay for some time to come.  While the meal was still in progress the boys began the recital of their many adventures, and this recital was kept up until a late hour. It was astonishing how much they had to tell, and how interesting it proved to the listeners.  \"You might make a book of it,\" said Anderson Rover. \"It equals our adventures in the jungles of Africa.\"  \"I am going to write it out some day,\" answered Dick. \"And, maybe, I'll get the story printed. The trouble is, I can't end the tale properly.\"  \"How is that, Dick?\" asked his Uncle Randolph. \"You were all saved. Isn't that a proper ending for any book?\"  \"Yes, but what of the villain? Baxter didn't show himself, and that is no ending at all. He should have fallen over a cliff, or been shot, or something like that.\"  \"And we should have married the three girls,\" put in fun-loving Tom. \"That would make the story even more complete.\"  \"Well, things do not happen in real life as they do in story books,\" said the parent. \"It is likely you will never hear of Dan Baxter again. But we may hear from his father.\"  \"His father!\" exclaimed the three youths in concert.  \"Why, Arnold Baxter is in prison,\" added Sam.  \"He was, up to five days ago, when they took him to the hospital to undergo some sort of an operation. At the hospital the operation was postponed for a day, and during the night he slipped away from the institution and disappeared.\"  \"Well, I never!\" burst out Dick. \"Isn't he the slick one, though! Just when you think you've got him hard and fast, you haven't at all.\"  \"Haven't they any trace of him?\" asked Sam.  \"None, so far as I have heard. There was a report that he had gone to New York and taken passage on a ship bound for Liverpool, but at present the ship is on the Atlantic, so the authorities can do nothing.\"  \"I hope they catch him.\"  \"We all hope that, Sam.\"  For a few days the three boys did nothing but take it easy. It was pleasant weather, and they roamed around the farm in company with their father and their uncle, or with Alexander Pop, the colored man of work. As my old readers know, Pop had been in former days a waiter at Putnam Hall, and Dick, Tom, and Sam had befriended him on more than one occasion, for which he was extremely grateful.  \"Yo' boys is jes' naturally fust-class heroes,\" said Aleck one day. \"Even if dem cannonballs had cum after yo', I don't t'ink da could have cotched yo', no, sirree!\"  \"It's a pity you weren't along, Aleck,\" answered Tom.  \"I can't say as to dat, Master Tom. I got 'bout all de hair-raisin' times I wanted when we was in de jungles ob Africy. I'se only sorry ob one t'ing.\"  \"And what is that?\"  \"Dat you didn't jes' go an' frow dat Dan Baxter overboard from dat ship de fust time yo' sot eyes on him. Suah as yo' am born he'll turn up some day to make moah trouble.\"  \"Well, if he turns up we'll be ready for him,\" returned Tom grimly.  \"How can yo' be ready fo' a pusson wot acts like a snake in de grass? He'll sting befo' yo' hab de chance to spot him.\"  \"We'll have to keep our eyes open, Aleck,\" answered the youth; and then the subject was changed.  During those days the boys went fishing and bathing in the river, and also visited Humpback Falls, that spot where Sam had had such a thrilling adventure, as related in \"The Rover Boys at School.\"  \"What a lot has happened since those days,\" said Sam, taking a deep breath. \"Tom, do you remember how you got into trouble with old Crabtree the very first day we landed at Putnam Hall?\"  \"I do, Sam; and do you remember our first meeting, on the boat, with Dan Baxter, and how we sent him about his business when he tried to annoy Nellie, and Grace, and Dora?\"  \"Yes, indeed. Say, I am getting anxious to get back to the Hall. It seems almost like a second home.\"  \"So am I,\" put in Dick. \"Besides, we have lost time enough from our studies. We'll have to pitch in, or we'll drop behind our classes.\"  \"Father says we can return to the Hall next Monday, if we wish.\"  \"I vote we do so.\"  \"So do I.\"  And thus it was decided that they should return to the academy four days later.  But during those four days something was to happen which would have an important bearing upon their future actions.     CHAPTER III  A MIDNIGHT VISITOR   The next day, shortly after noon, it began to rain, and the storm increased in violence until the wind blew almost a gale.  The rain kept the boys indoors, at which Tom was inclined to grumble.  \"No use of grumbling, Tom,\" said Dick cheerfully. \"Let us improve the time by looking over our school books. That will make it easier to slip into the grind again when we get back to the Hall.\"  \"That is excellent advice, Richard,\" said Randolph Rover. \"Whatever you do, do not neglect your studies.\"  \"By the way, Uncle Randolph, how is scientific farming progressing?\" said Tom, referring to something that had been his uncle's hobby for years--a hobby that had cost the gentleman considerable money.  \"Well--ah--to tell the truth, Thomas, not as well as I had hoped for.\"  \"Hope you didn't drop a thousand or two this year, uncle?\"  \"Oh, no--not over fifty dollars.\"  \"Then you got off easy.\"  \"I shall do better next year. The potatoes already show signs of improvement.\"  \"Good! I suppose you'll be growing 'em on top of the ground soon. Then you won't have the bother of digging 'em, you know,\" went on the fun-loving boy innocently.  \"Absurd, Thomas! But I shall have some very large varieties, I feel certain.\"  \"Big as a watermelon?\"  \"Hardly, but--\"  \"Big as a muskmelon, then?\"  \"Not exactly, but--\"  \"About the size of a cocoanut, eh?\"  \"No! no! They will be as large as--\"  \"I mean a little cocoanut,\" pleaded Tom, while Sam felt like laughing outright.  \"Well, yes, a little cocoanut. You see--\"  \"We saw some big potatoes in"]]]
