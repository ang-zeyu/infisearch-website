'Shall I guess the object?--Is it not Diomed's daughter?  She adores you, and does not affect to conceal it; and, by Hercules, I say again and again, she is both handsome and rich.  She will bind the door-posts of her husband with golden fillets.'  'No, I do not desire to sell myself.  Diomed's daughter is handsome, I grant: and at one time, had she not been the grandchild of a freedman, I might have...  Yet no--she carries all her beauty in her face; her manners are not maiden-like, and her mind knows no culture save that of pleasure.'  'You are ungrateful.  Tell me, then, who is the fortunate virgin?'  'You shall hear, my Clodius.  Several months ago I was sojourning at Neapolis, a city utterly to my own heart, for it still retains the manners and stamp of its Grecian origin--and it yet merits the name of Parthenope, from its delicious air and its beautiful shores. One day I entered the temple of Minerva, to offer up my prayers, not for myself more than for the city on which Pallas smiles no longer. The temple was empty and deserted. The recollections of Athens crowded fast and meltingly upon me: imagining myself still alone in the temple, and absorbed in the earnestness of my devotion, my prayer gushed from my heart to my lips, and I wept as I prayed. I was startled in the midst of my devotions, however, by a deep sigh; I turned suddenly round, and just behind me was a female.  She had raised her veil also in prayer: and when our eyes met, methought a celestial ray shot from those dark and smiling orbs at once into my soul.  Never, my Clodius, have I seen mortal face more exquisitely molded: a certain melancholy softened and yet elevated its expression: that unutterable something, which springs from the soul, and which our sculptors have imparted to the aspect of Psyche, gave her beauty I know not what of divine and noble; tears were rolling down her eyes.  I guessed at once that she was also of Athenian lineage; and that in my prayer for Athens her heart had responded to mine. I spoke to her, though with a faltering voice--\"Art thou not, too, Athenian?\" said I, \"O beautiful virgin!\" At the sound of my voice she blushed, and half drew her veil across her face.--\"My forefathers' ashes,\" said she, \"repose by the waters of Ilissus: my birth is of Neapolis; but my heart, as my lineage, is Athenian.\"--\"Let us, then,\" said I, \"make our offerings together\": and, as the priest now appeared, we stood side by side, while we followed the priest in his ceremonial prayer; together we touched the knees of the goddess--together we laid our olive garlands on the altar. I felt a strange emotion of almost sacred tenderness at this companionship. We, strangers from a far and fallen land, stood together and alone in that temple of our country's deity: was it not natural that my heart should yearn to my countrywoman, for so I might surely call her?  I felt as if I had known her for years; and that simple rite seemed, as by a miracle, to operate on the sympathies and ties of time.  Silently we left the temple, and I was about to ask her where she dwelt, and if I might be permitted to visit her, when a youth, in whose features there was some kindred resemblance to her own, and who stood upon the steps of the fane, took her by the hand.  She turned round and bade me farewell.  The crowd separated us: I saw her no more.  On reaching my home I found letters, which obliged me to set out for Athens, for my relations threatened me with litigation concerning my inheritance. When that suit was happily over, I repaired once more to Neapolis; I instituted inquiries throughout the whole city, I could discover no clue of my lost countrywoman, and, hoping to lose in gaiety all remembrance of that beautiful apparition, I hastened to plunge myself amidst the luxuries of Pompeii.  This is all my history. I do not love; but I remember and regret.'  As Clodius was about to reply, a slow and stately step approached them, and at the sound it made amongst the pebbles, each turned, and each recognized the new-comer.  It was a man who had scarcely reached his fortieth year, of tall stature, and of a thin but nervous and sinewy frame.  His skin, dark and bronzed, betrayed his Eastern origin; and his features had something Greek in their outline (especially in the chin, the lip, and the brow), save that the nose was somewhat raised and aquiline; and the bones, hard and visible, forbade that fleshy and waving contour which on the Grecian physiognomy preserved even in manhood the round and beautiful curves of youth.  His eyes, large and black as the deepest night, shone with no varying and uncertain lustre. A deep, thoughtful, and half-melancholy calm seemed unalterably fixed in their majestic and commanding gaze. His step and mien were peculiarly sedate and lofty, and something foreign in the fashion and the sober hues of his sweeping garments added to the impressive effect of his quiet countenance and stately form. Each of the young men, in saluting the new-comer, made mechanically, and with care to conceal it from him, a slight gesture or sign with their fingers; for Arbaces, the Egyptian, was supposed to possess the fatal gift of the evil eye.  'The scene must, indeed, be beautiful,' said Arbaces, with a cold though courteous smile, 'which draws the gay Clodius, and Glaucus the all admired, from the crowded thoroughfares of the city.'  'Is Nature ordinarily so unattractive?' asked the Greek.  'To the dissipated--yes.'  'An austere reply, but scarcely a wise one.  Pleasure delights in contrasts; it is from dissipation that we learn to enjoy solitude, and from solitude dissipation.'  'So think the young philosophers of the Garden,' replied the Egyptian; 'they mistake lassitude for meditation, and imagine that, because they are sated with others, they know the delight of loneliness.  But not in such jaded bosoms can Nature awaken that enthusiasm which alone draws from her chaste reserve all her unspeakable beauty: she demands from you, not the exhaustion of passion, but all that fervor, from which you only seek, in adoring her, a release.  When, young Athenian, the moon revealed herself in visions of light to Endymion, it was after a day passed, not amongst the feverish haunts of men, but on the still mountains and in the solitary valleys of the hunter.'  'Beautiful simile!' cried Glaucus; 'most unjust application! Exhaustion! that word is for age, not youth.  By me, at least, one moment of satiety has never been known!'  Again the Egyptian smiled, but his smile was cold and blighting, and even the unimaginative Clodius froze beneath its light.  He did not, however, reply to the passionate exclamation of Glaucus; but, after a pause, he said, in a soft and melancholy voice:  'After all, you do right to enjoy the hour while it smiles for you; the rose soon withers, the perfume soon exhales.  And we, O Glaucus! strangers in the land and far from our fathers' ashes, what is there left for us but pleasure or regret!--for you the first, perhaps for me the last.'  The bright eyes of the Greek were suddenly suffused with tears. 'Ah, speak not, Arbaces,' he cried--'speak not of our ancestors.  Let us forget that there were ever other liberties than those of Rome!  And Glory!--oh, vainly would we call her ghost from the fields of Marathon and Thermopylae!'  'Thy heart rebukes thee while thou speakest,' said the Egyptian; 'and in thy gaieties this night, thou wilt be more mindful of Leoena than of Lais. Vale!'  Thus saying, he gathered his robe around him, and slowly swept away.  'I breathe more freely,' said Clodius.  'Imitating the Egyptians, we sometimes introduce a skeleton at our feasts.  In truth, the presence of such an Egyptian as yon gliding shadow were spectre enough to sour the richest grape of the Falernian.'  'Strange man! said Glaucus, musingly; 'yet dead though he seem to pleasure, and cold to the objects of the world, scandal belies him, or his house and his heart could tell a different tale.'  'Ah! there are whispers of other orgies than those of Osiris in his gloomy mansion.  He is rich, too, they say.  Can we not get him amongst us, and teach him the charms of dice?  Pleasure of pleasures! hot fever of hope and fear! inexpressible unjaded passion! how fiercely beautiful thou art, O Gaming!'  'Inspired--inspired!' cried Glaucus, laughing; 'the oracle speaks poetry in Clodius.  What miracle next!'    Chapter III  PARENTAGE OF GLAUCUS.  DESCRIPTION OF THE HOUSES OF POMPEII. CLASSIC REVEL.  HEAVEN had given to Glaucus every blessing but one: it had given him beauty, health, fortune, genius, illustrious descent, a heart of fire, a mind of poetry; but it had denied him the heritage of freedom. He was born in Athens, the subject of Rome.  Succeeding early to an ample inheritance, he had indulged that inclination for travel so natural to the young, and had drunk deep of the intoxicating draught of pleasure amidst the gorgeous luxuries of the imperial court.  He was an Alcibiades without ambition.  He was what a man of imagination, youth, fortune, and talents, readily becomes when you deprive him of the inspiration of glory.  His house at Rome was the theme of the debauchees, but also of the lovers of art; and the sculptors of Greece delighted to task their skill in adorning the porticoes and exedrae of an Athenian.  His retreat in Pompeii--alas! the colors are faded now, the walls stripped of their paintings!--its main beauty, its elaborate finish of grace and ornament, is gone; yet when first given once more to the day, what eulogies, what wonder, did its minute and glowing decorations create--its paintings--its mosaics! Passionately enamoured of poetry and the drama, which recalled to Glaucus the wit and the heroism of his race, that fairy mansion was adorned with representations of AEschylus and Homer.  And antiquaries, who resolve taste to a trade, have turned the patron to the professor, and still (though"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15651"],["title","His Grace of Osmonde (#1)"],["body","ks, and that his Majesty tires of her, and looks already toward other quarters.\" And so they sat over their ale and gossiped, they being supplied with anecdote by his Grace's gentleman's gentleman, who was fond of Court life and found the country tiresome, and whose habit it was to spend an occasional evening at the Plough Horse for the pleasure of having even an audience of yokels; liking it the better since, being yokels, they would listen open-mouthed and staring by the hour to his swagger and stories of Whitehall and Hampton Court, and the many beauties who surrounded the sacred person of his most gracious Majesty, King Charles the Second. Every yokel in the country had heard rumours of these ladies, but Mr. Mount gave those at Camylott village details which were often true and always picturesque.  \"What could be expected,\" he would say, \"of a man who had lived in gay exile through his first years, and then of a sudden was made a King, and had all the beauties of England kneeling before him--and he with a squat, black, long-toothed Portugee fastened to him for a wife? And Mistress Barbara Palmer at him from his first landing on English soil to be restored--she that was made my Lady Castlemaine.\"  And then he would relate stories of this beauteous fury, and her tempestuous quarrels with the King, and of how 'twas known his ease and pleasure-loving nature stood in terror of her violence and gave way before it with bribes and promises through sheer weariness.  \"'Tis not that he loves her best,\" said Mr. Mount, snuff-taking in graceful Court fashion, \"for he hath loved a dozen since; but she is a shrew, and can rave and bluster at him till he would hang her with jewels, and give her his crown itself to quieten her furies. 'Tis the pretty orange wench and actor woman Nell Gwynne who will please him longest, for she is a good-humoured baggage and witty, and gives him rest.\"  'Twas not alone Charles who was pleased with Nell Gwynne. All England liked her, and the lower orders best of all, because she was merry and kind of heart and her jokes and open-handedness pleased them. They were deep in the midst of a story of a poor gentleman in orders whom she had rescued from the debtors' prison, when old Rowe, who had been watching the road leading from the park gates, pricked up his ears and left his seat, trembling with excitement.  \"'Tis a horse galloping,\" he cried; and as they all turned to look he flung his cap in the air. \"'Tis the messenger,\" he burst forth, \"and he waves his hat in his hand as if he had gone mad with joy. Off go I to the church tower as fast as legs will carry me.\"  And off he hobbled, and the messenger galloped onward, flourishing his hat as he rode, and giving it no rest till he drew rein before the Plough Horse door, and all gathered about him to hear his news.  \"An heir--an heir!\" he cried. \"'Tis an heir, and as lusty as a young lion. Gerald Walter John Percy Mertoun, next Duke of Osmonde! Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah!\"  And at the words all the men shouted and flung up their hats, the landlord with his wife and children ran forth, women rushed out of their cottages and cried for joy--and the bells in the old church's grey tower swung and rang such a peal of gladness as sounded as if they had gone wild in their ecstacy of welcome to the new-born thing.  In all England there was no nobleman's estate adorned by a house more beautiful than was the Tower of Camylott. Through the centuries in which it had stood upon the fair hill which was its site, there had passed no reign in which a king or queen had not been guest there, and no pair of royal eyes had looked from its window quite without envy, upon the richly timbered, far reaching park and the broad lovely land rolling away to the sea. There was no palace with such lands spread before it, and there were few kings' houses as stately and beauteous in their proportions as was this one.  The fairest room in the fair house had ever been the one known as her Grace's White Chamber. 'Twas a spacious room with white panelled walls and large mullioned windows looking forth over green hill and vale and purple woodland melting into the blue horizon. The ivy grew thick about the windows, and birds nested therein and twittered tenderly in their little homes. The Duchess greatly loved the sound, as she did the fragrance of flowers with which the air of the White Chamber was ever sweet, and which was wafted up to it by each wandering breeze from the flower-beds blooming on the terrace below.  In this room--as the bells in the church tower rang their joyous peal--her young Grace lay in her great bed, her new-born child on her arm and her lord seated close to her pillow, holding her little hand to his lips, his lashes somewhat moist as he hung over his treasures.  \"You scarce can believe that he is here,\" the Duchess whispered with a touching softness. \"Indeed, I scarce believe it myself. 'Twas not fair of him to keep us waiting five years when we so greatly yearned for his coming. Perhaps he waited, knowing that we expected so much from him--such beauty and such wisdom and such strength. Let us look at him together, love. The physician will order you away from me soon, but let us see first how handsome he is.\"  She thrust the covering aside and the two heads--one golden and one brown--pressed closer together that they might the better behold the infant charms which were such joy to them.  \"I would not let them bind his little limbs and head as is their way,\" she said. \"From the first hour I spoke with his chief nurse, I gave her my command that he should be left free to grow and to kick his pretty legs as soon as he was strong enough. See, John, he stirs them a little now. They say he is of wondrous size and long and finely made, and indeed he seems so to me--and 'tis not only because I am so proud, is it?\"  \"I know but little of their looks when they are so young, sweet,\" her lord answered, his voice and eyes as tender as her own; for in sooth he felt himself moved as he had been at no other hour in his life before, though he was a man of a nature as gentle as 'twas strong. \"I will own that I had ever thought of them as strange, unbeauteous red things a man almost held in fear, and whose ugliness a woman but loved because she was near angel; but this one--\" and he drew nearer still with a grave countenance--\"surely it looks not like the rest. 'Tis not so red and crumple-visaged--its tiny face hath a sort of comeliness. It hath a broad brow, and its eyes will sure be large and well set.\"  The Duchess slipped her fair arm about his neck--he was so near to her 'twas easy done--and her smile trembled into sweet tears which were half laughter.  \"Ah, we love him so,\" she cried, \"how could we think him like any other? We love him so and are so happy and so proud.\"  And for a moment they remained silent, their cheeks pressed together, the scent of the spring flowers wafting up to them from the terrace, the church bells pealing out through the radiant air.  \"He was born of love,\" his mother whispered at last. \"He will live amid love and see only honour and nobleness.\"  \"He will grow to be a noble gentleman,\" said my lord Duke. \"And some day he will love a noble lady, and they will be as we have been--as we have been, beloved.\"  And their faces turned towards each other as if some law of nature drew them, and their lips met--and their child stirred softly in its first sleep.     _CHAPTER II_  \"_He is the King_\"   The bells pealed at intervals throughout the day in at least five villages over which his Grace of Osmonde was lord--at Roxholm they pealed, at Marlowell Dane, at Paulyn Dorlocke, at Mertounhurst, at Camylott--and in each place, when night fell, bonfires were lighted and oxen roasted whole, while there were dancing and fiddling and drinking of ale on each village green.  In truth, as Dame Watt had said, he had begun well--Gerald Walter John Percy Mertoun, Marquess of Roxholm; and well it seemed he would go on. He throve in such a way as was a wonder to his physicians and nurses, the first gentlemen finding themselves with no occasion for practising their skill, since he suffered from no infant ailments whatsoever, but fed and slept and grew lustier and fairer every hour. He grew so finely--perhaps because his young mother had defied ancient custom and forbidden his limbs and body to be bound--that at three months he was as big and strong as an infant of half a year. 'Twas plain he was built for a tall man with broad shoulders and noble head. But a few months had passed before his baby features modelled themselves into promise of marked beauty, and his brown eyes gazed back at human beings, not with infant vagueness, but with a look which had in it somewhat of question and reply. His retinue of serving-women were filled with such ardent pride in him that his chief nurse had much to do to keep the peace among them, each wishing to be first with him, and being jealous of another who made him laugh and crow and stretch forth his arms that she might take him. The Commandress-in-Chief of the nurses was no ordinary female. She was the widow of a poor chaplain--her name Mistress Rebecca Halsell--and she gratefully rejoiced to have had the happiness to fall into a place of such honour and responsibility. She was of sober age, and being motherly as well as discreet, kept such faithful watch over him as few children begin life under.  The figure of this good woman throughout his childhood stood out from among all others surrounding him, with singular distinctness. She seemed not like a servant, nor was she like any other in the household. As he ripened in years, he realised that in his earliest memories of her there was a recollection of a certain grave respect she had seemed to pay him, and he saw it had been not mere deference but respect, as though he had been a man in miniature, and one to whom, despite his tender youth, dignity and reason should be qualities of nature,"]]]
