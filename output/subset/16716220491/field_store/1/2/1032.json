Just let me read you this description, and you will see how exactly it agrees with Mr. Frog himself. Look, mamma, look!\" and Fred opened his hand and showed a small green frog.  \"Stand still, and be quiet, Rikli,\" said her mother to the crying girl, \"and, Fred, why do you persist in showing the silly child these creatures, when you know how much she is afraid of them?\"  \"She was the only person near,\" answered Fred. \"But do listen to this, mamma.\" Fred opened his book, and began to read:--  \"'The green or water frog, _esculenta_, is about three inches in length, grass-green, with black spots. His eyes have a golden color, and the toes of his hind legs are webbed. His voice, which is often heard on warm summer nights, sounds _Brekekex!_ He passes the winters hidden in the mud and slime. He feeds upon'--\"  At this moment a carriage was heard approaching. \"It is the lady with the sick child,\" said Mrs. Stein, putting Fred aside rather hastily, for he tried to detain her. He followed her, crying out:--  \"Do listen, mamma; you do not know what he eats. He eats--\"  The carriage was at the door. Hans came from the stable, and Kathri, in her best white apron, from the kitchen, to lift out the sick girl and carry her into the house. Fred and Rikli stood back by the hedge, as still as mice, watching the proceedings.  First, a lady alighted from the carriage, and beckoned to Kathri, who came forward, lifted out the pale child, and carried her up the steps into the house. The lady followed with Mrs. Stein.  \"That girl is a great deal bigger than you are, if mother did say that she was only eight or nine years old,\" said Fred to Rikli. \"She is more nearly Emma's age, and what do you suppose she would think to hear you screaming as you did just now? I don't think she'd like you for a friend.\"  \"Well, at any rate, she wouldn't always have centipedes and frogs and spiders in her pockets, as you have, Fred,\" retorted Rikli; and she was about to add some farther excuse for her screams, when Fred opened his hand to see how his frog was getting on, and lo! the little creature made one big jump right towards Rikli's face! With a piercing cry, the child flew into the house, but was instantly stopped by Kathri, with:  \"Hush! hush! When there is that sick little girl in there, how can you make such a noise?\"  \"Where is aunty?\" asked Rikli; a question that the maid answered before it was fairly uttered, for it was asked hundreds of times in that household every day.  \"In the other room. The sick girl is in here, and you mustn't go in, your mother says. And as for screaming like a pig, you mustn't do that either, in a respectable house,\" added Kathri, on her own account.  Rikli hastened into the room where her aunt was, to tell her about Fred's horrid frog, and how it had jumped almost into her very face. Her aunt was listening to Oscar, the eldest brother, who was talking earnestly.  \"You see, aunty,\" he was saying, \"that if Feklitus does not object, we can put the two verses together; then ours could go here, and the other there, and both would be used. Won't that do?\"  \"Yes, that will be very nice indeed,\" said his aunt in a tone of conviction; \"that will remove all difficulties; and the verses are really very suitable, as such verses ought to be.\"  \"You will help Emma with the embroidery, won't you, aunty? You know she will never finish the banner by herself. She is always up to so many pranks, and she cannot keep at one thing half an hour at a time.\"  His aunt promised her assistance, and he ran off, well pleased, to tell his friends of their new ally. Rikli thought her chance had come now, but before she could begin her story Emma rushed in, crying, almost out of breath:--  \"Aunty! aunty! They are all going to gather strawberries--a lot of boys and girls--may I go too? Say 'yes' quick, for I can't get at mamma and they won't wait.\"  \"Strawberries to-day, violets yesterday, and blueberries to-morrow; always something or other; that is the way with you, Emma. Well, go, but do not stay out too late.\"  \"I want to go too,\" cried Rikli, and started after her sister.  But Emma, clearing the steps in two jumps, called back:--  \"No, you can't go into the woods; there are red snails there and beetles and--\"  But Rikli did not wait to hear more; she was reminded of the frog, and turned back to tell her story, when she saw Fred coming in with his book under his arm. He seated himself by his aunt and opened the book.  \"How nice it is to find you, aunty,\" he began, \"Mamma couldn't wait to hear the end of this description; and it was a pity, for I had found such a perfect specimen. But I'll find another to-morrow to show you.\"  \"No! no!\" cried Rikli. \"Say 'no,' aunty; it will jump right into your face, and it has yellow eyes like a dragon's.\"  Fred had doubled up his fist as if he had something in it, and now he suddenly opened it into his sister's face. She sprang back with a cry, and away through the door.  \"Now we can have a little peace,\" said Fred, well pleased at the success of his trick; and he began to read.  \"'The green or water-frog, _esculenta_'--\"  At this moment the house-door was opened, and they heard footsteps and voices in the passage-way.  \"Come,\" said his aunt, \"let us look out at the little sick girl who is going away; then we will come back to the frog.\"  They went to the window and looked out. A sad expression came into the good aunt's face as she saw the little girl lifted into the carriage.  \"How sick and pale she looks, poor little thing! or, rather, poor sorrowful mother!\" she said, as her eyes fell on the face of the lady who was at this moment pressing Mrs. Stein's hand, while tears were running, unheeded, down her cheeks.  The carriage rolled away. Fred returned to his book; but he had no chance to go on with the description of the frog, for his mother, greatly excited over the sight of the suffering child and the anxious mother, came to talk it over with her sister, with whom she consulted about everything that took place in the family, so that the household would have been as much at a loss without \"aunty\" as without father or mother. Fred saw that this was not his opportunity; so, exacting a promise from his aunt that she would give him a chance with his frog just before bed-time, he took himself off.  Then Mrs. Stein told her sister all about her painful interview with Mrs. Stanhope. The child, she said, was so pale and transparent-looking that she seemed already to belong more to heaven than to earth; but the mother would not believe it, and had eagerly explained, in a burst of tears, that it was only the fatigue of the journey which made Nora look so ill, and that she was sure that the mountain air would soon restore her darling to health. Was she trying to deceive herself?  While Mrs. Stein was speaking, the sound of a horse's hoofs was heard, and she hurried out to meet her husband and to tell him of Mrs. Stanhope's arrival. The doctor hastened away on foot to pay a visit to his new patient. Not until late in the evening did he return; long after the children were safe in their beds. Fred, by the way, had persevered till he had secured his aunt long enough to give her a thorough account of the appearance of the \"green or water-frog.\" It had been no easy task, for each of the children had some special need of her that evening, and his mother, too; and even Kathri asked for \"one word\"; but Fred was not to be cheated, and he came out triumphant at last.  The doctor sat down hungry at the supper-table, and not one word did he speak to his expectant wife and sister, until he had satisfied his appetite. He shook his head doubtfully, in answer to their questions about Nora.  \"There is nothing to build upon,\" he said; \"the little plant has no strength. It is not a case of failing health, but of utter want of vitality from the very beginning. If our mountain air can work a miracle, we may see her restored; if not, there is no hope.\"  His wife and \"aunty\" were grieved at this reply, though they had expected nothing better; but they tried to take a more cheerful view.  \"While there is life, there is hope,\" they said, \"and our mountain air does certainly work wonders.\"  \"I should like to have Emma go to see the little girl, and try to amuse her now and then,\" said the doctor presently; \"Emma has too many schemes in her head; perhaps she will drop some of them if she gets interested in this child, and I am sure it would be a good thing; for her projects almost always end in some kind of mishap. Nora will be rather astonished, probably, at some of her suggestions, but it will do no harm to the poor child to have some new and interesting ideas introduced into her restricted life, and there is no chance of her being enticed into joining in Emma's wild pranks. It will be good for both of them to be together.\"  Mrs. Stein was pleased at the idea of a friendship between the girls. Nora's gentleness and delicacy might have a softening influence on her impulsive little daughter, while, on the other hand, Emma's active, happy spirits could not fail to attract Nora, and to draw her out of herself.  Later in the evening, while the doctor was busy with his arrangements for the next day's work, his wife and her sister sat together, as usual, over the great basket"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15729"],["title","History of the Jews in Russia and Poland, Volume 2 [of 3] (#1)"],["body"," the Exodus               265    3.

MILITARY SERVICE AS A MEANS OF DE-JUDAIZATION  The era of Nicholas I. was typically inaugurated by the bloody suppression of the Decembrists and their constitutional demands, [1] proving as it subsequently did one continuous triumph of military despotism over the liberal movements of the age. As for the emancipation of the Jews, it was entirely unthinkable in an empire which had become Europe's bulwark against the inroads of revolutionary or even moderately liberal tendencies. The new despotic regime, overflowing with aggressive energy, was bound to create, after its likeness, a novel method of dealing with the Jewish problem. Such a method was contrived by the iron will of the Russian autocrat.  [Footnote 1: See Vol. I, p. 410, n. 1.]  Nicholas I., who was originally intended for a military career, was placed on the Russian throne by a whim of fate.[1] Prior to his accession, Nicholas had shown no interest in the Jewish problem. The Jewish masses had flitted across his vision but once--in 1816--when, still a young man, he traveled through Russia for his education. The impression produced upon him by this strange people is recorded by the then grand duke in his diary in a manner fully coincident with the official views of the Government:  [Footnote 1: After the death of Alexander I. the Russian crown fell to his eldest brother Constantine, military commander of Poland. Accordingly, Constantine was proclaimed emperor, and was recognized as such by Nicholas. Constantine, however, who had secretly abdicated some time previously, insisted on resigning, and Nicholas became Tzar.]    The ruin of the peasants of these provinces [1] are the Zhyds. [2] As   property-holders they are here second in importance to the landed   nobility. By their commercial pursuits they drain the strength of   the hapless White Russian people.... They are everything here:   merchants, contractors, saloon-keepers, mill-owners, ferry-holders,   artisans.... They are regular leeches, and suck these unfortunate   governments [3] to the point of exhaustion. It is a matter of   surprise that in 1812 they displayed exemplary loyalty to us and   assisted us wherever they could at the risk of their lives.  [Footnote 1: Nicholas is speaking of White Russia. Compare Vol. I, pp. 329 and 406.]  [Footnote 2: See on this term Vol. I, p. 320, n. 2.]  [Footnote 3: See on this term Vol. I, p. 308, n. 1.]  The characterization of merchants, artisans, mill-owners, and ferry-holders as \"leeches\" could only spring from a conception which looked upon the Jews as transient foreigners, who, by pursuing any line of endeavor, could only do so at the expense of the natives and thus abused the hospitality offered to them. No wonder then that the future Tzar was puzzled by the display of patriotic sentiments on the part of the Jewish population at the fatal juncture in the history of Russia.  This inimical view of the Jewish people was retained by Nicholas when he became the master of Russian-Jewish destinies. He regarded the Jews as an \"injurious element,\" which had no place in a Slavonic Greek-Orthodox monarchy, and which therefore ought to be combated. The Jews must be rendered innocuous, must be \"corrected\" and curbed by such energetic military methods as are in keeping with a form of government based upon the principles of stern tutelage and discipline. As a result of these considerations, a singular scheme was gradually maturing in the mind of the Tzar: to detach the Jews from Judaism by impressing them into a military service of a wholly exceptional character.  The plan of introducing personal military service, instead of the hitherto customary exemption tax, [1] had engaged the attention of the Russian Government towards the end of Alexander I's reign, and had caused a great deal of alarm among the Jewish communities. Nicholas I. was now resolved to carry this plan into effect. Not satisfied with imposing a civil obligation upon a people deprived of civil rights, the Tzar desired to use the Russian military service, a service marked by most extraordinary features, as an educational and disciplinary agency for his Jewish subjects: the barrack was to serve as a school, or rather as a factory, for producing a new generation of de-Judaized Jews, who were completely Russified, and, if possible, Christianized.  [Footnote 1: See Vol. I, p. 318.]  The extension of the term of military service, marked by the ferocious discipline of that age, to a period of twenty-five years, the enrolment of immature lads or practically boys, their prolonged separation from a Jewish environment, and finally the employment of such methods as were likely to produce an immediate effect upon the recruits in the desired direction--all this was deemed an infallible means of dissolving Russian Jewry within the dominant nation, nay, within the dominant Church. It was a direct and simplified scheme which seemed to lead in a straight line to the goal. But had the ruling spheres of St. Petersburg known the history of the Jewish people, they might have realized that the annihilation of Judaism had in past ages been attempted more than once by other, no less forcible, means and that the attempt had always proved a failure.  In the very first year of the new reign, the plan of transforming the Jews by \"military\" methods was firmly settled in the emperor's mind. In 1826 Nichola instructed his ministers to draft a special statute of military service for the Jews, departing in some respects from the general law. In view of the fact that the new military reform was intended to include the Western region [1], which was under the military command of the Tzar's brother. Grand Duke Constantine [2], the draft was sent to him to Warsaw for further suggestions and approval, and was in turn transmitted by the grand duke to Senator Nicholas Novosiltzev, his co-regent [3], for investigation and report. As an experienced statesman, who had familiarized himself during his administrative activity with the Jewish conditions obtaining in the Western region, Novosiltzev realized the grave risks involved in the imperial scheme. In a memorandum submitted by him to the grand duke, he argued convincingly that the sudden imposition of military service upon the Jews was bound to cause an undesirable agitation among them, and that they should, on the contrary, be slowly \"prepared for such a radical transformation.\"  [Footnote 1: The official designation for the territories of Western Russia which were formerly a part of the Polish Empire.]  [Footnote 2: Constantine was appointed by his brother Alexander I, Commander-in-chief of the Polish army after the restoration of Poland in 1815. He remained in this post until his death in 1831. See also above, p. 13, n. 2.]  [Footnote 3: He was the imperial Russian Commissary in Warsaw, and was practically in control of the affairs in Poland. See below, p. 92 et seq.]  Novosiltzev was evidently well informed about the state of mind of the Jewish masses. No sooner had the rumor of the proposed ukase reached the Pale of Settlement than the Jews were "]]]
