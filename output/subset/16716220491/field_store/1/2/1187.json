'I couldn't bear it,' he says, in one of his letters, 'and gave in completely. The composer must be a very remarkable man indeed.' At the same time he became acquainted with Offenbach's music, and heard _Orphée aux enfers_. This was in February, 1863. Here also he made the acquaintance of Auber, 'a stolid little elderly man, rather petulant in manner.' He told Dickens that he had lived for a time at 'Stock Noonton' (Stoke Newington) in order to study English, but he had forgotten it all. In the description of a dinner in the _Sketches_ we read that      The knives and forks form a pleasing accompaniment to     Auber's music, and Auber's music would form a pleasing     accompaniment to the dinner, if you could hear anything     besides the cymbals.  He met Meyerbeer on one occasion at Lord John Russell's. The musician congratulated him on his outspoken language on Sunday observance, a subject in which Dickens was deeply interested, and on which he advocated his views at length in the papers entitled _Sunday under Three Heads_.  Dickens was acquainted with Jenny Lind, and he gives the following amusing story in a letter to Douglas Jerrold, dated Paris, February 14, 1847:      I am somehow reminded of a good story I heard the     other night from a man who was a witness of it and     an actor in it. At a certain German town last autumn     there was a tremendous _furore_ about Jenny Lind, who,     after driving the whole place mad, left it, on her     travels, early one morning. The moment her carriage     was outside the gates, a party of rampant students who     had escorted it rushed back to the inn, demanded to be     shown to her bedroom, swept like a whirlwind upstairs     into the room indicated to them, tore up the sheets,     and wore them in strips as decorations. An hour or two     afterwards a bald old gentleman of amiable appearance,     an Englishman, who was staying in the hotel, came to     breakfast at the _table d'hôte_, and was observed to be     much disturbed in his mind, and to show great terror     whenever a student came near him. At last he said, in     a low voice, to some people who were near him at the     table, 'You are English gentlemen, I observe. Most     extraordinary people, these Germans. Students,     as a body, raving mad, gentlemen!' 'Oh, no,' said     somebody else: 'excitable, but very good fellows,     and very sensible.' 'By God, sir!' returned the old     gentleman, still more disturbed, 'then there's something     political in it, and I'm a marked man. I went out for     a little walk this morning after shaving, and while I     was gone'--he fell into a terrible perspiration as he     told it--'they burst into my bedroom, tore up my sheets,     and are now patrolling the town in all directions with     bits of 'em in their button-holes.' I needn't wind     up by adding that they had gone to the wrong chamber.  It was Dickens' habit wherever he went on his Continental travels to avail himself of any opportunity of visiting the opera; and his criticisms, though brief, are always to the point. He tells us this interesting fact about Carrara:      There is a beautiful little theatre there, built of     marble, and they had it illuminated that night in my     honour. There was really a very fair opera, but it is     curious that the chorus has been always, time out of     mind, made up of labourers in the quarries, who don't     know a note of music, and sing entirely by ear.  But much as he loved music, Dickens could never bear the least sound or noise while he was studying or writing, and he ever waged a fierce war against church bells and itinerant musicians. Even when in Scotland his troubles did not cease, for he writes about 'a most infernal piper practising under the window for a competition of pipers which is to come off shortly.' Elsewhere he says that he found Dover 'too bandy' for him (he carefully explains he does not refer to its legs), while in a letter to Forster he complains bitterly of the vagrant musicians at Broadstairs, where he 'cannot write half an hour without the most excruciating organs, fiddles, bells, or glee singers.' The barrel-organ, which he somewhere calls an 'Italian box of music,' was one source of annoyance, but bells were his special aversion. 'If you know anybody at St. Paul's,' he wrote to Forster, 'I wish you'd send round and ask them not to ring the bell so. I can hardly hear my own ideas as they come into my head, and say what they mean.' His bell experiences at Genoa are referred to elsewhere (p. 57).  How marvellously observant he was is manifest in the numerous references in his letters and works to the music he heard in the streets and squares of London and other places. Here is a description of Golden Square, London, W. (_N.N._):      Two or three violins and a wind instrument from     the Opera band reside within its precincts. Its     boarding-houses are musical, and the notes of pianos     and harps float in the evening time round the head of     the mournful statue, the guardian genius of the little     wilderness of shrubs, in the centre of the square....     Sounds of gruff voices practising vocal music invade     the evening's silence, and the fumes of choice tobacco     scent the air. There, snuff and cigars and German     pipes and flutes, and violins and violoncellos, divide     the supremacy between them. It is the region of song     and smoke. Street bands are on their mettle in Golden     Square, and itinerant glee singers quaver involuntarily     as they raise their voices within its boundaries.  We have another picture in the description of Dombey's house, where--      the summer sun was never on the street but in the     morning, about breakfast-time.... It was soon gone     again, to return no more that day, and the bands of     music and the straggling Punch's shows going after     it left it a prey to the most dismal of organs and     white mice.   _As a Singer_  Most of the writers about Dickens, and especially his personal friends, bear testimony both to his vocal power and his love of songs and singing. As a small boy we read of him and his sister Fanny standing on a table singing songs, and acting them as they sang. One of his favourite recitations was Dr. Watts' 'The voice of the sluggard,' which he used to give with great effect. The memory of these words lingered long in his mind, and both Captain Cuttle and Mr. Pecksniff quote them with excellent appropriateness.  When he grew up he retained his love of vocal music, and showed a strong predilection for national airs and old songs. Moore's _Irish Melodies_ had also a special attraction for him. In the early days of his readings his voice frequently used to fail him, and Mr. Kitton tells us that in trying to recover the lost power he would test it by singing these melodies to himself as he walked about. It is not surprising, therefore, to find numerous references to these songs, as well as to other works by Moore, in his writings.  From a humorous account of a concert on board ship we gather that Dickens possessed a tenor voice. Writing to his daughter from Boston in 1867, he says:      We had speech-making and singing in the saloon of the     _Cuba_ after the last dinner of the voyage. I think I     have acquired a higher reputation from drawing out the     captain, and getting him to take the second in 'All's     Well' and likewise in 'There's not in the wide world'[2]     (your parent taking the first), than from anything     previously known of me on these shores.... We also sang     (with a Chicago lady, and a strong-minded woman from     I don't know where) 'Auld Lang Syne,' with a tender     melancholy expressive of having all four been united     from our cradles. The more dismal we were, the more     delighted the company were. Once (when we paddled i'     the burn) the captain took a little cruise round the     compass on his own account, touching at the Canadian     Boat Song,[3] and taking in supplies at Jubilate, 'Seas     between us braid ha' roared,' and roared like ourselves.  J.T. Field, in his _Yesterdays with Authors_, says: 'To hear him sing an old-time stage song, such as he used to enjoy in his youth at a cheap London theatre ... was to become acquainted with one of the most delightful and original companions in the world.'  When at home he was fond of having music in the evening. His daughter tells us that on one occasion a member of his family was singing a song while he was apparently deep in his book, when he suddenly got up and saying 'You don't make enough of that word,' he sat down by the piano and showed how it should be sung.  On another occasion his criticism was more pointed.      One night a gentleman visitor insisted on singing     'By the sad sea waves,' which he did vilely, and he     wound up his performance by a most unexpected and     misplaced embellishment, or 'turn.' Dickens found the     whole ordeal very trying, but managed to preserve a     decorous silence till this sound fell on his ear, when     his neighbour said to him, 'Whatever did he mean by     that extraneous effort of melody?' 'Oh,' said Dickens,     'that's quite in accordance with rule. When things     are at their worst they always take a _turn_.'  Forster relates that while he was at work on the _Old Curiosity Shop_ he used to discover specimens of old ballads in his country walks between Broadstairs and Ramsgate, which so aroused his interest that when he returned to town towards the end of 1840 he thoroughly explored the ballad literature of Seven Dials,[4] and would occasionally sing not a few of these wonderful discoveries with an effect that justified his reputation for comic singing in his childhood. We get a glimpse of his investigations in _Out of the Season_, where he tells us about that 'wonderful mystery, the music-shop,' with "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16595"],["title","Charles Dickens and Music (#2)"],["body","assortment of polkas with coloured frontispieces, and also the book-shop, with its 'Little Warblers and Fairburn's Comic Songsters.'      Here too were ballads on the old ballad paper and     in the old confusion of types, with an old man in a     cocked hat, and an armchair, for the illustration     to Will Watch the bold smuggler, and the Friar of     Orders Grey, represented by a little girl in a hoop,     with a ship in the distance. All these as of yore,     when they were infinite delights to me.  On one of his explorations he met a landsman who told him about the running down of an emigrant ship, and how he heard a sound coming over the sea 'like a great sorrowful flute or Aeolian harp.' He makes another and very humorous reference to this instrument in a letter to Landor, in which he calls to mind      that steady snore of yours, which I once heard piercing     the door of your bedroom ... reverberating along the     bell-wire in the hall, so getting outside into the     street, playing Aeolian harps among the area railings,     and going down the New Road like the blast of a trumpet.  The deserted watering-place referred to in _Out of the Season_ is Broadstairs, and he gives us a further insight into its musical resources in a letter to Miss Power written on July 2, 1847, in which he says that      a little tinkling box of music that stops at 'come'     in the melody of the Buffalo Gals, and can't play 'out     to-night,' and a white mouse, are the only amusements     left at Broadstairs.  'Buffalo Gals' was a very popular song 'Sung with great applause by the Original Female American Serenaders.' (_c._ 1845.) The first verse will explain the above allusion:      As I went lum'rin' down de street, down de street,     A 'ansom gal I chanc'd to meet, oh, she was fair to view.     Buffalo gals, can't ye come out to-night, come out to-night,             come out to-night;     Buffalo gals, can't ye come out to-night, and dance by the             light of the moon.  We find some interesting musical references and memories in the novelist's letters. Writing to Wilkie Collins in reference to his proposed sea voyage, he quotes Campbell's lines from 'Ye Mariners of England':      As I sweep     Through the deep     When the stormy winds do blow.  There are other references to this song in the novels. I have pointed out elsewhere that the last line also belongs to a seventeenth-century song.  Writing to Mark Lemon (June, 1849) he gives an amusing parody of      Lesbia hath a beaming eye,  beginning      Lemon is a little hipped.  In a letter to Maclise he says:      My foot is in the house,       My bath is on the sea,     And before I take a souse,       Here's a single note to thee.  These lines are a reminiscence of Byron's ode to Tom Moore, written from Venice on July 10, 1817:      My boat is on the shore,       And my bark is on the sea,     But before I go, Tom Moore,       Here's a double health to thee!  The words were set to music by Bishop. This first verse had a special attraction for Dickens, and he gives us two or three variations of it, including a very apt one from Dick Swiveller (see p. 126).  Henry F. Chorley, the musical critic, was an intimate friend of Dickens. On one occasion he went to hear Chorley lecture on 'The National Music of the World,' and subsequently wrote him a very friendly letter criticizing his delivery, but speaking in high terms of the way he treated his subject.  In one of his letters he makes special reference to the singing of the Hutchinson family.[5] Writing to the Countess of Blessington, he says:      I must have some talk with you about these American     singers. They must never go back to their own country     without your having heard them sing Hood's 'Bridge     of Sighs.'  Amongst the distinguished visitors at Gad's Hill was Joachim, who was always a welcome guest, and of whom Dickens once said 'he is a noble fellow.' His daughter writes in reference to this visit:      I never remember seeing him so wrapt and absorbed as     he was then, on hearing him play; and the wonderful     simplicity and _un_-self-consciousness of the genius     went straight to my father's heart, and made a fast     bond of sympathy between those two great men.   _In Music Drama_  Much has been written about Dickens' undoubted powers as an actor, as well as his ability as a stage manager, and it is well known that it was little more than an accident that kept him from adopting the dramatic profession. He ever took a keen interest in all that pertained to the stage, and when he was superintending the production of a play he was always particular about the musical arrangements. There is in existence a play-bill of 1833 showing that he superintended a private performance of _Clari_. This was an opera by Bishop, and contains the first appearance of the celebrated 'Home, Sweet Home,' a melody which, as we have already said, he reproduced on the accordion some years after. He took the part of Rolano, but had no opportunity of showing off his singing abilities, unless he took a part in the famous glee 'Sleep, gentle lady,' which appears in the work as a quartet for alto, two tenors, and bass, though it is now arranged in other forms.  In his dealings with the drama Dickens was frequently his own bandmaster and director of the music. For instance, in _No Thoroughfare_ we find this direction: 'Boys enter and sing \"God Save the Queen\" (or any school devotional hymn).' At Obenreizer's entrance a 'mysterious theme is directed to be played,' that gentleman being 'well informed, clever, and a good musician.'  Dickens was concerned in the production of one operetta--_The Village Coquettes_--for which he wrote the words, and John Hullah composed the music. It consists of songs, duets, and concerted pieces, and was first produced at St. James's Theatre, London, on December 6, 1836. The following year it was being performed at Edinburgh when a fire broke out in the theatre, and the instrumental scores together with the music of the concerted pieces were destroyed. No fresh copy was ever made, but the songs are still to be obtained. Mr. Kitton, in his biography of the novelist, says, 'The play was well received, and duly praised by prominent musical journals.'  The same writer gives us to understand that Hullah originally composed the music for an opera called _The Gondolier_, but used the material for _The Village Coquettes_. Braham, the celebrated tenor, had a part in it. Dickens says in a letter to Hullah that he had had some conversation with Braham about the work. The singer thought very highly of it, and Dickens adds:      His only remaining suggestion is that Miss     Rainforth[6] will want another song when the piece is     in rehearsal--'a bravura--something in \"The soldier     tired\" way.'  We have here a reference to a song which had a long run of popularity. It is one of the airs in Arne's _Artaxerxes_, an opera which was produced in 1761, and which held the stage for many years. There is a reference to this song in _Sketches by Boz_, when Miss Evans and her friends visited the Eagle. During the concert 'Miss Somebody in white satin' sang this air, much to the satisfaction of her audience.  Dickens wrote a few songs and ballads, and in most cases he fell in with the custom of his time, and suggested the tune (if any) to which they were to be sung. In addition to those that appear in the various novels, there are others which deserve mention here.  In 1841 he contributed three political squibs in verse to the _Examiner_, one being the 'Quack Doctor's Proclamation,' to the tune of 'A Cobbler there was,' and another called 'The fine old English Gentleman.'  For the _Daily News_ (of which he was the first editor) he wrote 'The British Lion, a new song but an old story,' which was to be sung to the tune of the 'Great Sea Snake.' This was a very popular comic song of the period, which described a sea monster of wondrous size:      One morning from his head we bore       With every stitch of sail,     And going at ten knots an hour       In six months came to his tail.  Three of the songs in the _Pickwick Papers_ (referred to elsewhere) are original, while Blandois' song in _Little Dorrit_, 'Who passes by this road so late,' is a translation from the French. This was set to music by R.S. Dalton.  In addition to these we find here and there impromptu lines which have no connexion with any song. Perhaps the best known are those which 'my lady Bowley' quotes in _The Chimes_, and which she had 'set to music on the new system':      Oh let us love our occupations,     Bless the squire and his relations,     Live upon our daily rations,     And always know our proper stations.  The reference to the 'new system' is not quite obvious. Dickens may have been thinking of the 'Wilhem' method of teaching singing which his friend Hullah introduced into England, or it may be a reference to the Tonic Sol-fa system, which had already begun to make progress when _The Chimes_ was written in 1844.[7]  There are some well-known lines which owners of books were fond of writing on the fly-leaf in order that there might be no mistake as to the name of the possessor. The general form was something like this:      John Wigglesworth is my name,       And England is my nation;     London is my dwelling-place,       And Christ is my salvation.  (See _Choir_, Jan., 1912, p. 5.) Dickens gives us at least two variants of this. In _Edwin Drood_, Durdles says of the Mayor of Cloisterham:      Mister Sapsea is his name,       England is his nation,     Cloisterham's his dwelling-place,       Aukshneer's his occupation.  And Captain Cuttle thus describes himself, ascribing the authorship of the words to Job--but then literary accuracy was not the Captain's strong point:      Cap'en Cuttle is my name,       And England is my nation,     This here is my dwelling-place,       And blessed be creation.  It is said that there"]]]
