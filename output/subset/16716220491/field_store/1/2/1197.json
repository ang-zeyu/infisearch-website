They were thrusting pale thick muscles out between the lobes of their shells. \"They look as if they were sticking out their tongues at us,\" said Nancy as she picked one up gingerly and dropped it into the basket. \"But, Dan, Mother said we were to bed them in seaweed!\"  \"I see none here,\" said Dan, leaning on his shovel and looking about him. \"The tide hath swept everything as clean as a floor.\"  \"I 'll seek for some while thou art busy with the digging,\" said Nancy, glad to escape the duty of picking up the clams, and off she trotted without another word. The flats, seamed and grooved with channels where pools of water still lingered, sloped gently down to the lower level of the bay, and farther out a range of rocks lifted themselves above the sandy waste.  [Illustration]  \"I 'll surely find seaweed on the rocks,\" thought Nancy to herself as she sped along, and in a few moments she had reached them, had tossed up the basket, and was climbing their rugged sides.  \"There 's a mort o' seaweed here,\" she said, nodding her head wisely as she picked up a long string of kelp; \"I can fill my basket in no time at all.\" There was no need for haste, she thought, so she sat down beside a pool of water left in a hollow of the rocks, to explore its contents. The first thing she found was a group of tiny barnacles, and for a while she amused herself by washing salt water over them to see them open their tiny cups of shell. In the pool itself a beautiful lavender-colored jelly-fish was floating about, and just beyond lay a star-fish clinging to a bunch of seaweed. She found other treasures scattered about by the largess of the tide--tiny spiral shells, stones of all colors, and a horseshoe crab, besides seaweed with pretty little pods which popped delightfully when she squeezed them with her fingers. Then she heard the cries of gulls overhead and watched them as they wheeled and circled between her and the sky. When they flew out to sea she sat with her hands clasping her knees and gazed across the bay at the three hills of Boston town. She could see quite plainly the tall beacon standing like a ship's mast on top of Beacon Hill, and farther north she strained her eyes to pick out Governor Winthrop's dwelling from the cluster of houses which straggled up the slope of Copp's Hill and which made all there was of the city of Boston in that early day.  [Illustration]  For some time she sat there hugging her knees and thinking long, long thoughts, and it was not until the sound of little waves lapping against the rocks roused her that she woke from her day dream and realized with terror that the tide had turned. The channels and lower levels of the bay were already brimming over, and the water was deep about the rocks on which she perched. At almost the same moment Dan had been surprised by a cold wave which washed over his bare feet, and, turning about, was dismayed to find a sheet of blue water covering the bay and to see Nancy standing on the topmost rock shouting \"Dan! Dan!\" at the top of her lungs. For one astonished instant he looked at her, then, throwing down his shovel, he plunged unhesitatingly into the icy bath. And now Nancy, realizing that there was not a moment to lose if she hoped to reach the shore in safety, let herself slowly down off the rocks, leaving the basket behind her, and started toward her brother.  The water was already so deep in the channels that their progress toward each other was slow, but they ploughed bravely on, feeling the bottom carefully at each step lest they sink in some sand-pocket or hollow washed out by the tide. Some distance away toward Charlestown a fishing schooner rocked on the deeper water of the bay, and a fisherman in a small boat, attracted by the shouting, looked up, and, seeing the two struggling figures, instantly bent to his oars and started toward them. Though he rowed rapidly, it was some minutes before he could reach the children, who were now floundering about in water nearly up to their necks.  [Illustration]  \"Hold fast to my shoulder, Nancy,\" he heard Dan cry. \"I can float, and I can swim a little. Keep thy nose above water and let thy feet go where they will.\" Nancy, spluttering and gurgling, was trying hard to follow Dan's directions, when the boat shot alongside, and a cheery voice cried, \"Ahoy, there! Come aboard, you young porpoises!\"  To the children it was like a voice straight from heaven. Dan immediately helped Nancy to get into the boat, and then she balanced it while he climbed aboard.  When they were safely bestowed among the lobster-pots with which the boat was laden, the man leaned on his oars and eyed them critically. \"Short of sense, ain't ye?\" he remarked genially. \"Nigh about drownded that time or I 'm no skipper! If ye ain't bent on destruction ye 'd better get into dry clothes. Ye 're as wet as a mess of drownded kittens. Tell me where you live and I 'll take you home.\"  He flung a tarpaulin over the shivering figures and tucked it around them as he scolded. \"'T is all my fault,\" sobbed poor Nancy. \"Dan came in just to get me out.\"  \"Very commendable of him, I 'm sure,\" said the stranger, nodding approvingly at Dan, \"and just what he 'd ought to do, and doubtless you 're worth saving at that, though a hen-headeder young miss I never see in all my days!\"  \"She went to find seaweed to bed the clams,\" explained Dan, coming to his sister's defense, \"and the tide caught her. Thou art kind indeed to pick us up, sir.\"  \"Oh,\" groaned remorseful Nancy, her teeth chattering, \"it 's all because I 'm such a sinner! I made a likeness of Gran'ther Wattles in the sand and said dreadful things about the prophet Elijah, or mayhap 't was Elisha, and Dan said a bear might come to eat me up just like the forty and two children, and instead of a bear we both were almost swallowed by the tide!\"  \"Well, now,\" said the stranger, comfortingly, \"ye see instead of sending bears the Lord sent me along to fish ye out, just the same as He sent the whale to swallow Jonah when he was acting contrary! Looks like He meant to let ye off with a scare this time. Come now, my lass, there 's salt water enough aboard and if ye cry into the boat, ye 'll have to bail her out. Besides,\" he added whimsically, looking up at the sky, \"there 's another squall coming on, and two at a time is too many for any sailor. If I 'm to cast you up on the shore same as the whale, ye 'll have to tell me which way to go, and who ye are.\"  \"Our father is Josiah Pepperell,\" answered Dan, \"and our house is almost a mile back from shore near Cambridge.\"  \"So you 're Josiah Pepperell's children! To be sure, to be sure! Might have known it. Ye do favor him some,\" said the fisherman. \"Well! well! The ways of the Lord are surely past finding out! Why, I knew your father way back in England. He came over here for religion and I came for fish. Not that I ain't a God-fearing man,\" he added hastily, noticing a look of horror on Nancy's face, \"but I ain't so pious as some. I 'm a seafaring man, Captain Sanders of the Lucy Ann, Marblehead. Ye can see her riding at anchor out there in the bay. I have n't set eyes on your father since he left Boston and settled in the back woods up yonder.\"  He sent the boat flying through the water with swift, sure strokes as he talked, and brought it ashore at the first landing-place they found. Here they drew it up on the bank and, taking out the lobster-pots, turned it upside down so the rain would not fill it. Two great green lobsters with goblin-like eyes were hidden away under the pots, and when the boat was overturned they tumbled out and started at a lively pace for the water.  \"Hi, there!\" shouted the Captain, seizing them by their tails, \"where are your manners? By jolly, I like to forgot ye! Come along now and take supper with the Pepperells. I invite ye! They 're short of clams and they 'll be pleased to see ye, or I miss my reckoning.\" There were pegs stuck in the scissor-like claws, so the creatures were harmless, and, swinging along with one kicking vigorously in each hand, the Captain plunged into the long meadow grass, the children following close at his heels.  The clouds grew darker and darker; there was a rumble of thunder, and streaks of lightning tore great rents in the sky as they hurried across the open meadow and struck into the pasture land beyond.  \"Head into the wind there and keep going,\" shouted the Captain as the children struggled along, impeded by their wet clothing. \"It 's from the north, and we 're pointed straight into it.\"  Past bushes waving distractedly in the wind, under the boughs of young oak trees, over stones and through briars they sped, and at last they came in sight of the cabin just as the storm broke. Goodwife Pepperell was standing in the door gazing anxiously toward the river, when they dashed out of the bushes and, scudding past her, stood dripping on the hearth-stone. Her husband was just hanging his gun over the chimney-piece, and the noise of their entrance was drowned out by a clap of thunder; so when he turned about and saw the three drenched figures it was no wonder that for an instant he was too surprised to speak.  \"Well, of all things!\" he said at last, holding out his hand to Captain Sanders. \"What in God's providence brings thee here, Thomas? Thou art welcome indeed. 'T is a long time since I have seen thee.\"  \"God's providence ye may call it,\" answered the Captain, shaking the Goodman's hand as if he were pumping out the hold of a sinking ship, \"and I 'll not gainsay it. The truth is I overhauled these small craft floundering around in the tide-wash with water over their scuppers 'n' all but wrecked, so I took 'em in tow and brought 'em ashore!\"  Their mother, meanwhile, had not waited for explanations. Seeing how chilled they were, she had hurried the children to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16644"],["title","The Puritan Twins (#2)"],["body","loft above the one room of the cabin and was already giving them a rub-down and getting out dry clean clothes while they told her their adventure.  \"Thank God you are safe,\" she said, clasping them both in her arms, when the tale was told.  \"Thank Captain Sanders as well, Mother,\" said Daniel. \"Had it not been for him, I doubt if we could have reached the shore.\"  \"Let this be a lesson to you, then,\" said the Goodwife, loosening her clasp and picking up the wet clothing. \"You know well about the tide! Nancy, child, why art thou so wild and reckless? Thou art the cause of much anxiety.\"  At her mother's reproof, gentle though it was, poor Nancy flopped over on her stomach, and, burying her face in her hands, gave way to tears.  \"It 's all because I am so wicked,\" she moaned. \"My sins are as scarlet! Oh, Mother, dost think God will cause the lightning to strike us dead to punish me?\" She shuddered with fear as a flash shone through the chinks of the logs and for an instant lighted the dim loft.  Her mother put down the wet clothes and, lifting her little daughter tenderly in her arms, laid her on her bed. \"God maketh the rain to fall on both the just and the unjust,\" she said soothingly. \"Rest here while I go down and get supper.\"  She covered her warmly with a homespun blanket, and, accompanied by Dan, made her way down the ladder. She found her husband putting fresh logs on the fire and stirring the coals to a blaze, while the Captain hung his coat on the corner of the mantel-shelf to dry. She went up to him and held out her hand. \"Captain Sanders,\" she said, \"but for thee this might be a desolate household indeed this night.\"  The Captain's red face turned a deeper shade, and he fidgeted with embarrassment, as he took her hand in his great red paw, then dropped it suddenly as if it were hot. \"Oh, stow it, ma'am, stow it,\" he begged. \"That is, I mean to say--why, by jolly, ma'am, a pirate could do no less when he see a fine bit of cargo like that going to the bottom!\"  To the Captain's great relief the lobsters at this moment created a diversion. He had dropped them on the hearth when he came in, and they were now clattering briskly about the room, butting into anything that came in their way in an effort to escape. He made a sudden dash after them and held them out toward Goodwife Pepperell.  \"Here they be, ma'am,\" he said. \"I 'd saved them for my supper, and I 'd take it kindly if ye 'd cook them for me, and help eat them, too. It 's raining cats and dogs, and if I was to start out now, I 'd have a hard time finding the Lucy Ann. Ye can't see a rod ahead of ye in such a downpour.\"  \"We shall be glad to have thee stay as long as thou wilt,\" said the Goodwife heartily. \"Put the lobsters in this while I set the kettle to boil.\" She held out a wooden puncheon as she spoke, and the Captain dropped them in. Then he sat down with Goodman Pepperell on the settle beside the fireplace, and the two men talked of their boyhood in England, while she hung the kettle on the crane over the fire and began to prepare the evening meal.  \"Daniel, sit thee down by the fire and get a good bed of coals ready while I mix the johnny-cake,\" she said as she stepped briskly about the room, and Daniel, nothing loath, drew a stool to the Captain's side and fed the fire with chips and corn-cobs while he listened with all his ears to the talk of the two men.  [Illustration]  \"Well, Thomas, how hast thou prospered since I saw thee last?\" asked Goodman Pepperell.  \"Tolerable, tolerable, Josiah,\" answered the Captain. \"I 've been mining for sea gold.\" Daniel wondered what in the world sea gold might be. \"Ye see,\" he went on, turning to include Daniel in the conversation, \"my father was a sea captain before me, and my gran'ther too. Why, my gran'ther helped send the Spanish Armada to the bottom where it belonged. Many and many 's the time I 've heard him tell about it, and I judge from what he said he must have done most of the job himself, though I reckon old Cap'n Drake may have helped some.\" (Here the Captain chuckled.) \"He never came back from his last voyage,--overhauled by pirates more 'n likely. That was twenty years ago, and I 've been following the sea myself ever since. I was wrecked off the Spanish Main on my first voyage, and I 've run afoul of pirates and come near walking the plank more times than one, I 'm telling ye, but somehow I always had the luck to get away! And here I be, safe and sound.\"  At this point the lobsters made a commotion in the wooden puncheon, and the Captain turned his attention to them. \"Jest spilin' to get out, ain't ye?\" he inquired genially. \"Look here, boy,\" to Daniel, \"that water's bilin'. Heave 'em in.\"  Daniel held his squirming victims over the pot, and not without a qualm of pity dropped them into the boiling water. Then he ventured to ask a question. \"What is sea gold, Captain Sanders?\"  \"Things like them,\" answered the Captain, jerking his thumb at the lobsters, which were already beginning to turn a beautiful red color as they boiled in the pot; \"as good gold as any that was ever dug out of mines ye can get for fish, and there never was such fishing in all the seas as there is along this coast! My! my! I 've seen schools of cod off the Cape making a solid floor of fish on the water so ye could walk on it if ye were so minded, and as for lobsters, I 've caught 'em that measured six and seven feet long! Farther down the coast there are oysters so big one of 'em will make a square meal for four or five people. It 's the truth I 'm telling ye.\"  Goodman Pepperell smiled. \"Thomas,\" he said, \"thou hast not lost thy power of narration!\"  Captain Sanders for an instant looked a bit dashed, then he said, \"Well, believe it or not, Josiah, it 's the truth for all that. Why, talk about the land of Canaan flowin' with milk and honey! This here water 's just alive with money! Any boy could go out and haul up a shilling on his own hook any time he liked.\"  Daniel, his eyes shining and his lips parted, was just making up his mind that he would rather be the captain of a fishing-smack than anything else in the world, since he knew he could n't be a pirate, when his mother came to the fireplace with a layer of corn-meal dough spread on a baking-board. She placed the board in a slanting position against an iron trivet before the glowing bed of coals, and set a pot of beans in the ashes to warm. \"Keep an eye on that johnny-cake,\" she said to Daniel, \"and don't let it burn.\" Then she turned away to set the table.  [Illustration]  This task took but little time, for in those days there were few things to put on it. She spread a snowy cloth of homespun linen on the plank which served as a table, and laid a knife and spoon at each place; there were no forks, and for plates only a square of wood with a shallow depression in the middle. Beside each of these trenchers she placed a napkin and a mug, and at the Captain's place, as a special honor, she set a beautiful tankard of wrought silver. It was one of the few valuable things she had brought with her from her English home, and it was used only on great occasions.  When these preparations were complete, she took the lobsters from the pot, poured the beans into a pewter dish, heaped the golden johnny-cake high upon a trencher, and, sending Dan to fetch Nancy, called the men to supper. The storm was over by this time, the last rays of the setting sun were throwing long shadows over the fields, and the robins were singing their evening song. The Goodwife stepped to the window and threw open the wooden shutters. \"See,\" she said. \"There 's a rainbow.\"  \"The sign of promise,\" murmured Goodman Pepperell, rising and looking over his wife's shoulder.  \"Fine day to-morrow,\" said the Captain. \"Maybe I can plant my lobster-pots after all.\"  Nancy, looking pale and a little subdued, crept down the ladder and took her place with Daniel at the foot of the board. Then they all stood, while Goodman Pepperell asked a blessing on the food, and thanked God for his mercy in delivering them from danger and bringing them together in health and safety to partake of his bounty.  [Illustration]     II  TWO DAYS   The grace finished (it was a very long one and the beans were nearly cold before he said amen), Goodman Pepperell broke open the lobsters and piled the trenchers with johnny-cake and beans, and the whole family fell to with a right good will. All but Nancy. She was still a bit upset and did not feel hungry.  \"Thou hast not told me, Captain, what voyage thou art about to undertake next,\" said the Goodman, sucking a lobster-claw with relish.  The Captain loved to talk quite as well as he loved to eat, but his mouth was full at this moment, and he paused before replying. \"I 'm getting too old for long voyages, Josiah,\" he said at last with a sigh. \"Kind o' losing my taste for adventure. Pirates is pretty plentiful yet, and for all I 'm a sailor I 'd like to die in my bed, so I have settled at Marblehead. They 're partial to fishermen along this coast. The town gives 'em land for drying their fish and exempts 'em from military dooty. But I can't stay ashore a great while before my sea legs begin to hanker for the feel of the deck rolling under 'em, so I 'm doing a coasting trade all up and down the length of Massachusetts Bay. I keep a parcel of lobster-pots going, some here and some Plymouth way, and sell them and fish, besides doing a carrying trade for all the towns along-shore. It 's a tame kind o' life. There, now,\" he finished, \"that 's all there is to say about me, and I 'll just take a turn at these beans and give ye a chance to tell about yourself, Josiah.\"  \"'T is but a short tale,\" answered the Goodman, \"God hath prospered me. I have an hundred acres of good farm land along this river, and I have a cow, and a flock of sheep to keep us in wool for the Good wife to spin. I have set out apple trees, and there is wood for the cutting; the forest furnishes game and the sea is"]]]
