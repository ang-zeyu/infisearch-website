Let it be quite understood that it was not you but the ‘Epoque’ that discovered the left foot of the Rue Oberskampf. Here, my young friend, the man is nothing, the paper everything.”  Having said this, he begged the new reporter to retire, but before the youth had reached the door he called him back to ask his name. The other replied:  “Joseph Josephine.”  “That’s not a name,” said the editor-in-chief, “but since you will not be required to sign what you write it is of no consequence.”  The boy-faced reporter speedily made himself many friends, for he was serviceable and gifted with a good humour that enchanted the most severe-tempered and disarmed the most zealous of his companions. At the Bar cafe, where the reporters assembled before going to any of the courts, or to the Prefecture, in search of their news of crime, he began to win a reputation as an unraveller of intricate and obscure affairs which found its way to the office of the Chief of the Surete. When a case was worth the trouble and Rouletabille--he had already been given his nickname--had been started on the scent by his editor-in-chief, he often got the better of the most famous detective.  It was at the Bar cafe that I became intimately acquainted with him. Criminal lawyers and journalists are not enemies, the former need advertisement, the latter information. We chatted together, and I soon warmed towards him. His intelligence was so keen, and so original!--and he had a quality of thought such as I have never found in any other person.  Some time after this I was put in charge of the law news of the “Cri du Boulevard.” My entry into journalism could not but strengthen the ties which united me to Rouletabille. After a while, my new friend being allowed to carry out an idea of a judicial correspondence column, which he was allowed to sign “Business,” in the “Epoque,” I was often able to furnish him with the legal information of which he stood in need.  Nearly two years passed in this way, and the better I knew him, the more I learned to love him; for, in spite of his careless extravagance, I had discovered in him what was, considering his age, an extraordinary seriousness of mind. Accustomed as I was to seeing him gay and, indeed, often too gay, I would many times find him plunged in the deepest melancholy. I tried then to question him as to the cause of this change of humour, but each time he laughed and made me no answer. One day, having questioned him about his parents, of whom he never spoke, he left me, pretending not to have heard what I said.  While things were in this state between us, the famous case of The “Yellow Room” took place. It was this case which was to rank him as the leading newspaper reporter, and to obtain for him the reputation of being the greatest detective in the world. It should not surprise us to find in the one man the perfection of two such lines of activity if we remember that the daily press was already beginning to transform itself and to become what it is to-day--the gazette of crime.  Morose-minded people may complain of this; for myself I regard it a matter for congratulation. We can never have too many arms, public or private, against the criminal. To this some people may answer that, by continually publishing the details of crimes, the press ends by encouraging their commission. But then, with some people we can never do right. Rouletabille, as I have said, entered my room that morning of the 26th of October, 1892. He was looking redder than usual, and his eyes were bulging out of his head, as the phrase is, and altogether he appeared to be in a state of extreme excitement. He waved the “Matin”  with a trembling hand, and cried:  “Well, my dear Sainclair,--have you read it?”  “The Glandier crime?”  “Yes; “The Yellow Room”!--What do you think of it?”  “I think that it must have been the Devil or the Bete du Bon Dieu that committed the crime.”  “Be serious!”  “Well, I don’t much believe in murderers* who make their escape through walls of solid brick. I think Daddy Jacques did wrong to leave behind him the weapon with which the crime was committed and, as he occupied the attic immediately above Mademoiselle Stangerson’s room, the builder’s job ordered by the examining magistrate will give us the key of the enigma and it will not be long before we learn by what natural trap, or by what secret door, the old fellow was able to slip in and out, and return immediately to the laboratory to Monsieur Stangerson, without his absence being noticed. That, of course, is only an hypothesis.”     *Although the original English translation often uses the words    “murder” and “murderer,” the reader may substitute “attack” and    “attacker” since no murder is actually committed.  Rouletabille sat down in an armchair, lit his pipe, which he was never without, smoked for a few minutes in silence--no doubt to calm the excitement which, visibly, dominated him--and then replied:  “Young man,” he said, in a tone the sad irony of which I will not attempt to render, “young man, you are a lawyer and I doubt not your ability to save the guilty from conviction; but if you were a magistrate on the bench, how easy it would be for you to condemn innocent persons!--You are really gifted, young man!”  He continued to smoke energetically, and then went on:  “No trap will be found, and the mystery of “The Yellow Room” will become more and more mysterious. That’s why it interests me. The examining magistrate is right; nothing stranger than this crime has ever been known.”  “Have you any idea of the way by which the murderer escaped?” I asked.  “None,” replied Rouletabille--“none, for the present. But I have an idea as to the revolver; the murderer did not use it.”  “Good Heavens! By whom, then, was it used?”  “Why--by Mademoiselle Stangerson.”  “I don’t understand,--or rather, I have never understood,” I said.  Rouletabille shrugged his shoulders.  “Is there nothing in this article in the ‘Matin’ by which you were particularly struck?”  “Nothing,--I have found the whole of the story it tells equally strange.”  “Well, but--the locked door--with the key on the inside?”  “That’s the only perfectly natural thing in the whole article.”  “Really!--And the bolt?”  “The bolt?”  “Yes, the bolt--also inside the room--a still further protection against entry? Mademoiselle Stangerson took quite extraordinary precautions! It is clear to me that she feared someone. That was why she took such precautions--even Daddy Jacques’s revolver--without telling him of it. No doubt she didn’t wish to alarm anybody, and least of all, her father. What she dreaded took place, and she defended herself. There was a struggle, and she used the revolver skilfully enough to wound the assassin in the hand--which explains the impression on the wall and on the door of the large, blood-stained hand of the man who was searching for a means of exit from the chamber. But she didn’t fire soon enough to avoid the terrible blow on the right temple.”  “Then the wound on the temple was not done with the revolver?”  “The paper doesn’t say it was, and I don’t think it was; because logically it appears to me that the revolver was used by Mademoiselle Stangerson against the assassin. Now, what weapon did the murderer use? The blow on the temple seems to show that the murderer wished to stun Mademoiselle Stangerson,--after he had unsuccessfully tried to strangle her. He must have known that the attic was inhabited by Daddy Jacques, and that was one of the reasons, I think, why he must have used a quiet weapon,--a life-preserver, or a hammer.”  “All that doesn’t explain how the murderer got out of “The Yellow Room”,”  I observed.  “Evidently,” replied Rouletabille, rising, “and that is what has to be explained. I am going to the Chateau du Glandier, and have come to see whether you will go with me.”  “I?--”  “Yes, my boy. I want you. The ‘Epoque’ has definitely entrusted this case to me, and I must clear it up as quickly as possible.”  “But in what way can I be of any use to you?”  “Monsieur Robert Darzac is at the Chateau du Glandier.”  “That’s true. His despair must be boundless.”  “I must have a talk with him.”  Rouletabille said it in a tone that surprised me.  “Is it because--you think there is something to be got out of him?” I asked.  “Yes.”  That was all he would say. He retired to my sitting-room, begging me to dress quickly.  I knew Monsieur Robert Darzac from having been of great service to him in a civil action, while I was acting as secretary to Maitre Barbet Delatour. Monsieur Robert Darzac, who was at that time about forty years of age, was a professor of physics at the Sorbonne. He was intimately acquainted with the Stangersons, and, after an assiduous seven years’ courtship of the daughter, had been on the point of marrying her. In spite of the fact that she has become, as the phrase goes, “a person of a certain age,” she was still remarkably good-looking. While I was dressing I called out to Rouletabille, who was impatiently moving about my sitting-room:  “Have you any idea as to the murderer’s station in life?”  “Yes,” he replied; “I think if he isn’t a man in society, he is, at least, a man belonging to the upper class. But that, again, is only an impression.”  “What has led you to form it?”  “Well,--the greasy cap, the common handkerchief, and the marks of the rough boots on the floor,” he replied.  “I understand,” I said; “murderers don’t leave traces behind them which tell the truth.”  “We shall make something out of you yet, my dear Sainclair,” concluded Rouletabille.     CHAPTER III. “A Man Has"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16855"],["title","The Land of Mystery (#1)"],["body","Professor, three natives were seen standing on the very spot where they themselves had stood a brief while before, evidently scrutinizing the white strangers with profound wonder and curiosity.  They were dressed similarly to Bippo, Pedros and Quincal--that is, with only a piece of cloth around the loins--but they displayed a marked contrast in other respects.  They were taller, more athletic, with immense bushy heads of hair, enormous rings in their ears, while the hue of their skins was almost as dark as that of the native African.  One carried a long-bow and a bundle of arrows strapped behind his shoulders, while the others were armed simply with javelins or spears.  \"Those fellows mean fight,\" added Long.  \"No doubt of it,\" replied the Professor.  \"But a Winchester will reach further than their arrows and spears, even if they are tipped with poison.\"  \"Possibly they may be friendly, if they can be convinced that we intend them no harm, and you know what an advantage it will be to us if able to trust all the natives on our return.\"  Long could not share the confidence of his companion and favored a direct advance down the bank toward the savages.  If the latter preserved their armed neutrality, all would be well enough, but at the first sign of hostility he advocated opening fire on them.  Perhaps he was right in the declaration that anything like timidity in dealing with savages is the worst possible course.  While the rights of every barbarian should be respected, it is all important that he should know that such concession is made not through fear, but because the superior party wishes to be just and merciful.  The natives stood as motionless as statues for several minutes, during which the white men scrutinized them with an interest that may be imagined.  The first and most natural thought of our friends was that an encounter could be avoided by entering the forest on the right and passing round the savages, who, it was quite apparent, intended to dispute their return; but if such was really their purpose, they would have little trouble in heading off the whites in the dense wood, beside which, for the weighty reasons already named, it would have been exceedingly unwise to act as though afraid of the dusky natives.  Despite Long's protest, the Professor decided to make a friendly advance, being vigilantly on his guard at the same time for the first offensive move of the savages.  He carried his Winchester in one hand, while he rested the other on his revolver.  He was determined, while hoping for comity, to be prepared for hostility or treachery.  Long was so dissatisfied with the looks of things, that he followed his friend a few paces, then halting with his Winchester ready for any emergency, and certain in his own mind that a sharp fight was inevitable.  The approach of the white man was evidently a surprise to the savages. The middle one, who held the long-bow and arrows, fell back several paces, as if about to break into flight or dart among the trees so invitingly near, but something must have been said by his companions to check him, for he stopped abruptly, and not only came back to his first position, but advanced a couple of paces beyond.  The noise from the rapids prevented the Professor hearing their voices, though the unusually clear moonlight told him that some utterance had passed between them.  The first ominous act on the part of the natives was by this archer, who deliberately drew an arrow from over his shoulder and fitted it against the string of his bow.  The fact that the missile was undoubtedly coated at the end with a virus more deadly than that of the rattlesnake or cobra was enough to render the would-be friend uncomfortable and to increase his alertness.  At the same time that the archer went through this significant preliminary, his companions shifted their grasp upon their javelins in a manner that was equally suggestive.  While carrying these primitive weapons, the fingers closed around the centre of gravity, that naturally being more convenient, but when about to hurl them, the hand was shoved further toward the head.  Both natives thus shifted their right hands, though, they still held them horizontal at their thighs, from which position they could be brought aloft in the twinkling of an eye.  The white man walked slowly.  The left hand, which supported his rifle, remained motionless, but removing the right from his revolver, he continued making signs, whose friendly meaning was so obvious that it was impossible for the natives to mistake it.  While approaching in this guarded manner, he Studied them with the closest scrutiny.  Interesting under any circumstances, they were vastly more so at this time.  What struck him in addition to the characteristics already named, were their frowsy eyebrows and glittering coal-black eyes.  These were unusually large and protruding. The noses, instead of being broad and flat, like those of the native Africans, were Roman in shape.  The mouths were wide, and, when they spoke, he observed that the teeth which were displayed were black, showing that a fashion prevailed among this unknown tribe similar to that in vogue among many of the natives in the East Indies.  Now, Professor Grimcke was too experienced an explorer to walk directly into danger, where there was no prospect of avoiding a desperate encounter.  While eager to make friends with all the people whom he met, he did not intend to assume any unnecessary risks.  The demeanor of the natives tendered it certain they were hostile.  They made no responsive signs to those of the white man, and the latter would have checked himself half way, but for his suspicion that they were mystified by his conduct and were undecided as to the precise thing to do.  He not only heard their peculiar rumbling voices, but saw from the movements of their lips and their glances in each other's faces, that they were consulting as to what they should do.  The white man was already so close that he could easily be reached by the bowman, and there was little doubt that either of the others could hurl his poisoned javelin the intervening distance.  The only way of defeating such a movement was for the white man to secure \"the drop\" on them, but, in one sense that was impossible. Unable to understand the words spoken, they were equally unacquainted with the weapons of the pale face, and would, doubtless pay no heed to the most threatening demonstration on his part.  \"Take my advice and come back,\" called Jared Long; \"keep your face toward them and blaze away, and I'll do my part!\"  Instead of adopting the suggestion of his friend, the Professor slowed his pace, still making his gestures of good will.  However, when fifty steps away, he came to a dead halt.  He had advanced three-fourths the distance, and, if the others were willing to accept his offers, they should signify it by coming forward and meeting him where he had stopped.  While moving forward in this guarded manner, Grimcke was prudent enough to edge over toward the woods, which were now so close to his right side as to be instantly available.  When he came to a stop also it was near the trunk of a large tree, no more than a yard distant.  \"The Professor is cunning,\" reflected Jared Long, watching every movement; \"he'll whisk behind the tree the instant one of them makes a move.  Helloa! what's up now?\"  To the astonishment of both white men the native with the bow shifted it at this moment to his right hand, holding the arrow in place against the string with the same hand, while the weapon was at his side.  Then he moved a step or two, as if to meet the stranger.  \"Look out!\" called the vigilant New Englander, \"that chap is up to some deviltry.\"  He did not refer to him with the bow and arrow, but to one of the others, who stealthily turned aside and vanished among the trees. Being in the Professor's line of vision the latter observed the suspicious movement, and it cannot be said that it added to his comfort.  Meanwhile the archer advanced, but with such tardy step that it was evident he was timing his pace to that of his comrade who had so stealthily entered the wood.  Convinced that his real peril lay among those trees, Grimcke began a backward movement with such caution that he hoped it would not be noticed by the native who was approaching with a sluggish pace.  The forest, like all those in South America, was so dense that great care was necessary for one to pick his way through it.  The Professor's theory was that the savage with the spear would regulate his movements on the theory that the white man would not stir from the place where he had first halted.  He would thus aim to secure a position from which he could hurl his javelin at him without detection.  Grimcke conceived this was certain to take place, and, if he remained where he was, nothing could save him from the treacherous assault.  It was a matter, therefore, of self preservation that dictated the brief retreat with the hope of thus disconcerting the savage.  The task which Grimcke had given himself was difficult indeed.  The ground was unfavorable for the peculiar twitching movement which he hoped would carry him out of danger.  He had gone barely a couple of yards when the bowman evidently suspected something of the kind, for he stopped short and stared inquiringly at the white man.  The latter extended his right hand as if to shake that of the savage, who stood motionless, making no sign of pleasure or displeasure. Indeed, he remained so fixed in his position that Grimcke was convinced he was listening for the sound of the other miscreant stealing through the wood.  He plainly saw the black eyes cast a single inquiring glance in that direction.  \"This is getting a little too threatening,\" reflected the Professor, satisfied that the three natives were as venomous as so many serpents; \"at the first move war is declared.\"  His situation was so critical that he did not dare turn"]]]
