Happy for him then,—happy both for him and her,—if they remembered that there was a path to heaven, as well from this heathen wilderness as from the Christian land whence they had come. And so, in one short month from her arrival, the gentle Lady Arbella faded away and died. They dug a grave for her in the new soil, where the roots of the pine trees impeded their spades; and when her bones had rested there nearly two hundred years, and a city had sprung up around them, a church of stone was built upon the spot.    Charley, almost at the commencement of the foregoing narrative, had galloped away with a prodigious clatter, upon Grandfather’s stick, and was not yet returned. So large a boy should have been ashamed to ride upon a stick. But Laurence and Clara had listened attentively, and were affected by this true story of the gentle lady, who had come so far to die so soon. Grandfather had supposed that little Alice was asleep, but, towards the close of the story, happening to look down upon her, he saw that her blue eyes were wide open, and fixed earnestly upon his face. The tears had gathered in them, like dew upon a delicate flower; but when Grandfather ceased to speak, the sunshine of her smile broke forth again.  \"O, the lady must have been so glad to get to heaven!\" exclaimed little Alice.  \"Grandfather, what became of Mr. Johnson?\" asked Clara.  \"His heart appears to have been quite broken,\" answered Grandfather; \"for he died at Boston within a month after the death of his wife. He was buried in the very same tract of ground, where he had intended to build a dwelling for Lady Arbella and himself. Where their house would have stood there was his grave.  \"I never heard any thing so melancholy!\" said Clara.  \"The people loved and respected Mr. Johnson so much,\" continued Grandfather, \"that it was the last request of many of them, when they died, that they might be buried as near as possible to this good man’s grave. And so the field became the first burial-ground in Boston. When you pass through Tremont street, along by King’s Chapel, you see a burial-ground, containing many old grave-stones and monuments. That was Mr. Johnson’s field.\"  \"How sad is the thought,\" observed Clara, \"that one of the first things which the settlers had to do, when they came to the new world, was to set apart a burial-ground!\"  \"Perhaps,\" said Laurence, \"if they had found no need of burial-grounds here, they would have been glad, after a few years, to go back to England.\"  Grandfather looked at Laurence, to discover whether he knew how profound and true a thing he had said.     Chapter III   Not long after Grandfather had told the story of his great chair, there chanced to be a rainy day. Our friend Charley, after disturbing the household with beat of drum and riotous shouts, races up and down the staircase, overturning of chairs, and much other uproar, began to feel the quiet and confinement within doors intolerable. But as the rain came down in a flood, the little fellow was hopelessly a prisoner, and now stood with sullen aspect at a window, wondering whether the sun itself were not extinguished by so much moisture in the sky.  Charley had already exhausted the less eager activity of the other children; and they had betaken themselves to occupations that did not admit of his companionship. Laurence sat in a recess near the book-case, reading, not for the first time, the Midsummer Night’s Dream. Clara was making a rosary of beads for a little figure of a Sister of Charity, who was to attend the Bunker Hill Fair, and lend her aid in erecting the Monument. Little Alice sat on Grandfather’s foot-stool, with a picture-book in her hand; and, for every picture, the child was telling Grandfather a story. She did not read from the book, (for little Alice had not much skill in reading,) but told the story out of her own heart and mind.  Charley was too big a boy, of course, to care any thing about little Alice’s stories, although Grandfather appeared to listen with a good deal of interest. Often, in a young child’s ideas and fancies, there is something which it requires the thought of a lifetime to comprehend. But Charley was of opinion, that if a story must be told, it had better be told by Grandfather, than little Alice.  \"Grandfather, I want to hear more about your chair,\" said he.  Now Grandfather remembered that Charley had galloped away upon a stick, in the midst of the narrative of poor Lady Arbella, and I know not whether he would have thought it worth while to tell another story, merely to gratify such an inattentive auditor as Charley. But Laurence laid down his book and seconded the request. Clara drew her chair nearer to Grandfather, and little Alice immediately closed her picture-book, and looked up into his face. Grandfather had not the heart to disappoint them.  He mentioned several persons who had a share in the settlement of our country, and who would be well worthy of remembrance, if we could find room to tell about them all. Among the rest, Grandfather spoke of the famous Hugh Peters, a minister of the gospel, who did much good to the inhabitants of Salem. Mr. Peters afterwards went back to England, and was chaplain to Oliver Cromwell; but Grandfather did not tell the children what became of this upright and zealous man, at last. In fact, his auditors were growing impatient to hear more about the history of the chair.  \"After the death of Mr. Johnson,\" said he, \"Grandfather’s chair came into the possession of Roger Williams. He was a clergyman, who arrived at Salem, and settled there in 1631. Doubtless the good man has spent many a studious hour in this old chair, either penning a sermon, or reading some abstruse book of theology, till midnight came upon him unawares. At that period, as there were few lamps or candles to be had, people used to read or work by the light of pitchpine torches. These supplied the place of the \"midnight oil,\" to the learned men of New England.\"  Grandfather went on to talk about Roger Williams, and told the children several particulars, which we have not room to repeat. One incident, however, which was connected with his life, must be related, because it will give the reader an idea of the opinions and feelings of the first settlers of New England. It was as follows:    THE RED CROSS   While Roger Williams sat in Grandfather’s chair, at his humble residence in Salem, John Endicott would often come to visit him. As the clergy had great influence in temporal concerns, the minister and magistrate would talk over the occurrences of the day, and consult how the people might be governed according to scriptural laws.  One thing especially troubled them both. In the old national banner of England, under which her soldiers have fought for hundreds of years, there is a Red Cross, which has been there ever since the days when England was in subjection to the Pope. The Cross, though a holy symbol, was abhorred by the Puritans, because they considered it a relic of Popish idolatry. Now, whenever the train-band of Salem was mustered, the soldiers, with Endicott at their head, had no other flag to march under than this same old papistical banner of England, with the Red Cross in the midst of it. The banner of the Red Cross, likewise, was flying on the walls of the fort of Salem; and a similar one was displayed in Boston harbor, from the fortress on Castle Island.  \"I profess, brother Williams,\" Captain Endicott would say, after they had been talking of this matter, \"it distresses a Christian man’s heart, to see this idolatrous Cross flying over our heads. A stranger beholding it, would think that we had undergone all our hardships and dangers, by sea and in the wilderness, only to get new dominions for the Pope of Rome.\"  \"Truly, good Mr. Endicott,\" Roger Williams would answer, \"you speak as an honest man and Protestant Christian should. For mine own part, were it my business to draw a sword, I should reckon it sinful to fight under such a banner. Neither can I, in my pulpit, ask the blessing of Heaven upon it.\"  Such, probably, was the way in which Roger Williams and John Endicott used to talk about the banner of the Red Cross. Endicott, who was a prompt and resolute man, soon determined that Massachusetts, if she could not have a banner of her own, should at least be delivered from that of the Pope of Rome.  Not long afterwards there was a military muster at Salem. Every able-bodied man, in the town and neighborhood, was there. All were well armed, with steel caps upon their heads, plates of iron upon their breasts and at their backs, and gorgets of steel around their necks. When the sun shone upon these ranks of iron-clad men, they flashed and blazed with a splendor that bedazzled the wild Indians, who had come out of the woods to gaze at them. The soldiers had long pikes, swords, and muskets, which were fired with matches, and were almost as heavy as a small cannon.  These men had mostly a stern and rigid aspect. To judge by their looks, you might have supposed that there was as much iron in their hearts, as there was upon their heads and breasts. They were all devoted Puritans, and of the same temper as those with whom Oliver Cromwell afterwards overthrew the throne of England. They hated all the relics of Popish superstition as much as Endicott himself; and yet, over their heads, was displayed the banner of the Red Cross.  Endicott was the captain of the company. While the soldiers were expecting his orders to begin their exercise, they saw him take the banner in one hand, holding his drawn sword in the other. Probably he addressed them in a speech, and explained how horrible a thing it was, that men, who had fled from Popish idolatry into the wilderness, should be compelled to fight under its symbols here. Perhaps he concluded his address somewhat in the following style.  \"And now, fellow soldiers, you see this old banner of England.

The money will be sent to you by the gentleman's private secretary once a month, and in return, you will write a letter of acknowledgment once a month.  That is--you are not to thank him for the money; he doesn't care to have that mentioned, but you are to write a letter telling of the progress in your studies and the details of your daily life.  Just such a letter as you would write to your parents if they were living.  'These letters will be addressed to Mr. John Smith and will be sent in care of the secretary.  The gentleman's name is not John Smith, but he prefers to remain unknown.  To you he will never be anything but John Smith.  His reason in requiring the letters is that he thinks nothing so fosters facility in literary expression as letter-writing. Since you have no family with whom to correspond, he desires you to write in this way; also, he wishes to keep track of your progress.  He will never answer your letters, nor in the slightest particular take any notice of them.  He detests letter-writing and does not wish you to become a burden.  If any point should ever arise where an answer would seem to be imperative--such as in the event of your being expelled, which I trust will not occur--you may correspond with Mr. Griggs, his secretary.  These monthly letters are absolutely obligatory on your part; they are the only payment that Mr. Smith requires, so you must be as punctilious in sending them as though it were a bill that you were paying.  I hope that they will always be respectful in tone and will reflect credit on your training.  You must remember that you are writing to a Trustee of the John Grier Home.'  Jerusha's eyes longingly sought the door.  Her head was in a whirl of excitement, and she wished only to escape from Mrs. Lippett's platitudes and think.  She rose and took a tentative step backwards. Mrs. Lippett detained her with a gesture; it was an oratorical opportunity not to be slighted.  'I trust that you are properly grateful for this very rare good fortune that has befallen you?  Not many girls in your position ever have such an opportunity to rise in the world.  You must always remember--'  'I--yes, ma'am, thank you.  I think, if that's all, I must go and sew a patch on Freddie Perkins's trousers.'  The door closed behind her, and Mrs. Lippett watched it with dropped jaw, her peroration in mid-air.     The Letters of  Miss Jerusha Abbott  to  Mr. Daddy-Long-Legs Smith                                      215 FERGUSSEN HALL                                            24th September  Dear Kind-Trustee-Who-Sends-Orphans-to-College,  Here I am!  I travelled yesterday for four hours in a train.  It's a funny sensation, isn't it?  I never rode in one before.  College is the biggest, most bewildering place--I get lost whenever I leave my room.  I will write you a description later when I'm feeling less muddled; also I will tell you about my lessons.  Classes don't begin until Monday morning, and this is Saturday night.  But I wanted to write a letter first just to get acquainted.  It seems queer to be writing letters to somebody you don't know.  It seems queer for me to be writing letters at all--I've never written more than three or four in my life, so please overlook it if these are not a model kind.  Before leaving yesterday morning, Mrs. Lippett and I had a very serious talk.  She told me how to behave all the rest of my life, and especially how to behave towards the kind gentleman who is doing so much for me.  I must take care to be Very Respectful.  But how can one be very respectful to a person who wishes to be called John Smith?  Why couldn't you have picked out a name with a little personality?  I might as well write letters to Dear Hitching-Post or Dear Clothes-Prop.  I have been thinking about you a great deal this summer; having somebody take an interest in me after all these years makes me feel as though I had found a sort of family.  It seems as though I belonged to somebody now, and it's a very comfortable sensation.  I must say, however, that when I think about you, my imagination has very little to work upon.  There are just three things that I know:  I. You are tall.  II.  You are rich.  III.  You hate girls.  I suppose I might call you Dear Mr. Girl-Hater. Only that's rather insulting to me.  Or Dear Mr. Rich-Man, but that's insulting to you, as though money were the only important thing about you.  Besides, being rich is such a very external quality.  Maybe you won't stay rich all your life; lots of very clever men get smashed up in Wall Street.  But at least you will stay tall all your life!  So I've decided to call you Dear Daddy-Long-Legs. I hope you won't mind.  It's just a private pet name we won't tell Mrs. Lippett.  The ten o'clock bell is going to ring in two minutes.  Our day is divided into sections by bells.  We eat and sleep and study by bells. It's very enlivening; I feel like a fire horse all of the time.  There it goes!  Lights out.  Good night.  Observe with what precision I obey rules--due to my training in the John Grier Home.             Yours most respectfully,                                        Jerusha Abbott     To Mr. Daddy-Long-Legs Smith                                             1st October  Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,  I love college and I love you for sending me--I'm very, very happy, and so excited every moment of the time that I can scarcely sleep.  You can't imagine how different it is from the John Grier Home.  I never dreamed there was such a place in the world.  I'm feeling sorry for everybody who isn't a girl and who can't come here; I am sure the college you attended when you were a boy couldn't have been so nice.  My room is up in a tower that used to be the contagious ward before they built the new infirmary.  There are three other girls on the same floor of the tower--a Senior who wears spectacles and is always asking us please to be a little more quiet, and two Freshmen named Sallie McBride and Julia Rutledge Pendleton.  Sallie has red hair and a turn-up nose and is quite friendly; Julia comes from one of the first families in New York and hasn't noticed me yet.  They room together and the Senior and I have singles.  Usually Freshmen can't get singles; they are very scarce, but I got one without even asking.  I suppose the registrar didn't think it would be right to ask a properly brought-up girl to room with a foundling.  You see there are advantages!  My room is on the north-west corner with two windows and a view.  After you've lived in a ward for eighteen years with twenty room-mates, it is restful to be alone.  This is the first chance I've ever had to get acquainted with Jerusha Abbott.  I think I'm going to like her.  Do you think you are?                                              Tuesday  They are organizing the Freshman basket-ball team and there's just a chance that I shall get in it.  I'm little of course, but terribly quick and wiry and tough.  While the others are hopping about in the air, I can dodge under their feet and grab the ball.  It's loads of fun practising--out in the athletic field in the afternoon with the trees all red and yellow and the air full of the smell of burning leaves, and everybody laughing and shouting.  These are the happiest girls I ever saw--and I am the happiest of all!  I meant to write a long letter and tell you all the things I'm learning (Mrs. Lippett said you wanted to know), but 7th hour has just rung, and in ten minutes I'm due at the athletic field in gymnasium clothes. Don't you hope I'll get in the team?                                 Yours always,                                            Jerusha Abbott  PS. (9 o'clock.)  Sallie McBride just poked her head in at my door.  This is what she said:  'I'm so homesick that I simply can't stand it.  Do you feel that way?'  I smiled a little and said no; I thought I could pull through.  At least homesickness is one disease that I've escaped!  I never heard of anybody being asylum-sick, did you?                                                    10th October  Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,  Did you ever hear of Michael Angelo?  He was a famous artist who lived in Italy in the Middle Ages. Everybody in English Literature seemed to know about him, and the whole class laughed because I thought he was an archangel.  He sounds like an archangel, doesn't he?  The trouble with college is that you are expected to know such a lot of things you've never learned.  It's very embarrassing at times.  But now, when the girls talk about things that I never heard of, I just keep still and look them up in the encyclopedia.  I made an awful mistake the first day.  Somebody mentioned Maurice Maeterlinck, and I asked if she was a Freshman.  That joke has gone all over college.  But anyway, I'm just as bright in class as any of the others--and brighter than some of them!  Do you care to know how I've furnished my room?  It's a symphony in brown and yellow.  The wall was tinted buff, and I've bought yellow denim curtains and cushions and a mahogany desk (second hand for three dollars) and a rattan chair and a brown rug with an ink spot in the middle.  I stand the chair over the spot.  The windows are up high; you can't look out from an ordinary seat.  But I unscrewed the looking-glass from the back of the bureau, upholstered the top and moved it up against the window.  It's just the right height for a window seat.  You pull out the drawers like steps and walk up. Very comfortable!  Sallie McBride helped me choose the things at the Senior auction.  She has lived in a house all her life and knows about furnishing.  You can't imagine what fun it is to shop and pay with a real five-dollar bill and get some change--when you've never had more than a few cents in your life.  I assure you, Daddy dear, I do appreciate that allowance.  Sallie is the most entertaining person in the world--and Julia Rutledge Pendleton the least so.  It's queer what a mixture the"]]]
