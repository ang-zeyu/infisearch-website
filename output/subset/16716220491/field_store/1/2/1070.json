Ha, ha, ha, the bomb has burst, He loved an automaton.   SPALANZANI (despairingly).    My automaton.   ALL.    An automaton,   Ha, ha, ha, ha!     ACT III.   (In Venice. A gallery, in festival attire, in a palace on the Grand   Canal.)  (The guests of GIULIETTA are grouped about on cushions.)   Barcarole.   GIULIETTA AND NICKLAUSSE (in the wings).  Oh soft night, oh night of love, Smile on our bliss serene, All the stars that shine above Surround the heaven's queen! Time it flies without return, Forgetting our tenderness! Far from thee I'll ever burn, In lonely strait and stress. Passioned zephyrs Waft your caresses, Passioned zephyrs Soft are your kisses. O soft night, oh night of love, Smile on our bliss serene; All the stars that shine above Surround the heaven's queen.  (Giulietta and Nicklausse enter.)   HOFFMAN.  For me, by Jove, that is not what's enchanting! At the feet of the beauty who gives us joy Does pleasure sigh? No, with laughing mouth no sorrows 'ere descanting.   BACCHIC SONG.  Friends... love tender with terror,     Error! Love in noise and wine!     Divine That a burning desire Your heart enflames In the fevers of pleasure Consume your soul! Transports of love, Last a day To the devil he who weeps For two soft eyes, To us the better bliss Of joyous cries! Let's live a day In heaven.   THE CHORUS.  To the devil whoever weeps For two soft eyes! To us the better bliss Of joyous song We'll live a day In Heaven!   HOFFMAN.  The sky lends you its brightness,     Beauty, But you hide in hearts of steel,     Hell! Bliss of paradise Where love meets, Oaths, cursed spirits,     Dreams of life!     Oh chastity,     Oh purity,       Lies!   THE CHORUS.  To the devil those who weep,     etc., etc.   SCHLEMIL (entering).    I see all is joy. Congratulations, madame.   GUILIETTA.    What! Why, I've wept for you three whole days.   PITICHINACCIO.    Good.   SCHLEMIL (to Pitichinaccio).    Microbe!   PITICHINACCIO.    Hola!   GIULIETTA.  Calm yourselves! We have a strange poet among us.  (Presenting) Hoffman!   SCHLEMIL (with bad grace).    Monsieur!   HOFFMAN.    Monsieur!   GIULIETTA (to Schlemil).    Smile on us, I beg, And come take your place At pharaoh!   THE CHORUS.    Bravo! To pharaoh!  (Giulietta after having invited all to follow her, goes toward door.   Hoffman offers his hand to Giulietta. Schlemil comes between.)   SCHLEMIL (taking Giulietta's hand).    By heavens!   GIULETTA.    To the game, gentlemen, to the game!   THE CHORUS.    To the game, the game!  (All go out except Hoffman and Nicklausse.)   NICKLAUSSE.  One word! I have two horses saddled. At the first dream That Hoffman permits himself, I carry him off.   HOFFMAN.  And what dream ever could be born By such realities? Does one love a courtezan?   NICKLAUSSE.    Yet this Schlemil...   HOFFMAN.   I am not Schlemil.   NICKLAUSSE.    Take care, the devil is clever.  DAPERTUTTO (appears at back).   HOFFMAN.  Were it so, If he makes me love her, may he damn me, Come!   NICKLAUSSE.    Let us go.  (They go out.)   DAPERTUTTO (alone).  Yes!... to fight you. The eyes of Giulietta are a sure weapon, It needed that Schlemil fail, Faith of captain and soldier, You'll do like him. I will that Giulietta shall use sorcery on you.  (Drawing from his finger a ring with a big sparkling diamond.)  Turn, turn, mirror, where the lark is caught, Sparkle diamond, fascinate, draw her...   The lark or the woman   To this conquering bait   Comes with wing or with heart; One leaves her life, the other her soul. Turn, turn, mirror where the lark is caught. Sparkle, diamond, fascinate, attract her.  (Giulietta appears and advances fascinated toward the diamond that   Dapertutto holds towards her.)    DAPERTUTTO (placing the ring on Giuliettas finger).   GIULIETTA.    What do you await from your servant?   DAPERTUTTO.  Good, you have divined At seducing hearts above all others wise, You have given me The shade of Schlemil! I vary My pleasures and I pray you To get for me to-day The reflection of Hoffman!   GIULIETTA.    What! his reflection.   DAPERTUTTO.    Yes. His reflection! You doubt The power of your eyes?   GIULIETTA.    No.   DAPERTUTTO.  Who knows. Your Hoffman dreams, perhaps better. (Severely) Yes, I was there, a while back, listening. (With irony) He defies you...   GIULIETTA.  Hoffman? 'tis well!... From this day I'll make him my plaything.  (Hoffman enters.)   DAPERTUTTO.    'Tis he!  (Dapertutto goes out. Hoffman intends to do the same.)   GIULIETTA (to Hoffman).    You leave me.   HOFFMAN (mockingly).    I have lost everything.   GIULIETTA.  What? you too... Ah, you do me wrong. Without pity, without mercy, Go!... Go!...   HOFFMAN.  Your tears betrayed you. Ah! I love you... even at the price of my life.   GIULIETTA.  Ah, unfortunate, but you do not know That an hour, a moment, may prove fatal? That my love will cost your life if you remain? That Schlemil, this night, may strike you in my arms?   Listen to my prayer;   My life is wholly yours. Everywhere I promise to accompany your steps.   HOFFMAN.  Ye gods with what bliss ye fire my heart? Like a concert divine your voice does move me; With a fire soft yet burning my being is devoured; Your glances in mine have spent their flame, Like radiant stars And I feel, my well beloved, Pass your perfumed breath On my lips and on my eyes.   GIULIETTA.  Yet, to-day, strengthen my courage By leaving me something of you!   HOFFMAN.    What do you mean?   GIULIETTA.   Listen and don't laugh at me.  (She takes Hoffman in her arms and finds a mirror.)  What I want is your faithful image, To reproduce your features, your look, your visage, The reflection that I see above me bend.   HOFFMAN.   My reflection? What folly!   GIULIETTA.    No! for it can detach itself From the polished glass And come quite whole in my heart to hide.   HOFFMAN.    In your heart?   GIULIETTA.  In my heart. 'Tis I who beg thee, Hoffman, give me my wish.   HOFFMAN.    My reflection?   GIULIETTA.  Your reflection. Yes, wisdom or folly, I await, I demand.  (Ensemble.)   HOFFMAN.  Ecstasy, unappeased bliss, Strange and soft terror, My reflection, my soul, my life To you, always to you!   GIULIETTA.  If your presence I lose, I would keep of you Your reflection, your soul, your life; Dear one, give them me.   GIULIETTA (suddenly).    Schlemil!  (Schlemil enters followed by Nicklausse, Dapertutto, Pittichinaccio and   others.)   SCHLEMIL.  I was sure of it! Together! Come, gentlemen, come, 'Tis for Hoffman, it seems to me That we are abandoned.  (Ironic laughter.)   HOFFMAN.    Monsieur!   GIULIETTA (to Hoffman).    Silence!    (Aside) I love you, he has my key.   PITICHINACCIO (to Schlemil).    Let us kill him.   SCHLEMIL.    Patience!   DAPERTUTTO (to Hoffman).    How pale you are!   HOFFMAN.    Me!   DAPERTUTTO (showing him a mirror).    See rather.   HOFFMAN (amazed).    Heavens!   GIULIETTA.  Listen, gentlemen, Here come the gondolas, The hour of barcaroles And of farewells!  (Schlemil conducts the guests out. Giulietta goes away throwing a look   at Hoffman. Dapertutto remains. Nicklausse goes toward Hoffman.)   NICKLAUSSE.    Are you coming?   HOFFMAN.    Not yet.   NICKLAUSSE.    Why? Very well. I understand, Good-by.    (Aside). But I'll watch over him.  (He goes out.)   SCHLEMIL.    What do you wait for?    HOFFMAN.    That you give me a certain key I've sworn to have.   SCHLEMIL.    You shall have this key, sir, only with my life.   HOFFMAN.    Then I shall have one and the other.   SCHLEMIL.    That remains to be seen. On guard!   DAPERTUTTO.    You have no sword (presenting his own). Take mine!   HOFFMAN.    Thank you.   CHORUS (in the wings).  Sweet night, oh night of love, Smile on our bliss serene When the stars that shine above Greet the heaven'ly Queen.  (Hoffman and Schlemil fight. Schlemil falls mortally wounded. Hoffman   bends and takes the key from around his neck. He rushes to Giulietta's   room. Giulietta appears in a gondola.)   HOFFMAN (coming back).    No one.   GIULIETTA (laughing).    Ha, ha, ha!  (Hoffmann is in a stupor looking at Giulietta.)   DAPERTUTTO (to Giulietta).    What will you do with him now?   GIULIETTA.    I'll turn him over to you.   PITICHINACCIO (entering the gondola)    Dear angel.  (Giulietta takes him in her arms.)   HOFFMAN (comprehending the infamy of Giulietta).    Vile wretch!   NICKLAUSSE.    Hoffman! Hoffman--the police!  (Nicklausse drags Hoffmann away. Giulietta and Pitichinaccia laugh.)     ACT IV.   (At Munich at CRESPEL'S. A room furnished in a bizarre fashion.)   ANTONIA (alone. She is seated at the clavichord).  She has fled, the dove She has fled far from thee!  (She stops and rises.)  Ah memory too sweet, image too cruel! Alas at my knees I hear, I see him! She has fled, the dove. She has fled far from thee; She is faithful ever, And she keeps her troth. Beloved, my voice calls thee, All my heart is thine.  (She approaches the clavichord again.)  Dear flower but now open, In pity answer me, Thou that knowest if still he loves me, If he keeps his troth. Beloved my voice implores thee. May thy heart come to me.  (She falls in a chair.)   CRESPEL (entering suddenly).  Unhappy child, beloved daughter, You promised to no longer sing.   ANTONIA.  My mother in me lived again; My heart while singing thought it heard her.   CRESPEL.  There is my torment. Thy loved mother Left thee her voice. Vain regrets! Through thee I hear her. No, no, I beg...   ANTONIA (sadly).    Your Antonia will sing no more!  (She goes out slowly.)   CRESPEL (alone).  Despair! A little while again I saw those spots of fire Mark her face. God! Must I lose her I adore? Ah, that Hoffman... 'tis he Who put in her heart this craze. I fled Far as Munich...  (Enter Frantz.)   CRESPEL.    You, Frantz, open to nobody.   FRANTZ (false exit).    You think so...   CRESPEL.    Where are you going?   FRANTZ.  I'm going to see if anybody rang. As you said...   CRESPEL.  I said, Open to nobody.

The nephew hesitated a moment, and the question was repeated with more sternness.  \"Robert Shuffles; Isaac Monroe was with him, but he didn't take any of the peaches.\"  \"What is the matter with your head, Harry?\" asked his uncle, when he observed him rubbing the place where the blow had fallen.  \"Shuffles struck me and knocked me down, when I called out for you.\"  \"Did he? Where is he now?\"  \"He and Monroe ran up the walk to the back of the garden.\"  \"That boy shall be taken care of,\" continued Mr. Lowington, as he walked up the path towards the point where the marauders had entered. \"The Academy is fast becoming a nuisance to the neighborhood, because there is neither order nor discipline among the students.\"  The thieves had escaped, and as it would be useless to follow them, Mr. Lowington went back to the house; but he was too much annoyed at the loss of his splendid peaches, which were to figure so prominently before the \"Pomological,\" to permit the matter to drop without further notice.  \"Did he hurt you much, Harry?\" asked Mr. Lowington as they entered the house.  \"Not much, sir, though he gave me a pretty hard crack,\" answered Harry.  \"Did you see them when they came into the garden?\"  \"No, sir? I was fixing my water-wheel in the brook, when I heard them at the tree. I went up, and tried to prevent Shuffles from taking the peaches. I caught hold of him, and pulled him away. He said he couldn't stop to lick me then, but he'd do it within twenty-four hours. Then he hit me when I called for help.\"  \"The young scoundrel! That boy is worse than a pestilence in any neighborhood. Mr. Baird seems to have no control over him.\"  Suddenly, and without any apparent reason, Mr. Lowington's compressed lips and contracted brow relaxed, and his face wore its usual expression of dignified serenity. Harry could not understand the cause of this sudden change; but his uncle's anger had passed away. The fact was, that Mr. Lowington happened to think, while his indignation prompted him to resort to the severest punishment for Shuffles, that he himself had been just such a boy as the plunderer of his cherished fruit. At the age of fifteen he had been the pest of the town in which he resided. His father was a very wealthy man, and resorted to many expedients to cure the boy of his vicious propensities.  Young Lowington had a taste for the sea, and his father finally procured a midshipman's warrant for him to enter the navy. The strict discipline of a ship of war proved to be the \"one thing needful\" for the reformation of the wild youth; and he not only became a steady young man, but a hard student and an accomplished officer. The navy made a man of him, as it has of hundreds of the sons of rich men, demoralized by idleness and the absence of a reasonable ambition.  When Mr. Lowington was thirty years old, his father died, leaving to each of his three children a quarter of a million; and he had resigned his position in the navy, in order to take care of his property, and to lead a more domestic life with his wife and daughter than the discipline of the service would permit.  He had taken up his residence in Brockway, the early home of his wife. It was a large town on the sea shore, only a few miles from the metropolis of New England, thus combining all the advantages of a home in the city and in the country. For several years he had been happy in his peaceful retirement. But not wealth, nor even integrity and piety, can bar the door of the lofty mansion against the Destroyer of the race. His wife died of an hereditary disease, which gave no indication of its presence till she had passed her thirtieth year. Two years later, his daughter, just blooming into maturity, followed her mother down to the silent tomb, stricken in her freshness and beauty by the same insidious malady.  The husband and father was left desolate. His purest and fondest hopes were blighted; but, while he was submissive to the will of the Father, who doeth all things well, he became gloomy and sad. He was not seen to smile for a year after the death of his daughter, and it was three years before he had recovered even the outward semblance of his former cheerfulness. He was rich, but alone in the world. He continued to reside in the home which was endeared to him by the memories of his loved and lost ones.  When his wife's sister died in poverty, leaving two children, he had taken them to his home, and had become a father to them. Harry Martyn was a good boy, and Josephine Martyn was a good girl; but they were not his own children. There was something wanting--an aching void which they could not fill, though Mr. Lowington was to them all that could be asked or expected of a parent.  Mr. Lowington busied himself in various studies and experiments; but life had ceased to be what it was before the death of his wife and daughter. He wanted more mental occupation; he felt the need of greater activity, and he was tempted to return to the navy, even after his absence of ten years from the service; but this step, for many reasons, was not practicable. At the time when his garden was invaded by the vandal students from the Brockway Academy, he was still thinking what he could do to save himself from the inglorious life of ease he was leading, and, at the same time, serve his country and his race.  Shuffles had robbed his garden of some of his choicest fruit; had struck his nephew a severe blow on the head, and threatened to inflict still greater chastisement upon him in the future. Mr. Lowington was justly indignant; and his own peace and the peace of the neighborhood demanded that the author of the mischief should be punished, especially as he was an old transgressor. It was absolutely necessary that something should be done, and the retired naval officer was in the right frame of mind to do it. Just then, when he was wrought up to the highest pitch of indignation, his anger vanished. Shuffles at sixteen was the counterpart of himself at fifteen.  This was certainly no reason why the hand of justice should be stayed. Mr. Lowington did not intend to stay it, though the thought of his own juvenile depravity modified his view, and appeased his wrath. He put on his hat and left the house. He walked over to the Academy, and being shown to the office of the principal, he informed him of the depredations committed in his garden.  \"Who did it, Mr. Lowington?\" demanded the principal, with proper indignation in his tones and his looks.  \"Shuffles.\"  \"I need not have asked. That boy gives me more trouble than all the others put together,\" added Mr. Baird, with an anxious expression. \"And yet what can I do with him?\"  \"Expel him,\" replied Mr. Lowington, laconically.  \"I don't like to do that.\"  \"Why not?\"  \"It would be an injury to me.\"  \"Why so?\"  \"It would offend his father, who is a person of wealth and influence. When Shuffles came to Brockway ten other boys came with him. He was expelled from another institution, which so incensed his father that he induced the parents of ten others to take their sons out, and send them to me. If I expel Shuffles, I shall lose about a dozen of my students, and I can't afford to do that.\"  \"But must the neighborhood suffer from his depredations?\"  \"I will talk with the boy; I will keep him in his room for a week.\"  \"I'm afraid the boy needs severer measures. If this were the first, or even the third time, I would, not say so much.\"  \"My dear sir, what can I do?\"  \"The boy needs strict discipline. If I were still in the navy, and had him aboard my ship, I could make a man of him.\"  \"I don't think anything can be done.\"  \"Something must be done, Mr. Baird. My garden shall not be robbed with impunity.\"  \"I will do what I can, Mr. Lowington.\"  But the owner of the stolen fruit was by this time satisfied that nothing would be done. The principal of the Brockway Academy had not force nor influence enough to control such a boy as Shuffles. Mr. Lowington took his leave, determined to apply to another tribunal for the correction of the evil. That night the peach thieves were arrested, and put in the lock-up. The next day they were tried, found guilty, and sentenced to pay a fine and costs, which Mr. Baird promptly paid. Within a week Mr. Lowington's stable was burned to the ground. Shuffles was seen near the building just before the fire broke out; but it could not be proved that he was the incendiary, though no one doubted the fact. He was arrested, but discharged on the examination.  \"You see how it is, Mr. Lowington,\" said the principal of the Academy, as the two gentlemen met after the examination. \"It would have been better for you if you had not prosecuted the boy for stealing the peaches.\"  \"I don't think so,\" replied Mr. Lowington. \"I must do my duty, without regard to consequences; and you will pardon me if I say you ought to do the same.\"  \"If I expel the boy he would burn the house over my head.\"  \"Then you think he burned my stable?\"  \"I don't know; it cannot be proved that he did.\"  \"I have no doubt of the fact. I have no ill will against the boy. I only desire to protect myself and my neighbors from his depredations.\"  \"I think you were very unfortunate in the method you adopted, Mr. Lowington,\" replied the principal of the Academy. \"It has reacted upon yourself.\"  \"Shall this boy steal my fruit and burn my buildings with impunity?\" added Mr. Lowington, with considerable warmth.  \"Certainly not.\"  \"I applied to you for redress, Mr. Baird.\"  \"I told you I would talk with the boy.\"  \"Such a reprobate as that needs something more than talk.\"  \"What would you do with him, sir?\" demanded Mr. Baird, earnestly.  \"I hardly know. I should certainly have expelled him; but that, while it protects the Academy, does not benefit the boy.\"  \"It would only harden the boy.\"  \"Very likely; and his remaining will harden a dozen more by his influence. Mr. Baird, I shall be obliged to take my nephew"]]]
