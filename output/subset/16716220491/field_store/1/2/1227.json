How much more latent talent may now be slumbering from the very same cause which kept Mr. Wattles from publicly revealing his discoveries, viz; want of encouragement--ridicule!  At the time when the idea of taking pictures permanently on paper by means of the camera-obscura first occurred to him, he was but sixteen years of age, and under the instructions of Mr. Charles Le Seuer, (a talented artist from Paris) at the New Harmony school, Indiana. Drawing and painting being the natural bent of his mind, he was frequently employed by the professors to make landscape sketches in the manner mentioned.  The beauty of the image of these landscapes produced on the paper in the camera-obscura, caused him to pause and admire them with all the ardor of a young artist, and wish that by some means, he could fix them there in all their beauty.  From wishing he brought himself to think that it was not only possible but actually capable of accomplishment and from thinking it could, he resolved it should be done.  He was, however, wholly ignorant of even the first principles of chemistry, and natural philosophy, and all the knowledge he was enabled to obtain from his teachers was of very little service to him.  To add to this, whenever he mentioned his hopes to his parents, they laughed at him, and bade him attend to his studies and let such moonshine thoughts alone--still he persevered, though secretly, and he met with the success his perseverance deserved.  For the truth of his statement, Mr. Wattles refers to some of our most respectable citizens residing at the west, and I am in hopes that I shall be enabled to receive in time for this publication, a confirmation from one or more of these gentlemen.  Be that as it may, I feel confident in the integrity of Mr. Wattles, and can give his statement to the world without a doubt of its truth.  The following sketch of his experiments and their results will, undoubtedly, be interesting to every American reader and although some of the profound philosophers of Europe may smile at his method of proceeding, it will in some measure show the innate genius of American minds, and prove that we are not far behind our trans-atlantic brethren in the arts and sciences.  Mr. Wattles says:  \"In my first efforts to effect the desired object, they were feeble indeed, and owing to my limited knowledge of chemistry--wholly acquired by questioning my teachers--I met with repeated failures but following them up with a determined spirit, I at last produced, what I thought very fair samples--but to proceed to my experiments.\"  \"I first dipped a quarter sheet of thin white writing paper in a weak solution of caustic (as I then called it) and dried it in an empty box, to keep it in the dark; when dry, I placed it in the camera and watched it with great patience for nearly half an hour, without producing any visible result; evidently from the solution being to weak.  I then soaked the same piece of paper in a solution of common potash, and then again in caustic water a little stronger than the first, and when dry placed it in the camera.  In about forty-five minutes I plainly percieved the effect, in the gradual darkening of various parts of the view, which was the old stone fort in the rear of the school garden, with the trees, fence, &c.  I then became convinced of the practicability of producing beautiful solar pictures in this way; but, alas! my picture vanished and with it, all--no not all--my hopes.  With renewed determination I began again by studying the nature of the preparation, and came to the conclusion, that if I could destroy the part not acted upon by the light without injuring that which was so acted upon, I could save my pictures.  I then made a strong solution of sal. soda I had in the house, and soaked my paper in it, and then washed it off in hot water, which perfectly fixed the view upon the paper.  This paper was very poor with thick spots, more absorbent than other parts, and consequently made dark shades in the picture where they should not have been; but it was enough to convince me that I had succeeded, and that at some future time, when I had the means and a more extensive knowledge of chemistry, I could apply myself to it again.  I have done so since, at various times, with perfect success; but in every instance laboring under adverse circumstances.\"  I have very recently learned, that, under the present patent laws of the United States, every foreign patentee is required to put his invention, or discovery, into practical use within eighteen months after taking out his papers, or otherwise forfeit his patent.  With regard to Mr. Talbot's Calotype patent, this time has nearly, if not quite expired, and my countrymen are now at perfect liberty to appropriate the art if they feel disposed.  From the statement of Mr. Wattles, it will be perceived that this can be done without dishonor, as in the first instance Mr. Talbot had no positive right to his patent.  Photography; or sun-painting is divided, according to the methods adopted for producing pictures, into    DAGUERREOTYPE, CHROMATYPE,   CALOTYPE,      ENERGIATYPE,   CHRYSOTYPE,    ANTHOTYPE and   CYANOTYPE,     AMPHITYPE.    CHAP. II.  THE THEORY ON LIGHT.--THE PHOTOGRAPHIC PRINCIPLE   Some philosophers contend that to the existence of light alone we owe the beautiful effects produced by the Photogenic art, while others give sufficient reasons for doubting the correctness of the assumption. That the results are effected by a principle associated with light and not by the luminous principle itself, is the most probable conclusion. The importance of a knowledge of this fact becomes most essential in practice, as will presently be seen.  To this principle Mr. Hunt gives the name of ENERGIA.  THE NATURE of Light is not wholly known, but it is generally believed to be matter, as in its motions it obeys the laws regulating matter. So closely is it connected with heat and electricity that there can be little doubt of their all being but different modifications of the same substance.  I will not, however, enter into a statement of the various theories of Philosophers on this head, but content myself with that of Sir Isaac Newton; who supposed rays of light to consist of minute particles of matter, which are constantly emanating from luminous bodies and cause vision, as odoriferous particles, proceeding from certain bodies, cause smelling.  The effects of light upon other bodies, and how light is effected by them, involve some of the most important principles, which if properly understood by Daguerreotypists would enable them to improve and correct many of the practical operations in their art.  These effects we shall exhibit in this and the following chapters.  Before we enter on this subject it will be necessary to become familiar with the  DEFINITIONS of some of the terms used in the science of optics.  Luminous bodies are of two kinds; those which shine by their own light, and those which shine by reflected light.  Transparent bodies are such as permit rays of light to pass through them.  Translucent bodies permit light to pass faintly, but without representing the figure of objects seen through them.  Opaque bodies permit no light to pass through them, but reflect light.  A ray is a line of light.  A beam is a collection of parallel rays.  A pencil is a collection of converging, or diverging rays.  A medium is any space through which light passes.  Incident rays are those which fall upon the surface of a body.  Reflected rays are those which are thrown off from a body.  Parallel rays are such as proceed equally distant from each other through their whole course.  Converging rays are such as approach and tend to unite at any one point, as at b.  Fig. 3.  Diverging rays are those which continue to recede from each other, as at e.  Fig. 3.  A Focus is that point at which converging rays meet.  MOTION OF LIGHT--Rays of light are thrown off from luminous bodies in every direction, but always in straight lines, which cross each other at every point; but the particles of which each ray consists are so minute that the rays do not appear to be impeded by each other.  A ray of light passing through an aperture into a dark room, proceeds in a straight line; a fact of which any one may be convinced by going into a darkened room and admitting light only through a small aperture.  [Illustration: Fig. 1 (hipho_1.gif)]  Light also moves with great velocity, but becomes fainter as it recedes from the source from which it eminates; in other words, diverging rays of light diminish in intensity as the square of the distance increases. For instance let a fig. 1, represent the luminous body from which light proceeds, and suppose three square boards, b. c. d. severally one, four and sixteen square inches in size be placed; b one foot, c two feet, and d four feet from a, it will be perceived that the smallest board b will throw c into shadow; that is, obstruct all rays of light that would otherwise fall on c, and if b were removed c would in like manner hide the light from d--Now, if b recieve as much light as would fall on c whose surface is four times as large, the light must be four times as powerful and sixteen times as powerful as that which would fall on the second and third boards, because the same quantity of light is diffused over a space four and sixteen times greater.  These same rays may be collected and their intensity again increased.  Rays of light are reflected from one surface to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16805"],["title","The Jungle Fugitives: A Tale of Life and Adventure in India (#1)"],["body","be many points that will not feel it.\"  \"That is the true reason,\" said her parent, \"but, confound it!  I have lived in this spot for twenty years; the little town of Akwar lies near, and there is hardly a person in it who has not been my patient. I am known even in Meerut and Delhi, and I can hardly believe the mutineers, for such they seem to be, will harm me or my friends.\"  \"You once told me,\" replied Mary, \"that when an appeal was made to the religion of this people they knew no such thing as fear or mercy.\"  \"And I told you the truth,\" said her father gravely.  \"But since we have weapons and plenty of ammunition, and know how to handle the firearms we shall not be led like lambs to the slaughter.\"  \"That is true enough,\" said Jack, \"but it will be of little avail, when our enemies are numbered by the hundred and perhaps the thousand.\"  \"I take it, then, that you favor an abandonment of our home?\"  \"I do, and with the least possible delay.\"  \"And you, my daughter, are you of the same mind?\"  \"I am,\" was the emphatic response.  \"Then my decision is that we shall start for the interior and stay there until it is safe to show ourselves again among these people, provided it ever shall be safe.\"  \"When shall you start?\"  The parent looked at the sky.  \"It is two or three hours to nightfall.  We will set out early to-morrow morning before the sun is high in the sky.\"  \"But will we not be more liable to discovery?\" asked Jack.  \"Not if we use care.  I am familiar with the country for miles in every direction.  We shall have to travel for the first two or three days through a thick jungle, and it is too dangerous work to undertake in the night-time.  This, you know, is the land of the cobra and the tiger, not to mention a few other animals and reptiles equally unpleasant in their nature.  Last night,\" continued the doctor, \"I saw a glare in the sky off to the westward on the opposite side of the river in the direction of Meerut.  I wonder what it meant?\"  \"By Jove!\" exclaimed Jack, \"that explains something that the palanquin bearer said to me about there being so many Inglese where there are none to-day.  I could not catch his meaning, though he mentioned Meerut.  But he gave me to understand that it was not quite time yet for the uprising, which would come in a few weeks.\"  \"Those things are apt to be precipitated.  I have no doubt that the mutineers burned the city last night.  If so, the main body will hurry to Delhi, which, being the ancient capital of the Mogul Empire, will become the new one.  Some of the rebels may take it into their heads to come in this direction.  What is the matter, Dr. Everson?\"     CHAPTER III.  YANKEE MARKSMANSHIP.  As Jack Everson was seated he faced the broad, sluggish Ganges, with the low, green banks beyond.  He was looking over the water, in the rays of the declining sun, when he saw something that caused him to rise hastily from his seat and peer earnestly across the river toward the opposite shore.  Observing his action, the doctor asked his question.  Both he and his daughter, rising to their feet, gazed in the same direction.  It was easy to see what had attracted the attention of their guest.  A party of horsemen, fully twenty, if not more, in number, had approached the river and were now halted on the other side, looking across in the direction of Dr. Marlowe's home, as if debating the question of making it a visit.  \"Let me get my glass,\" said Mary, starting toward the house, hardly a hundred feet distant.  \"Allow me to bring it,\" interrupted Jack.  \"It is on one of the chairs on the veranda, and I want my rifle.\"  Taking the glass from him on his return, the young woman levelled it at the group of horsemen on the other side.  \"I cannot make out who they are,\" she said, passing the glass to her father.  It took the parent but a few seconds to answer the question.  One sweeping glance told him.  \"They are Ghoojurs,\" he remarked, with as much calmness as he could assume.  \"And who are Ghoojurs?\" asked Jack Everson, less excited than his friends.  \"They belong to the nomadic tribes which originally occupied India, and are among the worst wretches in the world.  They are brigands and robbers, who are to be dreaded at all times.  Now, if the revolt has broken out, they will be as merciless as tigers.\"  \"It looks as if they intended to make us a visit, doctor?\"  \"Alas! there can be no earthly doubt of it.\"  \"Let us hurry into the jungle,\" said Mary, her face paling with fear. \"We have not a minute to waste.\"  \"The advice is good, but before acting on it I should like to make an experiment.\"  During this brief interval Jack Everson had carefully examined his rifle to assure himself that it was in good condition.  \"Heavens, man!\" exclaimed Dr. Marlowe, \"you are not going to try a shot at them?\"  \"That is my intention.\"  \"They are a mile distant!\"  \"One of my medals was won for hitting a target at exactly that distance,\" replied Jack, continuing his preparations.  \"It is impossible that you should succeed.\"  \"But not impossible that I should try, so please don't bother the man at the wheel.\"  \"They have ridden into the water,\" added the young woman, still nervous and excited.  \"Which will serve to shorten the distance somewhat.\"  \"Why not wait until they are halfway across; or, better still, not wait at all?\" inquired the doctor.  Jack Everson made no reply, but, lying down on his back, he slightly separated his raised knees, and, by crossing his ankles, made a rest for the barrel of his rifle.  The left arm was crooked under his head, so as to serve as a pillow or support, leaving the hand to steady the stock of his gun, while the right inclosed the trigger guard.  The horsemen, instead of riding side by side, were strung along in a line, with the leader several paces in advance and mounted on a rather large horse of a coal-black color.  Directly behind him came one upon a bay, while a little further back rode another on a white steed.  There could be no question that they were on their way to kill without mercy.  The situation was intensely trying to father and daughter.  The whole party of Ghoojurs had entered the Ganges and were steadily approaching. The water was so shallow that it could be seen as it splashed about the bodies of the riders, who were talking and laughing, as if in anticipation of the enjoyment awaiting them.  They preserved their single file, like so many American Indians in crossing a stream, and their last thought must have been of any possible danger that could threaten them from the three on the further bank.  The situation was becoming unbearable when the rifle cracked with a noise no louder than a Chinese cracker, and a faint puff of smoke curled upward from the muzzle of the weapon.  At the same moment the Ghoojur at the front, on his black horse, flung up his arms and tumbled sideways into the water, which splashed over his animal's head. Frightened, the horse reared, pawed the air, and, whirling about, galloped back to the bank, sending the water flying in showers from his hoofs.  \"Score me a bull's-eye!\" called Jack Everson, who in his pleasure over his success, could not wait for the result.  \"But see!\" cried Mary, \"you have only infuriated them.  Oh! father, how can we save ourselves?\"     CHAPTER IV.  FLIGHT.  The success of the first shot gave Jack Everson self-confidence and he took less time in aiming the second, which was as unerring as the first.  Another Ghoojur plunged off his horse and gave but a single struggle when he sank from sight in the shallow water.  \"Another bull's-eye!\" called Jack, proceeding to reload his piece.  \"I hope, doctor, you are keeping a correct score; I must have credit for all I do.\"  \"Now for my distinguished friend on the milk-white steed,\" said Jack, proceeding to adjust his telescopic sight to that individual.  \"If they will send over the three horses it will give us one apiece.\"  But the Ghoojurs had had enough of this fearful business.  They saw that some unaccountable fatality was at work and it was madness for them to remain.  With never a suspicion of the truth they wheeled their animals about and sent them galloping for the bank which they had left a short time before full of hope and anticipation.  \"I'm sorry for that,\" reflected Jack Everson, \"for it mixes things and I can't pick out my man, but here goes.\"  In one sense, his opportunity was better than before; for, while he could not select his particular target, he had but to aim at the bunch to make sure of hitting somebody, which is precisely what he did.  The Ghoojur whom he punctured did not fall, for the reason that two of his friends reached out and prevented him.  It was a piece of supererogation on their part, for when the party emerged from the Ganges upon dry land that fellow was of no further account.  Jack now showed more haste than before in reloading his weapon, fearing that the party would get beyond his reach before he could fire for the fourth time.  Much to his regret, they did so, for though he made the shot, it was necessarily so hurried that it inflicted no injury, and the whole party galloped out of sight over the slight swell without showing any further concern for their companions left behind.  Jack now rose to his feet with the question:  \"What is my record, doctor?\"  \"Three bull's-eyes; your score is perfect.\"  \"Hardly, for the last was a miss; however, three out of a possible four is pretty fair when the circumstances are considered.  I suspect that that particular party is not likely to give us further trouble.\"  \"No, they will not forget the lesson.\"  \"If we can induce our enemies to make their approach by the same ford and when the sun is shining this will become truly amusing.\"  \"But the Ghoojurs will not repeat that mistake.  This affair has served another purpose,\" added the physician, \"we must not delay our departure.\"  \"Do you advise our going while it is night?\"  \"I advised the contrary a little while ago,"]]]
