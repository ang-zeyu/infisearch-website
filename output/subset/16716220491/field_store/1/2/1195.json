The little garden far away, the budding apple trees,     The little patch of ground back there, the children at their play,     Perhaps a tiny mound behind the simple church of gray.     The golden thread of courage isn't linked to castle dome     But to the spot, where'er it be--the humble spot called home.      And now the lilacs bud again and all is lovely there,     And homesick soldiers far away know spring is in the air;     The tulips come to bloom again, the grass once more is green,     And every man can see the spot where all his joys have been.     He sees his children smile at him, he hears the bugle call,     And only death can stop him now--he's fighting for them all.             The Flag       We never knew how much the Flag       Could mean, until he went away,     We used to boast of it and brag,       As something of a by-gone day;     But now the Flag can start our tears       In moments of our greatest joy,     Old Glory in the sky appears       The symbol of our little boy.      We knew that sometimes people wept       To see the Flag go waving by,     But never guessed the griefs they kept--       We never understood just why.     But now our eyes grow quickly dim,       Our voices choke with sobs to-day;     The Flag is telling us of him,       Our little boy who's gone away.      We never knew the Flag could be       So much a part of human life,     We thought it beautiful to see       Before these bitter days of strife;     But now more beautiful it gleams,       And deeper in our hearts it dwells;     It is the emblem of our dreams,       For of our little boy it tells.             A Battle Prayer       God of battles, be with us now:       Guard our sons from the lead of shame,       Watch our sons when the cannons flame,     Let them not to a tyrant bow.      God of battles, to Thee we pray:       Be with each loyal son who fights       In the cause of justice and human rights,     Grant him strength and lead the way.      God of battles, our youth we give       To the battle line on a foreign soil,       To conquer hatred and lust and spoil;     Grant that they and their cause shall live.             Good Luck       Good luck! That's all I'm saying, as you sail across the sea;     The best o' luck, in the parting, is the prayer you get from me.     May you never meet a danger that you won't come safely through,     May you never meet a German that can get the best of you;     Oh! A thousand things may happen when a fellow's at the front,     A thousand different mishaps, but here's hoping that they won't.      Good luck! That's all I'm saying, as you turn away to go,     Good luck and plenty of it, may it be your lot to know;     May you never meet rough weather, but remember if you do     That the folks at home are wishing that you'll all come safely through.     Oh! A thousand things may happen when a fellow bears the brunt     Of His Country's fight for glory, but I'm praying that they won't.      Good luck! That's all I'm saying as you're falling into line;     May the splendor of your service bring you everything that's fine;     May the fates deal kindly with you, may you never know distress,     And may every task you tackle end triumphant with success.     Oh! A thousand things may happen that with joy your life will fill;     You may not get all the gladness, but I'm hoping that you will.             A Prayer, 1918       Oh, make us worthy,       God, we pray,     To do thy service       Here to-day;     Endow us with       The strength we need     For every       Sacrificial deed!             The Change       'Twas hard to think that he must go,     We knew that we should miss him so,     We thought that he must always stay     Beside us, laughing, day by day;     That he must never know the care     And hurt and grief of life out there.     Then came the call for youth, and he     Talked with his mother and with me,     And suddenly we learned the boy     Was hungering to know the joy     Of doing something real with life,     And that he craved the test of strife.      And so we steeled ourselves to dread;     To see at night his empty bed;     To feel the silence and the gloom     That hovers o'er his vacant room,     And though we wept the day he went,     And many a lonely hour we've spent,     We've come to think as he, somehow,     And we are more contented now;     We're proud that we can stand and say     We have a boy who's gone away.     And we are glad to know that he     Is serving where he ought to be.      It's queer, the change that time has brought:     We're different now in speech and thought;     His letters home mean joy to us,     His difficulties we discuss.     When word of his promotion came,     His mother, with her eyes aflame     With happiness and pride, rushed out     To tell the neighbors round about.     Her boy! Her boy is doing well!     What greater news can mothers tell?     I think that pity now we show     For those who have no boys to go.             Mothers and Wives       Mothers and wives, 'tis the call to arms       That the bugler yonder prepares to sound;     We stand on the brink of war's alarms       And your men may lie on a blood-stained          ground.     The drums may play and the flags may fly,       And our boys may don the brown and blue,     And the call that summons brave men to die       Is the call for glorious women, too.      Mothers and wives, if the summons comes,       You, as ever since war has been,     Must hear with courage the rolling drums       And dry your tears when the flags are seen.     For never has hero fought and died       Who has braver been than the mother, who     Buckled his saber at his side,       And sent him forward to dare and do.      Mothers and wives, should the call ring out,       It is you must answer your country's cry;     You must furnish brave hearts and stout       For the firing line where the heroes die.     And never a corpse on the field of strife       Should be honored more in his country's sight     Than the noble mother or noble wife       Who sent him forth in the cause of right.      Mothers and wives, 'tis the call for men       To give their strength and to give their lives;     But well we know, such a summons then       Is the call for mothers and loyal wives,     For you must give us the strength we need,       You must give us the boys in blue,     For never a boy or a man shall bleed       But a mother or wife shall suffer, too.             The Call to Service       These are the days when little thoughts       Must cease men's minds to occupy;     The nation needs men's larger creeds,       Big men must answer to her cry;     No longer selfish ways we tread,       The greater task lies just ahead.      These are the days when petty things       By all men must be thrust aside;     The country needs men's finest deeds,       Awakened is the nation's pride;     Men must forsake their selfish strife       Once more to guard their country's life.             Kelly Ingram       His name was Kelly Ingram; he was Alabama's son,     And he whistled \"Yankee Doodle,\" as he stood beside his gun;     There was laughter in his make-up, there was manhood in his face,     And he knew the best traditions and the courage of his race;     Now there's not a heart among us but should swell with loyal pride     When he thinks of Kelly Ingram and the splendid way he died.      On the swift Destroyer Cassin he was merely gunner's mate,     But up there to-day, I fancy, he is standing with the great.     On that grim day last October his position on the craft     Was that portion of the vessel which the sailors christen aft;     There were deep sea bombs beside him to be dropped upon the Hun     Who makes women folks his victims and then gloats o'er what he's done.      From the lookout came a warning; came the cry all sailors fear,     A torpedo was approaching, and the vessel's doom was near;     Ingram saw the streak of danger, but he saw a little more,     A greater menace faced them than that missile had in store;     If those deep sea bombs beside him were not thrown beneath the wave,     Every man aboard the Cassin soon would find a watery grave.      It was death for him to linger, but he figured if he ran     And quit his post of duty, 'twould be death for every man;     So he stood at his position, threw those depth bombs overboard,     And when that torpedo struck them, he went forth to meet his Lord.     Oh, I don't know how to say it, but these whole United States     Should remember Kelly Ingram--he who died to save his mates.             The Joy to Be       Oh, mother, be you brave of heart and keep          your bright eyes shining;     Some day the smiles of joy shall start and you          shall cease repining.     Beyond the dim and distant line the days of          peace are waiting,     When you shall have your soldier fine, and men          shall turn from hating.      Oh, mother, bear the pain a-while, as long ago          you bore it;     You suffered then to win his smile, and you          were happier for it;     And now you suffer once again, and bear your          weight of sorrow;     Yet you shall thrill with gladness when he wins          the glad to-morrow.      Oh, mother, when the cannons roar and all the          brave are fighting,     Remember that the son you bore the wrongs          of earth is righting;     Remember through the hours of pain that he          with all his brothers     Is battling there to win again a happy world          for mothers.             He Should Meet a Mother There       If he should meet a mother there       Along some winding Flanders road,     No extra touch of grief or care       He'll add unto her heavy load.     But he will kindly take her arm       And tender as her son will be;     He'll lead her from the path of harm       Because of me.      Be she the mother "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16632"],["title","Over Here (#2)"],["body","his foe,       He will not speak to her in hate;     My boy will never stoop so low       As motherhood to desecrate.     But she shall know what once I knew--       Eyes that are glorious to see,     The light of manhood shining through--       Because of me.      He will salute her as they meet,       And stand before her bare of head;     If she be hungry, she may eat       His last remaining bit of bread.     She'll find those splendid arms and strong       Quick to assist her, tenderly,     And they will guard her from all wrong       Because of me.      I miss his thoughtful, loving care;       I miss his smile these dreary days;     But should he meet a mother there,       Helpless and lost in war's grim maze,     She need not fear to take his arm,       As though she'd reared him at her knee;     My son will shield her from all harm       Because of me.             A Father's Tribute       I don't know what they'll put him at, or what          his post may be;     I cannot guess the task that waits for him across          the sea,     But I have known him through the years, and          when there's work to do,     I know he'll meet his duty well, I'll swear that          he'll be true.      I sometimes fear that he may die, but never that          he'll shirk;     If death shall want him death must go and take          him at his work;     This splendid sacrifice he makes is filled with          terrors grim,     And I have many thoughts of fear, but not one          fear of him.      The foe may rob my life of joy, the foe may          take my all,     And desolate my days shall be if he shall have to          fall.     But this I know, whate'er may be the grief that          I must face,     Upon his record there will be no blemish of          disgrace.      His days have all been splendid days, there lies          no broken trust     Along the pathway of his youth to molder in          the dust;     Honor and truth have marked his ways, in him          I can be glad;     He is as fine and true a son as ever a father had.             Runner McGee       (Who had \"Return if Possible\" Orders.)      \"You've heard a good deal of the telephone          wires,\" he said as we sat at our ease,     And talked of the struggle that's taking men's          lives in these terrible days o'er the seas,     \"But I've been through the thick of the thing          and I know when a battle's begun,     It isn't the phone you depend on for help. It's          the legs of a boy who can run.      \"It isn't because of the phone that I'm here.          To-day you are talking to me     Because of the grit and the pluck of a boy. His          title was Runner McGee.     We were up to our dead line an' fighting alone;          some plan had miscarried, I guess,     And the help we were promised had failed to          arrive. We were showing all signs of          distress.      \"Our curtain of fire was ahead of us still, an'          theirs was behind us an' thick,     An' there wasn't a thing we could do for ourselves--the          few of us left had to stick.     You haven't much chance to get central an' talk          on the phone to the music of guns;     Gettin' word to the chief is a matter right then          that is up to the fellow who runs.      \"I'd sent four of 'em back with the R. I. P.          sign, which means to return if you can,     But none of 'em got through the curtain of fire;          my hurry call died with the man.     Then Runner McGee said he'd try to get through.          I hated to order the kid     On his mission of death; thought he'd never get          by, but somehow or other he did.      \"Yes, he's dead. Died an hour after bringing          us word that the chief was aware of our          plight,     An' for us to hang on to the ditch that we held;          the reserves would relieve us at night.     Then we stuck to our trench an' we stuck to our          guns; you know how you'll fight when          you know     That new strength is coming to fill up the gaps.          There's heart in the force of your blow.      \"It wasn't till later I got all the facts. They          wanted McGee to remain.     They begged him to stay. He had cheated death          once an' was foolish to try it again.     'R. I. P. are my orders,' he answered them all,          'an' back to the boys I must go;     Four of us died comin' out with the news. It          will help them to know that you know.'\"             The Girl He Left Behind       We used to think her frivolous--you know how          parents are,     A little quick to see the faults and petty flaws          that mar     The girl their son is fond of and may choose          to make his wife,     A little overjealous of the one who'd share his          life;     But the girl he left behind him when he bravely          marched away     Has blossomed into beauty that we see and need          to-day.      She was with us at the depot, and we turned our          backs a-while,     And her eyes were sad and misty, though she          tried her best to smile.     Then she put her arm round mother, and it          seemed to me as though     They just grew to love each other, for they          shared a common woe.     Now she often comes to see us, and it seems          to me we find     A heap of solid comfort in the girl he left behind.      \"She's so sensible and gentle,\" mother said last          night to me,     \"The kind of girl I've often wished and prayed          his wife would be.     And I like to have her near us, for she understands          my sighs     And I see my brave boy smiling when I look into          her eyes.\"     Now the presence of his sweetheart seems to fill          our home with joy.     She's no longer young and flighty--she's the          girl who loves our boy.             A Patriotic Creed       To serve my country day by day     At any humble post I may;     To honor and respect her Flag,     To live the traits of which I brag;     To be American in deed     As well as in my printed creed.      To stand for truth and honest toil,     To till my little patch of soil     And keep in mind the debt I owe     To them who died that I might know     My country, prosperous and free,     And passed this heritage to me.      I must always in trouble's hour     Be guided by the men in power;     For God and country I must live,     My best for God and country give;     No act of mine that men may scan     Must shame the name American.      To do my best and play my part,     American in mind and heart;     To serve the flag and bravely stand     To guard the glory of my land;     To be American in deed,     God grant me strength to keep this creed.             His Room       His room is as it used to be       Before he went away,     The walls still keep the pennants he       Brought home but yesterday.     The picture of his baseball team       Still holds its favored spot,     And oh, it seems a dreadful dream       This age of shell and shot!      His golf clubs in the corner stand;       His tennis racket, too,     That once the pressure of his hand       In times of laughter knew     Is in the place it long has kept       For us to look upon.     The room is as it was, except       The boy, himself, has gone.      The pictures of his girls are here,       Still smiling as of yore,     And everything that he held dear       Is treasured as before.     Into his room his mother goes       As usual, day by day,     And cares for it, although she knows       Our boy is far away.      We keep it as he left it, when       He bade us all good-bye,     Though I confess that, now and then,       We view it with a sigh.     For never night shall thrill with joy       Nor day be free from gloom     Until once more our soldier boy       Shall occupy his room.             Envy       It's a bigger thing you're doing than the most of us have done;     We have lived the days of pleasure; now the gray days have begun,     And upon your manly shoulders fall the burdens of the strife;     Yours must be the sacrifices of the trial time of life.     Oh, I don't know how to say it, but I'll never think of you     Without wishing I were sharing in the work you have to do.      I have never known a moment that was fraught with real care,     Save the hurts and griefs of sorrow that all mortals have to bear;     With the gay and smiling marchers I have tramped on pleasant ways,     And have paid with feeble service for the gladness of my days.     But to you has come a summons, yours are days of sacrifice,     And for all life has of sweetness you must pay a bitter price.      Men have fought and died before me, men must fight and die to-day,     I have merely taken pleasures for which others had to pay;     I have been a man of laughter, there's no path my feet have made,     I have merely been a marcher in life's gaudy dress parade.     But you wear the garb of service, you have splendid deeds to do,     You shall sound the depths of manhood, and my boy, I envy you.             For Your Boy and Mine       Your dream and my dream is not that we shall rest,     But that our children after us shall know life at its best;     For all we care about ourselves--a crust of bread or two,     A place to sleep and clothes to wear is all that we'd pursue.     We'd tramp the world on sunny days, both light of heart and mind,     And give no thought to days to come or days we leave behind.      Your dream and my dream is not that we shall play,     But that our children after us shall tread a merry way.     We brave the toil of life for them, for them we clamber high,     And if 'twould spare them hurt and pain, for them we'd gladly die.     If we had but ourselves to serve, we'd quit the ways of pride     And with the simplest joys of earth we'd all be satisfied.      The best for them is what we dream. Our little girls and boys     Must know the finest life can give"]]]
