At the place where we landed there is barely sufficient room for the steamer to turn round for the bay, or arm, of the River Zarra is small, and the water shoal. Every available place near the landing was crowded, however, with crafts of all descriptions, from the light-draughted schooner to huge launches, with loads of goods which they had received from ships lying in Hobson's Bay. Altogether, the scene reminded one very much of San Francisco; and so our spirits rose as we contemplated the bustle going on.  \"Well, my men, are you in want of work?\" asked a well-dressed elderly gentleman, who had arrived in a carriage driven by a coachman in livery, and a footman, dressed in the same garb. He appeared to own every thing that he looked at; for we had seen half a dozen men take his orders, and then proceed to obey them with alacrity.  \"We thought we'd try the mines first,\" I replied, in answer to his question.  \"Hard work--hard work,\" he said, with a smile. \"Americans, I see--smart men in that country. Hope you'll do well here. Afraid not if you go to the mines. Want men to help get these goods under shelter. Like to employ you;\" and off he bustled.  \"A pretty good sort of man, I guess,\" remarked Fred.  \"I say, stranger,\" I asked, turning to a person with a cartman's frock on, who was seated on a box smoking a pipe, \"can you tell me who that gentleman is?\"  \"I didn't see any gentleman,\" he answered, without even taking his pipe from his mouth.  \"Why, I mean the one who just spoke to us--the man with the white vest and gold buttons.\"  \"Him--he's a ticket-of-leave man, and has more money than half of the merchants in Melbourne,\" replied the cartman.  \"What, that man a convict?\" I asked, with surprise.  \"Just so--transported for fourteen years for house-breaking. Behaved himself, and so got liberty to enter into business; and now he is at the top of the heap. In two years his time will be out, and then he can stay or go where he pleases.\"  After this piece of news the convict became an object of curiosity to us, and we watched him until he entered his carriage and drove off, his coachman treating him with as much respect as he would the governor general.  \"I say,\" asked Fred of our new acquaintance, \"do all convicts get rich? Because if they do I want to become one as soon as possible.\"  \"Not all,\" replied the man; \"but some blunder into luck, and others are shrewd and look after the chances. I don't suppose I shall ever be rich, although I am doing pretty well.\"  \"And are you a--\"  I didn't like to say convict, and so I hesitated.  \"O, yes; I was sentenced to ten years' transportation for writing another man's name instead of my own on a piece of paper.\"  \"That is forgery.\"  The convict smiled, as much as to say, you have hit it, and continued to smoke his pipe with infinite satisfaction.  \"I should like to know if the company we are likely to meet in the mines are of the same class?\" muttered Fred.  \"Most of them,\" replied the man, who appeared to be a man of education; \"and you'll find them more honest than those never sentenced, because they know that their freedom depends upon their reputation.\"  We sat staring at our informant for some time; but after a while he knocked the ashes from his pipe, and arose as though going.  \"If you want your traps taken to the mines at a reasonable rate, I'll do it for you, as I start to-morrow with a load of goods for Ballarat,\" he said, after a moment's hesitation.  \"Is that mine productive?\" we asked.  \"It's as rich as any of them. You may sink a shaft and strike a vein, and you may get nothing. It's all a lottery.\"  We consulted together for a few minutes, and concluded to try our fortunes at Ballarat, and so signified to our acquaintance.  \"Then shoulder your traps, and I'll show you my shanty. You can sleep there to-night, and, let me tell you, it's a favor that I wouldn't grant to half of my countrymen.\"  As we considered pride out of place in that country, we readily accepted his offer, and in a few minutes were walking through the streets of Melbourne with a convicted felon.  We found his hut to be built of rough boards, with but one room; and the furniture consisted of a stove, wooden benches, a pine table, and a curiosity in the shape of a bedstead.  That night we learned more of the customs of the Australians from our host, who gave the name of Smith as the one which he was to be called by, than we should have found out by a six months' residence.  Over a bottle of whiskey, which was made in Yankeeland, we spent our first night in Australia.  \"Come,\" said Smith, about ten o'clock, \"it's time we were asleep, for we start early in the morning, and before to-morrow night you'll not feel as fresh as you do at present.\"  As he spoke he removed the whiskey, and in half an hour deep snoring was the only sound of life in the convict's hut.     CHAPTER II.  A MORNING IN AUSTRALIA.--JOURNEY TO THE MINES OF BALLARAT.--THE CONVICT'S STORY.--BLACK DARNLEY, THE BUSHRANGER.   \"Hallo!\" cried a gruff voice, accompanied by a gentle shake, which was sufficient to arouse Fred and myself from a deep sleep, that was probably caused by the whiskey.  The time had passed so swiftly that it did not seem an hour since we had first stretched ourselves upon our blankets on the floor.  We rubbed our eyes and sat up, looking around the Australian's hut, almost fancying that we were still dreaming. A spluttering tallow candle was dimly burning, stuck in the neck of a porter bottle, and a fire was lighted in the old broken stove, on which was hissing a spider filled with small bits of beef and pieces of potatoes. A sauce pan was doing duty for a coffee-pot, and the fragrant berry was agreeable to the nostrils of hungry men. Our host, the convict Smith, after he had aroused us, seated himself upon a three-legged stool, and was busily employed stirring up the savory mess, and trying to make a wheezy pipe draw; and as the tobacco which he was smoking was damp, and the meat was liable to burn, his time was fully occupied.  \"Come, rouse up.\" Smith said, when he saw that we were awake; and while he spoke, he was trying to coax a coal into the pipe, but it obstinately refused to go.  \"We'll be off in an hour's time; so I'm getting a little bit of breakfast ready before we start. Get up, and help me set the table.\"  We rolled up our blankets, and in a few minutes had drawn the rough table to the middle of the room, and placed thereupon our tin plates and quart pots.  As breakfast was not quite ready, I strolled out of doors, and found that the first streaks of daylight were just visible, and the stars looked white and silverish. There were no clouds to obscure the sight, and for a short time I stood watching the gradual changes that were taking place as the sun edged its way towards the horizon. First long streaks of a bright golden color were extended like huge arms, and then they changed to a subdued pink tint that defied the art of a painter to transfer to canvas. Glorious are the views to be obtained in Australia at sunrise, and if those of Italy excel them, it must indeed be a land for poets and painters.  A heavy dew had fallen during the night, and refreshed the aromatic plants that sprouted beneath my feet; and as they were crushed by my heavy tread, they yielded up their life with a perfumed breath that filled the air with fragrance, and made me regret that I had no other means of locomotion beside my feet.  The heavy rumbling of carts over the dry streets was heard, and an occasional crack of the dreadful whip and the fierce shout of the driver proved that there were others stirring as early as ourselves.  \"Breakfast is ready,\" shouted Fred from the door of the hut; and I retraced my steps to the home of the convict, whom I found still sucking his pipe and pouring out the coffee.  Our meal was soon over, for the delicacy of civilized life was not particularly observed, and our long seclusion from the society of females had rendered us little better than savages, as far as manners were concerned.  \"Now, then, pack up your traps, and he ready for a start. I'll be along here with my team in half an hour, as my freight is already loaded.\"  \"Rut we shall need provisions for the route,\" I said.  \"Of course you will; but as I have to take some for myself, I'll get a quantity for you also, and charge just what I pay. At Ballarat you'll find enough to eat, and men to trust you if short of money.\"  Smith left to get his cattle, and while absent we washed the tin pans and got all ready for a start. Our rifles were reloaded, and revolvers examined, and after we had indulged in the luxury of a smoke, we heard the voice of the convict shouting in no gentle tones to his oxen, as they stopped in front of the hut.  \"All ready?\" asked Smith, coiling up his long whip, at the sight of which the cattle fairly trembled, and pricked up their ears as though ready for a stampede.  \"All ready,\" we answered, bringing out our traps and lashing them on the team.  The coffee pot and skillet were not forgotten, as we calculated if we met any game they would both be of service. A keg of water, a bottle of whiskey, a bag of ship bread, a large piece of pork, a few potatoes, coffee, a bag of flour, and a bag of sugar, were the articles needed for our long journey to the mines of Ballarat.  Smith locked the door of his hut, hung the key about his neck attached to a thick cord, and then, uncoiling his dreadful whip, he sounded the signal for an advance.  The cattle strained at their yokes, and the huge, clumsy, English-built team creaked over the road, and groaned as though offering strong remonstrance against the journey.  There were five yoke of oxen attached to the cart, and as they were in fair condition and had not been worked for a few days, they took the load along the level road at a brisk walk; and it was not until we had got beyond the city's limits and left"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16052"],["title","The Brownies and Other Tales (#1)"],["body","a few words in pencil, which he read also--_Pitifully behold the sorrows of our hearts_. On the stone lay a pencil, and a few feet from it lay the Doctor, face downwards, as he had lain all night, with the hoar frost on his black hair.  Ah! these grave-stones (they were ugly things in those days; not the light, hopeful, pretty crosses we set up now), how they seem remorselessly to imprison and keep our dear dead friends away from us! And yet they do not lie with a feather's weight upon the souls that are gone, while GOD only knows how heavily they press upon the souls that are left behind. Did the spirit whose body was with the dead, stand that morning by the body whose spirit was with the dead, and pity him? Let us only talk about what we know.  After this it was said that the Doctor had got a fever, and was dying, but he got better of it; and then that he was out of his mind, but he got better of that, and came out looking much as usual, except that his hair never seemed quite so black again, as if a little of that night's hoar frost still remained. And no further misfortune happened to him that I ever heard of; and as time went on he grew a beard, and got stout, and kept a German poodle, and gave tea-parties to other people's children. As to the grave-stone story, whatever it was to him at the end of twenty years, it was a great convenience to his friends; for when he said anything they didn't agree with, or did anything they couldn't understand, or didn't say or do what was expected of him, what could be easier or more conclusive than to shake one's head and say,  \"The fact is, our Doctor has been a little odd, _ever since_--!\"   THE DOCTOR'S TEA-PARTY.  There is one great advantage attendant upon invitations to tea with a doctor. No objections can be raised on the score of health. It is obvious that it must be fine enough to go out when the Doctor asks you, and that his tea-cakes may be eaten with perfect impunity.  Those tea-cakes were always good; to-night they were utterly delicious; there was a perfect _abandon_ of currants, and the amount of citron peel was enervating to behold. Then the housekeeper waited in awful splendour, and yet the Doctor's authority over her seemed as absolute as if he were an Eastern despot. Deordie must be excused for believing in the charms of living alone. It certainly has its advantages. The limited sphere of duty conduces to discipline in the household, demand does not exceed supply in the article of waiting, and there is not that general scrimmage of conflicting interests which besets a large family in the most favoured circumstances. The housekeeper waits in black silk, and looks as if she had no meaner occupation than to sit in a rocking-chair, and dream of damson cheese.  Rustling, hospitable, and subservient, this one retired at last, and--  \"Now,\" said the Doctor, \"for the verandah; and to look at the moon.\"  The company adjourned with a rush, the rear being brought up by the poodle, who seemed quite used to the proceedings; and there under the verandah, framed with passion-flowers and geraniums, the Doctor had gathered mats, rugs, cushions, and arm-chairs, for the party; while far up in the sky, a yellow-faced harvest moon looked down in awful benignity.  \"Now!\" said the Doctor. \"Take your seats. Ladies first, and gentlemen afterwards. Mary and Tiny, race for the American rocking-chair. Well done! Of course it will hold both. Now, boys, shake down. No one is to sit on the stone, or put his feet on the grass: and when you're ready, I'll begin.\"  \"We're ready,\" said the girls.  The boys shook down in a few minutes more, and the Doctor began the story of   \"THE BROWNIES.\"  \"Bairns are a burden,\" said the Tailor to himself as he sat at work. He lived in a village on some of the glorious moors of the north of England; and by bairns he meant children, as every Northman knows.  \"Bairns are a burden,\" and he sighed.  \"Bairns are a blessing,\" said the old lady in the window. \"It is the family motto. The Trouts have had large families and good luck for generations; that is, till your grandfather's time. He had one only son. I married him. He was a good husband, but he had been a spoilt child. He had always been used to be waited upon, and he couldn't fash to look after the farm when it was his own. We had six children. They are all dead but you, who were the youngest. You were bound to a tailor. When the farm came into your hands, your wife died, and you have never looked up since. The land is sold now, but not the house. No! no! you're right enough there; but you've had your troubles, son Thomas, and the lads _are_ idle!\"  It was the Tailor's mother who spoke. She was a very old woman, and helpless. She was not quite so bright in her intellect as she had been, and got muddled over things that had lately happened; but she had a clear memory for what was long past, and was very pertinacious in her opinions. She knew the private history of almost every family in the place, and who of the Trouts were buried under which old stones in the churchyard; and had more tales of ghosts, doubles, warnings, fairies, witches, hobgoblins, and such like, than even her grandchildren had ever come to the end of. Her hands trembled with age, and she regretted this for nothing more than for the danger it brought her into of spilling the salt. She was past housework, but all day she sat knitting hearth-rugs out of the bits and scraps of cloth that were shred in the tailoring. How far she believed in the wonderful tales she told, and the odd little charms she practised, no one exactly knew; but the older she grew, the stranger were the things she remembered, and the more testy she was if any one doubted their truth. \"Bairns are a blessing!\" said she. \"It is the family motto.\"  \"_Are they_?\" said the Tailor emphatically.  He had a high respect for his mother, and did not like to contradict her, but he held his own opinion, based upon personal experience; and not being a metaphysician, did not understand that it is safer to found opinions on principles than on experience, since experience may alter, but principles cannot.  \"Look at Tommy,\" he broke out suddenly. \"That boy does nothing but whittle sticks from morning till night. I have almost to lug him out of bed o' mornings. If I send him an errand, he loiters; I'd better have gone myself. If I set him to do anything, I have to tell him everything; I could sooner do it myself. And if he does work, it's done so unwillingly, with such a poor grace; better, far better, to do it myself. What housework do the boys ever do but looking after the baby? And this afternoon she was asleep in the cradle, and off they went, and when she awoke, _I_ must leave my work to take her. _I_ gave her her supper, and put her to bed. And what with what they want and I have to get, and what they take out to play with and lose, and what they bring in to play with and leave about, bairns give some trouble, Mother, and I've not an easy life of it. The pay is poor enough when one can get the work, and the work is hard enough when one has a clear day to do it in; but housekeeping and bairn-minding don't leave a man much time for his trade. No! no! Ma'am, the luck of the Trouts is gone, and 'Bairns are a burden,' is the motto now. Though they are one's own,\" he muttered to himself, \"and not bad ones, and I did hope once would have been a blessing.\"  \"There's Johnnie,\" murmured the old lady, dreamily. \"He has a face like an apple.\"  \"And is about as useful,\" said the Tailor. \"He might have been different, but his brother leads him by the nose.\"  His brother led him in as the Tailor spoke, not literally by his snub, though, but by the hand. They were a handsome pair, this lazy couple. Johnnie especially had the largest and roundest of foreheads, the reddest of cheeks, the brightest of eyes, the quaintest and most twitchy of chins, and looked altogether like a gutta-percha cherub in a chronic state of longitudinal squeeze. They were locked together by two grubby paws, and had each an armful of moss, which they deposited on the floor as they came in.  \"I've swept this floor once to-day,\" said the father, \"and I'm not going to do it again. Put that rubbish outside.\" \"Move it, Johnnie!\" said his brother, seating himself on a stool, and taking out his knife and a piece of wood, at which he cut and sliced; while the apple-cheeked Johnnie stumbled and stamped over the moss, and scraped it out on the doorstep, leaving long trails of earth behind him, and then sat down also.  \"And those chips the same,\" added the Tailor; \"I will _not_ clear up the litter you lads make.\"  \"Pick 'em up, Johnnie,\" said Thomas Trout, junior, with an exasperated sigh; and the apple tumbled up, rolled after the flying chips, and tumbled down again.  \"Is there any supper, Father?\" asked Tommy.  \"No, there is not, Sir, unless you know how to get it,\" said the Tailor; and taking his pipe, he went out of the house.  \"Is there really nothing to eat, Granny?\" asked the boy.  \"No, my bairn, only some bread for breakfast to-morrow.\"  \"What makes Father so cross, Granny?\"  \"He's wearied, and you don't help him, my dear.\"  \"What could I do, Grandmother?\"  \"Many little things, if you tried,\" said the old lady. \"He spent half-an-hour to-day, while you were on the moor, getting turf for the fire, and you could have got it just as well, and he been at his work.\"  \"He never told me,\" said Tommy.  \"You might help me a bit just now, if you would, my laddie,\" said the old lady coaxingly; \"these bits of cloth want tearing into lengths, and if you get 'em ready, I can go on knitting. There'll be some food when this mat is done and sold.\"  \"I'll try,\" said Tommy, lounging up with desperate resignation. \"Hold my knife, Johnnie. Father's been cross, and everything has been miserable, ever since the farm was sold. I wish I were a big man, and could make a fortune.--Will that do, Granny?\"  The old lady put down her knitting and"]]]
