Scalenohedra as much as two feet long are sometimes seen, and others a foot or more in length are common. Planes or crystal ghosts, sometimes with pyrite crystals, marking stages of growth in the calcite crystals, are often distinguishable. The entire absence of anything like stalactites is noticeable, and together with the presence of the crystals, show that the cave was completely filled with water during their growth.\" In the same volume, all those counties in the extreme southwest corner of the state, whose geological age has not heretofore been considered positively determined, are mapped as Lower Carboniferous, and Lower Silurian, with the Coal Measures covering portions of Barton and Jasper and appearing in a few small, scattered spots in Dade, Polk, Green and Christian counties, and some scanty lines of Devonian fringing the edges of the Silurian in Barton and McDonald.  Other State reports make mention of many caves and fine springs, and also several natural bridges worthy of special notice. In Mr. G.C. Broadhead's report for 1873-1874, he gives a short but interesting chapter on caves and water supplies, in which he says that \"Caves occur in the Third Magnesian Limestone, Saccharoidal Sandstone, Trenton, Lithographic, Encrinital and St. Louis Limestone.\"  \"In Eastern and Northeast Missouri there have not been found many large caves in the Encrinital Limestone, but the lower beds of this formation in Southwest Missouri often enclose very large caverns; among the latter may be included the caves of Green County with some in Christian and McDonald. Those in McDonald I have not seen, but they are reported to be very extensive and probably are situated in the Encrinital Limestone.\"  Under the head of \"Special Descriptions\" he says: \"On Sac River, in the north part of Green County, we find a cave with two entrances, one at the foot of a hill, opening toward Sac River, forty-five feet high and eighty feet wide. The other entrance is from the hill-top, one hundred and fifty feet back from the face of the bluff. These two passages unite. The exact dimensions of the cave are not known, but there are several beautiful and large rooms lined with stalactites and stalagmites which often assume both beautiful and grotesque life-like forms. The cave has been explored for several hundred yards, showing the formations to be thick silicious beds of the Lower Carboniferous formations.\"  \"Knox cave, in Green County, is said to be of large dimensions. I have not seen it, but some of its stalactites are quite handsome.\"  \"Wilson's Creek sinks beneath the Limestone and appears again below.\"  \"There are several caves near Ozark, Christian County, which issue from the same formation as those in Green County. On a branch of Finly Creek a stream disappears in a sink, appearing again three-quarters of a mile southeast through an opening sixty feet high by ninety-eight feet wide. Up stream the cave continues this size for a hundred yards and then decreases in size, and for the next quarter of a mile further it is generally ten by fourteen feet wide. A very clear, cool stream passes out, in which by careful search crawfish without eyes can be found.\"  \"There is another cave a few miles south of Ozark, and another ten miles southeast occurs in the Magnesian Limestone.\"  \"In Boone County there are several caves in the Encrinital Limestone. Conner's, the largest, is said to have been explored for a distance of eight miles.\"  \"In Pike and Lincoln there are several small caves occurring in the upper beds of Trenton Limestone, which are often very cavernous. On Sulphur Fork of Cuivre, there is a cave and Natural Bridge, to which parties for pleasure often resort. The bridge is tubular with twenty feet between the walls, and is one hundred feet long.\"  \"At J.P. Fisher's on Spencer Creek, Ralls County, there is a cave having an entrance of ninety feet wide by twenty feet high. The Lower Trenton beds occupy the floor, with the upper cavernous beds above. On the bluff, at a distance of one hundred and fifty yards back, there is a sink-hole which communicates with the cave. Within the cave is a cool, clear spring of water, and Mr. F. said he could keep meat fresh there for six weeks during midsummer.\"  \"The Third Magnesian Limestone which occupies such a large portion of Southwest Missouri, often contains very large caves. One of them, known as Friede's cave, is six or eight miles Northwest of Rolla, on Cave Spring Creek.\"  \"It is said to have been explored for several miles, but I only passed in a few hundred yards. The stalactites here are very beautiful, assuming the structure of satin spar. A very clear stream of water issues out. West of the Gasconade, on Clifty Creek, is a remarkable Natural Bridge which I have elsewhere described in Geological Survey of Missouri, 1855-71, page 16.\"  \"Mr. Meek speaks of a large and interesting cave on Tavern Creek, in Miller County. Dr. Shumard estimates a cave on Bryant's Fork, in Ozark County, to be a mile and a half long.\"  This description of Dr. Shumard's is in the Geological Survey of Missouri, 1855-71, page 196, where he says:  \"The entrance is thirty-five feet wide and thirty feet high, and is situated at the foot of a perpendicular cliff, and far above the water-level of Bryant. Just within the entrance it expands to sixty or seventy feet, with a height of about fifty feet; and this part of the cave has been used by the citizens of the county as a place for holding camp-meeting. I estimated its length at not far short of one mile and a half. The main passage is in general quite spacious, the roof elevated, and the floor tolerably level, but often wet and miry. For some distance beyond the entrance there is not much to attract attention; but as we proceed, at the far extremity the chambers are quite as picturesque as the most noted of the well-known Mammoth Cave. The ceilings, sides and floor are adorned with a multitude of stalactites and stalagmites arranged in fanciful combinations, and assuming a variety of fantastic and beautiful forms.\"  Many of these caves contain niter, which occurs as a mineral and not as evidence of former animal occupation, it being found in the form of effervescenses on the walls. Dr. Shumard mentions several of this character in Pulaski County, the most noted being Niter Cave, in the Third Magnesian Limestone, with a wide entrance thirty feet above the level of the Gasconade. On page 201, he also gives a charming description of one of the immense springs that are numerous in this region and that I have never seen elsewhere. He says:  \"Ozark County is bountifully supplied with springs of the finest water, and some of them of remarkably large size. The largest one is situated near the North Fork, in T. 24, R. 11 W., Sec. 32, and is known under the name of the Double Spring. It issues from near the base of a bluff of Sandstone and Magnesian Limestone, a few feet above the level of the North Fork. This spring discharges an immense volume of water, which is divided by a huge mass of Sandstone into two streams, with swift currents flowing in opposite directions to join the North Fork about one hundred and fifty yards distant from the spring. I estimated the width of these streams at not less than fifty yards. They are separated from the North Fork by a pretty wooded island one hundred yards long. The upper stream affords a good mill-site. I am informed that the quantity of water discharged by this magnificent spring is not materially diminished during the dryest seasons of the year. The temperature of the water measured at the edge of the spring, was found to be 56°; the temperature of the air at the same time, 59°. Other springs of considerable magnitude occur in various portions of the county, giving rise to beautiful and limpid streams.\"  The descriptions of the Natural Bridge and Friede's cave, near Rolla, previously referred to as being on page 16 of the same volume, are as follows:  \"On Clifty Creek found the chert bed of Sec. 21-5 occurring about sixty feet from the top of the Third Magnesian Limestone, with a road passing over its upper surface, presenting it very favorably for observation. It seemed here to be broken by vertical cracks into large rhomboidal blocks. Further up this creek in a wild and secluded spot, observed a Natural Bridge with six feet of this chert bed at its base, and Silicious Magnesian Limestone above. The span of this bridge is about thirty feet, an elevation of opening about fifteen feet above the water, the thickness of the rock above is about twelve feet, and width on top about fifteen feet. Two small streams come together, one from the west and another from the south-west. A point of the bluff on the south-west fork spans the northern fork, and terminates about sixty feet beyond in a sharp point; a few large masses of rock lie near the termination of the promontory, and fifty feet beyond, the bluffs of the opposite hills rise abruptly from the bottoms. The bluffs, both above and below, are very precipitous, the middle and lower beds of the Third Magnesian Limestone forming perpendicular escarpments, frequently studded with cedar, some occurring on top of the bridge. A perfectly clear stream of water courses through this valley. The bottoms near are overspread with a dense growth of trees and vines, among which latter I noticed the Muscadine grape. The valley at this part being shut in by its perpendicular cliffs with not a path to guide the traveler through the dense thickets, is wildly picturesque and romantic in its loneliness.\"  Of the cave he says: \"This cave is a quarter of a mile east of Cave Spring Creek, and has a wide and elevated entrance; passing into it a hundred yards or more, the passage narrows, and in order to go further a stream of water has frequently to be waded through; this passage has been followed by some persons several miles without finding any object of interest; but a few hundred yards from the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17355"],["title","The Runaway Skyscraper (#1)"],["body","little gilt clock over her typewriter-desk lay in fragments. Arthur hastily glanced at his own watch.  \"Great bombs and little cannon-balls!\" he shouted. \"Look at this!\"  His watch trembled and quivered in his hand. The hands were going around so swiftly it was impossible to watch the minute-hand, and the hour-hand traveled like the wind.  While they looked, it made two complete revolutions. In one of them the glory of daylight had waxed, waned, and vanished. In the other, darkness reigned except for the glow from the electric light overhead.  There was a sudden tension and catch in the watch. Arthur dropped it instantly. It flew to pieces before it reached the floor.  \"If you've got a watch,\" Arthur ordered swiftly, \"stop it this instant!\"  Estelle fumbled at her wrist. Arthur tore the watch from her hand and threw open the case. The machinery inside was going so swiftly it was hardly visible; Relentlessly, Arthur jabbed a penholder in the works. There was a sharp click, and the watch was still.  Arthur ran to the window. As he reached it the sun rushed up, day lasted a moment, there was darkness, and then the sun appeared again.  \"Miss Woodward!\" Arthur ordered suddenly, \"look at the ground!\"  Estelle glanced down. The next time the sun flashed into view she gasped.  The ground was white with snow!  \"What _has_ happened?\" she demanded, terrified. \"Oh, what _has_ happened?\"  Arthur fumbled at his chin awkwardly, watching the astonishing panorama outside. There was hardly any distinguishing between the times the sun was up and the times it was below now, as the darkness and light followed each other so swiftly the effect was the same as one of the old flickering motion-pictures.  As Arthur watched, this effect became more pronounced. The tall Fifth Avenue Building across the way began to disintegrate. In a moment, it seemed, there was only a skeleton there. Then that vanished, story by story. A great cavity in the earth appeared, and then another building became visible, a smaller, brown-stone, unimpressive structure.  With bulging eyes Arthur stared across the city. Except for the flickering, he could see almost clearly now.  He no longer saw the sun rise and set. There was merely a streak of unpleasantly brilliant light across the sky. Bit by bit, building by building, the city began to disintegrate and become replaced by smaller, dingier buildings. In a little while those began to disappear and leave gaps where they vanished.  Arthur strained his eyes and looked far down-town. He saw a forest of masts and spars along the waterfront for a moment and when he turned his eyes again to the scenery near him it was almost barren of houses, and what few showed were mean, small residences, apparently set in the midst of farms and plantations.  Estelle was sobbing.  \"Oh, Mr. Chamberlain,\" she cried. \"What is the matter? What has happened?\"  Arthur had lost his fear of what their fate would be in his absorbing interest in what he saw. He was staring out of the window, wide-eyed, lost in the sight before him. At Estelle's cry, however, he reluctantly left the window and patted her shoulder awkwardly.  \"I don't know how to explain it,\" he said uncomfortably, \"but it's obvious that my first surmise was all wrong. The speed of the earth's rotation can't have been increased, because if it had to the extent we see, we'd have been thrown off into space long ago. But--have you read anything about the Fourth Dimension?\"  Estelle shook her head hopelessly.  \"Well, then, have you ever read anything by Wells? The 'Time Machine,' for instance?\"  Again she shook her head.  \"I don't know how I'm going to say it so you'll understand, but time is just as much a dimension as length and breadth. From what I can judge, I'd say there has been an earthquake, and the ground has settled a little with our building on it, only instead of settling down toward the center of the earth, or side-wise, it's settled in this fourth dimension.\"  \"But what does that mean?\" asked Estelle uncomprehendingly.  \"If the earth had settled down, we'd have been lower. If it had settled to one side, we'd have been moved one way or another, but as it's settled back in the Fourth Dimension, we're going back in time.\"  \"Then--\"  \"We're in a runaway skyscraper, bound for some time back before the discovery of America!\"     III.   It was very still in the office. Except for the flickering outside everything seemed very much as usual. The electric light burned steadily, but Estelle was sobbing with fright and Arthur was trying vainly to console her.  \"Have I gone crazy?\" she demanded between her sobs.  \"Not unless I've gone mad, too,\" said Arthur soothingly. The excitement had quite a soothing effect upon him. He had ceased to feel afraid, but was simply waiting to see what had happened. \"We're way back before the founding of New York now, and still going strong.\"  \"Are you sure that's what has happened?\"  \"If you'll look outside,\" he suggested, \"you'll see the seasons following each other in reverse order. One moment the snow covers all the ground, then you catch a glimpse of autumn foliage, then summer follows, and next spring.\"  Estelle glanced out of the window and covered her eyes.  \"Not a house,\" she said despairingly. \"Not a building. Nothing, nothing, nothing!\"  Arthur slipped, his arm about her and patted hers comfortingly.  \"It's all right,\" he reassured her. \"We'll bring up presently, and there we'll be. There's nothing to be afraid of.\"  She rested her head on his shoulder and sobbed hopelessly for a little while longer, but presently quieted. Then, suddenly, realizing that Arthur's arm was about her and that she was crying on his shoulder, she sprang away, blushing crimson.  Arthur walked to the window.  \"Look there!\" he exclaimed, but it was too late. \"I'll swear to it I saw the Half Moon, Hudson's ship,\" he declared excitedly. \"We're way back now, and don't seem to be slacking up, either.\"  Estelle came to the window by his side. The rapidly changing scene before her made her gasp. It was no longer possible to distinguish night from day.  A wavering streak, moving first to the right and then to the left, showed where the sun flashed across the sky.  \"What makes the sun wabble so?\" she asked.  \"Moving north and south of the equator,\" Arthur explained casually. \"When it's farthest south--to the left--there's always snow on the ground. When it's farthest right it's summer. See how green it is?\"  A few moments' observation corroborated his statement.  \"I'd say,\" Arthur remarked reflectively, \"that it takes about fifteen seconds for the sun to make the round trip from farthest north to farthest south.\" He felt his pulse. \"Do you know the normal rate of the heart-beat? We can judge time that way. A clock will go all to pieces, of course.\"  \"Why did your watch explode--and the clock?\"  \"Running forward in time unwinds a clock, doesn't it?\" asked Arthur. \"It follows, of course, that when you move it backward in time it winds up. When you move it too far back, you wind it so tightly that the spring just breaks to pieces.\"  He paused a moment, his fingers on his pulse.  \"Yes, it takes about fifteen seconds for all the four seasons to pass. That means we're going backward in time about four years a minute. If we go on at this rate another hour we'll be back in the time of the Northmen, and will be able to tell if they did discover America, after all.\"  \"Funny we don't hear any noises,\" Estelle observed. She had caught some of Arthur's calmness.  \"It passes so quickly that though our ears hear it, we don't separate the sounds. If you'll notice, you do hear a sort of humming. It's very high-pitched, though.\"  Estelle listened, but could hear nothing.  \"No matter,\" said Arthur. \"It's probably a little higher than your ears will catch. Lots of people can't hear a bat squeak.\"  \"I never could,\" said Estelle. \"Out in the country, where I come from, other people could hear them, but I couldn't.\"  They stood a while in silence, watching.  \"When are we going to stop?\" asked Estelle uneasily. \"It seems as if we're going to keep on indefinitely.\"  \"I guess we'll stop all right,\" Arthur reassured her. \"It's obvious that whatever it was, only affected our own building, or we'd see some other one with us. It looks like a fault or a flaw in the rock the building rests on. And that can only give so far.\"  Estelle was silent for a moment.  \"Oh, I can't be sane!\" she burst out semihysterically. \"This can't be happening!\"  \"You aren't crazy,\" said Arthur sharply. \"You're sane as I am. Just something queer is happening. Buck up. Say your multiplication tables. Say anything you know. Say something sensible and you'll know you're all right. But don't get frightened now. There'll be plenty to get frightened about later.\"  The grimness in his tone alarmed Estelle.  \"What are you afraid of?\" she asked quickly.  \"Time enough to worry when it happens,\" Arthur retorted briefly.  \"You--you aren't afraid we'll go back before the beginning of the world, are you?\" asked Estelle in sudden access of fright.  Arthur shook his head.  \"Tell me,\" said Estelle more quietly, getting a grip on herself. \"I won't mind. But please tell me.\"  Arthur glanced at her. Her face was pale, but there was more resolution in it than he had expected to find.  \"I'll tell you, then,\" he said reluctantly. \"We're going back a little faster than we were, and the flaw seems to be a deeper one than I thought. At the roughest kind of an estimate, we're all of a thousand years before the discovery of America now, and I think nearer three or four. And we're gaining speed all the time. So, though I am as sure as I can be sure of anything that we'll stop this cave-in eventually, I don't know where. It's like a crevasse in the earth opened by an earthquake which may be only a few feet deep, or it may be hundreds of yards, or even a mile or two. We started off smoothly. We're going at a terrific rate. _What will happen when we"]]]
