Does it require more than common sense to feel that there is at least delirium and frenzy in hating and tormenting each other for unintelligible opinions of a being of this kind? Finally, does it not all prove that morality and virtue are totally incompatible with the idea of a God, whose ministers and interpreters have painted him in all countries as the most fantastic, the most unjust, and the most cruel of tyrants, whose pretended wishes are to serve as rules and laws for the inhabitants of the earth? To discover the true principles of morality, men have no need of theology, of revelation, or of Gods; they need but common sense; they have only to look within themselves, to reflect upon their own nature, to consult their obvious interests, to consider the object of society and of each of the members who compose it, and they will easily understand that virtue is an advantage, and that vice is an injury to beings of their species. Let us teach men to be just, benevolent, moderate, and sociable, not because their Gods exact it, but to please men; let us tell them to abstain from vice and from crime, not because they will be punished in another world, but because they will suffer in the present world. There are, says Montesquieu, means to prevent crime, they are sufferings; to change the manners, these are good examples. Truth is simple, error is complicated, uncertain in its gait, full of by-ways; the voice of nature is intelligible, that of falsehood is ambiguous, enigmatical, and mysterious; the road of truth is straight, that of imposture is oblique and dark; this truth, always necessary to man, is felt by all just minds; the lessons of reason are followed by all honest souls; men are unhappy only because they are ignorant; they are ignorant only because everything conspires to prevent them from being enlightened, and they are wicked only because their reason is not sufficiently developed.     COMMON SENSE.  Detexit quo dolose Vaticinandi furore sacerdotes mysteria, illis spe ignota, audactur publicant.--PETRON. SATYR.     I.--APOLOGUE.  There is a vast empire governed by a monarch, whose conduct does but confound the minds of his subjects. He desires to be known, loved, respected, and obeyed, but he never shows himself; everything tends to make uncertain the notions which we are able to form about him. The people subjected to his power have only such ideas of the character and the laws of their invisible sovereign as his ministers give them; these suit, however, because they themselves have no idea of their master, for his ways are impenetrable, and his views and his qualities are totally incomprehensible; moreover, his ministers disagree among themselves in regard to the orders which they pretend emanated from the sovereign whose organs they claim to be; they announce them diversely in each province of the empire; they discredit and treat each other as impostors and liars; the decrees and ordinances which they promulgate are obscure; they are enigmas, made not to be understood or divined by the subjects for whose instruction they were intended. The laws of the invisible monarch need interpreters, but those who explain them are always quarreling among themselves about the true way of understanding them; more than this, they do not agree among themselves; all which they relate of their hidden prince is but a tissue of contradictions, scarcely a single word that is not contradicted at once. He is called supremely good, nevertheless not a person but complains of his decrees. He is supposed to be infinitely wise, and in his administration everything seems contrary to reason and good sense. They boast of his justice, and the best of his subjects are generally the least favored. We are assured that he sees everything, yet his presence remedies nothing. It is said that he is the friend of order, and everything in his universe is in a state of confusion and disorder; all is created by him, yet events rarely happen according to his projects. He foresees everything, but his foresight prevents nothing. He is impatient if any offend him; at the same time he puts every one in the way of offending him. His knowledge is admired in the perfection of his works, but his works are full of imperfections, and of little permanence. He is continually occupied in creating and destroying, then repairing what he has done, never appearing to be satisfied with his work. In all his enterprises he seeks but his own glory, but he does not succeed in being glorified. He works but for the good of his subjects, and most of them lack the necessities of life. Those whom he seems to favor, are generally those who are the least satisfied with their fate; we see them all continually revolting against a master whose greatness they admire, whose wisdom they extol, whose goodness they worship, and whose justice they fear, revering orders which they never follow. This empire is the world; its monarch is God; His ministers are the priests; their subjects are men.     II.--WHAT IS THEOLOGY?  There is a science which has for its object only incomprehensible things. Unlike all others, it occupies itself but with things unseen. Hobbes calls it \"the kingdom of darkness.\" In this land all obey laws opposed to those which men acknowledge in the world they inhabit. In this marvelous region light is but darkness, evidence becomes doubtful or false, the impossible becomes credible, reason is an unfaithful guide, and common sense changed into delirium. This science is named Theology, and this Theology is a continual insult to human reason.     III.  By frequent repetition of if, but, and perhaps, we succeed in forming an imperfect and broken system which perplexes men's minds to the extent of making them forget the clearest notions, and to render uncertain the most palpable truths. By the aid of this systematic nonsense, all nature has become an inexplicable enigma for man; the visible world has disappeared to give place to invisible regions; reason is obliged to give place to imagination, which can lead us only to the land of chimeras which she herself has invented.     IV.--MAN BORN NEITHER RELIGIOUS NOR DEISTICAL.  All religious principles are founded upon the idea of a God, but it is impossible for men to have true ideas of a being who does not act upon any one of their senses. All our ideas are but pictures of objects which strike us. What can the idea of God represent to us when it is evidently an idea without an object? Is not such an idea as impossible as an effect without a cause? An idea without a prototype, is it anything but a chimera? Some theologians, however, assure us that the idea of God is innate, or that men have this idea from the time of their birth. Every principle is a judgment; all judgment is the effect of experience; experience is not acquired but by the exercise of the senses: from which it follows that religious principles are drawn from nothing, and are not innate.     V.--IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO BELIEVE IN A GOD, AND THE MOST REASONABLE THING IS NOT TO THINK OF HIM.  No religious system can be founded otherwise than upon the nature of God and of men, and upon the relations they bear to each other. But, in order to judge of the reality of these relations, we must have some idea of the Divine nature. But everybody tells us that the essence of God is incomprehensible to man; at the same time they do not hesitate to assign attributes to this incomprehensible God, and assure us that man can not dispense with a knowledge of this God so impossible to conceive of. The most important thing for men is that which is the most impossible for them to comprehend. If God is incomprehensible to man, it would seem rational never to think of Him at all; but religion concludes that man is criminal if he ceases for a moment to revere Him.     VI.--RELIGION IS FOUNDED UPON CREDULITY.  We are told that Divine qualities are not of a nature to be grasped by limited minds. The natural consequence of this principle ought to be that the Divine qualities are not made to employ limited minds; but religion assures us that limited minds should never lose sight of this inconceivable being, whose qualities can not be grasped by them: from which we see that religion is the art of occupying limited minds with that which is impossible for them to comprehend.     VII.--EVERY RELIGION IS AN ABSURDITY.  Religion unites man with God or puts them in communication; but do you say that God is infinite? If God is infinite, no finite being can have communication or any relation with Him. Where there are no relations, there can be no union, no correspondence, no duties. If there are no duties between man and his God, there exists no religion for man. Thus by saying that God is infinite, you annihilate, from that moment, all religion for man, who is a finite being. The idea of infinity is for us in idea without model, without prototype, without object.     VIII.--THE NOTION OF GOD IS IMPOSSIBLE.  If God is an infinite being, there can be neither in the actual world or in another any proportion between man and his God; thus the idea of God will never enter the human mind. In the supposition of a life where men will be more enlightened than in this one, the infinity of God will always place such a distance between his idea and the limited mind of man, that he will not be able to conceive of God any more in a future life than in the present.

His hand had been swallowed up by a huge palm and thick iron-like fingers, and he was staring down on a pair of the broadest shoulders he had seen, with an arching chest to match. This was the pigmy he had imagined--this man with the shoulders of a giant and the chest of a Hercules. Then his eyes ranged over the walls, gradually recovering their animation.  \"Know 'em,\" said Mr. Hume, waving a bronzed hand towards the wall.  \"I think so, sir.\"  \"Just reel off the names.\"  Venning reeled off the names of a score or more of animals without hesitation, and Mr. Hume looked pleased.  \"There are some men,\" he said, \"who come in here and talk over me and round me and under me about fur and feather, and they can't tell a bighorn from a koodoo by the horns on the wall. Now, my friend, you knew those over there in the corner were the horns of a koodoo, but do you know his habits?\"  \"No, sir; but I spent a month watching a Dartmoor deer.\"  \"A month! Can't learn anything in a month, boy; but you've struck the right book. The pages that are spread out under the sky hold the right teaching, for those who wish to learn about animals. There are writers who make a study of structure; they argue from bones, and classify; but bones don't tell us about the living flesh and blood. You take my meaning?\"  \"You make a difference between the structure of animals and their habits.\"  \"That's so, my lad. Ever read Jeffreys, and the sketches by the 'Son of the Marshes'?\"  \"They're splendid.\"  Mr. Hume nodded and filled a pipe, having a footlong stem, made out of the wing-bone of an albatross.  \"I want to describe the personal habits of animals in their surroundings. I said 'personal' habits. Do you take me?\"  \"No, sir.\"  \"You think I should use another word, and say, perhaps, 'distinctive' habits. I say personal. Now, you take a lion--a bush lion or a veld lion, a yellow lion or a black lion, young or old. That lion, whichever one you take, is a lion by himself. He's got his own character and his own experience. All lions have ways in common because they're built alike. They're heavy and muscular because they've got to pull down big game; and because they're heavy they move slowly, and because they move slowly they've got to adopt common tactics in hunting. Good; but one lion differs from another, and so with other animals, right away through the list. So, I say, one must study the personal habits of animals in their own back yard, so to say, before he can give a true description of them. Do you take my meaning?\"  \"I should like nothing better than to study animals in their home,\" said the boy, burning with excitement.  \"And the two of you think you would like to join me in my expedition?\"  Mr. Hume looked at them out of calm yellowish eyes as if he were studying them.  \"We should,\" they said eagerly.  \"Think it will turn out a picnic--a glorified sort of camping-out, with black fellows to wait on you, and a lot of shooting and fishing? Is that your idea?\"  \"We were talking about that this morning,\" said Compton, \"and we came to the conclusion that exploring was hard work. We are prepared for rough living.\"  \"That's right. And you tell me that you are free to go without giving anxiety to relatives, eh?\"  \"We neither of us have near relatives.\"  Mr. Hume stood up and felt each one over in turn, making them draw deep breaths.  \"Seem sound,\" he mused, \"in wind and limb. But there is one thing. The great danger in Central Africa is from fever--not from animals or blacks.\" Here he took down a bottle of white powder, and placed a large pinch in a wine-glass of water.  \"Quinine is the traveler's stand-by, but there are some who cannot take quinine, It has no effect on them, and such people have no business to set foot in fever districts. Drink this?\"  Compton emptied the glass with a wry face, and Venning, when his turn came, shuddered; but they got the dose down, and smiled.  \"Now,\" said Mr. Hume, \"you both of you give me references to the headmaster of your school, and I will give you one in return. I will make inquiries about you, and I would advise you to make inquiries about me. You can come back here to-morrow afternoon, and if we are mutually satisfied, we will then fix up a contract.\"  \"I don't think we require a reference,\" said Venning.  \"Why not?\" said Mr. Hume, sharply.  \"Because,\" blurted out Venning, turning red--\"because you have lived among animals.\"  Mr. Hume laughed heartily with a deep rumbling laugh.  \"Animals are tricky, boy; and yet,\" he added, \"there may be a meaning in what you say. They have a dignity in death that is grand. Go and make your inquiries, lads. I am Dave Hume, the hunter, and my life has been passed in wild lands, but there are some in London who know me.\"  He rose up to open the door, and Venning overtopped him by inches, yet he did not look either small or unwieldy. His step was springy, and his head, poised on a massive neck, was well set, with the chin raised. He was a man, evidently, who had always looked the world straight in the face. His eyes had a yellowish tinge, and in their colour and their calm they reminded Venning somehow of a lion, an impression heightened by the tawny hue of a long beard.  The next day, the references having been satisfactorily followed up, the contract was entered upon, and the two boys paid over the sum of Pounds 50 each to David Hume, who in his turn agreed to let them share in any profits which the expedition might make, from any source whatever.  \"Profits, Mr. Hume?\" they asked.  \"Profits from hunting, from trading, or from discovery. I don't say that we shall make anything. The chances are, of course, that we may lose all before we are a month out, but it is always well to be business-like. There is gold in Central Africa. We may discover a gold reef. There are new animals in the forest. We may catch an okapi, and if we could land it in England it would fetch a large sum. We might snare a live gorilla, and there is not a gorilla in the zoological gardens of Europe.\"  \"A gorilla!\" said Venning, thinking of a picture he had seen of an erect man-ape bending a rifle-barrel into an arch as if it were a cane.  \"A gorilla!\" said Compton. \"I should like to find the Garden of Rest.\"  \"You have heard his story, Mr. Venning?\" said the hunter, nodding his head at Compton.  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Well, it was because of that story that I have taken you two into my expedition; otherwise I should have been obliged to decline your services on account of your youth. But the story interested me, and I will do my best to help Compton in his search.\"  \"Thank you,\" said Compton, quietly.  \"The Garden of Rest!\" mused the hunter. \"That, I take it, would be an Arabian phrase; for such a term would not occur to a native, who is too often idle to  attach much value to a state of rest. It sounds peaceful;  but I have it in my mind that if we ever reach the place,  it will be only after much hard work, much suffering, and danger. You understand that this is no pleasure excursion?\"  \"We do, sir,\" said Compton; \"yet we expect to get much pleasure from the expedition.\"  \"Another word. I am not an exacting man; but there is one thing I will not tolerate, and that is disobedience. It is well to understand that now;\" and there came a stern expression into those singular eyes.  \"That is only right,\" said Compton; and Venning agreed.    CHAPTER II  A NOVEL CRAFT  A month was devoted to preparation--a month that was full of pleasure to the two friends, for they came into close touch with Dave Hume the hunter, and learnt to regard him almost as a brother. Ordinarily, he was curt in his speech and cold in manner, especially with strangers; but at night, when he had shed his boots and coat, he would talk to them freely of his hunting experiences, and listen with interest to their opinions. He never laughed at their mistakes, nor damped their enthusiasm, but he got the best out of them by a fine courtesy that seemed part of his nature.  Thus it was that when, early in the first week, Venning said he had an idea for a boat that could be easily carried round the cataracts and worked without much labour, he was at once encouraged to give plans and specifications.  \"I read once about a 'sneak-box'--a flat-bottomed shooting canoe-- that could carry a sail and serve at the same time as a cabin.\"  \"I have used one myself duck-shooting. Go on.\"  \"Well, sir, I built a boat on the plan given, and spent a holiday one year on the Broads. It drew very little water, and was easily managed. However, you know all that. But what I was thinking about was a design for a larger boat of the kind, with a propeller attached to it which could be worked by lever.\"  \"By a lever?\"  \"Perhaps you have seen a lame man working a bicycle by a lever-- well, after that principle. There would be a steel rod with cog- wheels, and one man could work the lever as the lame cyclist does without the labour of  rowing.\" Venning waited nervously for the criticism.  \"At any rate the lever would be a relief after the paddles,\" said Mr. Hume, gravely.  \"But that is not all,\" continued the inventor, hastily. \"I would rig up a light American windmill amidships, which could work the screw and get more speed with a following wind in conjunction with a sail rigged up forward.\"  \"Bravo, my boy!\" said Mr. Hume, laughing. \"How many revolutions of the screw to the minute do you expect to get out of your windmill?\"  \"That depends on the power of the wind, sir. Do you think it is a mad scheme?\"  \"It would impress the natives,\" said Compton, \"and at any rate we could start wheat-milling, you know, in case we came to the end of our resources.\"  \"There's no wheat in Central Africa, you duffer! Besides, sir, it's mainly a question of gear. With a lever, cog-wheels, and a running chain after the pattern of the cycle chain, one could----\"  \"And ball bearings,\" suggested Compton, slyly.  \"Yes; and ball bearings--the friction would be reduced, and we could get more power out "]]]
