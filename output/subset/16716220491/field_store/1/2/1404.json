The south wall, which was in a dangerous condition, was to be supported by three internal braces, as shown in the plan, plate CXVII. The longest brace or beam was necessarily of wood, as the wide range of temperature in this region, even between day and night, would produce so much expansion and contraction in an iron rod 60 feet long that without some compensating device the wall would be rocked on its base and its rapid destruction necessarily follow.   EXECUTION OF THE WORK  Appended to that portion of the sundry civil appropriation act approved March. 2, 1889,[1] in which certain expenses of the United States Geological Survey are provided for, is the following item:    Repair of the ruin of Casa Grande, Arizona: To enable the Secretary   of the Interior to repair and protect the ruin of Casa Grande,   situate in Pinal County, near Florence, Arizona, two thousand   dollars; and the President is authorized to reserve from settlement   and sale the land on which said ruin is situated and so much of the   public land adjacent thereto as in his judgment may be necessary for   the protection of said ruin and of the ancient city of which it is a   part.      [Footnote 1: 25 Statutes, p. 961.]  On the 12th of April, 1889, there was a conference between the Secretary of the Interior and the Commissioner of the General Land Office looking to the execution of the law, and on the 16th of that month the Commissioner submitted a statement on the subject, calling attention to the fact that the appropriation would not be available until July 1 following, and suggesting that a special agent should be sent out to examine the ruin. This suggestion was approved, and on April 27, 1889, Special Agent Alexander L. Morrison, of the General Land Office, was instructed to proceed to the ruins for the purpose of investigating and reporting as to what method should be adopted for their repair and protection. Mr Morrison was further instructed to report \"all the facts obtainable as regards said ruins of 'Casa Grande,' in order that appropriate action may be taken by the Department for its preservation.\"  On May 15,1889, Mr Morrison submitted a report to the Commissioner, describing his journey, the location of the ruin, the ruin itself, and other ruins in the vicinity. He stated that danger to the ruin was of three kinds--(1) by vandalism, (2) by elements, (3) by undermining. He recommended the construction of a roof and an underpinning of stone for the walls. Finally, he gave some historical notes, and closed with a peroration.  Mr Morrison's plans were found impracticable, as their execution would require an expenditure of many times the sum appropriated, and on September 23, 1889, all the papers in the case were transmitted by the Secretary to the Director of the Geological Survey, \"for appropriate action under the clause of the act referred to, as being within the province of your Bureau.\" It was ordered that the work be commenced without the least delay, and November 27, 1889, Mr Victor Mindeleff, of the Bureau of Ethnology, was detailed by the Director and ordered to proceed to the ruin and report on the best means of repairing it and protecting it from further destruction. He was also directed to make other investigations in the vicinity, which have no relation to the present case.  On July 1, 1890, Mr Mindeleff submitted a report. He described the ruins of which Casa Grande is the type, and also Casa Grande itself. He also made a statement of the condition of the ruin and suggested that the main destruction \"was due to the undermining of the walls, and stated that much damage had been done by tourists. He recommended (1) that an area about the ruin be fenced in; (2) that a man be located permanently on the ground to watch the ruins; (3) that the ruins be cleaned out; (4) that the walls be underpinned with brick instead of stone, as previously suggested; (5) that the tops of the walls, after removing several inches to afford a good bearing surface, be treated with a coping of cement. It was regarded that this plan, if carried into effect, would afford sufficient protection against the weather, but a plan for a roof was submitted should such a structure be deemed desirable and practicable. Mr Mindeleff also recommended a number of tie-rods and beams, the replacement of the broken-out lintels, and the filling of the cavities above.  This plan was approved in its general features, but the means provided for its execution were found insufficient. A further complication arose from the fact that a few months later Mr Mindeleff severed his connection with the Bureau of Ethnology and his knowledge became no longer available.  November 20, 1890, the writer was ordered to proceed to the ruin and inaugurate the work of repair, following, so far as practicable, the plans already approved. He left Washington soon afterward and reached the ruin late in December. It was found necessary to make a detailed survey of the ruin and of the group of which it forms a part, and to make plans and sections showing the probable amount of excavation for the use of those who were invited to bid on the work. Furthermore, the amount appropriated was so well known to be inadequate that great difficulty was experienced in obtaining bids, and it was only through the efficient cooperation of the Reverend I. T. Whittemore at Florence and of Mr C. A. Garlick at Phoenix that success was finally achieved. Two bids were received from the former place and one from the latter; but this was not accomplished until March 17, 1891, the date when the last bid was received. In the meantime the writer, having completed his work at Casa Grande, so far as he could, had entered, in January, on an archeologic investigation of the valley of the Rio Verde, in compliance with his orders to that effect.  It was found impossible to execute all the work deemed requisite for the preservation of the ruin within the limits of the appropriation. A selection of items became necessary, therefore, and those which were of most importance were chosen. Even in this, however, it was found that a maximum limit on the amount of work to be done on each item must be set, and this limit was considerably below the amount of work estimated to be necessary.  The first thing to be done was, of course, the clearing out of the rubbish and debris. The item next in importance was the underpinning of the walls with brick wherever it was needed. The third item was the restoration of the lintels and the filling of the cavities above them. The fourth item was the tying in of the south wall, or of the several parts of it, with braces. This was the only feature of the plan which would appreciably disfigure the ruin, but some such device was deemed essential for the preservation of the south wall.  These four items consumed practically all of the amount appropriated, and the other items of the original plan were therefore omitted. The bid of T. L. Stouffer and F. E. White, of Florence, Arizona, covering the four items, was accepted, and a contract was made with them, under date of May 9, 1891, for the execution of the work for the sum of $1,985. This contract, together with the specifications, plans, and other drawings which formed part of it, accompany this report. It was transmitted to the Director of the Geological Survey, and by him approved and forwarded to the Secretary of the Interior June 6, 1891. It was approved by the Acting Secretary June 20, 1891. Finally, on July 20, 1891, it was placed on file, together \"with the bids, proposals, and all the original papers.\"  A time limit of two months was made in the contract, expiring August 20, 1891, but it was changed to four months from July 1, 1891, expiring October 31, 1891. Before the time expired, however, Mr H. G. Rizer, then chief clerk of the Bureau of Ethnology, was ordered to proceed to Casa Grande ruin to examine the work done and, if in accord with the terms of the contract and the specifications, to certify the amount due the contractors. He submitted a report, under date of November 24, 1891, which is appended hereto. He also obtained six photographic negatives of the work as it stood a short time before its completion, and two of these (reproduced in plates CXX and CXXI) have been utilized in the preparation of this report.  Mr Rizer found that a considerable amount of work had been done by the contractors in excess of that authorized, and also that not sufficient work had been done to render the repairs permanently effective. Under the terms of the contract, no amount in excess of that stated ($1,985) could be paid, and payment of this amount was made late in 1891. On January 7, 1892, the contractors filed a claim for extra work on the ruin amounting to $600.40. The work was actually performed, but the terms of the contract were clear, and the claim was therefore disapproved January 28, 1892.  It would have been desirable to have had a supervisor of the work, but as the contract consumed practically all of the amount appropriated no provision could be made for one. It is fortunate, therefore, that the Reverend I. T. Whittemore, who had in the meantime been appointed honorary custodian of the ruin, generously undertook to look after the work without compensation, and on its conclusion the small sum remaining ($15) was turned over to him, thus exhausting the appropriation. In the sundry civil appropriation act for the year ending June 30, 1893, provision was made for a salaried custodian of the ruin, and Mr Whittemore was appointed to this position. Similar provision has been continued from year to year to the present time.  It is to be regretted that the necessities of the case, imposed by the limited amount appropriated, compelled the fixing of a maximum amount of work so far below the amount"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17496"],["title","Elsie at Home (#1)"],["body","we will just give him a full account of her symptoms and ask his advice through the telephone. Then he will tell us what would better be done to-night, and call in to see her to-morrow morning.\"  The ladies all agreed that that would be the better plan and it was presently carried out. The doctor would have come at once, in spite of the storm, had it seemed necessary, but from the account given he deemed it not so.  \"I will come directly after breakfast to-morrow morning,\" he concluded, after giving his advice in regard to what should be done immediately.  \"That is satisfactory; and now I will go at once to mamma and carry out his directions for to-night,\" said Evelyn.  \"Remembering that we are all ready to assist in any and every possible way,\" added her uncle, smiling kindly upon her.  \"Yes, indeed!\" said Grandma Elsie; \"and you must not hesitate to call upon me if you need help.\"  \"No, no, mother dear. I put my veto upon that!\" exclaimed Mrs. Leland. \"You are not a really old-looking woman yet, but are not as vigorous as you were some years ago, and I cannot afford to let you run any risk of diminishing your stock of health and strength by loss of sleep or over-exertion. Call upon me, Eva, should you need any assistance.\"  \"Very well, daughter, I shall not insist upon the privilege of losing sleep,\" returned Grandma Elsie with a smile, \"but may perhaps be permitted to make myself slightly useful during the day.\"  \"Yes, slightly, mother dear, and at such time as you would not be otherwise improving by taking needed rest or recreation,\" Mrs. Leland replied as she hastened away with Eva, with the purpose to make sure that her newly arrived guest lacked for nothing which she could provide.  \"At last, Evelyn, child! I suppose you have not been long gone, but it seemed so to my impatience,\" was Laura's salutation as Eva reentered her room.  \"It is sweet to hear you say that, mother dear; sweet to know that you love me so,\" Evelyn said in moved tones, bending down to press a kiss on the wan cheek, \"and I mean to fairly surfeit you with my company in the days and weeks that lie before us.\"  \"And she only waited with the rest of us to consult our good doctor for you, Laura,\" added Mrs. Leland. \"He has prescribed a sleeping potion for to-night, and will call to see you and prescribe further in the morning.\"  \"I think I should have been consulted,\" returned the invalid in a tone of irritation; \"my money is all gone and he may never get his pay.\"  \"Oh, don't trouble about that!\" exclaimed Mrs. Leland and Evelyn in a breath, the former adding, \"His charges are not heavy and it will be strange indeed if we cannot find a way to meet and defray them.\"  \"Of course we can and will, and you are not to concern yourself any more about it, mamma,\" added Evelyn in a tone of playful authority. \"What would be the use when you have a tolerably rich, grown-up daughter, whose principal business and pleasure it will be to take care of and provide for her long-lost, but now happily recovered mother. And here comes uncle with your sleeping potion,\" she added, as Mr. Leland at that moment appeared in the doorway, cup in hand.  \"Here is something which I hope will quiet your cough, Laura,\" he said, coming to the bedside. \"It is not bad to take, either, and will be likely to secure you a good night's rest.\"  \"I don't know,\" she returned doubtfully, eyeing the cup with evident disfavour, \"I was never good at dosing.\"  \"You prefer lying awake, racked with that distressing cough?\"  \"No,\" she sighed, taking the cup from his hand, \"even quite a bad dose would be better than that. And it was not so bad after all,\" she concluded as she returned the cup, after swallowing its contents.  \"Glad to hear you say so,\" he said in reply. \"And now take my further advice--lie still and go to sleep, leaving all the talk with Eva till to-morrow. Good-night to you both.\" And he left the room, followed presently by his wife, who lingered only until she had made sure that all the wants of the invalid were fully supplied.  Laura had already fallen into a sweet sleep, under the soothing influence of the draught, and Eva presently stretched herself beside her, and with a heart filled with contending emotions--love for this her only remaining parent, joy in their reunion, sorrow and care in view of her evident exhaustion and ill-health, and plans for making her remaining days happy--lay awake for a time silently asking for guidance and help from on high, then fell into dreamless, refreshing sleep.     CHAPTER II.   Morning found the invalid somewhat refreshed by her night's rest, yet too languid and feeble to leave her room, and her day was spent reclining upon a couch, with her daughter by her side. Dr. Conly made an early call, prescribed, talked to her and Eva in a cheerful strain, saying he hoped that rest and a change of weather would soon bring her at least a measure of relief and strength; but in reply to the anxious questioning of Mr. and Mrs. Leland, he acknowledged that he found her far gone in consumption, and did not think she could last many weeks.  \"Poor dear Eva! how very sad it will be for her to lose her mother so soon after recovering her!\" sighed Mrs. Leland. \"I think we must let her remain in ignorance of the danger for a time at least.\"  \"Yes,\" assented her husband; \"though we must not neglect any effort in our power to prepare Laura for the great change which awaits her,\" he added with a look of anxiety and care.  \"Nor fail to offer up earnest petitions for her at the Throne of Grace,\" said Grandma Elsie, in her low, sweet tones. \"Oh, what a blessing, what a comfort it is that we may take there all our fears, cares, and anxieties for ourselves and others! And how precious the Saviour's promise, 'If two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that you shall ask, it shall be done for you of my Father which is in heaven'!\"  \"Yes, mother dear,\" assented Mrs. Leland, \"and we will claim and plead it for our poor dear Laura, and for Eva, that she may be sustained under the bereavement which awaits her.\"  \"Yes,\" said Dr. Conly, \"and there are many of our friends who will be ready to join us in the petition. I am going now to Woodburn--the captain having telephoned me that one of the servants is ill--and we all know that he and his will be full of sympathy for Eva and her sick mother.\"  \"No doubt they will,\" said Grandma Elsie, \"both as Christians and as warm friends of Evelyn. And it will be quite the same with our other friends.\"  With that the doctor bade good-morning and took his departure in the direction of Woodburn. The family there were surprised and interested by the news he had to tell of the arrival at Fairview, and of Laura's feeble and ailing condition. They were evidently full of sympathy for both mother and daughter, and had any help been needed would have given it gladly. But the doctor assured them that rest and quiet were at present the sick one's most pressing need.  \"Poor dear Eva! I am so sorry for her!\" sighed Lucilla when the doctor had gone. \"Papa, don't you think I might make myself of use helping her with the nursing?\"  \"Not at present, daughter; though I can testify to your ability in that line, and your services may possibly be needed at some future time,\" he answered with an affectionate look and smile.  \"Yes, Lu is a capital nurse, I think,\" said Violet, \"but whatever she does is sure to be well done.\"  \"Thank you, Mamma Vi,\" returned the young girl, blushing with pleasure; \"it is most kind in you to say that; but if I am thorough in anything, most of the credit belongs to my father, who has never allowed me to content myself with a slovenly performance of my duties.\"  \"No,\" he said, \"what is worth doing at all is worth doing well; that is a lesson I have endeavoured to impress upon each one of my children, and one which I think they have all learned pretty thoroughly.\"  \"And they have always had the teaching of example as well as precept, from their father,\" remarked Violet with a look of loving appreciation up into his face; \"so that it would be strange indeed if they had not learned it.\"  \"Indeed that is true, mamma,\" said Grace. \"It does seem to me that papa does everything he undertakes as thoroughly well as anyone possibly could.\"  \"A very good idea for one's children to cultivate,\" laughed the captain. Then consulting his watch, \"But it is high time we were in the schoolroom, daughters. Elsie and Ned have been there this half hour, and probably have a lesson or two ready to recite.\"  \"And Eva will not be with us to-day; probably not for many more days,\" remarked Lucilla with a slight sigh of disappointment and regret, as she and Grace rose and gave prompt obedience to her father's implied order.  \"Yes,\" he said, \"I fear so; but her first duty is to her mother.\"  So Evelyn herself felt, and nobly she discharged it; neglecting nothing in her power for the relief and enjoyment of the invalid who, though often fretful, exacting, and unreasonable, was yet nearest and dearest to her of all earthly creatures. The young girl's loving patience seemed never to fail, and her heart was continually going up in earnest, silent petitions that her beloved parent might be made meet for the inheritance of the saints in light; that she might learn to love Him who had died to redeem her from death and the power of the grave, and to give her an abundant entrance into his kingdom and glory.  The doubt of Laura's preparation for death and eternity, amounting to almost certainty that it was lacking, made this nursing an even sadder one than had been that of Eric, Evelyn's father, years ago. To him talk of things heavenly and divine had ever seemed easy and natural, and with the certainty that he was passing away from earth came the full assurance that he was ready to depart and be with Christ in glory.  But Laura hastily repelled the slightest allusion to eternity and a preparation for it. Evelyn's only consolation was in the"]]]
