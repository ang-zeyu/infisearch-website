(11)   The subject of Elocution, so far as it is deemed applicable to a work of this kind, will be considered under the following heads, viz:   1. ARTICULATION.           4. READING VERSE. 2. INFLECTION.             5. THE VOICE. 3. ACCENT AND EMPHASIS.    6. GESTURE.    I. ARTICULATION. (11)  Articulation is the utterance of the elementary sounds of a language, and of their combinations.  As words consist of one or more elementary sounds, the first object of the student should he to acquire the power of uttering those sounds with distinctness, smoothness, and force. This result can be secured only by careful practice, which must be persevered in until the learner has acquired a perfect control of his organs of speech.    ELEMENTARY SOUNDS. (12)  An Elementary Sound is a simple, distinct sound made by the organs of speech.  The Elementary Sounds of the English language are divided into Vocals, Subvocals, and Aspirates.    VOCALS. (12)  Vocals are sounds which consist of pure tone only. They are the most prominent elements of all words, and it is proper that they should first receive attention. A vocal may be represented by one letter, as in the word hat, or by two or more letters, as in heat, beauty. A diphthong is a union of two vocals, commencing with one and ending with the other. It is usually represented by two letters, as in the words oil, boy, out, now.  Each of these can he uttered with great force, so as to give a distinct expression of its sound, although the voice be suddenly suspended, the moment the sound is produced. This is done by putting the lips, teeth, tongue, and palate in their proper position, and then expelling each sound from the throat in the same manner that the syllable \"ah!\" is uttered in endeavoring to deter a child from something it is about to do; thus, a'--a'--a'--.  Let the pupil he required to utter every one of the elements in the Table with all possible suddenness and percussive force, until he is able to do it with ease and accuracy. This must not he considered as accomplished until he can give each sound with entire clearness, and with all the suddenness of the crack of a rifle. Care must be taken that the vocal alone be heard; there must be no consonantal sound, and no vocal sound other than the one intended.  At first, the elementary sounds may be repeated by the class in concert; then separately.    TABLE OF VOCALS. (13)  Long Sounds.  Sound   as in  a       hate e       err a       hare i       pine a       pass o       no a       far oo      cool a       fall u       tube e       eve u       burn   Short Sounds.  Sound   as in  a       mat o       hot e       met oo      book i       it u       us   Diphthongs. oi, oy, as in oil, boy. ou, ow, as in out, now.   REMARK I.--In this table, the short sounds are nearly or quite the same, in quantity, as the long sounds. The difference consists chiefly in quality. Let the pupil determine this fact by experiment.  REMARK II.--The vocals are often represented by other letters or combinations of letters than those used in the table: for instance, a is represented by ai as in hail, by ea as in steak, etc.  REMARK III.--As  a general rule, the long vocals and the diphthongs should be articulated with full, clear utterance; but the short vocals have a sharp, distinct, and almost explosive utterance. Weakness of speech follows a failure to observe the first point, while drawling results from carelessness with respect to the second.    SUBVOCALS AND ASPIRATES (13)  Subvocals are those sounds in which the vocalized breath is more or less obstructed.  Aspirates consist of breath only, modified by the vocal organs.  Words ending with subvocal sounds may be selected for practice on the subvocals; words beginning or ending with aspirate sounds may be used for practice on aspirates. Pronounce these words forcibly and distinctly, several times in succession; then drop the other sounds, and repeat the subvocals and aspirates alone. Let the class repeat the words and elements, at first, in concert; then separately.    TABLE OF SUBVOCALS AND ASPIRATES. (14)  Subvocals. as in  b          babe d          bad g          nag j          judge v          move th         with z          buzz z          azure (azh-) w          wine  Aspirates. as in  p          rap t          at k          book ch         rich f          life th         smith s          hiss sh         rush wh         what   REMARK.--These eighteen sounds make nine pairs of cognates. In articulating the aspirates, the vocal organs are put in the position required in the articulation of the corresponding subvocals; but the breath is expelled with some force, without the utterance of any vocal sound. The pupil should first verify this by experiment, and then practice on these cognates.  The following subvocals and aspirate have no cognates:  SUBVOCAL  as in  l         mill ng        sing m         rim r         rule n         run y         yet    ASPIRATE.  h, as in hat.    SUBSTITUTES. (14)  Substitutes are characters used to represent sounds ordinarily represented by other characters.  TABLE OF SUBSTITUTES.

(15)  The most common faults of articulation are dropping an unaccented vowel, sounding incorrectly an unaccented vowel, suppressing final consonants, omitting or mispronouncing syllables, and blending words.   1. Dropping an unaccented vocal.  EXAMPLES.  CORRECT         INCORRECT  gran'a-ry       gran'ry a-ban'don       a-ban-d'n im-mor'tal      im-mor-t'l reg'u-lar       reg'lar in-clem'ent     in-clem'nt par-tic'u-lar   par-tic'lar des'ti-ny       des-t'ny cal-cu-la'tian  cal-cl'a-sh'n un-cer'tain     un-cer-t'n oc-ca'sion      oc-ca-sh'n em'i-nent       em'nent ef'i-gy         ef'gy ag'o-ny         ag'ny man'i-fold      man'fold rev'er-ent      rev'rent cul'ti-vate     cult'vate   2. Sounding incorrectly an unaccented vowel.  EXAMPLES.  CORRECT          INCORRECT  lam-en-ta'-tion  lam-un-ta-tion ter'ri-ble       ter-rub-ble e-ter'nal        e-ter-nul fel'on-y         fel-er-ny ob'sti-nate      ob-stun-it fel'low-ship     fel-ler-ship e-vent'          uv-ent cal'cu-late      cal-ker-late ef'fort          uf-fort reg'u-lar        reg-gy-lur   EXERCISES. (16)  The vocals most likely to be dropped or incorrectly  sounded are italicized.    He attended divine service regularly.   This is my particular request.   She is universally esteemed.   George is sensible of his fault.   This calculation is incorrect.   What a terrible calamity.   His eye through vast immensity can pierce.  Observe these nice dependencies.   He is a formidable adversary.   He is generous to his friends.   A tempest desolated the land.   He preferred death to servitude.   God is the author of all things visible and invisible.   3. Suppressing the final subvocals or aspirates.  EXAMPLE (16)    John an' James are frien's o' my father.   Gi' me some bread.   The want o' men is occasioned by the want o' money.   We seldom fine' men o' principle to ac' thus.   Beas' an' creepin' things were foun' there.   EXERCISES. (17)    He learned to write.   The masts of the ship were cast down.   He entered the lists at the head of his troops.   He is the merriest fellow in existence.   I regard not the world's opinion.   He has three assistants.   The depths"]]]
