I think I have never seen so sudden a change of expression take place in the face of any man. Even in that imperfect light I saw him blanch. I saw a hard glitter come into his eyes. He spoke, evenly, but hoarsely:  \"Put those things down----there, on the table; anywhere.\"  I obeyed him without demur; for something in his manner had chilled me with foreboding.  \"You did not break that stalk?\"  \"No. I found it as you see it.\"  \"Have you smelled the petals?\"  I shook my head. Thereupon, having his eyes fixed upon me with the strangest expression in their gray depths, Nayland Smith said a singular thing.  \"Pronounce, slowly, the words _Sâkya Mûni,_'\" he directed.  I stared at him, scarce crediting my senses; but----  \"I mean it!\" he rapped. \"Do as I tell you.\"  \"Sâkya Mûni,\" I said, in ever increasing wonder.  Smith laughed unmirthfully.  \"Go into the bathroom and thoroughly wash your hands,\" was his next order. \"Renew the water at least three times.\" As I turned to fulfill his instructions, for I doubted no longer his deadly earnestness: \"Beeton!\" he called.  Beeton, very white-faced and shaky, came out from the bedroom as I entered the bathroom, and whist I proceeded carefully to cleanse my hands I heard Smith interrogating him.  \"Have any flowers been brought into the room today, Beeton?\"  \"Flowers, sir? Certainly not. Nothing has ever been brought in here but what I have brought myself.\"  \"You are certain of that?\"  \"Positive.\"  \"Who brought up the meals, then?\"  \"If you'll look into my room here, sir, you'll see that I have enough tinned and bottled stuff to last us for weeks. Sir Gregory sent me out to buy it on the day we arrived. No one else had left or entered these rooms until you came to-night.\"  I returned to find Nayland Smith standing tugging at the lobe of his left ear in evident perplexity. He turned to me.  \"I find my hands over full,\" he said. \"Will you oblige me by telephoning for Inspector Weymouth? Also, I should be glad if you would ask M. Samarkan, the manager, to see me here immediately.\"  As I was about to quit the room--  \"Not a word of our suspicions to M. Samarkan,\" he added; \"not a word about the brass box.\"  I was far along the corridor ere I remembered that which, remembered earlier, had saved me the journey. There was a telephone in every suite. However, I was not indisposed to avail myself of an opportunity for a few moments' undisturbed reflection, and, avoiding the lift, I descended by the broad, marble staircase.  To what strange adventure were we committed? What did the brass coffer contain which Sir Gregory had guarded night and day? Something associated in some way with Tibet, something which he believed to be \"the key of India\" and which had brought in its train, presumably, the sinister \"man with a limp.\"  Who was the \"man with the limp\"? What was the Si-Fan? Lastly, by what conceivable means could the flower, which my friend evidently regarded with extreme horror, have been introduced into Hale's room, and why had I been required to pronounce the words \"Sâkya Mûni\"?  So ran my reflections--at random and to no clear end; and, as is often the case in such circumstances, my steps bore them company; so that all at once I became aware that instead of having gained the lobby of the hotel, I had taken some wrong turning and was in a part of the building entirely unfamiliar to me.  A long corridor of the inevitable white marble extended far behind me. I had evidently traversed it. Before me was a heavily curtained archway. Irritably, I pulled the curtain aside, learnt that it masked a glass-paneled door, opened this door--and found myself in a small court, dimly lighted and redolent of some pungent, incense-like perfume.  One step forward I took, then pulled up abruptly. A sound had come to my ears. From a second curtained doorway, close to my right hand, it came--a sound of muffled _tapping_, together with that of something which dragged upon the floor.  Within my brain the words seemed audibly to form: \"The man with the limp!\"  I sprang to the door; I had my hand upon the drapery ... when a woman stepped out, barring the way!  No impression, not even a vague one, did I form of her costume, save that she wore a green silk shawl, embroidered with raised white figures of birds, thrown over her head and shoulders and draped in such fashion that part of her face was concealed. I was transfixed by the vindictive glare of her eyes, of her huge dark eyes.  They were ablaze with anger--but it was not this expression within them which struck me so forcibly as the fact that they were in some way familiar.  Motionless, we faced one another. Then--  \"You go away,\" said the woman--at the same time extending her arms across the doorway as barriers to my progress.  Her voice had a husky intonation; her hands and arms, which were bare and of old ivory hue, were laden with barbaric jewelry, much of it tawdry silverware of the bazaars. Clearly she was a half-caste of some kind, probably a Eurasian.  I hesitated. The sounds of dragging and tapping had ceased. But the presence of this grotesque Oriental figure only increased my anxiety to pass the doorway. I looked steadily into the black eyes; they looked into mine unflinchingly.  \"You go away, please,\" repeated the woman, raising her right hand and pointing to the door whereby I had entered. \"These private rooms. What you doing here?\"  Her words, despite her broken English, served to recall to me the fact that I was, beyond doubt, a trespasser! By what right did I presume to force my way into other people's apartments?  \"There is some one in there whom I must see,\" I said, realizing, however, that my chance of doing so was poor.  \"You see nobody,\" she snapped back uncompromisingly. \"You go away!\"  She took a step towards me, continuing to point to the door. Where had I previously encountered the glance of those splendid, savage eyes?  So engaged was I with this taunting, partial memory, and so sure, if the woman would but uncover her face, of instantly recognizing her, that still I hesitated. Whereupon, glancing rapidly over her shoulder into whatever place lay beyond the curtained doorway, she suddenly stepped back and vanished, drawing the curtains to with an angry jerk.  I heard her retiring footsteps; then came a loud bang. If her object in intercepting me had been to cover the slow retreat of some one she had succeeded.  Recognizing that I had cut a truly sorry figure in the encounter, I retraced my steps.  By what route I ultimately regained the main staircase I have no idea; for my mind was busy with that taunting memory of the two dark eyes looking out from the folds of the green embroidered shawl. Where, and when, had I met their glance before?  To that problem I sought an answer in vain.  The message despatched to New Scotland Yard, I found M. Samarkan, long famous as a _mâitre d' hôtel_ in Cairo, and now host of London's newest and most palatial _khan_. Portly, and wearing a gray imperial, M. Samarkan had the manners of a courtier, and the smile of a true Greek.  I told him what was necessary, and no more, desiring him to go to suite 14a without delay and also without arousing unnecessary attention. I dropped no hint of foul play, but M. Samarkan expressed profound (and professional) regret that so distinguished, though unprofitable, a patron should have selected the New Louvre, thus early in its history, as the terminus of his career.  \"By the way,\" I said, \"have you Oriental guests with you, at the moment?\"  \"No, monsieur,\" he assured me.  \"Not a certain Oriental lady?\" I persisted.  M. Samarkan slowly shook his head.  \"Possibly monsieur has seen one of the _ayahs?_ There are several Anglo-Indian families resident in the New Louvre at present.\"  An _ayah?_ It was just possible, of course. Yet ...   CHAPTER IV  THE FLOWER OF SILENCE   \"We are dealing now,\" said Nayland Smith, pacing restlessly up and down our sitting-room, \"not, as of old, with Dr. Fu-Manchu, but with an entirely unknown quantity--the Si-Fan.\"  \"For Heaven's sake!\" I cried, \"what is the Si-Fan?\"  \"The greatest mystery of the mysterious East, Petrie. Think. You know, as I know, that a malignant being, Dr. Fu-Manchu, was for some time in England, engaged in 'paving the way' (I believe those words were my own) for nothing less than a giant Yellow Empire. That dream is what millions of Europeans and Americans term 'the Yellow Peril! Very good. Such an empire needs must have----\"  \"An emperor!\"  Nayland Smith stopped his restless pacing immediately in front of me.  \"Why not an _empress_, Petrie!\" he rapped.  His words were something of a verbal thunderbolt; I found myself at loss for any suitable reply.  \"You will perhaps remind me,\" he continued rapidly, \"of the lowly place held by women in the East. I can cite notable exceptions, ancient and modern. In fact, a moment's consideration by a hypothetical body of Eastern dynast-makers not of an emperor but of an empress. Finally, there is a persistent tradition throughout the Far East that such a woman will one day rule over the known peoples. I was assured some years ago, by a very learned pundit, that a princess of incalculably ancient lineage, residing in some secret monastery in Tartary or Tibet, was to be the future empress of the world. I believe this tradition, or the extensive group who seek to keep it alive and potent, to be what is called the Si-Fan!\"  I was past greater amazement; but--  \"This lady can be no longer young, then?\" I asked.  \"On the contrary, Petrie, she remains always young and beautiful by means of a continuous series of reincarnations; also she thus conserves the collated wisdom of many ages. In short, she is the archetype of Lamaism.

Cross hatching indicates area of overlapping of the two forms. The range of _Dipodomys deserti_, not shown on the map, is west of that of _spectabilis_, and so far as known the two do not overlap.]  _Dipodomys spectabilis spectabilis_ Merriam requires comparison with three other forms of kangaroo rats in the same general region, namely, _D. deserti_ Stephens, of approximately the same size, and _D. merriami_ Mearns and _D. ordii_ Woodhouse, the last two of decidedly smaller size. The range of _deserti_ lies principally to the west of that of _spectabilis_, and the two do not, so far as known, overlap. On the other hand, _merriami_ and _ordii_, and subspecies, occur over a large part of the range of _spectabilis_, living in very close proximity to its burrows; _merriami_ is even suspected of pillaging the stores of _spectabilis_. The range of _merriami_, however, is much more extensive than that of _spectabilis_ (Fig. 1), which argues against a definite ecological dependence or relationship. Separation of the four forms mentioned may be easily accomplished by the following key:  _Key to Species of_ Dipodomys _in Arizona._  _a^1_. Size much larger (hind foot and greatest length of skull more than 42 millimeters); tail tipped with white.       _b^1_. Upper parts dark brownish buffy; tail dark brownish or      blackish with more sharply contrasted white tip; interparietal      broader, distinctly separating mastoids (range in Arizona mainly      southeastern part)                          =Dipodomys spectabilis.=       _b^2_. Upper parts light ochraceous-buffy; tail pale brownish with      less sharply contrasted white tip; interparietal narrower, reduced      to mere spicule between mastoids (range in Arizona mainly      southwestern part)                              =Dipodomys deserti.=  _a^2_. Size much smaller (hind foot and greatest length of skull less than 42 millimeters); tail not tipped with white.       _b^1_. Hind foot with four toes                =Dipodomys merriami.=       _b^2_. Hind foot with five toes                   =Dipodomys ordii.=  On account of the small size, _merriami_ and _ordii_ do not require detailed color comparison with the other two. The general color of the upperparts of _spectabilis_ is much darker than that of _deserti_; whereas _spectabilis_ is ochraceous-buff or light ochraceous-buff grizzled with blackish, _deserti_ is near pale ochraceous-buff and lacks the blackish.  The color of the upperparts alone amply suffices to distinguish _spectabilis_ and _deserti_; but the different coloration of the tail is the most obvious diagnostic feature. The near black of the middle portion of the tail, the conspicuous white side stripes, and the pure white tip make the tail of _spectabilis_ stand in rather vivid contrast to the pale-brown and whitish tail of _deserti_.  The dens of the two larger species of _Dipodomys_--_spectabilis_ and _deserti_--can be distinguished at a glance from those of the two smaller--_merriami_ and _ordii_--by the fact that the mounds of the former are usually of considerable size and the burrow mouths are of greater diameter. On the Range Reserve _merriami_ erects no mounds, but excavates its burrows in the open or at the base of _Prosopis_, _Lycium_, or other brush. The mounds of _spectabilis_ are higher than those of _deserti_, the entrances are larger, and they are located in harder soil (Pl. III, Fig. 1). The dens of _deserti_ are usually more extensive in surface area than those of _spectabilis_, and have a greater number of openings (Pl. III, Fig. 2).   [Illustration: PLATE II. FIG. 1.--WINTER VIEW OF AREA INHABITED BY KANGAROO RATS.  A water-hole scene on the U. S. Range Reserve at the base of the Santa Rita Mountains, Ariz., where cooperative investigations are being conducted to ascertain the relation of rodents to forage. This is typical of a large section of country occupied by _Dipodomys spectabilis spectabilis_ and _Dipodomys merriami_. The brush is mesquite (_Prosopis_), cat's-claw (_Acacia_), and paloverde (_Cercidium_).]  [Illustration: PLATE II. FIG. 2.--KANGAROO RAT COUNTRY FOLLOWING SUMMER DROUGHT.  An area of the U. S.

This species excavates its den in soft, sandy soil. The tree is a species of _Dalea_.]     DESCRIPTION.   GENERAL CHARACTERS.  Size large; ears moderate, ear from crown (taken in dry skin) 9 or 10 millimeters; eyes prominent; whiskers long and sensitive; fore feet short and weak; hind feet long and powerful, provided with four well-developed toes; tail very long, usually 30 to 40 per cent longer than the body. Cranium triangular, the occiput forming the base and the point of the nose the apex of the triangle, much flattened, auditory and particularly mastoid bullae conspicuously inflated.   COLOR.  General color above, brownish buffy, varying in some specimens to lighter buffy tints, grizzled with black; oblique hip stripes white; tail with dark-brown or blackish stripes above and below, running into blackish about halfway between base and tip, and with two lateral side stripes of white to a point about halfway back; tail tipped with pure white for about 40 millimeters (Pl. I). Underparts white, hairs white to bases, with some plumbeous and buffy hairs about base of tail; fore legs and fore feet white all around; hind legs like back, brown above, hairs with gray bases, becoming blackish (fuscous-black or chætura-black) about ankles, hairs on under side white to bases; hind feet white above, dark-brown or blackish (near fuscous) below.  Color variations in a series of 12 specimens from the type locality and points widely scattered through the range of _spectabilis_ consist in minor modifications of the degree of coloration, length of white tip of tail, and length of white lateral tail stripes. In general the color pattern and characters are remarkably uniform. Young specimens, while exhibiting the color pattern and general color of adults, are conspicuously less brown, and more grayish.  There appears to be little variation in color with season. In the series at hand, most specimens taken during the fall, winter, and spring are very slightly browner than those of summer, suggesting that the fresh pelage following the fall molt is a little brighter than is the pelage after being worn all winter and into the following summer. But at most the difference is slight.   OIL GLAND.  Upon separating the hairs of the middle region of the back about a third of the distance between the ears and the rump, one uncovers a prominent gland, elliptical in outline, with long axis longitudinal and about 9 millimeters in length. The gland presents a roughened and granular appearance, and fewer hairs grow upon it than elsewhere on the back. The hairs in the vicinity are frequently matted, as if with a secretion. In worn stage of pelage the gland may be visible from above without separating the hairs. Bailey has suggested that this functions as an oil gland for dressing the fur, and our observations bear out this view. Kangaroo rats kept in captivity without earth or sand soon come to have a bedraggled appearance, as if the pelage were moist. When supplied with fine, dusty sand, they soon recover their normal sleek appearance. Apparently the former condition is due to an excess of oil, the latter to the absorption of the excess in a dust bath. The oil is doubtless an important adjunct to the preservation of the skin and hair amid the dusty surroundings in which the animal lives.   MEASUREMENTS AND WEIGHTS.  External measurements include: _Total length_, from tip of nose to tip of tail without hairs, measured before skinning; _tail vertebræ_, length of tail from point in angle when tail is bent at right angles to body to tip of tail without hairs; and _hind foot_, from heel to tip of longest claw.  The following are measurements of a series from the U. S. Range Reserve:       [Transcriber note: Next line was corrected per erratum. The      original text was of the following paragraph (_Averages for 17      adult females: Total length, 326.4 millimeters_).]  Average measurements of 30 adult specimens of both sexes: Total length, 326.2 millimeters (349-310); tail vertebræ, 188.4 (208-180); hind foot, 49.5 (51-47); the average weight of 29 adult specimens of both sexes was 114.5 grams (131.9-98.0).  Averages for 17 adult females: Total length, 326.4 millimeters (349-310); tail vertebræ, 188.8 (208-179); weight (16 individuals), 113.7 (131.9-98.0); excluding pregnant females, 13 individuals averaged 112.9 grams (131.9-98.0).  Averages for 13 adult males: Total length, 326 millimeters (345-311); tail vertebræ, 187.8 (202-168); weight, 116.8 grams (129-100).  There appears to be no significant difference in the measurements and weights of males and females, with the possible exception of the comparison of adult males and adult nonpregnant females.
