The general policy of a newspaper with regard to special feature stories is the same as its policy concerning news. Both are determined by the character of its circulation. A paper that is read largely by business and professional men provides news and special articles that satisfy such readers. A paper that aims to reach the so-called masses naturally selects news and features that will appeal to them. If a newspaper has a considerable circulation outside the city where it is published, the editors, in framing their policy, cannot afford to overlook their suburban and rural readers. The character of its readers, in a word, determines the character of a paper's special feature stories.  The newspaper is primarily local in character. A city, a state, or at most a comparatively small section of the whole country, is its particular field. Besides the news of its locality, it must, of course, give significant news of the world at large. So, too, in addition to local feature articles, it should furnish special feature stories of a broader scope. This distinctively local character of newspapers differentiates them from magazines of national circulation in the matter of acceptable subjects for special articles.  The frequency of publication of newspapers, as well as their ephemeral character, leads, in many instances, to the choice of comparatively trivial topics for some articles. Merely to give readers entertaining matter with which to occupy their leisure at the end of a day's work or on Sunday, some papers print special feature stories on topics of little or no importance, often written in a light vein. Articles with no more serious purpose than that of helping readers to while away a few spare moments are obviously better adapted to newspapers, which are read rapidly and immediately cast aside, than to periodicals.  The sensationalism that characterizes the policy of some newspapers affects alike their news columns and their magazine sections. Gossip, scandal, and crime lend themselves to melodramatic treatment as readily in special feature articles as in news stories. On the other hand, the relatively few magazines that undertake to attract readers by sensationalism, usually do so by means of short stories and serials rather than by special articles.  All newspapers, in short, use special feature stories on local topics, some papers print trivial ones, and others \"play up\" sensational material; whereas practically no magazine publishes articles of these types.  SUNDAY MAGAZINE SECTIONS. The character and scope of special articles for the Sunday magazine section of newspapers have been well summarized by two well-known editors of such sections. Mr. John O'Hara Cosgrove, editor of the _New York Sunday World Magazine_, and formerly editor of _Everybody's Magazine_, gives this as his conception of the ideal Sunday magazine section:      The real function of the Sunday Magazine, to my thinking, is to     present the color and romance of the news, the most authoritative     opinions on the issues and events of the day, and to chronicle     promptly the developments of science as applied to daily life. In     the grind of human intercourse all manner of curious, heroic,     delightful things turn up, and for the most part, are dismissed in a     passing note. Behind every such episode are human beings and a     story, and these, if fairly and artfully explained, are the very     stuff of romance. Into every great city men are drifting daily from     the strange and remote places of the world where they have survived     perilous hazards and seen rare spectacles. Such adventures are the     treasure troves of the skilful reporter. The cross currents and     reactions that lead up to any explosion of greed or passion that we     call crime are often worth following, not only for their plots, but     as proofs of the pain and terror of transgression. Brave deeds or     heroic resistances are all too seldom presented in full length in     the news, and generously portrayed prove the nobility inherent in     every-day life.      The broad domain of the Sunday magazine editor covers all that may     be rare and curious or novel in the arts and sciences, in music and     verse, in religion and the occult, on the stage and in sport.     Achievements and controversies are ever culminating in these diverse     fields, and the men and women actors therein make admirable subjects     for his pages. Provided the editor has at his disposal skilled     writers who have the fine arts of vivid and simple exposition and of     the brief personal sketch, there is nothing of human interest that     may not be presented.  The ideal Sunday magazine, as Mr. Frederick Boyd Stevenson, Sunday editor of the _Brooklyn Eagle_, sees it, he describes thus:      The new Sunday magazine of the newspaper bids fair to be a crisp,     sensible review and critique of the live world. It has developed a     special line of writers who have learned that a character sketch and     interview of a man makes you \"see\" the man face to face and talk     with him yourself. If he has done anything that gives him a place in     the news of to-day, he is presented to you. You know the man.      It seems to me that the leading feature of the Sunday magazine     should be the biggest topic that will be before the public on the     Sunday that the newspaper is printed. It should be written by one     who thoroughly knows his subject, who is forceful in style and     fluent in words, who can make a picture that his readers can see,     and seeing, realize. So every other feature of the Sunday magazine     should have points of human interest, either by contact with the     news of the day or with men and women who are doing something     besides getting divorces and creating scandals.      I firmly believe that the coming Sunday magazine will contain     articles of information without being dull or encyclop√¶dic, articles     of adventure that are real and timely, articles of scientific     discoveries that are authentic, interviews with men and women who     have messages, and interpretations of news and analyses of every-day     themes, together with sketches, poems, and essays that are not     tedious, but have a reason for being printed.  THE MAGAZINE FIELD. The great majority of magazines differ from all newspapers in one important respect--extent of circulation. Popular magazines have a nation-wide distribution. It is only among agricultural and trade journals that we find a distinctly sectional circulation. Some of these publications serve subscribers in only one state or section, and others issue separate state or sectional editions. The best basis of differentiation among magazines, then, is not the extent of circulation but the class of readers appealed to, regardless of the part of the country in which the readers live. The popular general magazine, monthly or weekly, aims to attract readers of all classes in all parts of the United States.  HOW MAGAZINES GET MATERIAL. Magazine articles come from (1) regular members of the magazine's staff, (2) professional or amateur free-lance writers, (3) specialists who write as an avocation, and (4) readers of the periodical who send in material based on their own experience.  The so-called \"staff system\" of magazine editing, in accordance with which practically all the articles are prepared by writers regularly employed by the publication, has been adopted by a few general magazines and by a number of class periodicals. The staff is recruited from writers and editors on newspapers and other magazines. Its members often perform various editorial duties in addition to writing articles. Publications edited in this way buy few if any articles from outsiders.  Magazines that do not follow the staff system depend largely or entirely on contributors. Every editor daily receives many manuscripts submitted by writers on their own initiative. From these he selects the material best adapted to his publication. Experienced writers often submit an outline of an article to a magazine editor for his approval before preparing the material for publication. Free-lance writers of reputation may be asked by magazine editors to prepare articles on given subjects.  In addition to material obtained in these ways, articles may be secured from specialists who write as an avocation. An editor generally decides on the subject that he thinks will interest his readers at a given time and then selects the authority best fitted to treat it in a popular way. To induce well-known men to prepare such articles, an editor generally offers them more than he normally pays.  A periodical may encourage its readers to send in short articles giving their own experiences and explaining how to do something in which they have become skilled. These personal experience articles have a reality and \"human interest\" that make them eminently readable. To obtain them magazines sometimes offer prizes for the best, reserving the privilege of publishing acceptable articles that do not win an award. Aspiring writers should take advantage of these prize contests as a possible means of getting both publication and money for their work.  OPPORTUNITIES FOR UNKNOWN WRITERS. The belief is common among novices that because they are unknown their work is likely to receive little or no consideration from editors. As a matter of fact, in the majority of newspaper and magazine offices all unsolicited manuscripts are considered strictly on their merits. The unknown writer has as good a chance as anybody of having his manuscript accepted, provided that his work has merit comparable with that of more experienced writers.

From Harrow he had gone to Brazenose; then had quite suddenly thrown up the 'Varsity and returned to Egypt.  Love?  Not at all, for was not his indifference to woman supreme and sincere?  Just the inevitable ending of a very commonplace, sordid little story which had taught the youth one of life's bitterest lessons.  One of a multitude of guests at Hurdley Castle, he had met a woman, beautiful but predatory, whose looks were taking on an autumnal tint, and whose banking account had shrivelled under the frost of extravagance.  His utter indifference to her wiles and her beauty had culminated in a degrading scene of anger on her part, when, forgetting her breeding, her birth and her nationality, she had first of all twitted him and then openly laughed at his mixed parentage.  He had stood without uttering a word, white to the lips during her tirade.  \"Do you think that any white woman would marry you--a _half-caste_?\" had cried the woman, whose bills were coming in in shoals.  \"Yes, many,\" he had quietly answered as he bent to pick up her torn, handkerchief.  \"Am I not a rich man?\"  He had returned to Egypt upon a visit to the Flat Oasis where dwelt his parents, who, though noting the indescribable hurt in the eyes of their firstborn, yet asked no question, for in Egypt a youth is his own master and ofttimes married at the age of fourteen; how much more, therefore, is he a man at over twenty years?  He had visited his own house in the Oasis of Khargegh, with the purpose of putting his stables in order and his falconers through a stiff catechism, and had finally set out to see something of the world.  Not in a desire to cover his hurt, for he was as stoical as any high-bred Arab; and, Mohammedan from belief as well as early training, did not kick against what he looked upon as the commands of Allah.  As for women--well!  The sweet, docile woman of his father's race interested him not at all, so that he refused to listen to any hint anent the desirability of his taking a wife and establishing the succession of the House 'an Mahabbha, which is the eldest branch of the House el-Umbar; and racial distinction barred him from the virile, lovely women of his mother's race.  He had his horses, his hawks, his hunting cheetahs, his dogs; one great treasure which he prized and one little conceit.  The treasure had been found in the ruins of the Temple Deir-el-Bahari. An ornament of gold set with precious stones.  Its shape was that of the Hawk, which had stood as the symbol of the North in the glorious days of Ancient Egypt.  The wings were of emeralds tipped with rubies; gold were the claws and gold the Symbol of Life they held; the body and tail were a mass of precious stones; and the eye of some jet-black stone, unknown to the present century.  As an ornament it was of great value; as an antiquity found in the Shrine of Anubis, the God of Death, its value could not even be guessed at; and how it had come into the possession of Hugh Garden Ali will never be known, though of a truth, unlimited wealth works wonders.  And upon his horses' saddle-cloths, his falcons' hoods, his hounds' coats, and the fine linen and satins of his Eastern raiment he had the emblem worked in thread or silk or jewels, or painted in soft colours.  It was just a pretty conceit, but in conjunction with one-half of his lineage and his love for his birds, it had earned him the title of \"The Hawk of Egypt.\"  And such was the man as he stood in the market-place, having followed the path which Fate had marked out for him through the twisting lanes of the bazaar.     CHAPTER II    \"_Dog, ounce, bear and bull,   Wolf, lion, horse_.\"          DU BARTAS.   Damaris should not have been strolling by herself in the native quarter.  If you are drab or flat of chest or soul or face, you can saunter your fill in any bazaar without adventure befalling you; if, however, nature should have endowed you with the colouring of a desert sunset, if, in short, you _can_ add a splash of colour to anything so colourful as a native bazaar, then 'twere wise to do your sauntering under the wing of a vigilant chaperon, so that the curiosity and interest resultant on your splash may reach you obliquely and \"as through a glass, darkly.\"  But there was no one to worry the girl at this hour before sunset, so that little by little and quite unconsciously she moved forward until she stood outside the doorway.  She stood, outlined against a background of blazing colours, which served in no way to dim her beauty.  Through the yellow-white arch of the doorway showed a stretch of turquoise-blue sky across which, upon a string, swung golden onions and scarlet peppercorns, whilst underneath ruminated a fine, superbly indifferent dromedary.  For a moment Hugh Carden Ali, jogged by Fate, looked straight across at the beautiful picture, staying his talk with Abdul, who, with the courtesy of the East, did not turn his head as he stroked the breast and head of the _shahin_ on his fist.  But Damaris, with envy rampant in her heart, had no eyes for mere man; she wanted to walk across and get near the coal-black stallion from Unayza, a district famous for its breed of large, heavy-built horses. He stood impatiently, with an occasional plunk of a hoof on the sandy stones, or nuzzled his master's sleeve, or pulled at it with his teeth, whilst two shaggy dogs of Billi lay stretched out awaiting the signal to be up and going, perhaps, in a sprint across the desert after the _hosseny_ or red rascal of a fox which had been trapped and caged for the sole purpose of hunting.  Ride out with the caged _hosseny_ on a thoroughbred camel or thoroughbred horse, take with you a couple of greyhounds and a dog or so from Billi, get right off the tourist track and let the red rascal out, and see if you don't have some fun before breakfast.  Only get off the tourist track, else you will have all the bazaar camels and ponies loping along behind you.  The only wild beast this afternoon for sale was a jaguar, black as ink, smooth as satin, short, heavy, with half-closed green eyes fixed steadfastly upon a plump white pigeon foolishly strutting just out of reach of the steel-pointed claws.  \"Take her upon thy fist, O Master,\" said Abdul of Shammar, as he lengthened the jesses, the short, narrow straps of leather or woven silk or cotton with which to hold the hawk.  \"See, she is well reclaimed, being tame and gentle and altogether amiable.  When thrown, she is as a bullet from a rifle, binding her quarry in high air even as a man holds his woman to his heart upon the roof-top under the stars. She is full summed\"--and he ran his slender fingers through the new feathers, full and soft after moulting; \"she is keen as the winter wind--behold the worn and blunted nails; she will not give up, my master, yet will she come to the lure as quickly, as joyfully as a maid to her lover.\"  Hugh Carden Ali, the greatest authority after Abdul on the _shahin_, took the bird upon his fist, looked at the sunken, piercing eyes which were partially seeled; ran his hand over the narrow body, short tail and black back, and a finger over the large beak and deep mouth; held up the ugly face to the light, examined the flight-feathers and, moving his hand quickly up and down, caused the bird to flutter its wings--and so give him a chance of measuring the distance of the wings from the body.  Finding her altogether lovely, he nodded and handed her back to the delighted falconer of Shammar, just as with a decisive pat the jaguar landed, its huge paw upon the strutting pigeon, which had forgotten to keep its distance.  For a moment the attention of the spectators, who were mostly squatting on their heels, was diverted from the master and the falconer.  They laughed, they moved, whilst some in the back row stood up to see the fun, leaving for one second an open space through which Damaris could see the fluttering white bird.  \"Ah!\" she cried, heartbroken at the sight; then, \"Fetch!\" she commanded the dog, pointing across the square.  Now, the dog, who had dispensed with his spiked collar on account of the heat, had no more idea than the man in the moon what he had to fetch for his beloved mistress; but, restless from prolonged inactivity and the smell of strange beasts, he hurled himself in the direction pointed; and his speed, once he got going, was as surprising as that of the elephant or rhinoceros and other clumsy-looking animals, and in very truth, his appearance was just as terrifying.  He crashed head-foremost into the back row of spectators, which, as one man, yelled and fled; tore along the path made clear for him, and sensing an enemy in the growling jaguar, was at its throat like a thrown spear; missing it by an inch as the black beast flung itself back to the full length of the steel chain which fastened it to an iron ring in the ground.  Damaris in her turn rushed, across the square, passing the astounded spectators, who salaamed as she ran.  And as she ran she shouted:  \"Let the animal loose,\" she cried.  \"Give it a chance; let it loose.\"  But Hugh Carden Ali, not in the least understanding the sudden onslaught, but with every sporting instinct uppermost, had already leant down in the seething, growling mass of fur and hate, and loosened the chain; whilst, with screams of fear and delight, the crowd raced for the adjacent houses, from the upper windows of which they could hang in safety to watch the fight.  Disgusting?  Quite so!  But have you ever heard of bull-fighting or pigeon-shooting in civilised, humane Europe?  There followed a frightful scene, during which Abdul, having picked up the pigeon, hastily flung his birds far behind the growling, spitting, raging couple, whilst the stallion, rearing in terror, nearly jerked his master, who had the bridle slipped over his arm, off his"]]]
