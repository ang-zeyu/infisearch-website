Mi heart war once as full o' joy as thine,       But nah it's sad; Aw thowt all th' happiness i'th' world wor mine,       Sich faith aw had;-- But he who promised aw should be his wife Has robb'd me o' mi ivery joy i' life. Sing on: tha cannot cheer me wi' thi song;       Yet, when aw hear Thi warblin' voice, 'at rings soa sweet an' strong,       Aw feel a tear Roll daan mi cheek, 'at gives mi heart relief, A gleam o' comfort, but it's varry brief. This little darlin', cuddled to mi breast,       It little knows, When snoozlin' soa quietly at rest,       'At all mi woes Are smothered thear, an' mi poor heart ud braik But just aw live for mi wee laddie's sake. Sing on; an' if tha e'er should chonce to see       That faithless swain, Whose falsehood has caused all mi misery,       Strike up thy strain, An' if his heart yet answers to thy trill Fly back to me, an' aw will love him still. But if he heeds thee not, then shall aw feel       All hope is o'er, An' he that aw believed an' loved soa weel       Be loved noa more; For that hard heart, bird music cannot move, Is far too cold a dwellin'-place for love.     What aw Want.  Gie me a little humble cot,    A bit o' garden graand, Set in some quiet an' sheltered spot,    Wi' hills an' trees all raand;  An' if besides mi hooam ther flows    A little mumuring rill, At sings sweet music as it gooas,    Awst like it better still.  Gie me a wife 'at loves me weel,    An' childer two or three, Wi' health to sweeten ivery meal,    An' hearts brimful o' glee.  Gie me a chonce, wi' honest toil    Mi efforts to engage, Gie me a maister who can smile    When forkin aght mi wage.  Gie me a friend 'at aw can trust,    'An tell mi secrets to; One tender-hearted, firm an' just,    Who sticks to what is true.  Gie me a pipe to smook at neet,    A pint o' hooam-brew'd ale, A faithful dog 'at runs to meet    Me wi a waggin tail.  A cat to purr o'th' fender rims,    To freeten th' mice away; A cosy bed to rest mi limbs    Throo neet to commin day.  Gie me all this, an' aw shall be    Content, withaat a daat, But if denied, then let me be    Content to live withaat.  For 'tisn't th' wealth one may possess    Can purchase pleasures true; For he's th' best chonce o' happiness,    Whose wants are small an' few.     What it is to be Mother.  A'a, dear! what a life has a mother!    At leeast, if they're hamper'd like me, Thro' mornin' to neet ther's some bother,    An' ther will be, aw guess, wol aw dee.  Ther's mi chap, an misen, an' six childer,    Six o'th' roughest, aw think, under th' sun, Aw'm sartin sometimes they'd bewilder    Old Joab, wol his patience wor done.  They're i' mischief i' ivery corner,    An' ther tongues they seem niver at rest; Ther's one shaatin' \"Little Jack Horner,\"    An' another \"The realms o' the blest.\"  Aw'm sure if a body's to watch 'em,    They mun have een at th' back o' ther yed; For quiet yo niver can catch 'em    Unless they're asleep an' i' bed.  For ther's somdy comes runnin to tell us    'At one on em's takken wi' fits; Or ther's two on 'em feightin for th' bellus,    An' rivin' ther clooas all i' bits.  In a mornin' they're all weshed an' tidy'd,    But bi nooin they're as black as mi shoe; To keep a lot cleean, if yo've tried it,    Yo know 'at ther's summat to do.  When my felly comes hooam to his drinkin',    Aw try to be gradely, an' straight; For when all's nice an' cleean, to mi thinkin',    He enjoys better what ther's to ait.  If aw tell him aw'm varry near finished    Wi allus been kept in a fuss, He says, as he looks up astonished,    \"Why, aw niver see owt 'at tha does.\"  But aw wonder who does all ther mendin',    Weshes th' clooas, an cleans th' winders an' flags? But for me they'd have noa spot to stand in--    They'd be lost i' ther filth an' ther rags.  But it allus wor soa, an' it will be,    A chap thinks' at a woman does nowt; But it ne'er bothers me what they tell me,    For men havn't a morsel o' thowt.  But just harken to me wol aw'm tellin'    Ha aw tew to keep ivery thing straight; An' aw'l have yo for th' judge if yor willin',    For aw want nowt but what aw think's reight.  Ov a Monday aw start o' my weshin',    An' if th' day's fine aw get um all dried; Ov a Tuesday aw fettle mi kitchen,    An' mangle, an' iron beside.  Ov a Wednesday, then aw've mi bakin';    Ov a Thursday aw reckon to brew; Ov a Friday all th' carpets want shakin',    An' aw've th' bedrooms to clean an' dust throo.  Then o'th' Setterday, after mi markets,    Stitch on buttons, an' th' stockins' to mend, Then aw've all th' Sundy clooas to luk ovver,    An' that brings a week's wark to its end.  Then o'th' Sundy ther's cooking 'em th' dinner,    It's ther only warm meal in a wick; Tho' ther's some say aw must be a sinner,    For it's paving mi way to Old Nick.  But a chap mun be like to ha' summat,    An' aw can't think it's varry far wrang, Just to cook him an' th' childer a dinner,    Tho' it may mak me rayther too thrang.  But if yor a wife an' a mother,    Yo've yor wark an' yor duties to mind; Yo mun leearn to tak nowt as a bother,    An' to yor own comforts be blind.  But still, just to seer all ther places,    When they're gethred raand th' harston at neet, Fill'd wi six roosy-red, smilin' faces;    It's nooan a despisable seet.  An, aw connot help thinkin' an' sayin',    (Tho' yo may wonder what aw can mean), 'At if single, aw sooin should be playin'    Coortin tricks, an' be weddin' agean.     What is It.  What is it maks a crusty wife Forget to scold, an' leeave off strife? What is it smoothes the rooad throo life?       It's sooap.  What is it maks a gaumless muff Grow rich, an' roll i' lots o' stuff, Woll better men can't get enough?       It's sooap.  What is it, if it worn't theear, Wod mak some fowk feel varry queer, An' put 'em: i' ther proper sphere?       It's sooap.  What is' it maks fowk wade throo th' snow, To goa to th' church, becoss they know 'At th' squire's at hooam an' sure to goa?       It's sooap.  What is it gains fowk invitations, Throo them 'at live i' lofty stations? What is it wins mooast situations?       It's sooap.  What is it men say they detest, Yet alus like that chap the best 'At gives 'em twice as mich as th' rest?       It's sooap.  What is it, when the devil sends His agents raand to work his ends, What is it gains him lots o' friends?       It's sooap.  What is it we should mooast despise, An' by its help refuse to rise, Tho' poverty's befoor awr eyes?       It's sooap.  What is it, when life's wastin' fast, When all this world's desires are past, Will prove noa use to us at last?       It's sooap.     Come thi Ways!  Bonny lassie, come thi ways,    An' let us goa together! Tho' we've met wi stormy days,    Ther'll be some sunny weather: An' if joy should spring for me,    Tha shall freely share it; An' if trouble comes to thee,    Aw can help to bear it.  Tho thi mammy says us nay,    An' thi dad's unwillin'; Wod ta have me pine away    Wi' this love 'at's killin'? Come thi ways, an' let me twine    Mi arms once moor abaght thee; Weel tha knows mi heart is thine,    Aw couldn't live withaat thee.  Ivery day an' haar 'at slips,    Some pleasure we are missin', For those bonny rooasy lips    Aw'm niver stall'd o' kissin', If men wor wise to walk life's track    Withaat sith joys to glad 'em, He must ha' made a sad mistak    'At gave a Eve to Adam.

Tha'll learn mooar sense, lass, in a while,    For wisdom comes wi' time, An' if tha lives tha'll leearn to smile    At troubles sich as thine; A faithful chap is better far,    Altho' he likes to rooam, Nor one 'at does what isn't reight,    An' sits o'th' hearth at hooam.

Ther's mony a lady, rich an' great,    'At's sarvents at her call, Wod freely change her grand estate    For thine tha thinks soa small: For riches cannot buy content,    Soa tho' thi joys be few, Tha's one ther's nowt con stand anent,--    A heart 'at's kind an' true.  Soa when he comes luk breet an' gay,    An' meet him wi' a kiss, Tha'll find him mooar inclined to stay    Wi treatment sich as this; But if thi een luk red like that,    He'll see all's wrang at once, He'll leet his pipe, an' don his hat,    An' bolt if he's a chonce.

But if we'd anxiously tak    To makkin' things smooth as we're able, Ther'd be monny a better clooath'd back,    An' monny a better spread table.  It's a sad state o' things when a man    Connot put ony faith in his brother, An' fancies he'll chait if he can,    An' rejoice ovver th' fall ov another.  An' it's sad when yo see some 'at stand    High in social position an' power, To know at ther fortuns wor plann'd    An' built, aght o'th' wrecks o' those lower.

He loosened the bark, which came off like a kid glove, and then he cut a place to blow his breath in, and another place to let the air out and so on, until he had a very fine whistle indeed, almost as loud-blowing as those the policemen have to stop the automobiles from splashing mud on you so a trolley car can bump into you.  \"I'll tell you what we'll do,\" said the hump-tail alligator at last. \"Since you won't let me carry him home, and I won't let you, let's both carry him together.  You take hold of him on one side, and I'll take the other.\"  \"Good!\" cried the second alligator.  \"Oh, ho!  I guess not!\" cried the bunny uncle suddenly.  \"I guess you won't either, or both of you take me off to your den.  No, indeed!\"  \"Why not?\" asked the hump-tailed 'gator, sort of impolite like and sarcastic.  \"Because I'm going to blow my whistle and call the police!\" went on the bunny uncle.  \"Toot!  Toot!  Tootity-ti-toot-toot!\"  And then and there he blew such a loud, shrill blast on his willow tree whistle that the alligators had to put their paws over their ears.  And when they did that they had to let go of bunny uncle.  He had his tall silk hat down over his ears, so it didn't matter how loudly he blew the whistle.  He couldn't hear it.  \"Toot!  Toot!  Tootity-toot-toot!\" he blew on the willow whistle.  \"Oh, stop!  Stop!\" cried the hump-tailed 'gator.  \"Come on, run away before the police come!\" said his brother.  And out from under the willow tree they both ran, leaving Uncle Wiggily safely behind.  \"Well,\" said the bunny gentleman as he hopped along home to his bungalow, \"it is a good thing I learned, when a boy rabbit, how to make whistles.\"  And I think so myself.  So if the vinegar jug doesn't jump into the molasses barrel and turn its face sour like a lemon pudding, I'll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and the winter green.     STORY II  UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE WINTERGREEN  Uncle Wiggily Longears, the nice old gentleman rabbit, knocked on the door of the hollow tree in the woods where Johnnie and Billie Bushytail, the two little squirrel boys, lived.  \"Come in!\" invited Mrs. Bushytail.  So Uncle Wiggily went in.  \"I thought I'd come around and see you,\" he said to the squirrel lady. \"I'm living in the woods this Summer and just now I am out taking a walk, as I do every day, and I hoped I might meet with an adventure. But, so far, I haven't.  Do you know where I could find an adventure, Mrs. Bushytail?\"  \"No, I'm sorry to say I don't, Uncle Wiggily,\" answered the squirrel lady.  \"But I wish you could find something to make my little boy Billie feel better.\"  \"Why, is he ill?\" asked the bunny uncle, surprised like, and he looked across the room where Billy Bushytail was curled up in a big rocking chair, with his tail held over his head like an umbrella, though it was not raining.  \"No, Billie isn't ill,\" said Mrs. Bushytail.  \"But he says he doesn't know what to do to have any fun, and I am afraid he is a little peevish.\"  \"Oh, that isn't right,\" said Mr. Longears.  \"Little boys, whether they are squirrels, rabbits or real children, should try to be jolly and happy, and not peevish.\"  \"How can a fellow be happy when there's no fun?\" asked Billie, sort of cross-like.  \"My brother Johnnie got out of school early, and he and the other animal boys have gone off to play where I can't find them.  I had to stay in, because I didn't know my nut-cracking lesson, and now I can't have any fun.  Oh, dear!  I don't care!\"  Billie meant, I suppose, that he didn't care what he said or did, and that isn't right.  But Uncle Wiggily only pinkled his twink nose.  No, wait just a moment if you please.  He just twinkled his pink nose behind the squirrel boy's back, and then the bunny uncle said:  \"How would you like to come for a walk in the woods with me, Billie?\"  \"Oh, that will be nice!\" exclaimed the squirrel lady.  \"Do go, Billie.\"  \"No, I don't want to!\" chattered the boy squirrel, most impolitely.  \"Oh, that isn't at all nice,\" said Mrs. Bushy-tail.  \"At least thank Uncle Wiggily for asking you.\"  \"Oh, excuse me, Uncle Wiggily,\" said Billie, sorrylike.  \"I do thank you.  But I want very much to have some fun, and there's no fun in the woods.  I know all about them.  I know every tree and bush and stump. I want to go to a new place.\"  \"Well, new places are nice,\" said the bunny uncle, \"but old ones are nice, too, if you know where to look for the niceness.  Now come along with me, and we'll see if we can't have some fun.  It is lovely in the woods now.\"  \"I won't have any fun there,\" said Billie, crossly.  \"The woods are no good.  Nothing good to eat grows there.\"  \"Oh, yes there does--lots!\" laughed Uncle Wiggily.  \"Why the nuts you squirrels eat grow in the woods.\"  \"Yes, but there are no nuts now,\" spoke the squirrel boy.  \"They only come in the Fall.\"  \"Well, come, scamper along, anyhow,\" invited Uncle Wiggily.  \"Who knows what may happen?  It may even be an adventure.  Come along, Billie.\"  So, though he did not care much about it, Billie went.  Uncle Wiggily showed the squirrel boy where the early spring flowers were coming up, and how the Jacks, in their pulpits, were getting ready to preach sermons to the trees and bushes.  \"Hark!  What's that?\" asked Billie, suddenly, hearing a noise.  \"What does it sound like?\" asked Uncle Wiggily.  \"Like bells ringing.\"  \"Oh, it's the bluebells--the bluebell flowers,\" answered the bunny uncle.  \"Why do they ring?\" asked the little boy squirrel.  \"To call the little ants and lightning bugs to school,\" spoke Uncle Wiggily, and Billy smiled.  He was beginning to see that there were more things in the woods than he had dreamed of, even if he had scampered here and there among the trees ever since he was a little squirrel chap.  On and on through the woods went the bunny uncle and Billie.  They picked big, leafy ferns to fan themselves with, and then they drank with green leaf-cups from a spring of cool water.  But no sooner had Billie taken the cold water than he suddenly cried:  \"Ouch!  Oh, dear!  Oh, my, how it hurts!\"  \"What is it?\" asked Uncle Wiggily.  \"Did you bite your tongue or step on a thorn?\"  \"It's my tooth,\" chattered Billie.  \"The cold water made it ache again. I need to go to Mr. Stubtail, the bear dentist, who will pull it out with his long claws.  But I've been putting it off, and putting it off, and now--Oh, dear, how it aches!  Wow!\"  \"I'll cure it for you!\" said Uncle Wiggily.  \"Just walk along through the woods with me and I'll soon stop your aching tooth.\"  \"How can you?\" asked Billie, holding his paw to his jaw to warm the aching tooth, for heat will often stop pain.  \"There isn't anything here in the woods to cure toothache; is there?\"  \"I think we shall find something,\" spoke the bunny uncle.  \"Well, I wish we could find it soon!\" cried Billie, \"for my tooth hurts very much.  Ouch!\" and he hopped up and down, for the toothache was of the jumping kind.  \"Ah, ha!  Here we have it!\" cried Uncle Wiggily, as he stooped over some shiny green leaves, growing close to the ground, and he pulled some of them up.  \"Just chew these leaves a little and let them rest inside your mouth near the aching tooth,\" said Mr. Longears.  \"I think they will help you, Billie.\"  So Billie chewed the green leaves.  They smarted and burned a little, but when he put them near his tooth they made it nice and warm and soon the ache all stopped.  \"What was that you gave me, Uncle Wiggily?\" Billie asked.  \"Wintergreen,\" answered Uncle Wiggily.  \"It grows in the woods, and is good for flavoring candy, as well as for stopping toothache.\"  \"I am glad to know that,\" said Billie.  \"The woods are a nicer place than I thought, and there is ever so much more in them than I dreamed. Thank you, Uncle Wiggily.\"  So, as his toothache was all better, Billie had good fun in the woods with the bunny uncle, until it was time to go home.  And in the next story, if the top doesn't fly off the coffee pot and let the baked potato hide away from the egg-beater, when they play tag, I'll tell you about Uncle Wiggily and the slippery elm.     STORY III  UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE SLIPPERY ELM  \"Where are you going, Uncle Wiggily?\" asked Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, the muskrat lady housekeeper, as she saw the rabbit gentleman standing on the front steps of his hollow stump bungalow in the woods one morning. \"Where are you going?\"  \"Oh, just for a walk through the forest,\" spoke the bunny uncle.  \"It is so nice in the woods, with the flowers coming up, and the leaves getting larger and greener every day, that I just love to walk there.\"  \"Well,\" said Nurse Jane with a laugh, \"if you happen to see a bread-tree in the woods, bring home a loaf for supper.\"  \"I will,\" promised Uncle Wiggily.  \"You know, Nurse Jane, there really are trees on which bread fruit grows, though not in this country.  But I can get you a loaf of bread at the five and ten cent store, I dare say.\"  \"Do, please,\" asked the muskrat lady.  \"And if you see a cocoanut tree you might bring home a cocoanut cake for supper.\"  \"Oh, my!\" laughed the rabbit gentleman.  \"I'm afraid there are no cocoanut trees in my woods.  I could bring you home a hickory nut cake, perhaps.\"  \"Well, whatever you like,\" spoke Nurse Jane.  \"But don't get lost, whatever you do, and if you meet with an adventure I hope it will be a nice one.\"  \"So do I,\" Uncle Wiggily said, as he hopped off, leaning on his red, white and blue stripped [Transcriber's note: striped?] rheumatism crutch which Nurse Jane had gnawed for him out of a cornstalk.  The old rabbit gentleman had not gone very far before he met Dr. Possum walking along in the woods, with his satchel of medicine on his tail, for Dr. Possum cured all the ill animals, you know.  \"What in the world are you doing, Dr. Possum?\" asked Uncle Wiggily, as he saw the animal doctor pulling some bark off a tree.  \"Are you going to make a canoe, as the Indians used to do?\"  \"Oh, no,\" answered Dr.  Possum.  \"This is a "]]]
