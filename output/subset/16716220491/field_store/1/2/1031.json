Jack he laid fo' 'em wid a shotgun, but he didn't cotch nobody.\"  \"I'll catch them yet, see if I don't,\" said the hired man.  \"Perhaps a fox is doing it,\" suggested Sam. \"If so, we ought to go on a fox hunt. That would suit me first rate.\"  \"No fox in this,\" answered Jack Ness. \"I see the footprints of two men,--tramps, I reckon. If I catch sight of 'em I'll fill 'em full of shot and then have 'em locked up.\"     CHAPTER III  FUN ON THE FARM   Two days passed and the boys felt once more at home on the farm. The strain of the recent examinations and the closing exercises at school had gone and as Sam declared, \"they were once more themselves,\" and ready for anything that might turn up.  In those two days came another telegram from Mr. Rover, sent from Philadelphia, in which he stated that he had caught his man, but had lost him again. He added that he would be home probably on the following Sunday. This message came in on Monday, so the boys knew they would have to wait nearly a week before seeing their parent.  \"I am just dying to know what it is all about,\" said Tom, and the others said practically the same.  Tom could not keep down his propensities for joking and nearly drove Sarah, the cook, to distraction by putting some barn mice in the bread box in the pantry and by pouring ink over some small stones and then adding them to the coal she was using in the kitchen range. He also took a piece of old rubber bicycle tire and trimmed it up to resemble a snake and put it in Jack Ness' bed in the barn, thereby nearly scaring the hired man into a fit. Ness ran out of the room in his night dress and raised such a yell that he aroused everybody in the house. He got his shotgun and blazed away at the supposed snake, thereby ruining a blanket, two sheets, and filling the mattress with shot. When he found out how he had been hoaxed he was the most foolish looking man to be imagined.  \"You just wait, Master Tom, I'll get square,\" he said.  \"Who said I put a snake in your bed?\" demanded Tom. \"I never did such a thing in my life.\"  \"No, but you put that old rubber in, and I know it,\" grumbled the hired man and then went back to bed.  Tom also had his little joke on Aleck Pop. One evening he saw the colored man dressing up to go out and learned that he was going to call on a colored widow living at Dexter's Corners, a nearby village.  \"We can't allow this,\" said the fun-loving Rover to his younger brother. \"The next thing you know Aleck will be getting married and leaving us.\"  \"What do you think of doing?\" asked Sam.  \"Come on, and I'll show you.\"  Now, Aleck was rather a good looking and well formed darkey and he was proud of his shape. He had a fine black coat, with trousers to match, and a gorgeous colored vest. This suit Tom was certain he would wear when calling on the widow.  When in Ithaca on his way home the fun-loving Rover had purchased an imitation rabbit, made of thin rubber. This rabbit had a small rubber hose attached, and by blowing into the hose the rabbit could be blown up to life size or larger.  Leading the way to Aleck's room, Tom got out the colored man's coat and placed the rubber rabbit in the middle of the back, between the cloth and the lining. It was put in flat and the hose was allowed to dangle down under the lining to within an inch of the split of the coat tails, and at this point Tom put a hole in the lining, so he could get at the end of the hose with ease.  It was not long before Aleck came in to dress. It was late and he was in a hurry, for he knew he had a rival, a man named Jim Johnson, and he did not want Johnson to get to the widow's home ahead of him. He washed up and donned his clothing with rapidity, and never noticed that anything was wrong with the coat.  \"Now, Sam, you fix his necktie for him,\" whispered Tom, who, with his younger brother, was lying in wait outside the house. \"Tell him it doesn't set just straight.\"  Sam understood, and as soon as Aleck appeared he sauntered up side by side with Tom.  \"Hullo, Aleck, going to see your best girl?\" he said pleasantly.  \"I'se gwine to make a little call, dat's all.\"  \"He's after the widow Taylor,\" put in Tom. \"He knows she's got ten thousand or so in the bank.\"  \"Massa Tom, you dun quit yo' foolin',\" expostulated Aleck.  \"If you are going to make a society call you want your necktie on straight,\" said Sam. \"It's a fine tie, but it's no good the way you have it tied. Here, let me fix it,\" and he pulled the tie loose.  \"I did hab a lot ob trubble wid dat tie,\" agreed the colored man.  \"It's too far around,\" went on Sam, and gave the tie a jerk, first one way and another. Then he began to tie it, shoving Aleck again as he did so.  In the meantime Tom had gotten behind the colored man and was blowing up the rubber rabbit. As the rubber expanded Aleck's coat went up with it, until it looked as if the man was humpbacked. Then Tom fastened the hose, so the wind could not get out of it. Next the youth brought out a bit of chalk and in big letters wrote on the black coat as follows:  I have got to HUMP to catch the widow.  \"Now your tie is something like,\" declared Sam, after a wink from Tom. \"It outshines everything I ever saw.\"  \"I'se got to be a going,\" answered Aleck. \"Much obliged.\"  \"Now, Aleck, hump yourself and you'll get the widow sure along with her fourteen children.\"  \"She ain't got but two children,\" returned the colored man, and hurried away. His appearance, with the hump on his back and the sign, caused both the Rovers to burst out laughing.  \"Come on, I've got to see the end of this,\" said Tom, and led the way by a side path to the Widow Taylor's cottage. This was a short cut, but Aleck would not take it, because of the briar bushes and the dust. As the boys were in their knockaround suits they did not mind this.  The widow's cottage was a tumbled down affair on a side street of Dexter's Corners. A stovepipe stuck out of a back window, and the front door lacked the lower hinge. In the front yard the weeds were several feet high.  \"I don't see why Aleck wants to come and see such a person as this,\" observed Sam. \"She may be pretty, as colored widows go, but she is certainly lazy and shiftless.\"  \"Yes, and she has more than two children and I know it. Why, once I came past here and I saw her with at least seven or eight.\"  When the boys came up they saw several colored children hurrying away from the house. As they did this the widow came to the door and called after them:  \"Now, Arabella, go to the cemetery, jest as I tole yo', an' stay thar!\"  \"I ain't gwine to stay long,\" answered Arabella.  \"You stay an hour or two,\" answered the widow. \"To morrow, I'll give yo' money fer lolly pops.\"  \"What is she sending the children to the cemetery for?\" asked Tom, in a whisper.  \"Maybe to keep 'em quiet,\" answered Sam, with a grin.  \"Must be wanting to keep them out of Aleck's way.\"  At that moment the figure of a tall, lanky colored man came down a side street. The man entered the widow's cottage and received a warm welcome.  \"Glad to see you, Mistah Thomas. Hopes yo' is feelin' fine this ebenin',\" said the widow graciously.  \"I'se come fo' to make yo' an offah,\" said Mr. Thomas. \"Yo' said yo' would mahrry me soon as I had a job. Well, I'se got de job now.\"  \"Is it a steady job?\"  \"Yes, at de stone quarry dribin' a stone wagon.\"  \"How much yo' gits a week, Peter?\"  \"Twelve dollahs,\" was the proud answer.  \"Den I closes wid you,\" said the widow, and allowed the suitor to embrace her.  Just then Aleck came in sight. As he saw the couple through the open door he straightened up.  \"Maybe yo' didn't look fo' me around, Mrs. Taylor,\" he said, stiffly.  \"Oh, Yes, I did, Mistah Pop,\" she said, sweetly. \"But yo' see--I-- dat is--\" She stopped short. \"Wot's dat?\" she cried.  \"Wot?\"  \"Dat hump on yo' back?\"  \"Ain't no hump on my back,\" answered Aleck.  \"Suah da is.\"  \"He's got a sign on, too,\" put in Peter Thomas. \"Look wot it reads, 'I hab got to hump to cotch de widow.' Hah! hah! hah! Dot's a good one.\"  \"Yo' needn't hump yo'self to cotch me,\" cried the widow, wrathfully. \"I'se engaged to Mistah Thomas.\" And she smiled on the individual in question.  Crestfallen and bewildered, Aleck felt of his back and took off his coat. He squeezed the rubber rabbit so hard that it exploded with a bang, scaring himself and the others.  \"Dat's a trick on me!\" roared the Rover's man, and tore the rabbit from his coat. \"Dem boys did dat!\"  \"I can't see yo' to night, or any udder night, Mistah Pop,\" said the widow. \"I'se engaged to Mistah Thomas.\"  \"Den good night,\" growled Aleck, and turning on his heel he started for home.  Tom and Sam saw that he was angry, yet they had to roar at the scene presented. They wondered what Aleck would say when he got back to the farm.  \"We have got to square ourselves,\" said Tom.  \"How are you going to do it?\"  \"Oh, we'll do it somehow.\"  They took the short cut, but so did Aleck, and consequently all three soon met.  \"Yo' played dat joke yo' can't go fo' to deny it!\" cried the colored man.  \"We are not going to deny it, Aleck,\" said Tom. \"But it was no joke. We did it for your good.\"  \"Huh!\"  \"We certainly did,\" put in Sam. \"Why, Aleck, we can't bear to think of your getting married and leaving us.\"  \"Huh!\"  \"We want you to stay with us,\" said Tom. \"Besides, that widow has a lot of children and is after your money.\"  \"She ain't got but two chillen. She had moah, but she dun told me all but two was in de seminary.\"  \"The seminary?\" queried Tom. Then a light broke in on him. \"You mean the cemetery.\"  \"Persackly--de place da puts de dead folks.\"  \"Well, they are in the cemetery right enough--but they are a long way from being dead.\"  \"Wot yo' mean, Tom?\"  \"We saw her send five of them away this evening--she told 'em to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15727"],["title","Gritli's Children (#1)"],["body","with her old friend, she began anxiously to question the suitableness of talking to the child upon such topics.  \"Surely there is no need of dwelling on such mournful things, Clarissa. Nora is not so ill that we need think the worst, much less talk about it.\"  \"Nora likes to hear me repeat her favorite poem,\" replied Clarissa; \"and, dear Mrs. Stanhope, let me say one thing to you. If our darling is to live only to suffer through long years of pain, can you wish for life for her? Why should we wish to keep her here, where she cannot enjoy the smallest part of the wealth and beauty about her, rather than let her go to that heavenly home, where there is no more sorrow nor pain?\"  \"I cannot bear the thought of parting from her; it must not, it cannot be. Why may not all yet go well, and Nora get strong again?\" said the poor mother; and the heart within her was heavy with grief. She could say no more, and withdrew in silence to her own room.  The great stone mansion was soon wrapped in stillness; and as the light of the summer moon shone down upon it, whoever had seen it standing there in stately beauty, its high white pillars gleaming through the dark trees, would surely have thought:  \"How beautiful it must be to live there! No care nor sorrow can reach the inmates of that lovely dwelling!\"  Mrs. Stanhope occupied her paternal home on the banks of the Rhine. She had married an English-man when very young, and had lived in England until his death, when she returned to the home of her childhood, unoccupied since the death of her parents, bringing with her two little children, the brown-eyed Philo, and his delicate, fair-haired sister, Nora. The faithful Clarissa, who had taken care of Mrs. Stanhope in her childhood and who had accompanied her to her foreign home, loved these children as if they were her own. The little family had now lived several years in this beautiful house on the Rhine; a very peaceful and regular life it was, one day like another; for the children were delicate and could bear no exciting pleasures. Two years ago a heavy sorrow dropped its dark shadow over the household. Little Philo closed his dark eyes forever, and was laid to rest under the old linden-tree in the garden, where the roses bloomed all summer long. Nora, who was only a year younger than her brother, was now in her eleventh year.  In about a week after his first visit, the doctor came again. He had heard from his friend, the physician, who had willingly offered to find a house for Mrs. Stanhope near his own, in the little village of Buchberg, among the mountains. Mrs. Stanhope might set out as soon as she pleased. He would answer for all being in readiness to receive her.  In a few days they were ready to start. Clarissa was to remain behind to put the house in order, and only a young maid-servant went with them. As the carriage rolled away, bearing Mrs. Stanhope and her little daughter on the way to Switzerland, Clarissa gave them many a God-speed, and, turning back into the empty house, she wiped away the tears she could no longer repress, saying softly to herself:      \"'Their rapture gathers more and more;       The sick are well again.'\"     CHAPTER II.  IN THE DOCTOR'S HOUSE AT BUCHBERG.   The kitchen-garden is the especial delight of the true German housewife; that is, of one who lives in the country where such a luxury is possible. The flower-garden is a source of pleasure to the whole family; but the vegetable-garden is her own, so to speak; she cares for it herself; she watches each little plant with her own eyes, and removes each encroaching weed with her own hands. Now this year the cauliflowers were of unusually fine promise, and they excited the hopes of their owner that a wonderful harvest would before long reward her care; not a trace of a noxious worm was as yet to be detected.  \"Good evening,\" said some one from the other side of the hedge; \"your vegetables are always the best and the most forward of any in the neighborhood; they show the care you take of them.\"  The doctor's wife came nearer to the hedge, and over the low barrier Heiri, the day-laborer, stretched his hand, stained and knotted with work, to clasp that of his old friend and schoolmate. How often had he been to her for counsel and aid since those school-days, and when had that willing and helpful hand ever failed him?  \"How are you all at home, Heiri?\" she asked heartily. \"Have you plenty of work? Are your wife and children well?\"  \"Yes, yes, thank God!\" replied Heiri, as he lifted his heavy tools from his shoulder and set them on the ground. \"There is work enough; I am just taking these tools to be sharpened. I have to keep hard at it, for the family is growing big.\"  \"The three little boys look finely; I saw them go by yesterday with Elsli,\" continued the doctor's wife. \"But Elsli herself looks quite too pale and delicate. Do not forget how her mother died, Heiri. The little girl ought not to have too much to do; she is not strong, and she is growing too fast. Do take it in time, Heiri; you know by sad experience how rapidly disease gains ground when it has once got hold of a young girl.\"  \"Yes, yes, I can never forget that. It was terrible to see how quickly Gritli sank,--and she so young, so young! Marget is a good wife and an industrious woman; but nothing will ever make me forget my poor Gritli\"; and Heiri wiped away a few tears with his hard hand.  Tears were also in the eyes of the doctor's wife, as she said, \"Neither can I ever forget her, nor how gladly she would have lived for you and the children, nor how quickly it was all over. Elsli is the very image of her mother, Heiri, and I cannot help fearing that she is working beyond her strength.\"  \"She's a poor, thin little creature, to be sure,\" said Heiri; \"and it strikes me, now and then, that she is delicate; but usually she is so quiet that I don't take much notice of her. Now, the boy is much more like his mother; he's always busy about something, especially about keeping things clean. He can't abide dirt, any more than Gritli could, and he is always at the little ones to make them come and be washed at the spout. Of course the little boys won't stand that, and they set up a scream, and then out comes their mother, and there's a grand row! I scarcely ever come home at night that Marget doesn't come complaining of the boy for plaguing the younger children. She wants me to punish him, but when the little fellow stands up before me, and looks straight into my eyes with such a look of his mother about him, I cannot bring myself to strike him. Then Marget is vexed and begins to scold, and I do not like to vex her, for she works hard and means all right. I have often thought that perhaps you, Mrs. Stein, would speak a word for me to Marget about punishing the boy; for anything from you would have great weight with her.\"  \"Certainly I will, with pleasure. But tell me about Elsli; is Marget kind to her?\"  \"Well, this is how it is,\"--and Heiri drew a little nearer the hedge and spoke in a confidential tone--\"the little girl is more like me, and gives in easily and is not obstinate about having her own way, as her poor mother was. She does what she is bid, and never answers back when Marget scolds, nor ever complains, though she has to work from the time she gets home from school till she goes to bed; always carrying the baby, or doing something about the house.\"  \"But you must not let her do too much, Heiri,\" said Mrs. Stein seriously. \"I am very anxious about her. Ask Marget to come over and see me: tell her I have some clothes which my children have out-grown, and I should like to give them to her if she will come for them.\"  \"Thank you; I will certainly send her. Good-night I hope you will have good luck with the cauliflowers\"; and, with another shake of his good friend's hand, Heiri went off to the smithy.  The doctor's wife stood lost in thought for several minutes. She was looking towards her vegetables, but she was thinking of neither beet nor cauliflower, though her eyes were resting on the neat rows before her. This talk with Heiri had brought the old days of her childhood forcibly back to her memory. She saw the pretty Gritli with her big brown eyes, as she used to sit weaving forget-me-nots into pretty wreaths with her skilful fingers; always putting a few into her belt and into her hair. Gritli was the child of poor parents, but she was always neatly dressed, and, though her clothes were of the coarsest stuff, yet there was a peculiar look of daintiness about her, which, with the bit of color in flower or ribbon that was never wanting in her costume, gave the impression that she had just been dressed by an artist, as a model for a picture. Many criticised this daintiness and many laughed at it, but it made no difference to Gritli; for indeed it was only the instinctive expression of the girl's natural longing for the beautiful.  At eighteen, Gritli married Heiri, a good-hearted fellow who had long loved her. But after five years of married life she died, of a rapid consumption; leaving two children, Stefan and Elsli, four and three years old. It was not long before Heiri found that he needed help in the care of these little ones, and, taking the advice of friends and neighbors, he married Marget, who was recommended to him as specially capable of looking after his house and children. She proved indeed a good house-keeper; but for ornaments and flowers she had no taste, and she did not see the use of being over particular about neatness either, so that Heiri's household soon lost the air of refinement which had been noticeable during Gritli's life.  Marget's three children did not get by any means the nice care that Fani and Elsli had received from their own mother, and Gritli's children retained an air of distinction that was ineffaceable, and that marked them as quite different from the younger set.  The memories that passed almost like a vision before the eyes of the"]]]
