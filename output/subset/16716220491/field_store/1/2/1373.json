Vol. 4.]  [Footnote 10: As early as 1797 Hölderlin's Hyperion laments: \"Mein Geschäft auf Erden ist aus. Ich bin voll Willens an die Arbeit gegangen, habe geblutet darüber, und die Welt um keinen Pfennig reicher gemacht.\" (\"Hölderlin's gesammelte Dichtungen, herausgegeben von B. Litzmann,\" Stuttgart, Cotta, undated. Vol. II, p. 68.) Several decades later Heine writes: \"Ich kann mich über die Siege meiner liebsten Ueberzeugungen nicht recht freuen, da sie mir gar zu viel gekostet haben. Dasselbe mag bei manchem ehrlichen Manne der Fall sein, und es trägt viel bei zu der grossen düsteren Verstimmung der Gegenwart.\" (Brief vom 21 April, 1851, an Gustav Kolb; Werke, Karpeles ed. Vol. IX, p. 378.)]  [Footnote 11: \"Confession d'un enfant du siècle.\" Oeuvres compl. Paris, 1888 (Charpentier). Vol. VIII, p. 24.]     CHAPTER II  =Hölderlin=   A case such as that of Hölderlin, subject as he was from the time of his boyhood to melancholy, and ending in hopeless insanity, at once suggests the question of heredity. Little or nothing is known concerning his remote ancestors. His great-grandfather had been administrator of a convent at Grossbottwar, and died of dropsy of the chest at the age of forty-seven. His grandfather had held a similar position as \"Klosterhofmeister und geistlicher Verwalter\" at Lauffen, to which his son, the poet's father, succeeded. An apoplectic stroke ended his life at the early age of thirty-six. In regard to Hölderlin's maternal ancestors, our information is even more scant, though we know that both his grandmother and his mother lived to a ripe old age. From the poet's references to them we judge them to have been entirely normal types of intelligent, lovable women, gifted with a great deal of good practical sense. The only striking thing is the premature death of Hölderlin's great-grandfather and father. But in view of the nature of their stations in life, in which they may fairly be supposed to have led more than ordinarily sober and well-ordered lives, there seems to be no ground whatever for assuming that Hölderlin's Weltschmerz owed its inception in any degree to hereditary tendencies, notwithstanding Hermann Fischer's opinion to the contrary.[12] There is no sufficient reason to assume \"erbliche Belastung,\" and there are other sufficient causes without merely guessing at such a possibility.  But while there are no sufficient historical grounds for the supposition that he brought the germ of his subsequent mental disease with him in his birth, we cannot fail to observe, even in the child, certain natural traits, which, being allowed to develop unchecked, must of necessity hasten and intensify the gloom which hung over his life. To his deep thoughtfulness was added an abnormal sensitiveness to all external influences. Like the delicate anemone, he recoiled and withdrew within himself when touched by the rougher material things of life.[13] He himself poetically describes his absentmindedness when a boy, and calls himself \"ein Träumer\"; and a dreamer he remained all his life. It seems to have been this which first brought him into discord with the world:      Oft sollt' ich stracks in meine Schule wandern,     Doch ehe sich der Träumer es versah,     So hatt' er in den Garten sich verirrt,     Und sass behaglich unter den Oliven,     Und baute Flotten, schifft' ins hohe Meer.       *       *       *       *       *      Dies kostete mich tausend kleine Leiden,     Verzeihlich war es immer, wenn mich oft     Die Klügeren, mit herzlichem Gelächter     Aus meiner seligen Ekstase schreckten,     Doch unaussprechlich wehe that es mir.[14]  If ever a boy needed a strong fatherly hand to guide him, to teach him self-reliance and practical sense, it was this dreamy, tender-spirited child.[15] The love and sympathy which his mother bestowed upon him was not calculated to fit him for the rugged experiences of life, and while probably natural and pardonable, it was nevertheless extremely unfortunate that the boy was unconsciously encouraged to be and to remain a \"Muttersöhnchen.\" But even with his peculiar trend of disposition, the result might not have been an unhappy one, had the course of his life not brought him more than an ordinary share of misfortune. This overtook him early in life, for when but two years of age his father died. His widowed mother now lived for a few years in complete retirement with her two children--the poet's sister Henrietta having been born just a few weeks after his father's demise. But it was not long before death again entered the household and robbed it of Hölderlin's aunt, his deceased father's sister, who was herself a widow and the faithful companion of the poet's mother. When the latter found herself again alone with her two little ones, whose care was weighing heavily upon her, she consented to become the wife of her late husband's friend, Kammerrat Gock, and accompanied him to his home in the little town of Nürtingen on the Neckar. But this re-established marital happiness was to be of brief duration, for in 1779 her second husband died, and the mother was now left with four little children to care and provide for.  The frequency with which death visited the family during his childhood and youth, familiarized him at an early age with scenes of sorrow and grief. No doubt he was too young when his father died to comprehend the calamity that had come upon the household, but it was not many months before he knew the meaning of his mother's tears, not only for his father, but also for his sister, who died in her infancy. Referring to his father's death, he writes in one of his early poems, \"Einst und Jetzt\":[16]      Einst schlugst du mir so ruhig, empörtes Herz!       *       *       *       *       *      Einst in des Vaters Schoosse, des liebenden     Geliebten Vaters,--aber der Würger kam,     Wir weinten, flehten, doch der Würger     Schnellte den Pfeil, und es sank die Stütze.  At his tenderest and most impressionable age, the boy was thus made sadly aware of the fleetingness of human life and the pains of bereavement. We cannot wonder then at finding these impressions reflected in his most juvenile poetic attempts. His poem \"Das menschliche Leben,\" written at the age of fifteen, begins:      Menschen, Menschen! was ist euer Leben,     Eure Welt, die thränenvolle Welt!     Dieser Schauplatz, kann er Freude geben     Wo sich Trauern nicht dazu gesellt?[17]  But a time of still greater unhappiness was in store for him when he left his home at the age of fourteen to enter the convent school at Denkendorf, where he began his preparation for a theological course. A more direct antithesis to all that his body and soul yearned for and needed for their proper development could scarcely have been devised than that which existed in the chilling atmosphere and rigorous discipline of the monastery. He had not even an incentive to endure hardships for the sake of what lay beyond, for it was merely in passive submission to his mother's wish that he had decided to enter holy orders. And now, clad in a sombre monkish gown, deprived of all freedom of thought or movement and forced into companionship with twenty-five or thirty fellows of his own age, who nearly all misunderstood him, Hölderlin felt himself wretched indeed. \"Wär' ich doch ewig ferne von diesen Mauern des Elends!\" he writes in a poem at Maulbronn in 1787.[18] There was for him but one way of escape. It was to isolate himself as much as possible from the world of harsh reality about him, to be alone, and there in his solitude to construct for himself an ideal world of fancy, a poetic dreamland. This mental habit not only remained with him as he grew into manhood, it may be said to have been through life one of his most distinguishing characteristics. It would be impossible to make room here for all the passages in his poems and letters of this period, which reflect his love of solitude and his habit of retreating into a world of his own imagining. His letters to his friend Nast almost invariably contain some expression of his heart-ache. \"Bilfinger ist wohl mein Freund, aber es geht ihm zu glücklich, als dass er sich nach mir umsehen möchte. Du wirst mich schon verstehen--er ist immer lustig, ich hänge immer den Kopf.\"[19] Another letter begins: \"Wieder eine Stunde wegphantasiert!--dass es doch so schlechte Menschen giebt, unter meinen Cameraden so elende Kerls--wann mich die Freundschaft nicht zuweilen wieder gut machte, so hätt' ich mich manchmal schon lieber an jeden andern Ort gewünscht, als unter Menschengesellschaft.--Wann ich nur auch einmal etwas recht Lustiges schreiben könnte! Nur Gedult! 's wird kommen--hoff' ich, oder--oder hab' ich dann nicht genug getragen? Erfuhr ich nicht schon als Bube, was den Mann seufzen machen würde? und als Jüngling, geht's da besser?--Du lieber Gott! bin ich's denn allein? jeder andre glücklicher als ich? Und was hab' ich dann gethan?\"[20] There is a world of pathos in this helpless cry of pain, with its suggestion of retributive fate. A poem of 1788, \"Die Stille,\" written at Maulbronn, epitomizes almost everything that we have thus far noted as to Hölderlin's nature. He goes back in fancy to the days of his childhood, describing his lonely rambles, from which he would return in the moonlight, unmindful of his lateness for the evening meal, at which he would hastily eat of that which the others had left:      Schlich mich, wenn ich satt gegessen,     Weg von meinem lustigen Geschwisterpaar.      O! in meines kleinen Stübchens Stille     War mir dann so über alles wohl,     Wie im Tempel war mir's in der Nächte Hülle,     Wann so einsam von dem Turm die Glocke scholl.      Als ich weggerissen von den Meinen     Aus dem lieben elterlichen Haus     Unter Fremden irrte, we ich nimmer weinen     Durfte, in das bunte Weltgewirr hinaus,      O wie pflegtest du den armen Jungen,     Teure, so mit"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17370"],["title","Prehistoric Textile Fabrics Of The United States, Derived From Impressions On (#1)"],["body","uction. I have observed, in relation to this point, that in a number of cases, notably the great salt vessels of Saline River, Illinois, the fabric has been applied after the vessel was finished. I arrive at this conclusion from having noticed that the loose threads of the net-like cover sag or festoon toward the rim as if applied to the inverted vessel, Fig. 82. If the net had been used to suspend the vessel while building, the threads would necessarily have hung in the opposite direction.  In support of the idea that ornament was a leading consideration in the employment of these coarse fabrics, we have the well-known fact that simple cord-markings, arranged to form patterns, have been employed by many peoples for embellishment alone. This was a common practice of the ancient inhabitants of Great Britain, as shown by Jewett. The accompanying cut (Fig. 60) is copied from his work.[1]    [Illustration: Fig. 60.--Ancient British vase with cord   ornamentation.]      [Footnote 1: Jewett, Llewellynn: Grave mounds and their contents,     p. 92.]  It is a remarkable fact that very few entire cord-marked vessels have been obtained in this country, although fragments of such are very plentiful.  In Fig. 61 we have an ancient vase from Pennsylvania. It presents a combination of net or basket markings and of separate cord-markings. The regularity of the impressions upon the globular body indicates almost unbroken contact with the interior surface of the woven vessel. The neck and rim have apparently received finishing touches by separately impressing cords or narrow bands of some woven fabric.    [Illustration: Fig. 61.--Ancient fabric marked vessel, Pennsylvania.]  Many examples show very irregular markings such as might have been made by rolling the plastic vessel irregularly upon a woven surface, or by molding it in an improvised sack made by tying up the margins of a piece of cloth.  It is necessary to distinguish carefully the cord and fabric markings from the stamped designs so common in southern pottery, as well as from the incised designs, some of which imitate fabric markings very closely.  I shall present at once a selection from the numerous examples of the fabrics restored. For convenience of study I have arranged them in six groups, some miscellaneous examples being added in a seventh group. For comparison, a number of illustrations of both ancient and modern textiles are presented.  In regard to methods of manufacture but little need be said. The appliances used have been extremely simple, the work in a vast majority of cases having been done by hand. It is probable that in many instances a simple frame has been used, the threads of the web or warp being fixed at one end and those of the woof being carried through them by the fingers or by a simple needle or shuttle. A loom with a device for carrying the alternate threads of the warp back and forth may have been used, but that form of fabric in which the threads are twisted in pairs at each crossing of the woof could only have been made by hand.  The probable methods will be dwelt upon more in detail as the groups are presented. In verifying the various methods of fabrication I have been greatly assisted by Miss Kate C. Osgood, who has successfully reproduced, in cotton cord, all the varieties discovered, all the mechanism necessary being a number of pins set in a drawing board or frame, in the form of three sides of a rectangle, the warp being fixed at one end only and the woof passing back and forth between the lateral rows of pins, as shown in Fig. 74.                     FIRST GROUP.  Fig. 62 illustrates a small fragment of an ordinary coffee sack which I take as a type of the first group. It is a loosely woven fabric of the simplest construction; the two sets of threads being interwoven at right angles to each other, alternate threads of one series passing over and under each of the opposing series as shown in the section, Fig. 63.    [Illustration: Fig. 62.--Type of Group one--portion of a coffee   sack.]    [Illustration: Fig. 63.--Section.]  It is a remarkable fact that loosely woven examples of this kind of cloth are rarely, if ever, found among the impressions upon clay or in the fabrics themselves where preserved by the salts of copper or by charring. The reason of this probably is that the combination is such that when loosely woven the threads would not remain in place under tension, and the twisted and knotted varieties were consequently preferred.  It is possible that many of the very irregular impressions observed, in which it is so difficult to trace the combinations of the threads, are of distorted fabrics of this class.  This stuff may be woven by hand in a simple frame, or by any of the primitive forms of the loom.  In most cases, so far as the impressions upon pottery show, when this particular combination is employed, the warp is generally very heavy and the woof comparatively light. This gives a cloth differing greatly from the type in appearance; and when, as is usually the case, the woof threads are beaten down tightly, obscuring those of the web, the resemblance to the type is quite lost.  Examples of this kind of weaving may be obtained from the fictile remains of nearly all the Atlantic States.  The specimen presented in Fig. 64 was obtained from a small fragment of ancient pottery from the State of New York.    [Illustration: Fig. 64.--Fabric impressed upon ancient pottery, New   York.]  It is generally quite difficult to determine which set of threads is the warp and which the woof. In most cases I have preferred to call the more closely placed threads the woof, as they are readily beaten down by a baton, whereas it would be difficult to manipulate the warp threads if so closely placed. In the specimen illustrated, only the tightly woven threads of the woof appear. The impression is not sufficiently distinct to show the exact character of the thread, but there are indications that it has been twisted. The regularity and prominence of the ridges indicate a strong, tightly drawn warp.  Fig. 65 represents a form of this type of fabric very common in impressions upon the pottery of the Middle Atlantic States. This specimen was obtained from a small potsherd picked up near Washington, D.C. The woof or cross-threads are small and uniform in thickness, and pass alternately over and under the somewhat rigid fillets of the web. The apparent rigidity of these fillets may result from the tightening of the series when the fabric was applied to the plastic surface of the vessel.    [Illustration: Fig. 65.--From a fragment of ancient pottery,   District of Columbia.]  I present in Fig. 66 the only example of the impression of a woven fabric found by the writer in two summers' work among the remains of the ancient Cliff-Dwellers. It was obtained from the banks of the San Juan River, in southeastern Utah. It is probably the imprint of the interior surface of a more or less rigid basket, such as are to be seen among many of the modern tribes of the Southwest. The character of the warp cannot be determined, as the woof, which has been of moderately heavy rushes or other untwisted, vegetable fillets, entirely hides it.    [Illustration: Fig. 66.--From a fragment of ancient Cliff-house   pottery.]  The caves of Kentucky have furnished specimens of ancient weaving of much interest. One of these, a small fragment of a mat apparently made from the fiber of bark, or a fibrous rush, is illustrated in Fig. 67.    [Illustration: Fig. 67.--Fabric from a cave in Kentucky.]  This simple combination of the web and woof has been employed by all ancient weavers who have left us examples of their work. The specimen given in Fig. 68 is the work of the ancient Lake-Dwellers of Switzerland. It is a mat plaited or woven of strips of bast, and was found at Robenhausen, having been preserved in a charred state.[2] Keller gives another example of a similar fabric of much finer texture in Fig. 8, Pl. CXXXVI.    [Illustration: Fig. 68.--Fabric from Swiss Lake-Dwellings.]      [Footnote 2: Keller: Lake-Dwellers. Fig. 2, Pl. CXXXIV.]  An illustration of this form of fabric is given by Foster,[3] and reproduced in Fig. 69.    [Illustration: Fig. 69.--Cloth from a mound, Ohio.]      [Footnote 3: Foster: Prehistoric Times.]  In the same place this author presents another form of cloth shown in my Fig. 70. In Fig. 71 we have a section of this fabric. These cloths, with a number of other specimens, were taken from a mound on the west side of the Great Miama River, Butler County, Ohio. The fabric in both samples appears to be composed of some material allied to hemp. As his remarks on these specimens, as well as on the general subject, are quite interesting, I quote them somewhat at length.    \"The separation between the fibre and the wood appears to have been   as thorough and effectual as at this day by the process of rotting and   hackling. The thread, though coarse, is uniform in size, and regularly   spun. Two modes of weaving are recognized: In one, by the alternate   intersection of the warp and woof, and in the other, the weft is wound   once around the warp, a process which could not be accomplished except   by hand. In the illustration the interstices have been enlarged to   show the method of weaving, but in the original the texture was about   the same as that in coarse sail-cloth. In some of the Butler County   specimens there is evidently a fringed border.\"    [Illustration: Fig. 70.--Cloth from a mound, Ohio.]    [Illustration: Fig. 71.--Section.]  In regard to the second specimen described, I would remark that it is a very unusual form, no such combination of the parts having come to my notice either in the ancient fabrics themselves or in the impressions on pottery. In a very closely woven cloth it might be possible to employ such a combination, each thread of the web being turned once around each thread of the woof as shown in Fig. 71; but certainly it"]]]
