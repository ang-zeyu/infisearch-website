She looks anxiously back into the chamber as ISOLDA emerges thence in ardent animation_.]  ISOLDA. Yet do you hear? I lost the sound some time.  BRANGÆNA (_listening_). Still do they stay: clearly rings the horns.  ISOLDA (_listening_). Fear but deludes thy anxious ear; by sounds of rustling leaves thou'rt deceived, aroused by laughter of winds.  BRANGÆNA. Deceived by wild desire art thou, and but hear'st as would thy will:-- I still hear the sound of horns.  ISOLDA (_listens_). No sound of horns were so sweet: yon fountain's soft murmuring current moves so quietly hence. If horns yet brayed, how could I hear that? In still night alone it laughs on mine ear. My lov'd one hides in darkness unseen: wouldst thou hold from my side my dearest? deeming that horns thou hearest?  BRANGÆNA. Thy lov'd one hid-- oh heed my warning!-- for him a spy waits by night. Listening oft I light upon him: he lays a secret snare. Of Melot oh beware!  ISOLDA. Mean you Sir Melot? O, how you mistake! Is he not Tristan's trustiest friend? May my true love not meet me, with none but Melot he stays.  BRANGÆNA. What moves me to fear him makes thee his friend then? Through Tristan to Mark's side is Melot's way: he sows suspicion's seed. And those who have to-day on a night-hunt so suddenly decided, a far nobler game than is guessed by thee taxes their hunting skill.  ISOLDA. For Tristan's sake contrived was this scheme by means of Melot, in truth: now would you decry his friendship? He serves Isolda better than you his hand gives help which yours denies: what need of such delay? The signal, Brangæna! O give the signal! Tread out the torch's trembling gleam, that night may envelop all with her veil. Already her peace reigns o'er hill and hall, her rapturous awe the heart does enthral; allow then the light to fall! Let but its dread lustre die! let my beloved draw nigh!  BRANGÆNA. The light of warning suppress not! Let it remind thee of peril!-- Ah, woe's me! Woe's me! Fatal folly! The fell pow'r of that potion! That I framed a fraud for once thy orders to oppose! Had I been deaf and blind, thy work were then thy death: but thy distress, thy distraction of grief, my work has contrived them, I own it!  ISOLDA. Thy--act? O foolish girl! Love's goddess dost thou not know? nor all her magic arts? The queen who grants unquailing hearts, the witch whose will the world obeys, life and death she holds in her hands, which of joy and woe are wove? she worketh hate into love. The work of death I took into my own hands; Love's goddess saw and gave her good commands The death--condemned she claimed as her prey, planning our fate in her own way. How she may bend it, how she may end it, what she may make me, wheresoe'er take me, still hers am I solely;-- so let me obey her wholly.  BRANGÆNA. And if by the artful love-potion's lures thy light of reason is ravished, if thou art reckless when I would warn thee, this once, oh, wait and weigh my pleading! I implore, leave it alight!-- The torch! the torch! O put it not out this night!  ISOLDA. She who causes thus my bosom's throes, whose eager fire within me glows, whose light upon my spirit flows, Love's goddess needs that night should close; that brightly she may reign and shun the torchlight vain.  (_She goes up to the door and takes down the torch_.)  Go watch without-- keep wary guard! The signal!-- and were it my spirit's spark, smiling I'd destroy it and hail the dark!  [_She throws the torch to the ground where it slowly dies out. BRANGÆNA turns away, disturbed, and mounts an outer flight of steps leading to the roof, where she slowly disappears. ISOLDA listens and peers, at first shyly, towards an avenue. Urged, by rising impatience, she then approaches the avenue and looks more boldly. She signs with her handkerchief, first slightly, then more plainly, waving it quicker as her impatience increases. A gesture of sudden delight shows that she has perceived her lover in the distance. She stretches herself higher and higher, and then, to look better over the intervening space, hastens back to the steps, from the top of which she signals again to the on-comer. As he enters, she springs to meet him_.]   SCENE II.  TRISTAN (_rushing in_). Isolda! Beloved!  ISOLDA. Tristan! Beloved one!  (_Passionate embrace, with which they come down to the front_.)  BOTH.

THE LITTLE RED HOUSE  Very few grown-up people understand houses. Only children understand them properly, and, if I understand them just a little, it is because I knew Sym. Sym and his wife, Emily Ann, lived in the Little Red House. It was built on a rather big mountain, and there were no other houses near it. At one time, long ago, the mountain had been covered all over with a great forest; but men had cut the trees down, all but one big Blue-gum, which grew near the Little Red House. The Blue-gum and the Little Red House were great friends, and often had long talks together. The Blue-gum was a very old tree--over a hundred years old--and he was proud of it, and often used to tell of the time, long ago, when blackfellows hunted 'possums in his branches. That was before the white men came to the mountain, and before there were any houses near it.  Once upon a time I put a verse about the mountain and the Little Red House into a book of rhymes which I wrote for grown ups. I don't think they thought much about it. Very likely they said, \"0h, it's just a house on a hill,\" and then forgot it, because they were too busy about other things.  This is the rhyme:  A great mother mountain, and kindly is she, Who nurses young rivers and sends them to sea. And, nestled high up on her sheltering lap, Is a little red house, with a little straw cap That bears a blue feather of smoke, curling high, And a bunch of red roses cocked over one eye.  I have tried here to draw the Little Red House for you as well as I can; and it isn't my fault if it happens to look just a little like somebody's face. I can't help it, can I? if the stones of the door-step look something like teeth, or if the climbing roses make the windows look like a funny pair of spectacles. And if Emily Ann will hang bib fluffy bobs on the window blinds for tassels, and if they swing about in the breeze like moving eyes, well, I am not to blame, am I? It just happens. The only thing I am sorry for is that I couldn't get the big Blue-gum into the picture. Of course, I could have drawn it quite easily, but it was too big.  Sym and Emily Ann were fond of the Little Red House, and you may be sure the Little Red House was fond of them--he was their home. The only thing that bothered him was that they were sometimes away from home, and then he was miserable, like all empty houses.  Now, Sym was a tinker--a travelling tinker. He would do a little gardening and farming at home for a while, and then go off about the country for a few days, mending people's pots and pans and kettles. Usually Sym left Emily Ann at home to keep the Little Red House company, but now and then Emily Ann went with Sym for a trip, and then the Little Red House was very sad indeed.  One morning, just as the sun was peeping over the edge of the world, the big Blue-gum woke up and stretched his limbs and waited for the Little Red House to say \"Good morning.\" The Blue-gum always waited for the greeting because he was the older, and he liked to have proper respect shown to him by young folk, but the Little Red House didn't say a word.  The big Blue-gum waited and waited; but the Little Red House wouldn't speak.  After a while the Blue-gum said rather crossly, \"You seem to be out of sorts this morning.\"  But the Little Red House wouldn't say a word.  \"You certainly do seem as if you had a pain somewhere,\" said the Blue-gum. \"And you look funny. You ought to see yourself!\"  \"Indeed?\" snapped the Little Red House, raising his eyebrows just as a puff of wind went by. \"I can't always be playing the fool, like some people.\"  \"I've lived on this mountain, tree and sapling, for over a hundred years,\" replied the big Blue-gum very severely, \"and never before have I been treated with such disrespect. When trees become houses they seem to lose their manners.\"  \"Forgive me,\" cried the Little Red House. \"I didn't mean to be rude. I was just listening. There are things going on inside me that I don't like.\"  \"I hope they aren't ill-treating you,\" said the Blue-gum.  \"They are going to leave me!\" sighed the Little Red House.  \"And they are laughing quite happily, as if they were glad about it. There's a nice thing for you!--Going to leave me, and laughing about it!\"  \"But perhaps you are wrong,\" said the big Blue-gum, who was not so hard-hearted as he seemed.  \"I always know,\" moaned the Little Red House. \"I can't be mistaken. Sym was singing his Tinker's song this morning long before the sun was up. And then I heard him tell Emily Ann not to forget her umbrella. That means that she is going; and the little dog is going, and I shall be all alone.\"  \"Well,\" answered the Blue-gum rather stiffly, \"you still have ME for company.\"  \"I know,\" sighed the Little Red House. \"Don't think I'm ungrateful. But, when they both go away, I shan't be really and truly a home again until they come back--just an empty house; and it makes me miserable. How would YOU like to be an empty house?\"  \"Some day I might be,\" replied the Blue-gum, \"if I don't grow too old. There is some fine timber in me yet.\"  Suddenly there was a great clattering and stamping inside the Little House, and Sym began to sing his Tinker's song.  \"Kettles and pans! Kettles and pans! All the broad earth is the tinkering man's-- The green leafy lane or the fields are his home, The road or the river, where'er he way roam. He roves for a living and rests where he can. Then bring out your kettle! ho! kettle or pan!\"  There's a nice thing for you!\" said the Little Red House bitterly. \"What kind of a song do you call that? Any old place is good enough for his home, and I am just nothing!\"  \"Oh, that's only his way of putting it,\" answered the Blue-gum kindly. \"He doesn't really mean it, you know; he wants a change, that's all.\"  But the Little Red House wouldn't say a word.  \"It looks a good deal like rain this morning, doesn't it?\" said the Blue-gum cheerfully, trying to change the subject.  But the Little Red House wouldn't say a word.  Very soon Sym and Emily Ann, carrying bundles, came out of the Little Red House, laughing and talking; and Sym locked the door.  \"Now for a jolly trip!\" shouted Sym, as he picked up his firepot and soldering-irons.  But all at once Emily Ann ceased laughing and looked back wistfully at the Little Red House.  \"After all I'm sorry to leave our little home,\" she said. \"See how sad it looks!\"  \"Hurry on!\" cried Sym, who was all eagerness for the trip. Then he, too, looked back. \"Why, you forgot to draw down the blinds,\" he said.  \"No, I didn't forget,\" answered Emily Ann, \"but I think it a shame to blindfold the Little Red House while we are away. I just left the blinds up so that he could see things. Good-bye, little home,\" she called. And the Little Red House felt just the least bit comforted to think that Emily Ann was sorry to leave him. Then she went off down the winding path with Sym; and Sym began to shout his Tinker's Song again.  The Little Red House watched them go down the mountain.  Away they went: through the gate, past the black stump, round by the bracken patch and over the bridge, across the potato paddock, through the sliprails--getting smaller and smaller--past the sign-post, down by the big rocks--getting smaller and smaller--under the tree-ferns, out on to the stony flat, across the red road, until they were just two tiny specks away down in the valley. Then they went through a white gate, round a turn, and the high scrub hid them.  Had you been able to see the Little Red House just at that moment, you would have been sure he was going to cry--he looked so miserable and so lonely.  \"Cheer up!\" said the big Blue-gum.  But the Little Red House couldn't say a word.  Presently the big Blue-gum groaned loudly.  \"Oo! Ah! Ah! Golly!\" groaned the Blue-gum in a strange voice.  \"I beg your pardon? said the Little Red House.  \"Oh, I have a nasty sharp pain in my side,\" said the Blue-gum. \"I do hope and trust it isn't white-ants. It would be simply horrible, if it were. Fancy getting white-ants at my time of life! Here I have lived on this mountain, tree and sapling, for over a hundred years; and to think those nasty, white, flabby little things should get me at last is horrible--horrible!\"  \"I am sorry,\" said the Little Red House. \"I'm afraid I've been very selfish, too. I was forgetting that everyone has troubles of his own; but I hope it isn't so bad as you fear.\"  \"It is bad enough,\" groaned the Blue-gum. \"Ow! There it is again. I'm afraid it IS white-ants. I can feel the wretched little things nipping.\"  But the Little Red House hardly heard him. He was thinking again of his own troubles.  So they stood all through that day, saying very little to each other. Rabbits came and played about the Little Red House, and lizards ran over his door-step, and once a big wallaby went flopping right past the front gate. But the Little Red House paid no attention. He was too busy thinking of his loneliness.  Birds came and perched in the branches of the big Blue-gum, and chattered and sang to him, trying to tell him the news of other trees on distant mountains. But the big Blue-gum took no notice. He was too busy thinking about white-ants.  So the sun sank low behind the Little House, and the shadow of the tall Blue-gum began to creep down the mountain and get longer and longer.  Just as it was growing dark, the big Blue-gum said Suddenly, \"It certainly looks more like rain than ever. The heavy clouds have been gathering all day, and we shall get it properly to-night.\"  But the rain did not come that night, nor the next day, nor for two days and nights. And all this while the Little Red House and the Big Blue-gum remained silent and miserable--one through loneliness, the other through white-ants.  "]]]
