(#2)"],["body"," books of a certain English clergyman have had a sale of stupendous magnitude notwithstanding they are full of absurdities. The clergyman has a multitudinous companionship, moreover, among novelists, essayists, and poets whose safety lies in more or less fantastic generalization when they come to talk about music. How they flounder when they come to detail! It was Charles Lamb who said, in his \"Chapter on Ears,\" that in voices he could not distinguish a soprano from a tenor, and could only contrive to guess at the thorough-bass from its being \"supereminently harsh and disagreeable;\" yet dear old Elia may be forgiven, since his confounding the bass voice with a system of musical short-hand is so delightful a proof of the ignorance he was confessing.  [Sidenote: _Literary realism and musical terminology._]  But what shall the troubled critics say to Tennyson's orchestra consisting of a flute, violin, and bassoon? Or to Coleridge's \"_loud_ bassoon,\" which made the wedding-guest to beat his breast? Or to Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe's pianist who played \"with an airy and bird-like touch?\" Or to our own clever painter-novelist who, in \"Snubbin' through Jersey,\" has Brushes bring out his violoncello and play \"the symphonies of Beethoven\" to entertain his fellow canal-boat passengers? The tendency toward realism, or \"veritism,\" as it is called, has brought out a rich crop of blunders. It will not do to have a character in a story simply sing or play something; we must have the names of composers and compositions. The genial gentleman who enriched musical literature with arrangements of Beethoven's symphonies for violoncello without accompaniment has since supplemented this feat by creating a German fiddler who, when he thinks himself unnoticed, plays a sonata for violin and contralto voice; Professor Brander Matthews permits one of his heroines to sing Schumann's \"Warum?\" and one of his heroes plays \"The Moonlight Concerto;\" one of Ouida's romantic creatures spends hours at an organ \"playing the grand old masses of Mendelssohn;\" in \"Moths\" the tenor never wearies of singing certain \"exquisite airs of Palestrina,\" which recalls the fact that an indignant correspondent of a St. Louis newspaper, protesting against the Teutonism and heaviness of an orchestra conductor's programmes, demanded some of the \"lighter\" works of \"Berlioz and Palestrina.\"  [Sidenote: _A popular need._]  Alas! these things and the many others equally amusing which Mr. G. Sutherland Edwards long ago catalogued in an essay on \"The Literary Maltreatment of Music\" are but evidences that even cultured folk have not yet learned to talk correctly about the art which is practised most widely. There is a greater need than pianoforte teachers and singing teachers, and that is a numerous company of writers and talkers who shall teach the people how to listen to music so that it shall not pass through their heads like a vast tonal phantasmagoria, but provide the varied and noble delights contemplated by the composers.  [Sidenote: _A warning against writers._]  [Sidenote: _Pedants and rhapsodists._]  Ungracious as it might appear, it may yet not be amiss, therefore, at the very outset of an inquiry into the proper way in which to listen to music, to utter a warning against much that is written on the art. As a rule it will be found that writers on music are divided into two classes, and that neither of these classes can do much good. Too often they are either pedants or rhapsodists. This division is wholly natural. Music has many sides and is a science as well as an art. Its scientific side is that on which the pedant generally approaches it. He is concerned with forms and rules, with externals, to the forgetting of that which is inexpressibly nobler and higher. But the pedants are not harmful, because they are not interesting; strictly speaking, they do not write for the public at all, but only for their professional colleagues. The harmful men are the foolish rhapsodists who take advantage of the fact that the language of music is indeterminate and evanescent to talk about the art in such a way as to present themselves as persons of exquisite sensibilities rather than to direct attention to the real nature and beauty of music itself. To them I shall recur in a later chapter devoted to musical criticism, and haply point out the difference between good and bad critics and commentators from the view-point of popular need and popular opportunity.     II  _Recognition of Musical Elements_   [Sidenote: _The nature of music._]  Music is dual in its nature; it is material as well as spiritual. Its material side we apprehend through the sense of hearing, and comprehend through the intellect; its spiritual side reaches us through the fancy (or imagination, so it be music of the highest class), and the emotional part of us. If the scope and capacity of the art, and the evolutionary processes which its history discloses (a record of which is preserved in its nomenclature), are to be understood, it is essential that this duality be kept in view. There is something so potent and elemental in the appeal which music makes that it is possible to derive pleasure from even an unwilling hearing or a hearing unaccompanied by effort at analysis; but real appreciation of its beauty, which means recognition of the qualities which put it in the realm of art, is conditioned upon intelligent hearing. The higher the intelligence, the keener will be the enjoyment, if the former be directed to the spiritual side as well as the material.  [Sidenote: _Necessity of intelligent hearing._]  So far as music is merely agreeably co-ordinated sounds, it may be reduced to mathematics and its practice to handicraft. But recognition of design is a condition precedent to the awakening of the fancy or the imagination, and to achieve such recognition there must be intelligent hearing in the first instance. For the purposes of this study, design may be held to be Form in its primary stages, the recognition of which is possible to every listener who is fond of music; it is not necessary that he be learned in the science. He need only be willing to let an intellectual process, which will bring its own reward, accompany the physical process of hearing.  [Sidenote: _Tones and musical material._]  Without discrimination it is impossible to recognize even the crude materials of music, for the first step is already a co-ordination of those materials. A tone becomes musical material only by association with another tone. We might hear it alone, study its quality, and determine its degree of acuteness or gravity (its pitch, as musicians say), but it can never become music so long as it remains isolated. When we recognize that it bears certain relationships with other tones in respect of time or tune (to use simple terms), it has become for us musical material. We do not need to philosophize about the nature of those relationships, but we must recognize their existence.  [Sidenote: _The beginnings of Form._]  Thus much we might hear if we were to let music go through our heads like water through a sieve. Yet the step from that degree of discrimination to a rudimentary analysis of Form is exceedingly short, and requires little more than a willingness to concentrate the attention and exercise the memory. Everyone is willing to do that much while looking at a picture. Who would look at a painting and rest satisfied with the impression made upon the sense of sight by the colors merely? No one, surely. Yet so soon as we look, so as to discriminate between the outlines, to observe the relationship of figure to figure, we are indulging in intellectual exercise. If this be a condition precedent to the enjoyment of a picture (and it plainly is), how much more so is it in the case of music, which is intangible and evanescent, which cannot pause a moment for our contemplation without ceasing to be?  [Sidenote: _Comparison with a model not possible._]  There is another reason why we must exercise intelligence in listening, to which I have already alluded in the first chapter. Our appreciation of beauty in the plastic arts is helped by the circumstance that the critical activity is largely a matter of comparison. Is the picture or the statue a good copy of the object sought to be represented? Such comparison fails us utterly in music, which copies nothing that is tangibly present in the external world.  [Sidenote: _What degree of knowledge is necessary?_]  [Sidenote: _The Elements._]  [Sidenote: _Value of memory._]  It is then necessary to associate the intellect with sense perception in listening to music. How far is it essential that the intellectual process shall go? This book being for the untrained, the question might be put thus: With how little knowledge of the science can an intelligent listener get along? We are concerned only with his enjoyment of music or, better, with an effort to increase it without asking him to become a musician. If he is fond of the art it is more than likely that the capacity to discriminate sufficiently to recognize the elements out of which music is made has come to him intuitively. Does he recognize that musical tones are related to each other in respect of time and pitch? Then it shall not be difficult for him to recognize the three elements on which music rests--Melody, Harmony, and Rhythm. Can he recognize them with sufficient distinctness to seize upon their manifestations while music is sounding? Then memory shall come to the aid of discrimination, and he shall be able to appreciate enough of design to point the way to a true and lofty appreciation of the beautiful in music. The value of memory is for obvious reasons very great in musical enjoyment. The picture remains upon the wall, the book upon the library shelf. If we have failed to grasp a detail at the first glance or reading, we need but turn again to the picture or open the book anew. We may see the picture in a changed light, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1748"],["title","Other People's Money (#1)"],["body","son, when dinner was announced.  “Come,” exclaimed M. Chapelain, the old lawyer, the conciliating man par excellence,--“come, let us to the table.”  They sat down.  But Mme. Favoral had scarcely helped the soup, when the bell rang violently.  Almost at the same moment the servant appeared, and announced:  “The Baron de Thaller!”  More pale than his napkin, the cashier stood up.  “The manager,” he stammered, “the director of the Mutual Credit Society.”    II  Close upon the heels of the servant M. de Thaller came.  Tall, thin, stiff, he had a very small head, a flat face, pointed nose, and long reddish whiskers, slightly shaded with silvery threads, falling half-way down his chest.  Dressed in the latest style, he wore a loose overcoat of rough material, pantaloons that spread nearly to the tip of his boots, a wide shirt-collar turned over a light cravat, on the bow of which shone a large diamond, and a tall hat with rolled brims.  With a blinking glance, he made a rapid estimate of the dining-room, the shabby furniture, and the guests seated around the table.  Then, without even condescending to touch his hat, with his large hand tightly fitted into a lavender glove, in a brief and imperious tone, and with a slight accent which he affirmed was the Alsatian accent:  “I must speak with you, Vincent,” said he to his cashier, “alone and at once.”  M. Favoral made visible efforts to conceal his anxiety.  “You see,”  he commenced, “we are dining with a few friends, and--”  “Do you wish me to speak in presence of everybody?” interrupted harshly the manager of the Mutual Credit.  The cashier hesitated no longer.  Taking up a candle from the table, he opened the door leading to the parlor, and, standing respectfully to one side:  “Be kind enough to pass on, sir,” said he: “I follow you.”  And, at the moment of disappearing himself,  “Continue to dine without me,” said he to his guests, with a last effort at self-control.  “I shall soon catch up with you.  This will take but a moment.  Do not be uneasy in the least.”  They were not uneasy, but surprised, and, above all, shocked at the manners of M. de Thaller.  “What a brute!” muttered Mme. Desclavettes.  M. Desormeaux, the head clerk at the Department of Justice, was an old legitimist, much imbued with reactionary ideas.  “Such are our masters,” said he with a sneer, “the high barons of financial feudality.  Ah! you are indignant at the arrogance of the old aristocracy; well, on your knees, by Jupiter! on your face, rather, before the golden crown on field of gules.”  No one replied: every one was trying his best to hear.  In the parlor, between M. Favoral and M. de Thaller, a discussion of the utmost violence was evidently going on.  To seize the meaning of it was not possible; and yet through the door, the upper panels of which were of glass, fragments could be heard; and from time to time such words distinctly reached the ear as dividend, stockholders, deficit, millions, etc.  “What can it all mean? great heaven!” moaned Mme. Favoral.  Doubtless the two interlocutors, the director and the cashier, had drawn nearer to the door of communication; for their voices, which rose more and more, had now become quite distinct.  “It is an infamous trap!” M. Favoral was saying.  “I should have been notified--”  “Come, come,” interrupted the other.  “Were you not fully warned? did I ever conceal any thing from you?”  Fear, a fear vague still, and unexplained, was slowly taking possession of the guests; and they remained motionless, their forks in suspense, holding their breath.  “Never,” M. Favoral was repeating, stamping his foot so violently that the partition shook,--“never, never!”  “And yet it must be,” declared M. de Thaller.  “It is the only, the last resource.”  “And suppose I will not!”  “Your will has nothing to do with it now.  It is twenty years ago that you might have willed, or not willed.  But listen to me, and let us reason a little.”  Here M. de Thaller dropped his voice; and for some minutes nothing was heard in the dining-room, except confused words, and incomprehensible exclamations, until suddenly,  “That is ruin,” he resumed in a furious tone: “it is bankruptcy on the last of the month.”  “Sir,” the cashier was replying,--“sir!”  “You are a forger, M. Vincent Favoral; you are a thief!”  Maxence leaped from his seat.  “I shall not permit my father to be thus insulted in his own house,”  he exclaimed.  “Maxence,” begged Mme. Favoral, “my son!”  The old lawyer, M. Chapelain, held him by the arm; but he struggled hard, and was about to burst into the parlor, when the door opened, and the director of the Mutual Credit stepped out.  With a coolness quite remarkable after such a scene, he advanced towards Mlle. Gilberte, and, in a tone of offensive protection,  “Your father is a wretch, mademoiselle,” he said; “and my duty should be to surrender him at once into the hands of justice.  On account of your worthy mother, however, of your father himself, above all, on your own account, mademoiselle, I shall forbear doing so.  But let him fly, let him disappear, and never more be heard from.”  He drew from his pocket a roll of bank-notes, and, throwing them upon the table,  “Hand him this,” he added.  “Let him leave this very night.  The police may have been notified.  There is a train for Brussels at five minutes past eleven.”  And, having bowed, he withdrew, no one addressing him a single word, so great was the astonishment of all the guests of this house, heretofore so peaceful.  Overcome with stupor, Maxence had dropped upon his chair.  Mlle. Gilberte alone retained some presence of mind.  “It is a shame,” she exclaimed, “for us to give up thus!  That man is an impostor, a wretch; he lies!  Father, father!”  M. Favoral had not waited to be called, and was standing up against the parlor-door, pale as death, and yet calm.  “Why attempt any explanations?” he said.  “The money is gone; and appearances are against me.”  His wife had drawn near to him, and taken his hand.  “The misfortune is immense,” she said, “but not irreparable.  We will sell everything we have.”  “Have you not friends?  Are we not here,” insisted the others,--M. Desclavettes, M. Desormeaux, and M. Chapelain.  Gently he pushed his wife aside, and coldly.  “All we had,” he said, “would be as a grain of sand in an ocean. But we have no longer anything; we are ruined.”  “Ruined!” exclaimed M. Desormeaux,--“ruined!  And where are the forty-five thousand francs I placed into your hands?”  He made no reply.  “And our hundred and twenty thousand francs?” groaned M. and Mme. Desclavettes.  “And my sixty thousand francs?” shouted M. Chapelain, with a blasphemous oath.  The cashier shrugged his shoulders.  “Lost,” he said, “irrevocably lost!”  Then their rage exceeded all bounds.  Then they forgot that this unfortunate man had been their friend for twenty years, that they were his guests; and they commenced heaping upon him threats and insults without name.  He did not even deign to defend himself.  “Go on,” he uttered, “go on.  When a poor dog, carried away by the current, is drowning, men of heart cast stones at him from the bank. Go on!”  “You should have told us that you speculated,” screamed M. Desclavettes.  On hearing these words, he straightened himself up, and with a gesture so terrible that the others stepped back frightened.  “What!” said he, in a tone of crushing irony, “it is this evening only, that you discover that I speculated?  Kind friends!  Where, then, and in whose pockets, did you suppose I was getting the enormous interests I have been paying you for years?  Where have you ever seen honest money, the money of labor, yield twelve or fourteen per cent?  The money that yields thus is the money of the gaming table, the money of the bourse.  Why did you bring me your funds?  Because you were fully satisfied that I knew how to handle the cards.  Ah!  If I was to tell you that I had doubled your capital, you would not ask how I did it, nor whether I had stocked the cards. You would virtuously pocket the money.  But I have lost: I am a thief.  Well, so be it.  But, then, you are all my accomplices.  It is the avidity of the dupes which induces the trickery of the sharpers.”  Here he was interrupted by the servant coming in.  “Sir,” she exclaimed excitedly, “O sir! the courtyard is full of police agents. They are speaking to the concierge.  They are coming up stairs: I hear them!”    III  According to the time and place where they are uttered, there are words which acquire a terrible significance.  In this disordered room, in the midst of these excited people, that word, the “police,”  sounded like a thunderclap.  “Do not open,” Maxence ordered; “do not open, however they may ring or knock.  Let them burst the door first.”  The very excess of her fright restored to Mme. Favoral a portion of her energy.  Throwing herself before her husband as if to protect him, as if to defend him,  “They are coming to arrest you, Vincent,” she exclaimed.  “They are coming; don’t you hear them?”  He remained motionless, his feet seemingly riveted to the floor.  “That is as I expected,” he said.  And with the accent of the wretch who sees all hope vanish, and who utterly gives up all struggle,  “Be it so,” he said.  “Let them arrest me, and let all be over at once. I have had enough anxiety, enough unbearable alternatives.  I am tired always to feign, to deceive, and to lie.  Let them arrest me!  Any misfortune will be smaller in reality than the horrors of uncertainty. I have nothing more to fear now.  For the first time in many years I shall sleep to-night.”  He did not notice the sinister expression of his guests.  “You think I am a thief,” he added: “well, be satisfied, justice shall be done.”  But he attributed to them sentiments which were no longer theirs. They had forgotten their anger, and their bitter resentment for their lost money.  The imminence of the peril awoke suddenly in their souls the"]]]
