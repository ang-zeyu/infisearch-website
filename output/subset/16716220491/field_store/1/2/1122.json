But there, like a wayward boy, I took more pleasure in the battles of the \"nations\"--as of Fife against Galloway and the Lennox; or in games of catch-pull, football, wrestling, hurling the bar, archery, and golf--than in divine learning--as of logic, and Aristotle his analytics.  Yet I loved to be in the scriptorium of the Abbey, and to see the good Father Peter limning the blessed saints in blue, and red, and gold, of which art he taught me a little.  Often I would help him to grind his colours, and he instructed me in the laying of them on paper or vellum, with white of egg, and in fixing and burnishing the gold, and in drawing flowers, and figures, and strange beasts and devils, such as we see grinning from the walls of the cathedral.  In the French language, too, he learned me, for he had been taught at the great University of Paris; and in Avignon had seen the Pope himself, Benedict XIII., of uncertain memory.  Much I loved to be with Father Peter, whose lessons did not irk me, but jumped with my own desire to read romances in the French tongue, whereof there are many.  But never could I have dreamed that, in days to come, this art of painting would win me my bread for a while, and that a Leslie of Pitcullo should be driven by hunger to so base and contemned a handiwork, unworthy, when practised for gain, of my blood.  Yet it would have been well for me to follow even this craft more, and my sports and pastimes less: Dickon Melville had then escaped a broken head, and I, perchance, a broken heart.  But youth is given over to vanities that war against the soul, and, among others, to that wicked game of the Golf, now justly cried down by our laws, {2} as the mother of cursing and idleness, mischief and wastery, of which game, as I verily believe, the devil himself is the father.  It chanced, on an October day of the year of grace Fourteen hundred and twenty-eight, that I was playing myself at this accursed sport with one Richard Melville, a student of like age with myself.  We were evenly matched, though Dickon was tall and weighty, being great of growth for his age, whereas I was of but scant inches, slim, and, as men said, of a girlish countenance.  Yet I was well skilled in the game of the Golf, and have driven a Holland ball the length of an arrow-flight, there or thereby.  But wherefore should my sinful soul be now in mind of these old vanities, repented of, I trust, long ago?  As we twain, Dickon and I, were known for fell champions at this unholy sport, many of the other scholars followed us, laying wagers on our heads.  They were but a wild set of lads, for, as then, there was not, as now there is, a house appointed for scholars to dwell in together under authority.  We wore coloured clothes, and our hair long; gold chains, and whingers {3} in our belts, all of which things are now most righteously forbidden.  But I carried no whinger on the links, as considering that it hampered a man in his play.  So the game went on, now Dickon leading \"by a hole,\" as they say, and now myself, and great wagers were laid on us.  Now, at the hole that is set high above the Eden, whence you see far over the country, and the river-mouth, and the shipping, it chanced that my ball lay between Dickon's and the hole, so that he could in no manner win past it.  \"You laid me that stimy of set purpose,\" cried Dickon, throwing down his club in a rage; \"and this is the third time you have done it in this game.\"  \"It is clean against common luck,\" quoth one of his party, \"and the game and the money laid on it should be ours.\"  \"By the blessed bones of the Apostle,\" I said, \"no luck is more common. To-day to me, to-morrow to thee!  Lay it of purpose, I could not if I would.\"  \"You lie!\" he shouted in a rage, and gripped to his whinger.  It was ever my father's counsel that I must take the lie from none. Therefore, as his steel was out, and I carried none, I made no more ado, and the word of shame had scarce left his lips when I felled him with the iron club that we use in sand.  \"He is dead!\" cried they of his party, while the lads of my own looked askance on me, and had manifestly no mind to be partakers in my deed.  Now, Melville came of a great house, and, partly in fear of their feud, partly like one amazed and without any counsel, I ran and leaped into a boat that chanced to lie convenient on the sand, and pulled out into the Eden.  Thence I saw them raise up Melville, and bear him towards the town, his friends lifting their hands against me, with threats and malisons.  His legs trailed and his head wagged like the legs and the head of a dead man, and I was without hope in the world.  At first it was my thought to row up the river-mouth, land, and make across the marshes and fields to our house at Pitcullo.  But I bethought me that my father was an austere man, whom I had vexed beyond bearing with my late wicked follies, into which, since the death of my mother, I had fallen.  And now I was bringing him no college prize, but a blood- feud, which he was like to find an ill heritage enough, even without an evil and thankless son.  My stepmother, too, who loved me little, would inflame his anger against me.  Many daughters he had, and of gear and goods no more than enough.  Robin, my elder brother, he had let pass to France, where he served among the men of John Kirkmichael, Bishop of Orleans--he that smote the Duke of Clarence in fair fight at Bauge.  Thinking of my father, and of my stepmother's ill welcome, and of Robin, abroad in the wars against our old enemy of England, it may be that I fell into a kind of half dream, the boat lulling me by its movement on the waters.  Suddenly I felt a crashing blow on my head.  It was as if the powder used for artillery had exploded in my mouth, with flash of light and fiery taste, and I knew nothing.  Then, how long after I could not tell, there was water on my face, the blue sky and the blue tide were spinning round--they spun swiftly, then slowly, then stood still.  There was a fierce pain stounding in my head, and a voice said--  \"That good oar-stroke will learn you to steal boats!\"  I knew the voice; it was that of a merchant sailor-man with whom, on the day before, I had quarrelled in the market-place.  Now I was lying at the bottom of a boat which four seamen, who had rowed up to me and had broken my head as I meditated, were pulling towards a merchant-vessel, or carrick, in the Eden-mouth.  Her sails were being set; the boat wherein I lay was towing that into which I had leaped after striking down Melville. For two of the ship's men, being on shore, had hailed their fellows in the carrick, and they had taken vengeance upon me.  \"You scholar lads must be taught better than your masters learn you,\" said my enemy.  And therewith they carried me on board the vessel, the \"St. Margaret,\" of Berwick, laden with a cargo of dried salmon from Eden-mouth.  They meant me no kindness, for there was an old feud between the scholars and the sailors; but it seemed to me, in my foolishness, that now I was in luck's way.  I need not go back, with blood on my hands, to Pitcullo and my father.  I had money in my pouch, my mother's gold chain about my neck, a ship's deck under my foot, and the seas before me.  It was not hard for me to bargain with the shipmaster for a passage to Berwick, whence I might put myself aboard a vessel that traded to Bordeaux for wine from that country.  The sailors I made my friends at no great cost, for indeed they were the conquerors, and could afford to show clemency, and hold me to slight ransom as a prisoner of war.  So we lifted anchor, and sailed out of Eden-mouth, none of those on shore knowing how I was aboard the carrick that slipped by the bishop's castle, and so under the great towers of the minster and St. Rule's, forth to the Northern Sea.  Despite my broken head--which put it comfortably into my mind that maybe Dickon's was no worse--I could have laughed to think how clean I had vanished away from St. Andrews, as if the fairies had taken me.  Now having time to reason of it quietly, I picked up hope for Dickon's life, remembering his head to be of the thickest.  Then came into my mind the many romances of chivalry which I had read, wherein the young squire has to flee his country for a chance blow, as did Messire Patroclus, in the Romance of Troy, who slew a man in anger over the game of the chess, and many another knight, in the tales of Charlemagne and his paladins.  For ever it is thus the story opens, and my story, methought, was beginning to-day like the rest.  Now, not to prove more wearisome than need be, and so vex those who read this chronicle with much talk about myself, and such accidents of travel as beset all voyagers, and chiefly in time of war, I found a trading ship at Berwick, and reached Bordeaux safe, after much sickness on the sea. And in Bordeaux, with a very sore heart, I changed the links of my mother's chain that were left to me--all but four, that still I keep--for money of that country; and so, with a lighter pack than spirit, I set forth towards Orleans and to my brother Robin.  On this journey I had good cause to bless Father Peter of the Abbey for his teaching me the French tongue, that was of more service to me than all my Latin.  Yet my Latin, too, the little I knew, stood me in good stead at the monasteries, where often I found bed and board, and no small kindness; I little deeming that, in time to come, I also should be in religion, an old man and weary, glad to speak with travellers concerning the news of the world, from which I am now these ten years retired.  Yet I love even better to call back memories of these days, when I took my part in the fray.  If this be a sin, may God and the Saints forgive me, for if I have fought, it was in a rightful cause, which Heaven at last has prospered, and in "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1631"],["title","A Monk of Fife (#2)"],["body","private quarrel.  And methinks I have one among the Saints to pray for me, as a friend for a friend not unfaithful.  But on this matter I submit me to the judgment of the Church, as in all questions of the faith.     CHAPTER II--HOW NORMAN LESLIE MET NOIROUFLE THE CORDELIER, CALLED BROTHER THOMAS IN RELIGION: AND OF MIRACLES WROUGHT BY BROTHER THOMAS   The ways were rude and long from Bordeaux town to Orleans, whither I had set my face, not knowing, when I left my own country, that the city was beleaguered by the English.  For who could guess that lords and knights of the Christian faith, holding captive the gentle Duke of Orleans, would besiege his own city?--a thing unheard of among the very Saracens, and a deed that God punished.  Yet the news of this great villainy, namely, the leaguer of Orleans, then newly begun, reached my ears on my landing at Bordeaux, and made me greatly fear that I might never meet my brother Robin alive.  And this my doubt proved but too true, for he soon after this time fell, with many other Scottish gentlemen and archers, deserted shamefully by the French and by Charles de Bourbon, Comte de Clermont, at the Battle of the Herrings.  But of this I knew nothing--as, indeed, the battle was not yet fought--and only pushed on for France, thinking to take service with the Dauphin against the English.  My journey was through a country ruinous enough, for, though the English were on the further bank of the Loire, the partisans of the Dauphin had made a ruin round themselves and their holds, and, not being paid, they lived upon the country.  The further north I held, by ways broken and ruined with rains and suns, the more bare and rugged grew the whole land.  Once, stopping hard by a hamlet, I had sat down to munch such food as I carried, and was sharing my meal with a little brown herd-boy, who told me that he was dinnerless. A few sheep and lean kine plucked at such scant grasses as grew among rocks, and herbs useless but sweet-scented, when suddenly a horn was blown from the tower of the little church.  The first note of that blast had not died away, when every cow and sheep was scampering towards the hamlet and a kind of \"barmkyn\" {4} they had builded there for protection, and the boy after them, running with his bare legs for dear life.  For me, I was too amazed to run in time, so lay skulking in the thick sweet- smelling herbs, whence I saw certain men-at-arms gallop to the crest of a cliff hard by, and ride on with curses, for they were not of strength to take the barmkyn.  Such was the face of France in many counties.  The fields lay weedy and untilled; the starving peasant-folk took to the highway, every man preying on his neighbour.  Woods had grown up, and broken in upon the roads.  Howbeit, though robbers harboured therein, none of them held to ransom a wandering poor Scots scholar.  Slowly I trudged, being often delayed, and I was now nearing Poictiers, and thought myself well on my road to Chinon, where, as I heard, the Dauphin lay, when I came to a place where the road should have crossed a stream--not wide, but strong, smooth, and very deep.  The stream ran through a glen; and above the road I had long noted the towers of a castle.  But as I drew closer, I saw first that the walls were black with fire and roofless, and that carrion birds were hovering over them, some enemy having fallen upon the place: and next, behold, the bridge was broken, and there was neither ford nor ferry!  All the ruin was fresh, the castle still smouldering, the kites flocking and yelling above the trees, the planks of the bridge showing that the destruction was but of yesterday.  This matter of the broken bridge cost me little thought, for I could swim like an otter.  But there was another traveller down by the stream who seemed more nearly concerned.  When I came close to him, I found him standing up to his waist in the water, taking soundings with a long and heavy staff.  His cordelier's frock was tucked up into his belt, his long brown legs, with black hairs thick on them, were naked.  He was a huge, dark man, and when he turned and stared at me, I thought that, among all men of the Church and in religion whom I had ever beheld, he was the foulest and most fierce to look upon.  He had an ugly, murderous visage, fell eyes and keen, and a right long nose, hooked like a falcon's.  The eyes in his head shone like swords, and of all eyes of man I ever saw, his were the most piercing and most terrible.  On his back he carried, as I noticed at the first, what I never saw on a cordelier's back before, or on any but his since--an arbalest, and he had bolts enough in his bag, the feathers showing above.  \"Pax vobiscum,\" he cried, in a loud, grating voice, as he saw me, and scrambled out to shore.  \"Et cum anima tua,\" I answered.  \"Nom de Dieu!\" he said, \"you have bottomed my Latin already, that is scarce so deep as the river here.  My malison on them that broke the bridge!\"  Then he looked me over fiercely.  \"Burgundy or Armagnac?\" he asked.  I thought the question strange, as a traveller would scarce care to pronounce for Burgundy in that country.  But this was a man who would dare anything, so I deemed it better to answer that I was a Scot, and, so far, of neither party.  \"Tug-mutton, wine-sack!\" he said, these being two of many ill names which the French gave our countrymen; for, of all men, the French are least grateful to us, who, under Heaven and the Maid, have set their King on his throne again.  The English knew this, if the French did not; and their great King, Harry the Fifth, when he fell ill of St. Fiacre's sickness, after plundering that Scots saint's shrine of certain horse-shoes, silver-gilt, said well that, \"go where he would, he was bearded by Scots, dead or alive.\"  But the French are not a thankful people.  I had no answer very ready to my tongue, so stepped down silent to the water-edge, and was about taking off my doublet and hose, meaning to carry them on my head and swim across.  But he barred the way with his staff, and, for me, I gripped to my whinger, and watched my chance to run in under his guard.  For this cordelier was not to be respected, I deemed, like others of the Order of St. Francis, and all men of Holy Church.  \"Answer a civil question,\" he said, \"before it comes to worse: Armagnac or Burgundy?\"  \"Armagnac,\" I answered, \"or anything else that is not English.  Clear the causeway, mad friar!\"  At that he threw down his staff.  \"I go north also,\" he said, \"to Orleans, if I may, for the foul 'manants' and peasant dogs of this country have burned the castle of Alfonse Rodigo, a good knight that held them in right good order this year past. He was worthy, indeed, to ride with that excellent captain, Don Rodrigo de Villandradas.  King's captain or village labourer, all was fish that came to his net, and but two days ago I was his honourable chaplain.  But he made the people mad, and a great carouse that we kept gave them their opportunity.  They have roasted the good knight Alfonse, and would have done as much for me, his almoner, frock and all, if wine had any mastery over me.  But I gave them the slip.  Heaven helps its own!  Natheless, I would that this river were between me and their vengeance, and, for once, I dread the smell of roast meat that is still in my nostrils--pah!\"  And here he spat on the ground.  \"But one door closes,\" he went on, \"and another opens, and to Orleans am I now bound, in the service of my holy calling.\"  \"There is, indeed, cause enough for the shriving of souls of sinners, Father, in that country, as I hear, and a holy man like you will be right welcome to many.\"  \"They need little shriving that are opposite my culverin,\" said this strange priest.  \"Though now I carry but an arbalest, the gun is my mistress, and my patron is the gunner's saint, St. Barbara.  And even with this toy, methinks I have the lives of a score of goddams in my bolt- pouch.\"  I knew that in these wild days many clerics were careless as to that which the Church enjoins concerning the effusion of blood--nay, I have named John Kirkmichael, Bishop of Orleans, as having himself broken a spear on the body of the Duke of Clarence.  The Abbe of Cerquenceaux, also, was a valiant man in religion, and a good captain, and, all over France, clerics were gripping to sword and spear.  But such a priest as this I did not expect to see.  \"Your name?\" he asked suddenly, the words coming out with a sound like the first grating of a saw on stone.  \"They call me Norman Leslie de Pitcullo,\" I answered.  \"And yours?\"  \"My name,\" he said, \"is Noiroufle\"--and I thought that never had I seen a man so well fitted with a name;--\"in religion, Brother Thomas, a poor brother of the Order of the mad St. Francis of Assisi.\"  \"Then, Brother Thomas, how do you mean to cross this water which lies between you and the exercise of your holy calling?  Do you swim?\"  \"Like a stone cannon-ball, and, for all that I can find, the cursed water has no bottom.  Cross!\" he snarled.  \"Let me see you swim.\"  I was glad enough to be quit of him so soon, but I noticed that, as I stripped and packed my clothes to carry in a bundle on my head, the holy man set his foot in the stirrup of his weapon, and was winding up his arbalest with a windlass, a bolt in his mouth, watching at the same time a heron that rose from a marsh on the further side of the stream.  On this bird, I deemed, he meant to try his skill with the arbalest.  \"Adieu, Brother Thomas,\" I said, as I took the water; and in a few strokes I was across and running up and down on the bank to get myself dry.  \"Back!\" came his grating voice--\"back! and without your clothes, you wine-sack of Scotland, or I shoot!\" and his arbalest was levelled on me.  I have often asked myself since what I should have done, and what was the part of a brave man.  Perchance I might have dived, and swum down-stream under water, but then I had bestowed my bundle of clothes some"]]]
