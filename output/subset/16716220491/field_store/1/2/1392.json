ON THE MORNING OF CHRISTS NATIVITY.   Compos'd 1629.    I    This is the Month, and this the happy morn   Wherin the Son of Heav'ns eternal King,   Of wedded Maid, and Virgin Mother born,   Our great redemption from above did bring;   For so the holy sages once did sing,   That he our deadly forfeit should release,   And with his Father work us a perpetual peace.    II    That glorious Form, that Light unsufferable,   And that far-beaming blaze of Majesty,   Wherwith he wont at Heav'ns high Councel-Table,                      10   To sit the midst of Trinal Unity,   He laid aside; and here with us to be,   Forsook the Courts of everlasting Day,   And chose with us a darksom House of mortal Clay.    III    Say Heav'nly Muse, shall not thy sacred vein   Afford a present to the Infant God?   Hast thou no vers, no hymn, or solemn strein,   To welcom him to this his new abode,   Now while the Heav'n by the Suns team untrod,   Hath took no print of the approching light,                          20   And all the spangled host keep watch in squadrons bright?    IV    See how from far upon the Eastern rode   The Star-led Wisards haste with odours sweet,   O run,  prevent them with thy humble ode,   And lay it lowly at his blessed feet;   Have thou the honour first, thy Lord to greet,   And joyn thy voice unto the Angel Quire,   From out his secret Altar toucht with hallow'd fire.     The Hymn.    I    IT was the Winter wilde,   While the Heav'n-born-childe,                                        30   All meanly wrapt in the rude manger lies;   Nature in aw to him   Had doff't her gawdy trim,   With her great Master so to sympathize:   It was no season then for her   To wanton with the Sun her lusty Paramour.    II    Only with speeches fair   She woo'd the gentle Air   To hide her guilty front with innocent Snow,   And on her naked shame,                                              40   Pollute with sinfull blame,   The Saintly Vail of Maiden white to throw,   Confounded, that her Makers eyes   Should look so near upon her foul deformities.    III    But he her fears to cease,   Sent down the meek-eyd Peace,   She crown'd with Olive green, came softly sliding   Down through the turning sphear   His ready Harbinger,   With Turtle wing the amorous clouds dividing,                        50   And waving wide her mirtle wand,   She strikes a universall Peace through Sea and Land.    IV    No War, or Battails sound   Was heard the World around,   The idle spear and shield were high up hung;   The hooked Chariot stood   Unstain'd with hostile blood,   The Trumpet spake not to the armed throng,   And Kings sate still with awfull eye,   As if they surely knew their sovran Lord was by.                     60    V    But peacefull was the night   Wherin the Prince of light   His raign of peace upon the earth began:   The Windes with wonder whist,   Smoothly the waters kist,   Whispering new joyes to the milde Ocean,   Who now hath quite forgot to rave,   While Birds of Calm sit brooding on the charmed wave.    VI    The Stars with deep amaze   Stand fit in steadfast gaze,                                         70   Bending one way their pretious influence,   And will not take their flight,   For all the morning light,   Or Lucifer that often warned them thence;   But in their glimmering Orbs did glow,   Until their Lord himself bespake, and bid them go.    VII    And though the shady gloom   Had given day her room,   The Sun himself with-held his wonted speed,   And hid his head for shame,                                          80   As his inferior flame,   The new enlightened world no more should need;   He saw a greater Sun appear   Then his bright Throne, or burning Axletree could bear.    VIII    The Shepherds on the Lawn,   Or ere the point of dawn,   Sate simply chatting in a rustic row;   Full little thought they than,   That the mighty Pan   Was kindly com to live with them below;                              90   Perhaps their loves, or els their sheep,   Was all that did their silly thoughts so busie keep.    IX    When such Musick sweet   Their hearts and ears did greet,   As never was by mortal finger strook,   Divinely-warbled voice   Answering the stringed noise,   As all their souls in blisfull rapture took:   The Air such pleasure loth to lose,   With  thousand echo's still prolongs each heav'nly close.           100    X    Nature that heard such  sound   Beneath  the hollow round   of Cynthia's seat the Airy region thrilling,   Now was almost won   To think her part was don   And that her raign had here its last fulfilling;   She knew such harmony alone   Could hold all Heav'n and Earth in happier union.    XI    At last surrounds their sight   A globe of circular light,                                          110   That with long beams the shame faced night arrayed   The helmed Cherubim   And sworded Seraphim,   Are seen in glittering ranks with wings displaid,   Harping in loud and solemn quire,   With unexpressive notes to Heav'ns new-born Heir.    XII    Such Musick (as 'tis said)   Before was never made,   But when of old the sons of morning sung,   While the Creator Great   His constellations set,                                             120   And the well-ballanc't world on hinges hung,   And cast the dark foundations deep,   And bid the weltring waves their oozy channel keep.    XIII    Ring out ye Crystall sphears,   Once bless our human ears,   (If ye have power to touch our senses so)   And let your silver chime   Move in melodious time;   And let the Base of Heav'ns deep Organ blow,                        130   And with your ninefold harmony   Make up full consort to th'Angelike symphony.    XIV    For if such holy Song   Enwrap our fancy long,   Time will run back, and fetch the age of gold,   And speckl'd vanity   Will sicken soon and die,   And leprous sin will melt from earthly mould,   And Hell it self will pass away   And leave her dolorous mansions to the peering day.                 140    XV    Yea Truth, and Justice then   Will down return to men,   Th'enameld Arras of the Rain-bow wearing,   And Mercy set between   Thron'd in Celestiall sheen,   With radiant feet the tissued clouds down stearing,   And Heav'n as at som festivall,   Will open wide the gates of her high Palace Hall.    XVI    But wisest Fate sayes  no,   This must not yet be so,                                            150   The Babe lies yet in smiling Infancy,   That on the bitter cross   Must redeem our loss;   So both himself and us to glorifie:   Yet first to those ychain'd in sleep,   The Wakeful trump of doom must thunder through the deep,    XVII    With such a horrid clang   As on Mount Sinai rang   While the red fire, and smouldring clouds out brake:   The aged Earth agast                                                160   With terrour of that blast,   Shall from the surface to the center shake;   When at the worlds last session,   The dreadfull Judge in middle Air shall spread his throne.    XVIII    And then at last  our bliss   Full and perfect is,   But now begins; for from this happy day   Th'old Dragon under ground   In straiter limits bound,   Not half so far casts his usurped sway,                             170   And wrath to see his Kingdom fail,   Swindges the scaly Horrour of his foulded tail.    XIX    The Oracles are dumm,   No voice or hideous humm   Runs through the arched roof in words deceiving.   Apollo from his shrine   Can no more divine,   With hollow shreik the steep of Delphos leaving.   No nightly trance, or breathed spell,   Inspire's the pale-ey'd Priest from the prophetic cell.             180    XX    The lonely mountains o're,   And the resounding shore,   A voice of weeping heard, and loud lament;   From haunted spring, and dale   Edg'd with poplar pale   The parting Genius is with sighing sent,   With flowre-inwov'n tresses torn   The Nimphs in twilight shade of tangled thickets mourn.    XXI    In consecrated Earth,   And on the holy Hearth,                                             190   The Lars, and Lemures moan with midnight plaint,   In Urns, and Altars round,   A drear, and dying sound   Affrights the Flamins at their service quaint;   And the chill Marble seems to sweat,   While each peculiar power forgoes his wonted seat.    XXII    Peor, and Baalim,   Forsake their Temples dim,   With that twise-batter'd god of Palestine,   And mooned Ashtaroth,            "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17450"],["title","The Part Borne (#1)"],["body","* * * * *  LIST OF BOOKS DISCUSSED OR REFERRED TO IN THE WORK.  * Aa (PIETER VAN DER), Nauwkeurige Versameling der gedenkwaardigste Zee-   en Landreysen na Oost- en West-Indiën, Mitsgaders andere Gewesten   (Leiden, 1707). * S. d.

OCCASION AND OBJECT OF THE PRESENT WORK.  In writing my biography of Tasman, forming part of Messrs. Frederik Muller and Co.'s edition of the Journal of Tasman's celebrated voyage of discovery of 1642-1643, I was time and again struck by the fact that the part borne by the Netherlanders in the discovery of the continent of Australia is very insufficiently known to the Dutch themselves, and altogether misunderstood or even ignored abroad. Not only those who with hypercritical eyes scrutinise, and with more or less scepticism as to its value, analyse whatever evidence on this point is submitted to them, but those others also who feel a profound and sympathetic interest in the historical study of the remarkable voyages which the Netherlanders undertook to the South-land, are almost invariably quite insufficiently informed concerning them. This fact is constantly brought home to the student who consults the more recent works published on the subject, and who fondly hopes to get light from such authors as CALVERT, COLLINGRIDGE, NORDENSKIOLD, RAINAUD and others. Such at least has time after time been my own case. Is it wonderful, therefore, that, while I was engaged in writing Tasman's life, the idea occurred to me of republishing the documents relating to this subject, preserved in the State Archives at the Hague--the repository of the archives of the famous General Dutch Chartered East-India Company extending over two centuries (1602-1800)--and in various other places? I was naturally led to lay before Messrs. Frederik Muller and Co. the question, whether they would eventually undertake such a publication, and I need hardly add that these gentlemen, to whom the historical study of Dutch discovery has repeatedly been so largely indebted, evinced great interest in the plan I submitted to them.[*]  [* See my Life of Tasman, p. 103, note 10.]  Meanwhile the Managing Board of the Royal Geographical Society of the Nether lands had resolved to publish a memorial volume on the occasion of the Society's twenty-fifth anniversary. Among the plans discussed by the Board was the idea of having the documents just referred to published at the expense of the Society. The name of jubilee publication could with complete justice be bestowed on a work having for its object once more to throw the most decided and fullest possible light on achievements of our forefathers in the 17th and 18th century, in a form that would appeal to foreigners no less than to native readers. An act of homage to our ancestors, therefore, a modest one certainly, but one inspired by the same feeling which in 1892 led Italy and the Iberian Peninsula to celebrate the memory of the discoverer of America, and in 1898 prompted the Portuguese to do homage to the navigator who first showed the world the sea-route to India.  {Page ii}  How imperfect and fragmentary even in our days is the information generally available concerning the part borne by the Netherlanders in the discovery of the fifth part of the world, may especially be seen from the works of foreigners. This, I think, must in the first place, though not, indeed, exclusively, be accounted for by the rarity of a working acquaintance with the Dutch tongue among foreign students. On this account the publication of the documents referred to would very imperfectly attain the object in view, unless accompanied by a careful translation of these pieces of evidence into one of the leading languages of Europe; and it stands to reason that in the case of the discovery of Australia the English language would naturally suggest itself as the most fitting medium of information[*]. So much to account for the bilingual character of the jubilee publication now offered to the reader.  [* The English translation is the work of Mr. C. Stoffel, of Nijmegen.]  Closely connected with this consideration is another circumstance which has influenced the mode of treatment followed in the preparation of this work. The defective acquaintance with the Dutch language of those who have made the history of the discovery of Australia the object of serious study, or even, in the case of some of them, their total ignorance of it, certainly appears to me one, nay even the most momentous of the causes of the incomplete knowledge of the subject we are discussing; but it cannot possibly be considered the only cause, if we remember that part of the documentary evidence proving the share of the Netherlanders in the discovery of Australia has already been given to the world through the medium of a leading European tongue.  In 1859 R. H. MAJOR brought out his well-known book _Early Voyages to Terra Australis, now called Australia_, containing translations of some of the archival pieces and of other documents pertaining to the subject. And though, from P. A. LEUPE'S work, entitled _De Reizen der Nederlanders naar het Juidland of Nzeuw-Holland in de 17e en 18e eeuw_, published in 1868, and from a book by L. C. D. Van Dijk, brought out in the same year in which MAJOR'S work appeared, and entitled _Twee togten naar de golf van Carpentaria_; though, I say, from these two books it became evident that MAJOR'S work was far from complete, still it cannot be denied that he had given a great deal, and what he had given, had in the English translation been made accessible also to those to whom Dutch was an unknown tongue. This circumstance could not but make itself felt in my treatment of the subject, since it was quite needless to print once more in their entirety various documents discussed by MAJOR. There was the less need for such republication in cases which would admit of the results of Dutch exploratory voyages being exhibited in the simplest and most effective way by the reproduction of charts made in the course of such voyages themselves: these charts sometimes speak more clearly to the reader than the circumstantial journals which usually, though not always, are of interest for our purpose only by specifying the"]]]
