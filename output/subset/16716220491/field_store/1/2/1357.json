Nothing could offer more striking contrasts than the country on either bank. On the east, the ground rises abruptly to a height of about 3000 feet, resembling a natural rampart flanked with towers and bastions: behind this extends an immense table-land, slightly undulating and intersected in all directions by the affluents of the Jordan and the Dead Sea--the Yarmuk,* the Jabbok,** and the Arnon.***       * The Yarmuk does not occur in the Bible, but we meet with      its name in the Talmud, and the Greeks adopted it under the      form Hieromax.       ** _Gen._ xxxii. 22; Numb, xxi. 24.

[Shephelah = low country, plain (Josh. xi. 16).      With the article it means the plain along the Mediterranean      from Joppa to Gaza.--Te.]  The whole of this district forms a little world in itself, whose inhabitants, half shepherds, half bandits, live a life of isolation, with no ambition to take part in general history. West of the Jordan, a confused mass of hills rises into sight, their sparsely covered slopes affording an impoverished soil for the cultivation of corn, vines, and olives. One ridge--Mount Carmel--detached from the principal chain near the southern end of the Lake of Genesareth, runs obliquely to the north-west, and finally projects into the sea. North of this range extends Galilee, abounding in refreshing streams and fertile fields; while to the south, the country falls naturally into three parallel zones--the littoral, composed alternately of dunes and marshes--an expanse of plain, a Shephelah, dotted about with woods and watered by intermittent rivers,--and finally the mountains. The region of dunes is not necessarily barren, and the towns situated in it--Gaza, Jaffa, Ashdod, and Ascalon--are surrounded by flourishing orchards and gardens. The plain yields plentiful harvests every year, the ground needing no manure and very little labour. The higher ground and the hill-tops are sometimes covered with verdure, but as they advance southwards, they become denuded and burnt by the sun. The valleys, too, are watered only by springs, which are dried up for the most part during the summer, and the soil, parched by the continuous heat, can scarcely be distinguished from the desert. In fact, till the Sinaitic Peninsula and the frontiers of Egypt are reached, the eye merely encounters desolate and almost uninhabited solitudes, devastated by winter torrents, and overshadowed by the volcanic summits of Mount Seir. The spring rains, however, cause an early crop of vegetation to spring up, which for a few weeks furnishes the flocks of the nomad tribes with food.  We may summarise the physical characteristics of Syria by saying that Nature has divided the country into five or six regions of unequal area, isolated by rivers and mountains, each one of which, however, is admirably suited to become the seat of a separate independent state. In the north, we have the country of the two rivers--the Naharaim--extending from the Orontes to the Euphrates and the Balikh, or even as far as the Khabur:* in the centre, between the two ranges of the Lebanon, lie Coele-Syria and its two unequal neighbours, Aram of Damascus and Phoenicia; while to the south is the varied collection of provinces bordering the valley of the Jordan.       * The Naharaim of the Egyptians was first identified with      Mesopotamia; it was located between the Orontes and the      Balikh or the Euphrates by Maspero. This opinion is now      adopted by the majority of Egyptologists, with slight      differences in detail. Ed. Meyer has accurately compared the      Egyptian Naharaim with the Parapotamia of the administration      of the Seleucidæ.  It is impossible at the present day to assert, with any approach to accuracy, what peoples inhabited these different regions towards the fourth millennium before our era. Wherever excavations are made, relics are brought to light of a very ancient semi-civilization, in which we find stone weapons and implements, besides pottery, often elegant in contour, but for the most part coarse in texture and execution. These remains, however, are not accompanied by any monument of definite characteristics, and they yield no information with regard to the origin or affinities of the tribes who fashioned them.* The study of the geographical nomenclature in use about the XVIth century B.C. reveals the existence, at all events at that period, of several peoples and several languages. The mountains, rivers, towns, and fortresses in Palestine and Coele-Syria are designated by words of Semitic origin: it is easy to detect, even in the hieroglyphic disguise which they bear on the Egyptian geographical lists, names familiar to us in Hebrew or Assyrian.       * Researches with regard to the primitive inhabitants of      Syria and their remains have not as yet been prosecuted to      any extent. The caves noticed by Hedenborg at Ant-Elias,      near Tripoli, and by Botta at Nahr el-Kelb, and at Adlun by      the Duc de Luynes, have been successively explored by      Lartet, Tristram, Lortet, and Dawson. The grottoes of      Palestine proper, at Bethzur, at Gilgal near Jericho, and at      Tibneh, have been the subject of keen controversy ever since      their discovery. The Abbé Richard desired to identify the      flints of Gilgal and Tibneh with the stone knives used by      Joshua for the circumcision of the Israelites after the      passage of the Jordan (_Josh._ v- 2-9), some of which might      have been buried in that heros tomb.  But once across the Orontes, other forms present themselves which reveal no affinities to these languages, but are apparently connected with one or other of the dialects of Asia Minor.* The tenacity with which the place-names, once given, cling to the soil, leads us to believe that a certain number at least of those we know in Syria were in use there long before they were noted down by the Egyptians, and that they must have been heirlooms from very early peoples. As they take a Semitic or non-Semitic form according to their geographical position, we may conclude that the centre and south were colonized by Semites, and the north by the immigrant tribes from beyond the Taurus. Facts are not wanting to support this conclusion, and they prove that it is not so entirely arbitrary as we might be inclined to believe. The Asiatic visitors who, under a king of the XIIth dynasty, came to offer gifts to Khnûmhotpû, the Lord of Beni-Hasan, are completely Semitic in type, and closely resemble the Bedouins of the present day. Their chief--Abisha--bears a Semitic name,** as too does the Sheikh Ammianshi, with whom Sinûhit took refuge.***       * The non-Semitic origin of the names of a number of towns      in Northern Syria preserved in the Egyptian lists, is      admitted by the majority of scholars who have studied the      question.       ** His name has been shown to be cognate with the Hebrew      Abishai (1 Sam. xxvi. 6-9; 2 Sam. ii. 18, 24; xxi. 17) and      with the Chaldæo-Assyrian Abeshukh.       *** The name Ammianshi at once recalls those of Ammisatana,      Ammiza-dugga, and perhaps Ammurabi, or Khammurabi, of one of      the Babylonian dynasties; it contains, with the element      Ammi, a final _anshi_. Chabas connects it with two Hebrew      words _Am-nesh_, which he does not translate.  Ammianshi himself reigned over the province of Kadimâ, a word which in Semitic denotes the East. Finally, the only one of their gods known to us, Hadad, was a Semite deity, who presided over the atmosphere, and whom we find later on ruling over the destinies of Damascus. Peoples of Semitic speech and religion must, indeed, have already occupied the greater part of that region on the shores of the Mediterranean which we find still in their possession many centuries later, at the time of the Egyptian conquest.

When, however, the lords of the sands grew too insolent, the Pharaoh sent a column of light troops against them, and inflicted on them such a severe punishment, that the remembrance of it kept them within bounds for years. Offenders banished from Egypt sought refuge with the turbulent kinglets, who were in a perpetual state of unrest between Sinai and the Dead Sea. Egyptian sailors used to set out to traffic along the seaboard, taking to piracy when hard pressed; Egyptian merchants were accustomed to penetrate by easy stages into the interior. The accounts they gave of their journeys were not reassuring. The traveller had first to face the solitudes which confronted him before reaching the Isthmus, and then to avoid as best he might the attacks of the pillaging tribes who inhabited it.

Chabas was inclined to read Ûtena, and Brugsch, Ûthent, more      correctly Utanâtiû, utanâti, the people of Uatanit. The      juxtaposition of this name with that of the Libyans compels      us to look towards the west for the site of this people: may      we assign to them the Ionian Islands, or even those in the      western Mediterranean.  The poem became celebrated. When Seti I., two centuries later, commanded the Poet Laureates of his court to celebrate his victories in verse, the latter, despairing of producing anything better, borrowed the finest strophes from this hymn to Thûtmosis IIL, merely changing the name of the hero. The composition, unlike so many other triumphal inscriptions, is not a mere piece of official rhetoric, in which the poverty of the subject is concealed by a multitude of common-places whether historical or mythological. Egypt indeed ruled the world, either directly or through her vassals, and from the mountains of Abyssinia to those of Cilicia her armies held the nations in awe with the threat of the Pharaoh.  The conqueror, as a rule, did not retain any part of their territory. He confined himself to the appropriation of the revenue of certain domains for the benefit of his gods.* Amon of Karnak thus became possessor of seven Syrian towns which he owed to the generosity of the victorious Pharaohs.**       * The seven towns which Amon possessed in Syria are      mentioned, in the time of Ramses III., in the list of the      domains and revenues of the god.       ** In the year XXIII., on his return from his first      campaign, Thûtmosis III. provided offerings, guaranteed from      the three towns Anaûgasa, Inûâmû, and Hûrnikarû, for his      father Amonrâ.  Certain cities, like Tunipa, even begged for statues of Thûtmosis for which they built a temple and instituted a cultus. Amon and his fellow-gods too were adored there, side by side with the sovereign the inhabitants had chosen to represent them here below.* These rites were at once a sign of servitude, and a proof of gratitude for services rendered, or privileges which had been confirmed. The princes of neighbouring regions repaired annually to these temples to renew their oaths of allegiance, and to bring their tributes before the face of the king. Taking everything into account, the condition of the Pharaohs subjects might have been a pleasant one, had they been able to accept their lot without any mental reservation. They retained their own laws, their dynasties, and their frontiers, and paid a tax only in proportion to their resources, while the hostages given were answerable for their obedience. These hostages were as a rule taken by Thûtmosis from among the sons or the brothers of the enemys chief. They were carried to Thebes, where a suitable establishment was assigned to them,** the younger members receiving an education which practically made them Egyptians.       * The statues of Thûtmosis III. and of the gods of Egypt      erected at Tunipa are mentioned in a letter from the      inhabitants of that town to Amenôthes III. Later, Ramses      II., speaking of the two towns in the country of the Khâti      in which were two statues of His Majesty, mentions Tunipa as      one of them.       ** The various titles of the lists of Thûtmosis III. at      Thebes show us the children of the Syrian chiefs conducted      as prisoners into the town of Sûhanû, which is elsewhere      mentioned as the depot, the prison of the temple of Anion.      W. Max Mullcr was the first to remark the historical value      of this indication, but without sufficiently insisting on      it; the name indicates, perhaps, as he says, a great prison,      but a prison like those where the princes of the family of      the Ottoman sultans were confined by the reigning monarch--      a palace usually provided with all the comforts of Oriental      life.  As soon as a vacancy occurred in the succession either in Syria or in Ethiopia, the Pharaoh would choose from among the members of the family whom he held in reserve, that prince on whose loyalty he could best count, and placed him upon the throne.* The method of procedure was not always successful, since these princes, whom one would have supposed from their training to have been the least likely to have asserted themselves against the man to whom they owed their elevation, often gave more trouble than others. The sense of the supreme power of Egypt, which had been inculcated in them during their exile, seemed to be weakened after their return to their native country, and to give place to a sense of their own importance. Their hearts misgave them as the time approached for them to send their own children as pledges to their suzerain, and also when called upon to transfer a considerable part of their revenue to his treasury. They found, moreover, among their own cities and kinsfolk, those who were adverse to the foreign yoke, and secretly urged their countrymen to revolt, or else competitors for the throne who took advantage of the popular discontent to pose as champions of national independence, and it was difficult for the vassal prince to counteract the intrigues of these adversaries without openly declaring himself hostile to his foreign master.**       * Among the Tel el-Amarna tablets there is a letter of a      petty Syrian king, Adadnirari, whose father was enthroned      after a fashion in Nûkhassi by Thûtmosis III.       ** Thus, in the Tel el-Amarna correspondence, Zimrida,      governor of Sidon, gives information to Amenôthes III. on      the intrigues which the notables of the town were concocting      against Egyptian authority. Ribaddû relates in one of these      despatches that the notables of Byblos and the women of his      harem were urging him to revolt; later, a letter of Amûnirâ      to the King of Egypt informs us that Ribaddû had been driven      from Byblos by his own brother.  A time quickly came when a vestige of fear alone constrained them to conceal their wish for liberty; the most trivial incident then sufficed to give them the necessary encouragement, and decided them to throw off the mask, a repulse or the report of a repulse suffered by the Egyptians, the news of a popular rising in some neighbouring state, the passing visit of a Chaldæan emissary who left behind him the hope of support and perhaps of subsidies from Babylon, and the unexpected arrival of a troop of mercenaries whose services might be hired for the occasion.* A rising of this sort usually brought about the most disastrous results. The native prince or the town itself could keep back the tribute and own allegiance to no one during the few months required to convince Pharaoh of their defection and to allow him to prepare the necessary means of vengeance; the advent of the Egyptians followed, and the work of repression was systematically set in hand. They destroyed the harvests, whether green or ready for the sickle, they cut down the palms and olive trees, they tore up the vines, seized on the flocks, dismantled the strongholds, and took the inhabitants prisoners.**       * Bûrnabûriash, King of Babylon, speaks of Syrian agents who      had come to ask for support from his father, Kûrigalzû, and      adds that the latter had counselled submission. In one of      the letters preserved in the British Museum, Azîrû defends      himself for having received an emissary of the King of the      Khâti.       ** Cf. the raiding, for instance, of the regions of Arvad      and of the Zahi by Thûtmosis III., described in the Annals,      11. 4, 5. We are still in possession of the threats which      the messenger Khâni made against the rebellious chief of a      province of the Zahi--possibly Aziru.  The rebellious prince had to deliver up his silver and gold, the contents of his palace, even his children,* and when he had finally obtained peace by means of endless sacrifices, he found himself a vassal as before, but with an empty treasury, a wasted country, and a decimated people.       * See, in the accounts of the campaigns of Thûtmosis, the      record of the spoils, as well as the mention of the children      of the chiefs brought as prisoners into Egypt.
