RULES OF CONDUCT FOR CAMP LIFE   The first few days will be easy and profitable if you will read carefully and adhere to the following plan of procedure:      1. Get up at the first note of reveille and get quickly into proper     uniform.      2. Get within two or three feet of your place in ranks and await the     sounding of assembly for reveille and then step into ranks.      3. Stand at attention after the first sergeant commands \"Fall In.\"     Remember that this command is equivalent to \"Company, Attention.\"      4. After reveille, make up your bed, arrange neatly your equipment,     and clean up the ground under and around your cot. The company     commander will require the beds made up and the equipment arranged     in a prescribed way.      5. Wash for breakfast.      6. Upon returning from breakfast, go at once to the toilet. Next,     prepare the equipment prescribed to be worn to drill. This is     especially important when the full pack is prescribed. Assist your     tent mates in policing the ground in and around your tent.      7. If you need medical attention give your name to the first     sergeant at reveille and report to him at his tent upon your return     from breakfast. Don't wait until you are sick to report to the     hospital, but go as soon as you feel in the least unwell.      8. When the first call for drill is blown, put on your equipment,     inspect your bed and property to see that everything is in order,     and then go to your place in ranks.      9. After the morning drill, get ready for dinner. Get a little rest     at this time if possible.      10. After dinner a short rest is usually allowed before the     afternoon drill. Take advantage of this opportunity; get off your     feet and rest. Be quiet so that your tent mates may rest.      11. Following the afternoon drill there is a short intermission     before the ceremony of retreat. During this time take a quick bath,     shave, get into the proper uniform for retreat, shine your shoes and     brush your clothes and hat. Be the neatest man in the company.      12. Supper usually follows retreat.      13. After supper, you usually have some spare time until taps. The     Y. M. C. A. generally provides a place supplied with Bibles,     newspapers, good magazines, and writing material. Don't be ashamed     to read the Bible. Don't forget to write to the folks back home.      14. Be in bed with lights out at taps. After taps and before     reveille, remain silent, thus showing consideration for those who     are sleeping or trying to sleep.      15. Consult the company bulletin board at least twice daily. On this     bulletin board is usually found the following information:          (a) A list of calls.         (b) The proper uniform for each formation.         (c) Schedule of drills.         (d) Special orders and instructions.      16. Get all your orders from (a) the bulletin board, (b) the first     sergeant, (c) the acting noncommissioned officers, (d) the company     commander. Don't put much faith in rumors.    ADVICE REGARDING HABITS   Your life in camp in regard to food, exercise, hours of sleep, surroundings, and comforts, will differ greatly from that you lead as a civilian. You will submit your body to a sudden, severe, physical test. In order to prepare your body for this change in manner of living and work, we recommend that for a short time prior to your arrival in camp, and thereafter, you observe the following suggestions:       1. Use no alcohol of any kind.       2. Stop smoking, or at least be temperate in the use of tobacco.       3. Eat and drink moderately. Chew your food well. It is advisable,      however, to drink a great deal of cool (not cold) water between      meals.       4. Don't eat between meals.       5. Accustom yourself to regular hours as to sleeping, eating, and      the morning functions.       6. Keep away from all soda fountains and soft drink stands.       7. For at least two weeks prior to your arrival at camp, take      regularly the exercises described in this book.  Most men are troubled with their feet during the first week of each camp, usually because they do not observe the following precautions:       1. If you have ever had trouble with the arches of your feet, wear         braces for them.       2. Lace your shoe as tightly as comfort will permit.       3. Wash the feet daily.       4. Every morning shake a little talcum powder or \"Foot Ease\" in         each shoe.       5. Each morning put on a fresh pair of socks. Your socks should fit         the feet so neatly that no wrinkles remain in them and yet not be         so tight that they bind the foot. Do not wear a sock with a hole in         it or one that has been darned.       6. Some men cannot wear light wool socks with comfort. Do not wear         silk or cotton socks until you have given light wool socks a fair         trial.       7. In case of a blister, treat it as directed in Chapter X.       8. Most of the foot troubles are caused by wearing shoes that do         not fit properly. If the shoe is too large it rubs blisters, if too         small it cramps the foot and causes severe pain. Marching several         hours while carrying about thirty pounds of equipment causes each         foot to expand at least one half a size in length and         correspondingly in breadth; hence the size of the shoe you wear in         the office will be too small for training camp use. If you have         been living a sedentary life, ask for a pair of shoes larger than         you ordinarily wear.       9. In case the tendon in your heel becomes tender, report at once         to the hospital tent and get it strapped.    A DISCIPLINED SOLDIER   You will be expected to become quickly amenable both mentally and physically to discipline. A clear conception on your part of what drills are disciplinary in character and what discipline really is, will help you to become a disciplined soldier. Drills executed at attention are disciplinary exercises and are designed to teach precise and soldierly movements and to inculcate that prompt and subconscious obedience which is essential to proper military control. Hence, all corrections should be given and received in an impersonal manner. Never forget that you lose your identity as an individual when you step into ranks; you then become merely a unit of a mass. As soon as you obey properly, promptly, and, at times, unconsciously, the commands of your officers, as soon as you can cheerfully give up pleasures and personal privileges that conflict with the new order of life to which you have submitted, you will then have become a disciplined man.    DRESS   The uniform you will wear stands for Duty, Honor, and Country. You should not disgrace it by the way you wear it or by your conduct any more than you would trample the flag of the United States of America under foot. You must constantly bear in mind that in our country a military organization is too often judged by the acts of a few of its members. When one or two soldiers in uniform conduct themselves in an ungentlemanly or unmilitary manner to the disgrace of the uniform, the layman shakes his head and condemns all men wearing that uniform. Hence, show by the way in which you wear your uniform that you are proud of it; this can be best accomplished by observing the following rules:       1. Carry yourself at all times as though you were proud of         yourself, your uniform, and your country.       2. Wear your hat so that the brim is parallel to the ground.       3. Have all buttons fastened.       4. Never have sleeves rolled up.       5. Never wear sleeve holders.       6. Never leave shirt or coat unbuttoned at the throat.       7. Have leggins and trousers properly laced.       8. Keep shoes shined.       9. Always be clean shaved.      10. Keep head up and shoulders square.      11. Camp life has a tendency to make one careless as to personal         cleanliness. Bear this in mind.    SALUTING   The military salute is universal. It is at foundation but a courteous recognition between two individuals of their common fellowship in the same honorable profession, the profession of arms. Regulations require that it be rendered by both the senior and the junior, as bare courtesy requires between gentlemen in civil life. It is the military equivalent of the laymen's expressions \"Good Morning,\" or \"How do you do?\" Therefore be punctilious about saluting; be proud of the manner in which you execute your salute, and make it indicative of discipline and good breeding. Always look at the officer you are saluting. The junior salutes first. It is very unmilitary to salute with the left hand in a pocket, or with a cigarette, cigar, or pipe in the mouth. Observe the following general rules:       1. Never salute an officer when you are in ranks.       2. Indoors (in your tent) unarmed, do not salute but stand at         attention, uncovered, on the entrance of an officer. If he speaks         to you, then salute.       3. Indoors, armed, render the prescribed salute, i.e., the rifle         salute at order arms or at trail.       4. Outdoors, armed, render the prescribed salute, i.e., the rifle         salute at right shoulder arms.       5. Outdoors, unarmed, or armed with side arms, salute with the         right hand.    ARMY SLANG   The following army slang is universally employed:       \"Bunkie\"--the soldier who shares the shelter half or tent of a      comrade in the field. A bunkie looks after his comrade's property      in the event the latter is absent.       \"Doughboy\"--the infantryman.       \"French leave\"--unauthorized absence.       \"Holy Joe\"--the chaplain.       \"K.O.\"--the commanding officer.       \"On the carpet\"--a call before the commanding officer for      admonition.       \"Q.M.\"--quartermaster.       \"Rookie\"--a new recruit.       \"Sand rat\"--a soldier on duty in the rifle pit during target      practice.   "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19552"],["title","The Plattsburg Manual: A Handbook for Military Training (#2)"],["body","    \"Top sergeant\"--the first sergeant.       \"Come and get it\"--the meal is ready to be served.    HOW TO CLEAN A RIFLE AND BAYONET   Get a rag and rub the heavy grease off; then get a soft pine stick, pointed at one end, and with this point remove the grease from the cracks, crevices and corners. Clean the bore from the breech. When the heavy grease has been removed, the metal part of the gun, bore included, should be covered with a light coating of \"3-in-1\" oil. Heavy grease can be removed from the rifle by rubbing it with a rag which has been saturated with gasoline or coal oil.    FRIENDS   There are a few men in all companies who play, loaf, and who are constantly in trouble. As the good men in each company will not become friendly with them, they seek their acquaintances among the new men on whom they have a baneful influence. We wish to warn you about making friends too quickly.    FINAL SUGGESTIONS   Don't be profane or tell questionable stories to your bunkies or around the company. There is a much greater number of silent and unprotesting men in camp than is generally supposed, to whom this is offensive. Keep everything on a high plane.     CHAPTER II[1]  Read this chapter as soon as you decide to attend a Camp.    PHYSICAL EXERCISE   The greatest problem you will have to solve will be that of making your body do the work required. Every one else will be doing exactly what you are doing, and you have too much pride to want to take even a shorter step than the man by your side. Some men have to leave the training camps because they are not in the proper physical condition to go on with the work. If this chapter is taken as seriously as it should be, it will be of great help to you.  If you have not a pair of sensible marching shoes (tan, high-tops, no hooks on them) get a pair. These shoes should be considerably larger than a pair of office shoes.  Walk to and from your business. Take every opportunity to get out in the country where the air is pure. Fill your lungs full. Get into the habit of taking deep breaths now and then. Don't make this a task, but surround it with pleasantries. Get some delightful companion to walk with you. Walk vigorously.  Let down on your smoking. Better to leave it alone for a while. You will enjoy the air. Deep breathing seems to be more natural.  Make it a work for your country. View it in that light. If you are not going to be called upon to undergo the cruel hardships and physical strain of some campaigns, your son will be, and you can be of great help to him by being fit yourself. You and your sons will form the backbone of America's strength in her next peril.  You will have a great deal of walking after you arrive in camp, possibly a great deal more than you have ever had, and probably a great deal more than you expect, even with this word of warning. If you have failed to provide yourself with proper shoes and socks, great will be the price of your lack of forethought. You will wince at your own blisters. You will get no sympathy from any one else. It is the spirit of the camp for each man to bear his own burdens. So arrive at camp with hardened legs and broken in shoes. Don't buy shoes with pointed or narrow toes. They should be broad and airy.  Immediately after you arise in the morning and just before you retire at night, go through the following exercises for two or three minutes. In a short time you may want to make it more. No objection. Give it a fair trial. Be brisk and energetic. Forget, for the time being, what you are going to get out of it. Give and then give more. The result will take care of itself.   1st Exercise  Involving practically every important muscle in the body.  [Illustration: No. 1 No. 2]  From first position spring to second position; instantly return to first position and continue.  Be light on your feet. Alight on your toes. Begin with a limited number of times. Day by day increase it a little until you reach a fair number. Be most moderate at first. Never allow yourself in any exercise to become greatly fatigued.   2d Exercise  To reduce waist, strengthen back muscles, and become limber.  [Illustration: No. 1 No. 2]  Assume position No. 1.  Swing to position (No. 2), return at once to No. 1, and continue.  Shoot your head and arms as far through your legs as your conformation permits.   3rd Exercise  To harden leg muscles and exercise joints.  [Illustration: No. 1 No. 2]  From position No. 1 come to position No. 2. Return at once to No. 1 and continue.  Toes turned well out. Body and head erect. Up with a slight spring. After a little practice, you will have no difficulty with this exercise in balancing yourself.   4th Exercise  To exercise arms and shoulders and organs of chest and shoulder muscles.  [Illustration: No. 1]  From position No. 1 thrust arms forward to position No. 2, and return at once to position No. 1.  [Illustration: No. 2]  Vary by thrusting arms downward, sideward and upward. Be moderate at first. Grow more vigorous with practice.   5th Exercise  [Illustration: No. 1]  To strengthen ankles and insteps.  From position No. 1 rise on the toes to position No. 2, return at once to position No. 1, and continue.  Go up on your toes as high as you can.  [Illustration: No. 2]     CHAPTER III  SCHOOL OF THE SOLDIER  Based on the Infantry Drill Regulations    Success in battle is the ultimate object of all military training; hence the excellence of an organization is judged by its field efficiency. Your instruction will be progressive in character, and will have as its ultimate purpose the creation of a company measuring up to a high standard of field efficiency.  The Preparatory Command, such as Forward, indicates the movement that is to be executed.  The Command of Execution, such as MARCH, HALT, or ARMS, commences the execution of the movement.  Preparatory Commands are distinguished by bold face, those of execution by capitals. As, 1. Forward, 2. MARCH.  The average man understands better and learns faster when you show him how a thing is done. Don't be content with telling him how. Bear this in mind when you become an instructor.  On account of the absence of the Regular Army on the border, it was not practical to obtain photographs of regular troops with which to illustrate this book. The photographs used were taken under the direct supervision of the authors.    POSITION OF A SOLDIER AT ATTENTION   [Illustration: No. 1 No. 2 CORRECT POSITION]  No. 1. Eyes to the front. Hands hang naturally. Rest weight of the body equally on feet. Feet turned out making angles of 45°.  No. 2. Head erect. Shoulders down and back. Chest out. Stomach up. Thumb along the seams of trousers. Knees straight, not stiff. Heels on line and together. Do not stiffen the fingers: The mind ought also to be at attention.  [Illustration: No. 1 No. 2 INCORRECT POSITIONS]  No. 1. Don't gaze about. That's not playing the game. Don't turn your feet out making an angle of 100°.  No. 2. Don't slouch. Hold yourself up. Keep your eyes off the ground.  These are the common errors of beginners.   1. Parade, 2. REST.  [Illustration: No. 1 No. 2 CORRECT POSITION]  No. 1. Clasp hands without constraint in front of center of body. Left hand uppermost. Fingers joined. Thumb and fore finger right hand clasps the left thumb.  No. 2. Bend left knee slightly. Right foot is carried 6 inches straight to the rear.  [Illustration: No. 1 No. 2 INCORRECT POSITIONS]  No. 1. Not looking straight to the front. Right foot not carried straight to the rear.  No. 2. Leaning back too far. Right foot carried back too far.   1. Hand, 2. SALUTE.  [Illustration: No. 1 No. 2 CORRECT POSITION]  No. 1. Look toward the person saluted.  No. 2. Tip of forefinger right hand touches cap or hat above right eye. Thumb and forefingers extended and joined. Hand and wrist straight. Palm to the left.  [Illustration: No. 1 No. 2 No. 3 INCORRECT POSITIONS OR COMMON ERRORS]  No. 1. Palm of the hand to the front and fingers not joined.  No. 2. Arm held too high. Fingers not perfectly joined.  No. 3. Fingers not extended and joined. Left hand not by side while salute is being made.  Some beginners forget, while saluting, to remove their pipes, cigarettes, or cigars from their mouths. This proves clearly that they are beginners, for trained and experienced men are careful about military honors and salutes.    THE RESTS   Being at a halt, the commands are: FALL OUT; REST; AT EASE; and 1. Parade, 2. REST.  At the command fall out, the men may leave the ranks, but are required to remain in the immediate vicinity. They resume their former places, at attention, at the command fall in.  At the command rest, each man keeps one foot in place, but is not required to preserve silence or immobility.  At the command at ease, each man keeps one foot in place and is required to preserve silence, but not immobility.   1. Parade, 2. REST. Previously explained.  To resume the attention: 1. Squad, 2. ATTENTION. The men take the position of the soldier.    EYES RIGHT OR LEFT   1. Eyes, 2. RIGHT (LEFT), 3. FRONT.  [Illustration]  At the command right, turn the head to the right oblique, eyes fixed on the line of eyes of the men in, or supposed to be in, the same rank. At the command front, turn the head and eyes to the front. Notice the right file does not turn the eyes to the right.    FACINGS   To the flank: 1. Right (left), 2. FACE.  [Illustration]  Raise slightly the left heel and right toe; face to the right, turning on the right heel, assisted by a slight pressure on the ball of the left foot; place the left foot by the side of the right. Left face is executed on the left heel in the corresponding manner.  Right (left) Half Face is executed similarly, facing 45°.  To the rear: 1. About, 2. FACE.  Carry the toe of the right foot about a half foot-length to the rear and slightly to the left of the left heel without changing the position of the left foot; face to the rear, turning to the right on the left heel and right"]]]
