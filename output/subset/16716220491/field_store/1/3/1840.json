Let us bring our blossoms, too,       All our gardens grow;     Lilacs honey-sweet with dew,       And the lilies' snow.      Every posy of the May,       Every bloomy stem,     Every bud that breaks to-day       Gather now for them.      Lay the lilies o'er them thus,       Lovingly, for so     Down they laid their lives for us,       Long and long ago.      Heap above them bud and bough;       Softly, ere we cease,     God, we pray Thee, gently now       Fold them in Thy peace!     CHU-CHU CARS       Turn the chairs down in a row     Each behind the other, so;     _Chu-chu! Chu-chu!_ there they are,     Passenger and baggage-car,     _Chu-chu-chu!_ the Morris chair     Is the engine puffing there,     _Chu-chu! Chu-chu! Ting-a-ling!_     Don't you hear its big bell ring?     All aboard! Jump on! if you     Want to take this train. _Chu-chu!!_     Off we start now, rushing fast     Through the fields and valleys, past     Noisy cities, over bridges,     Hills and plains and mountain ridges,     _Chu-chu! Chu-chu! Chu-chu-chu!!_     At such speed it must be true     Since we started we have come     Most a million miles from home!     Jump off, some one! Quick! and go     To the pantry, for, you know,     We must have the cookie-jar     For our Pullman dining-car!     FAIRY RINGS       Softly in the gloaming       Flitting through the vale,     Fairy folk are roaming       Over hill and dale.      Pixies in the hollow,       Elves upon the height,     Let us follow, follow       Through the paling light.      Follow, all unbidden,       To the grassy glade     Wrapped around and hidden       In the forest shade.      Hark the elfin tinkle       Of their little lutes!     Mark the golden twinkle       Of their fairy flutes!  [Illustration: FAIRY RINGS]      See them dancing, dancing,       While the silver moon     Tips their swiftly glancing       Little silver shoon!      Tripping, tripping lightly,       Where their footprints fall,     Look! the grass is brightly       Growing green and tall!      Springing close, unbroken,       In a fairy ring,     For to-morrow's token       Of their frolicking!     THE FIREFLY       Flash and flicker and fly away,       Trailing light as you flutter far,     Are you a lamp for the fairies, say?       Or a flake of fire from a falling star?     A RAIN SONG                 Tinkle, tinkle,                 Lightly fall       On the peach buds, pink and small;     Tip the tiny grass, and twinkle       On the clover, green and tall.                Tinkle, tinkle,--                 Faster now,       Little rain-drops, smite and sprinkle     Cherry-bloom and apple-bough!     Pelt the elms, and show them how               You can dash!                 And splash! splash! splash!     While the thunder rolls and mutters,       And the lightnings flash and flash!               Then eddy into curls               Of a million misty swirls,     And thread the air with silver, and embroider it with pearls!      And patter, patter, patter     To a quicker time, and clatter       On the streaming window-pane;               Rain, rain,                 On the leaves,                   And the eaves,       And the turning weather-vane!      Rush in torrents from the tip     Of the gable-peak, and drip       In the garden-bed, and fill         All the cuckoo-cups, and pour               More and more       In the tulip-bowls, and still                 Overspill       In a crystal tide until       Every yellow daffodil     Is flooded to its golden rim, and brimming o'er and o'er!      Then as gently as the low       Muffled whir of robin wings,       Or a sweep of silver strings,                 Even so,         Take your airy April flight         Through the merry April light,     And melt into a mist of rainy music as you go!     FAIRIES       Grandfather says that sometimes,       When stars are twinkling and     A new moon shines, there come times       When folks see fairy-land!      So when there's next a new moon,       I mean to watch all night!     Grandfather says a blue moon       Is best for fairy light,      And in a peach-bloom, maybe,       If I look I shall see     A little fairy baby       No bigger than a bee!     THE LITTLE FIR-TREES       Hey! little evergreens,       Sturdy and strong!     Summer and autumn time       Hasten along;     Harvest the sunbeams, then,       Bind them in sheaves,     Range them, and change them       To tufts of green leaves.     Delve in the mellow mold,       Far, far below,             And so,       Little evergreens, grow!             Grow, grow!     Grow, little evergreens, grow!      Up, up so airily       To the blue sky,     Lift up your leafy tips       Stately and high;     Clasp tight your tiny cones,       Tawny and brown;     By and by, buffeting       Rains will pelt down;     By and by, bitterly       Chill winds will blow;             And so,       Little evergreens, grow!             Grow, grow!     Grow, little evergreens, grow!      Gather all uttermost       Beauty, because,--     Hark, till I tell it now!       How Santa Claus,     Out of the northern land,       Over the seas,     Soon shall come seeking you,       Evergreen trees!     Seek you with reindeer soon,       Over the snow;             And so,       Little evergreens, grow!             Grow, grow!     Grow, little evergreens, grow!      What if the maples flare       Flaunting and red,     You shall wear waxen white       Tapers instead!     What if now, otherwhere,       Birds are beguiled,     You shall yet nestle       The little Christ-child!     Ah! the strange splendor       The fir-trees shall know!             And so,       Little evergreens, grow!             Grow, grow!     Grow, little evergreens, grow!     THE WREN-HOUSE       Yesterday I took my saw       And some bits of wood,     And I made a little house       Nicely as I could.      I put on a mossy-green       Little pointed roof,     And I cut a tiny door       That is pussy-proof.      For I hope some little wrens       To our yard will come     And will choose my little house       For their little home.      I shall hang it in the boughs       Of the apple-tree,     And I'm sure as rent for it       They will sing to me!     THE BABY'S RIDE       Chee! Chee! Chickadee!       Sing-time and sun!     Aye, aye, baby-bye,       Springtime has begun!         *       *       *       *       *      In the little willow cart,       On a downy bed,     Pretty parasol of silk       Swinging overhead,      Let us go along the lane       Where a baby sees     Mighty tufts of grass, and weeds       Tall as forest trees!      Bluebird on the apple-bough,       Sing and sing and sing!     Sing your very sweetest now       For babyhood and spring!         *       *       *       *       *      \"Bah! Bah!\" from the pasture,       And \"Caw! Caw!\" from the crow,     And bleating from the little calf       That has not learned to low.         *       *       *       *       *      Apple-buds, apple-buds breaking apart,       The baby looks upward with love-laden gaze;     Oh, shower some petals down here in his cart,       One honey-sweet cluster of pretty pink sprays!      Apple-buds, apple-buds, scornful and too       Vain of your loveliness, stay where you are!     The cheeks of the baby are pinker than you,       And finer and softer and sweeter by far!         *       *       *       *       *      See the pretty little lambs,       How they frisk and play!     See their silky fleeces shine       White as buds in May!      White as are the fleecy clouds       Softly blowing by--     What if they were little lambs       Playing in the sky?         *       *       *       *       *      Robin on the peach-bough,       Swinging overhead,     Sing a little song and say       Why is your breast so red?      Why is your voice so sweet, and       Your song so merry, say?     And wherefore do you spread your wings       And quickly fly away?         *       *       *       *       *      Ho, ho! see the queer little prints there       That cover the road, baby, look!     At the web-footed tangle that hints where       The ducks have gone down to the brook!      The Muscovy mammas that waddled       Zigzag, you can trace in their tracks,     And the dear little ducklings that toddled       And tumbled sometimes on their backs!         *       *       *       *       *      Buttercup, buttercup, buttercup gold,     O give us a handful of riches to hold!      Ho, ho! laughs the baby, and grasps in his glee     His wealth, but soon shows what a spend-thrift is he!     --Nay, nay, he is king, though he never was crowned,     And royally scatters his gold on the ground!         *       *       *       *       *      Bough of the willow-tree       Over the brook,     Down darts a kingfisher,       Look, baby, look!      Back on the willow-bough,       Fishing is done;     Happy and nappy now       There in the sun.         *       *       *       *       *      Happy and nappy the baby is, too,     Softly his eyelids droop over the blue,     Golden his curls on the white pillow lie,     Sleep, baby, sleep, baby, hush-a-by-bye.     AN INDIAN RAID       Did you see some Indians passing,       Just a short while back?     Looks as if they must be massing       For a fierce attack!      Buckskin fringes, turkey-feather       Huge head-dresses and     Bows and arrows, altogether       Quite a frightful band!      From the lilac-bushes springing,       See them rushing! Ugh!     Awful war-whoops wildly ringing!       There'll be scalping, too!      In their fearful frenzy leaping,       It is very plain     Soon around us they'll be heaping       Mountains of the slain!      Soon their victims will be falling--       But, above the noise,     Hark! I hear somebody calling,       \"Come to dinner, boys!\"     THE FIRST SLEIGH-RIDE       O happy time of fleecy rime       And falling"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19389"],["title","Child Songs of Cheer (#2)"],["body","lakes, and O     The glad surprise in baby eyes       That never saw the snow!      Down shining ways the flying sleighs       Go jingling by, and see!     Beside the gate the horses wait       And neigh for you and me!     SLEEPY TIME       Hey, baby! Ho, baby! here upon my knee,     See the firelight flicker over you and me!      See the tiny people basking in the glow,     Peering through the ruddy little coals, and so      How they dance and scamper! Merry fairy folk!     Little sparks for spangles, little wings of smoke!      Come baby, come baby, nestle in my arms;     Hear the purring flames now sing their sleepy charms.      All the firelight fairies, all the drowsy elves,     In the downy ashes cover up themselves.      And I fold the little blanket over you;     Bye baby, my baby, let us slumber too.     WHEN BETTIE AND ANNE WENT WALKING           When they took their dollies walking,         They were both so busy talking,     (They had not met for half an hour and so had much to say)         That they heedlessly kept going         Down the shady streets, not knowing,     Till they wanted to come back again, they could not find the way!          In their fright they felt forlorner         Every time they turned a corner,     And they wailed to one another, \"Oh, whatever shall we do?         A big bear might come to bite us,         Or a dreadful dog to fight us,     Or the wicked gipsies get us! _Oh, boo-hoo! Boo-hoo! Boo-hoo!_\"          But this story, though a sad one,         Has an end that's not a bad one,     For at last somebody found them as they bade the world good-by;         They took their dollies home again,         And vowed they'd never roam again,     And their mothers hugged and kissed them, saying, \"There, my dears,             don't cry!\"     THE BLUEBIRD       To-day at dawn there twinkled through     The pearly mist a flash of blue       So dazzling bright I thought the sky       Shone through the rifted clouds on high,               Till, by and by,     A note so honey-sweet I heard,     I knew that bright flash was a bird!     THE ORGAN-GRINDER       Hark! I hear the organ-grinder       Coming down the street,     And the sudden clatter-patter       Of the children's feet!      Come, oh, let us run to meet him!       Did you ever hear     Tunes so gay as he is playing,       Or so sweet and clear?      See the brown-faced little monkey,       Impudent and bold,     With his little scarlet jacket       Braided all in gold!      And his tiny cap and tassel       Bobbing to and fro,     Look, oh, look! he plucks it off now,       Bowing very low.      And he's passing it politely--       Can it be for _pay_?     O dear me! I have no penny!       Let us run away!     THE NEW MOON       Pretty new moon, little new moon,       Now, as first I look at you,     I must make a wish, for wise folks       Say it surely will come true!      Little new moon, pretty new moon,       I wish--but I must not tell!     For if any one should hear it,       Wise folks say it breaks the spell!     SHOWERY TIME       The April rain-drops tinkle       In cuckoo-cups of gold,     And warm south winds unwrinkle       The buds the peach-boughs hold.      In countless fluted creases       The little elm-leaves show,     While white as carded fleeces       The dogwood blossoms blow.      A rosy robe is wrapping       The early red-bud trees;     But still the haws are napping,       Nor heed the honey-bees.      And still in lazy sleeping       The apple-buds are bound,     But tulip-tips are peeping       From out the garden ground.      And yonder, gayly swinging       Upon the turning vane,     A robin redbreast singing       Makes merry at the rain!     EASTER DAY       Christ the Lord is risen to-day!     Angels rolled the stone away     From the tomb wherein He lay!      Little children, come and sing,     \"Glory, glory to the King,     Christ the Lord of everything!\"     THE SANDMAN       The Sandman! hark, I hear him!       He's coming up the stair,     And everybody near him       Is nodding, I declare!      He's peeping in the door now,       And first of all he spies,     As he has done before now,       The little children's eyes!      Then quickly does he throw it,       His golden sleepy-sand,     And all, before they know it,       Are off for sleepy-land!     DANDELION CURLS       Ah, ha, ha, now! who comes here     Wreathed in flowers of gold and queer     Tiny tangled curls of green     Gayly bobbing in between?      Pretty token of the spring!     Hark! we hear the bluebirds sing     When we thus see little girls     Decked in dandelion curls.     POP-CORN                _Pop! Pop!--Poppetty-pop!_     Shake and rattle and rattle and shake     The golden grains as they bounce and break     To fluffy puffiness--_Poppetty-pop!_     Bursting and banging the popper's top!              _Poppetty-pop!                   Pop! Pop!_      The yellow kernels, oh, see them grow     White as cotton or flakes of snow!                _Pop! Pop!_     O-ho, how they frolic and fly about     And turn themselves suddenly inside out!     _Pop-pop-poppetty! Pop-pop-pop!_     The popper's full and we'll have to stop;     Pile the bowl with the tempting treat,     Children, come, it is time to eat!     THE RASH LITTLE SPARROW         Rash little sparrow         Up in the nest;     Feathers not long enough,     Wee wings not strong enough!         Poor little sparrow!         Poor little breast!     WHAT IF?       When I see the new moon lightly      Through cloud ripples slip,     Then I'm sure that shining brightly      It's a fairy ship!      What if in it we were sailing      Far and far away,     With a wake of silver trailing,      Till the golden day?      Why, we'd fly back home together      Safely from the sky,     For the moon's a fairy feather      When the sun is high!     EASTER EGGS       Seven little nests of hay     We have made, for Easter day     Is to-morrow, and you know     We must have them ready, so     When the Rabbit comes she'll see     We expected her, that we     Children tried our very best     Each to make the nicest nest.      One is in the lilac-bush,     Near the ground--last year a thrush     Built a nest there--let me see,     Two are by the apple-tree,     In the clover--that makes three--     One beside the playhouse door,     --Three plus one, that must be four--     Two are in the tulip-bed--     Was it seven that I said?     Oh, yes! six I've counted, and     One is in our pile of sand.         *       *       *       *       *      Come and see! Oh, hurry, hurry!     For the Rabbit, kind and furry,     Has been here again and laid     Eggs in every nest we made!     Purple, orange, red, and blue,     Pink and green and yellow, too,     Like a bunch of finest flowers     Ever seen, and all are ours!     And oh, _look!_ What _do_ you think!     Here our names are in white ink,     All spelled nicely so we know     Just where every egg should go!     Is it not surprising, quite,     How well Easter Rabbits write?     THE BIRDS' BATH       In our garden we have made       Such a pretty little pool,     Lined with pebbles neatly laid,       Filled with water clean and cool.      [Illustration: THE BIRDS' BATH]      When the sun shines warm and high       Robins cluster round its brink,     Never one comes flying by       But will flutter down to drink.      Then they splash and splash and splash,       Spattering little showers bright     All around, till off they flash       Singing sweetly their delight.     NOVEMBER MORNING       A tingling, misty marvel       Blew hither in the night,     And now the little peach-trees       Are clasped in frozen light.      Upon the apple-branches       An icy film is caught,     With trailing threads of gossamer       In pearly patterns wrought.      The autumn sun, in wonder,       Is gayly peering through     This silver-tissued network       Across the frosty blue.      The weather-vane is fire-tipped,       The honeysuckle shows     A dazzling icy splendor,       And crystal is the rose.      Around the eaves are fringes       Of icicles that seem     To mock the summer rainbows       With many-colored gleam.      Along the walk, the pebbles       Are each a precious stone;     The grass is tasseled hoarfrost,       The clover jewel-sown.      Such sparkle, sparkle, sparkle       Fills all the frosty air,     Oh, can it be that darkness       Is ever anywhere!     THE RUNAWAY       A frantic clatter of horses' feet!     A runaway's coming down the street!           Flurry, scurry,           Children, hurry!     Drop your playthings! Quick! don't wait!     Run and get within the gate!     Push the baby in the door,     Scramble in yourselves before           --_Whoa! Whoa!_           There they go!     Pell-mell rushing, snorting, quaking,     Wagon rumbling, harness breaking,     Frightened so they cannot know     Everybody's shrieking \"_Whoa!_\"           O my, don't cry!       Whiz, bang, they've galloped by!     No one hurt, but horses dashed     Round a post and wagon smashed!           Dear me! Dear me!       When a runaway we see,     Children, too, must run, oh, fast!     Run and hide as it goes past!     LOST!       \"Peep! Peep! Peep!\" Poor little chick!       Little cry so weak and small,     Meadow grass so tall and thick,       And the clover tufts so tall!      Little heart in sore distress,       Longing for the mother wing;     Through the weedy wilderness       Searching for its sheltering!     THE QUEEN'S PAGE       Once I was a little page       To a May-day queen,     And I wore a little coat       Made of Lincoln green.      Oh, the queen was beautiful!       And she had a bright     Crown of golden cuckoo-buds       And violets blue and white.      On the step beside her throne       I sat very still,     Ready, as a page should be,       To obey her will.      And before us little girls,       Each with"]]]
