One of them he recognized, and gave a peculiar whistle, which drew the two men in the direction from which it came.  \"Is that you, major?\" asked Corny, in a low tone.  \"Hush! You are a simpleton, Corny!\" exclaimed one of the men, as he came up to the palisades of the fence. \"Didn't I tell you not to call me by name?\"  \"I didn't call you by name,\" replied Corny, smartly.  \"You called me major, and that is about the same thing,\" added the speaker on the other side of the fence.  \"The woods are full of majors now, both in the North and the South, and no one knows you especially by that name. But I will remember in future, Mr. Mulgate,\" replied Corny.  \"That sounds better, Neal. If we lose the game it will be by your blundering,\" continued the major, or Mulgate, as he preferred to be called on the present occasion.  \"I suppose you have no talent for blundering, Mulgate; and that is the reason why you happen to be here at the present moment,\" retorted Corny, not at all pleased with the speech of the other.  \"None of your impudence, Neal!\" said Mulgate, sharply.  \"If you lose the game, you say that it will be by my blundering, Mulgate,\" continued Corny. \"That makes it seem as though I was to bear the responsibility of a failure; and I don't like the looks of things. If I am to be responsible for a failure, I ought to have something to say about the manner of conducting the enterprise.\"  \"Shut up, Neal! We have no time to talk nonsense of that sort. I am to conduct the enterprise, and you are to obey my orders. That is the whole of it,\" replied Mulgate, impatient at the position taken by the young man. \"You are still under my command, and you will obey me or take the consequences. Now to business: what have you learned?\"  \"Nothing at all,\" answered Corny, rather sullenly.  \"What have you been about? Haven't you discovered anything?\"  \"Nothing at all; I have but just arrived here. I took supper with my uncle, and told him the fish story you invented for me.\"  \"Did he believe it?\"  \"I don't know whether he did or not; but he and the rest of the family treated me very handsomely, which made me feel meaner than a dead catfish.\"  \"Never mind your feelings; you are here to assist in a great enterprise, and you are expected to do your duty to your country without regard to your own notions. Report what you have done.\"  \"I haven't done anything but introduce myself into the house, and explain how I happen to be here,\" replied Corny, as he proceeded to give the details of his meeting with his uncle.  \"Is Miss Florry at home?\" asked Mulgate, in a more gentle tone, as though he had a deeper interest in the direction he had indicated.  \"She is at home, and was at the supper table with us.\"  \"How does she seem to be?\" asked the stranger.  \"First rate; she is as jolly as though no one ever heard of such a thing as war,\" replied Corny, with enthusiasm.  \"Did she say anything about her stay at Glenfield?\" inquired Mulgate, whose interest seemed to mount to the pitch of anxiety.  \"Not a word; she did not even hint at Glenfield, or anything connected with it,\" answered Corny; and, after the sharp tones of the other, he seemed to take pleasure in thorning him with negative answers.  \"Did she say anything about me?\"  \"Not a word.\"  \"Didn't she mention my name?\"  \"She did not.\"  \"Didn't she ask about my health, or want to know where I was?\"  \"Florry did not allude to you in any manner. If she wanted to know where you were, she did not say a word about it to me,\" replied Corny, in the most decided tones.  It was still light enough to see that there was something like a frown on the brow of Mr. Mulgate. He had evidently believed that the daughter of the millionnaire of Bonnydale was interested in him, and his inquiries indicated that he expected her to ask about him; but she had not made the remotest allusion to him. Besides, she was as jolly as she had been at Glenfield, when war was a matter of the future, which few believed would ever be realized. She had not grown thin and pale during her absence from him, and she did not appear to be wasting her sweetness in pining for him.  \"What in the world are you talking about, Mulgate?\" suddenly demanded his companion on his side of the fence. \"I thought we were here for business, and you are talking about some girl.\"  \"She is the lady of whom I spoke to you; she spent the last winter with her uncle at the Glenfield Plantation. I am interested in her,\" replied Mulgate, as though he had given a sufficient excuse for the questions he had put to Corny.  \"Are we to capture her and take her back to the State of Alabama?\" demanded the other, who seemed to be a gentleman of forty at least.  \"I don't know; that depends; but, Captain Carboneer, I hope you will be my friend in this little matter,\" added Mulgate.  \"I don't know any thing about the little matter; but I am not willing to jeopardize the enterprise that brings us here to help you out with a love affair,\" replied the older gentleman. \"There will be time enough for you to look for a wife after the war is over, and you have more time to attend to the affair.\"  \"Mr. Mulgate, I should like to know something more about your intentions before we go any farther,\" interposed Corny, in a tone so decided that Mulgate had to listen to him, especially as he had obtained so little sympathy from the elderly gentleman.  \"Speak quick then, for we have no time to spare,\" added Mulgate.  \"Do I understand from what you have said that you intend to take Florry Passford back to the South with you?\" asked Corny, with his teeth closely pressed together, so that it was rather difficult for him to speak intelligibly.  \"I answer, as I did before, that I don't know what I shall do; that depends,\" replied Mulgate evasively.  \"Depends upon what?\"  \"I have no time to discuss that matter now,\" added Mulgate, turning to his companion.  \"But I have time to say that I will ruin the whole enterprise if you mean to commit an outrage such as you appear to have in your mind,\" replied Corny, as vigorously as though he had been the military equal of the one he had called \"major\" by accident.  \"Do you mean to be a traitor to your country, Neal?\" demanded Mulgate angrily.  \"Neither to my country nor to my uncle.\"  \"Your uncle is a Yankee, and is doing all he can to subjugate the free South. He has no rights which we are bound to respect,\" said Mulgate fiercely.  \"This will never do,\" interposed Captain Carboneer; and this may or may not have been his real name. \"We are getting into a disagreement at the very first step of our enterprise.\"  \"I don't know you, Captain Carboneer, but I wish to be understood as meaning every word I have said; and I will wreck this enterprise, if I am shot for it, rather than allow my cousin to be carried off in connection with it,\" protested Corny stoutly. \"I will do my duty faithfully; but I will not assist in robbing my uncle of his daughter.\"  \"You are quite right, young man; and I would rather be sent to the fort as a prisoner of war than take part in such an enterprise,\" added Captain Carboneer, in mild but forcible tones.  \"You astonish me, captain!\" said Mulgate. \"Why do you talk about an outrage? I claim to be a gentleman, and to be above any such villainy as you and Corny suggest. I do not propose to rob Captain Passford of his daughter. What I may do depends--depends upon the consent of the lady. If she is willing to go with me\"--  \"She is not willing to go with you; and she never will be willing to go with you,\" Corny interposed. \"I don't know what you are thinking about, Mr. Mulgate; but Florry cares no more about you than she does about Uncle Pedro, my father's house-servant. She saw you both at Glenfield, and I can't tell which she likes best.\"  \"We had better drop the subject,\" added Captain Carboneer.  \"Drop it, then,\" replied Mulgate sullenly. \"Get over the fence, Corny. Nobody is using that sailboat, and we may as well take it for a while.\"     CHAPTER III  THE DIGNIFIED NAVAL OFFICER   Corny climbed over the high palisade fence, with the assistance of Mulgate, and the party walked to the sailboat at the beach below. By this time it was dark, though the gloom was not very dense under a clear sky.  \"Do you know anything about this boat, Corny?\" asked Mulgate, as the trio approached the handsome craft, for such she was beyond a doubt.  The crusty tones of the speaker indicated that he had not yet recovered from the set-back he had plainly received in the late conversation, though he denied that he had any evil intentions in regard to Miss Florry.  \"I do; I know all about her,\" replied Corny.  \"Well, why don't you tell what you know?\" demanded Mulgate.  \"What do you wish to know about her?\" inquired Corny, who was disposed to maintain his equality in spite of the military rank of his companion, which he had incautiously betrayed in the beginning.  \"Whose boat is it?\" asked Mulgate.  \"She belongs to my cousin, Christy Passford.\"  \"Where is he now?\"  \"I don't know, sir.\"  \"Was he at the house when you were there?\"  \"He was not; and his mother had become rather anxious because he did not return to supper,\" replied Corny, becoming a little more pliable.  \"This is a rather large boat, Captain Carboneer,\" added Mulgate, as he surveyed the trim sloop. \"She is rather too large for our purpose.\"  \"She will answer very well,\" replied the captain, as he applied his shoulder to the stem of the craft to ascertain how heavily she rested upon the beach. \"Now, do you know whether there is any person on board of that steamer?\"  \"Of course, I don't know anything about it,\" said Mulgate.  \"I am sure I don't,\" added Corny.  \"I sent you up here to ascertain all about the Bellevite,\" continued Mulgate, rather sharply.  \"I have not had time to find out anything,\" Corny explained, with some indignation in his tones.  \"Corny has done as well as he could in the time he has had to do it in,\" interposed Captain Carboneer.

His _Letters_ must not be called theology. Academic theology was not a department in which Pascal was versed; when necessary, the fathers of Port-Royal came to his aid. The _Letters_ are the work of one of the finest mathematical minds of any time, and of a man of the world who addressed, not theologians, but the world in general--all of the cultivated and many of the less cultivated of the French laity; and with this public they made an astonishing success.  During this time Pascal never wholly abandoned his scientific interests. Though in his religious writings he composed slowly and painfully, and revised often, in matters of mathematics his mind seemed to move with consummate natural ease and grace. Discoveries and inventions sprang from his brain without effort; among the minor devices of this later period, the first omnibus service in Paris is said to owe its origin to his inventiveness. But rapidly failing health, and absorption in the great work he had in mind, left him little time and energy during the last two years of his life.  The plan of what we call the _Pensées_ formed itself about 1660. The completed book was to have been a carefully constructed defence of Christianity, a true Apology and a kind of Grammar of Assent, setting forth the reasons which will convince the intellect. As I have indicated before, Pascal was not a theologian, and on dogmatic theology had recourse to his spiritual advisers. Nor was he indeed a systematic philosopher. He was a man with an immense genius for science, and at the same time a natural psychologist and moralist. As he was a great literary artist, his book would have been also his own spiritual autobiography; his style, free from all diminishing idiosyncrasies, was yet very personal. Above all, he was a man of strong passions; and his intellectual passion for truth was reinforced by his passionate dissatisfaction with human life unless a spiritual explanation could be found.  We must regard the _Pensées_ as merely the first notes for a work which he left far from completion; we have, in Sainte-Beuve's words, a tower of which the stones have been laid on each other, but not cemented, and the structure unfinished. In early years his memory had been amazingly retentive of anything that he wished to remember; and had it not been impaired by increasing illness and pain, he probably would not have been obliged to set down these notes at all. But taking the book as it is left to us, we still find that it occupies a unique place in the history of French literature and in the history of religious meditation.  To understand the method which Pascal employs, the reader must be prepared to follow the process of the mind of the intelligent believer. The Christian thinker--and I mean the man who is trying consciously and conscientiously to explain to himself the sequence which culminated in faith, rather than the public apologist--proceeds by rejection and elimination. He finds the world to be so and so; he finds its character inexplicable by any non-religious theory; among religions he finds Christianity, and Catholic Christianity, to account most satisfactorily for the world and especially for the moral world within; and thus, by what Newman calls \"powerful and concurrent\" reasons, he finds himself inexorably committed to the dogma of the Incarnation. To the unbeliever, this method seems disingenuous and perverse; for the unbeliever is, as a rule, not so greatly troubled to explain the world to himself, nor so greatly distressed by its disorder; nor is he generally concerned (in modern terms) to \"preserve values.\" He does not consider that if certain emotional states, certain developments of character, and what in the highest sense can be called \"saintliness\" are inherently and by inspection known to be good, then the satisfactory explanation of the world must be an explanation which will admit the \"reality\" of these values. Nor does he consider such reasoning admissible; he would, so to speak, trim his values according to his cloth, because to him such values are of no great value. The unbeliever starts from the other end, and as likely as not with the question: Is a case of human parthenogenesis credible? and this he would call going straight to the heart of the matter. Now Pascal's method is, on the whole, the method natural and right for the Christian; and the opposite method is that taken by Voltaire. It is worth while to remember that Voltaire, in his attempt to refute Pascal, has given once and for all the type of such refutation; and that later opponents of Pascal's Apology for the Christian Faith have contributed little beyond psychological irrelevancies. For Voltaire has presented, better than any one since, what is the unbelieving point of view; and in the end we must all choose for ourselves between one point of view and another.  I have said above that Pascal's method is \"on the whole\" that of the typical Christian apologist; and this reservation was directed at Pascal's belief in miracles, which plays a larger part in his construction than it would in that, at least, of the modern liberal Catholic. It would seem fantastic to accept Christianity because we first believe the Gospel miracles to be true, and it would seem impious to accept it primarily because we believe more recent miracles to be true; we accept the miracles, or some miracles, to be true because we believe the Gospel of Jesus Christ: we found our belief in the miracles on the Gospel, not our belief in the Gospel on the miracles. But it must be remembered that Pascal had been deeply impressed by a contemporary miracle, known as the miracle of the Holy Thorn: a thorn reputed to have been preserved from the Crown of Our Lord was pressed upon an ulcer which quickly healed. Sainte-Beuve, who as a medical man felt himself on solid ground, discusses fully the possible explanation of this apparent miracle. It is true that the miracle happened at Port-Royal, and that it arrived opportunely to revive the depressed spirits of the community in its political afflictions; and it is likely that Pascal was the more inclined to believe a miracle which was performed upon his beloved sister. In any case, it probably led him to assign a place to miracles, in his study of faith, which is not quite that which we should give to them ourselves.  Now the great adversary against whom Pascal set himself, from the time of his first conversations with M. de Saci at Port-Royal, was Montaigne. One cannot destroy Pascal, certainly; but of all authors Montaigne is one of the least destructible. You could as well dissipate a fog by flinging hand-grenades into it. For Montaigne is a fog, a gas, a fluid, insidious element. He does not reason, he insinuates, charms, and influences; or if he reasons, you must be prepared for his having some other design upon you than to convince you by his argument. It is hardly too much to say that Montaigne is the most essential author to know, if we would understand the course of French thought during the last three hundred years. In every way, the influence of Montaigne was repugnant to the men of Port-Royal. Pascal studied him with the intention of demolishing him. Yet, in the _Pensées_, at the very end of his life, we find passage after passage, and the slighter they are the more significant, almost \"lifted\" out of Montaigne, down to a figure of speech or a word. The parallels[A] are most often with the long essay of Montaigne called _Apologie de Raymond Sébond_--an astonishing piece of writing upon which Shakespeare also probably drew in _Hamlet_. Indeed, by the time a man knew Montaigne well enough to attack him, he would already be thoroughly infected by him.      [A] Cf. the use of the simile of the _couvreur_. For comparing     parallel passages, the edition of the _Pensées_ by Henri Massis (_A     la cité des livres_) is better than the two-volume edition of     Jacques Chevalier (Gabalda). It seems just possible that in the     latter edition, and also in his biographical study (_Pascal_; by     Jacques Chevalier, English translation, published by Sheed & Ward),     M. Chevalier is a little over-zealous to demonstrate the perfect     orthodoxy of Pascal.  It would, however, be grossly unfair to Pascal, to Montaigne, and indeed to French literature, to leave the matter at that. It is no diminution of Pascal, but only an aggrandisement of Montaigne. Had Montaigne been an ordinary life-sized sceptic, a small man like Anatole France, or even a greater man like Renan, or even like the greatest sceptic of all, Voltaire, this \"influence\" would be to the discredit of Pascal; but if Montaigne had been no more than Voltaire, he could not have affected Pascal at all. The picture of Montaigne which offers itself first to our eyes, that of the original and independent solitary \"personality,\" absorbed in amused analysis of himself, is deceptive. Montaigne's is no _limited_ Pyrrhonism, like that of Voltaire, Renan, or France. He exists, so to speak, on a plan of numerous concentric circles, the most apparent of which is the small inmost circle, a personal puckish scepticism which can be easily aped if not imitated. But what makes Montaigne a very great figure is that he succeeded, God knows how--for Montaigne very likely did not know that he had done it--it is not the sort of thing that men _can_ observe about themselves, for it is essentially bigger than the individual's consciousness--he succeeded in giving expression to the scepticism of _every_ human being. For every man who thinks and lives by thought must have his own scepticism, that which stops at the question, that which ends in denial, or that which leads to faith and which is somehow integrated into the faith which transcends it. And Pascal, as the type of one kind of religious believer, which is highly"]]]
