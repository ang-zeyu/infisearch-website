But in our days the sword is not drawn for glory, but for the right to worship God in peace.  \"No one can doubt that, ere long, the men of the reformed religion will take up arms to defend their right to live, and worship God, in their own way. The cruel persecutions under Francis the First, Henry the Second, and Francis the Second have utterly failed in their object. When Merindol, Cabrieres, and twenty-two other towns and villages were destroyed, in 1547; and persons persecuted and forced to recant, or to fly as we did; it was thought that we were but a handful, whom it would be easy to exterminate. But in spite of edict after edict, of persecution, slaughterings, and burnings, in spite of the massacres of Amboise and others, the reformed religion has spread so greatly that even the Guises are forced to recognize it as a power. At Fontainebleau Admiral Coligny, Montmorency, the Chatillons, and others openly professed the reformed religion, and argued boldly for tolerance; while Conde and Navarre, although they declined to be present, were openly ranged on their side. Had it not been that Henry the Second and Francis were both carried off by the manifest hand of God, the first by a spear thrust at a tournament, the second by an abscess in the ear, France would have been the scene of deadly strife; for both were, when so suddenly smitten, on the point of commencing a war of extermination.  \"But it is only now that the full strength of those who hold the faith is manifested. Beza, the greatest of the reformers next to Calvin himself, and twelve of our most learned and eloquent pastors are at Poissy, disputing upon the faith with the Cardinal of Lorraine and the prelates of the Romish church, in the presence of the young king, the princes, and the court. It is evident that the prelates are unable to answer the arguments of our champions. The Guises, I hear, are furious; for the present Catharine, the queen mother, is anxious for peace and toleration, and it is probable that the end of this argument at Poissy will be an edict allowing freedom of worship.  \"But this will only infuriate still more the Papists, urged on by Rome and Philip of Spain. Then there will be an appeal to arms, and the contest will be a dreadful one. Navarre, from all I hear, has been well-nigh won over by the Guises; but his noble wife will, all say, hold the faith to the end, and her kingdom will follow her. Conde is as good a general as Guise, and with him there is a host of nobles: Rochefoucauld, the Chatillons, Soubise, Gramont, Rohan, Genlis, and a score of others. It will be terrible, for in many cases father and son will be ranged on opposite sides, and brother will fight against brother.\"  \"But surely, Gaspard, the war will not last for years?\"  \"It may last for generations,\" the weaver said gloomily, \"though not without intermissions; for I believe that, after each success on one side or the other, there will be truces and concessions; to be followed by fresh persecutions and fresh wars, until either the reformed faith becomes the religion of all France, or is entirely stamped out.  \"What is true of France is true of Holland. Philip will annihilate the reformers there, or they will shake off the yoke of Spain. England will be driven to join in one or both struggles; for if papacy is triumphant in France and Holland, Spain and France would unite against her.  \"So you see, sister, that in my opinion we are at the commencement of a long and bloody struggle for freedom of worship; and at any rate it will be good that the boy should be trained as he would have been, had you married one of your own rank in France; in order that, when he comes to man's estate, he may be able to wield a sword worthily in the defence of the faith.  \"Had I sons, I should train them as your husband intends to train Phil. It may be that he will never be called upon to draw a sword, but the time he has spent in acquiring its use will not be wasted. These exercises give firmness and suppleness to the figure, quickness to the eye, and briskness of decision to the mind. A man who knows that he can, at need, defend his life if attacked, whether against soldiers in the field or robbers in the street, has a sense of power and self reliance that a man, untrained in the use of the strength God has given him, can never feel. I was instructed in arms when a boy, and I am none the worse weaver for it.  \"Do not forget, Lucie, that the boy has the blood of many good French families in his veins; and you should rejoice that your husband is willing that he shall be so trained that, if the need should ever come, he shall do no discredit to his ancestors on our side. These English have many virtues, which I freely recognize; but we cannot deny that many of them are somewhat rough and uncouth, being wondrous lacking in manners and coarse in speech. I am sure that you yourself would not wish your son to grow up like many of the young fellows who come into town on market day. Your son will make no worse a farmer for being trained as a gentleman. You yourself have the training of a French lady, and yet you manage the farm to admiration.  \"No, no, Lucie, I trust that between us we shall make a true Christian and a true gentleman of him; and that, if needs be, he will show himself a good soldier, also.\"  And so, between his French relatives and his sturdy English father, Philip Fletcher had an unusual training. Among the Huguenots he learned to be gentle and courteous; to bear himself among his elders respectfully, but without fear or shyness; to consider that, while all things were of minor consequence in comparison to the right to worship God in freedom and purity, yet that a man should be fearless of death, ready to defend his rights, but with moderation and without pushing them to the injury of others; that he should be grave and decorous of speech, and yet of a gay and cheerful spirit. He strove hard so to deport himself that if, at any time, he should return to his mother's country, he could take his place among her relations without discredit. He learned to fence, and to dance.  Some of the stricter of the Huguenots were of opinion that the latter accomplishment was unnecessary, if not absolutely sinful; but Gaspard Vaillant was firm on this point.  \"Dancing is a stately and graceful exercise,\" he said, \"and like the use of arms, it greatly improves the carriage and poise of the figure. Queen Elizabeth loves dancing, and none can say that she is not a good Protestant. Every youth should be taught to dance, if only he may know how to walk. I am not one of those who think that, because a man is a good Christian, he should necessarily be awkward and ungainly in speech and manner, adverse to innocent gaieties, narrow in his ideas, ill dressed and ill mannered, as I see are many of those most extreme in religious matters, in this country.\"  Upon the other hand, in the school playground, under the shadow of the grand cathedral, Phil was as English as any; being foremost in their rough sports, and ready for any fun or mischief.  He fought many battles, principally because the difference of his manner from that of the others often caused him to be called \"Frenchy.\" The epithet in itself was not displeasing to him; for he was passionately attached to his mother, and had learned from her to love her native country; but applied in derision it was regarded by him as an insult, and many a tough battle did he fight, until his prowess was so generally acknowledged that the name, though still used, was no longer one of disrespect.  In figure, he took after his French rather than his English ancestors. Of more than average height for his age, he was apparently slighter in build than his schoolfellows. It was not that he lacked width of chest, but that his bones were smaller and his frame less heavy. The English boys, among themselves, sometimes spoke of him as \"skinny,\" a word considered specially appropriate to Frenchmen; but though he lacked their roundness and fulness of limb, and had not an ounce of superfluous flesh about him, he was all sinew and wire; and while in sheer strength he was fully their equal, he was incomparably quicker and more active.  Although in figure and carriage he took after his mother's countrymen, his features and expression were wholly English. His hair was light brown, his eyes a bluish gray, his complexion fair, and his mouth and eyes alive with fun and merriment. This, however, seldom found vent in laughter. His intercourse with the grave Huguenots, saddened by their exile, and quiet and restrained in manner, taught him to repress mirth, which would have appeared to them unseemly; and to remain a grave and silent listener to their talk of their unhappy country, and their discussions on religious matters.  To his schoolfellows he was somewhat of an enigma. There was no more good-tempered young fellow in the school, no one more ready to do a kindness; but they did not understand why, when he was pleased, he smiled while others roared with laughter; why when, in their sports, he exerted himself to the utmost, he did so silently while others shouted; why his words were always few and, when he differed from others, he expressed himself with a courtesy that puzzled them; why he never wrangled nor quarrelled; and why any trick played upon an old woman, or a defenceless person, roused him to fury.  As a rule, when boys do not quite understand one of their number they dislike him. Philip Fletcher was an exception. They did not understand him, but they consoled themselves under this by the explanation that he was half a Frenchman, and could not be expected to be like a regular English boy; and they recognized instinctively that he was their superior.  Much of Philip's time was spent at the house of his uncle, and among the Huguenot colony. Here also were many boys of his own age."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20097"],["title","The Tale of Mrs. Ladybug (#1)"],["body","I'm expected to wear my court costume every day.\"  \"Nonsense!\" Mrs. Ladybug retorted. \"The sooner you get such silly notions out of your head, the better off you'll be. Everybody ought to work. Too much play is bad for folks.\"  Buster Bumblebee could feel himself flushing. The neighbors were not expected to address a Queen's son in that fashion.  \"That's exactly the way you talk about Betsy Butterfly!\" he exploded.  \"Huh!\" Mrs. Ladybug sniffed. \"You are a worthless pair. Betsy Butterfly's wings--\"  At this point Buster managed to interrupt her.  \"Don't talk about wings, please!\" he cried. \"Who are you, to talk about wings?--when you haven't any yourself.\"  Mrs. Ladybug started; and she gave him a queer look. \"What's that?\" she inquired. \"What's that? Say that again!\"  \"You haven't any wings.\"  \"Ho!\" she laughed. \"You're mistaken. I _have_ wings.\"  \"Then you've left them at home,\" he insisted.  Mrs. Ladybug smiled a very knowing sort of smile. When he saw it Buster Bumblebee couldn't help feeling uncomfortable. Somehow he knew that he had blundered. But just where he had erred he was unable to decide.  \"Watch sharp, young sir!\" Mrs. Ladybug bade him. \"Watch sharp and perhaps you'll be able to learn something.\"  Then Buster Bumblebee received the surprise of his life. As he watched, little Mrs. Ladybug opened her shell-like, black-dotted, red back and spread a pair of delicate brown wings.  \"See these?\" she said to Buster Bumblebee, who gasped at her blankly. \"I've really _two_ pairs of wings, because my polka dot wing covers are actually wings too--only folks don't usually call them by that name.\"  Having spread her wings, Mrs. Ladybug decided to take a short flight. And with Buster gazing dully after her she flitted off.  \"I'll have to tell my mother, the Queen, about this,\" he muttered.     IV  RUSTY WREN HELPS   RUSTY WREN'S wife was getting very impatient. She was at home with her fast-growing family of youngsters, at home in the cherry tree near Farmer Green's chamber window.  \"Dear me!\" Mrs. Wren exclaimed. \"I don't see what's keeping Rusty. It's at least a quarter of an hour since he brought any food to these children.\"  Mrs. Wren soon grew tired of waiting.  \"I'll go and find him!\" she said under her breath. And telling her nestlings that she would be back in a few minutes, she hurried off towards the orchard.  \"I thought so!\" Mrs. Wren muttered soon afterward, as she caught sight of her husband. He was talking with Jolly Robin, in the old apple tree where the Robin family lived. \"I thought so!\"  \"Have you forgotten your duty as a parent?\" Mrs. Wren asked her husband in a tart voice, dropping down on a branch right behind him.  Rusty Wren jumped.  \"I've been here only a second or two,\" he faltered. \"Mr. Robin and I had a little business together.\"  \"So I see,\" said Mrs. Wren. \"So I see. And now, if your business is finished, allow me to remind you that you have six hungry sons and daughters at home.\" Then Mrs. Wren twitched herself off her perch and flew back to the cherry tree and her family.  \"I declare,\" Rusty Wren remarked to his friend Jolly Robin, \"I must have stayed here, talking with you, longer than I thought. Those children have enormous appetites. I'll have to work more spryly than ever to get them fed before sunset.\"  \"I know how that is,\" said Jolly Robin with a chuckle. Somehow he seemed much more cheerful than his companion. \"I was actually glad when our last nestlings were big enough to leave home and hustle for themselves. But, of course,\" he added, \"I still keep an eye on them.\"  Rusty Wren had already begun to hunt for tidbits. Almost immediately he found an ant, which he snatched up and carried away. Back and forth he flew, making dozens of trips between his house and the orchard. Grubs and caterpillars, grasshoppers and spiders--he seized them wherever he could spy them and took them home to his famishing children.  Though he worked his hardest, Mrs. Wren hadn't a smile for him. And when she said anything in his hearing, it was some such remark as this: \"You poor, hungry dears! It's a pity you can't have all you need to eat. I only hope your scanty meals won't stunt your growth.\"  Naturally such speeches didn't make her husband feel any more at his ease.  \"I'll have to bring home something special, to please her,\" he thought. \"I wish I could find some dainty that would put her in better humor.\"  So he looked all around to see what he could discover that was different from the food he had been gathering. And it wasn't long before he gave a chirp of delight. \"Here's a pretty beetle!\" he cried. \"I know it will make Mrs. Wren smile when I show it to her.\"  Thereupon Rusty Wren pounced upon Mrs. Ladybug and bore her away, struggling, in his bill.     V  A HARD SHELL   RUSTY WREN hurried home, carrying Mrs. Ladybug despite her frantic efforts to escape. She wriggled all her six legs at the same time.  \"She'll be pleased with this one,\" Rusty murmured, as he watched Mrs. Ladybug's struggles. \"Mrs. Wren will certainly thank me when I give her this morsel.\"  And she did.  \"How lovely!\" Mrs. Wren exclaimed when Rusty gave her his captive.  And he was so glad that he hastened away to try to find another just like that one. But he hadn't gone far before he said, \"Ugh! I hope I haven't made a mistake. I don't like the taste of that beetle.\" And he dropped down upon the ground and carefully wiped his bill upon the grass.  He couldn't help feeling somewhat worried.  \"I don't believe the children will notice anything wrong,\" he muttered. \"So far, they've never refused anything that was offered them. But if Mrs. Wren tried to eat that beetle herself, I fear there'll be trouble.\"  And there was. Rusty knew it a few minutes later, when little Mr. Chippy's son, Chippy, Jr., came flitting up and peeped in his childish voice, \"Please, sir, Mrs. Wren wants you at once.\"  There was nothing to do except to go home. And Rusty went.  He found Mrs. Wren much upset.  \"Are you trying to poison us?\" she demanded.  \"No, indeed--my love!\" Rusty Wren replied meekly.  \"Well, you made a terrible mistake, then,\" she declared.  Meanwhile Rusty Wren was looking all around. Yet he couldn't see the pretty beetle (meaning Mrs. Ladybug) anywhere. \"Somebody must have swallowed it, anyhow,\" he thought.  \"You must be more careful,\" his wife told him severely. \"That was a horrid-tasting beetle that you brought home. It's lucky I discovered that it was a queer one. The children--poor dears!--are so hungry that any one of them would have bolted it had I offered it to him.\"  \"Then you ate it yourself,\" Rusty Wren faltered.  \"Oh, no, I didn't,\" said his wife. \"I dropped it upon the ground. And no doubt I'd have thrown it away, anyhow, no matter how it tasted.\"  \"Why?\" he asked her. \"I thought it was a pretty beetle.\"  \"It was pretty enough--I dare say,\" Mrs. Wren replied. \"But it had a very hard shell. It wouldn't have been safe to feed it to the children. Nor should I have cared to eat it myself.\"  \"I thought it was a pretty beetle,\" Rusty said again. \"It was such a gay color--bright red, you know. It seemed to me it would please the children, and you, too.\"  Mrs. Wren still seemed to be somewhat out of patience.  \"When you gather food for the youngsters, never mind about the color of it!\" she exclaimed. \"If you want to bring them playthings, that's another matter. But don't fetch home any more pretty red beetles for them to eat.\"  \"Very well--my love!\" said Rusty Wren. And then he slipped away to hunt for food, because the children were still clamoring for more.  Mrs. Wren talked a good deal, afterward, about her terrible experience. Yet she never stopped to think about the pretty beetle--about little Mrs. Ladybug. For Mrs. Ladybug had had a dreadful fright. Luckily she wasn't hurt. But it was a long time before she was her usual busy, able self again. And later, when she told her friends about her adventure, she said that she couldn't understand how Rusty came to make such a mistake.  \"I supposed,\" Mrs. Ladybug declared, \"that every bird in Pleasant Valley knew I wasn't good to eat.\"     VI  THE TRAVELER   FARMER GREEN'S garden was growing fast. The sweet corn waved and rustled whenever a breeze swept it. The beets and carrots sent their pert tops a little higher each day. The cabbages began to puff their heads out as if they felt of some importance in the world. And the potato vines were actually pretty, with their white blossoms amid the green leaves. Farmer Green was very proud of his potatoes. He said, in Mrs. Ladybug's hearing, that they were the best he had ever raised.  \"I must fly over to the garden and have a look at those potatoes,\" Mrs. Ladybug thought. \"It's always a pleasure to see flourishing crops.\"  Before she found time to spare for her visit to the garden a traveler entered the orchard one day. At least, he had every appearance of having come from other parts. For he carried a traveling bag--an old-fashioned carpetbag--and he seemed to have lost his way.  As soon as Mrs. Ladybug saw him she couldn't help thinking what a handsome person he was. He wore a yellow coat. And instead of being spotted with black, as her gown was, it was striped.  \"Good morning!\" said the stranger.  \"Good morning!\" said Mrs. Ladybug. \"Can I be of any service to you?\"  The stranger took off his cap. He was a most polite chap.  \"Perhaps you can help me,\" he replied.  \"I'm looking for Farmer Green's vegetable garden. Do you know where it is?\"  \"Indeed I do!\" Mrs. Ladybug cried. \"It's at the end of this orchard, just beyond the fence.\"  \"And the potato patch--I suppose I'll have no trouble finding that?\" the stranger went on.  \"Follow your nose!\" said Mrs. Ladybug. \"You're headed right for it now.\"  The stranger thanked her. And he was about to move on. But of course Mrs. Ladybug wanted to talk more than that before he got away.  \"The potatoes are fine this season,\" she remarked.  The stranger looked greatly pleased.  \"That's good news,\""]]]
