Somebody has to stay with her, and her husband won't.  The 'Squire ain't a strong man, and he's most too old to go to meetin' now.  The youngest son has just died in New York, so I hear.\"  \"What ailed him?\" inquired Maria Sharp.  \"I guess he was completely wore out takin' care of his health,\" returned Mrs. Sargent.  \"He had a splendid constitution from a boy, but he was always afraid it wouldn't last him.--The seat back o' 'Squire Bean's is the old Peabody pew--ain't that the Peabody pew you're scrubbin', Nancy?\"  \"I believe so,\" Nancy answered, never pausing in her labours.  \"It's so long since anybody sat there, it's hard to remember.\"  \"It is the Peabodys', I know it, because the aisle runs right up facin' it.  I can see old Deacon Peabody settin' in this end same as if 'twas yesterday.\"  \"He had died before Jere and I came back here to live,\" said Mrs. Burbank.  \"The first I remember, Justin Peabody sat in the end seat; the sister that died, next, and in the corner, against the wall, Mrs. Peabody, with a crepe shawl and a palm-leaf fan.  They were a handsome family.  You used to sit with them sometimes, Nancy; Esther was great friends with you.\"  \"Yes, she was,\" Nancy replied, lifting the tattered cushion from its place and brushing it; \"and I with her.--What is the use of scrubbing and carpeting, when there are only twenty pew-cushions and six hassocks in the whole church, and most of them ragged?  How can I ever mend this?\"  \"I shouldn't trouble myself to darn other people's cushions!\"  This unchristian sentiment came in Mrs. Miller's ringing tones from the rear of the church.  \"I don't know why,\" argued Maria Sharp.  \"I'm going to mend my Aunt Achsa's cushion, and we haven't spoken for years; but hers is the next pew to mine, and I'm going to have my part of the church look decent, even if she is too stingy to do her share.  Besides, there aren't any Peabodys left to do their own darning, and Nancy was friends with Esther.\"  \"Yes, it's nothing more than right,\" Nancy replied, with a note of relief in her voice, \"considering Esther.\"  \"Though he don't belong to the scrubbin' sex, there is one Peabody alive, as you know, if you stop to think, Maria; for Justin's alive, and livin' out West somewheres.  At least, he's as much alive as ever he was; he was as good as dead when he was twenty-one, but his mother was always too soft-hearted to bury him.\"  There was considerable laughter over this sally of the outspoken Mrs. Sargent, whose keen wit was the delight of the neighbourhood.  \"I know he's alive and doing business in Detroit, for I got his address a week or ten days ago, and wrote, asking him if he'd like to give a couple of dollars toward repairing the old church.\"  Everybody looked at Mrs. Burbank with interest.  \"Hasn't he answered?\" asked Maria Sharp.  Nancy Wentworth held her breath, turned her face to the wall, and silently wiped the paint of the wainscoting.  The blood that had rushed into her cheeks at Mrs. Sargent's jeering reference to Justin Peabody still lingered there for any one who ran to read, but fortunately nobody ran; they were too busy scrubbing.  \"Not yet.  Folks don't hurry about answering when you ask them for a contribution,\" replied the president, with a cynicism common to persons who collect funds for charitable purposes.  \"George Wickham sent me twenty-five cents from Denver.  When I wrote him a receipt, I said thank you same as Aunt Polly did when the neighbours brought her a piece of beef: 'Ever so much obleeged, but don't forget me when you come to kill a pig.'--Now, Mrs. Baxter, you shan't clean James Bruce's pew, or what was his before he turned Second Advent.  I'll do that myself, for he used to be in my Sunday-school class.\"  \"He's the backbone o' that congregation now,\" asserted Mrs. Sargent, \"and they say he's goin' to marry Mrs. Sam Peters, who sings in their choir as soon as his year is up.  They make a perfect fool of him in that church.\"  \"You can't make a fool of a man that nature ain't begun with,\" argued Miss Brewster.  \"Jim Bruce never was very strong-minded, but I declare it seems to me that when men lose their wives, they lose their wits!  I was sure Jim would marry Hannah Thompson that keeps house for him.  I suspected she was lookin' out for a life job when she hired out with him.\"  \"Hannah Thompson may keep Jim's house, but she'll never keep Jim, that's certain!\" affirmed the president; \"and I can't see that Mrs. Peters will better herself much.\"  \"I don't blame her, for one!\" came in no uncertain tones from the left- wing pews, and the Widow Buzzell rose from her knees and approached the group by the pulpit.  \"If there's anything duller than cookin' three meals a day _for_ yourself, and settin' down and eatin' 'em _by_ yourself, and then gettin' up and clearin' 'em away _after_ yourself, I'd like to know it!  I shouldn't want any good-lookin', pleasant-spoken man to offer himself to me without he expected to be snapped up, that's all! But if you've made out to get one husband in York County, you can thank the Lord and not expect any more favours.  I used to think Tom was poor comp'ny and complain I couldn't have any conversation with him, but land, I could talk at him, and there's considerable comfort in that.  And I could pick up after him!  Now every room in my house is clean, and every closet and bureau drawer, too; I can't start drawin' in another rug, for I've got all the rugs I can step foot on.  I dried so many apples last year I shan't need to cut up any this season.  My jelly and preserves ain't out, and there I am; and there most of us are, in this village, without a man to take steps for and trot 'round after!  There's just three husbands among the fifteen women scrubbin' here now, and the rest of us is all old maids and widders.  No wonder the men-folks die, or move away like Justin Peabody; a place with such a mess o' women-folks ain't healthy to live in, whatever Lobelia Brewster may say.\"     CHAPTER III   Justin Peabody had once faithfully struggled with the practical difficulties of life in Edgewood, or so he had thought, in those old days of which Nancy Wentworth was thinking as she wiped the paint of the Peabody pew.  Work in the mills did not attract him; he had no capital to invest in a stock of goods for store-keeping; school-teaching offered him only a pittance; there remained then only the farm, if he were to stay at home and keep his mother company.  \"Justin don't seem to take no holt of things,\" said the neighbours.  \"Good Heavens!\"  It seemed to him that there were no things to take hold of!  That was his first thought; later he grew to think that the trouble all lay in himself, and both thoughts bred weakness.  The farm had somehow supported the family in the old Deacon's time, but Justin seemed unable to coax a competence from the soil.  He could, and did, rise early and work late; till the earth, sow crops; but he could not make the rain fall nor the sun shine at the times he needed them, and the elements, however much they might seem to favour his neighbours, seldom smiled on his enterprises.  The crows liked Justin's corn better than any other in Edgewood.  It had a richness peculiar to itself, a quality that appealed to the most jaded palate, so that it was really worth while to fly over a mile of intervening fields and pay it the delicate compliment of preference.  Justin could explain the attitude of caterpillars, worms, grasshoppers, and potato-bugs toward him only by assuming that he attracted them as the magnet in the toy boxes attracts the miniature fishes.  \"Land of liberty! look at 'em congregate!\" ejaculated Jabe Slocum, when he was called in for consultation.  \"Now if you'd gone in for breedin' insecks, you could be as proud as Cuffy an' exhibit 'em at the County Fair!  They'd give yer prizes for size an' numbers an' speed, I guess! Why, say, they're real crowded for room--the plants ain't give 'em enough leaves to roost on!  Have you tried 'Bug Death'?\"  \"It acts like a tonic on them,\" said Justin gloomily.  \"Sho! you don't say so!  Now mine can't abide the sight nor smell of it. What 'bout Paris green?\"  \"They thrive on it; it's as good as an appetizer.\"  \"Well,\" said Jabe Slocum, revolving the quid of tobacco in his mouth reflectively, \"the bug that ain't got no objection to p'ison is a bug that's got ways o' thinkin' an' feelin' an' reasonin' that I ain't able to cope with!  P'r'aps it's all a leadin' o' Providence.  Mebbe it shows you'd ought to quit farmin' crops an' take to raisin' live stock!\"  Justin did just that, as a matter of fact, a year or two later; but stock that has within itself the power of being \"live\" has also rare qualifications for being dead when occasion suits, and it generally did suit Justin's stock.  It proved prone not only to all the general diseases that cattle-flesh is heir to, but was capable even of suicide. At least, it is true that two valuable Jersey calves, tied to stakes on the hillside, had flung themselves violently down the bank and strangled themselves with their own ropes in a manner which seemed to show that they found no pleasure in existence, at all events on the Peabody farm.  These were some of the little tragedies that had sickened young Justin Peabody with life in Edgewood, and Nancy Wentworth, even then, realized some of them and sympathized without speaking, in a girl's poor, helpless way.

I have sent Bubbles for a book, and I will read to you, to pass the time away.\"  Six o'clock came at last, and soon after Dimple heard her papa's voice in the hall.  \"Come right up,\" she heard him say.  \"I do believe he has brought the white girl,\" she said, clasping her hands; and, to be sure, when he opened the door, some one was behind him.  \"This is the nearest like you I could get,\" he said, and led forward some one in a grey frock and hat.  Dimple screamed, \"Why, it is Florence. Oh! papa, you didn't say you were going to auntie's!\"  \"No. I wanted to surprise you,\" he replied. \"And I thought your own cousin ought to be more like you than any one else.\"  \"Well, I am delighted. You are sure to stay a long, long time, Florence. Take off your hat and sit right here,\" she said, moving up on the lounge. \"I never had such a surprise.\"  \"You forgot I promised a doll, too,\" said her papa, as he opened a package. \"I thought Florence would like one, so I brought two, as near alike as if they were cousins,\" he added.  \"Oh! you preciousest papa,\" said Dimple; \"let me hug you all to pieces. I do think you are the most delightful man. I don't wonder mamma married you. When you go down please send Bubbles up here, so I can tell her I am almost glad she cut my foot, for it is worth it, to have Florence and a new doll too.\"  Bubbles came in beaming.  \"Bubbles,\" cried Dimple, \"see Florence and our new dolls,--and Bubbles, you shall have one of my old ones,--and Bubbles, when I grow up, you shall live with me always, because you cut my foot, and you must never, never think of the orphan asylum again.  \"Now, tell me, Florence,\" she said, turning to her, \"all about your coming. Didn't you have to get ready in a hurry?\"  \"Yes, indeed,\" replied Florence, \"and, oh Dimple, I was so glad when uncle asked mamma and she said 'yes,' and she just packed up my things in a jiffy, and we stopped at papa's office, and said good-bye to him, and uncle bought me oranges and papers on the cars, and we didn't seem a bit long coming.\"  \"Well, I am too glad,\" returned Dimple. \"Won't we have fun with the dolls? O, Florence, do eat your supper up here with me instead of going downstairs.\"  \"Of course,\" said Florence, \"unless you would rather go down, for uncle said he would carry you.\"  \"I know,\" said Dimple, \"but it is more fun to have it up here with my tea-set, and Bubbles to wait on us.\"  So they had their tea upstairs, with the table set by the window, where the wistaria peeped in to look at them, and a little brown bird, quite envious, put his head on one side, and stood on the sill a full minute before he flew away.  \"Oh! I think it is just lovely here,\" said Florence. \"Ever so much nicer than at our house.\"  \"Do you think so?\" said Dimple, quite pleased. \"You have a lovely house, though, Florence; it is four stories high, and has such beautiful things in it, and when you look out of the windows there is so much to see, carriages, and people all dressed up.\"  \"Yes, and dirty old beggars and ragmen,\" said Florence, \"and nasty, muddy streets.\"  They both laughed.  \"What cunning little doylies,\" said Florence. \"Who worked the little figures on them?\"  \"Mamma,\" said Dimple. \"Aren't they sweet? She always sends them up with my supper, one over the milk pitcher, and one over the cake. Do you like lots of sugar in your tea, Florence?\"  \"Two lumps.\"  \"Only two! Why I like three, and I believe I could take another; mamma says I have a sweet tooth, but I don't know where it is, for I have put my tongue on all of them and they all taste alike. Bubbles, go down and ask mamma if we mayn't have a little teensy-weensy bit more honey, we are both so hungry.\"  Bubbles took the little glass dish, and went off.  \"I wish I had a Bubbles,\" said Florence. \"We have a black man, but I think a little girl is ever so much nicer; then there is nurse, she takes us to walk; and then there is Kate, the cook, and Lena, the chambermaid, they are always fussing and quarreling. I get tired of so many.\"  \"We only have Sylvy and Bubbles,\" said Dimple. \"Sylvy is black too; she is real nice but she will get mad with Bubbles sometimes. Bubbles cleans knives, and runs errands, sets the table, wipes the dishes, and is a lot of help. You don't know how much she can do, and she learns something new every little while. Have some more honey, Florence, for that piece of bread. I never can come out even; sometimes I have to take more bread for the honey, and then more honey for the bread, till I do eat so much. Have you finished? I believe I have too.\"  \"It is _so_ nice here,\" said Florence, as they settled themselves after their tea, \"just delicious. It is so much pleasanter to see green grass, and trees, and flowers, than brick walls, and pavements. Do you play out of doors much?\"  \"Yes, all day, nearly; but I haven't since my foot was hurt. I couldn't run about, and I should have to wait for some one to bring me in; then I always want to be close to mamma when anything is the matter with me. Are you that way?\"  \"Yes,\" said Florence. \"Aren't mammas the best thing in the world? I hope mine doesn't miss me.\"  \"Now, Florence, don't get homesick, for I shall be distressed if you do. Let's talk about the dolls. Here comes mamma. We will ask her what we can dress them in.  \"Mamma, mamma, did you see our beauty dolls? Won't you get out your reserve bag to-morrow? I have looked over my piece box so much, and it would be perfectly splendid to have something I had never seen before.\"  \"What is a reserve bag?\" asked Florence.  \"Why, you see,\" said Dimple, \"mamma has a lot of bags, one for silk pieces, and one for white pieces, and one for pieces like our frocks, and so on, but the nicest is the one she keeps for occasions, like Christmas and birthdays and fairs, and there are the prettiest bits of velvet and silk in it. Mamma, bring out your reserve bag, that is a lovely blue-eyed mamma,\" said Dimple, coaxingly.  \"You are very complimentary,\" said her mamma, laughing. \"If you won't tease or worry me, to-morrow I will bring it out and you can each choose what you want.\"  \"Oh! mamma, you are lovelier and more blue-eyed than ever,\" said Dimple, \"let us both kiss you. We will be good as gold, won't we, Florence?\"  \"Yes, indeed,\" said she. \"Auntie, you are lovely.\"  \"I think if you don't go to bed,\" said Mrs. Dallas, \"you will keep me awake all night with your flattery.\"  \"Florence is to sleep with me, isn't she, mamma?\"  \"Certainly, and the sooner you go, the sooner it will be to-morrow.\"  \"Well, we will go now. See me ride, Florence,\" said Dimple, as her mamma put her in a rocking-chair and pushed the chair along through the door into Dimple's little blue and white room.  It was a dear little room, and Dimple, with the help of Bubbles, took care of it all herself.  There was a white curtained window around which roses and honeysuckle grew, and threw their tendrils about in a such a reckless way, that one or two had made up their minds to live in the room instead of outdoors, and were climbing around the window sash.  A little brass bedstead, a mantel with a blue and white lambrequin, a blue and white toilet set, pretty pictures on the wall, and a small bookshelf, made a very cozy looking nest for a little girl, and so Florence thought, who had no room of her own, but slept with an older sister.  They were both tired, and even the delightful topic of dolls could not keep them awake very long, for a half hour later when the moon looked in on her way across the sky, she saw them both sound asleep, an auburn head on Florence's pillow, and a yellow one on Dimple's.     CHAPTER II  Dolls   Florence and Dimple were on the back porch where it was always cool in the morning.  Bubbles was cleaning knives on the steps, the temptation to watch the dressing of the dolls being too great to keep her in the kitchen.  \"I declare,\" said Dimple, \"we haven't named them yet.\"  \"That is so,\" returned Florence.  \"You take first choice, then,\" said Dimple. \"I shall have to think, for I've had a Rose and a Violet and a Lily, besides one named Victoria, and one Aurelia.\"  Florence sat still watching Bubbles briskly scouring her knives. \"Dear me,\" she said, presently, \"it's awfully hard. How do you suppose our mothers found names for us?\"  \"Oh! that was easy enough,\" answered Dimple. \"I was named Eleanor after your mamma, and you were named Florence after mine; but, you see we are not sisters, so we can't do that. I'll tell you what let's do; you tell mamma the names you like best, and I will tell her those I like; then she can write them down and put them in a hat, and we will draw lots for them.\"  \"That will be a good plan,\" said Florence. \"She is coming now with the reserve bag.\"  \"Oh! Oh! Oh!\" they cried, as Mrs. Dallas shook out its contents.  \"Let Florence choose first, dear,\" said she as Dimple began making dives at the fluttering ends of silk. \"You may each have two pieces.\"  Dimple looked a little disappointed; being an only child she was used to first choice herself, but she yielded with a very good grace.  Florence finally chose a piece of maroon satin, and another of yellow brocaded velvet, while Dimple picked out a piece of silk with velvet stripes of a lovely pink, and another bit of blue silk brocade. \"Mamma,\" whispered she, \"give Bubbles a little piece, if she is black,\" and so the brightest bit of scarlet was picked out for Bubbles, who was made perfectly happy by it.  \"Now, names,\" exclaimed Dimple, as the rest of the pieces were returned to the bag. \"First Florence one and then I one. How many, Florence?\"  \"Four, I think. Ethel first, for me. No, you choose first, Dimple. I had first choice in the pieces.\"  \"No, you're company.\"  Being company, Florence took her rights, and Ethel went down.  \"Blanche, for me, mamma,\" said Dimple.  \"And Celestine for me, auntie.\"  \"Irene,\" said Dimple.  \"Geraldin"]]]
