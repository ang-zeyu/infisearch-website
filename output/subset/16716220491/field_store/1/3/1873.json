The Silver Foxes should be proud of their unselfish leader.\" Then he turned to Doc. Carson and winked the other eye.  He was a great jollier--Mr. Ellsworth.     CHAPTER II  [Transcriber's Note: An Indian scout sign drawing was inserted here.]   The old Indian scout sign, which is the title of this chapter, means _There is nothing new along this trail and it brings you back to the same place._ If you are already acquainted with Tom Slade and his friends you will be safe in skipping this chapter but, otherwise, you would better read it for it will tell you a little of Tom's past history and of the other scouts with whom you are to become acquainted in this volume.  To know just how all this election business came about we must go back a year or so to a time when Tom Slade was just a hoodlum down in Barrel Alley and believed with all his heart that the best use a barrel stave could be put to was to throw it into the Chinese laundry. He had heard of the Boy Scouts and he called them \"regiment guys\" and had a sophisticated contempt for them.  Then all of a sudden, along had come Roy Blakeley, who had shown him that he was just wasting good barrel staves; that you could make a first-class Indian bow out of a barrel stave. Roy had also told him that you can't smoke cigarettes if you expect to aim straight. That was an end of the barrel as a missile and that was an end of _Turkish Blend Mixture_--or whatever you call it. There wasn't any talk or preaching--just a couple of good knockout blows.  Tom had held that of all the joys in the mischievous hoodlum program none was so complete as that of throwing chunks of coal through streetcar windows at the passengers inside. Then along had come Westy Martin and shown him how you could mark patrol signs on rocks with chunks of coal--signs which should guide the watchful scout through the trackless wilderness. Exit coal as a missile.  In short, Tom Slade awoke to the realization not only that he was a hoodlum, but that he was out of date with his vulgar slang and bungling, unskilful tricks.  Tom and his father had lived in two rooms in one of John Temple's tenements down in Barrel Alley and John Temple and his wife and daughter lived in a couple of dozen rooms, a few lawns, porches, sun-parlors and things up in Grantley Square. And John Temple stood a better chance of being struck by lightning than of collecting the rent from Bill Slade.  John Temple was very rich and very grouchy. He owned the Bridgeboro National Bank; he owned all the vacant lots with their hospitable \"Keep Out\" signs, and he had a controlling interest in pretty nearly everything else in town--except his own temper.  Poor, lazy Bill Slade and his misguided son might have gone on living in John Temple's tenement rent free until it fell in a heap, for though Mr. Temple blustered he was not bad at heart; but on an evil day Tom had thrown a rock at Bridgeboro's distinguished citizen. It was a random, unscientific shot but, as luck would have it, it knocked John Temple's new golf cap off into the rich mud of Barrel Alley.  It did not hurt John Temple, but it killed the goose that laid the golden eggs for the Slades. Mr. Temple's dignity was more than hurt; it was black and blue. He would rather have been hit by a financial panic than by that sordid missile from Barrel Alley's most notorious hoodlum. Inside of three days out went the Slades from John Temple's tenement, bag and baggage.  There wasn't much baggage. A couple of broken chairs, a greasy dining-table which Tom had used strategically in his defensive operations against his father's assaults, a dented beer-can and a few other dilapidated odds and ends constituted the household effects of the unfortunate father and son.  Bill Slade, unable to cope with this unexpected disaster, disappeared on the day of the eviction and Tom was sheltered by a kindly neighbor, Mrs. O'Connor.  His fortunes were at the very lowest ebb and it seemed a fairly safe prophesy that he would presently land in the Home for Wayward Boys, when one day he met Roy Blakeley and tried to hold him up for a nickel.  Far be it from me to defend the act, but it was about the best thing that Tom ever did so far as his own interests were concerned. Roy took him up to his own little Camp Solitaire on the beautiful lawn of the Blakeley home, gave him a cup of coffee, some plum duff (Silver Fox brand, patent applied for), and passed him out some of the funniest slang (all brand new) that poor Tom had ever heard.  That was the beginning of Tom's transformation into a scout. He fell for scouting with a vengeance. It opened up a new world to him. To be sure, this king of the hoodlums did not capitulate all at once--not he. He was still wary of all \"rich guys\" and \"sissies\"; but he used to go down and peek through a hole in the fence of Temple's lot when they were practising their games.  Mr. Ellsworth said nothing, only winked his eye at the boys, for he saw which way the wind was blowing. Tom Slade, king of the hoodlums, had the scout bug and didn't know it.  Then, when the time was ripe, Mr. Ellsworth called him down into the field one day for a try at archery. Tom scrambled down from the fence and shuffled over to where the scouts waited with smiling, friendly faces; but just at that moment, who should come striding through the field but John Temple--straight for the little group.  What happened was not pleasant. John Temple denounced them all as a gang of trespassers, ordered them out of his field and did not hesitate to express his opinion of Tom in particular. Mr. Ellsworth then and there championed the poor fellow and prophesied that notwithstanding his past the scouts would make a man of him yet.  After that Tom Slade came out flat-footed and hit the scout trail. He was never able to determine to whom he should be most grateful, Roy Blakeley or Mr. Ellsworth, but it was the beginning of a friendship between the two boys which became closer as time passed.  There is no use retelling a tale that is told. Tom had such a summer in camp as he had never dreamed of when he used to lie in bed till noontime in Barrel Alley, and all that you shall find in its proper place, but you must know something of how Temple Camp came into being and how it came by its name.  John Temple was a wonderful man--oh, he was smart. He could take care of your property for you; if you had a thousand dollars he would turn it into two thousand for you--like a sleight-of-hand performer. He could tell you what kind of stocks to buy and when to sell them. He knew where to buy real estate. He could tell you when wheat was going up or down--just as if there were a scout sign to go by. He had everything that heart could wish--and the rheumatism besides.  But his dubious prophesy as to the future of Tom Slade, king of the hoodlums, came out all wrong. Tom was instrumental in getting back a pin which had been stolen from Mary Temple, and when her father saw the boy after six months or so of scouting he couldn't have been more surprised--not even if the Bridgeboro Bank had failed.  Then poor old John Temple (or rich old John Temple) showed that he had one good scout trait. He could be a good loser. He saw that he was all wrong and that Mr. Ellsworth was right and he straightway built a pavilion for the scouts in the beautiful woods where all the surprising episodes of the summer which had opened his eyes had taken place.  But you know as well as I do that a man like John Temple would never be satisfied with building a little one-troop camping pavilion; not he. So what should he do but buy a tract of land up in the Catskills close to a beautiful sheet of water which was called Black Lake; and here he put up a big open shack with a dozen or so log cabins about it and endowed the whole thing as a summer camp where troops from all over the country might come and find accommodations and recreation in the summer months.  That was not all. Temple Camp was to be a school where scouting might be taught (Oh, he was going to do the right thing, was old John Temple!), and to that end he communicated with somebody who communicated with somebody else, who got in touch with somebody else who went to some ranch or other a hundred miles from nowhere in the woolly west and asked old Jeb Rushmore if he wouldn't come east and look after this big scout camp. How in the world John Temple, in his big leather chair in the Bridgeboro Bank, had ever got wind of Jeb Rushmore no one was able to find out. John Temple was a genius for picking out men and in this case he touched high-water mark.  Jeb Rushmore was furnished with passes over all John Temple's railroads straight through from somewhere or other in Dakota to Catskill Landing, and a funny sight he must have been in his flannel shirt and slouch hat, sprawling his lanky limbs from the platforms of observation cars, drawling out his pithy observations about the civilization which he had never before seen.  There are only two more things necessary to mention in this \"side trail\" chapter. Tom's father bobbed up after the boy had become a scout. He was a mere shadow of his former self; drink and a wandering life had all but completed his ruin, and although Tom and his companions"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19522"],["title","Tom Slade at Temple Camp (#2)"],["body","him a home in their pleasant camp it was too late to help him much and he died among them, having seen (if it were any satisfaction for him to see) that scouting had made a splendid boy of his once neglected son.  This brings us to the main trail again and explains why it was that Roy Blakeley had held mysterious conferences with Mary Temple, and suggested to all the three patrols that it would be a good idea to elect Tom to go to Temple Camp to assist in its preparation and management. They had all known that one of their number was to be chosen for this post and Roy had hit on Tom as the one to go because he still lived with Mrs. O'Connor down in Barrel Alley and had not the same pleasant home surroundings as the other boys.  A scout is thoughtful.     CHAPTER III  PEE-WEE AND MARY TEMPLE   Throughout the previous summer Tom had been in Roy's patrol, the Silver Foxes, but when the new Elk Patrol was formed with Connie Bennett, the Bronson boys and others, he had been chosen its leader.  \"I think it's just glorious,\" said Mary Temple, when Tom told her of his plan and of Roy's noble sacrifice, \"and I wish I was a boy.\"  \"Oh, it's great to be a boy,\" enthused Pee-wee. \"Gee, that's one thing I'm glad of anyway--that I'm a boy!\"  \"Half a boy is better than all girl,\" taunted Roy.  \"_You're_ a model boy,\" added Westy.  \"And mother and father and I are coming up in the touring car in August to visit the camp,\" said Mary. \"Oh, I think it's perfectly lovely you and Tom are going on ahead and that you're going to walk, and you'll have everything ready when the others get there. Good-bye.\"  Tom and Roy were on their way up to the Blakeley place to set about preparing for the hike, for they meant to start as soon as they could get ready. Pee-wee lingered upon the veranda at Temple Court swinging his legs from the rubble-stone coping--those same legs that had made the scout pace famous.  \"Oh, crinkums,\" he said, \"they'll have _some_ time! Cracky, but I'd like to go. You don't believe all this about Roy's making a _noble sacrifice_, do you?\" he added, scornfully.  Mary laughed and said she didn't.  \"Because that isn't a good turn,\" Pee-wee argued, anxious that Mary should not get a mistaken notion of this important phase of scouting. \"A good turn is when you do something that helps somebody else. If you do it because you get a lot of fun out of it yourself, then it isn't a good turn at all. Of course, Roy knows that; he's only jollying when he calls it a good turn. You have to be careful with Roy, he's a terrible jollier--and Mr. Ellsworth's pretty near as bad. Oh, cracky, but I'd like to go with them--that's one sure thing. You think it's no fun being a girl and I'll admit _I_ wouldn't want to be one--I got to admit that; but it's pretty near as bad to be small. If you're small they jolly you. And if I asked them to let me go they'd only laugh. Gee, I don't mind being jollied, but I _would_ like to go. That's one thing you ought to be thankful for--you're not small. Of course, maybe girls can't do so many things as boys--I mean scouting-like--but--oh, crinkums,\" he broke off in an ecstasy of joyous reflection. \"Oh, crinkums, that'll be some trip, _believe me_.\"  Mary Temple looked at the diminutive figure in khaki trousers which sat before her on the coping. It was one of the good things about Pee-wee Harris that he never dreamed how much people liked him.  \"I don't know about that,\" said Mary. \"I mean about a girl not being able to do things--scouting things. Mightn't a girl do a good turn?\"  \"Oh, sure,\" Pee-wee conceded.  \"But I suppose if it gave her very much pleasure it wouldn't be a good turn.\"  \"Oh, yes, it might,\" admitted Pee-wee, anxious to explain the science of good turns. \"This is the way it is. If you do a good turn it's sure to make you feel good--that you did it--see? But if you do it just for your own pleasure, then it's not a good turn. But Roy puts over a lot of nonsense about good turns. He does it just to make me mad--because I've made a sort of study of them--like.\"  Mary laughed in spite of herself.  \"He says it was a good thing when Tom threw a barrel stave in the Chinese laundry because it led to his being a scout. But that isn't logic. Do you know what logic is?\"  Mary thought she had a notion of what it was.  \"A thing that's bad can't be good, can it?\" Pee-wee persisted. \"Suppose you should hit me with a brick----\"  \"I wouldn't think of doing such a thing!\"  \"But suppose you did. And suppose the scouts came along and gave me first aid and after that I became a scout. Could you say you did me a good turn by hitting me with a brick because that way I got to be a scout? Roy--you got to be careful with him--you can't always tell when he's jollying.\"  Mary looked at him intently for a few seconds. \"Well, then,\" said she, \"since you've made a study of good turns tell me this. If Roy and Tom were to ask you to go with them on their long hike, would that be a good turn?\"  \"Sure it would, because it would have a sacrifice in it, don't you see?\"  \"How?\"  \"Because they'd do it just to please me--they wouldn't really want me.\"  \"Well,\" she laughed, \"Roy's good at making sacrifices.\"  \"Je-ru-salem!\" said Pee-wee, shaking his head almost incredulously at the idea of such good fortune; \"that'll be some trip. But you know what they say, and it's true--I got to admit it's true--that two's a company, three's a crowd.\"  \"It wouldn't be three,\" laughed Mary; \"it would only be two and a half.\"  She watched the sturdy figure as Pee-wee trudged along the gravel walk and down the street. He seemed even smaller than he had seemed on the veranda. And it was borne in upon her how much jollying he stood for and how many good things he missed just because he _was_ little, and how cheerful and generous-hearted he was withal.  The next morning Roy received a letter which read:  \"Dear Roy--I want you and Tom to ask Walter Harris to go with you. Please don't tell him that I asked you. You said you were going to name one of the cabins or one of the boats for me because I took so much interest. I'd rather have you do this. You can call it a good turn if you want to--a real one.  \"MARY TEMPLE.\"  Pee-wee Harris also received an envelope with an enclosure similar to many which he had received of late. He suspected their source. This one read as follows:      If you want to be a scout,     You must watch what you're about,       And never let a chance for mischief pass.     You may win the golden cross     If your ball you gayly toss       Through the middle of a neighbor's pane of glass.     CHAPTER IV  TOM AND ROY   The letter from Mary Temple fell on Camp Solitaire like a thunderbolt. Camp Solitaire was the name which Roy had given his own cosy little tent on the Blakeley lawn, and here he and Tom were packing duffel bags and sharpening belt axes ready for their long tramp when the note from Grantley Square was scaled to them by the postman as he made a short cut across the lawn.  \"What do you know about that?\" said Roy, clearly annoyed. \"We can't take _him_; he's too small. Who's going to take the responsibility? This is a team hike.\"  \"You don't suppose he put the idea in her head, do you?\" Tom asked.  \"Oh, I don't know. You saw yourself how crazy he was about it.\"  \"Pee-wee's all right,\" said Tom.  \"Sure he's all right. He's the best little camp mascot that ever happened. But how are we going to take him along on this hike? And what's he going to do when he gets there?\"  \"He could help us on the troop cabin--getting it ready,\" Tom suggested.  Roy threw the letter aside in disgust. \"That's a girl all over,\" he said, as he sulkily packed his duffel bag. \"She doesn't think of what it means--she just wants it done, that's all, so she sends her what-d'you-call-it--edict. Pee-wee can't stand for a hundred and forty mile hike. We'd have to get a baby carriage!\"  He went on with his packing, thrusting things into the depths of his duffel bag half-heartedly and with but a fraction of his usual skill. \"You know as well as I do about team hikes. How can we fix this up for three _now_? We've got everything ready and made all our plans; now it seems we've got to cart this kid along or be in Dutch up at Temple's. _He_ can't hike twenty miles a day. He's just got a bee in his dome that he'd like----\"  \"It _would_ be a good turn,\" interrupted Tom. \"I was counting on a team hike myself. I wanted to be off on a trip alone with you a while. I'm disappointed too, but it _would_ be a good turn--it would be a peach of a one, so far as that's concerned.\"  \"No, it wouldn't,\" contradicted Roy. \"It would be a piece of blamed foolishness.\"  \"He'd furnish some fun--he always does.\"  \"He'd furnish a lot of trouble and responsibility! Why can't he wait and come up with the rest? Makes me sick!\" Roy added, as he hurled the aluminum coffee-pot out of a chair and sat down disgustedly.  \"_Now_, you see, you dented that,\" said Tom.  \"A lot _I_ care. Gee, I'd like to call the whole thing off--that's what I'd like to do. I'd do it for two cents.\"  \"Well, I've got two cents,\" said Tom, \"but I'm not going to offer it. _I_ say, let's make the best of it. I've seen you holding your sides laughing at Pee-wee. You said yourself he was a five-reel photoplay all by himself.\"  Roy drew a long breath and said nothing. He was plainly in his very worst humor. He did not want Pee-wee to go. He, too, wanted to be alone with Tom. There were plenty of good turns to be done without bothering with this particular one. Besides, it was not a good turn, he told himself. It would expose Walter Harris to perils---- Oh, Roy was very generous and considerate of Walter Harris----  \"If it's a question of good turns,\" he said, \"it would be a better turn to leave him home, where he'll be safe and happy. It's no good turn to him, dragging him up and down mountains till he's so dog-tired he falls all over himself--is it?\"  Tom smiled a little, but said nothing.  \"Oh, well, if that's the"]]]
