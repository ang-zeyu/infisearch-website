In 1641 they began their elegant piracies of French plays and poetry with ‘Le Cid.’  It was worth while being pirated by the Elzevirs, who turned you out like a gentleman, with _fleurons_ and red letters, and a pretty frontispiece.  The modern pirate dresses you in rags, prints you murderously, and binds you, if he binds you at all, in some hideous example of “cloth extra,” all gilt, like archaic gingerbread.  Bonaventure and Abraham both died in 1652.  They did not depart before publishing (1628), in _grand format_, a desirable work on fencing, Thibault’s ‘Académie de l’Espée.’  This Tibbald also killed by the book.  John and Daniel Elzevir came next.  They brought out the ‘Imitation’ (Thomæ a Kempis canonici regularis ord.  S. Augustini De Imitatione Christi, libri iv.); I wish by taking thought I could add eight millimetres to the stature of my copy.  In 1655 Daniel joined a cousin, Louis, in Amsterdam, and John stayed in Leyden.  John died in 1661; his widow struggled on, but her son Abraham (1681) let all fall into ruins.  Abraham died 1712.  The Elzevirs of Amsterdam lasted till 1680, when Daniel died, and the business was wound up.  The type, by Christopher Van Dyck, was sold in 1681, by Daniel’s widow.  _Sic transit gloria_.     [Picture: Elzevir title-page of the ‘Imitation’ of Thomas à Kempis]  After he has learned all these matters the amateur has still a great deal to acquire.  He may now know a real Elzevir from a book which is not an Elzevir at all.  But there are enormous differences of value, rarity, and excellence among the productions of the Elzevirian press.  The bookstalls teem with small, “cropped,” dingy, dirty, battered Elzevirian editions of the classics, _not_ “of the good date.”  On these it is not worth while to expend a couple of shillings, especially as Elzevirian type is too small to be read with comfort by most modern eyes.  No, let the collector save his money; avoid littering his shelves with what he will soon find to be rubbish, and let him wait the chance of acquiring a really beautiful and rare Elzevir.  Meantime, and before we come to describe Elzevirs of the first flight, let it be remembered that the “taller” the copy, the less harmed and nipped by the binder’s shears, the better.  “Men scarcely know how beautiful fire is,” says Shelley; and we may say that most men hardly know how beautiful an Elzevir was in its uncut and original form.  The Elzevirs we have may be “dear,” but they are certainly “dumpy twelves.” Their fair proportions have been docked by the binder.  At the Beckford sale there was a pearl of a book, a ‘Marot;’ not an Elzevir, indeed, but a book published by Wetstein, a follower of the Elzevirs.  This exquisite pair of volumes, bound in blue morocco, was absolutely unimpaired, and was a sight to bring happy tears into the eyes of the amateur of Elzevirs.  There was a gracious _svelte_ elegance about these tomes, an appealing and exquisite delicacy of proportion, that linger like sweet music in the memory.  I have a copy of the Wetstein ‘Marot’ myself, not a bad copy, though murderously bound in that ecclesiastical sort of brown calf antique, which goes well with hymn books, and reminds one of cakes of chocolate.  But my copy is only some 128 millimetres in height, whereas the uncut Beckford copy (it had belonged to the great Pixérécourt) was at least 130 millimetres high.  Beside the uncut example mine looks like Cinderella’s plain sister beside the beauty of the family.  Now the moral is that only tall Elzevirs are beautiful, only tall Elzevirs preserve their ancient proportions, only tall Elzevirs are worth collecting.  Dr. Lemuel Gulliver remarks that the King of Lilliput was taller than any of his court by almost the breadth of a nail, and that his altitude filled the minds of all with awe.  Well, the Philistine may think a few millimetres, more or less, in the height of an Elzevir are of little importance.  When he comes to sell, he will discover the difference.  An uncut, or almost uncut, copy of a good Elzevir may be worth fifty or sixty pounds or more; an ordinary copy may bring fewer pence.  The binders usually pare down the top and bottom more than the sides.  I have a ‘Rabelais’ of the good date, with the red title (1663), and some of the pages have never been opened, at the sides.  But the height is only some 122 millimetres, a mere dwarf.  Anything over 130 millimetres is very rare.  Therefore the collector of Elzevirs should have one of those useful ivory-handled knives on which the French measures are marked, and thus he will at once be able to satisfy himself as to the exact height of any example which he encounters.  Let us now assume that the amateur quite understands what a proper Elzevir should be: tall, clean, well bound if possible, and of the good date.  But we have still to learn what the good dates are, and this is matter for the study and practice of a well-spent life.  We may gossip about a few of the more famous Elzevirs, those without which no collection is complete.  Of all Elzevirs the most famous and the most expensive is an old cookery book, “‘Le Pastissier François.’  Wherein is taught the way to make all sorts of pastry, useful to all sorts of persons.  Also the manner of preparing all manner of eggs, for fast-days, and other days, in more than sixty fashions.  Amsterdam, Louys, and Daniel Elsevier. 1665.”  The mark is not the old “Sage,” but the “Minerva” with her owl.  Now this book has no intrinsic value any more than a Tauchnitz reprint of any modern volume on cooking.  The ‘Pastissier’ is cherished because it is so very rare.  The tract passed into the hands of cooks, and the hands of cooks are detrimental to literature.  Just as nursery books, fairy tales, and the like are destroyed from generation to generation, so it happens with books used in the kitchen.  The ‘Pastissier,’ to be sure, has a good frontispiece, a scene in a Low Country kitchen, among the dead game and the dainties. The buxom cook is making a game pie; a pheasant pie, decorated with the bird’s head and tail-feathers, is already made. {12}                          [Picture: Elzevir ‘Sage’]  Not for these charms, but for its rarity, is the ‘Pastissier’ coveted. In an early edition of the ‘Manuel’ (1821) Brunet says, with a feigned brutality (for he dearly loved an Elzevir), “Till now I have disdained to admit this book into my work, but I have yielded to the prayers of amateurs.  Besides, how could I keep out a volume which was sold for one hundred and one francs in 1819?”  One hundred and one francs!  If I could only get a ‘Pastissier’ for one hundred and one francs!  But our grandfathers lived in the Bookman’s Paradise.  “Il n’est pas jusqu’aux Anglais,” adds Brunet—“the very English themselves—have a taste for the ‘Pastissier.’”  The Duke of Marlborough’s copy was actually sold for £1 4s.  It would have been money in the ducal pockets of the house of Marlborough to have kept this volume till the general sale of all their portable property at which our generation is privileged to assist.  No wonder the ‘Pastissier’ was thought rare.  Bérard only knew two copies. Pietiers, writing on the Elzevirs in 1843, could cite only five ‘Pastissiers,’ and in his ‘Annales’ he had found out but five more. Willems, on the other hand, enumerates some thirty, not including Motteley’s.  Motteley was an uncultivated, untaught enthusiast.  He knew no Latin, but he had a _flair_ for uncut Elzevirs.  “Incomptis capillis,” he would cry (it was all his lore) as he gloated over his treasures. They were all burnt by the Commune in the Louvre Library.  A few examples may be given of the prices brought by ‘Le Pastissier’ in later days.  Sensier’s copy was but 128 millimetres in height, and had the old ordinary vellum binding,—in fact, it closely resembled a copy which Messrs. Ellis and White had for sale in Bond Street in 1883.  The English booksellers asked, I think, about 1,500 francs for their copy. Sensier’s was sold for 128 francs in April, 1828; for 201 francs in 1837. Then the book was gloriously bound by Trautz-Bauzonnet, and was sold with Potier’s books in 1870, when it fetched 2,910 francs.  At the Benzon sale (1875) it fetched 3,255 francs, and, falling dreadfully in price, was sold again in 1877 for 2,200 francs.  M. Dutuit, at Rouen, has a taller copy, bound by Bauzonnet.  Last time it was sold (1851) it brought 251 francs.  The Duc de Chartres has now the copy of Pieters, the historian of the Elzevirs, valued at 3,000 francs.  About thirty years ago no fewer than three copies were sold at Brighton, of all places.  M. Quentin Bauchart had a copy only 127 millimetres in height, which he swopped to M. Paillet.  M. Chartener, of Metz, had a copy now bound by Bauzonnet which was sold for four francs in 1780.  We call this the age of cheap books, but before the Revolution books were cheaper.  It is fair to say, however, that this example of the ‘Pastissier’ was then bound up with another book, Vlacq’s edition of ‘Le Cuisinier François,’ and so went cheaper than it would otherwise have done.  M. de Fontaine de Resbecq declares that a friend of his bought six original pieces of Molière’s bound up with an old French translation of Garth’s ‘Dispensary.’  The one faint hope left to the poor book collector is that he may find a valuable tract lurking in the leaves of some bound collection of trash.  I have an original copy of Molière’s ‘Les Fascheux’ bound up with a treatise on precious stones, but the bookseller from whom I bought it knew it was there!  That made all the difference.  But, to return to our ‘Pastissier,’ here is M. de Fontaine de Resbecq’s account of how he wooed and won his own copy of this illustrious Elzevir. “I began my walk to-day,” says this haunter of ancient stalls, “by the Pont Marie and the Quai de la Grève, the pillars of Hercules of the book-hunting world.  After having viewed and reviewed these remote books, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1961"],["title","Books and Bookmen (#2)"],["body","was going away, when my attention was caught by a small naked volume, without a stitch of binding.  I seized it, and what was my delight when I recognised one of the rarest of that famed Elzevir collection whose height is measured as minutely as the carats of the diamond.  There was no indication of price on the box where this jewel was lying; the book, though unbound, was perfectly clean within.  ‘How much?’ said I to the bookseller.  ‘You can have it for six sous,’ he answered; ‘is it too much?’  ‘No,’ said I, and, trembling a little, I handed him the thirty centimes he asked for the ‘Pastissier François.’  You may believe, my friend, that after such a piece of luck at the start, one goes home fondly embracing the beloved object of one’s search.  That is exactly what I did.”  Can this tale be true?  Is such luck given by the jealous fates _mortalibus ægris_?  M. de Resbecq’s find was made apparently in 1856, when trout were plenty in the streams, and rare books not so very rare. To my own knowledge an English collector has bought an original play of Molière’s, in the original vellum, for eighteenpence.  But no one has such luck any longer.  Not, at least, in London.  A more expensive ‘Pastissier’ than that which brought six sous was priced in Bachelin-Deflorenne’s catalogue at £240.  A curious thing occurred when two uncut ‘Pastissiers’ turned up simultaneously in Paris.  One of them Morgand and Fatout sold for £400.  Clever people argued that one of the twin uncut ‘Pastissiers’ must be an imitation, a facsimile by means of photogravure, or some other process.  But it was triumphantly established that both were genuine; they had minute points of difference in the ornaments.  M. Willems, the learned historian of the Elzevirs, is indignant at the successes of a book which, as Brunet declares, is badly printed.  There must be at least forty known ‘Pastissiers’ in the world.  Yes; but there are at least 4,000 people who would greatly rejoice to possess a ‘Pastissier,’ and some of these desirous ones are very wealthy.  While this state of the market endures, the ‘Pastissier’ will fetch higher prices than the other varieties.  Another extremely rare Elzevir is ‘L’Illustre Théâtre de Mons. Corneille’ (Leyden, 1644).  This contains ‘Le Cid,’ ‘Les Horaces,’ ‘Le Cinna,’ ‘La Mort de Pompée,’ ‘Le Polyeucte.’ The name, ‘L’Illustre Théâtre,’ appearing at that date has an interest of its own.  In 1643–44, Molière and Madeleine Béjart had just started the company which they called ‘L’Illustre Théâtre.’  Only six or seven copies of the book are actually known, though three or four are believed to exist in England, probably all covered with dust in the library of some lord.  “He has a very good library,” I once heard some one say to a noble earl, whose own library was famous.  “And what can a fellow do with a very good library?” answered the descendant of the Crusaders, who probably (being a youth light-hearted and content) was ignorant of his own great possessions.  An expensive copy of ‘L’Illustre Théâtre,’ bound by Trautz-Bauzonnet, was sold for £300.  Among Elzevirs desirable, yet not hopelessly rare, is the ‘Virgil’ of 1636.  Heinsius was the editor of this beautiful volume, prettily printed, but incorrect.  Probably it is hard to correct with absolute accuracy works in the clear but minute type which the Elzevirs affected. They have won fame by the elegance of their books, but their intention was to sell good books cheap, like Michel Lévy.  The small type was required to get plenty of “copy” into little bulk.  Nicholas Heinsius, the son of the editor of the ‘Virgil,’ when he came to correct his father’s edition, found that it contained so many coquilles, or misprints, as to be nearly the most incorrect copy in the world.  Heyne says, “Let the ‘Virgil’ be one of the rare Elzevirs, if you please, but within it has scarcely a trace of any good quality.”  Yet the first edition of this beautiful little book, with its two passages of red letters, is so desirable that, till he could possess it, Charles Nodier would not profane his shelves by any ‘Virgil’ at all.  Equally fine is the ‘Cæsar’ of 1635, which, with the ‘Virgil’ of 1636 and the ‘Imitation’ without date, M. Willems thinks the most successful works of the Elzevirs, “one of the most enviable jewels in the casket of the bibliophile.”  It may be recognised by the page 238, which is erroneously printed 248.  A good average height is from 125 to 128 millimetres.  The highest known is 130 millimetres.  This book, like the ‘Imitation,’ has one of the pretty and ingenious frontispieces which the Elzevirs prefixed to their books.  So farewell, and good speed in your sport, ye hunters of Elzevirs, and may you find perhaps the rarest Elzevir of all, ‘L’Aimable Mère de Jésus.’     _BALLADE OF THE REAL AND IDEAL_. (DOUBLE REFRAIN.)      O VISIONS of salmon tremendous,    Of trout of unusual weight,    Of waters that wander as Ken does,    Ye come through the Ivory Gate!    But the skies that bring never a “spate,”    But the flies that catch up in a thorn,    But the creel that is barren of freight,    Through the portals of horn!     O dreams of the Fates that attend us    With prints in the earliest state,    O bargains in books that they send us,    Ye come through the Ivory Gate!    But the tome that has never a mate,    But the quarto that’s tattered and torn,    And bereft of a title and date,    Through the portals of horn!     O dreams of the tongues that commend us,    Of crowns for the laureate pate,    Of a public to buy and befriend us,    Ye come through the Ivory Gate!    But the critics that slash us and slate, {19}    But the people that hold us in scorn,    But the sorrow, the scathe, and the hate,    Through the portals of horn!                                    ENVOY.     Fair dreams of things golden and great,    Ye come through the Ivory Gate;    But the facts that are bleak and forlorn,    Through the portals of horn!     _CURIOSITIES OF PARISH REGISTERS_.   THERE are three classes of persons who are deeply concerned with parish registers—namely, villains, antiquaries, and the sedulous readers, “parish clerks and others,” of the second or “agony” column of the Times. Villains are probably the most numerous of these three classes.  The villain of fiction dearly loves a parish register: he cuts out pages, inserts others, intercalates remarks in a different coloured ink, and generally manipulates the register as a Greek manages his hand at _écarté_, or as a Hebrew dealer in Moabite bric-à-brac treats a synagogue roll.  We well remember one villain who had locked himself into the vestry (he was disguised as an archæologist), and who was enjoying his wicked pleasure with the register, when the vestry somehow caught fire, the rusty key would not turn in the door, and the villain was roasted alive, in spite of the disinterested efforts to save him made by all the virtuous characters in the story.  Let the fate of this bold, bad man be a warning to wicked earls, baronets, and all others who attempt to destroy the record of the marriage of a hero’s parents.  Fate will be too strong for them in the long run, though they bribe the parish clerk, or carry off in white wax an impression of the keys of the vestry and of the iron chest in which a register should repose.  There is another and more prosaic danger in the way of villains, if the new bill, entitled “The Parish Registers Preservation Act,” ever becomes law.  The bill provides that every register earlier than 1837 shall be committed to the care of the Master of the Rolls, and removed to the Record Office.  Now the common villain of fiction would feel sadly out of place in the Register Office, where a more watchful eye than that of a comic parish clerk would be kept on his proceedings.  Villains and local antiquaries will, therefore, use all their parliamentary influence to oppose and delay this bill, which is certainly hard on the parish archæologist.  The men who grub in their local registers, and slowly compile parish or county history, deserve to be encouraged rather than depressed.  Mr. Chester Waters, therefore, has suggested that copies of registers should be made, and the comparatively legible copy left in the parish, while the crabbed original is conveyed to the Record Office in London.  Thus the local antiquary would really have his work made more easy for him (though it may be doubted whether he would quite enjoy that condescension), while the villain of romance would be foiled; for it is useless (as a novel of Mr. Christie Murray’s proves) to alter the register in the keeping of the parish when the original document is safe in the Record Office.  But previous examples of enforced transcription (as in 1603) do not encourage us to suppose that the copies would be very scrupulously made.  Thus, after the Reformation, the prayers for the dead in the old registers were omitted by the copyist, who seemed to think (as the contractor for “sandwich men” said to the poor fellows who carried the letter H), “I don’t want you, and the public don’t want you, and you’re no use to nobody.”  Again, when Laurence Fletcher was buried in St. Saviour’s, Southwark, in 1608, the old register described him as “a player, the King’s servant.”  But the clerk, keeping a note-book, simply called Laurence Fletcher “a man,” and (in 1625) he also styled Mr. John Fletcher “a man.”  Now, the old register calls Mr. John Fletcher “a poet.”  To copy all the parish registers in England would be a very serious task, and would probably be but slovenly performed.  If they were reproduced, again, by any process of photography, the old difficult court hand would remain as hard as ever.  But this is a minor objection, for the local antiquary revels in the old court hand.  From the little volume by Mr. Chester Waters, already referred to (‘Parish Registers in England;’ printed for the author by F. J. Roberts, Little Britain, E.C.), we proceed "]]]
