It was noteworthy that whenever any effort had to be put forth, however small, the tall man stepped forward and the hunchback looked on.  It was Captain Jemmy, for instance, who had, a moment before, pushed back the gate.  He had to tug thrice before a discordant bell sounded within the house, and twice again before footsteps began to shuffle along the passage.  A bolt was let down and the big door fell open, disclosing a small serving-girl, who stared upon the visitors with round eyes.  \"Is your mistress within?\"  \"Mistress Salt is within, sirs; but--\"  \"But what?\"  \"She--she can't see you!\" The girl burst into tears.  \"Who the devil asked her to see us?\" rapped out Captain Barker.  \"You are to take these two letters,\" interposed Captain Runacles. Each captain held out his letter.  \"You are to take these two--blow your nose and dry your eyes--letters to your mistress at once--mind you, _at once_--and together--_together_, you understand, and--what in thunder are you whimpering about?\"  \"I c-c-can't, sirs.\"  \"Can't!  Why, in the name of--don't drip on 'em, I tell you!  Why, in the name of--\"  The iron gate creaked behind them, and the two captains turned their heads.  A portly, broad-shouldered gentleman, in a suit of snuff colour, came slowly across the court, with both hands behind him, and a cane rapping against his heels.  \"Dr. Beckerleg.\"  \"Hey?  Why--Captain Barker!  Captain Runacles!  Glad to see you both--glad to see you both home again!  Also I'd be glad to know what you're both doing here, at such a time.\"  The captains looked at each other and coughed.  They turned towards the doorway.  The serving-girl had disappeared, taking their letters with her.  Captain Barker faced round upon the Doctor.  \"You said 'at such a time,' sir.\"  \"I did.\"  \"And why not at this time, as well as another?\"  \"God bless me! Is it possible you don't know?\"  \"It is not only possible, but certain.\"  The Doctor bent his head, pointed up at a window, and whispered; then went softly up the three steps into the house.  He left the two friends staring at each other.  They stood and stared at each other for three minutes or more.  Then Captain Barker spoke in a hoarse whisper.  \"Jemmy, do you know anything about this--this kind of business?\"  \"Nothing.  I was abroad, you know, when my own little maid--\"  \"Yes, I remember.  But I thought, perhaps--say, I can't go home till--till I've seen the Doctor again.\"  \"Nor I.\"  A dull moan sounded within the house.  \"Oh, my God!\" groaned Captain Runacles; \"Meg--Meg!\"  A lattice was opened softly above them and the doctor leant out.  \"Go away--you two!\" he whispered and waved his hand towards the gate.  \"But, Doctor--\"  \"H'sh! I'll come and tell you when it's over.  Where shall you be?\"  \"At the Three Crowns, down the street here.\"  \"Right.\"  The lattice was closed again very gently.  Captain Barker laid his hand upon the tall man's sleeve.  \"Jemmy, we're out of this action.  I thought I knew what it meant to lay-to and have to look on while a fight went forward; but I didn't. Come--\"  They passed out of the courtyard and down the street towards the Three Crowns.  Beneath the sign of that inn there lounged a knot of officers wearing the flesh-coloured facings of the Buffs, and within a young baritone voice was uplifted and trolling, to the accompaniment of clinking glasses, a song of Mr. Shirley's:       You virgins that did late despair         To keep your wealth from cruel men,      Tie up in silk your careless hair:         Soft Peace is come again! . . .  There was one sitting-room but no bedroom to be had at the Three Crowns.  So they ordered up a dinner which they could not touch, but sat over in silence for two weary hours, drinking very much more burgundy than they were aware of.  Captain Jemmy, taking up three bottles one after another and finding them all empty, ordered up three more, and drew his chair up to the hearth, where he sat kicking the oaken logs viciously with his long legs.  The little hunchback stared out on the falling night, rang for candles, and began to pace the room like a caged beast.  Before midnight Captain Runacles was drunk.  Six fresh bottles stood on the table.  The man was a cask.  Even in the warm firelight his face was pale as a sheet, and his lips worked continually.  Captain Barker still walked up and down, but his thin legs would not always move in a straight line.  His eyes glared like two globes of green fire, and he began to knock against the furniture.  Few men can wait helplessly and come out of it with credit.  Every time Captain John hit himself against the furniture Captain Jemmy cursed him.       Tie up in silk your careless hair;         Soft Peace is come again!  --Sang the little man, in a rasping voice.  \"Your careless hair,\" he hiccoughed; \"your careless hair, Meg!\"  Then he sat down on the floor and laughed to himself softly, rocking his distorted body to and fro.  \"Bah!\" said his friend, without looking round.  \"You're drunk.\" And he poured out more burgundy.  He was outrageously drunk himself, but it only affected his temper, not his wits.  \"Meg,\" he said, \"will live.  What's more, she'll live to marry me.\"  \"She won't.  She'll die.  Hist! there's a star falling outside.\"  He picked himself up and crawled upon the window-seat, clutching at the red curtains to keep his footing.  \"Jemmy, she'll die! What was it that old fool said to-day? The door's closing on us both.  To think of our marching up, just now, with those two letters; and the very sun in heaven cracking his cheeks with laughter at us--us two poor scarecrows making love thirty years after the time!\"  His wry head dropped forward on his chest.  After this the two kept silence.  The rest of the house had long since gone to rest, and the sound of muffled snoring alone marked the time as it passed, except when Captain Jemmy, catching up another oak log, drove it into the fire with his heel; or out in the street the watch went by, chanting the hour; or a tipsy shouting broke out in some distant street, or the noise of dogs challenging each other from their kennels across the sleeping town.  A shudder of light ran across the heavens, and over against the window Captain Barker saw the east grow pale.  For some while the stars had been blotted out and light showers had fallen at intervals. Heavy clouds were banked across the river, behind Shotley; and the roofs began to glisten as they took the dawn.  Footsteps sounded on the roadway outside.  He pushed open the window and looked out.  Doctor Beckerleg was coming up the street, his hat pushed back and his neckcloth loosened as he respired the morning air.  The footsteps paused underneath, by the inn door; but the little Captain leant back in the window-seat without making a sign.  He had seen the Doctor's face.  Before the fire Captain Jemmy brooded, with chin on breast, hands grasping the chair-rail and long legs stretched out, one on each side of the hearth.  The knocking below did not rouse him from this posture, nor the creaking of feet on the stairs.   Doctor Beckerleg stood in the doorway and for a moment contemplated the scene--the empty bottles, the unsnuffed candles guttering down upon the table, and the grey faces of both drunken men.  Then he turned and whispered a word to the drawer, who had hurried out of bed to admit him and now stood behind his shoulder.  The fellow shuffled downstairs.  Captain Barker struggled with a question that was dried up in his throat.  Before he could get it out the Doctor shook his head.  \"She is dead,\" he announced, very gravely and simply.  The hunchback shivered.  Captain Runacles neither spoke nor stirred in his chair.  \"A man-child was born at two o'clock.  He is alive: his mother died two hours later.\"  Captain Barker shivered again, plucked aimlessly at a rosette in the window-cushion, and stole a quick glance at his comrade's back. Then, putting a finger to his lip, he slid down to the floor and lurched across to the Doctor.  \"She was left penniless?\" he whispered.  \"That, or almost that, 'tis said,\" replied Dr. Beckerleg in the same key, though the question obviously surprised him.  \"Her father left his money to the town, as all know--\"  \"Yes, yes; I knew that.  Her husband--\"  \"Hadn't a penny-piece, I believe: pawned her own mother's jewels and gambled 'em away; thereupon left her, as a dog his cleaned bone.\"  The little man laid a hand on his collar, and as the doctor stooped whispered low and rapidly in his ear.  Their colloquy was interrupted.  \"I'll adopt that child!\" said Captain Runacles from the hearth. He spoke aloud, but without turning his head.  Captain Barker hopped round, as if a pin were stuck into him.  \"You!--adopt Meg's boy!\"  \"I said that.\"  \"But you won't.\"  \"I shall.\"  \"I'm sorry to disappoint you, Jemmy; but I intend to adopt him myself.\"  \"I know it.  You were whispering as much to the Doctor there.\"  \"You have a little girl already.\"  \"Precisely.  That's where the difference comes in.  This one, you'll note, is a boy.\"  \"A child of your own!\"  \"But not of Meg's.\"  Captain Runacles turned in his chair as he said this, and, reaching a hand back to the table, drained the last bottle of burgundy into his glass.  His face was white as a sheet and his jaw set like iron. \"But not of Meg's,\" he repeated, lifting the glass and nodding over it at the pair.  His friend swayed into a chair and sat facing him, his chin but just above the table and his green eyes glaring like an owl's.  \"Jemmy Runacles, _I_ adopt that boy!\"  \"You're cursedly obstinate, Jack.\"  \"Having adopted him, I shall at once quit my profession and devote the residue of my life to his education.  For a year or two--that is, until he reaches an age susceptible of tuition--I shall mature a scheme of discipline, which--\"  \"My dear sir,\" the Doctor interposed, \"surely all this is somewhat precipitate.\"  \"Not at all.

And in another place he says: \"Some say that He was born on the 24th or 25th of the month Pharmuthi,\" which would be the 19th or 20th of April.  [Footnote 1: _Stromat._, L. 1, pp. 407-408, ed. Oxon., 1715.]  But, perhaps, the best source of information is from the _Mémoires pour servir à l'histoire ecclésiastique des six premiers Siècles_, by Louis Sebastian le Nain de Tillemont, written at the very commencement of the eighteenth century,[2] and I have no hesitation in appending a portion of his fourth note, which treats \"_Upon the day and year of the birth of Jesus Christ_.\"  [Footnote 2: Translated by T. Deacon in 1733-35, pp. 335-336.]  \"It is thought that Jesus Christ was born in the night, because it was night when the angel declared His birth to the shepherds: in which S. Augustin says that He literally fulfilled David's words, _Ante luciferum genuite_.  \"The tradition of the Church, says this father, is that it was upon the 25th of December. Casaubon acknowledges that we should not immediately reject it upon the pretence that it is too cold a season for cattle to be at pasture, there being a great deal of difference between these countries and Judæa; and he assures us that, even in England, they leave the cows in the field all the year round.  \"S. Chrysostom alleges several reasons to prove that Jesus Christ was really born upon the 25th of December; but they are weak enough, except that which he assures of, that it has always been the belief of the Western Churches. S. Epiphanius, who will have the day to have been the 6th of January, places it but at twelve days' distance. S. Clement of Alexandria says that, in his time, some fixed the birth of Jesus Christ upon the 19th or 20th April; others, on the 20th of May. He speaks of it as not seeing anything certain in it.  \"It is cited from one John of Nice, that it was only under Pope Julius that the Festival of the Nativity was fixed at Rome upon the 25th of December. Father Combesisius, who has published the epistle of this author, confesses that he is very modern: to which we may add that he is full of idle stories, and entirely ignorant of the history and discipline of antiquity. So that it is better to rest upon the testimony of S. Chrysostom, who asserts that, for a long time before, and by very ancient tradition, it was celebrated upon the 25th of December in the West, that is, in all the countries which reach from Thrace to Cadiz, and to the farthest parts of Spain. He names Rome particularly; and thinks that it might be found there that this was the true day of our Saviour's birth, by consulting the registers of the description of Judæa made at that time, supposing them still to be preserved there. We find this festival placed upon the 25th of December in the ancient Roman Calendar, which was probably made in the year 354....  \"We find by S. Basil's homily upon the birth of our Lord that a festival in commemoration of it was observed in Cappadocia, provided that this homily is all his; but I am not of opinion that it appears from thence either that this was done in January rather than December or any other month in the year, or that this festival was joined with that of the Baptism. On the contrary, the Churches of Cappadocia seem to have distinguished the Feast of the Nativity from that of the Epiphany, for S. Gregory Nazianzen says, that after he had been ordained priest, in the year 361, upon the festival of one mystery, he retired immediately after into Pontus, on that of another mystery, and returned from Pontus upon that of a third. Now we find that he returned at Easter, so that there is all imaginable reason to believe that he was ordained at Christmas, and retired upon the Epiphany. S. Basil died, in all probability, upon the 1st of January in the year 379, and S. Gregory Nyssen says that his festival followed close upon those of Christmas, S. Stephen, S. Peter, S. James, and S. John. We read in an oration ascribed to S. Amphilochius, that he died on the day of the Circumcision, between the Nativity of Jesus Christ and His Baptism. S. Gregory Nyssen says that the Feast of Lights, and of the Baptism of Jesus Christ, was celebrated some days after that of His Nativity. The other S. Gregory takes notice of several mysteries which were commemorated at Nazianzium with the Nativity, the Magi, etc., but he says nothing, in that place, of the Baptism. And yet, if the festival of Christmas was observed in Cappadocia upon the 25th of December, we must say that S. Chrysostom was ignorant of it, since he ascribes this practice only to Thrace and the more Western provinces....  \"In the year 377, or soon after, some persons who came from Rome, introduced into Syria the practice of celebrating our Lord's Nativity in the month of December, upon the same day as was done in the West; and this festival was so well received in that country that in less than ten years it was entirely established at Antioch, and was observed there by all the people with great solemnity, though some complained of it as an innovation. S. Chrysostom, who informs us of all this, speaks of it in such a manner as to make Father Thomassin say, not that the birth of Jesus Christ had till then been kept upon a wrong day, but that absolutely it had not been celebrated there at all.  \"S. Chrysostom seems to say, that this festival was received at the same time by the neighbouring provinces to Antioch; but this must not be extended as far as to Egypt, as we learn from a passage in Cassian. This author seems to speak only of the time when he was in Scetæ (about 399), but also of that when he wrote his tenth conference (about the year 420 or 425). But it appears that, in the year 432, Egypt had likewise embraced the practice of Rome: for Paul of Emesa, in the discourse which he made then at Alexandria upon the 29th of Coiac, which is the 25th of December, says it was the day on which Jesus Christ was born. S. Isidore of Pelusium, in Egypt, mentions the Theophany and the Nativity of our Saviour, according to the flesh, as two different festivals. We were surprised to read in an oration of Basil of Seleucia, upon S. Stephen, that Juvenal of Jerusalem, who might be made bishop about the year 420, was the first who celebrated there our Saviour's Nativity.\"  The Armenian Church still keeps up the eastern 6th of January as Christmas day--and, as the old style of the calendar is retained, it follows that they celebrate the Nativity twenty-four days after we do: and modern writers make the matter more mixed--for Wiesseler thinks that the date of the Nativity was 10th January, whilst Mr. Greswell says it occurred on the 9th April B.C. 4.  It is not everybody that knows that our system of chronology is four years wrong--_i.e._ that Jesus Christ must have been born four years before _Anno Domini_, the year of our Lord. It happened in this way. Dionysius Exiguus, in 533, first introduced the system of writing the words _Anno Domini_, to point out the number of years which had elapsed since the Incarnation of our Lord; in other words he introduced our present chronology. He said the year 1 was the same as the year A.U.C. (from the building of Rome) 754; and this statement he based on the fact that our Saviour was born in the twenty-eighth year of the reign of Augustus; and he reckoned from A.U.C. 727, when the emperor first took the name of Augustus. The early Christians, however, dated from the battle of Actium, which was A.U.C. 723, thus making the Nativity 750. Now we believe that that event took place during Herod's reign, and we know that Herod died between the 13th March and 29th March, on which day Passover commenced, in A.U.C. 750, so that it stands to reason that our chronology is wrong.  Some think that the date of 25th December, which certainly began in the Roman Church, was fixed upon to avoid the multiplication of festivals about the vernal equinox, and to appropriate to a Christian use the existing festival of the winter solstice--the returning sun being made symbolical of the visit of Christ to our earth; and to withdraw Christian converts from those pagan observances with which the closing year was crowded, whilst the licence of the _Saturnalia_ was turned into the merriment of Christmas.  This festival of the Saturnalia (of which the most complete account is given by Macrobius in his _Conviviorum Saturnaliorum_) dated from the remotest settlement of Latium, whose people reverenced Saturnus as the author of husbandry and the arts of life. At this festival the utmost freedom of social intercourse was permitted to all classes; even slaves were allowed to come to the tables of their masters clothed in their apparel, and were waited on by those whom they were accustomed to serve. Feasting, gaming, and revelry were the occupations of all classes, without discrimination of age, or sex, or rank. Processions crowded the streets, boisterous with mirth: these illuminated the night with lighted tapers of wax, which were also used as gifts between friends in the humbler walks of life. The season was one for the exchange of gifts of friendship, and especially of gifts to children. It began on the 17th December, and extended virtually, to the commencement of the New Year.  Prynne[3] speaks thus of Christmas: \"If we compare our Bacchanalian Christmasses and New Year's Tides with these Saturnalia and Feasts of Janus, we shall finde such near affinytie betweene them both in regard of time (they being both in the end of December and on the first of January), and in their manner of solemnizing (both of them being spent in revelling, epicurisme, wantonesse, idlenesse, dancing, drinking, stage playes, and such other Christmas disorders now in use with Christians), were derived from these Roman Saturnalia and Bacchanalian Festivals; which should cause all pious Christians eternally to abominate them.\"  ["]]]
