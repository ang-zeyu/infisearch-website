Bundle (commissioned by my father) had brought from the town for me; but when I had put all the round arches on the pairs of pillars, and had made a very successful \"Tower of Babel\" with cross layers of the bricks tapering towards the top, I had leisure to look round and listen.  \"I never know'd one with that look as lived,\" Mrs. Cadman was saying, in her hollow tone. \"It took notice from the first. Mark my words, ma'am, a sweeter child I never saw, but it's _too_ good and _too_ pretty to be long for this world.\"  It is difficult to say exactly how much one understands at four years old, or rather how far one quite comprehends the things one perceives in part. I understood, or felt, enough of what I heard, and of the sympathetic sighs that followed Mrs. Cadman's speech, to make me stumble over the Tower of Babel, and present myself at Mrs. Cadman's knee with the question--  \"Is mamma too pretty and good for this world, Mrs. Cadman?\"  I caught her elderly wink as quickly as the housekeeper, to whom it was directed. I was not completely deceived by her answer.  \"Why, bless his dear heart, Master Reginald. Who did he think I was talking about, love?\"  \"My new baby sister,\" said I, without hesitation.  \"No such thing, lovey,\" said the audacious Mrs. Cadman; \"housekeeper and me was talking about Mrs. Jones's little boy.\"  \"Where does Mrs. Jones live?\" I asked.  \"In London town, my dear.\"  I sighed. I knew nothing of London town, and could not prove that Mrs. Jones had no existence. But I felt dimly dissatisfied, in spite of a slice of sponge-cake, and being put to bed (for a treat) in papa's dressing-room. My sleep was broken by uneasy dreams, in which Mrs. Jones figured with the face of Mrs. Cadman and her hollow voice. I had a sensation that that night the house never went to rest. People came in and out with a pretentious purpose of not awaking me. My father never came to bed. I felt convinced that I heard the doctor's voice in the passage. At last, while it was yet dark, and when I seemed to have been sleeping and waking, waking and falling asleep again in my crib for weeks, my father came in with a strange look upon his face, and took me up in his arms, and wrapped a blanket round me, saying mamma wanted to kiss me, but I must be very good and make no noise. There was little fear of that! I gazed in utter silence at the sweet face that was whiter than the sheet below it, the hair that shone brighter than ever in the candlelight. Only when I kissed her, and she had laid her wan hand on my head, I whispered to my father, \"Why is mamma so cold?\"  With a smothered groan he carried me back to bed, and I cried myself to sleep. It was too true, then. She was too good and too pretty for this world, and before sunrise she was gone.  Before the day was ended Sister Alice left us also. She never knew a harder resting-place than our mother's arms.     CHAPTER II  \"THE LOOK\"--RUBENS--MRS. BUNDLE AGAIN   My widowed father and I were both terribly lonely. The depths of his loss in the lovely and lovable wife who had been his constant companion for nearly six years I could not fathom at the time. For my own part, I was quite as miserable as I have ever been since, and I doubt if I shall ever feel such overwhelming desolation again, unless the same sorrow befalls me as then befell him.  I \"fretted\"--as the servants expressed it--to such an extent as to affect my health; and I fancy it was because my father's attention was called to the fact that I was fast fading after the mother and sister whose death (and my own loneliness) I bewailed, that he roused himself from his own grief to comfort mine. Once more I was \"dressed\" after tea. Of late my bony nurse had not thought it necessary to go through this ceremony, and I had crept about in the same crape-covered frock from breakfast to bedtime.  Now I came down to dessert again, and though I think the empty place at the end of the table gave my father a fresh shock when I took my old post by him, yet I fancy the lonely evening was less lonely for my presence.  From his intense indulgence I think I dimly gathered that he thought me ill. I combined this in my mind with a speech of my nurse's that I had overheard, and which gave me the horrors at the time--\"He's got _the look_! It's his poor ma over again!\"--and I felt a sort of melancholy self-importance not uncommon with children who are out of health.  I may say here that my nurse had a quality very common amongst uneducated people. She was \"sensational;\" and her custom of going over all the circumstances of my mother's death and funeral (down to the price of the black paramatta of which her own dress was composed) with her friends, when she took me out walking, had not tended to make me happier or more cheerful.  That night I ate more from my father's plate than I had eaten for weeks. As I lay after dinner with my head upon his breast, he stroked my curls with a tender touch that seemed to heal my griefs, and said, almost in a tone of remorse,  \"What can papa do for you, my poor dear boy?\"  I looked up quickly into his face.  \"What would Regie like?\" he persisted.  I quite understood him now, and spoke out boldly the desires of my heart.  \"Please, papa, I should like Mrs. Bundle for a nurse; and I do very much want Rubens.\"  \"And who is Rubens?\" asked my father.  \"Oh, please, it's a dog,\" I said. \"It belongs to Mr. Mackenzie at the school. And it's such a little dear, all red and white; and it licked my face when nurse and I were there yesterday, and I put my hand in its mouth, and it rolled over on its back, and it's got long ears, and it followed me all the way home, and I gave it a piece of bread, and it can sit up, and\"--  \"But, my little man,\" interrupted my father--and he had absolutely smiled at my catalogue of marvels--\"if Rubens belongs to Mr. Mackenzie, and is such a wonderful fellow, I'm afraid Mr. Mackenzie won't part with him.\"  \"He would,\" I said, \"but--\" and I paused, for I feared the barrier was insurmountable.  \"But what?\" said my father.  \"He wants ten shillings for him, Nurse says.\"  \"If that's all, Regie,\" said my father, \"you and I will go and buy Rubens to-morrow morning.\"  Rubens was a little red and white spaniel of much beauty and sagacity. He was the prettiest, gentlest, most winning of playfellows. With him by my side, I now ran merrily about, instead of creeping moodily at the heels of nurse and her friends. Abundantly occupied in testing the tricks he knew, and teaching him new ones, I had the less leisure to listen open-mouthed to cadaverous gossip of the Cadman class. Finally, when I had bidden him good-night a hundred times, with absolutely fraternal embraces, I was soothed by the light weight of his head resting on my foot. He seemed to chase the hideous fancies which had hitherto passed from nurse's daytime conversation to trouble my night visions, as he would chase a water-fowl from a reedy marsh, and I slept--as he did--peacefully.  Nor was this all. My other wish was also to be fulfilled, but not without some vexations beforehand. It was by a certain air and tone which my nurse suddenly assumed towards me, and which it is difficult to describe by any other word than \"heighty-teighty,\" and also by dark hints of changes which she hoped (but seemed far from believing) would be for my good, and finally, by downright lamentations and tragic inquiries as to what she had done to be parted from her boy, and \"could her chickabiddy have the heart to drive away his loving and faithful nursey,\" that I learned that it was contemplated to supersede her by some one else, and that if she did not know that I was to blame in the matter, she at any rate believed me to have influence enough to obtain a reversal of the decree. That Mrs. Bundle was to be her successor I gathered from allusions to \"your great fat bouncing women that would eat their heads off; but as to cleaning out a nursery--let them see!\" But her most masterly stroke was a certain conversation with Mrs. Cadman carried on in my hearing.  \"Have you ever notice, Mrs. Cadman,\" inquired my bony nurse of her not less bony visitor--\"Have you ever notice how them stout people as looks so good-natured as if butter wouldn't melt in their mouths is that wicked and cruel underneath?\" And then followed a series of nurse's most ghastly anecdotes, relative to fat mothers who had ill-treated their children, fat nurses who had nearly been the death of their unfortunate charges, fat female murderers, and a fat acquaintance of her own, who was \"taken\" in apoplexy after a fit of rage with her husband.  \"What a warning! what a moral!\" said Mrs. Cadman. She meant it for a pious observation, but I felt that the warning and the moral were for me. And not even the presence of Rubens could dispel the darkness of my dreams that night.  Alternately goaded and caressed by my nurse, who now laid aside a habit she had of beating a tattoo with her knuckles on my head when I was naughty, to the intense confusion and irritation of my brain, I at last resolved to beg my father to let her remain with us. I felt that it was--as she had pointed out--intense ingratitude on my part to wish to part with her, and I said as much when I went down to dessert that evening. Morever, I now lived in vague fear of those terrible qualities which lay hidden beneath Mrs. Bundle's benevolent exterior.  \"If nurse has been teasing you about the matter,\" said my father, with a frown, \"that would decide me to get rid of her, if I had not so decided before. As to your not liking Mrs. Bundle now--My dear little son, you must learn to know your own mind. You told me you wanted Mrs. Bundle--by very good luck I have been able to get hold of her, and when she comes you must make the best of her.\"  She came the next day, and my bony nurse departed. She wept indignantly, I wept remorsefully, and then waited in terror for the manifestation of Mrs. Bundle's cruel propensities.  I waited in vain. The reign of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19859"],["title","A Flat Iron for a Farthing; or, Some Passages in the Life of an only Son (#2)"],["body","s. Bundle was a reign of peace and plenty, of loving-kindness and all good things. Moreover it was a reign of wholesomeness, both for body and mind. She did not give me cheese and beer from her own supper when she was in a good temper, nor pound my unfortunate head with her knuckles if I displeased her. She was strict in the maintenance of a certain old-fashioned nursery etiquette, which obliged me to put away my chair after meals, fold my clothes at bedtime, put away my toys when I had done with them, say \"please,\" \"thank you,\" grace before and after meals, prayers night and morning, a hymn in bed, and the Church Catechism on Sunday. She snubbed the maids who alluded in my presence to things I could not or should not understand, and she directed her own conversation to me, on matters suitable to my age, instead of talking over my childish head to her gossips. The stories of horror and crime, the fore-doomed babies, the murders, the mysterious whispered communications faded from my untroubled brain. Nurse Bundle's tales were of the young masters and misses she had known. Her worst domestic tragedy was about the boy who broke his leg over the chair he had failed to put away after breakfast. Her romances were the good old Nursery Legends of Dick Whittington, the Babes in the Wood, and so forth. My dreams became less like the columns of a provincial newspaper. I imagined myself another Marquis of Carabas, with Rubens in boots. I made a desert island in the garden, which only lacked the geography-book peculiarity of \"water all round\" it. I planted beans in the fond hope that they would tower to the skies and take me with them. I became--in fancy--Lord Mayor of London, and Mrs. Bundle shared my civic throne and dignities, and we gave Rubens six beefeaters and a barge to wait upon his pleasure.  Life, in short, was utterly changed for me. I grew strong, and stout, and well, and happy. And I loved Nurse Bundle.     CHAPTER III  THE DARK LADY--TROUBLE IMPENDING--BEAUTIFUL, GOLDEN MAMMA   So two years passed away. Nurse Bundle was still with me. With her I \"did lessons\" after a fashion. I learned to read, I had many of the Psalms and a good deal of poetry--sacred and secular--by heart. In an old-fashioned, but slow and thorough manner, I acquired the first outlines of geography, arithmetic, etc., and what Mrs. Bundle taught me I repeated to Rubens. But I don't think he ever learned the \"capital towns of Europe,\" though we studied them together under the same oak tree.  We had a happy two years of it together under the Bundle dynasty, and then trouble came.  I was never fond of demonstrative affection from strangers. The ladies who lavish kisses and flattery upon one's youthful head after eating papa's good dinner--keeping a sharp protective eye on their own silk dresses, and perchance pricking one with a brooch or pushing a curl into one eye with a kid-gloved finger--I held in unfeigned abhorrence. But over and above my natural instinct against the unloving fondling of drawing-room visitors, I had a special and peculiar antipathy to Miss Eliza Burton.  At first, I think I rather admired her. Her rolling eyes, the black hair plastered low upon her forehead,--the colour high, but never changeable or delicate--the amplitude and rustle of her skirts, the impressiveness of her manner, her very positive matureness, were just what the crude taste of childhood is apt to be fascinated by. She was the sister of my father's man of business; and she and her brother were visiting at my home. She really looked well in the morning, \"toned down\" by a fresh, summer muslin, and all womanly anxiety to relieve my father of the trouble of making the tea for breakfast.  \"Dear Mr. Dacre, _do_ let me relieve you of that task,\" she cried, her ribbons fluttering over the sugar-basin. \"I never like to see a gentleman sacrificing himself for his guests at breakfast. You have enough to do at dinner, carving large joints, and jointing those terrible birds. At breakfast a gentleman should have no trouble but the cracking of his own egg and the reading of his own newspaper. Now do let me!\"  Miss Burton's long fingers were almost on the tea-caddy; but at that moment my father quietly opened it, and began to measure out the tea.  \"I never trouble my lady visitors with this,\" he said, quietly. \"I am only too well accustomed to it.\"  Child as I was, I felt well satisfied that my father would let no one fill my mother's place. For so it was, and all Miss Burton's efforts failed to put her, even for a moment, at the head of his table.  I do not quite know how or when it was that I began to realize that such was her effort. I remember once hearing a scrap of conversation between our most respectable and respectful butler and the housekeeper--\"behind the scenes\"--as the former worthy came from the breakfast-room.  \"And how's the new missis this morning, Mr. Smith?\" asked the housekeeper, with a bitterness not softened by the prospect of possible dethronement.  \"Another try for the tea-tray, ma'am,\" replied Smith, \"but it's no go.\"  \"A brazen, black-haired old maid!\" cried the housekeeper. \"To think of her taking the place of that sweet angel, Mrs. Dacre (and she barely two years in her grave), and pretending to act a mother's part by the poor boy and all. I've no patience!\"  On one excuse or another, the Burtons contrived to extend their visit; and the prospect of a marriage between my father and Miss Burton was now discussed too openly behind his back for me to fail to hear it. Then Nurse Bundle on this subject hardly exercised her usual discretion in withholding me from servants' gossip, and servants' gossip from me. Her own indignation was strongly aroused, and I had no difficulty in connecting her tearful embraces, and her allusions to my dead mother, with the misfortune we all believed to be impending.  [Illustration: The lank lawyer wagged my hand of a morning, and said, \"And how is Miss Eliza's little beau?\"]  At first I had admired Miss Burton's bouncing looks. Then my head had been turned to some extent by her flattery, and by the establishment of that most objectionable of domestic jokes, the parody of love affairs in connection with children. Miss Burton called me her little sweetheart, and sent me messages, and vowed that I was quite a little man of the world, and then was sure that I was a desperate flirt. The lank lawyer wagged my hand of a morning, and said, \"And how is Miss Eliza's little beau?\" And I laughed, and looked important, and talked rather louder, and escaped as often as I could from the nursery, and endeavoured to act up to the character assigned me with about as much grace as Æsop's donkey trying to dance. I must have become a perfect nuisance to any sensible person at this period, and indeed my father had an interview with Nurse Bundle on the subject.  \"Master Reginald seems to me to be more troublesome than he used to be, nurse,\" said my father.  \"Indeed you say true, sir,\" said Mrs. Bundle, only too glad to reply; \"but it's the drawing-room and not the nursery as does it. Miss Burton is always a begging for him to be allowed to stay up at nights and to lunch in the dining-room, and to come down of a morning, and to have a half-holiday in an afternoon; and, saving your better knowledge, sir, it's a bad thing to break into the regular ways of children. It ain't for their happiness, nor for any one else's.\"  \"You are perfectly right, perfectly right,\" said my father, \"and it shall not occur again. Ah! my poor boy,\" he added in an irrepressible outburst, \"you suffer for lack of a mother's care. I do what I can, but a man cannot supply a woman's place to a child.\"  Mrs. Bundle's feelings at this soliloquy may be imagined. \"You might have knocked me down with a feather, sir,\" she assured the butler (unlikely as it seemed!) in describing the scene afterwards. She found strength, however, to reply to my father's remark.  \"Indeed, sir, a mother's place never can be filled to a child by no one whatever. Least of all such a mother as he had in your dear lady. But he's a boy, sir, and not a girl, and in all reason a father is what he'll chiefly look to in a year or two. And for the meanwhile, sir, I ask you, could Master Reginald look better or behave better than he did afore the company come? It's only natural as smart ladies who knows nothing whatever of children, and how they should be brought up, and what's for their good, should think it a kindness to spoil them. Any one may see the lady has no notion of children, and would be the ruin of Master Reginald if she had much to do with him; but when the company's gone, sir, and he's left quiet with his papa, you'll find him as good as any young gentleman needs to be, if you'll excuse my freedom in speaking, sir.\"  Whatever my father thought of Mrs. Bundle's freedom of speech, he only said,  \"Master Reginald will be quite under your orders for the future, Nurse,\" and so dismissed her.  And Mrs. Bundle having \"said her say,\" withdrew to say it over again in confidence to the housekeeper.  As for me, if my vanity was stronger than my good taste for a while, the quickness of childish instinct soon convinced me that Miss Burton had no real affection for me. Then I was puzzled by her spasmodic attentions when my father was in the room, and her rough repulses when I \"bothered\" her at less appropriate moments. I got tired of her, too, of the sound of her voice, of her black hair and unchanging red cheeks. And from the day that I caught her beating Rubens for lying on the edge of her dress, I lived in terror of her. Those rolling black eyes had not a pleasant look when the lady was out of temper. And was she really to be the new mistress of the house? To take the place of my fair, gentle, beautiful mother? That wave of household gossip which for ever surges behind the master's back was always breaking over me now, in expressions of pity for the motherless child of \"the dear lady dead and gone.\"  \""]]]
