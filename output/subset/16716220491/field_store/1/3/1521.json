But the great dread and key to this naval warfare is the modern submarine.  Submarines, aeroplanes, and motor busses are three elements of warfare never before put to the test; and the greatest of these thus far is the gasolene motor-car.  By this alone Germany may be defeated.  France and England are rich in gasolene motor power, and supplies from America are open to them.  A year ago there were less than 90,000 motor-cars in Germany, and Prince Henry started to encourage motoring to remedy this, but the Germans are slow to respond in sport.  Indeed they know little of sport as the English understand it, of sportsman ethics or the sense of fair play in either sport or war.  They do not comprehend the English applause for the captain of the \"Emden\" and stand aghast at the idea that he would be received as a hero in England.  When a daring aeroplane flier in the performance of his duty has met with mishap and, landed on German soil, he is not welcomed as a hero.  He is struck and kicked.  The German is not to be blamed.  It is the way he has been educated to \"assert himself,\" as the Germans phrase it.  Indeed, when the captain of the \"Emden\" was taken prisoner and was congratulated by the Australian commander for his gallant defense, he was so taken aback that he had to walk away and think it over.  He returned to thank his adversary for his complimentary remarks.  With true German scientific instinct he had to find his defeat in a physical cause, remarking, \"It was fortunate for you that your first shot took away my speaking tubes.\"  The English are sports in war,--too sporty in fact.  General Joffre warned General French over and over again, \"Your officers are too audacious; you will soon have none to command,\" and his words proved true.  The English officers felt that the rules of the game called upon them to lead their men.  They became targets for the guns of the foe, until one of the present embarrassments in England is the unprecedented loss of officers.  This has now been changed and Kitchener insists that both officers and men shall regard themselves as property of the Empire, that the exposure of a single life to unnecessary hazard is a breach of discipline.  For this reason Victoria Crosses are not numerous, less than two dozen having been conferred thus far; and it has been quietly announced that no Victoria Crosses will be conferred for single acts of bravery or where only one life is involved.  It must be team work and results affecting many.  For this reason also it has been decreed that the 33,000 Canadians in training at Salisbury Plain shall not be put in the front until they have learned discipline in place of the American initiative.  These Canadian boys receive their home pay of four shillings, or $1 per day, while the English Tommy gets one quarter of this amount.  The Canadians are fine fellows, feeling their independence and anxious to be on the firing line, but the War Office recognizes that soldierly independence cannot be allowed in this war.  It is not improbable that the Canadian troops will eventually be dispersed that their strong individual initiative may be thoroughly harnessed under the organization before they are trusted in the trenches.  They are not to be permitted to go there to be shot at, but to use their splendid physiques, fighting abilities, and patriotism--more British than the English themselves--in strict organization.  This is not to be an audacious war on the part of the Allies.  It is first a defensive war in which the Germans are the heaviest losers.  On the part of the Germans it is an audacious war and its very audacity has astounded the whole world.  But Germany never meant to war against the world collectively.  That was the accident of her bad diplomacy.  The audaciousness of Prussian war conceptions began in the latter part of the last century.  They did not grow out of the war with the French in 1870, for Bismarck's legacy to the German nation was a warning against any war with Russia.  The German scheme was concocted by the successor of Bismarck himself, none other than Kaiser William II.  He planned a steady growth of German power that would first vanquish the Slav of southeastern Europe and give Germany control through Constantinople and Asia Minor to the Persian gulf; then, as opportunity arose, a crushing of France and repression of Russia; and the overthrow of the British empire; and then the end of the Monroe Doctrine, to be followed by American tariffs dictated from Germany.  This seems so audacious a program as to be almost beyond comprehension in America.  Yet it will be made clear in the next chapter.     CHAPTER II  TARIFFS AND COMMERCE THE WAR CAUSES  War with Russia was Inevitable--Finance and Tariffs made Germany great--Commercial War--How Germany loses in the United States--The Tariff Danger.   For the causes of this most audacious war of 1914 one must study, not only Germany and her imperial policy, but most particularly her relations with Russia.  These relations are very little understood in America, but they become vital to us when open to public view.  Disregarding all the counsels of Bismarck and the previous reigning Hohenzollerns, the present Kaiser has steadily offended Russia.  War with her within two years was inevitable, irrespective of any causes in relation to Servia.  Russia knew this and was diligently preparing for it.  Germany--the war party of Germany--knew it and with supreme audacity determined through Austria first to smash Servia and put the Balkan States and Turkey in alignment with herself for this coming war with Russia.  Sergius Witte is one of the great statesmen of Russia.  He formulated the programme for the Siberian railroad and Russian Asiatic development.  The party of nobles opposed to him arranged that he should receive the humiliation of an ignoble peace with Japan, under which it was expected that Russia would have to pay a huge indemnity.  But when Witte arrived at the naval station at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, to make the famous treaty with Japan, his first declaration was, \"Not one kopeck for indemnity.\"  He won out and returned in triumph to Russia.  But during the progress of the Japanese war Germany thrust her commercial treaties upon St. Petersburg.  Goods from Russia into Germany were taxed while German goods went under favorable terms into Russia, with the result that Russia has had a struggle now for ten years to keep her gold basis and her financial exchanges.  It was Witte who was sent to Berlin to protest against these proposed treaties and secure more favorable terms.  Witte made his protest and refused to accept the German demands.  Then suddenly he received peremptory orders from the Czar to grant all the demands of Germany. The Czar declared Russia was in no condition to have trouble with Germany.  These commercial treaties expire within two years.  Russia many months back proposed the discussion of new terms.  Germany responded that the present treaties were satisfactory to her and he should call for their renewal.  This meant either further humiliation to Russia or war.  Russia had already suffered the affront of being forced by Germany at the point of the bayonet to assent to the taking by Austria of Bosnia and Herzegovina in violation of the Treaty of Berlin.  The Czar realized many months ago that Russia must now fight for her commercial life. She would not, however, be ready for the war until 1916.  Let Americans consider what this means--a German war over commercial tariffs--and see what, if successful in Europe, it would lead to.  The German nation is a fighting unit under the dominion of Prussia, the greatest war state, not only of the empire, but of the world.  Having welded Germany by the Franco-Prussian war into a nation with unified tariffs, transportation, currency, and monetary systems, Prussia has been able to point to the war as the cause of the phenomenal prosperity of Germany.  It is a popular fallacy in Germany that militarism makes the greatness of a nation.  Germany's prosperity did not begin with the war of 1870. This was only the beginning of German unity which made possible unified transportation and later unified finances and tariffs.  Several years after the war, France, which had paid an indemnity to Germany of a thousand million dollars, or five billion francs, was found, to the astonishment of Bismarck, more prosperous than Germany which had thus received the expenses of her military campaign and a dot of Spandau Tower war-reserve moneys.  In 1875 came the great Reichsbank Act, which consolidated all the banking power of the empire.  Then came her scientific tariffs which put up the bars here, and let them down there, according as Germany needed export or import trade in any quarter of the earth.  The German people, on a soil poorer than that of France, worked hard and long hours for small wages.  But they worked scientifically and under the most intelligent protective tariff the world has ever seen.  In a generation they built up a foreign trade surpassing that of the United States and reaching $4,500,000,000 per annum.  By her rate of progress she was on the way to distance England, whose ports and business were open to her merchants without even the full English income tax.  She built the biggest passenger steamers ever conceived of and reached for the freight carrying trade of the world.  She mined in coal and iron and built solidly of brick and stone.  She put the world under tribute to her cheap and scientific chemistry.  She dug from great depths the only potash mines in the world and from half this potash she fertilized her soil until it laughed with abundant harvests.  The other half she sold outside so that her own potash stood"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18127"],["title","The Beginner's American History (#1)"],["body"," money or vessels toward it, but he received no encouragement. At length he determined to go to Spain and see if he could get help there.  On the southern coast of Spain there is a small port named Palos.[9] Within sight of the village of Palos, and also within plain sight of the ocean, there was a convent,[10]--which is still standing,--called the Convent of Saint Mary.  One morning a tall, fine-looking man, leading a little boy by the hand, knocked at the door of this convent and begged for a piece of bread and a cup of water for the child. The man was Columbus,--whose wife was now dead,--and the boy was his son.  It chanced that the guardian of the convent noticed Columbus standing at the door. He liked his appearance, and coming up, began to talk with him. Columbus frankly told him what he was trying to do. The guardian of the convent listened with great interest; then he gave him a letter to a friend who he thought would help him to lay his plans before Ferdinand and Isabella,[11] the king and queen of Spain.  [Footnote 9: Palos (Pa'los); see map in paragraph 12.]  [Footnote 10: Convent: a house in which a number of people live who devote themselves to a religious life.]  [Footnote 11: Isabella (Iz-ah-bel'ah).]   7. Columbus gets help for his great voyage.--Columbus left his son at the convent, and set forward on his journey full of bright hopes. But Ferdinand and Isabella could not then see him; and after waiting a long time, the traveller was told that he might go before a number of learned men and tell them about his proposed voyage across the Atlantic.  After hearing what Columbus had to say, these men thought that it would be foolish to spend money in trying to reach the other side of the ocean.  People who heard what this captain from Lisbon wanted to do began to think that he had lost his reason, and the boys in the streets laughed at him and called him crazy. Columbus waited for help seven years; he then made up his mind that he would wait no longer. Just as he was about leaving Spain, Queen Isabella, who had always felt interested in the brave sailor, resolved to aid him. Two rich sea-captains who lived in Palos also decided to take part in the voyage. With the assistance which Columbus now got he was able to fit out three small vessels. He went in the largest of the vessels--the only one which had an entire deck--as admiral[12] or commander of the fleet.  [Footnote 12: Admiral (ad'mi-ral).]   8. Columbus sails.--Early on Friday morning, August 3d, 1492, Columbus started from Palos to attempt to cross that ocean which men then called the \"Sea of Darkness,\"--a name which showed how little they knew of it, and how much they dreaded it.  We may be pretty sure that the guardian of the convent was one of those who watched the sailing of the little fleet. From the upper windows of the convent he could plainly see the vessels as they left the harbor of Palos.  [Illustration: COLUMBUS LEAVING PALOS, AUGUST 3D, 1492.]   9. What happened on the first part of the voyage.--Columbus sailed first for the Canary Islands, because from there it would be a straight line, as he thought, across to Japan and Asia. He was obliged to stop at the Canaries[13] more than three weeks, in order to make a new rudder for one of his vessels and to alter the sails of another.  At length all was ready, and he again set out on his voyage toward the west. When the sailors got so far out on the ocean that they could no longer see any of the islands, they were overcome with fear. They made up their minds that they should never be able to get back to Palos again. They were rough men, used to the sea, but now they bowed down their heads and cried like children. Columbus had hard work to quiet their fears and to encourage them to go forward with the voyage which they already wanted to give up.  [Footnote 13: Canaries (Ka-na'rez); see map in paragraph 12.]   10. What happened after they had been at sea many days.--For more than thirty days the three ships kept on their way toward the west. To the crew every day seemed a year. From sunrise to sunset nothing was to be seen but water and sky. At last the men began to think that they were sailing on an ocean which had no end. They whispered among themselves that Columbus had gone mad, and that if they kept on with him in command they should all be lost.  Twice, indeed, there was a joyful cry of Land! Land! but when they got nearer they saw that what they had thought was land was nothing but banks of clouds. Then some of the sailors said, Let us go to the admiral and tell him that we must turn back. What if he will not listen to us? asked others; Then we will throw him overboard and say when we reach Palos that he fell into the sea and was drowned.  But when the crew went to Columbus and told him that they would go no further, he sternly ordered them to their work, declaring that whatever might happen, he would not now give up the voyage.   11. Signs of land.--The very next day such certain signs of land were seen that the most faint-hearted took courage. The men had already noticed great flocks of land-birds flying toward the west, as if to guide them. Now some of the men on one vessel saw a branch of a thorn-bush float by. It was plain that it had not long been broken off from the bush, and it was full of red berries.  But one of the crew on the other vessel found something better even than the thorn-branch; for he drew out of the water a carved walking-stick. Every one saw that such a stick must have been cut and carved by human hands. These two signs could not be doubted. The men now felt sure that they were approaching the shore, and what was more, that there were people living in that strange country.   12. Discovery of land.--That evening Columbus begged his crew to keep a sharp lookout, and he promised a velvet coat to the one who should first see land. All was now excitement; and no man closed his eyes in sleep that night.  Columbus himself stood on a high part of his ship, looking steadily toward the west. About ten o'clock he saw a moving light; it seemed like a torch carried in a man's hand. He called to a companion and asked him if he could see anything of the kind; yes, he, too, plainly saw the moving light, but presently it disappeared.  Two hours after midnight a cannon was fired from the foremost vessel. It was the glad signal that the long-looked-for land was actually in sight. There it lay directly ahead, about six miles away.  [Illustration: Map showing the direction in which Columbus sailed on his great voyage across the ocean.]  Then Columbus gave the order to furl sails, and the three vessels came to a stop and waited for the dawn. When the sun rose on Friday, October 12th, 1492, Columbus saw a beautiful island with many trees growing on it. That was his first sight of the New World.   13. Columbus lands on the island and names it; who lived on the island.--Attended by the captains of the other two vessels, and by their crews, Columbus set out in a boat for the island. When they landed, all fell on their knees, kissed the ground for joy, and gave thanks to God. Columbus named the island San Salvador[14] and took possession of it, by right of discovery, for the king and queen of Spain.  [Illustration: LANDING OF COLUMBUS.]  He found that it was inhabited by a copper-colored people who spoke a language he could not understand. These people had never seen a ship or a white man before. They wore no clothing, but painted their bodies with bright colors. The Spaniards made them presents of strings of glass beads and red caps. In return they gave the Spaniards skeins of cotton yarn, tame parrots, and small ornaments of gold.  After staying here a short time Columbus set sail toward the south, in search of more land and in the hope of finding out where these people got their gold.  [Footnote 14: San Salvador (San Sal-va-dor'): meaning the Holy Redeemer or Saviour.]   14. Columbus names the group of islands and their people.--As Columbus sailed on, he saw many islands in every direction. He thought that they must be a part of the Indies which he was seeking. Since he had reached them by coming west from Spain, he called them the West Indies, and to the red men who lived on them he gave the name of Indians.   15. Columbus discovers two very large islands; his vessel is wrecked, and he returns to Spain in another.--In the course of the next six weeks Columbus discovered the island of Cuba. At first he thought that it must be Japan, but afterward he came to the conclusion that it was not an island at all, but part of the mainland of Asia.  Next, he came to the island of Hayti,[15] or San Domingo.[16] Here his ship was wrecked. He took the timber of the wreck and built a fort on the shore. Leaving about forty of his crew in this fort, Columbus set sail for Palos in one of the two remaining vessels.  [Footnote 15: Hayti (Ha'ti).]  [Footnote 16: San Domingo (San Do-min'go); see map in paragraph 17.]   16. Columbus arrives at Palos; joy of the people; how Ferdinand and Isabella received him.--When the vessel of Columbus was seen entering the harbor of Palos, the whole village was wild with excitement. More than seven months had gone by since he sailed away from that port, and as nothing had been heard from him, many supposed that the vessels and all on board were lost. Now that they saw their friends and neighbors coming back, all was joy. The bells of the churches rang a merry peal of welcome; the people thronged the streets, shouting to each other that Columbus, the great navigator, had crossed the \"Sea of Darkness\" and had returned in safety.  The king and queen were then in the city of Barcelona,[17] a long distance from Palos. To that city Columbus now went. He entered it on horseback, attended by the proudest and richest noblemen of Spain. He brought with him six Indians from the West Indies. They were gaily painted and wore bright feathers in their hair. Then a number of men"]]]
