Huge masses of burning gas will be hurled forth on the wind and ignite the trees two and three hundred yards distant. Fortunately, fires of this type are not common, most of the blazes one is likely to encounter being ground fires, which are principally harmful in that they destroy the forest floor.\"  \"But I should have thought,\" said Wilbur, \"that such fires could only get a strong hold in isolated parts where nobody lives.\"  \"Not at all. Sometimes they begin quite close to the settlements, like the destructive fire at Hinckley, Minnesota, in 1894, which burned quietly for a week, and could have been put out by a couple of men without any trouble; but sometimes they start in the far recesses of the forest and reach their full fury very quickly. Of course, every fire, even the famous Peshtigo fire, started as a little bit of a blaze which either of you two boys could have put out.\"  \"How big a fire was that, sir?\" asked Fred.  \"It covered an area of over two thousand square miles.\"  \"Great CÃ¦sar!\" ejaculated Wilbur after a rapid calculation, \"that would be a strip twenty miles wide and a hundred miles long.\"  The Chief Forester nodded.  \"It wiped the town of Peshtigo entirely off the map,\" he said. \"The people were hemmed in, ringed by fire on every side, and out of a population of two thousand, scarcely five hundred escaped. Flight was hopeless and rescue impossible.\"  \"And could this have been stopped after it got a hold at all?\" asked Wilbur seriously, realizing the gravity of the conditions that some day he might have to face. \"Could not something have been done?\"  \"It could have been prevented,\" said the Chief Forester fiercely, \"and as I said, in the first few hours either one of you boys could have put it out. But there have been many others like it since, and probably there will be many others yet to come. Even now, there are hundreds of towns and villages near forest lands utterly unprovided with adequate fire protection. Some of them are near our national forests, and it is our business to see that no danger comes to them.[1] Think of a fire like that of Peshtigo, think that if it had been stopped at the very beginning a thousand and a half lives would have been saved, and then ask yourself whether the work of a Forest Guard is not just about as fine a thing as any young fellow can do.\"  [Footnote 1: While this volume was in the press, forest fires of the utmost violence broke out in Idaho, Washington, and Montana. Over two hundred lives were lost, many of them of members of the Forest Service, and hundreds of thousands of acres of timber were destroyed.]  Wilbur turned impulsively to his chum.  \"You'll just have to join us, Fred,\" he said. \"I don't see how any one that knows anything about it can keep out. You could go to a forestry school this summer and start right in to get ready for it.\"  \"I'll think about it,\" said the older boy.  The Chief Forester was greatly pleased with the lad's eagerness to enroll his friend, and, turning to him, continued:  \"I don't want you to think it's all fire-fighting in the forest, though, Loyle; so I'll give you an idea of some of the other opportunities which will come your way in forest work. I suppose both of you boys hate a bully? I know I used to when I was at school.\"  \"I think,\" said Wilbur impetuously, \"that a bully's just about the worst ever.\"  \"I do, too,\" joined in Fred.  \"Well, you'll have a chance to put down a lot of bullying. You look surprised, eh? You don't see what bullying has to do with forestry? It has, a great deal, and I'll show you how. I suppose you know that a forest is a good deal like a school?\"  \"Well, no,\" admitted Wilbur frankly, \"I don't quite see how.\"  \"A forest is made up of a lot of different kind of trees, isn't it, just as a school is made up of a lot of boys? And each of these trees has an individuality, just in the same way that each boy has an individuality. That, of course, is easy to see. But what is more important, and much less known, is that just as the school as a whole gets to have a certain standard, so does the forest as a whole.\"  \"That seems queer,\" remarked Fred.  \"Perhaps it does, but it's true none the less. In many schools there are some boys bigger than others, but who are not good for as much, and they're always picking at the others and crowding them down. In the same way in a forest there are always some worthless trees, trying to crowd out the ones which are of more value. As the trees of better value are always sought for their timber, that gives the worthless stuff a good chance to get ahead. One of the duties of a Forester, looking after his section of the forest, is to see that every possible chance is given to the good over the bad.\"  \"It's really like having people to deal with!\" cried Fred in surprise. \"It sounds as if a tree were some kind of a human being.\"  \"There are lots of people,\" said the Chief Forester, \"who think of trees and speak of trees just exactly as if they were people like themselves. And it isn't even only the growing of the right kind of trees, but there are lots of ways of handling them under different conditions and at different ages. Thus, a Forester must be able to make his trees grow in height up to a certain stage, then stop their further growth upwards and make them put on diameter.\"  \"But how can you get a tree to grow in a certain way?\" asked Fred in utter amazement.  \"Get Loyle here to tell you all about it. I suppose you learned that at the Ranger School, didn't you?\" he added, turning to the younger boy.  \"Yes, sir. We had a very interesting course in silviculture.\"  \"But just to give you a rough idea, Fred,\" continued the Forester, \"you know that some trees need a lot of light. Consequently, if a number of young trees are left fairly close together, they will all grow up straight as fast as they can, without putting out any branches near the bottom, and all their growth will be of height.\"  \"See, Fred,\" interjected Wilbur, \"that's why saplings haven't got any twigs except just at the top.\"  \"Just so,\" said the Forester. \"Presently,\" he continued, \"as these young trees grow up together, one will overtop the rest. If the adjacent small trees be cut down when this tallest tree has reached a good height, it will spread at the top in order to get as much sunlight as possible. In order to carry a large top the diameter of the trunk must increase. So, by starting the trees close together and allowing one of them to develop alone after a certain height has been reached, the Forester has persuaded that tree first to grow straight and high, and then to develop girth, affording the finest and most valuable kind of lumber. That's just one small example of the scores of possibilities that lie in the hands of the expert Forester. By proper handling a forest can be made to respond to training, as I said, just as a school might do.\"  \"I can tell you a lot more things, Fred, just as wonderful as that,\" commented Wilbur.  The Chief Forester nodded.  \"I'd like to hear you myself,\" he said; \"I'd rather listen to something about trees than eat. But I've got to go now. I'll see you again soon, Loyle,\" and with a parting good wish to both boys, he crossed the street and went on his way.   [Illustration: A FOREST FIRE OUT OF CONTROL.

This uncle had been a great inspiration to Wilbur, for he was prominent in the Geological Survey, and had done some wonderful work in the Canyon of the Colorado. Wilbur hurried down at once.  \"Congratulations!\" the geologist said, as soon as the boy appeared. \"So you came through with flying colors, I hear.\"  \"Every one was just as fine as could be,\" answered the lad. \"But how did you know about it, uncle?\"  \"You wrote me that you were going to call on the Chief Forester to-day, and so I took the trouble to telephone to one of the men in the office who would be likely to know the result of your interview.\"  \"Isn't it bully?\"  \"Yes,\" said the older man with a quiet laugh, \"I think it is 'bully,' as you call it. But I didn't call only to congratulate you; I thought perhaps you would like to come with me to-night and meet some of the men in the Forest Service who are really doing things out West. If you do, there's no time to waste.\"  \"You bet I do,\" the boy replied hastily. \"But what is it all about?\"  \"It's a lecture on forestry in China, but it happens to come at the same time as a meeting of the District Foresters, so they're all in town. Trot along upstairs and get your hat, and we can talk about it on the way.\"  The geologist sauntered over to an acquaintance who was standing in the hotel lobby near by, but he had hardly exchanged half a dozen sentences with him when Wilbur reappeared, ready to go.  \"You see,\" said Masseth as they left the hotel, \"it is a good plan for you to meet as many of the leaders of your profession as you can, not only because their friendship may be useful to you, nor yet only because they are all pleasant fellows, but because forestry is a profession, a very large and complex one, and it is a revelation sometimes to see what can be made of it.

Would not people be deprived of this flimsy pretext for staying at home if their homes could be towed up to the church door? Or, better yet, granting that the churches followed out the same plan, and were themselves constructed like canal-boats, how easy it would be for the sexton to drive the church around the town and collect the absentees. In the same manner it would be glorious for men like ourselves, who have to go to their daily toil. For a consideration, Mrs. Pedagog could have us driven to our various places of business every morning, returning for us in the evening. Think how fine it would be for me, for instance, instead of having to come home every night in an overcrowded elevated train or on a cable-car, to have the office-boy come and announce, 'Mrs. Pedagog's Select Home for Gentlemen is at the door, Mr. Idiot.' I could step right out of my office into my charming little bedroom up in the bow, and the time usually expended on the cars could be devoted to dressing for tea. Then we could stop in at the court-house for our legal friend; and as for Doctor Capsule, wouldn't he revel in driving this boarding-house about town on his daily rounds among his patients?\"  \"What would become of my office hours?\" asked the Doctor. \"If this house were whirling giddily all about the city from morning until night, I don't know what would become of my office patients.\"  \"They might die a little sooner or live a little longer, that is all,\" said the Idiot. \"If they weren't able to find the house at all, however, I think it would be better for us, for much as I admire you, Doctor, I think your office hours are a nuisance to the rest of us. I had to elbow my way out of the house this morning between a double line of sufferers from mumps and influenza, and other pleasingly afflicted patients of yours, and I didn't like it very much.\"  \"I don't believe they liked it much either,\" returned the Doctor. \"One man with a sprained ankle told me about you. You shoved him in passing.\"  \"Well, you can apologize to him in my behalf,\" returned the Idiot; \"but you might add that he must expect very much the same treatment whenever he and a boy with mumps stand between me and the door. Sprained ankles aren't contagious, and I preferred shoving him to the other alternative.\"  The Doctor was silent, and the Idiot rose to go. \"Where will the house be this evening about six-thirty, Mrs. Pedagog?\" he asked, as he pushed his chair back from the table.  \"Where? Why, here, of course,\" returned the landlady.  \"Why, yes--of course,\" observed the Idiot, with an impatient gesture. \"How foolish of me! I've really been so wrapped up in my canal-boat ideal that I came to believe that it might possibly be real and not a dream, after all. I almost believed that perhaps I should find that the house had been towed somewhere up into Westchester County on my return, so that we might all escape the city's tax on personal property, which I am told is unusually high this year.\"  With which sally the Idiot kissed his hand to Mr. Pedagog and retired from the scene.     II   \"Let's write a book,\" suggested the Idiot, as he took his place at the board and unfolded his napkin.  \"What about?\" asked the Doctor, with a smile at the idea of the Idiot's thinking of embarking on literary pursuits.  \"About four hundred pages long,\" said the Idiot. \"I feel inspired.\"  \"You are inspired,\" said the School-Master. \"In your way you are a genius. I really never heard of such a variegated Idiot as you are in all my experience, and that means a great deal, I can tell you, for in the course of my career as an instructor of youth I have encountered many idiots.\"  \"Were they idiots before or after having drank at the fount of your learning?\" asked the Idiot, placidly.  Mr. Pedagog glared, and the Idiot was apparently satisfied. To make Mr. Pedagog glare appeared to be one of the chiefest of his ambitions.  \"You will kindly remember, Mr. Idiot,\" said Mrs. Pedagog at this point, \"that Mr. Pedagog is my husband, and such insinuations at my table are distinctly out of place.\"  \"I ask your pardon, Mrs. Pedagog,\" rejoined the offender, meekly. \"Nevertheless, as apart from the question in hand as to whether Mr. Pedagog inspires idiocy or not, I should like to get the views of this gathering on the point you make regarding the table. _Is_ this your table? Is it not rather the table of those who sit about it to regale their inner man with the good things under which I remember once or twice in my life to have heard it groan? To my mind, the latter is the truth. It is _our_ table, because we buy it, and I am forced to believe that some of us pay for it. I am prepared to admit that if Mr. Brief, for instance, is delinquent in his weekly payments, his interest in the table reverts to you until he shall have liquidated, and he is not privileged to say a word that you do not approve of; but I, for instance, who since January 1st have been compelled to pay in advance, am at least sole lessee, and for the time being proprietor of the portion for which I have paid. You have sold it to me. I have entered into possession, and while in possession, as a matter of right and not on sufferance, haven't I the privilege of freedom of speech?\"  \"You certainly exercise the privilege whether you have it or not,\" snapped Mr. Pedagog.  \"Well, I believe in exercise,\" said the Idiot. \"Exercise brings strength, and if exercising the privilege is going to strengthen it, exercise it I shall, if I have to hire a gymnasium for the purpose. But to return to Mrs. Pedagog's remark. It brings up another question that has more or less interested me. Because Mrs. Smithers married Mr. Pedagog, do we lose all of our rights in Mr. Pedagog? Before the happy event that reduced our number from ten to nine--\"  \"We are still ten, are we not?\" asked Mr. Whitechoker, counting the guests.  \"Not if Mr. Pedagog and the late Mrs. Smithers have become one,\" said the Idiot. \"But, as I was saying, before the happy event that reduced our number from ten to nine we were permitted to address our friend Pedagog in any terms we saw fit, and whenever he became sufficiently interested to indulge in repartee we were privileged to return it. Have we relinquished that privilege? I don't remember to have done so.\"  \"It's a question worthy of your giant intellect,\" said Mr. Pedagog, scornfully. \"For myself, I do not at all object to anything you may choose to say to me or of me. Your assaults are to me as water is to a duck's back.\"  \"I am sorry,\" said the Idiot. \"I hate family disagreements, and here we have Mrs. Pedagog taking one side and Mr. Pedagog the other. But whatever decision may ultimately be reached, of one thing Mrs. Pedagog must be assured. I on principle side against Mr. Pedagog, and if it be the wish of my good landlady that I shall refrain from playing intellectual battledore and shuttlecock with her husband, whom we all revere, I certainly shall refrain. Hereafter if I indulge in anything that in any sense resembles repartee with our landlord, I wish it distinctly understood that an apology goes with it.\"  \"That's all right, my boy,\" said the School-Master. \"You mean well. You are a little new, that's all, and we all understand you.\"  \"I don't understand him,\" growled the Doctor, still smarting under the recollection of former breakfast-table discomfitures. \"I wish we could get him translated.\"  \"If you prescribed for me once or twice I think it likely I should be translated in short order,\" retorted the Idiot. \"I wonder how I'd go translated into French?\"  \"You couldn't be expressed in French,\" put in the Lawyer. \"It would take some barbarian tongue to do you justice.\"  \"Very well,\" said the Idiot. \"Proceed. Do me justice.\"  \"I can't begin to,\" said Mr. Brief, angrily.  \"That's what I thought,\" said the Idiot. \"That's the reason why you always do me such great injustice. You lawyers always have to be doing something, even if it is only holding down a chair so that it won't blow out of your office window. If you haven't any justice to mete out, you take another tack and dispense injustice with lavish hand. However, I'll forgive you if you'll tell me one thing. What's libel, Mr. Brief?\"  \"None of your business,\" growled the Lawyer.  \"A very good general definition,\" said the Idiot, approvingly. \"If there's any business in the world that I should hate to have known as mine it is that of libel. I think, however, your definition is not definite. What I wanted to know was just how far I could go with remarks at this table and be safe from prosecution.\"  \"Nobody would ever prosecute you, for two reasons,\" said the lawyer. \"In a civil action for money damages a verdict against you for ten cents wouldn't be worth a rap, because the chances are you couldn't pay. In a criminal action your conviction would be a bad thing, because you would be likely to prove a corrupting influence in any jail in creation. Besides, you'd be safe before a jury, anyhow. You are just the sort of idiot that the intelligent jurors of to-day admire, and they'd acquit you of any crime. A man has a right to a trial at the hands of a jury of his peers. I don't think even in a jury-box twelve idiots equal to yourself could be found, so don't worry.\"  \"Thanks. Have a cigarette?\" said the Idiot, tossing one over to the Lawyer. \"It's all I have. If I had a half-dollar I should pay you for your opinion; but since I haven't, I offer you my all. The temperature of my coffee seems to have fallen, Mrs. Pedagog. Will you kindly let me have another cup?\"  \"Certainly,\" said Mrs. Pedagog. \"Mary, get the Idiot another cup.\"  Mary did as she was told, placing the empty bit of china at Mrs. Pedagog's side.  \"It is for the Idiot, Mary,\" said Mrs. Pedagog, coldly. \"Take it to him.\"  \"Empty, ma'am?\" asked the maid.  \"Certainly, Mary,\" said the Idiot, perceiving Mrs. Pedagog's point. \"I asked for another cup, not for more coffee.\"  [Illustration: \"CERTAINLY.
