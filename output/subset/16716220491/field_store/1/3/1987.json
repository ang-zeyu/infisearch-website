But the treasure had been claimed by a certain rascal named Sid Merrick and his nephew, Tad Sobber, and when Merrick lost his life during a hurricane at sea, Sobber continued to do all he could to get the money and jewels into his possession.  \"It's mine!\" he told Dick Rover one day. \"It's mine, all mine, and some day I'm going to get it!\"  \"You keep on, Tad Sobber, and some day you'll land in prison,\" had been Dick's answer. \"We found that treasure, and the courts have decided that it belongs to the Stanhope estate, and you had better keep your hands off.\"  But Tad Sobber was not satisfied, and soon he made a move that caused the worst kind of trouble. There was a learned but unscrupulous man named Josiah Crabtree who had once been a teacher at Putnam Hall, but who had been discharged and who had, later on, been sent to prison for his misdeeds. This Josiah Crabtree had once sought to marry Mrs. Stanhope, thinking thereby to get control of her money and the money she held in trust for Dora. The lady was weak and sickly, and the teacher had tried to hypnotize her into getting married, and had nearly succeeded, but the plot was nipped in the bud by the Rover boys.  Tad Sobber met Josiah Crabtree and the pair hatched out another plot, this time to abduct Mrs. Stanhope, getting the lady at the time to bring a good share of the treasure with her under the impression that it was to be invested by her friends. The lady was carried off to an island in Casco Bay, off the coast of Maine, and thither the Rover boys and some others followed them. There was a good deal of excitement; but in the end the lady was rescued and the treasure brought back. An effort was made to capture Tad Sobber and Josiah Crabtree, but the two evildoers managed to get away.  The home-coming of the boys with Mrs. Stanhope had been a time of great rejoicing. Dora had embraced Dick over and over again for what he had done for her mother, and Nellie and Grace had not been backward in complimenting Tom and Sam on their good work. There had been a general jubilee which had lasted several days.  \"Splendid work, boys, splendid work!\" Anderson Rover had said. \"I am proud of you!\"  \"Better work than the authorities could do,\" had come from Uncle Randolph.  \"Now that treasure had better be placed where no outsider can get his hands on it,\" Mr. Rover had added. And soon after that it was put in the strong box of a safe deposit company, there to remain until it could be properly invested.  At Brill College the Rover boys had fallen in with a number of fine fellows, including Stanley Browne and a German-American student named Max Spangler. They had also encountered some others, among whom were Dudd Flockley, Jerry Koswell and Bart Larkspur. Led by Koswell, who was a thoroughly bad egg, the three last-named students had tried to get the Rover boys into trouble, and had succeeded. But they overreached themselves and were exposed, and in sheer fright Koswell and Larkspur ran away and refused to return. Dudd Flockley was repentant and was given another chance.  While on the hunt for Mrs. Stanhope, the Rovers had fallen in with Koswell and Larkspur. But instead of getting aid from the pair, the latter did what they could to help old Crabtree and Sobber. This brought on a fight, and Koswell and Larkspur received a thrashing they would long remember. The former college students might have been arrested, but, like Crabtree and Sobber, they kept out of sight.  \"They are sure a bunch of bad ones,\" had been Dick Rover's comment, when referring to Crabtree, Sobber, Koswell and Larkspur. \"I wish they were all in jail.\"  \"I reckon we all wish that,\" had been Sam Rover's reply. \"It's an awful shame that we didn't capture at least one of 'em.\"  \"Well, we might have caught old Crabtree and Sobber if we hadn't broken the engine of the motor-boat,\" put in Tom.  \"Well, the engine was broken in a good cause,\" came from Dick. And he spoke the truth, as my old readers well know.  Following the home-coming of the boys, and the general jubilee, our heroes had settled down to enjoy themselves before going back to Brill. They had intended to take it easy on the farm, but when a great aviation meet was advertised to take place at the county seat they could not resist the temptation to be present.  At this meet there were five flying machines,--three biplanes, a monoplane, and a dirigible balloon. All made good records, and the Rover boys became wildly enthusiastic over what they saw.  \"Say, this suits me right down to the ground!\" cried Tom.  \"What fun a fellow could have if he had a flying machine and knew how to run it!\" had come from Sam.  \"Exactly--if he knew how to run it,\" had been Dick's words. \"But if he didn't know--well, he might have a nasty tumble, that's all.\"  \"Pooh, Dick! If those fellows can run these machines, so can we,\" had been Tom's confident words.  \"We know all about autos and motor-boats,\" Sam had put in.  \"That's true, Sam. But a monoplane or a biplane, or any kind of an aeroplane, isn't an auto or a motor-boat.\"  \"Are you afraid?\" demanded Tom.  \"Oh, no! Only if we got a flying machine we'd have to be careful about what we tried to do.\"  \"Hurrah! It's settled!\" cried Tom, who went headlong into everything. \"We'll get a machine to-morrow! How much do they cost?\"  \"I don't know--several thousand dollars, I fancy,\" answered his elder brother.  \"Boiled umbrellas, Dick! As much as that?\"  \"I think so.\"  \"Why look at some of 'em,\" declared Sam. \"Nothing but bamboo poles and a few wires, and canvas,--and the engine!\"  \"Yes, but the poles, wires and canvas have to be put together just right, Sam, and those engines are as powerful as they are light. And then don't forget the propellers, and the steering outfit, and the other things.\"  \"Come on and ask one of the men about them,\" came from Tom; and a little later they had a long talk with an aviator named Captain Colby, who proved to be a relative to Larry Colby, one of their former chums at Putnam Hall. He had heard about the Rover boys and some of their doings, and willingly told them all they wanted to know.  The boys went home with their minds full of flying machines, and as the Rovers were all well-to-do, and as the three lads had in the past proved capable of taking care of themselves, it was not a very difficult matter for them to persuade their father to let them buy a biplane. Then, through Captain Colby, they learned where the flying machine could be obtained, and the very next day bought the affair and had it shipped to the farm, and also arranged with the aviator to visit them and give them a number of lessons.  \"We've got three weeks before we have to go back to college,\" Tom had said. \"If we are quick to learn we can have lots of fun in that time.\"  \"Yes, and if we do learn, perhaps we can take the biplane to college with us and astonish some of the students and the faculty,\" Dick had added.  \"That's the talk!\" cried the youngest Rover. \"We'll take it along!\"  That morning Sam had gone off on an errand as already mentioned. Then Dick and Tom had gotten out the flying machine and started up the engine and the propellers. The ropes holding the biplane had broken or torn loose from the ground, and now the machine had gone off with a wild swoop, hurling poor Dick flat on his back and injuring him, how seriously was still to be learned.     CHAPTER III  SAM BRINGS NEWS   As Tom ran over to his brother's side he could not help but give a glance at the flying machine, which was rising higher and higher in the air, with a noise from the engine that sounded like a battery of gattling guns in action.  \"Hi! hi! Wot's that?\" came in a startled voice from the other side of the barn, and Jack Ness, the Rovers hired man, came running into view. \"By gum, if them boys ain't gone an' flew without waitin' fer that man to show 'em! Who's doin' it? I don't see nobuddy.\" And the hired man blinked in amazement at the sight before him. \"Is Sam in there?\"  \"Nobody is in the machine,\" answered Tom, who was kneeling beside his brother. \"Oh, gracious! Look at that!\" he exclaimed.  \"There goes the chimbley!\" roared Jack Ness, as the biplane swooped just high enough to clear the roof of the Rover homestead. One of the wheels underneath struck a chimney a glancing blow, hurling the bricks in all directions. As they came clattering down, from the house out ran Mrs. Rover, followed by her husband and the hired help. Anderson Rover was away on business.  \"What is the matter--is it a--er--a cyclone?\" gasped Randolph Rover.  \"I don't know, I'm sure,\" answered Mrs. Rover. \"But it's a terrible noise.\"  \"Look! look!\" shrieked the cook, pointing upward. \"Saints preserve us!\" she moaned. \"'Tis the end of the world!\"  \"A flying machine!\" murmured Randolph Rover. He gazed around hurriedly. \"Can it be the boys?\"  \"Oh, those boys! They will surely kill themselves!\" groaned Mrs. Rover. \"They know nothing about airships!\"  \"Say, dar ain't nobuddy in dat contraption!\" came suddenly from Aleck Pop. \"It am flyin' all by itself!\"  \"By itself?\" repeated Randolph Rover. \"Impossible, Alexander! A flying machine cannot run itself. There must be somebody to steer, and manipulate the engine, and----\"  \"Oh, maybe whoever was in it fell out!\" screamed Mrs. Rover, and now she looked ready to faint.  \"We must find out about this!\" returned her husband quickly. \"They had the machine in the shed back of the barn.\" And he ran in that direction, followed by the colored man, and then by his wife and the cook. In the meantime the biplane soared on and on, ever rising in the air and moving off in the direction of the river.  When the others arrived they found that Tom had carried poor Dick to the wagon shed and placed him on a pile of horse blankets, and was washing his wounded head with water. At the sight of her nephew lying there so still Mrs. Rover gave a scream.  \"Oh, Tom, is he--is he----\" she could not go on.

This, of course, is only an exercise for breath development.  Now begin to inhale from the bottom of the lungs first.  Exhale slowly and feel as if you were pushing the air against your chest. If you can get this sensation later when singing it will help you very greatly to get control of the breath and to avoid sending too much breath through the vocal chords.  The breath must be sent out in an even, steady flow.  You will notice when you begin to sing, if you watch yourself very carefully, that, first, you will try to inhale too much air; secondly, you will either force it all out at once, making a breathy note, or in trying to control the flow of air by the diaphragm you will suddenly cease to send it forth at all and will be making the sound by pressure from the throat.  There must never be any pressure from the throat. The sound must be made from the continued flow of air.  You must learn to control this flow of air, so that no muscular action of the throat can shut it off.  Open the throat wide and start your note by the pressure breath. The physical sensation should be first an effort on the part of the diaphragm to press the air up against the chest box, then the sensation of a perfectly open throat, and, lastly, the sensation that the air is passing freely into the cavities of the head.  The quantity of sound is controlled by the breath.  In diminishing the tone the opening of the throat remains the same. Only the quantity of breath given forth is diminished. That is done by the diaphragm muscles.  \"Filare la voce,\" to spin the voice from a tiny little thread into a breadth of sound and then diminish again, is one of the most beautiful effects in singing.  It is accomplished by the control of the breath, and its perfect accomplishment means the complete mastery of the greatest difficulty in learning to sing.  I think one of the best exercises for learning to control the voice by first getting control of the breath is to stand erect in a well-ventilated room or out of doors and slowly snuff in air through the nostrils, inhaling in little puffs, as if you were smelling something.  Take just a little bit of air at a time and feel as if you were filling the very bottom of your lungs and also the back of your lungs.  When you have the sensation of being full up to the neck retain the air for a few seconds and then very slowly send it out in little puffs again.  This is a splendid exercise, but I want to warn you not to practice any breathing exercise to such an extent that you make your heart beat fast or feel like strangling.  Overexercising the lungs is as bad as not exercising them enough and the results are often harmful.  Like everything else in singing, you want to learn this gradually. Never neglect it, because it is the very foundation of your art. But don't try to develop a diaphragm expansion of five inches in two weeks.  Indeed, it is not the expansion that you are working for.  I have noticed this one peculiarity about young singers--if they have an enormous development of the diaphragm they think they should be able to sing, no matter what happens. A girl came to see me once whose figure was really entirely out of proportion, the lower part of the lungs having been pressed out quite beyond even artistic lines.  \"You see, madam,\" she exclaimed, \"I have studied breathing. Why, I have such a strong diaphragm I can move the piano with it!\" And she did go right up to my piano and, pushing on this strong diaphragm of hers, moved the piano a fraction of an inch from its place.  I was quite aghast. I had never met such an athletic singer. When I asked her to let me hear her voice, however, a tiny stream of contralto sound issued from those powerful lungs.  She had developed her breathing capacity, but when she sang she held her breath back.  I have noticed that a great many people do this, and it is one of the things that must be overcome in the very beginning of the study of singing.  Certain young singers take in an enormous breath, stiffening every muscle in order to hold the air, thus depriving their muscles of all elasticity.  They will then shut off the throat and let only the smallest fraction of air escape, just enough to make a sound. Too much inbreathing and too violent an effort at inhaling will not help the singer at all.  People have said that they cannot see when I breathe. Well, they certainly cannot say that I am ever short of breath even if I do try to breathe invisibly. When I breathe I scarcely draw my diaphragm in at all, but I feel the air fill my lungs and I feel my upper ribs expand.  In singing I always feel as if I were forcing my breath against my chest, and, just as in the exercises according to Delsarte you will find the chest leads in all physical movements, so in singing you should feel this firm support of the chest of the highest as well as the lowest notes.  I have seen pupils, trying to master the art of breathing, holding themselves as rigidly as drum majors.  Now this rigidity of the spinal column will in no way help you in the emission of tone, nor will it increase the breath control. In fact, I don't think it would even help you to stand up straight, although it would certainly give one a stiff appearance and one far removed from grace.  A singer should stand freely and easily and should feel as if the chest were leading, but should not feel constrained or stiff in any part of the ribs or lungs.  From the minute the singer starts to emit a tone the supply of breath must be emitted steadily from the chamber of air in the lungs. It must never be held back once.  The immediate pressure of the air should be felt more against the chest. I know of a great many singers who, when they come to very difficult passages, put their hands on their chests, focusing their attention on this one part of the mechanism of singing.  The audience, of course, thinks the prima donna's hand is raised to her heart, when, as a matter of fact, the prima donna, with a difficult bit of singing before her, is thinking of her technique and the foundation of that technique--breath control.  This feeling of singing against the chest with the weight of air pressing up against it is known as \"breath support,\" and in Italian we have even a better word, \"apoggio,\" which is breath prop. The diaphragm in English may be called the bellows of the lungs, but the apoggio is the deep breath regulated by the diaphragm.  The attack of the sound must come from the apoggio, or breath prop. In attacking the very highest notes it is essential, and no singer can really get the high notes or vocal flexibility or strength of tone without the attack coming from this seat of respiration.  In practicing the trill or staccato tones the pressure of the breath must be felt even before the sound is heard. The beautiful, clear, bell-like tones that die away into a soft piano are tones struck on the apoggio and controlled by the steady soft pressure of the breath emitted through a perfectly open throat, over a low tongue and resounding in the cavities of the mouth or head.  Never for a moment sing without this apoggio, this breath prop. Its development and its constant use mean the restoration of sick or fatigued voices and the prolonging of all one's vocal powers into what is wrongly called old age.     The Mastery of the Tongue   The tongue is a veritable stumbling block in the path of the singer. The tongue is an enormous muscle compared with the other parts of the throat and mouth, and its roots particularly can by a slight movement block the passage of the throat pressing against the larynx. This accounts for much of the pinched singing we hear.  When the tongue forms a mountain in the back part of the mouth the singer produces what you call in English slang \"a hot potato tone\"--that is to say, a tone that sounds as if it were having much difficulty to get through the mouth. In very fact, it is having this difficulty, for it has to pass over the back of the tongue.  The would-be singer has to learn to control the tongue muscles and, above all things, to learn to relax the tongue and to govern it at will, so that it never stiffens and forms that hard lump which can be plainly felt immediately beneath the chin under the jaw.  It requires a great deal of practice to gain control of the tongue, and there are many different exercises which purport to be beneficial in gaining complete mastery over it. One, for instance, is to throw the tongue out as far forward as possible without stiffening it and then draw it back slowly. This can be done in front of a mirror by trying to throw the tongue not only from the tip, but from the root, keeping the sides of the tongue broad. Another way is to catch hold of the two sides of the tongue with the fingers and pull it out gently.  For my part, I scarcely approve of these mechanical ways of gaining control of the tongue except in cases where the singer is phlegmatic of temperament and cannot be made to feel the various sensations of stiff tongue or tongue drawn far back in other ways. Ordinarily I think they make the singer conscious, nervous and more likely to stiffen the tongue in a wild desire to relax it and keep it flat.  These exercises, however, combined with exercises in diction, help to make the tongue elastic, and the more elastic and quick this muscle becomes the clearer will be the singer's diction and the more flexible will be her voice.  The correct position of the tongue is raised from the back, lying flat in the mouth, the flattened tip beneath the front teeth, with the sides slightly raised so as to form a slight furrow in it. When the tongue is lying too low a lump under the chin beneath the jaw will form in singing and the tight muscles can be easily felt.  When the jaw is perfectly relaxed and the tongue lies flat in the mouth there will be a slight hollow under the chin and no stiffness in the muscles.  The tip of the"]]]
