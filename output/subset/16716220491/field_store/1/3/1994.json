And he ought to know if anybody does.\"  \"He certainly ought,\" the stranger agreed. Then, thanking Mrs. Ladybug once more, he hurried toward the garden.  \"One moment!\" she called. There were several questions that she wanted to ask the newcomer. She was wildly curious to know who he was and where he came from and what business had brought him to Pleasant Valley.  But he couldn't have heard her. Anyhow, he was out of sight in no time, leaving Mrs. Ladybug almost bursting with the questions that had sprung to her lips.  \"He might have waited a second,\" she muttered. \"But if he has traveled a long way no doubt he's eager to get to his journey's end.\"  Luckily Mrs. Ladybug had kept her eyes open when talking with the gentleman in the striped yellow coat. And as he turned to leave her she looked closely at his carpetbag. On one side of it she read, in big letters:               P. BUG             COLORADO     VII  A HANDSOME STRANGER   LITTLE Mrs. Ladybug was too excited to work. Ever since meeting the stranger in the orchard she had been able to think of nothing but him. Perhaps if she hadn't happened to notice his carpetbag, with the words, \"P. Bug, Colorado,\" upon its side, she might not have been so stirred up.  Anyhow, Mrs. Ladybug kept wondering what business had brought the stranger to Pleasant Valley. She wished she could find out what he was going to do in the potato patch. She wanted to ask him why he chose to have black stripes on his yellow coat, instead of spots. How long had he been traveling? When did he expect to leave the farm? There was no end to the questions that Mrs. Ladybug burned to put to him.  Meanwhile she told the news to everybody she saw. For Mrs. Ladybug dearly loved to spread choice morsels of gossip. It pleased her mightily to tell her neighbors something they didn't know.  People listened to her story with great interest. They were eager to learn all about the stranger, whom Mrs. Ladybug declared to be very handsome.  Mrs. Ladybug made her news last as long as possible in the telling. She made her neighbors wait a bit for every fact, so they would enjoy it to the full. And whenever she stopped anyone and told him about the newcomer, Mrs. Ladybug kept the best part until the last. She always ended her remarks by saying, with a most important air, \"His name is Mr. P. Bug. And he comes from Colorado.\"  That never failed to impress her listeners--which was exactly what Mrs. Ladybug wanted.  Since nobody asked her how she knew the traveler's name, and where he came from, Mrs. Ladybug did not trouble herself to explain that she had read both name and place upon his old-fashioned carpetbag.  There was one thing that puzzled her slightly, when she paused to think about it. How did it happen that the elegant stranger carried a most unfashionable bag?  Mrs. Ladybug soon settled that question to her own satisfaction.  \"He's like me!\" she decided. \"Mr. P. Bug is a hard worker and he doesn't care for show. He's a plain person. No doubt he put on that yellow coat to travel in, because it's his best. But he'll wear overalls, perhaps, if he starts to work in the potato patch--as I suspect he will.\"  At last, however, Mrs. Ladybug met with a rude shock. She was telling her news to Peppery Polly Bumblebee, one of the workers in the hive ruled by Buster Bumblebee's mother, the well-known Queen. And to Mrs. Ladybug's amazement, when she related the name of the stranger, and the place he came from, Peppery Polly laughed in her face.  \"Mr. P. Bug is not from Colorado,\" said Peppery Polly Bumblebee. \"He has never been off this farm.\"  Well, Mrs. Ladybug was staggered. She gasped. She clung to a leaf to keep from failing.  \"I don't believe that!\" she cried, as soon as she could speak. \"I'll find Mr. Bug himself and learn the truth from him.\"     VIII  SEEKING THE TRUTH   MRS. LADYBUG was determined to know the truth about Mr. P. Bug, the newcomer. And as soon as she had fully recovered from the rude blow that Peppery Polly Bumblebee dealt her, she set out for Farmer Green's garden and the potato patch.  For some time Mrs. Ladybug flew back and forth above the potato vines. It was not an easy matter to find so small a person as Mr. Bug in so big a field. But she discovered him at last. And she was somewhat surprised to see him still in his elegant yellow coat, with the black stripes. For Mrs. Ladybug had expected him to be hard at work, in overalls.  To be sure, Mr. P. Bug did appear to be busy about something or other. He was so busy that he scarcely so much as glanced at Mrs. Ladybug when she spoke to him, mumbling \"Good morning!\" in answer to her greeting, but not taking the trouble to doff his cap.  \"He's at work anyhow,\" thought Mrs. Ladybug. \"He's helping Farmer Green.\" Then she alighted on the potato vine where Mr. Bug was clinging.  \"Don't you remember me?\" she asked.  He shook his head. His mouth seemed to be full of something--Mrs. Ladybug wasn't sure what.  \"Don't you recall speaking to me one time?\" she persisted.  After swallowing, he answered.  \"I can't say I do!\"  \"I'm the person that told you how to get to this potato patch,\" Mrs. Ladybug explained. \"When you met me in the orchard, on your way from Colorado, you stopped and asked me to direct you to Farmer Green's potato patch.\"  For a moment or two Mr. Bug seemed puzzled--especially when Mrs. Ladybug mentioned Colorado. But by the time Mrs. Ladybug had finished speaking, he nodded.  \"So I did!\" he exclaimed. \"I had forgotten all about that. Though now that you speak of it, I do remember meeting a very talkative dame dressed in a polka dot. Possibly I spoke to you about my settling in the potato patch for the summer?\"  \"No!\" said Mrs. Ladybug. \"But I thought I'd find you here. You seemed in a great hurry to reach this place.\"  \"So I was!\" said Mr. P. Bug. \"And I'm glad I came. This is the finest potato patch in the whole valley--so I have been told.\"  \"You must have seen a good many others on your journey from Colorado,\" Mrs. Ladybug ventured. \"It's a long way from there to here, I suppose.\"  \"I suppose it is,\" Mr. P. Bug murmured. He seemed to be a bit impatient, as if he were in haste to return to his work and didn't care to talk any longer.  \"I suppose you were weeks on the road,\" Mrs. Ladybug went on. \"Are you going back to Colorado after you've finished helping Farmer Green with the potato crop?\"  \"Colorado!\" he blurted. \"I don't know where that place is. I've never been there in all my life.\"     IX  THAT CARPETBAG   MR. P. BUG'S statement amazed Mrs. Ladybug. He said he had never been in Colorado. More than that, he declared he didn't even know where the place was.  Now, Peppery Polly Bumblebee had told Mrs. Ladybug that Mr. P. Bug was no stranger in Pleasant Valley. But Mrs. Ladybug had not believed what she said. Even hearing Mr. Bug's own words, Mrs. Ladybug couldn't help doubting them.  \"Can it be true--\" she asked him--\"can it be true that you've never been off this farm?\"  Mr. Bug quite plainly wished that she would go away and stop bothering him.  \"It can be--it _is_ true,\" he replied carelessly.  At last Mrs. Ladybug had to believe what she heard.  \"Then you're a fraud!\" she cried. '\"You're a cheat! For I read on your carpetbag, when we met in the orchard, 'P. Bug. Colorado.'\"  \"Oh!\" said Mr. Bug with a smile. \"Oh! So _that's_ where you got your odd notion. I wondered how you happened to make such a mistake.\"  \"A perfectly natural mistake, I'm sure!\" Mrs. Ladybug exclaimed indignantly.  \"Well, I dare say it is,\" he admitted. \"But you see, that's not my carpetbag. At least, I didn't get it new. It belonged to my great-great-great-grandfather. Indeed, I'm not sure he wasn't even still greater than I've said. _He_ lived in Colorado once--so I've been told. But I was born and raised on this farm.\"  \"If all this is true,\" said Mrs. Ladybug, \"what were you doing with that carpetbag? And why did you ask me the way to this potato patch?\"  \"I'm in a hurry to get to work,\" Mr. Bug remarked. \"I'll answer just this once. When we met in the orchard I had been away on a little vacation. And Farmer Green's potato patch--so I learned--had been moved since last year.\"  \"Dear me!\" Mrs. Ladybug wailed. \"People will laugh at me for having made such a serious mistake.\"  But Mr. P. Bug didn't say anything about that.  \"Good-by!\" he grunted. And he crawled under a leaf, out of sight.  For once in her life Mrs. Ladybug wasn't eager to talk to her neighbors. On the contrary, she seemed to avoid them. But Peppery Polly Bumblebee called on her and asked her if she had seen the handsome stranger, Mr. P. Bug.  \"Yes!\" said Mrs. Ladybug. \"I've talked with him. And it's true that he has always lived here. There was a slight mistake about his carpetbag. It belonged to one of his ancestors. And since it bears his ancestor's name and address, naturally I thought they both belonged to this Mr. Bug.\"  Peppery Polly laughed.  \"If you don't believe what I tell you, you can ask him yourself!\" Mrs. Ladybug snapped. \"He's at work over in the potato patch, helping Farmer Green.\"  Peppery Polly laughed again, more unpleasantly than ever.  \"_Helping_ Farmer Green!\" she exclaimed. \"He's eating the leaves off the vines as fast as he can. I know that gentleman. He's Mr. Potato Bug. And he's one of the greatest pests on the farm.\"     X  A BIT OF NEWS   CHIRPY CRICKET was looking for Mrs. Ladybug. He had news for her. Now, it wasn't often that anybody could tell Mrs. Ladybug anything. Usually she was the one that told other people bits of gossip. So Chirpy Cricket was specially eager to find her and make known to her what he had learned.  It was about Mrs. Ladybug's cousin. At least, there was a person living in the vegetable garden who claimed to be a cousin of Mrs. Ladybug's.  Chirpy found Mrs. Ladybug in the orchard.

Of the Nature of Flatland    I call our world Flatland, not because we call it so, but to make its nature clearer to you, my happy readers, who are privileged to live in Space.  Imagine a vast sheet of paper on which straight Lines, Triangles, Squares, Pentagons, Hexagons, and other figures, instead of remaining fixed in their places, move freely about, on or in the surface, but without the power of rising above or sinking below it, very much like shadows--only hard and with luminous edges--and you will then have a pretty correct notion of my country and countrymen.  Alas, a few years ago, I should have said \"my universe\":  but now my mind has been opened to higher views of things.  In such a country, you will perceive at once that it is impossible that there should be anything of what you call a \"solid\" kind; but I dare say you will suppose that we could at least distinguish by sight the Triangles, Squares, and other figures, moving about as I have described them.  On the contrary, we could see nothing of the kind, not at least so as to distinguish one figure from another.  Nothing was visible, nor could be visible, to us, except Straight Lines; and the necessity of this I will speedily demonstrate.  Place a penny on the middle of one of your tables in Space; and leaning over it, look down upon it.  It will appear a circle.  But now, drawing back to the edge of the table, gradually lower your eye (thus bringing yourself more and more into the condition of the inhabitants of Flatland), and you will find the penny becoming more and more oval to your view, and at last when you have placed your eye exactly on the edge of the table (so that you are, as it were, actually a Flatlander) the penny will then have ceased to appear oval at all, and will have become, so far as you can see, a straight line.  The same thing would happen if you were to treat in the same way a Triangle, or Square, or any other figure cut out of pasteboard.  As soon as you look at it with your eye on the edge on the table, you will find that it ceases to appear to you a figure, and that it becomes in appearance a straight line.  Take for example an equilateral Triangle--who represents with us a Tradesman of the respectable class. Fig. 1 represents the Tradesman as you would see him while you were bending over him from above; figs. 2 and 3 represent the Tradesman, as you would see him if your eye were close to the level, or all but on the level of the table; and if your eye were quite on the level of the table (and that is how we see him in Flatland) you would see nothing but a straight line.   [Illustration 1]  [ASCII approximation follows]     (1)     __________     (2)    ___________     (3)     _________           \\        /             --__ __--                 ---             \\    /                   -               \\/   When I was in Spaceland I heard that your sailors have very similar experiences while they traverse your seas and discern some distant island or coast lying on the horizon.  The far-off land may have bays, forelands, angles in and out to any number and extent; yet at a distance you see none of these (unless indeed your sun shines bright upon them revealing the projections and retirements by means of light and shade), nothing but a grey unbroken line upon the water.  Well, that is just what we see when one of our triangular or other acquaintances comes toward us in Flatland.  As there is neither sun with us, nor any light of such a kind as to make shadows, we have none of the helps to the sight that you have in Spaceland.  If our friend comes closer to us we see his line becomes larger; if he leaves us it becomes smaller:  but still he looks like a straight line; be he a Triangle, Square, Pentagon, Hexagon, Circle, what you will--a straight Line he looks and nothing else.  You may perhaps ask how under these disadvantageous circumstances we are able to distinguish our friends from one another: but the answer to this very natural question will be more fitly and easily given when I come to describe the inhabitants of Flatland.  For the present let me defer this subject, and say a word or two about the climate and houses in our country.     Section 2.  Of the Climate and Houses in Flatland    As with you, so also with us, there are four points of the compass North, South, East, and West.  There being no sun nor other heavenly bodies, it is impossible for us to determine the North in the usual way; but we have a method of our own.  By a Law of Nature with us, there is a constant attraction to the South; and, although in temperate climates this is very slight--so that even a Woman in reasonable health can journey several furlongs northward without much difficulty--yet the hampering effect of the southward attraction is quite sufficient to serve as a compass in most parts of our earth.  Moreover, the rain (which falls at stated intervals) coming always from the North, is an additional assistance; and in the towns we have the guidance of the houses, which of course have their side-walls running for the most part North and South, so that the roofs may keep off the rain from the North.  In the country, where there are no houses, the trunks of the trees serve as some sort of guide.  Altogether, we have not so much difficulty as might be expected in determining our bearings.  Yet in our more temperate regions, in which the southward attraction is hardly felt, walking sometimes in a perfectly desolate plain where there have been no houses nor trees to guide me, I have been occasionally compelled to remain stationary for hours together, waiting till the rain came before continuing my journey.  On the weak and aged, and especially on delicate Females, the force of attraction tells much more heavily than on the robust of the Male Sex, so that it is a point of breeding, if you meet a Lady in the street, always to give her the North side of the way--by no means an easy thing to do always at short notice when you are in rude health and in a climate where it is difficult to tell your North from your South.  Windows there are none in our houses:  for the light comes to us alike in our homes and out of them, by day and by night, equally at all times and in all places, whence we know not.  It was in old days, with our learned men, an interesting and oft-investigated question, \"What is the origin of light?\" and the solution of it has been repeatedly attempted, with no other result than to crowd our lunatic asylums with the would-be solvers.  Hence, after fruitless attempts to suppress such investigations indirectly by making them liable to a heavy tax, the Legislature, in comparatively recent times, absolutely prohibited them. I--alas, I alone in Flatland--know now only too well the true solution of this mysterious problem; but my knowledge cannot be made intelligible to a single one of my countrymen; and I am mocked at--I, the sole possessor of the truths of Space and of the theory of the introduction of Light from the world of three Dimensions--as if I were the maddest of the mad!  But a truce to these painful digressions:  let me return to our houses.  The most common form for the construction of a house is five-sided or pentagonal, as in the annexed figure.  The two Northern sides RO, OF, constitute the roof, and for the most part have no doors; on the East is a small door for the Women; on the West a much larger one for the Men; the South side or floor is usually doorless.  Square and triangular houses are not allowed, and for this reason.  The angles of a Square (and still more those of an equilateral Triangle), being much more pointed than those of a Pentagon, and the lines of inanimate objects (such as houses) being dimmer than the lines of Men and Women, it follows that there is no little danger lest the points of a square or triangular house residence might do serious injury to an inconsiderate or perhaps absent-minded traveller suddenly therefore, running against them:  and as early as the eleventh century of our era, triangular houses were universally forbidden by Law, the only exceptions being fortifications, powder-magazines, barracks, and other state buildings, which it is not desirable that the general public should approach without circumspection."]]]
