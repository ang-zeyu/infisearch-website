That's where we are fortunate; this is one of the places where the Martian race perished, and there were no barbarians to come later and destroy what they had left.\" He puffed slowly at his pipe. \"Some of these days, Martha, we are going to break into one of these buildings and find that it was one in which the last of these people died. Then we will learn the story of the end of this civilization.\"  And if we learn to read their language, we'll learn the whole story, not just the obituary. She hesitated, not putting the thought into words. \"We'll find that, sometime, Selim,\" she said, then looked at her watch. \"I'm going to get some more work done on my lists, before dinner.\"  For an instant, the old man's face stiffened in disapproval; he started to say something, thought better of it, and put his pipe back into his mouth. The brief wrinkling around his mouth and the twitch of his white mustache had been enough, however; she knew what he was thinking. She was wasting time and effort, he believed; time and effort belonging not to herself but to the expedition. He could be right, too, she realized. But he had to be wrong; there had to be a way to do it. She turned from him silently and went to her own packing-case seat, at the middle of the table.         *       *       *       *       *  Photographs, and photostats of restored pages of books, and transcripts of inscriptions, were piled in front of her, and the notebooks in which she was compiling her lists. She sat down, lighting a fresh cigarette, and reached over to a stack of unexamined material, taking off the top sheet. It was a photostat of what looked like the title page and contents of some sort of a periodical. She remembered it; she had found it herself, two days before, in a closet in the basement of the building she had just finished examining.  She sat for a moment, looking at it. It was readable, in the sense that she had set up a purely arbitrary but consistently pronounceable system of phonetic values for the letters. The long vertical symbols were vowels. There were only ten of them; not too many, allowing separate characters for long and short sounds. There were twenty of the short horizontal letters, which meant that sounds like -ng or -ch or -sh were single letters. The odds were millions to one against her system being anything like the original sound of the language, but she had listed several thousand Martian words, and she could pronounce all of them.  And that was as far as it went. She could pronounce between three and four thousand Martian words, and she couldn't assign a meaning to one of them. Selim von Ohlmhorst believed that she never would. So did Tony Lattimer, and he was a great deal less reticent about saying so. So, she was sure, did Sachiko Koremitsu. There were times, now and then, when she began to be afraid that they were right.  The letters on the page in front of her began squirming and dancing, slender vowels with fat little consonants. They did that, now, every night in her dreams. And there were other dreams, in which she read them as easily as English; waking, she would try desperately and vainly to remember. She blinked, and looked away from the photostatted page; when she looked back, the letters were behaving themselves again. There were three words at the top of the page, over-and-underlined, which seemed to be the Martian method of capitalization. _Mastharnorvod Tadavas Sornhulva_. She pronounced them mentally, leafing through her notebooks to see if she had encountered them before, and in what contexts. All three were listed. In addition, _masthar_ was a fairly common word, and so was _norvod_, and so was _nor_, but _-vod_ was a suffix and nothing but a suffix. _Davas_, was a word, too, and _ta-_ was a common prefix; _sorn_ and _hulva_ were both common words. This language, she had long ago decided, must be something like German; when the Martians had needed a new word, they had just pasted a couple of existing words together. It would probably turn out to be a grammatical horror. Well, they had published magazines, and one of them had been called _Mastharnorvod Tadavas Sornhulva_. She wondered if it had been something like the _Quarterly Archaeological Review_, or something more on the order of _Sexy Stories_.  A smaller line, under the title, was plainly the issue number and date; enough things had been found numbered in series to enable her to identify the numerals and determine that a decimal system of numeration had been used. This was the one thousand and seven hundred and fifty-fourth issue, for Doma, 14837; then Doma must be the name of one of the Martian months. The word had turned up several times before. She found herself puffing furiously on her cigarette as she leafed through notebooks and piles of already examined material.         *       *       *       *       *  Sachiko was speaking to somebody, and a chair scraped at the end of the table. She raised her head, to see a big man with red hair and a red face, in Space Force green, with the single star of a major on his shoulder, sitting down. Ivan Fitzgerald, the medic. He was lifting weights from a book similar to the one the girl ordnance officer was restoring.  \"Haven't had time, lately,\" he was saying, in reply to Sachiko's question. \"The Finchley girl's still down with whatever it is she has, and it's something I haven't been able to diagnose yet. And I've been checking on bacteria cultures, and in what spare time I have, I've been dissecting specimens for Bill Chandler. Bill's finally found a mammal. Looks like a lizard, and it's only four inches long, but it's a real warm-blooded, gamogenetic, placental, viviparous mammal. Burrows, and seems to live on what pass for insects here.\"  \"Is there enough oxygen for anything like that?\" Sachiko was asking.  \"Seems to be, close to the ground.\" Fitzgerald got the headband of his loup adjusted, and pulled it down over his eyes. \"He found this thing in a ravine down on the sea bottom--Ha, this page seems to be intact; now, if I can get it out all in one piece--\"  He went on talking inaudibly to himself, lifting the page a little at a time and sliding one of the transparent plastic sheets under it, working with minute delicacy. Not the delicacy of the Japanese girl's small hands, moving like the paws of a cat washing her face, but like a steam-hammer cracking a peanut. Field archaeology requires a certain delicacy of touch, too, but Martha watched the pair of them with envious admiration. Then she turned back to her own work, finishing the table of contents.  The next page was the beginning of the first article listed; many of the words were unfamiliar. She had the impression that this must be some kind of scientific or technical journal; that could be because such publications made up the bulk of her own periodical reading. She doubted if it were fiction; the paragraphs had a solid, factual look.  At length, Ivan Fitzgerald gave a short, explosive grunt.  \"Ha! Got it!\"  She looked up. He had detached the page and was cementing another plastic sheet onto it.  \"Any pictures?\" she asked.  \"None on this side. Wait a moment.\" He turned the sheet. \"None on this side, either.\" He sprayed another sheet of plastic to sandwich the page, then picked up his pipe and relighted it.  \"I get fun out of this, and it's good practice for my hands, so don't think I'm complaining,\" he said, \"but, Martha, do you honestly think anybody's ever going to get anything out of this?\"  Sachiko held up a scrap of the silicone plastic the Martians had used for paper with her tweezers. It was almost an inch square.  \"Look; three whole words on this piece,\" she crowed. \"Ivan, you took the easy book.\"  Fitzgerald wasn't being sidetracked. \"This stuff's absolutely meaningless,\" he continued. \"It had a meaning fifty thousand years ago, when it was written, but it has none at all now.\"  She shook her head. \"Meaning isn't something that evaporates with time,\" she argued. \"It has just as much meaning now as it ever had. We just haven't learned how to decipher it.\"  \"That seems like a pretty pointless distinction,\" Selim von Ohlmhorst joined the conversation. \"There no longer exists a means of deciphering it.\"  \"We'll find one.\" She was speaking, she realized, more in self-encouragement than in controversy.  \"How? From pictures and captions? We've found captioned pictures, and what have they given us? A caption is intended to explain the picture, not the picture to explain the caption. Suppose some alien to our culture found a picture of a man with a white beard and mustache sawing a billet from a log. He would think the caption meant, 'Man Sawing Wood.' How would he know that it was really 'Wilhelm II in Exile at Doorn?'\"  Sachiko had taken off her loup and was lighting a cigarette.  \"I can think of pictures intended to explain their captions,\" she said. \"These picture language-books, the sort we use in the Service--little line drawings, with a word or phrase under them.\"  \"Well, of course, if we found something like that,\" von Ohlmhorst began.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Michael Ventris found something like that, back in the Fifties,\" Hubert Penrose's voice broke in from directly behind her.  She turned her head. The colonel was standing by the archaeologists' table; Captain Field and the airdyne pilot had gone out.  \"He found a lot of Greek inventories of military stores,\" Penrose continued. \"They were in Cretan Linear B script, and at the head of each list was a little picture, a sword or a helmet or a cooking tripod or a chariot wheel. That's what gave him the key to the script.\"  \"Colonel's getting to be quite an archaeologist,\" Fitzgerald commented. \"We're all learning each others' specialties, on this expedition.\"  \"I heard about that long before this expedition was even contemplated.\" Penrose was tapping a cigarette on his gold case. \"I heard about that back before the Thirty Days' War, at Intelligence "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19445"],["title","Omnilingual (#2)"],["body","School, when I was a lieutenant. As a feat of cryptanalysis, not an archaeological discovery.\"  \"Yes, cryptanalysis,\" von Ohlmhorst pounced. \"The reading of a known language in an unknown form of writing. Ventris' lists were in the known language, Greek. Neither he nor anybody else ever read a word of the Cretan language until the finding of the Greek-Cretan bilingual in 1963, because only with a bilingual text, one language already known, can an unknown ancient language be learned. And what hope, I ask you, have we of finding anything like that here? Martha, you've been working on these Martian texts ever since we landed here--for the last six months. Tell me, have you found a single word to which you can positively assign a meaning?\"  \"Yes, I think I have one.\" She was trying hard not to sound too exultant. \"_Doma._ It's the name of one of the months of the Martian calendar.\"  \"Where did you find that?\" von Ohlmhorst asked. \"And how did you establish--?\"  \"Here.\" She picked up the photostat and handed it along the table to him. \"I'd call this the title page of a magazine.\"  He was silent for a moment, looking at it. \"Yes. I would say so, too. Have you any of the rest of it?\"  \"I'm working on the first page of the first article, listed there. Wait till I see; yes, here's all I found, together, here.\" She told him where she had gotten it. \"I just gathered it up, at the time, and gave it to Geoffrey and Rosita to photostat; this is the first I've really examined it.\"  The old man got to his feet, brushing tobacco ashes from the front of his jacket, and came to where she was sitting, laying the title page on the table and leafing quickly through the stack of photostats.  [Illustration]  \"Yes, and here is the second article, on page eight, and here's the next one.\" He finished the pile of photostats. \"A couple of pages missing at the end of the last article. This is remarkable; surprising that a thing like a magazine would have survived so long.\"  \"Well, this silicone stuff the Martians used for paper is pretty durable,\" Hubert Penrose said. \"There doesn't seem to have been any water or any other fluid in it originally, so it wouldn't dry out with time.\"  \"Oh, it's not remarkable that the material would have survived. We've found a good many books and papers in excellent condition. But only a really vital culture, an organized culture, will publish magazines, and this civilization had been dying for hundreds of years before the end. It might have been a thousand years before the time they died out completely that such activities as publishing ended.\"  \"Well, look where I found it; in a closet in a cellar. Tossed in there and forgotten, and then ignored when they were stripping the building. Things like that happen.\"  Penrose had picked up the title page and was looking at it.  \"I don't think there's any doubt about this being a magazine, at all.\" He looked again at the title, his lips moving silently. \"_Mastharnorvod Tadavas Sornhulva_. Wonder what it means. But you're right about the date--_Doma_ seems to be the name of a month. Yes, you have a word, Dr. Dane.\"  Sid Chamberlain, seeing that something unusual was going on, had come over from the table at which he was working. After examining the title page and some of the inside pages, he began whispering into the stenophone he had taken from his belt.  \"Don't try to blow this up to anything big, Sid,\" she cautioned. \"All we have is the name of a month, and Lord only knows how long it'll be till we even find out which month it was.\"  \"Well, it's a start, isn't it?\" Penrose argued. \"Grotefend only had the word for 'king' when he started reading Persian cuneiform.\"  \"But I don't have the word for month; just the name of a month. Everybody knew the names of the Persian kings, long before Grotefend.\"  \"That's not the story,\" Chamberlain said. \"What the public back on Terra will be interested in is finding out that the Martians published magazines, just like we do. Something familiar; make the Martians seem more real. More human.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Three men had come in, and were removing their masks and helmets and oxy-tanks, and peeling out of their quilted coveralls. Two were Space Force lieutenants; the third was a youngish civilian with close-cropped blond hair, in a checked woolen shirt. Tony Lattimer and his helpers.  \"Don't tell me Martha finally got something out of that stuff?\" he asked, approaching the table. He might have been commenting on the antics of the village half-wit, from his tone.  \"Yes; the name of one of the Martian months.\" Hubert Penrose went on to explain, showing the photostat.  Tony Lattimer took it, glanced at it, and dropped it on the table.  \"Sounds plausible, of course, but just an assumption. That word may not be the name of a month, at all--could mean 'published' or 'authorized' or 'copyrighted' or anything like that. Fact is, I don't think it's more than a wild guess that that thing's anything like a periodical.\" He dismissed the subject and turned to Penrose. \"I picked out the next building to enter; that tall one with the conical thing on top. It ought to be in pretty good shape inside; the conical top wouldn't allow dust to accumulate, and from the outside nothing seems to be caved in or crushed. Ground level's higher than the other one, about the seventh floor. I found a good place and drilled for the shots; tomorrow I'll blast a hole in it, and if you can spare some people to help, we can start exploring it right away.\"  \"Yes, of course, Dr. Lattimer. I can spare about a dozen, and I suppose you can find a few civilian volunteers,\" Penrose told him. \"What will you need in the way of equipment?\"  \"Oh, about six demolition-packets; they can all be shot together. And the usual thing in the way of lights, and breaking and digging tools, and climbing equipment in case we run into broken or doubtful stairways. We'll divide into two parties. Nothing ought to be entered for the first time without a qualified archaeologist along. Three parties, if Martha can tear herself away from this catalogue of systematized incomprehensibilities she's making long enough to do some real work.\"  She felt her chest tighten and her face become stiff. She was pressing her lips together to lock in a furious retort when Hubert Penrose answered for her.  \"Dr. Dane's been doing as much work, and as important work, as you have,\" he said brusquely. \"More important work, I'd be inclined to say.\"  Von Ohlmhorst was visibly distressed; he glanced once toward Sid Chamberlain, then looked hastily away from him. Afraid of a story of dissension among archaeologists getting out.  \"Working out a system of pronunciation by which the Martian language could be transliterated was a most important contribution,\" he said. \"And Martha did that almost unassisted.\"  \"Unassisted by Dr. Lattimer, anyway,\" Penrose added. \"Captain Field and Lieutenant Koremitsu did some work, and I helped out a little, but nine-tenths of it she did herself.\"  \"Purely arbitrary,\" Lattimer disdained. \"Why, we don't even know that the Martians could make the same kind of vocal sounds we do.\"  \"Oh, yes, we do,\" Ivan Fitzgerald contradicted, safe on his own ground. \"I haven't seen any actual Martian skulls--these people seem to have been very tidy about disposing of their dead--but from statues and busts and pictures I've seen. I'd say that their vocal organs were identical with our own.\"  \"Well, grant that. And grant that it's going to be impressive to rattle off the names of Martian notables whose statues we find, and that if we're ever able to attribute any placenames, they'll sound a lot better than this horse-doctors' Latin the old astronomers splashed all over the map of Mars,\" Lattimer said. \"What I object to is her wasting time on this stuff, of which nobody will ever be able to read a word if she fiddles around with those lists till there's another hundred feet of loess on this city, when there's so much real work to be done and we're as shorthanded as we are.\"  That was the first time that had come out in just so many words. She was glad Lattimer had said it and not Selim von Ohlmhorst.  \"What you mean,\" she retorted, \"is that it doesn't have the publicity value that digging up statues has.\"  For an instant, she could see that the shot had scored. Then Lattimer, with a side glance at Chamberlain, answered:  \"What I mean is that you're trying to find something that any archaeologist, yourself included, should know doesn't exist. I don't object to your gambling your professional reputation and making a laughing stock of yourself; what I object to is that the blunders of one archaeologist discredit the whole subject in the eyes of the public.\"  That seemed to be what worried Lattimer most. She was framing a reply when the communication-outlet whistled shrilly, and then squawked: \"Cocktail time! One hour to dinner; cocktails in the library, Hut Four!\"         *       *       *       *       *  The library, which was also lounge, recreation room, and general gathering-place, was already crowded; most of the crowd was at the long table topped with sheets of glasslike plastic that had been wall panels out of one of the ruined buildings. She poured herself what passed, here, for a martini, and carried it over to where Selim von Ohlmhorst was sitting alone.  For a while, they talked about the building they had just finished exploring, then drifted into reminiscences of their work on Terra--von Ohlmhorst's in Asia Minor, with the Hittite Empire, and hers in Pakistan, excavating the cities of the Harappa Civilization. They finished their drinks--the ingredients were plentiful; alcohol and flavoring extracts synthesized from Martian vegetation--and von Ohlmhorst took the two glasses to the table for refills.  \"You know, Martha,\" he said, when he returned, \"Tony was right about one thing. You are gambling your professional standing and reputation. It's against all archaeological"]]]
