These articles, being generally light and portable, and constructed of delicate parts, can as well be classed with basketry as with wattle work.     [1] Hist. Virginia, John Smith.

This term may be made to cover all woven articles of a portable kind which have sufficient rigidity to retain definite or stable form without distention by contents or by other extraneous form of support. It will readily be seen that in shape, texture, use, size, etc., a very wide range of products is here to be considered. Basketry includes a number of groups of utensils distinguished from one another by the use to which they are devoted. There are baskets proper, hampers, cradles, shields, quivers, sieves, etc. There is frequent historical mention of the use of basketry, but the descriptions of form and construction are meager. An excellent idea of the ancient art can be gained from the art of the present time, and there is every reason to believe that close correspondence exists throughout.   BASKETS.  Lawson refers to basket-making and other textile arts of the Carolina Indians in the following language:      The Indian women's work is to cook the victuals for the whole     family, and to make mats, baskets, girdles, of possum hair,     and such like. * * *      The mats the Indian women make are of rushes, and about five     feet high, and two fathom long, and sewed double, that is,     two together; whereby they become very commodious to lay     under our beds, or to sleep on in the summer season in the     day time, and for our slaves in the night.      There are other mats made of flags, which the Tuskeruro     Indians make, and sell to the inhabitants.      The baskets our neighboring Indians make are all made of a     very fine sort of bullrushes, and sometimes of silk grass,     which they work with figures of beasts, birds, fishes, &c.      A great way up in the country, both baskets and mats are made     of the split reeds, which are only the outward shining part     of the cane. Of these I have seen mats, baskets, and dressing     boxes, very artificially done.[6]  James Adair, although, a comparatively recent writer, gives such definite and valuable information regarding the handiwork of the Southern Indians that the following extracts may well be made. Speaking of the Cherokees, he remarks:      They make the handsomest clothes baskets, I ever saw,     considering their materials. They divide large swamp canes,     into long, thin, narrow splinters, which they dye of several     colours, and manage the workmanship so well, that both the     inside and outside are covered with a beautiful variety of     pleasing figures; and, though for the space of two inches     below the upper edge of each basket, it is worked into one,     through the other parts they are worked asunder, as if they     were two joined a-top by some strong cement. A large nest     consists of eight or ten baskets, contained within each     other. Their dimensions are different, but they usually make     the outside basket about a foot deep, a foot and an half     broad, and almost a yard long.[7]  This statement could in most respects be made with equal truth and propriety of the Cherokee work of the present time; and their pre-Columbian art must have been even more pleasing, as the following paragraph suggests:      The Indians, by reason of our supplying them so cheap with     every sort of goods, have forgotten the chief part of their     ancient mechanical skill, so as not to be well able now, at     least for some years, to live independent of us. Formerly,     those baskets which the Cheerake made, were so highly     esteemed even in South Carolina, the politest of our     colonies, for domestic usefulness, beauty, and skilful     variety, that a large nest of them cost upwards of a     moidore.[8]  That there was much uniformity in the processes and range of products and uses throughout the country is apparent from statements made by numerous writers. Speaking of the Louisiana Indians, Du Pratz says:      The women likewise make a kind of hampers to carry corn,     flesh, fish, or any other thing which they want to transport     from one place to another; they are round, deeper than broad,     and of all sizes. * * * They make baskets with long lids that     roll doubly over them, and in these they place their earrings     and pendants, their bracelets, garters, their ribbands for     their hair, and their vermillion for painting themselves, if     they have any, but when they have no vermillion they boil     ochre, and paint themselves with that.[9]  It happens that few baskets have been recovered from mounds and graves, but they are occasionally reported as having been discovered in caverns and shelters where conditions were especially favorable to their preservation. Such specimens may as reasonably be attributed to the mound-building as to the other Indians. The following statement is from John Haywood:      On the south side of Cumberland river, about 22 miles above     Cairo, * * * is a cave * * *. In this room, near about the     center, were found sitting in baskets made of cane, three     human bodies; the flesh entire, but a little shrivelled, and     not much so. The bodies were those of a man, a female and a     small child. The complexion of all was very fair, and white,     without any intermixture of the copper colour. Their eyes     were blue; their hair auburn, and fine. The teeth were very     white, their stature was delicate, about the size of the     whites of the present day. The man was wrapped in 14 dressed     deer skins. The 14 deer skins were wrapped in what those     present called blankets. They were made of bark, like those     found in the cave in White county. The form of the baskets     which inclosed them, was pyramidal, being larger at the     bottom, and declining to the top. The heads of the skeletons,     from the neck, were above the summits of the blankets.[10]   SIEVES AND STRAINERS.  It is apparent that baskets of open construction were employed as sieves in pre-Columbian as well as in post-Columbian times. Almost any basket could be utilized on occasion for separating fine from coarse particles of food or other pulverulent substances, but special forms were sometimes made for the purpose, having varying degrees of refinement to suit the material to be separated.  Bartram mentions the use of a sieve by the Georgia Indians in straining a \"cooling sort of jelly\" called conti, made by pounding certain roots in a mortar and adding water.  Butel-Dumont describes the sieves and winnowing fans of the Louisiana Indians. The Indian women, he says, make very fine sieves--      With the skin which they take off of the canes; they also     make some with larger holes, which serve as bolters, and     still others without holes, to be used as winnowing fans. * *     * They also make baskets very neatly fashioned, cradles for     holding maize; and with the tail feathers of turkeys, which     they have much skill in arranging, they make fans not only     for their own use, but which even our French women do not     disdain to use.[11]  Le Page Du Pratz says that \"for sifting the flour of their maiz, and for other uses, the natives make sieves of various finenesses of the splits of cane;\"[12] and a similar use by the Indians of Virginia is recorded by John Smith:      They use a small basket for their Temmes, then pound againe     the great, and so separating by dashing their hand in the     basket, receive the flowr in a platter of wood scraped to     that forme with burning and shels.[13]  From Hakluyt we have the following:      Their old wheat they firste steepe a night in hot water, and     in the morning pounding yt in a morter, they use a small     baskett for the boulter or searser, and when they have syfted     fourth the finest, they pound againe the great, and so     separating yt by dashing their hand in the baskett, receave     the flower in a platter of wood, which, blending with water,     etc.[14]   CRADLES.  That cradles of textile construction were used by the mound-builders may be taken for granted. The following is from Du Pratz, who is speaking of the work of the inhabitants of the lower Mississippi:      This cradle is about two feet and a half long, nine inches     broad. It is skillfully made of straight canes of the length     desired for the cradle, and at the end they are cut in half     and doubled under to form the foot. The whole is only half a     foot high. This cradle is very light, weighing only two     pounds. * * * The infant being rocked lengthwise, its head is     not shaken as are those who are rocked from side to side, as     in France. * * * The cradle is rocked by means of two ends of     canes, which make two rollers.[15]   SHIELDS.  Woven targets or shields would seem to be rather novel objects, but such are mentioned by John Smith, who used those belonging to friendly Indians in an encounter on the Chesapeake:      Here the Massawomek Targets stood vs in good stead, for vpon     Mosco's words we had set them about the forepart of our Boat     like a forecastle, from whence we securely beat the Salvages     from off the plaine without any hurt. * * * Arming ourselues     with these light Targets (which are made of little small     sticks woven betwixt strings of their hempe and silke grasse,     as is our cloth, but so firmly that no arrow can "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19922"],["title","The Scientific Evidences of Organic Evolution (#1)"],["body","to the intelligence of some supernatural agent; so that the only difference between the logic of science and the logic of superstition consists in science recognising a validity in the law of parsimony which superstition disregards. Therefore I have no hesitation in saying that this way of looking at the evidence in favour of natural selection is not a scientific or a reasonable way of looking at it, but a purely superstitious way. Let us take, for instance, as an illustration, a perfectly parallel case. When Kepler was unable to explain by any known causes the paths described by the planets, he resorted to a supernatural explanation, and supposed that every planet was guided in its movements by some presiding angel. But when Newton supplied a beautifully simple physical explanation, all persons with a scientific habit of mind at once abandoned the metaphysical explanation. Now, to be consistent, the above-mentioned professors, and all who think with them, ought still to adhere to Kepler's hypothesis in preference to Newton's explanation; for, excepting the law of parsimony, there is certainly no other logical objection to the statement that the movements of the planets afford as good evidence of the influence of guiding angels as they do of the influence of gravitation.  So much, then, for the absurdly illogical position that, granting the evidence in favour of natural selection and supernatural design to be equal and parallel, we should hesitate for one moment in our choice. But, of course, if the evidence is supposed _not_ to be equal and parallel--_i.e._, if it is supposed that the theory of natural relation is not so competent a theory to explain the facts of adaptation as is that of intelligent design--then the objection is no longer the one that we are considering. It is quite another objection, and one which is not _primâ facie_ absurd; it requires to be met by examining how far the theory of natural selection _is_ able to explain the facts. Let us state the problem clearly.  Innumerable cases of adaptation of organisms to their environment are the observed facts for which an explanation is required. To supply this explanation two, and only two, hypotheses are in the field. Of these two hypotheses one is, intelligent design manifested in creation; and the other is, natural selection manifested during the countless ages of the past. Now it would be proof positive of intelligent design if it could be shown that all species of plants and animals were _created_--that is _suddenly_ introduced into the complex conditions of their life; for it is quite inconceivable that any cause other than intelligence could be competent to adapt an organism to its environment _suddenly_. On the other hand, it would be proof presumptive of natural selection if it could be shown that one species becomes slowly transmuted into another--_i.e._, that one set of adaptations may be gradually transformed into another set of adaptations according as changing circumstances require. This would be proof presumptive of natural selection, because it would then become amply probable that natural selection might have brought about many, or most, of the cases of adaptations which we see; and if so, the law of parsimony excludes the rival hypothesis of intelligent design. Thus the whole question as between natural selection and supernatural design resolves itself into this--Were all the species of plants and animals separately created, or were they slowly evolved? For if they were specially created, the evidence of supernatural design remains unrefuted and irrefutable; whereas if they were slowly evolved, that evidence has been utterly and for ever destroyed. The doctrine of natural selection therefore depends for its validity on the doctrine of organic evolution; for if once the fact of organic evolution were established, no one would dispute that much of the adaptation was probably effected by natural selection. _How_ much we cannot say--probably never shall be able to say; for even Mr. Darwin himself does not doubt that other causes besides that of natural selection have assisted in the modifying of specific types. For the sake of simplicity, however, I shall not go into this subject; but shall always speak of natural selection as the only cause of organic evolution. Let us, then, weigh the evidence in favour of organic evolution. If we find it wanting, we need have no complaints to make of natural theologians of to-day; but if we find it to be full measure, shaken together and running over, we ought to maintain that natural theologians can no longer adhere to the arguments of such writers as Paley, Bell, and Chalmers, without deliberately violating the only logical principle which separates science from fetishism.  To avoid misapprehension, however, I may here add that while Mr. Darwin's theory is thus in plain and direct contradiction to the theory of design, or system of teleology, as presented by the school of writers which I have named, I hold that Mr. Darwin's theory has no point of logical contact with the theory of design in the larger sense, that behind all secondary causes of a physical kind, there is a primary cause of a mental kind. Therefore throughout this essay I refer to design in the sense understood by the narrower forms of teleology, or as an _immediate_ cause of the observed phenomena. Whether or not there is an _ultimate_ cause of a psychical kind pervading all nature, a _causa causarum_ which is the final _raison d'être_ of the cosmos, this is another question which, as I have said, I take to present no point of logical contact with Mr. Darwin's theory, or, I may add, with any of the methods and results of natural science. The only position, therefore, which I here desire to render plain is that, if the doctrine of evolution is seen to be established by sufficient evidence, and therefore the causes which it sets forth are recognised as adequate to furnish a scientific explanation of the results observed, then the facts of organic nature necessarily fall into the same logical category, with reference to any question of design, as that of all or any other series of facts in the physical universe.  This being understood, I shall now proceed to render an epitome of the evidence in favour of organic evolution, and I shall do so by classifying the arguments in a way tending to show their distinct or independent character, and therefore calculated to display the additional force which they acquire from their cumulative nature.     I.  THE ARGUMENT FROM CLASSIFICATION.   I shall first take the argument from classification. Naturalists find that all species of plants and animals present among themselves structural affinities. According as these structural affinities are more or less pronounced, the various species are classified under genera, orders, families, classes, sub-kingdoms, and kingdoms. Now in such a classification it is found impossible to place all the species in a linear series, according to the grade of their organization. For instance, we cannot say that a wolf is more highly organized than a fox or a jackal; we can only say that the specific points wherein it differs from these animals are without significance as proving the one type to be more highly organized than the others. But of course in many cases, and especially in the cases of the larger divisions, it is often possible to say--The members in this division are more highly organized than are the members in that division. Our system of classification therefore may be likened to a tree, in which a short trunk may be taken to represent the lowest organisms which cannot properly be termed either plants or animals. This short trunk soon separates into two large trunks, one of which represents the vegetable and the other the animal kingdom. Each of these trunks then gives off large branches signifying classes, and these give off smaller, but more numerous branches, signifying families, which ramify again into orders, genera, and finally into the leaves, which may be taken to represent species. Now, in such a representative tree of life, the height of any branch from the ground may be taken to indicate the grade of organization which the leaves, or species, present; so that, if we picture to ourselves such a tree, we will understand that while there is a general advance of organization from below upwards, there are numberless slight variations in this respect between leaves growing even on the same branch; but in a still greater number of cases, leaves growing on the same branch are growing on the same level--that is, although they represent different species, it cannot be said that one is more highly organized than the other. Now, this tree-like arrangement of specific organisms in nature is an arrangement for which Mr. Darwin is not responsible. I mean that the framing of this natural classification has been the work of naturalists for centuries past; and although they did not know what they were doing, it is now evident to evolutionists that they were tracing the lines of genetic relationship. For, be it observed, a scientific or natural classification differs very much from a popular or hap-hazard classification, and the difference consists in this, that while a popular classification is framed with exclusive reference to the external appearance of organisms, a scientific classification is made with reference to the whole structure. A whale, for instance, is often thought to be a fish, because it resembles a fish in form and habits; whereas dissection shows that it is beyond all comparison more unlike a fish than it is like a horse or a man. This is, of course, an extreme case; but it was cases such as this that first led naturalists to see that there are resemblances between organisms much more deep and important than appear upon the surface; and consequently, that if a natural classification was possible at all, it must be made with"]]]
