So there dwelt in high Vidarbha[7]--Bhima, terrible in strength,[8]     With all virtues blest, but childless--long for children had he pined.     Many an holy act, on offspring[9]--still intent, had he performed.     To his court there came a Brahmin,--Damana the seer was named.     Him the child-desiring Bhima--in all duties skilled, received,     Feasted with his royal consort--in his hospitable hall.[10]     Pleased on him the grateful Daman,--and his queen a boon bestowed,     One sweet girl, the pearl of maidens--and three fair and noble sons.     Damayanti, Dama Dánta--and illustrious Damana,     Richly gifted with all virtues--mighty, fearful in their might.     Damayanti with her beauty--with her brilliance, brightness, grace,     Through the worlds unrivalled glory--won the slender-waisted maid.     Her, arrived at bloom of beauty,--sate a hundred slaves around,     And a hundred virgin handmaids--as around great Indra's queen.[11]     In her court shone Bhima's daughter--decked with every ornament,     Mid her handmaids, like the lightning[12]--shone she with her faultless         form;[13]     Like the long-eyed queen of beauty--without rival, without peer.     Never mid the gods immortal--never mid the Yaksha race,[14]     Nor 'mong men was maid so lovely--ever heard of, ever seen,     As the soul-disturbing maiden--that disturbed the souls of gods.     Nala too, 'mong kings the tiger[15]--peerless among earthly men,     Like Kandarpa in his beauty[16]--like that bright-embodied God.     All around Vidarbha's princess--praised they Nala in their joy.     Ever praised they Damayanti--round Nishadha's noble king.     Hearing so each others virtues--all unseen they 'gan to love.     Thus of each, O son of Kunti,[17]--the deep silent passion grew.       Nala, in his heart impatient--longer that deep love to bear,     To the grove, in secret, wandered--by the palace' inmost court.     There the swans he saw disporting[18]--with their wings bedropped with gold:     Through the grove thus lightly moving--one of these bright birds he caught.     But the bird, in human language--thus the wondering king addressed:     \"Slay me not, O gentle monarch!--I will do thee service true;     So in Damayanti's presence--will I praise Nishadha's king,     Never after shall the maiden--think of mortal man but thee.\"       Thus addressed, at once the monarch--let the bright-winged bird depart.     Flew away the swans rejoicing--to Vidarbha straight they flew;     To Vidharba's stately city:--there by Damayanti's feet,     Down with drooping plumes they settled--and she gazed upon the flock,     Wondering at their forms so graceful--where amid her maids she sate.     Sportively began the damsels--all around to chase the birds;     Scattering flew the swans before them--all about the lovely grove.     Lightly ran the nimble maidens,--every one her bird pursued;     But the swan that through the forest--gentle Damayanti chased,     Suddenly, in human language--spake to Damayanti thus.--       \"Damayanti, in Nishadha--Nala dwells, the noble king--     Like the Aswinas in beauty,[19]--peerless among men is he.     O incomparable princess--to this hero wert thou wed,     Noble birth and perfect beauty--not unworthy fruit had borne.     Gods, Gandharvas,[20] men, the Serpents,[21]--and the Rakshasas[22] we've         seen,     All we've seen--of noble Nala--never have we seen the peer.     Pearl art thou among all women--Nala is the pride of men.     If the peerless wed the peerless--blessed must the union be.\"       When the bird thus strangely speaking--gentle Damayanti heard,     Answered thus the wondering maiden--\"Thus to Nala, speak thou too.\"     \"Be it so,\" replied the egg-born--to Vidarbha's beauteous maid.     Home then flew he to Nishadha--and to Nala told it all.     BOOK II.       Damayanti, ever after--she the swan's sweet speech had heard--     With herself she dwelt no longer--all herself with Nala dwelt.     Lost in thought she sate dejected--pale her melancholy cheek,     Damayanti sate and yielded--all her soul to sighs of grief.     Upward gazing, meditative--with a wild distracted look,     Wan was all her soft complexion--and with passion heart-possessed,[23]     Nor in sleep nor gentle converse--nor in banquets found she joy;     Night nor day she could not slumber--Woe! oh woe! she wept and said.     Her no longer her own mistress--from her looks, her gesture, knew     Damayanti's virgin handmaids--to Vidarbha's monarch they     Told how pined his gentle daughter--for the sovereign of men.     This from Damayanti's maidens--when the royal Bhima heard,     In his mind he gravely pondered--for his child what best were done.     \"Wherefore is my gentle daughter--from herself in mind estranged?\"     When the lord of earth his daughter--saw in blooming youth mature,     Knew he for the Swayembara[24]--Damayanti's time was come.     Straight the lord of many peasants[25]--summoned all the chiefs of earth,     \"Come ye to the Swayembara--all ye heroes of the world!\"     Damayanti's Swayembara--soon as heard the kings of men,     All obeyed king Bhima's summons--all to Bhima's court drew near;     Elephants, and steeds, and chariots--swarmed along the sounding land;     All with rich and various garlands[26]--with his stately army each--     All the lofty-minded rajas--Bhima with the arm of strength,     As beseemed, received with honour--on their thrones of state they sate.       At this very hour the wisest--of the sages, the divine,     Moving in their might ascended--up from earth to Indra's world.[27]     Great in holiness and wisdom--Narada and Parvata[28]     Honoured entered they the palace--of the monarch of the gods.     Them salutes the cloud-compeller[29]--of their everlasting weal,     Of their weal the worlds pervading--courteous asks the immortal lord.      NARADA _spake_.      Well it fares with us, Immortal--in our weal the world partakes--     In the world, O cloud-compeller--well it fares with all her kings.      VRIHADASVA _spake_.      He that Bali slew and Vritra--asked of Narada again--     All earth's just and righteous rulers--reckless of their lives in fight--     Who the shafts' descending death-blow--meet with unaverted eye--     Theirs this everlasting kingdom[30]--even as Kamadhuk is mine.[31]     Where are they, the Kshetriya heroes?--wherefore see I not approach     All the earth's majestic guardians--all mine ever-honoured guests.     Thus addressed by holy Sakra[32]--Narada replied and said:     \"Hear me now, O cloud-compeller--why earth's kings appear not here.     Of Vidarbha's king the daughter--Damayanti, the renowned;     Through the earth the loveliest women--in her beauty she transcends--     Soon she holds her Swayembara--soon her lord the maid will choose.     Thither all the kings are hastening--thither all the sons of kings.     Suitors for her hand the rajas--her of all the world the pearl,     O thou mighty giant slayer!--one and all approach to woo.\"       As they spake, the world-protectors[33]--with the god of fire drew near;     Of the immortals all, the highest--stood before the king of gods.     As they all stood silent hearing--Narada's majestic speech,     All exclaimed in sudden rapture--thither we likewise will go;     All the immortals on the instant,--with their chariots, with their hosts,     Hastened down towards Vidarbha--where the lords of earth were met.       Nala, too, no sooner heard he--of that concourse of the kings,     Set he forth, with soul all sanguine--full of Damayanti's love.       Saw the gods, king Nala standing--on the surface of the earth;     Standing in transcendent beauty--equal to the god of love.[34]     Him beheld the world's high guardians--in his radiance like the sun;     Each arrested stood and silent--at his peerless form amazed.     All their chariots the celestials--in the midway air have checked.     Through the blue air then descending--they Nishadha's king address.     Ho! what, ho! Nishadha's monarch--Nala, king, for truth renowned;     Do our bidding, bear our message--O, most excellent of men.     BOOK III.       Nala made his solemn promise,--\"all your bidding will I do;\"     Then with folded hands adoring--humbly of their will enquired.     \"Who are ye? to whom must Nala--as your welcome herald go?     What is my commanded service?--tell me, mighty gods, the truth.\"     Spake the sovereign of Nishadha--Indra answered thus and said:--     \"Know us, the Immortals, hither--come for Damayanti's love.     Indra I, and yon is Agni,--and the king of waters there--     Slayer he of mortal bodies,--Yama, too, is here, O king!     Thou, O Nala, of our coming,--must to Damayanti tell:     Thee to see, the world's dread guardians--Indra and the rest came down,     Indra, Agni, Varun, Yama,--each to seek thine hand are come.     One of these celestial beings,--choose, O maiden, for thy lord.\"     Nala, thus addressed by Indra--with his folded hands replied:     \"Thus with one accord commanding--on this mission send not me.     How can man, himself enamoured--for another plead his cause?     Spare me then, ye gods, in mercy--this unwelcome service, spare.\"      THE GODS _spake_.      \"I will do your bidding freely--thus thou'st said, Nishadha's king;     Wilt thou now belie thy promise?--Nala, go, nor more delay.\"     By the gods adjured so sternly--thus rejoined Nishadha's king--     \"Strictly guarded is yon palace--how may I find entrance there?\"     \"Thou shalt enter;\" thus did Indra--to the unwilling king reply.     In the bower of Damayanti--as they spake, king Nala stood.     There he saw Vidarbha's maiden--girt with all her virgin bands;     In her glowing beauty shining--all excelling in her form;     Every limb in smooth proportion--slender waist and lovely eyes;     Even the moon's soft gleam"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19529"],["title","Nala and Damayanti and Other Poems (#2)"],["body","isdaining--in her own o'erpowering light.     As he gazed, his love grew warmer--to the softly smiling maid,     Yet to keep his truth, his duty--all his passion he suppressed.     Then Nishadha's king beholding--all those maids with beauteous limbs     From their seats sprang up in wonder--at his matchless form amazed.     In their rapture to king Nala--all admiring, homage paid;     Yet, not venturing to accost him,--in their secret souls adored.     \"Oh the beauty! oh the splendour!--oh the mighty hero's strength!     Who is he, or God, or Yaksha--or Gandharba may he be.\"     Not one single word to utter,--dared that fair-limbed maiden band;     All struck dumb before his beauty--in their bashful silence stood.     Smiling, first, upon the monarch--as on her he gently smiled,     Damayanti, in her wonder--to the hero Nala spake:--     \"Who art thou of form so beauteous--thou that wakenest all my love;     Cam'st thou here like an immortal--I would know thee, sinless chief.     How hast entered in our palace?--how hast entered all unseen?     Watchful are our chamber wardens--stern the mandate of the king.\"     By the maiden of Vidarbha--Nala thus addressed, replied:--     \"Know, O loveliest, I am Nala--here the messenger of gods,     Gods desirous to possess thee;--one of these, the lord of heaven     Indra, Agni, Varun, Yama,--choose thou, princess, for thy lord.     Through their power, their power almighty--I have entered here unseen;     As I entered in thy chamber--none hath seen, and none might stay.     This, the object of my mission,--fairest, from the highest gods,     Thou hast heard me, noble princess--even as thou wilt, decide.\"     BOOK IV.       To the gods performed her homage--smiled she, and to Nala spake:--     \"Pledge to me thy faith,[35] O raja--how that faith, may I requite?     I myself, and whatsoever--in the world I have, is thine     In full trust is thine[36]--O grant me--in thy turn thy love, O king!     Tis the swan's enamouring language--that hath kindled all my soul.     Only for thy sake, O hero--are the assembled rajas met.     But if thou mine homage scornest--scornest me, all honoured king,     Poison for thy sake, fire, water,--the vile noose will I endure.\"[37]     So, when spake Vidarbha's maiden--Nala answered thus, and said:--     \"With the world's dread guardians present--wilt thou mortal husband choose?     We with them, the world's creators--with these mighty lords compared,     Lowlier than the dust they tread on--raise to them thy loftier mind.     Man the gods displeasing, hastens--to inevitable death--     Fair limbed! from that fate preserve me--choose the all excelling gods.     Robes by earthly dust unsullied--crowns of amaranthine flowers,     Every bright celestial glory--wedded to the gods, enjoy.     He, who all the world compressing[38]--with devouring might consumes,     Sovereign of the gods, Hutása,--where is she who would not wed?     He, in awe of whose dread sceptre[39]--all the assembled hosts of men,     Cultivate eternal justice--where is she who would not wed?     Him the all-righteous, lofty minded,--slayer of the infernal host,[40]     Of all gods, the mighty monarch,--who is she that would not wed?     Nor let trembling doubt arrest thee--in thy mind if thou couldst choose.[41]     Varuna, amongst earth's guardians,--hear the language of a friend.\"       To the sovereign of Nishadha--Damayanti spake, and said,     And her eyes grew dim with moisture--flowing from her inward grief:--     \"To the gods, to all, my homage--king of earth, I humbly pay;     Yet thee only, thee, my husband--may I choose, Be this my vow!\"     Answered he the trembling maiden--as with folded hands she stood,     \"Bound upon this solemn mission--mine own cause how dare I urge.     Plighted by a sacred promise--to the everlasting gods;     Thus engaged to plead for others--for myself I may not plead.     This my duty; yet hereafter--come I on my own behalf,     Then I'll plead mine own cause boldly--weigh it, beauteous, in thy thought.\"     Damayanti smiled serenely,--and with tear-impeded speech,     Uttered brokenly and slowly--thus to royal Nala spake:--     \"Yet I see a way of refuge--'tis a blameless way, O king;     Whence no sin to thee, O raja,--may by any chance arise.     Thou, O noblest of all mortals--and the gods by Indra led,     Come and enter in together--where the Swayembara meets;     Then will I, before the presence--of the guardians of the world,     Name thee, lord of men! my husband--nor to thee may blame accrue.\"       By the maiden of Vidarbha--royal Nala thus addressed,     Back again returned, where waited--eager, the expecting gods.     Him, the guardians of the world, the mighty--ere he yet drew near, beheld,     Him they saw, and bade him instant--all his tidings to unfold--     \"Was she seen of thee, O monarch--Damayanti with soft smile?     Spake she of us all? what said she?--tell, O blameless lord of earth.\"      NALA _spake_.      To the bower of Damayanti--on your solemn mission sent,     Entered I the lofty portal--by the aged warders watched;     Mortal eye might not behold me--there as swift I entered in;     None save that fair raja's daughter--through your all prevailing power.     And her virgin handmaids, saw I--and by them in turn was seen;     And they all in mute amazement--gazed upon me as I stood.     I described your godlike presence--but the maid with beauteous face     Chooses me, bereft of reason--O most excellent of gods!     Thus she spake, that maiden princess,--\"Let the gods together come,     Come with thee, Oh king of mortals,--where the Swayembara meets;     There will I, before their presence--choose thee, raja, for my lord.     So to thee, O strong armed warrior--may no blame, no fault ensue.\"     Thus it was, even as I tell you--word for word did it befall.     Plainly have I spoke, the judgment--rests with you, of gods the chief!     BOOK V.       Came the day of happy omen[42]--moonday meet, and moment apt;     Bhima to the Swayembara--summoned all the lords of earth.     One and all, upon the instant--rose th' enamoured lords of earth,     Suitors all to Damayanti--in their loving haste they came.     They, the court with golden columns[43]--rich, and glittering portal arch,     Like the lions on the mountains--entered they the hall of state.     There the lords of earth were seated--each upon his several throne;     All their fragrant garlands wearing--all with pendant ear-gems rich.     Arms were seen robust and vigorous--as the ponderous battle mace,     Some like the five-headed serpents--delicate in shape and hue:[44]     With bright locks profuse and flowing--fine formed nose, and eye and brow,     Shone the faces of the rajas--like the radiant stars in heaven.     As with serpents, Bhogavati[45]--the wide hall was full of kings;     As the mountain caves with tigers--with the tiger-warriors full.     Damayanti in her beauty--entered on that stately scene,     With her dazzling light entrancing--every eye and every soul.     O'er her lovely person gliding--all the eyes of those proud kings;     There were fixed, there moveless rested--as they gazed upon the maid.     Then as they proclaimed the rajas--(by his name was each proclaimed)     In dismay saw Bhima's daughter--five in garb, in form the same.     On those forms, all undistinguished--each from each, she stood and gazed.     In her doubt Vidarbha's princess--Nala's form might not discern,[46]     Whichsoe'er the form she gazed on--him her Nala, him she thought.     She within her secret spirit--deeply pondering, stood and thought:     \"How shall I the gods distinguish?--royal Nala how discern?\"     Pondering thus Vidarbha's maiden--in the anguish of her heart--     Th' attributes of the immortals--sought, as heard of yore, to see.     \"Th' attributes of each celestial--that our aged sires describe,     As on earth they stand before me--not of one may I discern.\"     Long she pondered in her silence--and again, again she thought.     To the gods, her only refuge--turned she at this trying hour.     With her voice and with her spirit--she her humble homage paid.     Folding both her hands and trembling--to the gods the maiden spake:     \"As when heard the swan's sweet language--chose I then Nishadha's king,     By this truth I here adjure ye--oh, ye gods, reveal my lord;     As in word or thought I swerve not--from my faith, all-knowing powers,     By this truth I here adjure ye--oh, ye gods, reveal my lord.     As the gods themselves have destined--for my lord Nishadha's king;     By this truth I here adjure ye--oh, ye gods, my lord reveal.     As my vow, so pledged to Nala--holily must be maintained,     By this truth I here adjure ye--oh, ye gods, my lord reveal.     Each the form divine assume ye--earth's protectors, mighty lords;     So shall I discern my Nala--I shall know the king of men.\"       As they heard sad Damayanti--uttering thus her piteous prayer,     At her high resolve they wonder--steadfast truth and fervent love,     Holiness of soul, and wisdom--to her lord her constant faith.     As she prayed, the gods obedient--stood with attributes revealed:     With unmoistened skins the Immortals--saw she, and with moveless eyes;[47]     Fresh their dust-unsullied garlands--hovered they, nor touched the earth.     On his shadow garland-drooping[48]--soiled with dust and moist with sweat,     On the earth Nishadha's monarch--stood confessed, with twinkling eyes;     On the gods an instant gazed she--then upon the king of men;     And of right king Bhima's daughter--named Nishadha's king her lord.     Modestly the large-eyed maiden--lifted up his garment's hem,     Round his shoulders threw she lightly--the bright zone of radiant flowers;     So she chose him for her husband--Nala, that high-hearted maid.     Then alas! alas! burst wildly,--from that conclave of the kings,     And \"well done, well done,\" as loudly--from the gods and"]]]
