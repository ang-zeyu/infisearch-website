Written frankly from the viewpoint of the United States and the Allies, it visualizes the bloodiest and most destructive conflict of all the ages from its remote causes to its glorious conclusion and beneficent results. The world-shaking rise of new democracies is set forth, and the enormous national and individual sacrifices producing that resurrection of human equality are detailed.  Two ideals have been before us in the preparation of this necessary work. These are simplicity and thoroughness. It is of no avail to describe the greatest of human events if the description is so confused that the reader loses interest. Thoroughness is an historical essential beyond price. So it is that official documents prepared in many instances upon the field of battle, and others taken from the files of the governments at war, are the basis of this work. Maps and photographs of unusual clearness and high authenticity illuminate the text. All that has gone into war making, into the regeneration of the world, are herein set forth with historical particularity. The stark horrors of Belgium, the blighting terrors of chemical warfare, the governmental restrictions placed upon hundreds of millions of civilians, the war sacrifices falling upon all the civilized peoples of earth, are in these pages.  It is a book that mankind can well read and treasure.    CHAPTER I  A WAR FOR INTERNATIONAL FREEDOM  \"My FELLOW COUNTRYMEN: The armistice was signed this morning. Everything for which America fought has been accomplished. The war thus comes to an end.\"  Speaking to the Congress and the people of the United States, President Wilson made this declaration on November 11, 1918. A few hours before he made this statement, Germany, the empire of blood and iron, had agreed to an armistice, terms of which were the hardest and most humiliating ever imposed upon a nation of the first class. It was the end of a war for which Germany had prepared for generations, a war bred of a philosophy that Might can take its toll of earth's possessions, of human lives and liberties, when and where it will. That philosophy involved the cession to imperial Germany of the best years of young German manhood, the training of German youths to be killers of men. It involved the creation of a military caste, arrogant beyond all precedent, a caste that set its strength and pride against the righteousness of democracy, against the possession of wealth and bodily comforts, a caste that visualized itself as part of a power-mad Kaiser's assumption that he and God were to shape the destinies of earth.  When Marshal Foch, the foremost strategist in the world, representing the governments of the Allies and the United States, delivered to the emissaries of Germany terms upon which they might surrender, he brought to an end the bloodiest, the most destructive and the most beneficent war the world has known. It is worthy of note in this connection that the three great wars in which the United States of America engaged have been wars for freedom. The Revolutionary War was for the liberty of the colonies; the Civil War was waged for the freedom of manhood and for the principle of the indissolubility of the Union; the World War, beginning 1914, was fought for the right of small nations to self-government and for the right of every country to the free use of the high seas.  More than four million American men were under arms when the conflict ended. Of these, more than two million were upon the fields of France and Italy. These were thoroughly trained in the military art. They had proved their right to be considered among the most formidable soldiers the world has known. Against the brown rock of that host in khaki, the flower of German savagery and courage had broken at Chateau-Thierry. There the high tide of Prussian militarism, after what had seemed to be an irresistible dash for the destruction of France, spent itself in the bloody froth and spume of bitter defeat. There the Prussian Guard encountered the Marines, the Iron Division and the other heroic organizations of America's new army. There German soldiers who had been hardened and trained under German conscription before the war, and who had learned new arts in their bloody trade,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18997"],["title","The Vicomte de Bragelonne; Or, Ten Years Later (#1)"],["body","                            409    C.

I.--_Frontispiece._--Hardly had the ladder been properly placed than the king began to ascend.  II.--As the rain dripped more and more through the foliage of the oak, the king held his hat over the head of the young girl.  III.--D'Artagnan, reclining upon an immense straight-backed chair, with his legs not stretched out, but simply placed upon a stool, formed an angle of the most obtuse form that could possibly be seen.  IV.--De Guiche turned round also, and, at the moment the horse was quiet again, he fired, and the ball carried off De Wardes' hat from his head.  V.--Athos broke his sword across his knee, slowly placed the two pieces upon the floor, and saluting the king, who was almost choking from rage and shame, he quitted the cabinet.  VI.--Raoul, presenting his pistol, threw himself on the leader, commanding the coachman to stop.  VII.--Aramis saw that the young man was stretched upon his bed, his face half-concealed by his arms.  VIII.--\"You will look through the opening, which answers to one of the false windows made in the dome of the king's apartment. Can you see?\"  IX.--\"What is this, monsieur, and what is the meaning of this jest?\" \"It is no jest,\" replied in a deep voice the masked figure that held the lantern.  X.--The king entered into the cell without pronouncing a single word: he was pale and haggard.  XI.--They saw, by the red flashes of the lightning against the violet fog which the wind stamped upon the bankward sky, they saw pass gravely at six paces behind the governor, a man clothed in black and masked by a visor of polished steel, soldered to a helmet of the same nature, which altogether enveloped the whole of his head.  XII.--The Deathbed of Athos--\"Here I am!\"     THE  VICOMTE DE BRAGELONNE.     CHAPTER I.  SHOWING WHAT NEITHER THE NAIAD NOR DRYAD HAD ANTICIPATED.   Saint-Aignan stopped at the foot of the staircase which led to the _entresol_, where the maids of honor were lodged, and to the first floor, where Madame's apartments were situated. Then, by means of one of the servants who was passing, he sent to apprise Malicorne, who was still with Monsieur. After having waited ten minutes, Malicorne arrived, looking full of suspicion and importance. The king drew back toward the darkest part of the vestibule. Saint-Aignan, on the contrary, advanced to meet him, but at the first words, indicating his wish, Malicorne drew back abruptly.  \"Oh! oh!\" he said, \"you want me to introduce you into the rooms of the maids of honor?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"You know very well that I cannot do anything of the kind, without being made acquainted with your object.\"  \"Unfortunately, my dear Monsieur Malicorne, it is quite impossible for me to give you any explanation: you must therefore confide in me as in a friend who got you out of a great difficulty yesterday, and who now begs you to draw him out of one to-day.\"  \"Yet, I told you, monsieur, what my object was; that my object was not to sleep out in the open air, and any man might express the same wish, while you, however, admit nothing.\"  \"Believe me, my dear Monsieur Malicorne,\" Saint-Aignan persisted, \"that if I were permitted to explain myself, I would do so.\"  \"In that case, my dear monsieur, it is impossible for me to allow you to enter Mademoiselle de Montalais's apartment.\"  \"Why so?\"  \"You know why better than any one else, since you caught me on the wall paying my addresses to Mademoiselle de Montalais; it would, therefore, be an excess of kindness, on my part, you will admit, since I am paying my attentions to her, to open the door of her room to you.\"  \"But who told you it was on her account I asked you for the key?\"  \"For whom, then?\"  \"She does not lodge there alone, I suppose?\"  \"No, certainly; for Mademoiselle de la Valliere shares her rooms with her; but, really, you have nothing more to do with Mademoiselle de la Valliere than with Mademoiselle de Montalais, and there are only two men to whom I would give this key; to M. de Bragelonne, if he begged me to give it him, and to the king if he ordered me to do so.\"  \"In that case, give me the key, monsieur, I order you to do so,\" said the king, advancing from the obscurity, and partially opening his cloak. \"Mademoiselle de Montalais will step down to talk with you, while we go upstairs to Mademoiselle de la Valliere, for, in fact, it is she only whom we require.\"  \"The king,\" exclaimed Malicorne, bowing down to the very ground.  \"Yes, the king,\" said Louis, smiling, \"the king, who is as pleased with your resistance as with your capitulation. Rise, monsieur, and render us the service we request of you.\"  \"I obey your majesty,\" said Malicorne, leading the way up the staircase.  \"Get Mademoiselle de Montalais to come down,\" said the king, \"and do not breathe a word to her of my visit.\"  Malicorne bowed in sign of obedience, and proceeded up the staircase. But the king, after a hasty reflection, followed him, and that, too, with such rapidity, that although Malicorne was already more than half-way up the staircase, the king reached the room at the same moment he did. He then observed by the door which remained half-opened behind Malicorne, La Valliere, sitting in an armchair with her head thrown back, and in the opposite corner Montalais, who, in her dressing-gown, was standing before a looking-glass, engaged in arranging her hair, and parleying all the while with Malicorne. The king hurriedly opened the door, and entered the room. Montalais called out at the noise made by the opening of the door, and, recognizing the king, made her escape. La Valliere rose from her seat, like a dead person who had been galvanized, and then fell back again in her armchair. The king advanced slowly toward her.  \"You wished for an audience, I believe,\" he said, coldly; \"I am ready to hear you. Speak.\"  Saint-Aignan, faithful to his character of being deaf, blind, and dumb, had stationed himself in a corner of the door, upon a stool which he fortuitously found there. Concealed by the tapestry which covered the doorway, and leaning his back against the wall, he could in this way listen without been seen; resigning himself to the post of a good watch-dog, who patiently waits and watches without ever getting in his master's way.  La Valliere, terror-stricken at the king's irritated aspect, again rose a second time, and assuming a posture of humility and entreaty, murmured, \"Forgive me, sire.\"  \"What need is there for my forgiveness?\" asked Louis.  \"Sire, I have been guilty of a great fault; nay, more than a great fault, a great crime.\"  \"You?\"  \"Sire, I have offended your majesty.\"  \"Not the slightest degree in the world,\" replied Louis XIV.  \"I implore you, sire, not to maintain toward me that terrible seriousness of manner which reveals your majesty's just anger. I feel I have offended you, sire; but I wish to explain to you how it was that I have not offended you of my own accord.\"  \"In the first place,\" said the king, \"in what way can you possibly have offended me? I cannot perceive how. Surely not on account of a"]]]
