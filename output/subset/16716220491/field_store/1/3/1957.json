He reigned forty-six years.  The tomb of Edward III., of copper, gilt, with this epitaph:      Of English kings here lieth the beauteous flower     Of all before past, and myrror to them shall sue:     A merciful king, of peace conservator,     The third Edward, &c.  Besides the tomb are these words:            Edward III., whose fame has reached to heaven.  A.D. 1377.                            Fight for your country.  Here is shown his sword, eight feet in length, which they say he used in the conquest of France.  His queen’s epitaph:       Here lies Queen Philippa, wife of Edward III.  Learn to live.  A.D.                                     1369.  At a little distance, the tomb of Henry V., with this legend:       Henry, the scourge of France, lies in this tomb.  Virtue subdues all                              things.  A.D. 1422.  Near this lies the coffin of Catherine, unburied, and to be opened by anyone that pleases.  On the outside is this inscription:           Fair Catherine is at length united to her lord.  A.D. 1437.                                 Shun idleness.  The tomb of Henry III., of brass, gilt, with this epitaph:          Henry III., the founder of this cathedral.  A.D. 1273.  War is                        delightful to the unexperienced.  It was this Henry who, one hundred and sixty years after Edward the Confessor had built this church, took it down, and raised an entire new one of beautiful architecture, supported by rows of marble columns, and its roof covered with sheets of lead, a work of fifty years before its completion.  It has been much enlarged at the west end by the abbots. After the expulsion of the monks, it experienced many changes; first it had a dean and prebendaries; then a bishop, who, having squandered the revenues, resigned it again to a dean.  In a little time, the monks with their abbot were reinstated by Queen Mary; but, they being soon ejected again by authority of parliament, it was converted into a cathedral church—nay, into a seminary for the Church—by Queen Elizabeth, who instituted there twelve prebendaries, an equal number of invalid soldiers, and forty scholars; who at a proper time are elected into the universities, and are thence transplanted into the Church and State.  Next to be seen is the tomb of Eleanor, daughter of Alphonso King of Spain, and wife of Edward I., with this inscription:                      This Eleanor was consort of Edward I.                           A.D. 1298.  Learn to die.  The tomb of Elizabeth, daughter of Henry VII.  In the middle of this chapel is the shrine of St. Edward, the last King of the Saxons.  It is composed of marble in mosaic: round it runs this inscription in letters of gold:                  The venerable king, St. Edward the Confessor,                       A heroe adorned with every virtue.                      He died on the 5th of January, 1065,                            And mounted into Heaven.                              Lift up your hearts.  The third choir, of surprising splendour and elegance, was added to the east end by Henry VII. for a burying-place for himself and his posterity. Here is to be seen his magnificent tomb, wrought of brass and marble, with this epitaph:      Here lies Henry VII. of that name, formerly King of England, son of     Edmund, Earl of Richmond, who, ascending the throne on the     twenty-second day of August, was crowned on the thirtieth of October     following at Westminster, in the year of our Lord 1485.  He died on     the twenty-first of April, in the fifty-third year of his age, after     a reign of twenty-two years and eight months wanting a day.  This monument is enclosed with rails of brass, with a long epitaph in Latin verse.  Under the same tomb lies buried Edward VI., King of England, son of Henry VIII. by Jane Seymour.  He succeeded to his father when he was but nine years old, and died A.T. 1553, on the 6th of July, in the sixteenth year of his age, and of his reign the seventh, not without suspicion of poison.  Mary was proclaimed queen by the people on the 19th of July, and died in November, 1558, and is buried in some corner of the same choir, without any inscription.                                 Queen Elizabeth.      Here lies Queen Elizabeth, daughter of Edward IV., sister of King     Edward V., wife of Henry VII., and the glorious mother of Henry VIII.     She died in the Tower of London, on the eleventh of February, A.D.     1502, in the thirty-seventh year of her age.  Between the second and third choirs in the side-chapels, are the tombs of Sebert, King of the East Saxons, who built this church with stone: and  Of Margaret of Richmond, mother of Henry VII., grandmother of Henry VIII.; she gave this monastery to the monks of Winbourne, {27} who preached and taught grammar all England over, and appointed salaries to two professors of divinity, one at Oxford, another at Cambridge, where she founded two colleges to Christ and to John His disciple.  She died A.D. 1463, on the third of the calends of July.  And of Margaret, Countess of Lenox, grandmother of James VI., King of Scotland.  William of Valance, half-brother of Henry III.  The Earl of Cornwall, brother of Edward III.  Upon another tomb is an honorary inscription for Frances, Duchess of Suffolk.  The sense of it is,      That titles, royal birth, riches, or a large family, are of no avail:     That all are transitory; virtue alone resisting the funeral pile.     That this lady was first married to a duke, then to Stoke, a     gentleman;     And lastly, by the grave espoused to CHRIST.  The next is the tomb of Lord Russell, son of the Earl of Bedford, whose lady composed the following Greek and Latin verses, and had them engraved on the marble:—      How was I startled at the cruel feast,     By death’s rude hands in horrid manner drest;     Such grief as sure no hapless woman knew,     When thy pale image lay before my view.     Thy father’s heir in beauteous form arrayed     Like flowers in spring, and fair, like them to fade;     Leaving behind unhappy wretched me,     And all thy little orphan-progeny:     Alike the beauteous face, the comely air,     The tongue persuasive, and the actions fair,     Decay: so learning too in time shall waste:     But faith, chaste lovely faith, shall ever last.     The once bright glory of his house, the pride     Of all his country, dusty ruins hide:     Mourn, hapless orphans; mourn, once happy wife;     For when he died, died all the joys of life.     Pious and just, amidst a large estate,     He got at once the name of good and great.     He made no flatt’ring parasite his guest,     But asked the good companions to the feast.  Anne, Countess of Oxford, daughter of William Cecil, Baron Burleigh, and Lord Treasurer.  Philippa, daughter and co-heiress of John, Lord Mohun of Dunster, wife of Edward, Duke of York.  Frances, Countess of Sussex, of the ancient family of Sidney.  Thomas Bromley, Chancellor to Queen Elizabeth.  The Earl of Bridgewater, {29} Lord Dawbney, Lord Chamberlain to Henry VII., and his lady.  And thus much for Westminster.  There are many other churches in this city, but none so remarkable for the tombs of persons of distinction.  Near to this church is Westminster Hall, where, besides the Sessions of Parliament, which are often held there, are the Courts of Justice; and at stated times are heard their trials in law, or concerning the king’s patrimony, or in chancery, which moderates the severity of the common law by equity.  Till the time of Henry I. the Prime Court of Justice was movable, and followed the King’s Court, but he enacted by the Magna Charta that the common pleas should no longer attend his Court, but be held at some determined place.  The present hall was built by King Richard II. in the place of an ancient one which he caused to be taken down.  He made it part of his habitation (for at that time the Kings of England determined causes in their own proper person, and from the days of Edward the Confessor had their palace adjoining), till, above sixty years since, upon its being burnt, Henry VIII. removed the royal residence to Whitehall, situated in the neighbourhood, which a little before was the house of Cardinal Wolsey.  This palace is truly royal, enclosed on one side by the Thames, on the other by a park, which connects it with St. James’s, another royal palace.  In the chamber where the Parliament is usually held, the seats and wainscot are made of wood, the growth of Ireland; said to have that occult quality, that all poisonous animals are driven away by it; and it is affirmed for certain, that in Ireland there are neither serpents, toads, nor any other venomous creature to be found.  Near this place are seen an immense number of swans, who wander up and down the river for some miles, in great security; nobody daring to molest, much less kill any of them, under penalty of a considerable fine.  In Whitehall are the following things worthy of observation:—  I.  The Royal Library, well stored with Greek, Latin, Italian and French books; amongst the rest, a little one in French upon parchment, in the handwriting of the present reigning Queen Elizabeth, thus inscribed:—                To the most high, puissant, and redoubted prince,                Henry VIII. of the name, King of England, France                      and Ireland, Defender of the Faith;                      Elizabeth, his most humble daughter.                             Health and obedience.  All these books are bound in velvet in different colours, though chiefly red, with clasps of gold and silver; some have pearls and precious stones set in their bindings.  II.  Two little silver cabinets of exquisite work, in which the Queen keeps her paper, and which she uses for writing boxes.  III.  The Queen’s bed, ingeniously composed of woods of different colours, with quilts of silk, velvet, gold, silver, and "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19921"],["title","Prehistoric Textile Art of Eastern United States (#1)"],["body","art to secure a prominent place in the field of archeologic evidence is due to the susceptibility of the products to decay. Examples of archaic work survive to us only by virtue of exceptionally favorable circumstances; it rarely happened that mound fabrics were so conditioned, as the soil in which they were buried is generally porous and moist; they were in some cases preserved through contact with objects of copper, the oxides of that metal having a tendency to arrest decay. The custom of burial in caves and rock shelters has led to the preservation of numerous fabrics through the agency of certain salts with which the soil is charged. Preservation by charring is common, and it is held by some that carbonization without the agency of fire has in some cases taken place.  Considerable knowledge of the fabrics of the ancient North American tribes is preserved in a way wholly distinct from the preceding. The primitive potter employed woven textiles in the manufacture of earthenware; during the processes of construction the fabrics were impressed on the soft clay, and when the vessels were baked the impressions became fixed. The study of these impressions led to meager results until the idea was conceived of taking castings from them in clay, wax, or paper; through this device the negative impression becomes a positive reproduction and the fabrics are shown in relief, every feature coming out with surprising distinctness; it is possible even to discover the nature of the threads employed and to detect the manner of their combination.  Evidence of the practice of textile arts by many ancient nations is preserved to us by such implements of weaving as happened to be of enduring materials; spindle-whorls in clay and stone are perhaps the most common of these relics. These objects tell us definitely of the practice of the art, but give little insight into the character of the products. It is a notable fact that evidence of this class is almost wholly wanting in the United States; spindle-whorls have in rare cases been reported from southern localities, and a few writers have mentioned their use by modern tribes.  It happens that in some cases we may learn something of the progress made by vanished peoples in this art by a study of the forms of such of their earthen vessels as were manifestly derived from baskets, or made in imitation of them. The ornamental art of peoples well advanced in culture often bears evidence of the influence of the system of combination of parts followed originally in the textile arts, and little art, ancient or modern, in which men have endeavored to embody beauty, is without strongly marked traces of this influence. By the study of archaic ornament embodied in clay, wood, and stone, therefore, the archeologist may hope to add something to the sum of his knowledge of ancient textiles. It should be noted that the pottery of the mound-builders shows less evidence of the influence of textile forms than does that of most other nations, and some groups of their ware appear to present no recognizable traces of it whatever.  Although much information has been brought together from all of the sources mentioned, it is not at all certain that we can form anything like a complete or correct notion of the character and scope of the art as practiced by the mound-builders. No doubt the finest articles of apparel were often buried with the dead, but a very small fraction only of the mortuary wrappings or costumes has been preserved, and from vast areas once thickly inhabited by the most advanced tribes nothing whatever has been collected. Of embroideries, featherwork, and the like, so frequently mentioned by early travelers, hardly a trace is left.  The relations of our historic tribes to the ancient peoples of our continent and to all of the nations, ancient and modern, who built mounds and earthworks, are now generally considered so intimate that no objection can be raised to the utilization of the accounts of early explorers in the elucidation of such features of the art as archeology has failed to record. The first step in this study may consist quite properly of a review of what is recorded of the historic art. Subsequently the purely archeologic data will be given.     PRODUCTS OF THE ART.   In undertaking to classify the textile fabrics of the mound region it is found that, although there is an unbroken gradation from the rudest and heaviest textile constructions to the most delicate and refined textures, a number of well-marked divisions may be made. The broadest of these is based on the use of spun as opposed to unspun strands or parts, a classification corresponding somewhat closely to the division into rigid and pliable forms. Material, method of combination of parts, and function may each be made the basis of classification, but for present purposes a simple presentation of the whole body of products, beginning with the rudest or most primitive forms and ending with the most elaborate and artistic products, is sufficient. The material will be presented in the following order: (1) Wattle work; (2) basketry; (3) matting; (4) pliable fabrics or cloths.   WATTLE WORK.  The term wattling is applied to such constructions as employ by interlacing, plaiting, etc., somewhat heavy, rigid, or slightly pliable parts, as rods, boughs, canes, and vines. Primitive shelters and dwellings are very often constructed in this manner, and rafts, cages, bridges, fish weirs, and inclosures of various kinds were and still are made or partly made in this manner. As a matter of course, few of these constructions are known to us save through historic channels; but traces of wattle work are found in the mounds of the lower Mississippi valley, where imprints of the interlaced canes occur in the baked clay plaster with which the dwellings were finished. When we consider the nature of the materials at hand, and the close correspondence in habits and customs of our prehistoric peoples with the tribes found living by the earliest explorers and settlers, we naturally conclude that this class of construction was very common at all known periods of native American history.  The constructors of native dwellings generally employed pliable branches or saplings, which are bound together with vines, twigs, and other more pliable woody forms. John Smith says of the Indians of Virginia[1] that--      Their houses are built like our Arbors, of small young     springs bowed and tyed, and so close covered with Mats, or     the barkes of trees very handsomely, that notwithstanding     either winde, raine, or weather, they are as warm as stooues,     but very smoaky, yet at the toppe of the house there is a     hole made for the smoake to goe into right over the fire.     [1] Hist. Virginia, John Smith. Richmond, 1819, vol. I, p.    130.  Butel-Dumont also, in describing the dwellings of the Natchez Indians of the lower Mississippi region, speaks of the door of an Indian cabin \"made of dried canes fastened and interlaced on two other canes placed across.\"[2]  A singular use of wattle work is mentioned by Lafitau. He states that the young men, when going through the ordeal of initiation on attaining their majority, were placed apart in--      An inclosure very strongly built, made expressly for this     purpose, one of which I saw in 1694, which belonged to the     Indians of Paumaünkie. It was in the form of a sugar loaf and     was open on all sides like a trellis to admit the air.[3]  Of a somewhat similar nature was the construction of biers described by Butel-Dumont. Speaking of the Mobilians, he says:      When their chief is dead they proceed as follows: At 15 or 20     feet from his cabin they erect a kind of platform raised     about 4½ feet from the ground. This is composed of four     large forked poles of oak wood planted in the earth, with     others placed across; this is covered with canes bound and     interlaced so as to resemble greatly the bed used by the     natives.[4]  According to John Lawson, similarly constructed \"hurdles\" were in use among the Carolina Indians.  [Illustration: 1.--Fish weir of the Virginia Indiana (after Hariot).]  The tide-water tribes of the Atlantic coast region made very frequent use of fish weirs, which were essentially textile in character. John Smith mentions their use in Virginia, and Hariot gives a number of plates in which the weirs are delineated. The cut here given (figure 1) is from Hariot's plate XIII. It represents a very elaborate trap; much simpler forms are shown in other plates. Slender poles set in the shallow water are held in place by wattling or interlacing of pliable parts.  It is probable that traps of similar character were used by the mound-building tribes wherever the conditions were favorable. The only apparent traces of such weirs yet found in any part of the country are a number of stumps of stakes discovered by H. T. Cresson in Delaware river near Wilmington, but these appear to be much heavier than would have been used for the purpose by the natives.  Another somewhat usual use of wattling is mentioned by various authors. Butel-Dumont speaks of a raft made of poles and canes, and Du Pratz, writing of the Louisiana Indians, says:      The conveniencies for passing rivers would soon be suggested     to them by the floating of wood upon the water. Accordingly     one of their methods of crossing rivers is upon floats of     canes, which are called by them Cajeu, and are formed in this     manner. They cut a great number of canes, which they tie up     into faggots, part of which they fasten together sideways,     and over these they lay a few crossways, binding all close     together, and then launching it into the water.[5]  We learn from various authors that cage-like coffins were constructed of canes and reeds something after the wattle style; and hampers, cages for animals, chests for treasures or regalia, biers, carrying chairs, fish baskets, beds and seats"]]]
