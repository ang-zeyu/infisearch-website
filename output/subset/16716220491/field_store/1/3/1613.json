She did not reply, but, pale and sorrowful, glided from the room to weep bitter tears in the seclusion of her chamber.     Chapter II. A Stranger Visitor.   Curtis Waring followed the retreating form of his cousin with a sardonic smile.  \"She is in the toils! She cannot escape me!\" he muttered. \"But\"--and here his brow darkened--\"it vexes me to see how she repels my advances, as if I were some loathsome thing! If only she would return my love--for I do love her, cold as she is--I should be happy. Can there be a rival? But no! we live so quietly that she has met no one who could win her affection. Why can she not turn to me? Surely, I am not so ill-favored, and though twice her age, I am still a young man. Nay, it is only a young girl's caprice. She shall yet come to my arms, a willing captive.\"  His thoughts took a turn, as he arose from his seat, and walked over to the secretary.  \"So it is here that the two wills are deposited!\" he said to himself; \"one making me a rich man, the other a beggar! While the last is in existence I am not safe. The boy may be alive, and liable to turn up at any moment. If only he were dead--or the will destroyed----\" Here he made a suggestive pause.  He took a bunch of keys from his pocket, and tried one after another, but without success. He was so absorbed in his work that he did not notice the entrance of a dark-browed, broad-shouldered man, dressed in a shabby corduroy suit, till the intruder indulged in a short cough, intended to draw attention.  Starting with guilty consciousness, Curtis turned sharply around, and his glance fell on the intruder.  \"Who are you?\" he demanded, angrily. \"And how dare you enter a gentleman's house unbidden?\"  \"Are you the gentleman?\" asked the intruder, with intentional insolence.  \"Yes.\"  \"You own this house?\"  \"Not at present. It is my uncle's.\"  \"And that secretary--pardon my curiosity--is his?\"  \"Yes; but what business is it of yours?\"  \"Not much. Only it makes me laugh to see a gentleman picking a lock. You should leave such business to men like me!\"  \"You are an insolent fellow!\" said Curtis, more embarrassed than he liked to confess, for this rough-looking man had become possessed of a dangerous secret. \"I am my uncle's confidential agent, and it was on business of his that I wished to open the desk.\"  \"Why not go to him for the key?\"  \"Because he is sick. But, pshaw! why should I apologize or give any explanation to you? What can you know of him or me?\"  \"More, perhaps, than you suspect,\" said the intruder, quietly.  \"Then, you know, perhaps, that I am my uncle's heir?\"  \"Don't be too sure of that.\"  \"Look here, fellow,\" said Curtis, thoroughly provoked, \"I don't know who you are nor what you mean, but let me inform you that your presence here is an intrusion, and the sooner you leave the house the better!\"  \"I will leave it when I get ready.\"  Curtis started to his feet, and advanced to his visitor with an air of menace.  \"Go at once,\" he exclaimed, angrily, \"or I will kick you out of the door!\"  \"What's the matter with the window?\" returned the stranger, with an insolent leer.  \"That's as you prefer, but if you don't leave at once I will eject you.\"  By way of reply, the rough visitor coolly seated himself in a luxurious easy-chair, and, looking up into the angry face of Waring, said:  \"Oh, no, you won't.\"  \"And why not, may I ask?\" said Curtis, with a feeling of uneasiness for which he could not account.  \"Why not? Because, in that case, I should seek an interview with your uncle, and tell him----\"  \"What?\"  \"That his son still lives; and that I can restore him to his----\"  The face of Curtis Waring blanched; he staggered as if he had been struck; and he cried out, hoarsely:  \"It is a lie!\"  \"It is the truth, begging your pardon. Do you mind my smoking?\" and he coolly produced a common clay pipe, filled and lighted it.  \"Who are you?\" asked Curtis, scanning the man's features with painful anxiety.  \"Have you forgotten Tim Bolton?\"  \"Are you Tim Bolton?\" faltered Curtis.  \"Yes; but you don't seem glad to see me?\"  \"I thought you were----\"  \"In Australia. So I was three years since. Then I got homesick, and came back to New York.\"  \"You have been here three years?\"  \"Yes,\" chuckled Bolton. \"You didn't suspect it, did you?\"  \"Where?\" asked Curtis, in a hollow voice.  \"I keep a saloon on the Bowery. There's my card. Call around when convenient.\"  Curtis was about to throw the card into the grate, but on second thought dropped it into his pocket.  \"And the boy?\" he asked, slowly.  \"Is alive and well. He hasn't been starved. Though I dare say you wouldn't have grieved if he had.\"  \"And he is actually in this city?\"  \"Just so.\"  \"Does he know anything of--you know what I mean.\"  \"He doesn't know that he is the son of a rich man, and heir to the property which you look upon as yours. That's what you mean, isn't it?\"  \"Yes. What is he doing? Is he at work?\"  \"He helps me some in the saloon, sells papers in the evenings, and makes himself generally useful.\"  \"Has he any education?\"  \"Well, I haven't sent him to boarding school or college,\" answered Tim. \"He don't know no Greek, or Latin, or mathematics--phew, that's a hard word. You didn't tell me you wanted him made a scholar of.\"  \"I didn't. I wanted never to see or hear from him again. What made you bring him back to New York?\"  \"Couldn't keep away, governor. I got homesick, I did. There ain't but one Bowery in the world, and I hankered after that----\"  \"Didn't I pay you money to keep away, Tim Bolton?\"  \"I don't deny it; but what's three thousand dollars? Why, the kid's cost me more than that. I've had the care of him for fourteen years, and it's only about two hundred a year.\"  \"You have broken your promise to me!\" said Curtis, sternly.  \"There's worse things than breaking your promise,\" retorted Bolton.  Scarcely had he spoken than a change came over his face, and he stared open-mouthed behind him and beyond Curtis.  Startled himself, Curtis turned, and saw, with a feeling akin to dismay, the tall figure of his uncle standing on the threshold of the left portal, clad in a morning gown, with his eyes fixed inquiringly upon Bolton and himself.     Chapter III. An Unholy Compact.   \"Who is that man, Curtis?\" asked John Linden, pointing his thin finger at Tim Bolton, who looked strangely out of place, as, with clay pipe, he sat in the luxurious library on a sumptuous chair.  \"That man?\" stammered Curtis, quite at a loss what to say.  \"Yes.\"  \"He is a poor man out of luck, who has applied to me for assistance,\" answered Curtis, recovering his wits.  \"That's it, governor,\" said Bolton, thinking it necessary to confirm the statement. \"I've got five small children at home almost starvin', your honor.\"  \"That is sad. What is your business, my man?\"  It was Bolton's turn to be embarrassed.  \"My business?\" he repeated.  \"That is what I said.\"  \"I'm a blacksmith, but I'm willing to do any honest work.\"  \"That is commendable; but don't you know that it is very ill-bred to smoke a pipe in a gentleman's house?\"  \"Excuse me, governor!\"  And Bolton extinguished his pipe, and put it away in a pocket of his corduroy coat.  \"I was just telling him the same thing,\" said Curtis. \"Don't trouble yourself any further, uncle. I will inquire into the man's circumstances, and help him if I can.\"  \"Very well, Curtis. I came down because I thought I heard voices.\"  John Linden slowly returned to his chamber, and left the two alone.  \"The governor's getting old,\" said Bolton. \"When I was butler here, fifteen years ago, he looked like a young man. He didn't suspect that he had ever seen me before.\"  \"Nor that you had carried away his son, Bolton.\"  \"Who hired me to do it? Who put me up to the job, as far as that goes?\"  \"Hush! Walls have ears. Let us return to business.\"  \"That suits me.\"  \"Look here, Tim Bolton,\" said Curtis, drawing up a chair, and lowering his voice to a confidential pitch, \"you say you want money?\"  \"Of course I do.\"  \"Well, I don't give money for nothing.\"  \"I know that. What's wanted now?\"  \"You say the boy is alive?\"  \"He's very much alive.\"  \"Is there any necessity for his living?\" asked Curtis, in a sharp, hissing tone, fixing his eyes searchingly on Bolton, to see how his hint would be taken.  \"You mean that you want me to murder him?\" said Bolton, quickly.  \"Why not? You don't look over scrupulous.\"  \"I am a bad man, I admit it,\" said Bolton, with a gesture of repugnance, \"a thief, a low blackguard, perhaps, but, thank Heaven! I am no murderer! And if I was, I wouldn't spill a drop of that boy's blood for the fortune that is his by right.\"  \"I didn't give you credit for so much sentiment, Bolton,\" said Curtis, with a sneer. \"You don't look like it, but appearances are deceitful. We'll drop the subject. You can serve me in another way. Can you open this secretary?\"  \"Yes; that's in my line.\"  \"There is a paper in it that I want. It is my uncle's will. I have a curiosity to read it.\"  \"I understand. Well, I'm agreeable.\"  \"If you find any money or valuables, you are welcome to them. I only want the paper. When will you make the attempt?\"  \"To-morrow night. When will it be safe?\"  \"At eleven o'clock. We all retire early in this house. Can you force an entrance?\"  \"Yes; but it will be better for you to leave the outer door unlocked.\"  \"I have a better plan. Here is my latchkey.\"  \"Good! I may not do the job myself, but I will see that it is done. How shall I know the will?\"  \"It is in a big envelope, tied with a narrow tape. Probably it is inscribed: 'My will.'\"  \"Suppose I succeed, when shall I see you?\"  \"I will come around to your place on the Bowery. Good-night!\"  Curtis Waring saw Bolton to the door, and let him out. Returning, he flung himself on a sofa.  \"I can make that man useful!\" he reflected. \"There is an element of danger in the boy's presence in New"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18581"],["title","Adrift in New York: Tom and Florence Braving the World (#2)"],["body","k; but it will go hard if I can't get rid of him! Tim Bolton is unexpectedly squeamish, but there are others to whom I can apply. With gold everything is possible. It's time matters came to a finish. My uncle's health is rapidly failing-- the doctor hints that he has heart disease--and the fortune for which I have been waiting so long will soon be mine, if I work my cards right. I can't afford to make any mistakes now.\"     Chapter IV. Florence.   Florence Linden sat in the library the following evening in an attitude of depression. Her eyelids were swollen, and it was evident she had been weeping. During the day she had had an interview with her uncle, in which he harshly insisted upon her yielding to his wishes, and marrying her cousin, Curtis.  \"But, uncle,\" she objected, \"I do not love him.\"  \"Marry him, and love will come.\"  \"Never!\" she said, vehemently.  \"You speak confidently, miss,\" said Mr. Linden, with irritation.  \"Listen, Uncle John. It is not alone that I do not love him. I dislike him--I loathe--him.\"  \"Nonsense! that is a young girl's extravagant nonsense.\"  \"No, uncle.\"  \"There can be no reason for such a foolish dislike. What can you have against him?\"  \"It is impressed upon me, uncle, that Curtis is a bad man. There is something false--treacherous--about him.\"  \"Pooh! child! you are more foolish than I thought. I don't say Curtis is an angel. No man is; at least, I never met any such. But he is no worse than the generality of men. In marrying him you will carry out my cherished wish. Florence, I have not long to live. I shall be glad to see you well established in life before I leave you. As the wife of Curtis you will have a recognized position. You will go on living in this house, and the old home will be maintained.\"  \"But why is it necessary for me to marry at all, Uncle John?\"  \"You will be sure to marry some one. Should I divide my fortune between you and Curtis, you would become the prey of some unscrupulous fortune hunter.\"  \"Better that than become the wife of Curtis Waring----\"  \"I see, you are incorrigible,\" said her uncle, angrily. \"Do you refuse obedience to my wishes?\"  \"Command me in anything else, Uncle John, and I will obey,\" pleaded Florence.  \"Indeed! You only thwart me in my cherished wish, but are willing to obey me in unimportant matters. You forget the debt you owe me.\"  \"I forget nothing, dear uncle. I do not forget that, when I was a poor little child, helpless and destitute, you took me in your arms, gave me a home, and have cared for me from that time to this as only a parent could.\"  \"You remember that, then?\"  \"Yes, uncle. I hope you will not consider me wholly ungrateful.\"  \"It only makes matters worse. You own your obligations, yet refuse to make the only return I desire. You refuse to comfort me in the closing days of my life by marrying your cousin.\"  \"Because that so nearly concerns my happiness that no one has a right to ask me to sacrifice all I hold dear.\"  \"I see you are incorrigible,\" said John Linden, stormily. \"Do you know what will be the consequences?\"  \"I am prepared for all.\"  \"Then listen! If you persist in balking me, I shall leave the entire estate to Curtis.\"  \"Do with your money as you will, uncle. I have no claim to more than I have received.\"  \"You are right there; but that is not all.\"  Florence fixed upon him a mute look of inquiry.  \"I will give you twenty-four hours more to come to your senses. Then, if you persist in your ingratitude and disobedience, you must find another home.\"  \"Oh, uncle, you do not mean that?\" exclaimed Florence, deeply moved.  \"I do mean it, and I shall not allow your tears to move me. Not another word, for I will not hear it. Take twenty-four hours to think over what I have said.\"  Florence bowed her head on her hands, and gave herself up to sorrowful thoughts. But she was interrupted by the entrance of the servant, who announced:  \"Mr. Percy de Brabazon.\"  An effeminate-looking young man, foppishly dressed, followed the servant into the room, and made it impossible for Florence to deny herself, as she wished to do.  \"I hope I see you well, Miss Florence,\" he simpered.  \"Thank you, Mr. de Brabazon,\" said Florence, coldly. \"I have a slight headache.\"  \"I am awfully sorry, I am, upon my word, Miss Florence. My doctor tells me it is only those whose bwains are vewy active that are troubled with headaches.\"  \"Then, I presume, Mr. de Brabazon,\" said Florence, with intentional sarcasm, \"that you never have a headache.\"  \"Weally, Miss Florence, that is vewy clevah. You will have your joke.\"  \"It was no joke, I assure you, Mr. de Brabazon.\"  \"I--I thought it might be. Didn't I see you at the opewa last evening?\"  \"Possibly. I was there.\"  \"I often go to the opewa. It's so--so fashionable, don't you know?\"  \"Then you don't go to hear the music?\"  \"Oh, of course, but one can't always be listening to the music, don't you know. I had a fwiend with me last evening--an Englishman--a charming fellow, I assure you. He's the second cousin of a lord, and yet--you'll hardly credit it--we're weally vewy intimate. He tells me, Miss Florence, that I'm the perfect image of his cousin, Lord Fitz Noodle.\"  \"I am not at all surprised.\"  \"Weally, you are vewy kind, Miss Florence. I thought it a great compliment. I don't know how it is, but evewybody takes me for an Englishman. Strange, isn't it?\"  \"I am very glad.\"  \"May I ask why, Miss Florence?\"  \"Because---- Well, perhaps I had better not explain. It seems to give you pleasure. You would, probably, prefer to be an Englishman.\"  \"I admit that I have a great admiration for the English character. It's a gweat pity we have no lords in America. Now, if you would only allow me to bring my English fwiend here----  \"I don't care to make any new acquaintances. Even if I did, I prefer my own countrymen. Don't you like America, Mr. de Brabazon?\"  \"Oh, of courth, if we only had some lords here.\"  \"We have plenty of flunkeys.\"  \"That's awfully clevah, 'pon my word.\"  \"Is it? I am afraid you are too complimentary. You are very good-natured.\"  \"I always feel good-natured in your company, Miss Florence. I--wish I could always be with you.\"  \"Really! Wouldn't that be a trifle monotonous?\" asked Florence, sarcastically.  \"Not if we were married,\" said Percy, boldly breaking the ice.  \"What do you mean, Mr. de Brabazon?\"  \"I hope you will excuse me, Miss Florence--Miss Linden, I mean; but I'm awfully in love with you, and have been ever so long--but I never dared to tell you so. I felt so nervous, don't you know? Will you marry me? I'll be awfully obliged if you will.\"  Mr. de Brabazon rather awkwardly slipped from his chair, and sank on one knee before Florence.  \"Please arise, Mr. de Brabazon,\" said Florence, hurriedly. \"It is quite out of the question--what you ask--I assure you.\"  \"Ah! I see how it is,\" said Percy, clasping his hands sadly. \"You love another.\"  \"Not that I am aware of.\"  \"Then I may still hope?\"  \"I cannot encourage you, Mr. de Brabazon. My heart is free, but it can never be yours.\"  \"Then,\" said Percy, gloomily, \"there is only one thing for me to do.\"  \"What is that?\"  \"I shall go to the Bwooklyn Bwidge, climb to the parapet, jump into the water, and end my misewable life.\"  \"You had better think twice before adopting such a desperate resolution, Mr. de Brabazon. You will meet others who will be kinder to you than I have been----\"  \"I can never love another. My heart is broken. Farewell, cruel girl. When you read the papers tomorrow morning, think of the unhappy Percy de Brabazon!\"  Mr. de Brabazon folded his arms gloomily, and stalked out of the room.  \"If my position were not so sad, I should be tempted to smile,\" said Florence. \"Mr. de Brabazon will not do this thing. His emotions are as strong as those of a butterfly.\"  After a brief pause Florence seated herself at the table, and drew toward her writing materials.  \"It is I whose heart should be broken!\" she murmured; \"I who am driven from the only home I have ever known. What can have turned against me my uncle, usually so kind and considerate? It must be that Curtis has exerted a baneful influence upon him. I cannot leave him without one word of farewell.\"  She took up a sheet of paper, and wrote, rapidly:      \"Dear Uncle: You have told me to leave your house, and I     obey. I cannot tell you how sad I feel, when I reflect that I     have lost your love, and must go forth among strangers--I     know not where. I was but a little girl when you gave me a     home. I have grown up in an atmosphere of love, and I have     felt very grateful to you for all you have done for me. I     have tried to conform to your wishes, and I would obey you in     all else--but I cannot marry Curtis; I think I would rather     die. Let me still live with you as I have done. I do not care     for any part of your money--leave it all to him, if you think     best--but give me back my place in your heart. You are angry     now, but you will some time pity and forgive your poor     Florence, who will never cease to bless and pray for you.     Good-bye!                                                   \"Florence.\"  She was about to sign herself Florence Linden, but reflected that she was no longer entitled to use a name which would seem to carry with it a claim upon her uncle.  The tears fell upon the paper as she was writing, but she heeded them not. It was the saddest hour of her life. Hitherto she had been shielded from all sorrow, and secure in the affection of her uncle, had never dreamed that there would come a time when she would feel obliged to leave all behind her, and go out into the world, friendless and penniless, but poorest of all in the loss of that love which she had hitherto enjoyed.  After completing the note, Florence let her head fall upon the table, and sobbed herself to sleep.  An hour and a half passed, the servant looked in, but noticing that her mistress was sleeping, contented herself with lowering the gas, but refrained"]]]
