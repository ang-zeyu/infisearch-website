Grandfather supplied the float! Why, we had just come back from Chautauqua a day or two before Labor Day, you know, and the first thing that happened was that a collector called to get a contribution from Mother to help out the Labor Day procession. I was there and I said I didn't believe in taxation without representation. He laughed and said, 'All right, come on. We'd be glad to have you in the procession'.\"  \"You were rather disconcerted at that, I suspect,\" laughed Mrs. Emerson.  \"Yes, I was, but I hated to take back water, so I said that I belonged to a club and that I supposed he was going to have all the clubs in Rosemont represented in some way. He said that was just what they wanted. They wanted every activity in the town to be shown in some shape or other.\"  \"There wasn't time to call a meeting of the club,\" Helen took up the story, \"so Roger and I came over and talked with Grandfather, and he lent us a hay rack and we dressed it up with boughs and got the carpenters to make some very large cut out letters--U. S. C.--two sets of them, so they could be read on both sides. They were painted white and stood up high among the green stuff and really looked very pretty. Everybody asked what it meant.\"  \"I think it helped a lot when I went about asking for gifts for the Christmas Ship,\" said Roger. \"Lots of people said, 'Oh, it's your club that had a float in the Labor Day parade'.\"  \"If we should work up Grandfather's idea we might have a parade of our own another year,\" said Helen.  \"Always co-operate with what already exists, if it's worthy,\" advised Mr. Emerson. \"Don't get up opposition affairs unless there's a good reason for doing it.\"  \"As there is for our Hallowe'en party,\" insisted Roger.  \"I believe you're right there. There's no reason why you should enter into 'fool stunts' that are just 'fool stunts,' not worth while in any way and not even funny.\"  \"We'd better move on now if Grandfather is to take us over and get back in time for his own dinner,\" said Roger.  \"Come, girls, can you pile in all that shrubbery without breaking it? Put the pumpkins on the bottom of the car, Roger, and the jacks on top of them. Now be careful where you put your feet. Back in half an hour, Mother,\" and he started off with his laughing car load.     CHAPTER II  HALLOWE'EN   \"You're as good as gold to come out and help these youngsters enjoy themselves,\" was Mrs. Morton's greeting to Edward Watkins when he appeared in the evening with Tom and Della.  \"It's they who are as good as gold to let me come,\" he returned, smiling pleasantly. He was a handsome young man of about twenty-five, a doctor whose profession, as yet, did not make serious inroads on his time. \"What are these people going to make us do first,\" he wondered as Roger began a distribution of colored bands.  \"These are to tie your eyes with,\" he explained: \"Yellow, you see; Hallowe'en color. The girls insist on my explaining all their fine points for fear they won't be appreciated,\" he said to the doctor.  \"Quite right. I never should have thought about the color.\"  \"Mother, this is George Foster,\" said Helen, welcoming a tall boy who was not a member of the U. S. C. but who had helped at the Club entertainment by taking part in the minuet. He shook hands with Mrs. Morton and Mrs. Smith and then submitted to having his eyes bandaged. He was followed by Gregory Patton, another high school lad, and to the great joy of everybody, James, after all, came on his crutches with Margaret.  \"Now, then, my blindfolded friends,\" said Roger, \"Grandfather tells me that it is the custom in Scotland where fairies and witches are very abundant, for the ceremony that we are about to perform to open every Hallowe'en party. He has it direct from Bobby Burns.\"  \"Then it's right,\" came a smothered voice from beneath James' bandage.  \"James is of Scottish descent and he confirms this statement, so we can go ahead and be perfectly sure that we're doing the correct thing. Of course, we all want to know the future and particularly whatever we can about the person we're going to marry, so that's what we're going to try to find out at the very start off.\"  \"Take off my bandage,\" cried Dicky. \"I know the perthon I'm going to marry.\"  A shout of laughter greeted this assertion from the six-year-old.  \"Who is it, Dicky?\" asked Helen, her arm around his shoulders.  \"I'm going to marry Mary,\" he asserted stoutly.  There was a renewed peal at this, and Roger went on with his instructions.  \"I'll lead you two by two to the kitchen door and then you'll go down the flight of steps and straight ahead for anywhere from ten to twenty steps. That will land you right in the middle of what the frost has left of the Morton garden. When you get there you'll 'pull kale'.\"  \"Meaning?\" inquired George Foster.  \"Meaning that you'll feel about until you find a stalk of cabbage and pull it up.\"  \"I don't like cabbage,\" complained Tom Watkins.  \"You'll like this because it will give you a lot of information. If it's long or short or fat or thin your future husband or wife will correspond to it.\"  \"That's the most unromantic thing I ever heard,\" exclaimed Margaret Hancock. \"I certainly hope my future husband won't be as fat as a cabbage!\"  \"You can tell how great a fortune he's going to have--or she--by the amount of earth that clings to the stem.\"  \"Watch me pull mine so g-e-n-t-l-y that not a grain of sand slips off,\" said Tom.  \"If you've got courage enough to bite the stem you can find out with perfect accuracy whether your beloved will have a sweet disposition or the opposite.\"  \"In any case he'd have a disposition like a cabbage,\" insisted Margaret, who did not like cabbage any more than Tom did.  \"Ready?\" Roger marshalled his little army. \"Two by two. Doctor and Ethel Blue, Tom and Dorothy, James and Helen, George and Ethel Brown, Gregory and Margaret. Come on, Della,\" and he led the way through the kitchen where Mary and the cook were hugely entertained by the procession.  With cries and stumbling they went forth into the cabbage patch, where they all possessed themselves of stalks which they straightway brought in to the light of the jack-o'-lanterns to interpret.  \"My lady love will be tall and slender--not to say thin,\" began Dr. Watkins. \"I see no information here as to the color of her hair and eyes. Fate cruelly witholds these important facts. I regret to say that I wooed her so vigorously that I shook off any gold-pieces she may have had clinging about her so I can only be sure of the golden quality of her character which I have just discovered by biting it.\"  Amid general laughter they all began to read their fortunes. Tom announced that his beloved was so thin that she was really a candidate for the attentions of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and that he couldn't find out anything about her character because there wasn't enough of her to bite.  Margaret had pulled a stalk that fulfilled all her expectations as to size, for it was so short and fat that she could see no relation between it and anything human and threw it out of the window in disgust. The rest found themselves fitted out with a variety of possibilities.  \"There doesn't seem to be a real tearing beauty among them all,\" sighed Roger. \"That's what I'd set my heart on.\"  \"What do you expect from a cabbage?\" demanded Margaret scornfully.  \"I want to know whether I'm going to marry a bachelor or a widower or not marry at all,\" cried Helen. \"Let's try the 'three luggies' next.\"  \"First cabbages, then 'luggies',\" said Della \"What are 'luggies'?\"  \"'Luggies' are saucers,\" explained Helen, while James brought a small table and Ethel Brown arranged three saucers upon it. \"In one of them I put clear water, in another one, sandy water, and nothing at all in the third. Anybody ready to try? Come, Della.\"  Della came forward briskly, but hesitated when she found that she must be blindfolded.  \"There isn't any trick about it?\" she asked suspiciously. \"I shouldn't like to have anything happen to that saucer of sandy water.\"  \"It won't touch anything but your finger tips, and perhaps not those,\" Helen reassured her. \"What you are to do is to dip the fingers of your left hand into one of these saucers. If it proves to be the one with the clear water you'll marry a bachelor; if it's the sandy one he'll be a widower, and if it's the empty one you'll be a spinster to your dying day.\"  \"You have three tries,\" cried Ethel Blue, \"and the saucers are changed after each trial, so you have to touch the same one twice to be sure you really know your fate. Are you ready?\"  \"I'm ready,\" and Della bravely though cautiously dipped the finger tips of her left hand into the bowl of sandy water.  A cheer greeted this result.  \"A widower, a widower,\" they all cried.  Helen changed the position of the saucers and Della made another trial. This time the Fates booked her as a spinster.  \"That's the least trouble of anything,\" decided roly poly Della who took life carelessly.  A third attempt proved that a widower was to be her future helpmate, for her fingers went into the sandy saucer for a second time.  \"I only hope he won't be an oldy old widower,\" said Della thoughtfully. \"I couldn't bear to think of marrying any one as old as Edward.\"  \"I'll thank you to take notice that I haven't got a foot in the grave just yet, young woman,\" retorted her brother.  While some of the others tried their fate by the saucer method, the rest endeavored to learn their future occupations by means of pouring melted lead through the handle of a key. Roger brought in a tiny kettle of lead from the kitchen where Mary had heated it for them and set it down on a small table on a tea pot stand, so that the heat should not injure the wood. Taking a large key in"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19834"],["title","Ethel Morton's Holidays (#2)"],["body","left hand he dipped a spoon into the lead with his right and poured the contents slowly through the ring at the end of the handle of the key into a bowl of cold water. The sudden chill stiffened the lead into curious shapes and from them those who were clever at translating were to discover what the future held for them in the way of occupation.  \"Mine looks more like a spinning wheel than anything else,\" said Roger who had done it first so that the rest might see how it was accomplished.  \"Perhaps that means that you'll be a manufacturer of cloth,\" suggested Margaret. \"Mine looks more like a cabbage than anything else. You don't think it can mean that I shall have to devote myself to that husband I pulled out of the cabbage patch?\"  \"It may. Or it might mean that you'll be a gardener. Lots of women are going in for gardening now. By the time you're ready to start that may be a favored occupation for girls,\" said Dr. Watkins.  \"Here are several things that we can do one at a time while the rest of us are doing something else,\" said Helen. \"They have to be done alone or the spell won't work.\"  \"Let's hear them,\" begged Gregory, while he and the others grouped themselves about the open fire in the living room and prepared to burn nuts.  \"The first one, according to Burns, is to go alone to the kiln and put a clew of yarn in the kiln pot.\"  \"What does that mean translated into Rosemont language?\" demanded James.  \"James the Scotsman asks for information! However, there's some excuse for him. Translated into Rosemont language it means that you go to the laundry and put a ball of yarn into the wash boiler.\"  \"Easy so far.\"  \"Take an end of the ball and begin to wind the yarn into a new ball. When you come near the end you'll find that something or some one will be holding it--\"  \"Roger, I'll bet!\"  \"You demand to know the name of your future wife and a hollow voice from out the wash boiler will tell you her name.\"  \"I shan't try that one. There's too good a chance for Roger to put in some of his tricks. What's the next?\"  \"Take a candle and go to the Witches' Cave--that's the dining room--and stand in front of the looking glass that's on a little table in the corner, and eat an apple. The face of your future wife or husband will appear over your shoulder.\"  \"I'll try that. I could stand a face that kept still, but to have an unknown creature pulling my yarn and bawling my wife's name would upset my nerves!\"  \"Here's the last one. Go into the garden just as we did to pull the kale. Over at the right hand side there's a stack of barley. It's really corn, but we've re-christened it for tonight. You measure it three times round with your arms and at the end of the third round your beloved will rush into them.\"  \"If he proves to be my cabbage spouse you'll hear loud shrieks from little Margaret!\" declared that young woman.  \"Here are my nuts to burn,\" said Ethel Blue, putting two chestnuts side by side on the hearth. \"One is Della and the other is Ethel Blue,\" and she tapped them in turn as she gave them their names.  \"What's this for?\" asked Della, hearing her name used.  \"This is to see if you and I will always be friends. That right hand nut is you and the left hand is me--no, I.\" Conscientious Ethel Blue interrupted herself to correct her grammar. \"If we burn cosily side by side we'll stay friends a long time, but if one of us jumps or burns up before the other, she'll be the one to break the friendship.\"  \"I hope I shan't be the one,\" and both girls sat down on the rug to watch their namesakes closely.  \"Here are Margaret and her cabbage man,\" laughed Tom. \"This delicate, slender chestnut is Margaret and this big round one is Mr. Stalk of the Cabbage Patch. Now we'll see how that match is going to turn out.\"  Margaret laughed good naturedly with the rest and they watched this pair as well as the others.  \"Roger and I had a squabble yesterday,\" admitted Ethel Brown. \"Here is Roger and here is Ethel Brown. Let's see how we are going to get on in the future.\"  \"Where is Roger really?\" some one asked, but at that instant Ethel Blue's nut and Della's caught fire and burned steadily side by side without any demonstrations, and every one looking on was so absorbed in translating the meaning of the blaze that no one pursued the question.  That is, not until a shriek from the Witches' Cave rang through the house and sent them all flying to see who was in trouble. Dorothy was found coming out of the dining room, mirror in hand, and a strange tale on her lips.  \"If there's any truth in this Hallowe'en prophecy,\" she said with trembling voice, \"my future husband will be worse than Margaret's cabbage man. The face that looked over my shoulder was exactly like a jack-o'-lantern's.\"  \"It was? Where's Roger?\" Dr. Watkins demanded instantly, while James hobbled to the front door and announced that the jack had disappeared from the front porch.  \"Did any one ask for Roger?\" demanded a cool voice, and Roger was seen coming down stairs.  \"Yes, sir, numerous people asked for Roger. How did you do it?\"  \"Do what? Has anything happened in my absence?\"  \"Not a thing has happened in your _absence_. Just tell us how you managed it.\"  \"I know,\" guessed Helen. \"He went outside and took the jack from the porch and carried it through the kitchen, into the dining room where it smiled over Dorothy's shoulder, and then he went into the kitchen again and up the back stairs. Wasn't that it, Roger?\"  \"Young woman, you are wiser than your years,\" was all that Roger would say.  While they were teasing him a shouting in the garden sent them all to the back windows and doors. In the dim light of the young moon two figures were seen wrestling. It was evidently a good natured struggle, for peals of laughter fell on the ears of the listeners. When one of them dragged the other toward the house the figures proved to be Tom Watkins and George Foster.  \"I was measuring the barley stack,\" explained Tom breathlessly, \"and just as I made the third round and was eagerly expecting my future bride to rush into my arms, something did rush into my arms, but I'll leave it to the opinion of the meeting whether _this_ can be my future bride!\" and he held at arm's length by the coat collar the laughing, squirming figure of George Foster.  It was unanimously agreed that George did not have the appearance of a bride, and then they went back to the hall to bob for apples. Roger spread a rubber blanket on the floor and drew the tub from its hiding place in the corner where it had been waiting its turn in the games.  While the boys were making these arrangements Dorothy and Helen were busily trying to dispose of the two ends of the same string which stretched from one mouth to the other with a tempting raisin tied in the middle to encourage them to effort. It was forbidden to use the hands and tongues proved not always reliable. Now Dorothy seemed ahead, now Helen. Finally the victory seemed about to be Helen's, when she laughed and lost several inches of string and Dorothy triumphantly devoured the prize.  When the girls turned to see what the boys were doing, Gregory and James were already bobbing for apples. One knelt at one side of the tub and the other at the other, and each had his eye, when it was not full of water, fixed on one of the apples that were bouncing busily about on the waves caused by their own motions.  \"I speak for the red one,\" gasped Gregory.  \"All right! I'll go for the greening,\" agreed James, and they puffed and sputtered, and were quite unable to fix their teeth in the sides of the slippery fruit until James drove his head right down to the bottom of the tub where he fastened upon the apple and came up dripping, but triumphant.  Stimulated by the applause that greeted James, Tom and Roger tossed in two apples and began a new contest.  \"This isn't a girls' game is it?\" murmured Helen as Tom won his apple by the same means that James had used.  \"Not unless you're willing to forget your hair,\" replied Dr. Watkins.  \"You can't forget it when it takes so long to dry it,\" Helen answered. \"I'm content to let the boys have this entirely to themselves.\"  While the half drowned boys went up to Roger's room to dry their faces the girls prepared nut boats to set sail upon the same ocean that had floated the apples. They had cracked English walnuts carefully so that the two halves fell apart neatly, and in place of the meats they had packed a candle end tightly into each.  \"We have the comfort of the apple even when we're defeated,\" said Gregory, coming down stairs, eating the fruit that he had not been able to capture without the use of his hands. \"What have you got there?\"  \"Here's a boat apiece,\" explained Helen. \"We must each put a tiny flag of some sort on it so that we can tell which is which.\"  \"This way?\" George asked. \"I've put a pin through a scrap of corn husk and stuck it on to the end of this craft.\"  \"That's right. We must find something different for each one. Mine is a black-alder berry. See how red and bright it is?\"  It was not hard for each to find an emblem.  \"Watch me hoist the admiral's flag at the mainmast,\" said Roger, but the match that he set up for a mast caught fire almost as soon as the candles were lighted in the miniature fleet. His flag fell overboard, however, and was not injured.  \"See that?\" he commented. \"That just proves that the flag of the U. S. A. can never perish,\" and the others greeted his words with cheers.  It was a pretty sight--the whole fleet afloat, each bit of candle burning clearly and each little craft tossing on the waves that Dr. Watkins produced by gently tipping the tub.  \"This is also an attempt to gain some knowledge of the future,\" said Helen. \"We must watch these boats and see which ones stay close together and which go far apart, and whether any of them are shipwrecked, and which ones seem to have the smoothest voyage.\"  \"Della's and mine are sticking together just the way our nuts did,\" cried Ethel "]]]
