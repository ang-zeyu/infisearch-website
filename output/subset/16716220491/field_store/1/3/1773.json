What are these mysterious Protocols? How did they come to “the Russian mystic” who revealed them in 1905, and which have now been exhumed from obscurity for the purpose of enlightening the world, and which point to the Jews as the cause of all unrest, chaos and confusion?  Nilus, “the Russian mystic,” is credited with several versions of how he had secured the Protocols, and his stories flatly contradict one another. In 1905 he said that the Protocols were given to him by a prominent Russian conservative whose name he did not mention, and who in turn had received them from an unnamed woman who had stolen them from “one of the most influential leaders of Freemasonry at the close of a secret meeting of the initiated in France.” Then, several years later, Nilus wrote that his friend himself had stolen the Protocols from “the headquarters of the Society of Zion in France.” Several years afterwards, in a new edition of his book, Nilus said that the “Protocols” came from Switzerland and not from France. This time he named his Russian conservative friend, Sukhotin, who had died in the meantime. He added that the Protocols were not Jewish-Masonic but Zionist documents secretly read at the Zionist Congress in Basle in 1897.  Then followed a new edition of the Nilus book bearing the date of 1917. A translation of this edition has recently appeared in this country, containing a brand-new explanation as to how the Protocols were rescued and given to the world. This explanation is taken from the German version published in Charlottenburg. The introduction to that edition says that the Protocols, having been read from day to day at the Basle Congress, were sent as read to Frankfort on the Main. The disclosure of them came through the infidelity of the messenger.  The 1917 edition is published with a prologue and an epilogue, like a drama, which indeed it is, with all the ingredients of melodrama—a villain, a mysterious woman, a Grand Duke, a conspiracy to destroy the world, and a saint—Nilus, who convicts himself in his own writings of falsification in the giving of these various accounts of how the Protocols came into his possession.  Nothing is known of Sergius Nilus. Russian standard reference books and encyclopedias contain no mention of his name.  The anonymous American editor of the Nilus book gives the following information about Nilus:  “Serge Nilus, in the 1905 edition of whose book was first published the _Zionist Protocols_, was, as he states, born in the year 1862, of Russian parents holding liberal opinions. His family was fairly well known in Moscow, for its members were educated people who were firm in their allegiance to the Tsar and the Greek Church. On one side he is said to have been connected by marriage with the nobility of the Baltic provinces. Nilus himself was graduated from the University of Moscow and early entered the civil service, obtaining a small appointment in the law courts. Later, he received a post under the Procurator of a provincial court in the Caucasus. Finally, tiring of the law, he went to the Government of Orel, where he was a landowner and a noble. His spiritual life had been tumultuous and full of trouble, and finally he entered the Troitsky-Sergevsky Monastery near Moscow. ‘In answer to his appeal for pardon, Saint Sergei, stern and angry, appeared to him twice in a vision. He left the Monastery a converted man.’  “From 1905 until the present, little is known of his activities. Articles are said to have appeared from time to time in the Russian press from his pen. A returning traveller from Siberia in August, 1919, was positive in his statement that Nilus was in Irkutsk in June of that year. Whether his final fate was that of Admiral Kolchak is not known.”  The American editor of Sergius Nilus’s book containing the “Protocols” is hiding behind anonymity. The name of the traveller from Siberia who was so positive in his statement that Nilus was in Irkutsk is also concealed. And Serge Nilus to whom Saint Sergei “appeared twice in a vision” “is said to have written articles in the Russian press” of which nobody has knowledge.  In Germany, Nilus is described as follows:  “Sergius Nilus was an employee of the Russian secret police department, of the _okhrana_, connected with the Church, especially relating to ‘foreign religions.’ He lived for some time at the Optina Pustina monastery. In 1901 he published a book entitled ‘The Great in the Small and the Anti-Christ.’ According to the Lutsch Sveta, Nilus claims to have received in 1901 a copy of the text of the Protocols from the secret archives of the Main Zionist organization in France, but he published the ‘protocols’ only in 1905. A second edition appeared in 1911, and finally another edition was brought out in the beginning of 1917, but all copies are said to have been destroyed.”  “The Cause of the World Unrest,” an anonymous book published in England and reprinted in this country, speaks of Nilus and the “Protocols” as follows:  “In the year 1903 a Russian, Serge Nilus, published a book entitled _The Great in Little_. The second edition, which was published at Tsarskoye Selo in 1905, had an additional chapter, the twelfth, under the heading ‘Anti-Christ as a Near Political Possibility.’ This chapter consisted of some twenty pages of introduction followed by the text of twenty-four ‘Protocols of Meetings of the Learned Elders of Zion,’ and the book ends with some twenty pages of commentaries on these protocols by Nilus.  “Directly after the protocols, comes a statement by Nilus that they are ‘signed by representatives of Zion of the thirty-third degree.’ These protocols were secretly extracted or were stolen from a whole volume of protocols. All this was got by my correspondent out of the secret depositories of the Head Chancellery of Zion. This Chancellery is at present on French territory.”  In the edition of 1917 Sergius Nilus wrote:       “My book has already reached the fourth edition, but it is only      definitely known to me now and in a manner worthy of belief, and      that through Jewish sources, that these protocols are nothing other      than the strategic plans for the conquest of the world under the      heel of Israel, and worked out by the leaders of the Jewish      people—and read by the ‘Prince of Exile,’ Theodor Herzl, during the      first Zionist Congress, summoned by him in August, 1897, in Basle.”  It will be shown later that the so-called Butmi edition of the “protocols” published in 1907 contains the definite statement of the man who claims to have translated them into Russian from the French in 1901 that the Elders of Zion mentioned in the Protocols are not to be confounded with the Zionist movement.  In the 1917 edition Sergius Nilus wrote:       “In 1901 I came into possession of a manuscript, and this      comparatively small book was destined to cause a deep change in my      entire viewpoint as can only be caused in the heart of man by      Divine Power. It was comparable with the miracle of making the      blind see. ‘May Divine acts show on him.’       “This manuscript was called ‘the protocols of the Zionist Men of      Wisdom,’ and it was given to me by the now deceased leader of the      Tchernigov nobility, who later became vice-governor of Stavropol,      Alexis Nikolayevitch Sukhotin. I had already begun to work with my      pen for the glory of the Lord, and I was friendly with Sukhotin.      _He was a man of my opinion_, that is, extremely conservative, as      they are now termed.       “Sukhotin told me that he in turn had obtained the manuscript from      a lady who always lived abroad. This lady was a noblewoman from      Tchernigov. He mentioned her by name, but I have forgotten it. He      said that she obtained it in some mysterious way, by theft, I      believe.       “Sukhotin also said that one copy of the manuscript was given by      this lady to Sipiagin, the Minister of the Interior, upon her      return from abroad, and that Sipiagin was subsequently killed. He      said other things of the same mysterious character. But when I      first became acquainted with the contents of the manuscript I was      convinced that its terrible, cruel and straight-forward truth is      witness of its true origin from the ‘Zionist Men of Wisdom,’ and      that no other evidence of its origin would be needed.”  Feodor Roditchev, one of Russia’s most famous liberals, a member of the nobility, a former member of the Duma, writing recently of the Nilus protocols and of Sukhotin whom Nilus described as a man of his own opinion, says:       “For months I hear on all sides about the Nilus book and its      success in England, and I am asked, Who is Nilus? There was a      Nilus, an associate justice of the Moscow District Court. It is      said that the manuscript was given to Nilus by Sukhotin, the      notorious zemstvo official of Chernsk.       “The Berlin edition contains no mention of Sukhotin, but in that      edition Nilus said, ‘Pray for the soul of the boyar Alexis.’       “The name of the notorious Alexey Nikolayevitch Sukhotin means      nothing to the present generation. But there was a time when his      name attracted attention.       “Sukhotin arrested the peasants of a whole village for refusing to      cart manure from his stables because the animals there were      infected with glanders. Judge Tsurikov released the peasants.      Tsurikov was removed for this, while Sukhotin justified his act by      writing to the Minister of the Interior, Durnovo, that he had      arrested the peasants not because they refused to cart his manure      but because they dared disobey him as a zemstvo official. The      reactionary Chernsk nobility made Sukhotin marshal of nobility. So      it was this man who furnished the protocols of the secret meetings      of the representatives of Zion! But how did Sukhotin get the      protocols? An unknown friend "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19200"],["title","The History of a Lie: \"The Protocols of the Wise Men of Zion\" (#2)"],["body","brought them to him. They were      given to him by an unknown lady who had received them from an      unknown but energetic participant in the Basle Congress. Is this      credible? Well, then, there is another version of the origin of the      protocols—but that is for the German readers. The Russian      government sent a spy to the Basle Congress. He did not go to the      Congress himself, but bribed one of the participants. He was      carrying the protocols from Basle to Frankfurt to the local masonic      organization. He stopped on the way in a little town, and gave the      protocols to the spy. He engaged copyists who worked all night and      copied the protocols.       “In the first Russian version the protocols were supposed to have      been brought to Russia in French. According to the German version,      the protocols were copied, consequently they were in German, but      the most important thing is that the protocols are not protocols at      all, but a monograph—which could be called ‘the dream of a member      of the Black Hundreds.’”  A distinguished Russian publicist says of the sponsor of the “protocols” as follows:       “In Russia the problems of Christianity and Judaism have been      studied by such men as Vladimir Solovyov, Professor Troitzky,      Professor Kokovtsev, Kartashov, Bulgakov, Berdyayev—men of profound      intellect and a living conscience. In them the counterfeit ravings      of the ignorant monk (Nilus) evoked but a smile of contempt. The      low level of the circles in which men like Nilus moved and worked      is only too well known. It was the world of police denunciations,      divorce perjuries, monastic servility and feigned, blasphemous      piety. In order to attract attention, Nilus’s ‘Protocols of the      Wise Men of Zion’ had to emigrate from Russia. And the further away      they went, the better they fared.”     CHAPTER TWO  THE STORY FROM WHICH THE PROTOCOLS WERE FABRICATED  Essence of “Protocols” Was German Fiction of “Sir John Retcliffe”—Who Was “Retcliffe”?—His Infamous Record—His Bloodcurdling Story—The Meeting in the Cemetery—An Avowed Myth—Meeting Every Hundred Years Attended by “Representatives of the Twelve Tribes of Israel”—The “Son of the Accursed” Also Attends and Provides Comic Interludes.   The query now naturally arises, what is the origin of these much heralded “Protocols” which were published in Russia by Sergius Nilus in 1905, and a copy of which, it is triumphantly announced, is now in the British Museum?  The anti-Jewish propagandists everywhere content themselves with the “history” of the origin of the “Protocols” as given by the “Russian mystic” Sergius Nilus. But fortunately “murder will out,” and the criminals who perpetrated the stupendous forgery for the purpose of slandering the Jews have left behind clues that enable one to visualize the very process that they pursued in the perpetration of their crime.  In 1866-1870 there appeared in Berlin a series of novels entitled “Biarritz—Rome” purporting to have been written by “Sir John Retcliffe,” the pseudonym of Herman Goedsche, a German novelist with an unsavory past. To conceal his identity and to convey the impression that the antisemitism with which his writings abounded emanated from English sources, he selected “Sir John Retcliffe” as his pen-name.  According to _Meyer’s Konversations Lexikon_ (Sixth edition, 1904, Volume VIII, page 77), Herman Goedsche was born in February, 1815, in Trachenberg, Silesia, and died on November 8, 1878, at Warmbrunn. He was employed in the postal service, but as he was implicated in the Waldeck forgery case, he left the service in 1849, and devoted himself to literary work. Under the name of “Armin” he published a number of works of fiction, but he was best known under the name of “Sir John Retcliffe,” having published a series of sensational novels describing the Crimean war, “Sebastopol,” “Rena-Sahib,” “Villafranca,” “Puebla,” “Biarritz,” in 1866. A new edition of these works appeared in Berlin in 1903-4.  _Brockhaus’ Konversations Lexikon_ (supplement volume XVII, 1904) refers to Goedsche, the novelist, known under the name of “Sir John Retcliffe” (formerly “Armin”), as having played an infamous role in the Waldeck forgery case. He was compelled to leave the postal service, and later became a member of the staff of the _Preussische Kreutz Zeitung_.  The chapter of the Goedsche-Retcliffe novel which on even a cursory reading will be found to contain the very essence of the Nilus Protocols was published as a separate booklet in a Russian translation in 1872, avowedly as a work of fiction. I have found a copy of this little volume in the Russian Department of the Library of Congress, Washington, D. C.  An examination of this chapter, entitled “The Jewish Cemetery in Prague and the Council of Representatives of the Twelve Tribes of Israel,” will disclose the fact that every substantive statement contained in the Protocols and elaborated in them is to be found in the Goedsche-Retcliffe novelette.  We are thus supplied with an early draft of the so-called Protocols, which have now been given worldwide publicity by anti-Jewish propagandists, and which were first introduced to the world in the form of a clumsy piece of blood-curdling fiction of the dime-novel variety.  In substantiation of this statement I now present a translation of this chapter of the Russian version of this novel found in the Library of Congress in Washington, published in St. Petersburg nearly fifty years ago.
