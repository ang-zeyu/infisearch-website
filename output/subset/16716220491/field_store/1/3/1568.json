Before the sound-waves had reached them, he had been legging it into the house. The television had been on, and it had been acting as insanely as the screen on his right now. He had called the State Police--the telephones had been working all right--and told them who he was, and they had told him to stay put and they'd send a car for him. They did, within minutes. Janet and his host and hostess had waited with him on the lawn until it came, and after he had gotten into it, he had turned around and looked back through the rear window, and seen Janet standing under the front light, holding the little dog in her arms, flopping one of its silly little paws up and down with her hand to wave goodbye to him.  He had seen her and the dog like that every day of his life for the last fifteen years.  \"What kind of radiation are you getting?\" he could hear Alexis Pitov asking into a phone. \"What? Nothing else? Oh; yes, of course. But mostly cosmic. That shouldn't last long.\" He turned from the phone. \"A devil's own dose of cosmic, and some gamma. It was the cosmic radiation that put the radios and telescreens out. That's why I insisted that the drone planes be independent of radio control.\"  They always got cosmic radiation from the micro-annihilations in the test-vault. Well, now they had an idea of what produced natural cosmic rays. There must be quite a bit of negamatter and posimatter going into mutual annihilation and total energy release through the Universe.  \"Of course, there were no detectors set up in advance around Auburn,\" he said. \"We didn't really begin to find anything out for half an hour. By that time, the cosmic radiation was over and we weren't getting anything but gamma.\"  \"What--What has Auburn to do--?\" The Russian stopped short. \"You think this was the same thing?\" He gave it a moment's consideration. \"Lee, you're crazy! There wasn't an atom of artificial negamatter in the world in 1969. Nobody had made any before us. We gave each other some scientific surprises, then, but nobody surprised both of us. You and I, between us, knew everything that was going on in nuclear physics in the world. And you know as well as I do--\"  A voice came out of the public-address speaker. \"Some of the radio equipment around the target area, that wasn't knocked out by blast, is beginning to function again. There is an increasingly heavy gamma radiation, but no more cosmic rays. They were all prompt radiation from the annihilation; the gamma is secondary effect. Wait a moment; Captain Urquiola, of the Air Force, says that the first drone plane is about to take off.\"  It had been two hours after the blast that the first drones had gone over what had been Auburn, New York. He was trying to remember, as exactly as possible, what had been learned from them. Gamma radiation; a great deal of gamma. But it didn't last long. It had been almost down to a safe level by the time the investigation had been called off, and, two months after there had been no more missiles, and no way of producing more, and no targets to send them against if they'd had them, rather--he had been back at Auburn on his hopeless quest, and there had been almost no trace of radiation. Nothing but a wide, shallow crater, almost two hundred feet in diameter and only fifteen at its deepest, already full of water, and a circle of flattened and scattered rubble for a mile and a half all around it. He was willing to bet anything that that was what they'd find where the chunk of nega-iron had landed, fifty miles away on the pampas.  Well, the first drone ought to be over the target area before long, and at least one of the balloons that had been sent up was reporting its course by radio. The radios in the others were silent, and the recording counters had probably jammed in all of them. There'd be something of interest when the first drone came back. He dragged his mind back to the present, and went to work with Alexis Pitov.  They were at it all night, checking, evaluating, making sure that the masses of data that were coming in were being promptly processed for programming the computers. At each of the increasingly frequent coffee-breaks, he noticed Pitov looking curiously. He said nothing, however, until, long after dawn, they stood outside the bunker, waiting for the jeep that would take them back to their bungalow and watching the line of trucks--Argentine army engineers, locally hired laborers, load after load of prefab-huts and equipment--going down toward the target-area, where they would be working for the next week.  \"Lee, were you serious?\" Pitov asked. \"I mean, about this being like the one at Auburn?\"  \"It was exactly like Auburn; even that blazing light that came rushing down out of the sky. I wondered about that at the time--what kind of a missile would produce an effect like that. Now I know. We just launched one like it.\"  \"But that's impossible! I told you, between us we know everything that was happening in nuclear physics then. Nobody in the world knew how to assemble atoms of negamatter and build them into masses.\"  \"Nobody, and nothing, on this planet built that mass of negamatter. I doubt if it even came from this Galaxy. But we didn't know that, then. When that negamatter meteor fell, the only thing anybody could think of was that it had been a Soviet missile. If it had hit around Leningrad or Moscow or Kharkov, who would you have blamed it on?\"   THE END.            *       *       *       *       *  TYPOGRAPHICAL ERRORS CORRECTED  The following typographical errors in the text were corrected as detailed here.

Did I say, all? No; One was lame,     And could not dance the whole of the way;     And in after years, if you would blame     His sadness, he was used to say,--     \"It's dull in our town since my playmates left!     I can't forget that I'm bereft     Of all the pleasant sights they see,     Which the Piper also promised me.     For he led us, he said, to a joyous land,     Joining the town and just at hand,     Where waters gushed and fruit-trees grew,     And flowers put forth a fairer hue,     And everything was strange and new;     The sparrows were brighter than peacocks here,     And their dogs outran our fallow deer,     And honey-bees had lost their stings,     And horses were born with eagles' wings;     And just as I became assured     My lame foot would be speedily cured,     The music stopped and I stood still,     And found myself outside the hill,     Left alone against my will,     To go now limping as before,     And never hear of that country more!\"   XIV.      Alas, alas for Hamelin!       There came into many a burgher's pate       A text which says that Heaven's gate       Opes to the rich at as easy rate     As the needle's eye takes a camel in!     The Mayor sent East, West, North, and South,     To offer the Piper, by word of mouth,       Wherever it was men's lot to find him,     Silver and gold to his heart's content,     If he'd only return the way he went,       And bring the children behind him.     But when they saw 'twas a lost endeavour,     And Piper and dancers were gone for ever,     They made a decree that lawyers never       Should think their records dated duly     If, after the day of the month and year,     These words did not as well appear,     \"And so long after what happened here       On the Twenty-second of July,     Thirteen hundred and seventy-six:\"     And the better in memory to fix     The place of the children's last retreat,     They called it, the Pied Piper's Street--     Where any one playing on pipe or tabor,     Was sure for the future to lose his labour.     Nor suffered they hostelry or tavern       To shock with mirth a street so solemn;     But opposite the place of the cavern       They wrote the story on a column,     And on the great church-window painted     The same, to make the world acquainted     How their children were stolen away,     And there it stands to this very day.     And I must not omit to say     That in Transylvania there's a tribe     Of alien people that ascribe     The outlandish ways and dress     On which their neighbours lay such stress,     To their fathers and mothers having risen     Out of some subterraneous prison     Into which they were trepanned     Long time ago in a mighty band     Out of Hamelin town in Brunswick land,     But how or why, they don't understand.

And, whether they pipe us free from rats or from mice,     If we've promised them aught, let us keep our promise!
