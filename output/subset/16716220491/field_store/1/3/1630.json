And for my part, I don't see why you're allowed to stay in our house. If I had my way you'd be driven out into the world to shift for yourself.... And I know others who say the same.\"  Upon hearing that disagreeable speech Buster Bumblebee jumped back quickly. He was not angry--but merely disappointed, for he had expected something quite different.  \"You--er--you trumpet beautifully,\" he stammered, remembering that that was another remark which Chirpy Cricket had suggested as being likely to put the trumpeter into a pleasant frame of mind.  At that the rude creature laughed most scornfully.  \"I'd like to know how you can say _that_,\" she sneered. \"You're so lazy and such a sleepy-head that you never hear me when I wake the household. In fact, I don't believe you would ever wake up enough to crawl out of bed if you didn't get hungry--and goodness knows you do love to eat.\"  \"No such thing!\" cried Buster Bumblebee.  And happening just at that moment to spy an unusually tempting clover-top close beside him, he lighted upon it and began to suck up its sweet juices.  The trumpeter at once screamed joyfully and pointed a finger straight at him.  \"There you go!\" she cried. \"You have to stop and eat even while you're talking with a lady! Why, you eat and sleep so much that you don't know what you're doing or saying half the time.\"  One might naturally think that such a remark would have angered Buster. But he was not one to lose his temper easily. And he merely looked at the trumpeter sadly and said:  \"Don't speak to me like that! I'm a queen's son. I'm a gentleman.\"     IV  BUSTER FINDS A SISTER   Buster Bumblebee's announcement that he was a queen's son--and a gentleman--seemed to amuse the trumpeter hugely. She held her sides and laughed uproariously.  \"That's nothing!\" she said at last. \"I'm one myself!\"  \"One what?\" Buster asked her quickly. \"You're certainly no gentleman--for you just referred to yourself as a lady not two minutes ago. And neither can you be anybody's son, I should think.\"  \"I mean I'm a queen's daughter--though maybe you didn't know it,\" the trumpeter replied.  And Buster Bumblebee answered in a dazed fashion that he had had no idea she was of royal blood, like himself.  \"It's true,\" the trumpeter assured him. \"You'd never guess it; but I'm your own sister.\"  Well, Buster Bumblebee was so surprised that he almost fell off the clover-head on which he was sitting. It was really a sad blow to be told that that disagreeable, vixenish trumpeter, who awakened the workers each morning, was so closely related to him. But it was no more than he might have expected, living as he did in a family of more than two hundred souls.  \"It's--it's hard to believe,\" he gasped, shaking his head slowly.  \"It certainly is,\" said the trumpeter. \"I don't understand how my own brother can be so lazy as you are.\"  \"It's not that I'm lazy--it's the way my mother brought me up,\" Buster protested.  \"_Our_ mother, you mean,\" the trumpeter corrected him. \"Maybe you're right.... After all, you'd only be in everybody's way if you tried to work--you're so awkward and clumsy. So maybe it's just as well for you to play the gentleman--though you must find it a dull life.\"  \"It suits me,\" said Buster. \"But I do wish you could manage to rouse the workers in the morning without disturbing me.\" He was bolder, now that he knew he was talking to his own sister.  The trumpeter pondered for a little time before replying.  \"It's my duty to trumpet loudly,\" she said at last. \"The summer is none too long. And there's a great deal of honey to be made before fall.... Have you thought of stuffing your ears with cotton?\" she inquired.  \"Why, no!\" said Buster Bumblebee. \"That's a fine plan, I'm sure. And I'll follow it this very night.\"  So he thanked his new-found sister and said good-by, for he wanted to look for some cotton at once.  \"Goodness me!\" the trumpeter exclaimed as soon as Buster had left her. \"Here I've wasted a precious quarter of an hour when I should have been working.\" Thereupon she began gathering nectar as fast as she could, and forgot all about Buster Bumblebee and his trouble.  When he left the trumpeter in the clover field, Buster was feeling quite cheerful. Although Chirpy Cricket's advice had been of little use to him, Buster's talk with the trumpeter had ended pleasantly enough. And now he expected that he would be able to sleep as late as he pleased--with the help of a bit of cotton.  Buster flew fast, as he left the fragrant clover behind him, to hunt for the cotton that he needed. But he soon paused in his rapid flight and sat down on a sprig of honeysuckle, to think.  He was puzzled. He hadn't the slightest idea where he could find any cotton. So what was the use of hurrying, if he didn't know where he was going?     V  MR. CROW TO THE RESCUE   As Buster sat on the sprig of wild honeysuckle, wondering where to look for a bit of cotton with which to stuff his ears, a bird fluttered down and perched upon the old stone wall to which the honeysuckle clung. The name of the newcomer was Jasper Jay. And Buster Bumblebee was glad to see him, because he wanted help from somebody and he didn't care who it was.  \"Where could a person get a small piece of cotton?\" he asked Jasper Jay.  And Jasper--who would gladly have made a lunch of Buster, had he not been afraid of getting stung--Jasper promptly replied with another question:  \"What do you intend to do with cotton?\" He was a very curious fellow, this Jasper Jay.  Buster Bumblebee had no objection to explaining everything to him. And then--and only then--was Jasper willing to tell what he knew.  \"Cotton--\" said he--\"cotton grows in fields. I know that much. And what's more, I know it doesn't grow in Pleasant Valley, for I live here the whole year round and I've never seen any.\"  That was bad news for Buster.  \"What do you advise me to do?\" he inquired anxiously.  \"Ask my cousin, Mr. Crow,\" said Jasper Jay instantly. \"He's a great traveller. Spends his winters in the South, _he_ does. And no doubt he can help you.\"  [Illustration: Buster Thanks Old Mr. Crow For His Advice. (_Page 25_)]  \"Where can I find Mr. Crow?\" Buster Bumblebee asked.  \"I don't know of any better place to look than the cornfield,\" Jasper Jay told him.  Luckily Buster knew where the cornfield was. So he started off at once to find Mr. Crow.  And sure enough! as soon as Buster reached the edge of the cornfield, there was the old gentleman, sitting on the topmost rail of the fence and looking as if he had just enjoyed an excellent meal.  As soon as he saw that Buster Bumblebee wanted to talk with him, old Mr. Crow was willing enough to listen, for he always liked to know about other people's affairs. He kept nodding his head with a wise air while Buster explained to him how he wished to find some cotton, with which to stuff his ears every night, so that he might not be disturbed when the trumpeter aroused the household at three or four o'clock each morning.  \"That's a splendid plan,\" said old Mr. Crow when Buster had finished. \"An excellent plan--but you may as well forget it, because there's no cotton growing in these parts. Cotton grows in the South, more than a thousand miles away. Next winter when I go to the South I might be able to find some for you, and bring it back with me in the spring. But that wouldn't help you now.\"  Buster Bumblebee was quite discouraged. And since he didn't know what to do, he asked Mr. Crow what he would suggest.  \"Why don't you set back the hands of the family clock?\" the old gentleman asked. \"If you make the clock three or four hours slow the trumpeter won't trumpet until six or seven or eight o'clock. And I'm sure that's late enough for anybody to get up.\"  Buster shook his head mournfully.  \"We haven't any clock at our house,\" he explained.  \"Then----\" said old Mr. Crow, \"then, if you want more sleep why don't you go to bed earlier? If you went to bed three or four hours before sunset you wouldn't mind getting up at dawn.\"  \"Hurrah!\" Buster shouted. \"That's just what I'll do! And I'm certainly much obliged to you, Mr. Crow, for helping me.\"  \"Don't mention it,\" said the old gentleman, looking greatly pleased with himself.  \"I won't tell anybody,\" Buster promised.  \"Oh, I didn't mean that, exactly,\" Mr. Crow told him hastily. \"If you want to inform your friends how clever I am, I have no objection, of course.\"  Then Buster went off, thinking what a kind person old Mr. Crow was. And that very afternoon, long before sunset, he curled himself up in an out-of-the-way corner of the house and went to sleep. Everybody was so busy hurrying in and out in order to finish the day's work that no one noticed or disturbed him. And when the trumpeter sounded the rising call the next morning Buster Bumblebee was actually the first one in the house to open his eyes and jump up and hasten out to get his breakfast.  All of which only went to prove that old Mr. Crow knew a thing or two--and maybe even more.     VI  JOHNNIE GREEN IS STUNG   There had been so much rain early in the summer that even by the middle of August Farmer Green had not been able to finish his haying. His son Johnnie was sorry, too--because he had to work in the hot hayfield almost every day, when he would far rather have gone swimming in the mill-pond, under the shade of the great willow.  Sometimes Johnnie rode on the hayrake. And since he liked to drive the old horse Ebenezer, he didn't object to that part of his duties so much. What he hated most was pitching hay with a pitchfork. And next to that, he disliked going to the spring for a jugful of water.  But those unpleasant tasks were nothing at all compared with what happened to him one day when he stepped squarely upon the doorway of the Bumblebee family's house.  Johnnie's carelessness made the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18662"],["title","The Tale of Buster Bumblebee (#2)"],["body","angry at once. And several of them rushed out and stung Johnnie Green severely.  Then _he_ was angry. And he declared he would \"fix them\"--as soon as he could think of a good way to do it.  And that very afternoon, while he was bringing the heavy jug from the spring, Johnnie Green thought of a fine plan for punishing the Bumblebee family. He liked his plan so well that he could hardly wait to try it; and he went back to the hayfield almost at a run, whereas he usually sauntered along so slowly that his father often had to speak to him somewhat sharply.  But this time Farmer Green could not complain. Johnnie even brought the jug--and the tin cup too--to the knoll in the meadow where his father and the hired man were working. And then Farmer Green said:  \"How are your stings now?\"  \"Awful!\" Johnnie informed him hopefully.  \"Maybe you'd like to stop work for the rest of the day and go swimming,\" said Farmer Green, with a wink at the hired man, \"unless you're feeling too miserable,\" he added.  \"Oh, yes! Oh, no!\" cried Johnnie. \"My stings aren't too bad for that!\" And he started off at once across the field, taking the jug with him.  \"I'll leave the jug among the brakes in the fence-corner,\" he called, as he trotted away.  Now, Johnnie Green took the jug with him because he needed it. It was part of his plan for punishing the Bumblebee family. And instead of going straight to the fence-corner, Johnnie made at once for the Bumblebee family's front door. As soon as he reached it he poured some of the water out of the jug--but not all of it. Then he put his ear to the jug's mouth and listened. And he smiled happily--in spite of his stings--as he heard the roar from inside it.  Buster Bumblebee, hurrying home to go to bed--for he was still following Mr. Crow's plan--Buster noticed Johnnie and wondered what he was doing. But as soon as he went inside the house he forgot all about Johnnie Green. And when, a few moments later, there was a terrible sound of scraping and scratching in the long hall that led to the innermost part of the house, Buster Bumblebee never once thought to mention to anyone that he had seen Johnnie in the dooryard.     VII  A JUGFUL OF BUMBLEBEES   When the workers--as well as Buster Bumblebee--heard the raking, scraping sound in the hall of their house they all stopped what they were doing and shrilled \"An enemy!\" And with one accord they rushed for the front door. They were terribly angry.  Not wishing to miss anything that was going to happen, Buster joined the mob and went sailing out into the open meadow. And there, quite close to the door, stood the queer object that Buster had noticed together with Johnnie Green only a minute before. He wondered now what that strange thing was; for Buster Bumblebee did not know a jug when he saw one. And neither did the workers, nor any other member of the Bumblebee family.  \"That's the enemy!\" cried Buster suddenly, pointing to the jug. \"It was talking out of its mouth right into Johnnie Green's ear when I came home.\"  Sounding a dreadful battle cry, all the workers turned upon the jug and buzzed so near it that they couldn't help hearing the same roaring from inside it to which Johnnie Green had listened with so much pleasure.  \"Buster's almost right!\" several of the workers shouted. \"The enemy has hidden inside this thing. And we'll have to go in and sting him.\"  At that the workers began to pop into the jug, which Johnnie Green had thoughtfully left uncorked. And Buster Bumblebee, still eager to see everything, hastened to plunge inside the dim jug along with the rest.  It was soon not a dim but a dark jug. For the moment the last angry Bumblebee had disappeared inside it Johnnie Green stole quickly up from behind a haycock and slipped the cork into the mouth of the jug.  Johnnie's face wore a grin of joy. Perhaps he did not stop to realize that he was breaking up a happy home.  \"I've got 'em!\" he shouted aloud. And then he shook the jug vigorously, listening with delight to the sound of the splashing water within. Soon he set the jug behind the sheltering haycock and sat down beside it to make further plans. It was Johnnie's intention then to drown everything on the farm that carried a sting--wasps, hornets, honey bees. He was not quite sure about mosquitoes, for he thought they might be hard to capture in great numbers.  Since he was intending to go swimming, he did not care to waste much more of the afternoon by staying in the meadow. So he proceeded to empty the jug.  It certainly _looked_ as if the Bumblebee family had met with ill fortune. Several dozen workers--and Buster, too--lay limp and water-soaked upon the ground, when Johnnie Green hurried away to the spring to get more water for his father and the hired man, before he went to the mill-pond.  But it was not long before the half-drowned Buster and his companions began to stir slightly. Gradually the sun dried their wings and warmed their chilled bodies. And one by one they picked themselves up and scurried into their house.  They never knew exactly what had happened. But the workers agreed upon one point. They decided that somehow the whole trouble had been Buster's fault--though they couldn't explain in just what way.  Anyhow, after that the workers looked on Buster with more disfavor than ever. They were forever remarking how lazy and stupid he was. And even the trumpeter was heard to declare that she was ashamed of him--though he _was_ her own brother.     VIII  BUSTER THE BOASTER   As far back as Buster Bumblebee could remember, he had heard about the Robber Fly. Even the fiercest fighters among the workers spoke his name with great awe. And from everything Buster could learn, his family had good reason to fear that dreadful enemy.  When Buster first left the house to make excursions to the flower garden and the clover field he had felt quite uneasy. He half-expected that the Robber Fly would pop out from behind a blossom at any moment and pounce upon him. For the Robber Fly was a bold, bad villain. And those that were so unfortunate as to find themselves caught by him and held fast in his long, spiny feet had only a very slight chance of getting away from him.  No one of the Bumblebee family knew where the Robber Fly lived. But it was said that he often lurked on the ground, watching for victims. And when he spied one he would fly quickly up with a loud buzz and dart upon the unfortunate.  He had big, keen eyes which enabled him to see very clearly. And he had long, narrow wings which bore him through the air with great swiftness. And he had--worst of all--a sharp, piercing beak which was most frightful to gaze upon.  Now, in spite of his name the Robber Fly looked like no fly that was ever seen in Pleasant Valley. Strange as it may seem, in spite of his cruel beak, his long wings, and his spiny feet, he looked not a little as if he might have been a near relation of Buster Bumblebee. Of course, any member of the Bumblebee family would have known at a glance that he was not one of them. But probably Johnnie Green--if he had noticed him--would have thought the Robber Fly some sort of bumblebee.  Since this monster was known to appear now and then in the neighborhood, one can easily understand why Buster Bumblebee was a bit timid when he first began to venture abroad alone. But as time passed, his dread of meeting the Robber Fly gradually faded. Not only had nobody seen the Robber for a long while, but some began to say that they thought he must have met with an accident, or perhaps he had moved to other parts, and they didn't believe he would ever be heard of again. And Buster himself began to boast that he wasn't afraid of the Robber Fly and said that he was sorry that the Robber had gone away before he had had a chance to see him.  Buster's mother, the Queen, happened to hear her son make that remark one day. And she promptly told him that he was a stupid, silly boaster.  \"If you knew what happened to your poor father last fall you would never want even to hear the Robber Fly's name mentioned again,\" the Queen declared, as a shiver--or a shudder--or both--passed up and down her royal back.  But Buster Bumblebee, being very young and somewhat stupid as well, said \"Oh, nonsense!\" under his breath, so low that his mother, the Queen, could not hear him.     IX  THE ROBBER FLY AT LAST   Though Buster's mother, the Queen, did not hear him when he said \"Oh, nonsense!\" under his breath, there were others standing near him that caught the words. And they were quite indignant that anybody should scoff at the Queen like that.  They were workers--those that overheard Buster Bumblebee's remark when his mother as much as told him that he had better beware of the wicked Robber Fly. They were workers; and they did not approve of the lazy Buster.  \"Let's teach that young loafer a lesson!\" they said to one another (there were three of them). And straightway they began to scheme and plan how they should give Buster Bumblebee a thorough fright, in the hope of making him more respectful to his mother, the Queen.  At least, that is what the workers said. But, as a matter of fact, each of them had reasons of her own for wanting to scare Buster. Indeed, there wasn't a worker in the house that was not disgusted with his laziness. And if he hadn't been the son of the Queen they would certainly have driven him out into the wide world long before.  Of course, Buster had no idea of what was afoot. He continued to tell everybody how sorry he was that he had never met the Robber Fly, until a few began to believe that he must be very brave indeed. But they were those that didn't know him well. As for the workers, there wasn't one in the Bumblebee household that was deceived by Buster's bold talk. They all knew him for the coward he was.  Well, the very next day after Buster's impertinence to his mother a worker called Peevish Peggy stopped and spoke to him as he sat on a clover-head.  \"If I were you I wouldn't "]]]
