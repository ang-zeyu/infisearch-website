Minesweeper at work.  H.M. KING GEORGE V.     FLAG AND FLEET   BOOK I  THE ROWING AGE   CHAPTER I  THE VERY BEGINNING OP SEA-POWER  (10,000 years and more B.C.)  Thousands and thousands of years ago a naked savage in southern Asia found that he could climb about quite safely on a floating log.  One day another savage found that floating down stream on a log was very much easier than working his way through the woods.  This taught him the first advantage of sea-power, which is, that you can often go better by water than land.  Then a third savage with a turn for trying new things found out what every lumberjack and punter knows, that you need a pole if you want to shove your log along or steer it to the proper place.  By and by some still more clever savage tied two logs together and made the first raft.  This soon taught him the second advantage of sea-power, which is, that, as a rule, you can carry goods very much better by water than land.  Even now, if you want to move many big and heavy things a thousand miles you can nearly always do it ten times better in a ship than in a train, and ten times better in a train than by carts and horses on the very best of roads.  Of course a raft is a poor, slow, clumsy sort of ship; no ship at all, in fact.  But when rafts were the only \"ships\" in the world there certainly were no trains and nothing like one of our good roads.  The water has always had the same advantage over the land; for as horses, trails, carts, roads, and trains began to be used on land, so canoes, boats, sailing ships, and steamers began to be used on water.  Anybody can prove the truth of the rule for himself by seeing how much easier it is to paddle a hundred pounds ten miles in a canoe than to carry the same weight one mile over a portage.  Presently the smarter men wanted something better than a little log raft nosing its slow way along through dead shallow water when shoved by a pole; so they put a third and longer log between the other two, with its front end sticking out and turning up a little.  Then, wanting to cross waters too deep for a pole, they invented the first paddles; and so made the same sort of catamaran that you can still see on the Coromandel Coast in southern India.  But savages who knew enough to take catamarans through the pounding surf also knew enough to see that a log with a hollow in the upper side of it could carry a great deal more than a log that was solid; and, seeing this, they presently began making hollows and shaping logs, till at last they had made a regular dug-out canoe.  When Christopher Columbus asked the West Indian savages what they called their dug-outs they said _canoas_; so a boat dug out of a solid log had the first right to the word we now use for a canoe built up out of several different parts.  [Illustration: \"DUG-OUT\" CANOE]  Dug-outs were sometimes very big.  They were the Dreadnought battleships of their own time and place and people.  When their ends were sharpened into a sort of ram they could stave in an enemy's canoe if they caught its side full tilt with their own end.  Dug-out canoes were common wherever the trees were big and strong enough, as in Southern Asia, Central Africa, and on the Pacific Coast of America. But men have always been trying to invent something better than what their enemies have; and so they soon began putting different pieces together to make either better canoes or lighter ones, or to make any kind that would do as well as or better than the dug-out.  Thus the ancient Britons had coracles, which were simply very open basket-work covered with skins.  Their Celtic descendants still use canvas coracles in parts of Wales and Ireland, just as the Eskimos still use skin-covered kayaks and oomiaks.  The oomiak is for a family with all their baggage.  The kayak--sharp as a needle and light as a feather--is for a well-armed man.  The oomiak is a cargo carrier.  The kayak is a man-of-war.  When once men had found out how to make and use canoes they had also found out the third and final principle of sea-power, which is, that if you live beside the water and do not learn how to fight on it you will certainly be driven off it by some enemy who has learnt how to fight there.  For sea-power in time of war simply means the power to use the sea yourself while stopping the enemy from using it.  So the first duty of any navy is to keep the seaways open for friends and closed to enemies.  And this is even more the duty of the British Navy than of any other navy.  For the sea lies between all the different parts of the British Empire; and so the life-or-death question we have to answer in every great war is this: does the sea unite us by being under British control, or does it divide us by being under enemy control? United we stand: divided we fall.  At first sight you would never believe that sea-power could be lost or won as well by birchbarks as by battleships.  But if both sides have the same sort of craft, or one side has none at all, then it does not matter what the sort is.  When the Iroquois paddled their birch-bark canoes past Quebec in 1660, and defied the French Governor to stop them, they \"commanded\" the St. Lawrence just as well as the British Grand Fleet commanded the North Sea in the Great War; and for the same reason, because their enemy was not strong enough to stop them. Whichever army can drive its enemy off the roads must win the war, because it can get what it wants from its base, (that is, from the places where its supplies of men and arms and food and every other need are kept); while its enemy will have to go without, being unable to get anything like enough, by bad and roundabout ways, to keep up the fight against men who can use the good straight roads.  So it is with navies. The navy that can beat its enemy from all the shortest ways across the sea must win the war, because the merchant ships of its own country, like its men-of-war, can use the best routes from the bases to the front and back again; while the merchant ships of its enemy must either lose time by roundabout voyages or, what is sure to happen as the war goes on, be driven off the high seas altogether.  The savages of long ago often took to the water when they found the land too hot for them.  If they were shepherds, a tyrant might seize their flocks.  If they were farmers, he might take their land away from them.  But it was not so easy to bully fishermen and hunters who could paddle off and leave no trace behind them, or who could build forts on islands that could only be taken after fights in which men who lived mostly on the water would have a much better chance than men who lived mostly on the land.  In this way the water has often been more the home of freedom than the land: liberty and sea-power have often gone together; and a free people like ourselves have nearly always won and kept freedom, both for themselves and others, by keeping up a navy of their own or by forming part of such an Empire as the British, where the Mother Country keeps up by far the greatest navy the world has ever seen.  The canoe navies, like other navies, did very well so long as no enemy came with something better.  But when boats began to gain ground, canoes began to lose it.  We do not know who made the first boat any more than we know who made the first raft or canoe.  But the man who laid the first keel was a genius, and no mistake about it; for the keel is still the principal part of every rowboat, sailing ship, and steamer in the world.  There is the same sort of difference between any craft that has a keel and one that has not as there is between animals which have backbones and those which have not.  By the time boats were first made someone began to find out that by putting a paddle into a notch in the side of the boat and pulling away he could get a stronger stroke than he could with the paddle alone.  Then some other genius, thousands of years after the first open boat had been made, thought of making a deck.  Once this had been done, the ship, as we know her, had begun her glorious career.  But meanwhile sails had been in use for very many thousands of years. Who made the first sail?  Nobody knows.  But very likely some Asiatic savage hoisted a wild beast's skin on a stick over some very simple sort of raft tens of thousands of years ago.  Rafts had, and still have, sails in many countries.  Canoes had them too.  Boats and ships also had sails in very early times, and of very various kinds: some made of skins, some of woven cloth, some even of wooden slats.  But no ancient sail was more than what sailors call a wind-bag now; and they were of no use at all unless the wind was pretty well aft, that is, more or less from behind.  We shall presently find out that tacking, (which is sailing against the wind), is a very modern invention; and that, within three centuries of its invention, steamers began to oust sailing craft, as these, in their turn, had ousted rowboats and canoes.     CHAPTER II  THE FIRST FAR WEST  (The last 5000 years B.C.)  This chapter begins with a big surprise.  But it ends with a bigger one still.  When you look first at the title and then at the date, you wonder how on earth the two can go together.  But when you remember what you have read in Chapter I you will see that the countries at the Asiatic end of the Mediterranean, though now called the Near East, were then the Far West, because emigrants from the older lands of Asia had gone no farther than this twelve thousand years ago.  Then, as you read the present chapter, you will see emigrants and colonies moving farther and farther west along the Mediterranean and up the Atlantic shores of Europe, until, at last, two thousand years before Columbus, the new Far West consisted of those very shores of Spain and Portugal, France and the British Isles, from which the whole New Western World of North and South America was to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19849"],["title","Flag and Fleet: How the British Navy Won the Freedom of the Seas (#2)"],["body","settled later on.  The Atlantic shores of Europe, and not the Mediterranean shores of Asia and of Egypt, are called here \"The First Far West\" because the first really Western people grew up in Europe and became quite different from all the Eastern peoples.  The Second Far West, two thousand years later, was America itself.  _Westward Ho!_ is the very good name of a book about adventures in America when this Second Far West was just beginning.  \"Go West!\" was the advice given to adventurous people in America during the nineteenth century.  \"The Last West and Best West\" is what Canadians now call their own North-West.  And it certainly is the very last West of all; for over there, across the Pacific, are the lands of southern Asia from which the first emigrants began moving West so many thousand years ago. Thus the circuit of the World and its migrations is now complete; and we can at last look round and learn the whole story, from Farthest East to Farthest West.  Most of it is an old, old story from the common points of view; and it has been told over and over again by many different people and in many different ways.  But from one point of view, and that a most important point, it is newer now than ever.  Look at it from the seaman's point of view, and the whole meaning changes in the twinkling of an eye, becoming new, true, and complete.  Nearly all books deal with the things of the land, and of the land alone, their writers forgetting or not knowing that the things of the land could never have been what they are had it not been for the things of the sea.  Without the vastly important things of the sea, without the war fleets and merchant fleets of empires old and new, it is perfectly certain that the world could not have been half so good a place to live in; for freedom and the sea tend to go together.  True of all people, this is truer still of us; for the sea has been the very breath of British life and liberty ever since the first hardy Norseman sprang ashore on English soil.  Nobody knows how the Egyptians first learnt ship-building from the people farther East.  But we do know that they were building ships in Egypt seven thousand years ago, that their ninth king was called Betou, which means \"the prow of a ship\", and that his artists carved pictures of boats five hundred years older than the Great Pyramid.  These pictures, carved on the tombs of the kings, are still to be seen, together with some pottery, which, coming from the Balkans, shows that Betou had boats trading across the eastern end of the Mediterranean.  A picture carved more than six thousand years ago shows an Egyptian boat being paddled by fourteen men and steered with paddles by three more on the right-hand side of the stern as you look toward the bow.  Thus the \"steer-board\" (or steering side) was no new thing when its present name of \"starboard\" was used by our Norse ancestors a good many hundred years ago.  The Egyptians, steering on the right-hand side, probably took in cargo on the left side or \"larboard\", that is, the \"load\" or \"lading\" side, now called the \"port\" side, as \"larboard\" and \"starboard\" sounded too much alike when shouted in a gale.  Up in the bow of this old Egyptian boat stood a man with a pole to help in steering down the Nile.  Amidships stood a man with a cat-o'-nine-tails, ready to slash any one of the wretched slave paddlers who was not working hard.  All through the Rowing Age, for thousands and thousands of years, the paddlers and rowers were the same as the well-known galley-slaves kept by the Mediterranean countries to row their galleys in peace and war.  These galleys, or rowing men-of-war, lasted down to modern times, as we shall soon see.  They did use sails; but only when the wind was behind them, and never when it blew really hard.  The mast was made of two long wooden spars set one on each side of the galley, meeting at the head, and strengthened in between by braces from one spar to another.  As time went on better boats and larger ones were built in Egypt.  We can guess how strong they must have been when they carried down the Nile the gigantic blocks of stone used in building the famous Pyramids.  Some of these blocks weigh up to sixty tons; so that both the men who built the barges to bring them down the Nile and those who built these huge blocks into the wonderful Pyramids must have known their business pretty well a thousand years before Noah built his Ark.  The Ark was built in Mesopotamia, less than five thousand years ago, to save Noah from the flooded Euphrates.  The shipwrights seem to have built it like a barge or house-boat.  If so, it must have been about fifteen thousand tons, taking the length of the cubit in the Bible story at eighteen inches.  It was certainly not a ship, only some sort of construction that simply floated about with the wind and current till it ran aground.  But Mesopotamia and the shores of the Persian Gulf were great places for shipbuilding.  They were once the home of adventurers who had come West from southern Asia, and of the famous Phoenicians, who went farther West to find a new seaboard home along the shores of Asia Minor, just north of Palestine, where they were in the shipping business three thousand years ago, about the time of the early Kings of Israel.  These wonderful Phoenicians touch our interest to the very quick; for they were not only the seamen hired by \"Solomon in all his glory\" but they were also the founders of Carthage and the first oversea traders with the Atlantic coasts of France and the British Isles.  Their story thus goes home to all who love the sea, the Bible, and Canada's two Mother Lands.  They had shipping on the Red Sea as well as on the Mediterranean; and it was their Red Sea merchant vessels that coasted Arabia and East Africa in the time of Solomon (1016-976 B.C.).  They also went round to Persia and probably to India.  About 600 B.C. they are said to have coasted round the whole of Africa, starting from the Red Sea and coming back by Gibraltar.  This took them more than two years, as they used to sow wheat and wait on shore till the crop was ripe.  Long before this they had passed Gibraltar and settled the colony of Tarshish, where they found silver in such abundance that \"it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon.\"  We do not know whether it was \"the ships of Tarshish and of the Isles\" that first felt the way north to France and England.  But we do know that many Phoenicians did trade with the French and British Celts, who probably learnt in this way how to build ships of their own.     CHAPTER III  EAST AGAINST WEST  (480-146 B.C.)  For two thousand years Eastern fleets and armies tried to conquer Europe.  Sometimes hundreds of years would pass without an attack.  But the result was always the same--the triumph of West over East; and the cause of each triumph was always the same--the sea-power of the West. Without those Western navies the Europe and America we know today could never have existed.  There could have been no Greek civilization, no Roman government, no British Empire, and no United States.  First, the Persians fought the Greeks at Salamis in 480 B.C.  Then Carthage fought Rome more than two hundred years later.  Finally, the conquering Turks were beaten by the Spaniards at Lepanto more than two thousand years after Salamis, but not far from the same spot, Salamis being ten miles from Athens and Lepanto a hundred.  Long before Salamis the Greeks had been founding colonies along the Mediterranean, among them some on the Asiatic side of the Aegean Sea, where the French and British fleets had so much to do during the Gallipoli campaign of 1915 against the Turks and Germans.  Meanwhile the Persians had been fighting their way north-westwards till they had reached the Aegean and conquered most of the Greeks and Phoenicians there.  Then the Greeks at Athens sent a fleet which landed an army that burnt the city of Sardis, an outpost of Persian power.  Thereupon King Darius, friend of the Prophet Daniel, vowed vengeance on Athens, and caused a trusty servant to whisper in his ear each day, \"Master, remember Athens!\"  Now, the Persians were landsmen, with what was then the greatest army in the world, but with a navy and a merchant fleet mostly manned by conquered Phoenicians and Greek colonists, none of whom wanted to see Greece itself destroyed.  So when Darius met the Greeks at Marathon his fleet and army did not form the same sort of United Service that the British fleet and army form.  He was beaten back to his ships and retired to Asia Minor.  But \"Remember Athens!\" was always in his mind. So for ten years he and his son Xerxes prepared a vast armada against which they thought no other force on earth could stand.  But, like the Spanish Armada against England two thousand years later, this Persian host was very much stronger ashore than afloat.  Its army was so vast that it covered the country like a swarm of locusts.  At the world-famous pass of Thermopylae the Spartan king, Leonidas, waited for the Persians.  Xerxes sent a summons asking the Greeks to surrender their arms.  \"Come and take them,\" said Leonidas.  Then wave after wave of Persians rushed to the attack, only to break against the dauntless Greeks.  At last a vile traitor told Xerxes of another pass (which the Greeks had not men enough to hold, though it was on their flank).  He thus got the chance of forcing them either to retreat or be cut off. Once through this pass the Persians overran the country; and all the Spartans at Thermopylae died fighting to the last.  Only the Grecian fleet remained.  It was vastly out-numbered by the Persian fleet.  But it was manned by patriots trained to fight on the water; while the Persians themselves were nearly all landsmen, and so had to depend on the Phoenicians and colonial Greek seamen, who were none too eager for the fray.
