They walked over to the edge and stopped at the balustrade.  \"Kato, when you write up your stuff, I want you to falsify everything you can. Put it in such form that the data will be absolutely worthless, but also in such form that nobody, not even Team members, will know it has been falsified. Can you do that?\"  Kato's almond-shaped eyes widened. \"Of course I can, Dunc,\" he replied. \"But why--?\"  \"I hate to say this, but we have a traitor in the Team. One of those people back in the dining room is selling us out to the Fourth Komintern. I know it's not Karen, and I know it's not you, and that's as much as I do know, now.\"  The Japanese sucked in his breath in a sharp hiss. \"You wouldn't say that unless you were sure, Dunc,\" he said.  \"No. At about 1000 this morning, Dr. Weissberg, the civilian director, called me to his office. I found him very much upset. He told me that General Nayland is accusing us--by which he meant this Team--of furnishing secret information on our subproject to Komintern agents. He said that British Intelligence agents at Smolensk had learned that the Red Triumph laboratories there were working along lines of research originated at MacLeod Team Center here. They relayed the information to Western Union Central Intelligence, and WU passed it on to United States Central Intelligence, and now Counter Espionage is riding Nayland about it, and he's trying to make us the goat.\"  \"He would love to get some of us shot,\" Kato said. \"And that could happen. They took a long time getting tough about espionage in this country, but when Americans get tough about something, they get tough right. But look here; we handed in our progress-reports to Felix Weissberg, and he passed them on to Nayland. Couldn't the leak be right in Nayland's own HQ?\"  \"That's what I thought, at first,\" MacLeod replied. \"Just wishful thinking, though. Fact is, I went up to Nayland's HQ and had it out with him; accused him of just that. I think I threw enough of a scare into him to hold him for a couple of days. I wanted to know just what it was the Komintern was supposed to have got from us, but he wouldn't tell me. That, of course, was classified-stuff.\"  \"Well?\"  \"Well then, Karen and I got our digestive tracts emptied and went in to town, where I could use a phone that didn't go through a military switch-board, and I put through a call to Allan Hartley, President Hartley's son. He owes us a break, after the work we did in Puerto Rico. I told him all I wanted was some information to help clear ourselves, and he told me to wait a half an hour and then call Counter Espionage Office in Washington and talk to General Hammond.\"  \"Ha! If Allan Hartley's for us, what are we worried about?\" Kato asked. \"I always knew he was the power back of Associated Enterprises and his father was the front-man: I'll bet it's the same with the Government.\"  \"Allan Hartley's for us as long as our nose is clean. If we let it get dirty, we get it bloodied, too. We have to clean it ourselves,\" MacLeod told him. \"But here's what Hammond gave me: The Komintern knows all about our collapsed-matter experiments with zinc, titanium and nickel. They know about our theoretical work on cosmic rays, including Suzanne's work up to about a month ago. They know about that effect Sir Neville and Heym discovered two months ago.\" He paused. \"And they know about the photon-neutrino-electron interchange.\"  Kato responded to this with a gruesome double-take that gave his face the fleeting appearance of an ancient samurai war mask.  \"That wasn't included in any report we ever made,\" he said. \"You're right: the leak comes from inside the Team. It must be Sir Neville, or Suzanne, or Heym ben-Hillel, or Adam Lowiewski, or Rudolf von Heldenfeld, or--No! No, I can't believe it could be Farida!\" He looked at MacLeod pleadingly. \"You don't think she could have--?\"  \"No, Kato. The Team's her whole life, even more than it is mine. She came with us when she was only twelve, and grew up with us. She doesn't know any other life than this, and wouldn't want any other. It has to be one of the other five.\"  \"Well, there's Suzanne,\" Kato began. \"She had to clear out of France because of political activities, after the collapse of the Fourth Republic and the establishment of the Rightist Directoire in '57. And she worked with Joliot-Curie, and she was at the University of Louvain in the early '50s, when that place was crawling with Commies.\"  \"And that brings us to Sir Neville,\" MacLeod added. \"He dabbles in spiritualism; he and Suzanne do planchette-seances. A planchette can be manipulated. Maybe Suzanne produced a communication advising Sir Neville to help the Komintern.\"  \"Could be. Then, how about Lowiewski? He's a Pole who can't go back to Poland, and Poland's a Komintern country.\" Kato pointed out. \"Maybe he'd sell us out for amnesty, though why he'd want to go back there, the way things are now--?\"  \"His vanity. You know, missionary-school native going back to the village wearing real pants, to show off to the savages. Used to be a standing joke, down where I came from.\" MacLeod thought for a moment. \"And Rudolf: he's always had a poor view of the democratic system of government. He might feel more at home with the Komintern. Of course, the Ruskis killed his parents in 1945--\"  \"So what?\" Kato retorted. \"The Americans killed my father in 1942, but I'm not making an issue out of it. That was another war; Japan's a Western Union country, now. So's Germany----How about Heym, by the way? Remember when the Komintern wanted us to come to Russia and do the same work we're doing here?\"  \"I remember that after we turned them down, somebody tried to kidnap Karen,\" MacLeod said grimly. \"I remember a couple of Russians got rather suddenly dead trying it, too.\"  \"I wasn't thinking of that. I was thinking of our round-table argument when the proposition was considered. Heym was in favor of accepting. Now that, I would say, indicates either Communist sympathies or an overtrusting nature,\" Kato submitted. \"And a lot of grade-A traitors have been made out of people with trusting natures.\"  MacLeod got out his pipe and lit it. For a long time, he stared out across the mountain-ringed vista of sagebrush, dotted at wide intervals with the bulks of research-centers and the red roofs of the villages.  \"Kato, I think I know how we're going to find out which one it is,\" he said. \"First of all, you write up your data, and falsify it so that it won't do any damage if it gets into Komintern hands. And then--\"         *       *       *       *       *  The next day started in an atmosphere of suppressed excitement and anxiety, which, beginning with MacLeod and Karen and Kato Sugihara, seemed to communicate itself by contagion to everybody in the MacLeod Team's laboratories. The top researchers and their immediate assistants and students were the first to catch it; they ascribed the tension under which their leader and his wife and the Japanese labored to the recent developments in the collapsed-matter problem. Then, there were about a dozen implicitly-trusted technicians and guards, who had been secretly gathered in MacLeod's office the night before and informed of the crisis that had arisen. Their associates could not miss the fact that they were preoccupied with something unusual.  They were a variegated crew; men who had been added to the Team in every corner of the world. There was Ahmed Abd-el-Rahman, the Arab jeep-driver who had joined them in Basra. There was the wiry little Greek whom everybody called Alex Unpronounceable. There was an Italian, and two Chinese, and a cashiered French Air Force officer, and a Malay, and the son of an English earl who insisted that his name was Bertie Wooster. They had sworn themselves to secrecy, had heard MacLeod's story with a polylingual burst of pious or blasphemous exclamations, and then they had scattered, each to the work assigned him.  MacLeod had risen early and submitted to the ordeal of the search to leave the reservation and go to town again, this time for a conference at the shabby back-street cigar store that concealed a Counter Espionage center. He had returned just as Farida Khouroglu was finishing the microfilm copies of Kato's ingeniously-concocted pseudo-data. These copies were distributed at noon, while the Team was lunching, along with carbons of the original type-script.  He was the first to leave the table, going directly to the basement, where Alex Unpronounceable and the man who had got his alias from the works of P. G. Wodehouse were listening in on the telephone calls going in and out through the Team-center switch-board, and making recordings. For two hours, MacLeod remained with them. He heard Suzanne Maillard and some woman who was talking from a number in the Army married-officers' settlement making arrangements about a party. He heard Rudolf von Heldenfeld make a date with some girl. He listened to a violent altercation between the Team chef and somebody at Army Quartermaster's HQ about the quality of a lot of dressed chicken. He listened to a call that came in for Adam Lowiewski, the mathematician.  \"This is Joe,\" the caller said. \"I've got to go to town late this afternoon, but I was wondering if you'd have time to meet me at the Recreation House at Oppenheimer Village for a game of chess. I'm calling from there, now.\"  \"Fine; I can make it,\" Lowiewski's voice replied. \"I'm in the middle of a devil's own mathematical problem; maybe a game of chess would clear my head. I have a new queen's-knight gambit I want to try on you, anyhow.\"  Bertie Wooster looked up sharply. \"Now there; that may be what we're--\"  The telephone beside MacLeod rang. He scooped it up; named himself into it.  It was Ahmed Abd-el-Rahman. \"Look, chief; I tail this guy to Oppenheimer Village,\" the Arab, who had learned English from American movies, answered. \"He goes into the rec-joint. I slide in after him, an' he ain't"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18816"],["title","Stand By The Union (#1)"],["body","his trousers. With the light in his hand, he opened the door; but there was no one there, and not a sound of any kind could be heard. He walked about the hall in his bare feet, and listened attentively at the doors of several of the chambers, especially at that of Mr. Pembroke, the invalid gentleman whom, with his daughter, he had brought home as a passenger in the captured Vixen.  Christy heard nothing, and he silently descended the stairs to the lower hall. All was as quiet there as upon the floor above, and he had begun to think that the impression he had received had been given him in a dream, though he could not remember that he had been dreaming. But when he came to the front door, he found it was ajar. It was usually secured by a spring lock, and those who were liable to be out in the evening were provided with night-keys.  At the present time his father was in Washington, and he could not have neglected to close the door. He had been to the railroad station to meet the last train, thinking it possible that his father might return, and he was confident that he had been the last to enter the house. He was very sure that he had not left the door unfastened, and this assurance made him confident that some person had entered the house. The noise at the door of his chamber was not an illusion or a dream: though it had been made by closing rather than by opening it, or he would have been likely to find the intruder in his room when he lighted his lamp.  It seemed to him to be a matter of course that the midnight visitor had come into the mansion for the purpose of plundering its occupants, or of securing the valuables it contained. Putting his lamp on the table, he went out upon the veranda, and looked all about him. The grounds were very extensive, and a broad avenue led to the street. It was very dark; but as he cast his eyes in the direction of the grand entrance to the estate, he discovered some dark object in motion; but he lost sight of it in a moment.  It was a living being, or it would not move, and he was certain that he had made a discovery. Then two regrets flashed through his mind as he stepped down from the veranda; the first, that he had not put on his shoes before he left his chamber, and the second, that he had not taken his pistols, for a bullet would travel a great deal faster than a barefooted officer, even of the United States Navy. But he ran with all his speed to the street, to the great detriment of his uncovered feet.  He reached the grand entrance in an exceedingly short space of time; but he might as well have been in his chamber, for no ruffian, robber, or Confederate spy could be seen. He had no means of knowing which way the intruder at the mansion had turned, to the right or the left, or whether, like the timid colored gentleman in a trying situation, he had taken to the woods. Christy walked up the street, and then down the street; but the underbrush had recently been cut in the grove, and he did not venture to explore it without any protection for his feet.  He peered into the gloom of the night with all his eyes, and listened with all his ears for over an hour; and then, watchful and careful officer as he was, there were five hundred chances against him to one in his favor, of finding the intruder, and he reluctantly returned to the mansion.  Like the other male occupants of the house, the lieutenant was provided with a night-key. For one who had only just developed a tolerably thriving mustache, Christy was a prudent and methodical young gentleman. As a part of his method, he had a great many small drawers in his rooms, and a dozen or more keys; but he had never lost them, for the reason that he carried them chained to his nether garment. But he had two sets of keys, one for the house, and one for the ship. He had taken the night-key from the former, and put it in his vest pocket; and when he reached the front door of the mansion, the key he wanted was in his chamber, and he had been careful to shut the door when he left the house.  He could not get in, and he walked around the building to find a window which had not been closed. His mother had a reasonable dread of robbers, and she always looked out for the windows before she retired. He did not wish to arouse the family by ringing the great gong bell, but it was too cold to spend the rest of the night out-doors in his half-clothed condition, for he was as liable to take a severe cold as any less brilliant individual, and he might have to spend a month in his chamber, instead of reporting to the flag-officer of the Eastern Gulf squadron, in command of the Bronx.  He rang the bell, and the sound from it reverberated through the entire mansion. It was some time before a servant came to open the door; but the man who let him in was astonished to see him partially dressed, and wondered if he had not been walking in his sleep. In the lower hall, he was satisfied that the whole house was astir, for the gong which had sounded was the \"emergency bell,\" used only when the ordinary one at the front door was not likely to be heard.  \"Walsh!\" called Mrs. Passford from the head of the stairs.  \"Yes, ma'am,\" replied the man who had admitted Christy, and who was still wondering what fit, freak, or fancy had beset the young officer.  \"Who is it? What is the matter?\" demanded the lady of the mansion, in tones which indicated anxiety if not alarm.  \"It is Mr. Christy, ma'am; nothing is the matter,\" replied Walsh; but then he appeared to think that he had replied without proper consideration, and he revised his speech. \"I don't know that anything's the matter, ma'am,\" and still he gazed at the young gentleman, as though he deemed it possible that he had suddenly gone crazy.  \"Nothing is the matter, mother,\" called Christy. \"I am all right.\"  \"But why are you out at this time of night, my son? It is nearly two o'clock in the morning,\" said Mrs. Passford, as she descended the stairs. \"You are not half dressed, Christy.\"  \"But I am all right, mother, and there is not the least reason to worry about anything, for the ship is not going to the bottom just yet,\" replied Christy, indulging in a forced laugh to assist in quieting his mother's fears.  \"But why are you out doors at this time of night?\" Mrs. Passford insisted. \"You will catch a cold that will lay you up, if you go out in that condition.\"  \"I should not have rung that bell if I had not been afraid of taking cold,\" added the son.  \"But, Christy, something has happened; and you must tell me about it, or I shall not sleep another wink to-night,\" persisted the lady, concluding that her son was trying to conceal something from her, as indeed he was, for he feared it would alarm her if he told her some one had come into the house.  \"There is nothing to be frightened about, mother; and I will tell you all about it,\" added Christy, as he took his overcoat from the stand and put it on. \"I waked an hour ago, or more, with the idea that some one had opened the door of my room,\" and he related the circumstances to his mother, including his search in the grounds and the road.  \"Do you think any one came into the house?\" asked Mrs. Passford, though with but little of the woman's terror that such a statement might have caused.  \"That is my decided opinion. A noise at my chamber door woke me; I found the front door ajar, though I know I closed it when I came in last night, and I saw something moving down the avenue, which could only have been a man. Of course, I conclude that it was a burglar; but none of us have been killed or harmed.\"  Christy went to his room and completed his toilet. The house was warm, and he was soon comfortable enough after the out-door chill. By this time Miss Florry Passford had put in an appearance in the upper hall, with Bertha Pembroke. The alarm was again briefly explained, and the invalid gentleman was assured that nothing alarming had occurred. Then the young lieutenant and his mother proceeded to ascertain what the burglar had accomplished in the house.  On the lower floor nothing appeared to have been disturbed. In the parlor a gold watch, adorned with diamonds, had been left on the table by Florry, who had forgotten it; but it had not been taken. The burglar could not have helped seeing it if he had explored the house as such gentry do on such occasions. In the dining-room no attempt to open the steel safe set in the wall, which contained a vast amount of silver, jewelry, money, and other valuables, had been made. In a word, wherever they examined the rooms, no sign of any depredations could be discovered. The burglar did not appear to have lunched in the pantry where some choice viands had been placed. The robber had certainly been very considerate, and had done no mischief either for plunder or diversion. He had evidently, in the opinion of Mrs. Passford and her son, undertaken a profitless enterprise.  \"But what could have been his object in coming into the house?\" asked the bewildered lady.  \"I shall have to give it up, mother.\"  \"He might have taken Florry's watch, she was so careless as to leave on the table in the sitting-room,\" added she.  \"But he did not.\"  \"He could not have been disturbed until you spoke to him; and he might have ransacked the whole of the lower part of the house.\"  \"But he did not.\"  They had given up the examination of the premises, and given up the conundrum, and Christy was leading the way up-stairs. He went into his room, followed by his mother.  \"He must have come into your room, my son, or you would not have heard him at the door. Perhaps he has robbed you,\" suggested Mrs. Passford.  The young officer declared he had nothing there to steal. As he spoke, he took from his coat pocket on the bedpost an envelope containing his commission and other papers. It was safe; so were his purse and watch.  The mystery was not solved till Christy embarked for the Gulf.     CHAPTER II  THE ABSCONDING MAN-SERVANT   Lieutenant Christopher Passford,"]]]
