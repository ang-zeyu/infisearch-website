As they all trotted along toward the big warehouse down by the dock, Stubby and the bulldog ran side by side, while Billy and the two cats ran on ahead. Presently Stubby barked: \"Oh, Billy! What do you think? Our new friend here says he is the full brother of Boozer, the bulldog that belonged to Captain Percy, and that he was in the Dog Hospital at the same time we were there, laid up with a broken leg.\"  \"The world is small after all. To think we should meet over here just after seeing your brother in France!\"  \"Hiss!\" warned Tiger. \"No more talking until we are inside the building. We are approaching the warehouse now and we must not let the watchmen see us. The only way we can get in is through a window in the basement that has been left open by mistake. There is a broad plank running from the window down to the floor that the men use with their wheelbarrows to carry out the dirt. It makes it very handy to get out. We all could jump down, but few of our club members can jump up so high. None of us can jump like Stubby here.\"  \"Bow-wow!\" barked the bulldog in a low voice as a man with a lantern turned into the alley down which they all were running. \"Hide quickly until he passes!\"  As the man passed them, they heard him muttering to himself: \"I never saw so many cats and dogs in my life as I have seen to-night in this alley. I did not know there were so many in the world! And when I get up to where I saw them they are all gone--disappeared--vamoosed. They must be the ghosts of the dead and gone dogs and cats that used to live in the warehouse.\"  Just then the bulldog, whose name was Buster, sneezed, which so startled the man that he ran as if he had been shot.  \"Nice brave watchmen they have!\" said Billy.  \"Plague take my nose!\" said Buster. \"It is so short and stubby that all the dust gets into it and to save my life I can't help sneezing. And I always do it at the most inopportune moment.\"  Just then a whistle sounded, and Tiger said, \"We must hurry! There goes the twelve o'clock whistle at the factory down the river. It is the signal for the night shift to come on.\"  [Illustration]  The warehouse being near where they were, in about five minutes they found themselves entering the low window Buster had spoken about. When they looked inside, it was pitch dark and as if they were looking into a coal pit. But their eyes being such that they could see in the dark, they had no trouble in walking the plank and soon found themselves on the floor of the cellar. It looked a black square in shape and there was absolutely nothing in it, Tiger said. Still in the distance they could see black shapes moving about.  \"What in the world is over in that corner?\" asked Billy.  \"Oh, they are only wharf rats,\" replied Tiger. \"Shall we charge down on them just for fun?\"  \"Say we do! But I hate rats as I do poison,\" said Billy.  \"So do I, but they are our natural enemies,\" answered Tiger.  \"Ours too,\" from Stubby.  \"You stand and watch the fun, while we rat haters kill a few,\" suggested Tiger.  \"Very well!\"  \"When I say _three_, all of you run for the bunch and kill as many as you can,\" instructed Tiger.  For the next ten minutes you never in all your life heard such squealing, snarling and snipping of teeth as there was in that cellar. Two unusually big cats and two dogs all bound to kill rats were fighting these fierce wharf rats. But what made the battle such a bloody one was that wharf rats are braver than house rats and will fight to the death when attacked. Being large, and having long, sharp teeth, more often than not they get the better of ordinary cats and dogs that are sicked on them. In less than fifteen minutes hundreds of rats had been killed, for Buster was a noted rat killer. All he did was to open his jaws, grab a rat in the middle of its back, give his head a shake and the rat's back was broken. Then he tossed that rat aside and served another one likewise.  The rats had all disappeared or else were lying dead in heaps when Billy heard Stubby give a whine of pain, and turning to discover where he was, he saw him standing in the midst of a pile of dead rats with one nearly half as large as himself hanging to his throat under his jaw. The rat had hold of Stubby in such a way he could not shake him off, and all the time the rat was sucking his blood.  Billy saw him in a minute and with one bound he was beside Stubby and had ripped the rat open with his long, sharp horn, which made its mouth open and set Stubby free.  \"Thank you, old fellow, for saving me! I was almost gone when you came with your timely assistance.\"  [Illustration]  \"I guess we have had enough fun with rats for one night,\" said Tiger, \"and we better be getting on or we will be late for the opening exercises.\"  \"I am a perfect mess!\" said Stubby in disgust. \"See how bloody I am.\"  \"So am I,\" replied Tiger.  \"I too,\" chimed in Button.  \"I tell you what let's do,\" proposed Stubby. \"It won't take five minutes. Let's run out and take a swim in the river. I can never appear before a strange audience with my coat looking like this.\"  \"I'll go with you,\" replied Buster.  \"I think,\" said Button, \"I would prefer cleaning my coat by rolling in that nice clean bank of sand in the corner of the cellar to swimming in the river.\"  \"I am with you on that proposition,\" said Tiger. \"No water for me when I can get good, clean sand! After a roll I shall come out as clean and shining as if I had been sent to the cleaner and run through a vat of gasoline.\"  Stubby and Buster went to the river and were soon swimming around and having great sport in the water as it was nice and warm. But presently Stubby stopped short and stared ahead of him, and what do you think he saw but a whole drove of rats swimming out to a big sea-going vessel that lay at anchor in the harbor.  \"Let's go ashore. I've seen all the rats I want to see for a coon's age. And you can't get me out of here too soon for they may attack us.\"  Soon Stubby and Buster, looking as clean as whistles, found Button and Tiger who also looked spick and span, and the four entered the clubroom, which was on one of the upper floors and as light as day for the light from four big electric street lamps came streaming in the window, lighting the room from corner to corner and making it as bright as if the lamps were in the room itself. And what a sight was there! Hundreds of dogs and cats were there sitting on benches arranged in a semicircle and graduated like the seats in a theater. For this room had been used as a lecture room to give instructions to sailors and soldiers before going overseas, and the benches and platform were just as they had left them.  On the platform, sitting upon their hind legs on chairs one could see every specie of dog from the Eskimo dog of the North to the tiny hairless dog of the tropics. There were big dogs, little dogs, middle-sized dogs, and cats of all sizes, colors and breeds. The snow-white Angora was there as well as the mangy alley cat. But all were on an equal at these meetings and there was no quarreling between aristocrat and the animal with no pedigree. All was harmony there. Could only the human race be as harmonious as these animals, the Brotherhood of Man would be established.  One after another the cats and dogs went on the platform and either told some funny episode that had happened to them or some tragedy that had occurred where they lived, or else they described the country from which they had come, and told how the natives lived.     CHAPTER III  AN EXCITING EVENING   The first dog called upon to lecture was an Eskimo dog with bright, snappy eyes, short, sharply pointed ears, strong legs and a bushy tail that gave him the appearance of a wolf, especially as his coat was just the color of that animal. And what more natural, as the Eskimo dog is the direct descendant of the timber wolf of the North? And though they may appear docile at times, still they always retain that half wild, ferocious look and manner.  He was a handsome, alert dog and spoke in quick, short sentences and to the point. He began by saying:  \"I expect that none of you are familiar with the far North, where it is day six months of the year and night the other six. But though the sun does not shine, don't think for a moment that we live in pitch darkness, for the stars and the Northern Lights make our nights most beautiful. In fact, they are more beautiful and varied than our days. Instead of the blazing rays of the sun that blind one, we have the ever varied, many colored rays of the Aurora Borealis, shooting stars and electrical displays of all kinds that far surpass even your most elaborate Fourth of July celebrations.  \"One moment the sky will be a sea-shell pink, with bars of vivid green, lavender and purple playing across it, while in the center will be a misty golden ball as if the sun was trying to shine through. The next instant all may be pitch darkness until this too is chased away by another electrical outburst. These go on constantly for the whole six months until they become so common an occurrence that the inhabitants pay no more attention to those magnificent displays than you do to your sun on a summer day.  \"Picture to yourself this wonderful sky, against which huge icebergs are seen, taller than your tallest church steeple, and more beautiful to look upon with their lacelike frostwork than your most elaborately carved white marble cathedral. All of this is reflected in detail in the clear, cold, deep green waters of the Arctic Ocean, where the big walruses, whales and seals live, to say nothing of the clumsy white polar bears that sit idly on a cake of ice waiting for an unwary fish to swim by so he may catch it and make a breakfast on it.  \"In round-topped, oven-like mounds made of ice and snow live our masters, the Eskimos. They live on whale oil, blubber, fish and the meat of the musk ox, bear and other animals"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18993"],["title","History  of the World War: An Authentic Narrative of the World's Greatest War (#1)"],["body","'s \"Army in Taxicabs\"--Foch, the \"Savior of   Civilization,\" Appears--His Mighty Thrust Routs the Army of   Hausen--Joffre Salutes Foch as \"First Strategist in Europe\"--Battle   that Won the Baton of a Marshal  CHAPTER VIII.
