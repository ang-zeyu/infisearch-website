She wanders lowing here and there,         And yet she cannot stray,     All in the pleasant open air,         The pleasant light of day.      And blown by all the winds that pass         And wet with all the showers,     She walks among the meadow grass         And eats the meadow flowers.  [Illustration]     FOREIGN LANDS       Up into the cherry tree     Who should climb but little me?     I held the trunk with both my hands     And looked abroad on foreign lands.      I saw the next door garden lie,     Adorned with flowers, before my eye,     And many pleasant places more     That I had never seen before.      I saw the dimpling river pass     And be the sky's blue looking-glass;     The dusty roads go up and down     With people tramping into town.      If I could find a higher tree     Farther and farther I should see,     To where the grown-up river slips     Into the sea among the ships.      To where the roads on either hand     Lead onward into fairy land,     Where all the children dine at five,     And all the playthings come alive.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]     SYSTEM       Every night my prayers I say,     And get my dinner every day;     And every day that I've been good     I get an orange after food.      The child that is not clean and neat,     With lots of toys and things to eat,     He is a naughty child, I'm sure--     Or else his dear papa is poor.  [Illustration]     AT THE SEASIDE       When I was down beside the sea,     A wooden spade they gave to me       To dig the sandy shore.     My holes were hollow like a cup,     In every hole the sea came up,       Till it could hold no more.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]     HAPPY THOUGHT       The world is so full of a number of things,     I'm sure we should all be as happy as kings  [Illustration]     THE LAND OF NOD       From breakfast on through all the day     At home among my friends I stay,     But every night I go abroad     Afar into the Land of Nod.      All by myself I have to go,     With none to tell me what to do--     All alone beside the streams     And up the mountain-sides of dreams.      The strangest things are there for me,     Both things to eat and things to see,     And many frightening sights abroad     Till morning in the Land of Nod.      Try as I like to find the way,     I never can get back by day,     Nor can remember plain and clear     The curious music that I hear.  [Illustration]     WINDY NIGHTS       Whenever the moon and stars are set,       Whenever the wind is high,     All night long in the dark and wet,       A man goes riding by.     Late in the night when the fires are out,  [Illustration]      Why does he gallop and gallop about?     Whenever the trees are crying aloud,       And ships are tossed at sea,     By, on the highway, low and loud,       By at the gallop goes he.     By at the gallop he goes, and then     By he comes back at the gallop again.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]     TIME TO RISE       A birdie with a yellow bill       Hopped up on the window sill,     Cocked his shining eye and said:     'Ain't you 'shamed, you sleepy-head?'  [Illustration]  [Illustration]     RAIN       The rain is raining all around.       It falls on field and tree,     It rains on the umbrellas here,       And on the ships at sea.  [Illustration]     FOREIGN CHILDREN       Little Indian, Sioux or Crow,     Little frosty Eskimo,     Little Turk or Japanee,     O! don't you wish that you were me?      You have seen the scarlet trees     And the lions over seas;     You have eaten ostrich eggs,     And turned the turtles off their legs.      Such a life is very fine,     But it's not so nice as mine:     You must often, as you trod,     Have wearied _not_ to be abroad.      You have curious things to eat,     I am fed on proper meat;     You must dwell beyond the foam,     But I am safe and live at home.  [Illustration]     LOOKING FORWARD         When I am grown to man's estate     I shall be very proud and great,       And tell the other girls and boys     Not to meddle with my toys.     MY SHADOW       I have a little shadow that goes in and out with me,     And what can be the use of him is more than I can see.     He is very, very like me, from the heels up to the head;     And I see him jump before me, when I jump into my bed.      The funniest thing about him is the way he likes to grow--     Not at all like proper children, which is always very slow;     For he sometimes shoots up taller, like an india-rubber ball,     And he sometimes gets so little that there's none of him at all.  [Illustration: \"_I have a little shadow._\"]      He hasn't got a notion of how children ought to play,     And can only make a fool of me in every sort of way.     He stays so close beside me, he's a coward you can see;     I'd think shame to stick to nursie as that shadow sticks to me!      One morning, very early, before the sun was up,     I 'rose and found the shining dew on every buttercup;     But my lazy little shadow, like an arrant sleepy head,     Had stayed at home behind me and was fast asleep in bed.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]     THE SUN'S TRAVELS       The sun is not a-bed when I     At night upon my pillow lie;     Still round the earth his way he takes,     And morning after morning makes.      While here at home in shining day,     We round the sunny garden play,     Each little Indian sleepy-head     Is being kissed and put to bed.      And when at eve I rise from tea,     Day dawns beyond the Atlantic Sea;     And all the children in the West     Are getting up and being dressed.  [Illustration]     LOOKING-GLASS RIVER       Smooth it slides upon its travel,     Here a wimple, there a gleam--         O the clean gravel!         O the smooth stream!      Sailing blossoms, silver fishes,       Paven pools as clear as air--         How a child wishes         To live down there!  [Illustration]      We can see our colored faces       Floating on the shaken pool         Down in cool places,         Dim and very cool;      Till a wind or water wrinkle,       Dipping marten, plumping trout,         Spreads in a twinkle         And blots all out.      See the rings pursue each other;       All below grows black as night,         Just as if mother         Had blown out the light!      Patience, children, just a minute--       See the spreading circles die;         The stream and all in it         Will clear by-and-by.  [Illustration]     THE LAMPLIGHTER       My tea is nearly ready and the sun has left the sky;     It's time to take the window to see Leerie going by;     For every night at teatime and before you take your seat,     With lantern and with ladder he comes posting up the street.      Now Tom would be a driver and Maria go to sea,     And my papa's a banker and as rich as he can be;     But I, when I am stronger and can choose what I'm to do,     O Leerie, I'll go round at night and light the lamps with you!      For we are very lucky, with a lamp before the door,     And Leerie stops to light it as he lights so many more;     And O, before you hurry by with ladder and with light,     O Leerie, see a little child and nod to him to-night!  [Illustration]     SINGING       Of speckled eggs the birdie sings       And nests among the trees;     The sailor sings of ropes and things       In ships upon the seas.      The children sing in far Japan,       The children sing in Spain;     The organ with the organ man       Is singing in the rain.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]     TRAVEL       I should like to rise and go     Where the golden apples grow;--     Where below another sky     Parrot Islands anchored lie,     And, watched by cockatoos and goats,     Lonely Crusoes building boats;--     Where in sunshine reaching out     Eastern cities, miles about,     Are with mosque and minaret     Among sandy gardens set,     And the rich goods from near and far     Hang for sale in the bazaar;--     Where the Great Wall round China goes,     And on one side the desert blows,     And with bell and voice and drum,     Cities on the other hum;--     Where are forests, hot as fire,     Wide as England, tall as a spire,     Full of apes and cocoa-nuts     And the negro hunters' huts;--     Where the knotty crocodile     Lies and blinks in the Nile,     And the red flamingo flies     Hunting fish before his eyes;--     Where in jungles, near and far,     Man-devouring tigers are,     Lying close and giving ear     Lest the hunt be drawing near,     Or a comer-by be seen     Swinging in a palanquin;--     Where among the desert sands     Some deserted city stands,     All its children, sweep and prince,     Grown to manhood ages since,     Not a foot in street or house,     Not a stir of child or mouse,     And when kindly falls the night,     In all the town no spark of light.     There I'll come when I'm a man     With a camel caravan;     Light a fire in the gloom     Of some dusty dining room;     See the pictures on the walls,     Heroes, fights and festivals     And in a corner find the toys     Of the old Egyptian boys.  [Illustration]     MY BED IS A BOAT  [Illustration: _My bed is like a little boat_]       My bed is like a little boat;       Nurse helps me in when I embark;     She girds me in my sailor's coat       And starts me in the dark.      At night, I go on board and say       Good night to all my friends on shore;     I shut my eyes and sail away       And see and hear no more.      And sometimes things to bed I take,       As prudent sailors have to do;     Perhaps a slice of wedding-cake,       Perhaps a toy or two.      All night across the dark we steer:       But when the day returns at last     Safe in my room, beside the pier,       I find my vessel fast.  [Illustration]     KEEPSAKE MILL       Over the borders, a sin without pardon,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19722"],["title","A Child's Garden of Verses (#2)"],["body","the branches and crawling below,     Out through the breach in the wall of the garden,       Down by the banks of the river, we go.      Here is the mill with the humming of thunder,       Here is the weir with the wonder of foam,     Here is the sluice with the race running under--       Marvelous places, though handy to home!      Sounds of the village grow stiller and stiller,       Stiller the note of the birds on the hill;     Dusty and dim are the eyes of the miller,       Deaf are his ears with the moil of the mill.      Years may go by, and the wheel in the river       Wheel as it wheels for us, children, to-day.     Wheel and keep roaring and foaming for ever       Long after all of the boys are away.      Home from the Indies and home from the ocean,       Heroes and soldiers we all shall come home;     Still we shall find the old mill wheel in motion,       Turning and churning that river to foam.      You with the bean that I gave when we quarreled,       I with your marble of Saturday last,     Honored and old and all gaily apparelled,       Here we shall meet and remember the past.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]     THE UNSEEN PLAYMATE       When children are playing alone on the green,     In comes the playmate that never was seen.     When children are happy and lonely and good,     The Friend of the Children comes out of the wood.      Nobody heard him and nobody saw,     His is a picture you never could draw,     But he's sure to be present, abroad or at home,     When children are happy and playing alone.      He lies in the laurels, he runs on the grass,     He sings when you tinkle the musical glass;     Whene'er you are happy and cannot tell why,     The Friend of the Children is sure to be by!      He loves to be little, he hates to be big,     'Tis he that inhabits the caves that you dig;     'Tis he when you play with your soldiers of tin     That sides with the Frenchman and never can win.      'Tis he, when at night you go off to your bed,     Bids you go to your sleep and not trouble your head;     For wherever they're lying, in cupboard or shelf,     'Tis he will take care of your playthings himself.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]     MY SHIP AND I.       O it's I that am the captain of a tidy little ship,       Of a ship that goes a-sailing on the pond;     And my ship it keeps a-turning all around and all about;     But when I'm a little older, I shall find the secret out       How to send my vessel sailing on beyond.      For I mean to grow as little as the dolly at the helm,       And the dolly I intend to come alive;     And with him beside to help me, it's a-sailing I shall go,     It's a-sailing on the water, when the jolly breezes blow     And the vessel goes a divie-divie dive.      O it's then you'll see me sailing through the rushes and the reeds,       And you'll hear the water singing at the prow;     For beside the dolly sailor, I'm to voyage and explore,     To land upon the island where no dolly was before,       And to fire the penny cannon in the bow.  [Illustration]     THE WIND       I saw you toss the kites on high     And blow the birds about the sky;     And all around I heard you pass,     Like ladies' skirts across the grass--       O wind, a-blowing all day long!       O wind, that sings so loud a song!      I saw the different things you did,     But always you yourself you hid.     I felt you push, I heard you call,     I could not see yourself at all--       O wind, a-blowing all day long,       O wind, that sings so loud a song!      O you that are so strong and cold,     O blower, are you young or old?     Are you a beast of field and tree,     Or just a stronger child than me?       O wind, a-blowing all day long,       O wind, that sings so loud a song!  [Illustration: \"_I felt you push, I heard you call._\"]  [Illustration]     A GOOD BOY       I woke before the morning, I was happy all the day,     I never said an ugly word, but smiled and stuck to play.      And now at last the sun is going down behind the wood,     And I am very happy, for I know that I've been good.      My bed is waiting cool and fresh, with linen smooth and fair,     And I must off to sleepsin-by, and not forget my prayer.      I know that, till to-morrow I shall see the sun arise,     No ugly dream shall fright my mind, no ugly sight my eyes.      But slumber hold me tightly, till I waken in the dawn,     And hear the thrushes singing in the lilacs round the lawn.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]     GOOD AND BAD CHILDREN       Children, you are very little,     And your bones are very brittle;     If you would grow great and stately,     You must try to walk sedately.      You must still be bright and quiet,     And content with simple diet;     And remain, through all bewild'ring,     Innocent and honest children.      Happy hearts and happy faces,     Happy play in grassy places--     That was how, in ancient ages,     Children grew to kings and sages.      But the unkind and the unruly,     And the sort who eat unduly,     They must never hope for glory--     Theirs is quite a different story!      Cruel children, crying babies,     All grow up as geese and gabies,     Hated, as their age increases,     By their nephews and their nieces.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]     PICTURE-BOOKS IN WINTER       Summer fading, winter comes--     Frosty mornings, tingling thumbs,     Window robins, winter rooks,     And the picture story-books.      Water now is turned to stone     Nurse and I can walk upon;     Still we find the flowing brooks     In the picture story-books.      All the pretty things put by     Wait upon the childrens' eye,     Sheep and shepherds, trees and crooks,     In the picture story-books.      We may see how all things are,     Seas and cities, near and far,     And the flying fairies' looks,     In the picture story-books.      How am I to sing your praise,     Happy chimney-corner days,     Sitting safe in nursery nooks,     Reading picture story-books?  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  [Illustration]     THE SWING       How do you like to go up in a swing,       Up in the air so blue?     Oh, I do think it the pleasantest thing       Ever a child can do!      Up in the air and over the wall,       Till I can see so wide,     Rivers and trees and cattle and all       Over the countryside--      Till I look down on the garden green,       Down on the roof so brown--     Up in the air I go flying again,       Up in the air and down!  [Illustration]     A THOUGHT       It is very nice to think      The world is full of meat and drink     With little children saying grace      In every Christian kind of place.     ARMIES IN THE FIRE       The lamps now glitter down the street;     Faintly sound the falling feet     And the blue even slowly falls     About the garden trees and walls.      Now in the falling of the gloom     The red fire paints the empty room;     And warmly on the roof it looks,     And flickers on the backs of books.      Armies march by tower and spire     Of cities blazing, in the fire;--     Till as I gaze with staring eyes,     The armies fade, the lustre dies.      Then once again the glow returns;     Again the phantom city burns;     And down the red-hot valley, lo!     The phantom armies marching go!      Blinking embers, tell me true     Where are those armies marching to,     And what the burning city is     That crumbles in your furnaces!  [Illustration]     MY KINGDOM       Down by a shining water well     I found a very little dell,         No higher than my head.     The heather and the gorse about     In summer bloom were coming out,         Some yellow and some red.      I called the little pool a sea;     The little hills were big to me;         For I am very small.     I made a boat, I made a town,     I searched the caverns up and down,         And named them one and all.      And all about was mine, I said,     The little sparrows overhead,         The little minnows, too.     This was the world and I was king;     For me the bees came by to sing,         For me the swallows flew.      I played there were no deeper seas,     Nor any wider plains than these,         Nor other kings than me.     At last I heard my mother call     Out from the house at evenfall,         To call me home to tea.      And I must rise and leave my dell,     And leave my dimpled water well,         And leave my heather blooms.     Alas! and as my home I neared,     How very big my nurse appeared,         How great and cool the rooms!  [Illustration]  [Illustration]     SHADOW MARCH       All round the house is the jet-black night;         It stares through the window-pane;     It crawls in the corners, hiding from the light,         And it moves with the moving flame.      Now my little heart goes a-beating like a drum,         With the breath of Bogie in my hair,     And all round the candle the crooked shadows come,         And go marching along up the stair.      The shadow of the balusters, the shadow of the lamp,         The shadow of the child that goes to bed--     All the wicked shadows coming, tramp, tramp, tramp,         With the black night overhead.  [Illustration]     WINTER-TIME       Late lies the wintry sun a-bed,     A frosty, fiery sleepy-head;     Blinks but an hour or two; and then,     A blood-red orange, sets again.      Before the stars have left the skies,     At morning in the dark I rise;     And shivering in my nakedness,     By the cold candle, bathe and dress.      Close by the jolly fire I sit     To warm my frozen bones a bit;     Or with a reindeer-sled, explore     The colder countries round the door.      When to go out, my nurse doth wrap     Me in my comforter and cap;     The cold wind burns my face and blows     Its frosty pepper up my nose.      Black are my steps on silver sod;     Thick blows my frosty breath abroad;     And tree and house, and hill and lake,     Are frosted like a wedding-cake.  [Illu"]]]
