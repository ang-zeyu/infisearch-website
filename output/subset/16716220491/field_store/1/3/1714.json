As they released our hands, with the always surprising strength that is part of the dancing woman's stock-in-trade, they slipped behind us suddenly and thrust us forward through the curtains.  There was not much to see in front of us. We found ourselves in a paneled corridor, whose narrow windows overlooked the river, facing a painted door sixty paces distant at the farther end. King strode down the corridor and knocked.  The answer was one word that I did not catch, although it rang like a suddenly struck chord of music, and the door yielded to the pressure of King's hand.  I entered behind him and the door swung shut of its own weight with a click. We were in a high-ceilinged, very long room, having seven sides. There were windows to right and left. A deep divan piled with scented cushions occupied the whole length of one long wall, and there were several huge cushions on the floor against another wall. There was one other door besides that we had entered by.  We stood in that room alone, but I know that King felt as uneasy as I did, for there was sweat on the back of his neck. We were being watched by unseen eyes. There is no mistaking that sensation.  Suddenly a voice broke silence like a golden bell whose overtones go widening in rings into infinity, and a vision of loveliness parted the curtains of that other door.  \"My lord comes as is meet--spurred, and ready to give new kingdoms to his king! Oh, how my lord is welcome!\" she said in Persian.  Her voice thrilled you, because of its perfect resonance, exactly in the middle of the note. She looked into King's eyes with challenging familiarity that made him smile, and then eyed me wonderingly. She glanced from me to a picture on the wall in blue of the Elephant-god--enormous, opulent, urbane, and then back again at me, and smiled very sweetly.  \"So you have brought Ganesha with you? The god of good luck! How wonderful! How does one behave toward a real god?\"  And while she said that she laid her hands on King's arms as naturally as if he were a lover whom she had not seen perhaps since yesterday. Plainly, there was absolutely nothing between him and her except his own obstinate independence. She was his if he wanted her.  She took King's hand with a laugh that had its roots in past companionship and led him to the middle, deepest window-seat, beneath which the river could be heard gurgling busily.  Then, when she had drawn the silken hangings until the softened light suggested lingering, uncounted hours, and had indicated with a nod to me a cushion in the corner, she came and lay on the cushions close to King, chin on hand, where she could watch his eyes.  King sat straight and square, watching her with caution that he did not trouble to conceal. She took his hand and raised the sleeve until the broad, gold, graven bracelet showed.  \"That link forged in the past must bind us two more surely than an oath,\" she said smiling.  \"I used it to show to the gatekeeper.\"  He sat cooly waiting for her next remark. And with almost unnecessary candor began to remove the bracelet and offer it back to her. So she unmasked her batteries, with a delicious little rippling laugh and a lazy, cat-like movement that betokened joy in the danger that was coming, if I know anything at all of what sign-language means.  \"I knew that very day that you resigned your commission in the army, and I laughed with delight at the news, knowing that the gods who are our servants had contrived it. I know why thou art here,\" she said; and the change from you to thou was not haphazard.  \"It is well known, Princess, that your spies are the cleverest in India,\" King answered.  \"Spies? I need no spies as long as old India lives. Friends are better.\"  \"Do all princesses break their promises?\" he countered, meeting her eyes steadily.  \"Never yet did I break one promise, whether it was for good or evil.\"  \"Princess,\" he answered, looking sternly at her, \"in Jamrud Fort you agreed to take no part again in politics, national or international in return for a promise of personal freedom and permission to reside in India.\"  \"My promise was dependent on my liberty. But is this liberty--to be forced to reside in this old palace, with the spies of the Government keeping watch on my doings, except when they chance to be outwitted? Nevertheless, I have kept my promise. Thou knowest me better than to think that I need to break promises in order to outwit a government of Englishmen!\"  \"Quibbles won't help, Princess,\" he answered. \"You promised to do nothing that Government might object to.\"  \"Well; will they object to my religion?\" she retorted, mocking him. \"Has the British _raj_ at last screwed up its courage to the point of trespassing behind the purdah and blundering in among religious exercises?\"  No man in his senses ever challenges a woman's argument until he knows the whole of it and has unmasked its ulterior purpose. So King sat still and said nothing, knowing that that was precisely what she did not want.  \"You must make terms with me, heaven-born!\" she went on, changing her tone to one of rather more suggestive firmness. \"The _Kali-Yug_ (age of darkness) is drawing to a close, and India awakes! There is froth on the surface--a rising here, an agitation there, a deal of wild talk everywhere, and the dead old government proposes to suppress it in the dead old ways, like men with paddles seeking to beat the waves down flat! But the winds of God blow, and the boat of the men with the paddles will be upset presently. Who then shall ride the storm? Their gunners will be told to shoot the froth as it forms and rises! But if there is a wise man anywhere he will make terms with me, and will set himself to guide the underlying forces that may otherwise whelm everything. I think thou art wise, my heaven-born. Thou wert wise once on a time.\"  \"Do you think you can rule India?\" King asked her; and he did not make the mistake of suggesting ridicule.  \"Who else can do it?\" she retorted. \"Do you think we come into the world to let fate be our master? Why have I royal blood and royal views, wealth, understanding and ambition, while the others have blindness and vague yearnings? Can you answer?\"  \"Princess,\" he answered, \"I had only one object in coming here.\"  \"I know that,\" she said nodding.  \"I have simply come to warn you.\"  \"_Chut!_\" she answered with her chin between her hands and her elbows deep in the cushions. \"I know how much is known. This man--what is his name? Ramsden? Pouff! Ganesha, here, is far better! Ganesha is from America. Those fools who went to prepare the American mind for what is coming, because they were altogether too foolish to be anything but in the way in India, have been found out, and Ganesha has come like a big bull-buffalo to save the world by thrusting his clumsy horns into things he does not understand! I tell you, Athelstan, that however much is known there is much more that is not known. You would better make terms with me!\"  \"What you must understand, Princess, is that your plan to overthrow the West and make the East the world's controlling force, is known by those who can prevent you,\" he answered quietly. \"You see, I can't go away from here and tell whoever asks me that you are observing your promise to----\"  \"No,\" she interrupted with a ringing merry laugh of triumph. \"You speak truth without knowing it! You can not go away!\"  Princess Yasmini's boast was good. But we had come to solve a problem, not to run away with it, and she looked disconcerted by our rather obvious willingness to be her prisoners for a while.  \"Do you think I can not be cruel?\" she asked suddenly.  \"I have seen you at your worst, as well as at your best!\" King answered.  \"You act like a man who has resources. Yet you have none,\" she answered slowly, as if reviewing all the situation in her mind. \"None knows where you are--not even Mulji Singh, with whom you left your other clothes before putting on that uniform the better to impress me! The bag that you and Ganesha share between you, like two mendicants emerging from the jail, is now in a room in this palace. You came because you saw that if I should be arrested there would be insurrection. You said so to Ommony sahib, and his butler overheard. But not even Ommony knows where you are. He said to you: 'If you can defeat that woman without using violence, you'll stand alone in the world as the one man who could do it. But if you use violence, though you kill her, she will defeat you and all the rest of us.' Is not that what your Friend Ommony said?\"  \"What kind of terms do you want me to make with you, Princess?\" King answered.  \"I can make you ruler of all India!\" she said. \"Another may wear the baubles, but thou shalt be the true king, even as thy name is! And behind thee, me, Yasmini, whispering wisdom and laughing to see the politicians strut!\"  King leaned back and laughed at her.  \"Do you really expect me to help you ruin my own countrymen, go back on my color, creed, education, oath and everything, and----\"  \"Deluded fools! The East--the East, Athelstan, is waking! Better make terms with me, and thou shalt live to ride on the arising East as God rides on the wind and bits and governs it!\"  \"Very well,\" he said. \"Show me. I'll do nothing blindfold.\"  \"Hah! Thou art not half-conquered yet,\" she laughed. \"And what of Ganesha? Is this mountain of bones and thews a person to be trusted, or shall we show him how much stronger than him is a horsehair in a clever woman's fingers?\"  \"This man Ramsden is my friend,\" King said.  \"Are you _his_ friend?\" she retorted.  He nodded.  \"You are going to see the naked heart of India!\" she said. \"Better to have your eyes burned out now than see that and be false to it afterward!\"  Then, since we failed to order red-hot needles for our eyes, she cried out once--one clear note that sounded almost exactly as if she had struck a silver"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18990"],["title","Billy Whiskers' Adventures (#1)"],["body","and sound and in a good home where they will be well cared for until he hears what to do with them.\"  \"I guess I'll leave the door of the shed open,\" said the Uncle. \"It will make it more cheerful for them. And I think we had better take those ropes off their necks as they can't get out of the yard without going through the house or jumping the fence, and it is much too high for them to do that.\"  Little did those sailors and the old man know of the jumping powers of these three animals or he would never have had them untied. When the sailors and the old man had disappeared in the house, the three Chums walked around the yard looking for a loop-hole to crawl through, or for a weak board Billy might butt down. As for Button, all he had to do was to run up the fence and jump down on the other side. And did they but know it, Stubby could do the same stunt as he had watched the police dogs in Paris run up the side of an eight-foot fence, balance themselves on the top and leap down on the other side. As for Billy, when he was ready to go he could jump on top of an old packing box that stood beside the shed, and from that leap to the roof of the shed. From there he could spring into the alley. But what bothered them now was where they should go when they escaped. The city was very large and it stretched itself out along the banks of the Hudson River for miles and miles. They wanted to go in that direction, as 'way up north lived Nannie, Billy's little wife whom he was crazy to see after his long absence abroad. She was away up in Wisconsin on the dear old farm and it would take weeks and weeks to reach there if they traveled by foot all the way. But they expected to steal some rides as they always did when traveling. Stubby and Button had not a relative in the world they knew of, but they loved Nannie and all of Billy's family as if they were their very own blood relations. They had known them for years and years and had always been very kind to them, especially Nannie and Daisy, Billy's son's wife, while the Kids, Billy's twin grandchildren, were their delight.  [Illustration]  The three Chums were lying perfectly still, each engrossed in his own thoughts and plans as how best to get out of the city when they were aroused by a loud meow over their heads. Looking up, they saw a big, striped cat sitting on the fence.  \"Good-morning, friends and distinguished travelers!\" said the cat. \"I hope I am not disturbing you, but the cats and the dogs of the neighborhood--and there is a goodly number of them--appointed me the head of a committee to call upon you and welcome you to our shores.\"  As the cat had been talking, other cats had been appearing on top of the fence and now a line of them, all sizes, colors and descriptions, sat on the top of the fence winking down at the Chums, while through holes under the fence appeared dogs' heads, as evidently they were too large of body to crawl through the small holes.  \"The canary you see in the cage hanging out of that upper window, and the parrot in the window of the next house sang and called out to us this morning that celebrated travelers from the War had just arrived from overseas and were shut in Grandpa Stubbs' back yard. Every one around here calls Mr. Stubbs grandpa because he is so kind to little children and to all animals. We are always glad to hear some things of the outside world, and when we heard that you were fresh from the war zone, we determined to make your acquaintance and invite you to speak and tell us of some of your adventures on the other side. I am president of the Dog and Cat Information Bureau, and we are holding a meeting to-night in a big, empty warehouse that has just been finished for the storage of ammunition. We have a very large membership--five hundred dogs and cats belonging. Having no newspaper, we meet to exchange the news of the day. If we did not, we would not know what was going on in the world outside our city. As it is, we are well posted for dogs and cats journey here from all over the world to speak at our meetings and to tell us what is happening in the countries from which they come. Now I hope all of you will favor us by speaking at our meeting to-night. It begins at twelve o'clock, and I will come and escort you to our place of meeting. We start rather late as it is easier for us to steal away from our homes unmolested at that hour than at any other. Many of our members are children's pets and can't get away until they are tucked in bed as they keep such close track of them.\"  Billy stood up and bowing to the line of cats on the fence and to the heads of the dogs under the fence, he began:  \"Friends and countrymen, we thank you for your courtesy and kind invitation to speak before your club this evening. This we will be pleased to do provided we can escape our host and are not locked in the shed. But I think I can promise you we will be there for if we should be shut in the shed, my good strong head can butt down and make short work of a board or two that would give us access to the alley. Should we be tied, we can easily chew the rope in two. Consequently I think you may expect us at the appointed hour if some one will kindly show us the way to where your meeting is to be held.\"  Just then Mr. Stubbs opened the back door, and stepped into the yard.  \"Bless my soul! I never saw so many dogs and cats in my life. I must be seeing things, for surely there can't be that many cats and dogs in this neighborhood.\" He rubbed his eyes to make sure he had seen a line of cats sitting on top of the fence and a line of dogs peeping under the fence. But when he looked again, there was not a single cat or dog to be seen. The only ones he could discover were Stubby and Button, both apparently asleep outside the shed door.  \"Well, I declare that is the most peculiar thing that ever happened to me in my life! I distinctly saw dozens of cats and dogs and now I can't see one. Heigho! My old eyes must be playing tricks with me.\" And that was all he thought about it. He had come out to shut the Chums in the shed, but seeing them all three fast asleep, he decided to let them sleep on and not shut them in the shed that night.    [Illustration: Billy saw the man raise the mop to come after him   (Page 35)]     CHAPTER II  THE NEW YORK DOG AND CAT CLUB   \"He really is an accommodating old fellow, isn't he,\" said Billy, \"to leave us out all night? It will save him a broken shed door, though he will never know it.\"  \"What time do you suppose it is?\" asked Stubby.  \"From the height of the moon I should say it must be about half past ten,\" answered Button.  \"That will give us an hour and a half to think up what we are going to talk about at the club to-night. What are you going to tell them, Billy?\" said Stubby.  \"I really don't know. Guess I will wait for the inspiration of the moment.\"  \"You better think up something extra exciting. Why not tell them about the time you were blown out of the trenches and lost a piece of your tail? Or, better yet, when you broke into the German headquarters and butted the great Hindenburg himself,\" advised Button.  \"Very well, I will, as probably that would be as interesting as anything I could recount. What are you two fellows going to relate to them?\"  \"I think I shall tell them about our trip on the canal boat in France,\" replied Button.  \"And I plan to describe to them the Dog Hospital and tell how it was blown up by the Germans,\" added Stubby.  \"It is quite an idea,\" said Billy, \"their having a club like this. It keeps them in touch with all that goes on throughout the whole country. I am quite anxious to see what it is like.\"  As the hands of the clock in the Ferry station pointed to twelve, they heard a loud meow and looking up they saw the big cat that had first appeared to them sitting on the fence.  \"Well, friends, here I am! Are you ready to start?\"  \"All ready!\" replied Billy.  \"But how are you to get out?\"  \"We will show you,\" said Stubby, whereupon Billy hopped up on the packing box and from it onto the roof of the shed and then jumped down into the alley.  \"Very cleverly done!\" commended the cat, whose name, by the way, was Tiger because he was striped like one. \"But what puzzles me is how your friends are to get out as the jump is too high for them.\"  \"Too high for them, did you say? Nothing is too high for a dog that has done police duty in France. Listen! Did you not hear something hit the fence and then the scratch of nails on the boards? Well, that is my friend Stubby running up the side of the fence. From the sounds, evidently he did not get enough of a running start and fell back. But here he comes! See his head appearing over the top?\"  In a second Stubby appeared, balancing himself on the ridge of the fence. The next moment he stood beside them. At the same time Button also ran down a post of the fence.  \"Now we are all here, we'll have to hurry to allow for having to stop to hide when we see watchmen and strange dogs. Not knowing any of our members, you will have to be careful not to attack them, thinking they are enemies. I will give you the password. It is three short, sharp barks. On seeing another dog, all our members bark this password and if the dog they bark at does not reply in like manner, they know it is a stray dog. The cats all give three caterwauls in the same manner.\"  \"Oh,\" exclaimed Button, \"here comes a brute of a bulldog, whose mouth looks as if it were just watering for the back of a cat. Unless he gives the password quickly I shall take no chance but run up this tree. I am willing to tackle almost any dog but a bulldog.\"  \"Bow! Wow! Wow!\" barked the bulldog as he approached them.  \"Bow! Wow! Wow!\" replied Stubby, while Billy baaed, \"Baa! Baa! Baa!\" and Button meowed, \"Mew! Mew! Mew!\"  By this time the bulldog had come up to them and Tiger introduced them, telling the dog what distinguished friends he was meeting.
