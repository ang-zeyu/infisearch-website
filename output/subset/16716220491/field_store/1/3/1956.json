She'd kick and stamp, and jump about,     And set up such an awful shout,     That one who did not know the child,     Would say she must be going wild.  [Illustration]      In consequence it came to pass,     While one was quite a pretty lass,     And many a fond admirer gained,     And many a little gift obtained;  [Illustration]      The other, viewed with general scorn,     Was left forsaken and forlorn;     For no one can endure to see     A child all dirt and misery.     Behold how needful 'tis that we     Should clean in dress and person be;     Or else, believe me, 'tis in vain     We hope affection to obtain.  [Illustration]      A sloven will be always viewed     With pity by the wise and good;     While ev'n the vicious and the base     Behold with scorn a dirty face.  [Illustration]     ENVIOUS MINNIE       Now Minnie was a pretty girl,     Her hair so gracefully did curl;     She had a slender figure, too,     And rosy cheeks, and eyes of blue.     And yet, with all those beauties rare,     Those angel eyes and curly hair,     Oh! many, many faults had she,     The worst of which was jealousy.     When on the brilliant Christmas tree     St. Nicholas hung his gifts so free,     The envious Minnie could not bear     With any one those gifts to share.     And when her sisters' birthdays came     Minnie (it must be told with shame)     Would envy every pretty thing     Which dear Mamma to them would bring.  [Illustration]      Sometimes great tears rolled from her eyes,     Sometimes she pierced the air with cries,     For hours together she would fret     Because their toys she could not get.     Ah, then! how changed this pretty child,     No longer amiable and mild.     That fairy form and smiling face     Lost all their sprightliness and grace.     Her tender mother often sighed,     And to reform her daughter tried.     \"Oh! Minnie, Minnie,\" she would say,     \"Quite yellow you will turn some day.\"  [Illustration]      Now came the merry Christmas feast;     St. Nicholas brought to e'en the least     Such pretty presents, rich and rare,     But all the best for Minnie were.     Now to her little sister Bess     St. Nicholas brought a yellow dress;     This Minnie longed for (envious child),     And snatched it from her sister mild.     Then all in tears did Bessie run     To tell her mother what was done.  [Illustration]      Then Minnie ran triumphantly     To try the dress on, as you see.     But Minnie was not satisfied,     She pouted, fretted, sulked, and cried;     Sisters and brothers had no rest,--     She vowed their presents were the best,     And springing quickly to the glass,     What saw she there? Alas! alas!     Oh! what a sad, such deep disgrace!     She found she had a yellow face.     \"Ah, me!\" she cried, now, in despair,     \"Where are my rosy cheeks--oh, where?\"     Exclaimed her mother, \"Now you see     The punishment of jealousy.\"  [Illustration]     THE LITTLE GLUTTON       Oh! how this Mary loved to eat,--     It was her chief delight;     She would have something, sour or sweet,     To munch from morn till night.     She to the pantry daily stole,     And slyly she would take     Sugar, and plums, and sweetmeats, too,     And apples, nuts, and cake.  [Illustration]      Her mother Mary oft reproved,     But, ah! it did no good;     Munch, nibble, chew, from morn to night,     The little glutton would.  [Illustration]      One day, upon some bee-hives near     She chanced to cast her eyes;     \"How nice that honey there must taste!\"     She cried, and off she flies.     On tiptoe now the hives she nears,     Close up to them she creeps,     And through the little window panes     Quite cautiously she peeps.     \"Oh, dear! how good it looks!\" she cries,     As she the honey sees;     \"I must, I will, indeed, have some;     It cannot hurt the bees.\"     And then a hive she gently lifts,--     Oh, foolish, foolish child,--     Down, down it falls--out swarm the bees     Buzzing with fury wild.     With fright she shrieks, and tries to run,     But ah! 'tis all in vain;     Upon her light the angry bees,     And make her writhe with pain.  [Illustration]      Four weeks and more did Mary lie     Upon her little bed,     And, ah! instead of honey, she     On medicine was fed.     Her parents grieved so much at first     Their child so sick to see;     But once more well, with joy they found     Her cured of gluttony.  [Illustration]     SOPHIE SPOILALL       I never saw a girl or boy     So prone as Sophie to destroy     Whate'er she laid her hands upon,     Though tough as wood, or hard as stone;     With Sophie it was all the same,     No matter who the thing might claim,     No matter were it choice or rare,     For naught did the destroyer care.     Her playthings shared the common lot;     Though hers they were, she spared them not,     Her dolls she oft tore limb from limb,     To gratify a foolish whim.  [Illustration]      \"Fie!\" said her mother, \"don't you know,     That if you use your playthings so,     Kriss Kringle will in wrath refuse     To give you what you might abuse?     Remember, how in times gone by,     You've always found a rich supply     Of Christmas presents; but beware,     You'll find no more another year.\"  [Illustration]      You'd think such words would surely tend     To make this child her ways amend.     But no; she still her course pursued,     Regardless of advice so good.     But when her mother sees 'tis plain     That all her arguments are vain,     Says she, \"Since I have done my best,     I'll let experience do the rest.\"     Meantime the season of the year     For Christmas gifts was drawing near,     And Sophie doubted not that she     An ample store of them would see.     At length the happy hour was come.     The children, led into the room,     Behold, with wonder and surprise,     Three tables set before their eyes.     One is for Nelly, one for Ned,     And both with choicest treasures spread.

It is the public prison.  On the north are four:  1.  Aldersgate, as some think from alder trees; as others, from Aldericius, a Saxon.  2.  Cripplegate, from a hospital for the lame.  3.  Moorgate, from a neighbouring morass, now converted into a field, first opened by Francetius {14} the mayor, A.D. 1414.  4.  And Bishopsgate, from some bishop: this the German merchants of the Hans society were obliged by compact to keep in repair, and in times of danger to defend.  They were in possession of a key to open or shut it, so that upon occasion they could come in, or go out, by night or by day.  There is only one to the east:  Aldgate, that is, Oldgate, from its antiquity; though others think it to have been named Elbegate.  Several people believe that there were formerly two gates (besides that to the bridge) towards the Thames.  1.  Billingsgate, now a cothon, or artificial port, for the reception of ships.  2.  Dourgate, _vulgo_ Dowgate, _i.e._, Water-gate.  The cathedral of St. Paul was founded by Ethelbert, King of the Saxons, and being from time to time re-edified, increased to vastness and magnificence, and in revenue so much, that it affords a plentiful support to a bishop, dean, and precentor, treasurer, four archdeacons, twenty-nine prebendaries, and many others.  The roof of this church, as of most others in England, with the adjoining steeple, is covered with lead.  On the right side of the choir is the marble tomb of Nicholas Bacon, with his wife.  Not far from this is a magnificent monument, ornamented with pyramids of marble and alabaster, with this inscription:                             Sacred to the memory of      Sir Christopher Hatton, son of William, grandson of John, of the most     ancient family of the Hattons; one of the fifty gentlemen pensioners     to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth: Gentleman of the privy chamber;     captain of the guards; one of the Privy Council, and High Chancellor     of England, and of the University of Oxford: who, to the great grief     of his Sovereign, and of all good men, ended this life religiously,     after having lived unmarried to the age of fifty-one, at his house in     Holborn, on the 20th of November, A.D. 1591.      William Hatton, knight, his nephew by his sister’s side, and by     adoption his son and heir, most sorrowfully raised this tomb, as a     mark of his duty.  On the left hand is the marble monument of William Herbert, Earl of Pembroke, and his lady: and near it, that of John, Duke of Lancaster, with this inscription:      Here sleeps in the Lord, John of Gant, so called from the city of the     same name of Flanders, where he was born, fourth son of Edward the     Third, King of England, and created by his father Earl of Richmond.     He was thrice married; first to Blanche, daughter and heiress of     Henry Duke of Lancaster; by her he received an immense inheritance,     and became not only Duke of Lancaster, but Earl of Leicester,     Lincoln, and Derby, of whose race are descended many emperors, kings,     princes, and nobles.  His second wife was Constance, who is here     buried, daughter and heiress of Peter, King of Castile and Leon, in     whose right he most justly {17} took the style of King of Castile and     Leon.  She brought him one only daughter, Catherine, of whom, by     Henry, are descended the Kings of Spain.  His third wife was     Catherine, of a knight’s family, a woman of great beauty, by whom he     had a numerous progeny; from which is descended, by the mother’s     side, Henry the Seventh, the most prudent King of England, by whose     most happy marriage with Elizabeth, daughter of Edward the Fourth, of     the line of York, the two royal lines of Lancaster and York are     united, to the most desired tranquillity of England.      The most illustrious prince, John, surnamed Plantagenet, King of     Castile and Leon, Duke of Lancaster, Earl of Richmond, Leicester, and     Derby, Lieutenant of Aquitain, High Steward of England, died in the     twenty-first year of Richard II., A.D. 1398.  A little farther, almost at the entrance of the choir, in a certain recess, are two small stone chests, one of which is thus inscribed:      Here lies Seba, King of the East Saxons, who was converted to the     faith by St. Erkenwald, Bishop of London, A.D. 677.  On the other:            Here lies Ethelred, King of the Angles, son of King Edgar,      On whom St. Dustan is said to have denounced vengeance, on his     coronation day, in the following words:—“Inasmuch as thou hast     aspired to the throne by the death of thy brother, against whose     blood the English, along with thy infamous mother, conspired, the     sword shall not pass from thy house! but rage all the days of thy     life, afflicting all thy generation, till thy kingdom shall be     translated to another, whose manner and language the people under     thee knoweth not.  Nor shall thy sin be done away till after long     chastisement, nor the sin of thy mother, nor the sin of those men who     assisted in thy wicked council.”      All which came to pass as predicted by the saint; for after being     worsted and put to flight by Sueno King of the Danes, and his son     Canute, and at last closely besieged in London, he died miserably     A.D. 1017, after he had reigned thirty-six years in great     difficulties.  There is besides in the middle of the church a tomb made of brass, of some Bishop of London, named William, who was in favour with Edward, King of England, and afterwards made counsellor to King William.  He was bishop sixteen years, and died A.D. 1077.  Near this is the following inscription:                           Virtue survives the funeral.                                 To the memory of          Thomas Linacre, an eminent physician, John Caius placed this                                   monument.  On the lower part of it is this inscription in gold letters:      Thomas Linacre, physician to King Henry VIII., a man learned in the     Greek and Latin languages, and particularly skilful in physick, by     which he restored many from a state of languishment and despair to     life.  He translated with extraordinary eloquence many of Galen’s     works into Latin; and published, a little before his death, at the     request of his friends, a very valuable book on the correct structure     of the Latin tongue.  He founded in perpetuity in favour of students     in physick, two public lectures at Oxford, and one at Cambridge.  In     this city he brought about, by his own industry, the establishing of     a College of Physicians, of which he was elected the first president.     He was a detester of all fraud and deceit, and faithful in his     friendships; equally dear to men of all ranks: he went into orders a     few years before his death, and quitted this life full of years, and     much lamented, A.D. 1524, on the 29th of October.  There are many tombs in this church, but without any inscriptions.  It has a very fine organ, which, at evening prayer, accompanied with other instruments, is delightful.  In the suburb to the west, joined to the city by a continual row of palaces belonging to the chief nobility, of a mile in length, and lying on the side next the Thames, is the small town of Westminster; originally called Thorney, from its thorn bushes, but now Westminster, from its aspect and its monastery.  The church is remarkable for the coronation and burial of the Kings of England.  Upon this spot is said formerly to have stood a temple of Apollo, which was thrown down by an earthquake in the time of Antoninus Pius; from the ruins of which Sebert, King of the East Saxons, erected another to St. Peter: this was subverted by the Danes, and again renewed by Bishop Dunstan, who gave it to a few monks. Afterwards, King Edward the Confessor built it entirely new, with the tenth of his whole revenue, to be the place of his own burial, and a convent of Benedictine monks; and enriched it with estates dispersed all over England.  In this church the following things are worthy of notice:  In the first choir, the tomb of Anne of Cleves, wife of Henry VIII., without any inscription.  On the opposite side are two stone sepulchres: (1)  Edward, Earl of Lancaster, brother of Edward I.; (2)  Ademar of Valence, Earl of Pembroke, son of Ademar of Valence.  Joining to these is (3) that of Aveline, Countess of Lancaster.  In the second choir is the chair on which the kings are seated when they are crowned; in it is enclosed a stone, said to be that on which the patriarch Jacob slept when he dreamed he saw a ladder reaching quite up into heaven.  Some Latin verses are written upon a tablet hanging near it; the sense of which is:      That if any faith is to be given to ancient chronicles, a stone of     great note is enclosed in this chair, being the same on which the     patriarch Jacob reposed when he beheld the miraculous descent of     angels.  Edward I., the Mars and Hector of England, having conquered     Scotland, brought it from thence.  The tomb of Richard II. and his wife, of brass, gilt, and these verses written round it:      Perfect and prudent, Richard, by right the Second,        Vanquished by Fortune, lies here now graven in stone,     True of his word, and thereto well renound:        Seemly in person, and like to Homer as one     In worldly prudence, and ever the Church in one     Upheld and favoured, casting the proud to ground,     And all that would his royal state confound.  Without the tomb is this inscription:        Here lies King Richard, who perished by a cruel death, in the year                                     1369.                     To have been happy is additional misery.  Near him is the monument of his queen, daughter of the Emperor Wenceslaus.  On the left hand is the tomb of Edward I., with this inscription:              Here lies Edward I., who humbled the Scots. A.D. 1308.  "]]]
