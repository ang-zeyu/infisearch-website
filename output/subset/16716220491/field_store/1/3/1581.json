Mordecai, his heir-at-law, prospered.  We hear of him long after as an old man of substance and repute in Western Illinois.  He had decided views about Indians.  The sight of a redskin would move him to strange excitement; he would disappear into the bushes with his gun, and his conscience as a son and a sportsman would not be satisfied till he had stalked and shot him.  We are further informed that he was a \"good old man.\" Josiah also moved to Illinois, and it is pleasant to learn that he also was a good old man, and, as became a good old man, prospered pretty well.  But President Lincoln and his sister knew neither these excellent elders nor any other of their father's kin.  And those with whom the story of his own first twenty-one years is bound up invite almost as summary treatment.  Thomas Lincoln never prospered like Mordecai and Josiah, and never seems to have left the impress of his goodness or of anything else on any man.  But, while learning to carpenter under one Joseph Hanks, he married his employer's niece Nancy, and by her became the father first of a daughter Sarah, and four years later, at the farm near Hodgensville aforesaid, of Abraham, the future President.  In 1816, after several migrations, he transported his household down the Ohio to a spot on the Indiana shore, near which the village of Gentryville soon sprang up.  There he abode till Abraham was nearly twenty-one.  When the boy was eight his mother died, leaving him in his sister's care; but after a year or so Thomas went back alone to Kentucky and, after brief wooing, brought back a wife, Sarah, the widow of one Mr. Johnston, whom he had courted vainly before her first marriage.  He brought with her some useful additions to his household gear, and her rather useless son John Johnston. Relatives of Abraham's mother and other old neighbours--in particular John and Dennis Hanks--accompanied all the family's migrations. Ultimately, in 1830, they all moved further west into Illinois. Meanwhile Abraham from an early age did such various tasks for his father or for neighbouring farmers as from time to time suited the father.  When an older lad he was put for a while in charge of a ferry boat, and this led to the two great adventures of his early days, voyages with a cargo boat; and two mates down by river to New Orleans. The second and more memorable of these voyages was just after the migration to Illinois.  He returned from it to a place called New Salem, in Illinois, some distance from his father's new farm, in expectation of work in a store which was about to be opened.  Abraham, by this time, was of age, and in accordance with custom had been set free to shift for himself.  Each of these migrations was effected with great labour in transportation of baggage (sometimes in home-made boats), clearing of timber, and building; and Thomas Lincoln cannot have been wanting in the capacity for great exertions.  But historians have been inclined to be hard on him.  He seems to have been without sustained industry; in any case he had not much money sense and could not turn his industry to much account.  Some hint that he drank, but it is admitted that most Kentucky men drank more.  There are indications that he was a dutiful but ineffective father, chastising not too often or too much, but generally on the wrong occasion.  He was no scholar and did not encourage his son that way; but he had a great liking for stories.  He was of a peaceable and inoffensive temper, but on great provocation would turn on a bully with surprising and dire consequences.  Old Thomas, after Abraham was turned loose, continued a migrant, always towards a supposed better farm further west, always with a mortgage on him.  Abraham, when he was a struggling professional man, helped him with money as well as he could.  We have his letter to the old man on his death-bed, a letter of genuine but mild affection with due words of piety.  He explains that illness in his own household makes it impossible for him to pay a last visit to his father, and then, with that curious directness which is common in the families of the poor and has as a rule no sting, he remarks that an interview, if it had been possible, might have given more pain than pleasure to both.  Everybody has insisted from the first how little Abraham took after his father, but more than one of the traits attributed to Thomas will certainly reappear.  Abraham, as a man, when for once he spoke of his mother, whom he very seldom mentioned, spoke with intense feeling for her motherly care.  \"I owe,\" he said, \"everything that I am to her.\"  It pleased him in this talk to explain by inheritance from her the mental qualities which distinguished him from the house of Lincoln, and from others of the house of Hanks.  She was, he said, the illegitimate daughter of a Virginian gentleman, whose name he did not know, but from whom as he guessed the peculiar gifts, of which he could not fail to be conscious, were derived.  Sarah his sister was married at Gentryville to one Mr. Grigsby.  The Grigsbys were rather great people, as people went in Gentryville.  It is said to have become fixed in the boy's mind that the Grigsbys had not treated Sarah well; and this was the beginning of certain woes.  Sarah Bush Lincoln, his stepmother, was good to him and he to her. Above all she encouraged him in his early studies, to which a fretful housewife could have opposed such terrible obstacles.  She lived to hope that he might not be elected President for fear that enemies should kill him, and she lived to have her fear fulfilled.  His affectionate care over her continued to the end.  She lived latterly with her son John Johnston.  Abraham's later letters to this companion of his youth deserve to be looked up in the eight large volumes called his Works, for it is hard to see how a man could speak or act better to an impecunious friend who would not face his own troubles squarely.  It is sad that the \"ever your affectionate brother\" of the earlier letters declines to \"yours sincerely\" in the last; but it is an honest decline of affection, for the man had proved to be cheating his mother, and Abraham had had to stop it.  Two of the cousinhood, Dennis Hanks, a character of comedy, and John Hanks, the serious and steady character of the connection, deserve mention.  They and John Johnston make momentary reappearances again. Otherwise the whole of Abraham Lincoln's kindred are now out of the story.  They have been disposed of thus hastily at the outset, not because they were discreditable or slight people, but because Lincoln himself when he began to find his footing in the world seems to have felt sadly that his family was just so much to him and no more.  The dearest of his recollections attached to premature death; the next to chronic failure.  Rightly or wrongly (and we know enough about heredity now to expect any guess as to its working in a particular case to be wrong) he attributed the best that he had inherited to a licentious connection and a nameless progenitor.  Quite early he must have been intensely ambitious, and discovered in himself intellectual power; but from his twelfth year to his twenty-first there was hardly a soul to comprehend that side of him.  This chill upon his memory unmistakably influenced the particular complexion of his melancholy.  Unmistakably too he early learnt to think that he was odd, that his oddity was connected with his strength, that he might be destined to stand alone and capable of so standing.  The life of the farming pioneer in what was then the Far West afforded a fair prospect of laborious independence.  But at least till Lincoln was grown up, when a time of rapid growth and change set in, it offered no hope of quickly gotten wealth, and it imposed severe hardship on all.  The country was thickly wooded; the settler had before him at the outset heavy toil in clearing the ground and in building some rude shelter,--a house or just a \"half-faced camp,\" that is, a shed with one side open to the weather such as that in which the Lincoln family passed their first winter near Gentryville.  The site once chosen and the clearing once made, there was no such ease of cultivation or such certain fertility as later settlers found yet further west when the development of railways, of agricultural machinery, and of Eastern or European markets had opened out to cultivation the enormous stretches of level grass plain beyond the Mississippi.  Till population had grown a good deal, pioneer families were largely occupied in producing for themselves with their own hands what, in their hardy if not always frugal view, were the necessities and comforts of life.  They had no Eastern market for their produce, for railways did not begin to be made till 1840, and it was many years before they crossed the Eastern mountains.  An occasional cargo was taken on a flat-bottomed boat down the nearest creek, as a stream is called in America, into the Ohio and so by the innumerable windings of the Mississippi to New Orleans; but no return cargo could be brought up stream.  Knives and axes were the most precious objects to be gained by trade; woollen fabrics were rare in the West, when Lincoln was born, and the white man and woman, like the red whom they had displaced, were chiefly dressed in deer skins.  The woods abounded in game, and in the early stages of the development of the West a man could largely support himself by his gun.  The cold of every winter is there great, and an occasional winter made itself long remembered, like the \"winter of the deep snow\" in Illinois, by the havoc of its sudden onset and the suffering of its long duration.  The settling of a forest country was accompanied here as elsewhere by the occasional ravages of strange and destructive pestilences and the constant presence of malaria. Population was soon thick enough for"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18379"],["title","Abraham Lincoln (#2)"],["body","gatherings, convivial or religious, and in either case apt to be wild, but for long it was not thick enough for the life of most settlers to be other than lonely as well as hard.  Abraham Lincoln in his teens grew very fast, and by nineteen he was nearly six foot four.  His weight was never quite proportionate to this.  His ungainly figure, with long arms and large hands and relatively small development of chest, and the strange deep-cut lineaments of his face were perhaps the evidence of unfit (sometimes insufficient) food in these years of growth.  But his muscular strength was great, and startling statistical tales are told of the weight he could lift and the force of his blows with a mallet or an axe.  To a gentle and thoughtful boy with secret ambition in him such strength is a great gift, and in such surroundings most obviously so.  Lincoln as a lad was a valuable workman at the varied tasks that came his way, without needing that intense application to manual pursuits which the bent of his mind made irksome to him.  And he was a person of high consideration among the lads of his age and company.  The manners of the people then settling in Indiana and Illinois had not the extreme ferocity for which Kentucky had earlier been famous, and which crops up here and there in frontier life elsewhere.  All the same, as might naturally be supposed, they shared Plato's opinion that youths and men in the prime of life should settle their differences with their fists. Young Lincoln's few serious combats were satisfactorily decisive, and neither they nor his friendly wrestling bouts ended in the quarrels which were too common among his neighbours.  Thus, for all his originality and oddity, he early grew accustomed to mix in the sort of company he was likely to meet, without either inward shrinking or the need of conscious self-assertion.  In one thing he stood aloof from the sports of his fellows.  Most backwoodsmen were bred to the gun; he has told us that he shot a turkey when he was eight and never afterwards shot at all.  There is an early tale of his protests against an aimless slaughter of mud turtles; and it may be guessed that the dislike of all killing, which gave him sore trouble later, began when he was young.  Tales survive of his kindness to helpless men and animals.  It marks the real hardness of his surroundings, and their hardening effect on many, that his exertions in saving a drunken man from death in the snow are related with apparent surprise.  Some tales of his helping a pig stuck in a bog or a dog on an ice floe and the like seem to indicate a curious and lasting trait. These things seem not to have been done spontaneously, but on mature reflection after he had passed unheeding by.  He grew to be a man of prompt action in circumstances of certain kinds; but generally his impulse was slow and not very sure.  Taste and the minor sensibilities were a little deficient in him.  As a lady once candidly explained to him, he was not ready with little gracious acts.  But rare occasions, such as can arouse a passionate sense of justice, would kindle his slow, kind nature with a sudden fire.  The total amount of his schooling, at the several brief periods for which there happened to have been a school accessible and facility to get to it, was afterwards computed by himself at something under twelve months.  With this slight help distributed over the years from his eighth to his fifteenth birthday he taught himself to read, write, and do sums.  The stories of the effort and painful shifts, by which great men accomplish this initial labour almost unhelped, have in all cases the same pathos, and have a certain sameness in detail.  Having learnt to read he had the following books within his reach: the Bible, \"Aesop's Fables,\" \"Robinson Crusoe,\" the \"Pilgrim's Progress,\" a \"History of the United States,\" and Weems' \"Life of Washington.\"  Later on the fancy took him to learn the laws of his State, and he obtained the \"Laws of Indiana.\"  These books he did read, and read again, and pondered, not with any dreamy or purely intellectual interest, but like one who desires the weapon of learning for practical ends, and desires also to have patterns of what life should be.  As already said, his service as a labourer could be considerable, and when something stirred his ambition to do a task quickly his energy could be prodigious.  But \"bone idle is what I called him,\" was the verdict long after of one, perhaps too critical, employer.  \"I found him,\" he said, \"cocked up on a haystack with a book.  'What are you reading?' I said.  'I'm not reading, I'm studying,' says he.  'What are you studying?' says I. 'Law,' says he, as proud as Cicero.  'Great God Almighty!' said I.\" The boy's correction, \"studying\" for \"reading,\" was impertinent, but probably sound.  To be equally sound, we must reckon among his educational facilities the abundant stories which came his way in a community which, however unlettered, was certainly not dull-spirited; the occasional newspaper; the rare lectures or political meetings; the much more frequent religious meetings, with preachers who taught a grim doctrine, but who preached with vigour and sometimes with the deepest sincerity; the hymns often of great emotional power over a simple congregation--Cowper's \"There is a fountain filled with blood,\" is one recorded favourite among them; the songs, far other than hymns, which Dennis Hanks and his other mates would pick up or compose; and the practice in rhetoric and the art of exposition, which he unblushingly afforded himself before audiences of fellow labourers who welcomed the jest and the excuse for stopping work.  The achievement of the self-taught man remains wonderful, but, if he surmounts his difficulties at all, some of his limitations may turn to sheer advantage.  There is some advantage merely in being driven to make the most of few books; great advantage in having one's choice restricted by circumstances to good books; great advantage too in the consciousness of untrained faculty which leaves a man capable in mature life of deliberately undertaking mental discipline.  Along with the legends and authentic records of his self-training, signs of an ambition which showed itself early and which was from the first a clean and a high ambition, there are also other legends showing Lincoln as a naughty boy among naughty boys.  The selection here made from these lacks refinement, and the reader must note that this was literally a big, naughty boy, not a man who had grown stiff in coarseness and ill-nature.  First it must be recalled that Abraham bore a grudge against the Grigsbys, an honourable grudge in its origin and perhaps the only grudge he ever bore.  There had arisen from this a combat, of which the details might displease the fastidious, but which was noble in so far that Abraham rescued a weaker combatant who was over-matched.  But there ensued something more displeasing, a series of lampoons by Abraham, in prose and a kind of verse.  These were gross and silly enough, though probably to the taste of the public which he then addressed, but it is the sequel that matters.  In a work called \"The First Chronicles of Reuben,\" it is related how Reuben and Josiah, the sons of Reuben Grigsby the elder, took to themselves wives on the same day.  By local custom the bridal feast took place and the two young couples began their married careers under the roof of the bridegrooms' father.  Moreover, it was the custom that, at a certain stage in the celebrations, the brides should be escorted to their chambers by hired attendants who shortly after conducted the bridegrooms thither.  On this occasion some sense of mischief afoot disturbed the heart of Mrs. Reuben Grigsby the elder, and, hastening upstairs, just after the attendants had returned, she cried out in a loud voice and to the great consternation of all concerned, \"Why, Reuben, you're in bed with the wrong wife!\"  The historian who, to the manifest annoyance of Lincoln's other biographers, has preserved this and much other priceless information, infers that Abraham, who was not invited to the feast, had plotted this domestic catastrophe and won over the attendants to his evil purpose.  This is not a certain inference, nor is it absolutely beyond doubt that the event recorded in \"The First Chronicles of Reuben\" ever happened at all.  What is certain is that these Chronicles themselves, composed in what purports to be the style of Scripture, were circulated for the joint edification of the proud race of Grigsby and of their envious neighbours in the handwriting of Abraham Lincoln, then between seventeen and eighteen. Not without reason does an earlier manuscript of the same author conclude, after several correct exercises in compound subtraction, with the distich:--    \"Abraham Lincoln, his hand and pen,   He will be good, but God knows when.\"   Not to be too solemn about a tale which has here been told for the whimsical fancy of its unseemliness and because it is probably the worst that there is to tell, we may here look forward and face the well-known fact that the unseemliness in talk of rough, rustic boys flavoured the great President's conversation through life.  It is well to be plain about this.  Lincoln was quite without any elegant and sentimental dissoluteness, such as can be attractively portrayed.  His life was austere and seems to have been so from the start.  He had that shy reverence for womanhood which is sometimes acquired as easily in rough as in polished surroundings and often quite as steadily maintained.  The testimony of his early companions, along with some fragments of the boy's feeble but sincere attempts at verse, shows that he acquired it young.  But a large part of the stories and pithy sayings for which he was famous wherever he went, but of which when their setting is lost it is impossible to recover the enjoyment, were undeniably coarse, and naturally enough"]]]
