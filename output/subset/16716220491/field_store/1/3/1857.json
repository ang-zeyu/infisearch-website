Aw've a little tale to tell yo,--    One 'at ne'er grows stale wi' tellin,-- It's abaat One who to save yo,    Here amang men made His dwellin. Riches moor nor yo can fancy,--    Moor nor all this world has in it,-- He gave up becoss He loved yo,    An He's lovin yo this minnit. All His power, pomp and glory,    Which to think on must bewilder,-- All He left,--an what for think yo?    Just for love ov little childer. In a common, lowly stable    He wor laid, an th' stars wor twinklin, As if angel's 'een wor peepin    On His face 'at th' dew wor sprinklin. An one star, like a big lantern,    Shepherds who ther flocks wor keepin, Saw, an foller'd till it rested    Just aboon whear He wor sleepin. Then strange music an sweet voices    Seem'd to sing reight aght o' Heaven, \"Unto us a child is born!    Unto us a son is given!\" Then coom wise men thro strange nations,--    Young men an men old an hoary,-- An they all knelt daan befoor Him,    An araand Him shone a glory. Then a King thowt he wod kill Him,    Tho he reckoned net to mind Him, But they went to a strange country,    Whear this bad King couldn't find Him. An He grew up strong and sturdy,    An He sooin began His praichin, An big craads stood raand to listen,    An they wondered at His taichin. Then some sed bad things abaat Him,    Called Him names, laft at an jeered Him;-- Sed He wor a base imposter,    For they hated, yet they feeard Him. Some believed in His glad tidins,--    Saw Him cure men ov ther blindness,-- Saw Him make once-deead fowk livin,    Saw Him full o' love an kindness. Wicked men at last waylaid Him,    Drag'd Him off to jail and tried Him, Tho noa fault they could find in Him,    Yet they cursed an crucified Him. Nubdy knows ha mich He suffered;    But His work on earth wor ended:-- From the grave whear they had laid Him,    Into Heaven He ascended. Love like His may well bewilder,--    Sinners weel may bow befoor Him;-- Nah He waits for th' little childer,    Up in Heaven whear saints adore Him. Think when sittin raand yor hearthstun,    An the Kursmiss bells are ringing, Ha He lived an died at yo may    Join those angels in ther singin.    Words ov Kindness.   'Tis strange 'at fowk will be sich fooils    To mak life net worth livin', Fermentin' rows, creatin' mooils,    Detractin' an' deceivin'. To fratch an' worry day an' neet,    Is sewerly wilful blindness, When weel we know ther's nowt as sweet,    As a few words spoke i' kindness.  Ther is noa heart withaat its grief,    The gayest have some sadness; But oft a kind word brings relief,    An' sheds a ray ov gladness. We ought to think of others moor,    Nor ov ther pains be mindless; We may bring joy to monny a door    Wi' a few words spoke i' kindness.  A peevish spaik, a bitin' jest,    'At may be thowtless spokken, May be like keen edged dagger prest    Throo some heart nearly brokken. Then let love be awr rule o' life,    This world's cares we shall find less; For nowt can put an end to strife,    Like a few words spoke i' kindness.    A Brussen Bubble.   Bet wor a stirrin, strappin lass,    Shoo lived near Woodus Moor;-- An varry keen shoo wor for brass,    Tho little wor her stoor. Shoo'd wed for love--and as luck let,    It proved a lucky hit; A finer chap yo've seldom met,    Or one wi better wit.  His name awm net inclined to tell,    But he'd been kursend John; An he wor rayther praad hissel,    An anxious to get on. At neet they'd sit an tawk, an plan,    Some way to mend ther state; \"What one chap's done another can,\"    Sed Bet, \"let's get agate.\"  \"This morn wol darnin socks for thee    This thowt coom i' mi nop, An do't we will if tha'll agree;--    Let's start a little shop. We'll sell all sooarts o' useful things    'At ivverybody needs; Like scaarin-stooan, an tape an pins,    An buttons, sooap, an threeds.  An spice for th' childer,--castor oil,    An traitle drink, an pies, An kinlin wood, an maybe coil,    Fresh yeast an hooks an eyes. Corn plaisters, Bristol brick, an clay,    Puttates, rewbub an salt; An if that can't be made to pay,    It willn't be my fault.\"  \"Th' idea's a gooid en,\" John replied,    \"We should ha done 't befoor; Aw raillee think at if its tried,    We'st neer luk back noa moor. But whear's th' stock commin throo, mi lass?    That's moor nor aw can tell; Fowk willn't come an spend ther brass,    Unless yo've stuff to sell.\"  \"Why, wodn't th' maister lend a hand?    Tha knows he's fond o' me; A five paand nooat wod do it grand--    Awd ax if aw wor thee.\" An John did ax, an strange to say    He gat it thear an then; An Bet wor ne'er i' sich a way--    Fairly besides hersen.  Soa th' haase wor turned into a shop,    An praad they wor,--an Bet Sed to hersen--\"It luks tip top,    Aw'st be a lady yet.\" An th' naybors coom throo far an near,    To buy a thing or two, What they'd paid tuppence for,--why, here    Bet made three awpence do.  When John coom home at neet, his wife    Wor soa uncommon thrang, At th' furst time in his wedded life,    His drinkin time coom wrang. He did his best to seem content,    Till shuttin up time coom; \"Why, lass, he said, \"thar't fairly spent,    Tha's oppen'd wi a boom.\"  An ivvery day, to th' end o'th' wick    Browt customers enuff; But th' stock wor lukkin varry sick,    For shoo'd sell'd all her stuff. But then, shoo'd bowt a new silk gaon,    An John a silk top hat, An th' nicest easy chair ith' taan,    An bits o' this an that.  An th' upshot wor, shoo'd spent all th' brass,    An shoo'd nowt left to sell; An what John sed,--aw'll let that pass    For 'tisn't fit to tell. Soa th' business brust, but Bet declares,    'Twor nobbut want o' thowt, For shoo'd sooin ha made a fortun,    If th' stock had cost 'em nowt.    Th' Little Stranger.   Little bonny, bonny babby! How tha stares, an' weel tha may, For its but an haar or hardly Sin' tha furst saw th' leet o' day.  A'a tha little knows, young moppet, Ha awst have to tew for thee; But may be when forced to drop it, 'At tha'll do a bit for me.  Are ta maddled mun amang it? Does ta wonder what aw mean? Aw should think tha does, but dang it, Where's ta been to leearn to scream?  That's noa sooart o' mewsic, bless thi, Dunnot peawt thi lip like that; Mun, aw hardly dar to nurse thi, Feared awst hurt thi, little brat.  Come, aw'll tak thi to thi mother, Shoo's more used to sich nor me, Hands like mine worn't made to bother Wi sich ginger-breead as thee.  Innocent an' helpless craytur, All soa pure an' undefiled, If ther's ought belangs to heaven, Lives o'th' earth, it is a child.  An' its hard to think 'at someday, If tha'rt spared to weather throo, 'At tha'll be a man, an' someway Have to feight life's battles too.  Kings an' Queens, an' lords an' ladies, Once wor nowt noa moor to see, An' th' warst wretch at hung o'th' gallows, Once wor born as pure as thee.  An' what tha at last may come to, God aboon us all can tell; But aw hope 'at tha'll be lucky, Even tho aw fail mysel.  Do aw ooin thi? its a pity, Hush! nah prathi dunnot freat; Goa an' snoozle to thi titty, Tha'rt too young for trouble yet.    Th' Traitle Sop.   Once in a little country taan    A grocer kept a shop, And sell'd amang his other things,    Prime traitle-drink and pop;  Teah, coffee, currans, spenish juice,    Soft soap an' paader blue, Presarves an' pickles, cinnamon,    Allspice an' pepper too.  An' hoasts o' other sooarts o' stuff    To sell to sich as came, As figs, an' raisens, salt an' spice,    Too numerous to name.  One summer's day a waggon stood    Just opposite his door; An' th' childer all gaped raand as if    They'd ne'er seen one afoor.  An' in it wor a traitle cask,    It wor a wopper too, To get it aght they all wor fast    Which iver way to do.  But wol they stood an' parley'd thear,    Th' horse gave a sudden chuck, An' aght it flew, an' bursting threw    All th' traitle into th' muck.  Then th' childer laff'd an' clapp'd their hands,    To them it seem'd rare fun; But th' grocer ommost lost his wits    When he saw th' traitle run.  He stamp'd an' raved, an' then declared    He wodn't pay a meg! An' th' carter vow'd until he did    He wodn't stir a peg.  He said he'd done his business reight,--    He'd brought it up to th' door, An' thear it wor, an' noa fair chap    Wod want him to do moor.  But wol they stamped, an' raved, an' swore,    An' vented aght ther spleen, Th' childer wor thrang enough, you're sure,    All plaisterd up to th' een.  A neighbor chap saw th' state o' things,    An' pitied ther distress, An' begg'd em not to be soa sour    Abaht soa sweet a mess;  \"An' tha'd be sour,\" th' owd grocer sed,    \"If th' job wor thine owd lad, An' somdy wanted thee to pay    For what tha'd niver had.\"  \"Th' fault isn't mine,\" said th' cart driver,    \"My duty's done I hope? I've brought him traitle, thear it is,    An' he mun sam it up.\"  Soa th' neighbor left em to thersen,    He'd nowt noa moor to say, But went to guard what ther wor left,    An' send th' young brood away.  This didn't suit th' young lads a bit,--    They didn't mean to stop, They felt detarmin'd that they'd get    Another traitle sop.  They tried all ways but th' chap stood firm,    They couldn't get a lick, An' some o'th' boldest gate a taste    O'th neighbor's walkin stick.  At last one said, \"I know a plan    If we can scheme to do it, We'll knock one daan bang into th' dolt,    An' let him roll reight throo it;\"  \"Agreed! agreed!\" they all replied,    \"An here comes little Jack, He's foorced to pass cloise up this side,    We'll do it in a crack.\"  Poor Jack wor rayther short, an' came    Just like a suckin duck; He little dream'd at th' sweets o' life    Wod ivver be his luck.  But daan they shoved him, an' he roll'd    Heead first bang into th' mess, An' aght he coom a woeful seet,    As yo may easy guess.  They marched him off i' famous glee,    All stickified an' clammy, Then licked him clean"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19470"],["title","Yorkshire Lyrics (#2)"],["body","' sent him hooam    To get lick'd by his mammy.  Then th' cartdriver an th' grocer came,    Booath in a dreadful flutter, To save some, but they came too lat,    It all wor lost ith gutter:  It towt a lesson to em booath    Befoor that job wor ended, To try (at stead o' falling aght)    If owt went wrang to mend it.  For wol fowk rave abaht ther loss,    Some sharper's sure to pop, An' aght o' ther misfortunes    They'll contrive to get a sop.    Once agean Welcome.   Once agean welcome! oh, what is ther grander, When years have rolled by sin' yo left an old friend? An what cheers yor heart, when yo far away wander, As mich as the thowts ov a welcome at th' end? Yo may goa an be lucky, an win lots o' riches; Yo may gain fresh acquaintance as onward yo rooam; But tho' wealth may be temptin, an honor bewitches, Yet they're nowt when compared to a welcome back hooam.  Pray, who hasn't felt as they've sat sad an lonely, They'd give all they possessed for the wings ov a dove, To fly far away, just to catch a seet only Ov th' friends o' ther childhood, the friends 'at they love. Hope may fill the breast when some old spot we're leavin, Bright prospects may lure us throo th' dear land away, But it's joy o' returnin at sets one's breast heavin, It's th' hopes ov a welcome back maks us feel gay.  Long miles yo may trudge ovver moor, heath, or mire, Till yor legs seem to totter, an th' stummack feels faint; But yor thowts still will dwell o' that breet cottage fire, Till yo feel quite refreshed bi th' fancies yo paint. An when yo draw nearer, an ovver th' old palins Yo see smilin faces 'at welcome yo back, Ther's an end to being weary! away wi complainin's! Yo leeave all yor troubles behind on yor track.  Then if ther's sich joy in a welcome receivin, Let us ivvery one try sich a pleasure to gain; An bi soothin' fowk's cares, an ther sorrows relievin, Let us bind em all to us, wi' friendship's strong chain. Let us love an be loved! let's be kind an forgivin, An then if fate forces us far from awr hooam, We shall still throughout life have the joy o' receivin A tear when we part, an a smile when we come.    Still true to Nell.   Th' sun wor settin,--red an gold,    Wi splendor paintin th' west, An purplin tints throo th' valley roll'd,    As daan he sank to rest. Yet dayleet lingered looath to leeav    A world soa sweet an fair, Wol silent burds a pathway cleave,    Throo th' still an slumb'rin air.  Aw stroll'd along a country rooad,    Hedged in wi thorn an vine; Which wild flower scents an shadows broad,    Converted to a shrine. As twileet's deeper curtains fell    Aw sat mi daan an sighed; Mi thowts went back to th' time when Nell,    Had rambled bi mi side.  Aw seemed to hear her voice agean,    Soft whisperin i' mi ear, Recallin things 'at once had been,    When th' futur all wor clear. When love,--pure, honest, youthful love    Had left us nowt to crave; An fancies full ov bliss we wove;--    Alas! Nell's in her grave.  Oh, Nell! I' that fair hooam ov thine,    Whear all is breet an pure,--- Say,--is ther room for love like mine?    Can earthborn love endure? Do angels' hearts past vows renew,    To mortals here who dwell? It must be soa;--if my heart's true,    Aw cannot daat thee, Nell.  It's weel we cannot see beyond    That curtain Deeath lets fall; Lest cheerin hooaps, an longins fond,    Should be denied us all. Better to live i' hooap nor fear,--    'Tis Mercy plan'd it soa; For if my Nelly isn't thear,    Aw shouldn't care to goa.    Bide thi Time.   Bide thi time! it's sure to come,    Tho' it may seem tardy,-- Thine's a better fate nor some: If tha's but a humble home,    Yet thart strong an hardy; Then cheer up an ne'er repine, Be content, an bide thi time.  Bide thi time! if fortun's blind,    Rail not at her givin; If tha thinks shoo's ovver kind To thi neighbor, nivver mind,    If tha gets a livin; Woll thi life is in its prime, Be content, an bide thi time.  Bide thi time! for ther's a endin    To a loin, haivver long: Things at th' warst mun start o' mendin; Ther's noa wind but what's befriendin    One or other, tho' its strong: Remember, poverty's noa crime-- Be content, an bide thi time.  Bide thi time! tho none are near thee    To stretch out a helpin hand; Let noa darken'd prospect fear thee, Ther's a promise yet should cheer thee    As tha nears a breeter land: Tho thi rooad is hard to climb, Be content, an bide thi time.  Bide thi time! \"I will not leave thee    Nor forsake thee,\" He hath said. Let not worldly smiles deceive thee, Trust in Him--He will relieve thee--    He that gives thy daily bread: Fill'd with faith and love sublime, Still contented, bide thi time.    A Cold Dooas.   One neet aw went hooam, what time aw can't tell, But it must ha been lat, for awd th' street to mysel. Furst one clock, then t'other, kept ringin aght chimes, Aw wor gaumless, a chap will get gaumless sometimes. Thinks aw--tha'll drop in for't to-neet lad, tha will! But aw oppen'd th' haase door an aw heeard all wor still; Soa aw ventured o' tip toe to creep up to bed, Thinkin th' less aw disturbed her an th' less wod be sed. When awd just getten ready to bob under th' clooas, Aw bethowt me aw hadn't barred th' gate an lockt th' doors; Soa daan stairs aw crept ommost holdin mi breeath, An ivverything raand mi wor silent as deeath. When aw stept aght oth door summat must ha been wrang, For it shut ov itsen wi a terrible bang; It wor lucky aw cleared it withaat gettin hurt, But still, aw wor lockt aght o' door i' mi shirt. Thinks aw its noa use to be feared ov a din, Awst be foorced to rouse Betty to let me get in. An to mend matters snow wor beginnin to fall, An a linen shirt makes but a poor overall. Aw knockt at first pratly, for fear ov a row, But her snooarin aw heeard plain enuff daan below. Mi flesh wor i' gooise-lumps, mi feet wor like ice, To be frozzen to deeath, thinks aw, willn't be nice; Soa as knockin wor useless aw started to bray, Till at last one oth pannels began to give way. All th' neighbors ther heeads aght oth windows did pop, But aw couldn't wake Betty, shoo slept like a top. At last a poleeceman coom raand wi his lamp, An he spied mi an thowt mi some murderin scamp; Aw tried to explain, but he wodn't give heed, For he wanted a job like all th' rest ov his breed. He tuk me to th' lock-up, an thear made a charge, At aw wor a lunatic rooamin at large. In a cell aw wor put, whear aw fan other three, 'Twor a small _cell_ for four, but a big _sell_ for me; An shiv'rin an shudd'rin an pairt druffen sick, That neet seem'd to me twice as long as a wick. Next mornin they dragg'd me to th' cooart-haase to tell What it meant, an to give an accaant o' misel; An they fined me five shillin, but ha could aw pay, When mi brass wor ith pockets oth clooas far away? Then they sent Betty word, an shoo coom, for it seems Shoo wor up i' gooid time, for shoo'd had ugly dreeams; An shoo browt me mi clooas, an shoo set me all streight, But her pity wor nobbut, \"It just sarves thee reight.\" Sin then yo've noa nooation what awve to endure, For aw gate sich a cold 'at noa phisic can cure; An if aw complain Betty says i' quicksticks, \"Tha sees what tha gets wi thi wrang-headed tricks.\" Soa aw grin an aw bide it as weel as aw can, But awve altered mi tactics, an nah it's mi plan If mi mates ivver tempt me an get me to rooam, Aw sup pop when awm aght an sup whisky at hooam. An Betty declares it's been all for mi gooid, For awd long wanted summat to cooil mi young blooid; But this lesson it towt me awl freely confess,-- To mak sewer th' gate's made fast befoor aw undress.    A Jolly Beggar.   Aw'm as rich as a Jew, tho aw havn't a meg, But awm free as a burd, an aw shak a loise leg; Aw've noa haase, an noa barns, soa aw nivver pay rent, But still aw feel rich, for awm bless'd wi content,       Aw live, an awm jolly,       An if it is folly, Let others be wise, but aw'l follow mi bent.  Mi kitchen aw find amang th' rocks up oth moor, An at neet under th' edge ov a haystack aw snoor, An a wide spreeadin branch keeps th' cold rain off mi nop, Wol aw listen to th' stormcock at pipes up oth top;       Aw live, an awm jolly, &c.  Aw nivver fear thieves, for aw've nowt they can tak, Unless it's thease tatters at hing o' mi back; An if they prig them, they'll get suck'd do yo see, They'll be noa use to them, for they're little to me.       Aw live, an awm jolly, &c.  Fowk may turn up ther nooas as they pass me ith rooad An get aght oth gate as if fear'd ov a tooad; But aw laff i' mi sleeve, like a snail in its shell, For th' less room they tak up, ther's all th' moor for misel.       Aw live, an awm jolly, &c.  Tho philosiphers tawk, an church parsons may praich, An tell us true joy is far aght ov us raich; Yet aw nivver tak heed o' ther cant o' ther noise, For he's nowt to be fear'd on at's nowt he can loise.       Aw live, an awm jolly, &c.    Aw Wodn't for all aw Could See.   Why the dickens do some fowk keep thrustin,    As if th' world hadn't raam for us all? Wi consarn an consait they're fair brustin,    One ud think th' heavens likely to fall. They fidge an they fume an they flutter,    Like a burd catched wi lime on a tree, And they'll fratch wi ther own breead an butter:--    But aw wodn't for all aw could see.  Bless mi life! th' world could get on withaat em!    It ud have to do if they wor deead; They may be sincere but aw daat em,    If they're honest, they're wrang i' ther heead. They've all some pet doctrine, an wonder    Why fowk wi ther plans disagree, They expect yo should all knuckle under,    But aw wodn't for all aw could see.  My old woman may net be perfection,    But we're wed soa we know we've to stick; An if shoo made another selection,    Aw mightn't be th' chap at shoo'd pick. But we get on reight gradely together,    An her failins aw try net to see, Some will bend under th' weight ov a feather,    But aw wodn't for all aw could see.
