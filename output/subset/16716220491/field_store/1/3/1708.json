Twice, thrice, he made the effort to cross and returned to his place on the curb, interlacing his fingers distractedly. And yet this young fellow had pushed through barbed wire entanglements and gone across No Man's Land, without so much as a shudder in the very face of hostile fire.  He always dreaded this street corner in the mornings and was thankful when he was safe up in his beloved Temple Camp office. If he had been on crutches some grateful citizen would have helped him across, and patriotic young ladies would have paused to watch the returned hero and some one might even have removed his hat in the soldier's presence; for they did those things--for a while.  But such honors were only for those who were fortunate enough to have had a leg or an arm shot off or to have been paralyzed. For the hero who had had his nerves all shot to pieces there were no such spontaneous tributes.  And that was the way it had always been with Tom Slade. He had always made good, but somehow, the applause and the grateful tributes had gone to others. Nature had not made him prepossessing and he did not know how to talk; he was just slow and dogged and stolid, like a British tank, as I said, and just about as homely. You could hardly expect a girl to make much fuss over a young fellow who is like a British tank, when there are young fellows like shining machine guns, and soaring airplanes--to say nothing of poison gas.  And after two years of service in the thick of danger, with bombs and bullets flying all about him; after four months' detention in an enemy prison camp and six weeks of trench fever, to say nothing of frightful risks, stolidly ignored, in perilous secret missions, this young chunk of the old rock of Gibraltar had come home with his life, just because it had pleased God not to accept the proffer of it, and because Fritzie shot wild where Tom was concerned. He couldn't help coming back with his life--it wasn't his fault. It was just because he was the same old Lucky Luke, that's all.  That had been Roy Blakeley's name for him--Lucky Luke; and he had been known as Lucky Luke to all of his scout comrades.  You see it was this way: if Tom was going to win a scout award by finding a certain bird's nest in a certain tree, when he got to the place he would find that the tree had been chopped down. Once he was going to win the pathfinder's badge by trailing a burglar, and he trailed him seven miles through the woods and found that the burglar was his own good-for-nothing father. So he did not go back and claim the award. You see? Lucky Luke.  Once (oh, this happened several years before) he helped a boy in his patrol to become an Eagle Scout. It was the talk of Temple Camp how, one more merit badge (astronomy) and Will O'Connor would be an Eagle Scout and Tom Slade, leader of the Elks, would have the only Eagle Scout at Camp in his patrol. He didn't care so much about being an Eagle Scout himself, but he wanted Will O'Connor to be an Eagle Scout; he wanted to have an Eagle Scout in his patrol.  Then, just before Will O'Connor qualified for the Astronomy Badge, he went to live with his uncle in Cincinnati and the Buffalo Patrol of the Third Cincinnati Troop pretty soon had an Eagle Scout among their number, and the Cincinnati troop got its name into _Scouting_ and _Boy's Life_. Lucky Luke!  It was characteristic of Tom Slade that he did not show any disappointment at this sequel of all his striving. Much less had he any jealousy, for he did not know there was such a word in the dictionary. He just started in again to make Bert McAlpin an Eagle Scout and when he had jammed Bert through all the stunts but two, Uncle Sam deliberately went into the war and Tom started off to work on a transport. So you see how it worked out; Connie Bennett, new leader of the Elks presently had an Eagle Scout in his patrol and Tom got himself torpedoed. Mind, I don't say that Uncle Sam went into the war just to spite Tom Slade. The point is that Tom Slade didn't get anything, except that he got torpedoed.  One thing he did win for himself as a scout and that was the Gold Cross for life saving, but he didn't know how to wear it, and it was Margaret Eillson who pinned it on for him properly. I think she had a sneaking liking for Tom.  Poor Tom, sometime or other in his stumbling career he had probably gotten out of the wrong side of his bed, or perhaps he was born on a Friday. That was what Roy and the scouts always said.  And so you see, here he was back from the big scrap with nothing to show for it but a case of shell-shock, and you don't have bandages or crutches for shell-shock. There was young Lieut. Rossie Bent who worked downstairs in the bank, who had come home with two fingers missing and all of the girls had fallen at his feet and Tom had had to salute him. But there was nothing missing about Tom--except his wits and his grip on himself, sometimes.  But no one noticed this particularly, unless it was Mr. Burton and Margaret Ellison, and certainly no one made a fuss over him on account of it. Why should anybody make a hero of a young fellow just because he is not quite sure of himself in crossing the street, and because his mouth twitches? Boy scouts are both observant and patriotic, but they could not see that there was anything _missing_ about Tom. All they had noticed was that in resuming his duties at the office he had seemed to be drifting away from them--from the troop. And when he came on Friday nights, just to sit and hear Roy jolly Peewee and to enjoy their simple nonsense, they thought he was \"different since he had come back from France\"--perhaps just a little, you know, _uppish_.  It would have been a lucky thing for Tom, and for everybody concerned, if Mr. Ellsworth, scoutmaster, had been at home instead of away on a business trip; for he would have understood.  But of course, things couldn't have gone that way--not with Lucky Luke.     CHAPTER V  ABOUT SEEING A THING THROUGH   But there was one lucky thing that Tom had done, once upon a time. He had hit Pete Connegan plunk on the head with a rotten tomato.  That was before the war; oh, long, long before. It was a young war all by itself. It happened when Tom was a hoodlum and lived with his drunken father in Barrel Alley. And in that little affair Tom Slade made a stand. Filthy little hoodlum that he was, instead of running when Pete Connegan got down out of his truck and started after him, he turned and compressed his big mouth and stood there upon his two bare feet, waiting. It was Tom Slade all over--Barrel Alley or No Man's Land--_he didn't run_.  The slime of the tomato has long since been washed off Pete Connegan's face and the tomato is forgotten. But the way that Tom Slade stood there waiting--that meant something. It was worth all the rotten tomatoes in Schmitt's Grocery, where Tom had \"acquired\" that particular one.  \"Phwat are ye standin' there for?\" Pete had roared in righteous fury. Probably he thought that at least Tom might have paid him that tribute of respect of fleeing from his wrath.  \"'Cause I ain't a goin' ter run, that's why,\" Tom had said.  Strange to relate, Pete Connegan did not kill him. For a moment he stood staring at his ragged assailant and then he said, \"Be gorry, ye got some nerve, annyhow.\"  \"If I done a thing I'd see it through, I would; I ain't scared,\" Tom had answered.  \"If ye'll dance ye'll pay the fiddler, hey?\" his victim had asked in undisguised admiration....  Oh well, it was all a long time ago and the only points worth remembering about it are that Tom Slade didn't run, that he was ready to see the thing through no matter if it left him sprawling in the gutter, and that he and the burly truck driver had thereafter been good friends. Now Tom was an ex-scout and a returned soldier and Pete was janitor of the big bank building.  He was sweeping off the walk in front of the bank as Tom passed in.  \"Hello, Tommy boy,\" he said cheerily. \"How are ye these days?\"  \"I'm pretty well,\" Tom said, in the dull matter-of-fact way that he had, \"only I get mixed up sometimes and sometimes I forget.\"  \"Phwill ye evver fergit how you soaked me with the tomater?\" Pete asked, leaning on his broom.  \"It wasn't hard, because I was standing so near,\" Tom said, always anxious to belittle his own skill.  \"Yer got a mimory twinty miles long,\" Pete said, by way of discounting Tom's doubts of himself. \"I'm thinkin' ye don't go round with the scout boys enough.\"  \"I go Friday nights,\" Tom said.  \"Fer why don't ye go up ter Blakeley's?\"  \"I don't know,\" Tom said.  \"That kid is enough ter make annybody well,\" Pete said.  \"His folks are rich,\" Tom said.  That was just it. He was an odd number among these boys and he knew it. Fond of them as he had always been, and proud to be among them, he had always been different, and he knew it. It was the difference between Barrel Alley and Terrace Hill. He knew it. It had not counted for so much when he had been a boy scout with them; good scouts that they were, they had taken care of that end of it. But, you see, he had gone away a scout and come back not only a soldier, but a young man, and he could not (even in his present great need) go to Roy's house, or Grove Bronson's house, or up to the big Bennett place on just the same familiar terms as before. They thought he didn't want to when in fact he didn't know how to.  \"Phwen I hurd ye wuz in the war,\" Pete said, \"I says ter meself, I says, 'that there lad'll make a stand.' I says it ter me ould woman. I says, says I, 'phwat he starts he'll finish if he has ter clane up the whole uv France.' That's phwat I said. I says if he makes a bull he'll turrn the whole wurrld upside down to straighten things out. I got yer number all roight, Tommy. Get along witcher upstairs and take the advice of Doctor Pete Connegan--get out amongst them kids more.\"  I dare say it was good advice, but the trouble"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18949"],["title","Day of the Moron (#1)"],["body","lf?\"  \"Yes.

There'll have to be a pretty complete record of each test, in case--\"         *       *       *       *       *  The office door opened and a bulky man with a black mustache entered, beating the snow from his overcoat with a battered porkpie hat and commenting blasphemously on the weather. He advanced into the room until he saw the woman in the chair beside the desk, and then started to back out.  \"Come on in, Sid,\" Melroy told him. \"Dr. Rives, this is our general foreman, Sid Keating. Sid, Dr. Rives, the new dimwit detector. Sid's in direct charge of personnel,\" he continued, \"so you two'll be working together quite a bit.\"  \"Glad to know you, doctor,\" Keating said. Then he turned to Melroy. \"Scott, you're really going through with this, then?\" he asked. \"I'm afraid we'll have trouble, then.\"  \"Look, Sid,\" Melroy said. \"We've been all over that. Once we start work on the reactors, you and Ned Puryear and Joe Ricci and Steve Chalmers can't be everywhere at once. A cybernetic system will only do what it's been assembled to do, and if some quarter-wit assembles one of these things wrong--\" He left the sentence dangling; both men knew what he meant.  Keating shook his head. \"This union's going to bawl like a branded calf about it,\" he predicted. \"And if any of the dear sirs and brothers get washed out--\" That sentence didn't need to be completed, either.  \"We have a right,\" Melroy said, \"to discharge any worker who is, quote, of unsound mind, deficient mentality or emotional instability, unquote. It says so right in our union contract, in nice big print.\"  \"Then they'll claim the tests are wrong.\"  \"I can't see how they can do that,\" Doris Rives put in, faintly scandalized.  \"Neither can I, and they probably won't either,\" Keating told her. \"But they'll go ahead and do it. Why, Scott, they're pulling the Number One Doernberg-Giardano, tonight. By oh-eight-hundred, it ought to be cool enough to work on. Where will we hold the tests? Here?\"  \"We'll have to, unless we can get Dr. Rives security-cleared.\" Melroy turned to her. \"Were you ever security-cleared by any Government agency?\"  \"Oh, yes. I was with Armed Forces Medical, Psychiatric Division, in Indonesia in '62 and '63, and I did some work with mental fatigue cases at Tonto Basin Research Establishment in '64.\"  Melroy looked at her sharply. Keating whistled.  \"If she could get into Tonto Basin, she can get in here,\" he declared.  \"I should think so. I'll call Colonel Bradshaw, the security officer.\"  \"That way, we can test them right on the job,\" Keating was saying. \"Take them in relays. I'll talk to Ben about it, and we'll work up some kind of a schedule.\" He turned to Doris Rives. \"You'll need a wrist-Geiger, and a dosimeter. We'll furnish them,\" he told her. \"I hope they don't try to make you carry a pistol, too.\"  \"A pistol?\" For a moment, she must have thought he was using some technical-jargon term, and then it dawned on her that he wasn't. \"You mean--?\" She cocked her thumb and crooked her index finger.  \"Yeah. A rod. Roscoe. The Equalizer. We all have to.\" He half-lifted one out of his side pocket. \"We're all United States deputy marshals. They don't bother much with counterespionage, here, but they don't fool when it comes to countersabotage. Well, I'll get an order cut and posted. Be seeing you, doctor.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"You think the union will make trouble about these tests?\" she asked, after the general foreman had gone out.  \"They're sure to,\" Melroy replied. \"Here's the situation. I have about fifty of my own men, from Pittsburgh, here, but they can't work on the reactors because they don't belong to the Industrial Federation of Atomic Workers, and I can't just pay their initiation fees and union dues and get union cards for them, because admission to this union is on an annual quota basis, and this is December, and the quota's full. So I have to use them outside the reactor area, on fabrication and assembly work. And I have to hire through the union, and that's handled on a membership seniority basis, so I have to take what's thrown at me. That's why I was careful to get that clause I was quoting to Sid written into my contract.  \"Now, here's what's going to happen. Most of the men'll take the test without protest, but a few of them'll raise the roof about it. Nothing burns a moron worse than to have somebody question his fractional intelligence. The odds are that the ones that yell the loudest about taking the test will be the ones who get scrubbed out, and when the test shows that they're deficient, they won't believe it. A moron simply cannot conceive of his being anything less than perfectly intelligent, any more than a lunatic can conceive of his being less than perfectly sane. So they'll claim we're framing them, for an excuse to fire them. And the union will have to back them up, right or wrong, at least on the local level. That goes without saying. In any dispute, the employer is always wrong and the worker is always right, until proven otherwise. And that takes a lot of doing, believe me!\"  \"Well, if they're hired through the union, on a seniority basis, wouldn't they be likely to be experienced and competent workers?\" she asked.  \"Experienced, yes. That is, none of them has ever been caught doing anything downright calamitous ... yet,\" Melroy replied. \"The moron I'm afraid of can go on for years, doing routine work under supervision, and nothing'll happen. Then, some day, he does something on his own lame-brained initiative, and when he does, it's only at the whim of whatever gods there be that the result isn't a wholesale catastrophe. And people like that are the most serious threat facing our civilization today, atomic war not excepted.\"  Dr. Doris Rives lifted a delicately penciled eyebrow over that. Melroy, pausing to relight his pipe, grinned at her.  \"You think that's the old obsession talking?\" he asked. \"Could be. But look at this plant, here. It generates every kilowatt of current used between Trenton and Albany, the New York metropolitan area included. Except for a few little storage-battery or Diesel generator systems, that couldn't handle one tenth of one per cent of the barest minimum load, it's been the only source of electric current here since 1962, when the last coal-burning power plant was dismantled. Knock this plant out and you darken every house and office and factory and street in the area. You immobilize the elevators--think what that would mean in lower and midtown Manhattan alone. And the subways. And the new endless-belt conveyors that handle eighty per cent of the city's freight traffic. And the railroads--there aren't a dozen steam or Diesel locomotives left in the whole area. And the pump stations for water and gas and fuel oil. And seventy per cent of the space-heating is electric, now. Why, you can't imagine what it'd be like. It's too gigantic. But what you can imagine would be a nightmare.  \"You know, it wasn't so long ago, when every home lighted and heated itself, and every little industry was a self-contained unit, that a fool couldn't do great damage unless he inherited a throne or was placed in command of an army, and that didn't happen nearly as often as our leftist social historians would like us to think. But today, everything we depend upon is centralized, and vulnerable to blunder-damage. Even our food--remember that poisoned soft-drink horror in Chicago, in 1963; three thousand hospitalized and six hundred dead because of one man's stupid mistake at a bottling plant.\" He shook himself slightly, as though to throw off some shadow that had fallen over him, and looked at his watch. \"Sixteen hundred. How did you get here? Fly your own plane?\"  \"No; I came by T.W.A. from Pittsburgh. I have a room at the new Midtown City hotel, on Forty-seventh Street: I had my luggage sent on there from the airport and came out on the Long Island subway.\"  \"Fine. I have a room at Midtown City, myself, though I sleep here about half the time.\" He nodded toward a door on the left. \"Suppose we go in and have dinner together. This cafeteria, here, is a horrible place. It's run by a dietitian instead of a chef, and everything's so white-enamel antiseptic that I swear I smell belladonna-icthyol ointment every time I go in the place. Wait here till I change clothes.\"         *       *       *       *       *  At the Long Island plant, no one was concerned about espionage--neither the processes nor the equipment used there were secret--but the countersabotage security was fantastically thorough. Every person or scrap of material entering the reactor area was searched; the life-history of every man and woman employed there was known back to the cradle. A broad highway encircled it outside the fence, patrolled night and day by twenty General Stuart cavalry-tanks. There were a thousand soldiers, and three hundred Atomic Power Authority police, and only God knew how many F.B.I, and Central Intelligence undercover agents. Every supervisor and inspector and salaried technician was an armed United States deputy marshal. And nobody, outside the Department of Defense, knew how much radar and counter-rocket and fighter protection the place had, but the air-defense zone extended from Boston to Philadelphia and as far inland as Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.  The Long Island Nuclear Power Plant, Melroy thought, had all the invulnerability of Achilles--and no more.  The six new Doernberg-Giardano breeder-reactors clustered in a circle inside a windowless concrete building at the center of the plant. Beside their primary purpose of plutonium production, they furnished heat for the sea-water distillation and chemical extraction system, processing the water that was run through the steam boilers at the main power"]]]
