If you ask, 'When and where am I?' I can furnish a rational answer. In the temporal dimension, you are fifty years futureward of the day of your death; spatially, you are about eight thousand miles from the place of your death, in what is now the World Capitol, St. Louis.\"  Nothing in the answer made sense but the name of the city. Benson chuckled.  \"What happened; the Cardinals conquer the world? I knew they had a good team, but I didn't think it was that good.\"  \"No, no,\" Gregory told him earnestly. \"The government isn't a theocracy. At least not yet. But if The Guide keeps on insisting that only beautiful things are good and that he is uniquely qualified to define beauty, watch his rule change into just that.\"  \"I've been detecting symptoms of religious paranoia, messianic delusions, about his public statements....\" the woman began.  \"Idolatry!\" another member of the group, who wore a black coat fastened to the neck, and white neck-bands, rasped. \"Idolatry in deed, as well as in spirit!\"         *       *       *       *       *  The sense of unreality, partially dispelled, began to return. Benson dropped to the floor and stood beside the table, getting a cigarette out of his pocket and lighting it.  \"I made a joke,\" he said, putting his lighter away. \"The fact that none of you got it has done more to prove that I am fifty years in the future than anything any of you could say.\" He went on to explain who the St. Louis Cardinals were.  \"Yes; I remember! Baseball!\" Anthony exclaimed. \"There is no baseball, now. The Guide will not allow competitive sports; he says that they foster the spirit of violence....\"  The cadaverous man in the blue jacket turned to the man in the black garment of similar cut.  \"You probably know more history than any of us,\" he said, getting a cigar out of his pocket and lighting it. He lighted it by rubbing the end on the sole of his shoe. \"Suppose you tell him what the score is.\" He turned to Benson. \"You can rely on his dates and happenings; his interpretation's strictly capitalist, of course,\" he said.  Black-jacket shook his head. \"You first, Gregory,\" he said. \"Tell him how he got here, and then I'll tell him why.\"  \"I believe,\" Gregory began, \"that in your period, fiction writers made some use of the subject of time-travel. It was not, however, given serious consideration, largely because of certain alleged paradoxes involved, and because of an elementalistic and objectifying attitude toward the whole subject of time. I won't go into the mathematics and symbolic logic involved, but we have disposed of the objections; more, we have succeeded in constructing a time-machine, if you want to call it that. We prefer to call it a temporal-spatial displacement field generator.\"  \"It's really very simple,\" the woman called Paula interrupted. \"If the universe is expanding, time is a widening spiral; if contracting, a diminishing spiral; if static, a uniform spiral. The possibility of pulsation was our only worry....\"  \"That's no worry,\" Gregory reproved her. \"I showed you that the rate was too slow to have an effect on....\"  \"Oh, nonsense; you can measure something which exists within a microsecond, but where is the instrument to measure a temporal pulsation that may require years...? You haven't come to that yet.\"  \"Be quiet, both of you!\" the man with the black coat and the white bands commanded. \"While you argue about vanities, thousands are being converted to the godlessness of The Guide, and other thousands of his dupes are dying, unprepared to face their Maker!\"  \"All right, you invented a time-machine,\" Benson said. \"In civvies, I was only a high school chemistry teacher. I can tell a class of juniors the difference between H_{2}O and H_{2}SO_{4}, but the theory of time-travel is wasted on me.... Suppose you just let me ask the questions; then I'll be sure of finding out what I don't know. For instance, who won the war I was fighting in, before you grabbed me and brought me here? The Commies?\"  \"No, the United Nations,\" Anthony told him. \"At least, they were the least exhausted when both sides decided to quit.\"  \"Then what's this dictatorship.... The Guide? Extreme Rightist?\"  \"Walter, you'd better tell him,\" Gregory said.         *       *       *       *       *  \"We damn near lost the war,\" the man in the black jacket and striped trousers said, \"but for once, we won the peace. The Soviet Bloc was broken up--India, China, Indonesia, Mongolia, Russia, the Ukraine, all the Satellite States. Most of them turned into little dictatorships, like the Latin American countries after the liberation from Spain, but they were personal, non-ideological, generally benevolent, dictatorships, the kind that can grow into democracies, if they're given time.\"  \"Capitalistic dictatorships, he means,\" the cadaverous man in the blue jacket explained.  \"Be quiet, Carl,\" Anthony told him. \"Let's not confuse this with any class-struggle stuff.\"  \"Actually, the United Nations rules the world,\" Walter continued. \"What goes on in the Ukraine or Latvia or Manchuria is about analogous to what went on under the old United States government in, let's say, Tammany-ruled New York. But here's the catch. The UN is ruled absolutely by one man.\"  \"How could that happen? In my time, the UN had its functions so subdivided and compartmented that it couldn't even run a war properly. Our army commanders were making war by systematic disobedience.\"  \"The charter was changed shortly after ... er, that is, after....\" Walter was fumbling for words.  \"After my death.\" Benson finished politely. \"Go on. Even with a changed charter, how did one man get all the powers into his hands?\"  \"By sorcery!\" black-coat-and-white-bands fairly shouted. \"By the help of his master, Satan!\"  \"You know, there are times when some such theory tempts me,\" Paula said.  \"He was a big moneybags,\" Carl said. \"He bribed his way in. See, New York was bombed flat. Where the old UN buildings were, it's still hot. So The Guide donated a big tract of land outside St. Louis, built these buildings--we're in the basement of one of them, right now, if you want a good laugh--and before long, he had the whole organization eating out of his hand. They just voted him into power, and the world into slavery.\"  Benson looked around at the others, who were nodding in varying degrees of agreement.  \"Substantially, that's it. He managed to convince everybody of his altruism, integrity and wisdom,\" Walter said. \"It was almost blasphemous to say anything against him. I really don't understand how it happened....\"  \"Well, what's he been doing with his power?\" Benson asked. \"Wise things, or stupid ones?\"  \"I could be general, and say that he has deprived all of us of our political and other liberties. It is best to be specific,\" Anthony said. \"Gregory?\"  \"My own field--dimensional physics--hasn't been interfered with much, yet. It's different in other fields. For instance, all research in sonics has been arbitrarily stopped. So has a great deal of work in organic and synthetic chemistry. Psychology is a madhouse of ... what was the old word, licentiousness? No, lysenkoism. Medicine and surgery--well, there's a huge program of compulsory sterilization, and another one of eugenic marriage-control. And infants who don't conform to certain physical standards don't survive. Neither do people who have disfiguring accidents beyond the power of plastic surgery.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Paula spoke next. \"My field is child welfare. Well, I'm going to show you an audio-visual of an interesting ceremony in a Hindu village, derived from the ancient custom of the suttee. It is the Hindu method of conforming to The Guide's demand that only beautiful children be allowed to grow to maturity.\"  The film was mercifully brief. Even in spite of the drums and gongs, and the chanting of the crowd, Benson found out how loudly a newborn infant can scream in a fire. The others looked as though they were going to be sick; he doubted if he looked much better.  \"Of course, we are a more practical and mechanical-minded people, here and in Europe,\" Paula added, holding down her gorge by main strength. \"We have lethal-gas chambers that even Hitler would have envied.\"  \"I am a musician,\" Anthony said. \"A composer. If Gregory thinks that the sciences are controlled, he should try to write even the simplest piece of music. The extent of censorship and control over all the arts, and especially music, is incredible.\" He coughed slightly. \"And I have another motive, a more selfish one. I am approaching the compulsory retirement age; I will soon be invited to go to one of the Havens. Even though these Havens are located in the most barren places, they are beauty-spots, verdant beyond belief. It is of only passing interest that, while large numbers of the aged go there yearly, their populations remain constant, and, to judge from the quantities of supplies shipped to them, extremely small.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"They call me Samuel, in this organization,\" the man in the long black coat said. \"Whoever gave me that alias must have chosen it because I am here in an effort to live up to it. Although I am ordained by no church, I fight for all of them. The plain fact is that this man we call The Guide is really the Antichrist!\"  \"Well, I haven't quite so lofty a motive, but it's good enough to make me willing to finance this project,\" Walter said. \"It's very simple. The Guide won't let people make money, and if they do, he taxes it away from them. And he has laws to prohibit inheritance; what little you can accumulate, you can't pass on to your children.\"  \"I put up a lot of the money, too, don't forget,\" Carl told him. \"Or the Union did; I'm a poor man, myself.\" He was smoking an excellent cigar, for a poor man, and his clothes could have come from the same tailor as Walter's. \"Look, we got"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18641"],["title","Hunter Patrol (#2)"],["body"," real Union--the Union of all unions. Every working man in North America, Europe, Australia and South Africa belongs to it. And The Guide has us all hog-tied.\"  \"He won't let you strike,\" Benson chuckled.  \"That's right. And what can we do? Why, we can't even make our closed-shop contracts stick. And as far as getting anything like a pay-raise....\"  \"Good thing. Another pay-raise in some of my companies would bankrupt them, the way The Guide has us under his thumb....\" Walter began, but he was cut off.  \"Well! It seems as though this Guide has done some good, if he's made you two realize that you're both on the same side, and that what hurts one hurts both,\" Benson said. \"When I shipped out for Turkey in '77, neither Labor nor Management had learned that.\" He looked from one to another of them. \"The Guide must have a really good bodyguard, with all the enemies he's made.\"  Gregory shook his head. \"He lives virtually alone, in a very small house on the UN Capitol grounds. In fact, except for a small police-force, armed only with non-lethal stun-guns, your profession of arms is non-existent.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"I've been guessing what you want me to do,\" Benson said. \"You want this Guide bumped off. But why can't any of you do it? Or, if it's too risky, at least somebody from your own time? Why me?\"  \"We can't. Everybody in the world today is conditioned against violence, especially the taking of human life,\" Anthony told him.  \"Now, wait a moment!\" This time, he was using the voice he would have employed in chiding a couple of Anatolian peasant partisans who were field-stripping a machine gun the wrong way. \"Those babies in that film you showed me weren't dying of old age....\"  \"That is not violence,\" Paula said bitterly. \"That is humane beneficence. Ugly people would be unhappy, and would make others unhappy, in a world where everybody else is beautiful.\"  \"And all these oppressive and tyrannical laws,\" Benson continued. \"How does he enforce them, without violence, actual or threatened?\"  Samuel started to say something about the Power of the Evil One; Paula, ignoring him, said:  \"I really don't know; he just does it. Mass hypnotism of some sort. I know music has something to do with it, because there is always music, everywhere. This laboratory, for instance, was secretly soundproofed; we couldn't have worked here, otherwise.\"  \"All right. I can see that you'd need somebody from the past, preferably a soldier, whose conditioning has been in favor rather than against violence. I'm not the only one you snatched, I take it?\"  \"No. We've been using that machine to pick up men from battlefields all over the world and all over history,\" Gregory said. \"Until now, none of them could adjust.... Uggh!\" He shuddered, looking even sicker than when the film was being shown.  \"He's thinking,\" Walter said, \"about a French officer from Waterloo who blew out his brains with a pocket-pistol on that table, and an English archer from Agincourt who ran amok with a dagger in here, and a trooper of the Seventh Cavalry from the Custer Massacre.\"  Gregory managed to overcome his revulsion. \"You see, we were forced to take our subjects largely at random with regard to individual characteristics, mental attitudes, adaptability, et cetera.\" As long as he stuck to high order abstractions, he could control himself. \"Aside from their professional lack of repugnance for violence, we took soldiers from battlefields because we could select men facing immediate death, whose removal from the past would not have any effect upon the casual chain of events affecting the present.\"  A warning buzzer rasped in Benson's brain. He nodded, poker-faced.  \"I can see that,\" he agreed. \"You wouldn't dare do anything to change the past. That was always one of the favorite paradoxes in time-travel fiction.... Well, I think I have the general picture. You have a dictator who is tyrannizing you; you want to get rid of him; you can't kill him yourselves. I'm opposed to dictators, myself; that--and the Selective Service law, of course--was why I was a soldier. I have no moral or psychological taboos against killing dictators, or anybody else. Suppose I cooperate with you; what's in it for me?\"  There was a long silence. Walter and Carl looked at one another inquiringly; the others dithered helplessly. It was Carl who answered.  \"Your return to your own time and place.\"  \"And if I don't cooperate with you?\"  \"Guess when and where else we could send you,\" Walter said.  Benson dropped his cigarette and tramped it.  \"Exactly the same time and place?\" he asked.  \"Well, the structure of space-time demands....\" Paula began.  \"The spatio-temporal displacement field is capable of identifying that spot--\" Gregory pointed to a ten-foot circle in front of a bank of sleek-cabineted, dial-studded machines \"--with any set of space-time coordinates in the universe. However, to avoid disruption of the structure of space-time, we must return you to approximately the same point in space-time.\"  Benson nodded again, this time at the confirmation of his earlier suspicion. Well, while he was alive, he still had a chance.  \"All right; tell me exactly what you want me to do.\"         *       *       *       *       *  A third outbreak of bedlam, this time of relief and frantic explanation.  \"Shut up, all of you!\" For so thin a man, Carl had an astonishing voice. \"I worked this out, so let me tell it.\" He turned to Benson. \"Maybe I'm tougher than the rest of them, or maybe I'm not as deeply conditioned. For one thing, I'm tone-deaf. Well, here's the way it is. Gregory can set the machine to function automatically. You stand where he shows you, press the button he shows you, and fifteen seconds later it'll take you forward in time five seconds and about a kilometer in space, to The Guide's office. He'll be at his desk now. You'll have forty-five seconds to do the job, from the time the field collapses around you till it rebuilds. Then you'll be taken back to your own time again. The whole thing's automatic.\"  \"Can do,\" Benson agreed. \"How do I kill him?\"  \"I'm getting sick!\" Paula murmured weakly. Her face was whiter than her gown.  \"Take care of her, Samuel. Both of you'd better get out of here,\" Gregory said.  \"The Lord of Hosts is my strength, He will.... Uggggh!\" Samuel gasped.  \"Conditioning's getting him, too; we gotta be quick,\" Carl said. \"Here. This is what you'll use.\" He handed Benson a two-inch globe of black plastic. \"Take the damn thing, quick! Little button on the side; press it, and get it out of your hand fast....\" He retched. \"Limited-effect bomb; everything within two-meter circle burned to nothing; outside that, great but not unendurable heat. Shut your eyes when you throw it. Flash almost blinding.\" He dropped his cigar and turned almost green in the face. Walter had a drink poured and handed it to him. \"Uggh! Thanks, Walter.\" He downed it.  \"Peculiar sort of thing for a non-violent people to manufacture,\" Benson said, looking at the bomb and then putting it in his jacket pocket.  \"It isn't a weapon. Industrial; we use it in mining. I used plenty of them, in Walter's iron mines.\"  He nodded again. \"Where do I stand, now?\" he asked.  \"Right over here.\" Gregory placed him in front of a small panel with three buttons. \"Press the middle one, and step back into the small red circle and stand perfectly still while the field builds up and collapses. Face that way.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Benson drew his pistol and checked it; magazine full, a round in the chamber, safety on.  \"Put that horrid thing out of sight!\" Anthony gasped. \"The ... the other thing ... is what you want to use.\"  \"The bomb won't be any good if some of his guards come in before the field re-builds,\" Benson said.  \"He has no guards. He lives absolutely alone. We told you....\"  \"I know you did. You probably believed it, too. I don't. And by the way, you're sending me forward. What do you do about the fact that a time-jump seems to make me pass out?\"  \"Here. Before you press the button, swallow it.\" Gregory gave him a small blue pill.  \"Well, I guess that's all there is,\" Gregory continued. \"I hope....\" His face twitched, and he dropped to the floor with a thud. Carl and Walter came forward, dragged him away from the machine.  \"Conditioning got him. Getting me, too,\" Walter said. \"Hurry up, man!\"  Benson swallowed the pill, pressed the button and stepped back into the red circle, drawing his pistol and snapping off the safety. The blue mist closed in on him.         *       *       *       *       *  This time, however, it did not thicken into blackness. It became luminous, brightening to a dazzle and dimming again to a colored mist, and then it cleared, while Benson stood at raise pistol, as though on a target range. He was facing a big desk at twenty feet, across a thick-piled blue rug. There was a man seated at the desk, a white-haired man with a mustache and a small beard, who wore a loose coat of some glossy plum-brown fabric, and a vividly blue neck-scarf.  The pistol centered on the v-shaped blue under his chin. Deliberately, Benson squeezed, recovered from the recoil, aimed, fired, recovered, aimed, fired. Five seconds gone. The old man slumped across the desk, his arms extended. Better make a good job of it, six, seven, eight seconds; he stepped forward to the edge of the desk, call that fifteen seconds, and put the muzzle to the top of the man's head, firing again and snapping on the safety. There had been something familiar about The Guide's face, but it was too late to check on that, now. There wasn't any face left; not even much head.  A box, on the desk, caught Benson's eye, a cardboard box with an envelope, stamped _Top Secret! For the Guide Only!_ taped to it. He holstered his pistol and caught that up, stuffing it into his pocket, in obedience to an instinct to grab anything that looked like intelligence matter while in the enemy's country. Then "]]]
