She mentally accused him of trying to show off his skill with his rope when he leaned and fastened it to the rig, rode out ahead and helped drag the vehicle to shore; and it was with some resentment that she observed the ease with which he did it, and how horse and rope seemed to know instinctively their master's will, and to obey of their own accord.  In all that he had done--and it really seemed as if he did everything that needed to be done, while Dick pottered around in the way--he had not found it necessary to descend into the mud and water, to the ruin of his picturesque, fringed chaps and high-heeled boots. He had worked at ease, carelessly leaning from his leathern throne upon the big, roan horse he addressed occasionally as Redcloud. Beatrice wondered where he got the outlandish name. But, with all his imperfections, she was glad she had met him. He really was handsome, whether he knew it or not; and if he had a good opinion of himself, and overrated his actions--all the more fun for herself! Beatrice, I regret to say, was not above amusing herself with handsome young men who overrate their own charms; in fact, she had the reputation among her women acquaintances of being a most outrageous flirt.  In the very middle of these trouble-breeding meditations, Mr. Cameron looked up unexpectedly and met keenly her eyes; and for some reason--let us hope because of a guilty conscience--Beatrice grew hot and confused; an unusual experience, surely, for a girl who had been out three seasons, and has met calmly the eyes of many young men. Until now it had been the young men who grew hot and confused; it had never been herself.  Beatrice turned her shoulder toward him, and looked at Sir Redmond, who was surreptitiously fishing for certain articles beside the rear wheel, at the whispered behest of Mrs. Lansell, and was certainly a sight to behold. He was mud to his knees and to his elbows, and he had managed to plaster his hat against the wheel and to dirty his face. Altogether, he looked an abnormally large child who has been having a beautiful day of it in somebody's duck-pond; but Beatrice was nearer, at that moment, to loving him than she had been at any time during her six weeks' acquaintance with him--and that is saying much, for she had liked him from the start.  Mr. Cameron followed her glance, and his eyes did not have the laugh all to themselves; his voice joined them, and Beatrice turned upon him and frowned. It was not kind of him to laugh at a man who is proving his heart to be much larger than his vanity; Beatrice was aware of Sir Redmond's immaculateness of attire on most occasions.  “Well,” said Dick, gathering up the reins, “you've helped us out of a bad scrape, Keith. Come over and take dinner with us to-morrow night. I expect we'll be kept riding the rim-rocks, over at the Pool, this summer. Unless this sister of mine has changed a lot, she won't rest till she's been over every foot of country for forty miles around. It will just about keep our strings rode down to a whisper keeping her in sight.”  “Dear me, Richard!” said his mother. “What Jargon is this you speak?”  “That's good old Montana English, mother. You'll learn it yourself before you leave here. I've clean forgot how they used the English language at Yale, haven't you, Keith?”  “Just about,” Keith agreed. “I'm afraid we'll shock the ladies terribly, Dick. We ought to get out on a pinnacle with a good grammar and practice.”  “Well, maybe. We'll look for you to-morrow, sure. I want you to help map out a circle or two for Trix. About next week she'll want to get out and scour the range.”  “Dear me, Richard! Beatrice is not a charwoman!” This, you will understand, was from his mother; perhaps you will also understand that she spoke with the rising inflection which conveys a reproof.  When Keith Cameron left them he was laughing quietly to himself, and Beatrice's chin was set rather more than usual.    CHAPTER 3. A Tilt With Sir Redmond.   Beatrice, standing on the top of a steep, grassy slope, was engaged in the conventional pastime of enjoying the view. It was a fine view, but it was not half as good to look upon as was Beatrice herself, in her fresh white waist and brown skirt, with her brown hair fluffing softly in the breeze which would grow to a respectable wind later in the day, and with her cheeks pink from climbing.  She was up where she could see the river, a broad band of blue in the surrounding green, winding away for miles through the hills. The far bank stood a straight two hundred feet of gay-colored rock, chiseled, by time and stress of changeful weather, into fanciful turrets and towers. Above and beyond, where the green began, hundreds of moving dots told where the cattle were feeding quietly. Far away to the south, heaps of hazy blue and purple slept in the sunshine; Dick had told her those were the Highwoods. And away to the west, a jagged line of blue-white glimmered and stood upon tip-toes to touch the swimming clouds--touched them and pushed above proudly; those were the Rockies. The Bear Paws stood behind her; nearer they were--so near they lost the glamour of mysterious blue shadows, and became merely a sprawling group of huge, pine-covered hills, with ranches dotted here and there in sheltered places, with squares of fresh, dark green that spoke of growing crops.  Ten days, and the metropolitan East had faded and become as hazy and vague as the Highwoods. Ten days, and the witchery of the West leaped in her blood and held her fast in its thralldom.  A sound of scrambling behind her was immediately followed by a smothered epithet. Beatrice turned in time to see Sir Redmond pick himself up.  “These grass slopes are confounded slippery, don't you know,” he explained apologetically. “How did you manage that climb?”  “I didn't.” Beatrice smiled. “I came around the end, where the ascent is gradual; there's a good path.”  “Oh!” Sir Redmond sat down upon a rock and puffed. “I saw you up here--and a fellow doesn't think about taking a roundabout course to reach his heart's--”  “Isn't it lovely?” Beatrice made haste to inquire.  “Lovely isn't half expressive enough,” he told her. “You look--”  “The river is so very blue and dignified. I've been wondering if it has forgotten how it must have danced through those hills, away off there. When it gets down to the cities--this blue water--it will be muddy and nasty looking. The 'muddy Missouri' certainly doesn't apply here. And that farther shore is simply magnificent. I wish I might stay here forever.”  “The Lord forbid!” cried he, with considerable fervor. “There's a dear nook in old England where I hope--”  “You did get that mud off your leggings, I see,” Beatrice remarked inconsequentially. “James must have worked half the time we've been here. They certainly were in a mess the last time I saw them.”  “Bother the leggings! But I take it that's a good sign, Miss Lansell--your taking notice of such things.”  Beatrice returned to the landscape. “I wonder who originated that phrase, 'The cattle grazing on a thousand hills'? He must have stood just here when he said it.”  “Wasn't it one of your American poets? Longfellow, or--er--”  Beatrice simply looked at him a minute and said “Pshaw!”  “Well,” he retorted, “you don't know yourself who it was.”  “And to think,” Beatrice went on, ignoring the subject, “some of those grazing cows and bossy calves are mine--my very own. I never cared before, or thought much about it, till I came out and saw where they live, and Dick pointed to a cow and the sweetest little red and white calf, and said: 'That's your cow and calf, Trix.' They were dreadfully afraid of me, though--I'm afraid they didn't recognize me as their mistress. I wanted to get down and pet the calf--it had the dearest little snub nose but they bolted, and wouldn't let me near them.”  “I fancy they were not accustomed to meeting angels unawares.”  “Sir Redmond, I wish you wouldn't. You are so much nicer when you're not trying to be nice.”  “I'll act a perfect brute,” he offered eagerly, “if that will make you love me.”  “It's hardly worth trying. I think you would make a very poor sort of villain, Sir Redmond. You wouldn't even be picturesque.”  Sir Redmond looked rather floored. He was a good fighter, was Sir Redmond, but he was clumsy at repartee--or, perhaps, he was too much in earnest to fence gracefully. Just now he looked particularly foolish.  “Don't you think my brand is pretty? You know what it is, don't you?”  “I'm afraid not,” he owned. “I fancy I need a good bit of coaching in the matter of brands.”  “Yes,” agreed Beatrice, “I fancy you do. My brand is a Triangle Bar--like this.” With a sharp pointed bit of rock she drew a more or less exact diagram in the yellow soil. “There are ever so many different brands belonging to the Northern Pool; Dick pointed them out to me, but I can't remember them. But whenever you see a Triangle Bar you'll be looking at my individual property. I think it was nice of Dick to give me a brand all my own. Mr. Cameron has a pretty brand, too--a Maltese Cross. The Maltese Cross was owned at one time by President Roosevelt. Mr. Cameron bought it when he left college and went into the cattle business. He 'plays a lone hand,' as he calls it; but his cattle range with the Northern Pool, and he and Dick work together a great deal. I think he has lovely eyes, don't you?” The eyes of Beatrice were intent upon the Bear Paws when she said it--which brought her shoulder toward Sir Redmond and hid her face from him.  “I can't say I ever observed Mr. Cameron's eyes,” said Sir Redmond stiffly.  Beatrice turned back to him, and smiled demurely. When Beatrice smiled that very demure smile, of which she was capable, the weather-wise generally edged toward their cyclone-cellars. Sir Redmond was not weather-wise--he was too much in love with her--and he did not possess a cyclone cellar; he therefore suffered much at the hands"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1909"],["title","Darwin and Modern Science (#1)"],["body","CONCEPTION OF EVOLUTION ON MODERN PHILOSOPHY: H.

DATES OF THE PUBLICATION Of CHARLES DARWIN'S BOOKS AND OF THE PRINCIPAL EVENTS IN HIS LIFE  1809:  Charles Darwin born at Shrewsbury, February 12.  1817:  \"At 8 1/2 years old I went to Mr Case's school.\" (A day-school at Shrewsbury kept by the Rev G. Case, Minister of the Unitarian Chapel.)  1818:  \"I was at school at Shrewsbury under a great scholar, Dr Butler; I learnt absolutely nothing, except by amusing myself by reading and experimenting in Chemistry.\"  1825:  \"As I was doing no good at school, my father wisely took me away at a rather earlier age than usual, and sent me (Oct. 1825) to Edinburgh University with my brother, where I stayed for two years.\"  1828:  Began residence at Christ's College, Cambridge.  \"I went to Cambridge early in the year 1828, and soon became acquainted with Professor Henslow...Nothing could be more simple, cordial and unpretending than the encouragement which he afforded to all young naturalists.\"  \"During the three years which I spent at Cambridge my time was wasted, as far as the academical studies were concerned, as completely as at Edinburgh and at school.\"  \"In order to pass the B.A. Examination, it was...necessary to get up Paley's 'Evidences of Christianity,' and his 'Moral Philosophy'... The careful study of these works, without attempting to learn any part by rote, was the only part of the academical course which...was of the least use to me in the education of my mind.\"  1831:  Passed the examination for the B.A. degree in January and kept the following terms.  \"I gained a good place among the oi polloi or crowd of men who do not go in for honours.\"  \"I am very busy,...and see a great deal of Henslow, whom I do not know whether I love or respect most.\"  Dec. 27. \"Sailed from England on our circumnavigation,\" in H.M.S. \"Beagle\", a barque of 235 tons carrying 6 guns, under Capt. FitzRoy.  \"There is indeed a tide in the affairs of men.\"  1836:  Oct. 4. \"Reached Shrewsbury after absence of 5 years and 2 days.\"  \"You cannot imagine how gloriously delightful my first visit was at home; it was worth the banishment.\"  Dec. 13. Went to live at Cambridge (Fitzwilliam Street).  \"The only evil I found in Cambridge was its being too pleasant.\"  1837:  \"On my return home (in the 'Beagle') in the autumn of 1836 I immediately began to prepare my journal for publication, and then saw how many facts indicated the common descent of species... In July (1837) I opened my first note-book for facts in relation to the Origin of Species, about which I had long reflected, and never ceased working for the next twenty years... Had been greatly struck from about the month of previous March on character of South American fossils, and species on Galapagos Archipelago. These facts (especially latter), origin of all my views.\"  \"On March 7, 1837 I took lodgings in (36) Great Marlborough Street in London, and remained there for nearly two years, until I was married.\"  1838:  \"In October, that is fifteen months after I had begun my systematic enquiry, I happened to read for amusement 'Malthus on Population,' and being well prepared to appreciate the struggle for existence which everywhere goes on from long-continued observation of the habits of animals and plants, it at once struck me that under these circumstances favourable variations would tend to be preserved, and unfavourable ones to be destroyed. The result of this would be the formation of new species. Here then I had at last got a theory by which to work; but I was so anxious to avoid prejudice, that I determined not for some time to write even the briefest sketch of it.\"  1839:  Married at Maer (Staffordshire) to his first cousin Emma Wedgwood, daughter of Josiah Wedgwood.  \"I marvel at my good fortune that she, so infinitely my superior in every single moral quality, consented to be my wife. She has been my wise adviser and cheerful comforter throughout life, which without her would have been during a very long period a miserable one from ill-health. She has earned the love of every soul near her\" (Autobiography).  Dec. 31. \"Entered 12 Upper Gower street\" (now 110 Gower street, London). \"There never was so good a house for me, and I devoutly trust you (his future wife) will approve of it equally.

'Beagle'\" by Richard Owen.  1842:  \"In June 1842 I first allowed myself the satisfaction of writing a very brief abstract of my (species) theory in pencil in 35 pages; and this was enlarged during the summer of 1844 into one of 230 pages, which I had fairly copied out and still (1876) possess.\" (The first draft of \"The Origin of Species\", edited by Mr Francis Darwin, will be published this year (1909) by the Syndics of the Cambridge University Press.)

My work was of considerable use to me, when I had to discuss in the \"Origin of Species\" the principles of a natural classification. Nevertheless, I doubt whether the work was worth the consumption of so much time.\"  \"From September 1854 I devoted my whole time to arranging my huge pile of notes, to observing, and to experimenting in relation to the transmutation of species.\"  1856:  \"Early in 1856 Lyell advised me to write out my views pretty fully, and I began at once to do so on a scale three or four times as extensive as that which was afterwards followed in my 'Origin of Species'.\"  1858:  Joint paper by Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace \"On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection,\" communicated to the Linnean Society by Sir Charles Lyell and Sir Joseph Hooker.  \"I was at first very unwilling to consent (to the communication of his MS. to the Society) as I thought Mr Wallace might consider my doing so unjustifiable, for I did not then know how generous and noble was his disposition.\"  \"July 20 to Aug. 12 at Sandown (Isle of Wight) began abstract of Species book.\"  1859:  Nov. 24.
