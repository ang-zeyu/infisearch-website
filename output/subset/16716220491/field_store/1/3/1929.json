How can I doubt you love?           Vainly would you conceal the fatal wound.           Has not the fair Aricia touch'd your heart?            HIPPOLYTUS           Theramenes, I go to find my father.            THERAMENES           Will you not see the queen before you start,           My prince?            HIPPOLYTUS           That is my purpose: you can tell her.           Yes, I will see her; duty bids me do it.           But what new ill vexes her dear Oenone?              SCENE II           HIPPOLYTUS, OENONE, THERAMENES             OENONE           Alas, my lord, what grief was e'er like mine?           The queen has almost touch'd the gates of death.           Vainly close watch I keep by day and night,           E'en in my arms a secret malady           Slays her, and all her senses are disorder'd.           Weary yet restless from her couch she rises,           Pants for the outer air, but bids me see           That no one on her misery intrudes.           She comes.            HIPPOLYTUS           Enough. She shall not be disturb'd,           Nor be confronted with a face she hates.              SCENE III           PHAEDRA, OENONE             PHAEDRA           We have gone far enough. Stay, dear Oenone;           Strength fails me, and I needs must rest awhile.           My eyes are dazzled with this glaring light           So long unseen, my trembling knees refuse           Support. Ah me!            OENONE           Would Heaven that our tears           Might bring relief!            PHAEDRA           Ah, how these cumbrous gauds,           These veils oppress me! What officious hand           Has tied these knots, and gather'd o'er my brow           These clustering coils? How all conspires to add           To my distress!            OENONE           What is one moment wish'd,           The next, is irksome. Did you not just now,           Sick of inaction, bid us deck you out,           And, with your former energy recall'd,           Desire to go abroad, and see the light           Of day once more? You see it, and would fain           Be hidden from the sunshine that you sought.            PHAEDRA           Thou glorious author of a hapless race,           Whose daughter 'twas my mother's boast to be,           Who well may'st blush to see me in such plight,           For the last time I come to look on thee,           O Sun!            OENONE           What! Still are you in love with death?           Shall I ne'er see you, reconciled to life,           Forego these cruel accents of despair?            PHAEDRA           Would I were seated in the forest's shade!           When may I follow with delighted eye,           Thro' glorious dust flying in full career,           A chariot--            OENONE           Madam?            PHAEDRA           Have I lost my senses?           What said I? and where am I? Whither stray           Vain wishes? Ah! The gods have made me mad.           I blush, Oenone, and confusion covers           My face, for I have let you see too clearly           The shame of grief that, in my own despite,           O'erflows these eyes of mine.            OENONE           If you must blush,           Blush at a silence that inflames your woes.           Resisting all my care, deaf to my voice,           Will you have no compassion on yourself,           But let your life be ended in mid course?           What evil spell has drain'd its fountain dry?           Thrice have the shades of night obscured the heav'ns           Since sleep has enter'd thro' your eyes, and thrice           The dawn has chased the darkness thence, since food           Pass'd your wan lips, and you are faint and languid.           To what dread purpose is your heart inclined?           How dare you make attempts upon your life,           And so offend the gods who gave it you,           Prove false to Theseus and your marriage vows,           Ay, and betray your most unhappy children,           Bending their necks yourself beneath the yoke?           That day, be sure, which robs them of their mother,           Will give high hopes back to the stranger's son,           To that proud enemy of you and yours,           To whom an Amazon gave birth, I mean           Hippolytus--            PHAEDRA           Ye gods!            OENONE           Ah, this reproach           Moves you!            PHAEDRA           Unhappy woman, to what name           Gave your mouth utterance?            OENONE           Your wrath is just.           'Tis well that that ill-omen'd name can rouse           Such rage. Then live. Let love and duty urge           Their claims. Live, suffer not this son of Scythia,           Crushing your children 'neath his odious sway,           To rule the noble offspring of the gods,           The purest blood of Greece. Make no delay;           Each moment threatens death; quickly restore           Your shatter'd strength, while yet the torch of life           Holds out, and can be fann'd into a flame.            PHAEDRA           Too long have I endured its guilt and shame!            OENONE           Why? What remorse gnaws at your heart? What crime           Can have disturb'd you thus? Your hands are not           Polluted with the blood of innocence?            PHAEDRA           Thanks be to Heav'n, my hands are free from stain.           Would that my soul were innocent as they!            OENONE           What awful project have you then conceived,           Whereat your conscience should be still alarm'd?            PHAEDRA           Have I not said enough? Spare me the rest.           I die to save myself a full confession.            OENONE           Die then, and keep a silence so inhuman;           But seek some other hand to close your eyes.           Tho' but a spark of life remains within you,           My soul shall go before you to the Shades.           A thousand roads are always open thither;           Pain'd at your want of confidence, I'll choose           The shortest. Cruel one, when has my faith           Deceived you! Think how in my arms you lay           New born. For you, my country and my children           I have forsaken. Do you thus repay           My faithful service?            PHAEDRA           What do you expect           From words so bitter? Were I to break silence           Horror would freeze your blood.            OENONE           What can you say           To horrify me more than to behold           You die before my eyes?            PHAEDRA           When you shall know           My crime, my death will follow none the less,           But with the added stain of guilt.            OENONE           Dear Madam,           By all the tears that I have shed for you,           By these weak knees I clasp, relieve my mind           From torturing doubt.            PHAEDRA           It is your wish. Then rise.            OENONE           I hear you. Speak.            PHAEDRA           Heav'ns! How shall I begin?            OENONE           Dismiss vain fears, you wound me with distrust.            PHAEDRA           O fatal animosity of Venus!           Into what wild distractions did she cast           My mother!            OENONE           Be they blotted from remembrance,           And for all time to come buried in silence.            PHAEDRA           My sister Ariadne, by what love           Were you betray'd to death, on lonely shores           Forsaken!            OENONE           Madam, what deep-seated pain           Prompts these reproaches against all your kin?            PHAEDRA           It is the will of Venus, and I perish,           Last, most unhappy of a family           Where all were wretched.            OENONE           Do you love?            PHAEDRA           I feel           All its mad fever.            OENONE           Ah! For whom?            PHAEDRA           Hear now           The crowning horror. Yes, I love--my lips           Tremble to say his name.            OENONE           Whom?            PHAEDRA           Know you him,           Son of the Amazon, whom I've oppress'd           So long?            OENONE           Hippolytus? Great gods!            PHAEDRA           'Tis you           Have named him.            OENONE           All my blood within my veins           Seems frozen. O despair! O cursed race!           Ill-omen'd journey! Land of misery!           Why did we ever reach thy dangerous shores?            PHAEDRA           My wound is not so recent. Scarcely had I           Been bound to Theseus by the marriage yoke,           And happiness and peace seem'd well secured,           When Athens show'd me my proud enemy.           I look'd, alternately turn'd pale and blush'd           To see him, and my soul grew all distraught;           A mist obscured my vision, and my voice           Falter'd, my blood ran cold, then burn'd like fire;           Venus I felt in all my fever'd frame,           Whose fury had so many of my race           Pursued. With fervent vows I sought to shun           Her torments, built and deck'd for her a shrine,           And there, 'mid countless victims did I seek           The reason I had lost; but all for naught,           No remedy could cure the wounds of love!           In vain I offer'd incense on her altars;           When I invoked her name my heart adored           Hippolytus, before me constantly;           And when I made her altars smoke with victims,           'Twas for a god whose name I dared not utter.           I fled his presence everywhere, but found him--           O crowning horror!--in his father's features.           Against myself, at last, I raised revolt,           And stirr'd my courage up to persecute           The enemy I loved. To banish him           I wore a step--da"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1977"],["title","Phaedra (#2)"],["body","me's harsh and jealous carriage,           With ceaseless cries I clamour'd for his exile,           Till I had torn him from his father's arms.           I breathed once more, Oenone; in his absence           My days flow'd on less troubled than before,           And innocent. Submissive to my husband,           I hid my grief, and of our fatal marriage           Cherish'd the fruits. Vain caution! Cruel Fate!           Brought hither by my spouse himself, I saw           Again the enemy whom I had banish'd,           And the old wound too quickly bled afresh.           No longer is it love hid in my heart,           But Venus in her might seizing her prey.           I have conceived just terror for my crime;           I hate my life, and hold my love in horror.           Dying I wish'd to keep my fame unsullied,           And bury in the grave a guilty passion;           But I have been unable to withstand           Tears and entreaties, I have told you all;           Content, if only, as my end draws near,           You do not vex me with unjust reproaches,           Nor with vain efforts seek to snatch from death           The last faint lingering sparks of vital breath.              SCENE IV           PHAEDRA, OENONE, PANOPE             PANOPE           Fain would I hide from you tidings so sad,           But 'tis my duty, Madam, to reveal them.           The hand of death has seized your peerless husband,           And you are last to hear of this disaster.            OENONE           What say you, Panope?            PANOPE           The queen, deceived           By a vain trust in Heav'n, begs safe return           For Theseus, while Hippolytus his son           Learns of his death from vessels that are now           In port.            PHAEDRA           Ye gods!            PANOPE           Divided counsels sway           The choice of Athens; some would have the prince,           Your child, for master; others, disregarding           The laws, dare to support the stranger's son.           'Tis even said that a presumptuous faction           Would crown Aricia and the house of Pallas.           I deem'd it right to warn you of this danger.           Hippolytus already is prepared           To start, and should he show himself at Athens,           'Tis to be fear'd the fickle crowd will all           Follow his lead.            OENONE           Enough. The queen, who hears you,           By no means will neglect this timely warning.              SCENE V           PHAEDRA, OENONE             OENONE           Dear lady, I had almost ceased to urge           The wish that you should live, thinking to follow           My mistress to the tomb, from which my voice           Had fail'd to turn you; but this new misfortune           Alters the aspect of affairs, and prompts           Fresh measures. Madam, Theseus is no more,           You must supply his place. He leaves a son,           A slave, if you should die, but, if you live,           A King. On whom has he to lean but you?           No hand but yours will dry his tears. Then live           For him, or else the tears of innocence           Will move the gods, his ancestors, to wrath           Against his mother. Live, your guilt is gone,           No blame attaches to your passion now.           The King's decease has freed you from the bonds           That made the crime and horror of your love.           Hippolytus no longer need be dreaded,           Him you may see henceforth without reproach.           It may be, that, convinced of your aversion,           He means to head the rebels. Undeceive him,           Soften his callous heart, and bend his pride.           King of this fertile land, in Troezen here           His portion lies; but as he knows, the laws           Give to your son the ramparts that Minerva           Built and protects. A common enemy           Threatens you both, unite them to oppose           Aricia.            PHAEDRA           To your counsel I consent.           Yes, I will live, if life can be restored,           If my affection for a son has pow'r           To rouse my sinking heart at such a dangerous hour.     ACT II            SCENE I           ARICIA, ISMENE             ARICIA           Hippolytus request to see me here!           Hippolytus desire to bid farewell!           Is't true, Ismene? Are you not deceived?            ISMENE           This is the first result of Theseus' death.           Prepare yourself to see from every side.           Hearts turn towards you that were kept away           By Theseus. Mistress of her lot at last,           Aricia soon shall find all Greece fall low,           To do her homage.            ARICIA           'Tis not then, Ismene,           An idle tale? Am I no more a slave?           Have I no enemies?            ISMENE           The gods oppose           Your peace no longer, and the soul of Theseus           Is with your brothers.            ARICIA           Does the voice of fame           Tell how he died?            ISMENE           Rumours incredible           Are spread. Some say that, seizing a new bride,           The faithless husband by the waves was swallow'd.           Others affirm, and this report prevails,           That with Pirithous to the world below           He went, and saw the shores of dark Cocytus,           Showing himself alive to the pale ghosts;           But that he could not leave those gloomy realms,           Which whoso enters there abides for ever.            ARICIA           Shall I believe that ere his destined hour           A mortal may descend into the gulf           Of Hades? What attraction could o'ercome           Its terrors?            ISMENE           He is dead, and you alone           Doubt it. The men of Athens mourn his loss.           Troezen already hails Hippolytus           As King. And Phaedra, fearing for her son,           Asks counsel of the friends who share her trouble,           Here in this palace.            ARICIA           Will Hippolytus,           Think you, prove kinder than his sire, make light           My chains, and pity my misfortunes?            ISMENE           Yes,           I think so, Madam.            ARICIA           Ah, you know him not           Or you would never deem so hard a heart           Can pity feel, or me alone except           From the contempt in which he holds our sex.           Has he not long avoided every spot           Where we resort?            ISMENE           I know what tales are told           Of proud Hippolytus, but I have seen           Him near you, and have watch'd with curious eye           How one esteem'd so cold would bear himself.           Little did his behavior correspond           With what I look'd for; in his face confusion           Appear'd at your first glance, he could not turn           His languid eyes away, but gazed on you.           Love is a word that may offend his pride,           But what the tongue disowns, looks can betray.            ARICIA           How eagerly my heart hears what you say,           Tho' it may be delusion, dear Ismene!           Did it seem possible to you, who know me,           That I, sad sport of a relentless Fate,           Fed upon bitter tears by night and day,           Could ever taste the maddening draught of love?           The last frail offspring of a royal race,           Children of Earth, I only have survived           War's fury. Cut off in the flow'r of youth,           Mown by the sword, six brothers have I lost,           The hope of an illustrious house, whose blood           Earth drank with sorrow, near akin to his           Whom she herself produced. Since then, you know           How thro' all Greece no heart has been allow'd           To sigh for me, lest by a sister's flame           The brothers' ashes be perchance rekindled.           You know, besides, with what disdain I view'd           My conqueror's suspicions and precautions,           And how, oppos'd as I have ever been           To love, I often thank'd the King's injustice           Which happily confirm'd my inclination.           But then I never had beheld his son.           Not that, attracted merely by the eye, I           love him for his beauty and his grace,           Endowments which he owes to Nature's bounty,           Charms which he seems to know not or to scorn.           I love and prize in him riches more rare,           The virtues of his sire, without his faults.           I love, as I must own, that generous pride           Which ne'er has stoop'd beneath the amorous yoke.           Phaedra reaps little glory from a lover           So lavish of his sighs; I am too proud           To share devotion with a thousand others,           Or enter where the door is always open.           But to make one who ne'er has stoop'd before           Bend his proud neck, to pierce a heart of stone,           To bind a captive whom his chains astonish,           Who vainly 'gainst a pleasing yoke rebels,--           That piques my ardour, and I long for that.

What! Can he love? and I           Have had the happiness to bend--            ISMENE           He comes           Yourself shall hear him.              SCENE II           HIPPOLYTUS, ARICIA, ISMENE             HIPPOLYTUS           Lady, ere I go           My duty bids me tell you of your change           Of fortune. My worst fears are realized;           My sire is dead. Yes, his protracted absence           Was caused as I foreboded. Death alone,           Ending his toils, could keep him from the"]]]
