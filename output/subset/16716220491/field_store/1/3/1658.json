Some dragon flies, like this one we have picked up, always keep their wings spread out.  [Illustration]  But over there, standing on the end of that stick, is another kind.  When it rests its wings are folded together.  What a pretty one it is! Do you see it?  It is small, but so pretty.  It is bright blue and shines as though it had been polished.  Sometimes birds catch these smaller dragon flies, though birds, as a rule, are not fond of any of them.  They are so hard and their wings are so stiff I should think a bird might almost as well swallow nails.  I am sure no bird could swallow one of the big ones, wings and all!  But frogs can.  A frog will try to swallow almost anything it can catch, and it watches for the dragon flies when they come to lay their eggs in the water.  Suddenly it jumps out, and away goes poor dragon fly into that great wide frog-mouth.  [Illustration]  Now look at the legs of the dragon fly. It has six.  Every dragon fly has six legs.  They are rather short and small for so large an insect, but that is because it does not need large, strong legs.  You never saw a dragon fly dig a hole, or run, or even walk, did you?  Their legs are not arranged for walking. All six of them are directed forwards as though they were reaching out after something. And so they are--reaching out after insects.  Dragon fly catches his prey while he is flying, and he grasps the insects with his feet.  He snatches one, and then what?  Does he sit down somewhere and eat it?  Not he, he is far too hungry for that; he continues his swift flight, and as he flies he eats.  As soon as he has finished one fly or gnat, zip! he snatches another.  He has an insatiable appetite, consuming hundreds of insects in the course of a day. Nor does he confine his attention to flies and gnats and mosquitoes and such small fry. He catches what he can. A large dragon fly will even gorge himself on one of the large-sized butterflies, and one has been seen calmly chewing away at an enormous wasp!  No, indeed, Mabel, the dragon fly does not eat the wings of the butterfly, it eats only the soft body.  Probably nothing eats a butterfly, wings and all. Birds and insects sometimes catch butterflies, and you often see the bright wings lying on the ground. The wings of insects are not worth eating, and are almost always cast aside by the creatures that eat the insects.  Besides catching insects with their legs, the dragon flies cling fast to things with them, but when they wish to move they do not walk, they fly.  Yes, indeed, Frank, you are right; their legs are jointed.  That is so they can move them easily and fold them up when they want to.  They would find it as hard to get along without joints to their legs as we should.  Wouldn't we be stiff if we had no joints!  See, the legs and wings are fastened to the middle part of the body, the _thorax_, we call it.  All insects have the legs and wings attached to the thorax.  The rest of the body is the abdomen. See how long it is.  [Illustration]  It is the long abdomen that gives the dragon fly its name of spindle, I suppose.  The abdomen is jointed, and it can curl up.  All grown-up insects have a head, a thorax, and a jointed abdomen.         *       *       *       *       *  What are you looking at, Charlie?  Something moving in the bottom of the pond?  Let us get it out.  Here, we will dip it out with this cup.  What a lot of stuff!  Sticks and mud--and--what is that?  Something alive, surely.  Let us put some clean water in the cup and examine what we have found.  My! my! what a queer little thing!  What do you suppose it is?  Ah, I know now, but I do not think you could ever, ever guess, not if you tried a week.  It is a young dragon fly!  It does not look much like its shiny-winged parents.  It looks like I don't know what, with a face like--well, when you look right in front of it, like a pug dog.  Queer! Well, I should think so! What is that, Amy? Am I sure it is a dragon fly?  Yes, there is no mistake; a dragon fly one day dropped an egg in the pond, and out of it hatched--this.  [Illustration]  It will some day become a shiny-winged dragon fly and catch mosquitoes.  We will call it larva, and we will watch it a little while.  Look and see if it has a head, a thorax, and an abdomen.  Are there antennæ on its head? And has it eyes?  If you were to look at its eyes with a microscope, you would find that they are made of six-sided facets, like the eyes of the grown-up dragon fly.  They are compound eyes, but they are not as large as the eyes of the grown-up dragon fly.  How many legs has it? What are its legs fastened to?  Yes, Nellie, thorax is right.  Its six legs are fastened to its thorax. I am glad you remembered thorax.  Has it a jointed abdomen? and has it wings?  Look! did you see that?  It opened its innocent-looking face all of a sudden, just darted it out into a long-handled spoon, with hooks at the end, and hooked up that little grub.  Now it is holding the grub on the hooks in front of its mouth and eating it as greedily as if it were half starved.  [Illustration]  So that is why its face looks so queer.  It is its long under lip all folded up in front like a mask that makes it look like a pug dog.  When it pleases it darts out that lip, and any unlucky insect or snail may fall a prey to its greedy appetite.  It is said that the larvæ of some dragon flies even eat pollywogs and small fishes.  Ned wants to know if \"larvæ\" means the same as \"larva.\"  Yes, it is the plural form of the word. When we speak of only one we say \"larva\"; when we speak of more than one, instead of saying \"larvas,\" we say \"larvæ.\"  The dragon fly larvæ are terrible gluttons, and hidden under the mask are strong jaws for chewing up their prey.  Their legs are quite large and strong, too, for they crawl about the bottom of the pond or up the stalks of the plants.  They do not move about very fast, but they do shoot out that under lip very, very, _very_ fast indeed, so good-by to any little live thing in the pond that comes within reach of it.  The dragon fly larvæ do not all look alike. They are different in the different species of dragon flies, and, like the rest of us, they change as they grow older.  Yes, May, you can keep the dragon fly larvæ until they change into dragon flies.  You must supply them with fresh water and with enough to eat.  And you must put a net over the bowl or aquarium in which you keep them, otherwise as soon as they are able they will fly away.  How can they fly without wings?  Oh, but they are going to have wings. You know they are young dragon flies in spite of their strange appearance.  Be sure and feed them enough, or else they will eat each other, and that would be a pity; and be sure there are some water plants for them to hide under and crawl upon.  You can give them a little fresh fish or a tiny bit of very fresh meat, though they like best the living things they find in the bottom of the pond.  [Illustration]  When the dragon fly larva first hatches it is very small and its legs are rather long and spidery, but it eats and eats and eats,--my, how it eats!  And it grows and grows, and one day it finds its skin too tight.  A tight skin must be rather uncomfortable.  But the larva does not care much for its skin.  It merely splits it open down the back and pulls itself out.  Perhaps you think it must be yet more uncomfortable to be without a skin.  But it is not without a skin. It is covered by a new and soft one that soon hardens, and that is larger than the old one.  It wriggles out of its old skin as though it were an old coat, and leaves it clinging to the weeds in the pond.  Sometime you may find these cast-off dragon fly overcoats.  After it has shed its skin the dragon fly continues to grow. It keeps on growing until it has outgrown its new skin.  Then what do you think it does?  Yes, Charlie, that is right, it sheds this skin too.  [Illustration]  When it sheds its skin we say it moults.  It moults several times, and at last little short wings appear. At first it has no wings at all, you know.  Amy wonders how the larva breathes under water.  Ah, Master Ned, you are laughing too soon. You think insects do not have to breathe, but you are very much mistaken, sir.  Insects do have to breathe.  They would die if they could get no air to breathe.  Some of the dragon fly larvæ have an odd arrangement for breathing under water. They have a sort of syringe in the end of the body, and there are breathing pores or gills in the syringe.  The water goes in and out of this syringe, and the larva breathes as the fish does, by means of its gills.  Yes, May, its gills are in its syringe, which seems very odd,--you see the dragon fly larva breathes at its tail end instead of at its head end.  Mollie thinks it is an upside-down, inside-out sort of a creature anyway. But it knows what it is about.  Ned wants to know how it can get any air to breathe when it lives under water.  The truth is, there is always air mixed in with water, and it is this air the larva breathes when the water goes in and out of the syringe.  It uses the syringe for another purpose too. When it pleases it can shoot out the water with great force, and thus propel itself quite a distance.  By means of the syringe it can leap through the water faster than it can move by its slow-going legs.  Mollie wants to know if we can see the syringe.  No, it is inside the body.  But there is a kind of dragon fly that has a pair of gills outside, at the end of the abdomen, instead of the syringe inside.  The best I can do is to show you a picture of one. Some day we may find it in the pond.  [Illustration]  Those two feather-like parts at the tail end are gills.  Yes, John, it can propel itself through the water by rowing, as it were, with these gills.  There are some species of dragon fly larvæ that swim by moving the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18790"],["title","The Insect Folk (#2)"],["body"," of the abdomen from side to side, as a fish moves its body when it swims.  But now let us return to our funny larva that lives at the bottom of the pond. It stays down there, eating and growing and moulting, for nine or ten months or even longer; then something very wonderful happens.  It suddenly feels a great desire to get up to the top of the pond.  [Illustration]  It climbs up a weed or a stick until it is clear out of the water.  Then its skin splits down the back for the last time, and out there pulls itself, not a larva, but a weak-looking dragon fly, with soft and flabby little wings.  Now is its hour of danger, and now is the time for such birds as like the taste of young dragon flies to help themselves.  Catbirds seem to have a special fondness for these helpless insects, and have been known to eat them before the flabby little wings had grown stiff.  If the birds do not find the newly emerged dragon fly, it remains motionless an hour or so, but it does not remain unchanged.  Its wings stretch out and harden.  Bright metallic colors begin to play over them and over its body; and all at once--off it darts, away and away, glittering in the sunshine, a swift, beautiful winged creature.  Towards the end of summer you will often see dragon flies darting about in every direction.  They seem to come in swarms and I think they usually come where there are ponds or marshes, for in such places there are many gnats and mosquitoes.  Mollie wants to know why it would not be a good plan for people who live where there are many mosquitoes to raise dragon flies?  That is a very sensible idea, Mollie, and it has been tried.  Yes, indeed; some men once collected dragon fly larvæ, and took care of them until they changed into dragon flies.  Then what do you think happened?  As soon as they got their wings, away went those dragon flies,--away and away, without stopping to catch a single mosquito for the men who had taken the trouble to raise them.  The dragon flies will not stay at home.  They fly so fast and so far there is no use raising them.  They are among the swiftest and strongest of insects.  How do the larvæ get in the ponds? Frank is asking.  I will tell you what I know about it.  [Illustration]  The winged dragon flies mate, and the female then drops her eggs in the water or lays them on twigs in the water, where they hatch out into larvæ.  The dragon flies have to be very careful when they go close to the water to lay their eggs.  You all know why.  Yes, it is because the frogs are on the watch to catch them.  [Illustration]  The mother dragon fly knows the larvæ have to live in the water, and so she takes pains to put the eggs there; sometimes she even crawls down under the water on stems of plants to lay her eggs. Isn't she a wise little mother?  There are a good many species of dragon flies.  Some are large and some are small.  Some are bright and some are dull.  There are black ones and bright blue ones, or green ones with blue eyes.  Some are marked with red and yellow.  They are a very gay family.  The dragon fly family is also a very old one.  Indeed, it is one of the oldest families on earth.  Long before there were bees or butterflies or dogs or horses or human beings, there were dragon flies.  Don't you suppose that may be why the dragon fly is such a strange-looking insect?  It does not look like other insects; it is very old-fashioned, like the pine trees.  Pine trees, too, belong to a very old plant family that lived long ago, before there were oaks or maples, or other trees that shed their leaves.  Now we must go home.  Good-by, green frog, you may come back to your log now.  Good-by, pretty dragon fly people, we shall never forget you.  Good-by, pleasant pond and moss-grown log, we hope to see you often again.  [Illustration]     THE FAIRY MAY FLIES  [Illustration]   Come, children, and see! Hundreds and hundreds of them are dancing about.  What are they? Yes, May, they do make us think of the dragon flies, but they are like fairy demoiselles.  They are the May flies, fairy ships sailing in the sea of air.  See how they are tossed about.  Many have fallen to the ground, which is covered with them.  They live but a day, or sometimes only a few hours, and so they are called day flies, and also ephemeræ, which means short-lived.  They have eyes, as you can see, little round eyes, but their mouth is so tiny they cannot eat.  Strange little beings to come into the world so helpless!  How different from the strong, fierce dragon flies!  See their dainty little legs. Six, you see, and legs and wings grow out from the thorax.  Have they an abdomen?  See the long threads at the end of it, they look like slender tails. How they spread these threads out as they fly!  They have four wings, but the wings are not shaped like those of the dragon fly, and they are very much more delicate.  [Illustration: DRAGON FLY WINGS.]  [Illustration: MAY FLY WINGS.]  Yes, May, I agree with you, they look like fine lace.  The fore wings, you see, are larger than the hind ones.  Richard asks, \"Where do May flies come from? and why are they called May flies?\"  Now, Richard, one question at a time, if you please, and the last shall come first because it is easier to answer.  They are called May flies because they often come out in the month of May, though sometimes not until June, and some species are as late as July in appearing.  [Illustration]  We shall have to look into the ponds and little streams to discover where they come from.  See, John has scooped up some little speckled grubs out of the mud. Is it possible that _they_ are the larvæ of our fairy May flies? _They_ have a mouth!--see what big jaws for such little creatures.  And what do you suppose they eat?  No doubt they, too, live on animal food.  No doubt they move about in the mud and catch what they can.  You see, John had to dig them up; they like to burrow in the weeds and mud, and some of them even make tunnels of mud in which to protect their soft bodies. Their short, stout legs enable them to dig well.  Their bodies are soft, but their jaws are not. O dear, no!  [Illustration]  The grown-up May flies mate, and then the female drops her eggs on the surface of the water. When she does this a fish will very often jump up and seize her, for fish are very fond of May flies, and lucky are the May flies to escape these ravenous enemies.  The eggs are heavy and sink to the bottom, where they hatch into these queer-looking larvæ that eat and grow and shed their skin just like the dragon fly larvæ.  Those brushes along their sides are the gills they breathe with.  See the gills moving swiftly back and forth; they look as though the larva wished to swim with them, but this is not why it moves them so constantly.  The continual motion of the gills stirs up the water and keeps our larva supplied with fresh air.  Nellie is asking what gills are.  Well, gills in fishes and in such insects as have gills, and in crabs and lobsters and other creatures that live in the water, are parts that often look like fringes or flat plates.  The gills of fishes have a great many blood vessels running through them. The walls of these blood vessels are very thin, and the oxygen from the air that is in the water passes into the blood that is in the gills, and then this blood, all full of oxygen, circulates through the fish's body.  You see in fishes the blood vessels come into the gills and get the oxygen.  In insects it is different. There are air tubes running like tiny pipes all through the gills and into the body of the insect. The oxygen of the air that is in the water passes out through the walls of these tubes into the blood of the insect.  Yes, John, in fishes the blood comes to the air, in insects the air goes to the blood. The air passes into the air tubes of the insects, and thus is carried all through their bodies.  The blood takes the oxygen out of the air.  Without oxygen in the blood no animal could live.  Now let us go back to our May flies. They remain in the larval state a year, and some species remain two years. Think of living in the mud for two long years!  In the mud they creep about, eating, eating, eating. Then some summer day they leave the mud and swim to the surface of the water.  Pop! they are gone.  They were so quick about it we could not see what happened.  The larval skin burst open and forth leaped the May fly, like a winged fairy from a prison cell.  They do not come out slowly and wait for their wings to dry like the dragon fly.  [Illustration]  They spring out all of a sudden and fly away, leaving their cast-off skin in the pond.  Unless their motions were quick they might be snapped up by the fish that are so fond of them.  But though they seem to emerge thus quickly into perfect winged May flies, they are not quite done with infancy. They are still wrapped about by a very delicate skin that they have to get rid of. So they fly to a bush near the water and stay a little while until this skin splits and comes off, and they are free.  In spite of their quick motions when they spring from the water, many of the May flies fall back into it and are caught by the fish.  [Illustration here, as the text is broken]  It is said that the trout become fat and good-flavored when the May flies emerge, they eat so many of them. And what the fish do not catch the birds try to. Swallows and other insect-loving birds have a glorious feast when the May flies come out. For a season they live in the midst of more delicacies than they can possibly use.  Fish like the May fly larvæ, too, which is probably the reason the larvæ have learned to live in the mud, out of reach.  Fishermen dig up the larvæ for bait, so you see the May flies have a hard time to get safely through the world.  But in spite of difficulties a great many of them live, and some summer day out they come trooping.  They spring all at once from the surface of the water as by magic, hundreds and thousands,"]]]
