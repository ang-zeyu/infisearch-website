Because if it does--\"  Schallenmacher shook his head. \"There just isn't enough watershed, and there's too much valley. I'll be very much surprised if that stream, there\"--he nodded at the hundred-power screen--\"ever gets more than six inches over the bank.\"  \"I don't know what those houses are built of. This is all alluvial country; building stone would be almost unobtainable. I don't see anything like a brick kiln. I don't see any evidence of irrigation, either, so there must be plenty of rainfall. If they use adobe, or sun-dried brick, houses would start to crumble in a few years, and they would be pulled down and the rubble shoved aside to make room for a new house. The village has been rising on its own ruins, probably shifting back and forth from one end of that mound to the other.\"  \"If that's it, they've been there a long time,\" Karl Dorver said. \"And how far have they advanced?\"  \"Early bronze; I'll bet they still use a lot of stone implements. Pre-dynastic Egypt, or very early Tigris-Euphrates, in Terran terms. I can't see any evidence that they have the wheel. They have draft animals; when we were coming down, I saw a few of them pulling pole travoises. I'd say they've been farming for a long time. They have quite a diversity of crops, and I suspect that they have some idea of crop-rotation. I'm amazed at their musical instruments; they seem to have put more skill into making them than anything else. I'm going to take a jeep, while they're all in the village, and have a look around the fields, now.\"  Charley Loughran went along for specimens, and, for the ride, Lillian Ransby. Most of his guesses, he found, had been correct. He found a number of pole travoises, from which the animals had been unhitched in the first panic when the landing craft had been coming down. Some of them had big baskets permanently attached. There were drag-marks everywhere in the soft ground, but not a single wheel track. He found one plow, cunningly put together with wooden pegs and rawhide lashings; the point was stone, and it would only score a narrow groove, not a proper furrow. It was, however, fitted with a big bronze ring to which a draft animal could be hitched. Most of the cultivation seemed to have been done with spades and hoes. He found a couple of each, bronze, cast flat in an open-top mold. They hadn't learned to make composite molds.  There was an even wider variety of crops than he had expected: two cereals, a number of different root-plants, and a lot of different legumes, and things like tomatoes and pumpkins.  \"Bet these people had a pretty good life, here--before the Terrans came,\" Charley observed.  \"Don't say that in front of Paul,\" Lillian warned. \"He has enough to worry about now, without starting him on whether we'll do these people more harm than good.\"  Two more landing craft had come down from the _Hubert Penrose_; they found Dave Questell superintending the unloading of more prefab-huts, and two were already up that had been brought down with the first landing.  A name for the planet had also arrived.  \"Svantovit,\" Karl Dorver told him. \"Principal god of the Baltic Slavs, about three thousand years ago. Guy Vindinho dug it out of the 'Encyclopedia of Mythology.' Svantovit was represented as holding a bow in one hand and a horn in the other.\"  \"Well, that fits. What will we call the natives; Svantovitians, or Svantovese?\"  \"Well, Paul wanted to call them Svantovese, but Luis persuaded him to call them Svants. He said everybody'd call them that, anyhow, so we might as well make it official from the start.\"  \"We can call the language Svantovese,\" Lillian decided. \"After dinner, I am going to start playing back recordings and running off audiovisuals. I will be so happy to know that I have a name for what I'm studying. Probably be all I will know.\"         *       *       *       *       *  After dinner, he and Karl and Paul went into a huddle on what sort of gifts to give the natives, and the advisability of trading with them, and for what. Nothing too far in advance of their present culture level. Wheels; they could be made in the fabricating shop aboard the ship.  \"You know, it's odd,\" Karl Dorver said. \"These people here have never seen a wheel, and, except in documentary or historical-drama films, neither have a lot of Terrans.\"  That was true. As a means of transportation, the wheel had been completely obsolete since the development of contragravity, six centuries ago. Well, a lot of Terrans in the Year Zero had never seen a suit of armor, or an harquebus, or even a tinder box or a spinning wheel.  Wheelbarrows; now there was something they'd find useful. He screened Max Milzer, in charge of the fabricating and repair shops on the ship. Max had never even heard of a wheelbarrow.  \"I can make them up, Mark; better send me some drawings, though. Did you just invent it?\"  \"As far as I know, a man named Leonardo da Vinci invented it, in the Sixth Century Pre-Atomic. How soon can you get me half a dozen of them?\"  \"Well, let's see. Welded sheet metal, and pipe for the frame and handles. I'll have some of them for you by noon tomorrow. Now, about hoes; how tall are these people, and how long are their arms, and how far can they stoop over?\"         *       *       *       *       *  They were all up late, that night. So were the Svants; there was a fire burning in the middle of the village, and watch-fires along the edge of the mound. Luis Gofredo was just as distrustful of them as they were of the Terrans; he kept the camp lighted, a strong guard on the alert, and the area of darkness beyond infra red lighted and covered by photoelectric sentries on the ground and snoopers in the air. Like Paul Meillard, Luis Gofredo was a worrier and a pessimist. Everything happened for the worst in this worst of all possible galaxies, and if anything could conceivably go wrong, it infallibly would. That was probably why he was still alive and had never had a command massacred.  The wheelbarrows, four of them, came down from the ship by midmorning. With them came a grindstone, a couple of crosscut saws, and a lot of picks and shovels and axes, and cases of sheath knives and mess gear and miscellaneous trade goods, including a lot of the empty wine and whisky bottles that had been hoarded for the past four years.  At lunch, the talk was almost exclusively about the language problem. Lillian Ransby, who had not gotten to sleep before sunrise and had just gotten up, was discouraged.  \"I don't know what we're going to do next,\" she admitted. \"Glenn Orent and Anna and I were on it all night, and we're nowhere. We have about a hundred wordlike sounds isolated, and twenty or so are used repeatedly, and we can't assign a meaning to any of them. And none of the Svants ever reacted the same way twice to anything we said to them. There's just no one-to-one relationship anywhere.\"  \"I'm beginning to doubt they have a language,\" the Navy intelligence officer said. \"Sure, they make a lot of vocal noise. So do chipmunks.\"  \"They have to have a language,\" Anna de Jong declared. \"No sapient thought is possible without verbalization.\"  \"Well, no society like that is possible without some means of communication,\" Karl Dorver supported her from the other flank. He seemed to have made that point before. \"You know,\" he added, \"I'm beginning to wonder if it mightn't be telepathy.\"  He evidently hadn't suggested that before. The others looked at him in surprise. Anna started to say, \"Oh, I doubt if--\" and then stopped.  \"I know, the race of telepaths is an old gimmick that's been used in new-planet adventure stories for centuries, but maybe we've finally found one.\"  \"I don't like it, Karl,\" Loughran said. \"If they're telepaths, why don't they understand us? And if they're telepaths, why do they talk at all? And you can't convince me that this boodly-oodly-doodle of theirs isn't talking.\"  \"Well, our neural structure and theirs won't be nearly alike,\" Fayon said. \"I know, this analogy between telepathy and radio is full of holes, but it's good enough for this. Our wave length can't be picked up with their sets.\"  \"The deuce it can't,\" Gofredo contradicted. \"I've been bothered about that from the beginning. These people act as though they got meaning from us. Not the meaning we intend, but some meaning. When Paul made the gobbledygook speech, they all reacted in the same way--frightened, and then defensive. The you-me routine simply bewildered them, as we'd be at a set of semantically lucid but self-contradictory statements. When Lillian tried to introduce herself, they were shocked and horrified....\"  \"It looked to me like actual physical disgust,\" Anna interpolated.  \"When I tried it, they acted like a lot of puppies being petted, and when Mark tried it, they were simply baffled. I watched Mark explaining that steel knives were dangerously sharp; they got the demonstration, but when he tried to tie words onto it, it threw them completely.\"  \"ALL RIGHT. Pass that,\" Loughran conceded. \"But if they have telepathy, why do they use spoken words?\"  \"Oh, I can answer that,\" Anna said. \"Say they communicated by speech originally, and developed their telepathic faculty slowly and without realizing it. They'd go on using speech, and since the message would be received telepathically ahead of the spoken message, nobody would pay any attention to the words as such. Everybody would have a spoken language of his own; it would be sort of the instrumental accompaniment to the song.\"  \"Some of them don't bother speaking,\" Karl nodded. \"They just toot.\"  \"I'll buy that, right away,\" Loughran agreed. \"In mating, or in group-danger situations, telepathy would be a race-survival characteristic. It would be selected for genetically, and the non-gifted strains would tend to die out.\"  It wouldn't do. It wouldn't do at all. He said so.  \"Look at their technology. We either have a young race, just emerged from savagery, or an old, stagnant race."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19077"],["title","Salads, Sandwiches and Chafing-Dish Dainties (#1)"],["body","Bluefish Salad                                  \"    \"     72   Litchi Nut and Orange Salad                     \"    \"     72   Moulded Salmon Salad                            \"    \"     74   Salad of Shrimps and Bamboo Sprouts             \"    \"     74   Spinach and Egg Salad                           \"    \"     84   Marguerite Salad                                \"    \"     84   Easter Salad                                    \"    \"     86   Country Salad                                   \"    \"     86   Fruit Salad                                     \"    \"     94   Turquoise Salad No. 2                           \"    \"     94   Cheese Ramequins                                \"    \"    106   Individual Soufflé of Cheese                    \"    \"    106   Pineapple-Cheese and Crackers                   \"    \"    110   Salad of Lettuce with Cheese and Macedoine      \"    \"    110   Chicken Salad Sandwiches                        \"    \"    126   Halibut Sandwiches with Aspic                   \"    \"    126   Wedding Sandwich Rolls                          \"    \"    128   Club Sandwich                                   \"    \"    128   Boston Brown Bread                              \"    \"    138   Bread cut for Sandwiches                        \"    \"    138   Bowl of Fruit-Punch ready for serving           \"    \"    143   Copper Chafing-Dish with Earthen Casserole      \"    \"    149   Chafing-Dish, Filler, etc.                      \"    \"    153   Course at Formal Dinner served in Individual   Chafing-Dishes                                  \"    \"    157   Butter Balls with Utensils for Chafing-Dish     \"    \"    178   Moulded Halibut with Creamed Peas               \"    \"    178   Yorkshire Rabbit                                \"    \"    186   Curried Eggs                                    \"    \"    186   Mushroom Cromeskies, ready for cooking          \"    \"    198   Prune Toast                                     \"    \"    198     PART I.  SALADS.            \"_Though my stomach was sharp, I could scarce help regretting            To spoil such a delicate picture by eating._\"     INTRODUCTION.            At their savory dinner set           Herbs and other country messes,           Which the neat-handed Phyllis dresses.                                            --_Milton._   Our taste for salads--and in their simplest form who is not fond of salads?--is an inheritance from classic times and Eastern lands. In the hot climates of the Orient, cucumbers and melons were classed among earth's choicest productions; and a resort ever grateful in the heat of the day was \"a lodge in a garden of cucumbers.\"  At the Passover the Hebrews ate lettuce, camomile, dandelion and mint,--the \"bitter herbs\" of the Paschal feast,--combined with oil and vinegar. Of the Greeks, the rich were fond of the lettuces of Smyrna, which appeared on their tables at the close of the repast. In this respect the Romans, at first, imitated the Greeks, but later came to serve lettuce with eggs as a first course and to excite the appetite. The ancient physicians valued lettuce for its narcotic virtue, and, on account of this property, Galen, the celebrated Greek physician, called it \"the philosopher's or wise man's herb.\"  The older historians make frequent mention of salad plants and salads. In the biblical narrative Moses wrote: \"And the children of Israel wept again and said, We remember the fish which we did eat in Egypt freely; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlick.\"  In his second Eclogue, Virgil represents a rustic maid, Thestylis, preparing for the reapers a salad called _moretum_. He wrote, also, a poem bearing this title, in which he describes the composition and preparation of the dish.  A modern authority says, \"Salads refresh without exciting and make people younger.\" Whether this be strictly true or not may be an open question, but certainly in the assertion a grain of truth is visible; for it is a well-known fact that \"salad plants are better tonics and blood purifiers than druggists' compounds.\" There is, also, an old proverb: \"Eat onions in May, and all the year after physicians may play.\" What is health but youth?  Vegetables, fish and meats, \"left over,\"--all may be transformed, by artistic treatment, into salads delectable to the eye and taste. Potatoes are subject to endless combinations. First of all in this connection, before dressing the potatoes allow them to stand in bouillon, meat broth, or even in the liquor in which corned beef has been cooked; then drain carefully before adding the oil and other seasonings.  Of uncooked vegetables, cabbage lettuce--called long ago by the Greek physician, Galen, the philosopher's or wise man's herb--stands at the head of salad plants. Like all uncooked vegetables, lettuce must be served fresh and crisp, and the more quickly it is grown the more tender it will be. When dressed for the table, each leaf should glisten with oil, yet no perceptible quantity should fall to the salad-bowl. Watercress, being rich in sulphuretted oil, is often served without oil. Cheese or eggs combine well with cress; and such a salad, with a sandwich of coarse bread and butter, together with a cup of sparkling coffee, forms an ideal luncheon for a picnic or for the home piazza. Indeed, all the compound salads,--that is, salads of many ingredients,--more particularly if they are served with a cooked or mayonnaise dressing, are substantial enough for the chief dish of a hearty meal. Their digestibility depends, in large measure, on the tenderness of the different ingredients, as well as upon the freshness of the uncooked vegetables that enter into their composition.  A salad has this superiority over every other production of the culinary art: A salad (but not every salad) is suitable to serve upon any occasion, or to any class or condition of men. Among _bon vivants_, without a _new_ salad, no matter how _recherché_ the other courses may be, the luncheon, or dinner party, of to-day does not pass as an unqualified success.  While salads may be compounded of all kinds of delicate meats, fish, shellfish, eggs, nuts, fruit, cheese and vegetables, cooked or uncooked, two things are indispensable to every kind and grade of salad, viz., the foundation of vegetables and the dressing.   =The Dressing.=  Salads are dressed with oil, acid and condiments; and, sometimes, a sweet, as honey or sugar, is used. A perfect salad is not necessarily acetic. The presence of vinegar in a dressing, like that of onions and its relatives, on most occasions should be suspected only. Wyvern and other true epicures consider the advice of Sydney Smith, as expressed in the following couplet, \"most pernicious\":--            \"Four times the spoon with oil of Lucca crown,            And twice with vinegar procured from town.\"  Aromatic vinegars, a few drops of which, used occasionally, lend piquancy and variety to an every-day salad, can be purchased at high-class provision stores; but the true salad-maker is an artist, and prefers to compound her own colors (_i.e._, vinegars); therefore we have given several recipes for the same, which may be easily modified to suit individual tastes.  Indeed, the dressing of a salad, though in the early days of the century considered a special art,--an art that rendered it possible for at least one noted Royalist refugee to amass a considerable fortune,--is entirely a matter of individual taste, or, more properly speaking, of cultivation. On this account, particularly for a French dressing, no set rules can be given. By experience and judgment one must decide upon the proportions of the different ingredients, or, more specifically, upon the proportions of the oil and acid to be used. Often four spoonfuls of oil are used to one of vinegar. Four spoonfuls of oil to two, three or four of vinegar may be the proportion preferred by others, and the quantity may vary for different salads.  Though in many of the recipes explicit quantities of oil, vinegar and condiments are given, it is with the understanding that these quantities are indicated simply as an approximate rule; sometimes less and sometimes more will be required, according to the tendency of the article dressed to absorb oil and acid, or the taste of the salad dresser.   =Use of Dressings.=  The dressings in most common use are the French and the mayonnaise. A French dressing is used for green vegetables, for fruit and nuts, and to marinate cooked vegetables, or the meat or fish for a meat or fish salad. Mayonnaise dressing is used for meat, fish, some varieties of fruit, as banana, apple and pineapple, and for some vegetables, as cauliflower, asparagus and tomatoes. Any article to be served with mayonnaise, after standing an hour or more in a marinade,--_i.e._, French dressing,--should be carefully drained, as, by the pickling process, liquid will drain out into the bottom of the vessel and, mixing with the mayonnaise, will liquefy the same.   =Arrangement of Salads.=  In the arrangement of salads there may be great display of taste and individuality. By a judicious selection from materials that may be kept constantly in store, and with one or two window boxes, in which herbs are growing, any one, with a modicum of inventive skill, can so change and modify the appearance and flavor of her salads that she may seem always to present a new one.   =Composition of Mayonnaise.=  Mayonnaise dressing is composed largely of olive oil. A small amount of yolk of egg is used as a foundation. The oil, with the addition of condiments, is slightly acidulated with vinegar and lemon juice, one or both, and the whole is made very light and thick by beating. Mayonnaise forms a very handsome dressing, and it is much enjoyed by those who are fond of oil.   =Value of Oil.=  Pure olive oil is almost entirely without flavor, and a taste for it can be readily acquired; and, when we consider that it contains all the really"]]]
