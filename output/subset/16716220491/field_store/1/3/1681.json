But think of the reward for the tracker who discovers where such go to die. To find the graveyard of the graz herds would make any man wealthy beyond dreams.\"  \"How much truth is there in that legend?\" Tau asked.  The Chief Ranger shrugged. \"Who can say? This much _is_ true: I have served my life in the forests since I could walk. I have listened to the talk of Trackers, Hunters, Rangers in my father's courtyards and field camps since I could understand their words. Yet never has any man reported the finding of a body of a graz that died a natural death. The scavengers might well account for the bulk of flesh, but the tusks and the bones should be visible for years. And this, too, I have seen with my own eyes: a graz close to death, supported by two of its kind and being urged along to the big swamps. Perhaps it is only that the suffering animal longs for water at its end, or perhaps in the heart of that morass there does lie the graz graveyard. But no man has found a naturally dead graz, nor has any returned from exploring the big swamps....\"  Lightning on peaks which were like polished jet--bare rock above, the lush overgrowth of jungle below. And between, this fortress held by men who dared both the heights and the depths. The wildly burgeoning life of Khatka had surrounded the off-worlders since they had come here. There was something untameable about Khatka; the lush planet lured and yet repelled at the same time.  \"Zoboru far from here?\"  The Chief Ranger pointed north in answer to the captain's question.  \"About a hundred leagues. It is the first new preserve we have prepared in ten years. And it is our desire to make it the best for tri-dee hunters. That is why we are now operating taming teams--\"  \"Taming teams?\" Dane had to ask.  The Chief Ranger was ready enough to discuss his project.  \"Zoboru is a no-kill preserve. The animals, they come to learn that after a while. But we cannot wait several years until they do. So we make them gifts.\" He laughed, evidently recalling some incident. \"Sometimes, perhaps, we are too eager. Most of our visitors who wish to make tri-dees want to picture big game--graz, amplet, rock apes, lions--\"  \"Lions?\" echoed Dane.  \"Not Terran lions, no. But my people, when they landed on Khatka, found a few animals that reminded them of those they had always known. So they gave those the same names. A Khatkan lion is furred, it is a hunter and a great fighter, but it is not the cat of Terra. However, it is in great demand as a tri-dee actor. So we summon it out of lurking by providing free meals. One shoots a poli, a water rat, or a landeer and drags the carcass behind a low-flying flitter. The lion springs upon the moving meat, which it can also scent, and the rope is cut, leaving a free dinner.  \"The lions are not stupid. In a very short time they connect the sound of a flitter cutting the air with food. So they come to the banquet and those on the flitter can take their tri-dee shots at ease. Only there must also be care taken in such training. One forest guard on the Komog preserve became too enterprising. He dragged his kill at first. Then, to see if he could get the lions to forget man's presence entirely, he hung the training carcasses on the flitter, encouraging them to jump for their food.  \"For the guard that was safe enough, but it worked too too well. A month or so later a Hunter was escorting a client through Komog and they swung low to get a good picture of a water rat emerging from the river. Suddenly there was a snarl behind them and they found themselves sharing the flitter with a lioness annoyed at finding no meat waiting on board.  \"Luckily, they both wore stass belts; but they had to land the flitter and leave until the lioness wandered off, and she seriously damaged the machine in her irritation. So now our guards play no more fancy tricks while on taming runs. Tomorrow--no,\" he corrected himself, \"the day after tomorrow I will be able to show you how the process works.\"  \"And tomorrow?\" inquired the captain.  \"Tomorrow my men make hunting magic.\" Asaki's voice was expressionless.  \"Your chief witch doctor being?\" questioned Tau.  \"Lumbrilo.\" The Chief Ranger did not appear disposed to add to that but Tau pursued the subject.  \"His office is hereditary?\"  \"Yes. Does that make any difference?\" For the first time there was a current of repressed eagerness in the other's tone.  \"Perhaps a vast amount of difference,\" Tau replied. \"A hereditary office may carry with it two forms of conditioning, one to influence its holder, one to affect the public-at-large. Your Lumbrilo may have come to believe deeply in his own powers; he would be a very remarkable man if he did not. It is almost certain that your people unquestionably accept him as a worker of wonders?\"  \"They do so accept.\" Once more Asaki's voice was drained of life.  \"And Lumbrilo does not accept something you believe necessary?\"  \"Again the truth, Medic. Lumbrilo does not accept his proper place in the scheme of things!\"  \"He is a member of one of your Five Families?\"  \"No, his clan is small, always set apart. From the beginning here, those who spoke for gods and demons did not also order men.\"  \"Separation of church and state,\" commented Tau thoughtfully. \"Yet in our Terran past there have been times when church and state were one. Does Lumbrilo desire that?\"  Asaki raised his eyes to the mountain peaks, to the northward where lay his beloved work.  \"I do not know what Lumbrilo wants, save that it makes mischief--or worse! This I tell you: hunting magic is part of our lives and it has at its core some of those unexplainable happenings which you have acknowledged do exist. I have used powers I can neither explain nor understand as part of my work. In the jungle and on the grasslands an off-worlder must guard his life with a stass belt if he goes unarmed. But I--any of my men--can walk unharmed if we obey the rules of our magic. Only Lumbrilo does other things which his forefathers did not. And he boasts that he can do more. So he has a growing following of those who believe--and those who fear.\"  \"You want me to face him?\"  The Chief Ranger's big hands closed upon the rim of the parapet as if they could exert enough pressure to crumble the hard stone. \"I want you to see whether there is trickery in this. Trickery I can fight, for that there are weapons. But if Lumbrilo truly controls forces for which there is no name, then perhaps we must patch up an uneasy peace--or go down in defeat. And, off-worlder, I come from a line of warriors--we do not drink defeat easily!\"  \"That I also believe,\" Tau returned quietly. \"Be sure, sir, if there is trickery in this man's magic and I can detect it, the secret shall be yours.\"  \"Let us hope that so it shall be.\"  Subconsciously, Dane had always associated the practice of magic with darkness and the night. But the next morning the sun was high and hot when he made one of the party coming down to a second and larger walled terrace where the Hunters, Trackers, Guards and other followers of the Chief Ranger were assembled in irregular rows.  There was a low sound which was more a throb in the clear air about them, getting into a man's blood and pumping in rhythm there. Dane tracked the sound to its source: four large drums standing waist high before the men who tapped them delicately with the tips of all ten fingers.  The necklaces of claws and teeth about those dusky throats, the kilts of fringed hide, the crossed belts of brilliantly spotted or striped fur were in contrast to the very efficient and modern side arms each man wore, to the rest of the equipment sheathed and strapped at their belts.  There was a carved stool for the Chief Ranger, another for Captain Jellico. Dane and Tau settled themselves on the less comfortable seats of the terrace steps. Those tapping fingers increased their rate of beat, and the notes of the drums rose from the low murmur of hived bees to the mutter of mountain thunder still half a range away. A bird called from those inner courts of the palace from which the women never ventured.  Da--da--da--da.... Voices took up the thud-thud of the drums, the heads of the squatting men moved in a slow swing from side to side. Tau's hand closed about Dane's wrist and the younger man looked around, startled, to see that the medic's eyes were alight, that he was watching the assembly with the alertness of Sindbad approaching prey.  \"Calculate the stowage space in Number One hold!\"  That amazing order, delivered in a whisper, shocked Dane into obeying it. Number One hold ... there were three divisions now and the stowage was--He became aware that for a small space of time he had escaped the net being woven by the beat of the drum, the drone of voices, the nodding of heads. He moistened his lips. So that was how it worked! He had heard Tau speak often enough about self-hypnotism under such conditions, but this was the first time the meaning of it had been clear.  Two men were shuffling out of nowhere, wearing nothing on their dark bodies but calf-length kilts of tails, black tails with fluffy white tips, which swayed uniformly in time to their pacing feet. Their heads and shoulders were masked by beautifully cured and semi-mounted animal heads displaying half-open jaws with double pairs of curved fangs. The black-and-white striped fur, the sharply pointed ears, were neither canine nor feline, but a weird combination of the two.  Dane gabbled two trading formulas under his breath and tried to think of the relation of Samantine rock coinage to galactic credits. Only this time his defenses did not work. From between the two shuffling dancers padded something on four feet. The canine-feline creature was more than just a head; it was a loose-limbed, graceful body fully eight feet in length, and the red eyes in the prick-eared head were those of a confident killer. It walked without restraint, lazily, with arrogance,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18857"],["title","A Journey to the Centre of the Earth (#1)"],["body","a penny for a translation. His delight was to have found the original work in the Icelandic tongue, which he declared to be one of the most magnificent and yet simple idioms in the world--while at the same time its grammatical combinations were the most varied known to students.  \"About as easy as German?\" was my insidious remark.  My uncle shrugged his shoulders.  \"The letters at all events,\" I said, \"are rather difficult of comprehension.\"  \"It is a Runic manuscript, the language of the original population of Iceland, invented by Odin himself,\" cried my uncle, angry at my ignorance.  I was about to venture upon some misplaced joke on the subject, when a small scrap of parchment fell out of the leaves. Like a hungry man snatching at a morsel of bread the Professor seized it. It was about five inches by three and was scrawled over in the most extraordinary fashion.  The lines shown here are an exact facsimile of what was written on the venerable piece of parchment--and have wonderful importance, as they induced my uncle to undertake the most wonderful series of adventures which ever fell to the lot of human beings.  My uncle looked keenly at the document for some moments and then declared that it was Runic. The letters were similar to those in the book, but then what did they mean? This was exactly what I wanted to know.  Now as I had a strong conviction that the Runic alphabet and dialect were simply an invention to mystify poor human nature, I was delighted to find that my uncle knew as much about the matter as I did--which was nothing. At all events the tremulous motion of his fingers made me think so.  \"And yet,\" he muttered to himself, \"it is old Icelandic, I am sure of it.\"  And my uncle ought to have known, for he was a perfect polyglot dictionary in himself. He did not pretend, like a certain learned pundit, to speak the two thousand languages and four thousand idioms made use of in different parts of the globe, but he did know all the more important ones.  It is a matter of great doubt to me now, to what violent measures my uncle's impetuosity might have led him, had not the clock struck two, and our old French cook called out to let us know that dinner was on the table.  \"Bother the dinner!\" cried my uncle.  But as I was hungry, I sallied forth to the dining room, where I took up my usual quarters. Out of politeness I waited three minutes, but no sign of my uncle, the Professor. I was surprised. He was not usually so blind to the pleasure of a good dinner. It was the acme of German luxury--parsley soup, a ham omelette with sorrel trimmings, an oyster of veal stewed with prunes, delicious fruit, and sparkling Moselle. For the sake of poring over this musty old piece of parchment, my uncle forbore to share our meal. To satisfy my conscience, I ate for both.  The old cook and housekeeper was nearly out of her mind. After taking so much trouble, to find her master not appear at dinner was to her a sad disappointment--which, as she occasionally watched the havoc I was making on the viands, became also alarm. If my uncle were to come to table after all?  Suddenly, just as I had consumed the last apple and drunk the last glass of wine, a terrible voice was heard at no great distance. It was my uncle roaring for me to come to him. I made very nearly one leap of it--so loud, so fierce was his tone.     CHAPTER 2  THE MYSTERIOUS PARCHMENT   [Illustration: Runic Glyphs]  \"I Declare,\" cried my uncle, striking the table fiercely with his fist, \"I declare to you it is Runic--and contains some wonderful secret, which I must get at, at any price.\"  I was about to reply when he stopped me.  \"Sit down,\" he said, quite fiercely, \"and write to my dictation.\"  I obeyed.  \"I will substitute,\" he said, \"a letter of our alphabet for that of the Runic: we will then see what that will produce. Now, begin and make no mistakes.\"  The dictation commenced with the following incomprehensible result:        mm.rnlls esruel seecJde      sgtssmf unteief niedrke      kt,samn atrateS Saodrrn      emtnaeI nuaect  rrilSa      Atvaar  .nscrc  ieaabs      ccdrmi  eeutul  frantu      dt,iac  oseibo  KediiY   Scarcely giving me time to finish, my uncle snatched the document from my hands and examined it with the most rapt and deep attention.  \"I should like to know what it means,\" he said, after a long period.  I certainly could not tell him, nor did he expect me to--his conversation being uniformly answered by himself.  \"I declare it puts me in mind of a cryptograph,\" he cried, \"unless, indeed, the letters have been written without any real meaning; and yet why take so much trouble? Who knows but I may be on the verge of some great discovery?\"  My candid opinion was that it was all rubbish! But this opinion I kept carefully to myself, as my uncle's choler was not pleasant to bear. All this time he was comparing the book with the parchment.  \"The manuscript volume and the smaller document are written in different hands,\" he said, \"the cryptograph is of much later date than the book; there is an undoubted proof of the correctness of my surmise. [An irrefragable proof I took it to be.] The first letter is a double M, which was only added to the Icelandic language in the twelfth century--this makes the parchment two hundred years posterior to the volume.\"  The circumstances appeared very probable and very logical, but it was all surmise to me.  \"To me it appears probable that this sentence was written by some owner of the book. Now who was the owner, is the next important question. Perhaps by great good luck it may be written somewhere in the volume.\"  With these words Professor Hardwigg took off his spectacles, and, taking a powerful magnifying glass, examined the book carefully.  On the fly leaf was what appeared to be a blot of ink, but on examination proved to be a line of writing almost effaced by time. This was what he sought; and, after some considerable time, he made out these letters:  [Illustration: Runic Glyphs]  \"Arne Saknussemm!\" he cried in a joyous and triumphant tone, \"that is not only an Icelandic name, but of a learned professor of the sixteenth century, a celebrated alchemist.\"  I bowed as a sign of respect.  \"These alchemists,\" he continued, \"Avicenna, Bacon, Lully, Paracelsus, were the true, the only learned men of the day. They made surprising discoveries. May not this Saknussemm, nephew mine, have hidden on this bit of parchment some astounding invention? I believe the cryptograph to have a profound meaning--which I must make out.\"  My uncle walked about the room in a state of excitement almost impossible to describe.  \"It may be so, sir,\" I timidly observed, \"but why conceal it from posterity, if it be a useful, a worthy discovery?\"  \"Why--how should I know? Did not Galileo make a secret of his discoveries in connection with Saturn? But we shall see. Until I discover the meaning of this sentence I will neither eat nor sleep.\"  \"My dear uncle--\" I began.  \"Nor you neither,\" he added.  It was lucky I had taken double allowance that day.  \"In the first place,\" he continued, \"there must be a clue to the meaning. If we could find that, the rest would be easy enough.\"  I began seriously to reflect. The prospect of going without food and sleep was not a promising one, so I determined to do my best to solve the mystery. My uncle, meanwhile, went on with his soliloquy.  \"The way to discover it is easy enough. In this document there are one hundred and thirty-two letters, giving seventy-nine consonants to fifty-three vowels. This is about the proportion found in most southern languages, the idioms of the north being much more rich in consonants. We may confidently predict, therefore, that we have to deal with a southern dialect.\"  Nothing could be more logical.  \"Now,\" said Professor Hardwigg, \"to trace the particular language.\"  \"As Shakespeare says, 'that is the question,\"' was my rather satirical reply.  \"This man Saknussemm,\" he continued, \"was a very learned man: now as he did not write in the language of his birthplace, he probably, like most learned men of the sixteenth century, wrote in Latin. If, however, I prove wrong in this guess, we must try Spanish, French, Italian, Greek, and even Hebrew. My own opinion, though, is decidedly in favor of Latin.\"  This proposition startled me. Latin was my favorite study, and it seemed sacrilege to believe this gibberish to belong to the country of Virgil.  \"Barbarous Latin, in all probability,\" continued my uncle, \"but still Latin.\"  \"Very probably,\" I replied, not to contradict him.  \"Let us see into the matter,\" continued my uncle; \"here you see we have a series of one hundred and thirty-two letters, apparently thrown pell-mell upon paper, without method or organization. There are words which are composed wholly of consonants, such as <i>mm.rnlls</i>, others which are nearly all vowels, the fifth, for instance, which is unteief, and one of the last oseibo. This appears an extraordinary combination. Probably we shall find that the phrase is arranged according to some mathematical plan. No doubt a certain sentence has been written out and then jumbled up--some plan to which some figure is the clue. Now, Harry, to show your English wit--what is that figure?\"  I could give him no hint. My thoughts were indeed far away. While he was speaking I had caught sight of the portrait of my cousin Gretchen, and was wondering when she would return.  We were affianced, and loved one another very sincerely. But my uncle, who never thought even of such sublunary matters, knew nothing of this. Without noticing my abstraction, the Professor began reading the puzzling cryptograph all sorts of ways, according to some theory of his own. Presently, rousing my wandering attention, he dictated one precious attempt to me.  I mildly handed it over to him. It read as follows:       <i>mmessunkaSenrA.icefdoK.segnittamurtn     ecertserrette,rotaivsadua,ednecsedsadne"]]]
