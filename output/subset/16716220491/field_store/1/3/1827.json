Tones, on the contrary, are not and cannot be associated with any _definite_ ideas or impressions; they are as impalpable as they are transient, and, taken separately, leave no lasting trace.  Therefore, whatever stability and palpability a musical composition is to acquire, _must be derived from its form, or design_, and not from its totally unsubstantial material.  It must fall back upon the network traced by the disposition of its points and lines upon the musical canvas; for this it is that constitutes its real and palpable contents.   THE EVIDENCES OF FORM IN MUSIC.--The presence of form in music is manifested, first of all, by the disposition of tones and chords in symmetrical measures, and by the numerous methods of tone arrangement which create and define the element of Rhythm,--the distinction of short and long time-values, and of accented and unaccented (that is, heavy and light) pulses.  This is not what is commonly supposed to constitute form in music, but it is the fundamental condition out of which an orderly system of form may be developed.  As well might the carpenter or architect venture to dispense with scale, compass and square in their constructive labors, as that the composer should neglect beat, measure and rhythm, in his effort to realize a well-developed and intelligible design in the whole, or any part, of his composition.  The beats and measures and phrases are the barley-corn, inch and ell of the musical draughtsman, and without these units of measurement and proportion, neither the vital condition of Symmetry nor the equally important condition of well-regulated Contrast could be clearly established.  The _beat_ is the unit of measurement in music.  The _measure_ is a group of beats,--two, three, four, or more, at the option of the composer.  The bounds of the measures are visibly represented (on the written or printed page) by vertical lines, called bars; and are rendered orally recognizable (to the hearer who does not see the page) by a more or less delicate emphasis, imparted--by some means or other--to the _first_ pulse or beat of each measure, as accent, simply to mark where each new group begins.  Those who play or sing can imagine how vague, and even chaotic, a page of music would look if these vertical bars were omitted; and how much more difficult it would be to read than when these (not only accustomed, but truly necessary) landmarks are present.  Precisely the same unintelligible impression must be, and is, conveyed to the hearer when _his_ landmarks, the accents, are not indicated with sufficient emphasis or clearness to render him sensible of the beginning of each new measure.        *      *      *      *      *      *  The same primary system of measurement and association which is employed in enlarging the beats to measures, is then applied to the association of the measures themselves in the next larger units of musical structure, the Motive, Phrase, Period, and so forth.  Unlike the measures, which are defined by the accents at their _beginning_, these larger factors of form are defined chiefly at their _end_, by the impression of occasional periodic interruption, exactly analogous to the pauses at the end of poetic lines, or at the commas, semicolons and the like, in a prose paragraph.  These interruptions of the musical current, called Cadences, are generally so well defined that even the more superficial listener is made aware of a division of the musical pattern into its sections and parts, each one of which closes as recognizably (though not as irrevocably) as the very last sentence of the piece.  Cadences serve the same purpose in music, then, as do the punctuation marks in rhetoric; and an idea of the senselessness and confusion of a musical composition, if left devoid of cadences in sufficient number and force, may be gleaned from an experimental test of the effect of a page of prose, read with persistent disregard of its commas, colons, and other marks of \"cadence.\"        *      *      *      *      *      *  Another evidence of Form in music, that is at once subtle and powerful, rests upon what might be termed the _linear_ quality of melody.  The famous old definition of a line as a \"succession of points,\" tallies so accurately with that of melody (as a \"succession of single tones\"), that it is not only proper, but peculiarly forceful, to speak of melodies as _tone-lines_.  Our conception of a melody or tune, our ability to recognize and reproduce it, depends far more upon its undulations, its rising, falling, or resting level, than upon its rhythmic features (the varying lengths of its tones).  These movements trace a resonant line before our mind's eye as surely, though perhaps not as distinctly, as the pencil of the artist traces the lines of an image upon the paper; and this process is going on constantly, from beginning to end, in every piece of music.  In a portrait it describes the contours of face and figure,--in a word, the _Form_; in the musical composition it fulfils, to a great extent, the self-same mission, that of defining the Form.  One clear, predominating tone-line traces the \"air\" or tune of the piece; and this is often the only line that arrests the hearer's attention; but there are other tone-lines, less prominent and less extended and coherent, gliding along harmoniously beside the Melody proper, which (something like the shading in a picture) contribute to the richness of the design, and perform their share in proving and illuminating the Form of the whole.  This is most salient in music for orchestra, where each player describes an individual tone-line, rendered all the more distinct and recognizable by the specific \"color\" of his instrument; and that is the chief, perhaps the sole, reason why the orchestra is esteemed the most complete and perfect medium of musical expression.   UNITY AND VARIETY.--As much as opinions and beliefs may differ, among music critics, as to the necessity of Form in music, and the conditions of its existence, no reasonable objection can be taken to the hypothesis that _Clearness and Attractiveness_ are the two vital requisites upon which the enjoyment of any art depends.  The artist's utterances or creations must be intelligible, and they must be interesting.  The lack, partial or total, of either of these qualities neutralizes the force of the intended impression, in precise proportion to the default.  In musical composition these two requisites are embodied in the principles of Unity and Variety.  _Unity_--in its various technical phases of Uniformity, Regularity, Similarity, Equality, Agreement, or whatever other synonym we may find it convenient to use--is the condition out of which the composer must secure intelligibility, clearness, definiteness of expression.  Glance at Ex. 2, and note the evidences of unity (similarity) in the rhythmic and melodic formation of the first four measures.  _Variety_--in its most comprehensive application--is the medium he must employ to arouse and sustain the hearer's interest.  Glance again at Ex. 2, and note the contrast between the two halves of the first four measures, and between these and the following two measures.  These conditions are, of course, squarely opposed to each other, though their interaction is reciprocal rather than antagonistic; and, from what has been said, it is obvious that they are of equal importance. Hence, as was declared on the second page, the great problem of the art-creator consists in so balancing their operations that neither may encroach upon the domain of the other.  For too constant and palpable Unity will inevitably paralyze interest; while too much Variety will as surely tend to obscure the distinctness of the design.        *      *      *      *      *      *  The workings of the principle of Unity (to which attention must first be given, because it appears to come first in the order of creation) are shown in the following elementary details of composition:--  (1) Music is not an art that deals with space, but with Time; therefore the units of its metrical structure are not inches and the like, but divisions of time, the basis of which is the _beat_.  The principle of Unity dictates that the beats which are associated in one and the same musical sentence shall be of equal duration.  Every musician admits the necessity of keeping \"strict time\"--that is, marking the beats in regular, equal pulses.  The sub-divisions of the beats (for example, the eighth or sixteenth notes within a beat) must also be symmetric. So imperative is this law that it generally prevails through the entire piece, with only such temporary elongations or contractions (marked _ritardando_ or _accelerando_) as may be introduced for oratorical effects.  (2) The beats are grouped in _measures_ of uniform duration; that is, containing equal numbers of beats.  (3) The natural _accent_ falls upon the corresponding beat, namely, the first, of each measure; therefore it recurs regularly, at uniform intervals of time.  (4) The _melodic contents_ of the first measure, or measures, are copied (more or less literally) in the next measure, or measures; and are encountered again and again in the later course of the piece, thus insuring a fairly uniform melodic impression from which the character and identity of the composition are derived.  Turn to the 8th Song Without Words of Mendelssohn, and observe how insistently the figure  [Illustration: first fragment of 8th Song]  and its inversion  [Illustration: second fragment of 8th Song]  run through the whole number.  (5) The specific figure of the _accompaniment_ is usually reproduced from measure to measure (or group to group) throughout whole sections of the piece.  Observe, in the 37th Song Without Words, how constantly the ascending figure of six tones recurs in the lower part (left hand).

Many other evidences of Unity are invariably present in good music, so naturally and self-evidently that they almost escape our notice.  Some of these are left to the student's discernment; others will engage our joint attention in due time.        *      *      *      *      *      *  In every one of these manifestations of unity there lies the germ of the principle of Variety, which quickens into life with the action of the former, always following, as offspring and consequence of the primary unity.  Thus:--  (1) The _beats_, though uniform in duration, differ from each other in force.  The first pulse in each measure (or metric group of any size) is heavier, stronger, than the following.  It--the first--is the \"impulse,\" and is what is called the accent.  This dynamic distinction it is that gives rise to the two fundamental classes of rhythm, the duple and triple.  In duple rhythm the accent is followed by one unaccented or lighter beat, so that regular alternation of heavy and light pulses prevails incessantly.  In triple rhythm the accent is followed by _two_ lighter beats, creating similarly constant, but _irregular_ alternation of heavy and light pulses.  [Illustration: Duple and Triple Rhythm]  This distinction is so significant and so striking, that the music lover who is eager to gain the first clues to the structural purpose of a composition, should endeavor to recognize which one of these two rhythmic species underlies the movement to which he is listening.  It is fairly certain to be one or the other continuously.  Of duple measure, the march and polka are familiar examples; of triple measure, the waltz and mazurka.  The \"regularity\" of the former rhythm imparts a certain stability and squareness to the entire piece, while triple rhythm is more graceful and circular in effect.  (2) The same dynamic distinction applies also to whole _measures_, and  (3) to _accents_.  The first of two successive measures, or of two or more accents, is always a trifle heavier than the other.  (4) The _melodic contents_ of the first measure may be exactly reproduced in the succeeding measure; but if this is the case, they are very unlikely to appear still again in the next (third) measure, for that would exaggerate the condition of Unity and create the effect of monotony.  [Illustration: Example 1.  Fragment of Folk-song.]  The measure marked _b_ is exactly like _a_.  But _c_ is all the more contrasting, on account of this similarity.  Or, the melodic contents of a measure may be thus reproduced, as far as the rhythm and direction of the tones are concerned, but--for variety--they may be shifted to a higher or lower place upon the staff, or may be otherwise modified.  [Illustration: Example 2.  Fragment of Beethoven.]  Compare the groups marked _a_ and _b_, and observe how the principles of unity and variety are both active in these four measures, and how their effect is heightened by the formation of _c_.  (5) The figures of the accompaniment, though reproduced in uniform rhythmic values and melodic direction, undergo constant modifications in pitch and in shape, similar, to those shown in Ex. 2.  See, again, No. 37 of the Songs Without Words and note the changes in the formation of the otherwise uniform six-tone groups.

FUNDAMENTAL DETAILS.  TIME.--Time is the same thing in music that it is everywhere else in nature.  It is what passes while a piece of music is being played, sung, or read.  It is like the area of the surface upon which the musical structure is to be erected, and which is measured or divided into so many units for this, so many for that, so many for the other portion of the musical Form.  Time is that quantity which admits of the necessary reduction to units (like the feet and inches of a yardstick), whereby a System of Measurement is established that shall determine the various lengths of the tones, define their rhythmic conditions, and govern the co-operation of several melodies sung or played together. Time is the canvas upon which the musical images are drawn--in melodic _lines_.   TEMPO.--This refers to the degree of motion.  The musical picture is not constant, but panoramic; we never hear a piece of music all at once, but as a panorama of successive sounds.  Tempo refers to the rate of speed with which the scroll passes before our minds.  Thus we speak of rapid tempo (_allegro_, and the like), or slow tempo (_adagio_), and so forth.   BEATS.--The beats are the units in our System of Measurement,--as it were, the inches upon our yardstick of time; they are the particles of time that we mark when we \"count,\" or that the conductor marks with the \"beats\" of his baton.  Broadly speaking, the ordinary beat (in moderate tempo) is about equivalent to a second of time; to less or more than this, of course, in rapid or slow tempo.  Most commonly, the beat is represented in written music by the quarter-note, as in 2-4, 3-4, 4-4, 6-4 measure.  But the composer is at liberty to adopt any value he pleases (8th, 16th, half-note) as beat.  In the first study in Clementi's \"Gradus ad Parnassum,\" the time-signature is 3-1, the whole note as beat; in the 8th Sung Without Words it is 6-16, the sixteenth note as beat; in the last pianoforte sonata of Beethoven (op. 111), last movement, the time-signatures are 9-16, 6-16, and 12-32, the latter being, probably, the smallest beat ever chosen.   MEASURES.--A measure is a group of beats.  The beats are added together, in measures, to obtain a larger unit of time, because larger divisions are more convenient for longer periods; just as we prefer to indicate the dimensions of a house, or farm, in feet or rods, rather than in inches.  Measures differ considerably in extent in various compositions, inasmuch as the number of beats enclosed between the vertical bars may be, and is, determined quite arbitrarily.  What is known as a Simple measure contains either the two beats (heavy-light) of the fundamental duple group, or the three beats (heavy-light-light) of the triple group, shown in the preceding chapter.  Compound measures are such as contain more than two or three beats, and they must always be multiplications, or groups, of a Simple measure; for whether so small as to comprise only the fundamental groups of two or three beats (as in 2-4, 3-8, 3-4 measure), or so large as to embrace as many as twelve beats or more (as in 4-4, 6-4, 6-8, 9-8, 12-8 measure), the measure represents, practically, either the duple or triple species, Simple or Compound.  Thus, a measure of four beats, sometimes called (needlessly) quadruple rhythm, is merely twice two beats; the species is actually _duple_; the alternation of heavy and light pulses is regular; and therefore the third beat is again an accent, as well as the first, though _less heavy_.  A measure of 6-8 is triple species, with accents at beats one and four, precisely as if an additional vertical bar were inserted after the third beat.  In a word, then, the size of the adopted measure is of no consequence, as long as it is retained uniformly through the section to which it belongs; and there is no _real_ difference between 2-4 and 4-4 measure, excepting in the number of bars used.  A curious and rare exception to this rule of the compound measure occurs when five or seven beats are grouped together.  This involves a mingling of the duple and triple species, and, consequently, an irregular disposition of the accents; for instance, 5-4 measure is either 3+2 or 2+3 beats, with corresponding accentuation:  [Illustration: Beat accentuation]   RHYTHM.--This word signifies arrangement,--a principle applied, in music, to the distribution or arrangement of the tones according to their various _time-values_.  The system of measurement (or metric system) furnishes tone material with all the details of division, proportion and comparison; but this, alone, is not rhythm.  The metric system affords the basis for rational and definable rhythm, but \"rhythm\" itself does not enter into the proposition until differentiated factors are associated and opposed to each other.  [Illustration: Example 3.  Rhythm.]  The first measure of this hymn is, by itself, merely an exponent of the metric principle, for it consists of three uniform quarter-notes.  The second measure, however, is a rhythmic one, because, by dotting the first of the three beats, three different time-values are obtained (dotted quarter, eighth, and quarter).  Further, by association and comparison with each other, both measures assume a collective rhythmic significance.  The rhythmic disposition of the tones is to a certain extent optional with the composer, but by no means wholly so; the rules of rhythm are probably the most definite and obvious of "]]]
