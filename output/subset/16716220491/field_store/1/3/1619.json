It was still more gentle now, though it was six times as large and loud as before. And he thought it sounded a little like his mother's.  \"What is your name, little boy?\" it asked.  \"Diamond,\" answered Diamond under the bed-clothes.  \"What a funny name!\"  \"It is a very nice name,\" replied the boy.  \"I am not so sure of that,\" said the voice.  \"Well, I am!\" returned Diamond. \"I think it is a very pretty name.\"  \"Diamond is a useless thing, rather,\" said the voice.  \"That is not true. Diamond is very useful--and as big as two--and so quiet all night! But doesn't he make a jolly row in the morning, getting up on his four great legs! It is like thunder!\"  \"You do not seem to know what a diamond is!\" cried the voice.  \"Oh, don't I, just! Diamond is a great and good horse, and he sleeps right under me. He is old Diamond and I am young Diamond. Or, if you like it better, Mr. North Wind, if you are so particular, he is big Diamond and I am little Diamond. And I do not know which of us my father likes best!\"  A beautiful laugh, soft and musical, sounded somewhere near him. But the boy kept his head under the clothes.  \"I am not Mr. North Wind,\" said the voice.  \"You told me you were the North Wind,\" cried Diamond.  \"I did not say _Mr._ North Wind,\" said the voice.  \"Well, I _do_ say Mr. for my mother tells me always to be polite.\"  \"Then let me tell you that I do not think it at all polite for you to say Mr. to me,\" answered the voice.  \"Isn't it? Well, I am sorry then.\"  \"But you ought to know better,\" said the voice. \"You can't think it is polite to lie there with your head under the bed-clothes and never look to see what kind of a person you are talking to! I want you to come out with me.\"  \"I want to go to sleep!\" said Diamond.  \"Will you take your head out of the bed-clothes?\" said the voice a little angrily.  \"No!\" said Diamond crossly.  The moment he said the word a fierce blast of wind crashed in the wall and swept the clothes off him. He started up in a fright. Leaning over him was the large, beautiful, pale face of a woman. Her dark eyes had begun to flash a little but the rest of her face was very sweet and beautiful. What was very strange, though, was that away from her head streamed out her black hair in every direction like dark clouds. Soon it fell down about her again and then her face came out of it like the moon out of the clouds.  \"Will you go with me now, little Diamond?\" asked the North Wind bending over him and speaking very gently.  \"Yes, yes!\" cried Diamond, stretching out his arms toward her. \"Yes, I will go with you, dear North Wind. I am not a bit afraid. I will go! But,\" he added, \"how shall I get my clothes? They are in mother's room and the door is locked.\"  \"Oh never mind your clothes. You will not be cold. Nobody is cold with the North Wind.\"  \"I thought everybody was,\" said Diamond.  \"That is a great mistake. People are not cold when they are _with_ the North Wind--only when they are against it. Now will you come?\"  \"Yes, dear North Wind. You are so beautiful I am quite ready to go with you.\"  \"Ah, but I may not always look beautiful. If you see me with my face all black, don't be frightened. If you see me flapping wings like bat's wings, as big as the whole sky, don't be afraid. If you hear me raging, you must believe that I am just doing my work. Nay, Diamond, if I change into a serpent or a tiger, you must not let go your hold of me, for it will be I just the same. And now, come!\"  She turned away and went so swiftly that she was gone before Diamond was more than started. When he finally got down the stairs and out into the yard, no one did he see. And there he stood with his bare feet on the hard stones of the paved yard.  \"I dare say she is hiding somewhere to see what I will do,\" said Diamond. So around the end of the stable he went to see if he could find her. But at once, sharp as a knife, the wind came against his little chest and bare legs. And stronger and stronger the wind seemed to blow. It was _so_ cold! All at once, he remembered that she had said that people were not cold if they went _with_ the North Wind. So he turned his back and trotted again toward the yard and sure enough, he began to feel almost warm once more!  On and on, North Wind blew him and, presently, she seemed to shove him right against a small door in a wall. It opened and she blew him through it and out into the very middle of the lawn of the house next door. It was here that Mr. Coleman lived who was his father's master and who owned big Diamond. So little Diamond did not feel entirely strange, and then, too, there was a light in one window that looked friendly. As long as he could see that, Diamond could not feel quite alone or lonely. But all at once, the light went almost out. Then indeed, he felt that it was dreadful to be out in the night alone, when every body else was gone to bed! That was more than he could bear and it was not strange that he burst out crying.  Some one in the house heard the sound of his sobbing and came out and found him there. He was taken into the house and into a room which had a bright light and a warm fire in it. Beside this, he found Miss Coleman, the young lady daughter of the house, who was having her long dark hair brushed out before going to bed. Somehow in that state, she looked just like the beautiful North Wind that he had been searching for. Without stopping to think, he ran right into her arms for comfort.  After he was warmed and comforted, they took him back home and knocked on the door to arouse his mother, to come and get him. She was much surprised to see him, you may be sure. She carried him up to his bed again and tucked him snugly in. And there he fell fast asleep.     CHAPTER II  DIAMOND'S FIRST TRIP WITH THE NORTH WIND   Diamond awoke very early the next morning and thought what a curious dream he had had. But the memory of it grew brighter and brighter until it did not look altogether like a dream. In fact he began to doubt whether he had not really been abroad in the wind at night.  All that week it was hard weather. The grass showed white in the morning with the hoar frost which clung to every blade. As Diamond's shoes were not good and his mother had not saved up quite enough money to get him the new pair she so much wanted for him, she would not let him run out. But at length, she brought home his new shoes. No sooner did she find that they fitted him, than she told him he might run out into the yard and amuse himself.  The sun was going down when he flew from the door like a bird from its cage. A great fire of sunset burned over the top of the gate that led to the stables. Above the fire in the sky, lay a large lake of green light, above that a golden cloud, and over that the blue of the wintry heavens. Diamond thought that next to his own home, he had never seen any place he would like so much to live in as that sky.  As he wandered about, he came to stand by the little door which opened upon the lawn of the house next door. That made him remember how the wind had driven him to this same spot on the night of his dream. So he thought he would just go in and see if things looked at all as they did then. But not a flower was to be seen in the beds on the lawn! Even the brave old chrysanthemums and Christmas roses had passed away before the frost. What? Yes! There was _one_. He ran and knelt down to look at it.  It was a primrose--a tiny, tiny thing, but perfect in shape--a baby wonder. As he stooped his face to see it close, a little wind began to blow. Two or three long leaves that stood up behind the flower shook and wavered and quivered. But the primrose lay still in the green hollow, looking up at the sky and not seeming to know at all that the wind was blowing. It looked like a golden eye that the black wintry earth had opened to look at the sky with.  That very same night, after Diamond had been asleep for a little, he awoke all at once in the dark.  \"Open the window, Diamond,\" said a voice.  Now Diamond's mother had once more pasted up North Wind's window.  \"Are you North Wind?\" said Diamond. \"I do not hear you blowing.\"  \"No, but you hear me talking. Open the window for I haven't over much time.\"  \"Yes,\" said Diamond. \"But please, North Wind, where's the use? You left me all alone last time.\"  \"That was your fault,\" returned North Wind. \"I had work to do and you kept me waiting.\"  Diamond was already scratching at the paper like ten mice and, getting hold of the edge of it, tore it off. The next instant a young girl glided across the bed and stood on the floor.  \"Oh, dear!\" said Diamond quite dismayed. \"I didn't know--who are you, please?\"  \"I am North Wind.\"  \"But you are no bigger than I am!\"  \"Do you think I care how big or how little I am? And of course, I am little this evening! Didn't you see me behind the leaves of the primrose? Didn't you see them blowing? Make haste, now, if you want to go with me! Dress as fast as you can and I will go and shake the leaves of the primrose till you come!\"  \"Don't hurt it!\" said Diamond.  North Wind broke out into a little laugh like the breaking of silver bubbles and was gone in a moment. Diamond saw the gleam of something vanishing down the stair. He dressed himself as fast as ever he could and crept out into the yard, through the door in the wall, and away to the primrose. Behind it stood North Wind leaning over it.  \"Come along!\" she said jumping up and holding out her hand. She led him across the garden and with one bound was on top of the wall. Then she reached down her hand to Diamond. He gave a great spring and stood beside her.  Another bound, and they stood in the road by the river. It was full tide and the stars were shining clear in its depths. But they had not walked beside it far before its surface was covered with ripples and the stars had vanished. North Wind was now as tall as a full-grown girl. Her hair was flying about her head and the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18614"],["title","At the Back of the North Wind (#2)"],["body","was blowing a breeze down the river. But she turned aside and went up a narrow lane.  \"I have some rather disagreeable work to do to-night,\" she said. \"And disagreeable work must be looked after first.\"  So saying, she laid hold of Diamond and began to run, gliding along faster and faster. She made many turnings and windings. Once they ran through a hall where they found both the front and back doors open. At the foot of the stair, North Wind stood still and Diamond, hearing a great growl, started in terror. There, instead of North Wind, was a huge wolf by his side! He let go his hold and the wolf bounded up the stair. The windows of the house rattled and shook and there came the sound of a fall.  \"Surely,\" thought Diamond, \"North Wind can't be eating one of the children!\"  He started to rush up after her, but she met him on the stair, took him by the hand and hurried him out of the house.  \"I hope you haven't eaten a baby, North Wind!\" he said very solemnly.  North Wind laughed merrily and went tripping on faster. Her grassy robe swept and swirled about her steps. Wherever it passed over withered leaves, they went fleeing and whirling away and running on their edges all about her feet. \"No, I did not eat a baby,\" she said, \"as you would know if you had not let go of me. I merely scared an ugly nurse who was calling a child bad names. I flew at her throat and she tumbled over with a crash. I had to put on a bad shape before she could see me. I put on a wolf's shape for that is what she is growing to be inside.\"  They were now climbing the slope of a grassy ascent. At the top, North Wind stood and turned her face toward London. The stars were still shining clear and cold overhead. There was not a cloud to be seen.  \"Now,\" said North Wind, \"do not let go of me again. I might have lost you the last time, only I was not in a hurry then. Now I am in a hurry.\"  As she spoke, she was growing larger and larger. Her head went up and up toward the stars. As she grew, her hair, longer and longer, lifted itself from her head and went out in black waves. She put her hands behind her head and began weaving and knotting her hair together. Then she took up Diamond in her hands and threw him over her shoulder saying, \"I have made a place for you in my hair. Get in, Diamond.\"  Diamond soon found the woven nest and crept into it. The next moment he was rising in the air. North Wind grew towering up to the place of the clouds. Her hair went streaming out from her till it spread like a mist over the stars. She flung herself abroad in space. Diamond made a little place through the woven meshes of her hair and peeped through that, for he did not dare look over the top of his nest.  The earth was rushing past like a river or a sea below him. Trees and water and green grass hurried away beneath. Now there was nothing but the roofs of houses sweeping along like a great torrent of stones and rocks. Chimneys fell and tiles flew from the roofs. There was a great roaring for the wind was dashing against London like a stormy sea. Diamond, of course, at the back of North Wind, was in a calm but he could hear it. Around and around and around, swept North Wind, her dark hair rolling and flowing, sweeping the people all into their homes and the bad smells out of the streets.  Suddenly, Diamond saw a little girl coming along a street. She was dreadfully blown by the wind, and a broom she was trailing behind her was very troublesome. It seemed as if the wind had a spite at her! It kept worrying her and tearing at her rags. She was so lonely there!  \"Oh, please, North Wind,\" cried Diamond, \"won't you help that little girl?\"  \"I cannot leave my work, Diamond. But you can help her if you like. Only, I can't wait for you. And mind, the wind will get hold of you too!\"  \"But how shall I get home again,\" cried Diamond, \"if you don't wait for me?\"  \"Well, you must think of that!\" said North Wind.  \"Oh,\" cried Diamond. \"I am sure the wind will blow her over! I _must_ help her anyway! Let me go!\"  Without a word, North Wind dropped into the street and set him down. The same moment, he was caught in the coils of the blast and all but swept away. North Wind vanished. The wind was roaring along the street. The little girl was scudding before it, her hair flying, while behind her she dragged her broom with which she swept her crossing. Her little legs were going as fast as they could, to keep her from falling.  \"Stop! stop! little girl!\" shouted Diamond, starting in pursuit.  \"I can't!\" wailed the girl. \"The wind won't let me!\"  Diamond ran after her and caught hold of her frock but it tore in his hand. Then he ran fast enough to get in front of her and turning around, caught her in his arms. Just then, he thought he got a glimpse of North Wind turning the corner in front of them. They must go with her of course, and sure enough, when they turned the corner after her, they found it quite quiet there.  \"Now, you must lead me,\" said Diamond. \"You show me the way you must go to get home and I will take care of you.\"  So the little girl put her free hand in his and began to lead him. They went around turning after turning, till they stopped at a cellar-door in a very dirty lane. There the little girl knocked.  \"What an awful place!\" said Diamond. \"I should not like to live here.\"  \"Oh yes, you would, if you had no where else to go!\" answered the girl. \"I only hope they'll let me in.\"  \"Don't they always let you in?\" said Diamond.  \"No, they don't. And then I have to stay in the street all night and scud back to my crossing the first thing in the morning. You see they don't answer, now!\"  \"Well,\" said Diamond, \"I don't want to get in. I want to go back to my mother. Come with me and I will take you to my own home.\"  The little girl thought this would be much better than sitting in the streets all night. So they started off. The trouble was that Diamond was not at all sure that he could find the way without North Wind. But the only thing to do was to try. So they wandered on and on, turning in this direction and that, without any reason for one way more than another. At last, they got out of the thick of the houses into a kind of waste place. By this time, they were both very tired, and Diamond was inclined to cry. For he said to himself that he had not done the little girl any good and he had lost his own way home. But in this, he was wrong for she was far happier in having him with her, and making people happier is one of the best ways of doing them good.  [Illustration: IT WAS THE BACK DOOR OF A GARDEN]  They sat down and rested themselves a little and then went on. After a time, they found themselves on a rising ground that sloped rather steeply on the other side. The moment they reached the top, a gust of wind seized them and blew them down hill as fast as they could run. Nor could Diamond stop before he went bang! against one of the doors in a wall. To his dismay, it burst open. When they came to themselves, they peeped in. It was the back door of a garden.  \"Oh! oh!\" cried Diamond after staring for a few moments. \"I know this place--know it well! It is Mr. Coleman's garden and here I am at home again. Oh, I am so glad! Come in, little girl! Come in with me and my mother will give you some breakfast.\"  \"No, no! I can't!\" said the little girl. \"We have been so long coming. Look up! Don't you see that it is morning now? I must hurry back to my crossing and sweep it and get money to take home or they will beat me! I cannot stay. Good-bye, little boy, good-bye!\"  She started back at once, ran up the hill and disappeared behind it. Diamond called after her and called, but she did not even turn round. He was sorry to see her go but there was no help for it. So when she was gone quite out of sight, he shut the door of the garden as best he could, and ran through the kitchen garden to the stables. And wasn't he glad to get into his own blessed bed again!     CHAPTER III  NORTH WIND SINKS A SHIP   It was some time before he saw North Wind again. He saw the little girl before that but it was only for a moment. It happened in this way. His father was taking the horse, Diamond, to have new shoes put on him, and knowing that little Diamond, like all small boys, liked a ride, he set him on the horse and taking the bridle led the two Diamonds away.  The blacksmith's shop was some distance away, deeper in London. As they crossed the angle of a square, Diamond, who was looking about to see if any one noticed him riding upon the big horse like a man, saw a little girl sweeping a crossing before a lady and holding out her hand for a penny. The lady had no penny and the little girl was disappointed.  Diamond could not stand that. He knew the little girl and he knew that he had a penny in his pocket. He slid off the horse in a sort of tumble and ran to her, holding out the penny. She did not know him at first, but when he smiled at her, she did. He stuffed the penny into her hand and ran back, for he knew his father would not care to wait. After that, he did not see little Nanny for a long time.  He played often now on the lawn of the house next door--Mr. Coleman's lawn--as the summer drew near, warm and splendid. One evening, he was sitting in a little summer-house at the foot of the lawn, before which was a bed of tulips. They were closed for the night but the wind was waving them slightly. All at once, out of one of them, there flew a big buzzing bumblebee.  \"There! That's something done!\" said a voice--a gentle, merry, childish voice but _so_ tiny! \"I was afraid he would have to stay there all night.\"  Diamond looked all about and then he saw the _tiniest_ creature, sliding down the stem of the tulip.  \"Are you the fairy that herds the bees?\" he asked kneeling down beside the tulip bed.  \"I am not a fairy,\" answered the little creature. \"You stupid Diamond, have you never seen me before?\"  As she spoke, a moan of wind bent the tulips almost to the ground and then he"]]]
