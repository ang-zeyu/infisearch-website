But the principles of the constitution afford no sanction to this preference, and the true interests of the country require that it should be abolished; for a tax dependent upon deception must be at best precarious, and must be, sooner or later, diminished by the irresistible diffusion of knowledge. Sound policy requires that the law should be impartially enforced in all cases; and if its penalties were extended to abuses of which it does not now take cognisance, there is no doubt that the revenue would be abundantly benefited.  Another species of fraud, to which I shall at present but briefly advert, and which has increased to so alarming an extent, that it loudly calls for the interference of government, is the adulteration of drugs and medicines.  Nine-tenths of the most potent drugs and chemical preparations used in pharmacy, are vended in a sophisticated state by dealers who would be the last to be suspected. It is well known, that of the article Peruvian bark, there is a variety of species inferior to the genuine; that too little discrimination is exercised by the collectors of this precious medicament; that it is carelessly assorted, and is frequently packed in green hides; that much of it arrives in Spain in a half-decayed state, mixed with fragments of other vegetables and various extraneous substances; and in this state is distributed throughout Europe.  But as if this were not a sufficient deterioration, the public are often served with a spurious compound of mahogany saw-dust and oak wood, ground into powder mixed with a proportion of good quinquina, and sold as genuine bark powder.  Every chemist knows that there are mills constantly at work in this metropolis, which furnish bark powder at a much cheaper rate than the substance can be procured for in its natural state. The price of the best genuine bark, upon an average, is not lower than twelve shillings the pound; but immense quantities of powder bark are supplied to the apothecaries at three or four shillings a pound.  It is also notorious that there are manufacturers of spurious rhubarb powder, ipecacuanha powder,[2] James's powder; and other simple and compound medicines of great potency, who carry on their diabolical trade on an amazingly large scale. Indeed, the quantity of medical preparations thus sophisticated exceeds belief. Cheapness, and not genuineness and excellence, is the grand desideratum with the unprincipled dealers in drugs and medicines.  Those who are familiar with chemistry may easily convince themselves of the existence of the fraud, by subjecting to a chemical examination either spirits of hartshorn, magnesia, calcined magnesia, calomel, or any other chemical preparation in general demand.  Spirit of hartshorn is counterfeited by mixing liquid caustic ammonia with the distilled spirit of hartshorn, to increase the pungency of its odour, and to enable it to bear an addition of water.  The fraud is detected by adding spirit of wine to the sophisticated spirit; for, if no considerable coagulation ensues, the adulteration is proved. It may also be discovered by the hartshorn spirit not producing a brisk effervescence when mixed with muriatic or nitric acid.  Magnesia usually contains a portion of lime, originating from hard water being used instead of soft, in the preparation of this medicine.  To ascertain the purity of magnesia, add to a portion of it a little sulphuric acid, diluted with ten times its bulk of water. If the magnesia be completely soluble, and the solution remains transparent, it may be pronounced _pure_; but not otherwise. Or, dissolve a portion of the magnesia in muriatic acid, and add a solution of sub-carbonate of ammonia. If any lime be present, it will form a precipitate; whereas pure magnesia will remain in solution.  Calcined magnesia is seldom met with in a pure state. It may be assayed by the same tests as the common magnesia. It ought not to effervesce at all, with dilute sulphuric acid; and, if the magnesia and acid be put together into one scale of a balance, no diminution of weight should ensue on mixing them together. Calcined magnesia, however, is very seldom so pure as to be totally dissolved by diluted sulphuric acid; for a small insoluble residue generally remains, consisting chiefly of silicious earth, derived from the alkali employed in the preparation of it. The solution in sulphuric acid, when largely diluted, ought not to afford any precipitation by the addition of oxalate of ammonia.  The genuineness of calomel may be ascertained by boiling, for a few minutes, one part, with 1/32 part of muriate of ammonia in ten parts of distilled water. When carbonate of potash is added to the filtered solution, no precipitation will ensue if the calomel be pure.  Indeed, some of the most common and cheap drugs do not escape the adulterating hand of the unprincipled druggist. Syrup of buckthorn, for example, instead of being prepared from the juice of buckthorn berries, (_rhamnus catharticus_,) is made from the fruit of the blackberry bearing alder, and the dogberry tree. A mixture of the berries of the buckthorn and blackberry bearing alder, and of the dogberry tree, may be seen publicly exposed for sale by some of the venders of medicinal herbs. This abuse may be discovered by opening the berries: those of buckthorn have almost always four seeds; of the alder, two; and of the dogberry, only one. Buckthorn berries, bruised on white paper, stain it of a green colour, which the others do not.  Instead of worm-seed (_artemisia santonica_,) the seeds of tansy are frequently offered for sale, or a mixture of both.  A great many of the essential oils obtained from the more expensive spices, are frequently so much adulterated, that it is not easy to meet with such as are at all fit for use: nor are these adulterations easily discoverable. The grosser abuses, indeed, may be readily detected. Thus, if the oil be adulterated with alcohol, it will turn milky on the addition of water; if with expressed oils, alcohol will dissolve the volatile, and leave the other behind; if with oil of turpentine, on dipping a piece of paper in the mixture, and drying it with a gentle heat, the turpentine will be betrayed by its smell. The more subtile artists, however, have contrived other methods of sophistication, which elude all trials. And as all volatile oils agree in the general properties of solubility in spirit of wine, and volatility in the heat of boiling water, &c. it is plain that they may be variously mixed with each other, or the dearer sophisticated with the cheaper, without any possibility of discovering the abuse by any of the before-mentioned trials. Perfumers assert that the smell and taste are the only certain tests of which the nature of the thing will admit. For example, if a bark should have in every respect the appearance of good cinnamon, and should be proved indisputably to be the genuine bark of the cinnamon tree; yet if it want the cinnamon flavour, or has it but in a low degree, we reject it: and the case is the same with the essential oil of cinnamon. It is only from use and habit, or comparisons with specimens of known quality, that we can judge of the goodness, either of the drugs themselves, or of their oils.  Most of the arrow-root, the fecula of the Maranta arudinacea, sold by druggists, is a mixture of potatoe starch and arrow-root.  The same system of adulteration extends to articles used in various trades and manufactures. For instance, linen tape, and various other household commodities of that kind, instead of being manufactured of linen thread only, are made up of linen and cotton. Colours for painting, not only those used by artists, such as ultramarine,[3] carmine,[4] and lake;[5] Antwerp blue,[6] chrome yellow,[7] and Indian ink;[8] but also the coarser colours used by the common house-painter are more or less adulterated. Thus, of the latter kind, white lead[9] is mixed with carbonate or sulphate of barytes; vermilion[10] with red lead.  Soap used in house-keeping is frequently adulterated with a considerable portion of fine white clay, brought from St. Stephens, in Cornwall. In the manufacture of printing paper, a large quantity of plaster of Paris is added to the paper stuff, to increase the weight of the manufactured article. The selvage of cloth is often dyed with a permanent colour, and artfully stitched to the edge of cloth dyed with a fugitive dye. The frauds committed in the tanning of skins, and in the manufacture of cutlery and jewelry, exceed belief.  The object of all unprincipled modern manufacturers seems to be the sparing of their time and labour as much as possible, and to increase the quantity of the articles they produce, without much regard to their quality. The ingenuity and perseverance of self-interest is proof against prohibitions, and contrives to elude the vigilance of the most active government.  The eager and insatiable thirst for gain, which seems to be a leading characteristic of the times, calls into action every human faculty, and gives an irresistible impulse to the power of invention; and where lucre becomes the reigning principle, the possible sacrifice of even a fellow creature's life is a secondary consideration. In reference to the deterioration of almost all the necessaries and comforts of existence, it may be justly observed, in a civil as well as a religious sense, that \"_in the midst of life we are in death_.\"   FOOTNOTES:  [1] _The Times_, May 18, 1818.

Her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea. However, she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high.  [Illustration]  Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off, and she swam nearer to see what it was: she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.  \"Would it be of any use, now,\" thought Alice, \"to speak to this mouse? Everything is so out-of-the-way down here that I should think very likely it can talk; at any rate, there's no harm in trying.\" So she began, \"O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!\" The Mouse looked at her rather inquisitively and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes, but it said nothing.  \"Perhaps it doesn't understand English,\" thought Alice. \"I dare say it's a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.\" So she began again: \"Où est ma chatte?\" which was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water and seemed to quiver all over with fright. \"Oh, I beg your pardon!\" cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor animal's feelings. \"I quite forgot you didn't like cats.\"  \"Not like cats!\" cried the Mouse in a shrill, passionate voice. \"Would _you_ like cats, if you were me?\"  \"Well, perhaps not,\" said Alice in a soothing tone; \"don't be angry about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah. I think you'd take a fancy to cats, if you could only see her. She is such a dear, quiet thing.\" The Mouse was bristling all over and she felt certain it must be really offended. \"We won't talk about her any more, if you'd rather not.\"  \"We, indeed!\" cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of its tail. \"As if _I_ would talk on such a subject! Our family always _hated_ cats--nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't let me hear the name again!\"  [Illustration: Alice at the Mad Tea Party.]  \"I won't indeed!\" said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation. \"Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs? There is such a nice little dog near our house, I should like to show you! It kills all the rats and--oh, dear!\" cried Alice in a sorrowful tone. \"I'm afraid I've offended it again!\" For the Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went.  So she called softly after it, \"Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we won't talk about cats, or dogs either, if you don't like them!\" When the Mouse heard this, it turned 'round and swam slowly back to her; its face was quite pale, and it said, in a low, trembling voice, \"Let us get to the shore and then I'll tell you my history and you'll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.\"  It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it; there were a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the way and the whole party swam to the shore.  [Illustration]     III--A CAUCUS-RACE AND A LONG TALE   They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank--the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross and uncomfortable.  [Illustration]  The first question, of course, was how to get dry again. They had a consultation about this and after a few minutes, it seemed quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had known them all her life.  At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of some authority among them, called out, \"Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! _I'll_ soon make you dry enough!\" They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the Mouse in the middle.  \"Ahem!\" said the Mouse with an important air. \"Are you all ready? This is the driest thing I know. Silence all 'round, if you please! 'William the Conqueror, whose cause was favored by the pope, was soon submitted to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the Earls of Mercia and Northumbria'--\"  \"Ugh!\" said the Lory, with a shiver.  \"--'And even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable'--\"  \"Found _what_?\" said the Duck.  \"Found _it_,\" the Mouse replied rather crossly; \"of course, you know what 'it' means.\"  \"I know what 'it' means well enough, when _I_ find a thing,\" said the Duck; \"it's generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the archbishop find?\"  The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, \"'--found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the crown.'--How are you getting on now, my dear?\" it continued, turning to Alice as it spoke.  \"As wet as ever,\" said Alice in a melancholy tone; \"it doesn't seem to dry me at all.\"  \"In that case,\" said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, \"I move that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies--\"  \"Speak English!\" said the Eaglet. \"I don't know the meaning of half those long words, and, what's more, I don't believe you do either!\"  \"What I was going to say,\" said the Dodo in an offended tone, \"is that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.\"  \"What _is_ a Caucus-race?\" said Alice.  [Illustration]  \"Why,\" said the Dodo, \"the best way to explain it is to do it.\" First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, and then all the party were placed along the course, here and there. There was no \"One, two, three and away!\" but they began running when they liked and left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However, when they had been running half an hour or so and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called out, \"The race is over!\" and they all crowded 'round it, panting and asking, \"But who has won?\"  This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought. At last it said, \"_Everybody_ has won, and _all_ must have prizes.\"  \"But who is to give the prizes?\" quite a chorus of voices asked.  \"Why, _she_, of course,\" said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one finger; and the whole party at once crowded 'round her, calling out, in a confused way, \"Prizes! Prizes!\"  Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand into her pocket and pulled out a box of comfits (luckily the salt-water had not got into it) and handed them 'round as prizes. There was exactly one a-piece, all 'round.  The next thing was to eat the comfits; this caused some noise and confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back. However, it was over at last and they sat down again in a ring and begged the Mouse to tell them something more.  \"You promised to tell me your history, you know,\" said Alice, \"and why it is you hate--C and D,\" she added in a whisper, half afraid that it would be offended again.  \"Mine is a long and a sad tale!\" said the Mouse, turning to Alice and sighing.  \"It _is_ a long tail, certainly,\" said Alice, looking down with wonder at the Mouse's tail, \"but why do you call it sad?\" And she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the tale was something like this:--      \"Fury said to       a mouse, That          he met in the             house, 'Let               us both go                 to law: _I_                  will prosecute                _you_.--                  Come, I'll               take no denial:              We            must have         the trial;      For really     this morning     I've     nothing     to do.'     Said the      mouse to       the cur,        'Such a         trial, dear            sir, With                no jury                 or judge,                    would                   be wasting                 our              breath.'          'I'll be         judge,        I'll be       jury,'      said     cunning     old      Fury;       'I'll        try         the          whole           cause,           and          condemn        you to     death.'\"  \"You are not attending!\" said the Mouse to Alice, severely. \"What are you thinking of?\"  \"I beg your pardon,\" said Alice very humbly, \"you had got to the fifth bend, I think?\"  \"You insult me by talking such nonsense!\" said the Mouse, getting up and walking away.  \"Please come back and finish your story!\" Alice called after it. And the others all joined in chorus, \"Yes, please do!\" But the Mouse only shook its head impatiently and walked a little quicker.  \"I wish I had Dinah, our cat, here!\" said Alice. This caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the birds hurried off at once, and a Canary called out in a trembling voice, to its children, \"Come away, my dears! It's high time you were all in bed!\" On various pretexts they all moved off and Alice was soon left alone.  \"I wish I hadn't mentioned Dinah! Nobody seems to like her down here and I'm sure she's the best cat in the world!\" Poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very lonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance and she looked up eagerly.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]     IV--THE RABBIT SENDS IN A LITTLE BILL   It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again and looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; Alice heard "]]]
