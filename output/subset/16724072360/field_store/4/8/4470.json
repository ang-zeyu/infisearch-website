And now fierce winds arose, and the ship was driven before the blast so that for days these seafarers thought no more of finding new lands, but only of the safety of their ship.  But at length the wind fell, and the sun shone forth once more.  Then again they saw land, and launching their boat they rowed ashore.  To the eyes of these sea-faring men, who for many days had seen only the wild waste of waters, the land seemed passing fair.  For the grass was green, and as the sun shone upon it seemed to sparkle with a thousand diamonds.  When the men put their hands upon the grass, and touched their mouths with their hands, and drank the dew, it seemed to them that never before had they tasted anything so sweet.  So pleasant the land seemed to Leif and his companions that they determined to pass the winter there.  They therefore drew their ship up the river which flowed into the sea, and cast anchor.  Then they carried their hammocks ashore and set to work to build a house  When the house was finished Leif called his companions together and spoke to them.  \"I will now divide our company into two bands,\" he said, \"so that we may explore the country round about.  One half shall stay at home, and the other half shall explore the land.  But they who go to explore must not go so far away that they cannot return home at night, nor must they separate from each other, lest they be lost.\"  And as Leif said so it was done.  Each day a company set out to explore, and sometimes Leif went with the exploring party, and sometimes he stayed at home.  But each day as evening came they all returned to their house, and told what they had seen.  At length, however, one day, when those who had gone abroad returned, one of their number was missing, and when the roll was called it was found that it was Tyrker the German who had strayed.  Thereat Leif was sorely troubled, for he loved his foster-father dearly.  So he spoke sternly to his men, reproaching them for their carelessness in letting Tyrker separate from them, and taking twelve of his men with him he set out at once to search for his foster-father.  But they had not gone far when, to their great joy, they saw their lost comrade coming towards them.  \"Why art thou so late, oh my foster-father?\" cried Leif, as he ran to him.  \"Why hast thou gone astray from the others?\"  But Tyrker paid little heed to Leif's questions.  He was strangely excited, and rolling his eyes wildly he laughed and spoke in German which no one understood.  At length, however, he grew calmer and spoke to them in their own language. \"I did not go much farther than the others,\" he said. \"But I have found something new.  I have found vines and grapes.\"  \"Is that indeed true, my foster-father?\" said Leif.  \"Of a certainty it is true,\" replied Tyrker. \"For I was born where vines grow freely.\"  This was great news; and all the men were eager to go and see for themselves the vines which Tyrker had discovered.  But it was already late, so they all returned to the house, and waited with what patience they could until morning.  Then, as soon as it was day, Tyrker led his companions to the place where he had found the grapes.  And when Leif saw them he called the land Vineland because of them.  He also decided to load his ship with grapes and wood, and depart homeward.  So each day the men gathered grapes and felled trees, until the ship was full.  Then they set sail for home.  The winds were fair, and with but few adventures they arrived safely at home.  There they were received with great rejoicing.  Henceforth Leif was called Leif the Lucky, and he lived ever after in great honour and plenty, and the land which he had discovered men called Vineland the Good.  In due time, however, Eric the Red died, and after that Leif the Lucky sailed no more upon the seas, for his father's kingdom was now his, and he must needs stay at home to rule his land.  But Leif's brother Thorvald greatly desired to go to Vineland so that he might explore the country still further.  Then when Leif saw his brother's desire he said to him, \"If it be thy will, brother, thou mayest go to Vineland in my ship.\"  At that Thorvald rejoiced greatly, and gathering thirty men he set sail, crossed the sea without adventure, and came to the place where Leif had built his house.  There he and his company remained during the winter.  Then in the spring they set forth to explore the coast.  After some time they came upon a fair country where there were many trees.  When Thorvald saw it he said, \"It is so fair a country that I should like to make my home here.\"  Until this time the Norsemen had seen no inhabitants of the land. But now as they returned to their ship they saw three mounds upon the shore.  When the Norsemen came near they saw that these three mounds were three canoes, and under each were three men armed with bows and arrows, who lay in wait to slay them.  When the Norsemen saw that, they divided their company and put themselves in battle array.  And after a fierce battle they slew the savages, save one who fled to his canoe and so escaped.  When the fight was over the Norsemen climbed upon a, high headland and looked round to see if there were signs of any more savages. Below them they saw several mounds which they took to be the houses of the savages, and knew that it behooved them therefore to be on their guard.  But they were too weary to go further, and casting themselves down upon the ground where they were they fell into a heavy sleep.  Suddenly they were awakened by a great shout, and they seemed to hear a voice cry aloud, \"Awake, Thorvald, thou and all thy company, if ye would save your lives.  Flee to thy ship with all thy men, and sail with speed from this land.\"  So Thorvald and his companions fled speedily to their ship, and set it in fighting array.  Soon a crowd of dark-skinned savages, uttering fearful yells, rushed upon them.  They cast their arrows at the Norsemen, and fought fiercely for some time.  But seeing that their arrows availed little against the strangers, and that on the other hand many of their braves were slain, they at last fled.  Then, the enemy being fled, Thorvald, turning to his men, asked, \"Are any of you wounded?\"  \"Nay,\" they answered, \"we are all whole.\"  \"That is well, \" said Thorvald. \"As for me, I am wounded in the armpit by an arrow.  Here is the shaft.  Of a surety it will cause my death.  And now I counsel you, turn homeward with all speed.  But carry me first to that headland which seemed to me to promise so pleasant a dwelling-place, and lay me there.  Thus it shall be seen that I spoke truth when I wished to abide there.  And ye shall place a cross at my feet, and another at my head, and call it Cross Ness ever after.\"  So Thorvald died.  Then his companions buried him as he had bidden them in the land which had seemed to him so fair.  And as he had commanded they set a cross at his feet and another at his head, and called the place Cross Ness.  Thus the first white man was laid to rest in Vineland the Good.  Then when spring came the Norsemen sailed home to Greenland.  And there they told Leif of all the things they had seen and done, and how his brave brother had met his death.  Now when Leif's brother Thorstein heard how Thorvald had died he longed to sail to Vineland to bring home his brother's body.  So once again Leif's ship was made ready, and with five and twenty tall, strong men Thorstein set forth, taking with him his wife Gudrid.  But Thorstein never saw Vineland the Good.  For storms beset his ship, and after being driven hither and thither for many months, he lost all reckoning, and at last came to land in Greenland once more.  And there Thorstein died, and Gudrid went home to Leif.  Now there came to Greenland that summer a man of great wealth named Thorfinn.  And when he saw Gudrid he loved her and sought her in marriage, and Leif giving his consent to it, Thorfinn and Gudrid were married.  At this time many people still talked of the voyages to Vineland, and they urged Thorfinn to journey thither and seek to find out more about these strange lands.  And more than all the others Gudrid urged him to go.  So at length Thorfinn determined to undertake the voyage.  But it came to his mind that he would not merely go to Vineland and return home again.  He resolved rather to settle there and make it his home.  Thorfinn therefore gathered about sixty men, and those who had wives took also their wives with them, together with their cattle and their household goods.  Then Thorfinn asked Leif to give him the house which he had built in Vineland.  And Leif replied, \"I will lend the house to you, but I will not give it.\"  So Thorfinn and Gudrid and all their company sailed out to sea, and without adventures arrived safely at Leif's house in Vineland.  There they lived all that winter in great comfort.  There was no lack of food either for man or beast, and the cattle they had brought with them roamed at will, and fed upon the wide prairie lands.  All winter and spring the Norsemen dwelt in Vineland, and they saw no human beings save themselves.  Then one day in early summer they saw a great troop of natives come out of the wood.  They were dark and little, and it seemed to the Norsemen very ugly, with great eyes and broad cheeks.  The cattle were near, and as the savages appeared the bull began to bellow.  And when the savages heard that sound they were afraid and fled.  For three whole weeks nothing more was seen of them, after that time however they took courage again and returned.  As they approached they made signs to show that they came in peace, and with them they brought huge bales of furs which they wished to barter.  The Norsemen, it is true, could not understand the language of the natives, nor could the natives understand the Norsemen; but by signs they made known that they wished to barter their furs for weapons.  This, however,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3761"],["title","This Country of Ours (#2)"],["body"," forbade.  Instead he gave them strips of red cloth which they took very eagerly and bound about their heads.  Thorfinn also commanded his men to take milk to the savages.  And when they saw it they were eager to buy and drink it. So that it was said many of them carried away their merchandise in their stomachs.  Thus the days and months passed.  Then one summer day a little son was born to Thorfinn and Gudrid.  They called him Snorri, and he was the first white child to be born on the Continent which later men called the New World.  Thus three years went past.  But the days were not all peaceful.  For quarrels arose between the newcomers and the natives, and the savages attacked the Norsemen and killed many of them.  Then Thorfinn said he would no longer stay in Vineland, but would return to Greenland.  So he and all his company made ready their ship, and sailed out upon the seas, and came at length safely to Greenland.  Then after a time Thorfinn sailed to Iceland.  There he made his home for the rest of his life, the people holding him in high honour. Snorri also, his son who had been born in Vineland, grew to be a man of great renown.  Such are some of the old Norse stories of the first finding of America.  The country which Leif called Helluland was most likely Labrador, Markland Newfoundland, and Vineland Nova Scotia.  Besides these there were many other tales of voyages to Vineland. For after Leif and his brothers many other Vikings of the North sailed, both from Greenland and from Norway, to the fair western lands.  Yet although they sailed there so often these old Norsemen had no idea that they had discovered a vast continent.  They thought that Vineland was merely an island, and the discovery of it made no stir in Europe.  By degrees too the voyages thither ceased.  In days of wild warfare at home the Norsemen forgot the fair western land which Leif had discovered.  They heard of it only in minstrel tales, and it came to be for them a sort of fairy-land which had no existence save in a poet's dream.  But now wise men have read these tales with care, and many have come to believe that they are not mere fairy stories.  They have come to believe that hundreds of years before Columbus lived the Vikings of the North sailed the western seas and found the land which lay beyond, the land which we now call America.  __________      Chapter 2 - The Sea of Darkness and the Great Faith of Columbus     In those far-off times besides the Vikings of the North other daring sailors sailed the seas.  But all their sailings took them eastward.  For it was from the east that all the trade and the riches came in those days.  To India and to far Cathay sailed the merchant through the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean, to return with a rich and fragrant cargo of silks and spices, pearls and priceless gems.  None thought of sailing westward.  For to men of those days the Atlantic Ocean was known as the Outer Sea or the Sea of Darkness. There was nothing to be gained by venturing upon it, much to be dreaded.  It was said that huge and horrible sea-dragons lived there, ready to wreck and swallow down any vessel that might venture near. An enormous bird also hovered in the skies waiting to pounce upon vessels and bear them away to some unknown eyrie.  Even if any foolhardy adventurers should defy these dangers, and escape the horror of the dragons and the bird, other perils threatened them. For far in the west there lay a bottomless pit of seething fire. That was easy of proof.  Did not the face of the setting sun glow with the reflected light as it sank in the west? There would be no hope nor rescue for any ship that should be drawn into that awful pit.  Again it was believed that the ocean flowed downhill, and that if a ship sailed down too far it would never be able to get back again. These and many other dangers, said the ignorant people of those days, threatened the rash sailors who should attempt to sail upon the Sea of Darkness.  So it was not wonderful that for hundreds of years men contented themselves with the well-known routes which indeed offered adventure enough to satisfy the heart of the most daring.  But as time passed these old trade-routes fell more and more into the hands of Turks and Infidels.  Port after port came under their rule, and infidel pirates swarmed in the Indian Ocean and Mediterranean until no Christian vessel was safe.  At every step Christian traders found themselves hampered and hindered, and in danger of their lives, and they began to long for another way to the lands of spice and pearls.  Then it was that men turned their thoughts to the dread Sea of Darkness.  The less ignorant among them had begun to disbelieve the tales of dragons and fiery pits.  The world was round, said wise men.  Why then, if that were so, India could be reached by sailing west as well as by sailing east.  Many men now came to this conclusion, among them an Italian sailor named Christopher Columbus.  The more Columbus thought about his plan of sailing west to reach India, the more he believed in it, and the more he longed to set out.  But without a great deal of money such an expedition was impossible, and Columbus was poor.  His only hope was to win the help and friendship of a king or some other great and wealthy person.  The Portuguese were in those days a sea-faring people, and their ships were to be found wherever ships dared go.  Indeed Prince Henry of Portugal did so much to encourage voyages of discovery that he was called Henry the Navigator.  And although he was by this time dead, the people still took great interest in voyages of discovery. So at length Columbus determined to go to King John of Portugal to tell him of his plans, and ask for his aid.  King John listened kindly enough, it seemed, to what Columbus had to say.  But before giving him any answer he said that he must consult his wise men.  These wise men looked upon the whole idea of sailing to the west to reach the east as absurd.  So King John refused to give Columbus any help.  Yet although most of King John's wise men thought little of the plan, King John himself thought that there was something in it. But instead of helping Columbus he meanly resolved to send out an expedition of his own.  This he did, and when Columbus heard of it he was so angry that he left Portugal, which for more than ten years he had made his home.  He was poor and in debt, so he left the country secretly, in fear of the King, and of those to whom he owed money.  When Columbus thus fled from Portugal, penniless and in debt, he was a man over forty.  He was a bitterly disappointed man, too, but he still clung to his great idea.  So he sent his brother Bartholomew to England to beg King Henry VII to help him, while he himself turned towards Spain.  Bartholomew, however, reached England in an evil hour for his quest.  For Henry VII had but newly wrested the crown from Richard III, and so had no thought to spare for unknown lands.  Christopher also arrived in Spain at an unfortunate time. For the Spaniards were carrying on a fierce warfare against the Moors, and King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella had little thought or money to spare for any other undertaking.  Therefore, although Ferdinand listened to what Columbus had to say, for the time being he could promise no help.  So years passed.  Columbus remained in Spain.  For in spite of all his rebuffs and disappointments he did not despair.  As the court moved from place to place he followed it, hoping always that the day would come when the King and Queen would listen to him, and believe in his great enterprise.  Meanwhile he lived in want and misery, and just kept himself from starvation by making and selling maps.  To the common people he seemed a madman, and as he passed through the streets in his worn and threadbare garments children jeered and pointed fingers of scorn at him.  Yet in spite of mockery and derision Columbus clung to his faith. Indeed it burned in him so strongly that at length he made others share it too, and men who were powerful at court became his friends.  At last the war with the Moors ended victoriously for Spain.  Then these friends persuaded Queen Isabella to listen again to what Columbus had to say.  To this the Queen consented, and when she heard how poor Columbus was she sent him some money, so that he might buy clothes fit to appear at court.  When Columbus heard the good news he was overjoyed.  As quickly as might be he bought new clothes, and mounting upon a mule he rode towards Granada.  But when Columbus arrived he found the court still in the midst of rejoicings to celebrate victory.  Among the light-hearted, gaily dressed throng there was no one who had a thought to spare for the melancholy, white-haired dreamer who passed like a dark shadow amidst them.  With his fate, as it were, trembling in the balance, Columbus had no heart for rejoicing.  So he looked on \"with indifference, almost with contempt.\"  But at length his day came.  At length all the jubilation was over, and Ferdinand and Isabella turned their thoughts to Columbus.  He came before them and talked so earnestly of his great project that they could not but believe in it.  The day was won.  Both King and Queen, but more especially the Queen, were willing to help the great enterprise.  Now however Columbus himself all but wrecked his chances.  He had dreamed so long about this splendid adventure, he was so filled with belief in its grandeur, that he demanded conditions such as would hardly have been granted to the greatest prince in the land.  Columbus demanded that he should be made admiral and viceroy of all the lands he might discover, and that after his death this honour should descend to his son and to his son's son for ever and ever. He also demanded a tenth part of all the pearls, precious stones, gold, silver and spices, or whatever else he might gain by trade or barter.  At these demands the grandees of Spain stood"]]]
