All I would like to see is that they should put an embargo on him,\" Abe said, \"and on his friends, them peace fellers, too.\"  \"Well, I'll tell you,\" Morris commented, \"about them peace fellers, you couldn't blame 'em exactly, because you know how it is with some people: they 'ain't got no control over their feelings, and if they're scared to death, y'understand, they couldn't help showing it, which my poor grandmother, _olav hasholom_, wouldn't allow me to keep so much as a pea-shooter in the house, on account, she says, if the good Lord wills it, even a broomstick could give fire.\"  \"And yet, Mawruss, if burglars would of broke into her home, I bet you she would grabbed the nearest flat-iron and went for 'em with it,\" Abe said, \"so don't insult your grandmother _selig_ by comparing her with them peace fellers which they _oser_ care how many burglars is johnnying the front door just so long as they could hide under the bed.\"  \"At the same time, Abe, there is some of them peace fellers which ain't so much scared as they are contrary, y'understand,\" Morris said. \"Take this here LaFollette, Abe, and that feller's motto is, 'My country--I think she's always wrong--but right or wrong--that's my opinion and I stick to it.' All a United States Senator has got to do is to look like he is preparing to say something, y'understand, and before he can get out so much as 'Brother President and fellow-members of this organization,' LaFollette jumps up and says, 'I'm sorry, but I disagree with you.'\"  \"That must make him pretty popular in the Senate,\" Abe remarked.  \"Popular's no name for it,\" Morris continued. \"There ain't a United States Senator which wouldn't stand willing to dig down and pay for a set of engrossed resolutions out of his own pocket, just so long as Senator LaFollette would resign or something.\"  \"But Senator LaFollette ain't one of them peace fellers, Mawruss,\" Abe said.  \"Sure, I know,\" Morris replied. \"All he wants is to run the war according to Cushing's _Manual_. If he had his way we wouldn't be able to give an order for so much as one-twelfth dozen guns, y'understand, without it come up in the form of a motion that it is regularly moved and seconded that the Secretary of War be and he is hereby authorized to order the same and all those in favor will signify the same by saying aye, y'understand, and even then, Abe, him and Senator Vardaman would call for a show of hands under Section Twelve, Subsection D, of the by-laws.\"  \"Then I suppose if a few thousand American soldiers gets killed on account they 'ain't got the right kind of guns, Mawruss, we could lay it to Section Twelve, Subsection D, of the by-laws,\" Abe suggested.  \"And you could give some of them Senators credit for an assist, Abe, because you take a Senator like that, Abe, and when he holds up the ammunition supply with a two-hour speech, y'understand, he _oser_ worries his head how many American soldiers is going to be killed by the Germans in France six months later, just so long as his own name is spelled right by the newspapers in New York City next morning.\"  \"It would help a whole lot, Mawruss,\" Abe said, \"if Senators and Congressmen was numbered the same like automobiles, y'understand, because who is going to waste his breath arguing that the Senate should pass a law which it's a pipe the Senate ain't going to pass, on account that nobody is in favor of it except himself and a couple of other Senators temporarily absent on the road, making Fargo, Minneapolis, Chicago, and points east as traveling peace conventioners, y'understand, when he knows that next morning the only notice the New York newspapers will take of his _Geschrei_ will be, Among those who spoke in the Senate yesterday was:   D 105-666 WIS  1917   2016 PA.  1917   COMMERCIAL  01-232 N.Y.  1917  \"Well, there's plenty of people which thinks when Governor Lauben wouldn't let them peace fellers run off their convention, y'understand, that it was unconstitutional,\" Morris said.  \"Sure, I know,\" Abe said. \"They're the same people which thinks that anything what helps us and hinders Germany is unconstitutional, including the Constitution. You take them socialist orators, which the only use they've got for soap is the boxes the soap comes in, y'understand, and to hear them talk you would think that the Kaiser sunk the _Lusitania_ pursuant to Article Sixty-one, Section Two, of the Constitution of the United States, Mawruss, whereas when President Wilson sends a message to Congress asking them when they are going to get busy on the war taxes and what do they think this is, anyway--a _Kaffeklatsch_, y'understand--it is all kinds of violations of Articles Sixteen, Thirty-two, O.K. and C.O.D. of the Constitution and that the American people is a lot of weak-livered curs to stand for it, outside of being weak-livered curs, anyway.\"  \"You mean to say we allow these here fellers to get up on soap-boxes and say such things like that?\" Morris exclaimed.  \"We've _got_ to allow them,\" Abe replied. \"The Constitution protects them.\"  \"What do you mean--the Constitution protects them?\" Morris said. \"Here a couple of weeks ago a judge in North Carolina gives out a decision that the Constitution don't protect little children eleven years old from being made to work in factories, y'understand, and now you are trying to tell me that the same Constitution does protect these here loafers! What kind of a Constitution have we got, anyway?\"  \"I don't know, Mawruss, but there's this much about it, anyhow--a lawyer could get more money out of just one board of directors which wants to go ahead and put through the deal if under the Constitution of the United States nobody could do 'em nothing, y'understand, than he could out of all the children which gets injured working in all the cotton-mills south of Mason and Hamlin's line, understand me. So you see, Mawruss, the Constitution not only protects these here soap-box orators, but it also gives 'em something to talk about because when they want to knock the United States and boost Germany, all they need to say is that you've got to hand it to the Germans; if they kill little children, they're, anyhow, foreign children and not German children.\"  \"I suppose a lot of them soap-box orators gets paid by the German government for boosting the Germans the way you just done it, Abe,\" Morris commented, \"which I see that this here Ridder of the _New Yorker Staats-Zeitung_ gives it out that any one what accuses him that he is getting paid by the German government for boosting the Kaiser in his paper would got to stand a suit for liable, because he is too patriotic an American sitson to print articles boosting the Kaiser except as a matter of friendship and free of charge--outside of what he can make by syndicating them to other German newspapers.\"  \"But do them other German newspapers get paid by the German government for reprinting Mr. Ridder's articles?\" Abe asked.  \"_That_ Mr. Ridder don't say,\" Morris replied.  \"Well,\" Abe continued, \"_somebody_ should ought to appreciate the way them German newspapers love the Kaiser, even if it's only a United States District Attorney, Mawruss, because you take it if the shoe pinched on the other foot, and a feller by the name Jefferson W. Rider was running an American newspaper in Berlin, Germany, by the name, we would say, for example, the _Berlin_, _Germany_, _Star-Gazette_, which is heart and soul for Germany and at the same time prints articles by American military experts showing how Germany couldn't win the war, not in a million years, and the sooner the German soldiers realize it the quicker they wouldn't get killed for such a hopeless _Geschaft_, y'understand. Also, nobody has a greater admiration for the Kaiser than the _Berlin_, _Germany_, _Star-Gazette_, understand me, but that if the Kaiser thinks President Wilson is a tyrant, y'understand, then all the _Star-Gazette_ has got to say is, some day when the Kaiser is fixing the ends of his mustache in front of the glass mit candlegrease or whatever such _Chamorrim_ uses on their mustaches to make themselves look like kaisers, y'understand, that the Kaiser should take another look in the mirror and he would see there such a cutthroat tyrant which President Wilson never dreamed of being in Princeton University to the shipping-clerk, even. Also this here _Berlin_, _Germany_, _Star-Gazette_ says that Germany is the land of bluff and that--\"  \"One moment,\" Morris Perlmutter interrupted. \"What are you trying to tell me--that such a newspaper would be allowed to exist in Berlin, Germany?\"  \"I am only giving you a hypo-critical case, Mawruss,\" Abe continued, \"where I am trying to explain to you that if this was Germany it wouldn't be necessary for Mr. Ridder to sue anybody for liable. All he would have to do when they ask him if he's got anything to say why sentence should not be passed, y'understand, is to tell the judge what was his trade before he became an editor, understand me, and they would put him to work at it for the remainder of the war.\"  \"He wouldn't get off so easy as that, even,\" Morris commented. \"Why, what do you suppose they would do to the editor of this here, for example, _Star-Gazette_ if he was to just so much as hint that the Crown Prince couldn't be such a terrible good judge of French ch√¢teau furniture, y'understand, on account he had slipped over on the Berlin antique dealers a lot of reproductions which they had every right to believe was genwine old stuff, as it had been rescued from the flames, packed, and shipped under the Crown Prince's personal supervision? I bet you, Abe, if the paper was on the streets at three-thirty and the sun rose at three-thirty-five, y'understand, the authorities wouldn't wait that long. They'd shoot him at three-thirty-two.\"  \"I know it,\" Abe agreed. \"You see, Mawruss, an editor, a soap-boxer, a cotton-mill owner, or a stock-w"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33357"],["title","Reminiscences of the Thirty-Fourth Regiment, Mass. Vol. Infantry (#1)"],["body"," the Ninth Maryland Regiment, who were only a few miles distant from our encampment at Harper's Ferry. As it proved, the enemy in considerable force, under Gen. Imboden, had made an early and vigorous attack on that Regiment at Charlestown, and captured them bodily, in number about three hundred. Every available man of the Thirty-Fourth was promptly called out, and preceded by a Battery which was stationed near by, we started in pursuit. Often had the wish been expressed that we might see some actual fighting, and at last the wish was to be gratified.  A running fight commenced soon after reaching Charlestown, the Battery which was still in advance, having engaged the enemy just beyond that place. We pushed on, passing at one time the dead body of a soldier, killed during the morning's engagement, and a few miles of rapid marching bring us into close proximity to the foe, as the shells falling within a short distance from our ranks fully prove. Each Company has been assigned the best position allowed by the character of the ground, which is somewhat uneven and obstructed by fences. A lively discharge of musketry is kept up from both sides for a time, but finally ceases. At about this period in the fight, a small body of mounted infantry from the enemy's force charge toward us till but a short space intervenes, and then wheeling easily, soon disappear in the distance. We afterwards learn that the Springfield muskets of one of our wing Companies told with effect on their ranks. The firing has now ceased, and we are ordered to cross the open ground which separates our position from that of the enemy. This is safely accomplished, and it is found that they have again retreated.  Our Commanding Officer now considers that the pursuit has been pushed far enough, and the order is given to return to Harper's Ferry. Marching and resting alternately, we reach our quarters at a late hour, feeling well satisfied with this first experience of actual fighting. Two of the Color Corporals, Clark of Co. K and Gage of Co. E, have laid down their lives; but they died gloriously, and what matters the form in which death comes, if it finds us in the path of duty.    \"Come to the bridal chamber, Death;     Come to the mother, when she feels   For the first time her first-born's breath:    Come when the blessed seals   Which close the pestilence are broke,   And crowded cities wail its stroke;   Come in Consumption's ghastly form;   The earthquake shock, the ocean storm;   Come when the heart beats high and warm,     With banquet song, and dance, and wine,   And thou art terrible: the tear,   The groan, the knell, the pall, the bier,   And all we know, or dream, or fear     Of agony, are thine.   But to the warrior, when his sword     Has won the battle for the free,   Thy voice sounds like a prophet's word,   And in its hollow tones are heard     The thanks of millions yet to be.\"                                         _Halleck._     CHAPTER V.  NEWMARKET.   After a march of some hours, our Regiment had arrived in the vicinity of Newmarket, Va.; not, however, without an occasional shot being exchanged between the light artillery which preceded us and that of the enemy. As we were marched to a position somewhat sheltered by a low ridge, this firing was kept up with vigor. The peculiar tone and expression assumed by our commander, Colonel Wells, as he directed our movements will be remembered by many. \"Don't you see how they are firing at me?\" was his demand, evidently more for its effect on his men than from any special concern as to his own safety.  So passed the afternoon of Saturday, May 14, 1864, and the night, a rainy and uncomfortable one, settled down upon us; but war is no respecter of the stillness of night, and the fact of a foe being close at hand is a great promoter of uneasiness. Suddenly a shot is heard, then a volley, and we are roused up without ceremony; but the alarm proves nothing serious, being caused by a small reconnoitreing party from the enemy. We lie down again, all save the watchful sentinels, and sheltering ourselves from the rain so far as possible, get what sleep may be had under the circumstances. A part of the morning is occupied in putting our arms and ourselves in good fighting condition, though this is a difficult matter in some cases; the rain having, in spite of our care, reached our muskets to some extent.  The quiet is broken by an order to a different position, which order is repeated occasionally during the forenoon, keeping us in motion almost constantly from one point to another. At last, a satisfactory position having been reached, we lie down on our arms for a short time, but soon are ordered to rise and then to load and fire as rapidly as we can. In the meantime, a Battery has been stationed on our right and its guns begin to play on the enemy. After firing several volleys a charge is ordered, and as we advance, the opposing force comes plainly into view. The yells and cheers accompanying this movement make it almost impossible to hear any order from our superior officers, but we finally comprehend that a \"right-about\" is ordered. This is executed, and we retrace our steps for a short distance, still keeping on a line with the colors, while the continuous cheering of the enemy shows that they fully appreciate their advantage. We now begin to feel seriously the effect of the heavy fire, both musketry and artillery, which fills the air with deadly missiles. A prominent field officer is disabled by a severe wound, and as the enemy press close upon us, necessarily falls into their hands; while others who are less injured are supported from the field to receive surgical aid.  The Regiment, having reached a good position, is halted, faced about, and aids in checking the enemy's advance, much to the satisfaction of the wounded, who are making their way to Mt. Jackson, some four miles distant. Night falls, and the sounds of battle are hushed; but this Sabbath day, so disturbed by mortal strife, has proved the last for many who had cherished hopes of \"bright days yet to be.\"    \"And Ardennes waves above them her green leaves,     Dewy with Nature's tear drops, as they pass;   Grieving, if aught inanimate e'er grieves,     Over the unreturning brave: alas!     Ere evening to be trodden like the grass;   Which now beneath them, but above shall grow     In its next verdure, when this fiery mass   Of living valor, rolling on the foe,   And burning with high hope, shall moulder cold and low.\"                                         _Byron._     CHAPTER VI.  INCIDENTS.   It will be remembered by some, that at an early period of our regimental history, a fever for enlistment into the regular army prevailed to a certain extent. The causes which produced this state of things are unknown to the writer, but it seems probable that highly colored statements as to the relative advantages of one branch of the service over another had been employed.  Col. Wells, as the event proved, felt no sympathy with this movement, and had no idea of quietly looking on while his Regiment was depleted in numbers to fill the voracious maw of Uncle Sam. Accordingly, taking his opportunity when they were drawn up for dress parade, he expressed his views in the case in a manner that held the attention of all to the close. That part of his argument which covered the points of promotion and travel, as nearly as can be recalled, was something like this. \"You have been promised opportunities for promotion and travel: as for _travel_, you would have plenty of that, and would have to travel _pretty close to the line_. With regard to promotion in the regular army, there is a regular system of promotion, in which non-commissioned officers only stand a chance of sharing, and they after years of waiting.\" The address, whether from its sarcasm or its sense, was effectual in curing the uneasiness that had prevailed.  At one time, the young and popular Captain of a certain Company saw fit to celebrate his birthday by furnishing his men with an unusual treat. A supply of \"lager\" was secured from a neighboring fort, and placed conveniently in one of the tents, with the understanding that all were welcomed to partake. As the evening advanced a spirit of jollity naturally prevailed, stimulated a little, it may be, by the influence of the Teutonic beverage, till the stentorian voice of Orderly B-- rang out even more loudly than usual, summoning the Company to fall in for evening roll-call, after which quiet was restored, and night settled down peacefully as usual over our camp.  The Company in which occurred the last incident numbered among its original members two, who were truly of a kindred spirit, though of different birth. Once, for some infraction of discipline in which both were concerned, they were compelled to wear \"the wooden shirt,\" and to march back and forth before the Captain's quarters: yet they were far from being disheartened, but with great merriment performed this unusual sentry duty, assisting each other, in case of any accident, with an almost brotherly regard. One of this pair of intimate friends is believed to have died at Andersonville. As to his comrade, many years have passed since the writer last beheld his strongly marked features, and whether he is still in the land of the living is a matter of uncertainty. So drops the curtain over our heroes.    \"All the world's a stage,   And all the men and women merely players:   They have their exits and their entrances;   And one man in his time plays many parts,   His acts being seven ages.\"                                         _Shakspeare._     CHAPTER VII.  IN MEMORIAM.   A few closing words as a tribute to the honored dead. While referring especially to a few names in this connection, no peculiar honor is claimed for them above the large number of their comrades in other Companies whose record is equally honorable; but of those we know best we can, doubtless, best speak.
