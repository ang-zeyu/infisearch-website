The most general mistake probably consists in the idea that      Meteorology, as a science, has no other object but an experimental      acquaintance with the condition of those variable elements which      from day to day constitute the general and vague result of the      state of the _weather_ at any given spot; not considering that ...      when grouped together with others of the same character, [they] may      afford the most valuable aid to scientific generalization.[5]  Forbes goes on to call for a greater emphasis on theory, and the replacement of the many small-scale observatories with \"a few great Registers\" to be adequately maintained by \"great Societies\" or by the government. He suggests that the time for pursuit of theory might be gained from \"the vague mechanical task to which at present they generally devote their time, namely the search for great numerical accuracy, to a superfluity of decimal places exceeding the compass of the instrument to verify.\"  From its founding the British Association sponsored systematic observation at various places. In 1842 it initiated observations at the Kew Observatory, which has continued until today to be the premier meteorological observatory in the British Empire. The American scientist Joseph Henry observed the functioning of an observatory maintained by the British Association at Plymouth in 1837, and when he became Secretary of the new Smithsonian Institution a few years later he made the furtherance of meteorology one of its first objectives.  The Kew Observatory set a pattern for systematic observation in England as, from 1855, did the Smithsonian Institution in the United States. The instruments used differed little from those in use at Mannheim over half a century earlier[6] (fig. 1). They were undoubtedly more accurate, but this should not be overstressed. Forbes had noted in his report of 1832 that some scientists were then calling for a return to Torricelli, for the construction of a temporary barometer on the site in preference to reliance on the then existing manufactured instruments.     The First Self-Registering Instruments   From the middle of the 17th century meteorological observations were recorded in manuscript books known as \"registers,\" many of which were published in the early scientific journals. The most effective utilization of these observations was in the compilation of the history of particular storms, but where a larger synthesis was concerned they tended, as Forbes has shown, to show themselves unsystematic and non-comparable. The principal problems of meteorological observation have been from the outset the construction of precisely comparable instruments and their use to produce comparable records. The former problem has been frequently discussed, and perhaps, as Forbes suggests, overemphasized. It is the latter problem with which we are here concerned.  The idea of mechanizing the process of observation, not yet accomplished in Forbes' time, had been put forward within a little over a decade of the first use of the thermometer and barometer in meteorology. On December 9, 1663, Christopher Wren presented the Royal Society with a design for a \"weather clock,\" of which a drawing is extant.[7] This drawing (fig. 2) shows an ordinary clock to which is attached a pencil-carrying rack, geared to the hour pinion. A discussion of the clock's \"reduction to practice\" began the involvement of Robert Hooke, who was \"instructed\" in September 1664 to make \"a pendulum clock applicable to the observing of the changes in the weather.\"[8] This tribute to Hooke's reputation--and to the versatility of the mechanic arts at this time--was slightly overoptimistic, as 15 years ensued before the clock made its appearance.  [Illustration: Figure 2.--A contemporary drawing of Wren's \"weather clock.\" (Photo courtesy Royal Society of London.)]  References to this clock are frequent in the records of the Royal Society--being mainly periodic injunctions to Hooke to get on with the work--until its completion in May 1679. The description which Hooke was asked to supply was subsequently found among his papers and printed by William Derham as follows:[9]       The weather-clock consists of two parts; _first_, that which      measures the time, which is a strong and large pendulum-clock,      which moves a week, with once winding up, and is sufficient to turn      a cylinder (upon which the paper is rolled) twice round in a day,      and also to lift a hammer for striking the punches, once every      quarter of an hour.       _Secondly_, of several instruments for measuring the degrees of      alteration, in the several things, to be observed. The first is,      the barometer, which moves the first punch, an inch and half,      serving to shew the difference between the greatest and the least      pressure of the air. The second is, the thermometer, which moves      the punch that shews the differences between the greatest heat in      summer, and the least in winter. The third is, the hygroscope,      moving the punch, which shews the difference between the moistest      and driest airs. The fourth is, the rain-bucket, serving to shew      the quantity of rain that falls; this hath two parts or punches;      the first, to shew what part of the bucket is fill'd, when there      falls not enough to make it empty itself; the second, to shew how      many full buckets have been emptied. The fifth is the wind vane;      this hath also two parts; the first to shew the strength of the      wind, which is observed by the number of revolutions in the      vane-mill, and marked by three punches; the first marks every      10,000 revolutions, the second every 1,000, and the third every      100: The second, to shew the quarters of the wind, this hath four      punches; the first with one point, marking the North quarters, viz.      N.: N. by E.: N. by W.: NNE.: NNW.: NE. by N. and N.W. by N.: NE.      and N.W. The second hath two points, marking the East and its      quarters. The third hath three points, marking the South and its      quarters. The fourth hath four points, marking the West and its      quarters. Some of these punches give one mark, every 100      revolutions of the vane-mill.       The stations or places of the first four punches are marked on a      scrowl of paper, by the clock-hammer, falling every quarter of an      hour. The punches, belonging to the fifth, are marked on the said      scrowl, by the revolutions of the vane, which are accounted by a      small numerator, standing at the top of the clock-case, which is      moved by the vane-mill.  What, exactly, were the instruments applied by Hooke to his weather clock? It is not always easy even to guess, because it appears that Wren was actually the first to contrive such a device and seems to have developed nearly as many instruments as Hooke. It might be supposed that Hooke would have adapted to the weather clock his wheel-barometer, introduced in 1667, but it also appears that Wren had described (and perhaps built) a balance barometer before 1667.[10] As to the thermometer, we have no evidence of original work by Hooke, but we do have a description of Wren's self-registering thermometer, a circular, mercury-filled tube in which changes in temperature move \"the whole instrument, like a wheel on its axis.\"[11]  The hygroscope (hygrometer) probably existed in more versions than any other instrument, although we know nothing of any versions by Wren. Hooke may have used his own \"oat-beard\" instrument.[12] Derham follows his description of the clock--which has been quoted above--with a detailed description of a tipping-bucket rain gauge invented by Hooke and used with the clock. He also notes that in 1670 Hooke had described two other types of rain gauge in which a bucket was counterbalanced in one case by a string of bullets and in another by an immersed weight. But here again, Sprat records the invention of a tipping-bucket gauge by Wren before 1667.  Hooke has been generally regarded as the first inventor of an anemometer, in 1662.[13] But this invention was a pressure-plate gauge--that is, a metal plate held with its face against the wind--whereas the gauge used with the weather clock is clearly a windmill type, of which type this may be the first. Wren also had an anemometer, but we have no description of it. Hooke's account does not refer to other instruments which the weather clock is supposed to have had, according to a description quoted by Gunther, which concludes the enumeration of the elements recorded with \"sunshine, etc.\"[14] One can only wish for further information on the mechanism by which the punches--or in Wren's clock, the pencils--were moved. But it is apparent that Hooke's clock was actually used for some time.  [Illustration: Figure 3.--Dolland's \"atmospheric recorder\": 1, siphon and float barometer; 2, balance (?) thermometer; 3, hygrometer; 4, electrometer; 5, float rain gauge; 6, float evaporimeter; 7, suspended-weight wind force indicator; 8, wind direction indicator; 9, clock; 10, receivers for rain gauge and evaporimeter. (From _Official ... Catalogue of the Great Exhibition, 1851,_ London, 1851, pt. 2).]  The 17th century was not entirely unprepared for the idea of such a self-registering instrument. Water clocks and other devices in which natural forces governed a pointer were known in antiquity, as were counters of the type of the odometer. A water clock described in Italy in 1524 was essentially an inversion of one of Hooke's rain gauges, that in which a bucket was balanced against a string of bullets.[15] The mechanical clock also had a considerable history in the 17th century, and had long since been applied to the operations of figures through cams, as was almost certainly the case with the punches in Hooke's clock. Still, the combination of an instrument-actuated pointer with a clock-actuated time-scale and a means of obtaining a permanent"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32482"],["title","The Introduction of Self-Registering Meteorological Instruments (#2)"],["body","represent a group of innovations which certainly ranks among the greatest in the history of instrumentation. It appears that we owe these innovations to Wren and Hooke.  Hooke's clock contributed nothing to the systematization of meteorological observation, and the last record of it appears to have been a note on its \"re-fitting\" in 1690. Its complexity is sufficient reason for its ephemeral history, but complexity in machine design was the fashion of the time and Hooke may have intended no more than a mechanistic _tour de force_. On the other hand, he may have recognized the desideratum to which later meteorologists frequently returned--the need for simultaneous observations of several instruments on the same register. In any case, no instrument so comprehensive seems to have been attempted again until the middle of the 19th century, when George Dolland exhibited one at the Great Exhibition in London (see fig. 3). The weather elements recorded by Dolland's instrument were the same as those recorded by Hooke's, except that atmospheric electricity (unknown in Hooke's time) was recorded and sunshine was not recorded. Striking hammers were used by Dolland for some of the instruments and \"ever pointed pencils\" for the others. Dolland's barometer was a wheel instrument controlling a hammer. His thermometric element consisted of 12 balanced mercury thermometers. Its mode of operation is not clear, but it probably was similar to that of the thermometer developed by Karl Kreil in Prague about the same time (fig. 4). Dolland's wind force indicator consisted of a pressure plate counterbalanced by a string of suspended weights. Altogether, it is not clear that Dolland's instrument was superior to Hooke's, or that its career was longer.[16]  The 171 years between these two instruments were not lacking in inventiveness in this field, but even though inventors set the more modest aim of a self-recording instrument for a single piece of meteorological data, their brain children were uniformly still-born. Then, during the period 1840-1850, we see the appearance of a series of self-registering instruments which were actually used, which were widely adopted by observatories, and which were superseded by superior instruments rather than abandoned. This development was undoubtedly a consequence of the establishment at that time of permanent observatories under competent scientific direction.  Long experience had demonstrated to the meteorologists of the 1840's that the principal obstacle to the success of self-registering instruments was friction. Forbes had indicated that the most urgent need was for automatic registration of wind data, as the erratic fluctuation of the wind demanded more frequent observation than any manual system could accomplish. Two of the British Association's observers produced separate recording instruments for wind direction and force in the late 1830's, a prompt response which suggests that it was not the idea which was lacking. One of these instruments--designed by William Whewell--contained gearing, the friction of which vitiated its utility as it had that of a number of predecessors. The other, designed by A. Follet Osler, was free of gearing; it separately recorded wind pressure and direction on a sheet of paper moved laterally by clockwork. The pressure element was a spring-loaded pressure plate carried around by the vane to face the wind. Both this plate and the vane itself were made to move pencils through linkages of chains and pulleys.[17] Osler's anemometer (fig. 5) deserves to be called the first successful self-registering meteorological instrument; it was standard equipment in British observatories until the latter part of the 19th century when it was replaced by the cup-anemometer of Robinson.  [Illustration: Figure 4.--Kreil's balance thermometer, 1843. (From Karl Kreil, _Magnetische und meteorologische Beobachtungen zu Prag_, Prague, 1843, vol. 3, fig. 1.)]  [Illustration: Figure 5.--Osler's self-registering pressure plate anemometer, 1837. The instrument is shown with a tipping-bucket rain gauge. (From Abbe, _op. cit._ footnote 17.)]  Self-recording barometers and thermometers were more vulnerable to the influence of friction than were wind instruments, but fortunately pressure and temperature were also less subject to sudden fluctuation, and so self-registration was less necessary. Nevertheless, two events occurred in the 1840's which led to the development of self-registering instruments. One event was the development of the geomagnetic observatory, which used the magnetometer, an instrument as delicate as the barometer and thermometer, and (as it then seemed), as subject to fluctuation as the wind vane. The other event was the development of photography, making possible a recording method free of friction. In 1845 Francis Ronalds at Kew Observatory and Charles Brooke at Greenwich undertook to develop apparatus to register the magnetometer, electrometer, thermometer, and barometer by photography.[18] This was six years after Daguerre's discovery of the photographic process. The magnetometers of both investigators were put into use in 1847, and the barometers and thermometers shortly after. They were based on the deflection--by a mirror in the case of the magnetometer and electrometer and by the mercury in the barometer and thermometer--of a beam of light directed against a photographic plate. Brooke exhibited his instruments at the Great Exhibition of 1850, and they subsequently became items of commerce and standard appurtenances of the major observatory until nearly the end of the century (fig. 6). Their advantages in accuracy were finally insufficient to offset the inconvenience to which a photographic instrument was subject.  Before 1850 the British observatories at Kew and Greenwich (the latter an astronomical observatory with auxiliary meteorological activity) had self-registering apparatus in use for most of the elements observed.     Self-Registering Systems   In 1870 the Signal Corps, U.S. Army, took on the burden of official meteorology in the United States as the result of a joint resolution of the Congress and in accordance with Joseph Henry's dictum that the Smithsonian Institution should not become the permanent agency for such scientific work once its permanency had been decided upon. Smithsonian meteorology had not involved self-recording instruments, and neither did that of the Signal Corps at the outset \"because of the expense of the apparatus, and because nothing of that kind was at that time manufactured in this country.\"[19]  But almost immediately after 1870 the Signal Corps undertook an evidently well-financed program for the introduction of self-registration. \"Complete outfits\" were purchased, representing Wild's system, the Kew system as made by Beckley, Hipp's system (fig. 8), Secci's meteorograph (figs. 9, 10), Draper's system, and Hough's printing barograph and thermograph. Of these only the Kew system, the photographic system already mentioned, could have been obtained before 1867.  [Illustration:    Scale about 1-16th.    BAROGRAPH, OR   SELF-RECORDING MERCURIAL BAROMETER, £68.  Figure 6.--Photographic registering mercurial barometer, typical commercial version. (From J. J. Hicks, _Catalogue of ... Meteorological Instruments_, London, n.d., about 1870.)]  Like Kew, Daniel Draper's observatory in Central Park, New York City, was established primarily for meteorological observation.[20] Draper was one of the sons of the prominent scientist J. W. Draper. Hipp was an instrument-maker of Neuchâtel who specialized in precision clocks.[21] The others after whom these \"systems\" were named were directors of astronomical observatories, which were, at this time, the most active centers of meteorological observation. Wild was at the Bern Observatory,[22] Secci at the Papal Observatory, Rome,[23] and George Hough at the Dudley Observatory, Albany, New York.[24] While the Signal Corps seems to have acquired all of the principal \"systems,\" some interesting instruments were developed at still other observatories, notably by Kreil at the astronomical observatory in Prague.[25] The principal impetus for this full-scale mechanization of observation undoubtedly came from the directors of astronomical observatories.  Thus within little more than the decade of the 1860's were developed five new systems of meteorological self-registry that were sufficiently well thought of to be adopted or copied by observatories outside their places of origin. Wild and Draper tell us that it was decided when their respective observatories were established--in 1860 and 1868--that all instruments should be self-registering. Each was obliged to design his own, being dissatisfied with the photographic registers commercially available. The development of these systems would therefore appear to have been due, in part, to the general spread of a conviction that satisfactory instruments were attainable.
