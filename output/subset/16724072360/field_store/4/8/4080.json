It isn't as if you were a professional anthropologist, sir--didn't you give me medical care?\"  \"Yes.... But I do anthropology, too. Medical help--ah--gains the confidence of the people....\"  \"You mean--?\" Chet was at first incredulous, then outraged. \"You mean you're not going to punish them?\"  \"That's right,\" Dr. Pine said, smiling.  \"That's wrong!\" Chet contradicted.  Cheeks burning, he turned to Commander Seymour. \"How about you, sir? Do you want your men chained to a post if they get captured? Do you want me to dismiss three years of torture as a mistake, or something? Do you want--\"  \"Here, here!\" Commander Seymour said. He didn't raise his voice. But as he rose from the cot, Chet rose with him, and found himself at attention. They eyed each other.  \"Relax,\" Dr. Pine suggested. \"Please sit down--both of you.\"  Commander Seymour obeyed his subordinate. But Chet, still standing, still angry, turned hotly on the doctor.  \"I can't just sit and let you talk about rewarding the Agvars for torturing me!\" he cried. \"We don't have to appease them--they can't fight. You don't have to be afraid--\"  \"That'll do, Barfield!\" Commander Seymour was on his feet again, and his tone was sharp. It quieted Chet instantly.  In silence he watched Commander Seymour motion Dr. Pine to follow him out the door. Someone locked it after them.         *       *       *       *       *  Alternately tossing on the cot and pacing the floor, Chet seethed for hours. His first interview with the new C.O., and two bawlings-out in five minutes! Because of Pine--Pine, who kept him confined in this room, seeing no one but the attendants, having his meals alone....  When a day passed, and then two, and he felt his strength returning, Chet was sure that Dr. Pine kept him out of the wardroom and away from the other officers only as punishment. Three years a prisoner--and a prisoner still! By the time Commander Seymour came to see him again, Chet had spent hours plotting revenge.  \"Barfield,\" the commander said, \"Dr. Pine is going--alone--to the village you escaped from. He'll pretend he's you, or someone like you--whichever he can get away with. So here's your chance for a little fresh air--you can guide us to the village.\"  \"Does that mean I go on active duty, sir?\"  \"Not quite. Dr. Pine hasn't released you from sickbay.\"  Pine again! Pine found him good enough to imitate, it seemed, but not good enough to put on duty.  Suddenly Chet saw the possibilities. So Pine was going to impersonate him? Then Pine would be taken for an escaped sacrifice, a prisoner who'd killed a witch-doctor!  Tell him? Huh. Let him find out the hard way! Then even he, yellow as he was, would want revenge on the Agvars. If he survived their welcome....  \"I'll be _glad_ to go, sir,\" Chet said.         *       *       *       *       *  They brought him fatigues, not a dress uniform. But fatigues and shoes--even tight ones--were clothing, at least. And clothing would change his appearance. The Agvars had never seen him dressed, nor, since his first days, with a haircut and shave. Whether Pine's impersonation worked or not, Chet saw no danger for himself in approaching the village. But he wondered how it was to be managed.  He was told the plan when Commander Seymour and Dr. Pine met him outside by the ship's tail. The commander, who was armed, and the doctor, already naked except for a pair of slippers and a sunlamp tan, would go with him by the shortest route direct to the village. But only Dr. Pine would enter it.  Commander Seymour explained Chet's part--and his own. \"Barfield,\" he said, \"I want you to find and point out some kind of game animal they use for food. I count on killing something after we come under the Agvars' observation. That should show off our weapon-superiority--and pave the way for a feast.\"  \"No medical stuff?\" Chet asked sarcastically. \"I thought Dr. Pine was supposed to cure all their ills, not give them indigestion.\"  \"He has to get their confidence before he can treat them,\" Commander Seymour explained seriously. \"And on a strange planet like this, he's taking quite a chance to try treatment at any time: if it fails, they're apt to accuse him of murder!\"  Chet said nothing. But he felt as if he'd drawn a wild card in a poker game.         *       *       *       *       *  They'd entered the woods. Even before that, Dr. Pine had lagged because his slippers kept falling off, and now he brought up the rear. Chet, in the lead, took a last long look at the ship before the trees and mosses cut off his view.  He went on slowed by vague reluctance. He didn't like this forest. The trees dwarfed and oppressed him. Old fears began to stir and gnaw, but at new places.  Perhaps the two men he guided would stand together against him. If so, revenge on one would cut him off from both as sharply as the forest cut him off from the ship....  Well, it was worth it! They hadn't put him on duty, hadn't accepted him as one of themselves.... He couldn't be cut off much more than he was already!  And Seymour might listen to reason. After all, he was a practical man, a leader. And Pine was yellow!  \"What's Pine after, sir?\" Chet asked over his shoulder. \"Why take these risks you've mentioned?\"  \"Well, partly for safety: if we kill any Agvars, we're likely to have to kill them all, or have the survivors to contend with indefinitely. That might cost us some casualties.... And of course there's the research angle, but that's out of my line.\"  \"What's the matter with punishment, sir--discipline? You use discipline on your crew--why not on their enemies?\"  \"Because the men understand the rules and the penalties. The Agvars don't.\"  \"Kill them, sir! That they'll understand!\"  \"No!\" Commander Seymour spoke sharply. \"If they don't fight back, that's cold-blooded slaughter. If they do, it's war. I don't hold with butchery, Barfield, and I certainly won't risk casualties just to give you a cheap feeling of satisfaction!\"  He couldn't escape. Commander Seymour, looking from over Chet's shoulder like a walking sneer, stuck close. But he gave the impression of following a man who smelled bad.  _Was he?_ Chet wondered.  Wondering, he unconsciously hung his head, slowed--stopped. Dr. Pine caught up. He and Commander Seymour, faintly breathless from the trying need to regulate their respiration consciously, looked at Chet questioningly.  Again they were sizing him up. Suddenly Chet wished he could go back to that first interview in the sickbay, and change all the things he'd said.  \"We can't go on!\" he blurted. \"You don't know what you're getting into, Doctor!\"  \"Oh?\" said Dr. Pine agreeably. \"I know more than you think, young feller.\" He smiled encouragingly.  \"That--that I've killed a witch-doctor? That you may be taken for a murderer?\"  \"Sure! You--ah--you talked about it under drugs. We ... weren't spying, Chet. We just wanted you to tell your story without reliving all the agony. It wasn't intended as--ah--a trap....\" He massaged his fingers apologetically.  \"No....\" Chet agreed. \"But-I-was-trying-to-lead-_you_-into-one!\"         *       *       *       *       *  Had he said that aloud? Chet couldn't be sure.  He listened for his own voice. The woods were quiet. His breathing seemed strangely loud. He held it--and heard the Agvars moving in the woods. Rustling, scraping, crackling--grunting their guttural dialog. Crashing! Threatening them!  \"Let's go back!\" he urged, trying to sound casual. But his trail was blocked.  \"Stick around,\" Dr. Pine suggested easily. \"You--ah--you haven't said anything we didn't know. We're going right ahead.\"  \"But why?\" Once more Chet was hotly incredulous. \"To risk your life for a few stray facts? Become a casualty while trying to _avoid_ casualties? It doesn't make sense!\"  Dr. Pine stared at his own hands as if to hide his shyness in them. \"As to the fact-seeking,\" he said slowly, \"well ... it's a matter of opinion. I've lost a few classmates.... Risks in research are commonplace--and accepted as worthwhile by most people....  \"And--ah--peace.... You once called it appeasement, but it isn't, always. Well, look. If we fought those Agvars, somebody'd have to take a patrol into their village and capture prisoners for our Intelligence, right?\"  Chet nodded dumbly.  \"Well, in a way, I--ah--am the peaceful equivalent of that patrol. The--ah--risk I run is less than if we had a war and a patrol skirmish as part of it, though. And why in the world not take for peace a risk we'd routinely accept in war?\"  Why not? But why not minimize it, just the same. The Agvars, invisible but noisy, were all around them, now. At any moment the woods might rain spears.  \"It would be safer with two of us,\" Chet said musingly. \"Your knowledge of anthropology and medicine--mine of the people--\"  \"Barfield, you're still on the sicklist,\" Commander Seymour pointed out. He watched Chet's face for a long moment before adding, \"Still--if you're over your sick-minded need for revenge--it's possible Dr. Pine may find you fit. It's up to him.\"  Chet was afraid to ask directly. He pleaded with his eyes.  Dr. Pine grinned broadly at the both. \"He's ready for duty, sir,\" he said.  Commander Seymour stepped back and scowled. \"All right, Mr. Barfield,\" he barked, \"I'll give you just three minutes to change to the uniform of the day!\"  Chet's jaw dropped. His vision, also downcast, noted the fatigues he wore, the muddy shoes. Then he looked up, saw the twinkle in his C.O.'s eyes, and understood.  In exactly three minutes he made the required change. He would enter the village as he'd left it--in the undress uniform of a Man...."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32748"],["title","Mate in Two Moves (#1)"],["body","out full length, suspended at three points--her higher-than-practical heels on the linoleum tile, her spine and curved hips using only an inch of the chair's edge, and her head tilted over the chair's back. She inhaled from a king-size filter-tip cigarette and blew a feather of smoke at the ceiling.  \"_Yuh!_\" she said finally. Her flat abdomen jumped at the exhaled syllable, and so did her generous breasts under the soft emerald-green street dress.  \"Good _night_!\" Murt closed the door behind him quickly and became aware of a sharp stab of what he defined as pure rut--the first he had suffered in fifteen years.     II   He taxied downtown to the athletic club, where he maintained his three-room apartment. The 20-story building was a citadel of masculinity--no females allowed--and recently it was an especial relief to enter the lobby and leave behind the world of turbulently mixed sexes.  The small but lush entry chamber had a deserted air about it this afternoon. At the room desk, Crumbley, the clerk, handed him his key with a pallid hand and returned to sigh over a colored picture in _Esquire_--it was the \"fold-out\" page, featuring a gorgeous blonde reclining at full length. Crumbley's expression, however, was far from the loose-lipped, lecherous leer that he normally exposed to such art. His eyes had a thin glaze over them, he breathed shallowly and, if Dr. Murt had not known the little man's cynically promiscuous nature so well, he'd have sworn Crumbley was in love.  Upstairs, Murt donned rubber-soled gym shoes and sweat clothes and rode the elevator back down to the gymnasium. Three times a week, he put his muscles through the whole routine-work on the bars, rings, the leather horse, the rope climb and a twenty-lap jog around the balcony racetrack. Afterward, he showered, took a dip in the swimming pool and retired to the health service department for a rubdown and some sunlamp.  Throughout the whole routine, he encountered not a single other member. While Charlie, the husky blond masseur, hammered and kneaded his muscles, Murt reflected on the abating interest in athletics at the club.  \"Are we losing members, Charlie?\" he asked.  \"You'd think so from how dead it is up here,\" Charlie replied. \"But Crumbley says we aren't. The guys just aren't exercising. Can't figure it, Doc. Even with the usual summer slump, it's never been this slow.\"  When he had absorbed all the punishment he could stand, Murt rolled off, went into the ultraviolet room, set an alarm clock and lay down by himself on one of the paper-covered tables. He adjusted the dark goggles and reflected thankfully that he didn't have to go to the beach for his sun and have sand kicked in his face by a procession of predatory females, ogling his long limbs and trying to attract his attention.  The clean smell of ozone was pleasant, the warmth of the lamps relaxed him, and he dozed off. He dreamed that he heard someone else come in and lie down on the next table and, when he raised his head to see who it was, was amazed to discover his assistant, Dr. Phyllis Sutton, stretched out like himself, wearing only shower-sandals and goggles.  The alarm clock wakened him from the disturbing dream. He was sweating profusely and took another shower, using the cold water at full needle force to dispel his shock at his subconscious.         *       *       *       *       *  Wrapping the robe around him, Murt returned to his apartment to dress for dinner. As he snapped the paper laundry band off a clean shirt, he caught himself wondering how old Phyllis Sutton was. Twenty-eight? Thirty? She appeared younger, but she was in her last year of residence to gain her specialty of pathology. That meant over eleven years of school and practice. She was a lovely creature, but she was no child.  He had half an impulse to phone her for dinner, then became lost in studying his own reaction to the thought. Pulse over a hundred, respiration quickening, irregular. There was a tensing of the abdomen, a faint burning in the pit of his stomach.  He remembered the urge at the office, the dream in the sunroom, the sudden sweat that had required five minutes under the cold needle shower.  After so many years of deliberate, scholarly celibacy, what was happening to him?  He stared at the phone. With six motions of one finger, he could dial Phyllis Sutton's face into view, and suddenly he yearned to do that very ridiculous thing.  After staring at her, off and on, for the six months since she had transferred to High Dawn to complete her residency, now he wanted to see her face outside of working hours for some inexplicable reason.  Call her up, date her, take her dancing, proposition her--get this silly feeling off your chest!  Suppose she was busy or refused to go out with him? Suppose she already had a boy friend?  This last thought deepened the burn in the pit of his stomach, and he finished dressing listlessly. To hell with it! This was poker night. If he did succeed in dating his assistant, they'd inevitably talk shop. That was why he enjoyed a night of cards with his six non-medical brother clubmen, once a week. It was refreshing to break away from the professional point of view.  No, he wouldn't sacrifice that for any woman.         *       *       *       *       *  He ate alone, read the paper, joined the poker party at seven o'clock, played six hands of stud, cashed in his chips and returned to his room. In a mood of deep irritation, he found Phyllis Sutton's home phone number and rang it four times with no result.  He thought to try the hospital. She answered from the lab extension on audio only, but her voice and its frankly curious tone sent vertically polarized chills through him.  \"I--I wanted to apologize for my rudeness this afternoon,\" he said with difficulty from a suddenly dry mouth.  There was a brief silence. \"Have you been drinking, Dr. Murt?\" He noticed that she did not call him Sylvester. Why was he so damned thirsty for some little sign of warmth and friendliness from her?  He cleared his throat. \"No, I'm serious. It occurred to me that your interest in the out-clinic problem was commendable, and that I was rather short in my remarks to you.\"  \"Oh! I take it I have your permission to work my project in during the day, then?\"  \"That's right, so long as it doesn't interfere with the routine.\" He sounded stuffy to himself, but he was entirely out of practice in speaking to please a female.  \"Thanks,\" she said wryly, and the conversation ended.  Somehow, the brief talk with her restored his perspective. Once again she was his assistant, and the significance of her as a woman faded. She was a dedicated physician like himself. In another few years, she would find a residency of her own. She had no more inclination to knock off and become a woman than he had to squander his time and energy on attaining the status of family man.         *       *       *       *       *  It was with mounting admiration that he followed her new project in examining blood samples. As they came up from the clinic, she sorted the specimen tubes at once, putting a tiny snip of yellow Scotch tape under the label of each sample that belonged to a patient with the new undiagnosed disorder.  Then, after the requested hemoglobin, blood sugar and other standard tests had been run, she retrieved the samples from the technicians, grouped them in a special rack and devoted every spare minute to further examination.  She centrifuged, precipitated, filtered and stained over and over, using every qualitative procedure in the book. Murt signed her requisitions for exotic reagents and rare stains. He helped her balance out the large centrifuge to get the maximum r.p.m. from it. He let her use the most costly of the fine-porosity filters.  He had little hope of success, but it was good practice for her. She was required to identify every organism she found, bone up on its known effects, then determine that it could not cause the symptoms reported.  She did all this without impairing her usefulness to Murt. When he needed her, she was at his side, dissecting, taking down notes, preparing delicate sections and checking slides before they came to him.  In several weeks, she exhausted all known tests on the first samples. After lunch one day, she turned her palms up. \"_Nichts da!_\" she said, pulling a mashed cigarette from the huge pocket of her white smock.  He glanced at her and swiveled to stare out the window. It was part of his tight campaign to prevent a disastrous recurrence of the emotional tempest he had suffered the day she had begun this research.  \"It was a nice brush-up on your bacteriology,\" he said. \"Have you saved the filtrates?\"  \"Yes, of course. Did I overlook anything?\"  \"Nothing that we could do here, but there's an electron microscope downtown at Ebert Industrial Labs. How about photomicrography? Could be a filtrable virus.\"  He knew that she was aware of the possibility, and also that she was reluctant to ask him for additional funds to go into a virus hunt with the expensive piece of equipment.  \"Wonderful!\" she told him. \"I did hate to ask you, but it would be a shame to waste all that immaculate filtrate.\"     III   A week passed, during which a bulletin from the Government Health Service announced official suspicion that the human race was suffering a mysterious, pandemic affliction which was as yet undiagnosed. Although the symptoms, as reported by hundreds of clinics, were relatively mild, the effect on the nation's economy was growing serious.  Industry and business reported unprecedented absenteeism. Factory supervisors and insurance companies were frantic over the upsurge in accidents. It was estimated that almost fifty per cent of the population exhibited the symptoms of depression, absent-mindedness, insomnia and loss of appetite.  Negligent driving was increasing the highway toll sharply. Educational institutions reported classroom discipline rapidly vanishing."]]]
