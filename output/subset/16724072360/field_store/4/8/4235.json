So before even the temporary organization was formed in Chicago the Libbey Glass Company filed an application for the exclusive right to manufacture glass at the Columbian Exposition.  The problem of erecting a building that should be architecturally in keeping with the surroundings, that should afford every possible comfort to the thousands of daily visitors and still be used as a manufactory, was not an easy matter.  Begun in October, 1892, the admirable building, put up in the Midway Plaisance to show the process of making glass, was finished one week before May 1st following. On that bleak opening day thousands of overshoes were stalled in mud a foot deep before the Administration Building, and the owners went home in some cases almost barefooted.  [Illustration]  But there was an expenditure of $125,000 in an idea, and the investors had no reason to fear weather or neglect. From the opening to the closing of the big front door two million people found their way to this glass house, at which no one threw stones. The trouble was not to get people in, but to keep them out. A mob never benefits itself nor anybody else. To reduce the attendance to reasonable proportions a fee was charged, applicable to the purchase of some souvenir, made perhaps before the buyer's very eyes. Why was this glass house so popular? Because its exhibit displayed the only art industry in actual operation within the Fair grounds.  All people like machinery in motion, and the most curious people on earth are Americans. They want to know how things are made, and, like children, are not content until they have laid their hands on whatever confronts them. \"Please do not touch\" has no terrors for them. In addition to this inborn love of action, there is a fascination about glass blowing and the fashioning of shapeless matter piping hot from the pot that appeals to men and women of all sorts and conditions. With eyes and mouths wide open, thousands stood daily around the circular factory watching a hundred skilled artisans at work. They looked at the big central furnace, in which sand, oxide of lead, potash, saltpetre and nitrate of soda underwent vitrification; they saw it taken out of the pot a plastic mass, which, through long, hollow iron tubes, was blown and rolled and twisted and turned into things of beauty. Here was a champagne glass, there was a flower bowl; now came a decanter, followed by a jewel basket. A few minutes later jugs and goblets and vases galore passed from the nimble fingers of the artisans to the annealing oven below.  [Illustration]  All these creations entered the oven as hot as they came from the last manipulator, but gradually cooled off to the temperature of the atmosphere. Getting used to the hardships of life requires twenty-four hours, during which the trays on which the glass stands are slowly moved from the hot to the temperate end of the oven. This procession was an object lesson in life as well as in glass. \"Make haste slowly or you'll defeat yourself,\" was the burden of the song those things of beauty sang to themselves and to all who listened.  If American cut glass has grown beyond compare, it is largely due to the superior intelligence of American artisans. They have the \"sand\": so, too, have the beautiful hills of Berkshire County, Massachusetts, whence comes the purest quality the whole world has known. The best flint glass exhibited at the Paris Exposition of 1867 owed its excellence to the treasure stowed away in Western Massachusetts.  [Illustration]  The finest American flint glass of the Columbian Exposition found its inspiration in the same part of the old Bay State.  Little did those visitors to the Fair know whence came the hot fires of Libbey's Glass House. They little knew that oil was drawn in pipes from Ohio, and that one hundred and fifty barrels of petroleum lay buried under innocent-looking grass, that looked up and asked not to be trodden under foot.  Of course, had lightning struck those two great hidden tanks of liquid dynamite, we should all have been sent to that bourne whence no World's Fair visitor could have returned.  Seventy-five barrels of oil were burned daily on the Midway Plaisance. How many gallons? Three thousand. Multiply one day's fire by one hundred and eighty days and you discover that the drama of glass at the Fair was the death of fifty-four thousand gallons of petroleum.     EPILOGUE  THE ACTRESS AND THE INFANTA  [Illustration: GEORGIA CAYVAN]  Ever since the era of fairy tales the world has heard of glass slippers. Cinderella wore them and great was the romance thereof. But whoever before 1893 heard of a glass dress, and who conceived such a novel idea?  [Illustration]  From that memorable day in the Garden of Eden when Eve ate that apple, which may literally be called the fruit of all knowledge, woman has been at the bottom of everything: it was a woman who got it into her head that she wanted a glass dress. How did it happen? Thus: In the middle of May, 1893, women from all parts of the earth took Chicago by storm. Theirs was the first of one hundred congresses, and among many artists was Georgia Cayvan, whose record on and off the stage does credit to her head and heart. Of course the clever actress visited the Fair and of course she followed the multitude and found herself watching the process of making American glass. It was not long before Miss Cayvan's quick eye was attracted by an exhibit of spun and woven glass lamp shades.  \"Do you mean to say those shades are spun out of glass?\" she exclaimed; \"the material resembles silk.\"  \"Nevertheless it is glass,\" replied the attendant.  \"Is it possible to make a glass dress?\"  [Illustration]  \"Why not? It is not only possible but eminently feasible.\"  \"Would it be very expensive?\"  \"Twenty-five dollars a yard.\"  This was a deal of money to invest in an experiment, as at least twelve yards are needed for a gown, but when a woman wills she wills, especially when she is intimately acquainted with her own mind. Miss Cayvan knows hers perfectly, and in a few minutes she exacted from the Company a promise not only to spin her many yards of glass cloth for a white evening costume, but she obtained from them the exclusive right to wear glass cloth on the stage. \"It is agreed,\" said actress and manufacturer in chorus, and off hied the former to New York, where at the end of four weeks she received her material direct from the Midway Plaisance. How to make it up was the next question, for Madame la Modiste vowed she wouldn't touch such material with scissors and needles.  [Illustration: INFANTA EULALIA]  As a matter of fact a specialist is needed to cut and sew glass, which differs from other cloths in breaking and wickedly sticking into the hands, so a skillful and artistic young woman employee from Toledo was sent to New York to do what the ordinary seamstress could not. She cut and made the unique costume with which Miss Cayvan sweeps the stage to the edification of feminine and the wonder of masculine eyes.  The fame of that glass gown reached the ears of the Infanta Eulalia, who saw it worn by the ingenious actress and determined to inspect its counterpart set up in a case at the World's Fair. The Midway Plaisance was the Princess's favorite resort in Chicago, and she soon turned her steps toward the glass house she had heard so much about. \"Where's that dress?\" asked the Infanta as she entered the factory. On being conducted to it Eulalia expressed great pleasure, declaring it was the finest thing she had seen at the Fair.  \"Would Your Highness wear such a gown were one made expressly for you?\" she was asked.  [Illustration]  \"Not only would I wear it, but I'd take the greatest delight in telling the story of its manufacture,\" replied the Princess.  Before sailing away to Spain, Eulalia was fitted for her American glass gown, now wears it, and today there hangs in the Libbey Glass Company's private office the following official certificate:       ROYAL HOUSE OF H. R. H. INFANTE DON ANTONIO DE ORLEANS       H. R. H. Infante Antonio de Orleans appoints Messrs. Libbey      and Company of Toledo, Ohio, cut-glass makers to his royal      house, with the use of his royal coat-of-arms for signs,      bills and labels. In fulfillment of the command of His Royal      Highness I present this certificate, signed in Madrid, July      15th, 1893.                   PEDRO JOVER FOVAR                   Superintendent of His Royal Highness's Household    Thus for the first time in the history of an industry almost as old as humanity, glass adorns alike the person of a Royal Princess and the person of a charming actress. Produced at the Court of Spain and on the American stage, am I not justified in calling this memory of a far and near past \"The Drama of Glass\"?                                KATE FIELD     THE DRAMA OF GLASS  BY  KATE FIELD   In every story told of the sights worth seeing at the Columbian Exposition the factory of the Libbey Glass Company, of Toledo, Ohio, has had an important part. It was more than a mere exhibit; it was a practical education in the art of glass making, which, like an easy lesson that follows step by step, from the mixing of the crude material to the completion of the finest piece of cut glass, impressed itself upon the minds of hundred of thousands of visitors.  [Illustration]  Recall in your memory your visit to the World's Fair in 1893. Place yourself upon the Midway Plaisance, directly opposite the Woman's Building. Does your mind picture a stately, beautiful building, with central dome and graceful towers? This was the building of the glass factory to whom the exclusive right to manufacture and sell its products was awarded over many competitors by the Ways and Means Committee of the World's Columbian Exposition. This concession was given because the plan of the Libbey "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34348"],["title","The Drama of Glass (#2)"],["body","Company was a plan of broad ideas, fully meeting the requirement that America should show that the whole world followed her in the manufacture of cut glass.  [Illustration]  How well that Company fulfilled its mission is known to the two million visitors who passed under the deep-recessed semicircular archway, rich with sculptured ornament, that covered the grand entrance to this palace; within, it was like a theatre, where the scenes in the beautiful drama of glass were ever changing. Do you remember that the sides, the dome, the ceiling, were all glitter and sheen with the products of this mystic art, and that from thousands of cut-glass pieces, as from brilliant diamonds, sparkled the prismatic hues?  [Illustration]  Do you remember the roaring furnace a hundred feet high, the melting pots made of the clays of the Old and the New Worlds, mixed by the bare feet in order that they have the requisite consistency? The products of this factory were born of fire. The plastic molten mass that came from the melting furnace, with its heat of 2200 degrees Fahrenheit, was thirty hours before a mixture called by glass makers a \"batch,\" whose chief ingredient was sand from the hills of Massachusetts.  [Illustration]  Did you watch the workmen--the \"gatherer\" and the \"blower,\" with their long, hollow iron pipes? How the \"blower,\" with his trained fingers, gave an easy, constantly swaying motion to the pipe, into which he blew and expanded the hot glass at its end? The tempering oven, through which all glass productions must pass before they will resist changes in temperature or even stand transportation? Did you follow the process of cutting glass; see the wheels like grindstones, driven by steam power? Wheels of stone that come from England and Scotland, and carry with them the old-country names of Yorkshire Flag, New Castle and Craigleith, stones that are very hard and close-grained, capable of retaining a very sharp edge? Wheels of iron, which are used to cut the design in the rough; wheels of wood, cork, felt, and revolving brush wheels, used in finishing and polishing? Did you know that the trained eye of the cutter and his experience were the only guides he had to secure the requisite depth to his cutting; that he must exercise great care and judgment, else the vibration of the glass renders it extremely liable to break, and that an intricate design requires many days of constant manipulation?  Did you watch with interest the making of glass cloth, see how the thread of glass was drawn out and wound on the big wheels that revolved hundreds of times a minute? How the glass thread was woven with the silk thread, producing a pliable glass cloth of soft sheen and lustre, that could be folded, pleated and handled in all ways like cloth?  Do you recall the Crystal Art Room? Did you realize that under that ceiling, bedecked with ten thousand dollars' worth of spun glass cloth, was collected the finest display of cut glass the world had ever seen? Do you remember an old glass punch bowl, used in 1840 by Henry Clay, and that near this relic of ancient glassware was another punch bowl upon which five hundred dollars' worth of labor had been bestowed?  [Illustration]  Did you mark the difference, the deep and brilliant cuttings, how effective they were, how they brought out the beauty and richness of the design? Then, when you examined the hundreds of other articles, the sherbet and punch glasses in Roman shapes, the quaint decanters in Venetian forms, the celery trays, flower vases, and the ice-cream sets and cut-glass dishes for every use, you saw the clearness of the glass itself, and that this deep and brilliant cutting of perfect design, that brought out the beauties of the great punch bowl, was a marked characteristic of the Libbey Cut Glass. Did you not, as an American, feel proud of the progress that your countrymen had made in this old art of glass making?  Since the World's Fair at Chicago, two expositions of the industries of this country, the San Francisco Midwinter Fair and the Atlanta Exposition, have added to the honors and reputation of the cut glass of the Libbey Company. Certain trade-marks and names on silver and china are always looked upon with pleasure and with a feeling that the possessor has the genuine article.  The same thing applies to cut glassware, so as a protection to the public against those who would profit by the reputation of others, the Libbey Glass Company cut their trade-mark--the name Libbey with a sword under it--upon every piece of glass they manufacture.  Half a century in the life of America has added much to the art upon whose brilliant crest, as Miss Field has said, may be found the splendid quarterings of Egypt, Rome, Venice, Germany and Great Britain, and today the United States stands unrivaled in the manufacture of cut glass.  The honor conferred upon the Libbey Glass Company by the committee, in granting to them the exclusive concession to manufacture and sell American glassware within the grounds of the Exposition during the World's Fair, was a great one.  The honors conferred by the San Francisco and Atlanta Expositions are but added proofs that the selection was a proper one. The Libbey Glass Company thus stands today to represent the best the United States produces in cut glass, and the best the United States produces is the world's best.
