Vol. 1 No. 11] (#1)"],["body","discussion of Merriam's account of the distribution of _Geomys lutescens_ in Kansas is given by Swenk (1940:11-12).  Judging by specimens in the University of Kansas Museum of Natural History, _G. bursarius lutescens_ in Kansas is restricted to the northwestern part of the state, reaching southward certainly to Scott County and eastward certainly to Ellis County; precise limits of distribution of this subspecies are unknown. Additional collecting is necessary to determine where the range of _lutescens_ meets the ranges of the other subspecies. The specimens studied are remarkably uniform. One specimen obtained in October, in Trego County, is slightly lighter colored than any other from Kansas. In other characteristics it agrees with specimens from northwestern Kansas and from the type locality.    _Specimens examined._--Total number 32, as follows: _Cheyenne   County_: 23 mi. (by road) NW St. Francis, 3. _Rawlins County_:   2 mi. NE Ludell, 10. _Logan County_: 5 mi. W Elkader, 3; no   locality more precise than county, 1. _Trego County_: Wakeeney,   4; 12 mi.

Size: Large, total    length averaging more than 280 mm. in males and 257 in females;    hind foot averaging 35 mm. or more in males. Skull: Large;    rostrum averaging more than twice as long as wide; sagittal    crest high in males and barely present in females; occiput    vertical when skull is laid top down; least width of braincase    less than    distance from alveolus of upper incisor to middle of lateral    border of P^4 at alveolar border.  _Comparisons._--From _Geomys bursarius lutescens_, _majusculus_ differs as follows: Color darker, Mummy Brown to Prout's Brown instead of Buckthorn Brown. In both sexes: head and body a fifth to a sixth longer; hind foot 5 to 6 per cent longer; skull averaging larger in all parts measured except that premaxillae (in each subspecies) extend equally far posteriorly to nasals; diastema longer in relation to basilar length; rostrum longer relative to its width; sagittal crest higher; rostrum often more depressed distally; angle of suture between maxilla and jugal more obtuse.  From _G. b. bursarius_, according to Swenk (1939:6), _majusculus_ differs in larger size.  From _G. b. illinoensis_, _majusculus_, according to Komarek and Spencer (1931:405), differs in brownish instead of slate-gray coloration and in two cranial characters as follows: Nasals straight-sided instead of shaped like an hour-glass, and superficial canals on palatine extending anteriorly beyond first molar, and from there anteriorly more or less separated. The first of these characters does not always hold; occasional individuals of _majusculus_, for example some from Douglas County, have the nasals shaped like an hour-glass.  From _G. breviceps dutcheri_, _majusculus_ differs in larger size (hind foot more than 33 mm. in males, and 29 in females; basilar length more than 42 mm. in males and 36 in females); dorsal exposure of jugal longer than width of rostrum measured between ventral margins of infraorbital foramina.  From _G. bursarius major_ of southcentral Kansas (for example Harvey County), _majusculus_ differs in slightly darker color, being Mummy Brown instead of Prout's Brown; size larger (in males total length more than 284 mm., hind foot 35 or more, basilar length of skull more than 42, and in females total length 265 or more, hind foot averaging 33 or more, and basilar length 40 or more).  Skull: Averaging larger in all parts measured, except that premaxillae do not extend so far posteriorly to nasals in either males or females; interorbital constriction slightly narrower in adult females; temporal ridges forming a more prominent sagittal crest in adult males (sagittal crest barely present in some adult males of _major_ from Harper County).  _Remarks._--In employing the subspecific name _majusculus_ we are following Swenk (1939:6) who on the basis of larger size differentiated the animals from southeastern South Dakota, the eastern parts of Nebraska and Kansas, and the western and southern parts of Iowa, from _G. bursarius bursarius_ to which he assigned a more northern geographic range. In the absence of comparative materials of the northern subspecies we cannot make an independent decision on the validity of _majusculus_ and recognize that if it is inseparable from _G. b. bursarius_ the latter name will apply to specimens from northeastern Kansas. We are the more uncertain about applying the name _majusculus_ to specimens from eastern Kansas because they average smaller than topotypes. Only at the northeasternmost locality in Kansas (3 mi. N Cummings, Atchison County) do specimens average as large as topotypes of _majusculus_. Farther southward they become progressively smaller in eastern Kansas, and we interpret this as intergradation with the still smaller subspecies _major_, to the southwest. The average external measurements of two adult males from Atchison County are: 321-99-35. Thirty-six miles farther south, in Douglas County, 16 adult males average 289-80-36. From Hamilton, Greenwood County, 80 miles farther southwest, nine adult males average 284-83-35. The maximum total length recorded at these three localities is: Atchison County, 342 (1 of 2 specimens), Douglas County, 308 (1 of 16 specimens), Greenwood County, 357 (in coll. of Dr. Glenn C. Rinker and 1 of 15 males of all ages involved). It will be seen, therefore, that although there is a trend to smaller average size toward the southward, the maximum of 357 millimeters total length at Hamilton exceeds the maximum of 352 millimeters recorded by Swenk (1939:3) among 86 males at Lincoln where the recorded average is largest.  Four specimens from Salina (Debold Farm) are intermediate structurally, as they are also geographically, between _G. b. majusculus_ on the one hand and _Geomys bursarius lutescens_ and _Geomys bursarius major_ on the other hand. In color they agree with _majusculus_, as they do also in width of nasals posteriorly, in more obtuse angle of the rostrum and maxillary arm of the zygomatic arch. They agree with _G. b. lutescens_ in having the occiput inclined anterodorsally, and are intermediate between _majusculus_ and _lutescens_, but nearer the latter in size of skull and in length of the rostrum relative to its width.    _Specimens examined._--Total number, 148, as follows: _Clay   County_: 6 mi.

H. Hildebrand, original number 16.    _Distribution in Kansas._--Southwestern Kansas from Meade   County eastward certainly to Pratt and Clark counties; from   Pawnee County southward probably to the Oklahoma boundary.    _Diagnosis._--Size of body medium; color of upper parts Cinnamon   Brown; skull with occiput strongly inclined anterodorsally in   males.    [Illustration: FIG. 2. Three views of the skull of the type   specimen of _Geomys bursarius industrius_. A. Lateral view; B.   Dorsal view; C. Ventral view. All natural size.]    _Description._--Color: Upper parts Cinnamon Brown, slightly   reddish, but in some specimens collected in September, in   Pawnee County, near (15´ _i_) Ochraceous-Tawny; underparts   usually Wood Brown, somewhat whitish anteriorly; forefeet   white; hind feet and approximately distal half of tail whitish.   Size: Medium (see measurements), total length averaging not   more than 271 mm. in males and 254 in females; hind foot   averaging not more than 35 mm. in males and less than 32 in   females. Skull: In males, least width of braincase equal to   distance from alveolus of incisor to anterior border of   alveolus of first upper molar, occiput strongly inclined   anterodorsally, temporal impressions usually united in a low   sagittal crest, zygomatic arch heavy and curved at level of   jugal bone. In adult females least width of braincase   approximately equal to distance from alveolus of incisor to   anterior border of alveolus of first upper molar (not   premolar); occiput less inclined anterodorsally   than in males; temporal ridges not forming a sagittal crest. In   young females the width of the braincase is more than the   distance between the alveoli of the incisor and first molar.  _Comparisons._--_G. lutescens industrius_ differs from _G. lutescens lutescens_ in: Color darker; least width of braincase not equal to (usually more than) the distance from the alveolus of incisor to the anterior border of the alveolus of the first upper molar.  _G. lutescens industrius_ differs from _G. lutescens jugossicularis_ in: Color slightly darker, the former being Cinnamon Brown instead of Vinaceous Cinnamon, with hairs basally Deep Neutral Gray in upper parts and underparts. Skull: Jugular part of zygomatic arch more curved (convex dorsally) and occiput far more inclined anterodorsally; lower part of mastoidal ridge more prominent.  For comparison with _G. l. major_, see account of that subspecies.  _Remarks._--Judging from the known specimens of this subspecies, it has the smallest geographic range of any of the subspecies in Kansas, but additional collecting in Hodgeman County and counties to the north and west of it may extend the known range in those directions; collecting in Comanche County and in adjoining parts of Oklahoma may extend the known range to the southward.  The anterodorsal inclination of the occiput in males is the one cranial character in which _industrius_ differs from all of the subspecies with adjoining geographic ranges. The existence of this unique (among adjoining subspecies) cranial character is the principal reason for according subspecific status to this animal. Although it has other characters which are fairly uniform over a considerable geographic area, these other characters, namely, Cinnamon Brown color of the upper parts and medium size of the body, after all, are conditions intermediate between those in _jugossicularis_ to the west and those in the darker and larger animals assigned to _major_ to the eastward. Considering the intermediate geographic position of _industrius_, the color and size are approximately what a person would predict by study of only the animals to the west and those to the east. Therefore, the color and size probably are indicative of intergradation between _jugossicularis_ and _major_. Still, there is the anterodorsally inclined occiput in males--a character of a unique sort--and this influences us to give subspecific status to this animal with full recognition of the fact that it is a \"weak\" subspecies as compared with any one of the adjoining subspecies.  Hooper (1940:2) in naming as new _Geomys lutescens jugossicularis_ referred to his new subspecies a skin-only from Meade County State Park. Our more abundant material from there shows the cranial conformation to be that of _industrius_ to which we accordingly assign the specimens. However, with only a skin available, we, too, would have used the name _jugossicularis_ because the color is paler than in other specimens of _industrius_ and this paleness indicates intergradation between the two named subspecies. Specimens from Pratt County are slightly darker than _industrius_ thereby indicating intergradation between _industrius_ and _major_.    _Specimens examined._--Total number, 58, distributed as   follows: _Pawnee County_: Jct.

Top of head, and   sometimes back, darker than rest of upper parts, but no well   defined black stripe; underparts varying from whitish to nearly   Buffy Brown; fore and hind feet and approximately distal half   of tail white. Size: Large (see measurements).

Length   of auditory bulla (from anteroventral edge of paroccipital   process of exoccipital to hamulus of peterygoid), in each sex,   more than 8 mm.; occiput usually vertical when skull is laid   top down; zygomatic arch broadly and squarely spreading,   divergent anteriorly; rostrum averaging less than twice as long   as wide.  _Comparisons._--From _G. bursarius lutescens_, _major_ differs in color darker, premaxillae extending slightly farther posteriorly; temporal impressions usually forming a more well-marked sagittal crest in males; ventral side of zygomatic arch, at level of jugal bone, more curved.  From _G. bursarius majusculus_, _major_ differs in slightly lighter color, smaller size of body; in males, total length less than 284 mm.; hind foot 34 or less; basilar length of skull less than 42; in females total length less than 264, hind foot no more than 33, and basilar length less than 39.  From _G. bursarius industrius_, _major_ differs in color, being Prout's Brown, instead of Cinnamon Brown (less Fuscous); body averaging 10 per cent longer; total length in males from 9 to 9.7 per cent longer, hind foot 9.7 per cent longer on the average; skull averaging larger in all parts measured. Occiput less inclined anterodorsally; top nearly flat, less arched than that of _G. b. industrius_; auditory bulla averaging slightly larger and less inflated.  _Remarks._--Specimens of this subspecies from Norman, Cleveland County, Oklahoma, and Canton, Dewey County, Oklahoma, and most of those from Kansas, are more Fuscous than topotypes and tend toward"]]]
