Even though Liszt moved from Weimar, spending his last years in Budapest, Rome and elsewhere, he was not idle. There was always a circle of people about him. And always his full-hearted, generous nature kept him at work for the good of others. He reminds us of Beethoven who once said, \"Composing is a capital thing. For instance if a friend is in distress and I have no money at hand to help him, I can sit down and compose something which I can sell and so relieve him.\" It seems that Franz Liszt thought the same for he was forever helping someone else.  We have already seen how Liszt looked as he sat at the piano (see picture No. 12). This is Liszt at the conductor's stand. Do you see his baton and the score on the desk? And the position of the left hand? When Liszt conducted the orchestra the players watched every movement of his hands and every look of his eyes so as to play just as he desired.                           [Illustration: No. 17                           LISZT AS CONDUCTOR]  Franz Liszt was kind to all people who came to him. There was one musician, however, for whom he did a great deal. You know him for he composed many operas. One of them is called \"Parsifal.\" Another is \"The Flying Dutchman.\" Place his picture here and write his name beneath.                           [Illustration: No. 18]  Some day the operas of Richard Wagner will give you great pleasure. At first they were not liked by the public. Wagner had few friends and his life was very hard. But Franz Liszt believed in him and in his work. And so he helped him.  At first Wagner did not like Liszt. He once said, \"I never repeated my first call on Liszt.\" By this he meant that he wished the acquaintance to end. When Liszt realized that Wagner did not care to understand him, he tried his best to keep the friendship secure. Liszt never wished to misunderstand another human being. So, it was not long before Wagner's opinion of Liszt changed, for he said, later, \"Through the love of this rarest friend I gained a real home for my art.\"                           [Illustration: No. 19                              LISZT'S HAND]  There is one thing true for us all. We carry our early thoughts along with us all through life. The friends we make from youth and the thoughts we think from youth are always at hand to bless us if we have done wisely.  Once when little Franz was thirteen years old he played before the English King, George IV. Sixty years later we see him again, once more the guest of the English people.  It is pleasant to think of Liszt meeting again and again the friends of his boyhood. When he went to England, on this occasion, he was quite an old man. As he stepped out upon the stage to play, for the last time, everybody, even the people outside of the hall, who could not get in, shouted themselves hoarse. Those within rose to greet him with tears and cheers that are given only to the kings of the earth.                           [Illustration: No. 20                           LISZT IN LATER LIFE]  While we know of this artist chiefly as a great pianist, we shall learn, as we grow older, that he was a great composer as well. He wrote music for piano, for orchestra, for the voice. There are symphonies, masses, oratorios and cantatas. Once, as a boy, he met Franz Schubert in Vienna. In later years he arranged many of Schubert's songs in a truly beautiful way for the piano,--songs like the \"Erl King,\" \"Thou Art My Peace,\" \"Hark, Hark the Lark.\"  So we may end by saying that Franz Liszt was a great man who remained simple and big-hearted all his life, and one whom the world loved for what he did.
