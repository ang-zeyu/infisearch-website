However, lizards from eastern Michoacán (Chinapa, 6 km. N of Tafetan, 6 km. S of Tzitzio, and 19 km. S of Tzitzio) differ slightly from those from the Tepalcatepec Valley; the eastern specimens have fewer dorsal granules and femoral pores, and a higher ratio of dorsal granules between the paravertebral stripes to the number of granules around the body (see Tables 1-3). No large adult males are present in the eastern series; the subadults and small adult males have color patterns like lizards of similar size from the Tepalcatepec Valley. The largest male from the east has a snout-vent length of 110 mm., rows of pale spots, and no trace of brown and tan cross-bars. Specimens of _Cnemidophorus sacki sacki_ of equal size from Guerrero, Morelos, and Puebla in the upper Balsas Basin have a tan dorsum with dark brown cross-bars. The localities in eastern Michoacán are intermediate geographically between the Tepalcatepec Valley and the known range of the nominal subspecies in the upper Balsas Basin. In characters of scutellation specimens from the east are intermediate between _C. sacki sacki_ and _C. sacki zweifeli_ in the Tepalcatepec Valley. However, in coloration the lizards from the east are like those from the Tepalcatepec Valley, but differ distinctly from the nominal subspecies. Therefore, the eastern series is referred to the subspecies _C. sacki zweifeli_.  _Comparisons._--Four other species of _Cnemidophorus_ occur in the Tepalcatepec Valley with _Cnemidophorus sacki zweifeli_. Of these, _C. calidipes_ has a maximum snout-vent length of 79 mm., 66 to 86 dorsal granules, and a light brown dorsum with pale blue spots and vertical bars; _C. communis communis_ has a maximum snout-vent length of 135 mm., 105 to 144 dorsal granules, and a greenish tan dorsum with yellow spots; _C. deppei infernalis_ has a maximum snout-vent length of 84 mm., 91 to 120 dorsal granules, and a striped pattern throughout life; and _C. lineatissimus exoristus_ has a maximum snout-vent length of 98 mm., 108 to 135 dorsal granules, and a middorsal yellow stripe and vertical bars on the flanks. Both _calidipes_ and _communis_ are like _sacki_ in possessing four enlarged supraoculars and enlarged postantebrachials, whereas _deppei_ and _lineatissimus_ have three enlarged supraoculars and granular postantebrachials. Juveniles of _calidipes_ and _sacki_ are alike in coloration but different in the extent of the supraorbital semicircle-series. In _calidipes_ the supraorbital semicircle-series usually are complete, whereas in _sacki_ the series never extended anterior to the posterior edge of the frontal.     ~Table 1.--Variation in the Number of Dorsal Granules            in Three Subspecies of Cnemidophorus sacki~  Key for Table:    No. = Number of Specimens  SD = Standard Deviation    SE  = Standard Error   C/V = Coefficient of Variation  /======================================================================\\ |   ~Population~           | No. |  Range  | Mean |  SD  |  SE  | C/V  | |--------------------------+-----+---------+------+------+------+------| |_sacki sacki_             |     |         |      |      |      |      | |   Entire Sample          | 106 |  88-105 | 96.3 | 4.16 | 0.40 | 3.92 | |   Puebla: Tehuitzingo    |  22 |  88-103 | 95.1 | 4.18 | 0.89 | 4.39 | |   Guerrero: Chilpancingo |  23 |  90-105 | 95.8 | 3.86 | 0.80 | 4.02 | |   Guerrero: Mexcala      |  22 |  90-102 | 96.5 | 3.56 | 0.76 | 3.69 | |   Morelos                |  39 |  89-105 | 97.2 | 4.56 | 0.73 | 4.69 | |                          |     |         |      |      |      |      | |_sacki zweifeli_          |     |         |      |      |      |      | |   Entire Sample          | 191 |  91-117 | 106.2| 5.98 | 0.43 | 3.13 | |   Michoacán: Tafetan     |  21 |  91-116 | 101.4| 8.04 | 1.75 | 7.92 | |   Michoacán: Apatzingán  | 170 |  95-117 | 106.8| 5.42 | 1.32 | 3.19 | |                          |     |         |      |      |      |      | |_sacki occidentalis_[A]   |  62 |  97-118 | 106.3| 4.72 | 0.60 | 7.61 | \\======================================================================/  [Footnote A: Data for _C. sacki occidentalis_ in Tables 1-3 are from Zweifel (1959, Bull.

Both _occidentalis_ and _zweifeli_ have variable, diffuse color patterns in large adults, but _zweifeli_ differs from _occidentalis_ in having a blue spot on the pink throat.  _Ecology._--In the arid Tepalcatepec Valley _Cnemidophorus sacki zweifeli_ lives at elevations of 160 to 1300 meters. In the lower parts of the valley the lizards live primarily in open scrub forests, characterized by deciduous trees offering only partial shade from the sun, especially during the prolonged dry season. Common trees in this scrub forest are _Acacia cymbispina_, _Cercidium plurifoliolatum_, _Mimosa distachya_, and _Prosopis juliflora_.  During the dry season (November through May) adult males apparently aestivate; several large series collected in the winter include only subadults and females. This absence of males is corroborated by personal observations in the Tepalcatepec Valley in April and May. In the summer rainy season the lizards are active in the morning and again in the late afternoon; only _Cnemidophorus calidipes_ is active during the heat of the midday. In some areas of the scrub forest _Cnemidophorus sacki zweifeli_ is found in association with _Cnemidophorus communis communis_. Throughout the scrub forest _C. sacki zweifeli_ occurs with _C. deppei infernalis_. In some of the more dense scrub forest, where _C. sacki zweifeli_ is not so abundant as in the more open forest, it has been taken with _C. lineatissimus exoristus_. In the open _Acacia-Cercidium_ associations on the valley floor _C. sacki zweifeli_ occurs with _C. calidipes_.  This subspecies is not restricted to the scrub forest. On the lower slopes of the Cordillera Volcanica in Michoacán _C. sacki zweifeli_ has been collected in open pine-oak forest near Zirimicuaro and Ziracuaretiro.  _Distribution._--_Cnemidophorus sacki zweifeli_ inhabits the valley of the Río Tepalcatepec in Michoacán and probably extreme southwestern Jalisco, and the western part of the Balsas Basin in Michoacán.
