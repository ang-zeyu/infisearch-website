He finally slept pushed into it by sheer and utter exhaustion. The bells called him awake. The bells started him off again. He tried to talk again to 4901. They avoided him, all of them. But they weren't really alive any more. How long could he maintain some part of himself that he knew definitely was Charles Marquis?  He began a ritual, a routine divorced from that to which all those being indoctrinated were subjected. It was a little private routine of his own. Dying, and then finding that he was not dead.  He tried it many ways. He took more grains of the poison. But he was always alive again.  \"You--4901! Damn you--talk to me! You know what's been happening to me?\"  The man nodded quickly over his little canisters of food-concentrate.  \"This indoctrination--you, the girl--you went crazy when I talked about dying--what--?\"  The man yelled hoarsely. \"Don't ... don't say it! All this--what you've been going through, can't you understand? All that is part of indoctrination. You're no different than the rest of us! We've all had it! All of us. All of us! Some more maybe than others. It had to end. You'll have to give in. Oh God, I wish you didn't. I wish you could win. But you're no smarter than the rest of us. _You'll have to give in!_\"  It was 4901's longest and most coherent speech. Maybe I can get somewhere with him, Marquis thought. I can find out something.  But 4901 wouldn't say any more. Marquis kept on trying. No one, he knew, would ever realize what that meant--to keep on trying to die when no one would let you, when you kept dying, and then kept waking up again, and you weren't dead. No one could ever understand the pain that went between the dying and the living. And even Marquis couldn't remember it afterward. He only knew how painful it had been. And knowing that made each attempt a little harder for Marquis.  He tried the poison again. There was the big stamping machine that had crushed him beyond any semblance of a human being, but he had awakened, alive again, whole again. There was the time he grabbed the power cable and felt himself, in one blinding flash, conquer life in a burst of flame. He slashed his wrists at the beginning of a number of sleep periods.  When he awakened, he was whole again. There wasn't even a scar.  He suffered the pain of resisting the eating bells until he was so weak he couldn't respond, and he knew that he died that time too--from pure starvation.  _But I can't stay dead!_  \"_... You'll have to give in!_\"         *       *       *       *       *  He didn't know when it was. He had no idea now how long he had been here. But a guard appeared, a cold-faced man who guided Marquis back to the office where the fat, pink-faced little Manager waited for him behind the shelf suspended by silver wires from the ceiling.  The Manager said. \"You are the most remarkable prisoner we've ever had here. There probably will not be another like you here again.\"  Marquis' features hung slack, his mouth slightly open, his lower lip drooping. He knew how he looked. He knew how near he was to cracking completely, becoming a senseless puppet of the bells. \"Why is that?\" he whispered.  \"You've tried repeatedly to--you know what I mean of course. You have kept on attempting this impossible thing, attempted it more times than anyone else here ever has! Frankly, we didn't think any human psyche had the stuff to try it that many times--to resist that long.\"  The Manager made a curious lengthened survey of Marquis' face. \"Soon you'll be thoroughly indoctrinated. You are, for all practical purposes, now. You'll work automatically then, to the bells, and think very little about it at all, except in a few stereotyped ways to keep your brain and nervous system active enough to carry out simple specialized work duties. Or while the New System lasts. And I imagine that will be forever.\"  \"Forever....\"  \"Yes, yes. You're immortal now,\" the Manager smiled. \"Surely, after all this harrowing indoctrination experience, you realize _that_!\"  _Immortal. I might have guessed. I might laugh now, but I can't. We who pretend to live in a hell that is worse than death, and you, the Managerials who live in paradise._ We two are immortal.  \"That is, you're immortal as long as we desire you to be. You'll never grow any older than we want you to, never so senile as to threaten efficiency. That was what you were so interested in finding out on Earth, wasn't it? The mystery behind the Managerials? Why they never seemed to grow old. Why we have all the advantage, no senility, no weakening, the advantage of accumulative experience without the necessity of re-learning?\"  \"Yes,\" Marquis whispered.  The Manager leaned back. He lit a paraette and let the soothing nerve-tonic seep into his lungs. He explained.  \"Every one of you political prisoners we bring here want, above everything else, to die. It was a challenge to our experimental social order here. We have no objection to your killing yourself. We have learned that even the will to die can be conditioned out of the most determined rebel. As it has been conditioned out of you. You try to die enough times, and you do die, but the pain of resurrection is so great that finally it is impossible not only to kill yourself, but even to think of attempting it.\"  Marquis couldn't say anything. The memory called up by the mention of self-destruction rasped along his spine like chalk on a blackboard. He could feel the total-recall of sensation, the threatening bursts of pain. \"No....\" he whispered over and over. \"No--please--no--\"  The Manager said. \"We won't mention it anymore. You'll never be able to try any overt act of self-destruction again.\"  The bright light from the ceiling lanced like splinters into the tender flesh of Marquis' eyeballs, danced about the base of his brain in reddened choleric circles. His face had drawn back so that his cheekbones stood out and his nose was beak-like. His irises became a bright painful blue in the reddened ovals of his eyes.  The Manager yawned as he finished explaining. \"Each prisoner entering here has an identification punch-plate made of his unique electro-magnetic vibratory field. That's the secret of our immortality and yours. Like all matter, human difference is in the electro-magnetic, vibratory rates. We have these punch-plates on file for every prisoner. We have one of you. Any dead human body we merely put in a tank which dissolves it into separate cells, a mass of stasis with potentiality to be reformed into any type of human being of which we have an identification punch-plate, you see? This tank of dissociated cells is surrounded by an electro-magnetic field induced from a machine by one of the identification punch-plates. That particular human being lives again, the body, its mind, its life pattern identical to that from which the original punch-plate was made. Each time you have died, we reduced your body, regardless of its condition, to dissociated cells in the tank. The identification punch-plate was put in the machine. Your unique electro-magnetic field reformed the cells into you. It could only be you, as you are now. From those cells we can resurrect any one of whom we have an identification plate.  \"That is all, No. 5274. Now that you're indoctrinated, you will work from now on in the food-mart, because of your experience.\"         *       *       *       *       *  For an undeterminable length of time, he followed the routines of the bells. In the big food-mart, among the hydroponic beds, and the canning machines; among the food-grinders and little belts that dropped cans of food-concentrate into racks and sent them off into the walls.  He managed to talk more and more coherently with No. 4901. He stopped referring to suicide, but if anyone had the idea that Marquis had given up the idea of dying, they were wrong. Marquis was stubborn. Somewhere in him the flame still burned. He wouldn't let it go out. The bells couldn't put it out. The throbbing machines couldn't put it out. And now he had at last figured out a way to beat the game.  During an eating period, Marquis said to 4901. \"You want to die. Wait a minute--I'm talking about something we can both talk and think about. A murder agreement. You understand? We haven't been conditioned against killing each other. It's only an overt act of selfdes--all right, we don't think about that. But we can plan a way to kill each other.\"  4901 looked up. He stopped eating momentarily. He was interested. \"What's the use though?\" Pain shadowed his face. \"We only go through it--come back again--\"  \"I have a plan. The way I have it worked out, they'll never bring either one of us back.\"  That wasn't exactly true. _One_ of them would have to come back. Marquis hoped that 4901 wouldn't catch on to the fact that he would have to be resurrected, but that Marquis never would. He hoped that 4901's mind was too foggy and dull to see through the complex plan. And that was the way it worked.  Marquis explained. 4901 listened and smiled. It was the first time Marquis had ever seen a prisoner smile.  He left what remained of the capsule of poison where 4901 could get it. During one of the next four eating periods, 4901 was to slip the poison into Marquis' food can. Marquis wouldn't know what meal, or what can. He had to eat. The bells had conditioned him that much. And not to eat would be an overt act of self-destruction.  He wasn't conditioned not to accept death administered by another.  And then, after an eating period, 4901 whispered to him. \"You're poisoned. It was in one of the cans you just ate.\"  \"Great!\" almost shouted Marquis. \"All right. Now I'll die by the end of the next work period. That gives us this sleep period and all the next work period. During that time I'll dispose of you as I've said.\"  4901 went to his bed and the bells rang and the dark came and both of them slept.         * "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32906"],["title","Thy Name Is Woman (#1)"],["body","of his wife, the humiliation, the rejection, the abandonment, the impotent rage of loneliness--it all came back to him.  He controlled his emotion somehow. At least he didn't manifest it physically. He crept closer, listened.  \"This was such a sweet idea,\" the woman was whispering. \"Bringing me here to the park tonight. That's why I love you so, Marvin. You're always so romantic.\"  \"How else could I think of you, darling,\" the man said. His voice was cultured, precise, soft, thick with emotion.  \"You're so sweet, Marvin.\"  \"You're so beautiful, darling. I think of you every minute that you're away on one of those space flights. You women are so wonderful to have conquered space, but sometimes I hate the ships that take you away from me.\"  The woman sighed. \"But it's so nice to come back to you. So exciting, so comfortable.\"  The kiss was long and deep. Bowren backed away, almost smashing into the tree. He touched his forehead. He was sweating heavily. His beard dripped moisture. There was a hollow panicky feeling in his stomach. Now he was confused as well as afraid.  Another couple was sitting next to a fountain, and a bubbling brook ran past them, singing into the darkness. Bowren crouched behind a bush and listened. It might have been the man he had just left, still talking. The voice was slightly different, but the dialogue sounded very much the same.  \"It must be wonderful to be a woman, dear, and voyage between the stars. But as I say, I'm glad to stay here and tend the home and mind the children, glad to be here, my arms open to you when you come back.\"  \"It's so wonderful to know that you care so much. I'm so glad you never let me forget that you love me.\"  \"I love you, every minute of every day. Just think--two more months and one week and we will have been married ten years.\"  \"It's so lovely,\" she said. \"It seems like ten days. Like those first thrilling ten days, darling, going over and over again.\"  \"I'll always love you, darling.\"  \"Always?\"  \"Always.\"  The man got up, lifted the woman in his arms, held her high. \"Darling, let's go for a night ride across the desert.\"  \"Oh, you darling. You always think of these little adventures.\"  \"All life with you is an adventure.\"  \"But what about little Jimmie and Janice?\"  \"I've arranged a sitter for them.\"  \"But darling--you mean you--Oh, you're so wonderful. You think of everything. So practical, yet so romantic ... so--\"  He kissed her and ran away, holding her high in the air, and her laughter bubbled back to where Bowren crouched behind the bush. He kept on crouching there, staring numbly at the vacancy the fleeing couple had left in the shadows. \"Good God,\" he whispered. \"After ten years--\"  He shook his head and slowly licked his lips. He'd been married five years.  It hadn't been like this. He'd never heard of any marriage maintaining such a crazy high romantic level of manic neuroticism as this for very long. Of course the women had always expected it to. But the men--  And anyway--_where did the men come from?_         *       *       *       *       *  Bowren moved down a winding lane between exotic blossoms, through air saturated with the damp scent of night-blooming flowers. He walked cautiously enough, but in a kind of daze, his mind spinning. The appearance of those men remained in his mind. When he closed his eyes for a moment, he could see them.  Perfectly groomed, impeccably dressed, smiling, vital, bronze-skinned, delicate, yet strong features; the kind of male who might be considered, Bowren thought, to be able to assert just the right degree of aggressiveness without being indelicate.  Why, he thought, they've found perfect men, their type of men.  He dodged behind a tree. Here it was again. Same play, same scene practically, only the players were two other people. A couple standing arm in arm beside a big pool full of weird darting fish and throwing upward a subdued bluish light. Music drifted along the warm currents of air. The couple were silhouetted by the indirect light. The pose is perfect, he thought. The setting is perfect.  \"You're so wonderful, darling,\" the man was saying, \"and I get so lonely without you. I always see your face, hear your voice, no matter how long you're away.\"  \"Do you? Do you?\"  \"Always. Your hair so red, so dark it seems black in certain lights. Your eyes so slanted, so dark a green they seem black usually too. Your nose so straight, the nostrils flaring slightly, the least bit too much sometimes. Your mouth so red and full. Your skin so smooth and dark. And you're ageless, darling. Being married to you five years, it's one exciting adventure.\"  \"I love you so,\" she said. \"You're everything any woman could want in a husband. Simply everything, yet you're so modest with it all. I still remember how it used to be. Back there ... with the other men I mean?\"  \"You should forget about _them_, my dear.\"  \"I'm forgetting, slowly though. It may take a long time to forget completely. Oh, he was such an unpleasant person, so uninteresting after a while. So inconsiderate, so self-centered. He wasn't romantic at all. He never said he loved me, and when he kissed me it was mere routine. He never thought about anything but his work, and when he did come home at night, he would yell at me about not having ordered the right dinner from the cafelator. He didn't care whether he used hair remover on his face in the mornings or not. He was surly and sullen and selfish. But I could have forgiven everything else if he had only told me every day that he loved me, that he could never love anyone else. The things that you do and say, darling.\"  \"I love you,\" he said. \"I love you, I love you. But please, let's not talk about _him_ anymore. It simply horrifies me!\"  Bowren felt the sudden sickening throbbing of his stomach. The description. Now the slight familiarity of voice. And then he heard the man say, murmuring, \"Lois ... darling Lois....\"  Lois! LOIS!  Bowren shivered. His jowls darkened, his mouth pressed thin by the powerful clamp of his jaws. His body seemed to loosen all over and he fell into a crouch. Tiredness and torn nerves and long-suppressed emotion throbbed in him, and all the rage and suppression and frustration came back in a wave. He yelled. It was more of a sound, a harsh prolonged animal roar of pain and rage and humiliation.  \"Lois ...\" He ran forward.  She gasped, sank away as Bowren hit the man, hard. The man sighed and gyrated swinging his arms, teetering and flipped backward into the pool among the lights and the weird fish. A spray of cold water struck Bowren, sobering him a little, sobered his burst of mindless passion enough that he could hear the shouts of alarm ringing through the trees. He turned desperately.  Lois cringed. He scarcely remembered her now, he realized. She was different. He had forgotten everything except an image that had changed with longing. She hadn't been too impressive anyway, maybe, or maybe she had. It didn't matter now.  He tried to run, tried to get away. He heard Lois' voice, high and shrill. Figures closed in around him. He fought, desperately. He put a few temporarily out of the way with the neurogun, but there were always more. Men, men everywhere. Hundreds of men where there should be no men at all. Well-groomed, strong, bronzed, ever-smiling men. It gave him intense pleasure to crack off a few of the smiles. To hurl the gun, smash with his fists.  Then the men were swarming all over him, the clean faces, the smiling fragrant men, and he went down under the weight of men.  He tried to move. A blow fell hard and his head smashed against the rocks. He tried to rise up, and other blows beat him down and he was glad about the darkness, not because it relieved the pain, but because it curtained off the faces of men.         *       *       *       *       *  After a time it was as though he was being carried through a dim half-consciousness, able to think, too tired to move or open his eyes. He remembered how the men of Earth had rationalized a long time, making a joke out of it. Laughing when they hadn't wanted to laugh, but to hate. It had never been humorous. It had been a war between the sexes, and the women had finally won, destroying the men psychologically, the race physically. Somehow they had managed to go on with a culture of their own.  The war between the sexes had never really been a joke. It had been deadly serious, right from the beginning of the militant feminist movements, long before the last big war. There had always been basic psychological and physiological differences. But woman had refused to admit this, and had tried to be the \"equal\" if not the better of men. For so long woman had made it strictly competitive, and in her subconscious mind she had regarded men as wonderful creatures, capable of practically anything, and that woman could do nothing better than to emulate them in every possible way. There was no such thing as a woman's role unless it had been the same as a man's. That had gone on a long time. And it hadn't been a joke at all.  How ironic it was, there at the last! All of man's work through the ages had been aimed at the stars. And the women had assumed the final phase of conquest!  For a long time women had been revolting against the masculine symbols, the levers, pistons, bombs, torpedoes and hammers, all manifestations of man's whole activity of overt, aggressive power.  The big H-bombs of the last great war had seemed to be man's final symbol, destructive. And after that, the spaceships, puncturing space, roaring outward, the ultimate masculine symbol of which men had dreamed for so long, and which women had envied.  And then only the women could stand the acceleration. It was a physiological fact. Nothing could change it. Nothing but what they had done to Bowren.  All of man's evolutionary struggle, and the women had assumed the climax, assumed all the past wrapped up in the end, usurped the effect, and thereby"]]]
