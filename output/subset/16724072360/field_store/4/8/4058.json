I halloed to him, asking him if he did not know the Yankees were coming.  \"No--are they?\"  \"Yes,\" said I; \"they are not three hundred yards from here.\"  \"Sure enough,\" said he. \"Well, I'll not go. I don't want them to get my horse.\" And although within hearing of their guns, he would stop and look for them. Blissful ignorance! Not knowing, not hearing, he has not suffered the suspense, the fear, that I have for the past forty-eight hours. I walked to the gate. There they came filing up.  I hastened back to my frightened servants and told them that they had better hide, and then went back to the gate to claim protection and a guard. But like demons they rush in! My yards are full. To my smoke-house, my dairy, pantry, kitchen, and cellar, like famished wolves they come, breaking locks and whatever is in their way. The thousand pounds of meat in my smoke-house is gone in a twinkling, my flour, my meat, my lard, butter, eggs, pickles of various kinds--both in vinegar and brine--wine, jars, and jugs are all gone. My eighteen fat turkeys, my hens, chickens, and fowls, my young pigs, are shot down in my yard and hunted as if they were rebels themselves. Utterly powerless I ran out and appealed to the guard.  \"I cannot help you, Madam; it is orders.\"  As I stood there, from my lot I saw driven, first, old Dutch, my dear old buggy horse, who has carried my beloved husband so many miles, and who would so quietly wait at the block for him to mount and dismount, and who at last drew him to his grave; then came old Mary, my brood mare, who for years had been too old and stiff for work, with her three-year-old colt, my two-year-old mule, and her last little baby colt. There they go! There go my mules, my sheep, and, worse than all, my boys [slaves]!  Alas! little did I think while trying to save my house from plunder and fire that they were forcing my boys from home at the point of the bayonet. One, Newton, jumped into bed in his cabin, and declared himself sick. Another crawled under the floor,--a lame boy he was,--but they pulled him out, placed him on a horse, and drove him off. Mid, poor Mid! The last I saw of him, a man had him going around the garden, looking, as I thought, for my sheep, as he was my shepherd. Jack came crying to me, the big tears coursing down his cheeks, saying they were making him go. I said:  \"Stay in my room.\"  But a man followed in, cursing him and threatening to shoot him if he did not go; so poor Jack had to yield. James Arnold, in trying to escape from a back window, was captured and marched off. Henry, too, was taken; I know not how or when, but probably when he and Bob went after the mules. I had not believed they would force from their homes the poor, doomed negroes, but such has been the fact here, cursing them and saying that \"Jeff Davis wanted to put them in his army, but that they should not fight for him, but for the Union.\" No! Indeed no! They are not friends to the slave. We have never made the poor, cowardly negro fight, and it is strange, passing strange, that the all-powerful Yankee nation with the whole world to back them, their ports open, their armies filled with soldiers from all nations, should at last take the poor negro to help them out against this little Confederacy which was to have been brought back into the Union in sixty days' time!  My poor boys! My poor boys! What unknown trials are before you! How you have clung to your mistress and assisted her in every way you knew.  Never have I corrected them; a word was sufficient. Never have they known want of any kind. Their parents are with me, and how sadly they lament the loss of their boys. Their cabins are rifled of every valuable, the soldiers swearing that their Sunday clothes were the white people's, and that they never had money to get such things as they had. Poor Frank's chest was broken open, his money and tobacco taken. He has always been a money-making and saving boy; not infrequently has his crop brought him five hundred dollars and more. All of his clothes and Rachel's clothes, which dear Lou gave her before her death and which she had packed away, were stolen from her. Ovens, skillets, coffee-mills, of which we had three, coffee-pots--not one have I left. Sifters all gone!  Seeing that the soldiers could not be restrained, the guard ordered me to have their [of the negroes] remaining possessions brought into my house, which I did, and they all, poor things, huddled together in my room, fearing every movement that the house would be burned.  A Captain Webber from Illinois came into my house. Of him I claimed protection from the vandals who were forcing themselves into my room. He said that he knew my brother Orrington [the late Orrington Lunt, a well-known early settler of Chicago]. At that name I could not restrain my feelings, but, bursting into tears, implored him to see my brother and let him know my destitution. I saw nothing before me but starvation. He promised to do this, and comforted me with the assurance that my dwelling-house would not be burned, though my out-buildings might. Poor little Sadai went crying to him as to a friend and told him that they had taken her doll, Nancy. He begged her to come and see him, and he would give her a fine waxen one. [The doll was found later in the yard of a neighbor, where a soldier had thrown it, and was returned to the little girl. Her children later played with it, and it is now the plaything of her granddaughter.]  He felt for me, and I give him and several others the character of gentlemen. I don't believe they would have molested women and children had they had their own way. He seemed surprised that I had not laid away in my house, flour and other provisions. I did not suppose I could secure them there, more than where I usually kept them, for in last summer's raid houses were thoroughly searched. In parting with him, I parted as with a friend.  Sherman himself and a greater portion of his army passed my house that day. All day, as the sad moments rolled on, were they passing not only in front of my house, but from behind; they tore down my garden palings, made a road through my back-yard and lot field, driving their stock and riding through, tearing down my fences and desolating my home--wantonly doing it when there was no necessity for it.  Such a day, if I live to the age of Methuselah, may God spare me from ever seeing again!  As night drew its sable curtains around us, the heavens from every point were lit up with flames from burning buildings. Dinnerless and supperless as we were, it was nothing in comparison with the fear of being driven out homeless to the dreary woods. Nothing to eat! I could give my guard no supper, so he left us. I appealed to another, asking him if he had wife, mother, or sister, and how he should feel were they in my situation. A colonel from Vermont left me two men, but they were Dutch, and I could not understand one word they said.  My Heavenly Father alone saved me from the destructive fire. My carriage-house had in it eight bales of cotton, with my carriage, buggy, and harness. On top of the cotton were some carded cotton rolls, a hundred pounds or more. These were thrown out of the blanket in which they were, and a large twist of the rolls taken and set on fire, and thrown into the boat of my carriage, which was close up to the cotton bales. Thanks to my God, the cotton only burned over, and then went out. Shall I ever forget the deliverance?  To-night, when the greater part of the army had passed, it came up very windy and cold. My room was full, nearly, with the negroes and their bedding. They were afraid to go out, for my women could not step out of the door without an insult from the Yankee soldiers. They lay down on the floor; Sadai got down and under the same cover with Sally, while I sat up all night, watching every moment for the flames to burst out from some of my buildings. The two guards came into my room and laid themselves by my fire for the night. I could not close my eyes, but kept walking to and fro, watching the fires in the distance and dreading the approaching day, which, I feared, as they had not all passed, would be but a continuation of horrors.         *       *       *       *       *                                                  NOVEMBER 20, 1864.  This is the blessed Sabbath, the day upon which He who came to bring peace and good will upon earth rose from His tomb and ascended to intercede for us poor fallen creatures. But how unlike this day to any that have preceded it in my once quiet home. I had watched all night, and the dawn found me watching for the moving of the soldiery that was encamped about us. Oh, how I dreaded those that were to pass, as I supposed they would straggle and complete the ruin that the others had commenced, for I had been repeatedly told that they would burn everything as they passed.  Some of my women had gathered up a chicken that the soldiers shot yesterday, and they cooked it with some yams for our breakfast, the guard complaining that we gave them no supper. They gave us some coffee, which I had to make in a tea-kettle, as every coffee-pot is taken off. The rear-guard was commanded by Colonel Carlow, who changed our guard, leaving us one soldier while they were passing. They marched directly on, scarcely breaking ranks. Once a bucket of water was called for, but they drank without coming in.  About ten o'clock they had all passed save one, who came in and wanted coffee made, which was done, and he, too, went on. A few minutes elapsed, and two couriers riding rapidly passed back. Then, presently, more soldiers came by, and this ended the passing of Sherman's army by my place, leaving me poorer by thirty thousand dollars than I was yesterday morning. And a much stronger Rebel!  After the excitement was a little over, I went up to Mrs. Laura's to sympathize with her, for I had no doubt but that her husband was hanged.

The herring is plentiful on the west coast, and trout and salmon in the rivers.     II THE WANDERING NATIONS   BY land and by sea, race after race has come to make the hills of Wales its home.  One race would be short, with dark eyes and black hair; another would be tall, with blue eyes and fair hair.  They came from different countries and along different paths, but each race brought some good with it.  One brought skill in taming animals, until it had at last tamed even the pig and the bee; another brought iron tools to take the place of stone ones.  Another brought the energy of the chase and war, and another a delight in sailing a ship or in building a fortress.  One thing they had in common—they wandered, and they wandered to the west.  From the cold wastes and the dark forests of the north and east, they were ever pushing west to more sunny lands.  As far back as we can see, the great migration of nations to the west was going on.  The islands of Britain were the furthest point they could reach; for beyond it, at that time, no man had dared to sail into the unknown expanse of the ocean of the west.  In the islands of Britain, the mountains of Wales were among the most difficult to win, and it was only the bravest and the hardiest that could make their home among them.  The first races that came were short and dark.  They came in tribes. They had tribal marks, the picture of an animal as a rule; and they had a strange fancy that this animal was their ancestor.  It may be that the local nicknames which are still remembered—such as “the pigs of Anglesey,” “the dogs of Denbigh,” “the cats of Ruthin,” “the crows of Harlech,” “the gadflies of Mawddwy”—were the proud tribe titles of these early people.  Their weapons and tools were polished stone; their hammers and hatchets and adzes, their lance heads and their arrow tips, were of the hardest igneous rock—chipped and ground with patient labour.  The people who come first have the best chance of staying, if only they are willing to learn; hardy plants will soon take the place of tender plants if left alone.  The short dark people are still the main part, not only of the Welsh, but of the British people.  It is true that their language has disappeared, except a few place-names.  But languages are far more fleeting than races.  The loss of its language does not show that a race is dead; it only shows that it is very anxious to change and learn.  Some languages easily give place to others, and we say that the people who speak these languages are good linguists, like Danes and Slavs.  Other languages persist, those who speak them are unwilling to speak any new language, and this is the reason why Spanish and English are so widespread.  After the short dark race came a tall fair-haired people.  They came in families as well as in tribes.  They had iron weapons and tools, and the short dark people could not keep them at bay with their bone-tipped spears and flint-headed arrows.  We know nothing about the struggle between them.  But it may be that the fairy stories we were told when children come from those far-off times.  If a fairy maiden came from lake or mound to live among men, she vanished at once if touched with iron. Is this, learned men have asked, a dim memory of the victory of iron over stone?  The name given to the short dark man is usually Iberian; the name given to the tall fair man who followed him is Celt.  The two learnt to live together in the same country.  The conqueror probably looked upon himself at first as the master of the conquered, then as simply belonging to a superior race, but gradually the distinction vanished.  The language remained the language of the Celt; it is called an Aryan language, a language as noble among languages as the Aran is among its hills.  It is still spoken in Wales, in Brittany, in Ireland, in the Highlands of Scotland, and in the Isle of Man.  It was also spoken in Cornwall till the eighteenth century; and Yorkshire dalesmen still count their sheep in Welsh.  English is another Aryan tongue.  The more mixed a nation is, the more rich its life and the greater its future.  Purity of blood is not a thing to boast of, and no great and progressive nation comes from one breed of men.  Some races have more imagination than others, or a finer feeling for beauty; others have more energy and practical wisdom.  The best nations have both; and they have both, probably, because many races have been blended in their making. There is hardly a parish in Wales in which there are not different types of faces and different kinds of character.  The wandering of nations has never really stopped.  The Celt was followed by his cousins—the Angle and the Saxon.  These, again, were followed by races still more closely related to them—the Normans and the Danes and the Flemings.  They have all left their mark on Wales and on the Welsh character.  The migration is still going on.  Trace the history of an upland Welsh parish, and you will find that, in a surprisingly short time, the old families, high and low, have given place to newcomers.  Look into the trains which carry emigrants from Hull or London to Liverpool on their way west—they have the blue eyes and yellow hair of those who came two thousand years ago.  But this country is no longer their goal, the great continent of America has been discovered beyond.  Fits of longing for wandering come over the Welsh periodically, as they came over the Danes—caused by scarcity of food and density of population, or by a sense of oppression and a yearning for freedom.  An empty stomach sometimes, and sometimes a fiery imagination, sent a crowd of adventurers to new lands.  And it is thus that every living nation is ever renewing its youth.     III ROME   IT is not a spirit of adventure and daring alone that makes a nation. Rome rose to say that it must have the spirit of order and law too.  It rose in the path of the nations; it built the walls of its empire, guarded by the camps of its legions, right across it.  For four hundred years the wandering of nations ceased; the nations stopped—and they began to till the ground, to live in cities, to form states.  The hush of this peace did not last, but the memory of it remained in the life of every nation that felt it.  Unity and law tempered freedom and change.  The name of Rome was made known, and made terrible, through Wales by a great battle fought on the eastern slopes of the Berwyn.  The Romans had conquered the lands beyond the Severn, and had placed themselves firmly near the banks of that river at Glevum and Uriconium.  Glevum is our Gloucester, and its streets are still as the Roman architect planned them.  Uriconium is the burnt and buried city beyond Shrewsbury; the skulls found in it, and its implements of industry, and the toys of its children, you can see in the Shrewsbury Museum.  The British leader in the great battle was Caratacus, the general who had fought the Romans step by step until he had come to the borders of Wales, to summon the warlike Silures to save their country.  We do not know the site of the great battle, though the Roman historian Tacitus gives a graphic description of it.  The Britons were on a hill side sloping down to a river, and the Romans could only attack them in front.  The enemy waded the river, however, and scaled the wall on its further bank; and in the fierce lance and sword fight the host of Caratacus lost the day.  He fled, but was afterwards handed over to the Romans, and taken to Rome, to grace the triumphal procession of the victors.  The battle only roused the Silures to a more fierce resistance, and it cost the Romans many lives, and it took them many years, to break their power.  The strangest sight that met the invaders was in Anglesey, after they had crossed the Menai on horses or on rafts.  The druids tried to terrify them by the rites of their religion.  The dark groves, the women dressed in black and carrying flaming torches, the aged priests—the sight paralysed the Roman soldiers, but only for a moment.  Vespasian—it was he who sent his son Titus to besiege Jerusalem—became emperor in 69.  The war was carried on with great energy, and by 78 Wales was entirely conquered.  Then Agricola, a wise ruler, came.  The peace of Rome was left in the land; and the Welshman took the Roman, not willingly at first, as his teacher and ruler instead of as his enemy.  Towns were built; the two Chesters or Caerlleons (Castra Legionum), on the Dee and the Usk, being the most important from a military point of view.  Roads were made; two along the north and south coasts, to Carmarthen and Carnarvon; two others ran parallel along the length of Wales, to connect their ends.  On these roads towns rose; and some, like Caerwent, were self-governing communities of prosperous people.  Agriculture flourished; the Welsh words for “plough” and “cheese” are “aradr” and “caws”—the Latin _aratrum_ and _caseus_.  The mineral wealth of the country was discovered; and copper mines and lead mines, silver mines and gold mines, were worked.  The “aur” (gold) and “arian” (silver) and “plwm” (lead) of the Welshman are the Latin _aurum_, _argentum_, and _plumbum_.  The Romans allowed the Welsh families and tribes to remain as before, and to be ruled by their own kings and chiefs.  But they kept the defence of the country—the manning of the great wall in the north of Roman Britain, the garrisoning of the legion towns, and the holding of the western sea—in their own hand.  Gradually the power of Rome began to wane, and its hold on distant countries like Britain began to relax.  The wandering nations were gathering on its eastern and northern borders, and its walls and legions at last gave way.  It had not been a kind mother to the nations it had conquered—in war it had been"]]]
