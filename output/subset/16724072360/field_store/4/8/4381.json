Other plants     identified on the area were: common reed grass (_Phragmites     communis_) and slender grass wort (_Salicornia europea_). Black     grass grows on the inner, dryer portions of the marsh, and     cord-grass prefers the wetter portions, growing to the edge of the     water. The marsh-elder bushes mostly are restricted to the mounds     of earth dug from the ditches. Cattails, in general, grow in a     narrow band paralleling, but back a few yards from, the shoreline.     Areas of mixed black grass and cord-grass occurred.       REPTILES      Diamond-backed terrapins (_Malaclemys terrapin_) were the only     reptiles recorded from the study island. Several were taken on     land, but the majority were seen in the waters about the marsh.      On June 27 a black snake (_Coluber constrictor_) was seen in a     bushy area bordering a marsh on the mainland side of Barnegat Bay.     A few Sharp-tailed Sparrows were seen in the same locality and a     singing male (G. E. W. 559) with testes 14 x 8 mm. and a female (G.     E. W. 558) with a brood patch were collected.       MAMMALS      Only two species of mammals, both abundant, were present on the     study island: the meadow vole (_Microtus pennsylvanicus_) and the     muskrat (_Ondatra zibethicus_). The muskrats dug burrows beneath     the level of the water into the banks of the island, used the     ditches as routes to the interior of the marsh and built some small     houses, mostly from cattail stems.       PREDATORS      Unless the above named mammals preyed on the sparrows, all of the     enemies of the colony at Lavallette were avian. Both Crows (_Corvus     brachyrhynchos_) and Fish Crows (_Corvus ossifragus_) visited the     local marshes frequently as did a Marsh Hawk (_Circus cyaneus_). I     watched the Marsh Hawk make many passes at what I thought were     sparrows, but the only animal I ever saw caught by the hawk was a     _Microtus_. The sparrows were alarmed when the hawk appeared,     quickly and silently disappearing into the grass.      At least two nests on the Lavallette Marsh were destroyed by     predators in the course of the breeding season of 1955. One nest of     the Seaside Sparrow was empty when I checked it on July 3; on July     2 it had contained four young, three days old. On July 21 I found a     dead Sharp-tailed Sparrow, approximately three days old, lying on a     patch of matted grass. A hole was in the flank of the bird and     blood was present about the bill. This nestling was not from a nest     under observation.       PASSERINE ASSOCIATES      On the Lavallette marshes the only passerine associates of the two     species of _Ammospiza_ were Song Sparrows (_Melospiza melodia     atlantica_) and Long-billed Marsh Wrens (_Telmatodytes palustris     palustris_). Two pairs of Song Sparrows and less than six pairs of     marsh wrens nested on the study area. One Song Sparrow nest was     found and is plotted on the map (pl. 1, fig. b); the other pair     nested somewhere along the east shore of the island. The Song     Sparrows at the east end of the island obtained most of their food     from the grounds of the Lavallette Yacht Club across fifty yards of     water to the east. The pair that nested in the western portion of     the island fed along the sand fill or along the bases of the     marsh-elder. Their nest was built in the most extensive area of     these bushes; it was placed approximately one foot above the ground     in a small dead bush and gained support and concealment from the     surrounding black grass. Three of the four eggs hatched on June 30,     and the young left the nest on July 11. Both parents fed the     offspring.      The marsh wrens fed and nested in the cattails. I never saw these     wrens away from the cattails.   WINTER STATUS AND SPRING MIGRATION  Ocean County is ten miles south of the area treated in Cruickshank's regional work (1942). He considers both species as rare to casual winter residents. Concerning the spring migration of the Sharp-tailed Sparrow he says (p. 456) \"The first widespread wave never comes before April 25, however, and most of the birds arrive in May.\" He mentions that late May is the height of migration and that stragglers are passing through up to the middle of June. The arrival of the Seaside Sparrow in spring is similar (p. 458): the first widespread movement is in early May, the peak is reached in the third week of the month, and stragglers have been recorded through the second week in June.  I was in the field in Ocean County almost daily all spring and found no Seaside Sparrows and only two Sharp-tailed Sparrows north of Barnegat Inlet, Ocean County, before May 5. I waded through the marshes at Chadwick, Lavallette, and Island Beach State Park on April 27 when high tides covered all of the dense vegetation and saw no sparrows of the Genus _Ammospiza_. If many had been present on this date I would have seen them. On May 5 both species were plentiful on the Chadwick marshes. Furthermore, the Seaside Sparrows were defending territories. The absence of the two species the previous day indicates a large nocturnal flight.  It was during the second and third weeks in May that the sparrows of this genus were most abundant. In this period many unbanded Seaside Sparrows were in the patches of cattails that were being defended by the resident males from other territory-holders.  One _Ammospiza caudacuta subvirgata_ (G. E. W. 545) was taken in the course of the study. It was a female (ovary: 7 x 5 mm.) weighing 15.3 grams (\"moderate fat\"), taken on June 8, 1955, on a marsh near the mouth of the Manasquan River on the Monmouth-Ocean County line. This marsh is decidedly less brackish than the Lavallette and Chadwick marshes. The specimen was the only _Ammospiza_ seen there and was probably a migrant, despite the late date; this subspecies is known to occur late along the Atlantic Coast south of its breeding range. Cruickshank (1942:454-455) considers the peak of spring migration for this subspecies to be reached in late May.  To find _A. c. subvirgata_ in a marsh seemingly not saline enough for the nominate race is not surprising. _A. c. subvirgata_ breeds in marshes, along the coast of New England, which are almost fresh water (Montagna, 1942b:256). _A. c. caudacuta_ is only casual away from salt water.   TERRITORY  In a general treatise on the subject of territorialism, Nice (1933:98), summarizing Howard, stated: \"Territory implies in the male bird isolation, advertisement, fixation, and intolerance.\" I concluded from my observations that all four requirements are exhibited by male Seaside Sparrows while none of them is well developed in male Sharp-tailed Sparrows. This subject is discussed separately for the two species.  Tomkins (1941:38-51) studied populations of _Ammospiza maritima macgillivrayii_ near the mouth of the Savannah River in South Carolina and Georgia and concluded that this form is not territorial. In support of his conclusions, he quoted Nice (1933:90-91) as follows: \"Territory cannot mean just the nest spot when the adults feed in common; this may be 'nest territory,' but it is a very different matter from a territory in its strict sense to which parents confine themselves during the breeding season. Again, the very essence of a territory lies in its exclusiveness; if a bird's range is not defended, it is not a territory.\"  The feeding and nesting grounds of breeding Seaside Sparrows are often separated by a portion of the marsh which is not used by the birds. This complicates study of the territorial habits of the species. It does not mean, however, that the species is not territorial.  The birds studied by Tomkins had separate feeding and nesting grounds. Concerning this, Tomkins (1941:43) states that \"The Seaside Sparrows of this locality [Savannah River area] often live where the two requirements [adequate feeding grounds and suitable nesting cover] are not always together or even meeting, but also where the feeding grounds and the nesting place are separated by a short distance.\"  Six of the eight original pairs of breeding Seaside Sparrows of the Lavallette colony fed in areas separate from those in which they nested. I found the eight nests of the original residents and banded and dyed all of the adults. The owners of two nests did not have separate nesting and feeding areas. One nest was built within fifteen feet of the south shore of the island, adjacent to the feeding area. The other was built within a few feet of the north shore. The female of this nest obtained food along the shore in the immediate vicinity of the nest. Her mate was absent; in all probability it was the singing male which I took from a nearby bush, before I found it advantageous to use the island as a study area.  The remaining six pairs flew to the south or west shores of the island in order to feed. None of these six nests was more than 100 yards from the feeding grounds (pl. 1, fig. b).  It was comparatively easy to see that the males defended an area surrounding the nest. It was more difficult to see that the pairs fed on separate plots of shoreline, each defended by the male, but I am convinced that this was the case.  The nest area was defended by the males through singing and chasing. I saw no instances of a female entering into territorial disputes; nevertheless, I did see a female chase a Sharp-tailed Sparrow away from the vicinity of her nest.  Tomkins (1941:46) did not consider the song of _A. m. macgillivrayii_ to be \"a declaration warning other birds away.\" After observing the behavior of males of _A. m. maritima_ I am convinced that advertisement of intolerance is the primary purpose of song in this species. An account of the activities of a male Seaside Sparrow on May 6"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36285"],["title","Comparative Breeding Behavior of Ammospiza caudacuta and A. maritima (#2)"],["body","the marsh at Chadwick demonstrates this point. In an hour (6:01-7:01 a.m.) the bird sang 395 times, an average of 6.6 times per minute. He faced his nearest singing competitor when singing, which in the course of this hour was usually a male approximately 250 feet away across a creek. The two competitors almost always alternated their songs and frequently the singing of one seemed to stimulate the other bird to sing. Although the song of the Seaside Sparrow is short and unmusical it is loud, especially when compared with the song of the Sharp-tailed Sparrow. Elevated perches such as the tallest cattail stems or isolated bushes were used as singing and observation perches.  The chase of the Seaside Sparrow is not vigorous, but in all cases the intruder was seen to give way to the defender. I saw no physical fights between Seaside Sparrows. Chase by a defending bird was close to the ground and directly toward the intruder. Sometimes the attacking male emitted chipping notes when first sighting or flying towards his adversary.  In the hour of observation mentioned above, no other Seaside Sparrows entered the bird's territory, which consisted of a strip of cattail and shoreline, 250 feet long and no more than 25 feet wide. At other times Seaside Sparrows did enter this male's territory, and he drove them out as soon as he saw them. Savannah and Swamp Sparrows, which for a few weeks migrated through the area, were not chased, but Sharp-tailed Sparrows were chased at times.  Several times I flushed a particular male Seaside Sparrow from the northwest tip of the Lavallette study island so that it flew to the island to the north. Seaside Sparrows of this north island immediately made themselves conspicuous by chipping and then drove the non-resident individual back to its own territory.  The first time I heard what is described below as the social call of the Seaside Sparrow was on June 30 when an unbanded sparrow alighted in a marsh-elder bush near a nest. The individual called twice as it came near. The sound immediately aroused the owners of the nest and the male flew directly toward the strange bird. The intruder quickly and silently flew away.  My field notes refer to many other instances of territorial defense of the nesting area; it seems superfluous to cite them here.  Additional proof of territorialism in Seaside Sparrows was obtained by identifying and plotting the location of all the marked individuals, which I saw each day while systematically traversing all the available habitat on the island. Surprisingly, I did not once record a resident Seaside Sparrow in what I considered another male's territory in the month and a half (June 15-August 1) that I worked on the island at Lavallette.  The fact that the adult Seaside Sparrows did not search for food communally, or that different pairs did not utilize one particular area at different times was most apparent when the pairs were feeding young. From the blinds I first noted that the adults from any given nesting territory always flew in the same direction towards the shore. After moving a blind closer to the shore I noted that once an adult arrived at the open or sparsely vegetated shoreline, that adult restricted itself to a certain portion of the shoreline. These shoreline territories were plotted on field maps and appear on the map in plate 1, figure b. One method used to ascertain the boundaries of these shoreline feeding territories was a census taken from a boat. Many times I circled the island in a skiff identifying the marked sparrows as they appeared along the shore. The feeding sparrows were always found in the same areas around the island. Straight lines can be drawn between the nest sites and feeding areas of each pair of Seaside Sparrows without having any lines cross (pl. 1, fig. b). These lines correspond to the flyways used by each pair to go to and return from the feeding area. I consider the area defended about the nest, the segment of shoreline used by a pair of Seaside Sparrows and the connecting flyway to constitute the territory of a male Seaside Sparrow. If the flyways of any of the pairs had crossed, a situation of mutual exclusiveness would not have existed and a territory could not have been defined for the species.  It is generally agreed that territorial species engage in a minimum of fighting. Song and display have been evolved to substitute for actual combat which demands a greater amount of energy. Additionally, the mere presence of an individual in an area previously established as its territory probably serves to keep birds of nearby territories away. I think that male Seaside Sparrows defend the feeding area and flyway as a part of their territory by advertisement through use of these areas. The birds at Lavallette rarely sang on the feeding grounds and I noted only a few chases originating there. The sparrows rarely landed along the flyways. The constant use of these areas probably served as territorial defense, however. This supposition is supported by the fact that feeding areas and flyways of different pairs were mutually exclusive.  Nice (1941:457) divided territory into six categories. Type A (mating, nesting, and feeding ground for young) is the type exhibited by the Seaside Sparrow. The territory of a male Seaside Sparrow must contain an area of open mud and/or sparse vegetation where food can be obtained and also enough suitable cover to conceal the nest. I suspect in the case of the few males studied on the marshes at Chadwick that the territories the males established (strips of cattails and adjacent shoreline) did not have suitable nesting cover, because these males were unmated on June 15 when I left this study area because of human interference. Suitable nesting cover and feeding areas were separated by short distances of unusable marsh for most of the sparrows on the Lavallette study area. This fact caused the adults to commute from one site to the other. Photographs of shoreline habitat suitable for feeding by Seaside Sparrows appear in plate 2.  The area defended about the nest tended to follow the rows of marsh-elder bushes (pl. 3, fig. a), probably because these bushes supplied suitable song and observation perches. The segments of shoreline used by each pair were less than 75 yards in length and scarcely 20 feet wide. I never recorded Seaside Sparrows foraging in the interior of the marsh.  Sharp-tailed Sparrows were more abundant than Seaside Sparrows on the marshes at Chadwick and Lavallette. Sharp-tailed Sparrows were the more difficult to net because of the peculiar organization of the colonies. This organization, described below, also made nests of that species the more difficult to find. Only intensive netting at both localities produced enough marked individuals for me to study the breeding behavior of the species.  At Chadwick, where I netted most of the 85 Sharp-tailed Sparrows that I banded, my efforts were concentrated on one segment of the marsh. Marking made it evident that the males were not territorial, although they did confine themselves to what might appropriately be called a breeding home range, the area to which an individual confines itself in the course of one nesting attempt. Observations of marked birds also indicated that there was considerable overlap of the breeding home ranges of individual males.  I recorded a few marked Sharp-tailed Sparrows often enough and over a long enough period (more than one month) to gain a good idea of the size of the breeding home range of the males, which I estimate to be three to four acres. This estimate was made at Chadwick, where large areas of suitable uniform habitat occur. Females are more secretive than males, but seem to restrict themselves to areas considerably smaller than those of the males. My observations of two females that were feeding young indicated that each female restricted herself to an area of less than one acre. Female Sharp-tailed Sparrows possibly are territorial, although I recorded no disputes that would substantiate this possibility.  If I am correct in my estimates of size of breeding home range in Sharp-tailed Sparrows (males, three to four acres; females, approximately one acre), certain observations made by Montagna and me are readily explainable.  My netting operations indicated a surplus of male Sharp-tailed Sparrows in a given area. At Chadwick, I netted as many Sharp-tailed Sparrows as I could, without regard to sex. Here I captured 39 males and 16 females (six individuals remained unsexed). On the Lavallette study island, netting was more selective; here I attempted to net the females of the nests I found. The sex ratio at Lavallette was 15 males to eight females (one juvenile was not sexed). Three of the eight females were netted at their nests.  Montagna (1940:196) decided from collecting and observations that male Sharp-tailed Sparrows either outnumbered the females or were polygamous. The results I obtained from netting seemed to indicate a surplus of males. Banding, however, showed that in the breeding season males range over a larger area than do females. With this knowledge, the discrepancy between the number of males and females captured is explainable without an unbalanced sex ratio. If the males range over an area four times as large as that of the females, theoretically, four times as many males should be caught at every placement of the net provided the net remained in place long enough to capture all the birds using the area. In practice, this is essentially what occurred.  Other behaviorisms of this species indicate that it is not territorial. The song of the male is not loud and does not seem to be an advertisement to other birds. In fact, the song of this species is so quiet and lengthy when compared to that of the Seaside Sparrow that I at first thought I was hearing \"whisper\" or \"practice\" songs. These qualities of the song seem to indicate that the \"advertising\" function of song of"]]]
