Whatever the subject of the epistle, whether it was an invitation to dinner, a description of the charms of the country, an account of a visit to a friend, or an expression of condolence with some one in his or her bereavement, he never allowed his pen to run on carelessly.  He scarcely ever prattles in his letters or lets himself go.  One always sees in the writer the literary man, who knows that his correspondence is being passed round from hand to hand, and who hopes that it will find readers among posterity.  Consequently there is an air of studied artificiality about many of the letters, which was more to the taste of the eighteenth than the nineteenth century.  They remind one in many ways of Richardson and Mackenzie, and Pliny would have been recognised by those two writers, and by the latter in particular, as a thorough \"man of sentiment.\"  Herein they differ greatly from the other important collection which has come down to us from classical times, the Letters of Cicero.  Pliny, indeed,--and in this he was a true disciple of his old teacher Quintilian,--took the great Roman orator as his model. Nothing pleased him more than for his friends to tell him that he was the Cicero of his time.  Like Marcus Tullius, he was the foremost pleader of his day; like him again he dabbled in poetry, and his verses, so far as we know them, were sorry stuff.  Yet again like his master, he fondly believed that he enjoyed the special inspiration of the Muses. Pliny, unfortunately for his reputation, gives us a few samples, which are quite as lame and jingling as the famous \"O fortunatam natam, me Consule, Romam!\" which had made generations of Romans smile.  And so, as Cicero was in all things his master, Pliny too wrote letters, excellent in their way, but lacking the vivacity and directness of his model, and, of course, wholly deficient in the political interest which makes Cicero's correspondence one of the most important authorities for the history of his troublous time.  Pliny's Letters cover the period from the accession of Nerva down to 113 A.D.  None precede the death of Domitian in September 96.  That is to say, they were written in an era of profound political peace, and most of them in the reign of Trajan, whose rule Pliny accepted with enthusiastic admiration.  One certainly could have wished that he had written freely to his friends during the last years of Domitian's tyranny, for the value of such contemporary documents would have been enormous.  But he would only have risked his life by so doing, and that he had no desire to do.  It was not until the tyrant had fallen under the sword of Stephanus that he felt it safe to trust his thoughts to paper.  The new era which was inaugurated loosened his tongue and made him breathe more freely.  He exulted that at last an honest man could venture to hold his head high without drawing down upon himself the vengeance of the vile informers who throve upon the misfortunes of the State.  Two of Pliny's correspondents and friends were Cornelius Tacitus and Suetonius Tranquillus.  Yet no one can read either the Histories and Annals of Tacitus or the Lives of the Caesars and then pass to a reading of Pliny's Letters without being struck by the enormous difference in their tone and spirit.  It is almost impossible to believe that their respective authors were contemporaries.  When turning over the pages of Tacitus one feels that the vices and despotism of the Emperors and the Empire had crushed all spirit out of the world, had made quiet family life impossible, and had stamped out every trace of justice and clean living.  It is a remarkable fact that the great writers of the first century, as soon as the Augustan era had closed, should have been masters of a merciless satire, which has rarely been equaled in the history of the world, and never excelled.  When we think of Roman society, as it was in the early Empire, our thoughts recur to the lurid canvases which have been painted for us by Juvenal, by Tacitus, by Lucan, by Seneca, and by Petronius--pictures which have made the world shudder, and have led even careful historians astray.  Pliny supplies the needful corrective and gives us the reverse side of the medal.  Like the authors we have mentioned, he too writes of the evil days which he himself has passed through, as of a horrid nightmare from which he has just awakened; but from his letters, artificial and stilted as they are in some respects, we learn that there were still to be found those who had not bowed the knee to Baal.  And so, with this volume in our hands, we obtain a personal introduction to a number of distinguished Romans and Roman matrons, whose names have been preserved for all time by the Younger Pliny.  His circle of friends was a large one.  Let us mention a few of them.  We have already spoken of Virginius Rufus, the grand old soldier and patriot, who, dying at the age of eighty-four, was awarded a public funeral, while Cornelius Tacitus, then Consul, delivered the panegyric in his honour.  Vestricius Spurinna was  another distinguished general of the old school, and Pliny relates with enthusiasm how he paid a visit to him in his country-house when Spurinna was seventy-seven years of age and had retired from public office.  He tells us how his friend spent his day, how he drove and walked and played tennis to keep himself in health, wrote Greek and Latin lyrics, and maintained a keen interest in all that went on in the capital.  Corellius Rufus is another of the older men of whom Pliny writes with sincere affection, and he helped to pay the debt of gratitude he owed him by numerous acts of kindness to his daughter Crellia.  Voconius Romanus is another of his closest friends, and Pliny tells us that he wrote such admirable letters that you would think the Muses themselves must speak in Latin.  His literary associates numbered among them Caius Cornelius Tacitus, Silius Italicus the poet--whose veneration for Virgil was so great that he kept his master's birthday with more solemnity than his own, and visited his tomb on the Bay of Naples with as much respect as worshippers pay to a temple,--Martial the epigrammatist, Suetonius Tranquillus the historian, and others such as Passennus Paullus, Caninius Rufus, Virgilius Romanus, and Caius Fannius, whose works have not survived the wreck of time, though Pliny showers upon all of them enthusiastic and indiscriminate praise.  Again, he enjoyed the friendship of a number of distinguished foreigners, professional rhetoricians and philosophers, who came back to Rome after their sentence of banishment, passed by Domitian, had been revoked by Nerva and Trajan.  Euphrates, Artemidorus, and Isaeus were the three most famous, and their respective styles are carefully described by Pliny.  Even more interesting perhaps is the gallery of Roman ladies, whose portraits are limned with so fine and discriminating a touch. Juvenal again is responsible for much misconception as to the part the women of Rome played in Roman society.  The appalling Sixth Satire, in which he unhesitatingly declares that most women--if not all--are bad, and that virtue and chastity are so rare as to be almost unknown, in which he roundly accuses them of all the vices known to human depravity, reads like a monstrous and disgraceful libel on the sex when one turns to Pliny and makes the acquaintance of Arria, Fannia, Corellia, and Calpurnia.  The characters of Arria and Fannia are well known; they are among the heroines of history.  But in Pliny there are numerous references to women whose names are not even known to us, but the terms in which they are referred to prove what sweet, womanly lives they led. For example, he writes to Geminus:  \"Our friend Macrinus has suffered a grievous wound.  He has lost his wife, who would have been regarded as a model of all the virtues even if she had lived in the good old days.  He lived with her for thirty-nine years, without so much as a single quarrel or disagreement.\"  \"Vixit cum hac triginta novem annis sine jurgio, sine offensa.  One is reminded of the fine line of Propertius, in which Cornelia boasts of the blameless union of herself and her husband, Paullus--  \"Viximus insignes inter utramque facem.\"  This is no isolated example.  One of the most pathetic letters is that in which Pliny writes of the death of the younger daughter of his friend Fundanus, a girl in her fifteenth year, who had already \"the prudence of age, the gravity of a matron, and all the maidenly modesty and sweetness of a girl.\"  Pliny tells us how it cut him to the quick to hear her father give directions that the money he had meant to lay out on dresses and pearls and jewels for her betrothal should be spent on incense, unguents, and spices for her bier.  What a different picture from anything we find in Juvenal, who would fain have us believe that Messalina was the type of the average Roman matron of his day!  Such were some of Pliny's friends.  His distinguished position at the Bar drew him a host of clients; his official status and his friendship with Trajan gave him the entree into any society he liked.  He was, moreover, a man of considerable wealth, generous, even lavish, with his money, and his disposition was one of the kindest.  He was always ready to believe the best of any one, always prepared to do a friend a service, devoted to his wife and her relations, and anxious to deal justly and honourably with all men.  We have called him vain, and vain he undoubtedly was to an extraordinary degree.  But Pliny's vanity is never offensive.  The very naivete with which he acknowledges his failing disarms all criticism and merely renders it amusing.  Indeed, it is doubtful whether he would have admitted that it was a failing at all, inasmuch as it was his love of praise which spurred him on to literary endeavour.  The Romans, in their grand manner, affected a certain"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3234"],["title","The Letters of the Younger Pliny, First Series â€” Volume 1 (#2)"],["body","which is alien to the Anglo-Saxon cast of thought, and if Horace could declare of his own odes that he had erected a monument more durable than brass, Pliny, who always had the great masters before him, naturally fell into the same rather vainglorious train of thought.  His frankest confession is to be found in a letter to Titinius Capito, who had urged him to write history, when he says:  \"Me autem nihil aeque ac diuturnitatis amor et cupido sollicitat, res homine dignissima, eo presertime qui nullius sibi conscius culpae posteritatis memoriam non reformidet.\"  Or again, he admits that he is not Stoic enough to be merely content with the consciousness of having done his duty.  He craves for a public testimony thereto, a little applause from the bystanders, a vote of thanks from those whom he has benefited.  Most of us desire the same--the difference is that Pliny does not mind owning up to it.  But this vanity of his peeps out in curious places.  When we find him speaking of a young Roman of fashion standing for hours in a crowd to listen to his pleading in the courts, or of his audience pressing him not to omit a single line of his poems, or of the deferential way in which certain young barristers of promise hang on his lips, copy his gestures and bow to his judgment, one cannot resist a smile.  When he tells us that he went on calmly reading and taking notes during the eruption of Vesuvius, though the hot ashes were threatening to overwhelm the villa in which he was staying, or when he quotes the really execrable verses which some scribbler of the day composed in his honour, with the most exquisite self-complacency, one is tempted to show a little impatience at such extravagant self-satisfaction.  Tacitus again--that supreme master of irony--must have occasionally curled his thin lip on reading some of the epistles which were addressed to him by his friend Pliny.  It is a tribute to Pliny's powers of literary discernment that he appreciated the marvellous ability of Tacitus, though had he failed to do so, we should have rated him for his blindness.  No cultured Roman could fail to see that Tacitus had brought a new literary style to a pitch of the highest perfection, and his fame throughout his lifetime was enormous.  So apparently was Pliny's, and the latter boasts that their names are mentioned together in everyday conversation, and in the last wills and testaments of people with literary taste.  Tacitus one day was sitting at the games, and got into conversation with a stranger sitting in the next seat.  It took a literary turn, and the stranger was delighted with the learning that Tacitus displayed.  \"Are you a Roman, or from the country\" said he. \"You know me quite well,\" answered Tacitus, \"from the books you have studied.\"  \"Then,\" rejoined the stranger, \"you must be either Tacitus or Pliny.\"  It was Tacitus himself who told Pliny the story, and one can imagine how it would delight him.  He promptly sits down and tells it to his friend Maximus, and adds another story of a similar character.  But the most extraordinary passage of all occurs in a letter (vii. 20) to Tacitus himself.  In it Pliny says that when he was a young man and Tacitus was already famous, he determined to make him his model.  There were, he said, many brilliant geniuses, but you--such was the affinity of our natures--seemed to me to be the most easy to imitate, and the most worthy of imitation.  Maxime imitabilis, maxime imitandus videbaris.  Unconscious conceit could go no farther!  And yet one can pardon this egregious vanity when one thinks of Pliny's other qualities.  Who else is there in Roman literature who so thoroughly corresponds with our modern ideal of a rich, generous, cultured public servant?  In one place we find him providing for the educational needs of his birthplace, Comum.  In another he renounces his share of an inheritance, and bestows it upon his old township.  Or he buys a statue for a temple, finds the money for a new shrine, pays the debts of an acquaintance, gives a friend's daughter a handsome dowry, opens his purse and enables another deserving friend to acquire the status of a senator, or finds Martial his travelling expenses.  All the rising young authors and barristers in Rome looked to him for encouragement and support; he was ready to attend their public readings, to rise when the reading was over and say a few words of encouragement, to canvass for them if they were standing for office, and enlist on their behalf all the influence at his command.  And he only asked in return a little deference and acknowledgment of his kindness!  Most interesting of all, we find him giving a farm to his old nurse, and asking a friend to look after it for her.  He sends a slave of his, who was troubled with consumption, to Egypt for a change of air, and afterwards to the colony of Forum Julii, the modern Frejus on the Riviera.  Pliny writes of the slaves of his household just as any kind- hearted Jamaican planter would have written before the Emancipation Act, and it is to be noted that the head slaves of a Roman gentleman's establishment were often Greeks of high literary attainments, and treated by their masters as intimate and affectionate friends.  Pliny narrates with a shock of uneasiness and horror the story of a Roman knight who was beaten to death by the servants of his household, and, though he admits that the knight had been cruel and overbearing, such an untimely fate brought home to him the insecurity of all masters--that insecurity which led the Romans to punish with such merciless severity any attack by a slave upon his owner.  Not that Pliny had any cause for self-reproach!  He tells us in a charming letter his rule of conduct with his dependants, and the theory on which he conducted his household. According to his view, \"Servis respublica quaedam et quasi civitas domus est.\"  Consequently, he allowed them to make wills and leave their property as they desired, provided only that the recipients were also members of the household, and, what was better still, he speaks of his \"facilitas manumittendi\"--his readiness to give them their freedom for faithful service.  One can well imagine that Pliny's was a model family, that it was his pride to be in every sense of the word a just paterfamilias, and that he showed his slaves great consideration for their welfare.  He complains, indeed, jocularly in one place that too much kindness is not good for servants, as it leads them to presume upon the easy-going temperament of their master, but that is only a good- natured grumble on the perennial servant problem.  Pliny was thrice married, twice under Domitian, but his second wife died in 97, and the lady who figures in the letters is his third wife Calpurnia, grand-daughter of Calpurnius Fabatus, and niece of a lady named Hispulla.  We get a charming picture of their mutual happiness in a letter written by Pliny to Hispulla, who had had charge of his wife's education when she was a girl.  He praises her intelligence, her economy, her love for him, and the interest she takes in his career. When he is pleading in the courts she has messengers to bring her word of the success of the speech and the result of the trial; when he is giving a reading to his friends, Calpurnia sits behind a curtain and greedily drinks in the praises they bestow.  She sets his verses to music, and Hispulla, who made the match, is neatly rewarded at the conclusion of the letter by Pliny saying that both he and his wife vie with one another in seeing who can thank her the more.  When Calpurnia was obliged to leave her husband and go to Campania for her health, we find Pliny writing her tender love-letters, describing his anxiety on her behalf, telling her how he conjures up the very things he most dreads, how he reads and re-reads her letters, which are his only comfort, and begging her to write him certainly once, and if possible, twice a day.  Then in the prettiest passage of all, he tells her how, at the hours when he used to visit her, he finds his feet carrying him to the door of her chamber and turns away from the threshold of the empty room, sad as a lover who finds the door closed against him.  The glimpses which Roman literature affords us of the conjugal happiness of man and wife are comparatively few.  Cicero, indeed, wrote in a similar strain to his wife Terentia, and used even tenderer diminutives than Pliny, but the sequel was that he soon afterwards divorced her and married a rich ward.  We do not know the sequel in the case of Pliny. All we know is that he nearly lost his wife in a dangerous illness brought on by a miscarriage, and that she accompanied him to Bithynia during his governorship.  Whether she bore him the child which he so ardently desired is not stated, but the probabilities are against it, as there is no mention of such an event in the letters.  His correspondence clearly proves that for all his ambition he was essentially a family man.  Nothing could be finer than his description of the heroic devotion of Arria to her husband, and the pathos with which he describes the conduct of Fannia, who concealed the death of her dearly loved son from her sick husband Paetus, telling him the boy was well and resting quietly, and controlling her motherly tears until she could keep them back no longer, and rushed from the room to give them free course. Then, \"Satiata siccis oculis composito vultu redibat, tanquam orbitatem foris reliquisset.\"  No one could have written that beautiful sentence but a man of tender heart and sympathies.  Pliny's tastes were catholic.  He writes with delight, but without pretending to be a connoisseur, of an antique statuette which he had purchased out of a legacy.  Some rich men in Rome had the mania for antiques--Corinthian bronzes were the rage in Pliny's day--as badly as those who haunt our modern sale-rooms.  Pliny's hobby, if he had been living in our time, would probably"]]]
