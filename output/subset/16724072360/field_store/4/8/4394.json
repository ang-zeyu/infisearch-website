If you're curious I'll hang on here while you go and find out.\"  Kenneth was off like a shot.  Half-way across the bridge that here spans the Meuse he nearly collided with the proprietor of the Hôtel Doré.  The man's face was red with excitement.  \"Quel dommage!\" he exclaimed, in reply to the lad's unspoken question. \"The Government has ordered the army to mobilize.  What inconsideration!  Jules, Michel, Georges, and Étienne--all will have to go.  I shall be left without a single garçon.  And the busy season approaches also.\"  \"Why is the army to be mobilized, then?\"  \"Ciel!  I know not.  We Belgians do not require soldiers.  We are men of peace.  Has not our neutrality been guaranteed by our neighbours? And, notwithstanding, the Government must have men to vie with the French _piou-piou_, give them rifles, and put them in uniforms at the expense of the community.  It is inconceivable!\"  The proprietor, unable to contain his feelings, rushed back to the hotel, while Kenneth, still wishing to satisfy his curiosity by ocular demonstration, made his way to the edge of the semicircular crowd of excited townsfolk.  The proclamation, dated the 31st day of July, was an order for partial mobilization, calling up the First Division of the Reserves.  No reason was given, and the lack of it, rather than the fact that the order had to be obeyed, was the subject of general comment.  From the nature of the conversation the lad gathered that military service was not regarded by the Belgians in anything approaching a tolerant spirit.  \"Nothing much; only a mobilization,\" announced Everest in reply to his companion's enquiry.  \"Let's make a move.  We may see something of the Belgian troops.  It would be rather interesting to see how they take to playing at soldiering.\"  \"Why playing?\" asked Rollo as he proceeded to secure his valise to the carrier.  \"What else would you expect from Belgians?\" rejoined Kenneth.  \"Even old Gallipot--or whatever the hotel proprietor's name is--was grumbling about the uselessness of the business, and most of those johnnies over there are of the same opinion.  No, Rollo, take my word for it, the Belgians are not a fighting race.  Let me see--didn't they skedaddle at Waterloo and almost let our fellows down?\"  \"They may have done,\" remarked Rollo.  \"But that's nearly a century old.  Ready?\"  With half-closed throttles, and tyres sufficiently soft to absorb most of the shocks, the young tourists bumped over the _pavé_, swung round, and soon settled down to a modest fifteen miles an hour along the Namur road.  For the best part of the journey the Meuse, with its limestone crags and dense foliage, was within a few yards on their right, while trees on either side of the road afforded a pleasant shade from the fierce rays of the sun.  The dust, too, rose in dense clouds whenever, as frequently happened, a motor-car tore past, or a flock of frightened sheep scampered madly all across the road.  At Namur their wishes regarding the Belgian troops were gratified.  The narrow street swarmed with soldiers and civil guards.  There were men with head-dresses resembling the busbies of the British guardsmen, leading teams of dogs harnessed to light quick-firing \"Berthier\" guns; infantry who, in spite of the broiling heat, wore heavy greatcoats; cavalry whose mounts were powerful enough to evoke the admiration of the critical Kenneth.  \"I wonder what all this fuss is about,\" he exclaimed.  Before Rollo could furnish any remark a little Belgian officer accosted them.  \"You gentlemen are English, without doubt?\"  \"We are.\"  \"It then is well,\" continued the officer, speaking in English with considerable fluency.  \"You have not heard, eh?  The news--the grave news?\"  \"No, monsieur.\"  \"Germany has declared war upon the Russians.\"     CHAPTER II  A Break-down  \"Is that so?\" asked Kenneth.  \"Then I hope to goodness the Russians will give the Germans a thundering good licking.  But why are your troops mobilizing?\"  The Belgian officer replied by producing a newspaper and pointing to a heavy-leaded column.  \"You understand our language?\" he asked.  The report, though a piece of journalistic conjecture, afterwards proved to be very near to the mark.  It was to the effect that Germany had declared war against Russia and also France, and that her troops were already pouring over the respective frontiers.  To take all necessary precautions the King of the Belgians had ordered a mobilization, and had appealed to King George to assist him in preserving the integrity of his small kingdom.  \"You'll notice it says that it is reported,\" observed the cautious Rollo.  \"By Jove, if it is true, the Kaiser will have a handful.  But, monsieur, surely Belgium will be out of it?  Her integrity is protected by treaties.\"  The Belgian officer shrugged his shoulders.  \"Let us hope so,\" he remarked.  \"We Belgians have little faith in the honour of a German.  Therefore, we arm.  Where do you propose to go?\"  \"To Liége, monsieur.\"  \"Then do not go.  It is not advisable.  If you take my advice you return to England as soon as possible.  Perhaps, soon, you come back again with a brave English army.\"  \"Whatever is the fellow aiming at?\" asked Kenneth, after the officer was out of ear-shot.  \"It's all so very mysterious about nothing.\"  \"Do you call war between Germany and France and Russia nothing, old fellow?\"  \"I wasn't referring to that,\" replied Kenneth.  \"Of course it is.  The Russians will simply walk over Prussia while the Germans are trying to batter the French frontier forts.  No; what I meant is, why should we be balked in going to Liége?  We'll go, and risk it--though I don't believe there is any risk.  If there is, so much the better for us.\"  \"Perhaps that Belgian officer knows more than he told us.\"  \"Or else less.  I'll tell you what, Rollo.  We'll see what's doing at Liége; then, if there's time, we'll run back almost to the French frontier and see what the excitement is like there.  Let's make another start.\"  The suggestion was quickly put into practice, but progress was tedious and slow.  The highway between Namur and Liége was crowded with traffic.  Military wagons, both motor-driven and drawn by horses and mules, seemed an unending stream.  The rattling of the huge motor-lorries prevented the chauffeurs from hearing any sounds beyond the pulsations of their engines.  In vain the two English lads sounded their horns.  It was invariably a case of throwing out the clutch and waiting for a favourable moment to dash past, often with a bare yard between the off-side wheel of the powerful lorries and the deep ditch by the side of the road.  There were thousands of troops, too, with their supply-carts; swarms of peasants driving cattle into the fortresses; motor-cars, motor-cycles, and ordinary cycles galore, till Rollo remarked, during one of the enforced halts, that it was ten times worse than Barnet Hill on fair night.  At length, after taking two hours to traverse fifteen miles, the lads came in sight of the town of Huy.  Here the traffic lessened slightly, and Kenneth called for an increased speed.  Suddenly Rollo saw his companion's cycle slip from under him.  It was all he could do to avoid coming into collision with the prostrate mount.  When he pulled up and dismounted, Kenneth was regaining his feet.  \"Hurt?\" asked Barrington laconically, yet with considerable anxiety.  \"Not a bit,\" replied Kenneth cheerfully.  \"Only barked my knuckles. Get up, you brute!\"  The last remark was addressed to the motor-cycle, which was lying on its side across a rounded stone embedded in the ground on the edge of the footpath.  Kenneth found, for the first time, that it required a fair amount of physical energy to restore a fallen motorcycle to its normal position.  Thrice he tried a running start, but without success.  The motor refused to fire.  \"Jack it up on its stand,\" suggested Rollo.  \"Inject a little petrol into the compression tap and have another shot.\"  Kenneth promptly acted upon this advice, but still without satisfactory result.  By this time Rollo had placed his cycle on its stand and was ready to give assistance.  \"There's no spark,\" he announced after testing the plug.  \"I hope it isn't the magneto.\"  With the usual perversity of things in general and motor-cycles in particular, it was the magneto that was out of action.  The round stone on which the cycle had fallen had given the delicate mechanism a nasty blow.  \"This job's beyond me,\" declared Rollo.  \"We must see what can be done in the next town.  Thank goodness it isn't far.  Off with the belt and push her; I won't risk towing you with this traffic about.\"  Already the disabled motor-cycle was surrounded by a crowd of peasants and soldiers, all of whom offered advice; but, as the majority of the onlookers were Walloons, their Flemish tongue was not understood by the two English lads.  At length Kenneth managed to get into conversation with a French-speaking corporal, and from him learnt that there was an efficient motor-repairer in Huy, whose place of business faced the market square.  It was exhausting work pushing the two motor-bicycles along the undulating, rough cobbled road in the fierce glare of the August sun. The crowd followed.  About a quarter of a mile farther along the road a chasseur passed. Reining in his horse he addressed the corporal.  \"What, then, has happened, Pierre?\"  The Belgian non-com. shrugged his shoulders.  \"Only two German tourists, Gaston,\" he replied.  \"They have had an accident.\"  \"German!\" exclaimed Kenneth indignantly.  \"You are wrong.  We are English.\"  \"Can Monsieur produce proof?\" asked the corporal.  Fortunately both lads possessed _permits de circulation_--documents issued to foreign tourists on entering French territory, and which they had not given up at the _douane_ "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36500"],["title","The Dispatch-Riders: The Adventures of Two British Motor-cyclists in the Great (#2)"],["body","Givet.  On each document was pasted a photograph of the bearer and particulars of his name, nationality, occupation, and place of abode.  In less than a minute the indifferent demeanour of the crowd underwent a complete change.  Amid shouts of \"Vivent les Anglais!\" several of the Belgians took possession of the two motor-cycles, and, in spite of frequent wobblings, pushed them right into the town.  Here another set-back greeted the tourists.  The repairer gravely informed them that a new magneto was absolutely necessary, and since he had not one in stock he would be obliged to send to Brussels for it.  Under the circumstances an enforced stay would have to be made at Huy, so the lads booked a room at a modest but cheerful-looking hotel.  The town and environs seemed delightfully picturesque, and, although Kenneth chafed under the delay, both lads eventually admitted they might have been hung up in many a worse place than Huy.  The next day, Sunday, they were awakened early by a clamour in the street, and found that newsvendors were doing a roaring trade.  The papers were full of sensational reports, and although definite news was not forthcoming, it was quite evident that the war clouds were rapidly gathering.  Rollo, the cautious, suggested the abandonment of the Liége trip and a hasty return home, but Kenneth set his face against any such proposal.  \"Look here,\" he said, \"if there's any truth in this report, and England does chip in, we will do no good by returning home.  The powers that be have decided that we are not yet of an age to take up a commission, although I flatter myself that we are both better men than Tompkins, late of the Upper Sixth, who was gazetted to a line regiment a week before the holidays, you'll remember.  If there is a dust-up we'll try our luck with the French.  They don't object to fellows of sixteen, so long as they are keen.  Take the case of Lord Kitchener, for instance. He served as a cadet in the war of '70 and '71.\"  \"Don't be in such a violent hurry, old man.  Stick to our original programme and go to Liége, if you will.  It may be necessary for us to look after your sister, you know.\"  \"I don't think so; I firmly believe that Belgium will be left out of the business.  This scare will be over in a few days.  The pen is mightier than the sword, you know, so Germany will respect her plighted word to preserve the neutrality of both Holland and Belgium.\"  It was nearly noon on Monday morning when the lads wended their way to the motor-repairer's.  Outside the burgomaster's house a huge crowd had gathered.  The chief magistrate was making ready to read a document. It was a copy of the momentous ultimatum from the bully of Europe to one of the smallest of her neighbours: a peremptory demand that the Belgian Government should allow the legions of the Kaiser to pass through Belgium in order to attack the least-defended frontier of France, and threatening to make war upon the little buffer State should she refuse.  A dead silence greeted the burgomaster's announcement.  The news, though not unexpected, was astounding.  Again he spoke:  \"Fellow-townsmen!  I can assure you that the spirit of independence lives amongst us.  We will resist to the death this outrageous demand. Nor are we without powerful friends.  Listen to the words of an appeal of our heroic Sovereign to the King of England: 'Remembering the numerous proofs of your Majesty's friendship and that of your predecessors, and the friendly attitude of England in 1870, and the proof of friendship you have just given us again, I make a supreme appeal to the diplomatic intervention of your Majesty's Government to safeguard the integrity of Belgium.\"  \"And what is the reply of the King of England?\" shouted a voice.  \"If it has been received it has not up to the present been communicated to me,\" replied the chief magistrate pompously.  \"Rest assured that I, your burgomaster, will not be tardy in keeping the worthy burgesses fully posted with the latest news from the capital.  If any of you still have faith in German promises, let me inform you it is definitely established that the German troops have already invaded the independent Grand Duchy of Luxemburg.\"  The burgomaster withdrew, leaving the townsfolk to shout \"Down with Germany!\" \"Long live England!\" and cheer madly for their young king, who was yet to display proof of his personal courage.  \"It's getting serious,\" admitted Kenneth as the chums resumed their way.  \"I don't mind owning I was wrong in my opinion of German honesty. If they don't draw the line at Luxemburg they evidently won't at Belgium.  Rollo, my boy, it's a mortal cert that Great Britain will be scrapping with Germany in less than a week.\"     CHAPTER III  Major Résimont  \"I vote we get off this main road with its wretched _pavé_,\" exclaimed Rollo prior to resuming their ride on the following day.  \"There's a road shown on the map which ought to be a jolly sight better.  At any rate we'll miss most of the heavy traffic.\"  \"Right-o,\" assented Kenneth; \"anything so long as we can have a speed-burst.  I'm tired of crawling along at ten miles an hour.\"  The road, which turned out to be little better than a cart-track, led a considerable distance from the left bank of the Meuse, and with the exception of an occasional farm wagon laden with hay, very little traffic was met with.  At the end of an hour's steady riding, the lads found themselves at the junction of two forked roads, where, contrary to the usual custom, there was no signpost to indicate the direction.  On either side was a steep bank.  \"Now, which way?\" asked Rollo.  \"Neither of the roads looks particularly inviting.\"  \"It's one of the sunken roads of Belgium, I suppose,\" said Kenneth. \"We'll climb up this bank.  Perhaps we shall be able to see where we are.  It will be awkward for our bikes if a motor-car comes tearing along.\"  The incline was nearly fifteen feet in height and fairly steep.  When the lads reached the summit they found, to their surprise, that they were on a slightly undulating grass field liberally guarded with barbed wire.  About four hundred yards off was a rounded hillock.  Even as the two looked they saw a huge cylindrical turret, from which projected the muzzle of a large gun, rise from the ground.  For a few seconds the giant weapon moved horizontally and vertically, as if seeking a target, then as swiftly as it had appeared it disappeared into the ground.  \"I say, we've stumbled across one of the frontier forts,\" exclaimed Kenneth.  \"Let's go a bit closer and have a look.  I'd like to find out how they work.\"  \"Thanks, I'm not having any,\" objected Rollo.  \"There's too much barbed wire knocking about.  Besides, there are our bikes.\"  \"We needn't wriggle under the wire, this road on our right evidently leads to the fort.  We'll get a bit closer; but hold on a minute, we'll see if that gun pops up again.\"  They waited for at least five minutes, but without the expected result. As they turned to retrace their steps, they were confronted by a tall Belgian soldier wearing the blue uniform of the artillery.  \"C'est défendu: marchez!\" he ordered sternly.  \"All right, monsieur,\" replied Kenneth.  \"We've lost our way.  Which is the Liége road?\"  \"You are foreigners,\" exclaimed the soldier, bringing his bayonet to the \"ready\".  \"Yes, English.\"  \"You must come with me.\"  \"We have motor-bicycles.\"  \"No matter.  They will be attended to.  Forward!\"  Realizing the uselessness of attempting to argue the point the lads obeyed, the soldier following three paces in the rear with his rifle and bayonet at the slope.  After covering a distance of about a hundred yards between the edge of the barbed-wire entanglements and the dip formed by the sunken road, the arrested lads found themselves in the presence of a corporal and a file of men.  \"You must be taken before the major.  I am sorry, but these are my orders,\" declared the corporal civilly, after ascertaining that the two chums were English.  \"No doubt you will be permitted to go with but little delay.\"  \"Will our motor-bicycles be all right?\" asked Rollo anxiously.  \"We left them a little way down the lane.\"  \"I will send a man to look after them,\" was the reply.  \"We must take you into Fort Loncine, and you must be blindfolded.  These are my orders whenever we find strangers in the vicinity of the defences.\"  \"Very well,\" replied Kenneth with as good a grace as he could command, at the same time producing his handkerchief.  Guided by soldiers, the two blindfolded youths were led into the fort. Kenneth kept count of the number of paces before crossing the drawbridge; they totalled four hundred and eighty-five, which, allowing thirty inches for his long stride, meant that the glacis, or level grassy ground surrounding the fort, was a little over four hundred yards in breadth.  When the handkerchiefs were removed from their eyes the lads found themselves in a large vaulted room lighted by electricity.  On three sides were several low-arched doorways, on the fourth a fairly broad gateway through which they had been brought.  Although it was impossible to see straight into the open air, a distant glimpse of diffused daylight showed that this entrance communicated either with the glacis or else an enclosed portion of the fort that was exposed to the rays of the sun.  Seated on benches or lolling against the walls were quite a hundred soldiers, yet the place was by no means crowded.  Beyond looking with evident curiosity at the two lads under arrest, they took no further interest in them.  Presently a sergeant approached and questioned the guards concerning their prisoners.  \"English?  Perhaps they are sent ... but, no; they are but youths. Bring them along.  I will inform Major Résimont.\"  The sergeant knocked at one of the doors, and in reply to a muffled \"Entrez!\" he passed through.  The lads noticed that the door was of steel, and required considerable effort on the part of the non-commissione"]]]
