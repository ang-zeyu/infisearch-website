Some specimens of _C. g. galei_ exceed _C. limitis_ in ridging of the skull and size of the teeth although conspicuous ridges and large teeth are supposedly distinctive of _C. limitis_. The bullae, although averaging larger in _C. limitis_, can be matched in size by those of specimens of _C. g. galei_ from Wyoming.  The differences evident between _C. limitis_ and _C. g. galei_ are of the kind and degree that serve to separate subspecies in the species _Clethrionomys gapperi_ and, although actual evidence of intergradation is lacking, we think that the relationships of _limitis_ are better expressed by arranging it as a subspecies of _C. gapperi_ than by retaining it as a full species.  _Specimens examined._--Total, 7, all in the Biological Surveys Collection, distributed as follows:  +New Mexico+: _Catron County_: Willow Creek, 8500 ft., Mogollon Mountains, 4. _Socorro County_: San Mateo Peak, 10,000 ft., San Mateo Mountains, 2; Copper Canyon, 9000 ft., Magdalena Mountains, 1.     +Clethrionomys gapperi arizonensis+, new subspecies  _Type._--Female, adult, skin and skull; No. 158401, Biological Surveys Collection, United States National Museum; from Little Colorado River, 8300 ft., White Mountains, Apache County, Arizona; obtained September 12, 1908, by C. Birdseye, original number 152.  _Range._--Known only from the White Mountains of eastern Arizona.  _Diagnosis._--Dorsal stripe near Chestnut, with an underwash of between Tawny and Russet, and a mixture of black-tipped hairs, resulting in an overall effect of near Chestnut. Skull wide across zygomatic arches and narrow across mastoids; rostrum narrow and posterior border of palate straight.  _Comparisons._--This subspecies needs close comparison only with the adjacent subspecies _C. g. limitis_. As compared with topotypes of _limitis_, _C. g. arizonensis_ has darker pelage, narrower rostrum, greater width across zygomatic arches, lesser lambdoidal breadth, longer nasals, wider palate, and more inflated auditory bullae. The posterior border of the hard palate is straight in five skulls of the series that are complete (two skulls have the palatal regions broken); all _C. g. limitis_ examined have a median posterior projection on the posterior border of the hard palate.  _Measurements._--External and cranial measurements of the type, and the average and extreme measurements of three adult males and two adult females from the type locality (including the type) are: Total length, 160, 145.6 (137-160); tail, 44, 40.8 (37-46); hind foot, 18.5, 19.3 (18-20); condylobasilar length, 23.3, 22.8 (22.1-23.5); zygomatic breadth, 13.8, 13.4 (12.6-13.8); lambdoidal breadth, 11.5, 11.4 (11.0-11.6); alveolar length upper cheek-teeth, 5.5, 5.4 (5.2-5.5); interorbital breadth, 3.8, 3.9 (3.8-4.0); length of nasals, 7.6, 7.1 (6.9-7.6); breadth of rostrum, 3.1, 3.1 (3.0-3.2); length of incisive foramina, 5.5, 5.2 (5.0-5.5).  _Remarks._--Hall and Davis (Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington, 47:55, February 9, 1934) reported 12 specimens of red-backed mice from Hannagan Meadow, 9500 to 9600 ft., and ten from Hannagan Creek, 8600 ft., all in Greenlee County, Arizona. Although they pointed out most of the cranial differences here described as diagnostic of _C. g. arizonensis_, they did not name the animals as new since they had no seasonally comparable materials; thus they were unable to evaluate the differences noted in pelage. We have not examined the material referred to by Hall and Davis (_loc. cit._), but, on the basis of their description, here refer it to _C. g. arizonensis_.  _Specimens examined._--Total, 7, all from the type locality and all in the Biological Surveys Collection in the United States National Museum.     Grateful acknowledgment is made of the opportunity to study the specimens from New Mexico and Arizona in the Biological Surveys Collection of the United States National Museum and the material from South Dakota in the University of Michigan Museum of Zoology, as well as for the financial support afforded one of us (Cockrum) by the University of Kansas from its Research appropriation. Cockrum's work was part of a larger investigation of the geographic distribution of all North American native mammals, aided by a contract between the Office of Naval Research, Department of the Navy, and the University of Kansas (NR. 161-791). Also, assistance with some of field work was given by the Kansas University Endowment Association.  _Transmitted June 21, 1952._  [Illustration: printers mark]         24-4369   Transcriber's Notes.

He has often said, while tears of pleasure trembled in his eyes, that these were moments infinitely more delightful than any passed amid the brilliant and tumultuous scenes that are courted by the world. His heart was occupied; it had, what can be so rarely said, no wish for a happiness beyond what it experienced. The consciousness of acting right diffused a serenity over his manners, which nothing else could impart to a man of moral perceptions like his, and which refined his sense of every surrounding blessing.  The deepest shade of twilight did not send him from his favourite plane-tree. He loved the soothing hour, when the last tints of light die away; when the stars, one by one, tremble through æther, and are reflected on the dark mirror of the waters; that hour, which, of all others, inspires the mind with pensive tenderness, and often elevates it to sublime contemplation. When the moon shed her soft rays among the foliage, he still lingered, and his pastoral supper of cream and fruits was often spread beneath it. Then, on the stillness of night, came the song of the nightingale, breathing sweetness, and awakening melancholy.  The first interruptions to the happiness he had known since his retirement, were occasioned by the death of his two sons. He lost them at that age when infantine simplicity is so fascinating; and though, in consideration of Madame St. Aubert’s distress, he restrained the expression of his own, and endeavoured to bear it, as he meant, with philosophy, he had, in truth, no philosophy that could render him calm to such losses. One daughter was now his only surviving child; and, while he watched the unfolding of her infant character, with anxious fondness, he endeavoured, with unremitting effort, to counteract those traits in her disposition, which might hereafter lead her from happiness. She had discovered in her early years uncommon delicacy of mind, warm affections, and ready benevolence; but with these was observable a degree of susceptibility too exquisite to admit of lasting peace. As she advanced in youth, this sensibility gave a pensive tone to her spirits, and a softness to her manner, which added grace to beauty, and rendered her a very interesting object to persons of a congenial disposition. But St. Aubert had too much good sense to prefer a charm to a virtue; and had penetration enough to see, that this charm was too dangerous to its possessor to be allowed the character of a blessing. He endeavoured, therefore, to strengthen her mind; to enure her to habits of self-command; to teach her to reject the first impulse of her feelings, and to look, with cool examination, upon the disappointments he sometimes threw in her way. While he instructed her to resist first impressions, and to acquire that steady dignity of mind, that can alone counterbalance the passions, and bear us, as far as is compatible with our nature, above the reach of circumstances, he taught himself a lesson of fortitude; for he was often obliged to witness, with seeming indifference, the tears and struggles which his caution occasioned her.  In person, Emily resembled her mother; having the same elegant symmetry of form, the same delicacy of features, and the same blue eyes, full of tender sweetness. But, lovely as was her person, it was the varied expression of her countenance, as conversation awakened the nicer emotions of her mind, that threw such a captivating grace around her:  Those tend’rer tints, that shun the careless eye, And, in the world’s contagious circle, die.   St. Aubert cultivated her understanding with the most scrupulous care. He gave her a general view of the sciences, and an exact acquaintance with every part of elegant literature. He taught her Latin and English, chiefly that she might understand the sublimity of their best poets. She discovered in her early years a taste for works of genius; and it was St. Aubert’s principle, as well as his inclination, to promote every innocent means of happiness. “A well-informed mind,” he would say, “is the best security against the contagion of folly and of vice. The vacant mind is ever on the watch for relief, and ready to plunge into error, to escape from the languor of idleness. Store it with ideas, teach it the pleasure of thinking; and the temptations of the world without, will be counteracted by the gratifications derived from the world within. Thought, and cultivation, are necessary equally to the happiness of a country and a city life; in the first they prevent the uneasy sensations of indolence, and afford a sublime pleasure in the taste they create for the beautiful, and the grand; in the latter, they make dissipation less an object of necessity, and consequently of interest.”  It was one of Emily’s earliest pleasures to ramble among the scenes of nature; nor was it in the soft and glowing landscape that she most delighted; she loved more the wild wood-walks, that skirted the mountain; and still more the mountain’s stupendous recesses, where the silence and grandeur of solitude impressed a sacred awe upon her heart, and lifted her thoughts to the GOD OF HEAVEN AND EARTH. In scenes like these she would often linger along, wrapt in a melancholy charm, till the last gleam of day faded from the west; till the lonely sound of a sheep-bell, or the distant bark of a watch-dog, were all that broke on the stillness of the evening. Then, the gloom of the woods; the trembling of their leaves, at intervals, in the breeze; the bat, flitting on the twilight; the cottage-lights, now seen, and now lost—were circumstances that awakened her mind into effort, and led to enthusiasm and poetry.  Her favourite walk was to a little fishing-house, belonging to St. Aubert, in a woody glen, on the margin of a rivulet that descended from the Pyrenees, and, after foaming among their rocks, wound its silent way beneath the shades it reflected. Above the woods, that screened this glen, rose the lofty summits of the Pyrenees, which often burst boldly on the eye through the glades below. Sometimes the shattered face of a rock only was seen, crowned with wild shrubs; or a shepherd’s cabin seated on a cliff, overshadowed by dark cypress, or waving ash. Emerging from the deep recesses of the woods, the glade opened to the distant landscape, where the rich pastures and vine-covered slopes of Gascony gradually declined to the plains; and there, on the winding shores of the Garonne, groves, and hamlets, and villas—their outlines softened by distance, melted from the eye into one rich harmonious tint.  This, too, was the favourite retreat of St. Aubert, to which he frequently withdrew from the fervour of noon, with his wife, his daughter, and his books; or came at the sweet evening hour to welcome the silent dusk, or to listen for the music of the nightingale. Sometimes, too, he brought music of his own, and awakened every fairy echo with the tender accents of his oboe; and often have the tones of Emily’s voice drawn sweetness from the waves, over which they trembled.  It was in one of these excursions to this spot, that she observed the following lines written with a pencil on a part of the wainscot:  SONNET  Go, pencil! faithful to thy master’s sighs! Go—tell the Goddess of the fairy scene, When next her light steps wind these wood-walks green, Whence all his tears, his tender sorrows, rise; Ah! paint her form, her soul-illumin’d eyes, The sweet expression of her pensive face, The light’ning smile, the animated grace— The portrait well the lover’s voice supplies; Speaks all his heart must feel, his tongue would say: Yet ah! not all his heart must sadly feel! How oft the flow’ret’s silken leaves conceal The drug that steals the vital spark away! And who that gazes on that angel-smile, Would fear its charm, or think it could beguile!   These lines were not inscribed to any person; Emily therefore could not apply them to herself, though she was undoubtedly the nymph of these shades. Having glanced round the little circle of her acquaintance without being detained by a suspicion as to whom they could be addressed, she was compelled to rest in uncertainty; an uncertainty which would have been more painful to an idle mind than it was to hers. She had no leisure to suffer this circumstance, trifling at first, to swell into importance by frequent remembrance. The little vanity it had excited (for the incertitude which forbade her to presume upon having inspired the sonnet, forbade her also to disbelieve it) passed away, and the incident was dismissed from her thoughts amid her books, her studies, and the exercise of social charities.  Soon after this period, her anxiety was awakened by the indisposition of her father, who was attacked with a fever; which, though not thought to be of a dangerous kind, gave a severe shock to his constitution. Madame St. Aubert and Emily attended him with unremitting care; but his recovery was very slow, and, as he advanced towards health, Madame seemed to decline.  The first scene he visited, after he was well enough to take the air, was his favourite fishing-house. A basket of provisions was sent thither, with books, and Emily’s lute; for fishing-tackle he had no use, for he never could find amusement in torturing or destroying.  After employing himself, for about an hour, in botanizing, dinner was served. It was a repast, to which gratitude, for being again permitted to visit this spot, gave sweetness; and family happiness once more smiled beneath these shades. Monsieur St. Aubert conversed with unusual cheerfulness; every object delighted his senses. The refreshing pleasure from the first view of nature, after the pain of illness, and the confinement of a sick-chamber, is above the conceptions, as well as the descriptions, of those in health.
