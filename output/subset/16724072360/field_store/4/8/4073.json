Now we could hear their soft voices conversing in a language that was liquid with a great many compound vowel sounds, not unlike Earth's Finnish tongue. Their quick, dark eyes seemed to take in everything. They seemed torn between a consuming curiosity and a strong aversion to our scent. One by one they satisfied the former and yielded to the latter, dropping back and racing for the forest in great, joyous bounds punctuated with happy little whoops of undefinable emotion.  At last only one, chesty little male was left. Benson exhaled heavily beside me. \"It's the little fellow we saw on the beach, Sam. Look, he's coming through.\"  A tawny stripe of brown, furry hair ran from his high forehead, over the crown of his proud skull and down his neck to fade into the typical, deep, golden fuzz of his body. As he approached the ramp I saw that his face was smooth, entirely free of hair as though clean-shaven.  By now Benson was as fascinated as the rest of us. I stepped down in front of him to confront our visitor. I placed a hand on my chest and said, \"Sam Rogers!\"  The dark eyes swept from my feet to my head and fastened upon my face. He pointed four long fingers at me and repeated distinctly, \"Samrogers.\"  My name is easy to pronounce, but it was a shock to hear it from the lips of an extra-terrestrial being.  Then he placed the same hand on his own chest and said, \"Joe!\" Actually, it came out with a rapid widening and narrowing of his lips that sounded like a quick version of, \"Jo-ah-o-ah-oh,\" but the vowel echoes were so rapid that for practical purposes it read, \"Joe,\" to me.  I pointed my hand at him and repeated, \"Joe!\" He looked vaguely disappointed at my crude aspiratory control, but then a bright smile creased his cocky little face. His hand flicked out and back.  \"Samrogers--Joe.\"  Involuntarily I nodded my head. He nodded back and smiled again. Before I could think of what comes after, \"Dr. Livingstone, I presume,\" he wrinkled his nose, squinted his eyes, whirled and darted off for the timber.  We stood rooted for a minute, then Bailey said, \"We must really stink. Plucky little fellow took it as long as he could.\"  Benson looked back at Bailey and me. \"Well, what do you think?\"  I looked at Bailey, and he looked at Dr. Sorenson. \"Lord, I don't know. Except for the possibility of microbe infection, they appear perfectly harmless to me,\" Sorenson said.  I said, \"Since they don't like our scent there doesn't seem to be much danger of contact. Phil, why don't we call off the yellow alert with the exception of a rule or two about fraternization in closed spaces?\"  Benson looked over his people. All were paired off now, husband with wife. And to a man their arms were wrapped protectively around their respective spouses, watching for the decision. Their faces read, \"Is this innocuous little race of people the cause of all the trouble?\"  Benson rubbed the gray of his temple with a knuckle. He mounted the ramp and announced, \"The emergency is reduced to a blue alert. Women will have the freedom of the clearing and the visible beach, but only authorized working parties will enter the forest. Men will continue to wear sidearms. When outside shelters are complete we will sleep in them, but until then, or until we are better informed about the natives, we shall continue sleeping in the ship.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The new order of the day did nothing to mitigate the resentment and tension, but it did accelerate assembly of the lumber mill and house construction. The little Sirians seemed to have satisfied their curiosity, for they left us to our labors for a whole week.  The first building of our projected village was completed on the seventh day. It was little more than a two-room shanty, but it represented the most sought after prize of the moment, _privacy_!  We drew lots for it, and, with the uncommon justice, one of the hardest working amateur carpenters won. The women brought in armloads of grass for a couch and decorated it with wild-flowers. When evening fell it seemed like an occasion for a celebration, and Benson relented on the evening curfew.  We gathered scraps from the lumber mill, carefully cleared a sandy strip on the beach of all inflammable matter and built a huge bonfire. In the rich atmosphere even the green wood burned merrily, spitting green sap and sending up clouds of pungent, aromatic smoke.  Sue had just curled up in the crook of my arm, and we were working on a case of Earth-nostalgia, when we noticed our visitors again. They came bounding, up to the wide rim of the firelight. They jabbered in excited, ecstatic voices but stopped short of our human assembly. Only one, I recognized him as Joe, picked his way through us and came close to inspect the crackling blaze.  Fascinated, Sue and I watched his profile contort with an expression of immense admiration. It was not the awe of a savage, but the heartfelt appreciation of a human for a rare and beautiful spectacle.  \"Fire must be unknown to them,\" Sue whispered.  \"At least mighty rare,\" I said. \"The handbook says no volcanoes and no thunderstorms.\"  Joe turned at the sound of our low voices. With eyes half-blinded by the glare he searched for me. \"Samrogers!\" he called clearly. \"Samrogers!\"  I rose to my feet and answered, \"Joe! Right here, Joe.\"  He picked his way over to me, smiling broadly and glancing back at the fire every step or two. A pace away he stopped, pointed at me, said, \"Samrogers,\" pointed at himself, said, \"Joe!\" _then pointed at the fire and waited_.  It was a clearly indicated question. I answered it respectfully, \"Fire!\"  He repeated, \"Fire,\" and his eyes glowed like sparks. Then he made gestures of picking up some of the fire and taking it away, turning to me to pose the question.  Sorenson, propped up on an elbow, said, \"I'll be damned. He's asking you to give him some of the fire.\"  \"No,\" Benson said. \"He knows fire, knows you can't take the flames. He's asking for _the means to build a fire_.\"  I faced Joe, shook my head solemnly and said, \"No!\" To give meaning to the word I sat down and turned my head away for a moment. When I looked back Joe was looking very disappointed. It made Sue so sad that she held out a wedge of sweet melon to him. Joe accepted the gift easily, gracefully and with a small smile of \"thank you\". He turned back, squatted as near the blaze as comfort would permit and chewed absently at the melon.  Thereafter he ignored the animated conversation that sprang up among us. Jane wanted to know why we didn't give him one of our lighters. \"He's just as intelligent as we are,\" she insisted. She got no argument on that score, but her husband pointed out that the golden people were unaccustomed to handling fire, and that during the present dry season even the green foliage might take off in a holocaust if ignited in this rich, oxygen air.  Even as he spoke, a long, slender pole, flaming at one end, toppled from the settling fire and rolled near Joe. With scarcely a pause to debate, he leaped to his feet, grabbed the pole by the cool end and waved it aloft like a torch.  With a triumphant yell he plunged through us and out across the field bearing his prize aloft trailing sparks.  I tried to shoot low, but my light caliber pellet caught him rather high in the thigh. He dived to the ground senseless in a shower of sparks. His fellow creatures immediately gathered around him. When we closed in to retrieve the fire-wand and stamp out the sparks, the other natives faded away, crinkling their noses. They made no effort to remove Joe, but cast many admiring glances back at the fire he had stolen.  Sue came up storming at me. \"You didn't have to _shoot_ him.\" She started to kneel down beside him, but Dr. Bailey restrained her.  \"Easy, Susan. Remember the quarantine.\"  \"We can't let him lie there and bleed to death,\" I said, feeling unaccountably ashamed for my deed, although there was scarcely an alternative.  Benson came up, \"Nice shot, Sam.\"  I said, \"Phil, I want permission to enter quarantine with Joe, here. Let me have the instruments, and I'll probe for the bullet and take care of him.\"  Benson shook his head. \"We can't take that chance. We couldn't spare you if you caught something.\"  \"Who could you spare better?\" I demanded. \"See here, we've got to find out sooner or later whether these little fellows carry anything contagious. If they do, well, then we have a decision to face, but we can't decide anything until we know.\"  Sue was at my side now. She said. \"You have a dozen people who can punch a micro-writer. Sam and I aren't indispensable. Besides, it was he who crippled the poor little fellow.\"  Without waiting for an answer she called out, \"Larson, where are you?\" The lucky carpenter tried to draw back in the shadows, knowing full well what she had in mind.  Benson stared at me for a minute. He said gruffly, \"Very well, if you can talk Larson out of his cottage, go ahead, play hero!\"  I didn't feel very heroic right then. Two hours later, when we had the bullet out of Joe and had him bedded down comfortably for the night, Sue cosied up to me in our double sleeping silks and murmured, \"What a guy has to go through out here to get a little privacy!\"  Poor Larson!         *       *       *       *       *  Bailey and Sorenson set up their lab outside our cabin door. Joe's wound was seriously infected, and none of our cautiously applied remedies would control the raging fever with which he awoke the first morning. He lay, apathetic, eyes half closed, murmuring, \"Tala! Tala!\"  The doctors seized the opportunity to launch a study of Sirian microbes, diseases and earth molds. Sue and I took cultures from Joe's wound, and the medics experimented with the effects of local mold products similar to the penicillin series. By force-feeding we managed to keep Joe alive until Bailey, one"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32679"],["title","Geographic Variation in Red-backed Mice (Genus Clethrionomys) of the Southern (#1)"],["body","only): Total length, 142 (123-155); tail, 35 (30-39); hind foot, 19.5 (18.6-21.0); basal length, 23.3 (21.7-24.5); condylobasilar length, 23.3 (21.9-24.5); zygomatic breadth, 13.7 (12.9-14.7); lambdoidal breadth, 11.7 (11.3-12.9); alveolar length upper cheek-teeth, 5.5 (5.2-5.8); interorbital breadth, 3.9 (3.6-4.1); length of nasals, 7.7 (7.1-8.5); breadth of rostrum, 3.2 (2.9-3.6); and length of incisive foramina, 5.0 (4.6-5.3).  Measurements of the type and one \"more fully adult topotype\" (as given by Bailey, _op. cit._) are: Total length, 125, 130; tail length, 31, 32; hind foot, 19, 19; basal length, 21.2, 21.8; length of nasals, 6.6, 7.0; zygomatic breadth, 12.5, 12.8; mastoid breadth, 11.3, 11.0; alveolar length of upper molar series, 5.4, 5.3. In every measurement the figures for Bailey's specimens are smaller than the average of the same measurement in the 20 adults from Pennington County, and, in most measurements, are even lower than the minimum of the latter series. Therefore, we conclude that the material available to Merriam (_op. cit._) and Bailey (_op. cit._) consisted of only subadults.  In comparison with a series of 23 adult _Clethrionomys gapperi galei_ from 28 mi. E Lovell, Big Horn County, Wyoming, _C. g. brevicaudus_ has a slightly shorter tail, longer hind foot, greater basal and condylobasilar lengths, greater zygomatic and lambdoidal breadths and conspicuously longer nasals.  In comparison with three adult _C. g. loringi_ from Elk River, Sherburne County, Minnesota, _C. g. brevicaudus_ has a greater total length, longer hind foot, greater basal length, conspicuously greater zygomatic and lambdoidal breadths, much longer nasals, and a narrower rostrum.  _Clethrionomys gapperi brevicaudus_, although isolated geographically and although morphologically more distinct than many of the currently recognized subspecies of _C. gapperi_, is probably best arranged as a subspecies of _C. gapperi_ rather than as a full species. In certain characters, such as interorbital breadth and breadth of rostrum, it is intermediate between _C. g. galei_ and _C. g. loringi_, but it resembles _C. g. galei_ more than it does any other named kind.  _Specimens examined._--Total, 66. Unless otherwise indicated, specimens from Wyoming are in the University of Kansas Museum of Natural History and specimens from South Dakota are in the University of Michigan Museum of Zoology. Specimens are distributed as follows:  +Wyoming+: _Crook County_: 3 mi. NW Sundance, 5900 ft., 3. _Weston County_: 1-1/2 mi. E Buckhorn, 6150 ft., 21; 12 mi. SE Newcastle, 1 (Univ. Michigan).  +South Dakota+: _Pennington County_: 1/2 mi. E Rochford, 1; 17 mi. NW Custer, 1; 16 mi. NW Custer, 20; 16 mi. SW Rapid City, 1; 3 mi. SE Hill City, 2; 4 mi. SE Hill City, 13; 5 mi.

Washington, 54:161, Dec. 8.  _Type locality._--Paradise Park, 10,050 feet, 45 miles by road northwest Vernal, Uintah County, Utah.  _Range._--The Uinta Mountains of northern Utah and southwestern Wyoming.   _Remarks._--From the description given by Doutt (Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington, 54:161, 1941) in his original description of this subspecies, it appears that he had available for comparisons, only subadult specimens of _C. g. galei_. As judged from the material of _C. g. uintaensis_ available to us (1 topotype, KU 38081, and 7 specimens from Uinta County, Wyoming, listed below) and from Doutt's (_op. cit._) description and measurements, the subspecies _C. g. uintaensis_ is but weakly differentiated from _C. g. galei_. No marked cranial differences are evident between the two subspecies; the differences in pelage noted by Doutt (_op. cit._:161), however (\"Similar to _Clethrionomys gapperi galei_ from Ward, Colorado, but head and cheeks grayer; sides and back paler; belly whiter.\"), do seem to be valid.  On the basis of these differences in pelage and the geographic isolation of the range, we judge that _uintaensis_ should be retained as a subspecies of _C. gapperi_. It is clear, however, that _C. g. uintaensis_ is less distinct from _C. g. galei_ than are the other adjacent subspecies.  _Specimens examined._--Total, 8, all in the University of Kansas Museum of Natural History, distributed as follows:  +Wyoming+: _Uinta County_: 9 mi.

Gaut, original number 3086.  _Range._--The Rocky Mountains of north-central New Mexico and south-central Colorado.  _Diagnosis._--A brightly colored _Clethrionomys gapperi_; dorsal stripe near Chestnut (capitalized color terms after Ridgway, Color Standards and Color Nomenclature, Washington, D. C., 1912) with an underwash of near Light Ochraceous-Buff and a mixture of black-tipped guard hairs giving an over-all effect of between Tawny and Russet; braincase relatively large; zygomatic width and lambdoidal width large; nasals long.  _Comparisons._--As compared with topotypes of _C. g. galei_, the color is lighter, the dorsal reddish stripe slightly narrower, sides brighter, with a wash of Light Ochraceous-Buff, grading ventrally into a slight wash of Pale Ochraceous-Buff, instead of a silvery-white venter characteristic of _C. g. galei_; zygomatic and lambdoidal breadths are greater, nasals slightly shorter, auditory bullae slightly more inflated, teeth larger, and braincase larger.  As compared with topotypes of _C. g. limitis_, _C. g. gauti_ is darker, has a greater zygomatic breadth, longer upper tooth-row, longer nasals, and narrower rostrum.  _Measurements._--External and cranial measurements of the type, and the average and extreme measurements of four adult males and one adult female from the type locality (including the type) and five miles south of the type locality are: Total length, 144, 147 (140-152); tail, 40, 42 (39-45); hind foot, 20, 19.3 (19-20); condylobasilar length, 22.3, 22.9 (22.2-24.0); zygomatic breadth, 13.6, 13.7 (13.5-14.0); lambdoidal breadth, 11.9, 11.7 (11.4-12.0); alveolar length of upper cheek-teeth, 5.1, 5.2 (5.1-5.4); interorbital breadth, 4.0, 3.9 (3.8-4.0); length of nasals, 7.0, 7.2 (7.0-7.6); breadth of rostrum, 2.9, 3.1 (2.9-3.4); length of incisive foramina, 4.8, 5.1 (4.8-5.3).  _Remarks._--Two specimens from a locality 21 mi. W and 3 mi. N Saguache, Saguache County, Colorado, although referred to this subspecies on the basis of paler pelage, inflation of auditory bullae, and heavier teeth, show characters of _C. g. galei_ in the narrowness across the zygomata and lambdoidal crest. Four specimens from Silverton (1 adult and 3 young adults) are referable to this subspecies on the basis of color of pelage and cranial proportions but are smaller than either _C. g. gauti_ or _C. g. galei_.  The specimen from Pecos Baldy, Pecos Mountain, San Miguel County, New Mexico, referred by Bailey (N. Amer. Fauna, 52:192) to _Clethrionomys gapperi galei_, is here referred to _C. g. gauti_ on geographical grounds.  The name _gauti_ is proposed in honor of the collector of the type specimen, James H. Gaut.  _Specimens examined._--Total, 14, distributed as follows and, unless otherwise stated, in the Biological Surveys Collection:  +Colorado+: _Saguache County_: 21 mi. W and 3 mi. N Saguache, N 38°, 106° 31´, 9100 ft., 2 (Univ. Kansas Mus. Nat. Hist.). _San Juan Co._: Silverton, 4.  +New Mexico+: _Taos County_: Twining, 10,700 ft., 3; 5 mi. S Twining, 11,400 ft., 3. _Sandoval County_: Goat Peak, Jemez Mountains, 1. _Colfax County_: 15 mi. SW Cimarron, 9000 ft., 1 (Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist.).  _Additional records._--+New Mexico+: _San Miguel Co._: Pecos Baldy, Pecos Mountain, 1 (Bailey, N. Amer. Fauna, 52:192, 1932).     +Clethrionomys gapperi limitis+ (Bailey)  1913. _Evotomys limitis_ Bailey, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington, 26:133,    May 21.  _Type locality._--Willow Creek, a branch of the Gilita, 8500 ft., Mogollon Mountains, Catron County, New Mexico.  _Range._--Known from the Mogollon, San Mateo, and Magdalena mountains of western New Mexico.   _Remarks._--Bailey (Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington, 26:133, May 21, 1913) described this animal as a species and gave as general characteristics: \"Size slightly larger than _E._ [= _Clethrionomys gapperi_] _galei_; colors duller, grayer and less buffy; skull and dentition heavier.\" He further characterized the skull as: \"Larger, heavier and conspicuously more ridged than in _galei_; bullae large and especially deep; dentition heavy throughout.\" The type of _C. limitis_, as judged from the measurements given by Bailey (_loc. cit._), is an exceptionally old male.  Our comparison of six adult topotypes with a series of _C. g. galei_ from Wyoming (18 adults from 3 mi. SSE Browns Peak, 10,000 ft., Albany County, in Univ. Kansas Mus. Nat. Hist.) and with three near-topotypes of _C. g. galei_ (3 mi. S Ward, 9000 ft., Boulder County, Colorado, in Univ. Kansas Mus. Nat. Hist.) revealed that most of the differences noted by"]]]
