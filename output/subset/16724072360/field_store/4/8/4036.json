Blood pounded in his ears and a chill eagerness laid hold upon him. He leaned forward and would have shouted. Allison and Tommy and the whole British Broadcasting System would likely get the benefit of it if he cut loose with a cowboy yell. He closed his mouth firmly and fixed his eyes on the aileron slit ahead. The 1,000-horsepower Merlin engine was throbbing, hurtling him up and into the night. He could feel the assuring Brownings in the wings, ready to spew a hail of lead at the enemy. He did not realize it but beads of sweat stood on his forehead.  He was glad he was coming out of the narrow channel of terror which was charted anew each week. The notch was guarded by unseen, steel cables, slender knives of spun death, waiting to slice through the wing of a plane like a knife cutting through hot cheese. Or to come coiling down upon any ship that struck them squarely. The hydrogen bloated monsters that held the cables aloft swayed and tugged, sometimes swinging the steel lines far out into the notch.  Out of this avenue the three Spitfires bored. When they were clear Allison's drawl came in clearly:  \"Pick yourself a bandit.\"  Two blades of silver light knifed upward. They swept back and forth, then stopped, remaining straight up. This was a signal Allison understood perfectly.  \"Four bandits, quarter left,\" he snapped.  Before Stan could lay over, Allison's Spitfire was hurtling across his hatch cover, zooming up at the droning bombers. A second later he sighted a big Dornier just as she lurched upward in a frantic effort to avoid Allison's Brownings.  A half-smile came to the lips of Stan Wilson. Everything they had said about March Allison was correct. He was a demon in the air. Stan shot his Spitfire up at the belly of the floundering Dornier. He had no time to play spectator. Pressing the gun button he felt the kick of his eight Brownings as they drilled away. Pinkish flames spurted from the mid-section of the bomber as it whirled about, sliding off on one wing with flames, red now, belching out of it. It turned over and four men tumbled out. Stan watched long enough to see their chutes blossom against the red glow of gunfire from below. He was glad that the crew had been able to bail out.  On his right Stan saw tracer bullets from Allison's guns. He made out a dark hulk twisting and turning, then the hulk was lighted as the Nazi craft went down in flames. He couldn't spot Tommy as he zoomed upward and in a split second he lost Allison. Circling, he throttled down and let the Spitfire cruise. A chill feeling gripped the pit of his stomach. This was new stuff for him. He was out in the darkness roaring in a steep circle, looking for another bomber, but mostly waiting to hear Allison's voice. He knew the unseen cables were swaying and reaching, eager to knife him or to snarl his plane. Losing a wing wouldn't be as bad as having the cable come down on you. If you tangle in a cable you can't bail out. Stan peered down at the muck of shellfire below. He knew he wouldn't be able to hit the notch without help from at least one of the veterans.  Then he saw a searchlight beam pick up a dark shape below. It was a bomber going down to unload. Stan nosed over and sent the Spitfire down in a screaming dive. The flaming field of muck leaped up to meet him and shells burst close. As Stan closed in on the dive bomber it suddenly seemed to explode in his face.  Instantly Stan knew the cables had gotten the bandit. Frantically, he pulled the Spitfire up and sent her roaring toward the ceiling. He sucked in his breath as he brushed past one of the bloated gas bags. That was a score for the Ack-Ack gunners and the ground boys. Then he heard Allison's voice, cool and cheerful.  \"Come in close, Red Flight. Somebody got two bandits. Who got two bandits?\"  Stan slid over and down, sure now of his position. Ahead, he spotted Tommy and then Allison. They rocketed down through the notch, as sure of the narrow pathway as though the noonday sun was shining on the cables. Stan ducked in on Tommy's tail and went home with them.  \"Why ask silly questions,\" Tommy was shouting to Allison. \"Allison got one, Wilson got one, the Ack-Ack boys got one. Tommy got nothing except Allison's Spitfire in his lap.\"  Allison's voice came back in a sarcastic drawl. \"I just shut my eyes and cut loose. When I opened them, there was a bandit minus one wing. How about you, Wilson?\"  Stan cuddled his flap mike and laughed. He was sure of himself now. He had hit the glory trail and could laugh at its terrors. \"I just did potshooting. Later I'll clip off tails and wings for you.\"  \"Later?\" There was that mocking note in Allison's voice.  The recall signal was calling them in. They swung over the blacked-out city and headed for home. Ten minutes later they did a parachute walk into the briefing room. Brooks, Squadron Leader, eyed them wearily. He acted as though he hadn't had any sleep for a good many nights, which was about correct. The three pilots moved over to his high desk and reached for report forms.  \"Everybody all right?\" the Squadron Leader asked as he began filling out their time record.  \"Fit as flying fish,\" Tommy answered, grinning broadly. \"Me, I like balloons.\" He winked at Stan.  \"Shut up,\" Allison snapped.  \"What did you spend on yours?\" Brooks asked, looking at Allison.  \"Six or eight seconds in one burst,\" Allison answered.  \"Hundred rounds,\" the officer jotted down. Then he looked at Tommy. Tommy nodded toward Stan.  \"Eight or ten, I guess. I used a pretty long burst,\" Stan admitted.  \"One hundred thirty rounds, eight seconds,\" the officer jotted down.  A few minutes later Stan strolled into the mess with Allison. He felt tired and would have gone to his cubicle only he wanted to see what the boys did when they came in.  \"Black coffee, that's the thing for balloon nerves,\" Allison said and looked sharply at Stan. \"It's on me.\" He waved a hand to the mess corporal and called. \"Two, black.\" Facing Stan, with a glint of humor in his eyes, he said. \"Not bad, old man, but you're a Yank and you learned to fly in a fighter. And I think you'd best break down and tell me about it.\"  \"Sorry, but I can't think of a story you'd believe,\" Stan said and grinned to hide his uneasiness. Allison was sharp as a tack. He had it in his head that Stan was a Yank, which would have been all right except that no Yank needed to masquerade as a Canadian to get into the Royal Air Force. Not a flier like Stan Wilson.  They sank into chairs and waited for the coffee. Tommy hadn't showed up and they had the mess to themselves. Allison leaned forward.  \"I think the old man has something special up his sleeve,\" he said. \"When he acts tough and gets hard he's about to cook up a messy job. Want in on it if it comes?\" He was grinning at Stan in his most derisive manner. He might just as well have added, \"Of course you won't want in.\"  \"Check me in,\" Stan said stiffly.  \"Fine.\" Allison leaned back and elevated his legs to the top of the table. \"Fine. I figure the old man is going to give us a one-way ticket.\"  \"A what?\" Stan asked. The way Allison spoke made a chill run up his spine.  Allison turned his head and looked at Stan. \"In the last war when fighters were sent out as scouts they had to come back to report. In this man's war they radio back their reports. After that they play tag with a swarm of Messerschmitt One-Tens.\"  \"I see.\" Stan could well imagine what sort of tag three Spitfires would play with a dozen or more ME's. It was just plain suicide stuff. \"Ever been on one?\" he asked.  Allison grinned widely. \"Once. A cloud, plus eight Brownings and a lot of fool's luck, brought me back with most of my ship. It beats hitting the glory trail every night.\"  \"Sounds interesting,\" Stan agreed as he pulled his steaming cup of coffee to him and began dropping sugar lumps into it. \"I aim to get a kick out of it.\"  Allison laughed. \"Hanged if I don't believe you will. You'll go if I do any of the picking.\"  \"And about this Yank business.\" Stan looked Allison squarely in the eye. \"It isn't international. It isn't a violation of any of the laws of Britain or any country. It's a personal matter. If you keep on talking about it you'll lose a flier, that's certain.\"  \"I see,\" Allison said, but he kept on grinning his superior grin. \"I knew it wasn't anything rotten. Sorry I was nosey. It won't come up before anyone, Yank.\" He lifted his cup. \"Here's to the glory trail!\"  Stan joined him. Tommy came in and sprawled out on a bench with his feet against the wall. He looked over at Allison and Stan.  \"The O.C. says Green Flight is taking over for the rest of the night, so you birds can go to bed.\"  \"Where are you going?\" Allison asked.  Tommy uncoiled himself and stood up. He began humming a snatch of song, stopped abruptly and answered Allison.  \"Too quiet around here for me.\" Without any further explanation he strolled out.  \"That nut can't get action enough running the notch. He's on his way over to a bombing squadron. He'll talk the O.C. into letting him go on a bombing raid as a gunner.\" Allison got to his feet. \"Me, I'm going to bed.\"  \"Reckon I will, too,\" Stan answered.     CHAPTER II  CLOUD TAG   Stan entered the mess room the next morning and stood looking around. There was the same air of indifference, with that undercurrent of tension. A dozen men were eating breakfast at the tables in the far end. They were all talking and joking, but at any moment they might be called to face the grim specter of death high in the clouds. Stan spotted Allison sitting by himself at a small table near a window. He looked about for Tommy but the lanky flier wasn't in the room. Probably sleeping in after an all-night party aboard a bomber, thought Stan.  He crossed the room and as he approached Allison he saw that the Flight Lieutenant's breakfast lay untouched before him. His coffee looked cold and stale."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32420"],["title","A Yankee Flier with the R.A.F. (#2)"],["body"," it was the grimness of his face that jolted Stan. Allison looked up and there were savage points of light in his eyes. His mouth twisted into a sardonic grin.  \"Sit down, Stan,\" he said, using Stan's first name, something he hadn't done before.  \"What's up?\" Stan demanded quickly as he slid into a chair.  \"We're on day shift,\" Allison said. \"Sunshine all the way.\"  \"Where's Tommy?\" Stan drove at the thought that had leaped into his mind.  Allison looked at him and his lips pulled into a thin line. \"The kid picked up a package last night. A Flak-88 laid a shell right up against the Bristol and cracked her open.\"  Stan said nothing for a minute. He knew that the words of the Flight Lieutenant were likely the last he would say about Tommy Lane's last ride. Then something like red fire surged up inside him.  \"We'll keep him in mind,\" he said grimly.  \"I'll see that the score keeps even,\" Allison said and savage lights flickered hot in his eyes.  The mess corporal appeared with a private at his heels. \"We have some very fine waffles,\" he said.  \"Bring me black coffee,\" Stan growled.  \"And waffles?\"  \"Sure, sure.\"  The corporal turned away. It worried him that his fliers were so temperamental they didn't eat enough of his food.  Allison shoved aside his cold coffee. \"We have a new man coming in. He ought to be here any minute now.\"  Ten minutes later a tall man entered the mess. He stood looking around, then spoke to one of the privates. The soldier nodded toward Allison, and the tall youngster headed across the room.  \"Here he comes,\" Allison muttered sourly.  Stan saw a black-haired, hawk-faced young man of perhaps twenty. The new flier had a big mouth that was pulled into a loose frown as his dark eyes stabbed about the room, pausing to rest for a moment upon each face. He walked with a swagger and his uniform was neatly creased. At first glance Stan didn't think much of him.  \"Hello,\" he greeted Allison. \"Are you Flight Lieutenant Allison?\"  \"Sure. Sit down and have something.\"  \"I'm Arch Garret. The O.C. sent me over to plug a hole in Red Flight. I'll take care of you boys.\" He glanced at Allison's sloppy uniform and then at Stan's, which was little better.  \"That's nice of you, old man,\" Allison said in a soft drawl.  Then Arch Garret began to tell how good he was, and how many Messerschmitt One-Tens he had knocked off in coast combat. He spoke loudly so that all in the room could hear. After listening for a few minutes, Allison yawned and got to his feet. Without a word he walked away.  Stan was sure Garret hadn't had all the experience he claimed. One thing was certain: Stan knew the new flier would soon have the gang down on him. He listened silently to Arch Garret's talk while he finished his waffles and coffee.  \"I'm from the United States,\" Garret said. \"I was the best test pilot Lockheed ever had or ever will have. Spinning those Yank jobs was too slow for me. I had to have action.\" Garret smoothed a closely cropped little mustache and swelled out his chest.  Stan pretended to be dumb, but he was looking Arch Garret over very closely. He knew every ace test pilot Lockheed had had in the past five years. He was sure Garret was lying.  He was about to ask some questions when the intersquadron speaker began snapping and clicking. A voice filled the room.  \"Red Flight, all out! Red Flight, all out!\"  \"That's us,\" Stan said as he jumped to his feet. \"Sorry, you'll have to miss your coffee.\"  Arch Garret's manner changed at once. He quit bragging and seemed to be a little nervous as he got to his feet.  \"Where are we headed?\"  \"I don't know,\" Stan snapped.  They barged out of the mess close upon Allison's heels. Everything was rush, with parachutes to adjust and flying suits to climb into. Stan paid no more attention to Garret until they were outside.  The three Spitfires of Red Flight were throbbing with restrained power on the cab rank. Stan felt better about sliding into his cockpit because the sun was shining and he could see the silver wires attached to the hydrogen gorged balloons. This was better.  The flight sergeants had cleared the ships and Allison had gotten his orders from the recording officer. In another minute the lead Spitfire had cramped about and was sliding toward the line. Stan swung into place and watched Garret get set. The new flier slid his plane up to the line with showy flash, gunning and idling the big motor in a way that made Stan's nerves rasp. To him a motor was a living thing and he hated to see one abused.  \"Steady, Red Flight,\" Allison was snapping into his flap mike. \"Check your temperatures.\"  Stan called back his O.K. Garret did not clear. Allison's voice came in angry, cold.  \"Are you set, Garret?\"  \"Sure, big boy, I'm always set,\" Garret replied.  \"Then sound off as you should,\" Allison snapped.  A second later they were off, tails lifting, boring across the turf. With a wrenching lift, they bounced up and lifted into the blue where big clouds floated over the city of London. Allison's voice came in. The crispness was gone and the drawl was there again.  \"Close formation, and keep it close all the way out. We're headed for emergency work below the Thames estuary. Junkers Ju 87's for breakfast.\"  The Spitfires closed in and roared away, gaining altitude as they bored into the early morning light. In a very short time the twisting streets, the masses of little squares that were blocks of buildings faded away below them. Allison took them up above the fleecy clouds and into the great, high-piled formations.  \"Ought to find them sneaking around up here,\" he drawled.  Stan looked out upon the mountains of clouds and the patches of blue sky. The Junkers Ju 87's were dive bombers, popularly known as Stukas, and their presence meant a raid upon shipping.  \"Red Flight, keep west by south. Red Flight, keep west by south.\" It was the control room at the field sending them directions from the big room with the table which had a huge map spread on it. On that map were toy planes which the watchers shoved about with wooden rakes.  Ahead, Allison broke out of the feathery edge of a cloud into a great valley of clear blue. Stan sliced through the cloud close beside him. Garret was trailing a little now.  \"Three Stukas cruising, four points right,\" Allison grated. \"Three Stukas. Don't let one of them get away or he'll come back again.\"  Instantly the Spitfires broke formation and Allison went plummeting down, his Merlin roaring wide open. His twisting flight was an amazing show of cold skill. Stan peeled off and shot after him. He was sure Allison had picked the Stuka on the right so he took the one on the left, leaving the center bomber for Garret, who wasn't getting in as fast as he should.  \"Easy, a cinch!\" Allison's voice roared out of Stan's headset. \"Here's one for Tommy.\"  Stan saw his Spitfire lay over on her side and slice down upon the Stuka, her eight Brownings drilling flame and lead. The startled crew of the bomber immediately came to life. They had been craning their necks, looking for slow crawling freighters headed into port. They sent the Stuka into a nose dive, spewing bombs to lighten their load, but they were not fast enough. Stan saw the right wing of the big raider rise, then whirl away. The Stuka spun out of the square space in his windscreen doing grotesque loops.  Ahead lay Stan's target and his thumb pressed gently on his gun button as he roared down. His Brownings opened up and he saw the Stuka stagger and swerve as he thundered past in a hissing dive. Coming up he noticed that Garret's Stuka was streaking away toward the south with Garret making a feeble try at coming up under the big ship.  \"Missed a dead target,\" Stan said grimly. \"He hasn't fired a single burst.\"  Then Allison's voice cracked in over the air. \"Messerschmitts up above in the big cloud. They're coming down. Seven in all.\" His words snapped off in a sputter of crackling static. Stan nosed up and saw the seven fighters diving upon Allison. Then he heard Allison's voice again.  \"Better let me have them. Keep clear!\"  Stan yelled into the flap mike. \"Coming, Allison.\"  He gave the Spitfire all she had and the Merlin wound up beautifully, lifting him up to meet the fighters diving out of the cloud above. As he went up he looked for Garret. At that moment they sure needed all of Red Flight. He spotted Garret diving for a great thunderhead.  \"The scum,\" Stan snarled. He shot the words into the flap mike without realizing it.  It did not seem possible that Allison could escape from the deathtrap. The Stuka setup had been too easy after all. The Spitfires were twisting upward, straight on to meet the seven diving Messerschmitts, any one of which was near their match. Stan knew the boys at the controls of those ships were good fliers.  Allison's ship rolled over suddenly and fell away, then hit a steep spiral climb. For a few seconds it knifed along on its back. The maneuver threw the seven fighters off for a moment, giving Stan time to get more lift and more ceiling. Allison laid over in a vertical bank, and, as he swung back his guns, cut a swath across the enemy craft. One Messerschmitt went into a crazy whirl.  After that Stan was busy with his own end. He cut across the path of a streaking fighter and sawed off his tail so neatly it seemed to have vanished by itself. But the next second he had a brace of roaring guns in his face and the hatch cover above his head shattered, showering him with glass and pieces of metal. His engine did not falter as he stalled and slid off after the Nazi, his Brownings ripping away. The fighter dodged and twisted and got away, though it was plainly hit.  As he dived to shake off another red-hot gunner he saw Allison going straight at another Messerschmitt, the only one in his field of vision. He waited for the burst from Allison's guns that would send the Nazi down, but it did not come and Allison thundered over the enemy ship, taking a ripping hail of lead as he "]]]
