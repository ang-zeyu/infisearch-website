The one adult female (skull only, with body measurements) from the southwestern end of Dezadeash Lake has a shorter skull than does any adult female of _T. h. columbiensis_. No skins of adults are in the series, but the skins of three subadults have darker upper parts, a darker tail and less olivaceous sides than _T. h. columbiensis_.   Tamiasciurus hudsonicus preblei A. H. Howell  Red Squirrel      _Tamiasciurus hudsonicus preblei_ A. H. Howell, Proc. Biol. Soc.   Washington, 49:133, August 22, 1936. (Type from Fort Simpson,   Mackenzie District, Northwestern Territories.)  _Specimens examined._--Total 3, as follows: _Alaska_: Chatanika River, 700 ft., 14 mi. E and 25 mi. N Fairbanks, 1; N side Salcha River, 600 ft., 25 mi. S and 20 mi. E Fairbanks, 1; Yerrick Creek, 21 mi. W and 4 mi. N Tok Junction, 1.  _Remarks._--In comparison with specimens of _T. h. hudsonicus_ from Iskwasum Lake, District of the Pas, Manitoba, the squirrel from Yerrick Creek, an adult female, is larger and paler on the upper parts and tail.  The squirrel taken at Yerrick Creek was captured in a rat trap; Alcorn found these animals to be \"fairly common\" in that area. He obtained no evidence that the natives use them for food.   Marmota monax ochracea Swarth  Woodchuck      _Marmota ochracea_ Swarth, Univ. California Publ. Zoöl., 7:203,   February 18, 1911. (Type from Forty-mile Creek, Alaska.)      _Marmota monax ochracea_ A. H. Howell, N. Amer. Fauna, 37:34,   April 7, 1915.  _Specimens examined._--Total 3, as follows: _British Columbia_: Hot Springs, 3 mi. WNW jct. Trout River and Liard River, 1; ¼ mi. S jct. Trout River and Liard River, 2.   Citellus parryii plesius (Osgood)  Parry Ground Squirrel      _Spermophilis empetra plesius_ Osgood, N. Amer. Fauna, 19:29,   October 6, 1900. (Type from Bennett City, head of Lake Bennett,   British Columbia.)      _Citellus paryii plesius_ A. H. Howell, N. Amer. Fauna, 56:97,   May 18, 1938.   _Specimens examined._--Total 42, as follows: _Alaska_: Richardson Highway, 2000 ft., 32 mi. S and 4 mi. W Big Delta, 5. _Yukon Territory_: 6 mi. SW Kluane, 2550 ft., 1; McIntyre Creek, 2250 ft., 3 mi. NW Whitehorse, 1; 2 mi. NNW Whitehorse, 2100 ft., 1; 1 mi. NE Whitehorse, 1; ½ mi. W Whitehorse, 2150 ft., 1; SW end Dezadeash Lake, 1; 2 mi. W Teslin River, 2400 ft., 16 mi. S and 56 mi. E Whitehorse, 7; 1½ mi. E Tatshenshini River, 1½ mi. S and 3 mi. E Dalton Post, 3. _British Columbia_: Stonehouse Creek, 5½ mi. W jct. Stonehouse Creek and Kelsall River, 14; W side Mt. Glave, 4000 ft., 14 mi. S and 2 mi. E Kelsall Lake, 7.  _Remarks._--The specimens vary much in color; most color variation is the result of wear and fading. In pallor of coloration the specimens taken on August 16 along the Richardson Highway, 32 miles south and 4 miles west of Big Delta, Alaska, show some resemblance to _C. p. ablusus_, which occurs to the westward, although in other diagnostic characters these specimens are typically _C. p. plesius_.  Specimens in early stages of molt were taken on July 3, 4, and 14; another specimen in an advanced stage of molt was obtained on July 10. One melanistic individual was taken one mile northeast of Whitehorse on July 11.  Alcorn found these ground squirrels locally abundant, especially in the vicinity of Whitehorse in Yukon Territory. A large population was observed along the highway west of the Teslin River; animals were seen for several miles along the road, principally in open coniferous forests where there was little or no underbrush. Alcorn caught several animals near the city dump at Whitehorse. Along the Richardson Highway he observed these ground squirrels almost continuously for approximately ten miles. He comments that the animals appeared to be more numerous in the man-cleared areas along the highway than in \"unmolested areas farther back from the highway.\" Specimens were taken with collecting gun and in rat traps baited with \"chewed\" rolled oats.   Eutamias minimus borealis (J. A. Allen)  Least Chipmunk      _Tamias asiaticus borealis_ J. A. Allen, Monogr. N. Amer. Rodentia,   p. 793, August, 1877. (Type from Fort Liard, Mackenzie, Canada.)      _Eutamias minimus borealis_ A. H. Howell, Jour. Mamm., 3:183,   August 4, 1922.  _Specimens examined._--Total 10, as follows: _British Columbia_: N side Muskwa River, 1200 ft., 4 mi. W Fort Nelson, 1; E side Minaker River, 1 mi. W Trutch, 5; Beatton River, 115 mi. S Fort Nelson, 1; 5 mi. W. and 3 mi. N Fort St. John, 1. _Alberta_: Assineau River, 1920 ft., 10 mi. E and 1 mi. N Kinuso, 2.  _Remarks._--Specimens with worn pelage are conspicuously paler and grayer than those in fresh pelage. Chipmunks in early stages of molt with fresh pelage extending posteriorly to the middle of the dorsal part of the back were taken on June 19, 20, and 22; others in fresh pelage above, except for the hind quarters, were taken on June 15 and on September 2.  Alcorn found this species nowhere abundant; for example, in 187 museum special traps set near Charlie Lake, 5 miles west and 3 miles north of Fort St. John, in British Columbia, he took only one chipmunk.   Eutamias minimus caniceps Osgood  Least Chipmunk      _Eutamias caniceps_ Osgood, N. Amer. Fauna, 19:28, October 6, 1900.   (Type from Lake Lebarge, Yukon Territory.)      _Eutamias minimus caniceps_ A. H. Howell, Jour. Mamm., 3:184,   August 4, 1922.  _Specimens examined._--Total 36, as follows: _Yukon Territory_: 6 mi. SW Kluane, 2550 ft., 2; McIntyre Creek, 2250 ft., 3 mi. NW Whitehorse, 3; 2 mi. NNW Whitehorse, 2100 ft., 1; W side Lewes River, 2150 ft., 2 mi. S Whitehorse, 1; SW end Dezadeash Lake, 10; 5 mi. W Teslin River, 2400 ft., 16 mi. S and 53 mi. E Whitehorse, 1; W side Teslin River, 16 mi. S and 58 mi. E Whitehorse, 2; 1½ mi. S and 3 mi. E Dalton Post, 2500 ft., 5. _British Columbia_: 1 mi. NW jct. Irons Creek and Liard River, 2; S side Toad River, 10 mi. S and 21 mi. E Muncho Lake, 6; Summit Pass, 4200 ft., 10 mi. S and 70 mi. W Fort Nelson, 3.  _Remarks._--Some of the specimens taken between Summit Pass and Toad River show evidence of intergradation between the paler and grayer _E. m. caniceps_ and the brighter and browner _E. m. borealis_. Rand (1944:41) also found evidence of intergradation between these two subspecies in this area.  Along the highway, Alcorn found this species to be somewhat more abundant in the Yukon Territory than in British Columbia. He often found the animals occupying abandoned road camps; seemingly they were more numerous in these areas than in undisturbed natural habitat.   Glaucomys sabrinus zaphaeus (Osgood)  Flying Squirrel      _Sciuropterus alpinus zaphaeus_ Osgood, Proc. Biol. Soc.   Washington, 18:133, April 18, 1905. (Type from Helm Bay, Cleveland   Peninsula, southeastern Alaska.)      _Glaucomys sabrinus zaphaeus_ A. H. Howell, N. Amer. Fauna, 44:43,   June 13, 1918.  _Specimens examined._--One from _Yukon Territory_: 1½ mi. S and 3 mi. E Dalton Post, 2500 ft.  _Remarks._--Although comparative material is not available at this writing, descriptions in the literature indicate that this single adult female belongs to the coastal form, _G. s. zaphaeus_. In both color and in cranial and external measurements, this specimen appears to agree closely with descriptions given by Howell (1918:43) and by Cowan (1937:78 and 82), although its measurements are also in the range of those given for _G. s. alpinus_ by Cowan (_loc. cit._). It may be pointed out that Swarth (1936:402) regarded a specimen from 15 miles south of Atlin, British Columbia, as _G. s. alpinus_.  Measurements of Alcorn's specimen are as follows: total length, 331; tail, 143; hind foot, 42; ear from notch, 23; greatest length of skull, 41.7; zygomatic breadth, 25.7; mastoid breadth, 21.7; length of nasals, 12.2; length maxillary tooth-row, 8.2; interorbital constriction, 8.2; and postorbital constriction, 9.0.

NE Barkerville, British Columbia.)  _Specimens examined._--Two from _British Columbia_: Fort Halkett, N side Liard River.  _Remarks._--Two beaver skulls obtained by Alcorn from trapper Johnny Pie appear to be of this subspecies. Anderson (1947:133) records this subspecies from the Liard River, in the area from which these specimens were taken. The trapper told Alcorn that he shot these two beavers in the winter of 1947-48 and hung the skulls in a tree.   Peromyscus maniculatus algidus Osgood  White-footed Mouse      _Peromyscus maniculatus algidus_ Osgood, N. Amer. Fauna, No. 28:56,   April 17, 1909.

Stonehouse Creek and Kelsall River, 8.  _Remarks._--Specimens from the localities listed above are in the geographic range of _P. m. algidus_ as outlined by Anderson (1947: 136). Specimens from the vicinity of Haines, Alaska, are slightly darker indicating intergradation with _P. m. hylaeus_; Osgood (1909a: 54 and 56) also noted that intergradation between _P. m. algidus_ and _P. m. hylaeus_ occurs in this area.

Dixmude was an epic then, or, as M. Victor Giraud proposes, a French _geste_, but a _geste_ in which the heroism is entirely without solemnity or deliberation, where the nature of the seaman asserts itself at every turn, where there are thunder, lightning, rain, mud, cold, bullets, shrapnel, high explosive shells, and all the youthful gaiety of the French race.  And this epic did not come to an end at Dixmude. The brigade did not ground arms after November 10. The gaps in its ranks being filled from the dépôts, it was kept up to the strength of two regiments, and reaped fresh laurels. At Ypres and Saint Georges it charged the troops of Prince Ruprecht of Bavaria and the Duke of Würtemberg in succession. Dixmude was but one panel of the triptych: on the broken apex of the black capital of the Communiers, on the livid backgrounds of the flat country about Nieuport, twice again did the brigade inscribe its stormy silhouette.  But at Ypres and Saint Georges the sailors had the bulk of the Anglo-French forces behind them; at Dixmude up to November 4 they knew that their enterprise was a forlorn hope. And in their hands they held the fate of the two Flanders. One of the heroes of Dixmude, Naval Lieutenant Georges Hébert, said that the Fusiliers had gained more than a naval battle there. My only objection to this statement is its modesty. Dixmude was our Thermopylæ in the north, as the Grand-Couronné, near Nancy, was our Thermopylæ in the east; the Fusiliers were the first and the most solid element of the long triumphant defensive which will one day be known as the victory of the Yser, a victory less decisive and perhaps less brilliant than that of the Marne, but not less momentous in its consequences.  The Generalissimo is credited with a dictum which he may himself have uttered with a certain astonishment:  \"You are my best infantrymen,\" said he to the Fusiliers.  We will close with these simple, soldierly words, more eloquent than the most brilliant harangues. The brigade will reckon them among their proudest trophies to all time.  FOOTNOTES:  [1] We may perhaps be allowed to note that _Dixmude_ appeared in the _Revue des Deux Mondes_, March 1 and 15, before any other study on the subject.

TOWARDS GHENT   On the morning of October 8 two troop trains passed each other in the station of Thourout. One contained Belgian Carabiniers; the other, French Marines. They exchanged greetings from their respective lines. The Carabiniers waved their little yellow-bound caps and cried: \"Long live France!\" The sailors replied by hurrahs in honour of Belgium.  \"Where are you going?\" asked a Belgian officer.  \"To Antwerp. And you?\"  \"To France.\"  He explained that the Carabiniers were recruits from La Campine, who were being sent to our lines to finish their training.  \"You'll soon get them into shape, won't you?\" said a sailor to the officer. And shaking his fist at the horizon, he added:  \"Don't you worry, Lieutenant! We shall get at the scum some day, never fear.\"  The Belgian officer who describes the scene, M. Edouard de Kayser,[3] had left Antwerp during the night. He did not know that the defence was at its last gasp, and that the evacuation had begun. Our sailors were no better informed. Rear-Admiral Ronarc'h, who was in command, thought that he was taking his brigade to Dunkirk; he had been given a week to form it and organise it on the footing of two regiments (six battalions and a machine-gun company). Everything had to be evolved: the complement of officers, the men, the auxiliary services. This arduous task was complicated by the lack of cohesion among the elements of the brigade and perpetual changes of quarters (Creil, Stains, Pierrefitte, etc.). But the idea of forming infantry brigades with sailors was an after-thought. Article 11 of the Law of August 8, 1913, certainly permitted any surplus men in the navy to be used for service in the field, but the manner in which these contingents were to be employed had never been clearly defined. Would they be linked to existing bodies, or would they be formed into separate units? The latter alternative, by far the most reasonable, which effected a gradual transition, and, while connecting the naval combatant with the land forces, preserved his somewhat jealous but very stimulating _esprit de corps_, was by no means unanimously approved. The Minister overruled objections, and he was well advised. The glorious lessons of 1870, of Le Bourget and Le Mans, had taught him what to expect from the co-operation of navy and army. Some preparation was of course necessary. Strictly speaking, a navy is made to navigate, and this explains a certain neglect of drill; these men in new clothes, \"_capelés_\" (cloaked), as they say, in the new fashion, their caps bereft of pompons,[4] their collarless tunics buttoned up to the throat, had be transformed into soldiers. Handy as sailors proverbially are, a certain stiffness of movement in the early days betrayed the inexperience of these sea-birds, whose wings had been clipped; they were further hampered by heavy infantry overcoats. The brigade was sent almost immediately to the entrenched camp of Paris.[5] Scarcely had it settled into its quarters when its commander received orders to be ready to start for Dunkirk, where a new army was being formed. Dunkirk was not yet threatened; the brigade would be able to complete its organisation there. The order was dated October 4. On the morning of the 7th the brigade entrained at Saint Denis and at Villetaneuse with its convoys.  [Illustration: Phot. _Excelsior_  THE FLAG OF THE BRIGADE]  \"We are comfortably installed in cattle-trucks,\" notes Fusilier R. in his pocket-book. \"At Creil we see houses that were burnt by the Germans. Night comes; we try to sleep, but in vain. It is very cold. We shiver in our trucks.\" But over the dunes, along which the train had been running since it left Boulogne, a patch of purple light appeared; then other fires twinkled, green and red, and the keen breath of the open sea made itself felt--Dunkirk. Here a surprise awaited the brigade: a change in the orders; it was not to turn out, but the trains were to go on \"towards Belgium, towards the enemy,\" to Antwerp, in short.  The men stamped with joy. They hung over the doors of the trucks, waving their caps in greeting to Belgian territory.[6] The Admiral went off in the first train with his staff. On the afternoon of the 8th he found General Pau on the platform at Ghent. The great organiser of the connections between the Allied Armies had just left Antwerp, where he had been to plan out the retreat of the Belgian army with King Albert. He informed the Admiral that the railway had been cut above the town, and that the six divisions which were defending Antwerp had begun to fall back upon Bruges; two divisions were echeloned to"]]]
