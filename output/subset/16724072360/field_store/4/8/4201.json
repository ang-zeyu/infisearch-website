Take her out!\"  The two men removed the girl. To the remaining sheriff, Miss Bestris said, \"Damn you, if you ever do anything like that again, I'll ... I'll....\"  \"I'm sorry, Madame. But we wanted immediate identification. Would you want us to hold the wrong girl?\"  \"That's her, all right! Now, get out! Wait for me in my office.\"  When they were gone Miss Bestris turned to the silent room. In quite passable Esperanto she said, \"I--am sorry. A misunderstanding. I assure you, nothing. Go on with the party, and I'll see what I can do for the poor girl.\"  She stood up and in her own language said, \"Lively, girls! Smile! You, Rita, hurry and serve tea!\"  She made her exit.  The spacemen grumbled among themselves, coughed uneasily, watched the closed door through which the Madame had gone. Listening, they could hear only a muted mumble of sing-song sounds in several voices.  With determined animation, the girls moved about, smiled, chatted.  Rita came in, wheeling the tea tray, and the girls converged on it, each trying to be the first to serve her escort. The tea was the Martian stuff, concocted of a kind of local hemp. The Earthmen found it harsh and bitter to the taste, but gentle on the soul.  Anne had filled two cups and returned to the second mate when she caught sight of Mary coming down the stairs.  On the lowest step, Mary stood for a long time; her eyes eagerly searched the crowd. Slowly a puzzled, hurt look came over her face.  June came to her side after a little while.  \"Isn't he here?\"  \"No. Not yet.\"  \"I'm sorry,\" June said, touching Mary's arm lightly.  \"It's all right. It's early yet. I'll just sit down by Miss Bestris' chair and wait for him.\"  She turned from June and went to the chair. Before she could sit down, a space corporal came over, bowed, tried to take her hand. She shook her head. He smiled twistedly and walked stiffly away.  Another man smiled at her. She shook her head slowly.  Someone came in the front door, and she leaned forward. Then she slumped back limply.  She heard a tinkly laugh. She looked in its direction. She met Anne's eyes, bright and amused. Just then Miss Bestris came in, her eyes angry and her cheeks flushed. She strode across the room.  \"Well,\" she said. \"I'm glad to see you finally came down.\" She sank heavily into her chair. \"Cresent's back. They just brought her in. The idiots came right in here with her. I'll bet I lost half-a-dozen customers. These Earthmen are sensitive about such things.\"  Mary was still staring at the door; Miss Bestris looked down at her.  \"Well, what are you sitting here for?\"  \"Please, Miss Bestris. I'm waiting for my special boy friend tonight.\"  She snorted and looked away. \"Why isn't he here?\"  \"He will be.\"  \"He'd better. I'll let you wait another--half an hour. That's all.\"  \"Thank you, Miss Bestris. You're very kind to me.\"  \"I indulge you more than I ought to, child,\" she said. \"More than is good for you, if the truth were known.\"  A man came in; Mary stiffened and then relaxed.  The mutter of voices blended into a steady hum. More couples were dancing. Miss Bestris moved around the room. The music was tinny.  Another man came in.  \"Your time's up,\" the Madame told Mary.  \"Please, let me just wait for another few minutes.\"  Miss Bestris fixed her lips grimly. \"I've had enough nonsense for tonight. You heard me!\"  \"_Please!_\"  \"You heard what I said.\"  \"Miss Bestris, I couldn't. Not tonight. Honest, I couldn't. If I had to talk to anybody, I'd break down and cry. He'll ... come. I know he will.\"  Miss Bestris whirled on her. \"Listen, you little--\" But she stopped, suddenly. \"All right,\" she said, gritting her teeth. \"I can't afford another scene tonight. But you'll be sorry for this.\"  Miss Bestris stormily looked away. The dancers danced; the music swelled louder. Gradually, deliberately, the lights were waning.  \"Haven't I always been good to you, Mary?\" the Madame asked.  \"Yes.\"  \"Then like an obedient girl, do as I say. If he hasn't come by now, he just won't. He's gone to some other house.\"  \"No!\" Mary said doggedly.  \"Just remember, tomorrow, how you deliberately disobeyed me. Your silly emotions are costing me money, and that's one thing I simply won't stand for.\"  \"He'll come.\" Mary said. \"You won't lose money.\"  Couples sat side by side, laughing, talking in whispers. Occasionally there were giggles. The room began to empty slowly.  The lights continued to dim until the rooms were gloomy. Even the shifting shades of the color organ were no more than a faint ambience. Anne, laughing, helped her second mate to his feet.  \"I'll give you one more chance,\" Miss Bestris said. \"The next man that comes in....\"  \"No! I just couldn't! Not tonight!\"  A few more customers drifted in. Then even the stragglers stopped coming. It was very late.  \"He's deserted you; you see that now?\" Madame Bestris sneered.  Mary stood up. There were tears in her eyes. \"You can't--you don't--know--how I feel,\" she choked. \"You don't care!\" She turned and ran up the stairs, crying.  Several Earthmen, still in the big room, turned to watch. The torches were misty twinkles now. The last couples climbed the stairs and then Miss Bestris, too, went to bed.         *       *       *       *       *  The blue morning came. The town awoke; commerce began.  At seven, Miss Bestris lay in bed frowning, considering the events of the previous evening. But she was not so annoyed that she forgot to call a doctor on the teleview and arrange for him to come at nine to give a physical examination.  Her bulk out of bed, she dressed and went to the kitchen to brew a pot of hemp tea. The cleaning maid, moving about in the next room, heard Miss Bestris call sharply: \"Flavia! Come in here!\"  Flavia appeared with a dust rag in her hand.  \"Did you cut this cake?\"  \"No, ma'am.\"  Miss Bestris glowered. \"That little idiot! She must have slipped down here after we were all asleep and sat here and cried her silly little eyes out! If she thinks she can pull that love-sick act on me she'll soon find out different. Am I supposed to put up with having her moon over every space tramp that comes in? Why, I've taken more from her--!\"  \"Yes, ma'am.\"  Miss Bestris waddled to the stairs, climbed them determinedly. At Mary's door she stopped and twisted the knob. Locked!  Miss Bestris hammered. \"Open up, Mary!\" The door rattled under her hand. \"Open that door at once!\"  No answer.  Miss Bestris pounded harder. \"Open up, I say!\"  Anne sauntered into the hall, her dressing gown swishing. \"She really made you look the fool last night, didn't she?\" Anne said lazily.  \"You--you slut! Mind your own business.\"  Anne smiled and shrugged.  \"Open the door, Mary! Do you hear me! Open it!\"  \"Maybe she killed herself,\" Anne said. \"It has happened.\"  \"My God! No.... She wouldn't dare. You think she would?\"  Anne shrugged again. \"They do funny things sometimes.\"  Miss Bestris' face was red. \"Run down and get my keys. In my desk. You know where they are.\"  Then, \"_For God's sake, hurry!_\"  While she waited Miss Bestris rattled the door, pleading and cursing.  Finally Anne returned. Miss Bestris snatched the key with a shaking hand. She hurled the door open and burst inside.  \"See here, you little--!\" She stopped.  The room was empty.  On the neatly made bed reposed a little stack of money. When Miss Bestris got around to counting it, she found that it contained exactly nine hundred and ten _dordocs_.

Hemiptera (bugs) were found to the extent of 3.51 per cent of the total food. All were contained in three stomachs taken in March, June, and July. In the July stomach four cicadas, or dog-day flies, constituted the whole contents. Grasshoppers amount to less than 1 per cent and all other insects to but a trifle. Spiders were eaten to the extent of 2.94 per cent of the food and were found in the stomachs taken in seven of the twelve months, and judging from their distribution they are eaten whenever available. A hair snake (_Gordius_) was found in one stomach. Following is a list of insects identified and the number of stomachs in which found:     COLEOPTERA.    _Amara erratica_            1   _Aphodius_ sp               1   _Balaninus_ sp              1    HEMIPTERA.    _Platypedia putnami_        1   _Vegetable food._--The vegetable portion of the food of _Myadestes_ is 64.10 per cent of the whole, and 58.70 per cent of this, or more than half the whole food, is classified as wild fruit or berries. These were found in stomachs collected in every month. From the even distribution of this food through the year and from the quantity eaten it is evidently a favorite article of diet. Nothing was found in any of the stomachs that could be identified as cultivated fruit, with the possible exception of a mass of fruit pulp found in one. A few seeds of poison ivy and sumac, with fragments of flowers and a few weed seeds, complete the vegetable food. Following is a list of fruits, seeds, etc., identified, and the number of stomachs in which found:     Rocky Mountain cedar (_Juniperus scopulorum_)    3   Western cedar (_Juniperus monospermum_)          1   Other cedars (_Juniperus_ sp.)                   2   Hackberries (_Celtis occidentalis_)              1   Douglas hackberries (_Celtis douglasii_)         1   Service berries (_Amelanchier_ sp.)              1   Rose haws (_Rosa_ sp.)                           2   Wild cherries (_Prunus_ sp.)                     1   Sumac berries (_Rhus_ sp.)                       1   Poison ivy (_Rhus toxicodendron_)                1   Waxwork (_Celastrus_ sp.)                        1   Madrona berries (_Arbutus menziesii_)            5   Honeysuckle berries (_Lonicera_ sp.)             1   Elderberries (_Sambucus_ sp.)                    1   Fruit not further identified                     3   _Summary._--With so small an amount of material it is not safe to draw general conclusions, but in the case of _Myadestes_ one point seems clear--the bird's favorite food is small wild fruit, and as long as this is abundant the bird will probably not attack cultivated varieties; but should any portion of the region occupied by the solitaire be cleared of its wild fruit and cultivated species be introduced these would likely be preyed upon. Under such conditions this bird, now perfectly harmless, might inflict considerable damage.     WOOD THRUSH.  (_Hylocichla mustelina._)   The wood thrush is distributed over the eastern part of the United States wherever suitable conditions are found. It is a lover of open groves and bushy pastures, and may be found along little-traveled roads and near low bushy swamps. The bird is noted for its sweet song, and many country people who are well acquainted with its notes know little or nothing of the bird itself. Its favorite time for singing is in the early evening at the close of a sultry afternoon when a shower has cooled the air. As a rule, it does not nest in gardens or orchards and is seldom seen about farm buildings. It is strictly migratory, and the greater number pass out of the United States in winter, though a few remain in the Southern States. It usually migrates north in April or early May.  For the investigation of the food habits of the wood thrush 171 stomachs were available. One of these was collected in Florida in January and another in Alabama in February, and these two will be treated separately. The remaining 169 were collected from April to October, and are fairly well distributed over that time. The food consisted of 59.59 per cent of animal matter to 40.41 per cent of vegetable. The greatest quantity of animal food was eaten in April, the month of arrival from the south, and the least in October, the month of the return migration.  _Animal food._--Beetles, collectively (20.40 per cent), constitute the largest item of animal food. Of these, 2.23 per cent are the predacious ground beetles (Carabidæ), generally considered useful. The remainder belong to several more or less harmful families, of which the May-beetle family (Scarabæidæ) amount to 10.17 per cent. Snout beetles, or weevils (Rhynchophora), are eaten to the extent of 2.16 per cent only, and the wood-boring chick-beetles (Elateridæ) to 2.13 per cent.  Among the various species of these insects were noted the remains of the well-known Colorado potato beetle (_Leptinotarsa decemlineata_), in two stomachs, and _Coptocycla signifera_, also injurious to the potato, in one stomach. Remains of _Otiorhynchus ovatus_, a weevil destructive to strawberry plants, were found in two stomachs, and in one other a weevil, _Sphenophorus parvulus_, that injures the roots of grass. The well-known white grubs that attack grass roots and a host of other plants are the immature forms of many species of _Lachnosterna_, of several species of _Euphoria_ and of _Allorhina nitida_. Of these, remains of _Lachnosterna_ were found in 27 stomachs and of _Allorhina_ and _Euphoria_ in one each.     [Illustration:                                       B2084-73    Fig. 1.--Wood thrush (_Hylocichla mustelina_).]   Lepidoptera (caterpillars) stand next to Coleoptera (beetles) in the animal diet of the wood thrush. Although eaten with a fair degree of regularity during every month of the bird's stay in the north, the most were taken in July (16.32 per cent). The average for the season is 9.42 per cent. Ants as an item of food are third in importance, though if other Hymenoptera were included the order would rank next to beetles. They seem to be a rather favorite food with all birds of the genus _Hylocichla_. With the wood thrush they begin with 18.12 per cent in April and gradually decrease through the summer and disappear in October. The total for the season is 8.89 per cent. Hymenoptera other than ants were eaten with great regularity (3.86 per cent) throughout the season, but not in large quantities. Diptera (flies) are eaten in small quantities and rather irregularly. Most of them were the long-legged crane flies (Tipulidæ), both in the adult and larval form. The total for the season is 2.70 per cent. Hemiptera (bugs) do not appear to be a favorite food, though a few were taken in all of the seven months except October. The average for the season is only 1.33 per cent. Orthoptera (grasshoppers) are eaten in small quantities until July, after which they form a fair percentage till September. The total consumption amounts to 2.28 per cent of the food. A few other insects make up a fraction of 1 per cent. Spiders and myriapods (thousand-legs) appear to be a favorite food with the wood thrush, constituting in April 20.94 per cent of the food, but gradually decreasing in quantity until September. The aggregate for the year is 8.49 per cent. A few sowbugs (isopods), snails, and earthworms (1.83 per cent) close the account of animal food.  Following is a list of the insects identified in the stomachs of the wood thrush and the number of stomachs in which each was found:     HYMENOPTERA.    _Tiphia inornata_                 1    COLEOPTERA.    _Harpalus herbivagus_             1   _Necrophorus tomentosus_          1   _Philonthus lomatus_              1   _Hister abbreviatus_              1   _Hister depurator_                1   _Hister americanus_               2   _Ips quadriguttatus_              1   _Melanotus americanus_            1   _Corymbites cylindriformis_       1   _Agrilus bilineatus_              1   _Telephorus carolinus_            1   _Onthophagus striatulus_          1   _Onthophagus tuberculifrons_      1   _Onthophagus_ sp                  3   _Atænius_ sp                      2   _Aphodius granarius_              1   _Aphodius_ sp                     1   _Dichelonycha testacea_           1   _Dichelonycha_ sp                 1   _Lachnosterna_ sp                27   _Ligyrus_ sp                      1   _Allorhina nitida_                1   _Euphoria fulgida_                1   _Euphoria_ sp                     2   _Chrysomela pulchra_              1   _Leptinotarsa decemlineata_       2   _Odontota_ sp                     1   _Coptocycla signifera_            1   _Coptocycla_ sp                   1   _Anametus griseus_                1   _Phyxelis rigidus_                1   _Otiorhynchus ovatus_             2   _Tanymecus confertus_             1   _Pandeletejus hilaris_            1   _Barypithes pellucidus_           1   _Listronotus latiusculus_         1   _Macrops_ sp                      1   _Conotrachelus posticatus_        2   _Acalles carinatus_               1   _Balaninus_ sp                    2   _Eupsalis minuta_                 1   _Sphenophorus parvulus_           1    HEMIPTERA.    _Nezara hilaris_                  2    ORTHOPTERA.    _Diapheromera femorata_           1    ISOPTERA.    _Termes flavipes_                 1   _Vegetable food._--More than nine-tenths of the vegetable food of the wood thrush can be included in a single item--fruit. Cultivated fruit, or what was thought to be such, was found in stomachs taken from June to September, inclusive. It was eaten regularly and moderately, and the total for the season was 3.74 per cent of the whole food. Wild fruits or berries of 22 species were found in 72 stomachs, distributed through every month of the bird's stay at the north. Beginning with 1.18 per cent in April, the quantity gradually increases to 87.17 per cent in October, when it makes more than five-sixths of the"]]]
