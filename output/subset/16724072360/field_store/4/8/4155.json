Being influenced by considerations of geographic adjacency, we refer the animals on Mount Rainier to _Tamias amoenus ludibundus_ (Hollister).  Dalquest's (_op. cit._: 85) explanation of the probable origin of _Tamias amoenus caurinus_ is pertinent here. He writes: \"The chipmunks of the Olympic Mountains [_caurinus_] probably reached their present range from the Cascades. Their probable path of emigration was westward from Mt. Rainier, along the glacial outwash train of Nisqualli Glacier, to the moraine and outwash apron of the Vashon Glacier and thence to the Olympics. So similar are the chipmunks of Mt. Rainier and the Olympic Mountains that Howell (1929) included Mt. Rainier in the range of _caurinus_.\"   ~Tamias townsendii cooperi~ Baird  Some uncertainty exists concerning the subspecific identity of the Townsend Chipmunk in southern Washington because Dalquest (Univ. Kansas Publ. Mus. Nat. Hist., 2:262, April 9, 1948) identified as _Tamias townsendii cooperi_ specimens that he examined from Yocolt, a place well within the geographic range of _T. t. townsendii_ as defined by A. H. Howell (N. Amer. Fauna, 52: fig. 7, p. 107, November 30, 1929). Dalquest (_op. cit._) referred other specimens, that he did not examine, from Mt. St. Helens (90654, 231112 and 231114 BS) to _T. t. cooperi_ although Howell (N. Amer. Fauna, 52:109, November 20, 1929) had previously identified them as _E. t. townsendii_. By implication, and on his map, Dalquest (_op. cit._, fig. 83, p. 261) assigned to _T. t. cooperi_ still other specimens, that he had not examined, from: Government Springs, 15 mi. N Carson (230514, 230515, 230559, 230560, and 230563 BS); Stevenson (230513 and 230517 BS); and Skamania (230518 BS). Earlier, Howell (op. cit.) had listed the specimens from the three mentioned localities as _Eutamias townsendii townsendii_.  Our examination of specimens in the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology from 1-1/2 mi. W Yocolt (94238 and 94239 MVZ) and from 3-1/2 mi. E and 5 mi. N Yocolt (94240-94244 MVZ) reveals that the \"average\" of the coloration is nearer to that of the paler _T. t. cooperi_ than to that of the darker _T. t. townsendii_ and indicates why Dalquest, we think correctly, identified specimens from Yocolt as _T. t. cooperi_. We have examined also the specimens in the Biological Surveys Collection of the United States National Museum (catalogue numbers given above) and have compared them with specimens (comparable in age and seasonal condition of pelage) of _T. t. townsendii_ (notably a series from Lake Quinalt, Washington) and of _T. t. cooperi_ (including specimens from Bumping Lake and Blewett Pass, Washington). In color, the specimens from Mt. St. Helens are almost exactly intermediate between _T. t. cooperi_ and _T. t. townsendii_. We choose to use for them the name _T. t. townsendii_ as did Howell (_op. cit._:109). The specimens from 15 mi. N Carson, those from Stevenson and the one from Skamania agree in nearly all features of color with the relatively paler _T. t. cooperi_, as Dalquest (_op. cit._) thought they would, and we, accordingly, use for them the name _Tamias townsendii cooperi_.  In view of the findings resulting from our study of the above mentioned specimens of the Townsend Chipmunk in Washington, it seemed worthwhile to examine the material of the same species from Hood River, Oregon. Howell (_op. cit._:109) listed one specimen from there as _E. t. townsendii_, but (_op. cit.:_ fig. 7, p. 107) mapped the locality as within the geographic range of _E. t. cooperi_. The specimen (89061 BS) is a juvenile having external measurements of only 175, 80 and 31. Although the color is intermediate between that of the two subspecies concerned, greater resemblance is shown to _T. t. townsendii_. We have not examined any other specimen of the species _Tamias townsendii_ so young as No. 89061, but suspect that older specimens from the same place would be paler by a slight degree. This suspicion, and more especially the light color of an older specimen from nearby White Salmon, Washington, and the light color of two older specimens from Parkdale, Oregon, which seem to us to be referable to _T. t. cooperi_, influence us to refer the specimen from Hood River to _Tamias townsendii cooperi_ Baird.   ~Tamias townsendii townsendii~ Bachman  A. H. Howell (N. Amer. Fauna, 52:111, November 30, 1929) referred specimens of the Townsend Chipmunk from the lower elevations on the Olympic Peninsula to _Eutamias townsendii townsendii_ but referred specimens from the central mountains on that peninsula to _Eutamias townsendii cooperi_. The subspecies _T. t. cooperi_ thus is represented as having a geographic range of two separate parts: (1) The Cascade Mountains from southern British Columbia into southern Oregon, and (2) the area of the Olympic Mountains, the latter area being entirely surrounded by the geographic range of _T. t. townsendii_. Dalquest (Univ. Kansas Publ. Mus. Nat. Hist., 2:261 and 262, April 9, 1948) employed Howell's arrangement.  We have examined the specimens, in the Biological Surveys Collection of the United States National Museum, from the Olympic Peninsula and fail to find significant differences in external measurements or in size or shape of skulls between specimens from the mountains (alleged _T. t. cooperi_) and those from other parts of the Peninsula (assigned to _T. t. townsendii_). Nevertheless, the specimens from the higher parts of the Olympic Mountains resemble _T. t. cooperi_ in being less ochraceous than are specimens of _T. t. townsendii_ from elsewhere on the Olympic Peninsula, and in this one respect, in series, they more closely resemble _T. t. cooperi_. Even so, the upper parts of the specimens from the mountains are darker than in _T. t. cooperi_ of the Cascades. In dark color of the superciliary stripe the specimens in question are referable to _T. t. townsendii_. The over-all gray tone, resembling that of _T. t. cooperi_, upon close inspection is found to be in considerable degree the result of wear, and the difference in grayness from _T. t. townsendii_, when specimens in comparable pelage are compared, is slight. This tendency to lighter color in specimens from higher elevations is seen in other places in Washington within the geographic range of _Tamias townsendii_. We feel, therefore, that the mentioned resemblance in color between specimens from the Olympic Mountains and those of _T. t. cooperi_ from the Cascade Mountains is not significant taxonomically. To us, all of the animals of the species _Tamias townsendii_ from the Olympic Peninsula seem best referred to the subspecies _Tamias townsendii townsendii_ Bachman.   ~Tamias striatus ohionensis~ Bole and Moulthrop  A. H. Howell (Jour. Mamm., 13:166, May 14, 1932) referred a specimen (252979 USNM) from Athens, Ohio, to _Tamias striatus fisheri_. Subsequently, Bole and Moulthrop (Sci. Publs. Cleveland Mus. Nat. Hist., 5:83-181, September 11, 1942) named _Tamias striatus ohionensis_ and _Tamias striatus rufescens_, both of which occur in Ohio. They (_op. cit._: 137) also excluded _T. s. fisheri_ from the state list of mammals of Ohio. The locality of Athens lies between the ranges of _T. s. ohionensis_ and _T. s. rufescens_, as outlined by referred specimens, and thus the identity of the specimen from that place was left in doubt. We have examined the specimen and among named kinds find that it most closely resembles _T. s. ohionensis_ in its less widely spreading zygomata, slender incisors and dull-colored pelage. We prefer the specimen to _T. s. ohionensis_.  The subspecific identity of specimen No. 174762 USNM, a skin only, from Nobleville, Hamilton Co., Indiana, assigned by Howell (N. Amer. Fauna, 52:21, November 30, 1929) to _T. s. griseus_ and by Lyon (Amer. Mid. Nat., 17(1):191, January, 1936) to _T. s. fisheri_, was left in doubt by Bole and Moulthrop's (_op. cit._) assignment of specimens to _T. s. ohionensis_. Although the specimen lacks a skull and tail, on the basis of its dull-colored pelage and dark brown (anteriorly) median dorsal stripe, we identify No. 174762 as _T. s. ohionensis_. For the same reason, specimen No. 125445 USNM, from Bascom, Indiana, referred by Howell (_op. cit._:16) to _T. s. striatus_, and by Lyon (_op. cit._:191) to _T. s. fisheri_, required re-examination. The specimen appears to be an intergrade between _T. s. striatus_ and _T. s. ohionensis_; it is probably best referred to the latter subspecies which it resembles in having short nasals. In color it is intermediate, but it does not possess the narrowly spreading zygomata of _T. s. ohionensis_ and, in this respect, more nearly approaches _T. s. striatus_.  Specimen No. 13815 USNM, an alcoholic, from Wheatland, Knox Co., Indiana, was assigned by Howell (_op. cit._, 1929:21) to _T. s. griseus_ and by Lyon (_loc. cit._) to _T. s. fisheri_. Although the specimen is much faded and cannot be identified with certainty, we assign it to _T. s. ohionensis_. Allowing for fading, it seems to resemble _ohionensis_ more in the lighter color of the anterior part of the median dorsal stripe, than it does either _griseus_ or _fisheri_. We are also influenced in making this allocation by Bole and Moulthrop's (_op. cit._:137) finding intergradation between _T. s. ohionensis_ and _T. s. striatus_ in a specimen obtained at New Harmony, Posey Co., Indiana.  Howell (Jour. Mamm., 13:166, August 9, 1932) referred two specimens from Boone County, Indiana, to _T. s. fisheri_. We have examined a specimen (5675 AMNH) from that place and think it is one of the two seen by Howell. The specimen is a poorly made skin in worn winter pelage with the skull inside. Because it differs from _T. s. fisheri_ and agrees with _T. s. ohionensis_ in the color of both upper parts and underparts (comparisons made with material of comparable stage of molt), we assign it to the latter subspecies. Howell (_loc. cit._) referred specimens from Overton (57394), Wooster (57398"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33578"],["title","Comments on the Taxonomy and Geographic Distribution of Some North American (#2)"],["body",", 57399, and 57442), and Loudonville (57391-57393), all from Ohio, in the Museum of Zoology of the University of Michigan, to _Tamias striatus fisheri_. We have examined these specimens and find them to be readily separable from _T. s. rufescens_ on the basis of darker coloration. The affinities of the specimens in question are with _T. s. fisheri_ and _T. s. ohionensis_. As a standard for comparison we have used specimens in the Museum of Zoology, University of Michigan, in comparable pelage of _T. s. ohionensis_ from Dearborn County, Indiana, taken in August and specimens of _T. s. fisheri_ from \"near\" summit Butt Mtn. and Little Meadows, both places in Giles County, Virginia, as well as two specimens from Allair, Monmouth County, New Jersey. On the basis of buffy (instead of white) edging of the tail, buffy (not white) light dorsal stripes, and buffy (not black) anterior third of the median dark stripe, the specimens from Overton, Wooster, and Loudonville are referred to _Tamias striatus ohionensis_.   ~Tamias striatus pipilans~ Lowery  A. H. Howell (N. Amer. Fauna, 29:16, November 30, 1929) recorded six specimens of _Tamias striatus striatus_ from Greensboro, Alabama. Subsequently, Lowery (Occas. Papers Mus. Zool., Louisiana State Univ., 13:235, November 22, 1943) named _T. s. pipilans_ and assigned to it specimens from northeastern Alabama. Lowery did not, however, mention the specimens from Greensboro and, thus, their subspecific identity was placed in doubt. We have examined five of the six specimens mentioned by Howell (_loc. cit._) (57034-57036, 57588, and 77037 BS) and because of their brilliant color and large size, refer them to _Tamias striatus pipilans_ Lowery.   ~Tamias striatus rufescens~ Bole and Moulthrop  A. H. Howell (Jour. Mamm., 13:166, August 9, 1932) also referred a specimen (13154), from La Porte, Indiana, in the Chicago Nat. History Museum to _T. s. fisheri_. We find the specimen to be distinguishable from _T. s. fisheri_ in darker, richer pelage, brown instead of blackish anterior third of the median dorsal stripe, more buffy light dorsal stripes, and more heavily constructed skull. The specimen most closely resembles _T. s. rufescens_ in having, as compared to _T. s. ohionensis_, brighter, more rufescent color, wider incisors, proportionately narrower interorbital region, and more widely spreading zygomatic arches. We refer it to that subspecies.   ~Sciurus carolinensis pennsylvanicus~ Ord  When J. A. Allen considered what name to apply to the gray squirrel of northeastern United States and adjacent parts of Canada, (Monogr. N. Amer. Rodentia, p. 709, 1877) he selected the name _leucotis_ of Gapper (Zool. Jour., 5:206, 1830) as applicable. Allen rejected Ord's (Guthrie's Geog., 2nd Amer. Ed., Zool. App., 2:292, 1815) earlier name, _Sciurus Pennsylvanica_, because (_loc. cit._) \"it was given to specimens from the Middle Atlantic States, and hence from a locality bordering upon the habitat of the southern form, and consequently the name is not strictly applicable to the northern type as developed in the Northern and Northeastern States and the Canadas.\" It must be recalled that Allen had not at that time seen a copy of Ord's exceedingly rare work and was basing his comments on Baird's statements on Ord's treatment of the squirrels.  Subsequently, Rhoads obtained a copy of the second edition of Guthrie's Geography and had Ord's zoological appendix thereto reprinted. The reprinted version (now known generally as Ord's Zoology by Rhoads, 1894) contains (Appendix, p. 19) Rhoads' review of the _pennsylvanicus vs. leucotis_ controversy. Rhoads concluded that _pennsylvanicus_ must apply because it has priority and is available. The habitat was given by Ord as \"those parts of Pennsylvania which lie to the westward of the Allegany ridge,\" not the \"Middle Atlantic States\" as Allen thought.  Notwithstanding Rhoads' comments, Bangs (Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington, 10:156, December 28, 1896), in his \"Review of the Squirrels of Eastern North America,\" employed _leucotis_ Gapper and rejected Ord's name because it \"is a _nomen nudum_\" and of uncertain application. There seems to have been no attempt subsequently to review the pertinent names.  We are of the opinion that Rhoads' (_loc. cit._) analysis and conclusions are correct and as cogent today as then. We do not agree with Bangs that _pennsylvanicus_ is a _nomen nudum_ for the following reasons. The name was based on melanistic individuals and could conceivably be applied to three species of squirrels, the red squirrel, the fox squirrel, and the gray squirrel. Melanistic red squirrels, _Tamiasciurus hudsonicus_, are everywhere rare and in any case appear as individuals and not populations. Ord (_loc. cit._) reported that his _Sciurus Pennsylvanica_ was _abundant_. Ord, we think, was not referring to the fox squirrel, _Sciurus niger_, because he wrote that _S. Pennsylvania_ \"has always been confounded with... [_Sciurus niger_], but it is a different species,\" and (_loc. cit._) described _S. niger_ as a \"Large Black Squirrel\" and _Sciurus Pennsylvanica_ as a \"Small Black Squirrel.\" Therefore, _pennsylvanicus_ Ord can refer only to _Sciurus carolinensis_. Further, melanistic gray squirrels then, as now, were common in western Pennsylvania and exceedingly rare in eastern Pennsylvania. Additionally, Ord described his animal, although admittedly inadequately (small, black, not _S. niger_). The name _Sciurus Pennsylvanica_ Ord is clearly not a _nomen nudum_ and must replace _leucotis_ Gapper.  Allen's (_loc. cit._) argument that the specimens were not representative of \"_leucotis_\" because they were from the Middle Atlantic States is based on an initial misunderstanding of the locality. Further, whether or not \"topotypes\" are representative of a subspecies has no bearing on the availability of the name appended to them. The name and synonomy of the northern gray squirrel are as follows:       ~Sciurus carolinensis pennsylvanicus~ Ord       1815. _Sciurus Pennsylvanica_ Ord, Guthrie's Geog., 2nd      Amer. Ed., 2:292.

Rodentia, Sciuridae, p. 700 (_et auct._).   ~Sciurus niger rufiventer~ Geoffroy  Two specimens (36192/48550, a young male with unworn teeth, and 36193/48551, an adult male with much worn teeth, both in the United States Biological Surveys Collection in the National Museum) were recorded by Bailey (N. Amer. Fauna, 25:75, 1905) as _Sciurus ludovicianus_ from Gainesville, Texas. Bailey (_loc. cit._) further stated that if the name _Sciurus rufiventer_ Geoffroy proved usable it would apply to the specimens from Gainesville. Since the name _rufiventer_ was revived there would be no question concerning the identity of these specimens had not Lowery and Davis (Occas. Papers, Mus. Zool., Louisiana State Univ., 9:172, 1942) assigned three specimens (not seen by us) to _Sciurus niger limitis_ Baird from a point only thirteen miles northwesterly. Lowery and Davis (_loc. cit._) say that their specimens are intergrades (presumably with _rufiventer_) and Bailey (_loc. cit._) noted that his two specimens from Gainesville \"are in size and color nearer to _ludovicianus_ [= _rufiventer_] than to typical _limitis_.\" Examination of the two specimens from Gainesville convinces us that Bailey was correct and the specimens therefore are referable to _Sciurus niger rufiventer_. More in detail, the color agrees with that of _rufiventer_ and differs from that of _limitis_ and from that of darker specimens of _Sciurus niger ludovicianus_ (in the restricted sense used by Lowery and Davis, _op. cit._: 104). Also the size is larger than in _limitis_ and as in _rufiventer_ or _ludovicianus_. Selected measurements of Nos. 36192/48550 and 36193/48551 are, respectively, as follows: Total length, 505, 500; length of tail, 237, 228; length of hind foot, 72, 70; basilar length of Hensel, 48.5, 48.6; zygomatic breadth, 35.1, 36.0; length of nasals, 21.4, 22.3; alveolar length of maxillary tooth-row, 11.8, 11.1; width across posterior tongues of premaxillae, 17.5, 18.4.   ~Sciurus variegatoides rigidus~ Peters  Harris (Occas. Papers Mus. Zool., Univ. Michigan, 266:1, June 28, 1933) named _Sciurus variegatoides austini_ with type locality at Las Agujas, Province of Puntarenas, Costa Rica. Later, in his revision of the species _Sciurus variegatoides_, he (Misc. Publs. Mus. Zool., Univ. Michigan, 38:19, September 7, 1937) referred specimens from Chomes, Costa Rica, to _S. v. austini_ and (_op. cit._:24) specimens from Puntarenas, Province of Puntarenas, to _S. v. rigidus_, an inland subspecies. The geographic arrangement of these referred specimens seemed to warrant a reconsideration of the material. We have examined specimens of _S. variegatoides_ in the Museum of Zoology, University of Michigan, from the following localities in Costa Rica: Puntarenas (62703-62706), Las Agujas (65118 [type of _S. v. austini_], 59847-59850), Río Las Agujas (65114-65117), Agua Caliente (66483), Zarcéro (75757-75761, 75765), Cartago (67546, 67547), and Esparta (75762-75764). The specimens listed by Harris (_op. cit._, 1937:19) as from Chomes, in the Museum of Zoology of the University of Michigan, are not now in that museum and we have not seen them.  Harris (_op. cit._:19) characterized _S. v. austini_ as differing from _S. v. rigidus_ in having brightly rufous legs (Ochraceou"]]]
