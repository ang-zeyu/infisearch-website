I can see now that it was a mistake to let you see me in the first place. I understand now why it is strictly forbidden.\"  Reggie drained his drink.  \"I wish you hadn't decided to break regulations,\" he said moodily. \"I've never been so upset in all my life. Why didn't you remain invisible, if you're supposed to? You aren't going to creep into people's hearts if you pop up and announce yourself as an agent of Death and start making speeches about whisking them off to the Land of Darkness. People just don't like that sort of thing. By all means stay invisible in the future.\"  Mr. Demise shuffled awkwardly and for the first time his poise seemed deserting him.  \"You're absolutely right,\" he said gloomily. \"But I was curious.\"  \"That's a fine excuse,\" Reggie said scathingly. \"I should think they'd get a man of tact and diplomacy for your job. Not some nosy person whose curiosity runs away with him.\"  \"You see,\" Mr. Demise explained miserably, \"you happened to be my first assignment. I've had no experience at all in this work and I was curious to see what kind of person I was going to take back with me. And I wanted to get a first-hand reaction from you.\"  Reggie mixed himself another drink. He was beginning to feel belligerent.  \"So?\" he cried. \"They sent an amateur down to get me, did they? I suppose I don't rate an experienced escort. So they sent you. I'm surprised they didn't just tell the office boy to do the job.\"  \"Your levity is poor taste,\" Mr. Demise observed frigidly. \"I can assure you that I am perfectly qualified to act as your guide to the Other World. I have studied hard to perfect myself for my work and I was considered one of the outstanding pupils in the class which just graduated. You do not have to relieve your spite by making slighting references to my professional ability.\"  \"Bah!\" Reggie said. \"If you have any professional ability it hasn't been noticeable so far. You're just out of some college, aren't you? You talk like a college boy. You don't make sense.\"  Mr. Demise looked hurt.  \"I'm sorry you're taking this attitude,\" he said. \"I had hoped we could be friends.\"  \"Friends!\" Reggie shrieked. \"Am I expected to be friendly with some ghoul who comes prowling around threatening to whisk me off to Eternity? What more do they expect of me? To pay my own way too, I suppose.\"  \"Your passage will be taken care of at the other end,\" Mr. Demise said. \"Since you have taken such an ungracious stand we will not dally further.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"Now wait a minute,\" Reggie said. He felt his throat getting dry. The prospects of Death were not pleasant. He didn't want to die right now. He had things to do. There was that badminton match next week with Snuffy Smith....  \"Can't we put this thing off a while?\" he asked hopefully. \"There's no sense in rushing things, I always say. Why don't you go off and get yourself a lot of experience and then come back for me?\"  \"That is impossible,\" Mr. Demise said flatly. He drew from his inside coat pocket a slim black book which he opened to the first page. \"You are first on my list and I must carry out my orders to the letter. All the information as to person, place and method is contained in this book and it would be impossible to change it.\"  \"Place and method, eh?\" Reggie said weakly. He ran a finger around the inside of his collar. \"You mean you've got the dope there on how it's going to happen and when it's going to happen?\"  \"Certainly,\" Mr. Demise replied. \"We don't use a hit-or-miss method. Everything is worked out to a science. You, for instance, are--\" Mr. Demise paused and shook his head. \"No,\" he continued, \"I can't tell you. That is also against instructions.\"  \"You haven't paid much attention to instructions so far,\" Reggie said sulkily. \"Can't you give me a hint as to how I'm going to get it?\"  Mr. Demise shook his head firmly.  \"That would be an unthinkable breach of conduct,\" he said, shaking his head severely and frowning. \"Absolutely unthinkable.\"  \"All right,\" Reggie said resignedly. There was no point, he realized, in arguing with this inhuman icicle. \"But let's have a drink before we get down to--er--business.\"  \"I am not allowed to drink while on duty,\" Mr. Demise said primly.  \"For gosh sakes,\" Reggie said disgustedly, \"you weren't thinking about your precious orders and regulations when you followed me around, scaring the hell out of me. Oh no! That was all right. But when I ask you to do a little something outside the letter of your instructions it's no soap. If there's anything fair in that I can't see it.\"  Mr. Demise shuffled uncomfortably.  \"It was indiscreet of me to allow you to see me,\" he said thoughtfully. \"Perhaps your objection is justifiable. It might square things a bit if I would take a drink with you. Not that I would expect to enjoy the stuff but it seems the fair thing to do.\"  \"Fine,\" Reggie said.  He mixed two drinks in somber silence. Because he realized that it was probably the last time he would ever perform that pleasant chore, he put his heart and soul into the task and when he finally handed Mr. Demise his drink it was a veritable masterpiece.  Mr. Demise drank the drink--it was a double Martini with a splash of Quantro--in one long appreciative gulp. He set the glass down and sighed contentedly.  \"Another?\" Reggie suggested hopefully.  \"No,\" Mr. Demise said, \"one is plenty. As a matter of fact,\" he said, \"that's the first drink I ever had. Alcohol is one of our finest helpers but we aren't supposed to touch it. Personally I think its intoxicating effect is greatly overrated.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Reggie leaned forward and there was a peculiar gleam in his eyes.  \"So that was your first drink, eh?\" he asked. \"And you don't feel anything?\"  \"Not a thing,\" said Mr. Demise. \"Of course I notice a certain glow, but that's all.\"  \"Just a certain glow, eh?\" Reggie said.  \"Thash all,\" Mr. Demise said. He sat down suddenly. \"And my tongue ish a lil' thick.\"  \"Well, that's only natural,\" Reggie said. He mixed another drink and there was a cryptic smile on his lips. \"Alcohol is a peculiar thing. One drink will addle a person's wits and the second will act as an antidote. Strange, isn't it?\"  Mr. Demise rocked slightly in the chair. His coal-black eyes were a bit glazed. \"Ish very strange,\" he conceded.  \"Possibly you'd like to try the antidote?\" Reggie said casually.  \"Might not be a bad idea,\" said Mr. Demise.  Reggie handed him the second drink and watched contentedly as Mr. Demise drank it down. Mr. Demise set down the glass.  \"You wush right,\" he said, slumping against the back of the chair. \"Absolutely right. Second drink ish an antidote. Jush what I needed.\"  \"Absolutely,\" Reggie agreed solemnly.  Mr. Demise closed his eyes but he opened them almost immediately. He struggled up to a sitting position.  \"I hash something to do,\" he muttered. His hand groped into the inside of his coat, returned with the slim black book. \"Very important,\" he mumbled. \"First assignment. Can't have any slip ups.\"  Reggie moistened his lips nervously. He eyed the little black book carefully. That might be the way....  \"How about another drink, old boy,\" he said heartily. He mixed one quickly, handed it to Mr. Demise. Mr. Demise took it in his left hand and Reggie deftly plucked the black book from his right hand. Mr. Demise appeared not to notice the exchange. He drank the drink methodically.  Reggie tossed the book under a coffee table.  Mr. Demise climbed unsteadily to his feet.  Reggie took him by the arm. \"What say we go out and have a few quick antidotes?\" he suggested.  Mr. Demise nodded stupidly. He mumbled something unintelligible and allowed Reggie to lead him to the door. Reggie's brain was working at full speed. If he could just ditch Mr. Demise and get back to the book everything might be saved. His idea was sheer brilliance....         *       *       *       *       *  Their first destination was a bar. Reggie found a cab, shoved Mr. Demise inside and ordered the driver to one of the dozens of friendly bars with which he was familiar.  At the first stop Mr. Demise had two more drinks. When he had drained the second Reggie hauled him to his feet and started for another palate palace. His object was to keep Mr. Demise so bewildered and drunk that he would forget his job.  For a while he succeeded. Mr. Demise followed him helplessly from bar to bar and sat tottering on high stools happily pouring fiery intoxicants into his already overburdened stomach.  But finally he reached the state of saturation where the liquor produced a steadily diminishing effect. Reggie watched him worriedly and ordered more and more drinks.  But it was no use.  In spite of the enormous quantities of liquor he had consumed, Mr. Demise was slowly sobering up. His face was losing its blank expression and an intelligent gleam was creeping back into his eyes.  He began to fumble uncertainly through his pockets, a worried expression settling over his features.  Reggie slapped him on the back resoundingly.  \"Have a drink!\" he shouted into his ear.  Mr. Demise shook his head stubbornly.  \"Got a job to do,\" he muttered. He went slowly through his pockets and an expression of horror replaced the worried look on his face.  \"Where's my book?\" he gasped. \"I've lost my book! This is terrible. I've got to find it!\"  \"What book?\" Reggie asked innocently.  \"The book with all the names and places and dates and methods,\" Mr. Demise moaned. \"I've lost it.\"  Reggie shrugged philosophically.  \"Too bad,\" he said. \"But things are never as black as they seem. Maybe it'll turn up somewhere. The thing to do is just sit tight until someone finds it and reports it.\"  \"I can't wait,\" wailed Mr. Demise. \"These things have to happen on schedule. There'd be an awful rumpus in the complaint department if I started"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3289"],["title","The Valley of Fear (#1)"],["body","atson, it is a very common book.”  “What you say certainly sounds plausible.”  “So we have contracted our field of search to a large book, printed in double columns and in common use.”  “The Bible!” I cried triumphantly.  “Good, Watson, good! But not, if I may say so, quite good enough! Even if I accepted the compliment for myself I could hardly name any volume which would be less likely to lie at the elbow of one of Moriarty's associates. Besides, the editions of Holy Writ are so numerous that he could hardly suppose that two copies would have the same pagination. This is clearly a book which is standardized. He knows for certain that his page 534 will exactly agree with my page 534.”  “But very few books would correspond with that.”  “Exactly. Therein lies our salvation. Our search is narrowed down to standardized books which anyone may be supposed to possess.”  “Bradshaw!”  “There are difficulties, Watson. The vocabulary of Bradshaw is nervous and terse, but limited. The selection of words would hardly lend itself to the sending of general messages. We will eliminate Bradshaw. The dictionary is, I fear, inadmissible for the same reason. What then is left?”  “An almanac!”  “Excellent, Watson! I am very much mistaken if you have not touched the spot. An almanac! Let us consider the claims of Whitaker's Almanac. It is in common use. It has the requisite number of pages. It is in double column. Though reserved in its earlier vocabulary, it becomes, if I remember right, quite garrulous towards the end.” He picked the volume from his desk. “Here is page 534, column two, a substantial block of print dealing, I perceive, with the trade and resources of British India. Jot down the words, Watson! Number thirteen is 'Mahratta.' Not, I fear, a very auspicious beginning. Number one hundred and twenty-seven is 'Government'; which at least makes sense, though somewhat irrelevant to ourselves and Professor Moriarty. Now let us try again. What does the Mahratta government do? Alas! the next word is 'pig's-bristles.' We are undone, my good Watson! It is finished!”  He had spoken in jesting vein, but the twitching of his bushy eyebrows bespoke his disappointment and irritation. I sat helpless and unhappy, staring into the fire. A long silence was broken by a sudden exclamation from Holmes, who dashed at a cupboard, from which he emerged with a second yellow-covered volume in his hand.  “We pay the price, Watson, for being too up-to-date!” he cried. “We are before our time, and suffer the usual penalties. Being the seventh of January, we have very properly laid in the new almanac. It is more than likely that Porlock took his message from the old one. No doubt he would have told us so had his letter of explanation been written. Now let us see what page 534 has in store for us. Number thirteen is 'There,' which is much more promising. Number one hundred and twenty-seven is 'is'--'There is' “--Holmes's eyes were gleaming with excitement, and his thin, nervous fingers twitched as he counted the words--“'danger.' Ha! Ha! Capital! Put that down, Watson. 'There is danger--may--come--very soon--one.' Then we have the name 'Douglas'--'rich--country--now--at Birlstone--House--Birlstone--confidence--is--pressing.' There, Watson! What do you think of pure reason and its fruit? If the green-grocer had such a thing as a laurel wreath, I should send Billy round for it.”  I was staring at the strange message which I had scrawled, as he deciphered it, upon a sheet of foolscap on my knee.  “What a queer, scrambling way of expressing his meaning!” said I.  “On the contrary, he has done quite remarkably well,” said Holmes. “When you search a single column for words with which to express your meaning, you can hardly expect to get everything you want. You are bound to leave something to the intelligence of your correspondent. The purport is perfectly clear. Some deviltry is intended against one Douglas, whoever he may be, residing as stated, a rich country gentleman. He is sure--'confidence' was as near as he could get to 'confident'--that it is pressing. There is our result--and a very workmanlike little bit of analysis it was!”  Holmes had the impersonal joy of the true artist in his better work, even as he mourned darkly when it fell below the high level to which he aspired. He was still chuckling over his success when Billy swung open the door and Inspector MacDonald of Scotland Yard was ushered into the room.  Those were the early days at the end of the '80's, when Alec MacDonald was far from having attained the national fame which he has now achieved. He was a young but trusted member of the detective force, who had distinguished himself in several cases which had been intrusted to him. His tall, bony figure gave promise of exceptional physical strength, while his great cranium and deep-set, lustrous eyes spoke no less clearly of the keen intelligence which twinkled out from behind his bushy eyebrows. He was a silent, precise man with a dour nature and a hard Aberdonian accent.  Twice already in his career had Holmes helped him to attain success, his own sole reward being the intellectual joy of the problem. For this reason the affection and respect of the Scotchman for his amateur colleague were profound, and he showed them by the frankness with which he consulted Holmes in every difficulty. Mediocrity knows nothing higher than itself; but talent instantly recognizes genius, and MacDonald had talent enough for his profession to enable him to perceive that there was no humiliation in seeking the assistance of one who already stood alone in Europe, both in his gifts and in his experience. Holmes was not prone to friendship, but he was tolerant of the big Scotchman, and smiled at the sight of him.  “You are an early bird, Mr. Mac,” said he. “I wish you luck with your worm. I fear this means that there is some mischief afoot.”  “If you said 'hope' instead of 'fear,' it would be nearer the truth, I'm thinking, Mr. Holmes,” the inspector answered, with a knowing grin. “Well, maybe a wee nip would keep out the raw morning chill. No, I won't smoke, I thank you. I'll have to be pushing on my way; for the early hours of a case are the precious ones, as no man knows better than your own self. But--but--”  The inspector had stopped suddenly, and was staring with a look of absolute amazement at a paper upon the table. It was the sheet upon which I had scrawled the enigmatic message.  “Douglas!” he stammered. “Birlstone! What's this, Mr. Holmes? Man, it's witchcraft! Where in the name of all that is wonderful did you get those names?”  “It is a cipher that Dr. Watson and I have had occasion to solve. But why--what's amiss with the names?”  The inspector looked from one to the other of us in dazed astonishment. “Just this,” said he, “that Mr. Douglas of Birlstone Manor House was horribly murdered last night!”     Chapter 2--Sherlock Holmes Discourses    It was one of those dramatic moments for which my friend existed. It would be an overstatement to say that he was shocked or even excited by the amazing announcement. Without having a tinge of cruelty in his singular composition, he was undoubtedly callous from long overstimulation. Yet, if his emotions were dulled, his intellectual perceptions were exceedingly active. There was no trace then of the horror which I had myself felt at this curt declaration; but his face showed rather the quiet and interested composure of the chemist who sees the crystals falling into position from his oversaturated solution.  “Remarkable!” said he. “Remarkable!”  “You don't seem surprised.”  “Interested, Mr. Mac, but hardly surprised. Why should I be surprised? I receive an anonymous communication from a quarter which I know to be important, warning me that danger threatens a certain person. Within an hour I learn that this danger has actually materialized and that the person is dead. I am interested; but, as you observe, I am not surprised.”  In a few short sentences he explained to the inspector the facts about the letter and the cipher. MacDonald sat with his chin on his hands and his great sandy eyebrows bunched into a yellow tangle.  “I was going down to Birlstone this morning,” said he. “I had come to ask you if you cared to come with me--you and your friend here. But from what you say we might perhaps be doing better work in London.”  “I rather think not,” said Holmes.  “Hang it all, Mr. Holmes!” cried the inspector. “The papers will be full of the Birlstone mystery in a day or two; but where's the mystery if there is a man in London who prophesied the crime before ever it occurred? We have only to lay our hands on that man, and the rest will follow.”  “No doubt, Mr. Mac. But how do you propose to lay your hands on the so-called Porlock?”  MacDonald turned over the letter which Holmes had handed him. “Posted in Camberwell--that doesn't help us much. Name, you say, is assumed. Not much to go on, certainly. Didn't you say that you have sent him money?”  “Twice.”  “And how?”  “In notes to Camberwell post office.”  “Did you ever trouble to see who called for them?”  “No.”  The inspector looked surprised and a little shocked. “Why not?”  “Because I always keep faith. I had promised when he first wrote that I would not try to trace him.”  “You think there is someone behind him?”  “I know there is.”  “This professor that I've heard you mention?”  “Exactly!”  Inspector MacDonald smiled, and his eyelid quivered as he glanced towards me. “I won't conceal from you, Mr. Holmes, that we think in the C.I.D. that you have a wee bit of a bee in your bonnet over this professor. I made some inquiries myself about the matter. He seems to be a very respectable, learned, and talented sort of man.”  “I'm glad you've got so far as to recognize the talent.”  “Man, you can't but recognize it! After I heard your view I made it my business to see him. I had a chat with him on eclipses. How the talk got that way I canna think; but he had out a"]]]
