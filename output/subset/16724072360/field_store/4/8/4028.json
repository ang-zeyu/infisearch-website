If I come back within the five years, you are merely to give the money over to me. Is that clear?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"I'll want it in writing, of course.\"  \"Of course. A plastic surgeon is due here in about ten minutes, Mr. Smith, and we can get on with.... But if I don't know your name, how can I put it in writing?\"  Smith smiled. \"I changed my name to Smith for the occasion. Perfectly legal. My name is John X. Smith--now.\"  \"That's where you're wrong,\" said Mr. Arkalion as the plastic surgeon entered. \"Your name is Alaric Arkalion III--_now_.\"  The plastic surgeon skittered around Smith, examining him minutely with the casual expertness that comes with experience.  \"Have to shorten the cheek bones.\"  \"For ten million dollars,\" said Smith, \"you can take the damned things out altogether and hang them on your wall.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Sophia Androvna Petrovitch made her way downtown through the bustle of tired workers and the occasional sprinkling of Comrades. She crushed her _ersatz_ cigarette underfoot at number 616 Stalin Avenue, paused for the space of five heartbeats at the door, went inside.  \"What do you want?\" The man at the desk was myopic but bull-necked.  Sophia showed her party card.  \"Oh, Comrade. Still, you are a woman.\"  \"You're terribly observant, Comrade,\" said Sophia coldly. \"I am here to volunteer.\"  \"But a woman.\"  \"There is nothing in the law which says a woman cannot volunteer.\"  \"We don't make women volunteer.\"  \"I mean really volunteer, of her own free will.\"  \"Her--own--free will?\" The bull-necked man removed his spectacles, scratched his balding head with the ear-pieces. \"You mean volunteer without--\"  \"Without coercion. I want to volunteer. I am here to volunteer. I want to sign on for the next Stalintrek.\"  \"Stalintrek, a woman?\"  \"That is what I said.\"  \"We don't force women to volunteer.\" The man scratched some more.  \"Oh, really,\" said Sophia. \"This is 1992, not mid-century, Comrade. Did not Premier Stalin say, 'Woman was created to share the glorious destiny of Mother Russia with her mate?'\" Sophia created the quote randomly.  \"Yes, if Stalin said--\"  \"He did.\"  \"Still, I do not recall--\"  \"What?\" Sophia cried. \"Stalin dead these thirty-nine years and you don't recall his speeches? What is your name, Comrade?\"  \"Please, Comrade. Now that you remind me, I remember.\"  \"What is your name.\"  \"Here, I will give you the volunteer papers to sign. If you pass the exams, you will embark on the next Stalintrek, though why a beautiful young woman like you--\"  \"Shut your mouth and hand me those papers.\"  There, sitting behind that desk, was precisely why. Why should she, Sophia Androvna Petrovitch, wish to volunteer for the Stalintrek? Better to ask why a bird flies south in the winter, one day ahead of the first icy gale. Or why a lemming plunges recklessly into the sea with his multitudes of fellows, if, indeed, the venture were to turn out grimly.  But there, behind that desk, was part of the reason. The Comrade. The bright sharp Comrade, with his depth of reasoning, his fountain of gushing emotions, his worldliness. _Pfooey!_  It was as if she had been in a cocoon all her life, stifled, starved, the cottony inner lining choking her whenever she opened her mouth, the leathery outer covering restricting her when she tried to move. No one had ever returned from the Stalintrek. She then had to assume no one would. Including Sophia Androvna Petrovitch. But then, there was nothing she would miss, nothing to which she particularly wanted to return. Not the stark, foul streets of Stalingrad, not the workers with their vapid faces or the Comrades with their cautious, sweating, trembling, fearful non-decisions, not the higher echelon of Comrades, more frightened but showing it less, who would love the beauty of her breasts and loins but not herself for you never love anything but the Stalinimage and Mother Russia herself, not those terrified martinet-marionettes who would love the parts of her if she permitted but not her or any other person for that matter.  Wrong with the Stalintrek was its name alone, a name one associated with everything else in Russia for an obvious, post-Stalin reason. But everything else about the Stalintrek shrieked mystery and adventure. Where did you go? How did you get there? What did you do? Why?  A million questions which had kept her awake at night and, if she thought about them hard enough, satisfied her deep longing for something different. And then one day when stolid Mrs. Ivanovna-Rasnikov had said, \"It is a joke, a terrible, terrible joke they are taking my husband Fyodor on the Stalintrek when he lacks sufficient imagination to go from here to Leningrad or even Tula. Can you picture Fyodor on the Stalintrek? Better they should have taken me. Better they should have taken his wife.\" That day Sophia could hardly contain herself.  As a party member she had access to the law and she read it three times from start to finish (in her dingy flat by the light of a smoking, foul-smelling, soft-wax candle) but could find nothing barring women from the Stalintrek.  Had Fyodor Rasnikov volunteered? Naturally. Everyone volunteered, although when your name was called you had no choice. There had been no draft in Russia since the days of the Second War of the People's Liberation. Volunteer? What, precisely, did the word mean?  She, Sophia Androvna Petrovitch would volunteer, without being told. Thus it was she found herself at 616 Stalin Avenue, and thus the balding, myopic, bull-necked Comrade thrust the papers across his desk at her.  She signed her name with such vehemence and ferocity that she almost tore through the paper.    CHAPTER II  _Three-score men sit in the crowded, smoke-filled room. Some drink beer, some squat in moody silence, some talk in an animated fashion about nothing very urgent. At the one small door, two guards pace back and forth slowly, creating a gentle swaying of smoke-patterns in the hazy room. The guards, in simple military uniform, carry small, deadly looking weapons._  FIRST MAN: Fight City Hall? Are you kidding? They took you, bud. Don't try to fight it. I know. I _know_.  SECOND MAN: I'm telling you, there was a mistake in the records. I'm over twenty-six. Two weeks and two days. Already I wrote to my Congressman. Hell, that's why I voted for him, he better go to bat for me.  THIRD MAN: You think that's something? I wouldn't be here only those doctors are crazy. I mean, crazy. Me, with a cyst big as a golf ball on the base of my spine.  FIRST MAN: You too. Don't try to fight it.  FOURTH MAN: (Newly named Alaric Arkalion III) I look forward to this as a stimulating adventure. Does the fact that they select men for the Nowhere Journey once every seven hundred and eighty days strike anyone as significant?  SECOND MAN: I got my own problems.  ALARIC ARKALION: This is not a thalamic problem, young man. Not thalamic at all.  THIRD MAN: Young man? Who are you kidding?  ALARIC ARKALION: (Who realizes, thanks to the plastic surgeon, he is the youngest looking of all, with red cheeks and peach-fuzz whiskers) It is a problem of the intellect. Why seven hundred and eighty days?  FIRST MAN: I read the magazines, too, chief. You think we're all going to the planet Mars. How original.  ALARIC ARKALION: As a matter of fact, that is exactly what I think.  SECOND MAN: Mars?  FIRST MAN (Laughing) It's a long way from Mars to City Hall, doc.  SECOND MAN: You mean, through space to Mars?  ALARIC ARKALION: Exactly, exactly. Quite a coincidence, otherwise.  FIRST MAN: You're telling me.  ALARIC ARKALION: (Coldly) Would you care to explain it?  FIRST MAN: Why, sure. You see, Mars is--uh, I don't want to steal your thunder, chief. Go ahead.  ALARIC ARKALION: Once every seven hundred and eighty days Mars and the Earth find themselves in the same orbital position with respect to the sun. In other words, Mars and Earth are closest then. Were there such a thing as space travel, new, costly, not thoroughly tested, they would want to make each journey as brief as possible. Hence the seven hundred and eighty days.  FIRST MAN: Not bad, chief. You got most of it.  THIRD MAN: No one ever said anything about space travel.  FIRST MAN: You think we'd broadcast it or something, stupid? It's part of a big, important scientific experiment, only we're the hamsters.  ALARIC ARKALION: Ridiculous. You're forgetting all about the Cold War.  FIRST MAN: He thinks we're fighting a war with the Martians. (Laughs) Orson Wells stuff, huh?  ALARIC ARKALION: With the Russians. The Russians. We developed A bombs. They developed A bombs. We came up with the H bomb. So did they. We placed a station up in space, a fifth of the way to the moon. So did they. Then--nothing more about scientific developments. For over twenty years. I ask you, doesn't it seem peculiar?  FIRST MAN: Peculiar, he says.  ALARIC ARKALION: Peculiar.  SECOND MAN: I wish my Congressman....  FIRST MAN: You and your Congressman. The way you talk, it was your vote got him in office.  SECOND MAN: If only I could get out and talk to him.  ALARIC ARKALION: No one is permitted to leave.  FIRST MAN: Punishable by a prison term, the law says.  SECOND MAN. Oh yeah? Prison, shmision. Or else go on the Nowhere Journey. Well, I don't see the difference.  FIRST MAN: So, go ahead. Try to escape.  SECOND MAN: (Looking at the guards) They got them all over. All over. I think our mail is censored.  ALARIC ARKALION: It is.  SECOND MAN: They better watch out. I'm losing my temper. I get violent when I lose my temper.  FIRST MAN: See? See how the guards are trembling.  SECOND MAN: Very funny. Maybe you didn't have a good job or something? Maybe you don't care. I care. I had a job with a future. Didn't pay much, but a real blue chip future. So they send me to Nowhere.  FIRST MAN: You're not there yet."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32351"],["title","Voyage To Eternity (#2)"],["body","MAN: Yeah, but I'm going.  THIRD MAN: If only they let you know when. My back is killing me. I'm waiting to pull a sick act. Just waiting, that's all.  FIRST MAN: Go ahead and wait, a lot of good it will do you.  THIRD MAN: You mind your own business.  FIRST MAN: I am, doc. You brought the whole thing up.  SECOND MAN: He's looking for trouble.  THIRD MAN: He'll get it.  ALARIC ARKALION: We're going to be together a long time. A long time. Why don't you all relax?  SECOND MAN: You mind your own business.  FIRST MAN: Nuts, aren't they. They're nuts. A sick act, yet.  SECOND MAN: Look how it doesn't bother him. A failure, he was. I can just see it. What does he care if he goes away forever and doesn't come back? One bread line is as good as another.  FIRST MAN: Ha-ha.  SECOND MAN: Yeah, well I mean it. Forever. We're going away, someplace--forever. We're not coming back, ever. No one comes back. It's for good, for keeps.

Just driving.\"  \"I'm glad they let you come out this once. I don't know what they would have done to me if they didn't. I had to see you this once. I--\"  Temple smiled. He had absented himself without leave. It had been difficult enough and he might yet be in a lot of hot water, but it would be senseless to worry Stephanie. \"It's just for a few hours,\" he said.  \"Hours. When we want a whole lifetime. Kit. Oh, Kit--why don't we run away? Just the two of us, someplace where they'll never find you. I could be packed and ready and--\"  \"Don't talk like that. We can't.\"  \"You want to go where they're sending you. You want to go.\"  \"For God's sake, how can you talk like that? I don't want to go anyplace, except with you. But we can't run away, Steffy. I've got to face it, whatever it is.\"  \"No you don't. It's noble to be patriotic, sure. It always was. But this is different, Kit. They don't ask for part of your life. Not for two years, or three, or a gamble because maybe you won't ever come back. They ask for all of you, for the rest of your life, forever, and they don't even tell you why. Kit, don't go! We'll hide someplace and get married and--\"  \"And nothing.\" Temple stopped the ground-jet, climbed out, opened the door for Stephanie. \"Don't you see? There's no place to hide. Wherever you go, they'd look. You wouldn't want to spend the rest of your life running, Steffy. Not with me or anyone else.\"  \"I would. I would!\"  \"Know what would happen after a few years? We'd hate each other. You'd look at me and say 'I wouldn't be hiding like this, except for you. I'm young and--'\"  \"Kit, that's cruel! I would not.\"  \"Yes, you would. Steffy, I--\" A lump rose in his throat. He'd tell her goodbye, permanently. He had to do it that way, did not want her to wait endlessly and hopelessly for a return that would not materialize. \"I didn't get permission to leave, Steffy.\" He hadn't meant to tell her that, but suddenly it seemed an easy way to break into goodbye.  \"What do you mean? No--you didn't....\"  \"I had to see you. What can they do, send me for longer than forever?\"  \"Then you do want to run away with me!\"  \"Steffy, no. When I leave you tonight, Steffy, it's for good. That's it. The last of Kit Temple. Stop thinking about me. I don't exist. I--never was.\" It sounded ridiculous, even to him.  \"Kit, I love you. I love you. How can I forget you?\"  \"It's happened before. It will happen again.\" That hurt, too. He was talking about a couple of statistics, not about himself and Stephanie.  \"We're different, Kit. I'll love you forever. And--Kit ... I know you'll come back to me. I'll wait, Kit. We're different. You'll come back.\"  \"How many people do you think said _that_ before?\"  \"You don't want to come back, even if you could. You're not thinking of us at all. You're thinking of your brother.\"  \"You know that isn't true. Sometimes I wonder about Jase, sure. But if I thought there was a chance to return--I'm a selfish cuss, Steffy. If I thought there was a chance, you know I'd want you all for myself. I'd brand you, and that's the truth.\"  \"You do love me!\"  \"I loved you, Steffy. Kit Temple loved you.\"  \"Loved?\"  \"Loved. Past tense. When I leave tonight, it's as if I don't exist anymore. As if I never existed. It's got to be that way, Steffy. In thirty years, no one ever returned.\"  \"Including your brother, Jase. So now you want to find him. What do I count for? What....\"  \"This going wasn't my idea. I wanted to stay with you. I wanted to marry you. I can't now. None of it. Forget me, Steffy. Forget you ever knew me. Jase said that to our folks before he was taken.\" Almost five years before Jason Temple had been selected for the Nowhere Journey. He'd been young, though older than his brother Kit. Young, unattached, almost cheerful he was. Naturally, they never saw him again.  \"Hold me, Kit. I'm sorry ... carrying on like this.\"  They had walked some distance from the ground-jet, through scrub oak and bramble bushes. They found a clearing, fragrant-scented, soft-floored still from last autumn, melodic with the chirping of nameless birds. They sat, not talking. Stephanie wore a gay summer dress, full-skirted, cut deep beneath the throat. She swayed toward him from the waist, nestled her head on his shoulder. He could smell the soft, sweet fragrance of her hair, of the skin at the nape of her neck. \"If you want to say goodbye....\" she said.  \"Stop it,\" he told her.  \"If you want to say goodbye....\"  Her head rolled against his chest. She turned, cradled herself in his arms, smiled up at him, squirmed some more and had her head pillowed on his lap. She smiled tremulously, misty-eyed. Her lips parted.  He bent and kissed her, knowing it was all wrong. This was not goodbye, not the way he wanted it. Quickly, definitely, for once and all. With a tear, perhaps, a lot of tears. But permanent goodbye. This was all wrong. The whole idea was to be business-like, objective. It had to be done that way, or no way at all. Briefly, he regretted leaving the encampment.  This wasn't goodbye the way he wanted it. The way it had to be. This was _auf weidersen_.  And then he forgot everything but Stephanie....         *       *       *       *       *  \"I am Alaric Arkalion III,\" said the extremely young-looking man with the old, wise eyes.  How incongruous, Temple thought. The eyes look almost middle-aged. The rest of him--a boy.  \"Something tells me we'll be seeing a lot of each other,\" Arkalion went on. The voice was that of an older man, too, belying the youthful complexion, the almost childish features, the soft fuzz of a beard.  \"I'm Kit Temple,\" said Temple, extending his hand. \"Arkalion, a strange name. I know it from somewhere.... Say! Aren't you--don't you have something to do with carpets or something?\"  \"Here and now, no. I am a number. A-92-6417. But my father is--perhaps I had better say was--my father is Alaric Arkalion II. Yes, that is right, the carpet king.\"  \"I'll be darned,\" said Temple.  \"Why?\"  \"Well,\" Temple laughed. \"I never met a billionaire before.\"  \"Here I am not a billionaire, nor will I ever be one again. A-92-6417, a number. On his way to Mars with a bunch of other numbers.\"  \"Mars? You sound sure of yourself.\"  \"Reasonably. Ah, it is a pleasure to talk with a gentleman. I am reasonably certain it will be Mars.\"  Temple nodded in agreement. \"That's what the Sunday supplements say, all right.\"  \"And doubtless you have observed no one denies it.\"  \"But what on Earth do we want on Mars?\"  \"That in itself is a contradiction,\" laughed Arkalion. \"We'll find out, though, Temple.\"  They had reached the head of the line, found themselves entering a huge, double-decker jet-transport. They found two seats together, followed the instructions printed at the head of the aisle by strapping themselves in and not smoking. Talking all around them was subdued.  \"Contrariness has given way to fear,\" Arkalion observed. \"You should have seen them the last few days, waiting around the induction center, a two-ton chip on each shoulder. Say, where _were_ you?\"  \"I--what do you mean?\"  \"I didn't see you until last evening. Suddenly, you were here.\"  \"Did anyone else miss me?\"  \"But I remember you the first day.\"  \"Did anyone else miss me? Any of the officials?\"  \"No. Not that I know of.\"  \"Then I was here,\" Temple said, very seriously.  Arkalion smiled. \"By George, of course. Then you were here. Temple, we'll get along fine.\"  Temple said that was swell.  \"Anyway, we'd better. Forever is a long time.\"  Three minutes later, the jet took off and soared on eager wings toward the setting sun.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Men, since we are leaving here in a few hours and since there is no way to get out of the encampment and no place to go over the desert even if you could,\" the microphone in the great, empty hall boomed as the two files of men marched in, \"there is no harm in telling you where you are. From this point, in a limited sense, you shall be kept abreast of your progress.  \"We are in White Sands, New Mexico.\"  \"The Garden Spot of the Universe!\" someone shouted derisively, remembering the bleak hot desert and jagged mountain peaks as they came down.  \"White Sands,\" muttered Arkalion. \"It looks like space travel now, doesn't it, Kit.\"  Temple shrugged. \"Why?\"  \"White sands was the center of experiments in rocketry decades ago, when people still talked about those things. Then, for a long time, no one"]]]
