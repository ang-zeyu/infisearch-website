Doctrine that a proposition is the expression of a relation        between two ideas                                             96      2. Doctrine that it is the expression of a relation between the        meanings of two names                                         99      3. Doctrine that it consists in referring something to, or        excluding something from, a class                            103      4.

A definition, what                                           148      2. Every name can be defined, whose meaning is susceptible        of analysis                                                  150      3. Complete, how distinguished from incomplete definitions      152      4. --and from descriptions                                      154      5. What are called definitions of Things, are definitions of        Names with an implied assumption of the existence of        Things corresponding to them                                 157      6. --even when such things do not in reality exist              165      7. Definitions, though of names only, must be grounded on        knowledge of the corresponding Things                        167     BOOK II.    OF REASONING.     CHAPTER I. _Of Inference, or Reasoning, in general._    § 1. Retrospect of the preceding book                             175      2. Inferences improperly so called                              177      3. Inferences proper, distinguished into inductions and        ratiocinations                                               181     CHAPTER II. _Of Ratiocination, or Syllogism._    § 1. Analysis of the Syllogism                                    184      2. The _dictum de omni_ not the foundation of reasoning,        but a mere identical proposition                             191      3. What is the really fundamental axiom of Ratiocination        196      4. The other form of the axiom                                  199     CHAPTER III. _Of the Functions, and Logical Value, of the   Syllogism._    § 1. Is the syllogism a _petitio principii_?                      202      2. Insufficiency of the common theory                           203      3. All inference is from particulars to particulars             205      4. General propositions are a record of such inferences, and        the rules of the syllogism are rules for the interpretation        of the record                                                214      5. The syllogism not the type of reasoning, but a test of it    218      6. The true type, what                                          222      7.

Of Formal Logic, and its relation to the Logic of Truth      231     CHAPTER IV. _Of Trains of Reasoning, and Deductive   Sciences._    § 1. For what purpose trains of reasoning exist                   234      2. A train of reasoning is a series of inductive inferences     234      3. --from particulars to particulars through marks of marks     237      4. Why there are deductive sciences                             240      5. Why other sciences still remain experimental                 244      6. Experimental sciences may become deductive by the progress        of experiment                                                246      7. In what manner this usually takes place                      247     CHAPTER V. _Of Demonstration, and Necessary Truths._    § 1. The Theorems of geometry are necessary truths only in        the sense of necessarily following from hypotheses           251      2. Those hypotheses are real facts with some of their        circumstances exaggerated or omitted                         255      3. Some of the first principles of geometry are axioms, and        these are not hypothetical                                   256      4. --but are experimental truths                                258      5. An objection answered                                        261      6. Dr. Whewell's opinions on axioms examined                    264     CHAPTER VI. _The same Subject continued._    § 1. All deductive sciences are inductive                         281      2. The propositions of the science of number are not verbal,        but generalizations from experience                          284      3. In what sense hypothetical                                   289      4. The characteristic property of demonstrative science is to        be hypothetical                                              290      5. Definition of demonstrative evidence                         292     CHAPTER VII. _Examination of some Opinions opposed to   the preceding doctrines._    § 1. Doctrine of the Universal Postulate                          294      2. The test of inconceivability does not represent the        aggregate of past experience                                 296      3. --nor is implied in every process of thought                 299      4.

CHAPTER I. _Preliminary Observations on Induction in general._    § 1. Importance of an Inductive Logic                             313      2. The logic of science is also that of business and life       314     CHAPTER II. _Of Inductions improperly so called._    § 1. Inductions distinguished from verbal transformations         319      2. --from inductions, falsely so called, in mathematics         321      3. --and from descriptions                                      323      4. Examination of Dr. Whewell's theory of Induction             326      5. Further illustration of the preceding remarks                336     CHAPTER III. _On the Ground of Induction._    § 1. Axiom of the uniformity of the course of nature              341      2. Not true in every sense.

The question of Inductive Logic stated                       348     CHAPTER IV. _Of Laws of Nature._    § 1. The general regularity in nature is a tissue of partial        regularities, called laws                                    351      2. Scientific induction must be grounded on previous        spontaneous inductions                                       355      3. Are there any inductions fitted to be a test of all others?  357     CHAPTER V. _Of the Law of Universal Causation._    § 1. The universal law of successive phenomena is the Law of        Causation                                                    360      2. --_i.e._ the law that every consequent has an invariable        antecedent                                                   363      3. The cause of a phenomenon is the assemblage of its        conditions                                                   365      4. The distinction of agent and patient illusory                373      5. The cause is not the invariable antecedent, but the        _unconditional_ invariable antecedent                        375      6. Can a cause be simultaneous with its effect?                 380      7. Idea of a Permanent Cause, or original natural agent         383      8. Uniformities of coexistence between effects of different        permanent causes, are not laws                               386      9. Doctrine that volition is an efficient cause, examined       387     CHAPTER VI. _Of the Composition of Causes._    § 1. Two modes of the conjunct action of causes, the mechanical        and the chemical                                             405      2. The composition of causes the general rule; the other case        exceptional                                                  408      3. Are effects proportional to their causes?                    412     CHAPTER VII. _Of Observation and Experiment._    § 1. The first step of inductive inquiry is a mental analysis of        complex phenomena into their elements                        414      2. The next is an actual separation of those elements           416      3. Advantages of experiment over observation                    417      4.

Mutual relation of these two methods                         429      4. Joint Method of Agreement and Difference                     433      5. Method of Residues                                           436      6. Method of Concomitant Variations                             437      7.

One effect may have several causes                           482      2. --which is the source of a characteristic imperfection of        the Method of Agreement                                      483      3. Plurality of Causes, how ascertained                         487      4. Concurrence of Causes which do not compound their effects    489      5. Difficulties of the investigation, when causes compound        their effects                                                494      6. Three modes of investigating the laws of complex effects     499      7. The method of simple observation inapplicable                500      8.

There is as great diversity among authors in the modes which they have adopted of defining logic, as in their treatment of the details of it. This is what might naturally be expected on any subject on which writers have availed themselves of the same language as a means of delivering different ideas. Ethics and jurisprudence are liable to the remark in common with logic. Almost every writer having taken a different view of some of the particulars which these branches of knowledge are usually understood to include; each has so framed his definition as to indicate beforehand his own peculiar tenets, and sometimes to beg the question in their favour.  This diversity is not so much an evil to be complained of, as an inevitable and in some degree a proper result of the imperfect state of those sciences. It is not to be expected that there should be agreement about the definition of anything, until there is agreement about the thing itself. To define, is to select from among all the properties of a thing, those which shall be understood to be designated and declared by its name; and the properties must be well known to us before we can be competent to determine which of them are fittest to be chosen for this purpose. Accordingly, in the case of so complex an aggregation of particulars as are comprehended in anything which can be called a science, the definition we set out with is seldom that which a more extensive knowledge of the subject shows to be the most appropriate. Until we know the particulars themselves, we cannot fix upon the most correct and compact mode of circumscribing them by a general description. It was not until after an extensive and accurate acquaintance with the details of chemical phenomena, that it was found possible to frame a rational definition of chemistry; and the definition of the science of life and organization is still a matter of dispute. So long as the sciences are imperfect, the definitions must partake of their imperfection; and if the former are progressive, the latter ought to be so too. As much, therefore, as is to be expected from a definition placed at the commencement of a subject, is that it should define the scope of our inquiries: and the definition which I am about to offer of the science of logic, pretends to nothing more, than to be a statement of the question which I have put to myself, and which this book is an attempt to resolve. The reader is at liberty to object to it as a definition of logic; but it is at all events a correct definition of the subject of these volumes.   § 2. Logic has often been called the Art of Reasoning. A writer[1] who has done more than any other person to restore this study to the rank from which it had fallen in the estimation of the cultivated class in our own country, has adopted the above definition with an amendment; he has defined Logic to be the Science, as well as the Art, of reasoning; meaning by the former term, the analysis of the mental process which takes place whenever we reason, and by the latter, the rules, grounded on that analysis, for conducting the process correctly. There can be no doubt as to the propriety of the emendation. A right understanding of the mental process itself, of the conditions it depends on, and the steps of which it consists, is the only basis on which a system of rules, fitted for the direction of the process, can possibly be founded. Art necessarily presupposes knowledge; art, in any but its infant state, presupposes scientific knowledge: and if every art does not bear the name of a science, it is only because several sciences are often necessary to form the groundwork of a single art. So complicated are the conditions which govern our practical agency, that to enable one thing to be _done_, it is often requisite to _know_ the nature and properties of many"]]]
