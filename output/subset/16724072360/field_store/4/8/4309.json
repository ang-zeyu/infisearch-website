Here he wrote sacred music and his first operas.  In his twenty-second year Handel went to Italy, where he stayed for three years. Here he met and became very friendly with Corelli and the two Scarlattis.                            [Illustration: No. 7                               A.

SCARLATTI.]  After his residence in Italy Handel went back to Germany, where he met the Elector of Hanover, who induced him to accept the post of Capellmeister. Handel agreed to do this on condition that he might first visit England.  When Handel reached England he found himself already well known there. The English people knew his operas, and liked them so much that Handel concluded to stay.  But to his surprise and confusion it happened while he was in London that the very Elector of Hanover became George I, King of England. Handel expected he would fare badly with the king for not having returned as Capellmeister to Germany. But a friend arranged the matter so that Handel should compose some music for the king's coronation, hoping thereby to please his majesty.  He composed twenty-five pieces, called _Water Music_. A boat containing the players followed that in which the king sat. When the music was performed the king asked who composed it. This led to Handel's being invited into the royal boat, where he again won the king's favor.                           [Illustration: No. 10                              WATER MUSIC.]  Handel greatly wished to give opera in London and devote his time to it as composer. For many years the writing and staging of operas took all of Handel's time and thought, but he was not destined to make it a true success. Handel was a very fine performer at the keyboard.                           [Illustration: No. 11                         HANDEL AT THE KEYBOARD.]  Once again Handel visited his native land. On returning to England, which was to be his home for the future, he was asked by a wealthy gentleman, the Duke of Chandos, to become composer at the ducal residence. Handel accepted this offer and composed much beautiful music, which some day we shall hear.  Handel was much beloved in England and was received at court.                           [Illustration: No. 12            HANDEL IN THE DRESS HE WORE AT THE ENGLISH COURT.]  He had tried hard to please the English public as an opera composer, and the disappointment of his failure caused him a severe illness from which he suffered greatly. He lived to write some of the most lovely music the world possesses.  Perhaps the most famous of all his oratorios is the _Messiah_. When this was sung for the first time in London the king and all present rose at the words--_For the Lord God Omnipotent Reigneth_. Thus came the custom of rising at the singing of the _Hallelujah Chorus_.  Handel loved England and became a naturalized British subject. He had a house in London, which in those days must have been considered a very fine one. He was very fond of gathering bodies of musicians together. Here he is in a familiar group.                           [Illustration: No. 13                 HANDEL IN THE CIRCLE OF HIS MUSICIANS.]  A great lover of children, Handel once conducted the _Messiah_ for the benefit of a hospital for little children, to which he gave large sums.  Toward the end of his life he became blind. Some one had to lead him to the organ loft, where, with his wonderful skill, he could still charm and delight.  The last appearance that Handel made in public was to conduct the _Messiah_. A few days later, on Good Friday, April 13, 1759, he passed away.                            [Illustration: No. 14                  BLIND HANDEL BEING LED TO THE ORGAN.]  The English people loved and admired him so much that he was buried in Westminster Abbey.

[Illustration: No. 10                          VERDI AS A YOUNG MAN]  So, as the years went by, he kept on learning more and more, doing his work well and always preparing himself for better things. Then one day he was ready to begin to compose the operas that made him famous.  Some time when you read the full list of Verdi's operas you will learn that he wrote thirty. The first was performed in 1839, when he was twenty-six years old, and the last in 1893, when he was eighty. You will not need to remember the titles of them all, but you must know the names of the great ones, for one day you will see and hear them performed.                           [Illustration: No. 11                          VERDI IN OLD AGE]  Here are the principal ones:      Ernani,             La Traviata,            Aida,     Rigoletto,          Sicilian Vespers,       Othello,     Il Trovatore,       Masked Ball,            Falstaff.  Do you know that of one of Verdi's operas the scene is laid in our country? The MASKED BALL was first entitled Gustavo III. But the authorities would not allow reference to certain political matters in it. Therefore the libretto (or story) of the opera was changed, and the scene laid in Boston, Massachusetts. One of the characters was the Governor of Boston, a humorous matter to us, for there never was any such official.  Another famous opera by Verdi, the scene of which is laid in a foreign country, is Aida. It was written for the Khedive of Egypt, and first performed in Cairo in 1871, when the composer was fifty-eight years old.                           [Illustration: No. 12                          A SCENE FROM AÏDA]  After Verdi had composed Aida he wrote no more operas for sixteen years. Then to the great surprise of all the world he wrote two others, the finest of them all--Othello and Falstaff.  Meanwhile he was a farmer. He planted, harvested, helped his tenants, urged them to cultivate the land carefully. He bought all kinds of American farming machinery to show the Italians how to cultivate the ground to best advantage.  The great man, who was once a simple little boy, died in 1901, on January 27, which day is the anniversary of Mozart's birth.  All his life long Verdi had succeeded, doing a little more and a little better each year, so that, at the end of his life, he was able to do a truly wonderful thing: namely, to build a home where musicians--who had not succeeded in life--could find a comfortable abiding place in their old age.

Here, too, is the tomb of Giuseppe Verdi.  Verdi was loved by his fellow-countrymen. His music is their joy--and ours--and will so remain for years to come; perhaps forever.  The great sculptor, Vincenzo Gemito, has molded wonderful bronze busts of Verdi, which shows us how the little boy of Roncole grew to be a man of world renown.                         *       *       *       *       *                          SOME FACTS ABOUT GIUSEPPE VERDI  Read these facts about Giuseppe Verdi, and try to write his story out of them, using your own words.
