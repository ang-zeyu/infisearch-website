It was a civilized urge, a home-building urge, maybe a narrow urge. But how could anybody stand being here very long, unless such things were done? If they ever could be. Maybe, willfully, he had led himself into a grimmer trap than it had even seemed to be--or than he had ever wanted....         *       *       *       *       *  Inside his space suit, he had begun to sweat furiously. And it was more because of the tension of his nerves than because of the vigor with which he plied his pinchbar, doing the first task which had to be done. Steel ribbons were snapped, nails were yanked silently from the great box, boards were jerked loose.  In another minute John Endlich and his wife were setting up an airtight tent, which, when the time came, could be inflated from compressed-air bottles. They worked somewhat awkwardly, for their instruction period had been brief, and they were green; but the job was speedily finished. The first requirement--shelter--was assured.  Digging again into the vast and varied contents of the box, John Endlich found some things he had not expected--a fine rifle, a pistol and ammunition. At which moment an ironic imp seemed to sit on his shoulder, and laugh derisively. Umhm-m--the Asteroids Homesteaders Office had filled these boxes according to a precise survey of the needs of a peaceful settler on Vesta.  It was like Bubs, with the inquisitiveness of a seven-year-old, to ask: \"What did they think we needed guns for, when they knew there was no rabbits to shoot at?\"  \"I guess they kind of suspected there'd be guys like Alf Neely, son,\" John Endlich answered dryly. \"Even if they didn't tell us about it.\"  The next task prescribed by the Homesteaders' School was to secure a supply of air and water in quantity. Again, following the instructions they had received, the Endlichs uncrated and set up an atom-driven drill. In an hour it had bored to a depth of five-hundred feet. Hauling up the drill, Endlich lowered an electric heating unit on a cable from an atomic power-cell, and then capped the casing pipe.  Yes, strangely enough there was still sufficient water beneath the surface of Vesta. Its parent planet, like the Earth, had had water in its crust, that could be tapped by means of wells. And so suddenly had Vesta been chilled in the cold of space at the time of the parent body's explosion, that this water had not had a chance to dissipate itself as vapor into the void, but had been frozen solid. The drying soil above it had formed a tough shell, which had protected the ice beneath from disappearance through sublimation...  Drill down to it, melt it with heat, and it was water again, ready to be pumped and put to use.  And water, by electrolysis, was also an easy source of oxygen to breathe.... The soil, once thawed over a few acres, would also yield considerable nitrogen and carbon dioxide--the makings of many cubic meters of atmosphere. The A.H.O. survey expeditions, here on Vesta and on other similar asteroids which were crustal chips of the original planet, had done their work well, pathfinding a means of survival here.  When John Endlich pumped the first turbid liquid, which immediately froze again in the surface cold, he might, under other, better circumstances, have felt like cheering. His well was a success. But his tense mind was racing far ahead to all the endless tasks that were yet to be done, to make any sense at all out of his claim. Besides, the short day--eighteen hours long instead of twenty-four, and already far advanced at the time of his tumultuous landing--was drawing to a close.  \"It'll be dark here mighty quick, Johnny,\" Rose said. She was looking scared, again.         *       *       *       *       *  John Endlich considered setting up floodlights, and working on through the hours of darkness. But such lights would be a dangerous beacon for prowlers; and when you were inside their area of illumination, it was difficult to see into the gloom beyond.  Still, one did not know if the mask of darkness did not afford a greater invitation to those with evil intent. For a long moment, Endlich was in an agony of indecision. Then he said:  \"We'll knock off from work now--get in the tent, eat supper, maybe sleep...\"  But he was remembering Neely's promise to return tonight.  In another minute the small but dazzling sun had disappeared behind the broken mountains, as Vesta, unspherical and malformed, tumbled rather than rotated on its center of gravity. And several hours later, amid heavy cooking odors inside the now inflated plastic bubble that was the tent, Endlich was sprawled on his stomach, unable, through well-founded worry, even to remove his space suit or to allow his family to do so, though there was breathable air around them. They lay with their helmet face-windows open. Rose and Evelyn breathed evenly in peaceful sleep.  Bubs, trying to be very much a man, battled slumber and yawns, and kept his dad company with scraps of conversation. \"Let 'em come, Pop,\" he said cheerfully. \"Hope they do. We'll shoot 'em all. Won't we, pop? You got the rifle and the pistol ready, Pop....\"  Yes, John Endlich had his guns ready beside him, all right--for what it was worth. He wished wryly that things could be as simple as his hero-worshipping son seemed to think. Thank the Lord that Bubs was so trusting, for his own peace of mind--the prankish and savage nature of certain kinds of men, with liquor in their bellies, being what it was. For John Endlich, having been, on occasion, mildly kindred to such men, was well able to understand that nature. And understanding, now, chilled his blood.  Peering from the small plastic windows of the tent, he kept watching for hulking black shapes to silhouette themselves against the stars. And he listened on his helmet phones, for scraps of telltale conversation, exchanged by short-range radio by men in space armor. Once, he thought he heard a grunt, or a malicious chuckle. But it may have been just vagrant static.  Otherwise, from all around, the stillness of the vacuum was absolute. It was unnerving. On this airless piece of a planet, an enemy could sneak up on you, almost without stealth.  Against that maddening silence, however, Bubs presently had a helpful and unprompted suggestion: \"Hey, Pop!\" he whispered hoarsely. \"Put the side of your helmet against the tent-floor, and listen!\"  John Endlich obeyed his kid. In a second cold sweat began to break out on his body, as intermittent thudding noises reached his ear. In the absence of an atmosphere, sounds could still be transmitted through the solid substance of the asteroid.  It took Endlich a moment to realize that the noises came, not from nearby, but from far away, on the other side of Vesta. The thudding was vibrated straight through many miles of solid rock.  \"It's nothing, Bubs,\" he growled. \"Nothing but the blasting in the mines.\"  Bubs said \"Oh,\" as if disappointed. Not long thereafter he was asleep, leaving his harrassed sire to endure the vigil alone. Endlich dared not doze off, to rest a little, even for a moment. He could only wait. If an evil visitation came--as he had been all but sure it must--that would be bad, indeed. If it didn't come--well--that still meant a sleepless night, and the postponement of the inevitable. He couldn't win.  Thus the hours slipped away, until the luminous dial of the clock in the tent--it had been synchronized to Vestal time--told him that dawn was near. That was when, through the ground, he heard the faint scraping. A rustle. It might have been made by heavy space-boots. It came, and then it stopped. It came again, and stopped once more. As if skulking forms paused to find their way.  Out where the ancient and ghostly buildings were, he saw a star wink out briefly, as if a shape blocked the path of its light. Then it burned peacefully again. John Endlich's hackles rose. His fists tightened on both his rifle and pistol.  He fixed his gaze on the great box, looming blackly, the box that contained the means of survival for his family and himself, as if he foresaw the future, a moment away. For suddenly, huge as it was, the box rocked, and began to move off, as if it had sprouted legs and come alive.         *       *       *       *       *  John Endlich scrambled to action. He slammed and sealed the face-windows of the helmets of the members of his family, to protect them from suffocation. He did the same for himself, and then unzipped the tent-flap. He darted out with the outrushing air.  This was a moment with murder poised in every tattered fragment of it. John Endlich knew. Murder was engrained in his own taut-drawn nerves, that raged to destroy the trespassers whose pranks had passed the level of practical humor, and become, by the tampering with vital necessities, an attack on life itself. But there was a more immediate menace in these space-twisted roughnecks.... Strike back at them, even in self-defense, and have it proven!  He had not the faintest doubt who they were--even though he could not see their faces in the blackness. Maybe he should lay low--let them have their way.... But how could he--even apart from his raging temper, and his honor as a man--when they were making off with his family's and his own means of survival?  He had to throw Rose and the kids into the balance--risking them to the danger that he knew lay beyond his own possible ignoble demise. He did just that when he raised his pistol, struggling against the awful impulse of the rage in him--lifted it high enough so that the explosive bullets that spewed from it would be sure to pass over the heads of the dark silhouettes that were moving about.  \"Damn you, Neely!\" Endlich yelled into his helmet mike, his finger tightening on the trigger. \"Drop that stuff!\"  At that moment the sun's rim appeared at the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3279"],["title","Canterbury Pieces (#1)"],["body","like to keep_.  _It     has amused me_, _especially the part in which you criticise     yourself_.  _To appreciate the letter fully I ought to have read the     bishop’s letter_, _which seems to have been very rich_.      _You tell me not to answer your note_, _but I could not resist the     wish to thank you for your letter_.      _With every good wish_, _believe me_, _my dear Sir_,                                                          _Yours sincerely_,                                                              _Ch.

A Dialogue                     [From the _Press_, 20 December, 1862.]  F.  So you have finished Darwin?  Well, how did you like him?  C.  You cannot expect me to like him.  He is so hard and logical, and he treats his subject with such an intensity of dry reasoning without giving himself the loose rein for a single moment from one end of the book to the other, that I must confess I have found it a great effort to read him through.  F.  But I fancy that, if you are to be candid, you will admit that the fault lies rather with yourself than with the book.  Your knowledge of natural history is so superficial that you are constantly baffled by terms of which you do not understand the meaning, and in which you consequently lose all interest.  I admit, however, that the book is hard and laborious reading; and, moreover, that the writer appears to have predetermined from the commencement to reject all ornament, and simply to argue from beginning to end, from point to point, till he conceived that he had made his case sufficiently clear.  C.  I agree with you, and I do not like his book partly on that very account.  He seems to have no eye but for the single point at which he is aiming.  F.  But is not that a great virtue in a writer?  C.  A great virtue, but a cold and hard one.  F.  In my opinion it is a grave and wise one.  Moreover, I conceive that the judicial calmness which so strongly characterises the whole book, the absence of all passion, the air of extreme and anxious caution which pervades it throughout, are rather the result of training and artificially acquired self-restraint than symptoms of a cold and unimpassioned nature; at any rate, whether the lawyer-like faculty of swearing both sides of a question and attaching the full value to both is acquired or natural in Darwin’s case, you will admit that such a habit of mind is essential for any really valuable and scientific investigation.  C.  I admit it.  Science is all head—she has no heart at all.  F.  You are right.  But a man of science may be a man of other things besides science, and though he may have, and ought to have no heart during a scientific investigation, yet when he has once come to a conclusion he may be hearty enough in support of it, and in his other capacities may be of as warm a temperament as even you can desire.  C.  I tell you I do not like the book.  F.  May I catechise you a little upon it?  C.  To your heart’s content.  F.  Firstly, then, I will ask you what is the one great impression that you have derived from reading it; or, rather, what do you think to be the main impression that Darwin wanted you to derive?  C.  Why, I should say some such thing as the following—that men are descended from monkeys, and monkeys from something else, and so on back to dogs and horses and hedge-sparrows and pigeons and cinipedes (what is a cinipede?) and cheesemites, and then through the plants down to duckweed.  F.  You express the prevalent idea concerning the book, which as you express it appears nonsensical enough.  C.  How, then, should you express it yourself?  F.  Hand me the book and I will read it to you through from beginning to end, for to express it more briefly than Darwin himself has done is almost impossible.  C.  That is nonsense; as you asked me what impression I derived from the book, so now I ask you, and I charge you to answer me.  F.  Well, I assent to the justice of your demand, but I shall comply with it by requiring your assent to a few principal statements deducible from the work.  C.  So be it.  F.  You will grant then, firstly, that all plants and animals increase very rapidly, and that unless they were in some manner checked, the world would soon be overstocked.  Take cats, for instance; see with what rapidity they breed on the different runs in this province where there is little or nothing to check them; or even take the more slowly breeding sheep, and see how soon 500 ewes become 5000 sheep under favourable circumstances.  Suppose this sort of thing to go on for a hundred million years or so, and where would be the standing room for all the different plants and animals that would be now existing, did they not materially check each other’s increase, or were they not liable in some way to be checked by other causes?  Remember the quail; how plentiful they were until the cats came with the settlers from Europe.  Why were they so abundant?  Simply because they had plenty to eat, and could get sufficient shelter from the hawks to multiply freely.  The cats came, and tussocks stood the poor little creatures in but poor stead.  The cats increased and multiplied because they had plenty of food and no natural enemy to check them.  Let them wait a year or two, till they have materially reduced the larks also, as they have long since reduced the quail, and let them have to depend solely upon occasional dead lambs and sheep, and they will find a certain rather formidable natural enemy called Famine rise slowly but inexorably against them and slaughter them wholesale.  The first proposition then to which I demand your assent is that all plants and animals tend to increase in a high geometrical ratio; that they all endeavour to get that which is necessary for their own welfare; that, as unfortunately there are conflicting interests in Nature, collisions constantly occur between different animals and plants, whereby the rate of increase of each species is very materially checked. Do you admit this?  C.  Of course; it is obvious.  F.  You admit then that there is in Nature a perpetual warfare of plant, of bird, of beast, of fish, of reptile; that each is striving selfishly for its own advantage, and will get what it wants if it can.  C.  If what?  F.  If it can.  How comes it then that sometimes it cannot?  Simply because all are not of equal strength, and the weaker must go to the wall.  C.  You seem to gloat over your devilish statement.  F.  Gloat or no gloat, is it true or no?  I am not one of those      “Who would unnaturally better Nature     By making out that that which is, is not.”  If the law of Nature is “struggle,” it is better to look the matter in the face and adapt yourself to the conditions of your existence.  Nature will not bow to you, neither will you mend matters by patting her on the back and telling her that she is not so black as she is painted.  My dear fellow, my dear sentimental friend, do you eat roast beef or roast mutton?  C.  Drop that chaff and go back to the matter in hand.  F.  To continue then with the cats.  Famine comes and tests them, so to speak; the weaker, the less active, the less cunning, and the less enduring cats get killed off, and only the strongest and smartest cats survive; there will be no favouritism shown to animals in a state of Nature; they will be weighed in the balance, and the weight of a hair will sometimes decide whether they shall be found wanting or no.  This being the case, the cats having been thus naturally culled and the stronger having been preserved, there will be a gradual tendency to improve manifested among the cats, even as among our own mobs of sheep careful culling tends to improve the flock.  C.  This, too, is obvious.  F.  Extend this to all animals and plants, and the same thing will hold good concerning them all.  I shall now change the ground and demand assent to another statement.  You know that though the offspring of all plants and animals is in the main like the parent, yet that in almost every instance slight deviations occur, and that sometimes there is even considerable divergence from"]]]
