Verify the setting of the plane of the horizon from time to time, to make sure that no change has occurred in it.  6. GRAPHICAL REPRESENTATIONS.--Make a graph (drawing) of all the observations, similar to Fig. 5, and find by bisecting a set of chords _g_ to _g_, _e_ to _e_, _d_ to _d_, drawn parallel to _B B_, the time at which the sun's altitude was greatest. In Fig. 5 we see from the intersection of _M M_ with _B B_ that this time was 11h. 50m.  The method of graphs which is here introduced is of great importance in physical science, and the student should carefully observe in Fig. 5 that the line _B B_ is a scale of times, which may be made long or short, provided only the intervals between consecutive hours 9 to 10, 10 to 11, 11 to 12, etc., are equal. The distance of each little circle from _B B_ is taken proportional to the sun's altitude, and may be upon any desired scale--e. g., a millimeter to a degree--provided the same scale is used for all observations. Each circle is placed accurately over that part of the base line which corresponds to the time at which the altitude was taken. Square ruled paper is very convenient, although not necessary, for such diagrams. It is especially to be noted that from the few observations which are represented in the figure a smooth curve has been drawn through the circles which represent the sun's altitude, and this curve shows the altitude of the sun at every moment between 9 A. M. and 3 P. M. In Fig. 5 the sun's altitude at noon was 57°. What was it at half past two?  [Illustration: FIG. 5.--A graph of the sun's altitude.]  7. DIAMETER OF A DISTANT OBJECT.--By sighting over a protractor, measure the angle between imaginary lines drawn from it to the opposite sides of a window. Carry the protractor farther away from the window and repeat the experiment, to see how much the angle changes. The angle thus measured is called \"the angle subtended\" by the window at the place where the measurement was made. If this place was squarely in front of the window we may draw upon paper an angle equal to the measured one and lay off from the vertex along its sides a distance proportional to the distance of the window--e. g., a millimeter for each centimeter of real distance. If a cross line be now drawn connecting the points thus found, its length will be proportional to the width of the window, and the width may be read off to scale, a centimeter for every millimeter in the length of the cross line.  The astronomer who measures with an appropriate instrument the angle subtended by the moon may in an entirely similar manner find the moon's diameter and has, in fact, found it to be 2,163 miles. Can the same method be used to find the diameter of the sun? A planet? The earth?     CHAPTER II  THE STARS AND THEIR DIURNAL MOTION   8. THE STARS.--From the very beginning of his study in astronomy, and as frequently as possible, the student should practice watching the stars by night, to become acquainted with the constellations and their movements. As an introduction to this study he may face toward the north, and compare the stars which he sees in that part of the sky with the map of the northern heavens, given on Plate I, opposite page 124. Turn the map around, upside down if necessary, until the stars upon it match the brighter ones in the sky. Note how the stars are grouped in such conspicuous constellations as the Big Dipper (Ursa Major), the Little Dipper (Ursa Minor), and Cassiopeia. These three constellations should be learned so that they can be recognized at any time.  _The names of the stars._--Facing the star map is a key which contains the names of the more important constellations and the names of the brighter stars in their constellations. These names are for the most part a Greek letter prefixed to the genitive case of the Latin name of the constellation. (See the Greek alphabet printed at the end of the book.)  9. MAGNITUDES OF THE STARS.--Nearly nineteen centuries ago St. Paul noted that \"one star differeth from another star in glory,\" and no more apt words can be found to mark the difference of brightness which the stars present. Even prior to St. Paul's day the ancient Greek astronomers had divided the stars in respect of brightness into six groups, which the modern astronomers still use, calling each group a _magnitude_. Thus a few of the brightest stars are said to be of the first magnitude, the great mass of faint ones which are just visible to the unaided eye are said to be of the sixth magnitude, and intermediate degrees of brilliancy are represented by the intermediate magnitudes, second, third, fourth, and fifth. The student must not be misled by the word magnitude. It has no reference to the size of the stars, but only to their brightness, and on the star maps of this book the larger and smaller circles by which the stars are represented indicate only the brightness of the stars according to the system of magnitudes. Following the indications of these maps, the student should, in learning the principal stars and constellations, learn also to recognize how bright is a star of the second, fourth, or other magnitude.  10. OBSERVING THE STARS.--Find on the map and in the sky the stars α Ursæ Minoris, α Ursæ Majoris, β Ursæ Majoris. What geometrical figure will fit on to these stars? In addition to its regular name, α Ursæ Minoris is frequently called by the special name Polaris, or the pole star. Why are the other two stars called \"the Pointers\"? What letter of the alphabet do the five bright stars in Cassiopeia suggest?  EXERCISE 6.--Stand in such a position that Polaris is just hidden behind the corner of a building or some other vertical line, and mark upon the key map as accurately as possible the position of this line with respect to the other stars, showing which stars are to the right and which are to the left of it. Record the time (date, hour, and minute) at which this observation was made. An hour or two later repeat the observation at the same place, draw the line and note the time, and you will find that the line last drawn upon the map does not agree with the first one. The stars have changed their positions, and with respect to the vertical line the Pointers are now in a different direction from Polaris. Measure with a protractor the angle between the two lines drawn in the map, and use this angle and the recorded times of the observation to find how many degrees per hour this direction is changing. It should be about 15° per hour. If the observation were repeated 12 hours after the first recorded time, what would be the position of the vertical line among the stars? What would it be 24 hours later? A week later? Repeat the observation on the next clear night, and allowing for the number of whole revolutions made by the stars between the two dates, again determine from the time interval a more accurate value of the rate at which the stars move.  The motion of the stars which the student has here detected is called their \"diurnal\" motion. What is the significance of the word diurnal?  In the preceding paragraph there is introduced a method of great importance in astronomical practice--i. e., determining something--in this case the rate per hour, from observations separated by a long interval of time, in order to get a more accurate value than could be found from a short interval. Why is it more accurate? To determine the rate at which the planet Mars rotates about its axis, astronomers use observations separated by an interval of more than 200 years, during which the planet made more than 75,000 revolutions upon its axis. If we were to write out in algebraic form an equation for determining the length of one revolution of Mars about its axis, the large number, 75,000, would appear in the equation as a divisor, and in the final result would greatly reduce whatever errors existed in the observations employed.  Repeat Exercise 6 night after night, and note whether the stars come back to the same position at the same hour and minute every night.  [Illustration: FIG. 6. The plumb-line apparatus.]  [Illustration: FIG. 7. The plumb-line apparatus.]  11. THE PLUMB-LINE APPARATUS.--This experiment, and many others, may be conveniently and accurately made with no other apparatus than a plumb line, and a device for sighting past it. In Figs. 6 and 7 there is shown a simple form of such apparatus, consisting essentially of a board which rests in a horizontal position upon the points of three screws that pass through it. This board carries a small box, to one side of which is nailed in vertical position another board 5 or 6 feet long to carry the plumb line. This consists of a wire or fish line with any heavy weight--e. g., a brick or flatiron--tied to its lower end and immersed in a vessel of water placed inside the box, so as to check any swinging motion of the weight. In the cover of the box is a small hole through which the wire passes, and by turning the screws in the baseboard the apparatus may be readily leveled, so that the wire shall swing freely in the center of the hole without touching the cover of the box. Guy wires, shown in the figure, are applied so as to stiffen the whole apparatus. A board with a screw eye at each end may be pivoted to the upright, as in Fig. 6, for measuring altitudes; or to the box, as in Fig. 7, for observing the time at which a star in its diurnal motion passes through the plane determined by the plumb line and the center of the screw eye through which the observer looks.  The whole apparatus may be constructed by any person of ordinary mechanical skill at a very small cost, and it or something equivalent should be provided for every class beginning observational astronomy. To use the apparatus for the experiment of § 10, it should be leveled, and the board with the screw eyes, attached as in Fig. 7,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34843"],["title","The Boys of '61 (#1)"],["body","5. -- Twenty-Second   Wisconsin and Colonel Utley. -- Judge Robertson and his Boy Jo.   -- The Kentucky Policy reversed. -- An Evening in Louisville.    122   CHAPTER X.
