But he doesn't sleep after eating, like a real snake, it seems. Anyway, he can't climb this crag.\"  Conan spoke imperturbably. He was a barbarian, and the terrible patience of the wilderness and its children was as much a part of him as his lusts and rages. He could endure a situation like this with a coolness impossible to a civilized person.  \"Can't we get into the trees and get away, traveling like apes through the branches?\" she asked desperately.  He shook his head. \"I thought of that. The branches that touch the crag down there are too light. They'd break with our weight. Besides, I have an idea that devil could tear up any tree around here by its roots.\"  \"Well, are we going to sit here on our rumps until we starve, like that?\" she cried furiously, kicking the skull clattering across the ledge. \"I won't do it! I'll go down there and cut his damned head off----\"  Conan had seated himself on a rocky projection at the foot of the spire. He looked up with a glint of admiration at her blazing eyes and tense, quivering figure, but, realizing that she was in just the mood for any madness, he let none of his admiration sound in his voice.  \"Sit down,\" he grunted, catching her by her wrist and pulling her down on his knee. She was too surprised to resist as he took her sword from her hand and shoved it back in its sheath. \"Sit still and calm down. You'd only break your steel on his scales. He'd gobble you up at one gulp, or smash you like an egg with that spiked tail of his. We'll get out of this jam some way, but we shan't do it by getting chewed up and swallowed.\"  She made no reply, nor did she seek to repulse his arm from about her waist. She was frightened, and the sensation was new to Valeria of the Red Brotherhood. So she sat on her companion's--or captor's--knee with a docility that would have amazed Zarallo, who had anathematized her as a she-devil out of hell's seraglio.  Conan played idly with her curly yellow locks, seemingly intent only upon his conquest. Neither the skeleton at his feet nor the monster crouching below disturbed his mind or dulled the edge of his interest.  The girl's restless eyes, roving the leaves below them, discovered splashes of color among the green. It was fruit, large, darkly crimson globes suspended from the boughs of a tree whose broad leaves were a peculiarly rich and vivid green. She became aware of both thirst and hunger, though thirst had not assailed her until she knew she could not descend from the crag to find food and water.  \"We need not starve,\" she said. \"There is fruit we can reach.\"  Conan glanced where she pointed.  \"If we ate that we wouldn't need the bite of a dragon,\" he grunted. \"That's what the black people of Kush call the Apples of Derketa. Derketa is the Queen of the Dead. Drink a little of the juice, or spill it on your flesh, and you'd be dead before you could tumble to the foot of this crag.\"  \"Oh!\"  She lapsed into dismayed silence. There seemed no way out of their predicament, she reflected gloomily. She saw no way of escape, and Conan seemed to be concerned only with her supple waist and curly tresses. If he was trying to formulate a plan of escape, he did not show it.  \"If you'll take your hands off me long enough to climb up on that peak,\" she said presently, \"you'll see something that will surprise you.\"  He cast her a questioning glance, then obeyed with a shrug of his massive shoulders. Clinging to the spire-like pinnacle, he stared out over the forest roof.         *       *       *       *       *  He stood a long moment in silence, posed like a bronze statue on the rock.  \"It's a walled city, right enough,\" he muttered presently. \"Was that where you were going, when you tried to send me off alone to the coast?\"  \"I saw it before you came. I knew nothing of it when I left Sukhmet.\"  \"Who'd have thought to find a city here? I don't believe the Stygians ever penetrated this far. Could black people build a city like that? I see no herds on the plain, no signs of cultivation, or people moving about.\"  \"How could you hope to see all that, at this distance?\" she demanded.  He shrugged his shoulders and dropped down on the shelf.  \"Well, the folk of the city can't help us just now. And they might not, if they could. The people of the Black Countries are generally hostile to strangers. Probably stick us full of spears----\"  He stopped short and stood silent, as if he had forgotten what he was saying, frowning down at the crimson spheres gleaming among the leaves.  \"Spears!\" he muttered. \"What a blasted fool I am not to have thought of that before! That shows what a pretty woman does to a man's mind.\"  \"What are you talking about?\" she inquired.  Without answering her question, he descended to the belt of leaves and looked down through them. The great brute squatted below, watching the crag with the frightful patience of the reptile folk. So might one of his breed have glared up at their troglodyte ancestors, treed on a high-flung rock, in the dim dawn ages. Conan cursed him without heat, and began cutting branches, reaching out and severing them as far from the end as he could reach. The agitation of the leaves made the monster restless. He rose from his haunches and lashed his hideous tail, snapping off saplings as if they had been toothpicks. Conan watched him warily from the corner of his eye, and just as Valeria believed the dragon was about to hurl himself up the crag again, the Cimmerian drew back and climbed up to the ledge with the branches he had cut. There were three of these, slender shafts about seven feet long, but not larger than his thumb. He had also cut several strands of tough, thin vine.  \"Branches too light for spear-hafts, and creepers no thicker than cords,\" he remarked, indicating the foliage about the crag. \"It won't hold our weight--but there's strength in union. That's what the Aquilonian renegades used to tell us Cimmerians when they came into the hills to raise an army to invade their own country. But we always fight by clans and tribes.\"  \"What the devil has that got to do with those sticks?\" she demanded.  \"You wait and see.\"  Gathering the sticks in a compact bundle, he wedged his poniard hilt between them at one end. Then with the vines he bound them together, and when he had completed his task, he had a spear of no small strength, with a sturdy shaft seven feet in length.  \"What good will that do?\" she demanded. \"You told me that a blade couldn't pierce his scales----\"  \"He hasn't got scales all over him,\" answered Conan. \"There's more than one way of skinning a panther.\"  Moving down to the edge of the leaves, he reached the spear up and carefully thrust the blade through one of the Apples of Derketa, drawing aside to avoid the darkly purple drops that dripped from the pierced fruit. Presently he withdrew the blade and showed her the blue steel stained a dull purplish crimson.  \"I don't know whether it will do the job or not,\" quoth he. \"There's enough poison there to kill an elephant, but--well, we'll see.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Valeria was close behind him as he let himself down among the leaves. Cautiously holding the poisoned pike away from him, he thrust his head through the branches and addressed the monster.  \"What are you waiting down there for, you misbegotten offspring of questionable parents?\" was one of his more printable queries. \"Stick your ugly head up here again, you long-necked brute--or do you want me to come down there and kick you loose from your illegitimate spine?\"  There was more of it--some of it couched in eloquence that made Valeria stare, in spite of her profane education among the seafarers. And it had its effect on the monster. Just as the incessant yapping of a dog worries and enrages more constitutionally silent animals, so the clamorous voice of a man rouses fear in some bestial bosoms and insane rage in others. Suddenly and with appalling quickness, the mastodonic brute reared up on its mighty hind legs and elongated its neck and body in a furious effort to reach this vociferous pigmy whose clamor was disturbing the primeval silence of its ancient realm.  But Conan had judged his distance with precision. Some five feet below him the mighty head crashed terribly but futilely through the leaves. And as the monstrous mouth gaped like that of a great snake, Conan drove his spear into the red angle of the jaw-bone hinge. He struck downward with all the strength of both arms, driving the long poniard blade to the hilt in flesh, sinew and bone.  Instantly the jaws clashed convulsively together, severing the triple-pieced shaft and almost precipitating Conan from his perch. He would have fallen but for the girl behind him, who caught his sword-belt in a desperate grasp. He clutched at a rocky projection, and grinned his thanks back at her.  Down on the ground the monster was wallowing like a dog with pepper in its eyes. He shook his head from side to side, pawed at it, and opened his mouth repeatedly to its widest extent. Presently he got a huge front foot on the stump of the shaft and managed to tear the blade out. Then he threw up his head, jaws wide and spouting blood, and glared up at the crag with such concentrated and intelligent fury that Valeria trembled and drew her sword. The scales along his back and flanks turned from rusty brown to a dull lurid red. Most horribly the monster's silence was broken. The sounds that issued from his blood-streaming jaws did not sound like anything that could have been produced by an earthly creation.  With harsh, grating roars, the dragon hurled himself at the crag that was the citadel of his enemies. Again and again his mighty head crashed upward through the branches, snapping vainly on empty air. He hurled his full ponderous weight against the rock until it vibrated from base to crest.

They were supervised by Blue Two, the spare for Blue One.         *       *       *       *       *  Also watching, as silently as Robert, was a pink-and-blue striped robot which had guided the caravan from the entrance gate to the cottage. After one confused protest in a curiously high voice, it had not spoken.  _Maybe we shouldn't have driven through that flower bed_, thought Robert. _Still, the thing ought to be versatile enough to say so. I wouldn't have such a gimcrack contraption!_  He looked up as another humanoid robot in similar colors approached along the line of shrubs separating the main lawns from that surrounding the cottage.  \"Marcia-Joan has finished her nap. You may come to the house now.\"  Robert's jaw hung slack as he sought for a reply. His face flushed at the idea of a robot's offering _him_ permission to enter the house.  Nevertheless, he followed it across the wide lawn and between banks of gaily blossoming flowers to the main house. Robert was not sure which color scheme he disliked more, that of the robot or the unemphatic pastel tints of the house.  The robot led the way inside and along a hall. It pulled back a curtain near the other end, revealing a room with furniture for human use. Robert stared at the girl who sat in an armchair, clad in a long robe of soft, pink material.  She looked a few years younger than he. Her hair and eyes were also brown, though darker. In contrast to Robert's, her smooth skin was only lightly tanned, and she wore her hair much longer. He thought her oval face might have been pleasant if not for the analytical expression she wore.  \"I am quite human,\" he said in annoyance. \"Do you have a voice?\"  She rose and walked over to him curiously. Robert saw that she was several inches shorter than he, about the height of one of his robots. He condescended to bear her scrutiny.  \"You look just as you do on the telescreen,\" she marveled.  Robert began to wonder if the girl were feeble-minded. How else should he look?  \"I usually swim at this hour,\" he said to change the subject. \"Where is the pool?\"  Marcia-Joan stared at him.  \"Pool of what?\" she asked.  Sensing sarcasm, he scowled. \"Pool of water, of course! To swim in. What did you think I meant--a pool of oil?\"  \"I am not acquainted with your habits,\" retorted the girl.  \"None of that stupid wit!\" he snapped. \"Where is the pool?\"  \"Don't shout!\" shouted the girl. Her voice was high and unpleasantly shrill compared with his. \"I don't have a pool. Who wants a swimming pool, anyway?\"  Robert felt his face flushing with rage.  _So she won't tell me!_ he thought. _All right, I'll find it myself. Everybody has a pool. And if she comes in, I'll hold her head under for a while!_  Sneering, he turned toward the nearest exit from the house. The gaily striped robot hastened after him.         *       *       *       *       *  The door failed to swing back as it should have at Robert's approach. Impatiently, he seized the ornamental handle. He felt his shoulder grasped by a metal hand.  \"Do not use the front door!\" said the robot.  \"Let go!\" ordered Robert, incensed that any robot should presume to hinder him.  \"Only Marcia-Joan uses this door,\" said the robot, ignoring Robert's displeasure.  \"I'll use it if I like!\" declared Robert, jerking the handle.  The next moment, he was lifted bodily into the air. By the time he realized what was happening, he was carried, face down, along the hall. Too astonished even to yell, he caught a glimpse of Marcia-Joan's tiny feet beneath the hem of her pink robe as his head passed the curtained doorway.  The robot clumped on to the door at the rear of the house and out into the sunshine. There, it released its grip.  When Robert regained the breath knocked out of him by the drop, and assured himself that no bones were broken, his anger returned.  \"I'll find it, wherever it is!\" he growled, and set out to search the grounds.  About twenty minutes later, he was forced to admit that there really was no swimming pool. Except for a brook fifty yards away, there was only the tiled bathroom of the cottage to bathe in.  \"Primitive!\" exclaimed Robert, eying this. \"Manually operated water supply, too! I must have the robots fix something better for tomorrow.\"  Since none of his robots was equipped with a thermometer, he had to draw the bath himself. Meanwhile, he gave orders to Blue Two regarding the brook and a place to swim. He managed to fill the tub without scalding himself mainly because there was no hot water. His irritation, by the time he had dressed in fresh clothes and prepared for another talk with his hostess, was still lively.  \"Ah, you return?\" Marcia-Joan commented from a window above the back door.  \"It is time to eat,\" said Robert frankly.  \"You are mistaken.\"  He glanced at the sunset, which was already fading.  \"It _is_ time,\" he insisted. \"I always eat at this hour.\"  \"Well, I don't.\"  Robert leaned back to examine her expression more carefully. He felt very much the way he had the day the water-supply robot for his pool had broken down and, despite Robert's bellowed orders, had flooded a good part of the lawn before Blue One had disconnected it. Some instinct warned him, moreover, that bellowing now would be as useless as it had been then.  \"What _do_ you do now?\" he asked.  \"I dress for the evening.\"  \"And when do you eat?\"  \"After I finish dressing.\"  \"I'll wait for you,\" said Robert, feeling that that much tolerance could do no particular harm.  He encountered the pink-and-blue robot in the hall, superintending several plain yellow ones bearing dishes and covered platters. Robert followed them to a dining room.  \"Marcia-Joan sits there,\" the major-domo informed him as he moved toward the only chair at the table.         *       *       *       *       *  Robert warily retreated to the opposite side of the table and looked for another chair. None was visible.  _Of course_, he thought, trying to be fair. _Why should anybody in this day have more than one chair? Robots don't sit._  He waited for the major-domo to leave, but it did not. The serving robots finished laying out the dishes and retired to posts along the wall. Finally, Robert decided that he would have to make his status clear or risk going hungry.  _If I sit down somewhere_, he decided, _it may recognize me as human. What a stupid machine to have!_  He started around the end of the table again, but the striped robot moved to intercept him. Robert stopped.  \"Oh, well,\" he sighed, sitting sidewise on a corner of the table.  The robot hesitated, made one or two false starts in different directions, then halted. The situation had apparently not been included among its memory tapes. Robert grinned and lifted the cover of the nearest platter.  He managed to eat, despite his ungraceful position and what he considered the scarcity of the food. Just as he finished the last dish, he heard footsteps in the hall.  Marcia-Joan had dressed in a fresh robe, of crimson. Its thinner material was gathered at the waist by clasps of gleaming gold. The arrangement emphasized bodily contours Robert had previously seen only in historical films.  He became aware that she was regarding him with much the same suggestion of helpless dismay as the major-domo.  \"Why, you've eaten it all!\" she exclaimed.  \"All?\" snorted Robert. \"There was hardly any food!\"  Marcia-Joan walked slowly around the table, staring at the empty dishes.  \"A few bits of raw vegetables and the tiniest portion of protein-concentrate I ever saw!\" Robert continued. \"Do you call that a dinner to serve a guest?\"  \"And I especially ordered two portions--\"  \"Two?\" Robert repeated in astonishment. \"You must visit me sometime. I'll show you--\"  \"What's the matter with my food?\" interrupted the girl. \"I follow the best diet advice my robots could find in the city library.\"  \"They should have looked for human diets, not song-birds'.\"  He lifted a cover in hopes of finding some overlooked morsel, but the platter was bare.  \"No wonder you act so strangely,\" he said. \"You must be suffering from malnutrition. I don't wonder with a skimpy diet like this.\"  \"It's very healthful,\" insisted Marcia-Joan. \"The old film said it was good for the figure, too.\"  \"Not interested,\" grunted Robert. \"I'm satisfied as I am.\"  \"Oh, yes? You look gawky to me.\"  \"_You_ don't,\" retorted Robert, examining her disdainfully. \"You are short and stubby and too plump.\"  \"_Plump?_\"  \"Worse, you're actually fat in lots of places I'm not.\"  \"At least not between the ears!\"  Robert blinked.  \"Wh-wh-WHAT?\"  \"And besides,\" she stormed on, \"those robots you brought are painted the most repulsive colors!\"         *       *       *       *       *  Robert closed his mouth and silently sought the connection.  _Robots?_ he thought. _Not fat, but repulsive colors, she said. What has that to do with food? The woman seems incapable of logic._  \"And furthermore,\" Marcia-Joan was saying, \"I'm not sure I care for the looks of you! Lulu, put him out!\"  \"Who's Lulu?\" demanded Robert.  Then, as the major-domo moved forward, he understood.  \"What a silly name for a robot!\" he exclaimed.  \"I suppose you'd call it Robert. Will you go now, or shall I call more robots?\"  \"I am not a fool,\" said Robert haughtily. \"I shall go. Thank you for the disgusting dinner.\"  \"Do not use the front door,\" said the robot. \"Only Marcia-Joan uses that. All robots use other doors.\"  Robert growled, but walked down the hall to the back door. As this swung open to permit his passage, he halted.  \"It's dark out there now,\" he complained over his shoulder. \"Don't you have any lights on your grounds? Do you want me to trip over something?\"  \"Of course I have ground lights!\" shrilled Marcia-Joan. \"I'll show you--not that I care if you trip or not.\"  A moment later, lights concealed among the trees glowed into life. Robert walked outside and turned"]]]
