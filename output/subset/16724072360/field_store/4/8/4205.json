Lateral views of the heads of _Hyla pseudopuma pseudopuma_ (left, KU 64884) and _H. p. infucata_ (right, KU 101784). × 4.]  The only other frog in Central America having red webs and anterior and posterior surfaces of the thighs is _Hyla loquax_, which has a broad head, extensive axillary membrane, single median vocal sac, and uniformly creamy yellow flanks; furthermore, _loquax_ lacks conical, pigmented supernumerary tubercles on the toes and a large prepollex with horny nuptial spinules. _Hyla rufitela_ has red webbing, but in no other diagnostic feature resembles _infucata_, for _rufitela_ is green above, white below, and has angular prevomerine dentigerous ridges.  _Remarks._--Most specimens of _Hyla pseudopuma infucata_ were found on bushes and low trees at night. Three males and one clasping pair were on the ground. The habitat is humid lower montane forest where the amount of rainfall is high. Although no breeding was observed nor calls heard, it is presumed that this subspecies breeds in shallow, temporary pools, like those utilized by the nominate subspecies.  The two localities where _Hyla pseudopuma infucata_ is known are in the maze of ridges north of Cerro Pando on the Panamanian-Costa Rican border. The Río Claro is a tributary of the Río Changena, in turn a tributary of the Río Changuinola, which receives many streams and rivers draining the northern slopes of the highlands in Bocas del Toro Province before flowing into the Caribbean. We reached the Río Claro and Río Changena by walking from Finca Santa Clara on the Pacific slopes, over the continental divide, and down the north slope of Cerro Pando.  The subspecific name is derived from the Latin _infucatus_, meaning painted, in allusion to the red colors on the limbs and webs.   Hyla pellita new species  Plate 18  _Holotype._--Adult male, KU 100970 from 33 kilometers north of San Gabriel Mixtepec, Oaxaca, México, elevation 1675 meters; obtained on February 20, 1966, by William E. Duellman and Linda Trueb.  _Paratypes._--KU 100971-2 collected with the holotype and KU 100974-5 from 30 kilometers north of San Gabriel Mixtepec, Oaxaca, México, elevation 1530 meters; same date and collectors.  _Diagnosis._--A small yellowish tan _Hyla_ characterized by tympanum concealed, anal opening not bordered below by large tubercles, brown bands on shanks, and dark flecks on roof of mouth anteriorly.  _Description of holotype._--Adult male having snout-vent length of 27.3 mm.; tibia length 13.7 mm., 50.2 per cent of snout-vent length; foot length (measured from proximal edge of inner metatarsal tubercle to tip of longest toe) 11.7 mm., 42.9 per cent of snout-vent length; head length 8.7 mm., 31.9 per cent of snout-vent length. Snout in lateral profile truncate, rounded above, in dorsal profile rounded; canthus angular; loreal region slightly concave; lips thin, flared. Snout moderately long, distance from anterior corner of eye to nostril slightly less than diameter of eye; nostrils slightly protuberant, directed anterolaterally; internarial area barely depressed; distance between nostrils 2.6 mm.; top of head flat; interorbital distance 3.2 mm., 34.4 per cent of width of head. Diameter of eye 2.7 mm.; thin dermal fold extending from posterior corner of eye to point above insertion of arm; tympanum absent, not visible through skin.  Axillary membrane absent; forearms moderately slender, having indistinct tuberculate fold on ventrolateral edge, lacking distinct transverse fold on wrist; fingers short; length of fingers from shortest to longest, 1-4-2-3, fourth nearly as long as second; discs small, about half again as wide as digits; subarticular tubercules large, round, flattened, distal ones on third and fourth fingers bifid; supernumerary tubercles large, round, present only on proximal segments; prepollex barely enlarged, lacking nuptial excrecence. Web lacking between first and second fingers, extending from base of penultimate phalanx of second to base of antepenultimate phalanx of third, from middle of antepenultimate phalanx of third to distal end of antepenultimate of fourth finger. Heels overlap by about one-fifth length of shank when hind limbs adpressed; tibiotarsal articulation extending to middle of eye, tarsal fold present, extending full length of tarsus; inner metatarsal tubercle flat, ovoid, partly visible from above; outer metatarsal tubercle absent; toes short; length of toes from shortest to longest, 1-2-3-5-4; discs small, about two-thirds width of those on fingers; subarticular tubercles small, round; supernumerary tubercles small, flattened, irregularly arranged on proximal segments. Toes three-fourth webbed; web extending from base of disc of first to middle of penultimate phalanx of second, from base of disc of second to middle of penultimate phalanx of third, from base of disc of third to base of penultimate phalanx of fourth and to base of disc of fifth toe.  Anal opening directed posteriorly at level of dorsal surfaces of thighs, bordered below by vertical dermal folds and few small tubercles; anal sheath absent. Skin heavily granular on throat, chest, belly and ventral surfaces of thighs, smooth elsewhere. Tongue cordiform, deeply notched posteriorly, barely free behind. Prevomerine teeth 3-4, situated on short elevations between small round choanae; vocal slits absent.  Color (in preservative): pale tan above with dark brown mark in occipital region and large irregular brown mark extending from scapular region to sacral region; anterior and posterior surfaces of thighs and flanks lacking pigment; dorsal surfaces of arms, shanks, and feet tan with brown transverse bars (two on each forearm, two on left shank, one on right shank, and one on each foot); entire dorsal surfaces, except hands and first four toes, peppered with black; venter creamy white; roof of mouth between, and anterior to, choanae speckled with minute black flecks.  Color (in life): yellowish tan above with reddish brown flecks (later changed to pale brown with dull olive-green interorbital bar, blotch on back, and flecks on dorsum); hands, feet, and anterior and posterior surfaces of thighs dull yellow; belly white; creamy white stripes on outer edge of forearm, foot, and above anus; iris pale silver-bronze.  _Variation._--Three adult males (including holotype) have snout-vent lengths of 25.2-27.3 (mean 26.5) mm., and two females have 28.6 and 31.6 (mean 30.1) mm. One juvenile has a snout-vent length of 21.5 mm. No significant variation occurs in the proportions. Males have 6-8, and females have 8 and 9, prevomerine teeth. The tympanum is completely concealed in all specimens.  All specimens have distinct transverse bars on the limbs; the number of bars on the shank varies from one to four. Two individuals are dark brown dorsally; in these the small black flecks either are not visible or are absent; flecks are present on the dorsal surfaces of four specimens that are tan or pale brown above with darker brown irregular markings.  The coloration in life consisted of olive-green or olive-brown markings on the body and olive-green or brown bars on the limbs. The dorsal ground color was yellowish tan or pale brown in all individuals.  _Comparisons._--_Hyla pellita_ differs from all known Middle American _Hyla_, except _mixe_, _mixomaculata_, _nubicola_, and _pinorum_, by having a concealed tympanum. The first three of these differ from _pellita_ in greater size and by having many bands on the hind limbs. Superficially _H. pellita_ resembles _Hyla pinorum_, which likewise has a tan dorsum with irregular markings and limbs with transverse bars. _Hyla pinorum_ differs from _pellita_ by having a proportionately larger head, no transverse bands on the thighs, and large tubercles below the anus. Furthermore, in _pinorum_ the quadratojugal articulates with the maxillary, whereas in _pellita_ the quadratojugal is reduced to a small spur and does not articulate with the maxillary.  _Remarks._--All individuals were found on low vegetation along streams in cloud forest at night. No specimens were found when the type locality was revisited in August, 1966.  Duellman (1960) placed _Hyla pinorum_ Taylor in the synonymy of _Ptychohyla leonhardschultzei_ Ahl. At that time only the holotype, a female, of _H. pinorum_ was known.

He was still tense and twitchy when they reached the factory.  As custom demanded, everyone was out of sight. Nobody met them at the gate, or observed their silent progress up the escalator to the personnel office. Noiselessly, through empty soundproof offices, they walked together to the ceremonial chamber.  The door they used was the room's only entrance. It was hooked open invitingly. Within was a small conference table of imitation oak, and six chairs of imitation leather. Ceiling, walls, and floor were plastic sheets in soft, sandy shades that harmonized with the furniture's rich browns.  [Illustration]  On the table were four wristlets, four anklets, and two belts, all made of iron links and stamped with either Bozzy's or Mr. Kojac's name. As he had been told to do, Bozzy picked out and put on his own set while Mr. Kojac rested in the armchair at the head of the table. Then, breathing noisily, he knelt before Mr. Kojac and fastened the old man's anklets.  He rose, grunting. Mr. Kojac held out first the left hand, then the right, while Bozzy put the wristlets on him. Their cheeks accidentally touched while Bozzy fastened the belt. He thought of his father and was irrationally tempted to plant a kiss, as if he were four instead of forty.  He stifled the impulse and shook hands instead.  \"Good luck,\" Mr. Kojac said.         *       *       *       *       *  The procedure did not call for that remark, and so, for a second, Bozzy forgot what came next. Then, helped by the stimulant pill, he focused his thoughts, crossed the room, and turned a lighted red switch that glowed by the door.  He heard a muffled clank as iron links froze to the magnetized armchair, sounding the signal for his speech.  \"Sir,\" he intoned, \"the Company takes this opportunity to express its deep and heart-felt appreciation of the thirty-five years you have devoted to serving the Company, the furniture industry generally, and that great public, our customers.\"  Without looking at Mr. Kojac, he bowed, turned, went out, and released the catch holding the door open. It closed automatically, and automatically set in motion the rest of the ceremony.  From somewhere out of sight, fat Mr. Frewne waddled over and briefly shook Bozzy's hand.  \"You've done fine,\" he wheezed. \"A little late getting started, but that's to be expected. Every-thing's fine--just fine!\"  Praise seemed a miscue. Bozzy didn't quite know how to answer.  \"Sir,\" he asked, mopping his forehead, \"what about Mr. Kojac?\"  \"Oh, he's all right,\" Mr. Frewne said. \"Those fumes are fast. We can leave the rest to the undertaker.\"  He slapped Bozzy on the back and pushed him down the corridor. \"Come on into my office, boy. I'll pour you a drink--pour us each one, as a matter of fact. And hand over your iron jewelry, son. You won't need that stuff again for thirty-five years.\"                                                            --DAVE DRYFOOS         *       *       *       *       *"]]]
