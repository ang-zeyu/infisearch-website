Still the inevitable question would occur where did Saturnus or Kronos come from.  And, in forms and statements more and more vague, the answer was that he was born from Uranus or Ouranos, which is the name of the Heaven over all which seemed to embrace all things.  The Greek name of Saturn was spelled Kronos.  The Greek name of Time was spelled Chronos.  A similarity between the two was imagined.  And the whole statement, when reduced to rationalistic language, would be that from Uranus, the infinite, was born Chronos, Time,-- that from Time, Zeus or Jupiter was born, and that he is the only child of Time who has complete sway over mortals and immortals.    \"The will of Jove I own,   Who mortals and immortals rules alone.\"   Homer, II.xii  Jupiter was son of Saturn (Kronos) [The names included in parentheses are the Greek, the others being the Roman or Latin names] and Ops (Rhea in Greek, sometimes confounded with the Phrygian Cybele).  Saturn and Rhea were of the race of Titans, who were the children of Earth and Heaven, which sprang from Chaos, of which we shall give a further account in our next chapter.  In allusion to the dethronement of Ouranos by Kronos, and of Kronos or Saturnus by Zeus or Jupiter, Prometheus says in AEschylus's tragedy,--    \"You may deem   Its towers impregnable; but have I not   already seen two monarchs hurled from them.\"  Thee is another cosmogony, or account of the creation, according to which Earth, Erebus, and Love were the first of beings.  Love (Eros)_ issued from the egg of Night, which floated on Chaos.  By his arrows and torch he pierced and vivified all things, producing life and joy.  Saturn and Rhea were not the only Titans.  There were others, whose names were Oceanus, Hyperion, Iapetus, and Ophion, males; and Themis, Mnemosyne, Eurynome, females.  They are spoken of as the elder gods, whose dominion was afterwards transferred to others.  Saturn yielded to Jupiter, Oceanus to Neptune, Hyperion to Apollo.  Hyperion was the father of the Sun, Moon, and Dawn. He is therefore the original sun-god, and is painted with the splendor and beauty which were afterwards bestowed on Apollo.  \"Hyperion's curls, the front of Jove himself.\"   Shakespeare  Ophion and Eurynome ruled over Olympus till they were dethroned by Saturn and Rhea.  Milton alludes to them in Paradise Lost.  He says the heathen seem to have had some knowledge of the temptation and fall of man,--    \"And fabled how the serpent, whom they called   Ophion, with Eurynome (the wide-   Encroaching Eve perhaps), had first the rule   Of high Olympus, thence by Saturn driven.\"  The representations given of Saturn are not very consistent, for on the one hand his reign is said to have been the golden age of innocence and purity, and on the other he is described as a monster who devoured his own children [This inconsistency arises from considering the Saturn of the Romans the same with the Grecian deity Chronos (Time), which, as it brings an end to all things which have had a beginning, may be said to devour its own offspring.] Jupiter, however, escaped this fate, and when grown up espoused Metis (Prudence), who administered a draught to Saturn which caused him to disgorge his children.  Jupiter, with his brothers and sisters, now rebelled against their father Saturn, and his brothers the Titans; vanquished them, and imprisoned some of them in Tartarus, inflicting other penalties on others.  Atlas was condemned to bear up the heavens on his shoulders.  On the dethronement of Saturn, Jupiter with his brothers Neptune (Poseidon) and Pluto (Dis) divided his dominions.  Jupiter's portion was the heavens, Neptune's the ocean, and Pluto's the realms of the dead.  Earth and Olympus were common property. Jupiter was king of gods and men.  The thunder was his weapon, and he bore a shield called AEgis, made for him by Vulcan.  The eagle was his favorite bird, and bore his thunderbolts.  Juno (Hera)[pronounce He-re, in two syllables] was the wife of Jupiter, and queen of the gods.  Iris, the goddess of the rainbow, was her attendant and messenger.  The peacock was her favorite bird.  Vulcan (Hephaistos), the celestial artist, was the son of Jupiter and Juno.  He was born lame, and his mother was so displeased at the sight of him that she flung him out of heaven.  Other accounts say that Jupiter kicked him out for taking part with his mother, in a quarrel which occurred between them.  Vulcan's lameness, according to this account, was the consequence of his fall.  He was a whole day falling, and at last alighted in the island of Lemnos, which was thenceforth sacred to him.  Milton alludes to this story in Paradise lost, Book I.    \"From morn   To noon he fell, from noon to dewy eve,   A summer's day; and with the setting sun   Dropped from the zenith, like a falling star,   On Lemnos, the AEgean isle.\"  Mars (Ares), the god of war, was the son of Jupiter and Juno. Phoebus Apollo [this is a Greek name of a Greek divinity, who seems to have had no Roman resemblance], the god of archery, prophecy, and music, was the son of Jupiter and Latona, and brother of Diana (Artemis).  He was god of the sun, as Diana, his sister, was the goddess of the moon.  Venus (Aphrodite), the goddess of love and beauty, was the daughter of Jupiter and Dione.  Others say that Venus sprang from the foam of the sea.  The zephyr wafted her along the waves to the Isle of Cyprus, where she was received and attired by the Seasons, and then led to the assembly of the gods.  All were charmed with her beauty, and each one demanded her for his wife. Jupiter gave her to Vulcan, in gratitude for the service he had rendered in forging thunderbolts.  So the most beautiful of the goddesses became the wife of the most ill-favored of the gods. Venus possessed an embroidered girdle called the Cestus, which had the power of inspiring love.  Her favorite birds were swans and doves, and the plants sacred to her were the rose and the myrtle.  Cupid (Eros), the god of love, was the son of Venus.  He was her constant companion; and, armed with bow and arrows, he shot the darts of desire into the bosoms of both gods and men.  There was a deity named Anteros, who was sometimes represented as the avenger of slighted love, and sometimes as the symbol of reciprocal affection.  The following legend is told of him:--  Venus, complaining to Themis that her son Eros continued always a child, was told by her that it was because he was solitary, and that if he had a brother he would grow apace.  Anteros was soon afterwards born, and Eros immediately was seen to increase rapidly in size and strength.  Minerva (Pallas Athene), the goddess of wisdom, was the offspring of Jupiter, without a mother.  She sprang from his head, completely armed.  Her favorite bird was the owl, and the plant sacred to her the olive.  Byron, in \"Childe Harold,\" alludes to the birth of Minerva thus:--    \"Can tyrants but by tyrants conquered be,   And freedom find no champion and no child,   Such as Columbia saw arise, when she   Sprang forth a Pallas, armed and undefiled?   Or must such minds be nourished in the wild,   Deep in the unpruned forest, 'midst the roar   Of Cataracts, where nursing Nature smiled   On infant Washington?  Has earth no more   Such seeds within her breast, or Europe no such shore?\"  Mercury (Hermes), was the son of Jupiter and Maia.  He presided over commerce, wrestling and other gymnastic exercises; even over thieving, and everything, in short, which required skill and dexterity.  He was the messenger of Jupiter, and wore a winged cap and winged shoes.  He bore in his hand a rod entwined with two serpents, called the Caduceus.  Mercury is said to have invented the lyre.  Four hours after his birth he found the shell of a tortoise, made holes in the opposite edges of it, and drew cords of linen through them, and the instrument was complete [From this origin of the instrument, the word \"shell\" is often used as synonymous with :\"lyre,\" and figuratively for music and poetry.  Thus Gray, in his ode on the \"Progress of Poesy,\" says,-- \"O Sovereign of the willing soul, Parent of sweet and solemn-breathing airs, Enchanting shell! The sullen Cares And Frantic Passions hear thy soft control.\"] The cords were nine, in honor of the nine Muses.  Mercury gave the lyre to Apollo, and received from him in exchange the caduceus.  Ceres (Demeter) was the daughter of Saturn and Rhea.  She had a daughter named Proserpine (Persephone), who became the wife of Pluto, and queen of the realms of the dead.  Ceres presided over agriculture.  Bacchus (Dionysus)_, the god of wine, was the son of Jupiter and Semele.  He represents not only the intoxicating power of wine, but its social and beneficent influences likewise; so that he is viewed as the promoter of civilization, and a lawgiver and lover of peace.  The muses were the daughters of Jupiter and Mnemosyne (Memory). They presided over song, and prompted the memory.  They were nine in number, to each of whom was assigned the presidency over some particular department of literature, art, or science.  Calliope was the muse of epic poetry, Clio of history, Euterpe of lyric poetry, Melpomene of tragedy, Terpischore of choral dance and song, Erato of love-poetry, Polyhymnia of sacred poetry, Urania of astronomy, Thalia [Pronounced Tha-lei-a, with the emphasis on the second syllable] of comedy.  Spenser described the office of the Graces thus:--    \"These three on men all gracious gifts bestow   Which deck the body or adorn the mind,   To make them lovely or well-favored show;   As comely carriage, entertainment kind,   Sweet semblance, friendly offices that bind,   And all the compliments of courtesy;   They teach us how to each degree and kind   We should ourselves demean, to low, to high.   To friends, to foes; which skill men call Civility.\"  The Fates were also three   Clotho, Lachesis, and Atropos.  Their office was to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33280"],["title","Civil War Experiences (#1)"],["body","on a coal train to Philadelphia.  On landing at Walnut Street wharf I went into the soldiers' refreshment room, maintained by the citizens of Philadelphia, which was open night and day, and at which all soldiers passing through the city were fed free of charge. It was about two o'clock in the morning, very hot, and I was tired and depressed. Hence, when invited to partake of some refreshments, I was unable to do so but contented myself with eating a few pickles.  I then walked across the city to the Baltimore depot, which was then at the corner of Broad and Pine Streets, and took a passenger train for Baltimore, which I reached about seven o'clock in the morning, sitting up, as there were no sleeping-cars in those days. On arriving in Baltimore I walked to another part of the city to take the train for Washington. Meanwhile I wanted some breakfast. Going into a place which I supposed was a restaurant, I found that the only thing they could offer me was ice-cream. I thereupon ate some, and soon after took the train for Washington. In a few moments the Philadelphia pickles, the hot night, and the Baltimore ice-cream produced most severe cramps, and I was in a very distressed state of mind, fearing that I would never be able to reach the front, but would have to submit to the mortification of being returned home.  Arriving in Washington, I went to Willard's Hotel, and, after a good sleep, was able to take my dinner that evening. I had on citizen's clothes and was not recognized as a private soldier in the United States Army, so the head-waiter assigned me to a seat at a table where General Halleck, the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, sat opposite.  That evening, my uncle, E. V. Price, who was in Washington, met me at the hotel and took me to General Pope's room. The latter had just arrived in Washington to take command of the Army of the Potomac. My uncle procured a pass from him to enable me to go through the lines and join my regiment, the Second New York Cavalry (Harris Light). It was stationed at Falmouth, Virginia. J. Mansfield Davies was the colonel at that time, and Judson Kilpatrick the lieutenant-colonel. My uncle, who knew Colonel Davies, introduced me to him that evening at the hotel. The following morning I accompanied him on the boat to Aquia Creek and reached the regiment on the evening of that day.  In two or three days I received my uniform and a horse was given to me. The fact that I had been seen coming into camp with the Colonel led some of the non-commissioned officers and men of my company to assume that I did not intend to serve in the ranks, but would likely be commissioned shortly and probably be jumped over them, who had already been out some time, though they had not been in any battle, their previous service being confined to drilling and a skirmish or two. This made it very unpleasant for me, and for a short time I was subjected to some little annoyance.  As I wore to the front the best suit of citizen's clothes I had, a man in our company by the name of Rufus West proposed to buy them and agreed to pay me eleven dollars for them. That night he deserted and joined Mosby's command, having made the remark before leaving that he did not \"propose to fight to free niggers.\" He owes me the eleven dollars yet.  In a day or two I was assigned to picket duty with a man of my company, on the Rappahannock River, with instructions to keep a sharp lookout, as they said a female spy was expected to cross at that point. My comrade was Henry E. Johns, who enlisted from Hartford, Connecticut. He appeared to take pity on me, and that evening we discussed our families and our affairs; and at that time a warm attachment was formed, which lasted throughout the war, and since. As we were to remain on guard all night, he suggested that we should take turns, each being on watch, two hours on, and two hours off. Before morning I found it extremely difficult to keep my eyes open, and several times walked to the river and washed my face in order to do so. Just before daylight it was my turn to go to sleep; when I awoke and looked around, I found no one on watch. Looking beside me I found my comrade, also asleep. The place at which we were posted was inaccessible in the night from our lines, because it was at the foot of a deep ravine. I don't imagine any female spy crossed at that point. If we had been caught asleep, however, it would have been an embarrassing position for both of us to have been placed in.  [Illustration: CORPORAL HENRY E. JOHNS]  A few days later the Harris Light Cavalry made a raid in the neighborhood of Fredericks Hall, Virginia, in which movement the command marched some ninety miles in thirty hours. This was hard on the men, and many of them were confined to their tents on their return to camp, from saddle boils and lameness, for a day or two. I found it difficult to keep awake on the march and picket, yet I was able to do duty without interruption.  On this raid the regiment destroyed considerable property, and many of the men carried away all sorts of things for which they had no use. Indeed, I heard Colonel Kilpatrick laughingly remark that one fellow, in his zeal to have something, actually had a grindstone on his saddle in front of him. After carrying it about a mile he concluded, however, that he had no further use for it, and dropped it in the road.     CHAPTER II   A few days afterwards the regiment marched through Culpeper and reached the battlefield of Cedar Mountain late on the day on which that engagement was fought. We approached the battlefield through what would be called the rear, where we first saw the horrible sights accompanying a battle, which are always dead horses, broken caissons, bodies lying on the ground, and the wounded. On the front line these sights are not so prominent.  The regiment was pushed to the front and placed on picket duty, I being posted on the edge of a piece of woods overlooking a valley, on the opposite side of which was Slaughter Mountain, where Stonewall Jackson's army was supposed to be.  While at my post on picket that night, an incident occurred which made a deep impression upon me, doubtless due to the time and place and the incidents of the preceding two weeks. Before leaving home, I had promised my mother that I would read at least one verse in my Testament each day. Not having done so that day was due to the fact that we had been marching and to the excitement attending the reaching of the battlefield and being put in position. I then took out my pocket Testament and went to a picket fire near where I was, leaning over to read a verse or two by its light, when I heard a rustle in the bushes. Immediately I grasped my weapons and was on the alert, when a colored man crawled through the bushes and said to me, \"What's that you got there, a Testament?\" On admitting it, he said, \"Do you know the chapter General Washington always used to read before he went into a fight?\" I told him I did not, whereupon he said, \"You turn to the Ninety-first Psalm.\" \"Now,\" he said, \"you read it.\" I then read aloud:       \"Surely He shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler and from      the noisome pestilence.       \"He shall cover thee with His feathers and under His wings shalt      thou trust; His truth shall be thy shield and buckler.       \"Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night nor for the arrow      that flieth by day.       \"Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness, nor for the      destruction that wasteth at noon day.       \"A thousand shall fall at thy side and ten thousand at thy right      hand; but it shall not come nigh thee.\"  At the reading of each of these verses he exclaimed, \"You see, he didn't get hit.\" The contraband evidently was perfectly sincere in the belief that if I read this verse before a battle I would never get hurt. He then went away. This incident, coupled with the facts that I had only been about ten days away from home, that I had seen the horrible sights of the battlefield the previous afternoon, that I could see the enemy's camp-fires across the valley, and that I was wondering what fate was in store for me the following day,--all tended to impress this incident upon my mind.  The next morning the regiment advanced to the Rapidan River, presumably with the object of searching for the flank of Jackson's army. Just above the ford, which I think was Robertson's, was the residence of the Confederate General Taliaferro. Our picket line was between the house and the river. Captain Walters of my regiment had arranged with Mrs. Taliaferro to have breakfast at her house. She and her niece were engaged in a good-natured altercation with some of the men of my company, she repeatedly remarking, \"I want you men to understand that I am the granddaughter of Chief-Justice Marshall of the United States.\" When she had said this several times an Irishman of my company remarked, \"And who the divil is he anyhow?\" The disgust on her face may well be imagined. I had been polite in my remarks to her when she turned upon me and asked, \"Aren't you from New Orleans?\" I told her, \"No,\" that I was from New York, when she shook her head sadly and said, \"Well, I'm surprised that apparently such a nice young man as you should be engaged in such a wicked cause as this.\" The laughter of my comrades which greeted this remark was followed by their teasing me the rest of the campaign, calling me, \"The nice young man and the wicked cause.\"  About this time the pickets began firing, when Captain Walters remarked, \"I will go down and see what the matter is.\" He mounted his horse, started down the hill toward the ford, and in a moment or two was brought back dead, their sharpshooters having shot him through the heart immediately after he left the house. This was the first time I had heard bullets whistle.  That night Stonewall Jackson's movement to the flank and rear of Pope's army resulted in the recall of the cavalry and a night"]]]
