In the original description, Baird listed three specimens, purportedly from \"Indianola, Texas\" (J. H. Clark, 438), from the Río Grande, Texas (J. H. Clark, 768), and from near San Antonio, Texas (Dr. Kennerley, no number). None of these three specimens could have been _ornata_ as conceived of by us because all were collected outside the geographic range of _ornata_. However, there was also included a plate with a drawing of a specimen and a reference to an earlier paper (Baird and Girard, 1853) in which a specimen obtained by Col. Graham \"Between San Antonio and El Paso\" was described. Smith and Brown (1946:72) have presented evidence that this specimen figured (rather than any of the three specifically mentioned) served as a basis for the plate, and they therefore considered it to be the holotype of _ornata_, even though Baird referred this specimen to \"_Eutaenia parietalis_ Say\" in the same paper (1859) in which the original description of _ornata_ was published. Cope (1900:1079) listed under _Eutaenia sirtalis parietalis_ a specimen, U. S. Nat. Mus. No. 960, from El Paso, obtained by Col. Graham, and referred to it as a type (without specifying of what it was the type). Smith and Brown (_loc. cit._) interpreted this statement by Cope as further evidence that the specimen in question should be considered the type of _ornata_, and they restricted the type locality, originally stated as \"between San Antonio and El Paso\" to \"El Paso.\" Actually all valid records of the species _sirtalis_ from the vicinity of the Río Grande are from the El Paso region or from farther north.  It is with some misgivings that we herewith accept the interpretation proposed by Smith and Brown regarding the applicability of the name _ornata_ and the designation by these authors of the now missing specimen from the region of El Paso as the holotype of that form. The evidence linking the name _ornata_ with the New Mexican subspecies is tenuous; there is some doubt as to the provenance of U. S. Nat. Mus. No. 960 (the supposed type), and even more doubt as to whether this is the specimen depicted in the plate that formed part of the original description.  Cope (1900:1076) recognized as a distinct subspecies, _Eutaenia sirtalis dorsalis_, the same population that we recognize herein as _T. s. ornata_, and Smith (1942:98) considered the name _dorsalis_ to be a synonym of _T. s. parietalis_. However, it is almost certain that both authors misapplied the name, since the type of Baird's and Girard's (1853:31) _Eutainia dorsalis_ was obtained in Coahuila, Mexico, between Monclova and the Río Grande, far south of the known range limits of _T. sirtalis_ in Texas. The description does not fit _T. sirtalis_ and almost certainly pertains to another species.      _Specimens examined._--Univ. of Kansas Mus. Nat. Hist.     (hereafter abbreviated to \"KU\") Nos. 5479 to 5497, from the     north end of Elephant Butte Reservoir, Sierra County, New     Mexico, and 8592 and 8593 from near Las Lunas, Valencia     County, New Mexico; Univ. of New Mexico Mus. Nos. 571 and     572 (J. S. Findley) from 2 miles west and 1/4 mile north of     Albuquerque, Bernalillo County, New Mexico, and No. 4021 (E.     D. Flaherty) from 1 mile west and 1/2 mile south of Isleta,     Bernalillo County, New Mexico.   DESCRIPTION OF _T. S. PARIETALIS_  From most of the vast area occupied by _parietalis_, material has not been available to us, and our concept of this subspecies is based chiefly on specimens and living material from Kansas and northeastern Colorado. A total of 520 live _parietalis_ has been examined from the University of Kansas Natural History Reservation some 130 miles south and a little east of the type locality in Nebraska. These probably differ but little from typical specimens. The range of individual variation in pattern is especially notable. In those from the Reservation, the ground color varies from dull olive-brown to almost jet black. The markings on the dorsolateral area vary in color, in shade and in extent. These marks are chiefly confined to the skin between the scales of rows three to nine. Although most typically these marks are of some shade of red (hence the name \"red-sided garter snake\"), they may be pale buff, or pale greenish yellow, or may even have a bluish tint. In approximately ten per cent of the specimens from the Reservation there is no red at all in the pattern, which hence is similar to that of _T. s. sirtalis_ in the eastern United States. Only a minority have all the dorsolateral marks red, and in some of these specimens the marks higher on the sides are progressively paler red, having a bleached out appearance. Most typically the marks between rows three to six are some shade of red while the smaller marks between rows six to nine are pale--yellowish, greenish, or buffy. In some the pale area of the lateral stripe is in varying degrees suffused with red, which may extend onto the edges of the ventrals and even to the underside of the tail.  _T. s. parietalis_ may be diagnosed, on the basis of these snakes from northeastern Kansas, as follows: Size medium large (length 23.5 to 34.5, or, exceptionally 43.5 inches in adult males; 32.5 to 46.0 inches in adult females), dorsolateral color olive to black. Approximately every other scale of the third row is bordered above and anteriorly by a crescent-shaped area of scarlet colored skin. Similar crescent-shaped areas border the scales of the fourth and fifth rows and often two adjacent crescents meet at the ends of an intervening scale and fuse forming an H-shaped mark. Placed alternately with these markings are similar but smaller crescent-shaped markings on the skin of the upper half of the dorsolateral area on each side bordering every other scale of the sixth, seventh and eighth rows. The crescents of this upper series also may fuse to form series of H-shaped markings alternating with those of the lower series. The dorsal stripe is yellow with a faint dusky suffusion; it involves all of the middorsal scale row and approximately the adjacent half of the row on either side. The lateral stripe is faint, yellowish gray, chiefly on the upper half of the second scale row, lower half of third, and the intervening skin, and is often invaded or suffused by the red marks of the dorsolateral area. The first scale row, adjacent corners of the ventrals, and lower half of the second scale row are suffused with dark pigment and appear dusky, but this area is often marked with black, setting off the paler area of the lateral stripe. The ventrals are dull, whitish, faintly suffused with yellowish, greenish or bluish, each ventral having a black dot usually of semicircular shape on its anterior margin near the anterolateral corner.   COMPARISON OF _T. S. PARIETALIS_ AND _T. S. FITCHI_  Like most widely ranging subspecies, _parietalis_ and _fitchi_ vary geographically and local populations often are noticeably different from typical material. It is possible that future revisors will recognize additional subspecies, but in the variant populations known to us the degree of differentiation is slight as compared, for instance, with that in the subspecies of _Thamnophis elegans_. Scalation is remarkably uniform in all the subspecies of _sirtalis_, but coastal and northern populations tend to have fewer ventrals and subcaudals than do their counterparts farther inland and farther south. In their geographic variation the ventrals and subcaudals follow clines, and do not in themselves warrant subspecific divisions. Variation occurs chiefly in the color and pattern including the intensity of dark pigmentation of the dorsolateral area, head, ventral surface and lower edge of the lateral stripe; in extent, position and shade of red or pale colored markings on the dorsolateral area; in presence and extent of reddish suffusion on the head, in the region of the lateral stripe, and on the ventral surface of the tail. Most of these same characters vary within the subspecies _fitchi_, but the range of variation is relatively minor. Fitch (_op. cit._:582-584) described typical populations and also described briefly several small series from British Columbia, Idaho, Oregon, and California which were not entirely typical. Most frequent variation was in heavy reddish suffusion on the sides of the head not found in typical _fitchi_. In each local population of this subspecies the characters seem to be remarkably uniform and stable.         *       *       *       *       *  Illustration: FIG. 2.

Of all of the species in the _pictipes_ group, _xanthosticta_ most closely resembles _debilis_. This species has a dull green dorsum, usually flecked with brown or black, and a creamy white venter. The flanks of _debilis_ are creamy white with small brown flecks, and the anterior and posterior surfaces of the thighs are bright yellow. _Hyla debilis_ has a dull tan canthal stripe and white spots on the upper lip; the webbing on the hand is slightly more extensive, and the discs are slightly larger, in _debilis_ than in _xanthosticta_.  The presence of the large yellow spots on the flanks and thighs in combination with the uniformly green dorsum and yellow venter immediately distinguishes _Hyla xanthosticta_ from all other known species of Middle American hylids.  _Remarks._--The only known specimen of _Hyla xanthosticta_ was perched at night on a leaf about one meter above the ground. The frog was found in humid upper montane forest characterized by large oaks supporting many bromeliads and heavy growths of mosses. Two other members of the _Hyla pictipes_ group--_pictipes_ and _rivularis_--were abundant along a stream in the oak forest.  The specific name is derived from the Greek _xanthos_ meaning yellow and the Greek _stiktos_ meaning spotted, and alludes to the diagnostic yellow spots on the flanks and thighs.

Flanks dark gray with white spots; groin, anterior and posterior surfaces of thighs, ventral surfaces of shanks, and inner edges of feet orange-tan; anal region dark brown, bordered above by white stripe; belly and chin creamy white, latter with grayish brown flecks.  Color (in life): dorsum yellowish tan with olive-brown markings by night and uniform pale yellowish tan by day; axilla, inner surface of elbow, groin, anterior and posterior surfaces of thighs, ventral surfaces of thighs and shanks, inner surfaces of feet, and dorsal surfaces of first three toes tomato red; flanks dark blue with yellow spots and reticulations. Throat, chest, and anterior part of belly creamy white; posterior part of belly orange, becoming red in extreme posterior region; throat flecked with brown; iris pale bronze with black reticulations; palpebral membrane clear above, yellowish tan below; nuptial excrescenses dark brown.  _Variation._--The discussion of variation is based on the type series plus 31 specimens (KU 101781-811) from the Río Claro near its junction with the Río Changena, at an elevation of 910 meters. Females are slightly larger than males, but do not differ significantly in proportions (Table 1). All specimens have the diagnostic red legs and blue flanks with yellow spots or mottling, but the dorsal pattern is highly variable. In most individuals the dark markings on the dorsum are a solid color, but in some the borders of the marks are dark, and the interior of each mark is nearly the same color as the rest of the dorsum. A triangular dark mark with the anterolateral corners on the eyelids is present in all specimens. In some individuals the posteriorly directed apex of this triangular mark is connected to the apex of another triangular mark on the back; in other individuals the marks are narrowly separated, whereas in a few specimens the marks are broadly connected. A dark blotch usually is present on the posterior end of the body. One specimen (KU 101771) has many small white spots on the dorsum. The white stripe above the anus is invariably present, and the transverse bars on the limbs are present in all specimens, although they are indistinct in some individuals. The pattern on the flanks varies from three or four large spots to many (30-44) small spots. All males have dark flecks or reticulations on the throat; in some individuals the chest and belly are heavily flecked. Although the amount of flecking is much less in most females, one individual is as heavily flecked on the throat and belly as any male.  The change in coloration in this frog is noteworthy. The following description of metachrosis in seven specimens from the Río Claro illustrates the change. At night the frogs were yellowish tan above with slightly darker dorsal markings. The axilla, groin, anterior and posterior surfaces of the thighs, ventral surfaces of the hind limbs, and webbing on the hands and feet were tomato red. By day, some individuals became creamy yellow, others ashy white, and others grayish tan. The flanks were dark blue with yellow spots.  _Comparisons._--The population of frogs described here closely resembles _Hyla pseudopuma_ Günther in the highlands of Costa Rica. Both have the same kind of, and variation in, dorsal markings; conical, pigmented supernumerary tubercles on the toes; bilobate vocal sac; and large prepollex bearing horny nuptial spinules. Although at present no evidence for intergradation exists, the population described here is considered to be a subspecies of _Hyla pseudopuma_.  The two subspecies exhibit few differences in size and proportions, except that the tympanum is larger in _pseudopuma_ (Table 1). _Hyla p. pseudopuma_ has dark brown or yellowish tan thighs and brown flanks with a few creamy white spots; the groin in some specimens is pale blue. The red color on the limbs characteristic of _infucata_ is lacking in _pseudopuma_, which also lacks the white stripe above the anus characteristic of _infucata_. The only noticeable morphological difference between the subspecies, except in the size of the tympanum, is the shape of the snout. In _infucata_ the snout is bluntly rounded in lateral profile and truncate in dorsal profile, whereas in _pseudopuma_ the snout is more acutely rounded in lateral profile and acuminate in dorsal profile (Fig. 1). This external difference is correlated with the nature of the underlying premaxillaries. In _infucata_ the premaxillaries lie in a transverse plane and"]]]
