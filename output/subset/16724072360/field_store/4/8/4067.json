As he turned through the pages, his fingers began to tremble. Donald had answered everything--and answered it correctly. Before Elvin had finished checking Donald's test, ten more students had left theirs on the desk and headed for the school library.  Within ten minutes Elvin was fighting a disorganizing bewilderment far worse than the rocket-hallucination. Every examination was completed, and none that he checked had as much as one mistake. Elvin wished he could believe that whole-sale cheating had taken place, but he knew that was impossible because of the precautions he always took.         *       *       *       *       *  All of the tenth graders were back from the library by that time. They had each brought two or more books. Elvin's body went rigid with anger when he saw what was currently passing among them for the skill of reading. They were methodically turning pages almost as quickly as they could move their hands from one side of the books to the other, all with the appearance of engrossed attention.  Elvin banged a ruler on his desk. One or two faces looked up. \"This has gone far enough!\" he cried. \"You asked for the privilege of free reading, but I do not intend you to make a farce of it.\" A hand went up. \"Yes, Marilyn?\"  \"But we are reading, Mr. Elvin. Honestly.\"  \"Oh, I see.\" His voice was thickly sarcastic. \"And what's the title of your book?\"  \"Toynbee's _Study of History_.\"  \"You've given up Grace Livingston Hill? Could you summarize Toynbee for us, Marilyn?\"  \"In another ten minutes, Mr. Elvin. I still have sixty pages to read.\"  Elvin turned savagely to another girl. \"Mabel Travis! What are you reading?\"  The buxom girl looked up languidly. For a split second her big eyes seemed focused on a distant prospective. \"Why--why this, Mr. Elvin.\" She held up her book so he could see the title.  \"_Hypnotism in Theory and Practice_,\" he snorted. And Mabel's I/Q was 71! \"You've outgrown the comics, Mabel?\"  \"In a sense, yes, Mr. Elvin.\"  Elvin was saved from further disorientation by the interruption of an office messenger with a special bulletin announcing a second period assembly. By the time he had read it, his anger was under control. He let the reading go on and spent the rest of the period plodding through the examinations. There was not an error in any of the papers. From the prospective of the day's events, Elvin later realized that, however personally unnerving, his own particular crisis had been a minor one.         *       *       *       *       *  The first full scale public disaster came during the assembly, when the entire student body--nearly one hundred and fifty youngsters--was gathered in the auditorium. The principal, as always, rose to lead them in the Alma Mater. He was a huge, hatchet-faced, white-haired man, the terror of evil-doer and faculty members alike. He had a tendency to give a solemn importance to trivial things and to overlook the great ones; and there was no mistaking the awed, almost religious fervor with which he sang the school song--which was, perhaps, only natural, since he had written it himself.  On that disastrous morning he suddenly burst into a dance as the student body barrelled into the first chorus. He snatched up the startled girls' counselor and improvised a little rumba. Slowly the students' voices fell silent as they watched. Under the sweating leadership of the music teacher, the school orchestra held the pace for another bar or two, until one of the players stood up and rendered a discordant hot lick on his trumpet.  A trio of caretakers carried the struggling principal off the platform and shouting teachers herded the students on to their next classes. Thirty minutes later the word-of-mouth information was carefully spread through the school that the principal had been taken to the hospital for observation and he was doing nicely. But by that time his fate seemed unimportant, for the girls' tenth grade gym teacher was having hysterics on the front lawn, convinced that all her students had turned into fish; and the boys' glee club teacher had abruptly announced that the nation was being invaded by Martians. He, too, had been carried off to the hospital in haste.  The rest of the faculty was badly shaken. When they met at lunch, they unanimously wanted the school closed for the rest of the day. But the principal had been too small a man to delegate any of his authority; as long as he was hospitalized, the teachers could do nothing.  After the ominous activity of the morning, however, most of the afternoon passed in relative order. True, the counselor gave pick-up tests to three tenth graders whose earlier I.Q. scores had been so low the validity had been questioned; and this time the same three outdid an Einstein. And the tenth grade math teacher was almost driven to distraction by a classroom discussion of the algebraic symbology equating matter and time--all of which was entirely over his head.  Nothing really happened until five minutes before the end of the school day, when Miss Gerkin knocked weakly on Gary Elvin's door. As soon as he saw her face, he gave his class free reading and joined her in the hall. Fearfully she showed him a yellow Bunsen burner, which glowed softly in the afternoon sunlight.  \"Do you know what it is, Gary?\"  \"It's one of those gas burners you have on the lab tables in--\"  \"The metal, I mean.\"  \"Looks like gold. Aren't these rather expensive for a high school classroom?\"  She sagged against the wall, running her trembling fingers over her thin lips. \"It's that tenth grade, Gary. I have them last period for general science. Bill Blake and the Schermerhorn twins got to fooling around with the electro-magnet. They rewired it somehow and added a few--well, frankly, I don't understand at all! But now when anything--metal, glass, granite--when anything is put in the magnetic field, it's changed to gold.\"  \"Transmutation of atomic structure? You know it can't be done!\"  \"Yes, I know it. But I saw it happen.\" She began to laugh, but checked herself quickly.  \"It's a trick. I know that bunch better than you do. It's time one of us had it out with them.\"         *       *       *       *       *  He strode along the hall toward the science room, Miss Gerkin following meekly behind him. \"I'm sure you're right, Gary, because the rest of the class hardly showed any interest in what the boys were doing. I actually asked Marilyn if she didn't want her necklace turned to gold, and she said she was too busy to bother. Imagine that, from a high school kid!\"  \"Busy doing what?\"  \"Working out the application of the Law of Degravitation, she said.\"  \"The Law of Degravitation? I never heard of it.\"  Miss Gerkin sniffed righteously. \"Neither have I, and I've taught science all my life.\"  Gary Elvin flung open the door of the science room. It was one minute before the end of the period. For a moment he looked in on a peacefully ideal classroom. Every student was at his bench working industriously. Then, row by row, they began to float upward toward the ceiling, each of them holding a tiny coil of thin wires twisted intricately around two pieces of metal and an electronic tube. The breeze from the open window gathered them languidly into a kind of huddle above the door.  The bell rang as Miss Gerkin began to scream. Elvin fought to hold on to his own sanity as he tried to help her, but a degree of her hysteria transferred itself to him. His mind became a patchwork of yawning blank spaces interspersed with uncoordinated episodes of reality.  He remembered hearing the bell and the rush of the class out of the room. He remembered the piercing screams of Miss Gerkin's terror echoing through the suddenly crowded halls. Beyond one of his black gulfs of no-memory, he was in the nurse's office helping to hold Miss Gerkin on the lounge while the school doctor administered a sedative.  Slowly the integrated pattern of his thinking returned when he was driving back toward the Schermerhorn ranch. It was late in the afternoon; the sun was setting redly beyond the ridge of mountains. As Elvin's fear receded, he was able to think with a kind of hazy clarity. He had seen a metal Bunsen burner that had been turned into gold; he had seen the crusty principal of the school break into a rumba, and three of his colleagues driven to hysteria; he had seen a tenth grade class floating unsupported in the air. All of it manifestly absurd and impossible.  But it had happened. Elvin could visualize only two plausible explanations: mass insanity or mass hypnosis. Hypnosis! A sluggish relay clicked in his mind. He remembered a book. One of the tenth graders had been reading it--_Hypnotism in Theory and Practice_.  Everything seemed clear after that. The tenth grade was an obstreperous bunch of unsocial adolescents. Somehow they had stumbled upon hypnotism and learned how to use it.  The time for an accounting had come. Because of where Elvin lived, he was admirably situated to break the Schermerhorn twins first; and they were, perhaps, the weakest members of the group. He would have them alone, without the support of their peers. It would be easy. After all, he was a mature adult; they were still children. Once he had a confession from them, it would only be a minor operation to clear up the whole mess.  When he reached the Schermerhorn ranch, dinner was on the table. He had no time to talk to the twins until afterward. Both David and Donald bolted the meal and rushed back to their workshop behind the garage. Their usual bad manners, Elvin realized, but what else could be expected?         *       *       *       *       *  Elvin finished a leisurely pipe in the living room, and then sauntered out to the boys' workshop. Surprisingly, the door was locked, the windows thickly curtained; they had never taken such precautions before. He knocked and, after a long wait, both"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32652"],["title","The Chameleon Man (#1)"],["body","and earnest. And for that reason I am going to try and help you.\"  \"Oh, gosh, thanks.\"  \"It's the least I can do,\" I said. \"But,\" I added sternly, \"you've got to put yourself completely in my hands. You mustn't question a thing I tell you to do. You see, this isn't going to be easy. I'll have to go about it in a rather roundabout way. And it may take a little while.\"  \"Oh, I don't care,\" the young man said happily. \"Anything you say is all right with me.\"  \"Fine.\" I glanced at my watch. \"We've got to go now. You follow me.\"  \"Sure, Mr.--\"  \"Flannigan,\" I said automatically.  \"But, Mr. Flannigan, that isn't the name you use on your column.\"  \"Naturally,\" I said. \"Very sharp of you to catch that. I might get you into Intelligence, even if only as a decoy. The name I use on the column is a pseudonym.\"  \"Oh!\"  \"Now come along with me.\"  I hurriedly got my young phantom out of the Soldier's Friend office before anyone could butt in and ruin everything. When we were safely ensconced in my own office, I waved the young man to a chair.  \"What's your name?\" I asked.  \"Horatio Heely,\" he replied.         *       *       *       *       *  I was becoming more enthused every minute. Looking at him, or _trying_ to look at him, seated in a chair, convinced me of his enormous potentialities. The chair was brown leather and, at first glance, the only thing that indicated that it was occupied, was a slight indentation in the seat and back of the chair. Horatio blended in perfectly with the deep brown of the chair and his face, which stuck up six or eight inches, was invisible against the grayness of the wall.  \"Maybe you could get me into the Coast Guard,\" he said.  I frowned. \"I hardly think so,\" I said. \"I know the Commander over there but I don't think I could swing it. Now, remember, you're going to leave everything in my hands.\"  The door of my office opened then and a slim, stunning blonde walked in, followed by a tall, gaunt, sober individual with a gloomy face and deep black eyes. He wore a turban with an imitation jewel set in the center folds, squarely over his high forehead.  \"Hah!\" this character cried. \"I suppose again you will tell me there is nothing for Mystiffio The Great, today.\"  \"Ix-nay,\" I snapped. \"Ut-shay up-yay!\"  The blonde looked at me, eyebrows raising.  \"What gives, mastermind?\"  This was the act I had in mind for Horatio. Mystiffio was a fair magician and his line of patter wasn't bad. The blonde, whose name was Alice, acted as a prop, and with her looks and Mystiffio's line they didn't do badly. But with Horatio in the act it would be tremendous.  He would blend perfectly into the stage background. Invisible, he could assist Mystiffio with the hocus-pocus and really produce some wonderful effects.  Alice was still looking at me as if I'd gone batty.  \"Just trust Uncle,\" I said hastily. \"I got a great new angle for your act.\"  \"You act as if you've been out in the sun too long,\" Alice murmured. \"But don't mind me.\"  With a weary sigh she sank into the brown leather chair. And one-tenth of a second later she leaped to her feet with a scream. She wheeled about, hand raised to slap, and then as she stared at the seemingly empty chair, an expression of wonderment stole over her pretty face.  [Illustration: \"Oh!\" she screamed, and leaped from the chair]  \"What--I could have sworn I--\" She turned to me pleadingly. \"What is it? Am I going screwy or is there somebody sitting in that chair?\"  \"Horatio,\" I said. \"Exert a little willpower and show yourself.\"  \"All right, Mr. Flannigan,\" Horatio's voice from the chair answered.  Mystiffio moved nervously toward the door.  \"I don't believe it,\" he said. His broad dark face was an unhappy mixture of fear and surprise.  \"Well, I'll be darned!\" Alice cried. She was staring at the chair, or rather at Horatio, who had suddenly become visible.         *       *       *       *       *  I made the introductions quickly.  \"Now that's enough, Horatio,\" I said. \"You can turn yourself off again. I don't want you to wear out.\"  \"Thanks,\" Horatio said gratefully. He smiled faintly at Alice. \"Pleased to have met you,\" he said. Then he vanished into the brown background of the chair.  \"Get me a drink!\" Mystiffio said. He grasped the edge of the desk and stared solemnly at the empty brown chair. \"Get me two drinks.\"  \"What is it?\" Alice demanded. \"How do you do it? Mirrors? Lighting? It's terrific.\"  \"It's completely on the level. Now here's the angle. I'm going to put this guy into your act. Wait'll the crowds get a load of Mystiffio's magic then. With Horatio in the background pulling the strings he'll make Thurston look like an amateur parlor entertainer.\"  Mystiffio turned to me stiffly.  \"What,\" he said frigidly, \"makes you think I need an invisible man to help me in my act? I am perfectly capable of astounding and amazing an audience by myself.\"  \"You're quoting your own press notices now,\" I said. \"I know; I wrote 'em.\"  \"And what makes you think I'm not as good as Thurston?\" Mystiffio asked in an injured voice.  \"Ah, temperament!\" I murmured. I turned to Alice. \"You work on him. You can see that Horatio will be a good thing, can't you? You don't want your act to die, do you?\"  \"Mr. Flannigan.\" It was Horatio. His voice sounded apologetic. \"I don't want to disturb you, but what has all this got to do with getting me into the army? You sound more like a booking agent than the Soldier's Friend.\"  Alice looked at me.  \"Heel,\" she said. \"What kind of line are you giving him?\"  \"Horatio,\" I said. \"I am disappointed. I expected a little trust from you. Didn't I tell you it might be a little while before I got things set? This angle I'm working now will put you practically into the army.\"  \"Yeah! How?\"  \"I'm going to line you up doing an act for the U. S. O. Does that show you my heart's in the right place?\"  \"There will be a short pause for cat-calls and boos,\" Alice murmured.  \"All right,\" Horatio said with a sigh. \"I'll go along with you.\"  \"Fine,\" I said. \"And just to get you used to army life I'm going to start paying you fifty bucks a month.\"  \"You great big generous man,\" Alice said and I think there was a twinge of sarcasm in her voice.  \"Now that's no way to talk,\" I said. \"I'm doing the lad a favor.\"  \"Yeah,\" she said. \"I'm sure you are. Just like a man picking up a dollar bill is doing the street cleaners a favor.\"  \"You don't understand my noble motives,\" I said, \"so I will not talk about them anymore. Tomorrow we start rehearsing the new act.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Well, sir, it was absolutely amazing the way Horatio picked that act up. With his dexterous, invisible help Mystiffio performed like the paragon of all prestidigitators. Alice added a jolt of high-voltage eye-appeal to the ensemble, by smiling sweetly and wearing a black satin bathing suit that had been designed by some patriotic person who believed in saving material to the point of cutting down on essentials.  I was sure, for the first time in my stretch in this loony business, that I had an option on a nice private little gold mine.  And I wasn't going to let anything upset my cartful of golden apples.  \"Okay,\" I said. They were rehearsing on the stage of an empty theater which was owned by a guy I'd done some favors for. \"You look pretty good, but don't let it go to your head. The act needs a lot of work. Keep at it. I'm going out to get a sandwich.\"  Alice put her hands on her hips and looked down at me.  \"Everything is fifty-fifty with you, isn't it?\" she said. \"We do the work, you get the money. Nice even split.\"  \"Careful, beautiful,\" I said. \"You'll die of your own poisons, if you don't look out.\" I waved to her and left. After I'd had a bite to eat, I went to see one of the biggest agents in the business, the guy who books all the acts into the Capitol in New York.  \"Look, Morry,\" I said, when his secretary had ushered me into his office, which was big enough to hold the World Series in, \"I've really got something terrific lined up.\"  Morry looked up at me and his little eyes were uninterested. He yawned and dusted a fleck of dust from the sleeve of his coat.  \"What is it?\" he asked.  \"It's a magician's act that--\"  Morry shook his head. \"Magicians are dead. Who wants to see rabbits pulled out of a hat?\"  \"This is different. This guy is good.\"  \"All right, he's good,\" Morry said. \"So what? We can't use him.\"  \"But you ought to at least see the act,\" I pleaded. \"It's got a honey of a girl, too.\"  \"Girl?\" Morry glanced up and there was a flicker of interest in his little eyes.  \"Yeah, a honey.\"  \"Well,\" Morry shrugged. \"I can't promise anything, but we do need an act to fill in a spot within a week or so. But whatever I get has to be good. I can't send bums to New York.\"  \"I know. I know,\" I said. My heart was hammering with hope. One break on the Stem and I'd be set. \"When will you catch the act? Tomorrow be all right?\"  Morry nodded.  I went back to the theatre walking about three feet from the ground. I felt I was in at last. It was a funny feeling I couldn't analyze, but I knew I was going to be in.         *       *       *       *       *  When I walked into the little office back stage I found Alice there talking to Horatio.  She was saying, \"There should be _something_ you could do for the Army, Horatio,\" as I walked into the office.  Horatio was standing by the desk, shoulders slumped. I had to look twice to make him out against the background of the desk and wall.  Alice shut up when she saw me.  \"Horatio and I were just talking,\" she said.  \"Yeah,\" I said. \"Now Horatio and I are going to do a little talking. Make yourself scarce.\"  Alice left and I turned to Horatio.  \"What kind of a line was she giving you?\" I snapped.  \"Why, gosh, Mr. Flannigan,\" Horatio stammered. \"She was just trying to help me. She's just as interested in getting me into the Army as you are. She's a wonderful girl, Mr. Flannigan.\"  There was something in his voice that brought me up"]]]
