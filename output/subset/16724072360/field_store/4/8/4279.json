It is an Atlantic      port, lying, I may say, in the track of the ocean steamers, and      by establishing it as the American telegraphic station, news      could be communicated to the whole American continent      forty-eight hours, _at least_, sooner than by any other route.      But how will this be accomplished? Just look at the map of      Newfoundland and Cape Breton. From St. John's to Cape Ray there      is no difficulty in establishing a line passing near Holy-Rood      along the neck of land connecting Trinity and Placentia Bays,      and thence in a direction due west to the Cape. You have then      about forty-one to forty-five miles of sea to St. Paul's      Island, with deep soundings of one hundred fathoms, so that the      electric cable will be perfectly safe from icebergs. Thence to      Cape North, in Cape Breton, is little more than twelve miles.      Thus it is not only practicable to bring America two days      nearer to Europe by this route, but should the telegraphic      communication between England and Ireland, sixty-two miles, be      realized, it presents not the least difficulty. Of course, we      in Newfoundland will have nothing to do with the erection,      working, and maintenance of the telegraph; but I suppose our      Government will give every facility to the company, either      English or American, who will undertake it, as it will be an      incalculable advantage to this country. I hope the day is not      far distant when St. John's will be the first link in the      electric chain which will unite the Old World and the New.                                J. T. M.       St. John's, November 8, 1850.  This suggestion came at the right moment, since it quickened, if it did not originate, the first attempt to link the island of Newfoundland with the mainland of America. For about the same time, the attention of Mr. Frederick N. Gisborne, a telegraph operator, was attracted to a similar project. Being a man of great quickness of mind, he instantly saw the importance of such a work, and took hold of it with enthusiasm. It might easily occur to him without suggestion from any source. He had had much experience in telegraphs, and was then engaged in constructing a telegraph line in Nova Scotia. Whether, therefore, the idea was first with him or with the bishop, is of little consequence. It might occur at the same time to two intelligent minds, and show the sagacity of both.  But having taken hold of this idea, Mr. Gisborne pursued it with indomitable resolution. As the labors of this gentleman were most important in the beginning of this work, it is a pleasure to recognize his untiring zeal and energy. In assurance of this we could have no higher authority than the following from the late Mr. E. M. Archibald, who was at the time Attorney-General of Newfoundland, and afterwards for many years British Consul at New York:       \"It was during the winter of 1849-50, that Mr. Gisborne, who      had been, as an engineer, engaged in extending the electric      telegraph through Lower Canada and New Brunswick to Halifax,      Nova Scotia, conceived the project of a telegraph to connect      St. John's, the most easterly port of America, with the main      continent. The importance of the geographical position of      Newfoundland, in the event of a telegraph ever being carried      across the Atlantic, was about the same time promulgated by Dr.      Mullock, the Roman Catholic Bishop of Newfoundland, in a St.      John's newspaper.       \"In the spring of the following year (1851), Mr. Gisborne      visited Newfoundland, appeared before the Legislature, then in      session, and explained the details of his plan, which was an      overland line from St. John's to Cape Ray, nearly four hundred      miles in length, and (the submarine cable between Dover and      Calais not having then been laid) a communication between Cape      Ray and Cape Breton by steamer and carrier-pigeons,      eventually, it was hoped, by a submarine cable across the Gulf      of St. Lawrence. The Legislature encouraged the project,      granted Â£500 sterling to enable Mr. Gisborne to make an      exploratory survey of the proposed line to Cape Ray, and passed      an act authorizing its construction, with certain privileges,      and the appointment of commissioners for the purpose of      carrying it out. Upon this, Mr. Gisborne, who was then the      chief officer of the Nova Scotia Telegraph Company, returned to      that province, resigned his situation, and devoted himself to      the project of the Newfoundland telegraph. Having organized a      local company for the purpose of constructing the first      telegraph line in the island, from St. John's to Carbonear, a      distance of sixty miles, he, on the fourth of September, set      out upon the arduous expedition of a survey of the proposed      line to Cape Ray, which occupied upward of three months, during      which time himself and his party suffered severe privations,      and narrowly escaped starvation, having to traverse the most      rugged and hitherto unexplored part of the island.[A] On his      return, having reported to the Legislature favorably of the      project, and furnished estimates of the cost, he determined to      proceed to New York, to obtain assistance to carry it out....      Mr. Gisborne returned to St. John's in the spring of 1852,      when, at his instance, an act, incorporating himself (his being      the only name mentioned in it) and such others as might become      shareholders in a company, to be called the Newfoundland      Electric Telegraph Company, was passed, granting an exclusive      right to erect telegraphs in Newfoundland for thirty years,      with certain concessions of land, by way of encouragement, to      be granted upon the completion of the telegraph from St. John's      to Cape Ray. Mr. Gisborne then returned to New York, where he      organized, under this charter, a company, of which Mr. Tebbets      and Mr. Holbrook[B] were prominent members, made his financial      arrangements with them, and proceeded to England to contract      for the cable from Cape Ray to Prince Edward Island, and from      thence to the mainland. Returning in the autumn, he proceeded      in a small steamer, in November of that year, 1852, to stretch      the first submarine cable, of any length, in America, across      the Northumberland Strait from Prince Edward Island to New      Brunswick, which cable, however, was shortly afterward broken,      and a new one was subsequently laid down by the New York,      Newfoundland, and London Telegraph Company. In the spring of      the following year, 1853, Mr. Gisborne set vigorously to work      to complete his favorite project of the line (which he intended      should be chiefly underground) from St. John's to Cape Ray. He      had constructed some thirty or forty miles of road, and was      proceeding with every prospect of success, when, most      unexpectedly, those of the company who were to furnish the      needful funds dishonored his bills, and brought his operations      to a sudden termination. He and the creditors of the company      were for several months buoyed up with promises of forthcoming      means from his New York allies, which promises were finally      entirely unfulfilled; and Gisborne, being the only ostensible      party, was sued and prosecuted on all sides, stripped of his      whole property, and himself arrested to answer the claims of      the creditors of the company. He cheerfully and honorably gave      up every thing he possessed, and did his utmost to relieve the      severe distress in which the poor laborers on the line had been      involved.\"  This is a testimony most honorable to the engineer who first led the way through a pathless wilderness. But this Newfoundland scheme is not to be confounded with that of the Atlantic Telegraph, which did not come into existence until a year or two later. The latter was not at all included in the former. Indeed, Mr. Gisborne himself says, in a letter referring to his original project: \"My plans were to run a subterranean line from Cape Race to Cape Ray, fly carrier-pigeons and run boats across the Straits of Northumberland to Cape Breton, and thence by overland lines convey the news to New York.\" He adds however: \"Meanwhile Mr. Brett's experimental cable between Dover and Calais having proved successful, I set forth in my report, [which appeared a year after his first proposal], that 'carrier-pigeons and boats would be required only until such time as the experiments then making in England with submarine cables should warrant a similar attempt between Cape Ray and Cape Breton.'\" But nowhere in his report does he allude to the possibility of ever spanning the mighty gulf of the Atlantic.  But several years after, when the temporary success of the Atlantic Telegraph gave a name to everybody connected with it, he or his friends seemed not unwilling to have it supposed that this was embraced in the original scheme. When asked why he did not publish his large design to the world, he answered: \"Because I was looked upon as a wild visionary by my friends, and pronounced a fool by my relatives for resigning a lucrative government appointment in favor of such a laborious speculation as the Newfoundland connection. Now had I coupled it at that time with an Atlantic line, all confidence in the prior undertaking would have been destroyed, and my object defeated.\" This may have been a reason for not announcing such a project to the public, but not for withholding it from his friends. A man can hardly lay claim to that which he holds in such absolute reserve.  However, whether he ever entertained the _idea_ of such a project, is not a matter of the slightest consequence to the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34781"],["title","An Australian Bird Book: A Pocket Book for Field Use (#1)"],["body"," that have no excellence in song; but it is also true that, in this favored land, there is a far greater proportion than usual of fine song-birds.  The first generations of Australians were not taught to love Australian things. We \"learned from our wistful mothers to call Old England home.\" Our school books and our story books were made in Great Britain for British boys and girls, and naturally they stressed what was of interest to these boys and girls. We read much about the beauty of the songs of the Lark, and the Thrush, and the Nightingale, but we found no printed authority for the belief that our Magpie is one of the great song-birds of the world; we read of the wonderful powers of the American Mocking-Bird, and did not know that our beautiful Lyrebird is a finer mimic; we learned by heart Barry Cornwall's well-known poem on \"The Storm Petrel,\" and did not know that one of the most interesting of Petrel rookeries is near the harbor gate of Melbourne; and I remember well a lesson I heard as a boy on the migration of birds, in which the teacher took all of his illustrations from his boyish experiences in the South of England, and gave us no idea that the annual migration of our familiar Australian birds to far-off Siberia is a much more wonderful thing.  But all this is being rapidly changed. In the elementary schools Nature-study is steadily improving, and children are being given an eye for, and an interest in, the world of Nature around them. Our school books are now written from the Australian standpoint, and more use can, therefore, be made of the child's everyday experience. Field Naturalists' clubs are doing much to extend the area of specialized Nature-study, and their members are giving valuable assistance to the schools by taking part in the programs for Arbor Day, Bird Day, and the like. The growing interest in the Australian fauna and flora is further evidenced by the frequent reservations by Government of desirable areas as national parks and sanctuaries for the preservation of Australian types. Last, but not least, is the production by capable Nature students of special books on some form of Nature-study, such as this Bird Book by Mr. Leach.  To our parents, Australia was a stranger land, and they were sojourners here. Though they lived here, they did not get close enough to it to appreciate fully its natural beauty and its charm. To us, and especially to our children, children of Australian-born parents, children whose bones were made in Australia, the place is home. To them Nature makes a direct appeal, strengthened by those most powerful of all associations, those gathered in childhood, when the foundations of their minds were laid. The English boy, out on a breezy down, may feel an exaltation of soul on hearing a Skylark raining down a flood of delicious melody from far up at heaven's gate, but his joy is no whit greater than his who hears, in the dewy freshness of the early morning, the carol of the Magpie ringing out over an Australian plain. To those who live in countries where the winter is long and bitter, any sign that the genial time of flowers is at hand is very welcome. All over the countryside the first call of the Cuckoo, spring's harbinger, arouses the keenest delight in expectant listeners. This delight is, however, more than mere delight in the bird's song. And to those brought up with it year by year there comes a time when the call of the Cuckoo stirs something deep down below the surface of ordinary emotion. It is the resultant of multitudes of childhood experiences and of associations with song and story. I first heard the Cuckoo in Epping Forest one delicious May evening four years ago. It charmed me, but my delight was almost wholly that of association. All the English poetry I knew was at the back of the bird's song. Here in Australia we have no sharply-defined seasons, yet I find myself every spring listening eagerly for the first plaintive, insistent call of the Pallid Cuckoo. For me his song marks another milestone passed.  Marcus Clarke wrote of the Laughing Jackasses as bursting into \"horrible peals of semi-human laughter.\" But then Marcus Clarke was English-bred, and did not come to Australia till he was eighteen years old. It makes all the difference in our appreciation of bird or tree or flower to have known it as a boy. I venture to think no latter-day Australian who has grown up with our Kookaburra can have any but the kindliest of feelings for this feathered comedian. For myself, I confess that I find his laughter infectious, and innumerable times he has provoked me into an outburst as hearty and as mirthful as his own. More than half of our pleasure is due to the fact that the bird is    \"The same that in my schoolboy days I listened to.\"  and to such a one we can say--    \"I can listen to thee yet,     Can lie upon the plain   And listen, till I do beget     That golden time again.\"  It is time that we Australians fought against the generally received opinion that the dominant note of our scenery is weird melancholy. This is the note sounded mainly by those who were bred elsewhere, who came to us with other associations and other traditions, and sojourned among us. It will not be the opinion of the native-born when they find appropriate speech.    \"Whence doth the mournful keynote start?   From the pure depths of Nature's heart?   Or, from the heart of him who sings,   And deems his hand upon the strings,       Is Nature's own?\"  This little book should do much to popularize bird-study and to spread a knowledge of our common birds among our people. I hope devoutly that an effort will be made to give them suitable names. We should give them names a poet or a child can use. A Chaucer poring lovingly over his favorite flower, the daisy, could call it by a name which is itself full of poetry. Even the unimaginative clown, Nick Bottom, could sing of    \"The Ouzel Cock, so black of hue,     With orange-tawny bill,   The Throstle with his note so true,     The Wren with little quill,   The Finch, the Sparrow, and the Lark,     The plain-song Cuckoo gray.\"  And a Burns can invoke the Throstle in lines as musical as the song of the bird itself--\"And thou mellow mavis, that hails the night-fa'.\"  But how shall an Australian bard sing of \"The Red-rumped Acanthiza,\" or of that delightful songster, \"The Rufous-breasted Thickhead\"? Australian Nature-poetry will be handicapped until our children give names like \"Bobolink,\" and \"Chickadee,\" and \"Whip-poor-will,\" and \"Jacky Winter,\" to our birds.  \"Oriel,\" in the _Argus_, some time ago, showed how hard it is to write of love's young dream in Australian verse.    \"Sweetheart, we watched the evening sky grow pale,     And drowsy sweetness stole away our senses,   While ran adown the swamp the Pectoral Rail,     The shy Hypotaenidia philippinensis.    \"How sweet a thing is love! Sweet as the rose,     Fragrant as flowers, fair as the sunlight beaming!   Only the Sooty Oyster-Catcher knows     How sweet to us, as there we lingered dreaming.    \"Dear, all the secret's ours. The Sharp-tailed Stint     Spied, but he will not tell--though you and I   Paid Cupid's debts from Love's own golden mint,     While Yellow-Bellied Shrike-Tits fluttered nigh.    \"The Honey-eaters heard; the Fuscous--yea,     The Warty-faced, the Lunulated, too;   But this kind feathered tribe will never say     What words you said to me, or I to you.    \"The golden bloom was glorious in the furze,     And gentle twittering came from out the copses;   It was the Carinated Flycatchers,     Or else the black Monarcha melanopsis.    \"That day our troth we plighted--blissful hour,     Beginning of a joy a whole life long!   And while the wide world seemed to be in flower,     The Chestnut-rumped Ground-Wren burst forth in song.\"  It surely would not be amiss if the Bird Observers' Clubs throughout Australia, and the Royal Australasian Ornithologists' Union, enlisted the aid of the State Education Departments, and endeavored to find out what names the children use for the birds of their district. Executive committees upon bird names are good; but a good name is not evoked by arguments in committee. It ofttimes comes from the happy inspiration of some child who loves the bird. At present the names given by classifiers are often an offence. A few evenings ago I was charmed with an unaccustomed song coming from out a big pittosporum tree in my garden at Kew. I took careful note of the little warbler, and then consulted Mr. Leach's _Descriptive List_. Judge of my satisfaction when I found that my little friend was \"The Striated Field Wren or Stink Bird\"!  The Australian boy is responding splendidly to the Nature-study movement. Bird observers tell me that shy native birds, formerly unknown near the haunts of men, are making their appearance, feeling safer now from molestation. Nest hunting for the sake of egg spoliation is happily becoming rarer, although children are developing keener eyes for nests. To-day every country school has its nests under loving observation for the purposes of bird-study and of bird-protection. Walt Whitman might have been describing many a Victorian school boy when he wrote--    \"And every day the he-bird, to and fro, near at hand,   And every day the she-bird, crouched on her nest, silent, with bright eyes,   And every day, I, a curious boy, never too close, never disturbing them,   Cautiously peering, absorbing, translating.\"  This loving study must bear good fruit. If we believe the scientific men, Australia is, _par excellence_, the land of birds, song-birds, plumage-birds, and birds of wonderful interest, such as the Satin Bower Bird. The collection of Australian birds in our National Museum at Melbourne is certainly one of the finest sights of the city, and it should be studied by all who wish to know how favored this continent is in bird distribution. But we must get to know and to love our feathered friends. Mr. Leach in his"]]]
