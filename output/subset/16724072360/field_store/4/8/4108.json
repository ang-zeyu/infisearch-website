They are vertical, simple, equal, respectively, or more frequently alternating with shorter gills. They are often evanescent and putrescent, sometimes liquefying altogether. Their color is usually different from the upper surface of the cap, not always similar to that of the spores borne upon them, at least in youth; with age, however, they usually assume the color of the mature spore. The change of color of the gills according to the age of the plant is very important in the study of the Agaricini; it accounts for the white gills of certain species in youth, the pink in maturity, and the brown when aged.  The end of the gill nearest the stalk of the plant is termed the posterior extremity; the opposite end, the anterior extremity. In most of the Agaricini the gills are unequal. Some extend from the margin to about half the space between it and the stem; others are still shorter.   THE VOLVA.  The volva is a membrane which envelops the entire plant in embryo, giving it the appearance of an egg. It originates at the base of the mushroom and furnishes it, during its foetal life, with the means of support and nourishment. Its texture is so delicate that it generally disappears, leaving very little trace of its existence on the adult plant. In many of the volvate species this organ exists only so long as they are under ground, and some mycologists restrict the term \"volvati\" to such only as retain it afterwards. As the young plant expands it breaks through the top of this volva or wrapper, and, emerging, carries with it patches of the membrane on the upper surface of the cap. These are more or less prominent, numerous, and thick, sometimes irregularly disposed, sometimes regularly in the form of plates, warts, etc. At the base of the stem of the mushroom the remains of the volva are seen in the form of a sort of wrapper. This is more or less ample, thick, and ascending. It is called _free_ when it is loose or easily detached from the stem, and _congenital_ when it cannot be separated from it without laceration. In some species it is distinctly membranous, and in others floccose, and friable in character, sometimes appearing in ridges as a mere border, at others broken up into scales, and, as the plant matures, wholly disappearing. The volva is a feature of great importance in the study of the Agaricini, of the subgenera Amanita, Volvaria, etc.   THE MUSHROOM VEIL.  The veil is not a constant feature in the Agaricini, at least it is not always visible. When present it consists of a membrane which extends from the margin of the cap to the stem, veiling or protecting the gills. This membrane, called the cortina, has given its name to a numerous and important class of mushrooms (the _Cortinarias_). It is generally white, soft, slightly spongy, cottony, at times fibrillose or even slightly fibrous, again in texture comparable to the spider's web, and may be even powdery or glutinous. It exists intact only in the youth of the plant. It is not visible in the developing mushroom, at least while the cap is closely pressed against the stem, but as the cap expands the membrane extends and finally breaks, leaving in some species its remnants upon the margin of the cap and upon the stem in the usual form of a ring or a mere zone. When the stem is not ringed the veil rises high upon the stalk, stretches across to meet the edges of the cap, and is afterwards reflected back over its whole surface.   MUSHROOM SPORES AND MYCELIUM.  The spore is the reproductive organ of the mushroom. It differs from the seed of the flowering plant in being destitute of an apparent embryo. A seed contains a plantlet which develops as such. A spore is a minute cell containing a nucleus or living germ, the reproductive cell germ called by some authors the germinating granule. This in turn throws out a highly elongated process consisting of a series of thread-like cells branching longitudinally and laterally, at length bifurcating and anastomosing the mass, forming the vegetative process known as mycelium or mushroom spawn.  On this mycelium, at intervals, appear knob-like bodies, called tubercles, from which the mushrooms spring and from which they derive their nourishment. See Fig. 5, Plate A.  Where the conditions have been unfavorable this mycelium has been known to grow for years without bearing fruit.  Mushroom spores are very variable in size, shape, and color, but are generally constant at maturity in the same genus. Their shape, almost always spherical in the young plant, becomes ovate, ellipsoidal, fusiform, reniform, smooth, stellate, sometimes tuberculate, or remains globose. This feature, varying thus with the age of the plant, should be studied in the mature plant.   MYCELIUM.  De Leveille has thus defined mycelium: \"Filaments at first simple, then more or less complicated, resulting from the vegetation of the spores and serving as roots to the mushroom.\"  The mycelium of mushrooms or the mushroom spawn is usually white, but is also found yellow, and even red. It is distinguished by some writers as nematoid, fibrous, hymenoid, scleroid or tuberculous, and malacoid. The nematoid mycelium is the most common. Creeping along on the surface of the earth, penetrating it to a greater or less depth, developing in manure among the débris of leaves or decayed branches, always protected from the light, it presently consists of very delicate filamentous cells more or less loosely interwoven, divided, anastomosing in every direction and often of considerable extent.  Its presence is sometimes difficult to detect without the use of the microscope, either on account of its delicacy or because of its being intermingled with the organic tissues in which it has developed.  Sometimes mycelium unites in bundles more or less thick and branched. This has been called the fibrous mycelium. Where the filaments intercross closely, are felted, and inclined to form a membrane, it is hymenoid mycelium. Where the filaments are so small and close that they form very compact bodies, constituting those solid irregular products called sclerotium, it is scleroid or tuberculous mycelium. With malacoid mycelium we have nothing to do in this paper. It is a soft, pulpy, fleshy mycelium.  Systematists have divided the Agaricini into groups according to the color of their spores. These groups are defined as follows by various authors:      According to--      Elias Fries, 5 groups: _Leucosporus_, white; _Hyporhodius_, pink;     _Cortinaria_, ochraceous; _Derminus_, rust; _Pratella_, purplish     black.      Rev. J. M. Berkeley, 5 groups: Very frequently pure white, but     presenting also pink, various tints of brown, from yellowish and     rufous to dark bister, purple-black, and finally black;     _Leucospori_, white; _Hyporhodii_, salmon; _Dermini_, ferruginous;     _Pratellæ_, brown; _Coprinarius_, black.      Dr. Badham, 6 groups: Pure white or a yellow tinge on drying; brown;     yellow; pink; purple; purple-black; some pass successively from pink     to purple and from purple to purple-black.      Mrs. Hussey, 11 shades: White; rose; pale ocher; olivaceous-ocher;     reddish-ocher; ochraceous; yellowish olive-green; dull brown;     scarcely ferruginous; snuff-color; very dark brown.      Hogg & Johnson, 5 groups: _Leucosporei_, white; _Hyporhodii_,     salmon; _Dermini_, rusty; _Pratellæ_, purplish-brown; _Coprinarii_,     black.      C. Gillet, 7 shades: White; pink; ochraceous; yellow; ferruginous;     black or purplish black; round, ovate, elongated, or fusiform,     smooth, tuberculate or irregular, simple or composite, transparent     or nebulous, etc.      Jules Bel, 5 groups: White; pink; red; brown; black.      Dr. Gautier, 5 shades: White; pink; brown; purplish-brown; black.      Constantin & Dufour, 5 groups: White; pink; ochraceous;     brownish-purple; black.      J. P. Barla, 7 groups: _Leucosporii_, white; _Hyporhodii_, pink;     _Cortinariæ_, ochraceous; _Dermini_, rust; _Pratellæ_,     purplish-black; _Coprinarii_, blackish; _Coprini_ and _Gomphi_,     dense black.      L. Boyer, 5 groups, 11 shades: White to cream yellow; pale pink to     ochraceous yellow; bay or red brown to brown or blackish bister;     rust color, cinnamon or light yellow.      W. D. Hay, 5 groups: White; pink; brown; purple; black.      C. H. Peck, 5 groups: _Leucosporii_, white; _Hyporhodii_, salmon;     _Dermini_, rust; _Pratellæ_, brown; _Coprinarii_, black.      Saccardo divides the Agaricini into four sections, according to the     color of their spores, as follows: Spores brown, purplish brown or     black, _Melanosporæ_; spores ochraceous or rusty ochraceous,     _Ochrosporæ_; spores rosy or pinkish, _Rhodosporæ_; spores white,     whitish or pale yellow, _Leucosporæ_.      Dr. M. C. Cooke, 5 groups: _Leucospori_, white or yellowish;     _Hyporhodii_, rosy or salmon color; _Dermini_, brown, sometimes     reddish or yellowish brown; _Pratellæ_, purple, sometimes brownish     purple, dark purple, or dark brown; _Coprinarii_, black or nearly     so.  These shades are somewhat different from the colors of the mushrooms' gills, so that, when it is of importance to determine exactly the color of the spore in the identification of a species, we may without recourse to the microscope cut off the stem of an adult plant on a level with the gills and place the under surface of the cap upon a leaf of white paper if a dark-spored species, and upon a sheet of black paper if the spores are light. At the expiration of a few hours we will find, on lifting the cap, a bed of the shed spores which will represent their exact shade.

The placard caught the eyes of an elderly man, and the little girls could scarcely conceal their delight as he paused before them.  \"Well, my little ladies, what have we here?\" he asked kindly. \"For the soldiers, eh? Who put you up to this?\"  \"No one, sir,\" answered Jeanne as the other girls shrank back abashed. \"We are doing it ourselves to help buy things for the boys.\"  \"But who made the articles?\" queried the old gentleman. \"I am a poor judge of such things, but these handkerchiefs seem to be very neatly done. They are not of your making, I presume.\"  \"Indeed they are,\" answered the girl earnestly. \"We have done all the sewing, and made the candies. The toys were our own, given to us by our parents, but we would rather have the money to give to the soldiers, so they are for sale too. We girls have made everything but the toys and the books.\"  \"But why,\" persisted he good-naturedly. \"The government provides for its soldiers, and there are women and men to do what the government doesn't do. Why should you interest yourselves in such things? The war doesn't concern you!\"  \"Whatever concerns our country concerns us,\" answered Jeanne with dignity. \"We are only girls, sir, and cannot do much, but what we can do to help those who are fighting for us we will do.\"  \"Nobly said, my little maid. I was anxious to see if this was a mere whim of the moment, or if you really were actuated by patriotic motives. You have taught me that girls can feel for their country as well as grown people. How much are those handkerchiefs?\"  \"A dollar a dozen, sir.\"  \"H'm'm!\" mused the old gentleman drawing forth a well filled pocketbook. \"Too cheap by far. Give me a couple of dozen.\"  Jeanne obeyed with alacrity and carefully wrapped the handkerchiefs in tissue paper. \"I can't change this bill, sir,\" she said as the old gentleman gave her a twenty dollar note.  \"I don't want you to, my little girl,\" returned he kindly. \"Take it for the cause.\"  \"Oh,\" cried Jeanne her eyes filling with glad tears. \"How good you are! How good you are!\"  \"Nonsense! It's a pity if I cannot give a little money when you girls have given so much time and work. Good-day, my little patriots. Success to you in your undertaking. You may see me again.\"  \"Good-day, sir,\" cried the girls together. \"And thank you ever so much.\"  \"Oh, girls,\" gasped Jeanne delightedly. \"Isn't it fine? Twenty dollars! I didn't think we'd make more than that altogether.\"  \"Here come more customers, Jeanne,\" cried Nellie excitedly. \"Oh, but I believe that we are going to have luck!\"  It was but the beginning. There was little leisure for the girls after that. Their evident zeal and earnestness impressed the passers-by whose hearts were already aglow with sympathy for the soldiers, and bills and shinplasters poured in upon the little merchants until at dusk not an article remained upon the steps. Then, tired but happy, they assembled in Mrs. Vance's parlor to count the proceeds.  \"Two hundred dollars!\" exclaimed Mr. Vance as the girls announced the result in excited tones. \"Why, girls, this is wonderful! The government would better turn over its finances into your hands.\"  \"You blessed dears,\" cried Mrs. Vance, \"it will do so much good! You don't know how much that will buy, but you shall go with the committee and see for yourselves.\"  \"We have done well,\" said Jeanne in congratulatory tones.  \"I don't believe that grown people could do any better,\" and Nellie Drew gave her head a proud toss.  \"There's a little lame boy asking to see Miss Jeanne, ma'am,\" announced a servant entering at this moment. \"Shall I show him up?\"  \"Yes, Susan. Who is it, Jeanne?\"  \"It must be Eddie Farrell. He lives down on Fourth Avenue. His mother washes for Nellie's mother, and they are awfully poor. He came by while we were fixing our things and we told him all about what we were doing and why we were doing it. How do you do, Eddie?\" as the door opened to admit the visitor.  A little fellow not over ten years old, with great blue eyes that were just now alight with eagerness, paused abruptly as he caught sight of Mr. and Mrs. Vance. He made a pathetic looking figure as he stood in the doorway. He was deplorably lame and leaned on a pair of rude crutches for support, balancing in some way known only to himself, a long bundle under his arm.  \"Have a chair, my boy,\" said Mr. Vance, kindly noticing his embarrassment. \"Did you wish to see Jeanne?\"  \"Yes, sir.\" The boy sat down and then opened his bundle disclosing a pair of well made crutches. \"The girls told me what they wuz doing fer the sogers and I've been thinking ever since what I could do. I didn't have no money ner nuffin' ter give 'cepting these crutches. I thought mebbe they'd do some pore feller some good what 'ud have his leg cut off.\"  \"But where did you get them?\" queried Mr. Vance.  \"They wuz mine, sir. Bill, a sailor man I knows, he spliced on some pieces to make 'em longer, and there they are, sir.\"  \"My lad,\" and Mr. Vance laid his hand softly on the boy's head, \"it is a great deal for you to give. You need them yourself.\"  \"I'll get along all right,\" said the boy eagerly. \"'Deed I will, Mr. Vance. See, Bill he rigged me up a pair that'll do me all right, an' I'd like ter help some pore feller.\"  Mr. Vance gazed pityingly at the rude substitutes which the boy held up, and then looked at the crutches so deftly lengthened. His voice was husky as he spoke:  \"It is a great gift. More than you should give.\"  \"It ain't nuthin',\" answered the lad. \"I feel fer the feller that is born with two good legs an' then loses one of them.\"  Mr. Vance nodded understandingly. Mrs. Vance's eyes were full to overflowing as she stroked the boy's hair gently.  \"We'll write a little note and tie on the crutches,\" she said. \"Then whoever gets them will know who gave them.\"  \"That will be fine,\" cried the lad gleefully. \"I'm so glad you'll take them. I wuz afraid mebbe it wouldn't be enough ter give.\"  \"It is more than we have done,\" said Jeanne as soon as she was able to speak.  \"Then good-bye,\" and Eddie arose. \"I'll run back and tell mother.\" He nodded to them and left the room, his face aglow with satisfaction.  \"We haven't done anything,\" said Jeanne emphatically. \"We didn't give a thing we could not do without. Oh, I feel so mean!\"  She looked at the girls tearfully, then drew a slender chain from her throat, and detached the gold piece which was suspended from it. \"There!\" she said, putting it with the bills on the table. \"Uncle Joe gave me that before he went to the army. After he was killed at Shiloh I thought I would never part with it, but I am going to let it go for the soldiers too.\"  \"It is good for us,\" said Nellie wiping her eyes. \"We were awfully puffed up over this fair. I was beginning to think that we had done something great.\"  Mr. Vance laughed.  \"You need not feel so bad, girls,\" he said. \"If it had not been for you that poor little fellow wouldn't have thought of giving his crutches.\"  \"I wish he had some though,\" remarked Jeanne wistfully.  \"Make your mind easy on that score, my dear, I'm going to look after that boy.\"  \"And meantime you girls can go with me to the Association to carry the money and the crutches, and we'll tell the ladies all about it,\" said Mrs. Vance.     CHAPTER II  A GREAT UNDERTAKING   For a time affairs went on in their usual way, and the girls contented themselves with hemming towels and handkerchiefs and making socks. That is, all the girls save Jeanne Vance. With her the desire was stronger than ever to do something more than she had done.  \"What makes you so thoughtful, Jeanne?\" asked her father one evening looking up from his paper. \"You are as still as a mouse. Come, and tell me all about it.\"  \"It's the country,\" said Jeanne settling herself comfortably on his lap and laying her head on his shoulder. \"I was thinking about our army and how much there was to be done for it.\"  \"I am afraid that you think too much about the war,\" observed her father soberly. \"It is not good for you.\"  \"I can't help it, father. Dick's letters make me, and the work that you and mother do keeps it always before me. I am the only one who doesn't do much.\"  \"I am sure that you carried that fair through admirably, and have made a number of articles for the soldiers. Best of all you are looking after yourself so well that your mother and I can devote our whole time to the cause. And that is a great deal, my little girl.\"  \"But I should like to do something else,\" persisted Jeanne. \"It doesn't seem as if I were helping one bit.\"  \"Very few of us can see the result of our labors. If you were in the army it would be the same way. A soldier often has to obey orders for which he can see no reason, but his disobedience might cause the loss of a battle. We are all of us part of a great whole striving for the same end. If each one does his part all will be well. If every little girl in the country would do as much as you are doing, the amount of work accomplished would be startling.\"  \"If I were a boy I could do more,\" sighed Jeanne. \"It is very hard to be 'only a girl,' father.\"  Mr. Vance laughed.  \"But since you are one, Jeanne, try to be contented. I am very thankful for my daughter if she is 'only a girl.'\"  \"You are troubled too,\" observed Jeanne presently, noting a look of anxiety on her father's face.  \"Yes, child; I am.\"  \"Could you tell me about it, father? Perhaps it would help you. I feel ever so much better since I have talked with you.\"  \"I am afraid that you cannot help me, child. If only Dick were here,\" and he sighed.  \"Could I if I were a boy?\" asked the girl, wistfully.  \"Yes,\" replied Mr. Vance unthinkingly. \"If you were a boy, Jeanne, with the same amount of brightness and common sense that you now have, I would be strongly tempted to send you forth on some"]]]
