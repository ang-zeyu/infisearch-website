I will consider your case later.\"  O'Malley got to his feet. He handed the pie plate to the embarrassed corporal. \"Thank you, sor,\" he drawled as he made off.  The colonel snorted and went back to his lecture. O'Malley headed for the mess hall. The half pie had whetted his appetite. Locating a comfortable place near a window he ordered a big dinner, with a whole blueberry pie for dessert. In a leisurely manner he began devouring his meal.  He had spent most of an hour enjoying his dinner and was ready to eat his pie, when the fliers began drifting in from the conference. Several of them headed toward O'Malley's table. O'Malley was the most famous pilot in their outfit. The stories about him amounted almost to legend. The boys admired his disregard for military usage. All of them had been working according to the colonel's carefully explained plans for months and knew them better than the colonel did. They had been bored by the long session but had not had the nerve to show their feelings.  But none of them reached O'Malley. Colonel Benson came in and strode over to O'Malley's table.  Nodding to O'Malley, he said, \"Mind if I join you?\" His voice did not sound so stiff outside his office.  \"Sure, an' I'm glad to have you,\" O'Malley said, but there was a gleam of suspicion in his eye.  Colonel Benson seated himself. He watched O'Malley attack the pie. His interest amounted to fascination and he did not speak until O'Malley had finished three fourths of the pie. He ordered coffee and leaned back.  \"I have heard a great deal about you, Lieutenant,\" he began.  O'Malley did not think this remark called for an answer, so he went on eating his pie.  \"I know you are an excellent pilot, though I understand you are a bit reckless.\" There was a gleam that might have been humor in the colonel's eye.  O'Malley leaned back. He pushed the pie plate away from him and uttered a contented sigh.  \"However, I'm afraid you are not the type of man I want working beside me. With your permission, I will find you another assignment.\" The colonel watched O'Malley as he spoke.  \"What sort o' work?\" O'Malley asked.  \"Flying a fighter plane, of course.\" Colonel Benson smiled.  \"'Twill suit me foine,\" O'Malley said. \"I'm not likin' the idea o' bein' a brass hat.\"  \"I don't think you would make a very good one,\" the colonel said. \"There will be no further mention of your pie-eating exhibition of this afternoon. You will report to operations for your new assignment.\"  \"Thank you, sor.\"  The colonel drank his coffee and arose. O'Malley got to his feet and managed a snappy salute. The colonel moved off and the boys closed in to find out what had happened.     CHAPTER II  SPECIAL TASK   The sympathy of the boys in the officers' mess was wasted upon O'Malley. He was not impressed by the advanced rating he had missed, nor was he jealous of the new and shining bars and oak leaves his pals were wearing. He had checked in and been assigned flight leader of a flight of three planes whose task was special work. All that interested O'Malley was that he was due to head out over the Mediterranean Sea with the nose of his Lightning pointed toward Italy.  \"Sure, an' I'll have Benito captured by the time you birds go into action,\" he told the gang.  O'Malley's exact duties were not very clear, nor was his crew a reality. No men had been assigned to him and he had no flight orders, but he had the assurance of the captain at operations that he would be on his way in a short time. If O'Malley had any suspicions as to the sort of work Colonel Benson had laid out for him, he did not show them. He was in exceptional good humor.  When he was called in by Captain Marks at headquarters, he dashed to the operations room as fast as he could. The captain smiled as O'Malley sprawled into a chair.  \"I understand we are about to start an invasion of Italy,\" the captain began. \"The details are a military secret, but it's coming and right away. There's some spade work to be done and you are to handle a hot assignment.\"  O'Malley's big mouth spread in an eager grin.  \"The commander has assigned you to this job because he feels you are specially fitted for the work.\" The captain beamed, but there was a look in his eye that made O'Malley sit up and wipe the grin off his face.  \"And what may it be?\" he demanded.  \"You are to ferry Lightnings to Malta.\" The captain lifted a hand as O'Malley came out of his chair like a cork out of a bottle of Algerian wine. \"This is dangerous business. You may have to fight your way through. This will be day flying.\"  O'Malley snorted. \"Fight! Sure, an' ferryin' to Malta is no work for a fighter pilot. 'Tis a job for these new colleens you got in the ferry service.\"  \"Colonel's orders,\" the captain said curtly. \"And the planes are to be landed in Malta in fighting trim. As soon as I round up a couple of men to work with you, I'll give you a call. Get set, because I'll need you any hour now.\"  O'Malley leaned forward and there was a dark gleam in his eyes. \"Did you say fight our way through?\" he asked.  \"If necessary, but I understand you are a stunting fool. You shouldn't have to fire a shot on any trip. The planes are not to be shot up. They are for combat use in the invasion.\"  O'Malley was on his feet. \"Foine,\" he said sweetly. \"'Tis a nice job, sor, an' I'm appreciatin' it.\"  The captain fixed him with a suspicious eye. This ferry job had been tough to fill. It was vitally important and demanded experienced fighter pilots, but none of the men wanted it. Captain Marks had not been able to get a single man to accept the job. He was relieved when the colonel had sent over word that O'Malley would serve as flight leader. But he still had to locate two men to work with the Irishman. O'Malley was taking the whole thing too nicely. Captain Marks was worried. He knew O'Malley's reputation and he had picked up a few hints of how O'Malley had been assigned to the job.  \"I'll give you the names of your crew as soon as I get them lined up,\" the captain said gruffly.  \"Shanghaied you mean,\" O'Malley said in a honeyed tone.  \"The colonel will locate a couple for me,\" the captain answered with a grin.  O'Malley grinned back at him. \"I know a couple I wish you could get hold of,\" he said. He turned around and walked out of the office.  For a full five minutes O'Malley stood outside the office looking out toward the blue Mediterranean. There was a deep scowl on his face. Finally he sauntered into the mess and seated himself near a window. Elevating his feet, he closed his eyes and took a nap.  He was awakened by an orderly. The soldier saluted smartly and said:  \"You are wanted at operations, sir.\"  O'Malley got to his feet and walked into the briefing shack, which was a shed hastily erected outside the mess. Captain Marks was waiting for him. He shoved a sheaf of flight orders at O'Malley.  \"You are to deliver three Lightning fighters to Malta. In case you meet enemy planes, you are to take proper evasive measures. Is that clear?\"  \"Yes, sor,\" O'Malley said and added, \"If we be attacked we fight?\"  \"Certainly, we don't want these new planes shot down.\"  Glancing at his flight orders, O'Malley moved leisurely out to the flight strip designated. Three Lightnings stood there with their props spinning. A ground crew was just leaving them. O'Malley nodded toward the chief mechanic who swung down out of the cockpit.  \"Is this bag o' bolts ready to fly?\" he asked with a grin.  \"She's clicking fine, sir,\" the sergeant answered.  O'Malley glanced at his orders. The two men under him were Ted Wilks and Pete Liske. He wondered what they had done to call down the colonel's displeasure. Swinging up into the greenhouse, he palmed the hatch cover and got set.  \"Wilks and Liske,\" he called lazily. \"This is your skipper, Mrs. O'Malley's son. Get your crates hot.\"  \"Temperatures check,\" Liske called back. His voice sounded sour.  \"Which one of the Auld Man's corns did you step on, Liske?\" O'Malley asked.  \"Same one I did,\" Wilks called in.  \"Can the chatter and get going,\" snapped a voice from operations. \"Lieutenant O'Malley, report out at once,\" another voice cut in.  \"Up to five thousand and then tuck in close to me,\" O'Malley ordered.  \"Read your flight sheets!\" The voice from operations was sharp and snappy.  O'Malley laughed. \"Shove off, me hearties,\" he called.  Wilks went zooming off and Liske followed closely. O'Malley watched their take-off with a critical eye. He saw at once that he had been given two fledglings to nurse safely through. Like an old hen, he was expected to see them through by proper evasive tactics. O'Malley began whistling a bit of an Irish tune. He'd protect those kids, just let any Italian or German fighter show up.  Kicking down on one brake, he spun the Lightning around and sent her zooming off the field, hanging her on her prop at once, and surging over the hatch covers of his charges like a crazy angel heading for the sun. His boys dropped in behind him and soon had snuggled in, wing to wing, one on each side.  \"So you birds were bad boys,\" O'Malley called across to his men.  \"So what? We hear you were supposed to be a major,\" Liske answered insolently.  \"We didn't read the rule book careful,\" Wilks confessed with a laugh.  \"From now on you won't be after needin' a rule book,\" O'Malley assured them. He was scanning the blue sky eagerly. A pile of clouds, off to the east, looked promising. He swung over that way. If there was a Jerry in the whole area, he'd be hiding up in that cloud.  The three Lightnings zoomed low under the cloud but nothing happened. The sky was as serene and calm as the sky over a Kansas wheat field or a kirk in Kerry County, Ireland. O'Malley scowled and eased back against the shock pad.  They roared over Pantelleria Island which had been occupied by the British and Yanks. Sicily lay ahead and O'Malley knew evasive tactics called for a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32288"],["title","A Yankee Flier in Italy (#2)"],["body","sweep to the east and south. He had already flown miles north in his hopeful quest of trouble. Easing down to two thousand feet, they swept around in a circle that carried them within sight of the coast of Sicily. But there was no enemy craft in sight in the air and very few on the water along the coast. With a sigh O'Malley straightened their course and headed in to Malta. They had flown a half circle deep into enemy territory but nothing exciting had happened. O'Malley was beginning to worry. If all of their ferry flights were going to be like this, he would have to do something about it.  Picking up the radio signals from the Malta field, they slid in, spotted the Yank landing strip, and set down. Ground crews rushed out to take over. They swarmed around the Lightnings and had them moving off almost before their pilots were out of the cockpits. O'Malley scowled. The boys had no more respect for a ferry pilot than they did an M.P.  O'Malley obtained his release and acceptance of the planes from a captain who rode out in a motorcycle. The captain seemed irritated.  \"Your flight time is double what it should be. Get over to Number Three Field and get your transportation back to Africa.\"  \"Yes, sor,\" O'Malley said. \"We drifted a bit off course.\"  The captain looked at him sharply. He was very busy and delays did not improve his ragged temper.  \"Don't let it happen again,\" he snapped.  O'Malley smiled at his two fliers. \"Sure, an' 'tis very ungrateful some people are. We risk our necks to deliver these crates an' get a sour welcome.\" He turned and walked away. The captain stood staring after him. He had not met a man like O'Malley before. Usually ferry pilots were not given to back talk.  The transport was waiting. O'Malley and his pals climbed in among an assortment of equipment and supplies being returned to base. In a short time they were back at their own briefing room. Three planes were ready and they took off again.  All day they ferried Lightnings across to Malta and not once did they sight enemy craft. O'Malley was wild when they checked in for the evening. He glared at the grinning Captain Marks.  \"Sure, an' something better bust loose tomorrow,\" he cried.  \"Probably will,\" Marks answered.  O'Malley stomped away to quarters. Wilks and Liske dashed off to put in for an immediate transfer to more active duty. O'Malley hoped they got the transfer. He knew there was not much chance of him getting shifted, not as long as Colonel Benson was in command.     CHAPTER III  REUNION   Stan and Allison sat in the big Lockheed transport and looked down upon the shores of Africa. A coastal road wound along the beach. It was war-scarred and still littered with broken tanks and shattered trucks. This was the route Rommel had taken in his flight across Libya.  \"Wonder what O'Malley's doing about this time?\" Stan asked. He was beginning to be sorry he had accepted the offer to return to Alexandria. O'Malley likely was leading a flight over the shores of Italy.  \"I'll bet he is seeing action,\" Allison said. \"But I'm satisfied to be riding in peace with a pip of a vacation ahead. You're not beginning to get the bug to fight so soon, old man?\"  \"No,\" Stan answered with a grin. \"I aim to have a swell time and be ready for the big push into Europe.\"  The trained ears of the two pilots caught a warning signal from one of the plane's radial motors. The motor complained for a few minutes, then coughed and conked out completely.  \"Looks like we might be due for a forced landing,\" Stan said.  \"That would be our luck,\" Allison answered. \"Where are we, anyway?\"  \"We must be near Bengazi.\" Stan peered down at the coast line.  A few minutes later their fears were realized. The transport began circling for a landing. They sighted the ruins of a town and were soon over it. Ten minutes later they were standing on a sand dune along with the pilot and copilot. A group of higher-ranking officers, including a general, stood a little way from them.  \"We'll not be here very long,\" the pilot said, jerking his head toward his other passengers. \"Not with the big boy along. He's on an urgent mission. We've already radioed for a pick-up plane.\"  \"He's hurrying in the wrong direction,\" Allison said.  Stan walked away and down the slope a bit. One of the Navy's NATS amphibian freight planes was down at the dock. Stan had learned to respect the Navy Air Transport Service. Those boys flew freight and mail from the United States to every part of the world where the Yanks were fighting, and they flew it on schedule. This plane probably was headed back to Tunis or Bizerte.  He passed the high officers at some little distance. The wind was blowing away from them and he caught the irritated voice of the general.  \"With this delay I'll have to go back. Action against Italy starts at dawn tomorrow.\" The wind whipped away the general's words and Stan did not hear any more, but what he had heard made him halt.  Invasion. The boys were going in for the kill and he was heading for a rest in Alexandria. Turning, he walked up the hill. Allison was chatting with the pilot. Stan motioned to him and they strolled down the slope. When they were out of hearing of the crew, Stan said:  \"I just overheard something.\"  Allison gave him a quick look. \"Been eavesdropping?\"  \"An ill wind brought me a word from that general. We're hitting it back to Bizerte.\"  \"I say, old chap, you know I'm going where I can have two hot baths a day. I'll have a barber shave me and I'll have breakfast served in bed. You run along back to Bizerte, but I'm going on to Alexandria.\"  \"The attack on Italy is set for tomorrow morning. The general is going back and I'm going with him. O'Malley isn't going to hog this show.\"  Allison halted and stared at Stan. Suddenly his twisted smile pulled at the corners of his mouth. \"If you put it that way, I guess I'm going back to Bizerte, too.\"  \"The general has radioed for a plane to take him back. This delay has upset his schedule and he won't go on. We'll go back with him. Let's collar the old boy.\"  \"We are under orders to report to Alexandria,\" Allison reminded him.  \"The general doesn't know what our orders are. We can worry about little things like that after we get back,\" Stan said impatiently.  They walked across the slope to where the general was standing. There were four officers with him, three colonels and a major.  \"Could we have a word with you, sir?\" Stan asked as he snapped a salute.  \"Certainly,\" General Miller said.  \"We have decided to return to Bizerte and wondered if you could say a word for us if a westbound plane stops here. This delay will upset our plans and we might as well go back.\"  The general looked at Stan sharply. \"What made you change your plans, besides this accident?\"  Stan grinned. He did not dare admit that he had overheard the general talking.  \"The farther we get from the base of action, the more jittery we get,\" he replied.  \"You fellows have to be ordered to take leave,\" General Miller said and smiled. \"Do your orders allow you such freedom of action?\"  \"We feel that they do,\" Stan said.  \"I'm sorry I can't take you. I'm afraid I'd be called to account for helping you disobey orders.\" The general's smile had spread into a grin. \"You will go on as you should.\"  \"Thank you, sir,\" Stan said. They both saluted and walked away.  \"Guess we're sunk,\" Allison said sourly. \"O'Malley will certainly rub it in when he sees us again. He'll be right in the middle of the big fight.\"  Stan was looking at the NATS amphibian and smiling. \"We might be able to thumb a ride with the Navy.\"  Allison looked down toward the sea. The Navy boys were getting the big freighter set to take off.  \"Worth a try, let's go down there.\"  They hurried down to the beach. An ensign was handling the shifting of supplies from the flying boat to a truck. He greeted Stan and Allison in a friendly manner after glancing at their service stripes.  \"You boys are a bit off your reservation, aren't you?\" he asked.  \"We sure are and we want to get back. How about a ride to Bizerte?\"  \"We're not hauling passengers, but if you piled in nobody would throw you off. We're supposed to cooperate with the Army in every way we can.\" The ensign laughed.  \"Great stuff,\" Allison said. \"I'm March Allison and he's Stan Wilson.\"  \"I'm Bert Thomas,\" the ensign said. \"If you have bags you better get them aboard. We're about to shove off.\"  \"We're not taking any bags back,\" Stan said hurriedly. He did not want to risk having the general order them to go on into Alexandria. In fact, he did not want the general to know they were going out with the amphibian.  \"O.K. Just get aboard and find a place to sit down.\"  Stan and Allison climbed aboard the freighter. The crew paid no attention to them but went on lashing cargo into place, cramming all sorts of odd repair parts into every corner.  Ensign Thomas came aboard and took his place beside his copilot. Stan and Allison sat on the only two vacant seats along the arching ribs of the ship. They were careful not to take the space reserved for the crew.  The freighter slid out into the bay and soon she was slapping the step of the lazy waves. A few seconds later she lifted and was off, rising slowly, roaring along like a gorged pelican. She did not have a machine gun or a cannon aboard and she was going it alone. The two fighter pilots, used to a bank of Brownings in front of them, felt uneasy. If a Heinkel or an Me 110 showed up, the old girl would be a dead duck.  No enemy planes showed up, however, and the freighter bored along. Ahead of them the sun was settling down into the sea, filling the air with golden haze and making the water glow like sapphire. Just at sunset the freighter swung inshore and eased down over the harbor at Bizerte. Two fighter planes from a carrier lying offshore zoomed around her as she came in. She hit the water and glided in to a mooring.  \"Passengers ashore!\" Bert Thomas called back.  As they piled out Stan "]]]
