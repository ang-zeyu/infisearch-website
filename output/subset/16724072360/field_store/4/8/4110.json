General Miller was radically conservative; a man over whose kindly nature habit had no slight influence; attaching himself strongly to familiar faces, and with difficulty moved to change, even when change might have brought unquestionable improvement. Thus, on taking charge of my department, I found few but aged men. They were ancient sea-captains, for the most part, who, after being tossed on every sea, and standing up sturdily against life’s tempestuous blast, had finally drifted into this quiet nook, where, with little to disturb them, except the periodical terrors of a Presidential election, they one and all acquired a new lease of existence. Though by no means less liable than their fellow-men to age and infirmity, they had evidently some talisman or other that kept death at bay. Two or three of their number, as I was assured, being gouty and rheumatic, or perhaps bed-ridden, never dreamed of making their appearance at the Custom-House during a large part of the year; but, after a torpid winter, would creep out into the warm sunshine of May or June, go lazily about what they termed duty, and, at their own leisure and convenience, betake themselves to bed again. I must plead guilty to the charge of abbreviating the official breath of more than one of these venerable servants of the republic. They were allowed, on my representation, to rest from their arduous labours, and soon afterwards—as if their sole principle of life had been zeal for their country’s service—as I verily believe it was—withdrew to a better world. It is a pious consolation to me that, through my interference, a sufficient space was allowed them for repentance of the evil and corrupt practices into which, as a matter of course, every Custom-House officer must be supposed to fall. Neither the front nor the back entrance of the Custom-House opens on the road to Paradise.  The greater part of my officers were Whigs. It was well for their venerable brotherhood that the new Surveyor was not a politician, and though a faithful Democrat in principle, neither received nor held his office with any reference to political services. Had it been otherwise—had an active politician been put into this influential post, to assume the easy task of making head against a Whig Collector, whose infirmities withheld him from the personal administration of his office—hardly a man of the old corps would have drawn the breath of official life within a month after the exterminating angel had come up the Custom-House steps. According to the received code in such matters, it would have been nothing short of duty, in a politician, to bring every one of those white heads under the axe of the guillotine. It was plain enough to discern that the old fellows dreaded some such discourtesy at my hands. It pained, and at the same time amused me, to behold the terrors that attended my advent, to see a furrowed cheek, weather-beaten by half a century of storm, turn ashy pale at the glance of so harmless an individual as myself; to detect, as one or another addressed me, the tremor of a voice which, in long-past days, had been wont to bellow through a speaking-trumpet, hoarsely enough to frighten Boreas himself to silence. They knew, these excellent old persons, that, by all established rule—and, as regarded some of them, weighed by their own lack of efficiency for business—they ought to have given place to younger men, more orthodox in politics, and altogether fitter than themselves to serve our common Uncle. I knew it, too, but could never quite find in my heart to act upon the knowledge. Much and deservedly to my own discredit, therefore, and considerably to the detriment of my official conscience, they continued, during my incumbency, to creep about the wharves, and loiter up and down the Custom-House steps. They spent a good deal of time, also, asleep in their accustomed corners, with their chairs tilted back against the walls; awaking, however, once or twice in the forenoon, to bore one another with the several thousandth repetition of old sea-stories and mouldy jokes, that had grown to be passwords and countersigns among them.  The discovery was soon made, I imagine, that the new Surveyor had no great harm in him. So, with lightsome hearts and the happy consciousness of being usefully employed—in their own behalf at least, if not for our beloved country—these good old gentlemen went through the various formalities of office. Sagaciously under their spectacles, did they peep into the holds of vessels. Mighty was their fuss about little matters, and marvellous, sometimes, the obtuseness that allowed greater ones to slip between their fingers! Whenever such a mischance occurred—when a waggon-load of valuable merchandise had been smuggled ashore, at noonday, perhaps, and directly beneath their unsuspicious noses—nothing could exceed the vigilance and alacrity with which they proceeded to lock, and double-lock, and secure with tape and sealing-wax, all the avenues of the delinquent vessel. Instead of a reprimand for their previous negligence, the case seemed rather to require an eulogium on their praiseworthy caution after the mischief had happened; a grateful recognition of the promptitude of their zeal the moment that there was no longer any remedy.  Unless people are more than commonly disagreeable, it is my foolish habit to contract a kindness for them. The better part of my companion’s character, if it have a better part, is that which usually comes uppermost in my regard, and forms the type whereby I recognise the man. As most of these old Custom-House officers had good traits, and as my position in reference to them, being paternal and protective, was favourable to the growth of friendly sentiments, I soon grew to like them all. It was pleasant in the summer forenoons—when the fervent heat, that almost liquefied the rest of the human family, merely communicated a genial warmth to their half torpid systems—it was pleasant to hear them chatting in the back entry, a row of them all tipped against the wall, as usual; while the frozen witticisms of past generations were thawed out, and came bubbling with laughter from their lips. Externally, the jollity of aged men has much in common with the mirth of children; the intellect, any more than a deep sense of humour, has little to do with the matter; it is, with both, a gleam that plays upon the surface, and imparts a sunny and cheery aspect alike to the green branch and grey, mouldering trunk. In one case, however, it is real sunshine; in the other, it more resembles the phosphorescent glow of decaying wood.  It would be sad injustice, the reader must understand, to represent all my excellent old friends as in their dotage. In the first place, my coadjutors were not invariably old; there were men among them in their strength and prime, of marked ability and energy, and altogether superior to the sluggish and dependent mode of life on which their evil stars had cast them. Then, moreover, the white locks of age were sometimes found to be the thatch of an intellectual tenement in good repair. But, as respects the majority of my corps of veterans, there will be no wrong done if I characterize them generally as a set of wearisome old souls, who had gathered nothing worth preservation from their varied experience of life. They seemed to have flung away all the golden grain of practical wisdom, which they had enjoyed so many opportunities of harvesting, and most carefully to have stored their memory with the husks. They spoke with far more interest and unction of their morning’s breakfast, or yesterday’s, today’s, or tomorrow’s dinner, than of the shipwreck of forty or fifty years ago, and all the world’s wonders which they had witnessed with their youthful eyes.  The father of the Custom-House—the patriarch, not only of this little squad of officials, but, I am bold to say, of the respectable body of tide-waiters all over the United States—was a certain permanent Inspector. He might truly be termed a legitimate son of the revenue system, dyed in the wool, or rather born in the purple; since his sire, a Revolutionary colonel, and formerly collector of the port, had created an office for him, and appointed him to fill it, at a period of the early ages which few living men can now remember. This Inspector, when I first knew him, was a man of fourscore years, or thereabouts, and certainly one of the most wonderful specimens of winter-green that you would be likely to discover in a lifetime’s search. With his florid cheek, his compact figure smartly arrayed in a bright-buttoned blue coat, his brisk and vigorous step, and his hale and hearty aspect, altogether he seemed—not young, indeed—but a kind of new contrivance of Mother Nature in the shape of man, whom age and infirmity had no business to touch. His voice and laugh, which perpetually re-echoed through the Custom-House, had nothing of the tremulous quaver and cackle of an old man’s utterance; they came strutting out of his lungs, like the crow of a cock, or the blast of a clarion. Looking at him merely as an animal—and there was very little else to look at—he was a most satisfactory object, from the thorough healthfulness and wholesomeness of his system, and his capacity, at that extreme age, to enjoy all, or nearly all, the delights which he had ever aimed at or conceived of. The careless security of his life in the Custom-House, on a regular income, and with but slight and infrequent apprehensions of removal, had no doubt contributed to make time pass lightly over him. The original and more potent causes, however, lay in the rare perfection of his animal nature, the moderate proportion "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3300"],["title","An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations (#1)"],["body","     The greatest improvements in the productive powers of labour, and the       greater part of the skill, dexterity, and judgment, with which it is       anywhere directed, or applied, seem to have been the effects of the       division of labour. The effects of the division of labour, in the general       business of society, will be more easily understood, by considering in       what manner it operates in some particular manufactures. It is commonly       supposed to be carried furthest in some very trifling ones; not perhaps       that it really is carried further in them than in others of more       importance: but in those trifling manufactures which are destined to       supply the small wants of but a small number of people, the whole number       of workmen must necessarily be small; and those employed in every       different branch of the work can often be collected into the same       workhouse, and placed at once under the view of the spectator.            In those great manufactures, on the contrary, which are destined to supply       the great wants of the great body of the people, every different branch of       the work employs so great a number of workmen, that it is impossible to       collect them all into the same workhouse. We can seldom see more, at one       time, than those employed in one single branch. Though in such       manufactures, therefore, the work may really be divided into a much       greater number of parts, than in those of a more trifling nature, the       division is not near so obvious, and has accordingly been much less       observed.            To take an example, therefore, from a very trifling manufacture, but one       in which the division of labour has been very often taken notice of, the       trade of a pin-maker: a workman not educated to this business (which the       division of labour has rendered a distinct trade), nor acquainted with the       use of the machinery employed in it (to the invention of which the same       division of labour has probably given occasion), could scarce, perhaps,       with his utmost industry, make one pin in a day, and certainly could not       make twenty. But in the way in which this business is now carried on, not       only the whole work is a peculiar trade, but it is divided into a number       of branches, of which the greater part are likewise peculiar trades. One       man draws out the wire; another straights it; a third cuts it; a fourth       points it; a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head; to make       the head requires two or three distinct operations; to put it on is a       peculiar business; to whiten the pins is another; it is even a trade by       itself to put them into the paper; and the important business of making a       pin is, in this manner, divided into about eighteen distinct operations,       which, in some manufactories, are all performed by distinct hands, though       in others the same man will sometimes perform two or three of them. I have       seen a small manufactory of this kind, where ten men only were employed,       and where some of them consequently performed two or three distinct       operations. But though they were very poor, and therefore but       indifferently accommodated with the necessary machinery, they could, when       they exerted themselves, make among them about twelve pounds of pins in a       day. There are in a pound upwards of four thousand pins of a middling       size. Those ten persons, therefore, could make among them upwards of       forty-eight thousand pins in a day. Each person, therefore, making a tenth       part of forty-eight thousand pins, might be considered as making four       thousand eight hundred pins in a day. But if they had all wrought       separately and independently, and without any of them having been educated       to this peculiar business, they certainly could not each of them have made       twenty, perhaps not one pin in a day; that is, certainly, not the two       hundred and fortieth, perhaps not the four thousand eight hundredth, part       of what they are at present capable of performing, in consequence of a       proper division and combination of their different operations.            In every other art and manufacture, the effects of the division of labour       are similar to what they are in this very trifling one, though, in many of       them, the labour can neither be so much subdivided, nor reduced to so       great a simplicity of operation. The division of labour, however, so far       as it can be introduced, occasions, in every art, a proportionable       increase of the productive powers of labour. The separation of different       trades and employments from one another, seems to have taken place in       consequence of this advantage. This separation, too, is generally carried       furthest in those countries which enjoy the highest degree of industry and       improvement; what is the work of one man, in a rude state of society,       being generally that of several in an improved one. In every improved       society, the farmer is generally nothing but a farmer; the manufacturer,       nothing but a manufacturer. The labour, too, which is necessary to produce       any one complete manufacture, is almost always divided among a great       number of hands. How many different trades are employed in each branch of       the linen and woollen manufactures, from the growers of the flax and the       wool, to the bleachers and smoothers of the linen, or to the dyers and       dressers of the cloth! The nature of agriculture, indeed, does not admit       of so many subdivisions of labour, nor of so complete a separation of one       business from another, as manufactures. It is impossible to separate so       entirely the business of the grazier from that of the corn-farmer, as the       trade of the carpenter is commonly separated from that of the smith. The       spinner is almost always a distinct person from the weaver; but the       ploughman, the harrower, the sower of the seed, and the reaper of the       corn, are often the same. The occasions for those different sorts of       labour returning with the different seasons of the year, it is impossible       that one man should be constantly employed in any one of them. This       impossibility of making so complete and entire a separation of all the       different branches of labour employed in agriculture, is perhaps the       reason why the improvement of the productive powers of labour, in this       art, does not always keep pace with their improvement in manufactures. The       most opulent nations, indeed, generally excel all their neighbours in       agriculture as well as in manufactures; but they are commonly more       distinguished by their superiority in the latter than in the former. Their       lands are in general better cultivated, and having more labour and expense       bestowed upon them, produce more in proportion to the extent and natural       fertility of the ground. But this superiority of produce is seldom much       more than in proportion to the superiority of labour and expense. In       agriculture, the labour of the rich country is not always much more       productive than that of the poor; or, at least, it is never so much more       productive, as it commonly is in manufactures. The corn of the rich       country, therefore, will not always, in the same degree of goodness, come       cheaper to market than that of the poor. The corn of Poland, in the same       degree of goodness, is as cheap as that of France, notwithstanding the       superior opulence and improvement of the latter country. The corn of       France is, in the corn-provinces, fully as good, and in most years nearly       about the same price with the corn of England, though, in opulence and       improvement, France is perhaps inferior to England. The corn-lands of       England, however, are better cultivated than those of France, and the       corn-lands of France are said to be much better cultivated than those of       Poland. But though the poor country, notwithstanding the inferiority of       its cultivation, can, in some measure, rival the rich in the cheapness and       goodness of its corn, it can pretend to no such competition in its       manufactures, at least if those manufactures suit the soil, climate, and       situation, of the rich country. The silks of France are better and cheaper       than those of England, because the silk manufacture, at least under the       present high duties upon the importation of raw silk, does not so well       suit the climate of England as that of France. But the hardware and the       coarse woollens of England are beyond all comparison superior to those of       France, and much cheaper, too, in the same degree of goodness. In Poland       there are said to be scarce any manufactures of any kind, a few of those       coarser household manufactures excepted, without which no country can well       subsist.            This great increase in the quantity of work, which, in consequence of the       division of labour, the same number of people are capable of performing,       is owing to three different circumstances; first, to the increase of       dexterity in every particular workman; secondly, to the saving of the time       which is commonly lost in passing from one species of work to another;       and, lastly, to the invention of a great number of machines which       facilitate and abridge labour, and enable one man to do the work of many.            First, the improvement of the dexterity of the workmen, necessarily       increases the quantity of the work he can perform; and the division of       labour, by reducing every man’s business to some one simple operation, and       by making this operation the sole employment of his life, necessarily       increases very much the"]]]
