How the poor bird sings in its cage! I know more of his affairs than he thinks of, by overhearing his conversation at the inn at Lorca.  _Don Alph._ How shall I escape from these rascals? Oh, here is one of the gentlemen. Pray, sir, may I take the liberty--  _Spado._ No liberty for you.--Yet upon certain conditions, indeed--give me your hand.  _Don Alph._ [_Aside._] Impudent scoundrel!  _Spado._ Signor, I wish to serve you--and serve you I will; but I must know the channel, before I make for the coast; therefore, to examine you with the pious severity of an holy inquisitor, who the devil are you?  _Don Alph._ A pious adjuration truly!--[_Aside._]--Sir, my name is Alphonso, and I am son of a banker at Madrid.  _Spado._ Banker! Oh! I thought he sung like a young goldfinch.  _Don Alph._ Perhaps, by trusting this fellow, I may make my escape.                                                                [_Aside._  _Spado._ I'll convince him I know his secrets, and then I hold his purse-strings.  _Don Alph._ You won't betray me?  _Spado._ Honour among thieves.  _Don Alph._ Then you must know, when your gang attacked me yesterday evening--  _Spado._ You were posting full gallop to Don Scipio's castle, on the confines of the forest here.  _Don Alph._ Hey! then perhaps you know my passion for--  _Spado._ Donna Victoria, his daughter.  _Don Alph._ Then you know that she's contracted--  _Spado._ To your friend Don Fernando de Zelva, who is now on his journey to the castle, and, to the destruction of your hopes, weds the lady on his arrival.  _Don Alph._ True, while I am pent up in this cursed cavern; but how you got my story, I----  _Spado._ No matter! I could let you out of this cursed cavern.  _Don Alph._ And will you?  _Spado._ Ah, our trap-door above requires a golden key.  _Don Alph._ Your comrades have not left me a piastre.  _Spado._ Will you give me an order on your father's bank for fifty pieces, and I'll let you out?  _Don Alph._ You shall have it.  _Spado._ A bargain. I'll secure your escape.  _Enter DON CÆSAR, behind._  _Don Cæsar._ How's this?  _Spado._ Zounds, the captain Ramirez! [_Aside._]--Ay, you dog, I'll secure you for an escape! Do you think I'd set you at liberty without the captain's orders? Betray my trust for a bribe! What the devil do you take me for? [_In a seeming rage._] Oh, captain, I did not see you.  _Don Cæsar._ What's the matter?  _Spado._ Nothing, only our prisoner here was mistaken in his man--that's all. Let you escape, indeed!  _Don Alph._ Here's a rascal!  _Spado._ Rascal! D'ye hear him? He has been abusing me this half hour, because I would not convey him out without your knowledge. Oh, what offers he did make me! but my integrity is proof against Gallions, Escurials, Perus, and Mexicos.  _Don Cæsar._ Begone instantly to your comrades. [_SPADO ascends._] Signor, no occasion to tamper with my companions; you shall owe your liberty to none but me. I'll convey you to the cottage of the vines, belonging to the peasant Philippo, not far from Don Scipio's castle; there you may rest in safety to-night, and--  _Don Alph._ Ah, captain! no rest for me.  _Don Cæsar._ Look ye, signor, I am a ruffian, perhaps worse, but venture to trust me.--A picklock may be used to get to a treasure--don't wish to know more of me than I now chuse to tell you; but, if your mistress loves you as well as you seem to love her, to-morrow night she's yours.  _Don Alph._ My good friend!  _Don Cæsar._ Now for Philippo--I don't suppose you wish to see any of our work above--ha! ha! ha!--Well, well, I was once a lover, but now--   AIR IV.--DON CÆSAR.      _On by the spur of valour goaded,_       _Pistols primed, and carbines loaded,_         _Courage strikes on hearts of steel;_           _While each spark,_           _Through the dark_   _Gloom of night,_   _Lends a clear and cheering light,_     _Who a fear or doubt can feel?_    _Like serpents now, through thickets creeping,_   _Then on our prey, like lions, leaping!_     _Calvette to the onset leads us,_     _Let the wand'ring trav'ler dread us!_   _Struck with terror and amaze,_   _While our swords with lightning blaze._                                                                [Thunder.      _Thunder to our carbines roaring,_     _Bursting clouds in torrents pouring,_       _Each a free and roving blade,_       _Ours a free and roving trade,_         _To the onset let's away,_         _Valour calls, and we obey._                                                                 [Exeunt.

[_Thunder._] Ah, this must frighten the mules, they'll break their bridles; I tied the poor beasts to a tree.  _Don Fer._ Well, we may find them in the morning, if they escape the banditti, which I am told infests this forest.  _Ped._ Banditti! [_A shot without._] Ah! we are dead men.  _Don Fer._ Somebody in trouble!  _Ped._ No, somebody's troubles are over.  _Don Fer._ Draw and follow me, Pedrillo.  _Ped._ Lord, sir! ha'n't we troubles enough of our own?  _Don Fer._ Follow!

Approach, my brave deliverer.  _Spado._ So, here's a victory, and nobody to claim it! I think I'll go down and pick up the laurel. [_Descends from the Tree._] I'll take the merit of this exploit, I may get something by it.  _Don Scipio._ I long to thank, embrace, worship this generous stranger, as my guardian angel.  _Spado._ [_Aside._] I may pass for this angel in the dark--Villains! scoundrels! robbers! to attack an honest old gentleman on the king's highway!--but I made the dogs scamper!

Well, though the fellows swear I'm an angel, this world is good enough for me--Dear ma'am, I wish I could but once see you in love.  _Vic._ Heigho!

Hush! Dame Isabel, not content with making your father, by slights and ill usage, force your brother, poor Don Cæsar, to run about the world, in the Lord knows what wild courses, but she now has persuaded the old gentleman to pass her daughter on Don Fernando, for you--There, yonder she is, flaunting, so be-jewelled and be-plumed--Well, if I was you, they might take my birthright--but my husband--take my man--the deuce shall take them first! Ah, no! if ever I do go to heaven, I'll have a smart lad in my company.--Send you to a nunnery!  _Vic._ Was my fond mother alive!--Catilina, my father will certainly marry this Dame Isabel; I'm now an alien to his affections, bereft of every joy and every hope, I shall quit the world without a sigh.

My young master is coming--  _Isab._ Well, sir!  _Spado._ Incog.  _Isab._ Incog!  _Spado._ Madam, you shall hear--[_Aside._]--Now for a lie worth twenty pistoles--The morning before his departure, Don Fernando calls me into his closet, and shutting the door, \"Spado,\" says he, \"you know this obstinate father of mine has engaged me to marry a lady I have never seen, and to-morrow, by his order, I set out for Don Scipio, her father's castle, for that purpose; but,\" says he, striking his breast with one hand, twisting his mustaches with the other, and turning up his eyes--\"if, when I see her, she don't hit my fancy, I'll not marry her, by the----\"--I sha'n't mention his oath before you, madam.  _Isab._ No, pray don't, sir.  _Spado._ \"Therefore,\" says he, \"I design to dress Pedrillo, my arch dog of a valet, in a suit of my clothes, and he shall personate me at Don Scipio's castle, while I, in a livery, pass for him--If I like the lady, I resume my own character, and take her hand; if not, the deceit continues, and Pedrillo weds Donna Victoria, just to warn parental tyranny how it dares to clap up marriage, without consulting our inclinations.\"  _Isab._ Here's a discovery! so then, it's my poor child that must have fallen into this snare--[_Aside._] Well, good sir.  _Spado._ \"And, (continued he) Spado, I appoint you my trusty spy in this Don Scipio's family; to cover our designs, let it be a secret that you belong to me, and I sha'n't seem even to know you--You'll easily get a footing in the family (says he) by imposing some lie or other upon a foolish woman, I'm told, is in the castle. Dame Isabel I think they call her.\"  _Isab._ He shall find I am not so easily imposed upon.  _Spado._ I said so, madam; says I, a lady of Dame Isabel's wisdom must soon find me out, was I to tell her a lie.  _Isab._ Ay, that I should, sir.  _Enter VASQUEZ._"]]]
