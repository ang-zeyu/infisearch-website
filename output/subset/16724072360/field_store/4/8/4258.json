Tuft on female scutellum light fulvous. The female, from Kalacoon, (Hym. 212) is the type of the variety.   #Euglossa ignita# Smith, var. #chlorosoma#, new variety  Green, without coppery tints, but variably suffused with purple. It is smaller than _E. piliventris_, with shorter mouth-parts, and the labrum pallid with a pair of dusky spots. A male in the U. S. Nat. Museum from Bartica, which I reported as _E. piliventris_, belongs here. Female _E. piliventris_ has long yellow hairs on the anterior margin of hind basitarsus, but in _chlorosoma_ the hair in this situation is black. The type of the variety is a female labelled Hym. 140. A female from Kalacoon has brassy and coppery tints on the apical part of abdomen, and must be referred to _E. ignita_ proper. The type locality of _ignita_ is Jamaica.  #Ceratina læta# Spinola. This was described from the female. The specimen sent is a male, and differs from the female in being smaller, and having a transverse band on anterior margin of clypeus, triangular marks on lower corners of face, and a large patch (emarginate above) on labrum all ivory-white. This is very like _C. viridula_ Smith, which Ducke considers a synonym of _læta_, but the base of the metathorax seems to differ, and the nervures are piceous. For the present, therefore, I retain _C. viridula_ as a distinct species. The female of _C. viridula_, collected by Busck in the Panama Canal Zone, is also distinguishable from that sex of _C. læta_.   #Epicharis maculata# var. #barticana#, new variety  [Female].--Base of mandibles with a large cuneiform yellow mark; a broad black band down each side of labrum; yellow spots on prothorax large; scutellum with a pair of large transversely oval yellow areas, separated by a narrow black band; band on second abdominal segment with a posterior median projection. Kalacoon, 1916. (Hym. 217.)   #Rhathymus beebei#, new species  [Female].--Length about 22 mm., anterior wing 18 mm.; head clear ferruginous, with red hair, lower part of face more pallid, with a creamy tint; apical half of mandibles black; clypeus prominent, minutely roughened, with a smooth median line; mesothorax black, with a median ridge, the surface on each side of this strongly punctured, but shining between the punctures; rest of thorax ferruginous, and all of thorax with ferruginous hair; scutellum not bigibbous, but with an elevated transverse ridge; pleura with a blackish area below the wings; lower part of mesopleura with a shining tubercle; tegulæ clear ferruginous, finely punctured; wings strongly reddened; legs clear ferruginous; abdomen fusiform, shining; first two segments dull reddish, pallid posterolaterally, the others reddish black, with the hind margins redder; apical plate very large, concave. Bartica District (Hym. 19). Very distinct by the transverse straight ridge on scutellum; nearest perhaps to the considerably smaller _R. unicolor_ Smith, but that has dark fuscous wings. The antennæ are unfortunately missing.   #Augochlora callichlorura#, new species  [Female].--Length a little over 7 mm.; first two abdominal segments rather weakly vibrissate on hind margin with orange hairs; hind spur of hind leg with long spines. Head and thorax very dark purplish, nearly black, but a blue-green spot at upper end of clypeus, supraclypeal area brilliant purple, and base of metathorax strongly tinged with purple; anterior and middle legs dark, with weak purple tints, but hind femora, tibiæ and basal half of basitarsi all brilliant green on outer side; abdomen short and broad, shining, very brilliant emerald green. Head broad, eyes strongly converging below; clypeus with extremely large punctures; front dull and granular; ocelli ordinary; cheeks with thin white hair; mesothorax and scutellum shining, but well punctured; base of metathorax with strong short plicæ; angles of prothorax not prominent; tegulæ rufotestaceous; wings grayish translucent, stigma and nervures dusky pale brown; first recurrent nervure meeting second transversocubital; abdomen with thin pale hair, hind margins of segments not darkened. Bartica District.  Unique by the combination of purplish head and thorax and green abdomen, the general effect recalling _A. atropos_ Smith.   #Florilegus barticanus#, new species.  [Male].--Length about 11 mm.; black, except as follows: first abdominal segment strongly greenish; clypeus and labrum entirely yellow; mandibles fulvous apically (but base black); antennæ, except the first two joints, ferruginous beneath; hind tarsi, and apex of hind tibiæ, dusky red; hair of head and thorax ferruginous, paler below, no admixture of dark hairs; eyes reddish; mesothorax shining, but distinctly punctured; tegulæ clear ferruginous; wings dusky hyaline, nervures reddish fuscous; legs with pale hair, conspicuously plumose on hind tibiæ; abdomen with four broad dense ochraceous hair-bands, that on fourth segment broadly excavated in middle posteriorly, on fifth broadly interrupted; sixth segment with a small patch of fulvous hair on each side; apical part of abdomen dorsally, except for the bands and patches, with very dark fuscous hair. Bartica District (Hym. 11).  Related to _F. lanieri_ Guér. from Cuba and _F. condigna_ Cresson from the United States. In the coloration of the legs it is intermediate between these two.  #Tetrapedia lacteipennis# Vachal.--It should be added to Vachal's description, that the dorsal abdominal segments 2 to 4 have yellow bands.  The Bartica collection contains a _Megalopta_ from Hoorie, but it is unfortunately broken. I have _Megalopta panamensis_ Cockerell from Maroni, French Guiana (Queensland Museum, 42).  I add the description of a new species from French Guiana, the type of which is in my collection.   #Augochlora maroniana#, new species  [Female].--Length slightly over 8 mm.; head, thorax and legs bright green; abdomen yellowish green strongly suffused with coppery, the first two segments with apical fringes of orange hair; face rather narrow; antennæ black; lower middle of clypeus black; mesothorax and scutellum rough with dense punctatures, the scutellum with two copper-red spots; area of metathorax with very feeble plicæ; tegulæ black with pallid margin, the basal side broadly green; wings dusky; second s. m. square; first r. n. meeting second t. c; stigma dusky reddish; legs with mainly pale hair, hind tibiæ with dark hair on outer side basally; hind spur with about six long spines; basal half of basitarsi green on outer side; abdomen shining, with pale ochreus hair.  Maroni, French Guiana (Queensland Mus., 43). Related to _A. cupreola_ (Ckll.), but with the vibrissate fringes on abdomen nearly twice as long, and deep orange-fulvous, and the mesothorax much more densely punctured. Also related to _A. diversipennis_ (Lep.), but with the face much narrower, and the area of metathorax much less distinctly plicate. From _A. calypso_ Sm. it is known by the wings not being yellowish, the inner orbits not edged with blue, and the tarsi not ferruginous.

No charters were granted to Christian Scien-         tists for such institutions after 1883, and up to that xii:3   date, hers was the only College of this character which         had been established in the United States, where         Christian Science was first introduced.  xii:6   During seven years over four thousand students         were taught by the author in this College. Meanwhile         she was pastor of the first established Church of xii:9   Christ, Scientist; President of the first Christian Sci-         entist Association, convening monthly; publisher of         her own works; and (for a portion of this time) sole xii:12  editor and publisher of the Christian Science Journal,         the first periodical issued by Christian Scientists. She         closed her College, October 29, 1889, in the height of xii:15  its prosperity with a deep-lying conviction that the         next two years of her life should be given to the prep-         aration of the revision of SCIENCE AND HEALTH, which xii:18  was published in 1891.

CHAPTER I - PRAYER          For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this         mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and         shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those         things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have         whatsoever he saith. Therefore I say unto you, What things         soever ye desire when ye pray, believe that ye receive them,         and ye shall have them.         Your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask         Him. - CHRIST JESUS.  1:1     THE prayer that reforms the sinner and heals the         sick is an absolute faith that all things are 1:3     possible to God,- a spiritual understanding of Him,         an unselfed love. Regardless of what another may say         or think on this subject, I speak from experience. 1:6     Prayer, watching, and working, combined with self-im-         molation, are God's gracious means for accomplishing         whatever has been successfully done for the Christian- 1:9     ization and health of mankind.          Thoughts unspoken are not unknown to the divine         Mind. Desire is prayer; and no loss can occur from 1:12    trusting God with our desires, that they may be         moulded and exalted before they take form in words         and in deeds.                                Right motives  2:1     What are the motives for prayer? Do we pray to         make ourselves better or to benefit those who hear us, 2:3     to enlighten the infinite or to be heard of         men? Are we benefited by praying? Yes,         the desire which goes forth hungering after righteous- 2:6     ness is blessed of our Father, and it does not return         unto us void.                             Deity unchangeable          God is not moved by the breath of praise to do more 2:9     than He has already done, nor can the infinite do less         than bestow all good, since He is unchang-         ing wisdom and Love. We can do more for 2:12    ourselves by humble fervent petitions, but the All-lov-         ing does not grant them simply on the ground of lip-         service, for He already knows all.  2:15    Prayer cannot change the Science of being, but it         tends to bring us into harmony with it. Goodness at-         tains the demonstration of Truth. A request that 2:18    God will save us is not all that is required. The mere         habit of pleading with the divine Mind, as one pleads         with a human being, perpetuates the belief in God as 2:21    humanly circumscribed,- an error which impedes spirit-         ual growth.                               God's standard          God is Love. Can we ask Him to be more? God is 2:24    intelligence. Can we inform the infinite Mind of any-         thing He does not already comprehend?         Do we expect to change perfection? Shall 2:27    we plead for more at the open fount, which is pour-         ing forth more than we accept? The unspoken desire         does bring us nearer the source of all existence and 2:30    blessedness.          Asking God to /be/ God is a vain repetition. God is         \"the same yesterday, and to-day, and forever;\" and 3:1     He who is immutably right will do right without being         reminded of His province. The wisdom of man is not 3:3     sufficient to warrant him in advising God.                          The spiritual mathematics          Who would stand before a blackboard, and pray the         principle of mathematics to solve the problem? The 3:6     rule is already established, and it is our         task to work out the solution. Shall we         ask the divine Principle of all goodness to do His own 3:9     work? His work is done, and we have only to avail         ourselves of God's rule in order to receive His bless-         ing, which enables us to work out our own salvation.  3:12    The Divine Being must be reflected by man, - else         man is not the image and likeness of the patient,         tender, and true, the One \"altogether lovely;\" but to 3:15    understand God is the work of eternity, and demands         absolute consecration of thought, energy, and desire.                            Prayerful ingratitude          How empty are our conceptions of Deity! We admit 3:18    theoretically that God is good, omnipotent, omni-         present, infinite, and then we try to give         information to this infinite Mind. We plead 3:21    for unmerited pardon and for a liberal outpouring of         benefactions. Are we really grateful for the good         already received? Then we shall avail ourselves of the 3:24    blessings we have, and thus be fitted to receive more.         Gratitude is much more than a verbal expression of         thanks. Action expresses more gratitude than speech.  3:27    If we are ungrateful for Life, Truth, and Love, and         yet return thanks to God for all blessings, we are in-         sincere and incur the sharp censure our Master pro- 3:30    nounces on hypocrites. In such a case, the only         acceptable prayer is to put the finger on the lips and         remember our blessings. While the heart is far from 4:1     divine Truth and Love, we cannot conceal the ingrati-         tude of barren lives.                            Efficacious petitions  4:3     What we most need is the prayer of fervent desire         for growth in grace, expressed in patience, meekness,         love, and good deeds. To keep the com- 4:6     mandments of our Master and follow his         example, is our proper debt to him and the only         worthy evidence of our gratitude for all that he has 4:9     done. Outward worship is not of itself sufficient to         express loyal and heartfelt gratitude, since he has         said: \"If ye love me, keep my commandments.\"  4:12    The habitual struggle to be always good is unceas-         ing prayer. Its motives are made manifest in the         blessings they bring,- blessings which, even if not 4:15    acknowledged in audible words, attest our worthiness         to be partakers of Love.                           Watchfulness requisite          Simply asking that we may love God will never 4:18    make us love Him; but the longing to be better         and holier, expressed in daily watchful-         ness and in striving to assimilate more of 4:21    the divine character, will mould and fashion us         anew, until we awake in His likeness. We reach the         Science of Christianity through demonstration of the 4:24    divine nature; but in this wicked world goodness         will \"be evil spoken of,\" and patience must bring         experience.                             Veritable devotion  4:27    Audible prayer can never do the works of spiritual         understanding, which regenerates; but silent prayer,         watchfulness, and devout obedience enable 4:30    us to follow Jesus' example. Long prayers,         superstition, and creeds clip the strong pinions of love,         and clothe religion in human forms. Whatever mate- 5:1     rializes worship hinders man's spiritual growth and keeps         him from demonstrating his power over error.                           Sorrow and reformation  5:3     Sorrow for wrong-doing is but one step towards reform         and the very easiest step. The next and great step re-         quired by wisdom is the test of our sincerity, 5:6     - namely, reformation. To this end we are         placed under the stress of circumstances. Temptation         bids us repeat the offence, and woe comes in return for 5:9     what is done. So it will ever be, till we learn that there         is no discount in the law of justice and that we must pay         \"the uttermost farthing.\" The measure ye mete \"shall 5:12    be measured to you again,\" and it will be full \"and run-         ning over.\"          Saints and sinners get their full award, but not always 5:15    in this world. The followers of Christ drank his cup.         Ingratitude and persecution filled it to the brim; but God         pours the riches of His love into the understanding and 5:18    affections, giving"]]]
