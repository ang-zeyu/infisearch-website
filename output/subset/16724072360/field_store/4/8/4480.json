Heaven's gold love is, though mixt with earth's alloy-- Dross, that betimes a needful part doth play In nature's wise and true economy.  Love dies not--'t is love's seeming that dissolves, Low to its serpent level, native dust,                           110 A grave unmemoried in lethean ground[7]. The while see heaven-born, heaven-aspiring love, Immortal spirit of the universe, Soaring past sun and stars to worlds unknown! Heir to herself, a self-succeeding queen, Still regnant on life's throne when life is o'er.  O thou, of beauty[8], loveliest form and phase! Kindler and keeper of the quenchless flame! Partner and peer of human majesty! Sharing with him life's dual sovereignty,                        120 Well canst thou wait for thrones and diadems. Queen of the future, Eve of coming worlds, Mother of spirits that shall people stars, And hail thee empress of a universe!  No more I deemed of crowning consequence, That mortal clay to mortal eye should shine; That human mites should shout and sing in praise Each of the other's midget mightiness-- A molecule, by atoms glorified!  Apple of ashes[9] to the longing lip!                            130 Brine to the burning throat and thirsting soul! Phantom, delusion, misty ghost of fame! Voidest and vainest of all vanities!  \"Be not beguiled!\" A vibrant thunder note, Pealing from clouds that canopied my life, The warning, lightning-winged to purify, Up-kindling all the summits of the soul. \"Be not beguiled; not what men think and say, But what God sees and knows, is what avails.  \"Who knoweth aught, unknowing of the all?                        140 Unknowing all, who knoweth perfectly 'Twixt small and great, 'twixt failure and success, 'Twixt heights of glory and the gulfs of shame? What cares eternity for time's decrees? Defeat hath oft deserved the conqueror's crown; Dishonor worn the wreath of victory.  \"Greatness--is it to loom 'mid glittering show? Goes power but hand in hand with prominence? Largeness or littleness, or high or low, Has but to breathe, and straightway he is known.                 150 What speech conceals, the spirit manifests.  \"Fame, place, and title find a fitting use, And rightfully demand all reverence due. But envy not the empty lot of him Who, winning without merit, wins in vain.  \"Greatness, true greatness, mightiness of mind, And greater greatness, grandeur of the soul, Tell but one tale--capacity, not place; Capacity, whose sire, experience, Whose ancestors, innate intelligence,                            160 Original, inborn nobility, As oft in hut as mansion have their home.  \"'Tis not the crowning that creates the king. Man's proper place where God hath need of him.  \"Naught can be vain that leadeth unto light; Struggle and stress, not plaudit, maketh strong; Victor and vanquished equally may win[10], Climbing far heights, where fame, eternal fame, White as the gleaming cloak of Arctic hills, Rests as a mantle, fadeless, faultless, pure,                    170 On loftiest lives, whose snowy peaks, sun-crowned, Receive but to dispense their blessedness.  \"Eternal life demands a selfless love. Hampered by pride, greed, hate, what soul can grow[11]? Conceive a selfish God! Thou canst not, man! Then let it shame thee unto higher things. Who strives for self hates other men's success; Who seeks God's glory welcomes rivalry. Seeking, not gift, but Giver, thou shalt find No sacrifice but changes part for whole.                         180  \"Fare on, full sure that greatest glory comes, And swiftest growth, from serving humankind. Toil on, for toil is treasure, thine for aye; A pauper he who boasts an empty name.\"  So spake the Spirit of the Infinite[12]. The Messenger and Mind of Holy Twain.  Some men I found embodiments of all The goodness, all the greatness, I had dreamed; Men seeming gods, bestowing benefits As suns their beams, as seas and skies their showers.            190 Others as dwarfs, as despots, by compare, Devoured with greed, consumed with jealousy.  But truth taught charity, gave me to see, As face to face one sees familiar friend, Why men are not alike in magnitude.  Some souls, than others, have more summits climbed, More light absorbed, more moral might evolved. Dowered are they with wealth from earlier spheres; Hence wiser, worthier, than those they lead Through precept's vale, up steep example's height,               200 To where love, beauty, wealth, power, glory, reign.  While some, innately noble, are borne down By weight of weaknesses inherited, By passions fierce, propensities depraved, Malific legacy of centuries, That much of their true worthiness obscures, While spirit strives with flesh for mastery, For higher culture and for added might.  And yet anon such souls effulgent shine-- As bursts the April beam through banks of cloud--                210 In glory from which envy shades its eyes, While stands detraction staring, stricken dumb; The glory of a great intelligence, Which mortal mists can dim but for a time.  Spirits, like stars, still differ in degree, And cannot show an even excellence, Unequal in their first nobility. Great tells of greater--littleness of less; Time's hills and vales[13] but type eternity.  Truth taught me more, but bade me silent be;                     220 And I had teachers else--toil, prayer, and pain, With days and nights of misery's martyrdom, Alone and lorn in grief's Gethsemane: Till storm above, and earthquake underneath, Shook down thought's prison house, broke bolt and bar, And agony set inspiration free.  'Tis thus the Great Musician tunes the harp That He would strike--strikes thus the harp in tune; Sweeping with sorrow's hand the quivering strings, That they may cry aloud, and haply sound                         230 A loftier and more enduring lay.     CANTO TWO  The Soul of Song[1]     Alone my soul upon a mighty hill,   Ancient with lingering snows of vanished years,   Where towering forms the templed azure fill,   Wooed by the breath of woodland atmospheres;   Where Nature, throned in solitude, reveres   The God whose glory she doth symbolize,   And on these altars, watered by her tears,   Spreads far around the fragrant sacrifice Whose incense wafts her sweet memorial to the skies.             240    Here will I rest, where I have loved to roam,   From childhood's rose-hued, scarce-remembered day,   And found my pensive soul's congenial home   Far from the depths where human passions play.   Born at their feet, my own have learned to stray   Familiar o'er these pathless heights, and feel,   As now, the mind assume a loftier sway,   Soaring for themes that o'er its summits steal, Beyond all thought to reach, all utterance to reveal.    Here let me linger. O my native hills!                         250   Solemn and watchful o'er the silent waste!   How great the joy his bounding bosom thrills,   Whose steps, aspiring, mar your summits chaste!   Language! thy richest robe, thy rarest taste,   How clothe description in befitting dress,   When halts imagination's wing√©d haste,   Awe-spelled in wonder's conscious littleness, Where loom the cloud-crowned monarchs of the wilderness?    Grim, storm-plumed guardians! Warriors tempest-mailed,   Federal with freedom, fortressing her land!                    260   Had primal man the sacred garden[2] tilled,   'Ere earthly scenes your early vision scanned?   In spirit form took ye your titan stand[3],   Ere rolled a world-creating fiat forth?   Or came ye at convulsion's fierce command,   'Mid loud-tongued thunders bursting from the earth, The martial music that proclaimed your war-like birth?    Vast, voiceless oracles, whose intelligence   Sleeps in the caverns of each stony heart,   Yet breathes o'er all a boundless eloquence,                   270   What wealth historic might your words impart!   Lone, looming, hermit of the hills, apart   From where thy banded mates in union dwell!   A master lyrist seemingly thou art,   Chief harper of a host that round thee swell; And thine the Orphean boon[4], what could withstand thy spell?    E'en now it whispers from the graven rock,   Scribed with the lightning's pen, in sculpture bold,   Defying time and tide and tempest shock,   Frowning where seas and centuries have rolled.                 280   \"Oh were my words[5] thus writ!\" That sage of old,   Knew he not well, ye mighty tomes of clay,   How firm the trust your flinty page might hold?   Have ye not scorned the fiats of decay? Are ye not standing now where nations passed away?    Thrice wondrous things, once thine to wisely scan,   Fast as thy frozen snow-crown, still in store,   Hadst thou the melting gift[6]--of sovereign man   The sunlike glory--mightest thou restore,   Till learning's tide o'erwhelmed the shining shore,            290   With rich revealings of lost realms that rose   And fell like frost-hewn flowers thy face before;   Blightings which brought them an untimely close-- Perchance, of spirit lore, some mystic mine disclose.    But like the laboring brain that burns to speak   Mind's inmost thought, in deepest dungeon pent;   Or liker still to inward boiling peak   Of fires volcanic, vainly seeking vent   Where adamantine bolts and bars prevent;--   Thou'rt doomed to utter stillness, and shalt keep              300   The burden of thy bearing till is rent   Yon heavenly veil, and earth and air and deep Tell secrets that shall rouse the dead from solemn sleep.    And must I be as mute, O silent mount!   Muse of all Melody, shall I not sing?--   Burst these dumb bars, when e'en yon babbling fount   May find in every breeze a wafting wing,   Afar its lightest murmured word to fling?   Where art thou, ancient Soul of Solemn Song?   Asleep? Then wake! Wherefore art slumbering?                   310   The world hath need of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37718"],["title","Elias: An Epic of the Ages (#2)"],["body","hee, and waiteth long. Strike, strike again thy harp, and thrill the listening throng!    Thus musing, lone upon a beetling brow,   Quaffing from unseen fount, those wilds among,   The spirit of the sun-kissed torrent flow,   Methought some lofty, caverned cliff had rung   With echoings of a more than mortal tongue;   Though softly clear the mournful cadence broke,   As notes from off the weird-toned viol flung.   Or was it yon lone cloud that muttering spoke,                 320 Heralding the storm king's wrathful shout and shivering stroke?    Amazed I listened. Did I more than dream?   Had random word aroused unhoped reply?   Or was it sound whose import did but seem?   Hark!--for again it rolls along the sky:   \"Then question hast thou none? Or none wouldst ply,   Save to thy soul in meditative strain,   Or heedless winds that wander idly by?   So be it; still to me thy purpose plain, Thy hidden wish revealed, nor thus revealed in vain.\"            330    While freshening waves of woodland-scented air   Widened the spell of that immortal tone;   While, as on threshold of a lion's lair,   Speechless I stood, as stricken into stone;   Methought the sun with lessening splendor shone,   As if that wandering cloud obscured his gaze.   Then burst the glory from his midday throne!   Turning, mine eye beheld, in rapt amaze, What memory ne'er would lose were life of endless days.    A stately form, of giant stature tall;                         340   Of hoary aspect, venerable and grave;   Whose curling locks and beard of copious fall   Vied the white foam of ocean's storm-whipt wave.   The firm-fixt eye flashed lightnings from its cave;   Far-darting penetration's gaze combined   With wisdom's milder light. Of study gave   Deep evidence that brow by learning lined, Thought's towering throne, where ruled his realm a monarch        mind.    The spirit's garb--for spirit so he seemed--                   350   Fell radiant in many a flowing fold;   A robe antique, by modern limners deemed   Befitting monk or eremite of old.   Head, hands, and feet were bare; the presence bold   With majesty, e'en as a god might wear,   While condescending to a mortal mould.   He spake--the voice no longer thrilled with fear; Like some vast organ swell, it charmed, enchained, the ear.    \"Long have I watched and waited, but no sound   Broke the wild stillness of this stern abode,                  360   Save thunder's fiery foot-print smote the ground,   Or far beneath some torrent's fury flowed;   Anon the screaming eagle past me rode;   The seeker after gold, with toilsome stride,   And eager eye to fix the shining lode,   Hath paused and panted on the hill's steep side; But none, for greater things, till now have hither hied.    \"And thou, O pensive crier in the waste,   Invoker of the Voice now visible!   Prepared art thou a mystery to taste,                          370   Whose fruit is joy or woe ineffable?   Pluck not of wisdom's branches bending full,   Drink not of that divine philosophy,   Save thou canst bravely suffer wrong's misrule,   Thy best intent thought ill; save thou canst be What men deem \"fool,\" real fools despising, pitying thee.    \"Not all my ministry to lift the gloom   Yet hovering o'er this mystic hemisphere.   List while I tell, for I am one by whom   Future and past as present shall appear.                       380   In me behold Messiah's Minister,   Ancient of time and of eternity,   Spirit of song that moved the Hebrew seer,   Voice of the stars[7] ere earth's nativity; Exile, for ages gone, of mortal minstrelsy.    \"See now my sacred heritage, the prey   Of ribald rhymesters, sensuous, half obscene;   Of gloating censors, glad o'er my decay,   And deeming all but best I ne'er had been!   The body's bard[8] throned, sceptering the scene,              390   A groveling worshiper of earth and time.   Arise! and with thy soul's celestial sheen,   Shame these false meteors, change the ruling chime; My minstrel, I thy muse, sing thou the song sublime!    \"Sing, poet, sing! but not of new--of old,   Of old and new--eternal truth thy theme,   That holdeth past and future in her fold,   That maketh present but a passing dream,   While time and earth and man as trifles seem;   That knoweth not of new, or old, or strange;                   400   Whose everduring, all-redemptive scheme,   Fixt and immutable 'mid worlds of change, On, on, from universe to universe doth range.    \"Faint not, nor fear, for all shall fare thy way--   My way, His way, the Master's, evermore.   East shall seem West, rethrown the rising ray,   Shining afar from this most ancient shore[9],   And man shall rise[10] e'en where man fell before.   Fools may deride, may jeer at destiny;   They mock to mourn, oblivion earths them o'er;                 410   While they that champion truth, by truth shall be Exalted, e'en in time, to live eternally.\"    The ancient paused, and, unperceived till then,   A wondrous harp his bosom swung before,   Such harp as played the shepherd psalmist[11] when   A maddening rage his monarch seized and tore,   And music's magic quelled satanic power.   Seated, his form against the crag reclined,   He waved me to his feet, and forth did pour,   As pours Niagara on the plaintive wind,                        420 Floods of majestic song, falling from mind to mind.    Full tale of wonders told, I may not tell,   Though mind be heir to all of mystery;   With milk of truth the breasts of wisdom swell,   Sufficing past and present infancy.   But matching all the modern eye may see   With marvels promised to the future sight,   'Twas as the shrub unto the sheltering tree,   The floating swan unto the eagle's flight, The hillock to the snow-crowned summit, lost in light.           430    Silent he towered above me, harp in hand,--   Was it a dream? Could dream so vivid be?--   And with his mantle's fold my forehead fanned.   Then leapt to life the flame of poesy!   Was it a vision of my destiny?   Upon the mount, as erst, I stood alone,   And naught was there of muse or minstrelsy;   Save that afar still trembled that strange tone, And something said within: \"That harp is now thine own.\"     CANTO THREE  Elect of Elohim[1]   Sing I a song of aeons gone,                                     440     Of life from mystery sprung, Ere sun, or moon, or rolling stars     Their radiance earthward flung; Ere spirit-winged intelligence     Forsook those shining spheres. Exceeding glory there to gain     Through mortal toil and tears.  A song they learn whose lives eterne     Transcend yon twinkling night, Pale Olea's silver beam[2] outsoar,                              450     Shinea's golden flight; Passing the angel sentries by,     Mounting o'er stars and suns, To where the orbs that govern burn,     Royal and regnant ones.  Declare, O Muse of mightier wing,     Of loftier lore, than mine! Why God is God, and man may be     Both human and divine; Why Sons of God, 'mid sons of men,                               460     Unrecognized may dwell, So masked in dense mortality     That none their truth can tell.  From worlds afar, from heavenmost star,     Heard I, or seemed to hear, A sweet refrain, as summer rain,     A cadence soft and clear. A voice, a harp,--Was it the same?--     Harping those harps among, Leading the lyric universe,                                      470     On those high hills of song?  In solemn council sat the Gods;     From Kolob's height supreme, Celestial light blazed forth afar     O'er countless kokaubeam; And faintest tinge, the fiery fringe     Of that resplendent day, 'Lumined the dark abysmal realm     Where earth in chaos lay.  Silence. That awful hour was one                                 480     When thought doth most avail; Of worlds unborn the destiny     Hung trembling in the scale. Silence self-spelled, and there arose,     Those kings and priests among, A power sublime, than whom appeared     None nobler 'mid the throng.  A stature mingling strength with grace,     Of meek though godlike mien; The glory of whose countenance                                   490     Outshone the noonday sheen. Whiter his hair than ocean spray,     Or frost of alpine hill. He spake;--attention grew more grave,     The stillness e'en more still.  \"Father!\" the voice like music fell,     Clear as the murmuring flow Of mountain streamlet trickling down     From heights of virgin snow. \"Father,\" it said, \"since one must die,                          500     Thy children to redeem From spheres all formless now and void,     Where pulsing life shall teem;  \"And mighty Michael[3] foremost fall,     That mortal man may be; And chosen saviour Thou must send,     Lo, here am I--send me! I ask, I seek no recompense,     Save that which then were mine; Mine be the willing sacrifice,                                   510     The endless glory Thine!  \"Give me to lead to this lorn world,     When wandered from the fold, Twelve legions of the noble ones     That now Thy face behold; Tried souls[4], 'mid untried spirits found,     That captained these may be, And crowned the dispensations all     With powers of Deity.  \"Who blameless bide the spirit state,                            520     Clothe them in mortal clay, The stepping-stone[5] to glories all,     If man will God obey, Believing where he cannot see,     Till he again shall know, And answer give, reward receive,     For all deeds done below.  \"The love that hath redeemed all worlds[6]     All worlds must still redeem; But mercy cannot justice rob--                                   530     Or where were Elohim? Freedom--man's faith, man's work, God's grace--     Must span the great gulf o'er; Life, death, the guerdon or the doom,     Rejoice we or deplore.\"  Still rang that voice, when sudden rose     Aloft a towering form, Proudly erect as lowering peak     'Lumed by the gathering storm; A presence bright and beautiful,                                 540"]]]
