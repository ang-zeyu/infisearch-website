On the twenty-fourth of January we left Nohcacab. It was a great relief to bid farewell to this place, and the only regret attending our departure was the reflection that we should be obliged to return. The kindness and attentions of the padrecito and his brother, and, indeed, of all the villagers, had been unremitted, but the fatigue of riding twelve miles every day over the same ground, and the difficulty of procuring Indians to work, were a constant source of annoyance; besides which, we had a feeling that operated during the whole of our journey: wherever we were taken ill we became disgusted with the place, and were anxious to leave it.  We were setting out on a tour which, according to the plan laid out, embraced a circuit of ruins, and required us to revisit Nohcacab, although our return would be only to make it a point of departure in another direction.  In consequence of this plan we left behind all our heavy luggage, and carried with us only the Daguerreotype apparatus, hammocks, one large box containing our tin table service, a candlestick, bread, chocolate, coffee, and sugar, and a few changes of clothing in pestaquillas. Besides Albino and Bernaldo we had a puny lad of about fifteen, named Barnaby, a much smaller pattern than either of the others, and all three together were hardly equal in bulk to one fairly developed man.  We were all provided with good horses for the road. Mr. Catherwood had one on which he could make a sketch without dismounting; Dr. Cabot could shoot from the back of his. Mine could, on an emergency, be pushed into a hard day's journey for a preliminary visit. Albino rode a hard-mouthed, wilful beast, which shook him constantly like a fit of the fever and ague, and which we distinguished by the name of the trotter. Bernaldo asked for a horse, because Albino had one, but, instead of riding, he had to put a strap across his forehead and carry his own luggage on his back.  We were about entering a region little or not at all frequented by white men, and occupied entirely by Indians. Our road lay through the ruins of Kabah, a league beyond which we reached the rancho of Chack. This was a large habitation of Indians, under the jurisdiction of the village of Nohcacab. There was not a white man in the place, and as we rode through, the women snatched up their children, and ran from us like startled deer. I rode up to a hut into which I saw a woman enter, and, stopping at the fence, merely from curiosity, took out a cigar, and, making use of some of the few Maya words we had picked up, asked for a light, but the door remained shut. I dismounted, and before I had tied my horse the women rushed out and disappeared among the bushes. In one part of the rancho was a casa real, being a long thatched hut with a large square before it, protected by an arbour of leaves, and on one side was a magnificent seybo tree, throwing its shade to a great distance round.  On leaving this rancho we saw at a distance on the left a high ruined building standing alone amid a great intervening growth of woods, and apparently inaccessible. Beyond, and at the distance of four leagues from Nohcacab, we reached the rancho of Schawill, which was our first stopping-place, on account of the ruins of Zayi in its immediate neighbourhood. This place also was inhabited exclusively by Indians, rancho being the name given to a settlement not of sufficient importance to constitute a village. The casa real, like that at Chack, was a large hut, with mud walls and a thatched roof. It had an open place in front about a hundred feet square, enclosed by a fence made of poles, and shaded by an arbour of palm leaves. Around the hut were large seybo trees. The casa real is erected in every rancho of Indians expressly for the reception of the cura on his occasional or perhaps barely possible visits, but it is occupied also by small dealers from the villages, who sometimes find their way to these ranchos to buy up hogs, maize, and fowls. The hut, when swept out, and comparatively clear of fleas, made a large and comfortable apartment, and furnished ample swinging room for six hammocks, being the number requisite for our whole retinue.  This place was under the parochial charge of our friend the cura of Ticul, who, however, owing to the multiplicity of his other occupations, had visited it but once. The padrecito had sent notice of our coming, and had charged the people to be in readiness to receive us. Immediately on our arrival, therefore, Indians were at hand to procure ramon for the horses, but there was no water. The rancho had no well, and was entirely dependant on that of Chack, three miles distant. For two reals, however, the Indians undertook to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33137"],["title","Descriptions of Three New Birds from the Belgian Congo (#1)"],["body","(culmen from base) 18.5-21 mm.; wing 117.5-128; tail 146.5-166. The green borders of the secondaries are never very well marked, and sometimes virtually absent.  Seven females from the same region measure: Bill, 18.5-21; Wing 117.5-129; Tail, 149-169.  One male collected in the Uele District, in a small forest tract between Faradje and Aba, is strikingly larger; wing, 134; tail 194. This example is probably referable to _A. n. narina_.   =Ceriocleptes= gen. nov. (Indicatoridæ).       Resembling _Indicator_ in its bill and general form, save for the      tail, which is composed of 12 quills, the two middle pairs of      nearly equal length, somewhat pointed and curved strongly      outwards, the next pair considerably shorter, but also pointed      and slightly curved; while the fourth, fifth and sixth are      straight, greatly narrowed, and stiffened, becoming successively      shorter, so that the outermost pair is not half so long as the      median. The tail-coverts are unusually long, those below as long      as the longest rectrices, and projecting in the fork of the tail.   =Ceriocleptes xenurus= sp. nov.       Description of type, collector's No. 5628, Congo Exp. A. M. N. H.      [Male] ad., Avakubi, Ituri District, Belgian Congo. Apr. 17,      1914.       Feathers of forehead, crown, back, and rump blackish-brown,      bordered or washed with yellowish-citrine, those of nape and      upper back whitish at the base. Sides of head lighter, shading      gradually to olive-buff on throat, breast, and sides; middle of      abdomen still lighter, ivory-yellow. Upper wing-coverts and      secondaries fuscous-black (freshly molted feathers blacker)      narrowly edged with olive-ocher. Primaries similar, but yellowish      border almost entirely lacking; both primaries and secondaries      fading to pale olive-buff on their inner edges. Under      wing-coverts colored like the breast, but with faint dusky      shaft-streaks. Feathering of flanks ivory-yellow, with strong      blackish median lines. Two middle pairs of rectrices dull      blackish, 3rd pair whitish, with a small blackish spot on the      outer edge close to the tip, and a larger concealed black spot on      the inner web towards the base; the 3 remaining pairs of      rectrices white. The long median pair of under tail-coverts      blackish, the next pair similar, but margined with whitish, the      remainder ivory-yellow with faint shaft-streaks of dark brown.      Upper tail-coverts fuscous-black, bordered with amber-yellow.[1]       The bill, nostril, and feet resemble those of _Indicator      indicator_, but the bill is somewhat stouter, while the wings and      tail are shorter. The 9th (outer) primary is intermediate in      length between the 6th and 5th; the 7th and 8th are longest.       Iris bright brown, naked edges of eyelids grayish-brown; bill      dusky-brown; feet dull grayish-green.       Length (skin), 160 mm.; wing, 93.5; tail 56; bill (culmen from      base), 13.5; metatarsus, 14.  This unique specimen was shot by the describer from a tall tree in the forest, where it was accompanied by one other of its kind. The sexual organs were somewhat enlarged; the stomach filled with beeswax, mixed with small pieces of insects. Apparently this species is not in the habit of leading men to beehives.
