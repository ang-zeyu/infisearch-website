He walked right into the closed door, which failed to open before him, though it had operated smoothly a moment ago.  \"Robots not admitted after dark,\" a mechanical voice informed him. \"Return to your stall in the shed.\"  \"Whom do you think you're talking to?\" demanded Robert. \"I'm not one of your robots!\"  There was a pause.  \"Is it Marcia-Joan?\" asked the voice-box, after considerable buzzing and whirring.  \"No, I'm Robert.\"  There was another pause while the mechanism laboriously shifted back to its other speech tape. Then: \"Robots not admitted after dark. Return to your stall in the shed.\"  Robert slowly raised both hands to his temples. Lingeringly, he dragged them down over his cheeks and under his chin until at last the fingers interlaced over his tight lips. After a moment, he let out his breath between his fingers and dropped his hands to his sides.  He raised one foot to kick, but decided that the door looked too hard.  He walked away between the beds of flowers, grumbling.         *       *       *       *       *  Reaching the vicinity of the cottage, he parted the tall shrubs bordering its grounds and looked through carefully before proceeding. Pleased at the gleam of water, he called Blue Two.  \"Good enough! Put the other robots away for the night. They can trim the edges tomorrow.\"  He started into the cottage, but his major-domo warned, \"Someone comes.\"  Robert looked around. Through thin portions of the shrubbery, he caught a glimpse of Marcia-Joan's crimson robe, nearly black in the diffused glow of the lights illuminating the grounds.  \"Robert!\" called the girl angrily. \"What are your robots doing? I saw them from my upstairs window--\"  \"Wait there!\" exclaimed Robert as she reached the shrubs.  \"What? Are you trying to tell me where I can go or not go? I--YI!\"  The shriek was followed by a tremendous splash. Robert stepped forward in time to be spattered by part of the flying spray. It was cold.  _Naturally, being drawn from the brook_, he reflected. _Oh, well, the sun will warm it tomorrow._  There was a frenzy of thrashing and splashing in the dimly lighted water at his feet, accompanied by coughs and spluttering demands that he \"do something!\"  [Illustration]  Robert reached down with one hand, caught his hostess by the wrist, and heaved her up to solid ground.  \"My robots are digging you a little swimming hole,\" he told her. \"They brought the water from the brook by a trench. You can finish it with concrete or plastics later; it's only fifteen by thirty feet.\"  He expected some sort of acknowledgment of his efforts, and peered at her through the gloom when none was forthcoming. He thus caught a glimpse of the full-swinging slap aimed at his face. He tried to duck.  There was another splash, followed by more floundering about.  \"Reach up,\" said Robert patiently, \"and I'll pull you out again. I didn't expect you to like it this much.\"  Marcia-Joan scrambled up the bank, tugged viciously at her sodden robe, and headed for the nearest pathway without replying. Robert followed along.  As they passed under one of the lights, he noticed that the red reflections of the wet material, where it clung snugly to the girl's body, were almost the color of some of his robots.  _The tennis robot_, he thought, _and the moving targets for archery--in fact, all the sporting equipment._  \"You talk about food for the figure,\" he remarked lightly. \"You should see yourself now! It's really funny, the way--\"  He stopped. Some strange emotion stifled his impulse to laugh at the way the robe clung.  Instead, he lengthened his stride, but he was still a few feet behind when she charged through the front entrance of the house. The door, having opened automatically for her, started to swing closed. Robert sprang forward to catch it.  \"Wait a minute!\" he cried.  Marcia-Joan snapped something that sounded like \"Get out!\" over her shoulder, and squished off toward the stairs. As Robert started through the door to follow, the striped robot hastened toward him from its post in the hall.  \"Do not use the front door!\" it warned him.  \"Out of my way!\" growled Robert.  The robot reached out to enforce the command. Robert seized it by the forearm and put all his weight into a sudden tug. The machine tottered off balance. Releasing his grip, he sent it staggering out the door with a quick shove.         *       *       *       *       *  A hasty glance showed Marcia-Joan flapping wetly up the last steps. Robert turned to face the robot.  \"Do not use that door!\" he quoted vindictively, and the robot halted its rush indecisively. \"Only Marcia-Joan uses it.\"  The major-domo hesitated. After a moment, it strode off around the corner of the house. First darting one more look at the stairs, Robert thrust his head outside and shouted: \"Blue Two!\"  He held the door open while he waited. There was an answer from the shrubbery. Presently, his own supervisor hurried up.  \"Fetch the emergency toolbox!\" Robert ordered. \"And bring a couple of others with you.\"  \"Naturally, Robert. I would not carry it myself.\"  A moment after the robot had departed on the errand, heavy steps sounded at the rear of the hall. Marcia-Joan's robot had dealt with the mechanism of the back door.  Robert eyed the metal mask as the robot walked up to him. He found the color contrast less pleasant than ever.  \"I am not using the door,\" he said hastily. \"I am merely holding it open.\"  \"Do you intend to use it?\"  \"I haven't decided.\"  \"I shall carry you out back,\" the robot decided for him.  \"No, you don't!\" exclaimed Robert, leaping backward.  The door immediately began to swing shut as he passed through.  Cursing, he lunged forward. The robot reached for him.  This time, Robert missed his grip. Before he could duck away, his wrist was trapped in a metal grasp.  _The door will close_, he despaired. _They'll be too late._  Then, suddenly, he felt the portal drawn back and heard Blue Two speak.  \"What does Robert wish?\"  \"Throw this heap out the door!\" gasped Robert.  Amid a trampling of many feet, the major-domo was raised bodily by Blue Two and another pair of Robert's machines and hustled outside. Since the grip on Robert's wrist was not relaxed, he involuntarily accompanied the rush of metal bodies.  \"Catch the door!\" he called to Blue Two.  When the latter sprang to obey, the other two took the action as a signal to drop their burden. The pink-and-blue robot landed full length with a jingling crash. Robert was free.  With the robots, he made for the entrance. Hearing footsteps behind him as the major-domo regained its feet, he slipped hastily inside.  \"Pick up that toolbox!\" he snapped. \"When that robot stops in the doorway, knock its head off!\"  Turning, he held up a finger.  [Illustration]  \"Do not use the front door!\"  The major-domo hesitated.  The heavy toolbox in the grip of Blue Two descended with a thud. The pink-and-blue robot landed on the ground a yard or two outside the door as if dropped from the second floor. It bounced once, emitted a few sparks and pungent wisps of smoke, lay still.  \"Never mind, that's good enough,\" said Robert as Blue Two stepped forward. \"One of the others can drag it off to the repair shop. Have the toolbox brought with us.\"  \"What does Robert wish now?\" inquired Blue Two, trailing the man toward the stairway.  \"I'm going upstairs,\" said Robert. \"And I intend to be prepared if any more doors are closed against me!\"  He started up, the measured treads of his own robots sounding reassuringly behind him....         *       *       *       *       *  It was about a week later that Robert sat relaxed in the armchair before his own telescreen, facing Henry's wizened visage.  The elder man clucked sympathetically as he re-examined the scratches on Robert's face and the bruise under his right eye.  \"And so you left there in the morning?\"  \"I certainly did!\" declared Robert. \"We registered a marriage record at the city library by television, of course, but I don't care if I never see her again. She needn't even tell me about the child, if any. I simply can't stand that girl!\"  \"Now, now,\" Henry said.  \"I mean it! Absolutely no consideration for my wishes. Everything in the house was run to suit her convenience.\"  \"After all,\" Henry pointed out, \"it _is_ her house.\"  Robert glared. \"What has that to do with it? I don't think I was as unreasonable as she said in smashing that robot. The thing just wouldn't let me alone!\"  \"I guess,\" Henry suggested, \"it was conditioned to obey Marcia-Joan, not you.\"  \"Well, that shows you! Whose orders are to count, anyway? When I tell a robot to do something, I expect it done. How would you like to find robots trying to boss you around?\"  \"Are you talking about robots,\" asked Henry, \"or the girl?\"  \"Same thing, isn't it? Or it would be if I'd decided to bring her home with me.\"  \"Conflict of desires,\" murmured Henry.  \"Exactly! It's maddening to have a perfectly logical action interfered with because there's another person present to insist--_insist_, mind you--on having her way.\"  \"And for twenty-odd years, you've had your own way in every tiny thing.\"  Somewhere in the back of Robert's lurked a feeling that Henry sounded slightly sarcastic.  \"Well, why shouldn't I?\" he demanded. \"I noticed that in every disagreement, my view was the right one.\"  \"It was?\"  \"Of course it was! What did you mean by that tone?\"  \"Nothing....\" Henry seemed lost in thought. \"I was just wondering how many 'right' views are left on this planet. There must be quite a few, all different, even if we have picked up only a few by television. An interesting facet of our peculiar culture--every individual omnipotent and omniscient, _within his own sphere_.\"  Robert regarded him with indignant incredulity.  \"You don't seem to understand my point,\" he began again. \"I told her we ought to come to my house,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32780"],["title","Asteroid of Fear (#1)"],["body","over....  Reprieve came presumably by way of the good-sense of the pilot of the space ship. The hold-port was closed abruptly by a mechanism that could be operated only from the main control-board. The rocket jets of the craft emitted a single weak burst of flame. Like a boulder grown agile and flighty, the ship leaped from the landscape, and arced outward toward the stars, to curve around the asteroid and disappear behind the scene's jagged brim. The craft had gone to make its next and final stop--among the air-domes of the huge mining camp on the other side of Vesta--the side of torn rocks and rich radioactive ores.  But before the ship had vanished from sight, John Endlich heard Alf Neely's grim promise in his helmet radiophones: \"We'll be back tonight, Greenhorn. Lots of times we work night-shift--when it's daytime on this side of Vesta. We'll be free. Stick around. I'll rub what's left of you in the dust of your claim!\"  Endlich was alone, then, with the fright in his wife's eyes, the squalling of his children, and his own abysmal disgust and worry.  For once he ceased to be a gentle parent. \"Bubs! Evelyn!\" he snapped. \"Shud-d-d--up-p-p!...\"  The startled silence which ensued was his first personal victory on Vesta. But the silence, itself, was an insidious enemy. It made his ears ring. It made even his audible pulsebeats seemed to ache. It bored into his nerves like a drill. When, after a moment, Rose spoke quaveringly, he was almost grateful:  \"What do we do, Johnny? We've still got to do what we're supposed to do, don't we?\"  Whereupon John Endlich allowed himself the luxury and the slight relief of a torrent of silent cussing inside his head. Damn the obvious questions of women! Damn the miners. Damn the A.H.O.--the Asteroids Homesteaders Office--and their corny slogans and posters, meant to hook suckers like himself! Damn his own dumb hide! Damn the mighty urge to get drunk! Damn all the bitter circumstances that made doing so impossible. Damn! Damn! Damn!  Finished with this orgy, he said meekly: \"I guess so, Hon.\"         *       *       *       *       *  All members of the Endlich family had been looking around them at the weird Vestal landscape. Through John Endlich's mind again there flashed a picture of what this asteroid was like. At the Asteroids Homesteaders' School in Chicago, where his dependents and he had been given several weeks of orientation instruction, suitable to their separate needs, he had been shown diagrams and photographs of Vesta. Later, he had of course seen it from space.  It was not round, like a major planet or most moons. Rather, it was like a bomb-fragment; or even more like a shard of a gigantic broken vase. It was several hundred miles long, and half as thick. One side of it--this side--was curved; for it had been a segment of the surface of the shattered planet from which all of the asteroids had come. The other side was jagged and broken, for it had been torn from the mesoderm of that tortured mother world.  From the desolation of his own thoughts, in which the ogre-form of Alf Neely lurked with its pendent promise of catastrophe soon to come, and from his own view of other desolation all around him, John Endlich was suddenly distracted by the comments of his kids. All at once, conforming to the changeable weather of children's natures regardless of circumstance, their mood had once more turned bright and adventurous.  \"Look, Pop,\" Bubs chirped, his round red face beaming now from his helmet face-window, in spite of his undried tears. \"This land all around here was fields once! You can even see the rows of some kind of stubble! Like corn-stubble! And over there's a--a--almost like a fence! An' up there is hills with trees on 'em--some of 'em not even knocked over. But everything is all dried-out and black and grey and dead! Gosh!\"  \"We can see all that, Dopey!\" Evelyn, who was older, snapped at Bubs. \"We know that something like people lived on a regular planet here, awful long ago. Why don't you look over the other way? There's the house--and maybe the barn and the sheds and the old garden!\"  Bubs turned around. His eyes got very big. \"Oh! O-ooh-h-h!\" he gasped in wonder. \"Pop! Mom! Look! Don't you see?...\"  \"Yeah, we see, Bubs,\" John Endlich answered.  For a long moment he'd been staring at those blocklike structures. One--maybe the house--was of grey stone. It had odd, triangular windows, which may once have been glazed. Some of the others were of a blackened material--perhaps cellulose. Wood, that is. All of the buildings were pushed askew, and partly crumpled from top to bottom, like great cardboard cartons that had been half crushed.  Endlich's imagination seemed forced to follow a groove, trying to picture that last terrible moment, fifty-million years ago. Had the blast been caused by natural atomic forces at the heart of the planet, as one theory claimed? Or had a great bomb, as large as an oversized meteor, come self-propelled from space, to bury itself deep in that ancient world? A world as big as Mars, its possible enemy--whose weird inhabitants had been wiped out, in a less spectacular way, perhaps in the same conflict?  Endlich's mind grabbed at that brief instant of explosion. The awful jolt, which must have ended all consciousness, and all capacity for eyes to see what followed. Perhaps there was a short and terrible passing of flame. But in swift seconds, great chunks of the planet's crust must have been hurled outward. In a moment the flame must have died, dissipated with the suddenly vanishing atmosphere, into the cold vacuum of the void. Almost instantly, the sky, which had been deep blue before, must have turned to its present black, with the voidal stars blazing. There had been no air left to sustain combustion, so buildings and trees had not continued to burn, if there had been time at all to ignite them. And, with the same swiftness, all remaining artifacts and surface features of this chip of a world's crust that was Vesta, had been plunged into the dual preservatives of the interplanetary regions--deep-freeze and all but absolute dryness. Yes--the motion of the few scattered molecules in space was very fast--indicating a high temperature. But without substance to be hot, there can be no heat. And so few molecules were there in the void, that while the concept of a \"hot\" space remained true, it became tangled at once with the fact that a _practically_ complete vacuum can have _practically_ no temperature. Which meant--again in practice--all but absolute zero.  John Endlich knew. He'd heard the lectures at the Homesteaders' School. Here was a ghost-land, hundreds of square miles in extent--a region that had been shifted in a few seconds, from the full prime of life and motion, to moveless and timeless silence. It was like the mummy of a man. In its presence there was a chill, a revulsion, and yet a fascination.         *       *       *       *       *  The kids continued to jabber--more excitedly now than before. \"Pop! Mom!\" Bubs urged. \"Let's go look inside them buildings! Maybe the _things_ are still there! The people, I mean. All black and dried up, like the one in the showcase at school; four tentacles they had instead of arms and legs, the teacher said!\"  \"Sure! Let's go!\" Evelyn joined in. \"I'm not scared to!\"  Yeah, kids' tastes could be pretty gruesome. When you thought most that you had to shelter them from horror, they were less bothered by it than you were. John Endlich's lips made a sour line.  \"Stay here, the pair of you!\" Rose ordered.  \"Aw--Mom--\" Evelyn began to protest.  \"You heard me the first time,\" their mother answered.  John Endlich moved to the great box, which had come with them from Earth. The nervous tension that tore at him--unpleasant and chilling, driving him toward straining effort--was more than the result of the shameful and embarrassing memory of his very recent trouble with Alf Neely and Companions, and the certainty of more trouble to come from that source. For there was another and even worse enemy. Endlich knew what it was--  The awful silence.  He still looked shamefaced and furious; but now he felt a gentler sharing of circumstances. \"We'll let the snooping go till later, kids,\" he growled. \"Right now we gotta do what we gotta do--\"  The youngsters seemed to join up with his mood. As he tore the pinchbar, which had been conveniently attached to the side of the box, free of its staples, and proceeded to break out supplies, their whimsical musings fell close to what he was thinking.  \"Vesta,\" Evelyn said. \"They told us at school--remember? Vesta was the old Roman goddess of hearth and home. Funny--hunh--Dad?\"  Bubs' fancy was vivid, too. \"Look, Pop!\" he said again, pointing to a ribbon of what might be concrete, cracked and crumpled as by a terrific quake, curving away toward the hills, and the broken mountains beyond. \"That was a road! Can't you almost hear some kinda cars and trucks goin' by?\"  John Endlich's wife, helping him open the great box, also had things to say, in spite of the worry showing in her face. She touched the dessicated soil with a gauntleted hand. \"Johnny,\" she remarked wonderingly. \"You can see the splash-marks of the last rain that ever fell here--\"  \"Yeah,\" Endlich growled without any further comment. Inside himself, he was fighting the battle of lost things. The blue sky. The shifting beauty of clouds in sunshine. The warm whisper of wind in trees. The rattle of traffic. The babble of water. The buzz of insects. The smell of flowers. The sight of grass waving.... In short, all the evidences of life.  \"A lot of things that was here once, we'll bring back, won't we, Pop?\" Bubs questioned with astonishing maturity.  \"Hope so,\" John Endlich answered, keeping his doubts hidden behind gruffness. Maybe it was a grim joke that here and now every force in himself was concentrated on substantial objectives--to the exclusion of his defects. The drive in him was to end the maddening"]]]
