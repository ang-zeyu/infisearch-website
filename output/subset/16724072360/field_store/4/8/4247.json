The fossil species, _C. timida_, with a length of 160 mm., has the width amounting to 75 per cent of the length, and _C. limnodytes_, with an estimated length of 180 mm., has the width amounting to 80.5 per cent of the length. _C. timida_ is widest anteriorly, whereas _C. limnodytes_ and the other species of the genus are widest posteriorly. Less obvious differences between the two fossils are the narrower anterior margin of the nuchal, the concave anterior end of the carapace, the sculptured surface of the carapace, and the relatively wider neurals and longer vertebrals of _C. limnodytes_.

However, any resemblance to _Pseudemys_ is not to be considered as evidence that _C. limnodytes_ is in any way ancestral to the genus _Pseudemys_. The fossil specimens of _Pseudemys_ from the Pliocene are too poorly known to allow the student certainly to place them in their correct systematic positions. The fossil Emydids from Western Europe, listed as species of _Chrysemys_, differ very much from this species, or belong to other genera of the family.  Only a few turtles are known from the Laverne formation. Hesse (Chaney and Elias, 1936) reported a small _Testudo_ from the Laverne of Beaver County, Oklahoma, but neglected to state whether it was among the material borrowed by him from the University of Kansas Museum of Natural History. The Museum has an incomplete carapace and plastron (No. 3101) of a small _Testudo_ from that locality and formation. In Harper County, Oklahoma, the field party from the University recovered a large number of fragments of a large _Testudo_. Although this specimen is as yet unprepared, enough fragments have been pieced together to reveal that the tibia is 127 mm. long. This dimension and those of some of the fragments indicate that the animal may have been four to five feet long.  Mrs. Bernita Mansfield of the Geology Department, University of Kansas, prepared the plate.     LITERATURE CITED   BERGOUNIOUX, FREDERIC-MARIE.    1935.

There ain't many rooms with a bath left.\"  Hetherington flushed. He had intended to greet the sergeant with his most imposing manner, but this turkey-red abomination on his back had thrust dignity out in the cold.  \"I have come, officer,\" he said, as impressively as he could under the circumstances, \"to make some inquiries concerning a man who was brought here about an hour ago--I fear in a state of intoxication.\"  \"We have known such things to happen here, Santa,\" said the officer, suavely. \"In fact, this blotter here seems to indicate that one George W. Hetherington, of 561 Fifth Avenue--\"  \"Who?\" roared Hetherington.  \"George W. Hetherington is the name on the blotter,\" said the sergeant; \"entered first as a D. D., but on investigation found to be suffering from--\"  \"But that's my name!\" cried Hetherington. \"You don't mean to tell me he claimed to be George W. Hetherington?\"  \"No,\" said the sergeant. \"The poor devil didn't make any claims for himself at all. We found that name on a card in his hat, and a letter addressed to the same name in his overcoat pocket. Puttin' the two together we thought it was a good enough identification.\"  \"Well, I'll have you to understand, sergeant--\" bristled Hetherington, cockily.  \"None o' that, Santa Claus--none o' that!\" growled the sergeant, leaning over the desk and eying him coldly. \"I don't know what game you're up to, but just one more peep in that tone and there'll be two George W. Hetheringtons in the cooler this night.\"  Hetherington almost tore the Santa Claus garb from his shoulders, and revealed himself as a personage of fine raiment underneath, whatever he might have appeared at a superficial glance. As he did so a crumpled piece of paper fell to the floor from the pocket of the turkey-red coat.  \"I don't mean to do anything but what is right, sergeant,\" he said, controlling his wrath, \"but what I do want is to impress it upon your mind that _I_ am George W. Hetherington, and that having my name spread on the blotter of a police court isn't going to do me any good. I loaned that fellow my hat and coat to get a square meal, while I took his place--\"  The officer grinned broadly, but with no assurance in his smile that he believed.  \"Oh, you may not believe it,\" said Hetherington, \"but it's true, and if this thing gets into the papers to-morrow morning--\"  \"Say, Larry,\" said the sergeant, addressing an officer off duty, \"did the reporters copy that letter we found in Hetherington's pocket?\"  \"Reporters?\" gasped Hetherington. \"Good Lord, man--yuh-you don't mum-mean to say yuh-you let the reporters--\"  \"No, chief,\" replied Larry. \"They ain't been in yet--I t'ink ye shoved it inter yer desk.\"  \"So I did, so I did,\" grinned the sergeant. Here he opened the drawer in front of him and extracted a pretty little blue envelope which Hetherington immediately recognized as a particularly private and confidential communication from--well, somebody. This is not a _cherchez la femme_ story, so we will leave the lady's name out of it altogether. It must be noted, however, that a sight of that dainty missive in the great red fist of the sergeant gave Hetherington a heart action that fifty packages of cigarettes a day could hardly inflict upon a less healthy man.  \"That's the proof--\" cried Hetherington, excitedly. \"If that don't prove it's my overcoat nothing will.\"  \"Right you are, Santa Claus,\" said the sergeant, opening the envelope and taking out the delicately scented sheet of paper within. \"I'll give you two guesses at the name signed to this, and if you get it right once I'll give you the coat, and Mr. Hetherington Number One in our evening's consignment of Hetheringtons gets re-christened.\"  \"'Anita'!\" growled Hetherington.  \"You win!\" said the sergeant, handing over the letter.  Hetherington drew a long sigh of relief.  \"I guess this is worth cigars for the house, sergeant,\" he said. \"I'll send 'em round to-morrow--meanwhile, how about--how about the other?\"  \"He's gone to the hospital,\" said the sergeant, grimly. \"The doctor says he wasn't drunk--just another case of freezing starvation.\"  \"Starvation? And I guyed him! Great God!\" muttered Hetherington to himself.   III  \"Narrow escape, Mr. Hetherington,\" said the sergeant. \"Ought to be a lesson to you sports. What was your game, anyhow?\"  \"Oh, it wasn't any game--\" began Hetherington.  \"Huh! Just a case of too much lunch, eh?\" said the officer. \"You'd had as much too much as the other feller'd had too little--that it?\"  \"No,\" said Hetherington. \"Just a general lack of confidence in my fellow-men, plus a cussed habit of butting into matters that aren't any of my business; but I'm glad I butted in, just the same, if I can be of any earthly use to that poor devil of a Santa Claus. Do you suppose there's any way to find out who he is?\"  \"Well, we've made a good start, anyhow,\" said the sergeant. \"We've found out who he isn't. When he comes to in the mornin', if he does, maybe he'll be able to help us identify him.\"  \"To-morrow!\" murmured Hetherington. \"And who knows but he's got a family waiting for him somewhere right now, and as badly off as he is.\"  \"Ye dropped this, sir,\" said Larry, the officer off duty. \"It come out of the red coat--mebbe it'll help--\"  He handed Hetherington the crumpled piece of paper that had fallen to the floor when he tore Santa Claus's cloak from his back. It was sadly dirty, but on one side of it was a childish scrawl in pencil. Hetherington ran over it rapidly, and gulped.  \"Read that, sergeant!\" he said, huskily.  The sergeant read the following:      \"DEAR SANDY CLORS:--my Popper says hell hand you this here leter     when he sees you to ast you not to fergit me and jimmy like you     did last yeer. you aint been to see me an jimmy since popper     lost his Jobb and he says its becoz you lost our adres so ime     ritin to tell you weve moved since you come the lass time and am     now livin now on the Topp flor of fore 69 varrick streete noo     york which youd ort not to find it hard to git down the chimbley     bein on the topp flor closte to the roofe so i thort ide rite     and tell you what me and jimmyd like to hav you bring us wenn     you come.

What time is it?\"  \"Seven-thirty,\" replied the sergeant.  \"Good!\" said Hetherington. \"Shops don't close till ten--I guess I've got time. Good night--see you first thing in the morning. Come along, chauffeur, I'll need you for some time yet.\"  \"Good night, Mr. Hetherington,\" said the sergeant. \"Where are you bound in case I need you any time?\"  \"Me?\" said Hetherington with a grin, \"why, my address is 561 Fifth Avenue, but just now I'm off to do my Christmas shopping early.\"  And resuming possession of his own hat and overcoat, and taking the Santa Claus costume under his arm, Hetherington passed out, the chauffeur following.  \"These New York sports is a queer bunch!\" said the sergeant as Hetherington disappeared.   IV  At half-past nine down-town was pretty well deserted, which made it easy for the chauffeur of a certain red taxi-cab to make fairly good time down Broadway; and when at nine-forty-five the panting mechanism drew up before the grim walls of a brick tenement, numbered 469 Varick Street, the man on the box was commendably proud of his record.  \"That was goin' some, sir,\" he said, with a broad grin on his face. \"I don't believe it's ever been done quicker outside o' the fire department.\"  \"I don't believe it has, old man,\" said Hetherington as he alighted. \"Now if you'll help me up-stairs with these packages and that basket there, we'll bring this affair to a grand-stand finish.\"  The two men toiled slowly up the stairs, Hetherington puffing somewhat with the long climb; and when finally they had reached the top floor he arrayed himself in the once despised garb of Santa Claus again. Then he knocked at the door. The answer was immediate. A white-faced woman opened the door.  \"Jim!\" she cried. \"Is it you?\"  \"No, madam,\" replied Hetherington. \"It's a friend of Jim's. Fact is, Mrs. Mulligan, Jim has--\"  \"There's nothin' happened to Jim, has there?\" she interrupted.  \"Nothing at all, madam, nothing at all,\" said Hetherington. \"The work was a little too much for him to-day--that's all--and he keeled over. He's safe, and comfortable in the--well, they took him to the hospital, but don't you worry--he'll be all right in a day or two, and meanwhile I'm going to look after you and the kiddies.\"  The chauffeur placed the basket inside the door.  \"You'll find a small turkey, and some--er--some fixings in it, Mrs. Mulligan,\" said Hetherington. \"Whatever ought to go with a turkey should be there,"]]]
