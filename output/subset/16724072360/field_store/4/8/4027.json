Four of the five specimens taken northwest of Diriamba were shot from a daytime retreat in a culvert; the fifth was caught by hand as it attempted to fly out of a hollow, fallen tree. Two adult females captured on 31 March were pregnant, each carrying a single embryo (13 and 14 mm in crown-rump length), whereas two obtained on 14 August showed no sign of reproductive activity. An adult male, also taken on 14 August, had testes 2 mm in length. Of three additional adult females, one captured on 3 June was pregnant (embryo 21 mm in crown-rump length), whereas two obtained on 14 April evinced no gross reproductive activity.  The subspecies _mexicana_ has not been reported previously from Nicaragua, although Gardner _et al._ (1970:715) recently extended its known distribution southward from Honduras (Goodwin, 1942c:124) and El Salvador (Felten, 1956:180) to west-central Costa Rica. In Nicaragua, as apparently in Costa Rica, _mexicana_ occupies the Pacific versant, the Caribbean lowlands being inhabited by the smaller race, _Micronycteris megalotis microtis_ Miller, 1898 (type locality, Greytown, Nicaragua--reported also from \"Río Coco,\" Nicaragua, by J. A. Allen, 1910:110). Nicaraguan examples of _M. m. mexicana_ are, on the average, considerably larger in cranial dimensions and length of forearm than are specimens of _M. m. microtis_ (see Table 1). The series of _microtis_ from \"Río Coco,\" probably from the headwaters of that stream in the vicinity of San Juan de Río Coco and thus near the divide between Caribbean and Pacific drainages, is intermediate in size between the two subspecies and suggests intergradation between them. As noted also by Gardner _et al._ (1970:715), we find no differences in length of ear between _microtis_ and _mexicana_ (contrary to Miller's claim, in the original description, that _microtis_ had noticeably smaller ears), nor do we note any consistent differences in color between the two races on the basis of the specimens at hand.  Our specimens from Isla del Maíz Grande inexplicably agree rather closely in size (average but slightly smaller) with specimens of _M. m. mexicana_ from western Nicaragua and elsewhere within the range of the subspecies, and are tentatively, therefore, referred to _mexicana_. Four specimens earlier reported (G. M. Allen, 1929:130) from the same island also are relatively large (forearm 35 mm). Further commentary on this insular population must await a time when additional material is available from Central America.   Tonatia nicaraguae Goodwin, 1942      _Specimens._--_Boaco_: Santa Rosa, 17 km N, 15 km E Boaco, 300 m,     1. _Chontales_: Hato Grande, 13 km S, 8 km W Juigalpa, 60 m, 1.  Only four specimens of this seemingly rare species have been recorded previously from Nicaragua--one (the holotype) from Kanawa Creek, near Cukra, north of Bluefields, 100 ft, Zelaya (Goodwin, 1942b:205), another from 12.5 mi. S and 13 mi. E Rivas, 125 ft, Rivas (Davis and Carter, 1962:67-68), and two from 6 km N Tuma, 500 m, Matagalpa (Valdez and LaVal, 1971:248). Our specimens were caught in mist nets placed over small, quiet streams that were fringed with tall, gallery forest. The surrounding areas were savanna-like with small stands of secondary forest. An adult male taken on 21 April had testes that measured 5 mm in length, whereas those of another (9 August) were 3 mm.  Handley (1966b:761) synonymized _T. nicaraguae_ with _Tonatia minuta_ Goodwin, 1942, a conclusion with which we agree. However, the name _nicaraguae_ (Goodwin, 1942b:205) has page priority over _minuta_ Goodwin (op. cit.:206) and is the valid name for the species rather than _minuta_ as used by Handley (see also LaVal, 1969:820; Gardner _et al._, 1970:716; Valdez and LaVal, 1971:248).  Measurements of the two males (that from Hato Grande listed first) are as follows: total length, 63, 60 mm; length of tail, 5, 6 mm; length of hind foot, 10, 9 mm; length of ear, 23, 23 mm; length of forearm, 34.5, 35.6 mm; weight, 11.4, 8.8 gms; greatest length of skull, 20.2, 20.5 mm; zygomatic breadth, 9.5, 9.5 mm; breadth of braincase, 8.5, 8.2 mm; postorbital breadth, 3.1, 2.9 mm; length of maxillary toothrow, 7.0, 7.1 mm; breadth across upper molars, 6.3, 6.5 mm. We have not compared our specimens directly with others from Middle America. On the basis of available measurements, they resemble material reported from Honduras (LaVal, 1969:820), averaging larger than other specimens for which measurements have been published (see especially Goodwin, 1942b:206; Davis and Carter, 1962:68; Davis _et al._, 1964:379; Gardner _et al._, 1970:716-717).   Phyllostomus hastatus panamensis J. A. Allen, 1904      _Specimens._--_Carazo_: 3 km N, 4 km W Diriamba, 600 m, 1.     _Madriz_: Darailí, 5 km N, 14 km E Condega, 940 m, 4. _Managua_: 3     km SW Tipitapa, 40 m, 1; 3 km N Sabana Grande, 50 m, 2; 2 km N     Sabana Grande, 40 m, 1; 5 mi S Managua, 2. _Matagalpa_: La Danta, 1     km N, 5 km E Esquipulas, 760 m, 1. _Nueva Segovia_: 4.5 km N, 2 km     E Jalapa, 630 m, 2; 1.5 km N, 1 km E Jalapa, 660 m, 1. _Zelaya_:     Bonanza, 850 ft, 2; El Recreo, 25 m, 8.  This large spear-nosed species has been reported previously from Nicaragua only from Matagalpa (Goodwin, 1942c:126). _Phyllostomus hastatus_ evidently occurs throughout the country and is relatively common in some places.  Two females taken 5 mi S Managua on 13 March each carried a single embryo (crown-rump length 27 and 32 mm). Lactating females were captured in June, July, and August.   Trachops cirrhosus coffini Goldman, 1925  A male fringe-lipped bat netted over a small stream at Cara de Mono, 50 m, Zelaya, in the Caribbean lowlands, on 24 April, 1968, constitutes the second known occurrence of this species in Nicaragua. Carter _et al._ (1966:491) earlier reported two males from Río Coco, 64 mi NNE Jinotega, 1000 ft, Jinotega. The testes of our specimen were 4 mm long.  Davis and Carter (1962:69), Carter _et al._ (_loc. cit._), and Starrett and Casebeer (1968:11) did not apply a trinomen to bats of this species and noted overlap of measurements between _T. c. cirrhosus_ (Spix) and _T. c. coffini_ Goldman. However, until detailed comparisons can be made, we follow Jones (1966:452) in retaining the subspecific name _coffini_.   Chrotopterus auritus auritus (Peters, 1856)  An adult male captured in a mist net set in a forest clearing at Santa María de Ostuma, 1250 m, Matagalpa, represents the first record of this bat from Nicaragua. The testes of our individual, taken on 1 July 1966, were 6 mm in length. Externally and cranially our Nicaraguan example closely resembles specimens of _C. auritus_ from Veracruz and the Yucatán Peninsula. Handley (1966b:762) and Starrett and Casebeer (1968:12) expressed doubt as to the validity of the currently used subspecific names in this species. Comparisons of cranial and external measurements of the material at hand with those given in various published accounts--Burt and Stirton (1961), Starrett and Casebeer (1968), and Thomas (1905), for example--reveal little variation. Until additional information is available (especially as concerns the South American races), however, we tentatively apply the subspecific name _C. a. auritus_ to Middle American populations.   Anoura geoffroyi lasiopyga (Peters, 1868)  Four specimens of this species, netted on 24 and 25 July 1967 in a banana grove 1.5 km N and 1 km E Jalapa, 660 m, Nueva Segovia, provide the first record of this glossophagine from Nicaragua. Two males each had testes 6 mm in length; one female evidenced no reproduction activity, whereas another carried an embryo 4 mm in crown-rump"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32350"],["title","Noteworthy Records of Bats From Nicaragua, with a Checklist of the Chiropteran (#2)"],["body"," length. In addition to our material, there is a specimen in the British Museum (BM 8.6.22.4) from Cafetal \"Concordia,\" 4000 ft, Jinotega.  It may be noteworthy that the two localities at which this bat is known both are in the highlands of the northern part of Nicaragua, and that we failed to take additional specimens in many hundreds of hours of netting in other places in the country.   Choeroniscus godmani (Thomas, 1903)  Godman's bat was reported from Nicaragua by Handley (1966a:86), who used the locality designation \"El Realejo\" for the three specimens available to him. Actually, the three are from the nearby Hda. San Isidro, 10 km S Chinandega. We have taken three additional specimens as follows: Santa Rosa, 17 km N and 15 km E Boaco, 300 m, Boaco (an adult female taken on 21 March, which was pregnant with an embryo measuring 16 mm in crown-rump length); 2 km E Yalí, 900 m, Jinotega (an adult male netted on 3 August, testes 4 mm in length); and Santa María de Ostuma, 1250 m, Matagalpa (a nonpregnant, adult female captured on 11 April). Bats of this species have been taken as far north as the western Mexican state of Sinaloa (Jones, 1964b:510).   Lichonycteris obscura Thomas, 1895  Managua is the type locality of this rare long-nosed species and a specimen was reported from 6 mi W Rama, 50 ft, Zelaya, by Davis _et al._ (1964:380). Our collection contains three males, one from Jalapa, 660 m, Nueva Segovia, captured on the night of 27 July 1967 as it flew around a lighted room in a house, and two from the south side of the Río Mico, El Recreo, 25 m, Zelaya, taken on 26 and 27 July 1966 (one was netted and the other caught by hand in the lighted room of a building at night).  Selected measurements of the three males are, respectively: total length, 55, 58, 57 mm; length of tail, 7, 10, 9 mm; length of hind foot, 7, 9, 9 mm; length of ear, 10, 11, 11 mm; length of forearm, 30.9, 31.0, 30.8 mm; weight, 6.8, 6.8, 6.2 gms; length of testes, 1, 2, 2 mm; greatest length of skull, 18.5, 18.0, 17.9 mm; breadth of braincase, 8.1, 8.4, 8.3 mm; length of maxillary toothrow, 5.7, 5.5, 5.7 mm.   Carollia castanea H. Allen, 1890      _Specimens._--_Boaco_: Santa Rosa, 17 km N, 15 km E Boaco, 300 m,     7. _Chontales_: 1 km N, 2.5 km W Villa Somoza, 330 m, 4. _Matagalpa_:     1 km NE Esquipulas, 420 m, 1. _Nueva Segovia_: 7 km N, 4 km E     Jalapa, 660 m, 4. _Zelaya_: S side Río Mico, El Recreo, 25 m, 6;     Cara de Mono, 50 m, 15.  Bats of this species apparently are common in the Caribbean lowlands of Nicaragua; the highest altitude at which we have taken specimens is 660 meters. The only previous report of _C. castanea_ from Nicaragua evidently is that of Davis _et al._ (1964:379), who mentioned it in passing (from Cacao, Zelaya) in an account of _Macrophyllum macrophyllum_. Two adult females each carried an embryo having crown-rump lengths of 20 (21 March) and 10 mm (27 July). Adult females evincing no gross reproductive activity were taken in February (one), March (one), April (four), June (three), July (two), and August (two). Four adult males netted on 24 April had testes with an average length of 7.0 (5-9) mm, whereas those of four other adult males taken in late June had an average of 4.0 (2-6) mm.  In our collections from Nicaragua, we find at least three kinds of _Carollia_ and we follow Handley (1966b:764-765) in tentatively assigning these to _C. castanea_, _C. subrufa_, and _C. perspicillata_. The systematics of this genus is currently under study by Ronald H. Pine. In Nicaragua, _castanea_ differs from _subrufa_ (with which it has been confused in the past) in being smaller, both externally and cranially, and much darker in color as well as in the additional characters mentioned by Handley (_loc. cit._).   Sturnira ludovici ludovici Anthony, 1924  An adult male (testes 6 mm) yellow-shouldered bat from Darailí, 5 km N and 14 km E Condega, 940 m, in Madriz, provides the only specimen thus far reported from Nicaragua. _Sturnira ludovici_ evidently is relatively rare in Nicaragua and may be confined to the highlands in the north, whereas the smaller _S. lilium_ is abundant throughout the country and is the only other species of _Sturnira_ represented in our collections.  We provisionally refer our specimen to _S. l. ludovici_ pending Luis de la Torre's forthcoming review of the genus. Selected measurements are: total length, 77 mm; length of hind foot, 15 mm; length of ear, 19 mm; length of forearm, 44.8 mm; weight, 26.8 gms; greatest length of skull, 24.2 mm; zygomatic breadth, 14.2 mm; postorbital breadth, 6.3 mm; breadth of braincase, 10.5 mm; length of maxillary toothrow, 6.8 mm.   Uroderma magnirostrum Davis, 1968  In the original description of _U. magnirostrum_, Davis (1968:680) reported one specimen from Nicaragua--a female in our collection from 3 km N and 4 km W Sapoá, 40 m, Rivas. We have two additional specimens, both from the relatively dry northwestern Departamento de Chinandega. On 8 July 1966, a male (testes 2 mm) was netted under trees along a small stream at San Antonio, 35 m, and a female (one embryo 28 mm in crown-rump length) was netted on 4 March 1968 over a warm spring at a place 4.5 km N Cosigüina, 15 m. Judging from published records, this species is limited in Middle America to the Pacific versant.  Selected measurements of the three Nicaraguan specimens are, respectively: total length, 65, 64, 67 mm; length of hind foot, 12, 11, 14 mm; length of ear, 16.5, 16, 18 mm; length of forearm, 42.2, 41.7, 45.2 mm; weight, 16.2, 13.8, 21.4 (pregnant) gms; greatest length of skull, 22.7, 23.4, 23.8 mm; zygomatic breadth, 12.4, 12.9, 13.1 mm; postorbital breadth, 5.8, 5.5, 5.9 mm; mastoid breadth, 10.9, 11.1, 11.1 mm; length of maxillary toothrow, 7.9, 8.1, 8.6 mm.   Vampyrops helleri Peters, 1866      _Specimens._--_Boaco_: Santa Rosa, 17 km N, 15 km E Boaco, 300 m,     3. _Carazo_: 3 km N, 4 km W Diriamba, 600 m, 2. _Chinandega_:     Potosí, 5 m, 1; 6.5 km N, 1 km E Cosigüina, 10 m, 1; 4.5 km N     Cosigüina, 15 m, 3; Hda. Bellavista, 720 m, Volcán Casita, 13.     _Chontales_: 1 km N, 2.5 km W Villa Somoza, 330 m, 4. _Granada_:     Finca Santa Cecilia, 6.5 km SE Guanacaste, 660 m, 4. _Matagalpa_:     Finca Tepeyac, 10.5 km N, 9 km E Matagalpa, 960 m, 1. _Nueva     Segovia_: 4.5 km N, 2 km E Jalapa, 680 m, 2; 1.5 km N, 1 km E     Jalapa, 660 m, 2. _Rivas_: 2 km N, 3 km E Mérida, 200 m, Isla de     Ometepe, 4; 4 km N, 4 km W Sapoá, 40 m, 1. _Zelaya_: S side Río     Mico, El Recreo, 25 m, 3.  Only two specimens of this small white-lined species have been reported previously from Nicaragua--one from 1 km NW La Gatiada, 1300 ft, Chontales (Davis _et al._, 1964:383), and the other from 3 mi NNW Diriamba, Carazo (Jones, 1964a:507). This bat was relatively rare in collections until the last decade or so. Handley (1966b:766) reported _V. helleri_ as abundant in the lowland areas of Panamá, and we found the same to be true in Nicaragua. We suspect that future investigations in Middle America will reveal this species to be a common member of lowland tropical communities. It is known as far north as southern Veracruz (Carter _et al._, 1966:494).  Most of our specimens were captured in mist nets set over small streams bordered by gallery forest, or in banana groves. The range of ecological conditions in which this species was taken is represented by the semiarid environment of the Cosigüina Peninsula in northwestern Nicaragua and the humid tropical forest (secondary growth) in the vicinity of El Recreo in the Caribbean lowlands. Pregnant females were captured in March, April, June, July, and August, indicating that this species probably breeds throughout much of the year.   Vampyrodes major G. M. Allen, 1908      _Specimens._--_Boaco_: Santa Rosa, 17 km N, 15 km E Boaco, 300 m,     8. _Chontales_: 1 km N, 2.5 km W Villa Somoza, 330 m, 2. _Zelaya_:     S side Río Mico, 25 m, 6.  This large white-lined stenodermine was known previously from Nicaragua by a single specimen from an unknown locality (J. A. Allen, 1910:112). All of our specimens were caught in mist nets, which were set over streams at Santa Rosa and near Villa Somoza, and in a banana grove at El Recreo. Two pregnant females, captured on 11 and 13 July at Santa Rosa, each carried an embryo (4 and 27 mm in crown-rump length, respectively); one of two other adult females captured there on 9 August also had an embryo (35 mm in length) but the other evidently was reproductively quiescent. Testes of adult males varied in length from 3 to 10 mm on the following dates (testicular lengths in parentheses): 25 February (10 mm); 21 March (8, 8 mm); 17 June (3, 4 mm); 13 July (6 mm); 27-28 July (4, 4 mm); 3 August (4 mm); 5 August (3 mm); 9 August (4 mm).  We follow Starrett and Casebeer (1968:12) in the use of the specific name _major_, rather than _caraccioli_ as suggested by Cabrera (1958), Goodwin and Greenhall (1961), and Handley (1966b).   Vampyressa nymphaea Thomas, 1909  A pregnant female (crown-rump length of embryo 5 mm) was captured in a mist net set in a small banana grove on the south side of the Río Mico, El Recreo, 25 m, in the Caribbean lowlands, on 27 February 1968. This specimen provides the first record of the big yellow-eared bat from Nicaragua. The species was recently reported for the first time from Costa Rica (Gardner _et al._, 1970:721); it was characterized as uncommon in Panamá by Handley (1966b:767). The one Costa Rican locality of record also is in the Caribbean versant.  Selected external and cranial measurements of our female are: total length, 58 mm; length of hind foot, 11 mm; length of ear, 16 mm; length of forearm, 36.2 mm; weight, 12.3 gms; greatest length of skull, 21.1 mm; condylobasal length, 18.4 mm; zygomatic breadth, 12.3 mm; mastoid breadth, 10.5 mm; breadth across canines, 4.6 mm; breadth of braincase, 9.4 mm; length of maxillary toothrow, 7.2 mm; length of mandibular c-m3, 7.8 mm.
