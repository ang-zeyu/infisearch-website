It is not an uncommon shell from the East Indies, and seldom grows larger than the figure.         *       *       *       *       *  STROMBUS dilatatus,  _Winged Strombus--middle figures._         *       *       *       *       *  _S. testâ transversè striatâ; spirâ mediocri, plicis numerosis gracilibus; labio exteriore dilatato, rotundato, crassissimo, reflexo; interiore suprà crassescente, medio lævi; aperturâ striatâ._  Shell transversely striated; spire moderate, with slender numerous plaits; outer lip dilated, rounded, very thick, and reflected; inner lip thickened above, smooth in the middle; aperture striated.         *       *       *       *       *  An undescribed species, and of the greatest rarity, for I have never seen any other specimen, than one in my own cabinet, although perfect in form, it is obviously faded in colour; yet it is too remarkable to be mistaken for any other of this interesting family, which requires so much illustration.         *       *       *       *       *   Pl. 72  [Illustration]  POGONIAS hirsutus,  _Hairy-breasted Toothbill._         *       *       *       *       *  GENERIC CHARACTER.--See Pl. 68.         *       *       *       *       *  SPECIFIC CHARACTER.      _P. supra fuscus, maculis sulphureis, subtus sulphureus maculis nigris     interstinctus, capite juguloque nigris; pectoris plumis elongatis,     pilis setaceis terminatis._      Above brown, spotted with sulphur; beneath sulphureous, with black     spots; head and chin black; feathers of the breast lengthened, and     ending in long setaceous hairs.         *       *       *       *       *  I have before observed, that this genus of birds was first characterized under the name of _Pogonias_, by Illiger, in 1811; some years after (1815), M. Vieillot changed the name to _Pogonia_, without taking any notice of Illiger's denomination, and Dr. Leach has followed Vieillot without probably being aware of the plagiarism; Vieillot's name must, however, be expunged, as Mr. Brown has some time back affixed the name of _Pogonia_ to a remarkable genus of plants.  Total length about seven inches; bill blueish black, one inch two lines long, and large in proportion; the tooth in the middle very prominent; behind the eye is a short white stripe, and another much longer begins from the under mandible, and goes half way down the neck; the chin and part of the throat, together with the head and neck above, deep black, which changes to a dark brown on the back, wings, covers, and tail; a small round sulphur spot is on the tip of each feather of the hind head, back, and lesser wing covers; the quills pale brown, margined with sulphur; the under plumage is greenish sulphur, closely spotted with blackish; the most extraordinary peculiarity of this bird consists in the feathers of the breast, which are more rigid than the others, pointed, and the shaft of the lower ones ending in fine incurved setaceous hairs, many of which are near an inch long. The probable use this particular formation is intended for, it is impossible to conjecture.  Mr. B. Leadbeater, to whom I am often obliged for the inspection of rare subjects, received this from Africa, and it is the only individual of the species I ever heard of.         *       *       *       *       *   Pl. 73  [Illustration]  PSITTACUS pulchellus,  _Turcosine Parrakeet._         *       *       *       *       *  GENERIC CHARACTER.--See Pl. 1.         *       *       *       *       *  SPECIFIC CHARACTER.      _P. macrourus, suprà viridis, subtùs fulvus; sincipite, genis,     tegminibusque cyaneis, remigibus cæruleis; rectricibus lateralibus     fulvis._      Long-tailed Parrakeet, green above; yellow beneath; forepart of the     head, cheeks, and wing covers light blue; quills deep blue; lateral     tail feathers yellow.      _Shaw, Naturalist's Misc._ 3. _pl._ 96. _Latham, Suppl._ 2. _p._ 88.     _no._ 14.      _La Perruche Edwards, Le Vaillant_, _pl._ 68.

The only representation of the male is in the Naturalist's Miscellany, where it cannot be recognized, and Le Vaillant's is of the female, which differs considerably from the other sex. It is a rare species, and peculiar to New Holland.  Length nine inches, with the tail, which is near four inches and a half; the upper part of the plumage olive green, not so bright as is usual in this tribe; the front of the head is a most brilliant turcosine blue, which spreads on the cheeks, nearly to the ears, and then mixes with the green; the shoulders and lesser wing covers of the same colour, graduating to a deep mazarine blue on the greater covers, spurious wings, and quill feathers, which latter are all deep black beneath, as well as on their interior shafts; at the base of the shoulders is a large irregular patch of dull red, partially hid by the scapulars; the under plumage is yellow, tinged with olive on the throat and breast, and verging towards orange on the belly; tail feathers narrow and pointed, mostly green, with the inner shafts blueish, and margined with black; the three outer on each side nearly yellow, the next tipt only with that colour; under the wings brilliant blue, the greater covers and quills deep black; bill very small; upper mandible without a notch, and blackish; lower very convex, and, with the legs, flesh colour.  The female figured by Le Vaillant is much less brilliant in all its colours, and without the red mark on the shoulders.         *       *       *       *       *   Pl. 74  [Illustration]  ACHATINA fasciata,  _Chesnut-banded Achatina._         *       *       *       *       *  GENERIC CHARACTER.--See Pl. 30.         *       *       *       *       *  SPECIFIC CHARACTER.      _A. testâ albâ fasciis latis lineisque castaneis ornatâ; spirâ     elongatâ, crassescente; labio interiore semi-circulari, intus depresso;     columellâ truncatâ, emarginatâ._      Shell white, with broad chesnut bands and lines; spire elongated,     thickened; inner lip semi-circular, depressed within; columella     truncated, emarginate.

Gualtieri's figure at _tab._ 6. _fig._ D, is an admirable representation of _A. pallida_, which, not having his work before me at the time, I could not quote; the other at C is a very good one of the present shell. The upper drawing is from one in my own cabinet; the lower is in the possession of Mr. C. Dubois, who is continually adding to his fine and valuable collection.  It is almost unnecessary to contradict the opinion of some writers who have fancied this a _fresh-water_ shell. It is not uncommon, but seldom seen in perfection.         *       *       *       *       *   Pl. 75  [Illustration]  NATICA spadicea,  _Banded Natica._         *       *       *       *       *  GENERIC CHARACTER.      _Testa subglobosa seu ovalis, umbilicata.

The species are numerous, and are found both in temperate and tropical seas; two or three inhabit our own coasts, but by far the greater number are found in the Asiatic Ocean. They are subject to variation in their colour; and this, joined with a general resemblance in form, has rendered the discrimination of the species very difficult. I have, however, remarked, that the various modifications of the umbilicus, and the termination of the pillar (which is indicated in many species by an elevated ridge or rib within the umbilicus) is a certain and constant indication, presenting the same peculiarity through all the individuals of a species, even in the young state. This termination of the pillar has been mistaken for the inner lip, which, on the contrary, is always above the umbilicus, which, if closed, is not closed by the lip, but by the thickened termination of the pillar or columella.  The two most striking varieties are here figured of this species, which is sufficiently described in the specific character. I believe it is found both in the Mediterranean and Red Seas.         *       *       *       *       *   Pl. 76  [Illustration]  MEROPS Savignii,  _Black-capped Bee-eater._         *       *       *       *       *  GENERIC CHARACTER.--See Pl. 8.         *       *       *       *       *  SPECIFIC CHARACTER.      _M. viridis, subtus albescens, uropygio caudâque cæruleis; vertice,     strigâ oculari, fasciâque latâ collari nigris; mento, superciliisque     albis; rectricibus mediis elongatis._      Green; beneath whitish; rump and tail blue; crown of the head, eye     stripe, and broad band across the neck, black; chin and eye-brows     white; two middle tail feathers lengthened.         *       *       *       *       *  This Bird was pointed out to me by Professor Temminck as described by Le Vaillant in his work on this family, under the name here given; on this authority, therefore, I have been obliged to rest, for I have in vain turned over the catalogues of all the public libraries in the metropolis, in the hope of seeing the work, and ascertaining the fact. The book is modern, and, though expensive, one of standard excellence; but a princely fortune is necessary to purchase such a library as a student should have access to.

The thorough investigation of these is a work of no ordinary labour; and, until this is done, it appears most advisable to let the generic distinction remain, as given by Latreille, though there can be no doubt that among them distinct groups will be detected.  Cramer's figure will not indicate even the genus, and Fabricius describes the body as white; the tip ferruginous; in this it is yellow, tipped with red.  Mr. Haworth obliged me with this insect, which Fabricius notes as African.         *       *       *       *       *  BOTIS bicolor,  _Black and White Gauze-wing._         *       *       *       *       *      _B. alis anticis fuscis, punctis duabus angulatis transversis albis;     posticis ad basin albis._      Anterior wings, brown, with two transverse angulated white spots;     posterior white at the base.         *       *       *       *       *  From the same collection as the preceding; the margin of the thorax and body are white.

The upper parts of the body and wings are of a rich golden brown, with indistinct brighter spots; the lesser wing covers have a whitish spot at the top of each, forming two bands; quills on the inner shaft black, with white spots. Under plumage grey, tinged on the breast with rufous, and banded with brownish black; tail short, black, with interrupted transverse bands of obscure olive.
