She was some thirteen or fourteen years old, a freckle-faced child with a shy smile, and steady green eyes. There was a certain awkward grace about her, and she seemed more imaginative than most of her stolid race. She curtsied quaintly for him, her bare foot reaching out under the long smock which was daily female dress here.  \"Are you busy, good sir?\" she asked.  \"Well, not too much,\" said Jorun. He was glad of a chance to talk; it silenced his thoughts. \"What can I do for you?\"  \"I wondered--\" She hesitated, then, breathlessly: \"I wonder if you could give me a lift down to the beach? Only for an hour or two. It's too far to walk there before I have to be home, and I can't borrow a car, or even a horse. If it won't be any trouble, sir.\"  \"Mmmm--shouldn't you be at home now? Isn't there milking and so on to do?\"  \"Oh, I don't live on a farm, good sir. My father is a baker.\"  \"Yes, yes, so he is. I should have remembered.\" Jorun considered for an instant. There was enough to do in town, and it wasn't fair for him to play hooky while Zarek worked alone. \"Why do you want to go to the beach, Julith?\"  \"We'll be busy packing up,\" she said. \"Starting tomorrow, I guess. This is my last chance to see it.\"  Jorun's mouth twisted a little. \"All right,\" he said; \"I'll take you.\"  \"You are very kind, good sir,\" she said gravely.  He didn't reply, but held out his arm, and she clasped it with one hand while her other arm gripped his waist. The generator inside his skull responded to his will, reaching out and clawing itself to the fabric of forces and energies which was physical space. They rose quietly, and went so slowly seaward that he didn't have to raise a wind-screen.  \"Will we be able to fly like this when we get to the stars?\" she asked.  \"I'm afraid not, Julith,\" he said. \"You see, the people of my civilization are born this way. Thousands of years ago, men learned how to control the great basic forces of the cosmos with only a small bit of energy. Finally they used artificial mutation--that is, they changed themselves, slowly, over many generations, until their brains grew a new part that could generate this controlling force. We can now even, fly between the stars, by this power. But your people don't have that brain, so we had to build spaceships to take you away.\"  \"I see,\" she said.  \"Your great-great-great-grandchildren can be like us, if your people want to be changed thus,\" he said.  \"They didn't want to change before,\" she answered. \"I don't think they'll do it now, even in their new home.\" Her voice held no bitterness; it was an acceptance.  Privately, Jorun doubted it. The psychic shock of this uprooting would be bound to destroy the old traditions of the Terrans; it would not take many centuries before they were culturally assimilated by Galactic civilization.  Assimilated--nice euphemism. Why not just say--eaten?         *       *       *       *       *  They landed on the beach. It was broad and white, running in dunes from the thin, harsh, salt-streaked grass to the roar and tumble of surf. The sun was low over the watery horizon, filling the damp, blowing air with gold. Jorun could almost look directly at its huge disc.  He sat down. The sand gritted tinily under him, and the wind rumpled his hair and filled his nostrils with its sharp wet smell. He picked up a conch and turned it over in his fingers, wondering at the intricate architecture of it.  \"If you hold it to your ear,\" said Julith, \"you can hear the sea.\" Her childish voice was curiously tender around the rough syllables of Earth's language.  He nodded and obeyed her hint. It was only the small pulse of blood within him--you heard the same thing out in the great hollow silence of space--but it did sing of restless immensities, wind and foam, and the long waves marching under the moon.  \"I have two of them myself,\" said Julith. \"I want them so I can always remember this beach. And my children and their children will hold them, too, and hear our sea talking.\" She folded his fingers around the shell. \"You keep this one for yourself.\"  \"Thank you,\" he said. \"I will.\" The combers rolled in, booming and spouting against the land. The Terrans called them the horses of God. A thin cloud in the west was turning rose and gold.  \"Are there oceans on our new planet?\" asked Julith.  \"Yes,\" he said. \"It's the most Earth-like world we could find that wasn't already inhabited. You'll be happy there.\"  _But the trees and grasses, the soil and the fruits thereof, the beasts of the field and the birds of the air and the fish of the waters beneath, form and color, smell and sound, taste and texture, everything is different. Is alien. The difference is small, subtle, but it is the abyss of two billion years of separate evolution, and no other world can ever quite be Earth._  Julith looked straight at him with solemn eyes. \"Are you folk afraid of Hulduvians?\" she asked.  \"Why, no,\" he said. \"Of course not.\"  \"Then why are you giving Earth to them?\" It was a soft question, but it trembled just a little.  \"I thought all your people understood the reason by now,\" said Jorun. \"Civilization--the civilization of man and his nonhuman allies--has moved inward, toward the great star-clusters of Galactic center. This part of space means nothing to us any more; it's almost a desert. You haven't seen starlight till you've been by Sagittarius. Now the Hulduvians are another civilization. They are not the least bit like us; they live on big, poisonous worlds like Jupiter and Saturn. I think they would seem like pretty nice monsters if they weren't so alien to us that neither side can really understand the other. They use the cosmic energies too, but in a different way--and their way interferes with ours just as ours interferes with theirs. Different brains, you see.  \"Anyway, it was decided that the two civilizations would get along best by just staying away from each other. If they divided up the Galaxy between them, there would be no interference; it would be too far from one civilization to the other. The Hulduvians were, really, very nice about it. They're willing to take the outer rim, even if there are fewer stars, and let us have the center.  \"So by the agreement, we've got to have all men and manlike beings out of their territory before they come to settle it, just as they'll move out of ours. Their colonists won't be coming to Jupiter and Saturn for centuries yet; but even so, we have to clear the Sirius Sector now, because there'll be a lot of work to do elsewhere. Fortunately, there are only a few people living in this whole part of space. The Sirius Sector has been an isolated, primi--ah--quiet region since the First Empire fell, fifty thousand years ago.\"  Julith's voice rose a little. \"But those people are _us_!\"  \"And the folk of Alpha Centauri and Procyon and Sirius and--oh, hundreds of other stars. Yet all of you together are only one tiny drop in the quadrillions of the Galaxy. Don't you see, Julith, you have to move for the good of all of us?\"  \"Yes,\" she said. \"Yes, I know all that.\"  She got up, shaking herself. \"Let's go swimming.\"  Jorun smiled and shook his head. \"No, I'll wait for you if you want to go.\"         *       *       *       *       *  She nodded and ran off down the beach, sheltering behind a dune to put on a bathing-suit. The Terrans had a nudity taboo, in spite of the mild interglacial climate; typical primitive irrationality. Jorun lay back, folding his arms behind his head, and looked up at the darkening sky. The evening star twinkled forth, low and white on the dusk-blue horizon. Venus--or was it Mercury? He wasn't sure. He wished he knew more about the early history of the Solar System, the first men to ride their thunderous rockets out to die on unknown hell-worlds--the first clumsy steps toward the stars. He could look it up in the archives of Corazuno, but he knew he never would. Too much else to do, too much to remember. Probably less than one percent of mankind's throngs even knew where Earth was, today--though, for a while, it had been quite a tourist-center. But that was perhaps thirty thousand years ago.  _Because this world, out of all the billions, has certain physical characteristics_, he thought, _my race has made them into standards. Our basic units of length and time and acceleration, our comparisons by which we classify the swarming planets of the Galaxy, they all go back ultimately to Earth. We bear that unspoken memorial to our birthplace within our whole civilization, and will bear it forever. But has she given us more than that? Are our own selves, bodies and minds and dreams, are they also the children of Earth?_  Now he was thinking like Kormt, stubborn old Kormt who clung with such a blind strength to this land simply because it was his. When you considered all the races of this wander-footed species--how many of them there were, how many kinds of man between the stars! And yet they all walked upright; they all had two eyes and a nose between and a mouth below; they were all cells of that great and ancient culture which had begun here, eons past, with the first hairy half-man who kindled a fire against night. If Earth had not had darkness and cold and prowling beasts, oxygen and cellulose and flint, that culture might never have gestated.  _I'm getting unlogical. Too tired, nerves worn too thin, psychosomatic control slipping. Now Earth is becoming some obscure mother-symbol for me._  _Or has she always been one, for the whole race of us?_  A seagull cried harshly overhead and soared from view.  The sunset was smoldering away and dusk rose like fog out of the ground. Julith came running back to him, her face indistinct in the gloom. She was breathing hard, and he couldn't tell if the catch in her voice was laughter or weeping.  \"I'd better be getting home,\" she said.   3  They flew slowly back.

Jorun set the girl down outside her home.  \"Thank you, good sir,\" she said, curtseying. \"Won't you come in to dinner?\"  \"Well--\"  The door opened, etching the girl black against the ruddiness inside. Jorun's luminous tunic made him like a torch in the dark. \"Why, it's the star-man,\" said a woman's voice.  \"I took your daughter for a swim,\" he explained. \"I hope you don't mind.\"  \"And if we did, what would it matter?\" grumbled a bass tone. Jorun recognized Kormt; the old man must have come as a guest from his farm on the outskirts. \"What could we do about it?\"  \"Now, Granther, that's no way to talk to the gentleman,\" said the woman. \"He's been very kind. Won't you come eat with us, good sir?\"  Jorun refused twice, in case they were only being polite, then accepted gladly enough. He was tired of cookery at the inn where he and Zarek boarded. \"Thank you.\"  He entered, ducking under the low door. A single long, smoky-raftered room was kitchen, diningroom, and parlor; doors led off to the sleeping quarters. It was furnished with a clumsy elegance, skin rugs, oak wainscoting, carved pillars, glowing ornaments of hammered copper. A radium clock, which must be incredibly old, stood on the stone mantel, above a snapping fire; a chemical-powered gun, obviously of local manufacture, hung over it. Julith's parents, a plain, quiet peasant couple, conducted him to the end of the wooden table, while half a dozen children watched him with large eyes. The younger children were the only Terrans who seemed to find this removal an adventure.  The meal was good and plentiful: meat, vegetables, bread, beer, milk, ice cream, coffee, all of it from the farms hereabouts. There wasn't much trade between the few thousand communities of Earth; they were practically self-sufficient. The company ate in silence, as was the custom here. When they were finished, Jorun wanted to go, but it would have been rude to leave immediately. He went over to a chair by the fireplace, across from the one in which Kormt sprawled.  The old man took out a big-bowled pipe and began stuffing it. Shadows wove across his seamed brown face, his eyes were a gleam out of darkness. \"I'll go down to City Hall with you soon,\" he said; \"I imagine that's where the work is going on.\"  \"Yes,\" said Jorun, \"I can relieve Zarek at it. I'd appreciate it if you did come, good sir. Your influence is very steadying on these people.\"  \"It should be,\" said Kormt. \"I've been their Speaker for almost a hundred years. And my father Gerlaug was before me, and his father Kormt was before him.\" He took a brand from the fire and held it over his pipe, puffing hard, looking up at Jorun through tangled brows. \"Who was your great-grandfather?\"  \"Why--I don't know. I imagine he's still alive somewhere, but--\"  \"I thought so. No marriage. No family. No home. No tradition.\" Kormt shook, his massive head, slowly, \"I pity you Galactics!\"  \"Now please, good sir--\" Damn it all, the old clodhopper could get as irritating as a faulty computer. \"We have records that go back to before man left this planet. Records of everything. It is you who have forgotten.\"  Kormt smiled and puffed blue clouds at him. \"That's not what I meant.\"  \"Do you mean you think it is good for men to live a life that is unchanging, that is just the same from century to century--no new dreams, no new triumphs, always the same grubbing rounds of days? I cannot agree.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Jorun's mind flickered over history, trying to evaluate the basic motivations of his opponent. Partly cultural, partly biological, that must be it. Once Terra had been the center of the civilized universe. But the long migration starward, especially after the fall of the First Empire, drained off the most venturesome elements of the population. That drain went on for thousands of years. Sol was backward, ruined and impoverished by the remorseless price of empire, helpless before the storms of barbarian conquest that swept back and forth between the stars. Even after peace was restored, there was nothing to hold a young man or woman of vitality and imagination here--not when you could go toward Galactic center and join the new civilization building out there. Space-traffic came ever less frequently to Sol; old machines rusted away and were not replaced; best to get out while there was still time.  Eventually there was a fixed psychosomatic type, one which lived close to the land, in primitive changeless communities and isolated farmsteads--a type content to gain its simple needs by the labor of hand, horse, or an occasional battered engine. A culture grew up which increased that rigidity. So few had visited Earth in the last several thousand years--perhaps one outsider a century, stopping briefly off on his way to somewhere else--that there was no challenge or encouragement to alter. The Terrans didn't _want_ more people, more machines, more anything; they wished only to remain as they were.  You couldn't call them stagnant. Their life was too healthy, their civilization too rich in its own way--folk art, folk music, ceremony, religion, the intimacy of family life which the Galactics had lost--for that term. But to one who flew between the streaming suns, it was a small existence.  Kormt's voice broke in on his reverie. \"Dreams, triumphs, work, deeds, love and life and finally death and the long sleep in the earth,\" he said. \"Why should we want to change them? They never grow old; they are new for each child that is born.\"  \"Well,\" said Jorun, and stopped. You couldn't really answer that kind of logic. It wasn't logic at all, but something deeper.  \"Well,\" he started over, after a while, \"as you know, this evacuation was forced on us, too. We don't want to move you, but we must.\"  \"Oh, yes,\" said Kormt. \"You have been very nice about it. It would have been easier, in a way, if you'd come with fire and gun and chains for us, like the barbarians did long ago. We could have understood you better then.\"  \"At best, it will be hard for your people,\" said Jorun. \"It will be a shock, and they'll need leaders to guide them through it. You have a duty to help them out there, good sir.\"  \"Maybe.\" Kormt blew a series of smoke rings at his youngest descendant, three years old, who crowed with laughter and climbed up on his knee. \"But they'll manage.\"  \"You can't seem to realize,\" said Jorun, \"that you are the _last man on Earth_ who refuses to go. You will be _alone_. For the rest of your life! We couldn't come back for you later under any circumstances, because there'll be Hulduvian colonies between Sol and Sagittarius which we would disturb in passage. You'll be alone, I say!\"  Kormt shrugged. \"I'm too old to change my ways; there can't be many years left me, anyway. I can live well, just off the food-stores that'll be left here.\" He ruffled the child's hair, but his face drew into a scowl. \"Now, no more of that, good sir, if you please; I'm tired of this argument.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Jorun nodded and fell into the silence that held the rest. Terrans would sometimes sit for hours without talking, content to be in each other's nearness. He thought of Kormt, Gerlaug's son, last man on Earth, altogether alone, living alone and dying alone; and yet, he reflected, was that solitude any greater than the one in which all men dwelt all their days?  Presently the Speaker set the child down, knocked out his pipe, and rose. \"Come, good sir,\" he said, reaching for his staff. \"Let us go.\"  They walked side by side down the street, under the dim lamps and past the yellow windows. The cobbles gave back their footfalls in a dull clatter. Once in a while they passed someone else, a vague figure which bowed to Kormt. Only one did not notice them, an old woman who walked crying between the high walls.  \"They say it is never night on your worlds,\" said Kormt.  Jorun threw him a sidelong glance. His face was a strong jutting of highlights from sliding shadow. \"Some planets have been given luminous skies,\" said the technician, \"and a few still have cities, too, where it is always light. But when every man can control the cosmic energies, there is no real reason for us to live together; most of us dwell far apart. There are very dark nights on my own world, and I cannot see any other home from my own--just the moors.\"  \"It must be a strange life,\" said Kormt. \"Belonging to no one.\"  They came out on the market-square, a broad paved space walled in by houses. There was a fountain in its middle, and a statue dug out of the ruins had been placed there. It was broken, one arm gone--but still the white slim figure of the dancing girl stood with youth and laughter, forever under the sky of Earth. Jorun knew that lovers were wont to meet here, and briefly, irrationally, he wondered how lonely the girl would be in all the millions of years to come.  The City Hall lay at the farther end of the square, big and dark, its eaves carved with dragons, and the gables topped with wing-spreading birds. It was an old building; nobody knew how many generations of men had gathered here. A long, patient line of folk stood outside it, shuffling in one by one to the registry desk; emerging, they went off quietly into the darkness, toward the temporary shelters erected for them.  Walking by the line, Jorun picked faces out of the shadows. There was a young mother holding a crying child, her head bent over it in a timeless pose, murmuring to soothe it. There was a mechanic, still sooty from his work, smiling wearily at some tired joke of the man behind him. There was a scowling, black-browed peasant who muttered a curse as Jorun went by; the rest seemed to accept their fate meekly enough. There was a priest, his head bowed, alone with his God. There was a younger man, his hands clenching and unclenching, big helpless hands, and Jorun heard him saying to someone else: \"--if they could have waited till after harvest. I hate to let good grain stand in"]]]
