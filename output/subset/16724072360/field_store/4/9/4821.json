My heart is evil in Thy sight:       My good thoughts flee:    O Lord, I cannot wish aright—       Wish Thou for me.     O bend my words and acts to Thee,       However ill,    That I, whate’er I say or be,       May serve Thee still.     O let my thoughts abide in Thee       Lest I should fall:    Show me Thyself in all I see,       Thou Lord of all.     LO! IN THINE HONEST EYES I READ      LO! in thine honest eyes I read    The auspicious beacon that shall lead,    After long sailing in deep seas,    To quiet havens in June ease.     Thy voice sings like an inland bird    First by the seaworn sailor heard;    And like road sheltered from life’s sea    Thine honest heart is unto me.     THOUGH DEEP INDIFFERENCE SHOULD DROWSE      THOUGH deep indifference should drowse    The sluggish life beneath my brows,    And all the external things I see    Grow snow-showers in the street to me,    Yet inmost in my stormy sense    Thy looks shall be an influence.     Though other loves may come and go    And long years sever us below,    Shall the thin ice that grows above    Freeze the deep centre-well of love?    No, still below light amours, thou    Shalt rule me as thou rul’st me now.     Year following year shall only set    Fresh gems upon thy coronet;    And Time, grown lover, shall delight    To beautify thee in my sight;    And thou shalt ever rule in me    Crowned with the light of memory.     MY HEART, WHEN FIRST THE BLACK-BIRD SINGS      MY heart, when first the blackbird sings,       My heart drinks in the song:    Cool pleasure fills my bosom through       And spreads each nerve along.     My bosom eddies quietly,       My heart is stirred and cool    As when a wind-moved briar sweeps       A stone into a pool     But unto thee, when thee I meet,       My pulses thicken fast,    As when the maddened lake grows black       And ruffles in the blast.     I DREAMED OF FOREST ALLEYS FAIR   I.      I DREAMED of forest alleys fair       And fields of gray-flowered grass,    Where by the yellow summer moon       My Jenny seemed to pass.     I dreamed the yellow summer moon,       Behind a cedar wood,    Lay white on fields of rippling grass       Where I and Jenny stood.     I dreamed—but fallen through my dream,       In a rainy land I lie    Where wan wet morning crowns the hills       Of grim reality.    II.      I am as one that keeps awake       All night in the month of June,    That lies awake in bed to watch       The trees and great white moon.     For memories of love are more       Than the white moon there above,    And dearer than quiet moonshine       Are the thoughts of her I love.    III.      Last night I lingered long without       My last of loves to see.    Alas! the moon-white window-panes       Stared blindly back on me.     To-day I hold her very hand,       Her very waist embrace—    Like clouds across a pool, I read       Her thoughts upon her face.     And yet, as now, through her clear eyes       I seek the inner shrine—    I stoop to read her virgin heart       In doubt if it be mine—     O looking long and fondly thus,       What vision should I see?    No vision, but my own white face       That grins and mimics me.    IV.      Once more upon the same old seat       In the same sunshiny weather,    The elm-trees’ shadows at their feet       And foliage move together.     The shadows shift upon the grass,       The dial point creeps on;    The clear sun shines, the loiterers pass,       As then they passed and shone.     But now deep sleep is on my heart,       Deep sleep and perfect rest.    Hope’s flutterings now disturb no more       The quiet of my breast.     ST. MARTIN’S SUMMER      AS swallows turning backward       When half-way o’er the sea,    At one word’s trumpet summons       They came again to me—    The hopes I had forgotten       Came back again to me.     I know not which to credit,       O lady of my heart!    Your eyes that bade me linger,       Your words that bade us part—    I know not which to credit,       My reason or my heart.     But be my hopes rewarded,       Or be they but in vain,    I have dreamed a golden vision,       I have gathered in the grain—    I have dreamed a golden vision,       I have not lived in vain.     DEDICATION      MY first gift and my last, to you    I dedicate this fascicle of songs—    The only wealth I have:    Just as they are, to you.     I speak the truth in soberness, and say    I had rather bring a light to your clear eyes,    Had rather hear you praise    This bosomful of songs     Than that the whole, hard world with one consent,    In one continuous chorus of applause    Poured forth for me and mine    The homage of ripe praise.     I write the finis here against my love,    This is my love’s last epitaph and tomb.    Here the road forks, and I    Go my way, far from yours.     THE OLD CHIMÆRAS, OLD RECEIPTS      THE old Chimæras, old receipts       For making “happy land,”    The old political beliefs       Swam close before my hand.     The grand old communistic myths       In a middle state of grace,    Quite dead, but not yet gone to Hell,       And walking for a space,     Quite dead, and looking it, and yet       All eagerness to show    The Social-Contract forgeries       By Chatterton—Rousseau—     A hundred such as these I tried,       And hundreds after that,    I fitted Social Theories       As one would fit a hat!     Full many a marsh-fire lured me on,       I reached at many a star,    I reached and grasped them and behold—       The stump of a cigar!     All through the sultry sweltering day       The sweat ran down my brow,    The still plains heard my distant strokes       That have been silenced now.     This way and that, now up, now down,       I hailed full many a blow.    Alas! beneath my weary arm       The thicket seemed to grow.     I take the lesson, wipe my brow       And throw my axe aside,    And, sorely wearied, I go home       In the tranquil eventide.     And soon the rising moon, that lights       The eve of my defeat,    Shall see me sitting as of yore       By my old master’s feet.     PRELUDE      BY sunny market-place and street    Wherever I go my drum I beat,    And wherever I go in my coat of red    The ribbons flutter about my head.     I seek recruits for wars to come—    For slaughterless wars I beat the drum,    And the shilling I give to each new ally    Is hope to live and courage to die.     I know that new recruits shall come    Wherever I beat the sounding drum,    Till the roar of the march by country and town    Shall shake the tottering Dagons down.     For I was objectless as they    And loitering idly day by day;    But whenever I heard the recruiters come,    I left my all to follow the drum.     THE VANQUISHED KNIGHT      I HAVE left all upon the shameful field,       Honour and Hope, my God, and all but life;    Spurless, with sword reversed and dinted shield,       Degraded and disgraced, I leave the strife.     From him that hath not, shall there not be taken       E’en that he hath, when he deserts the strife?    Life left by all life’s benefits forsaken,       O keep the promise, Lord, and take the life.     TO THE COMMISSIONERS OF NORTHERN LIGHTS      I SEND to you, commissioners,    A paper that may please ye, sirs    (For troth they say it might be worse          An’ I believe’t)    And on your business lay my curse          Before I leav’t.     I thocht I’d serve wi’ you, sirs, yince,    But I’ve thocht better of it since;    The maitter I will nowise mince,          But tell ye true:    I’ll service wi’ some ither prince,          An’ no wi’ you.     I’ve no been very deep, ye’ll think,    Cam’ delicately to the brink    An’ when the water gart me shrink          Straucht took the rue,    An’ didna stoop my fill to drink—          I own it true.     I kent on cape and isle, a light    Burnt fair an’ clearly ilka night;    But at the service I took fright,          As sune’s I saw,    An’ being still a neophite          Gaed straucht awa’.     Anither course I now begin,    The weeg I’ll cairry for my sin,    The court my voice shall echo in,          An’—wha can tell?—    Some ither day I may be yin          O’ you mysel’.     THE RELIC TAKEN, WHAT AVAILS THE SHRINE?      THE relic taken, what avails the shrine?    The locket, pictureless?  O heart of mine,    Art thou not worse than that,    Still warm, a vacant nest where love once sat?     Her image nestled closer at my heart    Than cherished memories, healed every smart    And warmed it more than wine    Or the full summer sun in noon-day shine.     This was the little weather gleam that lit    The cloudy promontories—the real charm was    That gilded hills and woods    And walked beside me thro’ the solitudes.     The sun is set.  My heart is widowed now    Of that companion-thought.  Alone I plough    The seas of life, and trace    A separate furrow far from her and grace.     ABOUT THE SHELTERED GARDEN GROUND      ABOUT the sheltered garden ground       The trees stand strangely still.    The vale ne’er seemed so deep before,       Nor yet so high the hill.     An awful sense of quietness,       A fulness of repose,    Breathes from the dewy garden-lawns,       The silent garden rows.     As the hoof-beats of a troop of horse       Heard far across a plain,    A nearer knowledge of great thoughts       Thrills vaguely through my brain.     I lean my head upon my arm,       My heart’s too full to think;    Like the roar of seas, upon my heart       Doth the morning stillness sink.     AFTER READING “ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA”      AS when the hunt by holt and field       Drives on with horn and strife,    Hunger of hopeless things pursues       Our spirits throughout life.     The sea’s roar fills us aching full       Of objectless desire—    The sea’s roar, and the white moon-shine,       And the reddening of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/441"],["title","New Poems, and Variant Readings (#2)"],["body"," fire.     Who talks to me of reason now?       It would be more delight    To have died in Cleopatra’s arms       Than be alive to-night.     I KNOW NOT HOW, BUT AS I COUNT      I KNOW not how, but as I count       The beads of former years,    Old laughter catches in my throat       With the very feel of tears.     SPRING SONG      THE air was full of sun and birds,       The fresh air sparkled clearly.    Remembrance wakened in my heart       And I knew I loved her dearly.     The fallows and the leafless trees       And all my spirit tingled.    My earliest thought of love, and Spring’s       First puff of perfume mingled.     In my still heart the thoughts awoke,       Came lone by lone together—    Say, birds and Sun and Spring, is Love       A mere affair of weather?     THE SUMMER SUN SHONE ROUND ME      THE summer sun shone round me,       The folded valley lay    In a stream of sun and odour,       That sultry summer day.     The tall trees stood in the sunlight       As still as still could be,    But the deep grass sighed and rustled       And bowed and beckoned me.     The deep grass moved and whispered       And bowed and brushed my face.    It whispered in the sunshine:       “The winter comes apace.”     YOU LOOKED SO TEMPTING IN THE PEW      YOU looked so tempting in the pew,       You looked so sly and calm—    My trembling fingers played with yours       As both looked out the Psalm.     Your heart beat hard against my arm,       My foot to yours was set,    Your loosened ringlet burned my cheek       Whenever they two met.     O little, little we hearkened, dear,       And little, little cared,    Although the parson sermonised,       The congregation stared.     LOVE’S VICISSITUDES      AS Love and Hope together       Walk by me for a while,    Link-armed the ways they travel       For many a pleasant mile—    Link-armed and dumb they travel,       They sing not, but they smile.     Hope leaving, Love commences       To practise on the lute;    And as he sings and travels       With lingering, laggard foot,    Despair plays obligato       The sentimental flute.     Until in singing garments       Comes royally, at call—    Comes limber-hipped Indiff’rence       Free stepping, straight and tall—    Comes singing and lamenting,       The sweetest pipe of all.     DUDDINGSTONE      WITH caws and chirrupings, the woods       In this thin sun rejoice.    The Psalm seems but the little kirk       That sings with its own voice.     The cloud-rifts share their amber light       With the surface of the mere—    I think the very stones are glad       To feel each other near.     Once more my whole heart leaps and swells       And gushes o’er with glee;    The fingers of the sun and shade       Touch music stops in me.     Now fancy paints that bygone day       When you were here, my fair—    The whole lake rang with rapid skates       In the windless winter air.     You leaned to me, I leaned to you,       Our course was smooth as flight—    We steered—a heel-touch to the left,       A heel-touch to the right.     We swung our way through flying men,       Your hand lay fast in mine:    We saw the shifting crowd dispart,       The level ice-reach shine.     I swear by yon swan-travelled lake,       By yon calm hill above,    I swear had we been drowned that day       We had been drowned in love.     STOUT MARCHES LEAD TO CERTAIN ENDS      STOUT marches lead to certain ends,    We seek no Holy Grail, my friends—    That dawn should find us every day    Some fraction farther on our way.     The dumb lands sleep from east to west,    They stretch and turn and take their rest.    The cock has crown in the steading-yard,    But priest and people slumber hard.     We two are early forth, and hear    The nations snoring far and near.    So peacefully their rest they take,    It seems we are the first awake!     —Strong heart! this is no royal way,    A thousand cross-roads seek the day;    And, hid from us, to left and right,    A thousand seekers seek the light.     AWAY WITH FUNERAL MUSIC      AWAY with funeral music—set       The pipe to powerful lips—    The cup of life’s for him that drinks       And not for him that sips.     TO SYDNEY      NOT thine where marble-still and white    Old statues share the tempered light    And mock the uneven modern flight,       But in the stream    Of daily sorrow and delight       To seek a theme.     I too, O friend, have steeled my heart    Boldly to choose the better part,    To leave the beaten ways of art,       And wholly free    To dare, beyond the scanty chart,       The deeper sea.     All vain restrictions left behind,    Frail bark! I loose my anchored mind    And large, before the prosperous wind       Desert the strand—    A new Columbus sworn to find       The morning land.     Nor too ambitious, friend.  To thee    I own my weakness.  Not for me    To sing the enfranchised nations’ glee,       Or count the cost    Of warships foundered far at sea       And battles lost.     High on the far-seen, sunny hills,    Morning-content my bosom fills;    Well-pleased, I trace the wandering rills       And learn their birth.    Far off, the clash of sovereign wills       May shake the earth.     The nimble circuit of the wheel,    The uncertain poise of merchant weal,    Heaven of famine, fire and steel       When nations fall;    These, heedful, from afar I feel—       I mark them all.     But not, my friend, not these I sing,    My voice shall fill a narrower ring.    Tired souls, that flag upon the wing,       I seek to cheer:    Brave wines to strengthen hope I bring,       Life’s cantineer!     Some song that shall be suppling oil    To weary muscles strained with toil,    Shall hearten for the daily moil,       Or widely read    Make sweet for him that tills the soil       His daily bread.     Such songs in my flushed hours I dream    (High thought) instead of armour gleam    Or warrior cantos ream by ream       To load the shelves—    Songs with a lilt of words, that seem       To sing themselves.     HAD I THE POWER THAT HAVE THE WILL      HAD I the power that have the will,       The enfeebled will—a modern curse—    This book of mine should blossom still       A perfect garden-ground of verse.     White placid marble gods should keep       Good watch in every shadowy lawn;    And from clean, easy-breathing sleep       The birds should waken me at dawn.     —A fairy garden;—none the less       Throughout these gracious paths of mine    All day there should be free access       For stricken hearts and lives that pine;     And by the folded lawns all day—       No idle gods for such a land—    All active Love should take its way       With active Labour hand in hand.     O DULL COLD NORTHERN SKY      O DULL cold northern sky,       O brawling sabbath bells,    O feebly twittering Autumn bird that tells       The year is like to die!     O still, spoiled trees, O city ways,       O sun desired in vain,    O dread presentiment of coming rain       That cloys the sullen days!     Thee, heart of mine, I greet.       In what hard mountain pass    Striv’st thou?  In what importunate morass       Sink now thy weary feet?     Thou run’st a hopeless race       To win despair.  No crown    Awaits success, but leaden gods look down       On thee, with evil face.     And those that would befriend       And cherish thy defeat,    With angry welcome shall turn sour the sweet       Home-coming of the end.     Yea, those that offer praise       To idleness, shall yet    Insult thee, coming glorious in the sweat       Of honourable ways.     APOLOGETIC POSTSCRIPT OF A YEAR LATER      IF you see this song, my dear,       And last year’s toast,    I’m confoundedly in fear    You’ll be serious and severe       About the boast.     Blame not that I sought such aid       To cure regret.    I was then so lowly laid    I used all the Gasconnade       That I could get.     Being snubbed is somewhat smart,       Believe, my sweet;    And I needed all my art    To restore my broken heart       To its conceit.     Come and smile, dear, and forget       I boasted so,    I apologise—regret—    It was all a jest;—and—yet—       I do not know.     TO MARCUS      YOU have been far, and I          Been farther yet,       Since last, in foul or fair       An impecunious pair,    Below this northern sky          Of ours, we met.     Now winter night shall see          Again us two,       While howls the tempest higher,       Sit warmly by the fire    And dream and plan, as we          Were wont to do.     And, hand in hand, at large          Our thoughts shall walk       While storm and gusty rain,       Again and yet again,    Shall drive their noisy charge          Across the talk.     The pleasant future still          Shall smile to me,       And hope with wooing hands       Wave on to fairy lands    All over dale and hill          And earth and sea.     And you who doubt the sky          And fear the sun—       You—Christian with the pack—       You shall not wander back    For I am Hopeful—I          Will cheer you on.     Come—where the great have trod,          The great shall lead—       Come, elbow through the press,       Pluck Fortune by the dress—    By God, we must—by God,          We shall succeed.     TO OTTILIE      YOU remember, I suppose,    How the August sun arose,       And how his face    Woke to trill and carolette    All the cages that were set       About the place.     In the tender morning light    All around lay strange and bright       And still and sweet,    And the gray doves unafraid    Went their morning promenade       Along the street.     THIS GLOOMY NORTHERN DAY      THIS gloomy northern day,       Or this yet gloomier night,          Has moved a something high          In my cold heart; and I,    That do not often pray,       Would pray to-night.     And first on Thee I call       For bread, O God of might!          Enough of bread for all,—         "]]]
