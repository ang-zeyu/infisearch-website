[_Vide_ \"Cruise of the Snowbird.\"  Same Author and Publishers.]  He is far more smartly dressed, he is more active looking, and more the man, had taken him in hand.  He had caused him to study his trade of boat-builder in a far more scientific fashion, with the result that he was now, as our story opens, foreman over all the men employed on the ship in which Ralph Leigh stood.  Indeed, McBain himself, as well as Ap, were good examples of what earnest study can effect.  There is hardly anything which either boy or man cannot learn if he applies his mind thereto.  \"What cheer, Mr Ap Ewen?\" said McBain.  \"More hands wanted, sir,\" said Ap, pulling out his snuff-box and taking a vigorous pinch.  \"More hands, Ap?\" exclaimed McBain.  \"Ay, sir, ay; look you see,\" replied Ap, \"you told me to hurry on, you see, and on Monday we shall want to begin the saloon bulkheads.\"  \"Bravo!  Ap, bravo! come to my office to-night at seven, and we'll put that all straight.\"  \"Thank you, sir,\" said Ap, touching his hat and retiring.  Ralph Leigh was owner of the splendid composite steamship that was now fast nearing her completion.  She was not being built by contract, but privately, and McBain was head controller of every department, and for every department he had hired experts to carry on the work.  The vessel was designed for special service, and therefore she must be a vessel of purity, a vessel of strength.  There must not be a flaw in her, not a patch--all must be solid, all must be good.  McBain had hired experts to examine everything ere it was purchased, but he made use of his own eyes and ears as well. The yard in which the ship was built was rented, and every bit of timber that entered it was tested first, whether it were oak or teak, pine, mahogany, or cedar; and the iron the same, and the bolts of copper and steel, so that Captain McBain's work was really no sinecure.  \"Well, then,\" said Ralph, \"I've been over all the ship; I'm extremely pleased with the way things are going on, so if you have nothing more to say to me I'm off.  By the way, do the people still flock down on Friday afternoons to look over the ship?\"  \"They do,\" replied McBain; \"and poor old Ap, I feel sorry for him.  _He_ gets no Friday half-holiday; he won't let me stop, but he insists upon remaining himself to show the people round.\"  \"And the people enjoy it?\"  \"They do.  They marvel at our engines, as well they may.  The gear, so simple and strong, that Ap and I invented for the shipping and unshipping of the rudder, and the easy method we have for elevating the screw out of the water and reducing the vessel to a sailing ship, they think little short of miraculous.  They are astonished, too, at the extraordinary strength of build of the ship.  Indeed, they are highly complimentary to us in their general admiration.  But,\" continued McBain, laughing aloud, \"it would amuse you to hear the remarks of some of these good, innocent souls.  The two 12-pounder Dalgrens are universal favourites.  They pat them as if they loved them.  One girl last Friday said `they just looked for a' the warld like a couple o' big iron soda-water bottles.'  They linger in the armoury; old Ap shows them our `express' rifles, and our `bone-crushers,' and the hardened and explosive bullets: then he takes them to the harpoon-room and shows them the harpoons, and the guns, and the electric apparatus, and all the other gear.  They stare open-mouthed at the balloon-room and the sledge-lockers, but when they come to the door of the torpedo-chamber they simply hurry past with looks of awe.  It is currently reported that we are bound for the very North Pole itself; I'm not sure we are not going to bring it back home with us.  Anyhow, they say that as soon as we reach the ice, we are to fill our balloons, attaching one to each mast and funnel, and float away and away over the sea of ancient ice until we reach the Pole.\"  Ralph laughed right merrily, and next minute he was over the side, with his face set townwards, trudging steadily on to the railway-station.  It was only a trifle over three miles; there were cabs to be had in abundance, but what young man would ride if he had time to walk?  Ralph was going home.  Not to his fair English home far away in the south, for ever since, in the early spring-time--and now it was autumn-- the keel of the ship--_his_ ship--had been laid, Ralph had taken up his abode in a rustic cottage by the banks of a broad-bosomed lake in the Highlands of Argyll.  Wild though the country was all around, it was but four miles from the railway, and this journey he used to accomplish twice or oftener every week, on the back of a daft-looking Welsh pony that he had bought for the purpose.  Once on board the train, two hours took him to the city, and thence a brisk walk to the building-yard.  He had watched, week after week, the gradual progress of his ship towards completion, with an interest and a joy that were quite boyish. He dearly loved to see the men at work, and listen to their cheerful voices as they laboured.  Even the smell of the pine or cedar shavings was perfume to Ralph, and the way he used to climb about and wander over and through the ship, when she was little more than ribs, knees, and beams, was quite amusing.  But he was nevertheless always happy to get back to his Highland home, his books, his boat, and his fishing-rod.  She was a widow who owned the humble cottage, but she was kind and good, and Ralph's rooms, that looked away out over the lake, were always kept in a state of perfect cleanliness.  The widow had one little daughter, a sweetly pretty and intelligent child, over whose fair wee head five summers had hardly rolled.  Jeannie was her name, Jeannie Morrison, and she was an especial pet of Ralph's.  She and the collie dog always came gleefully down the road to meet him on his return from the distant city, and you may be perfectly sure he always brought something nice in his pocket for the pair of them.  When tired of reading, Ralph used to romp with wee Jeannie, or take her on his knee and tell her wonderful stories, which made her blue eyes grow bigger and more earnest than ever as she listened.  In fact, Jeannie and Ralph were very fond of each other, indeed, and every time he went to a romantic little island out in the lake to fish, he took Jeannie in the stern of the boat, and the time passed doubly quick.  \"Oh, Mista Walph!  Mista Walph!\" cried Jeannie, bursting into Ralph's room one afternoon, clapping her hands with joy.  \"Mista McBain is coming; Capping McBain is coming.\"  \"Yes,\" said Mistress Morrison, entering behind her little daughter. \"I'm sure you'll be delighted, sir, and so am I, for the captain hasn't been here for a month.\"  Then Ralph got his hat, and, accompanied by the honest collie and his favourite Jeannie, went off down the road to meet McBain and bid him welcome to his Highland home.  CHAPTER TWO.  THE DINNER BY THE LAKE--RORY'S RUN ROUND AFRICA--THE RETURN OF THE WANDERERS.  \"When did you hear from Allan and Rory?\" asked McBain that day, as they were seated at dinner in the little Highland cottage.  Mrs Morrison had done her best to put something nice before them, and not without success either--so thought Ralph, and so, too, thought his guest.  At all events, both of them did ample justice to that noble lake trout.  Five pounds did he weigh, if he weighed an ounce, and as red was he in flesh as if he had been fed upon beet.  The juicy joint of mountain mutton that followed was fit to grace the table of a prince--it was as fragrant and sweet as the blooming heather tops that had brought it to perfection.  Nor was the cranberry tart to be despised.  The berries of which it was composed had not come over the Atlantic in a barrel of questionable flavour--no, they had been culled on the dewy braelands that very morning by the fair young fingers of wee Jeannie Morrison herself.  The widow did not forget to tell them that, and it did not detract from their enjoyment of the tart.  For drink they had fragrant heather ale--home-brewed.  \"When did I hear from Allan and Rory?\" said Ralph, repeating McBain's question; \"from the first, not for weeks--he is a lazy boy; from the latter, only yesterday morning.\"  \"And what says Rory?\" asked McBain.  \"Oh!\" replied Ralph, \"his letter is beautiful.  It is twelve pages long. He is loud in his praises of the behaviour of the yacht, as a matter of course; but in no single sentence of this lengthy epistle does he refer definitely to the health or welfare of anybody whatever.\"  \"From which you infer--?\"  \"From which I infer,\" said Ralph, \"that everybody is as well as Rory himself--that my dear father is well, and Allan, and his mother, and his sister Helen Edith.  He is a queer boy, Rory, and he encloses me a couple of columns from a Cape of Good Hope paper, in which he has written an epitome of the whole voyage, since they first started in May last.  He calls his yarn `Right round Africa.'  He commences at Suez, a place where even boy Rory, I should think, would fail to find much poetry and romance; but they must have enjoyed themselves at Alexandria, where Rory mounted on top of Pompey's Pillar, rode upon donkeys, and did all kinds of queer things.  Well, they spent a week at Malta, with its streets of stairs, its bells, its priests, its convents, and its blood-oranges.  Rory missed trees and shade, though; he says Malta is a capital place for lizards, or any animal, human or otherwise, that cares to spend the day basking on the top of a stone.  He liked Tunis and Algiers better, and he quite enjoyed Teneriffe and Madeira.  Then they crossed over to Sierra Leone, and he launches forth in praise of the awful forests--`primeval,' he calls them--and he says, in his own inimitable Irish way, that `they are dark, bedad, even in broad daylight.'

Of course they didn't miss looking in at Saint Helena, which he designates a paradise in mid-ocean, and not a lonely sea-girt rock, as old books call it.  Ascension was their next place of resort.  That is a rock, if you like, he says; but the sea-birds' eggs and the turtle are redeeming features.  And so on to the Cape, and up the Mozambique, landing here and there at beautiful villages and towns, and in woods where they picked the oysters off the trees.\"  [Oysters growing on trees seems a strange paradox.  They do so grow, however.  The mangrove-trees are washed by the tide, and to their tortuous roots oysters adhere, which may be gathered at low water.]  \"They really must be enjoying themselves,\" said McBain.  \"That they are,\" Ralph replied, pulling out Rory's letter.  \"Just listen how charmingly he writes of the Indian Ocean--nobody else save our own poetic Rory could so write:--`My dear, honest, unsophisticated Ralph,-- oh, you ought to have been with us as we rounded the Cape!  That thunderstorm by night would have made even your somewhat torpid blood tingle in your veins.  It was night, my Ralph; what little wind there was was dead off the iron-bound coast, but the billows were mountains high.  Yes, this is no figure of speech.  I have never seen such waves before, and mayhap never will again.  I have never seen such lightning, and never heard such thunder.  We remained all night on deck; no one had the slightest wish to go below.  As I write our yacht is bounding over a blue and rippling sea; the low, wooded shore on our lee is sleeping in the warm sunlight, and everything around us breathes peace and quiet, and yet I have but to clap my hand across my eyes, and once again the whole scene rises up before me.  I see the lightning quivering on the dark waves, and flashing incessantly around us, with intervals of the blackest darkness.  I see the good yacht clinging by the bows to the crest of the waves, or plunging arrowlike into the watery ravines; I see the wet and slippery decks and cordage, and the awe-struck men around the bulwarks; and I see the faces of my friends as I saw them then-- Allan's knitted brow, his mother's looks of terror, and the pale features of poor Helen Edith.  There are nights, Ralph, in the life of a sailor that he is but little likely ever to forget; that was one in mine that will cling to my memory till I cease to breathe.'  \"Don't you call that graphic?\" said Ralph.  \"I do,\" replied McBain; \"give us one other extract, and then lend me the letter.  I'll take it to town with me, and you can have it again when you come up.\"  \"Well,\" said Ralph, \"he describes Delagoa Bay and the scenery all round it so pleasantly, that if I hadn't an estate of my own in old England I would run off and take a farm there; right quaintly he talks of the curious Portuguese city of Mozambique; he is loud in the praises of the Comoro Islands, especially of Johanna, with its groves of citrons and limes, its feathery palm-trees, and its lofty mountains, tree-clad to the very summits; and he could write a lordly volume, he says, on the sultanic city of Zanzibar, where, it would seem, his adventures were not like angels' visits--few and far between.  He has even fought with the wild Somali Indians, and assisted at a pitched battle between Arabs and a British cruiser.  Then he describes his adventures in the woods and in the far-off hills and jungles, tiger-slaying; here is a serpent adventure; here is a butterfly hunt.  Fancy butterflies as big as a lady's fan, and of plumage--yes, that is the very word Rory makes use of--`plumage' more bright than a noonday rainbow.  \"Here again is a description of the great Johanna hornet, two inches long, blue-black in colour, and so dreaded by the natives that they will not approach within twenty yards of the tree these terrible insects inhabit.  Here is a beetle as big as a fish, and as strong apparently as a man, for he seizes hold of the top of the big pickle-jar into which Rory wants to introduce him, and obstinately refuses to be drowned in spirits; and here is a centipede as long as an adder, green, transparent, deadly; tarantulas as big as frogs, hairy and horrible; scorpions as big as crabs, green and dangerous as the centipedes themselves, that run from you, it is true, but threaten you as they run.  \"It is pleasant,\" continued Ralph, \"to turn from his descriptions of the awful African creepie-creepies, and read of the enchanting beauty of some parts of the Zanzibar woods, the mighty trees mango-laden, the patches of tempting pine-apples, through which one can hardly wade, the curious breadfruit-trees, the pomolos, the citrons, the oranges, and the guavas, that look and taste, says Rory, `like strawberries smothered in cream.'  He dilates, too, on the beauty of the wild flowers, and the brilliancy of the birds--birds that never sing, but flit sadly and silently from bough to bough in the golden sunlight.  From the very centre of this beautiful wood Rory, with masterly pen, carries you right away to a lovely coral island in the Indian Ocean.  \"`Although many, many miles in extent,' he tells us, `although it is clothed in waving woods, although even the cocoa-nut palm waves high aloft its luscious fruit, it is not inhabited by man.  Perhaps my boat was the first that ever rasped upon its shore of silvery sand, perhaps I was the first human being that ever lay under the shade of its mangrove-trees or bathed in the waters of its sunny lagune.  My boat is a skiff--a tiny skiff; our yacht lies at anchor off Chak-Chak, and I have come all alone to visit this fairy-like island.  I left the ship while the stars were still glittering in the heavens, long before the sun leapt up and turned the waters into blood; and now I have rested, bathed, and breakfasted, and am once more on board my indolent skiff. Here in this bay, even half a mile from the shore, you can see the bottom distinct and clear, for the water is as pellucid as crystal, and there isn't a ripple on the sea.  And what do I gaze upon?--A submarine garden; and I gaze upon it like one enchanted, the while my boat-- impelled by the tide alone--glides slowly on and over it.  Down yonder are flowers of every shape and hue, shrubs of every variety of foliage, coral bushes--pink, and white, and even black--rocks covered with medusae of the most brilliant colours an artist could imagine, and patches of white sand, strewn with living shells, each one more lovely to look upon than another.  And every bush and shrub and flower is all a-quiver with a strange, indescribable motion, which greatly heightens their magical beauty; and why?  Because every bush and shrub and flower is composed of a thousand living things.  But the larger creatures that creep and crawl, or glide through this submarine garden are fantastic in the extreme.  Monster crabs and crayfish, horny, abhorrent, and so strange in shape one cannot help thinking they were made to frighten each other; long transparent fishes, partly grayling partly eel; flat fishes that swim in all kinds of ridiculous ways; some fishes that seem all tail together, and others that are nothing but head.  And among all the others a curious flat fish that swims on an even keel, and, by the very brilliancy of his colours and gorgeous array, seems to quite take the shine out of all the others.  Both sides of this fish are painted alike; both sides of him are divided into five or six equal parts, and each part is of a different colour--one is a marigold yellow, another green, another brightest crimson, another steel grey, and so on.  Him I dubbed the harlequin flounder.  Yes, Ralph, Shakespeare was right when he said there are more things in heaven and earth than we dream of in our philosophy, and he might have added there are more things in ocean's depths, and stranger things, than any naturalist ever could imagine.'  \"You see,\" said Ralph, folding Rory's funny letter, and handing it to McBain, \"that our friends are enjoying themselves; but you won't fail to notice Rory's closing sentence, in which he says that, in the very midst of all the brightness and beauty so lavishly spread around him, he is ofttimes longing to visit once more the strange, mysterious regions around the Pole.\"  \"And you have never written a word to him about our new ship and our purposed voyage?\" inquired McBain.  \"Never a word,\" cried Ralph, laughing.  \"You see, I want to keep that a secret till the very last.  Oh, fancy, McBain, how wild with glee both Rory and Allan will be when they find that the splendid ship is built and ready, and that we but wait for the return of spring to carry us once more away to the far north again.\"  \"I'd like to see Rory's face,\" said McBain, smiling, \"when you break the news to him.\"  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  Just six weeks after this quiet little _tete-a-tete_ dinner on the bank of the Highland lake, a very important-looking and fussy little tug-boat come puff-puffing up the Clyde from seaward, towing in a large and pretty yacht; her sails were clewed, and her yards squared, and everything looked trig and trim, not only about her, but on board of her.  The blue ensign floated proudly from her staff; her crew were dressed in true yachting rig, and her decks were white as the driven snow.  An elderly lady with snow-white hair paced slowly up and down the quarter-deck, leaning lightly on the arm of a tall and gentlemanly man of mature age.  In a lounge chair right aft, and abreast of the binnacle, a fair young girl was reclining, book in lap, but not reading; she was engaged in pleasant conversation with a youth who sat on a camp-stool not far off, while another who leant upon the taffrail gazing shorewards frequently turned towards them, to put in his oar with a word or two.  He was taller than the"]]]
