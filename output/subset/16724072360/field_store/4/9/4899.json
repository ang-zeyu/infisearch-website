In addition to what I learned from the Quakers I received about the same time, also from America, some information on the subject from a source perfectly distinct and previously unknown to me.  The son of William Lloyd Garrison, the famous champion of the emancipation of the negroes, wrote to me that he had read my book, in which he found ideas similar to those expressed by his father in the year 1838, and that, thinking it would be interesting to me to know this, he sent me a declaration or proclamation of \"non-resistance\" drawn up by his father nearly fifty years ago.  This declaration came about under the following circumstances: William Lloyd Garrison took part in a discussion on the means of suppressing war in the Society for the Establishment of Peace among Men, which existed in 1838 in America.  He came to the conclusion that the establishment of universal peace can only be founded on the open profession of the doctrine of non-resistance to evil by violence (Matt. v. 39), in its full significance, as understood by the Quakers, with whom Garrison happened to be on friendly relations. Having come to this conclusion, Garrison thereupon composed and laid before the society a declaration, which was signed at the time--in 1838--by many members.     \"DECLARATION OF SENTIMENTS ADOPTED BY PEACE CONVENTION.    \"Boston, 1838.     \"We the undersigned, regard it as due to ourselves, to the    cause which we love, to the country in which we live, to    publish a declaration expressive of the purposes we aim to    accomplish and the measures we shall adopt to carry forward the    work of peaceful universal reformation.     \"We do not acknowledge allegiance to any human government.  We    recognize but one King and Lawgiver, one Judge and Ruler of    mankind.  Our country is the world, our countrymen are all    mankind.  We love the land of our nativity only as we love all    other lands.  The interests and rights of American citizens are    not dearer to us than those of the whole human race.  Hence we    can allow no appeal to patriotism to revenge any national    insult or injury...     \"We conceive that a nation has no right to defend itself    against foreign enemies or to punish its invaders, and no    individual possesses that right in his own case, and the unit    cannot be of greater importance than the aggregate.  If    soldiers thronging from abroad with intent to commit rapine and    destroy life may not be resisted by the people or the    magistracy, then ought no resistance to be offered to domestic    troublers of the public peace or of private security.     \"The dogma that all the governments of the world are    approvingly ordained of God, and that the powers that be in the    United States, in Russia, in Turkey, are in accordance with his    will, is no less absurd than impious.  It makes the impartial    Author of our existence unequal and tyrannical. It cannot be    affirmed that the powers that be in any nation are actuated by    the spirit or guided by the example of Christ in the treatment    of enemies; therefore they cannot be agreeable to the will of    God, and therefore their overthrow by a spiritual regeneration    of their subjects is inevitable.     \"We regard as unchristian and unlawful not only all wars,    whether offensive or defensive, but all preparations for war;    every naval ship, every arsenal, every fortification, we regard    as unchristian and unlawful; the existence of any kind of     standing army, all military chieftains, all monuments    commemorative of victory over a fallen foe, all trophies won in    battle, all celebrations in honor of military exploits, all    appropriations for defense by arms; we regard as unchristian    and unlawful every edict of government requiring of its    subjects military service.     \"Hence we deem it unlawful to bear arms, and we cannot hold any    office which imposes on its incumbent the obligation to compel    men to do right on pain of imprisonment or death.  We therefore    voluntarily exclude ourselves from every legislative and    judicial body, and repudiate all human politics, worldly    honors, and stations of authority.  If we cannot occupy a seat    in the legislature or on the bench, neither can we elect others    to act as our substitutes in any such capacity.  It follows    that we cannot sue any man at law to force him to return    anything he may have wrongly taken from us; if he has seized    our coat, we shall surrender him our cloak also rather than    subject him to punishment.     \"We believe that the penal code of the old covenant--an eye for    an eye, and a tooth for a tooth--has been abrogated by Jesus    Christ, and that under the new covenant the forgiveness instead    of the punishment of enemies has been enjoined on all his    disciples in all cases whatsoever.  To extort money from    enemies, cast them into prison, exile or execute them, is    obviously not to forgive but to take retribution.     \"The history of mankind is crowded with evidences proving that    physical coercion is not adapted to moral regeneration, and    that the sinful dispositions of men can be subdued only by    love; that evil can be exterminated only by good; that it is    not safe to rely upon the strength of an arm to preserve us    from harm; that there is great security in being gentle,    long-suffering, and abundant in mercy; that it is only the meek    who shall inherit the earth; for those who take up the sword    shall perish by the sword.     \"Hence as a measure of sound policy--of safety to property,    life, and liberty--of public quietude and private enjoyment--as    well as on the ground of allegiance to Him who is King of kings    and Lord of lords, we cordially adopt the non-resistance    principle, being confident that it provides for all possible    consequences, is armed with omnipotent power, and must    ultimately triumph over every assailing force.     \"We advocate no Jacobinical doctrines.  The spirit of    Jacobinism is the spirit of retaliation, violence, and murder.    It neither fears God nor regards man.  We would be filled with    the spirit of Christ.  If we abide evil by our fundamental    principle of not opposing evil by evil we cannot participate in    sedition, treason, or violence.  We shall submit to every    ordinance and every requirement of government, except such as    are contrary to the commands of the Gospel, and in no case    resist the operation of law, except by meekly submitting to the    penalty of disobedience.     \"But while we shall adhere to the doctrine of non-resistance    and passive submission to enemies, we purpose, in a moral and    spiritual sense, to assail iniquity in high places and in low    places, to apply our principles to all existing evil,    political, legal, and ecclesiastical institutions, and to    hasten the time when the kingdoms of this world will have    become the kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ.  It appears to us    a self-evident truth that whatever the Gospel is designed to    destroy at any period of the world, being contrary to it, ought    now to be abandoned.  If, then, the time is predicted when    swords shall be beaten into plowshares and spears into pruning    hooks, and men shall not learn the art of war any more, it    follows that all who manufacture, sell, or wield these deadly    weapons do thus array themselves against the peaceful dominion    of the Son of God on earth.     \"Having thus stated our principles, we proceed to specify the    measures we propose to adopt in carrying our object into    effect.     \"We expect to prevail through the Foolishness of Preaching.  We    shall endeavor to promulgate our views among all persons, to    whatever nation, sect, or grade of society they may belong.    Hence we shall organize public lectures, circulate tracts and    publications, form societies, and petition every governing    body.  It will be our leading object to devise ways and means    for effecting a radical change in the views, feelings, and    practices of society respecting the sinfulness of war and the    treatment of enemies.     \"In entering upon the great work before us, we are not    unmindful that in its prosecution we may be called to test    our sincerity even as in a fiery ordeal.  It may subject us to    insult, outrage, suffering, yea, even death itself.  We    anticipate no small amount of misconception, misrepresentation,    and calumny.  Tumults may arise against us.  The proud and    pharisaical, the ambitious and tyrannical, principalities and    powers, may combine to crush us.  So they treated the Messiah    whose example we are humbly striving to imitate.  We"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4602"],["title","\"The Kingdom of God Is Within You\" (#2)"],["body"," not    be afraid of their terror.  Our confidence is in the Lord    Almighty and not in man.  Having withdrawn from human    protection, what can sustain us but that faith which overcomes    the world?  We shall not think it strange concerning the fiery    trial which is to try us, but rejoice inasmuch as we are    partakers of Christ's sufferings.     \"Wherefore we commit the keeping of our souls to God. For every    one that forsakes houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father,    or mother, or wife, or children, or lands for Christ's sake,    shall receive a hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting    life.     \"Firmly relying upon the certain and universal triumph of the    sentiments contained in this declaration, however formidable    may be the opposition arrayed against them, we hereby affix our    signatures to it; commending it to the reason and conscience of    mankind, and resolving, in the strength of the Lord God, to    calmly and meekly abide the issue.\"  Immediately after this declaration a Society for Non-resistance was founded by Garrison, and a journal called the NON-RESISTANT, in which the doctrine of non-resistance was advocated in its full significance and in all its consequences, as it had been expounded in the declaration.  Further information as to the ultimate destiny of the society and the journal I gained from the excellent biography of W. L. Garrison, the work of his son.  The society and the journal did not exist for long.  The greater number of Garrison's fellow-workers in the movement for the liberation of the slaves, fearing that the too radical programme of the journal, the NON-RESISTANT, might keep people away from the practical work of negro-emancipation, gave up the profession of the principle of non-resistance as it had been expressed in the declaration, and both society and journal ceased to exist.  This declaration of Garrison's gave so powerful and eloquent an expression of a confession of faith of such importance to men, that one would have thought it must have produced a strong impression on people, and have become known throughout the world and the subject of discussion on every side.  But nothing of the kind occurred.  Not only was it unknown in Europe, even the Americans, who have such a high opinion of Garrison, hardly knew of the declaration.  Another champion of non-resistance has been overlooked in the same way--the American Adin Ballou, who lately died, after spending fifty years in preaching this doctrine. Lord God, to calmly and meekly abide the doctrine. How great the ignorance is of everything relating to the question of non-resistance may be seen from the fact that Garrison the son, who has written an excellent biography of his father in four great volumes, in answer to my inquiry whether there are existing now societies for non-resistance, and adherents of the doctrine, told me that as far as he knew that society had broken up, and that there were no adherents of that doctrine, while at the very time when he was writing to me there was living, at Hopedale in Massachusetts, Adin Ballou, who had taken part in the labors of Garrison the father, and had devoted fifty years of his life to advocating, both orally and in print, the doctrine of non-resistance. Later on I received a letter from Wilson, a pupil and colleague of Ballou's, and entered into correspondence with Ballou himself. I wrote to Ballou, and he answered me and sent me his works. Here is the summary of some extracts from them:     \"Jesus Christ is my Lord and teacher,\" says Ballou in one of    his essays exposing the inconsistency of Christians who allowed    a right of self-defense and of warfare.  \"I have promised    leaving all else, to follow good and through evil, to death    itself.  But I am a citizen of the democratic republic of the    United States; and in allegiance to it I have sworn to defend    the Constitution of my country, if need be, with my life.    Christ requires of me to do unto others as I would they should    do unto me.  The Constitution of the United States requires of    me to do unto two millions of slaves [at that time there were    slaves; now one might venture to substitute the word    'laborers'] the very opposite of what I would they should do    unto me--that is to help to keep them in their present    condition of slavery.  And, in spite of this, I continue to    elect or be elected, I propose to vote, I am even ready to be    appointed to any office under government.  That will not hinder    me from being a Christian.  I shall still profess Christianity,    and shall find no difficulty in carrying out my covenant    with Christ and with the government.     \"Jesus Christ forbids me to resist evil doers, and to take from    them an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, bloodshed for    bloodshed, and life for life.     \"My government demands from me quite the opposite, and bases a    system of self-defense on gallows, musket, and sword, to be    used against its foreign and domestic foes.  And the land is    filled accordingly with gibbets, prisons, arsenals, ships of    war, and soldiers.     \"In the maintenance and use of these expensive appliances for    murder, we can very suitably exercise to the full the virtues    of forgiveness to those who injure us, love toward our enemies,    blessings to those who curse us, and doing good to those who    hate us.     \"For this we have a succession of Christian priests to pray for    us and beseech the blessing of Heaven on the holy work of    slaughter.     \"I see all this (i. e., the contradiction between profession and    practice), and I continue to profess religion and take part in    government, and pride myself on being at the same time a devout    Christian and a devoted servant of the government.  I do not    want to agree with these senseless notions of non-resistance.    I cannot renounce my authority and leave only immoral men in    control of the government.  The Constitution says the    government has the right to declare war, and I assent to this    and support it, and swear that I will support it.  And I do not    for that cease to be a Christian. War, too, is a Christian    duty.  Is it not a Christian duty to kill hundreds of thousands    of one's fellow-men, to outrage women, to raze and burn towns,    and to practice every possible cruelty?  It is time to dismiss    all these false sentimentalities.  It is the truest means of    forgiving injuries and loving enemies.  If we only do it in the    spirit of love, nothing can be more Christian than such    murder.\"  In another pamphlet, entitled \"How many Men are Necessary to Change a Crime into a Virtue?\" he says: \"One man may not kill.  If he kills a fellow-creature, he is a murderer.  If two, ten, a hundred men do so, they, too, are murderers.  But a government or a nation may kill as many men as it chooses, and that will not be murder, but a great and noble action.  Only gather the people together on a large scale, and a battle of ten thousand men becomes an innocent action.  But precisely how many people must there be to make it so?--that is the question.  One man cannot plunder and pillage, but a whole nation can.  But precisely how many are needed to make it permissible?  Why is it that one man, ten, a hundred, may not break the law of God, but a great number may?\"  And here is a version of Ballou's catechism composed for his flock:     CATECHISM OF NON-RESISTANCE.     Q. Whence is the word \"non-resistance\" derived?     A. From the command, \"Resist not evil.\" (M. v. 39.)     Q. What does this word express?     A. It expresses a lofty Christian virtue enjoined on us by    Christ.     Q. Ought the word \"non-resistance\" to be taken in its widest    sense--that is to say, as intending that we should not offer    any resistance of any kind to evil?     A. No; it ought to be taken in the exact sense of our Saviour's    teaching--that is, not repaying evil for evil.  We ought to    oppose evil by every righteous means in our power, but not by    evil.     Q. What is there to show that Christ enjoined non-resistance in    that sense?     A. It is shown by the words he uttered at the same time.  He    said: \"Ye have heard, it was said of old, An eye for an eye,    and a tooth for a tooth.  But I say unto you Resist not evil.    But if one smites thee on the right cheek, turn him the other    also; and if one will go to law with thee to take thy coat from    thee, give him thy cloak also.\"     Q. Of whom was he speaking in the words, \"Ye have heard it was    said of old\"?     A. Of the patriarchs and the prophets, contained in the Old    Testament, which the Hebrews ordinarily call the Law and the    Prophets.     Q. What utterances did Christ refer to in the words, \"It was    said of old\"?     A. The utterances of Noah, Moses, and the other prophets, in    which they admit the right of doing bodily harm to those who    inflict harm, so as to punish and prevent evil deeds.     Q. Quote such utterances.     A. \"Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be    shed.\"--GEN. ix. 6.     \"He that smiteth a man, so that he die, shall be surely put to    death... And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life    for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for    foot, burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.\"    --Ex. xxi. 12 and 23-25.     \"He that killeth any man shall surely be put to death.  And if    a man cause a blemish in his neighbor, as he hath done, so    shall it be done unto him: breach for breach, eye for eye,    tooth for tooth.\"--LEV. xxiv. 17, 19, 20.     \"Then the judges shall make diligent inquisition; and behold,    if the witness be a false witness, and hath testified falsely    against his brother, then shall ye do unto him as he had    thought to have done unto his brother... And thine eye shall not    pity; but life shall go for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth,    hand for hand, foot"]]]
