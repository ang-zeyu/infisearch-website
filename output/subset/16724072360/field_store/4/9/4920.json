They swung along to the music of their band—a clean-cut, well-set-up, manly lot, who marched with the firm independent step of the free born. Suddenly our colonel discovered a familiar face among the khaki-clad below.  There is no military precedent for what he did; years of training fell away on the instant.  He leaned from the car and shouted:  \"Hello, ’Foghorn’!  What cheer?\"  \"Foghorn\" looked up.  His right arm was somewhat hampered, from a military point of view, by reason of being about the waist of a pretty girl, who accommodatingly marched along with the battalion in general, and \"Foghorn\" in particular.  \"Hello, Jack,\" he bellowed in a voice which easily accounted for his nickname.  \"Lots of cheer.  Can’t salute.  One arm busy!  Other is glass arm from saluting the brass hats. See you later.  Good luck!\"  And thus our cosmopolitan and ultra-democratic battalion passed on.  Some one has said that the Englishman is temperamentally cold.  It can’t be proved by Devonport or Plymouth.  His temperature in both towns registered ninety-eight degrees in the shadiest and most secluded spots. And the women and children!  Banish all thought of British frigidity! The Canadians in England never discovered it.  The passion of the Devonport children for souvenirs in the shape of pennies and buttons became so violent in a few hours that our small coin was likely to become extinct and our buttons merely things that used to be.  Every time a soldier appeared upon the street he was instantly surrounded by a bevy of insistent and persistent mendicants.  Once we sought refuge in a cooling spot where glasses tinkle and the beer foams high—and children might not follow there. The pretty barmaid smiled.  The second in command twirled his long moustache and fixed the maiden with his martial eye.  \"What will you have, sir?\" she inquired sweetly.  The senior major was always gallant to a pretty girl.  He drew himself up to his full six feet, two, and saluted.  A mellow line from \"Omar Khayyám\" dropped from his thirsty lips:      _\"A jug of wine, a loaf of bread, and thou_     _Beside me singing in the wilderness.\"_   How much further he might have gone one cannot say.  The girl held up a reproving finger and exclaimed:  \"Ah, I see it is black coffee the gentleman requires.\"  But the major’s poetic spirit was aroused. \"Avaunt coffee,\" he cried.      _\"Shall I distress my ruddy soul_     _With dusky dregs from coffee urn?_     _Far sweeter, sweet, to quench its fire_     _With wine for which the ’innards’ yearn._  A glass of beer, please.\"  The adjutant leaned over toward me and hazarded, in a hoarse whisper:  \"I presume they have no ice.\"  The barmaid’s red cheeks dimpled and two straight rows of pearly teeth shone upon him, as she answered for me:  \"Your presumption is ill-founded, young man.  We have plenty of ice with which to temper the hot young blood of the Canadians.\"  The adjutant looked helplessly up, bereft of repartee; then apostrophised the ceiling:  \"And these are the stupid Englishwomen we have been led to expect!\"  Our education was going on apace.  A few moments later we emerged and discovered ourselves in a veritable whirlpool of young monetary gluttons.  \"Penny, sir! penny! penny!\" they shouted in staccato chorus.  Our supply of pennies had long since been depleted.  An idea struck me.  \"See here,\" I said in serious tone.  \"We’re only a lot of poor soldiers going to the war. We can’t always be giving away pennies. We need pennies worse than you do.\"  A sudden hush fell upon the little circle. Some looked abashed, others curiously uncertain, a few sympathetic.  The silence lasted a full minute.  We all stood still looking at one another.  \"Can any little boy or girl in this crowd give a poor soldier a penny to help him along to the war?\" I asked quietly.  Again silence.  Finally a little ragged tot of about eight years of age, carrying a baby in her arms, turned to her companions and said: \"Here, hold the baby for me and I’ll give the poor fellow a penny.\"  She dived deep in the pocket of her frock, brought out a penny, ha’penny (her total wealth) and held it out to me.  Lieutenant Moe stepped forward.  \"Look here, major,\" he said sternly, \"do you mean to say you’ll take that money from a youngster?\"  \"I do,\" I replied, without a smile.  \"I won’t permit it,\" he cried.  Here was an embarrassing situation.  I couldn’t explain to him without confessing to the child as well.  I wished to gauge how much patriotism beat in those little hearts, what sacrifice they were prepared to make for their country; and here was one measuring up to the highest ideals, I daren’t either withdraw or explain.  \"I must have the pennies, Moe, and I am going to take them,\" I replied firmly.  \"Stand aside, please!\"  Military discipline came to the rescue.  Moe saluted stiffly and stepped back.  The little girl gravely handed over the pennies and took back her baby.  \"Any others?\" I asked.  Some of the children declared they had none; a few looked sheepish and hung their heads.  I slipped a sixpence into the hand of the little lady.  \"Well, I’ll be damned!\" exclaimed Moe. \"Here’s another penny for you,\" and he handed the bewildered child half a crown.  A shout of surprise and dismay went up from the other children, who realised too late that they had failed in the test.  \"The drinks are certainly on me!\" Moe cried.  \"About turn!\"  Sometimes when I feel that the world is sordid and mean I go to my trunk and look at those two coins, and I know that somewhere, in a frail little body, beats a generous heart, and I feel that after all part of the world is worth while.                                   *CHAPTER II*   Reggy was on shore at last.  He said he felt much better walking alone up street—more as if he owned the town!  It’s a strange sensation stepping on solid ground after weeks on shipboard.  There is a lack of harmony between oneself and the ground. You rock—the ground stands still; you stand still—the ground rocks, like an angry sergeant.  The senior major was on the corner, holding an animated conversation with a beautifully gowned young lady, to whom he bid a hasty adieu as Reggy hove in sight.  \"Corking girl, that,\" said Reggy mischievously.  \"Where?\" demanded the major, looking about.  \"The young lady to whom you just avoided introducing me.\"  \"It’s rather a remarkable coincidence,\" said the major, avoiding controversy, \"that I should run across a relation in this far-away place!\"  \"Very!\" Reggy replied drily.  \"Family’s fond of travel, I take it.\"  A tall, well-knit young subaltern elbowed his way through the crowd and joined the pair.  Reggy greeted him:  \"Better come and have dinner with your brother and me, Tom.  I feel he needs good company and a chaperon or two!\"  The trio entered the rotunda of the _Royal_.  A distinguished looking gentleman and a prepossessing lady of middle age stood chatting together.  Their voices were agitated, and the three officers could not avoid overhearing snatches of the conversation.  \"He is on the _Cassandra_, and in this medley of ships no one seems to know where his is anchored,\" the man was saying.  \"Dear me,\" sighed the lady.  \"To think that our boy should be so near and that we should not be able to see him!  It’s dreadful!\"  \"But we must find him,\" the man declared reassuringly.  \"Surely there is some way of reaching the ship?\"  \"They tell me no one is allowed on board; and when the battalion disembarks they will be marched away.  What shall we do?\" she cried in great distress.  Reggy’s impulsive heart was touched.  He approached them and respectfully saluted.  \"A thousand pardons, sir,\" he said, \"for breaking in upon a private conversation, but I couldn’t help overhearing your words.  Can I be of any assistance to you?\"  \"It is very kind of you, indeed,\" the man answered in a rich voice of unusual gentility. \"Perhaps you can help us.  My son is aboard the _Cassandra_.  We haven’t seen him since he went to Canada four years ago.  He is only a Tommy, so cannot come ashore, and it seems impossible to get into communication with him.\"  \"What luck!\" Reggy exclaimed.  \"His ship and ours are anchored side by side; so close, in fact, that we have a connecting gang-way.\"  \"Oh, do you think we could get out to him?\" the mother asked anxiously. \"We have no permit to visit the ships.\"  \"If you can get authority to enter the dockyards, I’ll see what I can do to get you aboard to-morrow noon,\" Reggy answered.  \"I’ll meet you at the quay.\"  \"God bless you!\" exclaimed the lady, with tears in her eyes.  The following day, true to his word, Reggy, with a written permit in his pocket, ushered Mr. and Mrs. Hargreaves aboard the ship.  \"You will stay and lunch with me,\" said Reggy.  \"I’ll get your boy across, and we’ll all lunch together.\"  \"But I was under the impression that Tommies were not allowed to dine with officers,\" protested Mr. Hargreaves.  \"The deuce!  I’d forgotten all about that,\" Reggy exclaimed, as he scratched his head perplexedly.  \"Ah, I have it,\" he ejaculated a moment later; \"he shall be an officer during the meal.  I’ll lend him a tunic. No one else on board will know.\"  \"But I don’t wish you to get yourself into trouble,\" Mr. Hargreaves remonstrated.  Reggy laughed.  \"I love such trouble,\" he cried, \"and the risk fascinates me.  I’ll be back in a moment.\"  And he dashed off in his impetuous way.  In a short time he returned, bringing with him a handsome but much embarrassed youth, wearing a captain’s uniform.  But the sight which met his eyes banished all thought of clothes.  \"Mother!  Father!\" he cried; and in a moment was clasped in his mother’s arms, while tears of joy she didn’t strive to hide rolled down her cheeks.  The old gentleman turned his head aside to hide his own emotion, and Reggy, feeling _de trop_, slipped quietly away.  A few days later our ship was dragged slowly into dock by two small but powerful tug-boats.  The boys who had"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46300"],["title","The First Canadians in France (#2)"],["body","caged on board for a full week in sight of but unable to reach the land shouted and danced for joy.  The noise of the donkey engine pulling our equipment out of the hold was to us the sweetest sound on land or sea.  We were almost the last ship to dock, and a thousand boys were impatiently awaiting their turn to step on English soil.  Machine guns, boxes of rifles and ammunition, great cases of food and wagons came hurtling through the hatchway, vomited from the depths below.  With great speed and regularity they were deposited on the quay, while heavy motor lorries, piled high with freight, creaked from dock to train.  From across the quay, and in awesome proximity, the great guns of the battle cruisers _Tiger_ and _Benbow_ yawned at us.  As far as one might look heavily armoured men-of-war, ready to sail or in process of construction, met the eye, and the deafening crash of the trip-hammer stormed the ear. Britain may well be proud of her navy.  Its size and might are far beyond our ken. Patiently, in peaceful harbour, or on sea, she lies in wait and longs for Germany’s inevitable hour.  The hospitality of the citizens of Devonport and Plymouth will long remain a pleasant recollection.  First impressions linger and our first impressions there still stir up delightful memories.  \"Now, then, look sharp there!  Stow them adoos an’ get aboard!\"  It was the raucous voice of Sergeant Honk which thus assailed his unwilling flock.  The boys were bidding a lengthy farewell to the local beauties, who had patriotically followed them to the train.  The sergeant was hot and dusty, and beaded drops of sweat dripped from his unwashed chin.  His hat was cocked over one eye, in very unmilitary style.  The Tommies, under the stimulating influence of two or more draughts of \"bitter\" purchased at a nearby bar, were inclined to be jocose.  \"’Ave _another_ drink, ’Onk!\" cried one, thrusting a grimy head from the train window and mimicking Honk’s cockney accent. This subtle allusion to previous libations aroused the sergeant’s ire.  \"Oo said that?\" he shouted wrathfully, as he turned quickly about. \"Blimey if yer ain’t got no more disc’pline than a ’erd uv Alberta steers!  If I ’ears any more sauce like that some one ’ull be up for ’office’ in th’ mornin’!\"  The culprit had withdrawn his head in time, and peace prevailed for moment.  \"What’s that baggage fatigue doin’?\" he cried a moment later.  \"D’ye think y’er at a picnic—eatin’ oranges?  Load them tents!\"  The orange-eating \"fatigue,\" looking very hot and fatigued indeed, fell reluctantly to work.  Sergeant Honk was not beautiful to look upon—his best friends conceded this.  His nose was bent and red.  He had one fixed and one revolving eye, and when the former had transfixed you, the latter wandered aimlessly about, seeking I know not what.  He was so knock-kneed that his feet could never meet.  I think it was the sergeant-major in Punch who complained that \"it was impossible to make him look ’smart,’ for when his knees stood at attention his feet would stand at ease.\"  To see Honk salute with one stiff hand pointing heavenward and his unruly feet ten inches apart has been known to bring a wan sweet smile to the face of blasé generals; but subalterns, more prone to mirth, have sometimes laughed outright.  Some one had thrown a banana peel upon the station platform.  Honk stepped backward upon its slippery face.  He didn’t fall, but his queer legs opened and shut with a scissor-like snap that wrenched his dignity in twain.  \"Fruit’s the curse of the army,\" he muttered.  Somehow we got aboard at last—officers, non-commissioned officers and men.  The crowd cheered a lusty farewell, and amidst much waving of pocket handkerchiefs and hats, Plymouth faded away, and the second stage of our journey began.  It was midnight when we pulled into Lavington station.  There is no village there—merely a tavern of doubtful mien.  Rain was falling in a steady drizzle as we emerged upon the platform and stood shivering in the bleak east wind.  The transport officer, who had been awaiting our arrival, approached the colonel and saluted.  \"Rather a nasty night, sir,\" he observed courteously.  \"Bad night for a march,\" the colonel replied.  \"My men are tired, too. Hope we haven’t got far to go?\"  \"Not very, sir; a matter of eight or nine miles only.\"  The colonel glanced at him sharply, thinking the information was given in satirical vein; but the Englishman’s face was inscrutable.  \"Nine miles!\" he exclaimed.  \"That may be an easy march for seasoned troops, but my men have been three weeks on shipboard.\"  \"Sorry, sir, but that’s the shortest route.\"  \"Thanks; we’ll camp right here.\"  The colonel was emphatic.  \"In the rain?\" the Englishman inquired in some surprise.  \"Yes.  What of it?\"  \"Nothing, sir; but it seems unusual, that’s all.\"  \"We’re unusual people,\" the colonel answered dryly.  \"Quartermaster, get out the rubber sheets and blankets.  The station platform will be our bed.\"  The transport officer saluted and retired.  The adjutant was weary and sleepy.  He had vainly tried a stimulating Scotch or two to rouse his lagging spirit.  \"Fall in, men,\" he shouted.  \"’Shun!  Right dress.  Quartermaster, issue the blankets, please.\"  The quartermaster was disposed to argue the point.  The blankets would all be wet and muddy, and damaged with coal cinders; but he was finally overruled.  The adjutant turned to look at the men. Their line had wabbled and showed strange gyrations.  \"_Will_ you men stand in line?\" he cried. \"How do any of you ever expect to succeed in life if you can’t learn to stand in a straight line?\" With which unanswerable argument and much pleased with his midnight philosophy, he relapsed into his customary genial smile.  At last the blankets were distributed, and in an hour the station platform and bridge over the tracks looked like the deck of an emigrant steamer.  Wherever the eye reached, the dimly-lighted platform showed rows of sleeping men, rolled up and looking very like sacks of potatoes lying together.  Five of us officers turned into the expressman’s hut, and in the dark fell into whatever corner was available.  Reggy and I occupied either side of an unlighted stove, and throughout the jumpy watches of the night bruised our shins against its inhospitable legs.  Dawn was breaking, and breaking darkly, too, as the dim shadow of the expressman came stumbling across the platform through rows of growling men.  At last he reached his office, and, all unconscious of our presence, stepped within.  He stepped upon the sleeping form of the adjutant, and the form emitted a mighty roar.  The expressman staggered back in amazement, giving vent to this weird epigram:  \"Every bloomin’ ’ole a sleepin’ ’ole!\"  \"You’ll ’ave to get up,\" he cried indignantly when he had recovered from his astonishment.  \"This ain’t a bloomin’ boardin’-’ouse!\"  \"Could you return in half an hour?\" Reggy queried in drowsy tones, but without opening his eyes.  \"No.  I couldn’t return in ’alf an hour,\" he mocked peevishly.  \"Run away like a good fellow, and bring some shaving water—-have it hot!\" Reggy commanded.  \"Oh, I’ll make it ’ot for you all right, if you don’t let me into my office,\" he retorted angrily.  Might is not always right, so we reluctantly rose.  We had had three hours of fitful sleep—not too much for our first night’s soldiering. Hot coffee, cheese and biscuits were soon served by our cooks, and we prepared for our first march on English sod.  No one who made that march from Lavington to West Down North will ever forget it.  Napoleon’s march to Moscow was mere child’s play compared with it.  Reggy said both his corns were shrieking for Blue Jays and when Bill Barker removed his socks (skin and all) it marked an epoch in his life, for both his feet were clean.  Every fifteen minutes it rained.  At first we thought this mere playfulness on the part of the weather; but when it kept right on for weeks on end, we knew it to be distemper.  By day it was a steady drizzle, but at night the weather did its proudest feats. Sometimes it was a cloudburst; anon an ordinary shower that splashed in angry little squirts through the canvas, and fell upon our beds.  And the mud!  We stood in mud.  We walked in mud.  We slept in mud.  The sky looked muddy, too.  Once, and only once, the moon peeped out—it had splashes of mud on its face!  Reggy loved sleep.  It was his one passion.  Not the sweet beauty sleep of youth, but the deep snoring slumber of the full-blown man.  But, oh, those cruel \"Orderly Officer\" days, when one must rise at dawn! Reggy thought so, too.  Six a.m.  The bugle blew \"Parade.\"  Reggy arose.  I opened one eye in time to see a bedraggled figure in blue pyjamas stagger across the sloppy floor.  His eyes were heavy with sleep, and his wetted forelock fell in a Napoleonic curve.  The murky dawn was breaking.  Outside the tent we could hear the sergeant-major’s rubber boots flop, flop, across the muddy road.  \"Fall in, men!  Fall in!\"  His tones, diluted with the rain, came filtering through the tent.  It was inspection hour.  Reggy fumbled at the flap of the tent, untied the cord, and through the hole thus made thrust his sleep-laden head.  \"Parade, ’shun!\" shouted the sergeant-major (a sly bit of satire on his part).  The warning wasn’t needed.  The sight of Reggy’s dishevelled countenance was enough; Bill Barker himself \"shunned.\"  Somewhere from the depths of Reggy’s head a sleepy muffled voice emitted this succinct command:  \"Serg’nt-major; dish-mish th’ parade.\"  \"Right turn!  Dis-miss!\"  With a shout of joy the boys scampered off to their tents.  A moment later Reggy tumbled into bed again, and soon was fast asleep. And within two hours, at breakfast, he was saying, with virtuous resignation: \"How I envied you lucky devils sleeping-in this morning!  I was up at six o’clock inspecting the parade.\"  And the halo of near-truth hovered gently about his head.  Thus passed three weeks"]]]
