PRONOUNCING VOCABULARY  To aid the reader in pronouncing accurately Book of Mormon names and also the difficult Spanish and Mexican proper names found in the body of this work, where it treats of American antiquities, we append, first, the rules of pronounciation of the Book of Mormon names formulated at the Book of Mormon Convention held at the Brigham Young University, Provo, May, 1903; and, second, a list of the Spanish and Mexican words--chiefly proper names--and their pronounciation in English. For the pronunciation of the Spanish and Mexican names I am indebted to Professor John M. Mills of the Latter-day Saints' University, Salt Lake City, Utah.  RULES FOR THE PRONUNCIATION OF BOOK OF MORMON NAMES  \"Words of two syllables to be accented on the first syllable.  \"Words of three syllables to be accented on the second syllable with these exceptions, which are to be accented on the first syllable; namely: Amlici (c, soft); Amnion; Antipas; Antipus; Corihor; Cumeni; Curelom; Deseret; Gazelam; Helaman; Joneam; Korihor; Tubaloth.  \"Words of four syllables to be accented on the third syllable with the following exceptions, which are to be accented on the second syllable; namely: Abinadi; Abinidora; Amalickiah; Aminadi; Aminadab.  \"Ch is always to be pronounced as K.  \"G at the beginning of a name to be always pronounced 'hard.'  \"I final, always to take the long sound of the vowel.

I.  NEW WITNESSES FOR THE TRUTH OF GOD'S WORD ASSURED.  It is a happy omen, that, while so much of the literature of our times is marked by a tone of infidelity, and especially by a disparagement of the evidences of the authenticity and inspiration of the Scriptures, there is in other quarters an increasing readiness to make the choicest gifts of modern science and learning tributary to the word of God. The eclipse of faith is not total. And it is an additional cause for gratitude to the God of Providence and of Revelation, that, even at this remote distance of time from the date of the Sacred Oracles, new evidences of their credibility and accuracy are continually coming to light. How much may yet remain, buried under barren mounds, or entombed in pyramids and catacombs, or hidden in the yet unexplored pages of some ancient literature, it were vain to conjecture; but of this we may be sure, that if any new forms of evidence should hereafter be needed, to meet any new forms of unbelief, and authenticate afresh the word of truth, they will be found deposited somewhere, waiting for the fulness of time; and God will bring them forth in their season, from the dark hieroglyphics, or the desert sands, or the dusty manuscripts, to confound the adversaries of his word, and to \"magnify it above all his name.\"--\"Historical Evidences of the Truth of the Scripture Records,\" by George Rawlinson, M. A. American Edition, 1885.  II.  THE WORLD'S HUNGER FOR KNOWLEDGE OF THE CHRIST.  \"Were a parchment discovered in an Egyptian mound, six inches square, containing fifty words which were certainly spoken by Jesus, this utterance would count more than all the books which have been published since the first century. If a veritable picture of the Lord could be unearthed from a catacomb, and the world could see with its own eyes what like he was, it would not matter that its colors were faded, and that it was roughly drawn, that picture would have at once a solitary place amid the treasures of art.\"--Rev. John Watson, D. D. (Ian Maclaren) \"Life of the Master,\" Prologue.  III.  THE BOOK OF MORMON A WITNESS FOR THE CHRIST.  \"And I, Nephi, beheld that the Gentiles that had gone out of captivity, were delivered by the power of God out of the hands of all other nations. And it came to pass that I, Nephi, beheld that they did prosper in the land; and I beheld a Book, and it was carried forth among them. And the angel said unto me, Knowest thou the meaning of the Book? And I said unto him, I know not. And he said. Behold it proceedeth out of the mouth of a Jew; * * * * and he said unto me, The Book that thou beholdest is a record of the Jews, which contains the covenants of the Lord which he hath made with the House of Israel; and it also containeth many of the prophecies of the holy Prophets. * * * * And it came to pass that I beheld the remnant of the seed of my brethren, and also the Book of the Lamb of God, which had proceeded forth from the mouth of the Jew, that it came forth from the Gentiles, unto the remnant of the seed of my brethren. And after it had come forth unto them, I beheld other Books, which came forth by the power of the Lamb, from the Gentiles, unto them, unto the convincing of the Gentiles, and the remnant of the seed of my brethren, and also the Jews, who were scattered upon all the face of the earth, that the records of the Prophets and of the Twelve Apostles of the Lamb [the Bible] are true. And the angel spake unto me, saying. These last records which thou hast seen among the Gentiles, shall establish the truth of the first, which are of the Twelve Apostles of the Lamb, and shall make known the plain and precious things which have been taken away from them; and shall make known unto all kindreds, tongues and people, that the Lamb of God is the Son of the Eternal Father, and the Savior of the world; and that all men must come unto him, or they cannot be saved.\"--I. Nephi xiii.    PART I.  The Value of the Book of Mormon as a witness for the authenticity and integrity of the Bible, and the truth of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.    NEW WITNESSES FOR GOD.  II.  THE BOOK OF MORMON.    CHAPTER I.  THE BIBLE IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY  \"The Bible in the Nineteenth Century\" will yet form an interesting subject for a volume. The writer of it will recount the attacks made upon the sacred volume by unbelievers, and the defense of it by faithful Christian and Jewish scholars. He will also be under the necessity of writing the history of the betrayals of the Holy Scriptures by pretended friends; and he will say such betrayals were more mischievous than the attacks of avowed enemies. He will balance the harm done by the attacks and the betrayals, against the good accomplished by the defenses, and give the net result of gain or loss. Which will preponderate? The nineteenth century was prolific in both assaults and defenses; and much valuable material was collected from unexpected quarters for the defense of the Scriptures; but for all that it is doubtful if in what is recognized as the Christian world the faith of the Christians in the Bible, as the veritable word of God, was as sound and absolute at the close of the nineteenth century as it was at the commencement of it. This is not saying that what is regarded as old fashioned faith in the Bible has been entirely banished, or totally eclipsed. There are those, and many of them, thank God, who still revere the Bible as the word of God, and therefore hold it true, and take it as a lamp to their feet, as a guide to their path. But there has arisen within Christendom itself--and chiefly within the nineteenth century--a class of Bible scholars who have done much mischief to faith in the Bible; who make it part of their boast that in their study of the Bible they have dropped the theological attitude towards it, viz., the preconception that the Bible is the word of God, on which conception men were wont to reason: God is a God of absolute truth; the Bible is the word of God; therefore the Bible is absolutely true. This position they now abandon and take up what they are pleased to call the \"literary attitude or method.\" That is, they approach the Bible without any preconception whatsoever. They take up the collection of books forming the Bible as they would take up any other body of literature; as they would English, French, or German literature. \"This method,\" says one high in authority in the new school of critics, \"assumes nothing. It leaves the conclusion of the questions whether the Bible came from God, in what sense it came from God, how far and to what extent it came from God, all to be determined by examination of the book itself. This I call the literary method.\" [1] \"This method,\" says another, \"leads to the investigation of the origin, authorship, and meaning of the several books of the Bible, and the credibility of the history which it contains.\" [2] Concerning in what those of the Literary school are agreed, and in what their method results, as to the Old Testament, I quote the following:      They are generally agreed in thinking that the book of Genesis is     composed of three or four or more documents woven together by some     ancient editor in one continuous narrative. They are generally     agreed in thinking that the book of the Covenant, [3] with the Ten     Commandments at its forefront, is the oldest book in the Bible;     that the history in which that book of the Covenant is embedded was     written long subsequent to the time of Moses. They are generally     agreed in thinking that the Book of Deuteronomy, embodying a later     prophet's conception of Mosaic principles, was not written or     uttered by Moses himself in its present form, but some centuries     after the death of Moses. They are generally agreed in thinking     that the book of Leviticus was written long subsequent to the time     of Moses, and so far from embodying the principles of the Mosaic     code embodies much that is in spirit adverse if not antagonistic     to the simple principles of Mosaism. They are generally agreed     in considering that we have in the books of Kings and Chronicles     history and belles lettres so woven together that it is not always     possible to tell what is to be regarded as belles lettres and what     is to be regarded as history. They are generally agreed in the     opinion that Job, while it treats of history about the days of     Moses, or even anterior thereto, was written later than the time     of Solomon; that very little of the Hebrew Psalter was composed by     David; that most of it was composed in the time of the exile or     subsequent thereto; that Solomon's song was not written by Solomon,     and is the drama of a pure woman's love, not a spiritual allegory;     that the book of Isaiah was written certainly by two authors and     perhaps more, the later book being written one hundred years at     least after the earlier and by a prophet now unknown; that the     book of Jonah belongs to the series of moral instruction through     fiction, and that the book of Daniel conveys moral instruction by     means of, to use Dean Farrar's phraseology, one of"]]]
