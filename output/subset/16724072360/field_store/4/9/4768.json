Morano was also looking at the ring; he had followed the young man's glance.  \"Master,\" he said, \"do you draw your sword of a night?\"  \"And you?\" said Rodriguez.  \"I have no sword,\" said Morano. \"I am but as dog's meat that needs no guarding, but you whose meat is rare like the flesh of the unicorn need a sword to guard your meat. The unicorn has his horn always, and even then he sometimes sleeps.\"  \"It is bad, you think, to sleep,\" Rodriguez said.  \"For some it is very bad, master. They say they never take the unicorn waking. For me I am but dog's meat: when I have eaten hams I curl up and sleep; but then you see, master, I know I shall wake in the morning.\"  \"Ah,\" said Rodriguez, \"the morning's a pleasant time,\" and he leaned back comfortably in his chair. Morano took one shrewd look at him, and was soon asleep upon his three-legged stool.  The door opened after a while and mine host appeared. \"It is late,\" he said. Rodriguez smiled acquiescently and mine host withdrew, and presently leaving Morano whom his master's voice had waked, to curl up on the floor in a corner, Rodriguez took the candle that lit the room and passed once more through the passages of the inn and down the great corridor of the fastness of the family that had fallen on evil days, and so came to his chamber. I will not waste a multitude of words over that chamber; if you have no picture of it in your mind already, my reader, you are reading an unskilled writer, and if in that picture it appear a wholesome room, tidy and well kept up, if it appear a place in which a stranger might sleep without some faint foreboding of disaster, then I am wasting your time, and will waste no more of it with bits of \"descriptive writing\" about that dim, high room, whose blackness towered before Rodriguez in the night. He entered and shut the door, as many had done before him; but for all his youth he took some wiser precautions than had they, perhaps, who closed that door before. For first he drew his sword; then for some while he stood quite still near the door and listened to the rats; then he looked round the chamber and perceived only one door; then he looked at the heavy oak furniture, carved by some artist, gnawed by rats, and all blackened by time; then swiftly opened the door of the largest cupboard and thrust his sword in to see who might be inside, but the carved satyr's heads at the top of the cupboard eyed him silently and nothing moved. Then he noted that though there was no bolt on the door the furniture might be placed across to make what in the wars is called a barricado, but the wiser thought came at once that this was too easily done, and that if the danger that the dim room seemed gloomily to forebode were to come from a door so readily barricadoed, then those must have been simple gallants who parted so easily with the rings that adorned Morano's two little fingers. No, it was something more subtle than any attack through that door that brought his regular wages to Morano. Rodriguez looked at the window, which let in the light of a moon that was getting low, for the curtains had years ago been eaten up by the moths; but the window was barred with iron bars that were not yet rusted away, and looked out, thus guarded, over a sheer wall that even in the moonlight fell into blackness. Rodriguez then looked round for some hidden door, the sword all the while in his hand, and very soon he knew that room fairly well, but not its secret, nor why those unknown gallants had given up their rings.  It is much to know of an unknown danger that it really is unknown. Many have met their deaths through looking for danger from one particular direction, whereas had they perceived that they were ignorant of its direction they would have been wise in their ignorance. Rodriguez had the great discretion to understand clearly that he did not know the direction from which danger would come. He accepted this as his only discovery about that portentous room which seemed to beckon to him with every shadow and to sigh over him with every mournful draught, and to whisper to him unintelligible warnings with every rustle of tattered silk that hung about his bed. And as soon as he discovered that this was his only knowledge he began at once to make his preparations: he was a right young man for the wars. He divested himself of his shoes and doublet and the light cloak that hung from his shoulder and cast the clothes on a chair. Over the back of the chair he slung his girdle and the scabbard hanging therefrom and placed his plumed hat so that none could see that his Castilian blade was not in its resting-place. And when the sombre chamber had the appearance of one having undressed in it before retiring Rodriguez turned his attention to the bed, which he noticed to be of great depth and softness. That something not unlike blood had been spilt on the floor excited no wonder in Rodriguez; that vast chamber was evidently, as I have said, in the fortress of some great family, against one of whose walls the humble inn had once leaned for protection; the great family were gone: how they were gone Rodriguez did not know, but it excited no wonder in him to see blood on the boards: besides, two gallants may have disagreed; or one who loved not dumb animals might have been killing rats. Blood did not disturb him; but what amazed him, and would have surprised anyone who stood in that ruinous room, was that there were clean new sheets on the bed. Had you seen the state of the furniture and the floor, O my reader, and the vastness of the old cobwebs and the black dust that they held, the dead spiders and huge dead flies, and the living generation of spiders descending and ascending through the gloom, I say that you also would have been surprised at the sight of those nice clean sheets. Rodriguez noted the fact and continued his preparations. He took the bolster from underneath the pillow and laid it down the middle of the bed and put the sheets back over it; then he stood back and looked at it, much as a sculptor might stand back from his marble, then he returned to it and bent it a little in the middle, and after that he placed his mandolin on the pillow and nearly covered it with the sheet, but not quite, for a little of the curved dark-brown wood remained still to be seen. It looked wonderfully now like a sleeper in the bed, but Rodriguez was not satisfied with his work until he had placed his kerchief and one of his shoes where a shoulder ought to be; then he stood back once more and eyed it with satisfaction. Next he considered the light. He looked at the light of the moon and remembered his father's advice, as the young often do, but considered that this was not the occasion for it, and decided to leave the light of his candle instead, so that anyone who might be familiar with the moonlight in that shadowy chamber should find instead a less sinister light. He therefore dragged a table to the bedside, placed the candle upon it, and opened a treasured book that he bore in his doublet, and laid it on the bed near by, between the candle and his mandolin-headed sleeper; the name of the book was Notes in a Cathedral and dealt with the confessions of a young girl, which the author claimed to have jotted down, while concealed behind a pillow near the Confessional, every Sunday for the entire period of Lent. Lastly he pulled a sheet a little loose from the bed, until a corner of it lay on the floor; then he lay down on the boards, still keeping his sword in his hand, and by means of the sheet and some silk that hung from the bed, he concealed himself sufficient for his purpose, which was to see before he should be seen by any intruder that might enter that chamber.  And if Rodriguez appear to have been unduly suspicious, it should be borne in mind not only that those empty rings needed much explanation, but that every house suggests to the stranger something; and that whereas one house seems to promise a welcome in front of cosy fires, another good fare, another joyous wine, this inn seemed to promise murder; or so the young man's intuition said, and the young are wise to trust to their intuitions.  The reader will know, if he be one of us, who have been to the wars and slept in curious ways, that it is hard to sleep when sober upon a floor; it is not like the earth, or snow, or a feather bed; even rock can be more accommodating; it is hard, unyielding and level, all night unmistakable floor. Yet Rodriguez took no risk of falling asleep, so he said over to himself in his mind as much as he remembered of his treasured book, Notes in a Cathedral, which he always read to himself before going to rest and now so sadly missed. It told how a lady who had listened to a lover longer than her soul's safety could warrant, as he played languorous music in the moonlight and sang soft by her low balcony, and how she being truly penitent, had gathered many roses, the emblems of love (as surely, she said at confession, all the world knows), and when her lover came again by"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42901"],["title","Creatures of the Abyss (#1)"],["body","'t see her, and sneaked out from their midst. She came back loaded down with fish. There were more fights and more men in the hospital and in jail. Some of _La Rubia's_ men boasted that they'd used radar to dodge their rivals. And that's how the police got interested in me.\"  The girl had listened interestedly.  \"Why?\"  \"Oh, Jimenez began to take orders for radar from other fishing boat owners. If _La Rubia_ could dodge them by radar, they could trail her by radar even in the dark. So the skipper and crew of _La Rubia_ promised blood-curdling things as Jimenez's fate if he delivered a radar set to anybody else. Then the skippers and crews of other boats made even more blood-curdling threats if he didn't deliver radar to them. So Jimenez ran away, leaving me to hold the bag.\"  The girl nodded.  \"And therefore,\" said Terry, \"I'm shutting up shop. I'll turn the inventory over to the police and go off somewhere until someone learns where _La Rubia_ gets her fish. When things calm down again, I'll come back and start up business once more--without Jimenez. I'll probably stick to electric-eye doors, burglar alarms, closed-circuit television systems and things like that. Then I might make this underwater broadcasting device, if your father still wants it. I'd better not now.\"  \"We heard about your problem,\" said the girl. \"Almost exactly the way you just explained it.\"  Terry stared. Then he said politely, \"Oh. You did?\"  \"Yes, I thought--\"  \"Then you knew,\" said Terry more politely still, \"that I was leaving town and couldn't make the gadget you want? You knew it before you came here?\"  \"Why,\" said the girl, \"your plans seemed to fit in very nicely with ours. We've got a sixty-five-foot schooner and we're sailing around. My father wants something like--what you described. So since you want to--well--travel around for a time, why not come on board our boat and make the thing we want there? We'll land you anywhere you like when it's finished.\"  \"Thanks,\" said Terry with very great politeness indeed. \"I think I made a fool of myself, explaining. You knew it all beforehand. I'm afraid I bored you horribly. You probably even know that Jimenez took all the funds when he ran away.\"  She hesitated, and then said, \"Y-yes. We thought--\"  \"That I should have trouble raising steamer-fare to any place at all,\" he said without cordiality. \"And I will. You had that information too, didn't you?\"  \"Please!\" she said with distress. \"You make it sound--\"  \"Did you have any idea what I'd charge to assemble the device you want?\"  \"If you'll name a price.\"  Terry named one. He was angry. The sum was far from a small one. It was, in fact, exorbitant. But he felt that he'd made a fool of himself, responding to her encouragement by telling her things she already knew.  She opened her purse and peeled off bills. She put them down.  \"I'll leave the paddle with you,\" she said crisply. \"Our boat is the _Esperance_. You'll find it....\" She named the anchorage, which was that of Manila's most expensive yacht club. \"There's a launch which will bring you out whenever you're ready to sail. It would be nice if you could sail tomorrow--and nicer if you could come aboard today.\"  She nodded in friendly fashion, opened the door--the bell jangled--and went out.  Terry blinked. Then he swore and snatched up the pile of bills. Two fluttered to the floor and he lost time picking them up. He went out after her, the money in his hand.  He saw a taxicab door close behind her, three or four doors down the street. Instantly the cab was in mad career away. The taxicabs of Manila are driven by a special breed of chauffeurs. It is said that they are all escaped lunatics with homicidal tendencies. The cab went roaring down the Calle Enero's cluttered length and turned the corner.  Terry went back to the shop. He swore again. He looked at the money in his hand. It totalled exactly the excessive amount he'd named as the price of an electronic fish-driving unit, including an underwater horn.  \"The devil!\" he said angrily.  He felt the special indignation some men feel when they are in difficulties which their pride requires them to surmount by themselves, and somebody tries to help. The indignation is the greater as they see less chance of success on their own.  Terry's situation was offensive to him because he shouldn't be in this kind of situation at all, or rather, his troubles were not foreseeable by the most competent of graduate electronic engineers. He'd trained for the work he'd undertaken. He'd prepared himself for competence. At graduation he'd encountered the representatives of at least three large corporations who were snapping up engineers as soon as they left the cloistered halls of learning. Terry'd asked how many men were employed in the category he'd fit in. When one representative boasted that ten thousand such engineers were on his company's payroll, Terry declined at once. He wanted to accomplish something himself, not as part of a team of some thousands of members. The smaller the organization, the better one's chance for personal satisfaction. He wouldn't make as much money, but--  It was a matter of simple logic. If he was better off with a really small company, he'd be best off on his own. And he'd nearly managed it. He'd worked only with Jimenez. Jimenez was the sales organization. Terry was the production staff. In Manila there was certainly room for special electronic equipment--_especialidades electr撑icas y f𥧄icas_. He should have had an excellent chance to build up a good business. Starting small, even without capital, he'd confidently expected to be going strong within months. There were taxi fleets to be equipped with short-wave radio. There were burglar alarms to be designed and installed, and all sorts of setups to be engineered. And these things were still in demand. His expectations had a solid foundation. Nobody could have anticipated the disaster caused by _La Rubia's_ phenomenal success in commercial fishery. It was even irrational for it to be a disaster to Terry. But it was.  More immediately, though, he was indignant because this girl had known all about him when she came into the shop. She'd probably even known about his gimmicking a standard-design submarine listening device so it was really good and really directional. But she'd let him talk, asking seemingly interested questions, when she knew the whole business beforehand. And at the end she'd done a most infuriating thing by paying him in advance for something he'd refused to do, thereby forcing him into the obligation to do it.  He fretted. He needed the money. But he objected to being tricked. He went back to the probably senseless business of taking an inventory. Time passed. Nothing happened. Nobody came to the shop. The police had been firm about _La Rubia_ crewmen calling on Terry to make threats. They'd been equally firm about other people calling to make counterthreats. No casual customers entered. Two hours went by.  At four o'clock the door opened--with the sound of its tinkling bell--and Police Captain Felicio Horta came in.  \"_Buenas tardes_,\" he said cordially.  Terry grunted at him.  \"I hear,\" said Horta, \"that you leave Manila.\"  Terry asked evenly, \"Is that a way of asking me to hurry up and do it?\"  \"_Pero no! Por supuesto no!_\" protested Horta. \"But it is said that you have new and definite plans.\"  \"What do you know about them?\" demanded Terry.  Police Captain Horta said pleasantly, \"Officially, nothing. Privately, that you will aid some _ricos americanos_ to do experiments in--_oceanograf禘_? Some study of oceanic things. That you regret having agreed to do so. That you consider changing your mind. That you are angry.\"  The girl, of course, could have inferred all this from his angry charge out of the shop with the money in his hand, too late to stop her taxicab. But Terry snapped, \"Now, who the devil told you that?\"  Police Captain Horta shrugged.  \"One hears. I hope it is not true.\"  \"That what's not true? That I leave? Or that I don't?\"  \"I hope,\" said Horta benignly, \"that you do as you please. I am not on duty at the moment. I have my car. I offer myself to chauffeur you if there is any place you wish to go--to a steamer or anywhere else. If you do not wish to go anywhere, I will take my leave. With no pre ... prejudice,\" he finished. \"We have been friendly. I hope we remain so.\"  Terry stared at him estimatingly. Police Captain Horta was a reasonable and honest man. He knew that Terry had contributed to matters giving the police some trouble, but he knew it was accidental on Terry's part. He would hold no grudge.  \"Just why,\" asked Terry measuredly, \"did you come here to offer to drive me somewhere? Is there any special reason to want me to get out of town?\"  \"That is not it,\" said Horta. \"It could be wished that you would--take a certain course of action. Yes. But not because you would be absent from here. It is because you would be present at a special other place. The matter connects with _La Rubia_, but in a manner you could not possibly guess. Yet you are wholly a free agent. You will do as you please. I would like to make it--convenient. That is all.\"  He paused. Terry stared at him, frowning. Horta tried again.  \"Let us say that I have much interest in _oceanograf禘_. I would like to see certain research carried on.\"  \"Being, I'm sure, especially interested in fish-driving,\" said Terry skeptically. \"You sound as if you were acting unofficially to get something done that officially you can't talk about.\"  Horta smiled warmly at him.  \"That,\" he pronounced, \"is a logical conclusion.\"  \"What's the object of the--research, if that's what it is? And why pick me?\"  Horta shrugged and did not answer.  \"Why not tell me?\"  \"_Amigo_,\" said Horta, \"I would like nothing better than to tell you. I would be interested to see your reception of the idea. But it would be fatal. You would think me cr-azy. And also more important persons. But especially me.\"  "]]]
