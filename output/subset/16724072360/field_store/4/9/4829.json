Count Broncini was his next victim.  There, for a time, the slaughtering business of the captain stopped.  His brother officers of the better kind would not have excused him at another season, but the avenger of their irritation and fine vindicator of the merits of Austrian steel, had a welcome truly warm, when at the termination of his second duel he strode into mess, or what serves for an Austrian regimental mess.  It ensued naturally that there was everywhere in Verona a sharp division between the Italians of all classes and their conquerors.  The great green-rinded melons were never wheeled into the neighbourhood of the whitecoats.  Damsels were no longer coquettish under the military glance, but hurried by in couples; and there was much scowling mixed with derisive servility, throughout the city, hard to be endured without that hostile state of the spirit which is the military mind's refuge in such cases.  Itinerant musicians, and none but this fry, continued to be attentive to the dispensers of soldi.  The Austrian army prides itself upon being a brotherhood.  Discipline is very strict, but all commissioned officers, when off duty, are as free in their intercourse as big boys.  The General accepts a cigar from the lieutenant, and in return lifts his glass to him.  The General takes an interest in his lieutenant's love-affairs: nor is the latter shy when he feels it his duty modestly to compliment his superior officer upon a recent conquest.  There is really good fellowship both among the officers and in the ranks, and it is systematically encouraged.  The army of Austria was in those days the Austrian Empire.  Outside the army the empire was a jealous congery of intriguing disaffected nationalities.  The same policy which played the various States against one another in order to reduce all to subserviency to the central Head, erected a privileged force wherein the sentiment of union was fostered till it became a nationality of the sword.  Nothing more fatal can be done for a country; but for an army it is a simple measure of wisdom. Where the password is MARCH, and not DEVELOP, a body of men, to be a serviceable instrument, must consent to act as one.  Hannibal is the historic example of what a General can accomplish with tribes who are thus, enrolled in a new citizenship; and (as far as we know of him and his fortunes) he appears to be an example of the necessity of the fusing fire of action to congregated aliens in arms.  When Austria was fighting year after year, and being worsted in campaign after campaign, she lost foot by foot, but she held together soundly; and more than the baptism, the atmosphere of strife has always been required to give her a healthy vitality as a centralized empire.  She knew it; this (apart from the famous promptitude of the Hapsburgs) was one secret of her dauntless readiness to fight.  War did the work of a smithy for the iron and steel holding her together; and but that war costs money, she would have been an empire distinguished by aggressiveness.  The next best medicinal thing to war is the military occupation of insurgent provinces.  The soldiery soon feel where their home is, and feel the pride of atomies in unitive power, when they are sneered at, hooted, pelted, stabbed upon a gross misinterpretation of the slightest of moral offences, shamefully abused for doing their duty with a considerate sense of it, and too accurately divided from the inhabitants of the land they hold.  In Italy, the German, the Czech, the Magyar, the Croft, even in general instances the Italian, clung to the standard for safety, for pay, for glory, and all became pre-eminently Austrian soldiers; little besides.  It was against a power thus bound in iron hoops, that Italy, dismembered, and jealous, and corrupt, with an organization promoted by passion chiefly, was preparing to rise.  In the end, a country true to itself and determined to claim God's gift to brave men will overmatch a mere army, however solid its force.  But an inspired energy of faith is demanded of it.  The intervening chapters will show pitiable weakness, and such a schooling of disaster as makes men, looking on the surface of things, deem the struggle folly.  As well, they might say, let yonder scuffling vagabonds up any of the Veronese side-streets fall upon the patrol marching like one man, and hope to overcome them!  In Vienna there was often despair: but it never existed in the Austrian camp.  Vienna was frequently double-dealing and time-serving her force in arms was like a trained man feeling his muscle.  Thus, when the Government thought of temporizing, they issued orders to Generals whose one idea was to strike the blow of a mallet.  At this period there was no suspicion of any grand revolt being in process of development.  The abounding dissatisfaction was treated as nothing more than the Italian disease showing symptoms here and there, and Vienna counselled measures mildly repressive,--'conciliating,' it was her pleasure to call them.  Her recent commands with respect to turbulent Venice were the subject of criticism among the circle outside the Piazza Gaffe.  An enforced inactivity of the military legs will quicken the military wits, it would appear, for some of the younger officers spoke hotly as to their notion of the method of ruling Venezia.  One had bidden his Herr General to 'look here,' while he stretched forth his hand and declared that Italians were like women, and wanted--yes, wanted--(their instinct called for it) a beating, a real beating; as the emphatic would say in our vernacular, a thundering thrashing, once a month:-'Or so,' the General added acquiescingly.  A thundering thrashing, once a month or so, to these unruly Italians, because they are like women!  It was a youth who spoke, but none doubted his acquaintance with women, or cared to suggest that his education in that department of knowledge was an insufficient guarantee for his fitness to govern Venezia.  Two young dragoon officers had approached during the fervid allocution, and after the salute to their superior, caught up chairs and stamped them down, thereupon calling for the loan of anybody's cigar-case.  Where it is that an Austrian officer ordinarily keeps this instrument so necessary to his comfort, and obnoxious, one would suppose, to the rigid correctness of his shapely costume, we cannot easily guess.  None can tell even where he stows away his pocket-handkerchief, or haply his purse.  However, these things appear on demand.  Several elongated cigar-cases were thrust forward, and then it was seen that the attire of the gallant youngsters was in disorder.  'Did you hunt her to earth?' they were asked.  The reply trenched on philosophy; and consisted in an inquiry as to who cared for the whole basketful--of the like description of damsels, being implied.  Immoderate and uproarious laughter burst around them.  Both seemed to have been clawed impartially.  Their tightfitting coats bulged at the breast or opened at the waist, as though buttons were lacking, and the whiteness of that garment cried aloud for the purification of pipeclay.  Questions flew.  The damsel who had been pursued was known as a pretty girl, the daughter of a blacksmith, and no prolonged resistance was expected from one of her class.  But, as it came out, she had said, a week past, 'I shall be stabbed if I am seen talking to you'; and therefore the odd matter was, not that she had, in tripping down the Piazza with her rogue-eyed cousin from Milan, looked away and declined all invitation to moderate her pace and to converse, but that, after doubling down and about lonely streets, the length of which she ran as swiftly as her feet would carry her, at a corner of the Via Colomba she allowed herself to be caught--wilfully, beyond a doubt, seeing that she was not a bit breathed--allowed one quick taste of her lips, and then shrieked as naturally as a netted bird, and brought a hustling crowd just at that particular point to her rescue: not less than fifty, and all men. 'Not a woman among them!' the excited young officer repeated.  A veteran in similar affairs could see that he had the wish to remain undisturbed in his bewilderment at the damsel's conduct.  Profound belief in her partiality for him perplexed his recent experience rather agreeably.  Indeed, it was at this epoch an article of faith with the Austrian military that nothing save terror of their males kept sweet Italian women from the expression of their preference for the broad- shouldered, thick-limbed, yellow-haired warriors--the contrast to themselves which is supposed greatly to inspirit genial Cupid in the selection from his quiver.  'What became of her?  Did you let her go?' came pestering remarks, too absurd for replies if they had not been so persistent.  'Let her go?  In the devil's name, how was I to keep my hold of her in a crowd of fifty of the fellows, all mowing, and hustling, and elbowing-- every rascal stinking right under my nose like the pit?'  ''Hem!' went the General present.  'As long as you did not draw! Unsheathe, a minute.'  He motioned for a sight of their naked swords.  The couple of young officers flushed.  'Herr General!  Pardon!' they remonstrated.  'No, no.  I know how boys talk; I've been one myself.  Tutt!  You tell the truth, of course; but the business is for me to know in what! how far!  Your swords, gentlemen.'  'But, General!'  'Well?  I merely wish to examine the blades.'  'Do you doubt our words?'  'Hark at them!  Words?  Are you lawyers?  A soldier deals in acts.  I don't want to know your words, but your deeds, my gallant lads.  I want to look at the blades of your swords, my children.  What was the last order?  That on no account were we to provoke, or, if possibly to be avoided, accept a collision, etc., etc.  The soldier in peace is a citizen, etc.  No sword on any"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4436"],["title","Vittoria â€” Volume 2 (#2)"],["body","unt, or for any excuse, to be drawn, etc.  You all heard it?  So, good!  I receive your denial, my children. In addition, I merely desire to satisfy curiosity.  Did the guard clear a way for you?'  The answer was affirmative.  'Your swords!'  One of them drew, and proffered the handle.  The other clasped the haft angrily, and with a resolute smack on it, settled it in the scabbard.  'Am I a prisoner, General?'  'Not at all!'  'Then I decline to surrender my sword.'  Another General officer happened to be sauntering by.  Applauding with his hands, and choosing the Italian language as the best form of speech for the enunciation of ironical superlatives, he said:  'Eccellentemente! most admirable! of a distinguished loftiness of moral grandeur: \"Then I decline,\" etc.: you are aware that you are quoting? \"as the drummerboy said to Napoleon.\"  I think you forgot to add that? It is the same young soldier who utters these immense things, which we can hardly get out of our mouths.  So the little fellow towers!  His moral greatness is as noisy as his drum.  What's wrong?'  'General Pierson, nothing's wrong,' was replied by several voices; and some explained that Lieutenant Jenna had been called upon by General Schoneck to show his sword, and had refused.  The heroic defender of his sword shouted to the officer with whom General Pierson had been conversing: 'Here!  Weisspriess!'  'What is it, my dear fellow?  Speak, my good Jenna!'  The explanation was given, and full sympathy elicited from Captain Weisspriess, while the two Generals likewise whispered and nodded.  'Did you draw?' the captain inquired, yawning.  'You needn't say it in quite so many words, if you did.  I shall be asked by the General presently; and owing to that duel pending 'twixt you and his nephew, of which he is aware, he may put a bad interpretation on your pepperiness.'  'The devil fetch his nephew!' returned the furious Lieutenant Jenna. 'He comes back to-night from Milan, and if he doesn't fight me to-morrow, I post him a coward.  Well, about that business!  My good Weisspriess, the fellows had got into a thick crowd all round, and had begun to knead me.  Do you understand me?  I felt their knuckles.'  'Ah, good, good!' said the captain.  'Then, you didn't draw, of course. What officer of the Imperial service would, under similar circumstances! That is my reply to the Emperor, if ever I am questioned.  To draw would be to show that an Austrian officer relies on his good sword in the thick of his enemies; against which, as you know, my Jenna, the Government have issued an express injunction button.  Did you sell it dear?'  'A fellow parted with his ear for it.'  Lieutenant Jenna illustrated a particular cut from a turn of his wrist.  'That oughtn't to make a noise?' he queried somewhat anxiously.  'It won't hear one any longer, at all events,' said Captain Weisspriess; and the two officers entered into the significance of the remark with enjoyment.  Meantime General Pierson had concluded an apparently humorous dialogue with his brother General, and the later, now addressing Lieutenant Jenna, said: 'Since you prefer surrendering your person rather than your sword-- it is good!  Report yourself at the door of my room to-night, at ten.  I suspect that you have been blazing your steel, sir.  They say, 'tis as ready to flash out as your temper.'  Several voices interposed: 'General!  what if he did draw!'  'Silence.  You have read the recent order.  Orlando may have his Durindarda bare; but you may not.  Grasp that fact.  The Government wish to make Christians of you, my children.  One cheek being smitten, what should you do?'  'Shall I show you, General?' cried a quick little subaltern.  'The order, my children, as received a fortnight since from our old Wien, commands you to offer the other cheek to the smiter.'  'So that a proper balance may be restored to both sides of the face,' General Pierson appended.  'And mark me,' he resumed.  'There may be doubts about the policy of anything, though I shouldn't counsel you to cherish them: but there's no mortal doubt about the punishment for this thing.' The General spoke sternly; and then relaxing the severity of his tone, he said, 'The desire of the Government is to make an army of Christians.'  'And a precious way of doing it!' interjected two or three of the younger officers.  They perfectly understood how hateful the Viennese domination was to their chiefs, and that they would meet sympathy and tolerance for any extreme of irony, provided that they showed a disposition to be subordinate.  For the bureaucratic order, whatever it was, had to be obeyed.  The army might, and of course did, know best: nevertheless it was bound to be nothing better than a machine in the hands of the dull closeted men in Vienna, who judged of difficulties and plans of action from a calculation of numbers, or from foreign journals--from heaven knows what!  General Schoneck and General Pierson walked away laughing, and the younger officers were left to themselves.  Half-a-dozen of them interlaced arms, striding up toward the Porta Nuova, near which, at the corner of the Via Trinita, they had the pleasant excitement of beholding a riderless horse suddenly in mid gallop sink on its knees and roll over. A crowd came pouring after it, and from the midst the voice of a comrade hailed them.  'It's Pierson,' cried Lieutenant Jenna.  The officers drew their swords, and hailed the guard from the gates.  Lieutenant Pierson dropped in among their shoulders, dead from want of breath.  They held him up, and finding him sound, thumped his back.  The blade of his sword was red.  He coughed with their thumpings, and sang out to them to cease; the idle mob which had been at his heels drew back before the guard could come up with them.  Lieutenant Pierson gave no explanation except that he had been attacked near Juliet's tomb on his way to General Schoneck's quarters.  Fellows had stabbed his horse, and brought him to the ground, and torn the coat off his back.  He complained in bitter mutterings of the loss of a letter therein, during the first candid moments of his anger: and, as he was known to be engaged to the Countess Lena von Lenkenstein, it was conjectured by his comrades that this lady might have had something to do with the ravishment of the letter.  Great laughter surrounded him, and he looked from man to man.  Allowance is naturally made for the irascibility of a brother officer coming tattered out of the hands of enemies, or Lieutenant Jenna would have construed his eye's challenge on the spot.  As it was, he cried out, 'The letter! the letter! Charge, for the honour of the army, and rescue the letter!' Others echoed him: 'The letter! the letter! the English letter!' A foreigner in an army can have as much provocation as he pleases; if he is anything of a favourite with his superiors, his fellows will task his forbearance. Wilfrid Pierson glanced at the blade of his sword, and slowly sheathed it.  'Lieutenant Jenna is a good actor before a mob,' he said. 'Gentlemen, I rely upon you to make no noise about that letter; it is a private matter.  In an hour or so, if any officer shall choose to question me concerning it, I will answer him.'  The last remnants of the mob had withdrawn.  The officer in command at the gates threw a cloak over Wilfrid's shoulders; and taking the arm of a friend Wilfrid hurried to barracks, and was quickly in a position to report himself to his General, whose first remark, 'Has the dead horse been removed?' robbed him of his usual readiness to equivocate.  'When you are the bearer of a verbal despatch, come straight to quarters, if you have to come like a fig-tree on the north side of the wall in Winter,' said General Schoneck, who was joined presently by General Pierson.  'What 's this I hear of some letter you have been barking about all over the city?' the latter asked, after returning his nephew's on-duty salute.  Wilfrid replied that it was a letter of his sister's treating of family matters.  The two Generals, who were close friends, discussed the attack to which he had been subjected.  Wilfrid had to recount it with circumstance: how, as he was nearing General Schoneck's quarters at a military trot, six men headed by a leader had dashed out on him from a narrow side-street, unhorsed him after a struggle, rifled the saddlebags, and torn the coat from his back, and had taken the mark of his sword, while a gathering crowd looked on, hooting.  His horse had fled, and he confessed that he had followed his horse.  General Schoneck spoke the name of Countess Lena suggestively.  'Not a bit,' returned General Pierson; 'the fellow courts her too hotly.  The scoundrels here want a bombardment; that 's where it lies.  A dose of iron pills will make Verona a healthy place.  She must have it.'  General Schoneck said, 'I hope not,' and laughed at the heat of Irish blood.  He led Wilfrid in to the Marshal, after which Wilfrid was free to seek Lieutenant Jenna, who had gained the right to a similar freedom by pledging his honour not to fight within a stipulated term of days.  The next morning Wilfrid was roused by an orderly coming from his uncle, who placed in his hands a copy of Vittoria's letter: at the end of it his uncle had written, 'Rather astonishing.  Done pretty well; but by a foreigner.  \"Affection\" spelt with one \"f.\"  An Italian: you will see the letters are emphatic at \"ugly flag\"; also \"bloody and past forgiveness\" very large; the copyist had a dash of the feelings of a commentator, and did his (or her) best to add an oath to it.  Who the deuce, sir, is this opera girl calling herself Vittoria?  I have a lecture for you.  German women don't forgive diversions during courtship; and if you let this Countess Lena slip, your chance has gone.  I compliment you on your power of lying; but you must learn to show your right face to me, or the very handsome feature, your nose, and that useful box, your skull,"]]]
