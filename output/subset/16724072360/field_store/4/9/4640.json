Lady Bridget's letters were type-written, most carelessly, with the mistakes corrected down the margin of the flimsy sheets in the manner of author's proof--the whole appearance of them suggesting literary 'copy'.  Likewise, the slapdash epistolary style of the MS., which had a certain vividness of its own.     CHAPTER 2   'Dearest Joan,  You'll have got my wire. Vancouver was right, I suppose. I sent it from Rome. Since then I have been at Montreux with Chris and Molly, and since I came back to England with them, I've been in too chaotic a state of mind to write letters. Really, Chris and Molly's atmosphere of struggling to keep in the swim on next to nothing a year and of eking out a precarious income by visits to second-rate country houses and cadging on their London friends gets on my nerves to such an extent that Luke and Rosamond's established \"Colonial Office\" sort of respectability is quite refreshing by contrast.  I should have loved the Australian trip. Your \"Bush\" sounds perfectly captivating, and, of course, I could do the illustrations you want. Besides, I'm stony-broke and, financially, the great god Gibbs appeals to me. I'd take my passage straight off--one would raise the money somehow--if it wasn't for--There! It's out. A MAN has come and upset the apple-cart.'  Mrs Gildea gave a funny little laugh. The letter answered her thought.  '\"Oh, of course!\" I can hear you sneer. \"Just another of Biddy's emotional interests--bound to fizzle out before very long.\" But this is a good deal more than an emotional interest, and I don't think it will fizzle out so quickly. For one thing, THIS man is quite different from all the other men I've ever been interested in. The first moment I saw him, I had the queerest sort of ARRESTED sensation. He's told me since, that he felt exactly the same about me. Kind of lived before--\"WHEN I WAS A KING IN BABYLON AND YOU WERE A CHRISTIAN SLAVE\" idea. Though I'm quite certain that if I ever was a slave it must have been a Pagan and not a Christian one. Joan, the experience was thrilling, positively electrifying--Glamour--personal magnetism.... You couldn't possibly understand unless you knew HIM. Descriptions are so hopeless. I'll leave him to your imagination.  By the way, Molly annoyed me horribly the other day. \"You know, dear,\" she had the audacity to remark, \"he's not of OUR class, and if you married him, you'd have to give up US! For could you suppose,\" she went on to say, \"that Chris and Mama--to say nothing of Aunt Eliza--would tolerate an adventurer who tells tall stories about buried treasure and native rebellions and expects one to be amused!\"  OUR CLASS! Oh, how I detest the label! And that unspeakably dreadful idea of social sheep and goats--and the unfathomable abyss between Suburbia and Belgravia! Though I frankly own that to me Suburbia represents the Absolutely Impossible. After all, one must go right into the Wilderness to escape the conditions of that state of life to which you happen to have been born.  Well, that speech of Molly's came out of a fascinating account my Soldier of Fortune gave us of how he stage-managed a revolution in South America, and of an expedition he'd made in the Andes on the strength of a local tradition about the Incas' hidden gold. I call him my Soldier of Fortune--though he's not in any known Army list, because it's what he called himself. Likewise a Champion of the Dispossessed. He has an intense sympathy with the indigenous populations, and thinks the British system of conquering and corrupting native races simply a disgrace to civilisation. With all of which sentiments I entirely agree. Luke has taken to him immensely, chiefly, I fancy, because he was once private secretary to some Administrating Rajah in an Eastern-Archipelago or Indian Island, and as Luke is hankering after a colonial governorship, he wants to scrape up all the information he can about such posts.  I answered Molly that one may have a violent attraction to a man without in the least wanting to marry him, and that relieved her mind a little.  As for HIM, the attraction on his part seems equally violent. We do the most shockingly unconventional things together. He tells me that I carry him off his feet--that I've revolutionised his ideas about the \"nice English Girl\" (useless to protest that I'm not an English girl but a hybrid Celt). He says that I've wiped off his slate the scheme of life he'd been planning for his latter years. A comfortable existence in England--his doctor advises him to settle down in a temperate climate--an appointment on some City Board--rubber shares and that kind of thing--you know it all--a red brick house in South Kensington and perhaps a little place in the country. He did not fill in the picture--but I did for him--with the charmingly domesticated wife--well connected: the typical \"nice English Girl,\" heiress of a comfortable fortune to supplement his own, which he candidly admitted needs supplementing.  Of course he's not a mere vulgar fortune-hunter. He must be genuinely in love with the nice English Girl. And that's where I upset HIS apple-cart.  In fact, we are both in an IMPASSE. I'm not eligible for his post and I shouldn't want it if I were. To my mind marriage is only conceivable with a barbarian or a millionaire. From the sordid atmosphere of English conjugality upon an income of anything less than an assured 5,000 pounds a year, good Lord deliver me! And you know my reasons for adding another clause to my litany. Good Lord deliver me also from further experience of the exciting vicissitudes of a stock-jobbing career!  Then again, apart from personal prejudices, I am appalled, quite simply, at the cold-blooded marriage traffic that I see going on in London. Any crime committed in the name of Love is forgivable, but to sell a girl--soul and body to the highest bidder is to my mind, the unpardonable sin against the Holy Ghost. Frankly, I'm petrified with amazement at the way in which mothers hurl their daughters at the head of any man who will make a good settlement. There's Molly's sister--she chases the game till she has corralled it, and once inside her walls the unfortunate prey hasn't swallowed his first cup of tea before she has wedded him in imagination to one of her girls--\"How do you like Mr CHOSE?\" \"Like him? What is there to like? He's the same as all the rest of the men, and they're as like as a box of ninepins...\"  \"But what do you think of him...?\" \"But really there's nothing to think\" ... \"But don't you think he'd do for Hester?\" etcetera, etcetera.  She has just married the one before Hester to what she calls the perfect type of an English country gentleman--meaning that he owns an historical castle in Scotland, a coal mine in Wales and a mansion in Park Lane. Heavens! I'd rather follow the fortunes of a Nihilist and be sent to Siberia, or drive wild cattle and fight wild blacks with one of your Bush cowboys, than I'd marry the perfect type of an English country gentleman! Give me something REAL--anything but the semi-detached indifference of most of the couples one knows. No. MY man must be strong enough to carry ME off my feet and to break down all the conventions of \"OUR CLASS.\" Then, I'd cheerfully tramp through the forest beside him, if it came to that, or cook his dinner in front of our wigwam. Now, if my Soldier of Fortune were to ask me to climb the Andes with him in search of that buried treasure! But he won't: and--I confess it, Joan--I'm in mortal terror of his insisting upon my entering the sphere of stock-jobbing respectability instead, and of my being weak enough to consent. But we haven't got anywhere near that yet.  So far, I'm just--living--trying to make up my mind what it is that I want most. Do you know, that since my violent attraction to him--or whatever you like to call it--all sorts of odd bits of revelation have come to me as to the things that really matter!  For one thing, I'm pretty certain that the ultimate end of Being is Beauty and that Love means Beauty and Beauty means Love. The immediate result of this discovery is that I'm buying clothes with a reckless disregard of the state of my banking account.  I begin to understand and to sympathise with that pathetic striving after beauty which one sees in the tawdry finery and exaggerated hairdressing of a kitchenmaid--Rosamond Tallant has one who is wonderful to behold as she mounts the area steps on her Sundays out. Formerly I should have been horrified at that kitchenmaid. Now I have quite a fellow-feeling with her piteous attempts to make herself attractive to her young man, the grocer's boy or the under-footman I suppose. Am I not at this very moment sitting with complexion cream daubed on my face, in order that I may appear more attractive to MY young man. I know now how Molly's maid--who is keeping company with Luke's butler--feels when we all dine early for a theatre and Josephine gets an evening out at the Earl's Court Exhibition with her gentleman.  Sounds beastly vulgar, doesn't it? But that's just what I'm making myself pretty for--dinner there this evening at the French Restaurant with MY gentleman. It's quite proper: we are a party of four--the other two I may add are not in Rosamond's or Molly's set.  I've been interrupted--He has telephoned. The other pair have disappointed us. Will I defy conventions and dine with HIM alone?  Of course I will.'     CHAPTER 3   The particular sheet ended at this point. Mrs Gildea laid it down upon the earlier ones and took another from the little pile which she had spread in sequence for perusal. She smiled to herself in mournful amusement. For she scarcely questioned the probability that her friend would in due course become disillusioned of a very ordinary individual--he certainly sounded a little like an adventurer--who for some occult reason had been idealised by this great-souled, wayward and utterly foolish creature.

On how many pyres had not that oft-widowed soul committed suttee to be resurrected at the next freak of Destiny! And yet with it all, there was something strangely elusive, curiously virginal about Lady Bridget.  She had been in love so often: nevertheless, she had never loved. Joan Gildea perfectly realised the distinction. Biddy had been as much, and more in love with ideas as with persons. Art, Literature, Higher Thought, Nature, Philanthrophy, Mysticism--she spelled everything with a capital letter--Platonic Passion--the last most dangerous and most recurrent. As soon as one Emotional Interest burned out another rose from the ashes. And, while they lasted, she never counted the cost of these emotional interests.  But then she was an O'Hara: and all the O'Haras that had been were recklessly extravagant, squandering alike their feelings and their money. There wasn't a member of the house of Gaverick decently well to do, excepting indeed Eliza, Countess of Gaverick. She had been a Glasgow heiress and only belonged to the aristocracy by right of marriage with Bridget's uncle, the late Lord Gaverick, who on the death of his brother, about the time Bridget was grown up, had succeeded to the earldom, but not to the estate.  Gaverick Castle in the province of Connaught, which with the unproductive lands appertaining to it, had been in the possession of O'Haras from time immemorial, was sold by Bridget's father to pay his debts. His brother--the heiress' husband, who, unlike the traditional spendthrift O'Haras had accumulated a small fortune in business, was able by some lucky chance to buy back the Castle--partly with his wife's money--soon after his accession to the barren honours of the family. His widow inherited the place as well as the rest of her husband's property, and could do as she pleased with the whole. Thus the present holder of that ancient Irish title, young, charming and poor, stemming from a collateral branch, lived mainly upon his friends and upon the hope that Eliza, Countess of Gaverick, might at her death leave him the ancestral home and the wherewithal to maintain it.  As for Bridget's father, the last but one Earl of Gaverick, his career may be summed up as a series of dramatic episodes, matrimonial, social and financial.  His first wife had divorced him. His second wife--the mother of Lady Bridget--had deserted him for an operatic tenor and had died shortly afterwards. She herself had been an Italian singer.  Lord Gaverick did not marry again, and Mrs Gildea had gathered that the less said about his social adventures the better. Financially, he had subsisted precariously as a company promoter. There had come a final smash: and one morning the Earl of Gaverick had been found dead in his bed, an empty medicine bottle by his side. As he had been in the habit of taking chloral the Coroner's jury agreed upon the theory of an overdose.  Yes, Mrs Gildea could quite understand that apart from general views on the marriage question, Lady Bridget O'Hara might well shrink from further connection with City finance.     CHAPTER 4   A naughty little gust--herald of the sub-tropical afternoon breeze that comes up the Leichardt River from the sea, blew about the typed sheets on the table, and, among them, those of Lady Bridget's letter, as Mrs Gildea laid them down.  While she collected the various pages of manuscript that had been displaced and was bundling them together, with a banana on each sheaf to keep it safe, there came a second snap of the gate and a man's voice hailed her.  It was the voice of a man who sang baritone, and his accent was an odd combination of the Bush drawl grafted on to the mellifluous Gaelic, from which race he had originated.  'Any admittance, Mrs Gildea, except on business, during working hours?'  'Yes, it is working hours Colin, but you happen to be business because you're just the person I'm wanting to speak to, so come along.'  'Good for me, Joan,' and the man came along, clearing the rest of the garden path and the veranda steps in three strides.  He gripped Mrs Gildea's hand.  'You're nice and cool up here, and you get every bit of wind that's going along the river,' he said. 'It's a good thing you kept this humpey, Joan--a little nest for the bird to fly home to, eh?'  'Yes, I'm glad, though it seemed a silly piece of sentiment ... and, as you say, I always FELT the old bird might want to fly home for a bit some day. Well, YOU look cool enough, Colin.'  'This is temperate zone for me after the Leura.... But it's a hot March because we haven't had a proper rainy season, and I'll just stand here and catch the breeze for a minute or two before I sit down.'  He balanced himself on the veranda railing: took off his broad-brimmed Panama hat and mopped his forehead with a silk handkerchief. Mrs Gildea surveyed him with interested admiration.  A big man--large-limbed, bony--a typical Scotcher in that--with thin flanks, a well-set up back and massive shoulders. His face was browny-red all over except where the skin ran white under the hair and there was a ruddier ring round the upper part of the throat. His nose was thin between the eyes, broadening lower, high-bridged and with high cut nostrils, showing the sensitive red when he was enraged--as not infrequently happened. He had large honest blue eyes, intensely blue, of the fiery description with a trick of dropping the lids when he was in doubt or consideration. They were expressive eyes, as a rule keen and hard, but they could soften unexpectedly under the influence of emotion. At other times, according to the quality of the emotion, they glowed literally like blue flames. He was considered queer-tempered, rather sulky, and his face often took on a very unyielding expression.  He had thick reddish-yellow eyebrows at the base of a slightly receding forehead--wanting in benevolence, phrenologists would have said, and with the bump of self-esteem considerably developed. His hair was yellow, pure and simple--the color of spun silk, only coarser, and it would have curled at the ends had he not worn it close-cropped. His moustache and beard were rather deeper yellow, the beard short, well-shaped--the cut of Colin McKeith's beard was almost his only vanity--there was one other, the 'millionare strut' in town--and he had the masculine habit of stroking and clasping his beard with his large open-fingered hand--spatulate tips to his digits, the practical hand--fairly well kept, though brown and hairy.  There were lines in his face and a way of setting his features--that a man gets when he has to front straight some cruel facts of human existance--to calculate at a glance the chances of death from a black's spear, a lost trail, an empty water-bag, the horns of a charging bullock or even worse things than these.  And such experiences had put a stamp on him, and distinguished him from the ordinary ruck of men--these and his undeniable manliness, and good looks.  He smiled as he glanced amusedly from the littered wind-blown papers on the table to his hostess' rather troubled face.  'Well you seem to have a pretty fair show here of what you call \"copy,\"' he said.  Mrs Gildea met his look with one of frank pleasure.  'That's what I want YOU for.'  'What's the job?' he asked. 'You ought to know that literary \"copy\" is not much in my line. Now if it had been yarding the fowls or cleaning up the garden, I'd feel more at home as a lady's help.'  'Colin, you take me back to Bungroopim--when it happened to be a slack day for you on the run, and when the married couple had levanted and I'd got an incompetent black-gin in the kitchen--or when the store wanted tidying and you and I had a good old spree amongst the rubbish.'  He laughed at a time-honoured joke.  'Stick sugar-mats and weevilly four-bins; and a breeding paddock of tarantulas and centipedes and white lizards to clear out. I WAS a bush hobbledehoy in those days, Joan. It's close on twenty years ago.'  Joan Gildea gave a little shudder.  'Don't remind me how old I am. There's the difference between a man and a woman. My life's behind me: yours in front of you.'  'I don't know about that, Joan. I've had my spell of roughing it--droving, mining, pioneering--humping bluey along the track--stoney-broke: sold up by the bank and only just beginning now to find out what Australia's worth.'  'That's what I said--you are just beginning. Roughing it has made a splendid man of you, Colin: and who would ever believe that you are four years older than I am. Colin, you ought to get married.'  'The Upper Leura is no place for the sort of wife I want,' he returned shortly.  'I don't see that. It isn't as if you were going to stop there always. When you're rich enough you can put on a manager. You've got an enormous piece of pretty good country, haven't you?'  'One thousand square miles--and a lot more to be got for the taking--mostly fair cattle pasture--now that we're going in for Artesian bores. But it means capital, sinking wells three thousand feet and more. It'll be three or four years at least before I can see a trip to Europe--doing the thing in the way I mean to do it.'  'Must you go to Europe for a wife? Aren't Australian girls good enough?'  'I've always meant to try for the best. You taught me that, Joan, I shall follow your example. You were an Australian girl.'  Mrs Gildea's face saddened. 'Well,' was all she said.  'You see,' he went on, and the eyes took their narrow concentrated look and suddenly blazed out as he straightened himself against the veranda post, 'I know something of what marriage in the back block means: and I've studied women--don't laugh--I mean theoretically--from books. I've read history--always managed a couple of volumes or so in my swag--nights and nights, by the light of a fat lamp and a camp fire. I've studied the women of great times--ancie"]]]
