I know, we have you on a chart,\" Gotch said amiably. \"We know every move you've made since you wet your first diapers. Like that curvy little brunette secretary out in San Diego, or that blonde night club warbler you were rushing in Las Vegas.\" Crag flushed. The Colonel eyed him tolerantly.  \"And plenty more,\" he added. He glanced at Crag's double. \"I'm sure your twin will be happy to fill in for you tonight.\"  \"Like hell he will,\" gritted Crag. The room was quiet for a moment.  \"As I said, he'll fill in for you.\"  Crag grinned crookedly. \"Ann won't go for it. She's used to the real article.\"  \"We're not giving her a chance to snafu the works,\" Gotch said grimly. \"She's in protective custody. We have a double for her, too.\"  \"Mind explaining?\"  \"Not a bit. Let's face the facts and admit both Romer and Temple were murdered. That leaves only you. The enemy isn't about to let us get the Aztec into space. You're the only pilot left who's been trained for the big jump--the only man with the specialized know-how. That's why you're on someone's list. Perhaps, even, someone here at the Base ... or on the highway ... or in town. I don't know when or how but I do know this: You're a marked monkey.\"  Gotch added flatly: \"I don't propose to let you get murdered.\"  \"How about him?\" Crag nodded toward his double. The man smiled faintly.  \"That's what he's paid for,\" Gotch said unfeelingly. His lips curled sardonically. \"All the heroes aren't in space.\"  Crag flushed. Gotch had a way of making him uncomfortable as no other man ever had. The gentle needle. But it was true. The Aztec was his baby. Gotch's role was to see that he lived long enough to get it into space. The rest was up to him. Something about the situation struck him as humorous. He looked at his double with a wry grin.  \"Home and to bed early,\" he cautioned. \"Don't forget you've got my reputation to uphold.\"  \"Go to hell,\" his double said amiably.  \"Okay, let's get down to business,\" Gotch growled. \"I've got a little to say.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Long after they left Crag stood at the small window, looking out over the desert. Somewhere out there was the Aztec, a silver arrow crouched in its cradle, its nose pointed toward the stars. He drew the picture in his mind. She stood on her tail fins; a six-story-tall needle braced by metal catwalks and guard rails; a cousin twice-removed to the great nuclear weapons which guarded Fortress America. He had seen her at night, under the batteries of floor lights, agleam with a milky radiance; a virgin looking skyward, which, in fact, she was. Midway along her length her diameter tapered abruptly, tapered again beyond the three-quarters point. Her nose looked slender compared with her body, yet it contained a space cabin with all the panoply needed to sustain life beyond the atmosphere.  His thoughts were reverent, if not loving. Save for occasional too-brief intervals with Ann, the ship had dominated his life for over a year. He knew her more intimately, he thought, than a long-married man knows his wife.  He had never ceased to marvel at the Aztec's complexity. Everything about the rocket spoke of the future. She was clearly designed to perform in a time not yet come, at a place not yet known. She would fly, watching the stars, continuously measuring the angle between them, computing her way through the abyss of space. Like a woman she would understand the deep currents within her, the introspective sensing of every force which had an effect upon her life. She would measure gravitation, acceleration and angular velocity with infinite precision. She would count these as units of time, perform complex mathematical equations, translate them into course data, and find her way unerringly across the purple-black night which separated her from her assignation with destiny. She would move with the certainty of a woman fleeing to her lover. Yes, he thought, he would put his life in the lady's hands. He would ride with her on swift wings. But he would be her master.         *       *       *       *       *  His mood changed. He turned from the window thinking it was a hell of a way to spend his last night. Last night on earth, he corrected wryly. He couldn't leave the room, couldn't budge, didn't know where Ann was. No telephone. He went to bed wondering how he'd ever let himself get snookered into the deal. Here he was, young, with a zest for life and a stacked-up gal on the string. And what was he doing about it? Going to the moon, that's what. Going to some damned hell-hole called Arzachel, all because a smooth bird colonel had pitched him a few soft words. Sucker!  His lips twisted in a crooked grin. Gotch had seduced him by describing his mission as an \"out-of-this-world opportunity.\" Those had been Gotch's words. Well, that was Arzachel. And pretty quick it would be Adam Crag. Out-of-this-world Crag. Just now the thought wasn't so appealing.         *       *       *       *       *  Sleep didn't come easy. At Gotch's orders he had turned in early, at the unheard hour of seven. Getting to sleep was another matter. It's strange, he thought, he didn't have any of the feelings Doc Weldon, the psychiatrist, had warned him of. He wasn't nervous, wasn't afraid. Yet before another sun had set he'd be driving the Aztec up from earth, into the loneliness of space, to a bleak crater named Arzachel. He would face the dangers of intense cosmic radiation, chance meteor swarms, and human errors in calculation which could spell disaster. It would be the first step in the world race for control of the Solar System--a crucial race with the small nations of the world watching for the winner. Watching and waiting to see which way to lean.  He was already cut off from mankind, imprisoned in a small room with the momentous zero hour drawing steadily nearer. Strange, he thought, there had been a time when his career had seemed ended, washed up, finished, the magic of the stratosphere behind him for good. Sure, he'd resigned from the Air Force at his own free will, even if his C. O. had made the pointed suggestion. Because he hadn't blindly followed orders. Because he'd believed in making his own decisions when the chips were down. \"Lack of _esprit de corps_,\" his C. O. had termed it.  He'd been surprised that night--it was over a year ago now--that Colonel Gotch had contacted him. (Just when he was wondering where he might get a job. He hadn't liked the prosaic prospects of pushing passengers around the country in some jet job.) Sure, he'd jumped at the offer. But the question had never left his mind. _Why had Gotch selected him?_ The Aztec, a silver needle plunging through space followed by her drones, all in his tender care. He was planning the step-by-step procedure of take-off when sleep came.     CHAPTER 2   Crag woke with a start, sensing he was not alone. The sound came again--a key being fitted into a lock. He started from bed as the door swung open.  \"Easy. It's me--Gotch.\" Crag relaxed. A square solid figure took form.  \"Don't turn on the light.\"  \"Okay. What gives?\"  \"One moment.\" Gotch turned back toward the door and beckoned. Another figure glided into the room--a shadow in the dim light. Crag caught the glint of a uniform. Air Force officer, he thought.  Gotch said crisply; \"Out of bed.\"  He climbed out, standing alongside the bed in his shorts, wondering at the Colonel's cloak-and-dagger approach.  \"Okay, Major, it's your turn,\" Gotch said.  The newcomer--Crag saw he was a major--methodically stripped down to his shorts and got into bed without a word. Crag grinned, wondering how the Major liked his part in Step One. It was scarcely a lead role.  Gotch cut into his thoughts. \"Get dressed.\" He indicated the Major's uniform. Crag donned the garments silently. When he had finished the Colonel walked around him in the dark, studying him from all angles.  \"Seems to fit very well,\" he said finally. \"All right, let's go.\"  Crag followed him from the room wondering what the unknown Major must be thinking. He wanted to ask about his double but refrained. Long ago he had learned there was a time to talk, and a time to keep quiet. This was the quiet time. At the outer door four soldiers sprang from the darkness and boxed them in. A chauffeur jumped from a waiting car and opened the rear door. At the last moment Crag stepped aside and made a mock bow.  \"After you, Colonel.\" His voice held a touch of sarcasm.  Gotch grunted and climbed into the rear seat and he followed. The chauffeur blinked his lights twice before starting the engine. Somewhere ahead a car pulled away from the curb. They followed, leaving the four soldiers behind. Crag twisted his body and looked curiously out the rear window. Another car dogged their wake. Precautions, always precautions, he thought. Gotch had entered with an Air Force officer and had ostensibly left with one; ergo, it must be the same officer. He chuckled, thinking he had more doubles than a movie star.  They sped through the night with the escorts fore and aft. Gotch was a silent hulking form on the seat beside him. It's his zero hour, too, Crag thought. The Colonel had tossed the dice. Now he was waiting for their fall, with his career in the pot. After a while Gotch said conversationally:  \"You'll report in at Albrook, Major. I imagine you'll be getting in a bit of flying from here on out.\"  Talking for the chauffeur's benefit, Crag thought. Good Lord, did every move have to be cloak and dagger? Aloud he said:  \"Be good to get back in the air again. Perhaps anti-sub patrol, eh?\"  \"Very likely.\"  They fell silent again. The car skimmed west on Highway 80, leaving the silver rocket"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/43235"],["title","First on the Moon (#2)"],["body","behind with every mile. Where to and what next? He gave up trying to figure the Colonel's strategy. One thing he was sure of. The hard-faced man next to him knew exactly what he was doing. If it was secret agent stuff, then that's the way it had to be played.         *       *       *       *       *  He leaned back and thought of the task ahead--the rocket he had lived with for over a year. Now the marriage would be consummated. Every detail of the Aztec was vivid in his mind. Like the three great motors tucked triangularly between her tail fins, each a tank equipped with a flaring nozzle to feed in hot gases under pressure. He pictured the fuel tanks just forward of the engines; the way the fuels were mixed, vaporized, forced into the fireports where they would ignite and react explosively, generating the enormous volumes of flaming hot gas to drive out through the jet tubes and provide the tremendous thrust needed to boost her into the skies. Between the engines and fuel tanks was a maze of machinery--fuel lines, speed controllers, electric motors.  He let his mind rove over the rocket thinking that before many hours had passed he would need every morsel of the knowledge he had so carefully gathered. Midway where the hull tapered was a joint, the separation point between the first and second stages. The second stage had one engine fed by two tanks. The exterior of the second stage was smooth, finless, for it was designed to operate at the fringe of space where the air molecules were widely spaced; but it could be steered by small deflectors mounted in its blast stream.  The third stage was little more than a space cabin riding between the tapered nose cone and a single relatively low-thrust engine. Between the engine and tanks was a maze of turbines, pumps, meters, motors, wires. A generator provided electricity for the ship's electric and electronic equipment; this in turn was spun by a turbine driven by the explosive decomposition of hydrogen peroxide. Forward of this was the Brain, a complex guidance mechanism which monitored engine performance, kept track of speed, computed course. All that was needed was the human hand. His hand.         *       *       *       *       *  They traveled several hours with only occasional words, purring across the flat sandy wastes at a steady seventy. The cars boxing them in kept at a steady distance.  Crag watched the yellow headlights sweep across the sage lining the highway, giving an odd illusion of movement. Light and shadow danced in eerie patterns. The chauffeur turned onto a two-lane road heading north. Alpine Base, Crag thought. He had been stationed there several years before. Now it was reputed to be the launch site of one of the three drones slated to cross the gulfs of space. The chauffeur drove past a housing area and turned in the direction he knew the strip to be.         *       *       *       *       *  Somewhere in the darkness ahead a drone brooded on its pad, one of the children of the silver missile they'd left behind. But why the drone? The question bothered him. They were stopped several times in the next half mile. Each time Gotch gave his name and rank and extended his credentials. Each time they were waved on by silent sharp-eyed sentries, but only after an exacting scrutiny. Crag was groping for answers when the chauffeur pulled to one side of the road and stopped. He leaped out and opened the rear door, standing silently to one side. When they emerged, he got back into the car and drove away. No word had been spoken. Figures moved toward them, coming out of the blackness.  \"Stand where you are and be recognized.\" The figures took shape--soldiers with leveled rifles. They stood very still until one wearing a captain's bars approached, flashing a light in their faces.  \"Identity?\"  Crag's companion extended his credentials.  \"Colonel Michael Gotch,\" he monotoned. The Captain turned the light on Gotch's face to compare it with the picture on the identification card. He paid scant attention to Crag. Finally he looked up.  \"Proceed, Sir.\" It was evident the Colonel's guest was very much expected.  Gotch struck off through the darkness with Crag at his heels. The stars shone with icy brilliance. Overhead Antares stared down from its lair in Scorpio, blinking with fearful venom. The smell of sage filled the air, and some sweet elusive odor Crag couldn't identify. A warmth stole upward as the furnace of the desert gave up its stored heat. He strained his eyes into the darkness; stars, the black desert ... and the hulking form of Gotch, moving with certain steps.  He saw the rocket with startling suddenness--a great black silhouette blotting out a segment of the stars. It stood gigantic, towering, graceful, a taper-nosed monster crouched to spring, its finned haunches squatted against the launch pad.  They were stopped, challenged, allowed to proceed. Crag pondered the reason for their visit to the drone. Gotch, he knew, had a good reason for every move he made. They drew nearer and he saw that most of the catwalks, guardrails and metal supports had been removed--a certain sign that the giant before them was near its zero hour.  Another sentry gave challenge at the base of the behemoth. Crag whistled to himself. This one wore the silver leaf of a lieutenant colonel! The ritual of identification was exacting before the sentry moved aside. A ladder zigzagged upward through what skeletal framework still remained. Crag lifted his eyes. It terminated high up, near the nose.  This was the Aztec! The real Aztec! The truth came in a rush. The huge silver ship at Burning Sands, which bore the name Aztec, was merely a fake, a subterfuge, a pawn in the complex game of agents and counter-agents. He knew he was right.  \"After you,\" Gotch said. He indicated the ladder and stepped aside.  Crag started up. He paused at the third platform. The floor of the desert was a sea of darkness. Off in the distance the lights of Alpine Base gleamed, stark against the night. Gotch reached his level and laid a restraining hand on his arm.  Crag turned and waited. The Colonel's massive form was a black shadow interposed between him and the lights of Alpine Base.  \"This is the Aztec,\" he said simply.  \"So I guessed. And the silver job at Burning Sands?\"  \"Drone Able,\" Gotch explained. \"The deception was necessary--a part of the cat and mouse game we've been playing the last couple of decades. We couldn't take a single chance.\" Crag remained silent. The Colonel turned toward the lights of the Base. He had become quiet, reflective. When he spoke, his voice was soft, almost like a man talking to himself.  \"Out there are hundreds of men who have given a large part of their lives to the dream of space flight. Now we are at the eve of making that dream live. If we gain the moon, we gain the planets. That's the destiny of Man. The Aztec is the first step.\" He turned back and faced Crag.  \"This is but one base. There are many others. Beyond them are the factories, laboratories, colleges, scientists and engineers, right down to Joe the Riveter. Every one of them has had a part in the dream. You're another part, Adam, but you happen to have the lead role.\" He swiveled around and looked silently at the distant lights. The moment was solemn. A slight shiver ran through Crag's body.  \"You know and I know that the Aztec is a development from the ICBM's guarding Fortress America. You also know, or have heard, that out in San Diego the first atom-powered spaceship is nearing completion.\" He looked sharply at Crag.  \"I've heard,\" Crag said noncommittally.  Gotch eyed him steadily. \"That's the point. So have others. Our space program is no secret. But we've suspected--feared--that the first stab at deep space would be made before the atom job was completed. Not satellites but deep space rockets. That's why the Aztec was pushed through so fast.\" He fell silent. Crag waited.  \"Well, the worst has happened. The enemy is ready to launch--may have launched this very night. That's how close it is. Fortunately our gamble with the Aztec is paying off. We're ready, too, Adam.  \"We're going to get that moon. Get it now!\" He reached into a pocket and extracted his pipe, then thought better of lighting it. Crag waited. The Colonel was in a rare introspective mood, a quiet moment in which he mentally tied together and weighed his Nation's prospects in the frightening days ahead. Finally he spoke:  \"We put a rocket around the moon, Adam.\" He smiled faintly, noting Crag's involuntary start of surprise. \"Naturally it was fully instrumented. There's uranium there--one big load located in the most inaccessible spot imaginable.\"  \"Arzachel,\" Crag said simply.  \"The south side of Arzachel, to be exact. That's why we didn't pick a soft touch like Mare Imbrium, in case you've wondered.\"  \"I've wondered.\"  \"Adam,\" the Colonel hesitated a long moment, \"does the name Pickering mean anything to you?\"  \"Ken Pickering who--\"  \"What have you heard?\" snapped Gotch. His eyes became sharp drills.  Crag spoke slowly: \"Nothing ... for a long time. He just seemed to drop out of sight after he broke the altitude record in the X-34.\" He looked up questioningly.  \"Frankly, I've always wondered why he hadn't been selected for this job. I thought he was a better pilot than I am,\" he added almost humbly.  Gotch said bluntly: \"You're right. He is better.\" He smiled tolerantly. \"We picked our men for particular jobs,\" he said finally. \"Pickering ... we hope ... will be in orbit before the Aztec blasts off.\"  \"Satelloid?\"  \"The first true satelloid,\" the Colonel agreed. \"One that can ride the fringes of space around the earth. A satelloid with fantastic altitude and speed. I'm telling you this because he'll be a link in Step One, a communication and observation link. He won't be up long, of course, but long enough--we hope.\"  Silence fell between them. Crag looked past the Colonel's shoulder. All at once the lights of Alpine Base seemed "]]]
