After being stricken with blindness on the way up to Damascus, and hearing the voice of a risen Redeemer, he was told to \"Arise and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do.\" (Acts 9:6.) After fasting and prayer, he was visited at the end of three days, by one Ananias, who had been commanded of the Lord in vision, to visit Paul, and was furthermore told, that he was a \"chosen vessel,\" or, in other words, one whom the Lord hath made promises to before the \"world began,\" and who had a mission to perform before \"Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel.\" The question of Ananias was, \"And now why tarriest thou? Arise, and _be baptized_, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.\" (Acts 22:16.)  We have presented for the consideration of the reader but a few Biblical proofs of man's pre-existence, out of the many that can be selected, yet consider that sufficient has been advanced to show conclusively that the claim of the Latter-day Saints to a belief in this principle is founded upon holy writ. Their ideas only coincide with the prophets and servants of God in all ages of the world who have alluded to this subject.  Having answered the question: _Where did we come from?_ let us now consider  WHY WE ARE HERE.  A wise Creator must have had some great object in view in the creation of the earth, and placing upon it His children, to pass through what they are called upon to, while in this probation. A knowledge of this object is almost positively necessary to enable the human family to act well their part. Let us then examine what He had in view.  The primary object of man's existence upon the earth is to obtain a body of flesh and bone; for without this it is impossible to advance in the grand scale of being in which he is to move in the eternal worlds.  It is necessary also for him to learn, by actual experience, the difference between good and evil. As was said of our first parents, \"And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil.\" (Gen. 3:22.)  It is necessary that man taste the bitter to enable him to appreciate the sweet. No proper appreciation of the value of eternal life could be arrived at, without having experienced its opposite.  A man must feel the effects of sickness to enable him to fully appreciate the great boon of health. He must feel the effects of pain, before he can enjoy immunity therefrom. He must feel the influence and power of death, before he can appreciate eternal life. He must comprehend the effects of sin before he can enjoy \"the rest promised to the faithful.\" There are many experiences that he can gain in the flesh that cannot be obtained elsewhere. There are ordinances to be performed and eternal unions to be perfected, that in the wise economy of the great Creator, must be effected here on the earth. Baptism for the remission of sins and marriage for eternity, are prominent features of duty that devolve upon man in his second state, or during his existence upon the earth. It is not all of man's duty to care for himself alone, to selfishly neglect his fellow-man, and seek aggrandizement himself at their expense. \"Do unto others as ye would that they should do unto you,\" is called the Golden Rule, by which men should be governed in this life. In brief, man has a work to do to prepare himself for a future exaltation in the eternities to come. He is called upon to \"work out his salvation with fear and trembling,\" for the work done in this life will have its influence in that to come. By obedience to the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ, he prepares himself for the grand and glorious exaltation held in reserve for those who worship God in \"Spirit and in truth.\" As Jesus said to His apostles, \"I go to prepare a place for you,\" for \"in my Father's house are many mansions.\"  Having learned why we are here, let us examine what is the nature of the duties devolving upon us.  FAITH.  To enable a man to perform any work whatever, requires that he have faith in the ultimate result of the work. No farmer would plant unless he expected to reap; no builder build, unless he expected to inhabit; no speculator invest unless he expected to increase his means; no journey would be attempted unless there existed hope of reaching the destination. So, likewise, no commandment of God would be obeyed, unless there existed faith that certain blessings would follow obedience.  With this idea plainly before us, we can comprehend the assertion of the Apostle Paul to the Hebrews, \"But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.\" (Heb. 11:6.)  We find the active workings of the principle of faith in the many cases of healing performed by our Savior. \"Thy faith hath made thee whole,\" was the invariable remark he made to one and all: and we find him speaking to the apostles in the strongest terms about their lack of this great principle. Upon one occasion they came to Him with the question: \"Why could not we cast him out? And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have _faith_ as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove, and nothing shall be impossible unto you.\" (Matt. 17:19, 20.) Again, we read, \"And He did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief\" (Matt. 13:58), or in other words, they had no faith in the claim He made to being the Messiah; consequently, they were deprived of the blessings that fell to those that had faith, as mankind to-day are depriving themselves of many _great and glorious_ blessings, through their unbelief in the divine calling of Joseph Smith, the prophet and seer.  We often hear the same cry to-day that greeted the ears of Jesus, \"Master, we would see a sign from thee. But He answered and said unto them, An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign.\" (Matt. 12:38, 39.)  What was true of the generation was true of the individual, and what was true then is true now, which places sign-seekers in a most unenviable position, but doubtless where they justly belong. Faith is not produced by sign-seeing, but in the words of Paul, \"Faith cometh by _hearing_, and hearing by the word of God.\" (Rom. 10:17.)  After the death and resurrection of Jesus, He left this grand test of faith upon record, to serve as a guide for all future generations: \"And these signs _shall_ follow _them that believe_\" (or have faith); \"In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; they shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.\" (Mark 16:17, 18.)  \"But,\" says one, \"was it not intended that these gifts and blessings should be limited to the days of the apostles, and to the apostles themselves?\" Read again, \"shall follow them that _believe_\"; and again, the preceding verse reads, \"He that _believeth_ and is baptized shall be saved.\" If you limit the signs following the believer to the day of the apostles, you must also limit salvation to that day. But it is to-day as it was in the day Paul wrote to the Hebrews: \"For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.\" (Heb. 4:2.)  The cultivation of this principle of faith is the first step in our duties in this life. The second step is that of  REPENTANCE. \"Repent, and _turn_ yourselves from _all_ your transgressions: so iniquity shall not be your ruin.\" (Ezek. 18:30.) \"Let the wicked forsake his way.\" (Isaiah 4:7.) \"Repent * * * every one of you.\" (Acts 2:38.) \"Except ye repent ye shall all likewise perish.\" (Luke 13:3.)  We understand that repentance does not consist in mourning over sins committed, and then repeating the same sin or one equally heinous, but that Ezekiel meant for the people to cease from doing wrong, to quit their evil practices, and walk in the paths of rectitude, virtue and true holiness. \"For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of; but the sorrow of the world worketh death.\" (II. Cor. 7:10.) We believe that the \"sorrow of the world\" here alluded to, is the too prevalent practice of crying, groaning and moaning over our wrong-doing, and then continuing the same practice.  The third step for man to take in this life to secure salvation in the eternal world, is to be  BAPTIZED.  \"He that believeth\" (that is, he that hath faith) \"and is _baptized_ shall be saved\" (Mark 16:16), was the emphatic assertion of our Savior. Again we find that man came under condemnation by refusing obedience to this commandment; \"But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, being _not baptized_ of him.\" (Luke 7:30.) So the world of to-day will, in the end, find themselves under condemnation for refusing to obey this principle of the gospel. \"Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he _can not_ enter into the kingdom of God.\" (John 3:5.)  Paul, writing to the Hebrews, says: \"Therefore, leaving out the principles of the doctrines of Christ, let us go on unto perfection: not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God, of the _doctrine of baptisms_, and of laying on of hands.\" (Heb. 6:1, 2.) Here are four principles all classed together, all equally important, all equally necessary, and all required at our hands by those fixed and eternal laws of truth and justice by which the worlds are governed, and by which we may return back into the presence of God, and dwell with the just, the true and the pure of all ages.  The fourth step necessary for man to take while in this state of probation, is to receive  THE LAYING ON OF HANDS.  for the reception of the Holy Ghost. This is a principle, to a great extent,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46617"],["title","The Plan of Salvation (#2)"],["body"," by the Christian world, yet plainly taught in the scriptures.  Peter and his brethren of the twelve had doubtless all been baptised, and endeavored to lead holy lives during their association with Jesus; yet we find Him, just previous to His ascension on high, telling them, \"Behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high. And He led them out as far as to Bethany, and He _lifted up His hands_, and blessed them.\" (Luke 24:49, 50.)  We find a still further explanation of the manner of obtaining this gift and blessing, in the Acts of the Apostles, where He \"commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, ye have heard of me. For John truly baptized with water, but ye shall be _baptized with the Holy Ghost_ not many days hence.\" (Acts 1:4, 5.)  Turning to the account of the ministry of Philip in Samaria, we find that after the Samaritans had exercised FAITH sufficient to cause them to REPENT, they had been BAPTIZED under the hands of Philip. \"Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John; who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost (for as yet he was fallen upon none of them; only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.) Then _laid they their hands on them and they received the Holy Ghost_.\" (Acts 8:14-17.)  Paul, writing to Timothy, charged him thus: \"Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of hands of the presbytery.\" (I. Tim. 4:14); and again, \"Wherefore I put thee in remembrance, that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by putting on of my hands.\" (II. Tim. 1:6.)  We also call the attention of the reader to the account of Paul's visit to the baptized saints of Ephesus, and his inquiry of them: \"Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost. * * * Then they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. And when Paul had _laid his hands_ upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them: and they spake with tongues and prophesied.\" (Acts 19:2-5.)  Sufficient has doubtless been said to clearly establish the fact that the gift of the Holy Ghost was formerly obtained by the laying on of the hands of those who held the authority to do so. Nowhere do we find that the order here laid down has been supplanted or annulled. On the contrary, the apostle spoke in the strongest terms against any innovation upon the established forms that Jesus taught them.  Paul, writing to the Galatians, speaks of those who were \"perverting\" the gospel; doubtless teaching that the laying on of hands was not necessary, or else that it was done away with, and says, \"But though we or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.\" (Gal. 1:8.)  The reader has now examined the fourth step for man's advancement in the probation in which he is now living; and in the words of our Savior, \"He that entereth not by the _door_ into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.\" (John 10:1.)  We have traced man from a pre-existent state, before the world began, when he dwelt in the presence of the Father, and of our elder Brother, Jesus, and mingled with the spirits who have or shall come into this sphere of action.  As it is beautifully expressed in one of the songs of Zion:    \"Oh my Father, Thou that dwellest In the high and glorious place! When shall I regain Thy presence, And again behold Thy face? In Thy holy habitation, Did my spirit once reside? In my first primeval childhood, Was I nurtured near Thy side?  For a wise and glorious purpose Thou hast placed me here on earth, And withheld the recollection, Of my former friends and birth; Yet ofttimes a secret something Whisper'd, 'You're a stranger here' And I felt that I had wandered From a more exalted sphere.\"    This is certainly a grander and nobler conception of man's origin that that of some of the would-be philosophers of to-day, who advocate the idea of evolution from a lower scale.  Having described the nature of the duties (to have faith in God and His promises, to repent of his sins, to be baptized for their remission, and to receive the laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost) that he must perform in this life to lay a foundation for future exaltation, we now turn to the consideration of man's FUTURE EXISTENCE.  Upon this subject there is a great diversity of opinion among men, and almost every possible conjecture has, from time to time, held the attention of the human family. If we are to judge by the accepted creeds of the Christian world, we find that an almost universal belief exists in future punishment.  We find, also, that the fear of future punishment is used as a mighty power to influence the minds of the people in a religious sense. The fearful horrors of the never-ending punishment of the guilty are portrayed in the liveliest colors from the Christian pulpits of the land. They are so clearly defined, that in many instances we find that the love and justice of God are lost sight of in the description of the fearful character of the punishment He inflicts, not so much upon unbelievers as upon those who reject the creeds, articles of faith and discipline, whereby men seek to \"know God.\"  Let the reader lay aside preconceived notions, tradition and prejudice, and examine this subject with a desire to know the truth.  We shall again refer to holy writ, and ask the candid attention of the reader to the proofs we place before him.  If we had the history of two persons, the one good and the other bad, after they left the earth, or laid down their bodies in death, it would serve as a guide to decide upon the future destiny of the whole human family. Fortunately, there is left upon record such information, and by it we can determine this all-important question.  No one will dispute the assertion that Jesus of Nazareth was appropriately termed the \"Just One,\" a person of pure and holy life.  The confession of guilt by one of the men crucified beside Jesus, is testimony enough to convict him of being a bad man. \"We received the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss\" (Luke 23:41), were the words of the malefactor, thus confessing that death was the proper penalty for the many crimes he was guilty of.  Now, here are two persons who were born upon the earth, lived out a certain number of years, and then laid down their lives, their bodies becoming cold and inanimate in death, while their spirits, freed from their earthly tenements, passed into another stage of existence, leaving their remains to be cared for in the ordinary rites of sepulture.  While suffering the agonies of crucifixion, a conversation was carried on between them, which will serve our purpose in opening up an investigation.  \"And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom. And Jesus said unto him, Verily, I say unto thee, to-day shalt thou be with me in paradise.\" (Luke 23:42, 43.)  The request of the thief was so far favorably looked upon, that he had the promise that he should accompany Jesus to a place which He designated as paradise. He could not have consistently granted him the privilege of entering into His kingdom, when He had replied to Nicodemus: \"Except a man be born of water (baptized) and of the Spirit (received the laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost) he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.\" (John 3:5.) The thief, not having attended to these ordinances, could lay no claim to that privilege; but, says Jesus, \"To-day shalt thou be with me in paradise.\"  We are aware that the majority of the Bible-believing world are of the opinion that the thief was permitted to enter heaven, and enjoy the presence of God; but is this idea a correct one? Let us candidly examine it, and see; for upon it hangs a great principle of truth.  After the body of Jesus had lain three days in the tomb, the spirit again entered into it. The angels rolled the stone away from the mouth of the sepulchre, and the resurrected Redeemer of the world walked forth, clothed with an immortal body of flesh and bones.  Mary, who seems to have had some special interest in the Savior, came early to the tomb, and weeping, discovered that the body of her Master was not there. A voice spake to her, saying, \"Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto Him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master. Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I AM NOT YET ASCENDED TO MY FATHER: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.\" (John 20:16, 17.)  Here we have the assertion of Jesus, Himself, that during the three days immediately subsequent to His crucifixion, while His body lay in the tomb, His spirit did not go into heaven or the presence of His Father. Logically, it must follow, neither did that of the thief. The generally accepted idea, therefore, of the thief being saved, must inevitably fall to the ground. Jesus asserted that \"To-day shalt thou be with me in paradise,\" and upon His return to the earth, He informed Mary that He had not ascended to His Father.  The question naturally arises, where had He been during these three days? We are not left in doubt upon this point, but scripture plainly points out the character of the duties He was called upon to perform, while His body rested in peace in the new-made tomb of Joseph. He to whom Jesus transferred the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and who stood at the head of the twelve apostles, would certainly be accepted as a competent witness in this matter; and, by turning to his epistles, we gain this information: \"For Christ also hath once suffered for "]]]
