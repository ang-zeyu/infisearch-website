TABLE OF CONTENTS.                         PROLEGOMENA.  INTRODUCTION--  1.  Is the Law the starting-point for the history of ancient Israel or for that of Judaism ?  The latter possibility is not precluded a priori by the history of the Canon. Reasons for considering it. De Wette, George, Vatke, Reuss, Graf  2.  The three strata of the Pentateuch: Deuteronomy, Priestly Code, Jehovist  3.  The question is as to the Priestly Code and its historical position.  Method of the investigation    A.  HISTORY OF WORSHIP.   CHAPTER  I.  THE PLACE OF WORSHIP--  I.I.1.   The historical and prophetical books show no trace in Hebrew antiquity of a sanctuary of exclusive legitimacy  I.I.2.   Polemic of the prophets against the sanctuaries. Fall of Samaria.  Reformation of Josiah  I.I.3.   Influence of the Babylonian exile  I.II.1.  The Jehovist (JE) sanctions a multiplicity of altars  I.II.2.  Deuteronomy (D) demands local unity of worship  I.II.3.  The Priestly Code (RQ) presupposes that unity, and transfers it, by means of the Tabernacle, to primitive times  I.III.1. The tabernacle, as a central sanctuary and dwelling for the ark, can nowhere be found in the historical tradition  I.III.2. Noldeke's view untenable   CHAPTER II. SACRIFICE--  II.I.1.   The ritual is according to RQ the main subject of the Mosaic legislation, according to JE it is pre-Mosaic usage; in RQ the point is How, according to JE and D To Whom, it is offered  II.I.2.   The historical books agree with JE; the prophets down to Ezekiel contradict RQ  II.II.1.  Material innovations in RQ.  Preliminary  remarks on the notion, contents, mode of offering, and propitiatory effects of sacrifice.  II.II.2.  Material and ideal refinement of the offerings in RQ  II.II.3.  The sacrificial meal gives way to holocausts  II.II.4.  Development of the trespass-offering.  II.III.1. The centralisation of worship at Jerusalem destroyed the connection of sacrifice with the natural occasions of life, so that it lost its original character     CHAPTER III. THE SACRED FEASTS--   III.I.1.   In JE and D there is a rotation of three festivals.   Easter and Pentecost mark the beginning and the end of the corn-harvest, and the autumn feast the vintage and the bringing home the corn from the threshing-floor.  With the feast of unleavened bread (Massoth) is conjoined, especially in D, the feast of the sacrifice of the male firstborn of cattle (Pesah).  III.I.2.   The feasts based on the offering of firstlings of the field and of the herd.  Significance of the land and of agriculture for religion  III.II.1.  In the historical and prophetical books, the autumn feast only is distinctly attested, and it is the most important in JE and D also: of the others there are only faint traces .  III.II.2.  But the nature of the festivals is the same as in JE and D  III.III.1. In RQ the feasts have lost their reference to harvest and the first fruits; and this essentially changes their nature  III.III.2. The metamorphosis was due to the centralisation of worship, and may he traced down through Deuteronomy and Ezekiel to RQ,  III.III.3. To the three festivals RQ adds the great day of atonement, which arose out of the fast-days of the exile  III.IV.1.  The Sabbath, which is connected with the new moon, was originally a lunar festival Exaggeration of the Sabbath rest in the Priestly Code  III.IV.2.  Sabbatical year, and year of Jubilee   CHAP.  IV.  THE PRIESTS AND THE LEVITES--   IV.I.1.   According to Ezek. xliv., only the Levites of Jerusalem, the sons of Zadok, are to continue priests in the new Jerusalem; the other Levites are to be degraded to their servants and denuded of their priestly rights.  According to RQ the Levites never possessed the priestly right, but only the sons of Aaron  IV.I.2.  These answer to the sons of Zadok  IV.II.1.  In the earliest period of the history of Israel there is no distinction between clergy and laity.  Every one may slaughter and sacrifice; there are professional priests only at the great sanctuaries.  Priestly families at Sihiloh and Dan.  No setting apart of what is holy  IV.II.2.  Royal temples of the kings; priests at them as royal officials  IV.II.3.  Importance of the North-Israelite priesthood in the time of the kings  IV.II.4.  The family of Zadok at Jerusalem  IV.III.1. In the oldest part of JE there are no priests; no Aaron by the side of Moses  IV.III.2. In D the Levites are priests.  They occur in that character, not to speak of Judges xviii. seq., only in the literature of the exile.  Their descent from Moses or Aaron.  The spiritual and the secular tribe of Levi.  Difficulty of bringing them together  IV.III.3. Consolidation of the spiritual tribe in RQ; separation of priests and Levites.  Further development of the clergy after the exile.  The high priest as head of the theocracy    CHAPTER V.  THE ENDOWMENT OF THE CLERGY--   V.I.1.   The sacrificial dues raised in RQ  V.I.2.   The firstlings were turned into contributions to the priests, and doubled in amount  V.II.1.  Levitical towns  V.II.2.  The historical situation underlying the priestly pretensions in RQ    B.  HISTORY OF TRADITION.   CHAPTER  VI.  CHRONICLES--  VI.I.1.  David becomes Saul's successor without any exertion, all Israel being already on his side, namely, the priests and Levites  Distortion of the original story of the bringing of the ark to Jerusalem.  Omission of unedifying incidents in David's life  VI.I.2.  Preparation for the building of the temple.  Delight of the narrator in numbers and names.  Inconsistency with 1Kings i, ii.  Picture of David in Chronicles  VI.I.3.  Solomon's sacrifice at the tabernacle at Gibeah.  Building of the temple.  Retouching of the original narrative  VI.II.1. Estimate of the relation between Judah and Israel; the Israelites do not belong to the temple, nor, consequently, to the theocracy  VI.II.2. Levitical idealising of Judah.  View taken of those acts of rulers in the temple-worship which the books of Kings condemn or approve. Inconsistencies with the narrative of the sources; importation of priests and Levites.  VI.II.3. Divine pragmatism of the sacred history, and its results  VI.II.4. The books of Kings obviously present throughout  VI.III.1. The genealogical registers of I Chron.i-ix  The ten tribes  VI.III.2. Judah and Levi  VI.III.3. Chronicles had no other sources for the period before the exile than the historical books preserved to us in the Canon. The diversity of historical view is due to the influence of the law, especially the Priestly Code.  The Midrash   CHAPTER  VII.  JUDGES, SAMUEL, AND KINGS--  VII.I.1.   The formula on which the book of Judges is constructed in point of chronology and of religion  VII.I.2.   Its relation to the stem of the tradition.  Judg. xix.-xxi.  VI.II.3.   Occasional additions to the original narratives  VII.I.4.   Difference of religious attitude in the latter  VII.II.1.  Chronological and religious formulas in the books of Samuel  VII.II.2.  The stories of the rise of the monarchy and the elevation of Saul entirely recast  VII.II.3.  Saul's relation to Samuel  VII.II.4.  The narrative of David's youth The view taken of Samuel may be regarded as a measure of the growth of the tradition Saul and David  VII.III.1. The last religious chronological revision of the books of Kings.  Similar in kind to that of Judges and Samuel Its standpoint Judaean and Deuteronomistic  VII.III.2. Its relation to the materials received from tradition  VII.III.3. Differences of sentiment in the sources  VII.III.4. In Chronicles the history  of ancient Israel is recast in accordance with the ideas of the Priestly Code; in the older historical books it is judged according to the standard of Deuteronomy   CHAPTER  VIII.

In the following pages it is proposed to discuss the place in history  of the \"law of Moses;\" more precisely, the question to be considered is whether that law is the starting-point for the history of ancient Israel, or not rather for that of Judaism, ie., of the religious communion which survived the destruction of the nation by the Assyrians and Chaldaeans.  I. It is an opinion very extensively held that the great mass of the books of the Old Testament not only relate to the pre-exilic period, but date from it.  According to this view, they are remnants of the literature of ancient Israel which the Jews rescued as a heritage from the past, and on which they continued to subsist in the decay of independent intellectual life.  In dogmatic theology Judaism is a mere empty chasm over which one springs from the Old Testament to the New; and even where this estimate is modified, the belief still prevails in a general way that the Judaism which received the books of Scripture into the canon had, as a rule, nothing to do with their production.  But the exceptions to this principle which are conceded as regards the second and third divisions of the Hebrew canon cannot be called so very slight.  Of the Hagiograpba, by far the larger portion is demonstrably post-exilic, and no part demonstrably older than the exile.  Daniel comes as far down as the Maccabaean wars, and Esther is perhaps even later.  Of the prophetical literature a very appreciable fraction is later than the fall of the Hebrew kingdom; and the associated historical books (the \"earlier prophets\" of the Hebrew canon) date, in the form in which we now possess them, from a period subsequent to the death of Jeconiah, who must have survived the year 560 B.C. for some time.  Making all allowance for the older sources utilised, and to a large extent transcribed word for word, in Judges, Samuel, and Kings, we find that apart from the Pentateuch the preexilic portion of the Old Testament amounts in bulk to little more than the half of the entire volume. All the rest belongs to the later period, and it includes not merely the feeble after-growths of a failing vegetation, but also productions of the vigour and originality of Isa. xl.lxvi. and Ps.Ixxiii.  We come then to the Law.  Here, as for most parts of the Old Testament, we have no express information as to the author and date of composition, and to get even approximately at the truth we are shut up to the use of such data as can be derived from an analysis of the contents, taken in conjunction with what we may happen to know from other sources as to the course of Israel's history.  But the habit has been to assume that the historical period to be considered in this connection ends with the Babylonian exile as certainly as it begins with the exodus from Egypt.  At first sight this assumption seems to be justified by the history of the canon; it was the Law that first became canonical through the influence of Ezra and Nehemiah; the Prophets became so considerably later, and the Hagiographa last of all.  Now it is not unnatural, from the chronological order in which these writings were received into the canon, to proceed to an inference as to their approximate relative age, and so not only to place the Prophets before the Hagiographa, but also the five books of Moses before the Prophets.  If the Prophets are for the most part older than the exile, how much more so the Law!  But however trustworthy such a mode of comparison may be when applied to the middle as contrasted with the latest portion of the canon, it is not at all to be relied on when the first part is contrasted with the other two.  The very idea of canonicity  was originally associated with the Torah, and was only afterwards extended to the other books, which slowly and by a gradual process acquired a certain measure of the validity given to the Torah by a single public and formal act, through which it was introduced at once as the Magna Charta of the Jewish communion (Nehemiah viii.-x.)  In their case the canonical-- that is, legal--character was not intrinsic, but was only subsequently acquired; there must therefore have been some interval, and there may have been a very long one, between the date of their origin and that of their receiving public sanction. To the Law, on the other hand, the canonical character is much more essential, and serious difficulties beset the assumption that the Law of Moses came into existence at a period long before the exile, aml did not attain the force of law until many centuries afterwards, and in totally different circumstances from those under which it had arisen.  At least the fact that a collection claiming public recognition as an ecclesiastical book should have attained such recognition earlier than other writings which make no such claim is no proof of superior antiquity.  We cannot, then, peremptorily refuse to regard it as possible that what was the law of Judaism may also have been its product; and there are urgent reasons for taking the suggestion into very careful consideration.  It may not be out of place here to refer to personal experience.  In my early student days I was attracted by the stories of Saul and David, Ahab and Elijah; the discourses of Amos and Isaiah laid strong hold on me, and I read myself well into the prophetic and historical books of the Old Testament. Thanks to such aids as were accessible to me, I even considered that I understood them tolerably, but at the same time was troubled with a bad conscience, as if I were beginning with the roof instead of the foundation; for I had no thorough acquaintance with the Law, of which I was accustomed to be told that it was the basis and postulate of the whole literature.  At last I took courage and made my way through Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and even through Knobel's Commentary to these books.  But it was in vain that I looked for the light which was to be shed from this source on the historical and prophetical books.  On the contrary, my enjoyment of the latter was marred by  the Law; it did not bring them any nearer me, but intruded itself uneasily, like a ghost that makes a noise indeed, but is not visible and really effects nothing.  Even where there were points of contact between it and them, differences also made themselves felt, and I found it impossible to give a candid decision in favour of the priority of the Law.  Dimly I began to perceive that throughout there was between them all the difference that separates two wholly distinct worlds.  Yet, so far from attaining clear conceptions, I only fell into deeper confusion, which was worse confounded by the explanations of Ewald in the second volume of history of Israel.  At last, in the course of a casual visit in Gottingen in the summer of 1867, I learned through Ritschl that Karl Heinrich Graf placed the law later than the Prophets, and, almost without knowing his reasons for the hypothesis, I was prepared to accept it; I readily acknowledged to myself thc possibility of understanding Hebrew antiquity without the book of the Torah.  The hypothesis usually associated with Graf's name is really not his, but-that of his teacher, Eduard Reuss.  It would be still more correct to call it after Leopold Gcorge and Wiihelm Vatke, who, independent alike of Reuss and of each other, were the first to give it literary currency.  All three, again, are disciples of Martin Lebrecht de Wette, the epochmaking pioneer of historical criticism in this field./1/   ******************************* 1. M. W.
