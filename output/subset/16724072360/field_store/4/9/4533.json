Ever and anon a herd of fallow deer would dash across the highway, or a troop of Forest ponies would scamper betwixt the trees, fearing in every human being a possible master. Pigs also roamed in great numbers, for though it was the time of fence month[1] within the Forest, so lax had the jurisdiction of the Verderers' Court become that the commoners paid less heed to the regulations than they had for years past.  At length we emerged from the forest and gained the rolling expanse of heath, where, to right and left, as far as the eye could reach, the heather and the gorse gleamed in the bright sunshine like a sea of purple and gold.  \"See, there's a man riding as fast as his horse can carry him!\" exclaimed Constance, pointing down the bridle path that, running between Ring wood and Beaulieu, crosses the highway near the place where we were.  \"Aye, he seems in a mighty hurry,\" I replied, shading my eyes from the glare.  \"Perchance 'tis another of those horse soldiers?\"  \"Nay, he wears no red coat,\" I answered, reassuring her; but though I did not mention it, I perceived two men riding a long distance behind the first horseman as if in pursuit, and, unless my eyes deceived me, they were dragoons.  \"Let us hasten,\" urged Constance, as if filled with some forebodings, though she was usually a strong-minded girl.  \"He'll not molest us,\" said I. \"He is too intent on his errand, I trow.\"  Nearer and nearer came the fugitive--for fugitive he was--till I could distinguish his features. Then my heart gave a sudden bound, for I recognized the man: it was Jeremy Miles, a master mariner of Lymington, and one of the townsfolk who had gone west to join the rebel standard.  Constance knew him also, for she exclaimed, \"'Tis Captain Miles! And see, Clifford, there are soldiers after him!\"  Something compelled me to stop and await the arrival of the fugitive, and, holding the pony's bridle by one hand, I assisted Constance to dismount.  As we stood we were hidden from the bridle path by a gorse-covered bank that, being but breast high, was sufficiently low to enable us to command the track on which the horsemen were riding without being seen by them until they gained the highway.  Not for one moment did I expect to be in danger, for Miles was riding strongly and evidently holding his own, while 'twas unlikely that the troopers, keen on his pursuit, would draw rein to molest a boy and a girl.  The fugitive was now crossing the white dusty road within twenty paces of us, when suddenly his horse sank under him, throwing its rider headlong to the ground. But before the expiring animal gave a last convulsive shudder, Miles had sprung to his feet and was looking dazedly towards his pursuers, now but a mile behind.  \"Captain Miles!\" I shouted, urging my pony forward. \"Captain Miles! Take Trotter and ride him across the heath.\"  \"Why, 'tis Master Hammond!\" he exclaimed. \"Nay, lad, that beast would not ship a crew like me: But they'll have their work cut out to take me. Come, young sir, I'll trouble you to give a hand with my mare, if you will.\"  Together, with Constance helping us, we dragged the body of the animal off the road, and hid it in a slight depression behind some furze bushes. Then hurriedly we strove to conceal the tell-tale tracks on the dusty road.  The dragoons were now only a bare quarter-mile away.   [1] The period between the 20th June and the 20th July, during which time the ancient right of \"Pannage\", i.e. turning out pigs to feed on acorns and beech-mast, within the New Forest was withheld.     CHAPTER II  The Two Dragoons on the Brockenhurst Road   \"Leave me and shape your own course, Master Hammond!\" exclaimed the Captain composedly, for he had regained both his breath and his wits. \"You can do no more, and I'll warrant I can shift for myself.\"  So saying, he wriggled along the ground over the bank that screened us from the soldiers, and lay hidden in the bracken on the same side of the highway as the troopers.  Meanwhile, filled with anxiety on the behalf of Jeremy Miles--for he was always a general favourite amongst the youths in and around Lymington--Constance and I resumed our way, endeavouring to appear as unconcerned as possible.  Less than a minute must have passed since we saw Captain Miles's great frame disappear beneath the bracken, when we heard the clatter of the troopers' horses as their hoofs struck the road. Knowing that it would ill play our part to refrain from curiosity, we stopped and looked back at the pursuing soldiers.  They were of the same troop that we had seen in Lyndhurst a short half-hour ago. Great, swarthy men they were, hardened to cruelty by reason of their service at Tangiers, and, though I knew it not at the time, ready to practise the barbarities acquired from the Moors upon their own countrymen, as many a poor peasant of the marshes of Somerset had learned to his cost.  \"Curse him!\" exclaimed one, with an oath. \"Where hath he gone? Are we to let a guinea slip through our fingers after all our trouble?\"  \"He's not far away,\" replied his comrade, pointing with an exclamation of triumph to the partially concealed tracks on the road. \"See, he hath had a fall. Methinks we have him by the heels.\"  \"'Tis like looking for a sprat in the ocean,\" returned the first trooper, gazing across the wilderness of gorse. \"So long as he stuck to his mount we could have tracked him. 'Tis what I feared: he hath made off afoot.\"  \"Here, sirrah,\" he shouted to me, urging his horse down the road to where we were, \"hast seen aught of a horseman riding like Beelzebub?\"  \"Nay,\" I replied truthfully enough; \"no horseman has passed this way.\"  \"You young prevaricator!\" he exclaimed, tapping his pistols significantly. \"You do but dissemble. You know whither that man went.\"  I kept silence.  Suddenly the other trooper, who had forced his horse through the gorse by the side of the road, shouted, \"Here's a find, David. The rogue hath lost his horse.\"  \"Then you saw him fall,\" continued the dragoon who had overtaken us. \"Back you come with me, you young rebel!\"  \"I am no rebel,\" I replied, as stoutly as I could force myself to speak.  \"Back, I say!\" he repeated, ignoring my protest, and producing a pistol from his holster. There was no help for it. I had to go with him. \"Run off home, Constance,\" I said in a low voice; \"I shall be all right.\"  \"No, you don't, you little wench!\" exclaimed the villain. \"You'll come in useful to make this young rebel open his mouth. Come on, both of you, I say!\"  I looked at Constance. She was deathly white, yet she spoke not a word, although by the expression of her eyes she said, as plainly as if she had spoken, \"Do not tell where he is.\"  \"Mum's the word, eh?\" was the greeting of the second trooper, as we were told to stand still near the scene of our meeting with the fugitive, Captain Miles. \"Shall I tell 'em about that stubborn young rebel at Dulverton--it was Dulverton, wasn't it, David?--who thought to deceive one of Cornbury's Dragoons? A little tow tied to his thumbs did the trick, and I'll swear he's nursing his burns now. There's no tow to be had hereabouts, but I'll warrant a little dry heather will suffice. Now, sirrah, which way did the rebel go?\"  \"What! you won't answer?\" he continued, as he dismounted from his horse, his comrade following his example. Whipping out his broadsword, he struck me a heavy blow on the ankle with the flat of the weapon. The pain was intense, yet, though an involuntary cry escaped me, I kept my lips tightly closed.  I gave a hasty look right and left along the straight white road. Not a creature was in sight. Even if there had been, 'twas difficult to imagine that a solitary wayfarer would dare to interfere with two armed and powerful ruffians.  \"Pluck me a wisp of dry grass,\" said my tormentor.  \"Nay, Jim,\" replied the other, \"we've no time to waste in that fashion. If the rebel is making off afoot, every moment is precious. I know of a way.\" And, thrusting his huge fingers through my sister's golden locks, he shouted, \"Now, sirrah, answer, or I'll pull out a handful of hair, to remember this pleasant meeting.\"  Constance cried with pain as the villain slowly tightened his grip. Knowing he was quite capable of carrying out his threat, I was torn with conflicting thoughts, till my brave sister exclaimed, \"Not a word, Clifford!\"  Possibly the rogue answering to the name of Jim realized my desperate intention, for at the risk of my life I was on the point of dashing my clenched fist in the face of Constance's assailant. With his right hand the dragoon gripped me by the nape of the neck, so that in his powerful grasp I was as helpless as a kitten; while with his left he caught and slowly twisted my wrist.  Suddenly a huge, dark form sprang from the concealing heather, and like an arrow from a bow Jeremy Miles flung himself upon the dragoon whose fingers were still grasping Constance's tresses.  I saw it all as clearly as if 'twere the work of minutes rather than of one instant. A swinging blow of the Captain's ponderous fist, and the ruffian's arm fell nerveless to his side; and a second blow stretched him lifeless on the ground. The other dragoon, with a furious oath, flung me headlong. As I fell I heard the crashing explosion of his pistol.  Slowly I raised myself on my arm, and watched the struggle betwixt our preserver and his antagonist. Powerful though the trooper was, the Captain, thanks to his strenuous life afloat, was his master. For a while they swayed to and fro in a desperate struggle, Jeremy's arms clasping the soldier like bands of steel, till the villain's resistance grew weaker and weaker.  Then, with a superhuman effort, Captain Miles wrenched his bulky foe clean off the ground, and hurled him, like a sack of flour, over his shoulder.  \"Bear a hand with your sister, lad,\" he then exclaimed, in a matter-of-fac"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38222"],["title","The Quest of the 'Golden Hope': A Seventeenth Century Story of Adventure (#2)"],["body","tone, although he was breathing heavily. \"She has swooned.\"  This was a work of some difficulty, for water was not at hand, but at length Constance opened her eyes. Poor girl! Although not much hurt, for the rogue had not had time to carry out his threat to the fullest extent, she was terribly frightened, and the sight of the two dragoons lying motionless on the road did not help matters.  \"Take her down the road a little way, and make her sit down,\" said Captain Jeremy kindly. \"Then hasten back, for I'll warrant we've a fine job to make all shipshape and Bristol fashion.\"  \"Have you seen any more of these lubbers?\" he asked, after I had returned from carrying out his instructions.  \"There was a troop of them in Lyndhurst this morning. They went Southampton-wards.\"  \"I'll pray that they'll not return in a hurry,\" he exclaimed. \"We've enough to do to cover up our tracks.\"  \"Are they dead?\" I asked shudderingly.  \"As a marline-spike,\" he replied. \"For the time we are safe; they were the only ones that battened themselves to me. The Duke is taken. I saw him seized by some of Portman's Militia near Ringwood but yesterday. Faith! I was disappointed in King Monmouth, for he fled from the field long before his men began to give way.\"  \"And how did you escape?\"  \"'Twas touch and go. Monmouth, in a peasant's dress, lay hidden in some ferns, I but ten yards away. Little did I think 'twas the Duke till I heard Portman say as 'twas. I suppose that find satisfied them, for they searched no more. Farmer Shearing of Ringwood lent me his mare, and I rode off early this morning, intending to shape a course for Pitt's Deep, for 'twould have been madness to return to Lymington. Master Hammond, I was a fool even to set out for the West. What I've seen in forty years afloat is naught to what I've seen these last few days. But let's to work!\"  We thereupon dragged the bodies of the troopers into the bracken, and carefully obliterated all signs of the struggle. The troopers' horses were contentedly nibbling the coarse grass by the roadside, our pony Trotter having followed Constance.  They were fine animals, these dragoons' mounts, and I wondered what would become of them. The same question evidently troubled Captain Miles, for if they came within hearing of a trumpet call they would most likely trot off to rejoin their fellows. Yet, as there were no troopers within several miles of us, the horses might be taken by some of the peasants who lived on the outskirts of the heath, especially if we removed the saddlery.  \"Nay, 'tis too much of a risk,\" muttered Jeremy to himself, though I heard the words; and, lifting the fore-foot of one of the animals, he examined its hoof. There, in a manner that could not be effaced, were the royal monogram and regimental number; while a further search revealed the government mark branded on the creature's flank.  \"Those marks are their death warrant,\" he exclaimed.  \"How so?\"  \"No man cares for a dumb animal more than I do,\" he replied. \"Yet, when human life and liberty are at stake, it behoves us to take stern measures. Now, I pray you, take your sister home, and return speedily with a pair of serviceable spades.\"  So saying, he led the two animals aside into the gorse, while I hastened to rejoin Constance. We had barely gone a hundred paces when a pistol shot rang out, quickly followed by another.  \"What sound is that?\" asked my sister.  \"'Tis but naught,\" I replied, not daring to tell her the plain truth. \"Captain Miles has unloaded the troopers' pistols.\"     CHAPTER III  Captain Jeremy's Surprise.   \"What hath befallen you?\" asked my father anxiously, as we crossed the threshold of the house. \"Ye are both as pale as ghosts, and your clothes, Clifford, are smothered in dust. Hath Trotter thrown you?\"  For answer, Constance sat down upon a settle and sobbed hysterically, while my father, stopping abruptly his task of questioning us, bestirred himself to comfort her.  \"Two dragoons have molested us,\" I announced. \"They were in pursuit of Captain Miles.\"  \"Have they hurt you?\" he asked.  \"Nay, but little--thanks to the Captain.\" In a few words I related the incidents that had terminated in the death of the two villains. My father looked grave.  \"And Jeremy?\" he asked. \"Hath he gone to Lymington?\"  \"Nay, he awaits me by the Beaulieu bridle path.\"  \"'Tis well for him, though I am loath to risk His Majesty's displeasure in succouring rebels. Yet, especially as he did befriend you, I'll do my best to repay Jeremy's kindness. He must not go to Lymington, Clifford.\"  \"He doth not intend to do so,\" said I. \"He is making for Pitt's Deep.\"  \"Equally as rash as if he journeyed to Lymington. I, too, heard the news this morning soon after you left. The dragoons watch every mile of this part of the coast, and at every little port a watch is set, so that no strangers dare set foot on shipboard without being closely questioned. My son, I take the risk even of harbouring a rebel. I'll go with thee and speak my mind with friend Jeremy.\"  Bidding Martha, our housekeeper, stay with Constance, and impressing upon her the necessity for silence as to what had occurred, my father, taking a mattock in his hand, set out to the scene of the encounter, I accompanying him, and carrying the spades over my shoulder.  \"Where is the package I bade you bring from Lyndhurst?\" he asked, as we left the outskirts of the village.  I searched the pockets of my doublet without success, though I was certain that the article had been safely placed in one of them.  \"It must have fallen out on the road,\" I replied.  \"'Tis a grave matter,\" he said, with a look of anxiety and a gesture of impatience. \"How can I--but there! if 't comes to the worst, I must journey into Southampton myself. 'Tis the fortune of war.\"  No more was said, for we were already in sight of the cross-roads, and Captain Miles was sitting on the bracken-covered bank awaiting us.  \"Good day to you, Cap'n Hammond!\" he exclaimed as we approached. \"'Tis a sad business dragging you and yours into this bickering.\"  \"Yet, thanks to Heaven and your aid, my children were saved from the clutches of those rogues.\"  \"Had it not been for me the rascals would not have been here,\" replied Captain Miles apologetically. \"Yet I thank you, sir, for coming to my assistance, though 'tis to the advantage of this part of the countryside that we hide this carrion,\" and he pointed with his finger to the bodies of the two dragoons.  We set to work with a will, and in less than a quarter of an hour a shallow trench was dug sufficiently deep to receive the corpses of the ruffianly soldiers.  \"Egad! 'tis warm work,\" exclaimed my father, leaning on his mattock as the first part of the task was completed.  \"I'm right sorry I've no rum to offer you,\" said Captain Miles, wiping his heated brow. \"You see, we're not aboard the old _Venture_, otherwise 'twould be different.\"  \"I, too, regret that I brought not my flask of cordials,\" replied my father.  \"There is a bottle of strong waters that I found close to the body of one of these villains,\" remarked Jeremy; \"but though I did make three good attempts at it, 'twas more than I could stomach. It smells aright, but the taste--faugh! I have it in my mouth yet. Try it, Captain Hammond, and see if it suit thy palate.\"  So saying, he produced a bottle and handed it to my father, who gave an exclamation of surprise, quickly followed by a hearty laugh.  \"Why, what's amiss?\" asked the astonished Captain, as my father thrust the bottle into his pocket.  \"Hist! I'll tell thee anon,\" said my sire mysteriously. \"Now, let's resume our task.\"  The carcasses of the troopers' horses, the victims of Captain Miles's self-preservation, were next interred; while, to make doubly sure, the mount that Jeremy had borrowed from the Ringwood farmer was also buried.  This done, I happened to cross the highway, where, to my surprise, I found the wrappings of the package for which we had journeyed into Lyndhurst on that eventful morning.  \"See! here is the covering of your packet,\" I exclaimed, holding it up to my father's view.  \"Aye, Clifford, I know it. Say no more on this matter.\"  Inwardly wondering, I obeyed. Whatever the package contained, I now felt certain that 'twas the same stuff as Jeremy Miles had attempted to swallow.  \"Now, look you, Captain Miles,\" said my father, as we prepared to return homewards, \"neither Lymington nor Pitt's Deep offers an asylum for you. To go to either place is to set your head in a trap. I have made up my mind that you must tarry with us at Brockenhurst till this storm has blown over.\"  \"Nay, 'tis unfair to saddle you with the presence of a proclaimed rebel,\" objected Captain Jeremy stoutly. \"The service I rendered your children does not warrant such a generous payment. I'll accept your hospitality for this night, and at sunrise to-morrow I'll make my way into Sussex. I know of an old shipmate at Shoreham who'll gladly set me across to France.\"  \"You'll never get out of Hampshire, my friend,\" interrupted my father; \"at least, not yet awhile. Perchance the tide of monarchy will change again, though, mark you, I'd far rather have James Stuart as my lawful sovereign than James Walters. No, no, I say; further flight is out of the question. At Brockenhurst you will stay till I give you leave to go farther afield.\"  'Twas no light matter to smuggle the fugitive into our home; but we did it, and for the next week or more Captain Miles remained within doors, my father having pointed out to him the secret panel in case of an emergency. This surprised me not a little, for he was usually very reticent about this matter. True, I had been told of the existence of the hiding-place, but even Constance was kept in ignorance of it. The person who contrived the sliding panel must have done his work well, for no one unacquainted with its mechanism could cause it to move. But I've said enough concerning this matter, for although 'tis well known that our home does"]]]
