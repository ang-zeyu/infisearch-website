The names of the cusps and ridges of the teeth (see Figure 2) are those suggested by Wood and Wilson (1936:389-390). Terminology of the enamel grooves and folds is that of Hershkovitz (1944:17) and Hooper (1952b:20-21).  Because secondary sexual variation was not significant (see page 597), both males and females of like age and pelage were used in comparisons of samples designed to reveal geographic variation.  The species are arranged from less to more progressive; the subspecies are arranged alphabetically.  In the synonymy of each subspecies, the plan has been to cite: (1) the name first proposed; (2) the first usage of the name combination employed by me; (3) all other name combinations in chronological order that have been applied to the subspecies concerned.  The localities of specimens examined are listed by country from north to south. Within a country, the listing is by state, beginning with the northwesternmost state and proceeding by tiers (west to east) to the southeasternmost state. Within a state of the United States, the listing is by counties in the same geographic order as described for states. Within any county in the United States, within any state in México, and within any country in Central America, the listing of localities is from north to south. When more than one locality is on the same line of latitude, the westernmost locality is listed first. Marginal localities for each subspecies are listed in a paragraph at the end of each account. Each marginal locality is mapped by means of a circle. The circles are listed in clockwise order, beginning with the northernmost. When more than one of these localities lies on the same line of latitude, the westernmost is cited first. Localities not represented on the distribution maps, so as to avoid undue crowding of symbols, are italicized in the lists of specimens examined.      [Illustration: FIG. 2.

PALEONTOLOGY OF THE GENUS   Five fossil species, all extinct, have been assigned to the genus and range in time from early late Pliocene (Saw Rock Canyon fauna of Hibbard, 1953:408) to Mid-Pleistocene (see Hibbard, 1958:25, who assigns the Curtis Ranch fauna to late Kansan or early Yarmouth).  I examined all known fossil material and compared it with Recent material. When the antiquity of the genus is considered, the degree of difference between the oldest fossil species and the two living species is much less than might be expected.   =Baiomys sawrockensis= Hibbard      _Baiomys sawrockensis_ Hibbard, Papers Mich. Acad. Sci., Arts and        Letters, 38:402, April 27, 1953.  _Type._--No. 27506, Univ. Michigan; left mandibular ramus bearing m1-m3 and incisor; Saw Rock Canyon, early late Pliocene, XI member of the Rexroad formation, sec. 36, T. 34 S, R. 31 W, Seward County, Kansas (University of Kansas, Locality 6).  _Referred material._--Univ. Michigan, Nos. 25781, 27503-27505, 28159-28165, 29708-29715, 31015.  _Diagnosis._--Ramus of medium size to small for the genus; lower incisor broad, moderately recurved; diastemal region broad; anterior median fold between anterior labial conulid and anterior lingual conulid of m1 deep; primary first fold between anteroconulid and protoconid of m2 deep; cingular ridge (ectolophid) at entrance to posteroexternal reëntrant valley (major fold, see Figure 2) between protoconid and hypoconid of m1 and m2; average and extreme measurements of lower molar row of eight specimens are, 2.65 (2.5-2.7).  _Comparisons._--For comparisons with _B. brachygnathus_, see account of that species. From _B. rexroadi_, _B. sawrockensis_ differs in: anterior median fold of m1 deeper; incisor narrower; diastemal region broader; coronoid process broader and better developed; cingular ridges (ectolophids and mesolophids) more pronounced in their development; incisors less proödont, more retrodont.  From _B. kolbi_, _B. sawrockensis_ differs in: crowns of molars narrower; incisors less proödont; cingular ridges (ectolophids and mesolophids) of m1 and m2 more pronounced in their development.  From _B. minimus_, _B. sawrockensis_ differs in: incisor less procumbent; masseteric ridge extending farther anteriorly; anterior cingulum of m2 slightly larger.  From _B. musculus_, _B. sawrockensis_ differs in: over-all size of jaw and molar row less; diastema more acutely curved; incisors shorter; anterior median fold of m1 slightly deeper.  From _B. taylori_, _B. sawrockensis_ differs in: m1 and m2 smaller; cingular ridges in m1 and m2 more pronounced; anterolingual conulid farther forward; incisors shorter, more proödont; molar teeth depressed, less hypsodont; diastemal region broader, more acutely curved; masseteric ridge not extending so far anteriorly.  _Remarks._--_B. sawrockensis_ is the oldest known pygmy mouse. The extreme development of the anterior median fold between the anterolingual conulid and the anterolabial conulid is regarded as a primitive feature in the pygmy mice. In this character, the Recent species can be traced back in time through _B. minimus_ to _B. sawrockensis_. _B. sawrockensis_ resembles _Calomys laucha_ of South America in general conformation of jaw and tooth structure. The molars of _sawrockensis_ are smaller than those of _C. laucha_, and the anterolingual conulid of _sawrockensis_ is farther forward.   =Baiomys rexroadi= Hibbard      _Baiomys rexroadi_ Hibbard, Amer.

From _B. kolbi_, _B. rexroadi_ differs in: over-all size of mandibular ramus, incisors, and molars smaller; anterior median fold of m1 present, though poorly developed.  From _B. brachygnathus_, _B. rexroadi_ differs in: over-all size of mandibular ramus smaller; m3 larger; posterior cusps (hypoconid and entoconid) elongated; diastema shorter, less acutely recurved; incisors less proödont; cingular ridges of m1 and m2 less well-developed.  From _B. musculus_, _B. rexroadi_ differs in: over-all size of mandibular ramus less; cingular ridges of m1 and m2 less well-developed; incisors smaller, more proödont; molars less depressed.  From _B. taylori_, _B. rexroadi_ differs in: m3 more triangular, posterior part narrower; mental foramen closer to anterior root of m1; masseteric ridge closer to alveolus of m1; incisor shorter, more proödont; molars more depressed.  _Remarks._--Two maxillary tooth-rows and associated parts were studied. On one of these specimens, the M2 has a well-developed mesostyle; the anterior median fold of M1 is also well-developed. The other specimen possesses a low cingular ridge (enteroloph) between the protocone and the hypocone, a reduced cingular ridge (mesoloph) between the paracone and metacone of M1. On the second molar, M2, a mesostyle joins with the mesoloph somewhat in the fashion indicated by Hooper (1957:9, encircled number 2).   =Baiomys kolbi= Hibbard      _Baiomys kolbi_ Hibbard, Trans. Kansas Acad. Sci., 55:201, June 18,        1952; Hibbard, Papers Mich. Acad. Sci., Arts and Letters, 38:403,        April 27, 1953.  _Type._--No. 24846, Univ.

From _B. brachygnathus_, _B. kolbi_ differs in: molar row longer; m3 and jaw larger; diastema longer; masseteric ridge not so far forward; molars more depressed.  From _B. minimus_, _B. kolbi_ differs in: molar row longer; m3 larger; jaw larger; diastema not so acutely curved; incisor shorter, narrower transversely, more proödont.  From _B. musculus_, _B. kolbi_ differs in: anterior median fold of m1 slightly developed or absent, instead of well-developed; m3 larger (not reduced), external reëntrant valley broad and extending farther across crown of tooth; incisor smaller, and more proödont; cingular ridges of m1 and m2 less well-developed.  From _B. taylori_, _B. kolbi_ differs in: molars larger, more depressed; incisor shorter, more proödont; m3 smaller relative to m1 and m2; external reëntrant valley of m3 broad, extending farther across crown of tooth.  _Remarks._--The slight development or absence of the anterior median fold in _kolbi_ suggests that it was specialized. The anterior median fold is well-developed in all species of _Baiomys_ save _B. brachygnathus_ and _B. taylori_, in which the fold is only slightly developed or absent. _B. kolbi_ may have paralleled _B. taylori_ in specialization for a diet of grasses and for a life in open country.   =Baiomys brachygnathus= (Gidley)      _Peromyscus brachygnathus_ Gidley, U.

NE Curtis Ranch house, near a line between sec. 28 and 29, T. 18 S, R. 21 E, Mid-Pleistocene (Hibbard, 1958:25), Cochise County, Arizona.  _Referred material._--None.  _Diagnosis._--Ramus small for the genus; m3 reduced; jaw reduced anteroposteriorly; incisor short, slender, proödont; cingular ridges well-developed, posterior ectolophid continuous from protoconid to hypoconid in m1 and m2; diastema short; length of molar row 2.8 mm.  _Comparisons._--For comparisons with _B. rexroadi_ and _B. kolbi_, see accounts of those species. From _B. minimus_, _B. brachygnathus_ differs in: jaw not so slender anteriorly; masseteric ridge not so far anterior; cheek-teeth slightly broader, less depressed, therefore, more hypsodont; incisor shorter, more proödont.  From _B. sawrockensis_, _B. brachygnathus_ differs in: molar row slightly longer; teeth slightly less depressed; masseteric ridge extends farther anteriorly; incisors more proödont.  From _B. musculus_, _B. brachygnathus_ differs in: jaw smaller; molar row slightly shorter; molars less depressed; incisors slender, shorter, narrower, and more proödont.  From _B. taylori_, _B. brachygnathus_ differs in: incisor more slender, shorter, more proödont; diastema shorter.  _Remarks._--The molar teeth of _B. brachygnathus_, although worn, resemble those of _B. taylori_ more than those of any known fossil species. Gidley (1922:124) stated that the absence of the divided anterior lobe of the first molar (anterior median fold) in _brachygnathus_ was one of the chief characters separating _brachygnathus_ from _taylori_. In _taylori_, the anterior median fold characteristically is only slightly developed, and in some specimens is absent. _B. brachygnathus_ differs from _taylori_ chiefly in proödont incisors, which feature seems to preclude _brachygnathus_ being ancestral to _taylori_. _B. brachygnathus_ may have been a specialized divergence from _B. minimus_.   =Baiomys minimus= (Gidley)      _Peromyscus minimus_ Gidley, U.

S Benson, sec. 22, T. 17 S, R. 20 E, Late Pliocene (Blancan, Gazin, 1942:482), Cochise County, Arizona.  _Referred material._--None.  _Diagnosis._--Ramus small for the genus; molar teeth depressed; cingular ridges (ectolophids) of m1 and m2 well-developed; anterior median fold present (appearing larger owing to chip of enamel missing); external reëntrant fold of m3 progresses half way across crown of tooth; diastema short; incisor moderately large, recurved; length of molar row, 2.6 mm.  _Comparisons._--For comparisons with _B. brachygnathus_, _B. kolbi_, and _B. sawrockensis_, see accounts of those species. From _B. rexroadi_, _B. minimus_ differs in: anterior median fold deeper; incisor longer, more recurved, less proödont; molars slightly more depressed (though worn).  From _B. musculus_, _B. minimus_ differs in: over-all size of jaw and molars smaller; incisors shorter; masseteric ridge more depressed.  From _B. taylori_, _B. minimus_ differs in: anterior median fold slightly deeper; molar teeth more depressed; cingular ridges on m1 and m2 better developed; masseteric ridge more depressed.  _Remarks._--Gidley (1922:124) stated that _B. minimus_ differed considerably from _B. taylori_ in that the coronoid portion of the ascending ramus diverges at a wider angle from the alveolar part of the jaw. Study of large samples of lower jaws of _B. taylori_ reveals considerable individual variation in the angle formed between the coronoid part of the jaw and the alveolar part.  _B. minimus_, except for its small size, is like _B. musculus_ and is considered to be ancestral to that species.     PHYLETIC TRENDS   It seems that the important trends in phyletic development in the pygmy mice have been from an ancestral stock (see Figure 3) that possessed relatively brachydont teeth having raised cingular ridges (ectolophids and mesolophids) and relatively short orthodont to proödont incisors, to species having teeth more hypsodont on which cingular ridges were reduced, stylids were isolated or completely absent, and incisors were longer and more recurved or retrodont. _Baiomys sawrockensis_, or an unknown stock resembling it, might have been ancestral to the other known species. Of the four remaining fossil species, _B. kolbi_ seems least likely to have been ancestral to the two living species, owing to its proödont incisors, reduction of cingular ridges, loss of an anterior median fold in m1, and long mandibular tooth-row. _B. kolbi_ may have been an early, specialized derivation from the ancestral stock. From his knowledge of the habitats of _B. musculus_, the larger species, and _B. taylori_, the smaller species, Hibbard (1952:203) suggests that _B. kolbi_, a large species, might have inhabited lowlands, and _B. rexroadi_, a small species, highlands. I have no evidence to dispute this suggestion except that _B. musculus_ has more prominent cingular ridges (or at least vestiges of this lophid condition) than either _B. kolbi_ or _B. rexroadi_. _B. musculus_ (see page 610) is less of an open grassland inhabitant than is _B. taylori_. Therefore, both _B. kolbi_ and _B. rexroadi_, because of their poorly developed cingular ridges, might be expected to have lived in a relatively open grassland habitat.  The relationship of _B. rexroadi_ to fossil species other than _B. kolbi_ is not clear."]]]
