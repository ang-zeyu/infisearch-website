THE \"MORMON\" DOCTRINE OF DEITY.[A]  [Footnote A: A lecture originally delivered before the conference of the Mutual Improvement Associations of the Salt Lake Stake of Zion, August 18, 1901.]    CHAPTER I.  I.  FORM OF GOD.  MY brethren and sisters, there are two things which conjoin to make this conference of the Young Men's and Young Women's Improvement Associations of Salt Lake Stake of Zion an interesting occasion. One is the approaching working season of the Young Men's Associations. They will this winter take up a course of study in \"Mormon\" doctrine--the first principles of the Gospel, or at least, some of those principles; and a large division of the Manual which has been prepared for their use will deal with the subject of the Godhead. For this reason I thought the time opportune to call attention to some of the doctrinal features pertaining to this subject. The Prophet Joseph Smith made this important statement: \"It is the first principle of the Gospel to know for a certainty the character of God;\" then he added something which to some ears is a little offensive--\"and to know that we may converse with him, as one man converses with another.\" On the same occasion, he also said: \"God himself was once as we are now, and is an exalted man, and sits enthroned in yonder heavens.[A]\" Since, then, to know the character of God is one of the first principles of the Gospel, the subject of the Godhead is given a prominent place in the Manual for our Young Men's Associations during the coming season. This is one thing which makes this conference an interesting occasion.  [Footnote A: History of Joseph Smith: _Millennial Star_, Vol. xxiii, p. 246.]  Another thing which contributes to the interest of this conference, and also to this subject of the Godhead, is the attention which of late has been given to what is called the \"Mormon view of God\" by sectarian ministers among us. The interest found expression in a course of lectures during the past few months by one of the prominent ministers of Salt Lake City,[A] and also in a discourse delivered by another minister before the Teachers' association of the Utah Presbytery,[B] in which certain strictures were offered concerning our doctrine of God. It will perhaps be well to read the report of what in substance was said on that occasion by the reverend gentleman who thought proper to take up this subject before that association. I read from the synopsis of his discourse published in one of the morning papers:  [Footnote A: This was Rev. Alfred H. Henry, Pastor First M. B. Church.]  [Footnote B: This was Dr. Paden of the Presbyterian church, August 16, 1901.]       At this point Dr. Paden made his address, first taking up some     of the standard writings on \"Mormon\" doctrine and reading from     them the ideas of God as incorporated in the \"Mormon\" faith. He     read from the Catechism in relation to the Godhead, wherein it is     stated that there are not only more Gods than one, but that God     is a being of parts, with a body like that of a man. He then read     from the Doctrine and Covenants, where it is stated that the words     of the priesthood are the words of God. After calling attention     to the material view of God as set forth in these teachings, the     speaker said that he thought he could see a tendency towards a     more spiritual idea of God among the younger and more enlightened     members of the dominant church, and noticed this in the writings     of Dr. Talmage especially. Referring to the Adam-God idea, the     speaker said that he had not investigated it much, but thought that     the \"Mormon\" Church was ashamed of such an idea. He placed special     stress on the idea that when men attempted to give God a human     form they fashioned him after their own weaknesses and frailties.     A carnal man, he said, had a carnal God, and a spiritual man a     spiritual God. The teaching of a material God, said he, and of a     plurality of Gods, I think is heathenish. The material conception     of God is the crudest possible conception.  I take it that we may classify under three heads the complaints here made against us with reference to the doctrine of Deity.  First, we believe that God is a being with a body in form like man's; that he possesses body, parts and passions; that in a word, God is an exalted, perfected man.  Second, we believe in a plurality of Gods.  Third, we believe that somewhere and some time in the ages to come, through development, through enlargement, through purification until perfection is attained, man at last, may become like God--a God.  I think these three complaints may be said to cover the whole ground of what our reverend critics regard as our error in doctrine on the subject of Deity.  The task before me, on this occasion, is to take this subject and present to you what in reality the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints teaches with reference to the Godhead.  Very naturally, one stands in awe of the subject, so large it is, and so sacred it is. One can only approach it with feelings of reverential awe, and with a deep sense of his own inability to grasp the truth and make it plain to the understandings of men. In the presence of such a task, one feels like invoking the powers divine to aid him in his undertaking; and paraphrasing Milton a little, one could well cry aloud, what in me is dark, illumine; what low, raise and support, that to the height of this great argument I may justify to men the faith we hold of God.  Here let me say that we are dependent upon that which God has been pleased to reveal concerning himself for what we know of him. Today, as in olden times, man cannot by searching find out God.[A] While it is true that in a certain sense the heavens declare his glory, and the firmament showeth his handiwork, and proclaim to some extent his eternal power and Godhead, yet nothing absolutely definite with respect of God may be learned from those works of nature. I will narrow the field still more, and say that such conceptions of God as we entertain must be in harmony with the doctrines of the New Testament on this subject; for accepting as we do, the New Testament as the word of God--at least, as part of it--any modern revelation which we may claim to possess must be in harmony with that revelation. Consequently, on this occasion, all we have to do is to consider the New Testament doctrine with reference to the Godhead. This, I believe, will simplify our task.  [Footnote A: Job ii:7.]  Start we then with the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ. It is to be observed in passing that Jesus himself came with no abstract definition of God. Nowhere in his teachings can you find any argument about the existence of God. That he takes for granted; assumes as true; and from that basis proceeds as a teacher of men. Nay more; he claims God as his Father. It is not necessary to quote texts in proof of this statement; the New Testament is replete with declarations of that character. What may be of more importance for us at the present moment is to call attention to the fact that God himself also acknowledged the relationship which Jesus claimed. Most emphatically did he do so on the memorable occasion of the baptism of Jesus in the river Jordan. You remember how the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45464"],["title","The Mormon Doctrine of Deity: The Roberts-Van Der Donckt Discussion (#2)"],["body","res, according to Matthew, tell us that as Jesus came up out of the water from his baptism, the heavens were opened, and the Spirit of God descended like a dove upon him; and at the same moment, out of the stillness came the voice of God, saying, \"This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.\" On another occasion the Father acknowledges the relationship--at the transfiguration of Jesus in the mount, in the presence of three of his apostles, Peter and James and John, and the angels Moses and Elias. The company was overshadowed by a glorious light, and the voice of God was heard to say of Jesus, \"This is my beloved Son; hear him.\" Of this the apostles in subsequent years testified, and we have on record their testimony. So that the existence of God the Father, and the relationship of Jesus to him, is most clearly shown in these scriptures. But Jesus himself claimed to be the Son of God, and in this connection there is clearly claimed for him divinity, that is to say, Godship. Let me read to you a direct passage upon that subject; it is to be found in the gospel according to St. John, and reads as follows:       In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the     Word was God. * * * And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among     us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the inly begotten of     the Father) full of grace and truth.[A]  [Footnote A: John 1.]  The identity between Jesus of Nazareth--\"the Word made flesh\"--and the \"Word\" that was \"with God from the beginning,\" and that \"was God,\" is so clear that it cannot possibly be doubted. So the Son is God, as well as the Father is God. Other evidences go to establish the fact that Jesus had the Godlike power of creation. In the very passage I have just read, it is said:       All things were made by him [that is, by the Word, who is Jesus];     and without him was not anything made that was made. In him was     life; and the life was the light of men.[A]  [Footnote A: Verses 3, 4.]  One other scripture of like import, but perhaps even more emphatic than the foregoing, is that saying of Paul's in the epistle to the Hebrews:       God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past     unto the fathers by the prophets, hath in these last days spoken     unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by     whom also he made the worlds.[A]  [Footnote A: Heb. 1:1-3.]  Not only one world, but many \"worlds,\" for the word is used in the plural So that we find that the Son of God was God the Father's agent in the work of creation, and that under the Father's direction he created many worlds. There can be no question then as to the divinity, the Godship, of Jesus of Nazareth, since he is not only God the Son, but God the Creator also--of course under the direction of the Father.  Again, the Holy Ghost is spoken of in the scriptures as God. I think, perchance, the clearest verification of that statement is to be found in connection with the circumstance of Ananias and his wife attempting to deceive the apostles with reference to the price for which they had sold a certain parcel of land they owned, which price they proposed putting into the common fund of the Church; but selfishness asserted itself, and they concluded to lie as to the price of the land, and only consecrate a part to the common fund It was an attempt to get credit for a full consecration of what they possessed, on what was a partial dedication of their goods. They proposed to live a lie, and to tell one if necessary to cover the lie they proposed to live. When Ananias stood in the presence of the apostles, Peter put this very pointed question to him: \"Why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost?\" * * * \"Thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God.\"[A] To lie to the Holy Ghost is to lie to God, because the Holy Ghost is God. And frequently in the Scriptures the Holy Spirit is spoken of in this way.  [Footnote A: Acts 5.]  These three, the Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost, it is true, are spoken of in the most definite manner as being God; but the distinction of one from the other is also clearly marked in the scriptures. Take that circumstance to which I have already alluded--the baptism of Jesus. There we may see the three distinct personalities most clearly. The Son coming up out of the water from his baptism; the heavens opening and the Holy Spirit descending upon him; while out of heaven the voice of God is heard saying, \"This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.\" Here three Gods are distinctly apparent. They are seen to be distinct from each other. They appear simultaneously, not as one, but as three, each one doing a different thing, so that however completely they may be one in spirit, in purpose, in will, they are clearly distinct as persons--as individuals.  In several instances in the scriptures these three personages are accorded equal dignity in the Godhead. An example is found in the commission which Jesus gave to his disciples after his resurrection, when he sent them out into the world to preach the gospel to all nations. He stood in the presence of the eleven, and said:       All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye, therefore     and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father,     and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.[A]  [Footnote A: Matt. 28:18-20.]  Each of the three is here given equal dignity in the Godhead. Again, in the apostolic benediction:       May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the     communion of the Holy Ghost be with you all.  In one particular, at least, Jesus came very nearly exalting the Holy Ghost to a seeming superiority over the other personages in the Godhead; for he said:       All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men; but the     blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men.     And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of Man, it shall be     forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it     shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the     world to come.[A]  [Footnote A: Matt. 12:31,32.]  I take it, however, that this seeming superior dignity accorded to the Holy Ghost by the Son of God, is owing to the nature of the third personage in the Trinity, and the kind of testimony he can impart unto the soul of man because of his being a personage of spirit--a testimony that is better than the seeing of the eye, more sure than the hearing of the ear, because it is spirit testifying to spirit--soul communing with soul--it is the soul of God imparting to the soul of man; and if men, after receiving that Witness from God shall blaspheme against him, farewell hope of forgiveness for such a sin, in this world or in the world to come!  These three personages then are of equal dignity in the Godhead, according to the teachings of the New Testament, which teachings, I pray you keep in mind, we most heartily accept.  This simple Christian teaching respecting the Godhead, gave birth to what in ecclesiastical history is called \"The Apostles' Creed.\" A vague tradition hath it that before the Apostles dispersed to go into the world to preach the gospel they formulated a creed with respect of the Church's belief in God. Whether that tradition be true or not, I do not know, and for matter of that, it makes little difference. Suffice it to say that the so-called \"Apostles' Creed,\" for two centuries expressed the faith of the early Christians upon the question of God. It stands as follows:       I believe in God, the Father, Almighty; and in Jesus Christ, his     only Begotten Son, our Lord, who was born of the Virgin Mary by the     Holy Ghost, was crucified under Pontius Pilate, buried, arose from     the dead on the third day, ascended to the heavens, and sits at the     right hand of the Father, whence he will come, to judge the living     and the dead; and in the Holy Ghost.  This was the first formulated Christian creed upon the subject of the Godhead, so far as known; and the ancient saints were content to allow this expression of their belief to excite their reverence without arousing their curiosity as to the nature of God. Happy, perhaps, for this world, certainly it would have contributed to the honor of ecclesiastical history, had this simple formula of the New Testament doctrine respecting God been allowed to stand sufficient until it should please God to raise the curtain yet a little more and give definite revelation with respect of himself and especially of his own nature. But this did not satisfy the so-called Christians at the close of the third and the beginning of the fourth century. By a succession of most bitter and cruel persecutions, the great, strong characters among the Christians by that time had been stricken down; and, as some of our historians record it, only weak and timorous men were left in the church to grapple with the rising power of \"science, falsely so-called.\"[A] For a long time the paganization of the Christian religion had been going on. The men who esteemed themselves to be philosophers must needs corrupt the simple truth of the \"Apostles' Creed\" respecting the three persons of the Godhead, by the false philosophies of the orient, and the idle speculations of the Greeks; until this simple expression of Christian faith in God was changed from what we find it in the \"Apostle's Creed\" to the \"Athanasian Creed,\" and those vain philosophizings and definitions which have grown out of it, and which reduce the dignity of the Godhead to a mere vacuum--to a \"being\" impersonal, incorporeal, without body, without parts, without passions; and I might add also, without sense or reason or any attribute--an absolute nonentity, which they placed in the seat of God, and attempted to confer upon this conception divine powers, clothe it with divine attributes, and give it title, knee and adoration--in a word, divine honors!
