The captain was extremely playful in rejoinders.  'You iron man!' she exclaimed.  'Man of steel would be the better phrase,' her sister whispered.  'It will be an assassination, if it happens.'  'No officer can bear with an open insult, Lena.'  'I shall not sit and see harm done to my old playmate, Anna.'  'Beware of betraying yourself for one who detests you.'  A grand duo between Montini and Vittoria silenced all converse.  Camilla tells Camillo of her dream.  He pledges his oath to discover her mother, if alive; if dead, to avenge her.  Camilla says she believes her mother is in the dungeons of Count Orso's castle.  The duo tasked Vittoria's execution of florid passages; it gave evidence of her sound artistic powers.  'I was a fool,' thought Antonio-Pericles; 'I flung my bouquet with the herd.  I was a fool!  I lost my head!'  He tapped angrily at the little ink-flask in his coat-pocket.  The first act, after scenes between false Camillo and Michiella, ends with the marriage of Camillo and Camilla;--a quatuor composed of Montini, Vittoria, Irma, and Lebruno.  Michiella is in despair; Count Orso is profoundly sonorous with paternity and devotion to the law.  He has restored to Camilla a portion of her mother's sequestrated estates. A portion of the remainder will be handed over to her when he has had experience of her husband's good behaviour.  The rest he considers legally his own by right of (Treaties), and by right of possession and documents his sword.  Yonder castle he must keep.  It is the key of all his other territories.  Without it, his position will be insecure. (Allusion to the Austrian argument that the plains of Lombardy are the strategic defensive lines of the Alps.)  Agostino, pursued by his terror of anticlimax, ran from the sight of Vittoria when she was called, after the fall of the curtain.  He made his way to Rocco Ricci (who had given his bow to the public from his perch), and found the maestro drinking Asti to counteract his natural excitement. Rocco told Agostino, that up to the last moment, neither he nor any soul behind the scenes knew Vittoria would be able to appear, except that she had sent a note to him with a pledge to be in readiness for the call. Irma had come flying in late, enraged, and in disorder, praying to take Camilla's part; but Montini refused to act with the seconda donna as prima donna.  They had commenced the opera in uncertainty whether it could go on beyond the situation where Camilla presents herself.  'I was prepared to throw up my baton,' said Rocco, 'and publicly to charge the Government with the rape of our prima donna.  Irma I was ready to replace.  I could have filled that gap.' He spoke of Vittoria's triumph. Agostino's face darkened.  'Ha!' said he, 'provided we don't fall flat, like your Asti with the cork out.  I should have preferred an enthusiasm a trifle more progressive.  The notion of travelling backwards is upon me forcibly, after that tempest of acclamation.'  'Or do you think that you have put your best poetry in the first Act?' Rocco suggested with malice.  'Not a bit of it!' Agostino repudiated the idea very angrily, and puffed and puffed.  Yet he said, 'I should not be lamenting if the opera were stopped at once.'  'No!' cried Rocco; 'let us have our one night.  I bargain for that. Medole has played us false, but we go on.  We are victims already, my Agostino.'  'But I do stipulate,' said Agostino, 'that my jewel is not to melt herself in the cup to-night.  I must see her.  As it is, she is inevitably down in the list for a week's or a month's incarceration.'  Antonio-Pericles had this, in his case, singular piece of delicacy, that he refrained from the attempt to see Vittoria immediately after he had flung his magnificent bouquet of treasure at her feet.  In his intoxication with the success which he had foreseen and cradled to its apogee, he was now reckless of any consequences.  He felt ready to take patriotic Italy in his arms, provided that it would succeed as Vittoria had done, and on the spot.  Her singing of the severe phrases of the opening chant, or hymn, had turned the man, and for a time had put a new heart in him.  The consolation was his also, that he had rewarded it the most splendidly--as it were, in golden italics of praise; so that her forgiveness of his disinterested endeavour to transplant her was certain, and perhaps her future implicit obedience or allegiance bought.  Meeting General Pierson, the latter rallied him.  'Why, my fine Pericles, your scheme to get this girl out of the way was capitally concerted.  My only fear is that on another occasion the Government will take another view of it and you.'  Pericles shrugged.  'The Gods, my dear General, decree.  I did my best to lay a case before them; that is all.'  'Ah, well!  I am of opinion you will not lay many other cases before the Gods who rule in Milan.'  'I have helped them to a good opera.'  'Are you aware that this opera consists entirely of political allusions?'  General Pierson spoke offensively, as the urbane Austrian military permitted themselves to do upon occasion when addressing the conquered or civilians.  'To me,' returned Pericles, 'an opera--it is music.  I know no more.'  'You are responsible for it,' said the General, harshly.  'It was taken upon trust from you.'  'Brutal Austrians!' Pericles murmured.  'And you do not think much of her voice, General?'  'Pretty fair, sir.'  'What wonder she does not care to open her throat to these swine!' thought the changed Greek.  Vittoria's door was shut to Agostino.  No voice within gave answer.  He tried the lock of the door, and departed.  She sat in a stupor.  It was harder for her to make a second appearance than it was to make the first, when the shameful suspicion cruelly attached to her had helped to balance her steps with rebellious pride; and more, the great collected wave of her ambitious years of girlhood had cast her forward to the spot, as in a last effort for consummation.  Now that she had won the public voice (love, her heart called it) her eyes looked inward; she meditated upon what she had to do, and coughed nervously.  She frightened herself with her coughing, and shivered at the prospect of again going forward in the great nakedness of stagelights and thirsting eyes.  And, moreover, she was not strengthened by the character of the music and the poetry of the second Act:--a knowledge of its somewhat inferior quality may possibly have been at the root of Agostino's dread of an anticlimax.  The seconda donna had the chief part in it--notably an aria (Rocco had given it to her in compassion) that suited Irma's pure shrieks and the tragic skeleton she could be.  Vittoria knew how low she was sinking when she found her soul in the shallows of a sort of jealousy of Irma.  For a little space she lost all intimacy with herself; she looked at her face in the glass and swallowed water, thinking that she had strained a dream and confused her brain with it.  The silence of her solitary room coming upon the blaze of light the colour and clamour of the house, and the strange remembrance of the recent impersonation of an ideal character, smote her with the sense of her having fallen from a mighty eminence, and that she lay in the dust.  All those incense-breathing flowers heaped on her table seemed poisonous, and reproached her as a delusion.  She sat crouching alone till her tirewomen called; horrible talkative things! her own familiar maid Giacinta being the worst to bear with.  Now, Michiella, by making love to Leonardo, Camillo's associate, discovers that Camillo is conspiring against her father.  She utters to Leonardo very pleasant promises indeed, if he will betray his friend. Leonardo, a wavering baritono, complains that love should ask for any return save in the coin of the empire of love.  He is seduced, and invokes a malediction upon his head should he accomplish what he has sworn to perform.  Camilla reposes perfect confidence in this wretch, and brings her more doubtful husband to be of her mind.  Camillo and Camilla agree to wear the mask of a dissipated couple. They throw their mansion open; dicing, betting, intriguing, revellings, maskings, commence.  Michiella is courted ardently by Camillo; Camilla trifles with Leonardo and with Count Orso alternately.  Jealous again of Camilla, Michiella warns and threatens Leonardo; but she becomes Camillo's dupe, partly from returning love, partly from desire for vengeance on her rival.  Camilla persuades Orso to discard Michiella. The infatuated count waxes as the personification of portentous burlesque; he is having everything his own way.  The acting throughout-- owing to the real gravity of the vast basso Lebruno's burlesque, and Vittoria's archness--was that of high comedy with a lurid background. Vittoria showed an enchanting spirit of humour.  She sang one bewitching barcarole that set the house in rocking motion.  There was such melancholy in her heart that she cast herself into all the flippancy with abandonment.  The Act was weak in too distinctly revealing the finger of the poetic political squib at a point here and there.  The temptation to do it of an Agostino, who had no other outlet, had been irresistible, and he sat moaning over his artistic depravity, now that it stared him in the face.  Applause scarcely consoled him, and it was with humiliation of mind that he acknowledged his debt to the music and the singers, and how little they owed to him.  Now Camillo is pleased to receive the ardent passion of his wife, and the masking suits his taste, but it is the vice of his character that he cannot act to any degree subordinately in concert; he insists upon positive headship!--(allusion to an Italian weakness for sovereignties; it passed unobserved, and chuckled bitterly over his excess of subtlety). Camillo cannot leave the scheming to her.  He pursues Michiella "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4438"],["title","Vittoria — Volume 4 (#2)"],["body","subdue her with blandishments.  Reproaches cease upon her part.  There is a duo between them.  They exchange the silver keys, which express absolute intimacy, and give mutual freedom of access.  Camillo can now secrete his followers in the castle; Michiella can enter Camilla's blue-room, and ravage her caskets for treasonable correspondence.  Artfully she bids him reflect on what she is forfeiting for him; and so helps him to put aside the thought of that which he also may be imperilling.  Irma's shrill crescendos and octave-leaps, assisted by her peculiar attitudes of strangulation, came out well in this scene.  The murmurs concerning the sour privileges to be granted by a Lazzeruola were inaudible.  But there has been a witness to the stipulation.  The ever- shifting baritono, from behind a pillar, has joined in with an aside phrase here and there.  Leonardo discovers that his fealty to Camilla is reviving.  He determines to watch over her.  Camillo now tosses a perfumed handkerchief under his nose, and inhales the coxcombical incense of the idea that he will do all without Camilla's aid, to surprise her; thereby teaching her to know him to be somewhat a hero.  She has played her part so thoroughly that he can choose to fancy her a giddy person; he remarks upon the frequent instances of girls who in their girlhood were wild dreamers becoming after marriage wild wives.  His followers assemble, that he may take advantage of the exchanged key of silver. He is moved to seek one embrace of Camilla before the conflict:--she is beautiful!  There was never such beauty as hers!  He goes to her in the fittest preparation for the pangs of jealousy.  But he has not been foremost in practising the uses of silver keys.  Michiella, having first arranged with her father to be before Camillo's doors at a certain hour with men-at-arms, is in Camilla's private chamber, with her hand upon a pregnant box of ebony wood, when she is startled by a noise, and slips into concealment.  Leonardo bursts through the casement window.  Camilla then appears.  Leonardo stretches the tips of his fingers out to her; on his knees confesses his guilt and warns her.  Camillo comes in. Thrusting herself before him, Michiella points to the stricken couple 'See! it is to show you this that I am here.'  Behold occasion for a grand quatuor!  While confessing his guilt to Camilla, Leonardo has excused it by an emphatic delineation of Michiella's magic sway over him.  (Leonardo, in fact, is your small modern Italian Machiavelli, overmatched in cunning, for the reason that he is always at a last moment the victim of his poor bit of heart or honesty: he is devoid of the inspiration of great patriotic aims.) If Michiella (Austrian intrigue) has any love, it is for such a tool.  She cannot afford to lose him.  She pleads for him; and, as Camilla is silent on his account, the cynical magnanimity of Camillo is predisposed to spare a fangless snake.  Michiella withdraws him from the naked sword to the back of the stage.  The terrible repudiation scene ensues, in which Camillo casts off his wife.  If it was a puzzle to one Italian half of the audience, the other comprehended it perfectly, and with rapture.  It was thus that YOUNG ITALY had too often been treated by the compromising, merely discontented, dallying aristocracy.  Camilla cries to him, 'Have faith in me!  have faith in me!  have faith in me!' That is the sole answer to his accusations, his threats of eternal loathing, and generally blustering sublimities.  She cannot defend herself; she only knows her innocence.  He is inexorable, being the guilty one of the two.  Turning from him with crossed arms, Camilla sings:  'Mother!  it is my fate that I should know Thy miseries, and in thy footprints go. Grief treads the starry places of the earth: In thy long track I feel who gave me birth. I am alone; a wife without a lord; My home is with the stranger--home abhorr'd!-- But that I trust to meet thy spirit there. Mother of Sorrows! joy thou canst not share: So let me wander in among the tombs, Among the cypresses and the withered blooms. Thy soul is with dead suns: there let me be; A silent thing that shares thy veil with thee.'  The wonderful viol-like trembling of the contralto tones thrilled through the house.  It was the highest homage to Vittoria that no longer any shouts arose nothing but a prolonged murmur, as when one tells another a tale of deep emotion, and all exclamations, all ulterior thoughts, all gathered tenderness of sensibility, are reserved for the close, are seen heaping for the close, like waters above a dam.  The flattery of beholding a great assembly of human creatures bound glittering in wizard subservience to the voice of one soul, belongs to the artist, and is the cantatrice's glory, pre-eminent over whatever poor glory this world gives.  She felt it, but she felt it as something apart.  Within her was the struggle of Italy calling to Italy: Italy's shame, her sadness, her tortures, her quenchless hope, and the view of Freedom.  It sent her blood about her body in rebellious volumes.  Once it completely strangled her notes.  She dropped the ball of her chin in her throat; paused without ceremony; and recovered herself.  Vittoria had too severe an artistic instinct to court reality; and as much as she could she from that moment corrected the underlinings of Agostino's libretto.  On the other hand, Irma fell into all his traps, and painted her Austrian heart with a prodigal waste of colour and frank energy:                     'Now Leonardo is my tool:                     Camilla is my slave:                     And she I hate goes forth to cool                     Her rage beyond the wave.                                     Joy! joy!           Paid am I in full coin for my caressing;           I take, but give nought, ere the priestly blessing.'  A subtle distinction.  She insists upon her reverence for the priestly (papistical) blessing, while she confides her determination to have it dispensed with in Camilla's case.  Irma's known sympathies with the Austrian uniform seasoned the ludicrousness of many of the double-edged verses which she sang or declaimed in recitative.  The irony of applauding her vehemently was irresistible.  Camilla is charged with conspiracy, and proved guilty by her own admission.  The Act ends with the entry of Count Orso and his force; conspirators overawed; Camilla repudiated; Count Orso imperially just; Leonardo chagrined; Camillo pardoned; Michiella triumphant.  Camillo sacrifices his wife for safety.  He holds her estates; and therefore Count Orso, whose respect for law causes him to have a keen eye for matrimonial alliances, is now paternally willing, and even anxious to bestow Michiella upon him when the Pontifical divorce can be obtained; so that the long-coveted fruitful acres may be in the family.  The chorus sings a song of praise to Hymen, the 'builder of great Houses.' Camilla goes forth into exile.  The word was not spoken, but the mention of 'bread of strangers, strange faces, cold climes,' said sufficient.  'It is a question whether we ought to sit still and see a firebrand flashed in our faces,' General Pierson remarked as the curtain fell.  He was talking to Major de Pyrmont outside the Duchess of Graatli's box. Two General officers joined them, and presently Count Serabiglione, with his courtly semi-ironical smile, on whom they straightway turned their backs.  The insult was happily unseen, and the count caressed his shaven chin and smiled himself onward.  The point for the officers to decide was, whether they dared offend an enthusiastic house--the fiery core of the population of Milan--by putting a stop to the opera before worse should come.  Their own views were entirely military; but they were paralyzed by the recent pseudo-liberalistic despatches from Vienna; and agreed, with some malice in their shrugs, that the odium might as well be left on the shoulders of the bureau which had examined the libretto.  In fact, they saw that there would be rank peril in attempting to arrest the course of things within the walls of the house.  'The temper this people is changeing oddly,' said General Pierson.  Major de Pyrmont listened awhile to what they had to say, and returned to the duchess.  Amalia wrote these lines to Laura:--  'If she sings that song she is to be seized on the wings of the stage. I order my carriage to be in readiness to take her whither she should have gone last night.  Do you contrive only her escape from the house. Georges de P. will aid you.  I adore the naughty rebel!'  Major de Pyrmont delivered the missive at Laura's box.  He went down to the duchess's chasseur, and gave him certain commands and money for a journey.  Looking about, he beheld Wilfrid, who implored him to take his place for two minutes.  De Pyrmont laughed.  'She is superb, my friend. Come up with me.  I am going behind the scenes.  The unfortunate impresario is a ruined man; let us both condole with him.  It is possible that he has children, and children like bread.'  Wilfrid was linking his arm to De Pyrmont's, when, with a vivid recollection of old times, he glanced at his uniform with Vittoria's eyes.  'She would spit at me!' he muttered, and dropped behind.  Up in her room Vittoria held council with Rocco, Agostino, and the impresario, Salvolo, who was partly their dupe.  Salvolo had laid a freshly-written injunction from General Pierson before her, bidding him to exclude the chief solo parts from the Third Act, and to bring it speedily to a termination.  His case was, that he had been ready to forfeit much if a rising followed; but that simply to beard the authorities was madness.  He stated his case by no means as a pleader, although the impression made on him by the prima donna's success caused his urgency to be civil.  'Strike out what you please,' said Vittoria.  Agostino smote her with a forefinger.  'Rogue!  you deserve an imperial"]]]
