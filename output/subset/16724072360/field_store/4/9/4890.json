Faust, aided by Mephistopheles, obtains access to her cell and urges her to fly with him; but her poor mind cannot grasp the situation, and recurs only to the scenes of their love. When she sees Faust's companion, she turns from him in horror, falls upon her knees, and implores the mercy of heaven. As she sinks in death, Mephistopheles pronounces her damned, but a heavenly voice proclaims her pardoned; and while a celestial choir chants the Easter hymn the soul of Marguerite is seen borne up to heaven by angels. Faust falls to his knees, and the devil crouches beneath the shining sword of an archangel.  First performed at the Théâtre Lyrique, Paris, March 19, 1859, with the following cast:    LE DOCTEUR FAUST                _MM. Barbot_   MÉPHISTOPHÉLÈS                    _Balanqué_   VALENTIN                           _Reynald_   WAGNER                               _Cibot_   MARGUERITE           _Mmes.

He is seated at a table covered with books and parchments; an open book lies before him. His lamp is flickering in the socket.)  _Faust._ No! In vain hath my soul aspired, with ardent longing,          All to know,--all in earth and heaven.          No light illumines the visions, ever thronging          My brain; no peace is given,          And I linger, thus sad and weary,          Without power to sunder the chain          Binding my soul to life always dreary.          Nought do I see! Nought do I know!     (He closes the book and rises. Day begins to dawn.)           Again 'tis light!          On its westward course flying,          The somber night vanishes.                     (Despairingly.)          Again the light of a new day!          O death! when will thy dusky wings          Above me hover and give me--rest?                  (Seizing a flask on the table.)          Well, then! Since death thus evades me,          Why should I not go in search of him?          Hail, my final day, all hail!          No fears my heart assail;          On earth my days I number;          For this draught immortal slumber          Will secure me, and care dispel!      (Pours liquid from the flask into a crystal goblet. Just as he is about to raise it to his lips, the following chorus is heard, without.)  _Cho. of Maidens._ Why thy eyes so lustrous          Hidest thou from sight?          Bright Sol now is scatt'ring          Beams of golden light;          The nightingale is warbling          Its carol of love;          Rosy tints of morning          Now gleam from above;          Flow'rs unfold their beauty          To the scented gale;          Nature all awakens--          Of love tells its tale.  _Faust._ Hence, empty sounds of human joys          Flee far from me.          O goblet, which my ancestors          So many times have filled,          Why tremblest thou in my grasp?               (Again raising the goblet to his lips.) _Cho. of Laborers_                     (without).          The morn into the fields doth summon us,          The swallow hastes away!          Why tarry, then?          To labor let's away! to work let's on,          The sky is bright, the earth is fair,          Our tribute, then, let's pay to heav'n.  _Cho. of Maidens and Laborers._          Praises to God!  _Faust._ God! God!               (He sinks into a chair.)          But this God, what will he do for me?                       (Rising.)          Will he return to me youth, love, and faith?                     (With rage.)          Cursed be all of man's vile race!          Cursed be the chains which bind him in his place!          Cursed be visions false, deceiving!          Cursed the folly of believing!          Cursed be dreams of love or hate!          Cursed be souls with joy elate.          Cursed be science, prayer, and faith!          Cursed my fate in life and death!               Infernal king, arise!              *       *       *       *       *   SCENE II.  FAUST AND MEPHISTOPHELES.  _Mep._                (suddenly appearing).          Here am I! So, I surprise you?          SATAN, Sir, at your service!          A sword at my side; on my hat a gay feather;--          A cloak o'er my shoulder; and altogether,          Why, gotten up quite in the fashion!                      (Briskly.)          But come, Doctor Faust, what is your will?          Behold! Speak! Are you afraid of me?  _Faust._ No.  _Mep._   Do you doubt my power?  _Faust._ Perhaps.  _Mep._   Prove it, then.  _Faust._ Begone!  _Mep._   Fie! Fie! Is this your politeness!          But learn, my friend, that with Satan          One should conduct in a different way.          I've entered your door with infinite trouble.          Would you kick me out the very same day?  _Faust._ Then what will you do for me?  _Mep._   Anything in the world! All things. But          Say first what you would have.          Abundance of gold?  _Faust._ And what can I do with riches?  _Mep._   Good. I see where the shoe pinches.          You will have glory.  _Faust._ Still wrong.  _Mep._   Power, then.  _Faust._ No. I would have a treasure          Which contains all. I wish for youth.          Oh! I would have pleasure,          And love, and caresses,          For youth is the season          When joy most impresses.          One round of enjoyment,          One scene of delight,          Should be my employment          From day-dawn till night.          Oh, I would have pleasure,          And love, and caresses;          If youth you restore me,          My joys I'll renew!  _Mep._   'Tis well--all thou desirest I can give thee.  _Faust._ Ah! but what must I give in return?  _Mep._   'Tis but little:          In this world I will be thy slave,          But down below thou must be mine.  _Faust._ Below!  _Mep._   Below.                   (Unfolding a scroll.)          Come, write. What! does thy hand tremble?          Whence this dire trepidation?          'Tis youth that now awaits thee--Behold!  (At a sign from MEPHISTOPHELES, the scene opens and discloses MARGUERITE, spinning.)  _Faust._ Oh, wonder!  _Mep._   Well, how do you like it?                  (Taking parchment.) _Faust._ Give me the scroll!                      (Signs.) _Mep._   Come on then! And now, master,                   (Taking cup from the table.)          I invite thee to empty a cup,          In which there is neither poison nor death,          But young and vigorous life.  _Faust._                (Taking cup and turning toward Marguerite.)          O beautiful, adorable vision! I drink to thee!      (He drinks the contents of the cup, and is transformed   into a young and handsome man. The vision disappears.)  _Mep._   Come, then.  _Faust._ Say, shall I again behold her?  _Mep._   Most surely!  _Faust._ When?  _Mep._   This very day!  _Faust._ 'Tis well.  _Mep._   Then let's away.  _Both._  'Tis pleasure I covet,          'Tis beauty I crave;          I sigh for its kisses,          Its love I demand!          With ardor unwonted          I long now to burn;          I sigh for the rapture          Of heart and of sense.                 (Exeunt. The curtain falls.)     ACT II.   SCENE I.  _The Kermesse._    (One of the city gates. To the left, an Inn,     bearing the sign of the god Bacchus.)    WAGNER, Students, Burghers, Soldiers, Maidens, and Matrons.  _Studs._ Wine or beer, now, which you will!          So the glass quick you fill!          And replenish at our need:          At our bouts we drink with speed!  _Wag._   Now, young tipplers at the cask,          Don't refuse what I ask--          Drink to glory! drink to love!          Drain the sparkling glass!  _Studs._ We young tipplers at the cask          Won't refuse what you ask--          Here's to glory! here's to love!          Drain the sparkling glass!                    (They drink.)  _Soldiers._ Castles, hearts, or fortresses,               Are to us all one.             Strong towers, maids with fair tresses,               By the brave are won;             He, who hath the art to take them,               Shows no little skill;             He, who knows the way to keep them,               Hath more wisdom still.  _Citizens._ On holy-days and feast-days,          I love to talk of war and battles.          While the toiling crowds around          Worry their brains with affairs,          I stroll calmly to this retreat          On the banks of the gliding river,          And behold the boats which pass          While I leisurely empty my glass.               (Citizens and soldiers go to back of stage.)              (A group of young girls enters.)  _Girls._ Merry fellows come this way,          Yes, they now advance;          Let us, then, our steps delay,          Just to take one glance.         (They go to right of stage.         A second chorus of students enters after them.)  _Studs._ Sprightly maidens now advance,          Watch their conquering airs;          Friends be guarded, lest a glance          Take you unawares.  _Matrons._              (watching the students and young girls).          Behold the silly damsels,          And the foolish young men;          We were once as young as they are,          And as pretty again.    (All join in the following chorus, each singing as follows.)  _Mats._         (to the Maidens).             Ye strive hard to please,             Your object is plain.  _Studs._    Beer or wine, wine or beer,             Nought care I, with heart of cheer.  _Soldiers._ On, then, let's on;             Brave soldiers are we,             To conquest we'll on.  _Citizens._ Come, neighbor! In this fine weather             Let us empty a bottle together!  _Maidens._  They wish to please us, but 'tis in vain!

WAGNER, SIEBEL, VALENTINE, Students, and afterwards MEPHISTOPHELES.  _Val._    (advancing from the back of the stage and holding in his hand   a small silver medal).          O sacred medallion,            Gift of my sister dear            To ward off danger and fear,          As I charge with my brave battalion,            Rest thou upon my heart.  _Wag._   Here comes Valentine, in search of us, doubtless.  _Val._   Let us drain the parting cup, comrades,          It is time we were on the road.  _Wag._   What sayst thou?          Why this sorrowful farewell?  _Val._   Like you, I soon must quit these scenes,          Leaving behind me Marguerite.          Alas! my mother no longer lives,          To care for and protect her.  _Sie._   More than one friend hast thou          Who faithfully will thy place supply.  _Val._   My thanks!  _Sie._   On me you may rely.  _Stud._  In us thou surely mayst confide.  _Val._   Even bravest heart may swell          In the moment of farewell.          Loving smile of sister kind,          Quiet home I leave behind.          Oft shall I think of you          Whene'er the wine-cup passes round,          When alone my watch I keep.          But when danger to glory shall call me,          I still will be first in the fray,          As blithe as a knight in his bridal array.          Careless what fate shall befall me          When glory shall call me.  _Wag._   Come on, friends! No tears nor vain alarms;          Quaff we good wine, to the success of our arms!          Drink, boys, drink!          In a joyous refrain          Bid farewell, till we meet again.  _Cho._   We'll drink! Fill high!          Once more in song our voices          Let us raise.  _Wag._              (mounting on a table).          A rat, more coward than brave,            And with an exceedingly ugly head,          Lodged in a sort of hole or cave,            Under an ancient hogshead.

Good sir!  _Wag._   What!  _Mep._   If it so please ye I should wish          To mingle with ye a short time.          If your good friend will kindly end his song,          I'll tell ye a few things well worth the hearing.  _Wag._   One will suffice, but let that one be good.  _Mep._   My utmost I will do          Your worships not to bore.                          I.          Calf of Gold! aye in all the world          To your mightiness they proffer,          Incense at your fane they offer          From end to end of all the world.          And in honor of the idol          Kings and peoples everywhere          To the sound of jingling coins          Dance with zeal in festive circle,          Round about the pedestal.          Satan, he conducts the ball.                          II.          Calf of Gold, strongest god below!          To his temple overflowing          Crowds before his vile shape bowing,          The monster dares insult the skies.          With contempt he views around him          All the vaunted human race,          As they strive in abject toil,          As with souls debased they circle          Round about the pedestal.          Satan, he conducts the ball.  _All._   Satan, he conducts the ball.  _Cho._   A strange story this of thine.  _Val._                  (aside).          And stranger still is he who sings it.  _Wag._           (offering a cup to MEPHISTOPHELES).          Will you honor us by partaking of wine?  _Mep._   With pleasure. Ah!       (Taking WAGNER by the hand, and scrutinizing his palm.)          Behold what saddens me to view.          See you this line?  _Wag._   Well!  _Mep._   A sudden death it presages,--          You will be killed in mounting to th' assault!  _Sie._   You are then a sorcerer!  _Mep._   Even so. And your own hand shows plainly          To what fate condemns. What flower you would gather          Shall wither in the grasp.  _Sie._   I?  _Mep._   No more bouquets for Marguerite.  _Val._   My sister! How knew you her name?  _Mep._   Take care, my brave fellow!          Some one I know is destined to kill you.                  (Taking the cup.)          Your health, gentlemen!          Pah! What miserable wine!          Allow me to offer you some from my cellar?         (Jumps on the table, and strikes on a little cask,          surmounted by the effigy of the god Bacchus,          which serves as a sign to the Inn.)           What ho! thou god of wine, now give us drink!           (Wine gushes forth from cask, and            MEPHISTOPHELES fills his goblet.)          Approach, my friends!          Each one shall be served to his liking.          To your health, now and hereafter!          To Marguerite!  _Val._   Enough! If I do not silence him,          And that instantly, I will die.              (The wine bursts into flame.)  _Wag._   Hola!  _Cho._   Hola!              (They draw their swords.) _Mep._   Ah, ha! Why do you tremble so, you who menace me?         (He draws a circle around him with his sword.            VALENTINE attacks; his sword is broken.)  _Val._   My sword, O amazement!          Is broken asunder.  _All_     (forcing MEPHISTOPHELES to retire by holding toward him the        cross-shaped handles of their swords).           Gainst the powers of evil our arms assailing,          Strongest earthly might is unavailing.          But thou canst not charm us,          Look hither!          While this blest sign we wear          Thou canst not harm us.                     (Exeunt.)              *       *       *       *       *   SCENE IV.

Why, what has happened?  _Mep._   Oh, nothing! let us change the subject!          Say, Doctor, what would you of me?          With what shall we begin?  _Faust._ Where bides the beauteous maid          Thine art did show to me?          Or was't mere witchcraft?  _Mep._   No, but her virtue doth protect her from thee,          And heaven itself would keep her pure.  _Faust._ It matters not!          Come, lead me to her,          Or I straightway abandon thee.  _Mep._   Then I'll comply! 'twere pity you should think          So meanly of the magic power which I possess.          Have patience! and to this joyous tune.          Right sure am I, the maiden will appear.              *       *       *       *       *   SCENE V.      (Students, with Maidens on their arms, preceded by Musicians,   take possession of the stage. Burghers in the rear,   as at the commencement of the act.)    Students, Maidens, Burghers, etc., afterwards SIEBEL and MARGUERITE.  _Cho._              (marking waltz time with their feet).          As the wind that sportively plays,          At first will light dust only raise,          Yet, at last, becomes a gale,          So our dancing and our singing,          Soft at first, then loudly ringing,          Will resound o'er hill and dale.     (The Musicians mount upon the table, and dancing begins.)  _Mep._                 (to FAUST).          See those lovely young maidens.          Will you not ask of them          To accept you?  _Faust._ No! desist from thy idle sport,          And leave my heart free to reflection.  _Sie._                     (entering).          Marguerite this way alone can arrive.  _Some of the Maidens_                (approaching SIEBEL).          Pray seek you a partner to join in the dance?  _Sie._   No: it has no charm for me.  _Cho._   As the wind that sportively plays,          At first will light dust only raise,          Yet, at last, becomes a gale,          So our dancing and our singing,          Soft at first, then loudly ringing,          Will resound o'er hill and dale.                    (MARGUERITE enters.) _Faust._ It is she! behold her!  _Mep._   'Tis well! now, then, approach!  _Sie._            (perceiving MARGUERITE and approaching her).          Marguerite!  _Mep._       (turning round and finding himself face to face with SIEBEL).          What say you?  _Sie._                     (aside).          Malediction! here again!  _Mep._                     (coaxingly).          What, here again, dear boy?                     (laughing).          Ha, ha! a right good jest!
