Paul Alexander Bartlett’s fiction has been commended by many authors, among them Pearl Buck, Ford Madox Ford, John Dos Passos, James Michener, Upton Sinclair, Evelyn Eaton, and many others. He was the recipient of numerous grants, awards, and fellowships, from such organizations as the Leopold Schepp Foundation, the Edward MacDowell Association, the New School for Social Research, the Huntington Hartford Foundation, the Montalvo Foundation, Yaddo, and the Carnegie Foundation. His novel _When the Owl Cries_ received national acclaim; his fine art has been exhibited throughout the United States and in Mexico; his poetry has appeared in numerous literary journals and anthologies and has been published in individual volumes of his collected poetry. Bartlett was very prolific and left to the archives of his work many as yet unpublished manuscripts, including poetry, short stories, and novels, as well as more than a thousand paintings and illustrations.  His wife, Elizabeth Bartlett, a widely published and internationally recognized poet, is the author of seventeen published books of poetry, more than one thousand individually published poems, numerous short stories and essays in leading literary quarterlies and anthologies, and, as the founder of Literary Olympics, Inc., served as the editor of a series of multi-language volumes of international poetry to honor the work of outstanding contemporary poets.  The author of this Introduction (Paul and Elizabeth Bartlett’s only child)]  apparently inherited their writer’s gene and has published books and articles in the fields of philosophy and psychology.               *      *      *      *      *      *      *      *                              *Forward, Children!*                                  *PORTRAIT*   Orville Dennison was five feet eleven inches tall and weighed a hundred and fifty pounds.  He had the body of an athlete, the body of a crewman and a tennis player.  His eyes were brown with flecks of grey in them.  He had brown hair and combed it straight back and when it was long it bulged out on the sides and had waves that crossed from ear to ear, waves that were sun bleached on the top.  His nose was aquiline, his mouth was thin-lipped and rather small.  He had large ears.  His eyebrows were bushy and his lashes were long and thick.  His forehead was broad but was not unusual except that it was very smooth while the skin of his face, which was rather florid, had enlarged pores here and there.  His hands were wide across the back and his fingers were strong; his shoulders and arms were muscular.  He walked quickly with a natural swing.  He had a ready smile and even teeth.  His voice was pleasant.  He was twenty-four.  One was struck by the sadness in his face, the careworn lines about his mouth and eyes.                                       *1*   Landel shook Dennison’s shoulder.  \"Whatcha want?\" Dennison mumbled, raising himself on one elbow and unconsciously pushing aside his blanket.  \"The supply trucks have come,\" Landel yelled.  \"Who’s come?\"  \"The trucks and tanks are here.  Three trucks have brought supplies. We’ve got food.  Are you awake?  Hey, do you hear me?\"  \"What did you say?  Sure, sure, I’m awake,\" Dennison replied hazily.  He squinted and ducked as Landel shot the beam of his flashlight directly into his face.  Landel knelt down beside Dennison and fumbled about the floor of the abandoned plank and sandbag irrigation shack for his tank helmet.  His tall body almost filled the place.  His bald head looked repulsively bald to Dennison--something surgical.  \"I let ya sleep a little longer than the other guys,\" Landel yelled. \"Yeah, you needed sleep.\"  He shifted his flashlight around the crude shack, over the mounds of blankets where their crewmates had been sleeping.  \"Our kitchen’s here!  The trucks are here ... three of them,\" he repeated.  \"We’ve got something hot to eat,\" he hollered.  \"Are you awake?\"  He pushed Dennison--shoved him against the floor. \"Come on, get out of here!\"  \"What time is it?\" Dennison asked.  \"Nearly fifteen ... we’ve got to get moving,\" Landel crabbed. He found his helmet underneath a sandy, greasy blanket and stuck it on.  \"Raub’s got here with his kitchen ... so, let’s go ... okay? Now?\"  He was talking to himself, spitting out words, annoyed by the day’s problems, war’s problems.  He rose from his knees and, stooping low to keep from cracking himself against the roof, edged, crab-fashion, toward the door.  \"I’m leavin’ ... I’m goin’,\" he cried.  \"I’ll be along in a minute,\" Dennison said, yawning and propping himself against the wall, legs and shoulders feeling stiff.  Landel reappeared.  \"Go on ... I’m awake!\" he shouted.  \"See you at the chuck wagon.\"  \"We’ve got to eat quick ... we’ve a hell of a lot to do,\" Landel screamed, his head in the doorway.  He zoomed his flashlight into Dennison’s eyes, like a warning, and walked off.  Angry, Dennison rubbed his hands over his bearded face, slumped down onto the floor again.  Through the doorway he caught glimpses of the flashlights and lanterns of men headed for the kitchen: legs and lights passed with metronome jerkiness across the sand: dust came up from beneath boots.  Shellfire rumbled in the distance, a sound that had in it all the vacuity of the African desert.  A jab of wind dribbled sand through the doorway and shook sand from the make-shift roof of the shelter where only yesterday gunners had been trapped emplacing a gun.  Dennison smelled the stench of gasoline and grease from the tanks and a tank dump nearby; he could smell the gas and grease on his clothes; it seemed to swirl around him.  The incoming air was chilly.  Shivering, he hauled a blanket around him and with his shoulders against a sandbag, lit a cigarette.  As his lighter flared he noticed his squashed, grease-pocked helmet; sleepily, he reached for it and placed it across his lap, pressing it down, making it a part of him.  One hand holding his pack of cigarettes, the other bringing a cigarette to his mouth, he tried to think.  It seemed to him that he had dreamed during the night.  The tip of the cigarette glowed encouragingly.  Yes, he had dreamed about the library tower, the chimes, the sounds travelling down the hill slopes, down toward Lake Cayuga, the tower and the sounds blurring.  Kids were sitting in the library, at long tables, faces, faces.  There seemed to be an elm tree at the far end of the reading room, snow, lake ...  He tried to remember the sound of those chimes.  Huddled against sandbags, he drowsed and as he drowsed he saw a campfire in the woods somewhere, students standing around the fire, some of them singing.  A guy was playing his harmonica, muting his music by cupping both hands over the instrument ...  Dennison’s arms and hands had fallen asleep.  Yesterday the pace across the desert had been formidable, the heat increasing, a shortage of water, the water warm and sickening, nothing at all to eat at noon ...  He shook his hands and arms to bring back the circulation, groaning, cold, the exhaust of a tank stinking and coughing nearby. The sound brought with it the sensation of violent pitching, the distress of gasoline and oil fumes, the threat of shellfire at close range.  Shoving his sweater inside his trouser, adjusting his belt, he knelt and fished about: his helmet had rolled heedlessly and bumped against the wall: recovering it, he strapped it on, tilting it over his forehead, aware of its grime.  Slipping on his leather jacket, yanking the zipper, he wormed about the blankets for his mess kit and stepped out into the open, feeling sand drop off his clothes.  Outdoors, his cigarette tasted better and he inhaled deeply to help wake up.  The chilly air nipped his face and hands, as he stood motionless urinating.  Behind the shack rose a tangle of rusty machinery from an irrigation pump, the machinery snarled over a cannon-sized conduit, the pipe’s mouth toward the sky.  The stars seemed closer because of the junked pipes and gears: the sky, utterly cloudless, was defiant: in a few hours its sun would be hammering, leading on and on, sand gobbling sand, dunes blurring into hills: heat and flies would move it together, thirst would be everywhere.  A G.I. scuffed by, coughing and spitting.  \"Raub’s here,\" he called, noticing Dennison and his cigarette. \"We’re ready to eat!\"  He coughed again.  Dennison wet his lips with his tongue and swallowed.  \"I’m right behind you,\" he said.  \"Wait a second ... I’ve got my flashlight.  Here, Millard!\"  He pulled his flash from his jacket pocket and walked behind his crewmate--the sand deep, their boots scuffing, the flashlight wobbling as if asleep.  \"Gonna get hot today,\" Millard hollered.  \"Can’t hear you,\" Dennison hollered.  \"Any news on the radio?\"  \"What was it you said?\"  Raub had his kitchen under lopsided leafless trees and a scabby fire of branches burned close to it, kitchen and blaze hidden behind a dune, an enormous crested thing with skeletal brush and camel grass growing on its side.  Gaunt, set off by stars, it threatened the kitchen and men, hung, swollen, a thing of unbelievable weight.  Yellow light crept up the slope and bounced off the scarred steel of the field kitchen.  Steam gushed from pots at the rear of the stove; the air smelled of coffee and hash.  His flashlight in his pocket, Dennison worked his way through sixty or eighty men, brushing sand out of a mess kit with a dirty handkerchief and the palm of his hand.  It seemed to him that he had done this many times.  \"Hi,\" he greeted one of the Corps.  \"Hi, Dennison ... Hi.  Goddamn desert, cold.  Freeze off your ass.\"  The man drained his coffee and then blew into the bottom of his cup. \"Coffee’s good,\" he said.  \"Give me a cup of coffee,\" Dennison said to Raub, at the kitchen: Raub had his coffee pot raised for "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/44717"],["title","Forward, Children! (#2)"],["body","pouring, his face smudged, his eyes puttied with sleep; cups were scattered along the kitchen counter in front of him, some of them clean.  \"Howdy, any news from you guys?\" Raub asked, tilting the pot, arm extended across the counter, the pot steaming.  He smiled at Dennison, liking him: Dennison reminded him of a fellow back home, in Atlanta, a boy he’d grown up with.  \"You ought to know the news,\" Dennison said, \"you just came in with your outfit, so what’s the news?  What’s up?\"  \"Not a damn thing!  Here, hold still, have some hash.  Hungry? It’s not bad stuff.\"  \"Sure,\" Dennison said.  \"Fill’er up,\" Millard said, behind Dennison.  \"I could eat anything!\"  The Corpsmen wore regulation uniforms or the coveralls of the mechanic; there were a number in fatigues; some men wore helmets; they were an unshaven lot.  Their khaki did not count for much: they were all of a piece: their greasy, oily, gasoline messed clothes stuck to their greasy, oily bodies; they had not washed in days.  No water, no inclination.  They appeared strangely alike in the firelight, each with a bush on his face, each with a crew cut or helmet, each with his mess kit or cup of coffee.  A shell thudded behind the great dune.  \"Hell, I hope they don’t lay a line on this fire,\" Millard said, moving a few yards away from the kitchen to allow others to queue up.  His pan filled, Dennison stepped out of line and pushed his way through the crewmen.  \"Captain Meyers had guys pull some of the wood out of the blaze,\" a fat sergeant told Dennison.  \"They’re not near enough for a hit,\" Dennison belched cheerfully, spooning some hash.  \"Christ, there’s a village burning up over there, beyond that dune,\" somebody yelled.  \"What’s a piddling campfire alongside a village! We’ll be out of here in an hour.  It’ll be our turn to let them have it!\"  Dennison found a hollow and sat down on a dead tree, a palm, a frondless bole; shoes sliding into the sand, he resumed eating, spooning and chewing slowly, listening to the men talk, noticing the stars now and then.  The pan burned pleasantly in his hand and he shifted it about and spooned another spoonful of hash, his mouth sticking out, his nose in the steam.  On one side of him, Millard was shouting:  \" ... Why, you know the drag of those cylinders, the lousy combustion; why, man alive, the Panzer tanks withstand the desert heat a hell of a lot better than our machines.  Why...\"  Somebody was yelling for more hash.  Somebody beefed:  \"We’ve got fifteen Sherman tanks in reserve ... I’ll bet we never use them!\"  Dennison was familiar with some of the voices and the familiarity helped: the fire was encouraging: the hash was really hot: there was more at the chuck wagon.  Coffee too.  Yesterday ... he tried to shut off the memory as he would a tap, but memory trickled through: Jesus, the vast terrain they had covered, that whamming through the sand, screwing round to avoid rocks, ducking behind a dune, climbing to fall into the direct fire of a Panther, her guns blazing ...  Luck, nothing but luck had pulled them out of that jam.  You never could tell, maybe they would have a lucky break today ... maybe it wouldn’t get too hot inside the bus; maybe there might be enough water, stuff that was fit to drink ... they could travel across some comparatively level ground, none of the loose sand to baulk the treads.  And food?  Maybe they’d have something to eat, a chance to eat outside the tank.  It was a wretched kind of hope, the same hope that everyone got up with every morning--but it was hope.  Gazing at the smoke from the fire, he followed it upward where the sky was a thousand stars, no New York sky; even through the smoke the points blinked brightly.  Coldly.  He held a mouthful of coffee on his tongue before he tackled his food once more. The bread was fresh.  Good crust.  He felt his body lose a little of its weariness; one leg sank into the sand; probably the desert was not too bad in the winter time, at some oasis, town or city.  He signalled to Isaac Jacobs who was wandering through the crowd of crewmen, walking sleepily, balancing his heaped up mess kit, coffee cup in the midst of the hash.  Zinc’s beard shone weirdly, crazily red in the light.  He pushed his way past a couple of gesturing men and stepped on a smoldering log someone had dragged from the campfire.  \"Goddammit,\" he exclaimed, wobbling, balancing. \"Almost got myself badly singed.  Gotta watch where we step in this desert.\"  His teeth flashed in a grin intended for Dennison. Dennison grunted and nodded, his mouth full, his eyes narrowed to friendly slits.  \"Sit down on the tree.\"  \"How goes it?\" Zinc asked, sitting, his mess kit on the trunk alongside.  \"Not bad.  Any news?\"  \"Sure, Raub shorted me on hash and bread--that’s news!\" Zinc said, spooning food.  \"I heard Chuck say that a unit of the 604th is trailing us; somebody picked up their radio.\"  \"I wouldn’t mind seein’ ole Sutter and Reynolds again,\" Zink said, sopping hash onto a lump of bread, bowing his legs around his kit.  The fire was sparking and sending out low flames: for several minutes the dune came nearer, seemed taller, more ominous. When the flames flared the dune retreated.  Zinc’s face, because of his beard, appeared round and oriental; a hint of satire, of his good humor, was apparent as he chewed and watched the fire, the coming and going men.  His hair, badly cut, trimmed by a madman, was greasy, in contrast to his scrubbed whiskers.  He was built like a jockey--small boned, and lightly muscled.  Staring at Dennison, he rolled his chocolate eyes expressively.  \"This stuff, this hacked up meat, is easier to eat than the gunk they fed us yesterday,\" he said.  \"A pan of salmon’s not my idea of chow in the desert.\"  \"Yeah, it was lousy,\" Dennison agreed.  \"I’m gettin’ me more of this hash, when I’m done.\"  \"Sure ... there’s plenty.\"  \"Raub got here plenty early...\"  \"Great logistics ... I’ll have more hash before the flies move in,\" said Dennison.  \"Flies ... flies ... they’re everywhere when we stop ... a fine way to go to hell ... carried there by flies!\"  \"How’s your stomach?\" Dennison asked.  \"Any better this morning?\"  Yesterday, at a noon halt, Zinc had held to a tread and vomited, gasping, his face white above his beard.  During the morning run he had been hurled against the stock of his machine gun.  \"I’m doin’ all right,\" Zinc said \"My guts have settled into place--somehow.  Maybe the muscles inside are knittin’ together again or whatever.  I can breathe okay.  No pain.\"  He chuckled faintly.  \"It was one hell of a rotten jolt, and came near puttin’ me out of running.  I think this food will stay down.\"  \"You’ll be okay,\" Dennison said.  Zinc flaunted a hunk of bread.  \"As long as I can eat I can manage,\" he exclaimed.  The fire had attracted more of the Corps; some sat on the palm tree; two perched on a bed roll; others squatted on the sand; several sat on oil drums; some ate with their backs to the flames; others loafed about the kitchen.  When Raub waved a mess kit and yelled, Dennison got up and crossed the sand to the wagon.  \"More hash ... more coffee,\" he said, offering his pan.  \"Sure man,\" said Raub.  Dennison stared at him while he spooned hash, sliced bread, and poured coffee: he was a far off guy, slow, sloppy, small, with black rimmed spectacles and a black wad of a moustache, the image of a grubby Parisian painter though he had never painted or been outside of Georgia until the war.  \"Did you have a tough time, bringing the kitchen forward?\" Dennison shouted.  \"Yeah ... bad findin’ you guys in the black ... bad truck ... but weah heah.\"  To Dennison he sounded unreal: where the hell was Georgia? Where was the US?  All these men ... here ... how had they gotten here?  The dune became real but the conflict was unreal.  Settling his cup on the kit he asked himself whether he should eat more? What about being wounded on a full belly?  Was it worse with the belly full?  Some said....  \"Heah, heah,\" said Raub.  \"I’ve got some sinkahs for you. Would you all like a couple?\"  \"Huh ... I guess so...\"  Raub opened a cupboard door--a stainless steel door in the side of his kitchen--and pulled out a cellophane bag and passed doughnuts to Dennison, one at a time, hooked over a finger.  Dennison grinned.  \"Good boy, Raub.\"  \"Mum’s da word.  Quick, hide’em, while we’re alone.\"  Raub frowned, imagining GI’s storming over the sand, howling for doughnuts across the counter.  \"Jus’ remember, when your folks sends you all some stuff, jus’ remember me again.\"  \"I’ll remember.\"  Dennison returned to Zinc and munched a doughnut underneath his nose--sitting down beside him.  \"See how it’s done!\"  \"How’d you rate that?\"  \"Reach in my jacket ... there’s another sinkah ... you all likes ’em.\"  Zinc appreciated Dennison’s fake accent, fished for the doughnut, and bit into it.  \"Perfect.\"  Hunkered on the tree, they finished their food and drank more coffee. They stopped talking.  Dennison lit a cigarette and offered his pack to Zinc, who accepted one.  They had stopped talking because of fear.  Fear was in the cigarette.  In the sand.  \"Landel was nervous as hell yesterday,\" Dennison began.  \"He acted as if the whole Africa Korps was on him!\"  He remembered Landel bellowing over the tank intercom, storming about supplies. Using the radio he screamed at officers, berating them when they answered.  \"Operation haywire,\" Zinc commented, recalling the outburst.  \"Colonel Morris says he’ll report Landel ... Landel was drunk on Monday ... well, hell, we need a break,\" he said, wanting a leave, a week, two weeks, a month away from the assaults.  Let some other guy knife his way through the Anadi pocket.  Let some other crew hammer at the men entrenched at Anadi.  Anadi was nothing. Never could mean anything.  \"Morris is bad,\" Zinc said.  \"He couldn’t take it yesterday, couldn’t talk some of the time.  One of his men got shot through the head.  Their tank conked out ... a faulty timer.\""]]]
