It has a glass stage to hold transparent objects, and a brass one for opaque objects, and a mirror below to reflect light up through transparent objects.  It is much better to use a good simple microscope than a poor and cheap compound one; be sure and remember this and not be enticed to buy such an one by any representations as to its great magnifying power.  A compound microscope is one with a tube from four to ten inches long, an arrangement for holding the object to be looked at, and a mirror below to reflect light upon or through it. The lenses at the end next the object are small, and are set in a small brass tube, which is called an \"objective.\" It screws into the large tube. The lenses at the end of the large tube next the eye are set in a tube, called the eye-piece, which slides in and out of the large tube. Different objectives contain lenses of different sizes according to the magnifying power desired, and they are named \"two inch,\" \"one inch,\" \"half inch,\" and so on down to \"one seventy-fifth.\" Eye-pieces are sometimes named \"A,\" \"B,\" \"C,\" but more properly \"two inch,\" and so on down to \"one eighth.\" There is a very great variety in the forms of compound microscopes, from the very simple up to the very elaborate, and the prices vary accordingly. A simple but useful form is given in Fig. 6.  A great deal of money can be expended on a microscope and the various instruments made to use with it and which are called \"accessory apparatus\"; but it is best not to buy these instruments until you know just what you want, and not to spend much money at first except under the advice of a \"microscopist.\"  Some simple things, however, you will need at once, such as a few slips of glass three inches long and one inch wide, called \"glass slides,\" some pieces of very thin glass, called \"cover glass,\" a pair of tweezers, some needles fastened into pen-holders for handles, and a few glass tubes commonly called \"pipettes,\" or \"dipping tubes.\" These can be readily bought, and some of them easily made.    [Illustration: CATCHING ANIMALCULA WITH A PIPETTE.]   III.--OBJECTS.  As soon as you have a microscope you will begin to look at everything and anything: dust, crumbs of bread, flour, starch, mosquitoes, flies, and moth millers in their season; flowers and leaves, cotton, wool, and silk. But this scattering kind of observation will soon weary you. In order to get the greatest pleasure and best results from your work, you must proceed with some system.    [Illustration: BULL'S EYE LENS.]  There are so many objects visible only through the microscope that life is not long enough for you to see them all, much less to study them. Some microscopists devote the time they have for such studies to the observation of single classes of objects; the physician observes the various parts of the animal structure, and calls his work \"histology;\" the botanist examines the vegetable kingdom; the entomologist, insects; but in all these departments there are numerous subdivisions. As a guide to your work, you will find some book on the microscope very useful; the best one is _The Microscope and its Revelations_, by Dr. William B. Carpenter.    [Illustration: MAGNIFIED 50 DIAMETERS.]    [Illustration: FLY'S EYE--5 DIAMETERS.]  Objects through which you can see light are called \"transparent,\" and are the easiest to look at with the microscope, because you can lay them on a glass slide and throw light up through them with your mirror. Thick objects through which light cannot pass are called \"opaque,\" and are more difficult to examine, and can only be seen with low powers and a bright light.  In order to see such objects in the evening, you will need a \"bull's eye\" lens mounted on a stand, which you can place beside your microscope and between the lamp and the stage, condensing the light of the lamp on the object. (_Fig. 1._) There are other methods of illuminating opaque objects, but they are expensive and difficult to manage, yet by and by if you persevere in this delightful occupation you will learn what they are.    [Illustration: Scale of Butterfly   MAGNIFIED 200 DIAMETERS.]    [Illustration: HEAD OF MOSQUITO. MAGNIFIED 15 DIAMETERS.]  Some persons will expect you to show them a fly as big as a horse; but you will soon be able to prove to them that you know more about the matter than they do. With a large hand-lens, you can see a whole fly at once and magnify it two or three times; but when you put it on the stage of your compound microscope and try to magnify it still more, you will find that you can only see a part of it at a time, and the higher the power you use, the less can you see; in other words, the more you magnify an object, the smaller is the field of view.  An inch-objective will show the head of an housefly, which in a bright light is a very beautiful object. No picture can equal the delicacy of the color of the eyes of a live fly.    [Illustration: SECTION OF WOOD.   MAGNIFIED 50 DIAMETERS.]  After a little practise you will be able to separate the different parts of insects and look at them with higher powers. The moth fly will soon be on the wing, and your aunt will not call you cruel if you kill and cut up large numbers of them. Put a little of the dust that comes off from the wing of a moth on a glass slide, look at it with a high power, and you will find that each particle of dust is a pretty leaf-like scale. You have seen in summer the dust on the wings of butterflies; remember this, and look at this butterfly dust with your microscope.  Flowers and leaves you can always easily obtain; but in looking at them you must remember what has already been said about \"transparent\" and \"opaque\" objects.  Thin slices or sections of stems, leaves, and portions of flowers, can be made with a sharp knife, and examined as transparent objects, so that thus you can observe the internal or cellular structure of the vegetable kingdom.   IV.--HOME EXPERIMENTS.    [Illustration: FIG. 1.]  During the cold weather it is not pleasant to make excursions into the country and search for objects for the microscope; so you will look about and see what you can find at home; and if you live in Boston, Cochituate water will invite your inspection. The best way to get at the minute objects in this or any water that is supplied through pipes, is to make a bag of cotton cloth, not too fine, well washed in water without soap, about a foot long, large enough at the top to slip over a faucet that has a screw on it (like the common kitchen faucet adapted for a filter), so that it can be tied with a string, and small enough at the bottom to be tied on to the neck of a small bottle such as is used for homoeopathic pills. This bag should taper gradually in size from the top to the bottom. (_Fig. 1._)    [Illustration: The Water Flea   FIG. 2. CYCLOPS QUADRICORNIS. MAGNIFIED 20 DIAMETERS.]    [Illustration: FIG. 3. CANTHOCAMPTUS MINUTUS. 40 DIAMETERS.]  If there is a strong head of water where your faucet is, you must reduce the pressure by opening other faucets on the same floor, such as those in the laundry, otherwise many of the small creatures will be crushed in the interstices of the bag. Now let the water run. The bag will swell out and the water ooze through its sides, and all objects too small to pass through it will fall down and settle in the little bottle at the bottom. When you see that there is a considerable amount of sediment in the bottle, shut off the water and gently squeeze the bag between your thumb and forefinger, beginning at the top and moving your hand down towards the bottle. This movement will cause much of the sediment that has adhered to the sides of the bag to fall down. Now untie your bottle and set it aside and let the water run through the bag to clean it. If you have a filter attached to your kitchen faucet you can get a very good idea of the solid contents of the water by unscrewing it, or turning it over if it is made so as to reverse, and letting the sediment that has collected on it drip into a tumbler, but the bag gives much better results, as many of the delicate forms that live in the water are crushed to death on the filter.    [Illustration: FIG. 4. CHYDORUS SPHOERICUS. 50 DIAMETERS.]  Having got the sediment in either a tumbler or a bottle, you must make your first observation on it with the naked eye by holding it up to the light and looking through it. You will find it of a brown color, because a large part of it consists of particles of earth and decayed vegetable matter, but you will presently see many little white specks moving about with a jumping or hopping movement. These are commonly called \"water-fleas,\" on account of their peculiar movements, but the name is misleading, as they belong to the crustacea (animals having a shell or crust like the lobster), and not to the insects.  They are found abundantly in ponds and ditches, and in salt water. Sometimes they are so abundant in drinking water that has not been filtered, as to alarm a timid person, but you will find them just as good to eat raw as they are cooked. The most common of these little creatures is the _Cyclops Quadricornis_, so called because he has one eye and four horns. (_Fig. 2._)  This picture represents a female, and she carries her eggs in the two little black bags that you see fastened on each side of the abdomen. You will find it very interesting by and by to watch the eggs hatch and see the little cyclops hop away. When young they do not look much like their parents; they are rounder and their legs are more prominent. The female cyclops (the male is comparatively rare) is the most common creature in Cochituate water, and as it is constantly eating, it helps to purify the water, and, in its turn, is eaten by the fishes.  In swimming it contracts its four horns and its fringed feet with a quick movement that throws it forward through the water with a leap.  Its one eye is of a brilliant red, and is a beautiful"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38428"],["title","Through a Microscope (#2)"],["body","under the microscope. The shell also is sometimes beautifully colored, and is often transparent, so that the internal organs are plainly visible through it.    [Illustration: FIG. 5.]  Another of the family of _Cyclopidæ_ is the _Canthocamptus minutus_ (_fig. 3_), which you see is longer and more tapering in its form than the _Cyclops Quadricornis_. It is also very common and very active.  _Chydorus Sphoericus_ (_fig. 4_) is a very pretty round form interesting to study when transparent.  All these and some others with rather hard names are in that division of the _Crustacea_ called _Entomostraca_, meaning shelled creatures whose shells are cut and do not cover them all round. On this principle, an oyster on the half-shell might be called an _Entomostracan_.  Now to catch these lively fellows, you must take a dipping tube and be patient, and when you have got one in the tube, carefully drop it on the bottom of the \"live-box\" (_fig. 5_), and put on the cover. Examine it first with the lowest power you have. By careful management of the cover you can catch it between the top and bottom without breaking the shell, and in this prison you can study it at leisure.   V.--COCHITUATE WATER.  You have read or been told that if you look at a drop of water through a microscope you will find it full of animalculæ, and showmen will sometimes exhibit water containing _entomostraca_ hopping about, and will try to persuade you that all water looks in the same way.    [Illustration: ROTIFER VULGARIS.]  But this is a common mistake, as you will soon find out for yourselves. Water such as is commonly used for drinking purposes, whether it comes from a well, spring, river, or pond, contains but little animal or vegetable life in proportion to its quantity; you may place drop after drop under the microscope without finding anything visible, and you can only tell what is in it by filtering a great deal of it. Water standing in ditches or pools for a long time, becomes full of growth of various kinds, and is then so discolored and slimy that no one would think of drinking it.    [Illustration: CARAPACE OF ANURÆ STIPITATA.]  Let us return to the little bottle which you filled with Cochituate filterings last month. Take a little from the bottom with your dipping-tube; put it in the live box and examine it with a half-inch objective. You will see many forms that are strange to you, and we will suppose that the first is that of one of the rotifers. These little creatures are called by this name because of two Latin words meaning wheel-carriers, for on their heads they have an arrangement which looks like a wheel, sometimes in rapid motion.    [Illustration: FLOSCULARIA ORNATA.]  The most common kind is called _Rotifer vulgaris_ (_fig. 1_), and is a very interesting and elastic being. Sometimes he is gloomy and draws himself in so that he looks like a ball; then he will stretch out full length, and opening his wheel, shoot through the water with great speed. Again he will attach his tail to some fixed object, and by the aid of his wheel draw a rapid current of water through his mouth; it is thus that you can best observe him, and by and by you will discover that the apparent wheel is only a result of the rapid sweeping movement of the long hairs or cilia which fringe the opening in the top of the head. Through this opening the water passes, the rotifer gathers his food from the current, and the food passes into the mastax, where it is ground by the masticating apparatus, which is easily seen in motion.    [Illustration: DINOBRYON TORTULARIA.]  There are several different rotifers found in Cochituate water; among them the most common is the _Anuræ Stipitata_. (_Fig. 2._) It is like a turtle, with a shell, or carapace, beautifully ornamented. You will see plenty of these empty shells, and sometimes you will find one inhabited, when you will see that the creature has a bright red eye, and several bundles of cilia, in front of the projecting spires.  One of the families of the rotifers is called _Floscularia_, because it resembles a flower; it is attached at the base to small plants, or algæ, and occupies a sheath so transparent that it is hardly visible. One species is occasionally found in the Cochituate, the _Floscularia ornata_. (_Fig. 3._) It is a beautiful object, with its elongated radiating cilia, which remain quiet, and do not vibrate. The specimen figured has three eggs attached to its stem.  You will find other rotifers in the Cochituate, some formed like vases, others with long spires, but all graceful and beautiful. The _Dinobryon Tortularia_ is sometimes very common in this water.  In October, 1881, when the taste of the water was very bad, the _Dinobryon_ was very abundant, though we do not know that it had anything to do with the bad taste. You will see by the figure, that it is like a tree, with an individual of the family at the end of every branch. Each one has its own organs of existence, although attached to its brothers by its stem. Each has a bright red eye, and a long slender whip, called a _flagellum_, with which it lashes the water, and when all the _flagellæ_ are in motion, the whole tree swims about. The individuals are very small indeed, and it will take your best objective to show the _flagellum_.    [Illustration: VORTICELLA NEBULIFERA.]  Another tree-like group is that of the _Vorticella_, of which you will sometimes find in the Cochituate, the species _Vorticella nebulifera_. Each animal is at the top of a stem, and this stem has the peculiar property of being able to coil up and draw its head down close to the bottom. This appears to be a defensive movement, for whenever a big ugly creature comes by, down go the whole family so quickly that your eye cannot follow the movement. Sometimes they will all bob down when you tap the stage of the microscope so as to jar them. At a certain period of its life the animal suddenly leaves its stem, and goes swimming about with great speed.   VI.--INTERESTING OBJECTS.    [Illustration: STEPHANODISCUS NIAGARÆ.]  The most beautiful of the small _algæ_ or water plants are the _Diatomaceæ_ and the _Desmidiaceæ_, sometimes called for brevity diatoms and desmids. They are remarkable for the geometrical character of their forms, consisting of circles, triangles and polygons of infinite variety. They are very small, and cannot be satisfactorily seen with an objective of less power than a four tenths. The diatoms are found everywhere in both fresh and salt water, but the desmids live only in fresh water. One of the most common diatoms in Cochituate water is the _Stephanodiscus Niagaræ_. (_Fig. 1._) It is in shape like a pill box, and its sides, which would be called its top and bottom if it were a pill box, are beautifully ornamented with dots in radiating lines with a ring of spines near the edge. This circle of spines or thorns explains its name, _Stephanodiscus_, from the proto-martyr, Saint Stephen. The name _Niagaræ_ is from Niagara River, where it was found. Like all diatoms, it contains when alive a yellowish brown matter with small globules of oil, which is called _endochrome_. The box or shell, called _pustule_, is of silex or quartz, and is therefore almost indestructible; and when the diatom dies, sinks to the bottom of the water. In this way beds of shells of diatoms are sometimes formed of considerable thickness.    [Illustration: ASTERIONELLA BLEAKLEYII.]    [Illustration: TABELLARIA FENESTRATA.]  Under the city of Richmond, Va., there is such a deposit, varying from ten to twenty feet in depth, and extending for many miles. Some of the diatoms, especially those shaped like a boat, called _Navicula_, have a peculiar motion which at one time led observers to think them animals. No one knows how this motion is produced, and if you can find this out, you will make a very important discovery. The most common diatom in Cochituate water is _Asterionella Bleakleyii_. It resembles a star with rays, or the hub and spokes of a wheel. (_Fig. 2._) This diatom is often found in abundance in the water supplies of cities. It never forms a complete circle, but grows into spirals or whorls which easily break up.    [Illustration: SPONGILLA FLUVIATILIS.]    [Illustration: DESMIDIUM SWARTZII. FRONT AND SIDE VIEW.]  Another diatom common in Cochituate is _Tabellaria Fenestrata_, which grows in ribbon-like forms. (_Fig. 3._) The desmids resemble the diatoms in the geometrical character of their forms, but they have no shell of silex, and are therefore easily destroyed. They are readily distinguished at sight by the beautiful green color of the contained matter. In many of them there is a curious circulation of small particles, especially in the ends of those of a crescent or new-moon shape. This circulation can only be seen with a high power. Desmids are easily found in ponds and ditches; and there are several species in Cochituate. Among them is _Desmidium Swartzii_ (_fig. 4_), and _Closterium moniliferum_. (_Fig. 5._) Their beauty depends so much on color that they do not appear to advantage in the figures. You will find in examining the filterings of Cochituate water, many objects which have not been described in these papers, and among them many fragments of green filaments of the small plants belonging to the _confervæ_ and the _oscillatoriæ_; sometimes you will find small round opaque forms of brown or green color, which are probably spores of plants of a larger growth; sometimes you will see the pollen of pine-trees which has fallen into the water and looks like three small balls fastened together; sometimes, though rarely, you may find one of those curious little creatures called water bears, or _tardigrada_; and you may be fortunate enough to catch a water spider.    [Illustration: CLOSTERIUM MONILIFERUM.]  But you will often see the _spiculæ_ of the sponge, called _Spongilla fluviatilis_. They look like pins of glass, blunt at one end and pointed at the other, and are"]]]
