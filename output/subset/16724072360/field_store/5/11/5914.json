The young Kentuckian from his place of concealment smiled to himself.  \"There are some things which even a Shawanoe, cannot do, and that's one of them.\"  Such was the fact; for, with that care which the trained pioneer never permits himself to forget or disregard, the lad had adopted every artifice at his command to add to the difficulty of identifying his footsteps.  The warrior straightened up with an impatient \"Ugh!\" which brought another smile to the face of the watcher, for it proved beyond question the failure of his foes.  The Shawanoe, however, had established one fact--the overrunning of the trail.  The one for whom they were searching had left the path at some point behind them.  Scant chance was there of learning the precise spot.  \"Follow me if you can,\" was the exultant thought of Jack, who carefully lowered the hammer of his rifle.  \"I'm glad that as the painter was determined on picking a quarrel with me he did not do it earlier in the day--helloa!\"  While speaking to himself, he became aware that the warriors were invisible.  They may have believed they were acting as oscillating targets for some hidden enemy, who was likely to press the trigger at any moment; and, unable even to approximate as they were his biding-place, they withdrew in their characteristic fashion.  Jack thrust his head still further from behind the tree, and finally stepped forth that he might obtain the best view he could.  But the red men had vanished like the shadows of swiftly-moving clouds. Nothing more was to be feared from that source.  But with the lifting of the peril from his own shoulders, there returned his distressing anxiety for his absent companion.  No doubt could exist that when he put his horse to his hurried flight, he had done so to escape the Indians.  Whether he had succeeded remained to be learned, but Jack felt that every probability was against it.  He might well debate as to his own duty in the premises.  His one desire was to learn what had become of Otto, the German lad, with whom he left the Settlements a couple of days before.  Neither had ever visited this section, but they were following the instructions of those who had, and the young Kentuckian knew the precise point in their journey that had been reached.  Standing as motionless as the trees beside him and amid the darkening shadows, Jack Carleton listened with the intentness of an Indian scout stealing into a hostile camp.  The soft murmur which seems to reach us when a sea-shell is held to the ear filled the air.  It was the voice of the night--the sighing of the scarcely moving wind among the multitudinous branches, the restless movements of myriads of trees--the soft embrace of millions of leaves, which, like the great ocean itself, even when the air is pulseless, is never at rest.  Jack Carleton had spent too many days and nights in the woods to be greatly impressed with the solemnity and grandeur of his surroundings.  That which would have awed his soul, if noted for the first time, had lost the power to do so from its familiarity; but while in the attitude of listening, he became conscious of another sound which did not belong to the vast forest, the throbbing air, nor the gathering darkness.     CHAPTER III  ON THE BANK OF THE MISSISSIPPI   That which reached the ears of Jack Carleton, while he stood in the woods, silent and listening, was a peculiar swashing noise, which continued a few seconds, followed by the same space of silence--the intervals being as regular as the ticking of a huge pendulum. Accompanying the sound was another, a soft, almost inaudible flow, such as one hears when standing on the bank of a vast stream of water.  He knew that both were caused by the sweep of the mighty Mississippi which was near at hand.  The reason for the first he could not understand, but that of the latter was apparent.  He had never looked upon the Father of Waters, but many a time he had rested along the Ohio and been lulled to sleep by its musical flow, even while the camp-fires of the hostile red men twinkled on the other shore.  Manifestly nothing could be done by remaining where he was, and, in the same guarded manner in which he left the trail a half hour before, he began picking his way back.  Probably he ran greater personal risk in following the beaten path, yet he was controlled by a true hunter's instinct in every movement made.  When he reached the trail, he observed that not only had the night descended, but the full moon was shining from an almost unclouded sky.  The trees, crowned with exuberant vegetation, cast deep shadows, like those of the electric light, and only here and there did the arrowy moonbeams strike the ground, redolent with the odors of fresh earth and moldering leaves.  \"Some of the warriors may be returning or groping along the trail,\" was the thought of the youth, who glided silently forward, his senses on the alert.  His misgivings, however, were much less than when watching the two Shawanoes, for with the dense gloom of the forest inclosing him on every hand, he felt that the shelter was not only secure but was of instant avail.  Less than a furlong was passed, when he caught the shimmering of water.  A few steps further and he stood for the first time on the bank of the Mississippi.  The youth felt those emotions which must come to every one when he emerges from a vast forest at night and pauses beside one of the grandest streams of the globe.  At that day its real source was unknown, but Jack, who was unusually well informed for one of his years, was aware that it rose somewhere among the snowy mountains and unexplored regions far to the northward, and that, after its winding course of hundreds of leagues, during which it received the volume of many rivers, enormous in themselves, it debouched into the tropical waters of the Gulf of Mexico.  The reflection of the turbid current showed that it was flowing swiftly.  The dark line of the forest on the other shore appeared like a solid wall of blackness, while to the north and south the view ended in the same impenetrable gloom.  Impressed and awed by the scene, the lad saw something which at first startled him by its resemblance to a man, standing in the river, with his feet braced against the bottom and his head and shoulders above the surface.  The current seemed to rush against his bared breast, from which it was cast back and aside, as though flung off by a granite rock.  Then the head bowed forward, as if the strong man sought to bathe his brain in the cooling waters, that he might be refreshed against the next shock.  A minute's scrutiny was enough to show Jack that the object was a tree, which, rolling into the river at some point, perhaps hundreds of miles above, had grown weary of its journey, and, plunging its feet into the muddy bed of the stream, had, refused to go further. The fierce current would lift the head several feet with a splash, but could hold it thus only a part of a minute, when it would dip for a brief while, to rise again and repeat the action.  The tree was what is known to-day on the Mississippi as a \"sawyer,\" and which is so dreaded by the steamers and other craft navigating the river.  Many a boat striking at full speed against them, have had their hulls pierced as if by a hundred-pound shell, and have gone to the bottom like stone.  It was the sound made by the \"sawyer\" which had puzzled Jack Carleton before he caught sight of the great river.  He could not wonder that he had failed to guess the cause of the intermittent swash which reached him through the woods.  \"And we must cross that stream,\"  murmured Jack, with half a shudder, as he looked out upon the prodigious volume rushing southward like myriads of wild horses; \"it seems to me no one can swim to the other shore, nor can a raft or boat be pushed thither.\"  The plucky boy would not have felt so distrustful and timid had the sun been shining overhead.  \"Ish dot you, Jack?\"  Young Carleton turned his head as if a war hoop had sounded in his ear.  He fairly bounded feet when he recognized his old friend at his elbow.  The good-natured German lad was grinning with delight, as he extended his chubby hand and asked:  \"How you vos?\"  \"Why, Otto!\" gasped Jack, slapping his palm against that of his friend and crushing it as if in a vise.  \"I am so glad to see you.\"  \"So I vos,\" was the grinning response; \"I'm always glad to shake hands mit myself.\"  \"But,\" said the other, looking furtively over each shoulder in turn, \"let's move away the trail, where we cannot be seen or heard.\"  The suggestion was a wise one, and acted upon without delay. The friends entered the wood, which continued quite open, and tramped steadily forward with the intention of finding place where they could start a fire and converse without danger of discovery by enemies.  The hearts of both were too full for hold their peace while stealing forward among the trees.  \"Otto,\" said Jack, \"where is the colt?\"  \"I dinks he's purty near New Orleans as soon as dis time.\"  Young Carleton looked wonderingly toward friend and asked, \"What do you mean?\"  \"I don't mean vot I don't say and derefore dinks I mean vot I vos.\"  \"So the colt went into the river?  Where were you?\"  \"Mit de colt and he vos mit me, so we bot vos mit each other.  Just feels of me.\"  Jack reached out his hand and pinched the clothing of his friend in several places.  It was saturated.  \"Ven I valks, de vater in my shoes squishes up to mine ears--don't you hear 'em?\"  \"Why don't you pour it out?\"  \"I hef done so, tree time already--I done so again once more.\"  And, without ado, the young German threw himself forward on his hands and head and kicked his feet with a vigor that sent the moisture in every direction.  Indeed the performance was conducted with so much ardor that one of the shoes flow off with considerable violence.

Raeburn came nearer, but his reputation was Scotch. Blake in his inspiration was regarded, not without reason, as a madman. Flaxman called for classic taste to appreciate him; and the fame of English art would have suffered both at home and abroad if a simple, manly lad had not quitted a Scotch manse and sailed from Leith to London, bringing with him indelible memories of the humour and the pathos of peasant life, and reproducing them with such graphic fidelity, power, and tenderness that the whole world has heard of David Wilkie.  The pause between sunset and sunrise, the interregnum which signifies that a phase in some department of the world's history has passed away as a day is done, and a new development of human experience is about to present itself, was over in literature. The romantic period had succeeded the classic. Scott, Coleridge, Southey (Wordsworth stands alone), Byron, Shelley, Keats, Campbell, Moore, were all in the field as poets, carrying the young world with them, and replacing their immediate predecessors, Cowper, Thompson, Young, Beattie, and others of less note.  Sir Walter Scott had also risen high above the horizon as a poet, and still higher as a novelist.  A great start in periodical literature was made in 1802 by the establishment of _The Edinburgh Review_, under Jeffrey and Sydney Smith, and again in 1817 by the publication of _Blackmoods Magazine_, with Christopher North for its editor, and Lockhart, De Quincey, Hogg, and Delta among its earlier contributors. The people's friend, Charles Knight, was still editing _The Windsor and Eton Express_.  In 1819 Sir Humphry Davy was the most popular exponent of science, Sir James Mackintosh of philosophy. In politics, above the thunderstorm of discontent, there was again the pause which anticipates a fresh advance. The great Whig and Tory statesmen, Charles James Fox and William Pitt, were dead in 1806, and their mantles did not fall immediately on fit successors. The abolition of the slave-trade, for which Wilberforce, Zachary Macaulay, and Clarkson had fought gallantly and devotedly, was accomplished. But the Catholic Emancipation Bill was still to work its way in the teeth of bitter \"No Popery\" traditions, and Earl Grey's Reform Bill had not yet seen the light.  George III.'s long reign was drawing to a close. What changes it had seen from the War of American Independence to Waterloo! What woeful personal contrasts since the honest, kindly, comely lad, in his simple kingliness, rode out in the summer sunshine past Holland House, where lady Sarah Lennox was making hay on the lawn, to the days when the blind, mad old king sat in bodily and mental darkness, isolated from the wife and children he had loved so well, immured in his distant palace-rooms in royal Windsor.    His silver beard o'er a bosom spread     Unvexed by life's commotion,   Like a yearly lengthening snow-drift shed     On the calm of a frozen ocean:    Still o'er him oblivion's waters lay,     Though the stream of time kept flowing   When they spoke of our King, 'twas but to say     That the old man's strength was going.    At intervals thus the waves disgorge,     By weakness rent asunder,   A piece of the wreck of the _Royal George_     For the people's pity and wonder.  Lady Sarah, too, became blind in her age, and, alas! she had trodden darker paths than any prepared for her feet by the visitation of God.  Queen Charlotte had come with her sense and spirit, and ruled for more than fifty years over a pure Court in England. The German princess of sixteen, with her spare little person and large mouth which prevented her from being comely, and her solitary accomplishment of playing on the harpsichord with as much correctness and taste as if she had been taught by Mr. Handel himself, had identified herself with the nation, so that no suspicion of foreign proclivities ever attached to her. Queen Charlotte bore her trials gravely; while those who came nearest to her could tell that she was not only a fierce little dragon of virtue, as she has been described, but a loving woman, full of love's wounds and scars.  The family of George III. and Queen Charlotte consisted of seven sons and his daughters, besides two sons who died in infancy.  George, Prince of Wales, married, 1795, his cousin, Princess Caroline of Brunswick, daughter of the reigning Duke and of Princess Augusta, sister of George III. The Prince and Princess of Wales separated soon after their marriage. Their only child was Princess Charlotte of Wales.  Frederick, Duke of York, married, 1791, Princess Frederica, daughter of the reigning King of Prussia. The couple were childless.  William, Duke of Clarence, married, 1818, Princess Adelaide, of Saxe-Meiningen. Two daughters were born to them, but both died in infancy.  Edward, Duke of Kent, married, 1818, Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg, widow of the Prince of Leiningen. Their only child is QUEEN VICTORIA.  Ernest, Duke of Cumberland, married, 1815, Princess Frederica of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, widow, first of Prince Frederick Louis of Prussia, and second, of the Prince of Saliris-Braunfels. Their only child was George V., King of Hanover.  Augustus, Duke of Sussex, married morganatically.  Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge, married, 1818, Princess Augusta of Hesse-Cassel, daughter of the Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel. They had three children--George, Duke of Cambridge; Princess Augusta, Duchess of Mecklenburg-Strelitz; and Princess Mary, Duchess of Teck.  The daughters of King George and Queen Charlotte were:--  The Princess Royal, married, 1797, the Prince, afterwards King, of Wurtemberg. Childless.  Princess Augusta, unmarried.  Princess Elizabeth, married, 1818, the Landgrave of Hesse-Homburg. Childless.  Princess Mary, married, 1816, her cousin, William, Duke of Gloucester. Childless.  Princess Sophia, unmarried.  Princess Amelia, unmarried.  In 1817 the pathetic idyl, wrought out amidst harsh discord, had found its earthly close in the family vault at Windsor, amidst the lamentations of the whole nation. Princess Charlotte, the candid, fearless, affectionate girl, whose youth had been clouded by the sins and follies of others, but to whom the country had turned as to a stay for the future--fragile, indeed, yet still full of hope--had wedded well, known a year of blissful companionship, and then died in giving birth to a dead heir. It is sixty-five years since that November day, when the bonfires, ready to be lit at every town \"cross,\" on every hill-side, remained dark and cold. Men looked at each other in blank dismay; women wept for the blushing, smiling bride, who had driven with her grandmother through the park on her way to be married not so many months before. There are comparatively few people alive who had come to man's or woman's estate when the shock was experienced; but we have all heard from our predecessors the story which has lent to Claremont a tender, pensive grace, especially for royal young pairs.  Old Queen Charlotte nerved herself to make a last public appearance on the 11th of July, 1818, four months before her death. It was in her presence, at Kew, that a royal marriage and re-marriage were celebrated that day. The Duke of Clarence was married to Princess Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen, and the Duke of Kent was re-married, in strict accordance with the English Royal Marriage Act, to Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg, the widowed Princess of Leiningen. The last couple had been already united at Coburg in the month of May. The Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of London officiated at the double ceremony. The brides were given away by the Prince Regent. The Queen retired immediately afterwards. But a grand banquet, at which the Prince Regent presided, was given at six o'clock in the evening. An hour later the Duke and Duchess of Kent drove off in her brother, Prince Leopold's, carriage to Claremont.  Of the two bridegrooms we have glimpses from Baron Stockmar, a shrewd observer, who was no flatterer.  The Duke of Clarence, at fifty-three years of age, was the \"smallest and least good-looking of the brothers, decidedly like his mother, as talkative as the rest;\" and we may add that he was also endowed with a sailor-like frankness, cordiality, and good humour, which did not, however, prevent stormy ebullitions of temper, that recommended him to the nation of that day as a specimen of a princely blue-jacket. Since the navy was not considered a school of manners, he was excused for the absence of much culture or refinement.  \"The Duke of Kent, at fifty-one, was a tall, stately man, of soldierlike bearing, already inclined to great corpulence.... He had seen much of the world, and of men. His manner in society was pleasant and easy. He was not without ability and culture, and he possessed great activity. His dependents complained of his strictness and pedantic love of order.... The Duke was well aware that his influence was but small, but this did not prevent him from forwarding the petitions he received whenever it was possible, with his own recommendation, to the public departments.... Liberal political principles were at that time in the minority in England, and as the Duke professed them, it can be imagined how he was hated by the powerful party then dominant. He was on most unfriendly terms with his brothers.... The Duke proved an amiable and courteous, even chivalrous, husband.\"  Judiciously, in the circumstances, neither of the brides was in her first youth, the future Queen Adelaide having been, at twenty-six, the younger of the two. The Duchess of Kent, a little over thirty, had been already married, in 1803, when she was seventeen, to Prince Emich Charles of Leiningen. Eleven years afterwards, in 1814, she was left a widow with a son and daughter. Four years later she married the Duke of Kent. The brides were very different in looks and outward attractions. The Duchess of Clarence, with "]]]
