For I had planned to send two or three men to explore the neighborhood of the Trois Rivières, and ascertain what there was there. This, to my great regret, I was unable to accomplish, and postponed the project to the first opportunity that might present itself.  Meanwhile I urged on the repairs to our barque. When it was ready, a young man from La Rochelle, named Tresart, asked me to permit him to accompany me to the above-mentioned fall. This I refused, replying that I had special plans of my own, and that I did not wish to conduct any one to my prejudice, adding that there were other companies than mine there, and that I did not care to open up a way and serve as guide, and that he could make the voyage well enough alone and without my help.  The same day I set out from Quebec, and arrived at the great fall on the twenty-eighth of May. But I found none of the savages who had promised me to be there on this day. I entered at once a poor canoe, together with the savage I had taken to France and one of my own men. After examining the two shores, both in the woods and on the river bank, in order to find a spot favorable for the location of a settlement, and to get a place ready for building, I went some eight leagues by land along the great fall and through the woods, which are very open, as far as a lake, [4] whither our savage conducted me. Here I observed the country very carefully. But in all that I saw, I found no place more favorable than a little spot to which barques and shallops can easily ascend, with the help of a strong wind or by taking a winding course, in consequence of the strong current. But above this place, which we named _La Place Royale_, at the distance of a league from Mont Royal, there are a great many little rocks and shoals, which are very dangerous. Near Place Royale there is a little river, extending some distance into the interior, along the entire length of which there are more than sixty acres of land cleared up and like meadows, where grain can be sown and gardens made. Formerly savages tilled these lands, [5] but they abandoned them on account of their wars, in which they were constantly engaged. There is also a large number of other fine pastures, where any number of cattle can graze. There are also the various kinds of trees found in France, together with many vines, nut and plum trees, cherries, strawberries, and other kinds of good fruit. Among the rest there is a very excellent one, with a sweet taste like that of plantains, a fruit of the Indies, as white as snow, with a leaf resembling that of nettles, and which creeps up the trees and along the ground like ivy. [6] Fish are very abundant, including all the varieties we have in France, and many very good ones which we do not have. Game is also plenty, the birds being of various kinds. There are stags, hinds, does, caribous, [7] rabbits, lynxes, [8] bears, beavers, also other small animals, and all in such large numbers, that while we were at the fall we were abundantly supplied with them.  After a careful examination, we found this place one of the finest on this river. I accordingly forthwith gave orders to cut down and clear up the woods in the Place Royale, [9] so as to level it and prepare it for building. The water can easily be made to flow around it, making of it a little island, so that a habitation can be formed as one may wish.  There is a little island some twenty fathoms from Place Royale, about a hundred paces long, where a good and strong settlement might be made. There are also many meadows, containing very good and rich potter's clay, as well adapted for brick as for building purposes, and consequently a very useful article. I had a portion of it worked up, from which I made a wall four feet thick, three or four high, and ten fathoms long, to see how it would stand during the winter, when the freshets came down, although I thought the water would not reach up to it, the ground there being twelve feet above the river, which was very high. In the middle of the river there was an island about three-quarters of a league around, where a good and strong town could be built. This we named _Isle de Sainte Hélène_. [10] This river at the fall is like a lake, containing two or three islands, and bordered by fine meadows.  On the first day of June, Pont Gravé arrived at the fall, having been unable to accomplish anything at Tadoussac. A numerous company attended and followed after him to share in the booty, without the hope of which they would have been far in the rear.  Now, while awaiting the savages, I had two gardens made, one in the meadows, the other in the woods, which I had cleared up. On the 2d of June I sowed some seeds, all of which came up finely, and in a short time, attesting the good quality of the soil.  We resolved to send Savignon, our savage, together with another, to meet his countrymen, so as to hasten their arrival. They hesitated about going in our canoe, of which they were distrustful, it being a very poor one. They set out on the 5th. The next day four or five barques arrived as an escort for us, since they could do nothing at Tadoussac.  On the 7th I went to explore a little river, along which the savages sometimes go to war, and which flows into the fall of the river of the Iroquois. [11] It is very pleasant, with meadow land more than three leagues in circuit, and much arable land. It is distant a league from the great fall, and a league and a half from Place Royale.  On the 9th our savage arrived. He had gone somewhat beyond the lake, which is ten leagues long, and which I had seen before. [12] But he met no one, and they were unable to go any farther, as their canoe gave out, which obliged them to return. They reported that after passing the fall they saw an island, where there was such a quantity of herons that the air was completely filled with them. There was a young man belonging to Sieur de Monts named Louis, who was very fond of the chase. Hearing this, he wished to go and satisfy his curiosity, earnestly entreating our savage to take him to the place. To this the savage consented, taking also a captain of the Montagnais, a very respectable person, whose name was _Outetoucos_. On the following morning Louis caused the two savages to be called, and went with them in a canoe to the island of the herons. This island is in the middle of the fall. [13] Here they captured as many herons and other birds as they wanted, and embarked again in their canoe.  Outetoucos, contrary to the wish of the other savage, and against his remonstrances, desired to pass through a very dangerous place, where the water fell more than three feet, saying that he had formerly gone this way, which, however, was false. He had a long discussion in opposition to our savage, who wished to take him on the south side, along the mainland, [14] where they usually go. This, however, Outetoucos did not wish, saying that there was no danger. Our savage finding him obstinate yielded to his desire. But he insisted that at least a part of the birds in the canoe should be taken out, as it was overloaded, otherwise he said it would inevitably fill and be lost. But to this he would not consent, saying that it would be time enough when they found themselves in the presence of danger. They accordingly permitted themselves to be carried along by the current. But when they reached the precipice, they wanted to throw overboard their load in order to escape. It was now, however, too late, for they were completely in the power of the rapid water, and were straightway swallowed up in the whirlpools of the fall, which turned them round a thousand times. For a long time they clung to the boat. Finally the swiftness of the water wearied them so that this poor Louis, who could not swim at all, entirely lost his presence of mind, and, the canoe going down, he was obliged to abandon it. As it returned to the surface, the two others who kept holding on to it, saw Louis no more, and thus he died a sad death. [15] The two others continued to hold on to the canoe. When, however, they were out of danger, this Outetoucos, being naked and having confidence in his swimming powers, abandoned it in the expectation of reaching the shore, although the water still ran there with great rapidity.  But he was drowned, for he had been so weakened and overcome by his efforts that it was impossible for him to save himself after abandoning the canoe. Our savage Savignon, understanding himself better, held firmly to the canoe until it reached an eddy, whither the current had carried it. Here he managed so well that, notwithstanding his suffering and weariness, he approached the shore gradually, when, after throwing the water out of the canoe, he returned in great fear that they would take vengeance upon him, as the savages do among themselves, and related to us this sad story, which caused us great sorrow.  On the next day I went in another canoe to the fall, together with the savage and another member of our company, to see the place where they had met with their accident, and find, if possible, the remains. But when he showed me the spot, I was horrified at beholding such a terrible place, and astonished that the deceased should have been so lacking in judgment as to pass through such a fearful place, when they could have gone another way. For it is impossible to go along there, as there are seven or eight descents of water one after the other, the lowest three feet high, the seething and boiling of the water being fearful. A part of the fall was all white with foam, indicating the worst spot, the noise of which was like thunder, the air resounding with the echo of the cataracts. After viewing and carefully examining this place, and searching along the river bank for the dead bodies, another very light shallop having proceeded meanwhile on the other bank also, we returned without"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6836"],["title","Three Men and a Maid (#1)"],["body","the _Atlantic_.\"  \"That's splendid,\" said Sam. \"I'm sailing on the _Atlantic_ myself. I'll go down to the office and see if we can't have a state-room together. But where is he going to live when he gets to England?\"  \"Where is he going to live? Why, at Windles, of course. Where else?\"  \"But I thought you were letting Windles for the summer?\"  Mrs. Hignett stared.  \"Letting Windles!\" She spoke as one might address a lunatic. \"What put that extraordinary idea into your head?\"  \"I thought father said something about your letting the place to some American.\"  \"Nothing of the kind!\"  It seemed to Sam that his aunt spoke somewhat vehemently, even snappishly, in correcting what was a perfectly natural mistake. He could not know that the subject of letting Windles for the summer was one which had long since begun to infuriate Mrs. Hignett. People had certainly asked her to let Windles. In fact people had pestered her. There was a rich fat man, an American named Bennett, whom she had met just before sailing at her brother's house in London. Invited down to Windles for the day, Mr. Bennett had fallen in love with the place and had begged her to name her own price. Not content with this, he had pursued her with his pleadings by means of the wireless telegraph while she was on the ocean, and had not given up the struggle even when she reached New York. He had egged on a friend of his, a Mr. Mortimer, to continue the persecution in that city. And, this very morning, among the letters on Mrs. Hignett's table, the buff envelope of a cable from Mr. Bennett had peeped out, nearly spoiling her breakfast. No wonder, then, that Sam's allusion to the affair had caused the authoress of \"The Spreading Light\" momentarily to lose her customary calm.  \"Nothing will induce me ever to let Windles,\" she said with finality, and rose significantly. Sam, perceiving that the audience was at an end--and glad of it--also got up.  \"Well, I think I'll be going down and seeing about that state-room,\" he said.  \"Certainly. I am a little busy just now, preparing notes for my next lecture.\"  \"Of course, yes. Mustn't interrupt you. I suppose you're having a great time, gassing away--I mean--well, good-bye!\"  \"Good-bye!\"  Mrs. Hignett, frowning, for the interview had ruffled her and disturbed that equable frame of mind which is so vital to the preparation of lectures on Theosophy, sat down at the writing-table and began to go through the notes which she had made overnight. She had hardly succeeded in concentrating herself when the door opened to admit the daughter of Erin once more.  \"Ma'am there was a gentleman.\"  \"This is intolerable!\" cried Mrs. Hignett. \"Did you tell him that I was busy?\"  \"I did not. I loosed him into the dining-room.\"  \"Is he a reporter from one of the newspapers?\"  \"He is not. He has spats and a tall-shaped hat. His name is Bream Mortimer.\"  \"Bream Mortimer!\"  \"Yes, ma'am. He handed me a bit of a kyard, but I dropped it, being slippy from the dishes.\"  Mrs. Hignett strode to the door with a forbidding expression. This, as she had justly remarked, was intolerable. She remembered Bream Mortimer. He was the son of the Mr. Mortimer who was the friend of the Mr. Bennett who wanted Windles. This visit could only have to do with the subject of Windles, and she went into the dining-room in a state of cold fury, determined to squash the Mortimer family once and for all.  Bream Mortimer was tall and thin. He had small, bright eyes and a sharply curving nose. He looked much more like a parrot than most parrots do. It gave strangers a momentary shock of surprise when they saw Bream Mortimer in restaurants eating roast beef. They had the feeling that he would have preferred sun-flower seeds.  \"Morning, Mrs. Hignett.\"  \"Please sit down.\"  Bream Mortimer sat down. He looked as though he would rather have hopped on to a perch, but he sat down. He glanced about the room with gleaming, excited eyes.  \"Mrs. Hignett, I must have a word with you alone!\"  \"You _are_ having a word with me alone.\"  \"I hardly know how to begin.\"  \"Then let me help you. It is quite impossible. I will never consent.\"  Bream Mortimer started.  \"Then you have heard!\"  \"I have heard about nothing else since I met Mr. Bennett in London. Mr. Bennett talked about nothing else. Your father talked about nothing else. And now,\" cried Mrs. Hignett fiercely, \"you come and try to reopen the subject. Once and for all nothing will alter my decision. No money will induce me to let my house.\"  \"But I didn't come about that!\"  \"You did not come about Windles?\"  \"Good Lord, no!\"  \"Then will you kindly tell me why you have come?\"  Bream Mortimer looked embarrassed. He wriggled a little and moved his arms as if he were trying to flap them.  \"You know,\" he said, \"I'm not a man who butts into other people's affairs.\" ... He stopped.  \"No?\" said Mrs. Hignett.  Bream began again.  \"I'm not a man who gossips with servants.\"  \"No?\"  \"I'm not a man who....\"  Mrs. Hignett was never a very patient woman.  \"Let us take all your negative qualities for granted,\" she said curtly. \"I have no doubt that there are many things which you do not do. Let us confine ourselves to issues of definite importance. What is it, if you have no objection to concentrating your attention on that for a moment, that you wish to see me about?\"  \"This marriage.\"  \"What marriage?\"  \"Your son's marriage.\"  \"My son is not married.\"  \"No, but he's going to be. At eleven o'clock this morning at the Little Church Round the Corner!\"  Mrs. Hignett stared.  \"Are you mad?\"  \"Well, I'm not any too well pleased, I'm bound to say,\" admitted Mr. Mortimer. \"You see, darn it all, I'm in love with the girl myself!\"  \"Who is this girl?\"  \"Have been for years. I'm one of those silent, patient fellows who hang around and look a lot, but never tell their love....\"  \"Who is this girl who has entrapped my son?\"  \"I've always been one of those men who....\"  \"Mr. Mortimer! With your permission we will take your positive qualities, also, for granted. In fact, we will not discuss you at all. You come to me with this absurd story....\"  \"Not absurd. Honest fact. I had it from my valet, who had it from her maid, and, though I'm not a man who gossips with servants, I'm bound to say....\"  \"Will you please tell me who is the girl my misguided son wishes to marry?\"  \"I don't know that I'd call him misguided,\" said Mr. Mortimer, as one desiring to be fair, \"I think he's a right smart picker! She's such a corking girl, you know. We were children together, and I've loved her for years. Ten years at least. But you know how it is--somehow one never seems to get in line for a proposal. I thought I saw an opening in the summer of nineteen-twelve, but it blew over. I'm not one of these smooth, dashing guys, you see, with a great line of talk. I'm not....\"  \"If you will kindly,\" said Mrs. Hignett impatiently, \"postpone this essay in psycho-analysis to some future occasion I shall be greatly obliged. I am waiting to hear the name of the girl my son wishes to marry.\"  \"Haven't I told you?\" said Mr. Mortimer, surprised. \"That's odd. I haven't! It's funny how one doesn't do the things one thinks one does. I'm the sort of man...\"  \"What is her name?\"  \"Bennett.\"  \"Bennett? Wilhelmina Bennett? The daughter of Mr. Rufus Bennett? The red-haired girl I met at lunch one day at your father's house?\"  \"That's it. You're a great guesser. I think you ought to stop the thing.\"  \"I intend to.\"  \"Fine!\"  \"The marriage would be unsuitable in every way. Miss Bennett and my son do not vibrate on the same plane.\"  \"That's right. I've noticed it myself.\"  \"Their auras are not the same colour.\"  \"If I've thought that once,\" said Bream Mortimer, \"I've thought it a hundred times. I wish I had a dollar for every time I've thought it. Not the same colour! That's the whole thing in a nutshell.\"  \"I am much obliged to you for coming and telling me of this. I shall take immediate steps.\"  \"That's good! But what's the procedure? How are you going to form a flying-wedge and buck-centre? It's getting late. She'll be waiting at the church at eleven. With bells on,\" said Mr. Mortimer.  \"Eustace will not be there.\"  \"You think you can fix it?\"  \"Eustace will not be there,\" repeated Mrs. Hignett.  Bream Mortimer hopped down from his chair.  \"Well, you've taken a weight off my mind.\"  \"A mind, I should imagine, scarcely constructed to bear great weights.\"  \"I'll be going. Haven't had breakfast yet. Too worried to eat breakfast. Relieved now. This is where three eggs and a rasher of ham get cut off in their prime. I feel I can rely on you.\"  \"You can!\"  \"Then I'll say good-bye.\"  \"Good-bye.\"  \"I mean really good-bye. I'm sailing for England on Saturday on the _Atlantic_.\"  \"Indeed? My son will be your fellow-traveller.\"  Bream Mortimer looked somewhat apprehensive.  \"You won't tell him that I was the one who spilled the beans?\"  \"I beg your pardon.\"  \"You won't wise him up that I threw a spanner into the machinery?\"  \"I do not understand you.\"  \"You won't tell him that I crabbed his act--gave the thing away--gummed the game?\"  \"I shall not mention your chivalrous intervention.\"  \"Chivalrous?\" said Bream Mortimer doubtfully. \"I don't know that I'd call it absolutely chivalrous. Of course, all's fair in love and war. Well, I'm glad you're going to keep my share in the business under your hat. It might have been awkward meeting him on board.\"  \"You are not likely to meet Eustace on board. He is a very indifferent sailor and spends most of his time in his cabin.\"  \"That's good! Saves a lot of awkwardness. Well, good-bye.\"  \"Good-bye. When you reach England remember me to your father.\"  \"He won't have forgotten you,\" said Bream Mortimer confidently. He did not see how it was humanly possible for anyone to forget this woman. She was like a celebrated chewing-gum. The taste lingered.  Mrs. Hignett was a woman of instant and decisive action.
