It may be separated from the noun: _na doo nia gi_ his things; _gi_ is used with the forms of the personal pronoun plural except those ending in _lu_.  8. _Mwai_ is used with nouns of relationship only: _mwai asi nia_ his brethren, _ro mwai sasina_ brethren.  9. In Port Adam _ote_ seems to be employed as a regular plural article: _ote mwane gi_ you men. But it is a question whether _ote_ is not properly employed of females only: _ote aia nia_ his female relations, _ote sasina_ his sisters, _ote ai_ you women, _ote ai gi_ you women.  10. _A_ is used as a personal article with the names of males, both native and foreign: _a Leo_, _a Joe_. It is used also with _doo_ thing: _a doo_ so and so, _a doo na_ the person.  _Ni_ is used as a personal article with the names of females, both native and foreign: _ni Alida_, _ni Mary_. It is used also with certain nouns which denote women, where in Sa'a _nga_ or the personal article _a_ is used: _ni te nau_ my mother, _ni mwaemwane_ a man's sister, a woman's brother, _ni aia_ female relations, _ni doo_ the woman, _ni mwela ne_ that woman. _Ni_ is not used with _afe_ wife, nor with _geni_ female; it is not used with the plural.   NOUNS.  1. Nouns to which possessive suffixes may be added:  Certain nouns take the suffixed pronoun denoting the possessor. These are nouns denoting:  a. Parts of the body: _lima_ hand, _limagu_ my hand, _aba_ arm, _abamu_ thy arm, _maa_ eye, _maamu_ thy eye.  b. Position, end, middle, top: _buri_ behind, _burigu_ behind me, _i dalumana_ in the midst, _isingana_ its end, _i kamena lobo_ beside the lake, _i fafona_ on top of it.  c. Certain states or doings of men: life, death, speech, custom, goings: _mae_ to die, _maela_ death, _maelana_ his death, _baela_ speech, _baelagu_ my word.  d. The word _sasi_ brother, _sasigu_ my brother, my sister. The other words denoting relationship employ the personal pronoun to denote possession.  2. Formation of nouns: Nouns which have a special termination showing them to be nouns substantive are (a) verbal nouns and (b) independent nouns.  a. Verbal nouns are formed from verbs by the terminations _a_, _fa_, _la_, _ta_: _mae_ to die, _maea_ death or sickness, _maela_ death, _bae_ to speak, _baea_ word, _baela_ speech, _fanga_ to eat, _fangaa_ feast, food, _fangala_ food, _mae_ to die, _maemaefa_ sickness, _nao_ to lead, _naofa_ first, _naofe mwela_ eldest child, also with suffixed pronoun _naofana mwela_; _ta_ is seen in the root _afuta_ all, which is used only with the suffixed pronoun, _afutagera_ all of them, _afutana na ai gi_ all the people. The termination _la_ has a more or less gerundival force.  Compound nouns may be formed, _girigiri lifoa_ gnashing of teeth, _saitama dooa_ wisdom.  Where in the vocabulary _fa_ and _ta_ have a hyphen attached, it is intended to show that they are used only with the suffixed pronoun attached.  There are certain adjectives to which the termination _la_ is attached, _diena_ good, _dienala_ goodness, _baita_ big, _baitala_ bigness, and _tasa_ in excess, _tasala_ excess. It is probable, however, that these words are really verbs.  b. Independent nouns: The only termination is na, and this is added (1) to certain nouns which express relation ship or kindred; (2) to cardinal numerals to form ordinals. 1. Nouns so formed are always preceded by a prefix which marks reciprocity of relationship or kindred, _mwai_, and by the numeral _ro_ two; _sasi_ brother, _ro mwai sasina_ the two brothers, _te_ mother, _ro mwai telana_ wife and child.  2. Numerals: _olu_ three, _oluna_ third.  3. Construct form: To make a construct form the letter _e_ is added to the first of two nouns, _toloe fera_ hill, _fuli abae ai_ men's handwork. When the first member ends in _a_ the _ae_ sometimes contracts to _e_, _fufue ai_ seed, _aqale mwai_ ten baskets, but _maae rodo_, a night; also when the first noun ends in _o_ the _oe_ is contracted to _e_: _abole ai_ a log, _abolo_ a piece. This _e_ may be added to words which have not a distinct noun termination: _naoe gula_ the chief place.  4. Genitive relation: The genitive relation of nouns one to another is effected by the use of the propositions _ni_ and _i_: _ni_ is used mainly in construction: _baea ni sugela_ deceitful words, _gwai ni gwaila_ anointing oil; _ni_ expresses purpose: _si gula ni lea inia_ a place for him to go to, _rosuli ni manatai gami_ hear us in mercy. In certain words _li_ replaces _ni_: _maalimaea_ enemy, _maalitafa_ a channel in a reef; _i_ is used also to denote purpose: _lea i fasifa_ came to sell it. Location, which also denotes place whence, is shown by _i_, _geni i Saa_, a Sa'a woman. _Si_ is used in certain phrases: _ofu si doo_ bundles, _ro tooni si doo_ two thousand.  The genitive is frequently omitted _olu teu flour_, three measures of flour, _mumudi fangala_ crumbs of food, _mwane Saa_, a Sa'a man, _falisi vine_ a vineyard.  The possessive _ana_ may be used to denote the genitive: _luma ana foaa_ house of prayer, _tala ana fanualama_ way of peace. A genitive relation is also shown by the use of the suffixed pronoun of the third person singular or plural in agreement with the idea expressed in the second noun of the pair: _i tolona fera_ on the tops of the hills, _gwouda na ai gi_ men's heads.  The ordinary personal pronouns are used as possessive in cases where the pronoun can not be suffixed: _afe nau_ my wife, _arai nia_ her husband.  The instrumental prefix i occurs: _kamu_ to eat areca nut, _ikamu_ a line spatula.  5. Plural: To show plurality _gi_ is used, following the noun _na mwane gi_ the men. The word _oro_, many, may be attached: _na mwane oro gi_ many men, _tani ai oro_ many people.  The personal pronoun plural third _gera_ is used to mark plurality: _gera fiolo_ the hungry, _gera priest da adea urina_ the priests acted thus.  Totally and completion are shown by _sui_ finished or _sui na_: _afutada sui_ they all, _gera lea sui na_ they have gone already. To express totality the suffixed pronoun singular third and all persons plural are added to a root _afuta_, formed from _afu_ to complete, with _ta_ noun termination: _afutanafera_ all the land, _afutana nonigu_ all my whole body. It is a question whether the numeral _qalu_ eight is used like _walu_ in Sa'a of an indefinite number, e.g., _qalu fera_ all lands; but _te si nafera_ seems to be the proper usage.  6. Gender: There is no grammatical gender. The words _mwane_ male, _geni_ female, are added when the noun does not carry a sex distinction.  7. Nouns of relationship: With the exception of sasi brother, sister, nouns of relationship are never used with a suffixed pronoun: _maa nau_ my father. The prefix _mwai_, denoting reciprocity of relationship, may precede: _mwai asi nau_ brethren. In speaking of pairs of people _ro_ is used: _ro mwai sasina_ two brothers. The _na_ of _sasina_, _telana_, etc., is a noun termination and is not the suffixed pronoun.  The articles _ni_ for the singular and _ote_ for the plural are used of women: _ni aia_ a female relation, _ote geni_ women.  The word for father is _maa_; the article _na_ may be prefixed: _na maa nau_ my father. The Rev. A. I.  Hopkins says that _maaka nau_ is also commonly used as meaning my father. The word for child is _mwela_, _mwela na ai_ So-and-So's son, _mwela nia_ his child; _aia_ is used for female relations with _ni_ as singular article and _ote_ as plural: _mwaemwane_ sister, _ni mwaemwane_ a man's sister.  The adjective _gale_ little, is used preceding the noun to describe something young: _ro fe gale bola_ two young pigeons. The article used with _te_, mother, is _ni_: _ni te nau_ my mother; _ta ro mwai telana nau_ my wife and child, _ta ro mwai fungona_ two relations-at-law; _ai_ person, man, is used as a vocative: _mwela ai_ hey, you there! _na ai oe_ your people, _ai ni raoa_ a servant, _ai tou_ the little one, the lesser.   PRONOUNS.  The pronouns may be classified as (A) those used as the subject of a verb; (B) those suffixed to a verb or a preposition as object; (c) those suffixed to nouns substantive and denoting possession.  A.   PRONOUNS USED AS THE SUBJECT OF A VERB.  Singular:   (1) _inau, naut gu_.   (2) _ioe, oe, o_.   (3) _inia, niat nit e_.  Plural:   Inclusive:    (1) _igia, gia; igolu, golu_.   Exclusive:    (1) _igami, gami, mi; igamelu, gamelu_.                 (2) _igamu, gamu; igamolu, gamolu_.                 (3) _igera, gera, da; idalu, dalu_.  Dual:   Inclusive:    (1) _igoro, goro_.   Exclusive:    (1) _igamere, gamere_.                 (2) _igamoro, gamoro_.                 (3) _idarot daro_.  1. The longer forms, those with _i_, are used as possessive pronouns when the suffixed pronoun can not be added: _geni inau_ my wife.  The forms with _i_ are never used by themselves as the subject, but are accompanied by one of the shorter forms: _igera da ada ma da si ada na_ they see but do not see. The three longer forms in the singular are of more or less infrequent use. The initial _i_ is run on to the preceding vowel in pronunciation.  2. All the forms without _i_ are used alone as the subject of the verb. Where there are three forms the second and third are generally used together as subjects: _gami mi langi si saetamana_ we do not know; but the short forms _gu_, _o_, _mi_, _mu_, _da_, may be used alone as subjects: _gu si saea_ I do not know. The forms in _lu_ are not used as a trial number, but denote a more restricted number of persons.  3. _Nia_ is used as meaning, there is, it is: _efita fe bread nia agamolu_, how many loaves have you? It may be used before a proper name as the equivalent to a genitive:"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5762"],["title","Grammar and Vocabulary of the Lau Language, Solomon Islands (#2)"],["body","maaedangi nia Abiathar_ in the days of Abiathar. When the meaning is, there is, it is, _nia_ is preceded by _e_: _na liqa gera enia ada_ they have their holes; _ma te ai enia i luma_ there is only one person in the house; with _na_ demonstrative added: _nia na_ that is it, that is so.  4. The form _ni_ is seen in _nifai_ what? where? It occurs in certain phrases as meaning, it is, there is: _e uta ro si lio ni agamu_ how is it ye are of two minds? _na light fuana noni ni maa_ the light of the body it is the eye.  5. The plural sign _gi_ is used with the forms in the plural but not with those ending in _lu_: _gia gi fi dao na_ we have just come.  6. The forms in the plural third _igera_ and _gera_ are used as equivalent to a plural article: _igera na judea_ the Jews.  7. The pronouns of the third person singular and plural may be used of impersonal or inanimate things.  B.   PRONOUNS SUFFIXED TO VERBS OR TO PREPOSITIONS AS OBJECT.  Singular: (1) _nau_. (2) _oe_. (3) _a_.  Plural:   Inclusive: (1) _gia_, _golu_.   Exclusive: (1) _gami_, _gamelu_. (2) _gamu_, _gamolu_.              (3) _gera_, _da_, _dalu_.  Dual:   Inclusive: (1) _goro_.   Exclusive: (1) _gamere_. (2) _gamoro_. (3) _daro_.  1. Examples of usage are, _gera saegera sui_ they were all summoned, _nia lea fonosia_ he went to get it. A second object of the verb always appears in the suffixed pronoun singular and plural third: _gu langi si adasia na ola_ I did not see a canoe, _gera gutafigera na mwane gi_ they persecuted the men.  All prepositions governing nouns have the pronoun suffixed as an anticipatory object in agreement with the noun: _gera lea fonosia fera_ they went to harm the land, _fafia si doo_ concerning the matter.  2. The verb _dori_ (to wish) has the pronoun suffixed where in Sa'a none would be used: _nia langi si doria gwou ana_ he would not drink (it) of it.  3. To _taifili_ (alone) the pronouns are suffixed: _te taifilia_ he alone, _taifiligera_ they alone.  C.   PRONOUNS SUFFIXED TO NOUNS OR TO VERBAL NOUNS USED AS PREPOSITIONS.  Singular: (1) _gu_. (2) _mu_. (3) _na_.  Plural:   Inclusive: (1) _gia_, _golu_.   Exclusive: (1) _gami_, _gamelu_. (2) _gamu_, _gamolu_. (3) _gera_, _da_, _dalu_.  Dual:   Inclusive: (1) _goro_.   Exclusive: (1) _gamere_. (2) _gamoro_. (3) _dar   1. These are the pronouns denoting possession and they are suffixed to a certain class of nouns only, those which denote names of parts of the body, or of family relationship, or of things in close relationship to the possessor.  In all other cases possession is denoted by the use of the ordinary personal pronouns.  2. When things and not persons are in question _ni_ is used in place of _da_ in plural third: _lea alua i fulini_ go and put them in their places.  3. Of the plural forms those ending in _lu_ denote a restriction in the number of the persons concerned.  4. These pronouns are also suffixed to the preposition _fua_ to, used as a dative, to _afuta_ all, and to certain other words which show a noun termination but which have no independent existence as nouns: _otofa_ concerning, _oofa_ approaching to, enceinte, _sie_, at the house of (in the vocabulary all such words are followed by a hyphen); also to _mara_ of one's own accord, alone, _te taifilia marana_ he alone; also to the verb _too_ to hit, _toogu_, _toona_, hit me, etc.   DEMONSTRATIVE PRONOUNS.  These are _na_, _ne_, this; _nena_, _nana_, _nane_, that.  1. These all follow a noun or a pronoun: _a mwela ne_ this person, _nia nana_ that is it.  2. _Na_ is added after the negative _langi_: _langi na no_, not that; and after _sui_ finished: _sui na_ that is finished.  3. _Go_ an adverb, there, is used as a demonstrative: _tefe doo go ana_ only one thing, _inau go agu_ I for my part; _ne_ may be added, _gone_ that, _inia gone_ that is so. _Ba_ means that, there: _diena ba_ good! _bago_ is used following a noun or a pronoun: _a doo bago_ that person there.   INTERROGATIVE PRONOUNS.  1. The words used are _ati_, who; _taa, tafa_, what. The personal article _a_ makes _ati_ who, singular, _gerati_ plural.  Both _ti_ and _taa_ are nouns. The adverb _ba_ may be added to _ati_ for the purpose of emphasis: _ati ba_ who? _Ti_ stands for the name of the person and _ati_ means, what is the name? _ati mwane_ what man? The demonstrative _ne_ may be added for emphasis: _ati ne_ who is it then? _Ati_ has also an indefinite use: _ati susulia_ who knows?  2. With _taa_, _tafa_, the definite article _si_ may be used: _si taa_ what, that which, _taa_ may follow the noun, _ta si doo taa_ what sort of thing? _si doo taa ne_ what? The adverb _fai_ (where) may be used as an interrogative pronoun: _nifai_ which, what?   INDEFINITE PRONOUNS.  The uses of _ta_, _te__, have been dealt with under \"articles.\" These two words are used as signifying, any, some, other.  The noun _sai_ place, thing, has an indefinite use: _sai ai_ that which, what, _sai na_ that which, _ta sai ai_, one, another (of things), _sai oe_ your place, your duty, _tani oto ni sai ai_ some people. (The Rev. A. I. Hopkins states in a note that _sai_ in Lau is used of food only).   RELATIVE PRONOUNS.  There are no relative pronouns. Their place is supplied by various locutions.  1. By the suffixed pronoun: _inia nane gu bae kekerofana fasi uri_ this is he of whom I spoke. The addition of the demonstrative _ne, nena_, serves to make the meaning clearer: _inia nena ai garni mi maasia_ he is the person for whom we are waiting.  2. By making use of a coordinate clause: _igami ne too gera ada fuada na_ we are the people whom they have chosen.   POSSESSIVES.  Singular: (1) _agu_. (2) _amu_. (3) _ana_.  Plural:   Inclusive: (1) _aga_, _agolu_.   Exclusive: (1) _agami_, _agamelu_. (2) _agamu_, _agamolu_.              (3) _agera_, _ada_, _adalu_.  Dual:   Inclusive: (1) _agoro_.   Exclusive: (1) _agamere_. (2) _agamoro_. (3) _adaro_.  The possessive is used:  1. Of things to eat and drink: _si fangala agu_ something for me to eat, _o ngalia amu_ take it for your eating, _si doo ana gera priest tafiligera_ food for the priests only.  When the sense relates to food in general and not to a particular meal the ordinary personal pronouns are employed as possessives: _si doo ni gwou inau_ a drink for me.  2. As meaning, for me, for my part, etc., belonging to, at, with: _geni agu_ a wife for me, _nia lea ana_ he went his way, _gu ka gele dau go agu_ if I but touch, _fuana ngalia fera nia agolu_ to get his land for ourselves, _si mamana nia ana_ power in himself, his power, _si doo oro agu_ I have many things, _e langi ana_ not in it, lost, _nia soe agera_ he questioned them, _soea satana ana a doo bago_ ask so-and-so his name, _nia ledia tasi doo agu_ he asked me about something, _ooganga agera_ their debt.  3. As the object of a neuter verb (i. e., a verb which does not take a transitive suffix): _gera da qele ana_ they marvelled at him, _gu ingo amu_ I beseech thee, _dau agu_ touch me, _bota ana_ blessed is he.  4. With verbs when the object is separated from the verb: _nia bubu tete adalu_ he regarded them fixedly, _ka lugatai saufini ana_ let him go secretly, _da bae aisile ana_ they spoke scornfully of him: _ala meme gamu_ to bite and rend you, is a variant.  5. To express, of, from, among: _ati mwane agamu_ what man of you?  6. The forms ending in _lu_ denote a restriction in the number of the people concerned.  7. The adverb _afoa_ apart is also followed by the possessive: _afoa ana_ apart from him.  8. It will be seen that the one possessive in Lau does the work of the three that are used in Sa'a.   A Port Adam man asking for a wife at Sa'a and saying _geni ana_ (as has happened at times) would be asked whether he wanted to eat her--the Sa'a use being _keni nana_, _'ana_ being reserved of things to eat.   ADJECTIVES.  1. Words which are qualifying terms may also be used in the form of verbs, but some may be used without verbal particles and follow the qualified word. _Mwane baita_ a big man, _mwela tou_ a little child.  2. Some words have a form which is used only of adjectives, either of termination or of prefix.  a. Adjectival terminations are: _a_, _la_.  The termination _a_ is suffixed to substantives and verbs: _rodo_ night, _rorodoa_ dark, darkness, cloud; _bulu_ to be black, _bubulua_ black.  _La_ is suffixed to substantives and verbs: _mwai_ a bag, _mwaila_ rich, _kobu_ to be fat, _kobukobula_ fat, whole, big; _tagalo_ to be wandering, _tagalola_ matted, thick, of forest.  b. Adjectival prefixes are _a_, _ma_, _tata_, _m_. These are all prefixed to verbs.  The _a_ is prefixed to verbs to form participles: _luga_ to loose, _aluga_ loose; _la_ to lift up, _alaa_ upwards, up.  _Ma_ denotes condition: _lingi_ to pour, _malingi_ spilled, _ngi_ to divide, _mangisingisi_ broken, divided, _matala_ only, merely; _tefe mwela matala_ an only child.  _Tata_ denotes spontaneity: _tatagwelu_ headlong.  _M_ as a prefix appears to be used in the word _moi_ broken, (Sa'a _'o'i_ to break, _ma'o'i_ broken).  3. Comparison: Degrees of comparison are shown by the use of prepositions or adverbs, or by a simple positive statement. The prepositions used are _fasi_ from, _tasa_ beyond, in excess. The suffixed pronoun is used with _fasi_, but the possessive is used with _tasa_: _na boso nia baita fasia na asufe_ a pig is larger than a rat; _gera baita tasa agera_ these are much larger than those.  The adverbs employed are _gele_ little, somewhat, _asia_ very, too much: _nia baita asia_ it is very (too) large.  A positive statement carries comparison by implication: _doo ne nia baita_ that is biggest, _sai ai ne ni diena, sai ai nena ni taa na_ this is good, that is bad; i.e., this is better than that.   VERBS.  Almost any word may be used as a verb by prefixing the verbal particles, but some words are naturally verbs as being the names of actions and not of things. There are also verbs which have special forms as such by means of a prefix or termination. Verbal particles precede"]]]
