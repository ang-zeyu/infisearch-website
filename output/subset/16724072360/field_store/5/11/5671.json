(_No date_.)     \"MY DEAR SIR,--I am here as yet a fixture, and beg you to come our    way.  Would Tuesday or Wednesday suit you by any chance?  We shall    then, I believe, be empty: a thing favourable to talks.  You get here    in time for dinner.  I stay till near the end of September, unless, as    may very well be, the weather drive me forth.--Yours very sincerely,    ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.\"  I accordingly went to Braemar, where he and his wife and her son were staying with his father and mother.  These were red-letter days in my calendar alike on account of pleasant intercourse with his honoured father and himself.  Here is my pen-and-ink portrait of R. L. Stevenson, thrown down at the time:  Mr Stevenson's is, indeed, a very picturesque and striking figure.  Not so tall probably as he seems at first sight from his extreme thinness, but the pose and air could not be otherwise described than as distinguished.  Head of fine type, carried well on the shoulders and in walking with the impression of being a little thrown back; long brown hair, falling from under a broadish-brimmed Spanish form of soft felt hat, Rembrandtesque; loose kind of Inverness cape when walking, and invariable velvet jacket inside the house.  You would say at first sight, wherever you saw him, that he was a man of intellect, artistic and individual, wholly out of the common.  His face is sensitive, full of expression, though it could not be called strictly beautiful.  It is longish, especially seen in profile, and features a little irregular; the brow at once high and broad.  A hint of vagary, and just a hint in the expression, is qualified by the eyes, which are set rather far apart from each other as seems, and with a most wistful, and at the same time possibly a merry impish expression arising over that, yet frank and clear, piercing, but at the same time steady, and fall on you with a gentle radiance and animation as he speaks.  Romance, if with an indescribable _soupcon_ of whimsicality, is marked upon him; sometimes he has the look as of the Ancient Mariner, and could fix you with his glittering e'e, and he would, as he points his sentences with a movement of his thin white forefinger, when this is not monopolised with the almost incessant cigarette.  There is a faint suggestion of a hair-brained sentimental trace on his countenance, but controlled, after all, by good Scotch sense and shrewdness.  In conversation he is very animated, and likes to ask questions.  A favourite and characteristic attitude with him was to put his foot on a chair or stool and rest his elbow on his knee, with his chin on his hand; or to sit, or rather to half sit, half lean, on the corner of a table or desk, one of his legs swinging freely, and when anything that tickled him was said he would laugh in the heartiest manner, even at the risk of bringing on his cough, which at that time was troublesome.  Often when he got animated he rose and walked about as he spoke, as if movement aided thought and expression.  Though he loved Edinburgh, which was full of associations for him, he had no good word for its east winds, which to him were as death.  Yet he passed one winter as a \"Silverado squatter,\" the story of which he has inimitably told in the volume titled _The Silverado Squatters_; and he afterwards spent several winters at Davos Platz, where, as he said to me, he not only breathed good air, but learned to know with closest intimacy John Addington Symonds, who \"though his books were good, was far finer and more interesting than any of his books.\"  He needed a good deal of nursery attentions, but his invalidism was never obtrusively brought before one in any sympathy-seeking way by himself; on the contrary, a very manly, self-sustaining spirit was evident; and the amount of work which he managed to turn out even when at his worst was truly surprising.  His wife, an American lady, is highly cultured, and is herself an author. In her speech there is just the slightest suggestion of the American accent, which only made it the more pleasing to my ear.  She is heart and soul devoted to her husband, proud of his achievements, and her delight is the consciousness of substantially aiding him in his enterprises.  They then had with them a boy of eleven or twelve, Samuel Lloyd Osbourne, to be much referred to later (a son of Mrs Stevenson by a former marriage), whose delight was to draw the oddest, but perhaps half intentional or unintentional caricatures, funny, in some cases, beyond expression.  His room was designated the picture-gallery, and on entering I could scarce refrain from bursting into laughter, even at the general effect, and, noticing this, and that I was putting some restraint on myself out of respect for the host's feelings, Stevenson said to me with a sly wink and a gentle dig in the ribs, \"It's laugh and be thankful here.\"  On Lloyd's account simple engraving materials, types, and a small printing-press had been procured; and it was Stevenson's delight to make funny poems, stories, and morals for the engravings executed, and all would be duly printed together.  Stevenson's thorough enjoyment of the picture-gallery, and his goodness to Lloyd, becoming himself a very boy for the nonce, were delightful to witness and in degree to share. Wherever they were--at Braemar, in Edinburgh, at Davos Platz, or even at Silverado--the engraving and printing went on.  The mention of the picture-gallery suggests that it was out of his interest in the colour- drawing and the picture-gallery that his first published story, _Treasure Island_, grew, as we shall see.  I have some copies of the rude printing-press productions, inexpressibly quaint, grotesque, a kind of literary horse-play, yet with a certain squint-eyed, sprawling genius in it, and innocent childish Rabelaisian mirth of a sort.  At all events I cannot look at the slight memorials of that time, which I still possess, without laughing afresh till my eyes are dewy.  Stevenson, as I understood, began _Treasure Island_ more to entertain Lloyd Osbourne than anything else; the chapters being regularly read to the family circle as they were written, and with scarcely a purpose beyond.  The lad became Stevenson's trusted companion and collaborator--clearly with a touch of genius.  I have before me as I write some of these funny momentoes of that time, carefully kept, often looked at.  One of them is, \"_The Black Canyon_; _or_, _Wild Adventures in the Far West_: a Tale of Instruction and Amusement for the Young, by Samuel L. Osbourne, printed by the author; Davos Platz,\" with the most remarkable cuts.  It would not do some of the sensationalists anything but good to read it even at this day, since many points in their art are absurdly caricatured.  Another is \"_Moral Emblems_; _a Collection of Cuts and Verses_, by R. L. Stevenson, author of the _Blue Scalper_, etc., etc.  Printers, S. L. Osbourne and Company, Davos Platz.\"  Here are the lines to a rare piece of grotesque, titled _A Peak in Darien_--     \"Broad-gazing on untrodden lands,    See where adventurous Cortez stands,    While in the heavens above his head,    The eagle seeks its daily bread.    How aptly fact to fact replies,    Heroes and eagles, hills and skies.    Ye, who contemn the fatted slave,    Look on this emblem and be brave.\"  Another, _The Elephant_, has these lines--     \"See in the print how, moved by whim,    Trumpeting Jumbo, great and grim,    Adjusts his trunk, like a cravat,    To noose that individual's hat;    The Sacred Ibis in the distance,    Joys to observe his bold resistance.\"  R. L. Stevenson wrote from Davos Platz, in sending me _The Black Canyon_:     \"Sam sends as a present a work of his own.  I hope you feel flattered,    for _this is simply the first time he has ever given one away_.  I    have to buy my own works, I can tell you.\"  Later he said, in sending a second:     \"I own I have delayed this letter till I could forward the enclosed.    Remembering the night at Braemar, when we visited the picture-gallery,    I hope it may amuse you: you see we do some publishing hereaway.\"  Delightfully suggestive and highly enjoyable, too, were the meetings in the little drawing-room after dinner, when the contrasted traits of father and son came into full play--when R. L. Stevenson would sometimes draw out a new view by bold, half-paradoxical assertion, or compel advance on the point from a new quarter by a searching question couched in the simplest language, or reveal his own latest conviction finally, by a few sentences as nicely rounded off as though they had been written, while he rose and gently moved about, as his habit was, in the course of those more extended remarks.  Then a chapter or two of _The Sea-Cook_ would be read, with due pronouncement on the main points by one or other of the family audience.  The reading of the book is one thing.  It was quite another thing to hear Stevenson as he stood reading it aloud, with his hand stretched out holding the manuscript, and his body gently swaying as a kind of rhythmical commentary on the story.  His fine voice, clear and keen it some of its tones, had a wonderful power of inflection and variation, and when he came to stand in the place of Silver you could almost have imagined you saw the great one-legged John Silver, joyous-eyed, on the rolling sea.  Yes, to read it in print was good, but better yet to hear Stevenson read it.     CHAPTER II--_TREASURE ISLAND_ AND SOME REMINISCENCES   When I left Braemar, I carried with me a considerable portion of the MS. of _Treasure Island_, with an outline of the rest of the story.  It originally bore the odd title of _The Sea-Cook_, and, as I have told before, I showed it to Mr Henderson, the proprietor of the _Young Folks' Paper_, who came to an arrangement with Mr Stevenson, and the story duly appeared in its pages, as well as the two which succeeded it.  Stevenson himself in his article in _The Idler_ for August"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/590"],["title","Robert Louis Stevenson: A Record, an Estimate, and a Memorial (#2)"],["body","(reprinted in _My First Book_ volume and in a late volume of the _Edinburgh Edition_) has recalled some of the circumstances connected with this visit of mine to Braemar, as it bore on the destination of _Treasure Island_:     \"And now, who should come dropping in, _ex machina_, but Dr Japp, like    the disguised prince, who is to bring down the curtain upon peace and    happiness in the last act; for he carried in his pocket, not a horn or    a talisman, but a publisher, in fact, ready to unearth new writers for    my old friend Mr Henderson's _Young Folks_.  Even the ruthlessness of    a united family recoiled before the extreme measure of inflicting on    our guest the mutilated members of _The Sea-Cook_; at the same time,    we would by no means stop our readings, and accordingly the tale was    begun again at the beginning, and solemnly redelivered for the benefit    of Dr Japp.  From that moment on, I have thought highly of his    critical faculty; for when he left us, he carried away the manuscript    in his portmanteau.     \"_Treasure Island_--it was Mr Henderson who deleted the first title,    _The Sea-Cook_--appeared duly in _Young Folks_, where it figured in    the ignoble midst without woodcuts, and attracted not the least    attention.  I did not care.  I liked the tale myself, for much the    same reason as my father liked the beginning: it was my kind of    picturesque.  I was not a little proud of John Silver also; and to    this day rather admire that smooth and formidable adventurer.  What    was infinitely more exhilarating, I had passed a landmark.  I had    finished a tale and written The End upon my manuscript, as I had not    done since _The Pentland Rising_, when I was a boy of sixteen, not yet    at college.  In truth, it was so by a lucky set of accidents: had not    Dr Japp come on his visit, had not the tale flowed from me with    singular ease, it must have been laid aside, like its predecessors,    and found a circuitous and unlamented way to the fire.  Purists may    suggest it would have been better so.  I am not of that mind.  The    tale seems to have given much pleasure, and it brought (or was the    means of bringing) fire, food, and wine to a deserving family in which    I took an interest.  I need scarcely say I mean my own.\"  He himself gives a goodly list of the predecessors which had found a circuitous and unlamented way to the fire     \"As soon as I was able to write, I became a good friend to the paper-    makers.  Reams upon reams must have gone to the making of _Rathillet_,    _The Pentland Rising_, _The King's Pardon_ (otherwise _Park    Whitehead_), _Edward Daven_, _A Country Dance_, and _A Vendetta in the    West_.  _Rathillet_ was attempted before fifteen, _The Vendetta_ at    twenty-nine, and the succession of defeats lasted unbroken till I was    thirty-one.\"  Another thing I carried from Braemar with me which I greatly prize--this was a copy of _Christianity confirmed by Jewish and Heathen Testimony_, by Mr Stevenson's father, with his autograph signature and many of his own marginal notes.  He had thought deeply on many subjects--theological, scientific, and social--and had recorded, I am afraid, but the smaller half of his thoughts and speculations.  Several days in the mornings, before R. L. Stevenson was able to face the somewhat \"snell\" air of the hills, I had long walks with the old gentleman, when we also had long talks on many subjects--the liberalising of the Scottish Church, educational reform, etc.; and, on one occasion, a statement of his reason, because of the subscription, for never having become an elder. That he had in some small measure enjoyed my society, as I certainly had much enjoyed his, was borne out by a letter which I received from the son in reply to one I had written, saying that surely his father had never meant to present me at the last moment on my leaving by coach with that volume, with his name on it, and with pencilled notes here and there, but had merely given it me to read and return.  In the circumstances I may perhaps be excused quoting from a letter dated Castleton of Braemar, September 1881, in illustration of what I have said--     \"MY DEAR DR JAPP,--My father has gone, but I think I may take it upon    me to ask you to keep the book.  Of all things you could do to endear    yourself to me you have done the best, for, from your letter, you have    taken a fancy to my father.     \"I do not know how to thank you for your kind trouble in the matter of    _The Sea-Cook_, but I am not unmindful.  My health is still poorly,    and I have added intercostal rheumatism--a new attraction, which sewed    me up nearly double for two days, and still gives me 'a list to    starboard'--let us be ever nautical. . . . I do not think with the    start I have, there will be any difficulty in letting Mr Henderson go    ahead whenever he likes.  I will write my story up to its legitimate    conclusion, and then we shall be in a position to judge whether a    sequel would be desirable, and I myself would then know better about    its practicability from the story-telling point of view.--Yours very    sincerely, ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.\"  A little later came the following:--     \"THE COTTAGE, CASTLETON OF BRAEMAR.    (_No date_.)     \"MY DEAR DR JAPP,--Herewith go nine chapters.  I have been a little    seedy; and the two last that I have written seem to me on a false    venue; hence the smallness of the batch.  I have now, I hope, in the    three last sent, turned the corner, with no great amount of dulness.     \"The map, with all its names, notes, soundings, and things, should    make, I believe, an admirable advertisement for the story.  Eh?     \"I hope you got a telegram and letter I forwarded after you to    Dinnat.--Believe me, yours very sincerely, ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.\"  In the afternoon, if fine and dry, we went walking, and Stevenson would sometimes tell us stories of his short experience at the Scottish Bar, and of his first and only brief.  I remember him contrasting that with his experiences as an engineer with Bob Bain, who, as manager, was then superintending the building of a breakwater.  Of that time, too, he told the choicest stories, and especially of how, against all orders, he bribed Bob with five shillings to let him go down in the diver's dress. He gave us a splendid description--finer, I think, than even that in his _Memories_--of his sensations on the sea-bottom, which seems to have interested him as deeply, and suggested as many strange fancies, as anything which he ever came across on the surface.  But the possibility of enterprises of this sort ended--Stevenson lost his interest in engineering.  {Manuscript letter by R.L.S.: p20.jpg}  Stevenson's father had, indeed, been much exercised in his day by theological questions and difficulties, and though he remained a staunch adherent of the Established Church of Scotland he knew well and practically what is meant by the term \"accommodation,\" as it is used by theologians in reference to creeds and formulas; for he had over and over again, because of the strict character of the subscription required from elders of the Scottish Church declined, as I have said, to accept the office.  In a very express sense you could see that he bore the marks of his past in many ways--a quick, sensitive, in some ways even a fantastic- minded man, yet with a strange solidity and common-sense amid it all, just as though ferns with the veritable fairies' seed were to grow out of a common stone wall.  He looked like a man who had not been without sleepless nights--without troubles, sorrows, and perplexities, and even yet, had not wholly risen above some of them, or the results of them.  His voice was \"low and sweet\"--with just a possibility in it of rising to a shrillish key.  A sincere and faithful man, who had walked very demurely through life, though with a touch of sudden, bright, quiet humour and fancy, every now and then crossing the grey of his characteristic pensiveness or melancholy, and drawing effect from it.  He was most frank and genial with me, and I greatly honour his memory. {2}  Thomas Stevenson, with a strange, sad smile, told me how much of a disappointment, in the first stage, at all events, Louis (he always called his son Louis at home), had caused him, by failing to follow up his profession at the Scottish Bar.  How much he had looked forward, after the engineering was abandoned, to his devoting himself to the work of the Parliament House (as the Hall of the Chief Court is called in Scotland, from the building having been while yet there was a Scottish Parliament the place where it sat), though truly one cannot help feeling how much Stevenson's very air and figure would have been out of keeping among the bewigged, pushing, sharp-set, hard-featured, and even red-faced and red-nosed (some of them, at any rate) company, who daily walked the Parliament House, and talked and gossiped there, often of other things than law and equity.  \"Well, yes, perhaps it was all for the best,\" he said, with a sigh, on my having interjected the remark that R. L. Stevenson was wielding far more influence than he ever could have done as a Scottish counsel, even though he had risen rapidly in his profession, and become Lord-Advocate or even a judge.  There was, indeed, a very pathetic kind of harking back on the might-have- beens when I talked with him on this subject.  He had reconciled himself in a way to the inevitable, and, like a sensible man, was now inclined to make the most and the best of it.  The marriage, which, on the report of it, had been but a new disappointment to him, had, as if by magic, been transformed into a blessing in his mind and his wife's by personal contact with Fanny Van der Griff Stevenson, which no one who ever met her could wonder at; but, nevertheless, his dream of seeing his only son walking in the pathways of the Stevensons, and adorning a profession in"]]]
