ANOTHER FOR EVENING   LORD, receive our supplications for this house, family, and country. Protect the innocent, restrain the greedy and the treacherous, lead us out of our tribulation into a quiet land.  Look down upon ourselves and upon our absent dear ones.  Help us and them; prolong our days in peace and honour.  Give us health, food, bright weather, and light hearts.  In what we meditate of evil, frustrate our will; in what of good, further our endeavours.  Cause injuries to be forgot and benefits to be remembered.  Let us lie down without fear and awake and arise with exultation.  For his sake, in whose words we now conclude.    IN TIME OF RAIN   WE thank Thee, Lord, for the glory of the late days and the excellent face of thy sun.  We thank Thee for good news received.  We thank Thee for the pleasures we have enjoyed and for those we have been able to confer.  And now, when the clouds gather and the rain impends over the forest and our house, permit us not to be cast down; let us not lose the savour of past mercies and past pleasures; but, like the voice of a bird singing in the rain, let grateful memory survive in the hour of darkness. If there be in front of us any painful duty, strengthen us with the grace of courage; if any act of mercy, teach us tenderness and patience.    ANOTHER IN TIME OF RAIN   LORD, Thou sendest down rain upon the uncounted millions of the forest, and givest the trees to drink exceedingly.  We are here upon this isle a few handfuls of men, and how many myriads upon myriads of stalwart trees! Teach us the lesson of the trees.  The sea around us, which this rain recruits, teems with the race of fish; teach us, Lord, the meaning of the fishes.  Let us see ourselves for what we are, one out of the countless number of the clans of thy handiwork.  When we would despair, let us remember that these also please and serve Thee.    BEFORE A TEMPORARY SEPARATION   TO-DAY we go forth separate, some of us to pleasure, some of us to worship, some upon duty.  Go with us, our guide and angel; hold Thou before us in our divided paths the mark of our low calling, still to be true to what small best we can attain to.  Help us in that, our maker, the dispenser of events—Thou, of the vast designs, in which we blindly labour, suffer us to be so far constant to ourselves and our beloved.    FOR FRIENDS   FOR our absent loved ones we implore thy loving-kindness.  Keep them in life, keep them in growing honour; and for us, grant that we remain worthy of their love.  For Christ’s sake, let not our beloved blush for us, nor we for them.  Grant us but that, and grant us courage to endure lesser ills unshaken, and to accept death, loss, and disappointment as it were straws upon the tide of life.    FOR THE FAMILY   AID us, if it be thy will, in our concerns.  Have mercy on this land and innocent people.  Help them who this day contend in disappointment with their frailties.  Bless our family, bless our forest house, bless our island helpers.  Thou who hast made for us this place of ease and hope, accept and inflame our gratitude; help us to repay, in service one to another, the debt of thine unmerited benefits and mercies, so that, when the period of our stewardship draws to a conclusion, when the windows begin to be darkened, when the bond of the family is to be loosed, there shall be no bitterness of remorse in our farewells.  Help us to look back on the long way that Thou hast brought us, on the long days in which we have been served, not according to our deserts, but our desires; on the pit and the miry clay, the blackness of despair, the horror of misconduct, from which our feet have been plucked out.  For our sins forgiven or prevented, for our shame unpublished, we bless and thank Thee, O God.  Help us yet again and ever.  So order events, so strengthen our frailty, as that day by day we shall come before Thee with this song of gratitude, and in the end we be dismissed with honour.  In their weakness and their fear, the vessels of thy handiwork so pray to Thee, so praise Thee.  Amen.    SUNDAY   WE beseech Thee, Lord, to behold us with favour, folk of many families and nations gathered together in the peace of this roof, weak men and women subsisting under the covert of thy patience.  Be patient still; suffer us yet awhile longer;—with our broken purposes of good, with our idle endeavours against evil, suffer us awhile longer to endure, and (if it may be) help us to do better.  Bless to us our extraordinary mercies; if the day come when these must be taken, brace us to play the man under affliction.  Be with our friends, be with ourselves.  Go with each of us to rest; if any awake, temper to them the dark hours of watching; and when the day returns, return to us, our sun and comforter, and call us up with morning faces and with morning hearts—eager to labour—eager to be happy, if happiness shall be our portion—and if the day be marked for sorrow, strong to endure it.  We thank Thee and praise Thee; and in the words of him to whom this day is sacred, close our oblation.    FOR SELF-BLAME   LORD, enlighten us to see the beam that is in our own eye, and blind us to the mote that is in our brother’s.  Let us feel our offences with our hands, make them great and bright before us like the sun, make us eat them and drink them for our diet.  Blind us to the offences of our beloved, cleanse them from our memories, take them out of our mouths for ever.  Let all here before Thee carry and measure with the false balances of love, and be in their own eyes and in all conjunctures the most guilty.  Help us at the same time with the grace of courage, that we be none of us cast down when we sit lamenting amid the ruins of our happiness or our integrity: touch us with fire from the altar, that we may be up and doing to rebuild our city: in the name and by the method of him in whose words of prayer we now conclude.    FOR SELF-FORGETFULNESS   LORD, the creatures of thy hand, thy disinherited children, come before Thee with their incoherent wishes and regrets: Children we are, children we shall be, till our mother the earth hath fed upon our bones.  Accept us, correct us, guide us, thy guilty innocents.  Dry our vain tears, wipe out our vain resentments, help our yet vainer efforts.  If there be any here, sulking as children will, deal with and enlighten him.  Make it day about that person, so that he shall see himself and be ashamed.  Make it heaven about him, Lord, by the only way to heaven, forgetfulness of self, and make it day about his neighbours, so that they shall help, not hinder him.    FOR RENEWAL OF JOY   WE are evil, O God, and help us to see it and amend.  We are good, and help us to be better.  Look down upon thy servants with a patient eye, even as Thou sendest sun and rain; look down, call upon the dry bones, quicken, enliven; recreate in us the soul of service, the spirit of peace; renew in us the sense of joy.                                  * * * * *     A LOWDEN SABBATH MORN                           BY ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON    I      THE clinkum-clank o’ Sabbath bells    Noo to the hoastin’ rookery swells,    Noo faintin’ laigh in shady dells,             Sounds far an’ near,    An’ through the simmer kintry tells             Its tale o’ cheer.    II      An’ noo, to that melodious play,    A deidly awn the quiet sway—    A’ ken their solemn holiday,             Bestial an’ human,    The singin’ lintie on the brae,             The restin’ plou’man.    III      He, mair than a’ the lave o’ men,    His week completit joys to ken;    Half-dressed, he daunders out an’ in,             Perplext wi’ leisure;    An’ his raxt limbs he’ll rax again                Wi’ painfü’ pleesure.    IV      The steerin’ mither strang afit    Noo shoos the bairnies but a bit;    Noo cries them ben, their Sinday shüit             To scart upon them,    Or sweeties in their pouch to pit,             Wi’ blessin’s on them.    V      The lasses, clean frae tap to taes,    Are busked in crunklin’ underclaes;    The gartened hose, the weel-filled stays,             The nakit shift,    A’ bleached on bonny greens for days,             An’ white’s the drift.    VI      An’ noo to face the kirkward mile    The guidman’s hat o’ dacent style,    The blackit shoon, we noon maun fyle             As white’s the miller:    A waefü’ peety tae, to spile             The warth o’ siller.    VII      Our Marg’et, aye sae keen to crack,    Douce-stappin’ in the stoury track,    Her emeralt goun a’ kiltit back             Frae snawy coats,    White-ankled, leads the kirkward pack             Wi’ Dauvit Groats.    VIII      A thocht ahint, in runkled breeks,    A’ spiled wi’ lyin’ by for weeks,    The guidman follows closs, an’ cleiks             The sonsie misses;    His sarious face at aince bespeaks             The day that this is.    IX      And aye an’ while we nearer draw    To whaur the kirkton lies alaw,    Mair neebours, comin’ saft an’ slaw             Frae here an’ there,    The thicker thrang the gate, an’ caw             The stour in air.    X      But hark! the bells frae nearer clang    To rowst the slaw, their sides they bang    An’ see! black coats a’ready thrang             The green kirkyaird;    And at the yett, the chestnuts spang             That brocht the laird.    XI      The solemn elders at the plate    Stand drinkin’ deep the pride o’ state:    The practised hands as gash an’ great             As Lords o’ Session;    The later named, a wee thing blate             In their expression.    XII      The prentit stanes that mark the deid,    Wi’ lengthened lip, the sarious read;    Syne way a moraleesin’ heid,             An then an’ there    Their hirplin’ practice an’ their creed             Try hard to square.    XIII      It’s here our Merren lang has lain,    A wee bewast the table-stane;    An’ yon’s the grave o’ Sandy Blane;             An’ further ower,    The mither’s"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/616"],["title","Prayers Written At Vailima, and A Lowden Sabbath Morn (#2)"],["body","ers, dacent men!             Lie a’ the fower.    XIV      Here the guidman sall bide awee    To dwall amang the deid; to see    Auld faces clear in fancy’s e’e;             Belike to hear    Auld voices fa’in saft an’ slee             On fancy’s ear.    XV      Thus, on the day o’ solemn things,    The bell that in the steeple swings    To fauld a scaittered faim’ly rings             Its walcome screed;    An’ just a wee thing nearer brings             The quick an’ deid.    XVI      But noo the bell is ringin’ in;    To tak their places, folk begin;    The minister himsel’ will shüne             Be up the gate,    Filled fu’ wi’ clavers about sin             An’ man’s estate.    XVII      The tünes are up—_French_, to be shüre,    The faithfü’ _French_, an’ twa-three mair;    The auld prezentor, hoastin’ sair,             Wales out the portions,    An’ yirks the tüne into the air             Wi’ queer contortions.    XVIII      Follows the prayer, the readin’ next,    An’ than the fisslin’ for the text—    The twa-three last to find it, vext             But kind o’ proud;    An’ than the peppermints are raxed,             An’ southernwood.    XIX      For noo’s the time whan pows are seen    Nid-noddin’ like a mandareen;    When tenty mithers stap a preen             In sleepin’ weans;    An’ nearly half the parochine             Forget their pains.    XX      There’s just a waukrif’ twa or three:    Thrawn commentautors sweer to ’gree,    Weans glowrin’ at the bumlin’ bee             On windie-glasses,    Or lads that tak a keek a-glee             At sonsie lasses.    XXI      Himsel’, meanwhile, frae whaur he cocks    An’ bobs belaw the soundin’-box,    The treesures of his words unlocks             Wi’ prodigality,    An’ deals some unco dingin’ knocks             To infidality.    XXII      Wi’ snappy unction, hoo he burkes    The hopes o’ men that trust in works,    Expounds the fau’ts o’ ither kirks,             An’ shaws the best o’ them    No muckle better than mere Turks,             When a’s confessed o’ them.    XXIII      Bethankit! what a bonny creed!    What mair would ony Christian need?—    The braw words rumm’le ower his heid,             Nor steer the sleeper;    And in their restin’ graves, the deid             Sleep aye the deeper.    AUTHOR’S NOTE   It may be guessed by some that I had a certain parish in my eye, and this makes it proper I should add a word of disclamation.  In my time there have been two ministers in that parish.  Of the first I have a special reason to speak well, even had there been any to think ill.  The second I have often met in private and long (in the due phrase) “sat under” in his church, and neither here nor there have I heard an unkind or ugly word upon his lips.  The preacher of the text had thus no original in that particular parish; but when I was a boy he might have been observed in many others; he was then (like the schoolmaster) abroad; and by recent advices, it would seem he has not yet entirely disappeared."]]]
