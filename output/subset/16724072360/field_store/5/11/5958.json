That was a precious place. I thank God that I was a witness to this scene, but I was sorry that at this point I was obliged to leave the train.  We learn from this incident that out of the mouths of even babes God hath ordained strength, and that we ought to be willing to represent the cause of our blessed Jesus even in a railroad coach.  _The Sequel_  Brother Dosh:--I wish to relieve my heart by writing to you, and saying that that angel visit on the cars was a blessing to me, although I did not realize it in its fullness until some hours after. But blessed be the Redeemer, I know now that I am His, and He is mine. I no longer wonder why Christians are happy. Oh, my joy, my joy! The instrument of my salvation has gone to God. I had purposed adopting her in the place of my little daughter who is now in heaven. With this intention I took her to C--b, and on my return trip I took her back to S--n, where she left the cars. In consultation with my wife in regard to adopting her, she replied, \"Yes, certainly, and immediately, too, for there is a Divine providence in this. Oh,\" said she, \"I could never refuse to take under my charge the instrument of my husband's salvation.\"  I made inquiry for the child at S--n and learned that in three days after her return she died suddenly, without any apparent disease, and her happy soul had gone to dwell with her ma, my little girl and the angels in heaven. I was sorry to hear of her death but my sorrow is turned to joy when I think my angel-daughter received intelligence from earth concerning her pa, and that he is on the heavenly railway. Oh! sir, me thinks I see her near the Redeemer. I think I hear her sing! \"I'm safe at home, and pa and ma are coming,\" and I find myself sending back the reply: \"Yes, my darling we are coming and will soon be there.\" Oh, my dear sir, I am glad that I ever formed your acquaintance; may the blessing of the great God rest upon you. Please write to me, and be assured, I would be most happy to meet you again.  --J. M. Dosh, in _Christian Expositor_    THE YOUNG MARTYR  On the afternoon of August 9, 1853, a little Norwegian boy, named Kund Iverson, who lived in the city of Chicago, Illinois, was going to the pastures for his cow as light-hearted, I suppose, as boys usually are when going to the pasture on a summer afternoon. He came at length to a stream of water where there was a gang of idle, ill-looking, big boys; who, when they saw Kund, came up to him; and said they wanted him to go into Mr. Elston's garden and steal some apples.  \"No,\" said Kund promptly; \"I cannot steal, I am sure.\"  \"Well, but you've got to,\" they cried.  [Illustration: THE CRIES OF THE DROWNING CHILD GREW FAINTER AND FAINTER]   They threatened to duck him, for these wicked big boys had often frightened little boys into robbing gardens for them. Little boys, they thought, were less likely to get found out.  The threat did not frighten Kund, so to make their words good, they seized him and dragged him into the river, and in spite of his cries and struggles, plunged him in. But the heroic boy even with the water gurgling and choking in his throat, never flinched, for he knew that God had said: \"Thou shalt not steal,\" and God's law he had made his law; and no cursing, or threats, or cruelty of the big boys would make him give up. Provoked by his firmness, I suppose, they determined to see if they could conquer him. So they ducked him again but it still was, \"No, no\"; and they kept him under water. Was there no one near to hear his distressing cries, and rescue the poor child from their cruel grip? No; there was none to rescue him; and gradually the cries of the drowning child grew fainter and fainter, and his struggles less and less, and the boy was drowned. He could die, but would not steal.  A German boy who had stood near, much frightened by what he saw, ran home to tell the news. The agonized parents hastened to the spot, and all night they searched for the lifeless body of their lost darling. It was found the next morning; and who shall describe their feelings as they clasped the little form to their bosoms? Early piety had blossomed in his little life. He loved his Bible and his Savior. His seat was never vacant at Sunday school, and so intelligent, conscientious and steadfast had he been.  Perhaps the little boy used often to think how, when he grew up, he would like to be a preacher or a missionary, and do something for his Lord and Master. He did not know what post he might be called to occupy, even as a little child; and as he left home that afternoon and looked his last look in his mother's face, he thought he was only going after his cows; and other boys, and the neighbors, if they saw him, thought so, too. They did not then know that instead of going to the pasture he was going to preach one of the most powerful sermons of Bible law and Bible principles the country ever heard. They did not know that he was going to give an example of steadfastness of purpose and of unflinching integrity, such as should thrill the heart of this nation with wonder and admiration. He was then only a Norwegian boy, Kund Iverson, only thirteen years old, but his name was soon to be reckoned with martyrs and heroes. And as the story of his moral heroism winged its way from state to state, and city to city, and village to village, how many mothers cried with full hearts: \"May his spirit rest upon my boy!\" And strong men have wept over it and exclaimed: \"God be praised for the lad!\" And rich men put their hands into their pockets and said, \"Let us build him a monument; let his name be perpetuated, for his memory is blessed.\" May there be a generation of Kund Iversons, strong in their integrity, true to their Bibles ready to die rather than do wrong.  --_The Cynosure_    A CHILD'S PRAYER ANSWERED  The following touching incident which drew tears from my eyes, was related to me a short time since, by a dear friend who had it from an eyewitness of the same. It occurred in the great city of New York, on one of the coldest days in February.  A little boy about ten years old was standing before a shoe-store in Broadway barefooted, peering through the window, and shivering with cold.  A lady riding up the street in a beautiful carriage, drawn by horses finely caparisoned, observed the little fellow in his forlorn condition and immediately ordered the driver to draw up and stop in front of the store. The lady richly dressed in silk, alighted from her carriage, went quickly to the boy, and said:  \"My little fellow why are you looking so earnestly in that window?\"  \"I was asking God to give me a pair of shoes,\" was the reply. The lady took him by the hand and went into the store, and asked the proprietor if he would allow one of his clerks to go and buy half a dozen pairs of stockings for the boy. He readily assented. She then asked him if he could give her a basin of water and a towel, and he replied: \"Certainly,\" and quickly brought them to her.  She took the little fellow to the back part of the store, and, removing her gloves knelt down, washed those little feet and dried them with the towel.  [Illustration]  By this time the young man had returned with the stockings. Placing a pair upon his feet, she purchased and gave him a pair of shoes, and tying up the remaining pairs of stockings, gave them to him, and patting him on the head said: \"I hope my little fellow, that you now feel more comfo rtable.\"  As she turned to go, the astonished lad caught her hand, and looking up in her face, with tears in his eyes answered her question with these words: \"Are you God's wife?\"  --_Parish Register_    THE CONVERTED INFIDEL  Some two miles from the village of C. on a road that wound in among the hills stood a great white house. It was beautifully situated upon a gentle slope facing the south, and overlooking a most charming landscape. Away in the distance, a mountain lifted itself against the clear blue sky. At its base rolled a broad, deep river. Nestling down in a valley that intervened, reposed the charming little village with its neat cottages, white church, little red school house and one or two mansions that told of wealth. Here and there in the distance a pond was visible; while farm houses and humbler dwellings dotted the picture in every direction.  Such was the home of three promising children, who for the last three months had been constant members of the village Sunday School. The eldest was a girl of some fourteen years. John, the second, was a bright, amiable lad of eleven. The other the little rosy-cheeked, laughing Ella, with her golden curls and sunny smile had just gathered the roses of her ninth summer.  The father of these interesting children was the rich Captain Lowe. He was a man of mark, such, in many respects as are often found in rural districts. Strictly moral, intelligent and well read, kind-hearted and naturally benevolent, he attracted all classes of community to himself and wielded great influence in his town.  But, not withstanding all these excellences, Mr. Lowe was an infidel. He ridiculed in his good-natured way, the idea of prayer, looked upon conversion as a solemn farce, and believed the most of professing Christians were well-meaning but deluded people. He was well versed in all the subtle arguments of infidel writers, had studied the Bible quite carefully, and could argue against it in the most plausible manner. Courteous and kind to all, few could be offended at his frank avowal of infidel principles, or resent his keen, half-jovial sarcasms upon the peculiarities of some weak-minded, though sincere members of the church.   But Mr. Lowe saw and acknowledged the saving influence of the MORALITY of Christianity. He had especially, good sense enough to confess that the Sunday School was a noble moral enterprise. He was not blind to the fact, abundantly proved by all our criminal records,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7028"],["title","The Clicking of Cuthbert (#1)"],["body","is not everything.\"  \"You're wrong,\" said Cuthbert, earnestly. \"You're right off it. Love----\" And he was about to dilate on the theme when she interrupted him.  \"I am a girl of ambition.\"  \"And very nice, too,\" said Cuthbert.  \"I am a girl of ambition,\" repeated Adeline, \"and I realize that the fulfilment of my ambitions must come through my husband. I am very ordinary myself----\"  \"What!\" cried Cuthbert. \"You ordinary? Why, you are a pearl among women, the queen of your sex. You can't have been looking in a glass lately. You stand alone. Simply alone. You make the rest look like battered repaints.\"  \"Well,\" said Adeline, softening a trifle, \"I believe I am fairly good-looking----\"  \"Anybody who was content to call you fairly good-looking would describe the Taj Mahal as a pretty nifty tomb.\"  \"But that is not the point. What I mean is, if I marry a nonentity I shall be a nonentity myself for ever. And I would sooner die than be a nonentity.\"  \"And, if I follow your reasoning, you think that that lets _me_ out?\"  \"Well, really, Mr. Banks, _have_ you done anything, or are you likely ever to do anything worth while?\"  Cuthbert hesitated.  \"It's true,\" he said, \"I didn't finish in the first ten in the Open, and I was knocked out in the semi-final of the Amateur, but I won the French Open last year.\"  \"The--what?\"  \"The French Open Championship. Golf, you know.\"  \"Golf! You waste all your time playing golf. I admire a man who is more spiritual, more intellectual.\"  A pang of jealousy rent Cuthbert's bosom.  \"Like What's-his-name Devine?\" he said, sullenly.  \"Mr. Devine,\" replied Adeline, blushing faintly, \"is going to be a great man. Already he has achieved much. The critics say that he is more Russian than any other young English writer.\"  \"And is that good?\"  \"Of course it's good.\"  \"I should have thought the wheeze would be to be more English than any other young English writer.\"  \"Nonsense! Who wants an English writer to be English? You've got to be Russian or Spanish or something to be a real success. The mantle of the great Russians has descended on Mr. Devine.\"  \"From what I've heard of Russians, I should hate to have that happen to _me_.\"  \"There is no danger of that,\" said Adeline scornfully.  \"Oh! Well, let me tell you that there is a lot more in me than you think.\"  \"That might easily be so.\"  \"You think I'm not spiritual and intellectual,\" said Cuthbert, deeply moved. \"Very well. Tomorrow I join the Literary Society.\"  Even as he spoke the words his leg was itching to kick himself for being such a chump, but the sudden expression of pleasure on Adeline's face soothed him; and he went home that night with the feeling that he had taken on something rather attractive. It was only in the cold, grey light of the morning that he realized what he had let himself in for.  I do not know if you have had any experience of suburban literary societies, but the one that flourished under the eye of Mrs. Willoughby Smethurst at Wood Hills was rather more so than the average. With my feeble powers of narrative, I cannot hope to make clear to you all that Cuthbert Banks endured in the next few weeks. And, even if I could, I doubt if I should do so. It is all very well to excite pity and terror, as Aristotle recommends, but there are limits. In the ancient Greek tragedies it was an ironclad rule that all the real rough stuff should take place off-stage, and I shall follow this admirable principle. It will suffice if I say merely that J. Cuthbert Banks had a thin time. After attending eleven debates and fourteen lectures on _vers libre_ Poetry, the Seventeenth-Century Essayists, the Neo-Scandinavian Movement in Portuguese Literature, and other subjects of a similar nature, he grew so enfeebled that, on the rare occasions when he had time for a visit to the links, he had to take a full iron for his mashie shots.  It was not simply the oppressive nature of the debates and lectures that sapped his vitality. What really got right in amongst him was the torture of seeing Adeline's adoration of Raymond Parsloe Devine. The man seemed to have made the deepest possible impression upon her plastic emotions. When he spoke, she leaned forward with parted lips and looked at him. When he was not speaking--which was seldom--she leaned back and looked at him. And when he happened to take the next seat to her, she leaned sideways and looked at him. One glance at Mr. Devine would have been more than enough for Cuthbert; but Adeline found him a spectacle that never palled. She could not have gazed at him with a more rapturous intensity if she had been a small child and he a saucer of ice-cream. All this Cuthbert had to witness while still endeavouring to retain the possession of his faculties sufficiently to enable him to duck and back away if somebody suddenly asked him what he thought of the sombre realism of Vladimir Brusiloff. It is little wonder that he tossed in bed, picking at the coverlet, through sleepless nights, and had to have all his waistcoats taken in three inches to keep them from sagging.  This Vladimir Brusiloff to whom I have referred was the famous Russian novelist, and, owing to the fact of his being in the country on a lecturing tour at the moment, there had been something of a boom in his works. The Wood Hills Literary Society had been studying them for weeks, and never since his first entrance into intellectual circles had Cuthbert Banks come nearer to throwing in the towel. Vladimir specialized in grey studies of hopeless misery, where nothing happened till page three hundred and eighty, when the moujik decided to commit suicide. It was tough going for a man whose deepest reading hitherto had been Vardon on the Push-Shot, and there can be no greater proof of the magic of love than the fact that Cuthbert stuck it without a cry. But the strain was terrible and I am inclined to think that he must have cracked, had it not been for the daily reports in the papers of the internecine strife which was proceeding so briskly in Russia. Cuthbert was an optimist at heart, and it seemed to him that, at the rate at which the inhabitants of that interesting country were murdering one another, the supply of Russian novelists must eventually give out.  One morning, as he tottered down the road for the short walk which was now almost the only exercise to which he was equal, Cuthbert met Adeline. A spasm of anguish flitted through all his nerve-centres as he saw that she was accompanied by Raymond Parsloe Devine.  \"Good morning, Mr. Banks,\" said Adeline.  \"Good morning,\" said Cuthbert hollowly.  \"Such good news about Vladimir Brusiloff.\"  \"Dead?\" said Cuthbert, with a touch of hope.  \"Dead? Of course not. Why should he be? No, Aunt Emily met his manager after his lecture at Queen's Hall yesterday, and he has promised that Mr. Brusiloff shall come to her next Wednesday reception.\"  \"Oh, ah!\" said Cuthbert, dully.  \"I don't know how she managed it. I think she must have told him that Mr. Devine would be there to meet him.\"  \"But you said he was coming,\" argued Cuthbert.  \"I shall be very glad,\" said Raymond Devine, \"of the opportunity of meeting Brusiloff.\"  \"I'm sure,\" said Adeline, \"he will be very glad of the opportunity of meeting you.\"  \"Possibly,\" said Mr. Devine. \"Possibly. Competent critics have said that my work closely resembles that of the great Russian Masters.\"  \"Your psychology is so deep.\"  \"Yes, yes.\"  \"And your atmosphere.\"  \"Quite.\"  Cuthbert in a perfect agony of spirit prepared to withdraw from this love-feast. The sun was shining brightly, but the world was black to him. Birds sang in the tree-tops, but he did not hear them. He might have been a moujik for all the pleasure he found in life.  \"You will be there, Mr. Banks?\" said Adeline, as he turned away.  \"Oh, all right,\" said Cuthbert.  When Cuthbert had entered the drawing-room on the following Wednesday and had taken his usual place in a distant corner where, while able to feast his gaze on Adeline, he had a sporting chance of being overlooked or mistaken for a piece of furniture, he perceived the great Russian thinker seated in the midst of a circle of admiring females. Raymond Parsloe Devine had not yet arrived.  His first glance at the novelist surprised Cuthbert. Doubtless with the best motives, Vladimir Brusiloff had permitted his face to become almost entirely concealed behind a dense zareba of hair, but his eyes were visible through the undergrowth, and it seemed to Cuthbert that there was an expression in them not unlike that of a cat in a strange backyard surrounded by small boys. The man looked forlorn and hopeless, and Cuthbert wondered whether he had had bad news from home.  This was not the case. The latest news which Vladimir Brusiloff had had from Russia had been particularly cheering. Three of his principal creditors had perished in the last massacre of the _bourgeoisie_, and a man whom he owed for five years for a samovar and a pair of overshoes had fled the country, and had not been heard of since. It was not bad news from home that was depressing Vladimir. What was wrong with him was the fact that this was the eighty-second suburban literary reception he had been compelled to attend since he had landed in the country on his lecturing tour, and he was sick to death of it. When his agent had first suggested the trip, he had signed on the dotted line without an instant's hesitation. Worked out in roubles, the fees offered had seemed just about right. But now, as he peered through the brushwood at the faces round him, and realized that eight out of ten of those present had manuscripts of some sort concealed on their persons, and were only waiting for an opportunity to whip them out and start reading, he wished that he had stayed at his quiet home in Nijni-Novgorod, where the worst thing that could happen to a fellow was a brace of bombs coming in through the window and mixing themselves up with his breakfast egg.
