Where is Rome, once the mistress of the World?  There are the same seven hills now, the same soil, the same natural resources; the nature is the same, but what a ruin of human greatness meets the eye of the traveler throughout the length and breadth of that most down-trodden land! why have not the People of that Heaven-favored clime, the spirit that animated their fathers?  Why this sad difference?  \"It is the destruction of their institutions that has caused it; and, my countrymen, if we shall in an evil hour rashly pull down and destroy those institutions which the patriotic hand of our fathers labored so long and so hard to build up, and which have done so much for us and the World, who can venture the prediction that similar results will not ensue?  Let us avoid it if we can.  I trust the spirit is among us that will enable us to do it.  Let us not rashly try the experiment, for, if it fails, as it did in Greece and Italy, and in the South American Republics, and in every other place wherever liberty is once destroyed, it may never be restored to us again.  \"There are defects in our government, errors in administration, and short-comings of many kinds; but in spite of these defects and errors, Georgia has grown to be a great State.  Let us pause here a moment.  \"When I look around and see our prosperity in everything, agriculture, commerce, art, science, and every department of education, physical and mental, as well as moral advancement--and our colleges--I think, in the face of such an exhibition, if we can, without the loss of power, or any essential right or interest, remain in the Union, it is our duty to ourselves and to posterity--let us not too readily yield to this temptation--to do so.  Our first parents, the great progenitors of the human race, were not without a like temptation, when in the Garden of Eden.  They were led to believe that their condition would be bettered --that their eyes would be opened--and that they would become as gods. They in an evil hour yielded--instead of becoming gods they only saw their own nakedness.  \"I look upon this Country, with our institutions, as the Eden of the World, the Paradise of the Universe.  It may be that out of it we may become greater and more prosperous, but I am candid and sincere in telling you that I fear if we rashly evince passion, and without sufficient cause shall take that step, that instead of becoming greater or more peaceful, prosperous, and happy--instead of becoming gods, we will become demons, and at no distant day commence cutting one another's throats.  This is my apprehension.  \"Let us, therefore, whatever we do, meet those difficulties, great as they are, like wise and sensible men, and consider them in the light of all the consequences which may attend our action.  Let us see first clearly where the path of duty leads, and then we may not fear to tread therein.\"   Said Senator Wigfall, of Texas, March 4, 1861, in the United States Senate, only a few hours before Mr. Lincoln's Inauguration:  \"I desire to pour oil on the waters, to produce harmony, peace and quiet here.  It is early in the morning, and I hope I shall not say anything that may be construed as offensive.  I rise merely that we may have an understanding of this question.  \"It is not Slavery in the Territories, it is not expansion, which is the difficulty.  If the resolution which the Senator from Wisconsin introduced here, denying the right of Secession, had been adopted by two-thirds of each branch of this department of the Government, and had been ratified by three-fourths of the States, I have no hesitation in saying that, so far as the State in which I live and to which I owe my allegiance is concerned, if she had no other cause for a disruption of the Union taking place, she would undoubtedly have gone out.       [To insert as an additional article of amendment to the      Constitution, the following: \"Under this Constitution, as      originally adopted, and as it now exists, no State has power to      withdraw from the jurisdiction of the United States: but this      Constitution, and all laws passed in pursuance of its delegated      powers, are the Supreme Law of the Land, anything contained in any      constitution, ordinance, or act of any State, to the contrary      notwithstanding.\"]  \"The moment you deny the right of self-government to the free White men of the South, they will leave the Government.  They believe in the Declaration of Independence.  They believe that:  \"'Governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed; that, whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute a new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness.'  \"That principle of the Declaration of Independence is the one upon which the free White men of the South predicated their devotion to the present Constitution of the United States; and it was the denial of that, as much as anything else, that has created the dissatisfaction in that Section of the Country.  \"There is no instrument of writing that has ever been written that has been more misapprehended and misunderstood and misrepresented than this same unfortunate Declaration of Independence, and no set of gentlemen have ever been so slandered as the fathers who drew and signed that Declaration.  \"If there was a thing on earth that they did not intend to assert, it was that a Negro was a White man.  As I said here, a short time ago, one of the greatest charges they made against the British Government was, that old King George was attempting to establish the fact practically that all men were created Free and Equal.  They charged him in the Declaration of Independence with inciting their Slaves to insurrection. That is one of the grounds upon which they threw off their allegiance to the British Parliament.  \"Another great misapprehension is, that the men who drafted that Declaration of Independence had any peculiar fancy for one form of government rather than another.  They were not fighting to establish a Democracy in this country; they were not fighting to establish a Republican form of government in this Country.  Nothing was further from their intention.  \"Alexander Hamilton, after he had fought for seven years, declared that the British form of government was the best that the ingenuity of man had ever devised; and when John Adams said to him, 'without its corruptions;'  'Why,' said he, 'its corruptions are its greatest excellence; without the corruptions, it would be nothing.'  \"In the Declaration of Independence, they speak of George III., after this fashion.  They say:  \"'A prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free People.'  \"Now, I ask any plain common-sense man what was the meaning of that? Was it that they were opposed to a Monarchical form of government?  Was it that they believed a Monarchical form of government was incompatible with civil liberty?  No, sir; they entertained no such absurd idea. None of them entertained it; but they say that George III, was a prince whose character was 'marked by every act which may define a tyrant' and that therefore he was 'unfit to be the ruler of a free People.'  Had his character not been so marked by every quality which would define a tyrant, he might have been the fit ruler of a free People; ergo, a monarchical form of Government was not incompatible with civil liberty.  \"That was clearly the opinion of those men.  I do not advocate it now; for I have said frequently that we are wiser than our fathers, and our children will be wiser than we are.  One hundred years hence, men will understand their own affairs much better than we do.  We understand our affairs better than those who preceded us one hundred years.  But what I assert is, that the men of the Revolution did not believe that a Monarchical form of Government was incompatible with civil liberty.  \"What I assert is, that when they spoke of 'all men being created equal,' they were speaking of the White men who then had unsheathed their swords--for what purpose?  To establish the right of self-government in themselves; and when they had achieved that, they established, not Democracies, but Republican forms of Government in the thirteen sovereign, separate and independent Colonies.  Yet the Declaration of Independence is constantly quoted to prove Negro equality.  It proves no such thing; it was intended to prove no such thing.  \"The 'glittering generalities' which a distinguished former Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Choate) spoke of, as contained in the Declaration of Independence, one of them at least, about all men being created equal --was not original with Mr. Jefferson.  I recollect seeing a pamphlet called the Principles of the Whigs and Jacobites, published about the year 1745, when the last of the Stuarts, called 'the Pretender,' was striking a blow that was fatal to himself, but a blow for his crown, in which pamphlet the very phraseology is used, word for word and letter for letter.  I have not got it here to-night.  I sent the other day to the Library to try and find it, but could not find it; it was burnt, I believe, with the pamphlets that were burnt some time ago.  \"That Mr. Jefferson copied it or plagiarized it, is not true, I suppose, any more than the charge that the distinguished Senator from New York plagiarized from the Federalist in preparing his celebrated compromising speech which was made here a short time ago.  It was the cant phrase of the day in 1745, which was only about thirty years previous to the Declaration of Independence.  This particular pamphlet, which I have read, was published;"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7136"],["title","The Great Conspiracy, Volume 4 (#1)"],["body"," right to travel, are permitted to leave the city upon the cars.\"  But Bull Run did much to settle the Military as well as public mind in proper grooves on this subject.  Besides employing Negro Slaves to aid Rebellion, by the digging of ditches, the throwing up of intrenchments, and the erection of batteries, their Rebel masters placed in their hands arms with which to shoot down Union soldiers at the Battle of Bull Run, which, as we have seen, occurred on Sunday, July 21, 1861--and resulted in a check to the Union Cause.  The terror and confusion and excitement already referred to, that prevailed in Washington all that night and the next day, as the panic-stricken crowd of soldiers and civilians poured over the Long Bridge, footsore with running, faint with weariness, weak with hunger, and parched with thirst and the dust of the rout, can hardly be described.  But, however panicky the general condition of the inhabitants of the National Capital, the Congress bravely maintained its equanimity.  In the Senate, on the day following the disaster, a bill  touching the Confiscation of Property used for insurrectionary purposes being up for consideration, the following amendment was offered to it:  \"And be it further enacted, That whenever any person claiming to be entitled to the Service or Labor of any other Person under the laws of any State, shall employ such Person in aiding or promoting any Insurrection, or in resisting the Laws of the United States, or shall permit him to be so employed, he shall forfeit all right to such Service or Labor, and the Person whose Labor or Service is thus claimed shall be thenceforth discharged therefrom, any law to the contrary notwithstanding.\"  This amendment, emancipating Slaves employed by their masters to aid Rebellion, was adopted by 33 yeas to 6 nays.  As showing the feeling expressed right upon the very heels of what seemed to be a great disaster, and when rumor, at any rate, placed the victorious Enemy at the very gates of the Capital City, a few lines from the debate may be interesting.  Mr. Trumbull said: \"I am glad the yeas and nays have been called to let us see who is willing to vote that the Traitorous owner of a Negro shall employ him to shoot down the Union men of the Country, and yet insist upon restoring him to the Traitor that owns him.  I understand that Negroes were in the fight which has recently occurred.  I take it that Negroes who are used to destroy the Union, and to shoot down the Union men by the consent of Traitorous masters, ought not to be restored to them.  If the Senator from Kentucky is in favor of restoring them, let him vote against the amendment.\"  Senator Wilson, of Massachusetts, said: \"I shall vote with more heart than I vote for ordinary measures, for this proposition.  I hope the Senate and the House of Representatives will sustain it, and that this Government will carry it out with an inflexibility that knows no change. The idea that men who are in arms destroying their Country shall be permitted to use others for that purpose, and that we shall stand by and issue orders to our Commanders, that we should disgrace our Cause and our Country, by returning such men to their Traitorous masters, ought not longer to be entertained.  The time has come for that to cease; and, by the blessing of God, so far as I am concerned, I mean it shall cease.  \"If there is anybody in this Chamber that chooses to take the other path, let him do it; let him know what our purpose is.  Our purpose is to save this Government and save this Country, and to put down Treason; and if Traitors use bondsmen to destroy this Country, my doctrine is that the Government shall at once convert these bondsmen into men that cannot be used to destroy our Country.  I have no apologies to make for this position, I take it proudly.  \"I think the time has come when this Government, and the men who are in arms under the Government, should cease to return to Traitors their Fugitive Slaves, whom they are using to erect batteries to murder brave men who are fighting under the flag of their Country.  The time has come when we should deal with the men who are organizing Negro companies, and teaching them to shoot down loyal men for the only offence of upholding the flag of their Country.  \"I hope further, Sir, that there is a public sentiment in this Country that will blast men who will rise, in the Senate or out it, to make apologies for Treason, or to defend or to maintain the doctrine that this Government is bound to protect Traitors in converting their Slaves into tools for the destruction of the Republic.\"  Senator McDougall, of California, said: \"I regard this as a Confiscation for Treason, and I am for the proposition.\"  Mr. Ten Eyck, said: \"No longer ago than Saturday last I voted in the Judiciary Committee against this amendment, for two reasons: First, I did not believe that persons in Rebellion against this Government would make use of such means as the employment of Persons held to Labor or Service, in their Armies; secondly, because I did not know what was to become of these poor wretches if they were discharged.  God knows we do not want them in our Section of the Union.  But, Sir, having learned and believing that these persons have been employed with arms in their hands to shed the blood of the Union-loving men of this Country, I shall now vote in favor of that amendment with less regard to what may become of these people than I had on Saturday.  I will merely instance that there is a precedent for this.  If I recollect history aright, General Jackson, in the Seminole War, declared that every Slave who was taken in arms against the United States should be set Free,\"  So, too, in the House of Representatives, the retrograde of a badly demoralized Army, its routed fragments still coming in with alarming stories of a pursuing Enemy almost at the gates of the city, had no terrors for our legislators; and there was something of Roman dignity, patriotism, and courage, in the adoption, on that painfully memorable Blue Monday, (the first--[Offered by Mr. Crittenden, of Kentucky]--with only two dissenting votes, on a yea and nay vote; and, the second --[Offered by Mr. Vandever, of Iowa.]--with entire unanimity) of the following Resolutions:  \"Resolved by the House of Representatives of the Congress of the United States, That the present deplorable Civil War has been forced upon the Country by the Disunionists of the Southern States, now in arms against the Constitutional Government, and in arms around the Capital; that in this National emergency, Congress, banishing all feelings of mere passion or resentment, will recollect only its duty to the whole Country; that this War is not waged on their part in any spirit of oppression, or for any purpose of conquest or subjugation, or purpose of overthrowing or interfering with the rights or established Institutions of those States, but to defend and maintain the supremacy of the Constitution, and to preserve the Union with all the dignity, equality, and rights of the several States unimpaired; and that as soon as these objects are accomplished, the War ought to cease.\"  \"Resolved, That the maintenance of the Constitution, the preservation of the Union, and the enforcement of the Laws, are sacred trusts which must be executed; that no disaster shall discourage us from the most ample performance of this high duty; and that we pledge to the Country and the World, the employment of every resource, National and individual, for the suppression, overthrow, and punishment of Rebels in arms.\"  The first of these Resolutions was intended to calm the fears of the Border States--excited by Rebel emissaries; the second, to restore confidence and courage to the patriot hearts of Union-men, everywhere. Both were effectual.  And here it will hardly be amiss to glance, for an instant, toward the Senate Chamber; and especially at one characteristic incident.  It was the afternoon of August the 1st, 1861,--scarce ten days since the check to the Union arms at Bull Run; and Breckinridge, of Kentucky, not yet expelled from the United States Senate, was making in that Body his great speech against the \"Insurrection and Sedition Bill,\" and upon \"the sanctity of the Constitution.\"  Baker, of Oregon,--who, as Sumner afterward said: \"with a zeal that never tired, after recruiting men drawn by the attraction of his name, in New York and Philadelphia and elsewhere, held his Brigade in camp, near the Capitol, so that he passed easily from one to the other, and thus alternated the duties of a Senator and a General,\" having reached the Capitol, direct from his Brigade-camp, entered the Senate Chamber, in his uniform, while Breckinridge was speaking.  When the Kentucky Senator \"with Treason in his heart, if not on his lips,\" resumed his seat, the gray-haired soldier-Senator at once rose to reply.  \"He began,\"--said Charles Sumner, in alluding to the incident --\"simply and calmly; but as he proceeded, his fervid soul broke forth in words of surpassing power.  As on a former occasion he had presented the well-ripened fruits of study, so now he spoke with the spontaneous utterance of his own mature and exuberant eloquence--meeting the polished Traitor at every point with weapons keener and brighter than his own.\"  After demolishing Breckinridge's position touching the alleged Unconstitutionality of the measure, and characterizing his other utterances as \"reproof, malediction, and prediction combined,\" the Patriot from the Far-West turned with rising voice and flashing eye upon the gloomy Kentuckian:  \"I would ask him,\" said he, \"what would you have us do now--a Confederate Army within twenty miles of us, advancing, or threatening to advance, to overwhelm your Government; to shake the pillars of the Union, to bring it around your head, if you stay here, in ruins?  Are we to stop and talk about an uprising sentiment in the North against the War?  Are we to predict evil,"]]]
