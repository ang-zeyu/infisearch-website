HORACE GREELEY  \"DEAR SIR:--I have just read yours of the 19th inst. addressed to myself through the New York Tribune.  \"If there be in it any statements or assumptions of fact which I may know to be erroneous, I do not now and here controvert them.  \"If there be any inferences which I may believe to be falsely drawn, I do not now and here argue against them.  \"If there be perceptible in it an impatient and dictatorial tone, I waive it in deference to an old friend whose heart I have always supposed to be right.  \"As to the policy I 'seem to be pursuing,' as you say, I have not meant to leave any one in doubt.  I would save the Union.  I would save it in the shortest way under the Constitution.  \"The sooner the National authority can be restored, the nearer the Union will be--the Union as it was.  \"If there be those who would not save the Union unless they could at the same time save Slavery, I do not agree with them.  \"If there be those who would not save the Union unless they could at the same time destroy Slavery, I do not agree, with them.  \"My paramount object is to save the Union and not either to save or destroy Slavery.  \"If I could save the Union without freeing any Slave, I would do it--and if I could save it by freeing all the Slaves, I would do it--and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone, I would also do that.  \"What I do about Slavery and the Colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save the Union, and what I forbear, I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union.  \"I shall do less whenever I shall believe what I am doing hurts the cause, and shall do more whenever I believe doing more will help the cause.  \"I shall try to correct errors when shown to be errors, and I shall adopt new views so fast as they shall appear to be true views.  \"I have here stated my purpose according to my view of official duty, and I intend no modification of my oft-expressed personal wish that all men everywhere could be free.                          \"Yours,                                    \"A. LINCOLN.\"   On the 13th of September, 1862, a deputation from all the religious denominations of Chicago presented to President Lincoln a memorial for the immediate issue of a Proclamation of Emancipation, to which, and the Chairman's remarks, he thus replied:  \"The subject presented in the Memorial is one upon which I have thought much for weeks past, and I may even say, for months.  I am approached with the most opposite opinions, and advice, and that by religious men, who are equally certain that they represent the Divine will.  I am sure that either the one or the other class is mistaken in that belief, and perhaps, in some respects, both.  I hope it will not be irreverent for me to say that if it is probable that God would reveal His will to others, on a point so connected with my duty, it might be supposed He would reveal it directly to me; for, unless I am more deceived in myself than I often am, it is my earnest desire to know the will of Providence in this matter.  And if I can learn what it is, I will do it!  \"These are not, however, the days of miracles, and I suppose it will be granted that I am not to expect a direct Revelation; I must study the plain physical aspects of the case, ascertain what is possible, and learn what appears to be wise and right!  \"The subject is difficult, and good men do not agree.  For instance, the other day, four gentlemen, of standing and intelligence, from New York, called, as a delegation, on business connected with the War; but, before leaving, two of them earnestly besought me to proclaim general Emancipation, upon which the other two at once attacked them.  \"You know also that the last Session of Congress had a decided majority of Anti-Slavery men, yet they could not unite on this policy.  And the same is true of the religious people; why the Rebel soldiers are praying with a great deal more earnestness, I fear, than our own troops, and expecting God to favor their side; for one of our soldiers, who had been taken prisoner, told Senator Wilson, a few days since, that he met nothing so discouraging as the evident sincerity of those he was among, in their prayers.  But we will talk over the merits of the case.  \"What good would a Proclamation of Emancipation from me do, especially as we are now situated?  I do not want to issue a document that the whole World will see must necessarily be inoperative, like the Pope's Bull against the Comet!  Would my word free the Slaves, when I cannot even enforce the Constitution in the Rebel States?  Is there a single Court or Magistrate, or individual that would be influenced by it there? And what reason is there to think it would have any greater effect upon the Slaves than the late law of Congress, which I approved and which offers protection and Freedom to the Slaves of Rebel masters who came within our lines?  Yet I cannot learn that that law has caused a single Slave to come over to us.  \"And suppose they could be induced by a Proclamation of Freedom from me to throw themselves upon us, what should we do with them?  How can we feed and care for such a multitude?  General Butler wrote me a few days since that he was issuing more rations to the Slaves who have rushed to him, than to all the White troops under his command.  They eat, and that is all; though it is true General Butler is feeding the Whites also, by the thousand; for it nearly amounts to a famine there.  \"If, now, the pressure of the War should call off our forces from New Orleans to defend some other point, what is to prevent the masters from reducing the Blacks to Slavery again; for I am told that whenever the Rebels take any Black prisoners, Free or Slave, they immediately auction them off!  They did so with those they took from a boat that was aground in the Tennessee river a few days ago.  \"And then I am very ungenerously attacked for it!  For instance, when, after the late battles at and near Bull Run, an expedition went out from Washington, under a flag of truce, to bury the dead and bring in the wounded, and the Rebels seized the Blacks who went along to help, and sent them into Slavery, Horace Greeley said in his paper that the Government would probably do nothing about it.  What could I do?  \"Now, then, tell me, if you please, what possible result of good would follow the issuing of such a Proclamation as you desire?  Understand, I raise no objections against it on legal or Constitutional grounds, for, as Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy, in time of War, I suppose I have a right to take any measure which may best subdue the Enemy, nor do I urge objections of a moral nature, in view of possible consequences of insurrection and massacre at the South.  I view this matter as a practical War measure, to be decided on according to the advantages or disadvantages it may offer to the suppression of the Rebellion.                  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  \"I admit that Slavery is at the root of the Rebellion, or, at least, its sine qua non.  The ambition of politicians may have instigated them to act, but they would have been impotent without Slavery as their instrument.  I will also concede that Emancipation would help us in Europe, and convince them that we are incited by something more than ambition.  I grant, further, that it would help somewhat at the North, though not so much, I fear, as you and those you represent imagine.  \"Still, some additional strength would be added in that way to the War, and then, unquestionably, it would weaken the Rebels by drawing off their laborers, which is of great importance; but I am not so sure we could do much with the Blacks.  If we were to arm them, I fear that in a few weeks the arms would be in the hands of the Rebels; and, indeed, thus far, we have not had arms enough to equip our White troops.  \"I will mention another thing, though it meet only your scorn and contempt.  There are 50,000 bayonets in the Union Army from the Border Slave States.  It would be a serious matter if, in consequence of a Proclamation such as you desire, they should go over to the Rebels.  I do not think they all would--not so many, indeed, as a year ago, or as six months ago--not so many to-day, as yesterday.  Every day increases their Union feeling.  They are also getting their pride enlisted, and want to beat the Rebels.  \"Let me say one thing more: I think you should admit that we already have an important principle to rally and unite the People, in the fact that Constitutional Government is at stake.  This is a fundamental idea going down about as deep as anything!                 *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  \"Do not misunderstand me because I have mentioned these objections. They indicate the difficulties that have thus far prevented my action in some such way as you desire.  \"I have not decided against a Proclamation of Liberty to the Slaves, but hold the matter under advisement.  And I can assure you that the subject is on my mind, by day and night, more than any other.  Whatever shall appear to be God's will I will do.  \"I trust that in the freedom with which I have canvassed your views I have not in any respect injured your feelings.\"   On the 22d day of September, 1862, not only the Nation, but the whole World, was electrified by the publication--close upon the heels of the Union victory of Antietam--of the Proclamation of Emancipation--weighted with consequences so wide and far-reaching that even at this late day they cannot all be discerned.  It was in these words:    \"I, ABRAHAM LINCOLN, President of the United States of America, and Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy thereof, do hereby proclaim and declare that hereafter, as"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7138"],["title","The Great Conspiracy, Volume 6 (#1)"],["body"," said he: \"The signs look better. The Father of Waters again goes unvexed to the Sea\".       [This admirable letter, reviewing \"the situation\" and his policy,      was in these words                           EXECUTIVE MANSION,                     WASHINGTON, August 26.  1863.       HON. JAMES C. CONKLING       MY DEAR SIR; Your letter inviting me to attend a Mass Meeting of      unconditional Union men to be held at the Capital of Illinois, on      the 3rd day of September, has been received.  It would be very      agreeable for me thus to meet my old friends at my own home; but I      cannot just now be absent from here so long a time as a visit there      would require.       The meeting is to be of all those who maintain unconditional      devotion to the Union; and I am sure that my old political friends      will thank me for tendering, as I do, the Nation's gratitude to      those other noble men whom no partisan malice or partisan hope can      make false to the Nation's life.       There are those who are dissatisfied with me.  To such I would say:      you desire Peace, and you blame me that we do not have it.  But how      can we attain it?  There are but three conceivable ways: First, to      suppress the Rebellion by force of Arms.  This I am trying to do.      Are you for it?  If you are, so far we are agreed.  If you are not      for it, a second way is to give up the Union.  I am against this.      Are you for it?  If you are, you should say so plainly.  If you are      not for Force, nor yet for Dissolution, there only remains some      imaginable Compromise.       I do not believe that any Compromise embracing the maintenance of      the Union is now possible.  All that I learn leads to a directly      opposite belief.  The strength of the Rebellion is its Military,      its Army.  That Army dominates all the Country, and all the people,      within its range.  Any offer of terms made by any man or men within      that range, in opposition to that Army, is simply nothing for the      present: because such man or men have no power whatever to enforce      their side of a Compromise, if one were made with them.       To illustrate: Suppose refugees from the South, and Peace men of      the North, get together in Convention, and frame and proclaim a      Compromise embracing a restoration of the Union.  In what way can      that Compromise be used to keep Lee's Army out of Pennsylvania?      Meade's Army can keep Lee's Army out of Pennsylvania, and, I think,      can ultimately drive it out of existence.  But no paper Compromise      to which the controllers of Lee's Army are not agreed, can at all      affect that Army.  In an effort at such Compromise we would waste      time, which the Enemy would improve to our disadvantage; and that      would be all.       A Compromise, to be effective, must be made either with those who      control the Rebel Army, or with the people, first liberated from      the domination of that Army, by the success of our own Army.  Now,      allow me to assure you that no word or intimation from that Rebel      Army, or from any of the men controlling it, in relation to any      Peace Compromise, has ever come to my knowledge or belief.  All      charges and insinuations to the contrary are deceptive and      groundless.  And I promise you that if any such proposition shall      hereafter come, it shall not be rejected and kept a secret from      you.  I freely acknowledge myself to be the servant of the People,      according to the bond of service, the United States Constitution;      and that, as such, I am responsible to them.       But, to be plain.  You are dissatisfied with me about the Negro.      Quite likely there is a difference of opinion between you and      myself upon that subject.  I certainly wish that all men could be      Free, while you, I suppose, do not.  Yet I have neither adopted nor      proposed any measure which is not consistent with even your view,      provided that you are for the Union.  I suggested compensated      Emancipation; to which you replied you wished not to be taxed to      buy Negroes.  But I had not asked you to be taxed to buy Negroes,      except in such a way as to save you from greater taxation to save      the Union, exclusively by other means.       You dislike the Emancipation Proclamation, and perhaps would have      it retracted.  You say it is Unconstitutional.  I think      differently.  I think the Constitution invests the      Commander-in-Chief with the Law of War in Time of War.  The most      that can be said, if so much, is, that Slaves are property.  Is      there, has there ever been, any question that, by the Law of War,      property, both of enemies and friends, may be taken when needed?      And is it not needed whenever it helps us and hurts the Enemy?      Armies, the World over, destroy enemies' property when they cannot      use it; and even destroy their own to keep it from the Enemy.      Civilized belligerents do all in their power to help themselves or      hurt the Enemy, except a few things regarded as barbarous or cruel.      Among the exceptions are the massacre of vanquished foes and      non-combatants, male and female.       But the Proclamation, as law, either is valid or is not valid.  If      it is not valid, it needs no retraction.  If it is valid it cannot      be retracted, any more than the dead can be brought to life.  Some      of you profess to think its retraction would operate favorably for      the Union.  Why better after the retraction than before the issue?      There was more than a year and a half of trial to suppress the      Rebellion before the Proclamation was issued, the last one hundred      days of which passed under an explicit notice that it was coming,      unless averted by those in revolt returning to their allegiance.      The War has certainly progressed as favorably for us since the      issue of the Proclamation as before.       I know as fully as one can know the opinions of others that some of      the Commanders of our Armies in the field, who have given us our      most important victories, believe the Emancipation policy and the      use of Colored troops constitute the heaviest blows yet dealt to      the Rebellion, and that at least one of those important successes      could not have been achieved when it was, but for the aid of Black      soldiers.       Among the Commanders who hold these views are some who have never      had an affinity with what is called \"Abolitionism,\" or with      \"Republican party politics,\" but who hold them purely as Military      opinions.  I submit their opinions as entitled to some weight      against the objections often urged that Emancipation and arming the      Blacks are unwise as Military measures, and were not adopted as      such, in good faith.       You say that you will not fight to Free Negroes.  Some of them seem      willing to fight for you; but no matter.  Fight you, then,      exclusively to save the Union.  I issued the Proclamation on      purpose to aid you in saving the Union.  Whenever you shall have      conquered all resistance to the Union, if I shall urge you to      continue fighting, it will be an apt time then for you to declare      you will not fight to Free Negroes.  I thought that in your      struggle for the Union, to whatever extent the Negroes should cease      helping the Enemy, to that extent it weakened the Enemy in his      resistance to you.  Do you think differently?  I thought whatever      Negroes can be got to do as soldiers, leaves just so much less for      White soldiers to do in saving the Union.  Does it appear otherwise      to you?  But Negroes, like other people, act upon motives.  Why      should they do anything for us if we will do nothing for them?  If      they stake their lives for us they must be prompted by the      strongest motives, even the promise of Freedom.  And the promise,      being made, must be kept.       The signs look better.  The Father of Waters again goes unvexed to      the Sea.  Thanks to the great Northwest for it; nor yet wholly to      them.  Three hundred miles up, they met New England, Empire,      Keystone, and Jersey, hewing their way right and left.  The Sunny      South, too, in more colors than one, also lent a helping hand.  On      the spot, their part of the history was jotted down in Black and      White.  The job was a great National one, and let none be slighted      who bore an honorable part in it.  And while those who have cleared      the Great River may well be proud, even that is not all.  It is      hard to say that anything has been more bravely and well done than      at Antietam, Murfreesboro, Gettysburg, and on many fields of less      note.  Nor must Uncle Sam's web-feet be forgotten.  At all the      watery margins they have been present, not only on the deep Sea,      the broad Bay, and the rapid River, but also up the narrow, muddy      Bayou, and wherever the ground was a little damp they had been, and      made their tracks.  Thanks to all.  For the Great Republic--for the      principle it lives by, and keeps alive--for Man's vast future      --thanks to all.       Peace does not appear so distant as it did.  I hope it will come      soon, and come to stay; and so come as to be worth the keeping in      all future time.  It will then have been proved that among Freemen      there can be no successful appeal from the ballot to the bullet,      and that they who take such appeal are sure to lose their case and      pay the cost.  And there will be some Black men who can remember      that, with silent tongue, and clinched teeth, and steady eye, and      well poised bayonet, they have helped mankind on to this great      consummation, while I fear there will be some White ones unable to      forget that with malignant heart and deceitful speech they have      striven to hinder it.       Still, let us"]]]
