Everything aboard her was blown to bits.  \"There was no use trying to tow her out now.  I searched the water with my glass for living men.  I figured we might be able to save a few if any survived, although it was against admiralty orders to stop when in danger.  I didn't believe in the admiralty's stand at that moment.  But I couldn't make out a living soul.  \"The Germans immediately turned their attention to us.  Their marksmanship was getting better.  There was a frightful jar and the steering gear was wrenched out of my hands and I was thrown to the deck.  When I picked myself up there was nothing with which to steer. Our rudder and a part of our stern had been shot away--  \"'Alternate the screws!' Ames yelled.  'I'm busy with these guns. We'll fight as long as she floats!'  \"The speaking tubes existed no longer.  I stationed a man at the hatch--and another below and transmitted my orders to the engine room by them.  First we drove ahead with one screw, then with the other, to get a zig-zag course; next we backed first with one propeller and then the other.  Each time we backed farther than we went forward, for I wanted to get out of the mess if possible.  The crazy course threw the enemy gunners off somewhat.  \"Suddenly I heard a yell from Ames.  We'd put one of the German destroyers out of business.  The other one was steaming toward us, but she was a long ways off.  \"The men were cheering.  I looked at the second destroyer, thinking we must have finished her, too, but she was still firing.  Then I glanced around to see what the men were yelling about.  \"Right into that hail of fire steamed a little mine sweeper.  She looked for all the world like a tugboat.  She had a single gun mounted in her bow, and one or two amidships.  She had no armor and a rifle bullet probably would have pierced her sides with ease, but she pounded straight toward us; the water around her was beaten to a foam.  \"Far out on the prow stood a man with a coil of rope.  Ames sent a man to our stern.  The sweeper had come close.  The man in the prow swung his rope and let the coil fly.  It fell across our stern.  There wasn't much left to make it fast to, but we did it somehow and the sweeper started to tow us out of that particular part of the water.  \"Our guns continued to bark at the destroyer, which was gaining on us. Some of our shots went home.  The little old tugboat was hit once, but her master stuck to his task; and he undoubtedly saved our lives.  \"Gradually we were pulled back, till at length we were under the protection of the guns of our fleet.  From the flagship, signals were being flashed for our benefit.  Ames read the flags through his glasses.\"  \"'Congratulating us?' I asked.  \"'Blast him, no!' shouted Ames. 'He wants to know why in blazes we didn't come out when we had a chance.  Well, he wouldn't have come out himself had he been here, and I've been on the flagship, so we needn't feel sensitive about it!'  \"And that's about all,\" Jack continued, \"except for the fact that the raid by the battle fleet was given up.  We cruised about for several days, in spite of our crippled condition.  The ship's carpenter put us in condition to stay afloat, but at last we returned.  I came here the moment I had landed.\"  \"Well, you had a pretty strenuous time, if you ask me,\" declared Frank.  \"Too bad, though, that the raid couldn't have been made.  We might have captured Heligoland.\"  \"The Germans might capture Gibraltar,\" said Jack, with a vein of sarcasm in his voice, \"but I don't think they will--not right away.\"  \"It can be done, though,\" declared Frank.  \"What?  The Germans capture Gibraltar?\"  \"No, I mean the British can take Heligoland.  Wait until Uncle Sam gets in the war, he'll show you a few things.\"  \"Maybe so,\" said Jack, \"but what's all this talk I hear about the United States declaring war on Germany?\"  \"It's only talk, so far,\" said Frank, \"but it seems certain to come. In fact, the war resolution already has passed the house and is being debated in the senate.  It wouldn't surprise me if the senate passed it today.  Then all that is needed is the signature of President Wilson.\"  \"Well, let's hope there is no hitch,\" said Jack fervently.  \"I don't think there will be.  Come, let's go to our room and wait for Lord Hastings.\"  The two boys went upstairs, and while they are awaiting the arrival of Lord Hastings, a few words will be necessary to introduce them more fully.  Frank Chadwick was an American lad of possibly nineteen.  He had been in Italy when the great European war broke out, and through a misfortune had been shanghaied aboard a sailing vessel.  After some adventures he fell in with Jack Templeton, a young Englishman, who had spent most of his life on the north coast of Africa.  Together the lads had disposed of the crew of the vessel.  They became fast friends.  Fortune threw them in the path of Lord Hastings, British nobleman and secret service agent, and they had gone through all kinds of troubles with him.  Lord Hastings had commanded several vessels during the course of the war, and Jack and Frank upon these occasions had been his first officers.  Both lads spoke German and French fluently, and both had a smattering of several other tongues.  Jack was huge in stature and of enormous strength for one of his age.  Frank, on the other hand, was rather small, but what he lacked in physical strength he more than made up in courage.  Frank's greatest accomplishment, and one that had caused Jack much envy, was shooting.  He could hit almost anything with a rifle, and revolvers in his hands were no less deadly.  Frank's chief trouble was his hot-headedness and more than once this had gotten him into such trouble that it took all Jack's resourcefulness to extricate him.  Both lads had seen service in many parts of the world since they had met Lord Hastings.  Their commander recently had lost his vessel and the three had been on indefinite leave of absence.  The day before Jack's return Frank had been informed by Lord Hastings that they were about to put to sea again.  \"Well,\" said Frank, when the two were in the room always reserved for their use when they were in London, \"Lord Hastings will be glad to see you back again.  He has been anxious, especially now that he has been ordered again on active service.  He has been wondering where he would get a first officer.\"  \"I guess you could, fill that place without any trouble,\" said Jack.  \"I guess I could fill it all right, if I had to, but I would much rather have you along,\" declared Frank.  \"Well, I'm glad to be back, old fellow,\" said Jack.  \"I'll admit that for a few minutes there the other night it looked as though I would never see London again, but everything is all right at last.\"  There were the sounds of footsteps below.  These a few moments later ascended the stairs.  \"Probably Lord Hastings,\" said Frank.  The lad was right and a moment later Lord Hastings stepped into the room.  His eyes fell upon Jack and he advanced with outstretched hand.  \"Jack!\" he exclaimed.  \"I certainly am glad to see you again.\"  They shook hands heartily.      CHAPTER III  SAILING   \"Frank tells me,\" said Jack, at the dinner table that evening, \"that we are about to sail again; about to go into active service.\"  Lord Hastings smiled.  \"There has been a slight alteration in plans since I spoke to Frank last,\" he said.  \"You mean that we are not to go, Sir?\" asked Frank.  His face showed his disappointment.  \"Not exactly,\" said Lord Hastings.  \"But,\" Jack interrupted, \"Frank said that we would help convoy American troops to England and France.\"  \"Frank lets his imagination run away with him sometimes,\" said Lord Hastings quietly.  \"America has not yet declared war on Germany.\"  \"But she will, sir,\" said Frank positively.  \"That is probably true,\" said Lord Hastings, \"although the resolution is being fought in the senate, according to latest cable advices. However, as you say, America will undoubtedly declare war.  But even should American troops be sent to Europe it will not be for several months after war is declared.\"  \"I thought they would send the regulars right away, sir,\" said Frank.  \"Hardly.  However, it is possible that an American fleet will be dispatched to act in conjunction with the British grand fleet in the war zone.\"  \"Then we must sit home, sir?\" asked Frank.  \"I didn't say that,\" said Lord Hastings, smiling.  \"You are too quick to jump at conclusions, Frank.\"  Frank flushed a trifle.  \"I'm just disappointed, sir,\" he replied.  \"You need not be,\" said Lord Hastings.  \"There is work ahead.  In fact, I may say that you will leave England some time tomorrow.\"  \"Is that so, sir?\" exclaimed Frank, happy again instantly.  \"Where do we go, sir?\"  \"I am not going at all,\" said Lord Hastings; \"at least, not for some time yet.  You and Jack will make this trip alone.\"  \"That's too bad,\" declared Jack quietly.  \"We always like to have you with us, sir.\"  \"I know you do,\" laughed Lord Hastings,  \"However, I will turn up later, so don't worry.\"  \"In that event, it's all right,\" grinned Jack.  \"Will you, tell us where we are going, sir, and what we are to do?\" asked Frank.  \"I will if you will restrain your impatience,\" said Lord Hastings.  Frank felt this rebuke and became silent.  A moment later Lord Hastings continued:  \"I suppose you have heard that there is another German raider operating in the Atlantic off the coast of South America?\"  \"No, sir,\" said Frank, \"I had not heard of it.\"  \"Nor I,\" said Jack.  \"Nevertheless, it's true,\" said Lord Hastings.  \"Where it came from no one seems to know, but many merchant ships have been sunk by this raider.  It is understood that she has citizens of allied countries aboard to the number of several hundred.\"  \"Must be a big ship, sir,\" said Frank.  \"So it is.  It is probably a converted liner.\"  \"Well, why haven't some of our cruisers picked it up, sir?\" Jack wanted to know.  \"They've tried hard enough,\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6072"],["title","The Boy Allies with Uncle Sam's Cruisers (#2)"],["body"," Lord Hastings.  \"Trouble is this raider seems to have the heels of all ships of war.  She simply runs away from them.  However, the activities of the raider have become so serious that the government has decided she must be captured at all hazards.\"  \"Which is where we come in,\" guessed Frank.  Lord Hastings gazed at the lad sternly.  \"Frank,\" he said, \"it's a wonder to me that your tongue hasn't got you into trouble long ago.  Now, if you'll listen, I'll proceed.\"  Frank sat back abashed.  \"Excuse me, sir,\" he said.  \"It won't happen again.\"  \"All right, then,\" said Lord Hastings.  \"As I say, it seems impossible to come up with this raider by speed, so she must be captured or sunk by strategy.  Now, I'll explain the plans to you, that you may know what to do and what will be expected of you.\"  Lord Hastings talked slowly for several hours, and the lads listened with unflagging interest.  When His Lordship had finished it was almost midnight.  \"Now, are you sure you understand?\" he asked, getting to his feet.  \"Perfectly, sir,\" was the reply.  \"Very well, then, you had better turn in.  You will sail aboard the Algonquin at five tomorrow evening.  I will see that your reservations are made and that you are supplied with sufficient funds.\"  The lads went to bed.  When Jack and Frank went aboard the Algonquin the following evening half an hour before the sailing hour, they were dressed as civilians. Each wore a heavy traveling suit and overcoat and a steamer cap.  Lord Hastings accompanied them aboard and introduced them to the captain, Stoneman by name, with whom His Lordship was well acquainted.  Then Lord Hastings went ashore.  The Algonquin was an American vessel and sailed under American registry.  \"I don't believe any raider will bother us,\" said Jack.  \"Never can tell,\" declared Frank.  \"What's our destination, anyhow?  I forgot to ask.\"  \"Buenos Ayres,\" replied Jack.  \"Wonder if there are many passengers aboard?\"  \"Doesn't look like it.  We'll have a look at the passenger list.\"  They did so and found that the only passengers on the trip were two women, registered as Mrs. Silas Wheaton and Miss Elizabeth Wheaton.  \"Looks like we would be pretty much to our ourselves,\" grinned Jack.  \"So much the better,\" said Frank.  The Algonquin was not, in the true sense of the word, a passenger steamer.  She had accommodations for some, but she was primarily a freighter, detoured this trip to carry a cargo of oil to the Argentine capital.  The vessel lifted anchor and steamed down the Thames promptly at 5 o'clock.  At 6 the lads found themselves at dinner at the captain's table.  There, too, they found Mrs. Wheaton and her daughter, Elizabeth.  Introductions followed.  \"I do hope we do not meet a submarine on the way,\" declared Miss Wheaton, who could not have been more than eighteen.  \"I guess we are safe enough on that score,\" smiled Jack.  \"Then they tell me there is a German raider operating off the coast of South America,\" said the girl.  \"We may be captured.\"  \"Pooh!\" exclaimed her mother.  \"Didn't I see guns front and back on this ship as I came abroad?\"  \"You mean fore and aft, mother,\" said the girl, smiling.  \"Yes, I saw the guns, too, but I don't imagine they would be much protection against a German raider.\"  \"Then what are they there for?\" Mrs. Wheaton wanted to know.  Jack and Frank laughed, and Captain Stoneman allowed a smile to wrinkle the corners of his mouth.  \"Well, they won't dare attack us,\" said Mrs. Wheaton.  \"If they do the United States will make Germany pay for it.\"  \"I guess Germany is not worrying about the United States right now,\" said Jack quietly.  \"We'll make her worry,\" declared the woman.  \"We're going to declare war and then the Kaiser will wish he had let us alone.  Besides, there are probably American ships of war off the coast of South America.  They will not allow us to be molested by a German raider.\"  \"But, perhaps they won't be able to help it,\" mother, said the girl.  \"Of course they will be able to help it,\" said the mother.  \"Now don't talk about this foolishness to me any more.\"  She arose and left the table.  Her daughter followed her a few moments later.  \"If the Germans get her they'll find they have caught a tartar,\" declared Jack.  \"So they will,\" declared Captain Stoneman.  \"By the way, Captain,\" said Frank, \"do you fear the raider will attack us?\"  \"She will if she knows we are around,\" declared the captain grimly.  \"And we are not prepared to fight her, sir?\" asked Frank.  \"Hardly,\" said the captain quietly.  \"What's your crew?\" demanded Jack.  \"First, second and third officers, chief engineer, assistant and forty men,\" was the reply.  \"And nothing worth while to shoot with,\" grinned Frank.  The captain brought his hand down hard upon the table.  \"No!\" he bellowed.  \"And still with these pirates sailing the seas, the American government won't allow us to carry guns big enough to do any damage.\"  \"Well, we'll hope for the best,\" said Frank, rising.  The lads made their way on deck.      CHAPTER IV  THE RAIDER  Word of the United States' declaration of war upon Germany was flashed to the Algonquin on the fourth day out.  It brought a thrill to Frank and to Captain Stoneman, an American himself.  Mrs. Wheaton, however, was the only person aboard who did any bragging as a result of it.  She declared that now the United States had come to the rescue of the world, she had no fear of German raiders or Germans in any other shape or form.  The Algonquin was still two days out from Buenos Ayres.  It was night. Came a hail from the lookout forward,  \"Ship, sir!\" he sang out.  \"Where away?\"  demanded Captain Stoneman from the bridge.  \"Dead ahead, sir!\"  Half an hour later the light of an approaching vessel became visible to all on deck.  \"The raider, do you suppose?\" asked Frank, who stood near the captain.  \"How do I know?\" demanded the captain angrily.  \"It may be and it may not be.\"  A moment later the searchlight of the approaching vessel picked the Algonquin out of the darkness.  \"Drat those searchlights!\" shouted the angry captain.  \"If it wasn't for those things a man would have a chance.\"  The wireless operator hurried up.  \"Message, sir,\" he exclaimed.  \"Well, why don't you give it to me.  What are you standing there for?\"  \"Vessel orders us to heave to or she'll put a shell into us, sir,\" said the operator, paying no attention to the captain's anger.  \"She will, eh?  What right has a bloodthirsty pirate like that to tell me what I can do?  I won't do it.\"  Nevertheless Captain Stoneman gave the command to heave to.  \"What's he sign himself?\" he demanded of the wireless operator.  \"He doesn't sign himself at all,\" was the reply.  \"Drat him!\" exclaimed the captain again.  \"Oh, well, we'll see what happens.\"  Half an hour later a small boat from the vessel that had accosted them scraped alongside the Algonquin.  \"Throw over a ladder,\" came a voice in English.  \"I'm coming aboard you.\"  The captain of the Algonquin growled again but he gave the necessary order.  A moment later three figures scrambled on deck.  At sight of the first man, Captain Stoneman's frown changed to a smile and he stepped quickly forward.  \"Dash me if it isn't Lansing!\" he exclaimed.  \"When did you get into the service, old man?\"  The man in the uniform of a naval officer looked at the captain closely a moment, then extended a hand.  \"Well, well, well!\" he exclaimed.  \"If it isn't Stoneman.  Where you bound, Captain?\"  \"Buenos Ayres.  What ship are you?\"  \"American cruiser Pioneer, Stoneman.  I'm the first officer.\"  \"Good for you, son,\" exclaimed the captain.  \"First I took you for that German raider they say is sailing about in these parts.\"  \"That's what I took you to be,\" declared the lieutenant.  \"I know there is no need searching your ship, Captain.  You're true blue, but I'll have to have a look at your papers.\"  \"Perfectly proper,\" said Captain Stoneman.  \"Come below.\"  The two disappeared below, but returned on deck a few moments later.  \"Who are your passengers, Captain?\" asked the American officer.  Captain Stoneman explained.  \"Guess I'd better have a look at them anyhow, if it's no trouble,\" said the lieutenant.  \"No trouble at all, Bo's'n,\" he called, \"summon all passengers on deck.\"  Frank and Jack were already there, and approached.  The American officer asked them a few questions, and then waved them away.  \"All right,\" he said.  Mrs. Wheaton and her daughter appeared a few moments later.  The former was angry. She approached the lieutenant.  \"What do you mean by holding us up in this high-handed fashion?\" she demanded.  \"Necessity of war, madam,\" said the lieutenant with a bow.  \"Necessity fiddlesticks,\" was the reply.  \"Who are you, anyhow?\"  \"I'm Lieutenant Lansing, American cruiser Pioneer, madam,\" came the reply.  Mrs. Wheaton's manner underwent an immediate change.  \"You'll pardon me, Lieutenant,\" she exclaimed.  \"Of course, I know you must do your duty.\"  After a few words with Mrs. Wheaton and her daughter, Lieutenant Lansing turned again to Captain Stoneman.  \"All right, Captain,\" he said, \"you may proceed.  If leave you now just a word, though.  Look out for that raider.  She's around here some place.  If you sight her, fire your guns, and if I'm within hearing I'll come up.  Work your wireless, too.  I'm here to nail that fellow.\"  \"Very good,\" said Captain Stoneman.  \"You can count on me, Lansing.\"  The two men shook hands and the American naval officer, followed by his men, disappeared over the side.  Captain Stoneman gave a signal and the Algonquin moved on again.  \"Didn't take the United States very long to get started, did it?\" said Frank, as they descended below.  \"I should say not,\" was Jack's reply.  \"Still, I am afraid American cruisers will have no more success in nabbing the raider than have British vessels.\"  \"Don't forget we're on the job,\" said Frank, with a smile.  \"I'm not forgetting it,\" said Jack.  \"The sooner we come up with that fellow the"]]]
