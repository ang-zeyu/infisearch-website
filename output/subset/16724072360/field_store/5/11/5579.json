Consequently, Earth's long week is now drawing to a close, and we stand at the present moment in the Saturday Evening of Time, at or near the end of the sixth day of human history. Is it not a time for thought, a season for solemn meditation? Morning will break upon the Millennium, the thousand years of peace, the Sabbath of the World!  _House-Cleaning in Progress._--Marvel not, therefore, that all things are in commotion. War, famine, pestilence, earthquake, tempest and tidal wave--these are among the predicted signs of the Savior's second coming. [12] Tyranny and wickedness must be overthrown, and the way prepared for Him who, though gracious and merciful to all, and forgiving to sinners who repent, \"cannot look upon sin with the least degree of allowance.\" [13] Earth must be freed from oppression and cleansed from all iniquity. It is God's House; and He is coming to live in it, and to make of it a glorified mansion. House-cleaning is in progress, and Saturday's work must be done and out of the way, before the Lord of the Sabbath appears.

ARTICLE TWO.  _The Watch on the Tower._  _\"Haunted Houses.\"_--Several years since, a learned gentleman was lecturing in some of our Utah towns, taking for his theme \"Haunted Houses.\" That was his way of describing the situation of those who put faith in prophets, visions and revelations, as among the means whereby God communicates with man. He invited all such to come out of their \"haunted houses,\" and build for their souls \"more stately mansions,\" founded upon the rock of reason and scientific truth. The lecturer had special reference, of course, to the followers of the Prophet Joseph Smith.  _A Fundamental Belief._--A belief in prophets and in spiritual gifts, whereby come visions, revelations, and miraculous \"signs,\" following and confirming full and true belief, [1] is fundamental with the Latter-day Saints. We regard the founding of our Church as a fulfillment of prophecy, [2] and recognize in the decadence of long established systems of religion, a result of failure to be guided and governed by the teachings and warnings of men divinely inspired. \"Where there is no vision, the people perish.\" [3] Where there is no revelation, spiritual darkness reigns.  _Not a Chance World._--We are not living in a world of chance. Things do not occur haphazardly, without the care or cognizance of the omniscient and omnipotent Ruler. Not a sparrow falls to the ground without his notice. Design, not accident, governs the universe. Neither man nor Satan, though exercising to the full his free agency, can possibly thwart the Divine Will. With all their schemings and strivings, they are powerless to destroy or disarrange God's Plan, or to hinder the fulfillment of prophecy. All things, both the evil and the good, are overruled in a way to subserve one and the same great end--_What Eternal Wisdom decreed before the foundation of the world_.  _The Function of Prophecy._--The need for prophecy must be evident to any pious and reflective mind. Prophets are as watchmen on the tower, noting the time of night, telling of the approaching dawn. \"Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.\" [4] This means, as I interpret it, that the all-wise Dispenser of human affairs will neither cause nor permit any event to take place, concerning which the world need to have fore-knowledge, until he has communicated with his chosen servants, his oracles among men, and has given them due notice of its approach.  To warn mankind of impending judgments; to prepare His people, and through them the world at large, for changes that must come in the carrying out of the divine program--changes necessary to human progress--is the function of those who see into the future and make known the word and will of the Universal Father.  _Time for Preparation._--Even without the Prophet Amos and his inspired utterance, we have every reason to feel assured, from what we know of the divine attributes, that God, in his dealings with man, harbors no intent to take what is known as \"a snap judgment.\" His object being to save, not to destroy, it is very far from his design that the world shall be caught unawares, that men or nations shall be involved in trouble of which they have had no warning, and for which, consequently, they could make no preparation. The promised sending of Elijah the Prophet \"before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord,\" was in order that certain things might be done which, if left undone, would cause that \"coming\" to \"smite the earth with a curse.\" [5]  Not that the Lord wishes to curse. His object, even in chastisement, is to bless. [6] But a want of preparedness can change a blessing into a curse. Messiah's glorious appearing will be a wonderful blessing to the earth and its inhabitants, provided they are made ready for it. But a lack of readiness on their part would convert the boon into a calamity. Hence the need of preparation and of previous notice. Whether weal or woe is wending its way earthward, it is only fair that men should be told of it in advance.  _The Supernatural Discredited._--But there is a proneness in human nature to discredit the Heaven-sent messenger. Almost invariably the supernatural is discounted, if not derided, by ultra-practical minds. All miracles are myths to the agnostic intellect. \"The natural man is an enemy to God.\"  _Dead Prophets Preferred._--Even those who revere the prophets of the past are tempted to ignore the prophets of the present. It seems natural to turn from What Is and bow down to What Has Been. Not only prophets, but poets, philosophers, and other wise and worthy teachers have been treated in this manner.    \"Seven cities claimed the birth of Homer, dead,   Through which the living Homer begged for bread.\"  The Savior reproved the pious unbelievers of his generation for \"garnishing the sepulchres of the righteous,\" the dead seers and revelators, and at the same time rejecting the living worthies, as their fathers had done before them. [7] A professed reverence for Moses and the old-time prophets was a prominent characteristic of those who spurned the greatest of all prophets, the very Son of God, concerning whom Moses and other seers had testified. And this same spirit, the spirit that crucified the Christ, has caused the martyrdom of His servants in all ages.  _Counterfeit and Genuine._--For the widely prevalent distrust felt toward men who come burdened with a message from on High, false prophets and the mischief they have wrought are largely responsible. But distrust, no less than credulity, can be overdone. Caution against imposition is commendable, but doubt that rejects truth is to be deprecated and condemned. All prophets are not false. There can be no counterfeit without a genuine; and to proclaim against the one is virtually to concede the existence of the other.  _A Test of Prophecy._--A simple and sure test of prophecy is furnished in the following passage of Holy Writ: \"When a prophet speaketh in the name of the Lord, if the thing follow not nor come to pass, that is the thing which the Lord hath not spoken, but the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously.\" [8] By this standard of judgment can be tested all that prophetic inspiration has ever uttered. Given enough time, \"the thing\" will clearly demonstrate whether or not it was \"spoken presumptuously.\"  _A Serious Situation._--Ponder upon this, ye who hear the testimonies of the Elders of Israel, preaching the restored Gospel of the Kingdom as a final witness to the nations. And when you see coming to pass, in these days of war, pestilence and calamity, the predictions of ancient and modern seers, give a thought, a serious thought to the situation. Ask yourselves if you can afford to be classed, either with those who look upon believers in spiritual gifts as deluded dupes living in \"haunted houses,\" or with those who extol the prophets of former ages, and persecute or ignore the prophets of the present time.

ARTICLE THREE.  _Concerning Names and Vocations._  _Is Not This The Farmer's Son?_--Some such paraphrase was probably in the mind, possibly upon the lips, of more than one opponent of the religion termed \"Mormonism,\" when its supposed author, Joseph Smith, started out upon his remarkable career. And it was deemed by them, no doubt, a sufficient answer to his extraordinary claims.  _True and False Standards._--\"A tree is known by its fruit.\" This proverb, accepted by the wise and just almost as a truism, seems to have no place in the philosophy of some people, especially when a servant of the Lord is the object of their critical contemplation. \"What do men say of him?\" is frequently the only criterion by which such a character is judged. And is it not manifestly unfair? When a prophet comes from God with a message "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/56691"],["title","Saturday Night Thoughts (#2)"],["body","mankind, what matters the name given to that message, or to that messenger, by those unfriendly to the cause he represents?  _\"The Carpenter's Son.\"_--Those who rejected the Man of Nazareth when he proclaimed himself the Son of God, doubtless thought they had disposed of him effectually by referring to him sneeringly as \"The carpenter's son;\" this slight, with others put upon him by his neighbors, causing Jesus to remark: \"A prophet is not without honor save in his own country and in his own house.\" [1]  _Effect of Nearness._--His nearness was against him. There was no \"distance\" to \"lend enchantment to the view.\" His name and humble vocation made his marvelous claims seem impossible. It could not be that God would make a prophet out of a carpenter's son--a prophet mightier than Moses or any of the ancient seers--and give to him such a common name as Jesus, another form of Joshua. [2] It was unbelievable, absurd, to most. Therefore were they justified, as they supposed, in withholding from him recognition and honor. \"And He did not many mighty works there, because of their unbelief.\"  _History Repeats._--As with the carpenter's, so with the farmer's son--each was objected to upon similar grounds. Nor was it a new thing in human experience. That which called forth criticism had occurred many times in other ages when God had raised up prophets and seers. Probably most of them were selected from among the plain people, and were comparatively unknown to men when the Lord called them.  _Moses an Exception._--Moses was a signal exception. He had been reared as a prince in the palace of the king of Egypt; but that was because Pharaoh's daughter, having found the homeless infant at the water's edge, thenceforth had charge of him and his education. Prince he was, regardless of that princely training; but he was not the only prince in Israel. They were \"a nation of kings and priests,\" though most of them walked in ways that were lowly.  _A Herdsman Prophet._--Prophets are not chosen for their worldly culture or their social position. A plain-going farmer, no less than a college professor, may be gifted with prophetic power and be called to exercise it for the good of his fellows. Amos, according to his own statement, \"was no prophet,\" nor \"a prophet's son.\" That is to say, he had not been trained in any school of the prophets, such as existed in Old Testament times. [3] He was not, like Jeremiah, the son of a priest. [4] He was a herdsman and a fruit-gatherer when the word of the Lord came to him: \"Go, prophesy unto my people Israel.\" [5]  _Prophets Foreordained._--A prophet's name, his place of birth, and the character of his everyday calling, are matters of little moment compared with other things pertaining to him. What of his state and standing before he came on earth? This is a far more important consideration. God's prophets are chosen before they are born, [6] and are sent into the world as He needs them. Their aims are high and holy. They desire the welfare and happiness of the race. Yet almost invariably their motives are misunderstood, and they and their followers are opposed and persecuted.  _The Vital Question._--Does this man come from God? That is the only question worthy of immediate attention, when a prophet, or one professing to be such appears. And his word alone need not be taken as conclusive. There are ways and means of testing a prophet's claim--and that, too, without awaiting the fulfillment or non-fulfillment of some prediction by or concerning him. Honest, prayerful men and women, with even moderate discernment, need not be deceived by any pious or impious pretender. God would not leave his children at the mercy of imposters. The sheep have a right to be protected from the wolves.  _\"Try the Spirits.\"_--\"Many false prophets are gone out into the world.\" [7] But there is a Spirit that discerns between true and false, between spurious and genuine, and anyone who seeks it aright may have \"the inspiration of the Almighty,\" which giveth to the spirit of man \"understanding.\" [8] Moreover, the Letter as well as the Spirit is a guide. What has been revealed in times past helps to interpret what is now revealed. Truth is always consistent with itself. Heaven-inspired men do not contradict one another. Their teachings harmonize and are dependable. The spirit of contention is essentially evil. [9] \"To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.\" [10]  _\"Old Joe Smith.\"_--Were these tests applied to Joseph Smith in the early part of the nineteenth century? Yes, by some; and they received the promised testimony of the Truth, the absolute evidence of the divinity of this Prophet's mission. But by far the greater number of those to whom he fain would have ministered, rejected him summarily and without investigation. To them he was only \"Joe Smith\"--\"Old Joe Smith\"--old indeed in wisdom, though young in earthly years, yielding up his life as a martyr at the early age of thirty-eight. His claim to being an oracle of God was deemed preposterous, blasphemous; and his religion, the pure Gospel of Christ, was denounced as the world's worst delusion and snare.  _Badges of Honor._--But bad names, wrongly bestowed, hurt the giver, rather than the receiver. Blame and ridicule, when applied to the righteous, are badges of honor, worn by true prophets and true principles in all ages. It does not do away with a man of God to pelt him with nicknames and opprobrious epithets. Persecution may end his earthly career, but it cannot confute his claim nor invalidate his testimony. The name of the martyred modern Seer, despite the clouds of calumny enveloping it, shines out from amidst the darkness that comprehended him not. His glorious Lord and Master, crucified as an imposter, put to death for maintaining that he was more than the world believed him to be, gave the only Name given under heaven whereby men can be saved.

ARTICLE FOUR.  _The Choice Seer._  _A Prenatal Naming._--Let us now take a closer view of this marvelous man, Joseph Smith, the most extraordinary character that has appeared upon our planet in the past two thousand years. His coming into the world fulfilled a prophecy uttered many centuries before his birth--a prophecy concerning \"a choice seer,\" to be raised up \"out of the loins\" of Joseph who was sold into Egypt. The seer's name was likewise to be Joseph, and this also was to be the name of his father. [1] That prophecy was fulfilled in Joseph Smith, Jr., the founder of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. \"Joseph the Seer\"--so is he designated by divine revelation. [2]  Like great Cyrus, who liberated the Jews from their captivity in Babylon, [3] the Lord's anointed in modern times, raised up to begin the work of Israel's final and complete redemption, was named and his mission outlined long before he had tabernacled in the flesh. Why he came gifted with the power of seership, was made manifest at the very beginning of his career.  _Birth and Parentage._--Joseph the Seer was born at Sharon, Vermont, two days before Christmas, in the year 1805. When only a lad, living with his parents, Joseph and Lucy Smith, honest farm folk in the backwoods of Western New York, his career as a prophet began.  _In Quest of Wisdom._--Partly from the effects of a religious revival held in his neighborhood, he became much concerned upon the subject of his soul's salvation, but was bewildered and unable to make choice of a church or creed, owing to the diverse and conflicting claims of the various Christian sects. While in this mood, he chanced upon the following passage of scripture: \"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.\" [4] Deeply impressed with the sacred words, he forthwith resolved to ask from God the wisdom of which he stood in need.  _The First Vision._--Retiring to a grove near his father's home, he knelt in prayer to the Most High; but had scarcely begun his humble and earnest petition, when he was seized upon by a power that filled his soul with horror and paralyzed his tongue so that he could no longer speak. So terrible was the visitation, that he almost gave way to despair. Yet he continued to pray--in thought, with \"the soul's sincere desire\"--and just at the moment when he feared he must abandon himself to destruction, he saw, directly over his head, a light more brilliant than the noonday sun. In the midst of a pillar of glory he beheld two beings in human form, one of whom, pointing to the other, said: \"This is my beloved Son, hear Him.\" [5]  _All Churches Astray._--With the appearance of the Light, the boy found himself delivered from the fettering power of the Evil One. As soon as he could again command utterance, he inquired of his heavenly visitants which of all the religious denominations was right--which one was the true Church of Christ? To his astonishment, he was told that none of them was right; that they had all gone out of the way. Their creeds were an abomination, and their professors corrupt. \"They draw near to me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me; they teach for doctrine the commandments of men, having a form of godliness, but they deny the power thereof.\" So spake the Son of God concerning the churches. [6] He declared that he did not recognize any of them; but was about to restore the Everlasting Gospel, with the powers of the Eternal Priesthood, and establish his Church once more in the"]]]
