In the principles of religion and morality, Miss Sedley will be found worthy of an establishment which has been honoured by the presence of THE GREAT LEXICOGRAPHER, and the patronage of the admirable Mrs. Chapone.  In leaving the Mall, Miss Amelia carries with her the hearts of her companions, and the affectionate regards of her mistress, who has the honour to subscribe herself,  Madam, Your most obliged humble servant, BARBARA PINKERTON  P.S.--Miss Sharp accompanies Miss Sedley.  It is particularly requested that Miss Sharp's stay in Russell Square may not exceed ten days.  The family of distinction with whom she is engaged, desire to avail themselves of her services as soon as possible.   This letter completed, Miss Pinkerton proceeded to write her own name, and Miss Sedley's, in the fly-leaf of a Johnson's Dictionary--the interesting work which she invariably presented to her scholars, on their departure from the Mall.  On the cover was inserted a copy of \"Lines addressed to a young lady on quitting Miss Pinkerton's school, at the Mall; by the late revered Doctor Samuel Johnson.\" In fact, the Lexicographer's name was always on the lips of this majestic woman, and a visit he had paid to her was the cause of her reputation and her fortune.  Being commanded by her elder sister to get \"the Dictionary\" from the cupboard, Miss Jemima had extracted two copies of the book from the receptacle in question.  When Miss Pinkerton had finished the inscription in the first, Jemima, with rather a dubious and timid air, handed her the second.  \"For whom is this, Miss Jemima?\" said Miss Pinkerton, with awful coldness.  \"For Becky Sharp,\" answered Jemima, trembling very much, and blushing over her withered face and neck, as she turned her back on her sister. \"For Becky Sharp: she's going too.\"  \"MISS JEMIMA!\" exclaimed Miss Pinkerton, in the largest capitals. \"Are you in your senses? Replace the Dixonary in the closet, and never venture to take such a liberty in future.\"  \"Well, sister, it's only two-and-ninepence, and poor Becky will be miserable if she don't get one.\"  \"Send Miss Sedley instantly to me,\" said Miss Pinkerton. And so venturing not to say another word, poor Jemima trotted off, exceedingly flurried and nervous.  Miss Sedley's papa was a merchant in London, and a man of some wealth; whereas Miss Sharp was an articled pupil, for whom Miss Pinkerton had done, as she thought, quite enough, without conferring upon her at parting the high honour of the Dixonary.  Although schoolmistresses' letters are to be trusted no more nor less than churchyard epitaphs; yet, as it sometimes happens that a person departs this life who is really deserving of all the praises the stone cutter carves over his bones; who IS a good Christian, a good parent, child, wife, or husband; who actually DOES leave a disconsolate family to mourn his loss; so in academies of the male and female sex it occurs every now and then that the pupil is fully worthy of the praises bestowed by the disinterested instructor. Now, Miss Amelia Sedley was a young lady of this singular species; and deserved not only all that Miss Pinkerton said in her praise, but had many charming qualities which that pompous old Minerva of a woman could not see, from the differences of rank and age between her pupil and herself.  For she could not only sing like a lark, or a Mrs. Billington, and dance like Hillisberg or Parisot; and embroider beautifully; and spell as well as a Dixonary itself; but she had such a kindly, smiling, tender, gentle, generous heart of her own, as won the love of everybody who came near her, from Minerva herself down to the poor girl in the scullery, and the one-eyed tart-woman's daughter, who was permitted to vend her wares once a week to the young ladies in the Mall.  She had twelve intimate and bosom friends out of the twenty-four young ladies. Even envious Miss Briggs never spoke ill of her; high and mighty Miss Saltire (Lord Dexter's granddaughter) allowed that her figure was genteel; and as for Miss Swartz, the rich woolly-haired mulatto from St. Kitt's, on the day Amelia went away, she was in such a passion of tears that they were obliged to send for Dr. Floss, and half tipsify her with salvolatile.  Miss Pinkerton's attachment was, as may be supposed from the high position and eminent virtues of that lady, calm and dignified; but Miss Jemima had already whimpered several times at the idea of Amelia's departure; and, but for fear of her sister, would have gone off in downright hysterics, like the heiress (who paid double) of St. Kitt's.  Such luxury of grief, however, is only allowed to parlour-boarders. Honest Jemima had all the bills, and the washing, and the mending, and the puddings, and the plate and crockery, and the servants to superintend.  But why speak about her?  It is probable that we shall not hear of her again from this moment to the end of time, and that when the great filigree iron gates are once closed on her, she and her awful sister will never issue therefrom into this little world of history.  But as we are to see a great deal of Amelia, there is no harm in saying, at the outset of our acquaintance, that she was a dear little creature; and a great mercy it is, both in life and in novels, which (and the latter especially) abound in villains of the most sombre sort, that we are to have for a constant companion so guileless and good-natured a person.  As she is not a heroine, there is no need to describe her person; indeed I am afraid that her nose was rather short than otherwise, and her cheeks a great deal too round and red for a heroine; but her face blushed with rosy health, and her lips with the freshest of smiles, and she had a pair of eyes which sparkled with the brightest and honestest good-humour, except indeed when they filled with tears, and that was a great deal too often; for the silly thing would cry over a dead canary-bird; or over a mouse, that the cat haply had seized upon; or over the end of a novel, were it ever so stupid; and as for saying an unkind word to her, were any persons hard-hearted enough to do so--why, so much the worse for them.  Even Miss Pinkerton, that austere and godlike woman, ceased scolding her after the first time, and though she no more comprehended sensibility than she did Algebra, gave all masters and teachers particular orders to treat Miss Sedley with the utmost gentleness, as harsh treatment was injurious to her.  So that when the day of departure came, between her two customs of laughing and crying, Miss Sedley was greatly puzzled how to act. She was glad to go home, and yet most woefully sad at leaving school.  For three days before, little Laura Martin, the orphan, followed her about like a little dog.  She had to make and receive at least fourteen presents--to make fourteen solemn promises of writing every week: \"Send my letters under cover to my grandpapa, the Earl of Dexter,\" said Miss Saltire (who, by the way, was rather shabby).  \"Never mind the postage, but write every day, you dear darling,\" said the impetuous and woolly-headed, but generous and affectionate Miss Swartz; and the orphan little Laura Martin (who was just in round-hand), took her friend's hand and said, looking up in her face wistfully, \"Amelia, when I write to you I shall call you Mamma.\" All which details, I have no doubt, JONES, who reads this book at his Club, will pronounce to be excessively foolish, trivial, twaddling, and ultra-sentimental.  Yes; I can see Jones at this minute (rather flushed with his joint of mutton and half pint of wine), taking out his pencil and scoring under the words \"foolish, twaddling,\" &c., and adding to them his own remark of \"QUITE TRUE.\" Well, he is a lofty man of genius, and admires the great and heroic in life and novels; and so had better take warning and go elsewhere.  Well, then.  The flowers, and the presents, and the trunks, and bonnet-boxes of Miss Sedley having been arranged by Mr. Sambo in the carriage, together with a very small and weather-beaten old cow's-skin trunk with Miss Sharp's card neatly nailed upon it, which was delivered by Sambo with a grin, and packed by the coachman with a corresponding sneer--the hour for parting came; and the grief of that moment was considerably lessened by the admirable discourse which Miss Pinkerton addressed to her pupil.  Not that the parting speech caused Amelia to philosophise, or that it armed her in any way with a calmness, the result of argument; but it was intolerably dull, pompous, and tedious; and having the fear of her schoolmistress greatly before her eyes, Miss Sedley did not venture, in her presence, to give way to any ebullitions of private grief.  A seed-cake and a bottle of wine were produced in the drawing-room, as on the solemn occasions of the visits of parents, and these refreshments being partaken of, Miss Sedley was at liberty to depart.  \"You'll go in and say good-by to Miss Pinkerton, Becky!\" said Miss Jemima to a young lady of whom nobody took any notice, and who was coming downstairs with her own bandbox.  \"I suppose I must,\" said Miss Sharp calmly, and much to the wonder of Miss Jemima; and the latter having knocked at the door, and receiving permission to come in, Miss Sharp advanced in a very unconcerned manner, and said in French, and with a perfect accent, \"Mademoiselle, je viens vous faire mes adieux.\"  Miss Pinkerton did not understand French; she only directed those who did: but biting her lips and throwing up her venerable and Roman-nosed head (on the top of which figured a large and solemn turban), she said, \"Miss Sharp, I wish you a good morning.\" As the Hammersmith Semiramis spoke, she waved one hand, both by way of adieu, and to give Miss Sharp an opportunity of shaking one of the fingers of the hand which was left out for that purpose.  Miss Sharp only folded her own hands with a very frigid smile "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/599"],["title","Vanity Fair (#2)"],["body","bow, and quite declined to accept the proffered honour; on which Semiramis tossed up her turban more indignantly than ever.  In fact, it was a little battle between the young lady and the old one, and the latter was worsted.  \"Heaven bless you, my child,\" said she, embracing Amelia, and scowling the while over the girl's shoulder at Miss Sharp.  \"Come away, Becky,\" said Miss Jemima, pulling the young woman away in great alarm, and the drawing-room door closed upon them for ever.  Then came the struggle and parting below.  Words refuse to tell it. All the servants were there in the hall--all the dear friends--all the young ladies--the dancing-master who had just arrived; and there was such a scuffling, and hugging, and kissing, and crying, with the hysterical YOOPS of Miss Swartz, the parlour-boarder, from her room, as no pen can depict, and as the tender heart would fain pass over. The embracing was over; they parted--that is, Miss Sedley parted from her friends.  Miss Sharp had demurely entered the carriage some minutes before.  Nobody cried for leaving HER.  Sambo of the bandy legs slammed the carriage door on his young weeping mistress.  He sprang up behind the carriage.  \"Stop!\" cried Miss Jemima, rushing to the gate with a parcel.  \"It's some sandwiches, my dear,\" said she to Amelia. \"You may be hungry, you know; and Becky, Becky Sharp, here's a book for you that my sister--that is, I--Johnson's Dixonary, you know; you mustn't leave us without that.  Good-by.  Drive on, coachman.  God bless you!\"  And the kind creature retreated into the garden, overcome with emotion.  But, lo! and just as the coach drove off, Miss Sharp put her pale face out of the window and actually flung the book back into the garden.  This almost caused Jemima to faint with terror.  \"Well, I never\"--said she--\"what an audacious\"--Emotion prevented her from completing either sentence.  The carriage rolled away; the great gates were closed; the bell rang for the dancing lesson.  The world is before the two young ladies; and so, farewell to Chiswick Mall.    CHAPTER II  In Which Miss Sharp and Miss Sedley Prepare to Open the Campaign  When Miss Sharp had performed the heroical act mentioned in the last chapter, and had seen the Dixonary, flying over the pavement of the little garden, fall at length at the feet of the astonished Miss Jemima, the young lady's countenance, which had before worn an almost livid look of hatred, assumed a smile that perhaps was scarcely more agreeable, and she sank back in the carriage in an easy frame of mind, saying--\"So much for the Dixonary; and, thank God, I'm out of Chiswick.\"  Miss Sedley was almost as flurried at the act of defiance as Miss Jemima had been; for, consider, it was but one minute that she had left school, and the impressions of six years are not got over in that space of time.  Nay, with some persons those awes and terrors of youth last for ever and ever.  I know, for instance, an old gentleman of sixty-eight, who said to me one morning at breakfast, with a very agitated countenance, \"I dreamed last night that I was flogged by Dr. Raine.\" Fancy had carried him back five-and-fifty years in the course of that evening.  Dr. Raine and his rod were just as awful to him in his heart, then, at sixty-eight, as they had been at thirteen.  If the Doctor, with a large birch, had appeared bodily to him, even at the age of threescore and eight, and had said in awful voice, \"Boy, take down your pant--\"? Well, well, Miss Sedley was exceedingly alarmed at this act of insubordination.  \"How could you do so, Rebecca?\" at last she said, after a pause.  \"Why, do you think Miss Pinkerton will come out and order me back to the black-hole?\" said Rebecca, laughing.  \"No: but--\"  \"I hate the whole house,\" continued Miss Sharp in a fury.  \"I hope I may never set eyes on it again.  I wish it were in the bottom of the Thames, I do; and if Miss Pinkerton were there, I wouldn't pick her out, that I wouldn't.  O how I should like to see her floating in the water yonder, turban and all, with her train streaming after her, and her nose like the beak of a wherry.\"  \"Hush!\" cried Miss Sedley.  \"Why, will the black footman tell tales?\" cried Miss Rebecca, laughing. \"He may go back and tell Miss Pinkerton that I hate her with all my soul; and I wish he would; and I wish I had a means of proving it, too. For two years I have only had insults and outrage from her. I have been treated worse than any servant in the kitchen. I have never had a friend or a kind word, except from you.  I have been made to tend the little girls in the lower schoolroom, and to talk French to the Misses, until I grew sick of my mother tongue. But that talking French to Miss Pinkerton was capital fun, wasn't it? She doesn't know a word of French, and was too proud to confess it.  I believe it was that which made her part with me; and so thank Heaven for French.  Vive la France! Vive l'Empereur! Vive Bonaparte!\"  \"O Rebecca, Rebecca, for shame!\" cried Miss Sedley; for this was the greatest blasphemy Rebecca had as yet uttered; and in those days, in England, to say, \"Long live Bonaparte!\" was as much as to say, \"Long live Lucifer!\" \"How can you--how dare you have such wicked, revengeful thoughts?\"  \"Revenge may be wicked, but it's natural,\" answered Miss Rebecca. \"I'm no angel.\" And, to say the truth, she certainly was not.  For it may be remarked in the course of this little conversation (which took place as the coach rolled along lazily by the river side) that though Miss Rebecca Sharp has twice had occasion to thank Heaven, it has been, in the first place, for ridding her of some person whom she hated, and secondly, for enabling her to bring her enemies to some sort of perplexity or confusion; neither of which are very amiable motives for religious gratitude, or such as would be put forward by persons of a kind and placable disposition.  Miss Rebecca was not, then, in the least kind or placable.  All the world used her ill, said this young misanthropist, and we may be pretty certain that persons whom all the world treats ill, deserve entirely the treatment they get.  The world is a looking-glass, and gives back to every man the reflection of his own face.  Frown at it, and it will in turn look sourly upon you; laugh at it and with it, and it is a jolly kind companion; and so let all young persons take their choice. This is certain, that if the world neglected Miss Sharp, she never was known to have done a good action in behalf of anybody; nor can it be expected that twenty-four young ladies should all be as amiable as the heroine of this work, Miss Sedley (whom we have selected for the very reason that she was the best-natured of all, otherwise what on earth was to have prevented us from putting up Miss Swartz, or Miss Crump, or Miss Hopkins, as heroine in her place!) it could not be expected that every one should be of the humble and gentle temper of Miss Amelia Sedley; should take every opportunity to vanquish Rebecca's hard-heartedness and ill-humour; and, by a thousand kind words and offices, overcome, for once at least, her hostility to her kind.  Miss Sharp's father was an artist, and in that quality had given lessons of drawing at Miss Pinkerton's school. He was a clever man; a pleasant companion; a careless student; with a great propensity for running into debt, and a partiality for the tavern.  When he was drunk, he used to beat his wife and daughter; and the next morning, with a headache, he would rail at the world for its neglect of his genius, and abuse, with a good deal of cleverness, and sometimes with perfect reason, the fools, his brother painters.  As it was with the utmost difficulty that he could keep himself, and as he owed money for a mile round Soho, where he lived, he thought to better his circumstances by marrying a young woman of the French nation, who was by profession an opera-girl.  The humble calling of her female parent Miss Sharp never alluded to, but used to state subsequently that the Entrechats were a noble family of Gascony, and took great pride in her descent from them. And curious it is that as she advanced in life this young lady's ancestors increased in rank and splendour.  Rebecca's mother had had some education somewhere, and her daughter spoke French with purity and a Parisian accent.  It was in those days rather a rare accomplishment, and led to her engagement with the orthodox Miss Pinkerton.  For her mother being dead, her father, finding himself not likely to recover, after his third attack of delirium tremens, wrote a manly and pathetic letter to Miss Pinkerton, recommending the orphan child to her protection, and so descended to the grave, after two bailiffs had quarrelled over his corpse.  Rebecca was seventeen when she came to Chiswick, and was bound over as an articled pupil; her duties being to talk French, as we have seen; and her privileges to live cost free, and, with a few guineas a year, to gather scraps of knowledge from the professors who attended the school.  She was small and slight in person; pale, sandy-haired, and with eyes habitually cast down: when they looked up they were very large, odd, and attractive; so attractive that the Reverend Mr. Crisp, fresh from Oxford, and curate to the Vicar of Chiswick, the Reverend Mr. Flowerdew, fell in love with Miss Sharp; being shot dead by a glance of her eyes which was fired all the way across Chiswick Church from the school-pew to the reading-desk.  This infatuated young man used sometimes to take tea with Miss Pinkerton, to whom he had been presented by his mamma, and actually proposed something like marriage in an intercepted note, which the one-eyed apple-woman was charged to deliver.  Mrs. Crisp was summoned from Buxton, and abruptly carried off her darling boy; but the idea, even, of such an eagle in the Chiswick dovecot caused a great flutter in the breast of Miss Pinkerton, who would have sent away Miss Sharp but that she was bound"]]]
