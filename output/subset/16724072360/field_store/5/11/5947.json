I believe a man could have got diamonds on toast if he had chosen to ask for them. However, this is apart from my story.  I had occupied the haunted chamber about two weeks before anything of importance occurred, and then it came--and a more unpleasant, ill-mannered spook never floated in the ether. He materialized about 3 A.M. and was unpleasantly sulphurous to one's perceptions. He sat upon the divan in my room, holding his knees in his hands, leering and scowling upon me as though I were the intruder, and not he.  \"Who are you?\" I asked, excitedly, as in the dying light of the log fire he loomed grimly up before me.  \"None of your business,\" he replied, insolently, showing his teeth as he spoke. \"On the other hand, who are you? This is my room, and not yours, and it is I who have the right to question. If you have any business here, well and good. If not, you will oblige me by removing yourself, for your presence is offensive to me.\"  \"I am a guest in the house,\" I answered, restraining my impulse to throw the inkstand at him for his impudence. \"And this room has been set apart for my use by my host.\"  \"One of the servant's guests, I presume?\" he said, insultingly, his lividly lavender-like lip upcurling into a haughty sneer, which was maddening to a self-respecting worm like myself.  I rose up from my bed, and picked up the poker to bat him over the head, but again I restrained myself. It will not do to quarrel, I thought. I will be courteous if he is not, thus giving a dead Englishman a lesson which wouldn't hurt some of the living.  \"No,\" I said, my voice tremulous with wrath--\"no; I am the guest of my friend Mr. Jarley, an American, who--\"  \"Same thing,\" observed the intruder, with a yellow sneer. \"Race of low-class animals, those Americans--only fit for gentlemen's stables, you know.\"  This was too much. A ghost may insult me with impunity, but when he tackles my people he must look out for himself. I sprang forward with an ejaculation of wrath, and with all my strength struck at him with the poker, which I still held in my hand. If he had been anything but a ghost, he would have been split vertically from top to toe; but as it was, the poker passed harmlessly through his misty make-up, and rent a great gash two feet long in Jarley's divan. The yellow sneer faded from his lips, and a maddening blue smile took its place.  \"Humph!\" he observed, nonchalantly. \"What a useless ebullition, and what a vulgar display of temper! Really you are the most humorous insect I have yet encountered. From what part of the States do you come? I am truly interested to know in what kind of soil exotics of your peculiar kind are cultivated. Are you part of the fauna or the flora of your tropical States--or what?\"  And then I realized the truth. There is no physical method of combating a ghost which can result in his discomfiture, so I resolved to try the intellectual. It was a mind-to-mind contest, and he was easy prey after I got going. I joined him in his blue smile, and began to talk about the English aristocracy; for I doubted not, from the spectre's manner, that he was or had been one of that class. He had about him that haughty lack of manners which bespoke the aristocrat. I waxed very eloquent when, as I say, I got my mind really going. I spoke of kings and queens and their uses in no uncertain phrases, of divine right, of dukes, earls, marquises--of all the pompous establishments of British royalty and nobility--with that contemptuously humorous tolerance of a necessary and somewhat amusing evil which we find in American comic papers. We had a battle royal for about one hour, and I must confess he was a foeman worthy of any man's steel, so long as I was reasonable in my arguments; but when I finally observed that it wouldn't be ten years before Barnum and Bailey's Greatest Show on Earth had the whole lot engaged for the New York circus season, stalking about the Madison Square Garden arena, with the Prince of Wales at the head beating a tomtom, he grew iridescent with wrath, and fled madly through the wainscoting of the room. It was purely a mental victory. All the physical possibilities of my being would have exhausted themselves futilely before him; but when I turned upon him the resources of my fancy, my imagination unrestrained, and held back by no sense of responsibility, he was as a child in my hands, obstreperous but certain to be subdued. If it were not for Mrs. Jarley's wrath--which, I admit, she tried to conceal--over the damage to her divan, I should now look back upon that visitation as the most agreeable haunting experience of my life; at any rate, it was at that time that I first learned how to handle ghosts, and since that time I have been able to overcome them without trouble-- save in one instance, with which I shall close this chapter of my reminiscences, and which I give only to prove the necessity of observing strictly one point in dealing with spectres.  [Illustration: \"HE FLED MADLY THROUGH THE WAINSCOTING OF THE ROOM\"]  It happened last Christmas, in my own home. I had provided as a little surprise for my wife a complete new solid silver service marked with her initials. The tree had been prepared for the children, and all had retired save myself. I had lingered later than the others to put the silver service under the tree, where its happy recipient would find it when she went to the tree with the little ones the next morning. It made a magnificent display: the two dozen of each kind of spoon, the forks, the knives, the coffee-pot, water -urn, and all; the salvers, the vegetable-dishes, olive-forks, cheese-scoops, and other dazzling attributes of a complete service, not to go into details, presented a fairly scintillating picture which would have made me gasp if I had not, at the moment when my own breath began to catch, heard another gasp in the corner immediately behind me. Turning about quickly to see whence it came, I observed a dark figure in the pale light of the moon which streamed in through the window.  \"Who are you?\" I cried, starting back, the physical symptoms of a ghostly presence manifesting themselves as usual.  \"I am the ghost of one long gone before,\" was the reply, in sepulchral tones.  I breathed a sigh of relief, for I had for a moment feared it was a burglar.  \"Oh!\" I said. \"You gave me a start at first. I was afraid you were a material thing come to rob me.\" Then turning towards the tree, I observed, with a wave of the hand, \"Fine lay out, eh?\"  \"Beautiful,\" he said, hollowly. \"Yet not so beautiful as things I've seen in realms beyond your ken.\"  And then he set about telling me of the beautiful gold and silver ware they used in the Elysian Fields, and I must confess Monte Cristo would have had a hard time, with Sindbad the Sailor to help, to surpass the picture of royal magnificence the spectre drew. I stood inthralled until, even as he was talking, the clock struck three, when he rose up, and moving slowly across the floor, barely visible, murmured regretfully that he must be off, with which he faded away down the back stairs. I pulled my nerves, which were getting rather strained, together again, and went to bed.  [Illustration: \"THEN HE SAT ABOUT TELLING ME OF THE BEAUTIFUL GOLD AND SILVER WARE THEY USE IN THE ELYSIAN FIELDS.\"]  _Next morning every bit of that silver-ware was gone_; and, what is more, three weeks later I found the ghost's picture in the Rogues' Gallery in New York as that of the cleverest sneak-thief in the country.  All of which, let me say to you, dear reader, in conclusion, proves that when you are dealing with ghosts you mustn't give up all your physical resources until you have definitely ascertained that the thing by which you are confronted, horrid or otherwise, is a ghost, and not an all too material rogue with a light step, and a commodious jute bag for plunder concealed beneath his coat.  \"How to tell a ghost?\" you ask.  Well, as an eminent master of fiction frequently observes in his writings, \"that is another story,\" which I shall hope some day to tell for your instruction and my own aggrandizement.     THE MYSTERY OF MY GRANDMOTHER'S HAIR SOFA   It happened last Christmas Eve, and precisely as I am about to set it forth. It has been said by critics that I am a romancer of the wildest sort, but that is where my critics are wrong. I grant that the experiences through which I have passed, some of which have contributed to the gray matter in my hair, however little they may have augmented that within my cranium--experiences which I have from time to time set forth to the best of my poor abilities in the columns of such periodicals as I have at my mercy--have been of an order so excessively supernatural as to give my critics a basis for their aspersions; but they do not know, as I do, that that basis is as uncertain as the shifting sands of the sea, inasmuch as in the setting forth of these episodes I have narrated them as faithfully as the most conscientious realist could wish, and am therefore myself a true and faithful follower of the realistic school. I cannot be blamed because these things happen to me. If I sat down in my study to imagine the strange incidents to which I have in the past called attention, with no other object in view than to make my readers unwilling to retire for the night, to destroy the peace of mind of those who are good enough to purchase my literary wares, or to titillate till tense the nerve tissue of the timid who come to smile and who depart unstrung, then should I deserve the severest condemnation; but these things I do not do. I have a mission in life which I hold as sacred as my good friend Mr. Howells holds his. Such phases of life as I see I put down faithfully, and if the Fates in their wisdom have chosen to make of me the Balzac of the Supernatural, the Shakespeare of the Midnight Visitation, while elevating Mr. Howells to the high office of the Fielding of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6999"],["title","How to Live a Holy Life (#1)"],["body","of Love....................... 41  The Blessedness of Obeying God's Word......................... 43  The Relationship We Have with Christ through Obedience........ 45  Our Life is to Adorn the Gospel............................... 46  The Christian an Epistle of Christ............................ 48  How We may Live as the Bible Reads............................ 50  How to Keep the Word of God in the Heart...................... 52  Man the Vehicle for Exhibiting God's Perfections.............. 54  Some Use to Jesus (Poem)...................................... 63  Godly Living.................................................. 65  Something to Do............................................... 69  Spiritual Dryness............................................. 76  Prayer........................................................ 81  Keep the Roots Watered........................................ 85  Under the Fig-Tree............................................ 87  Shut the Door................................................. 91  Alone with God................................................ 93  Prayerful Remembrance (Poem).................................. 95  He Careth for Thee............................................ 96  \"Consider the Lilies\"........................................ 102  Sorrowful Yet always Rejoicing............................... 105  Gentleness................................................... 113  Tenderness................................................... 117  The Christian Walk........................................... 124  The Christian is to Walk Circumspectly....................... 125  The Latest Improved.......................................... 129  The Christian's Walk a Walk with God......................... 130  A Holy Life.................................................. 148  Lukewarmness................................................. 151  Steadfastness................................................ 156  How to Understand God's Will................................. 160  A View of Jesus.............................................. 164  Devotion to God.............................................. 166  The Golden Rule of Life...................................... 174  Timeliness in Doing Good..................................... 177  The Warfare of a Christian Life.............................. 181  Life by Faith................................................ 183  A Valuable Legacy............................................ 185  Some Scriptures for Daily Practise........................... 188     THE WAY THE SAIL IS SET.     I stood beside the open sea;    The ships went sailing by;   The wind blew softly o'er the lea;    The sun had cloudless sky.     Some ships sailed eastward, some sailed west,    Some north, some southward trend.   How can ships sail this way and that?    But one way blows the wind.    An old sea-captain made reply    (His locks with salt-spray wet):   \"'Tis not the wind decides the course;    'Tis way the sails are set.\"    *       *       *       *       *    I stand beside the sea of life;    The ships go sailing by;   The winds blow fair from heaven's land;    No clouds bedim the sky.    But one sails eastward, one sails west,    One north, one southward goes:   How can ships sail this way and that    With selfsame wind that blows?    A voice made answer to my soul:    \"'Tis not how blows the gale;   Each voyager decides the goal    By way he sets the sail.\"--Selected.     How to Live a Holy Life   THE MODEL LIFE.   In doing anything, it is always well to have a model by which to fashion our work. In fact, nothing is done without a pattern, either real or imaginary. The little boy making a toy has in in his mind a model by which he is framing his work. Likewise, the sculptor has in his mind a model, and as the \"marble wastes, the image grows\" into the likeness of the vision in his soul.  To live this one life of ours as it should be lived, we must have a perfect model after which to pattern. Thank God, this perfect model of life can be found. Of all the vast number of lives that have been lived since Adam down to this present day, there has been only one that we can take as a model. This one is the life of Jesus. He says, \"I am the life.\" To live this life of ours well, to live it to the highest degree of perfection, we must fashion it according to the glorious life of Christ. The life of Jesus is the model life for every other human life. He invites us, yea, commands us, to follow him, to step in his steps, to walk as he walked.  There have been many good men in the world, but none of them afford us a true pattern of life. There was a man who said, \"Be ye followers of me,\" but he immediately added, \"even as I also am of Christ.\" Man may so live as to reveal to us the life of Christ. We can then follow, not them, but the Christ-life they manifested through them.  Let me here say a word on a subject on which we may have more to say hereafter. The grandest, noblest work man has ever done is by his life to reveal the life of Christ to another, thereby helping that person to be fashioned more after the image of Jesus. A little flower grew in a place so shaded that no ray from the sun could fall directly upon it. A window was so situated that at a certain time in the afternoon it refracted the sun's rays and threw them upon the flower, thus giving it color and beauty, and aiding it to bloom. Some people are living in the dense shade. No light from Christ has ever shined upon them. If you so live as to refract the life of Christ and turn it upon them and thus stamp upon them a holier life, you have not lived in vain. To set the life of Christ in its purity and beauty before some one and influence him, though only a little, to live better and love Jesus more, is a work the worth of which can never be computed. He who helps another to a better way of living does more than he who gains great worldly honor and riches. Blessed indeed is that life which causes some other life to be more like Christ. Oh, may this thought seize upon our hearts and fill us with a greater passion to live the life of God.  We are told by the voice of Scripture to be \"followers of God as dear children.\" When children are dear to the heart of the parent, he loves to have them obey him. God's children are dear to him, and he would have them follow him. To follow God is to imitate him, or be like him. This is the true way of life.  A text of Scripture as rendered by the Revised Version is very appropriate here: \"Like as he which has called you is holy, be ye yourselves also holy in all manner of living.\" 1 Pet. 1:15. Only those who live godly in their entire manner of life are spending the days of their pilgrimage as they should. Jesus has walked the true way of life; we are told to walk in his steps. If we will step each day just where Jesus stepped, then on looking back, we can not see a footprint of our own; but if we take a single misstep, our footprint will show our departure from the true way of life. How deep and awful are the words of Scripture wherein we are commanded to walk even as \"Jesus walked\"! Jesus says, \"I am the way.\" There is no other right and perfect way. If we will walk as Jesus walked, then we shall walk in the true path of life. This only is the pathway that leads up to the golden gates of glory and the sweet fields of heaven. That bright world of bliss encourages us on. If we will follow Jesus and live as he lived, God's approval will be upon us, and his outstretched hand will help us along life's way and finally over the turbulent river of death to the sunlit shore of eternal rest.  Many times we may become wearied and think the toils of the way almost too heavy; but when we remember that it is the way that Jesus trod, then the heavens open to our view, we look forward to the mansion prepared for us, and the toils of the way grow lighter.  See that aged pilgrim journeying down the western slope of life. The sun is nearing the setting. Long and toilsome has been his pilgrimage, but he has walked in the path his Savior trod. For many years his life has been hid with Christ in God. In Him he has lived and moved and had his being. Now he is making his last step on the shore of time; he passes out of our sight through the gates into that land where toils are ended and the sun never sets. But his life was the life of Jesus. He was holy as God is holy; he walked as Jesus walked. This is how to live. This is the true way of life and the only way to life eternal. He who does not live with Christ on earth can not live with him in heaven, and he who does not live as Jesus lived does not live as he should. The life of Christ was the perfect life. Ours is perfect to the degree that we imitate him.    Take my life, O Christ divine,   Make it holy, just like thine;   Every act and thought and word   Be an outflow from my God.    Guide my feet and keep my heart;   Let me not from thee depart;   Let me breathe thy warming love,   That my soul be drawn above.    Draw me, Jesus, closer draw;   Thy strong arm around me throw;   Draw me to thy pierced side;   In thy bosom let me hide.    Teach me all thy will and word,   That my life be filled with God;   Teach me, Lamb of Calvary,   How to live this life for thee.     HOW TO LIVE THE CHRIST-LIFE.   Man can not naturally live the Christ-life. But Christ has promised to come into our hearts and live in us. In order that we may have Christ dwell in our hearts and that we may live his life, there must be a giving up of our self-life. There must be annihilation of self that Christ may live. It is truly wonderful and as glorious as it is wonderful that man can live the life of Christ in this world. But here is the secret: it is man ceasing to live the self-life and Christ living in him.  Imagine a hollow brass figure in the exact image of a man. Suppose you fill this hollow figure with a kind of life which we shall call self-l"]]]
