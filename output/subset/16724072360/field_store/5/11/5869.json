What could have happened since then?  'But I can't help it,' continued Mr Jackson.  'Aren't I going up to Cambridge, father?' stammered Mike.  'I'm afraid not, Mike. I'd manage it if I possibly could. I'm just as anxious to see you get your Blue as you are to get it. But it's kinder to be quite frank. I can't afford to send you to Cambridge. I won't go into details which you would not understand; but I've lost a very large sum of money since I saw you last. So large that we shall have to economize in every way. I shall let this house and take a much smaller one. And you and Bob, I'm afraid, will have to start earning your living. I know it's a terrible disappointment to you, old chap.'  'Oh, that's all right,' said Mike thickly. There seemed to be something sticking in his throat, preventing him from speaking.  'If there was any possible way--'  'No, it's all right, father, really. I don't mind a bit. It's awfully rough luck on you losing all that.'  There was another silence. The clock ticked away energetically on the mantelpiece, as if glad to make itself heard at last. Outside, a plaintive snuffle made itself heard. John, the bull-dog, Mike's inseparable companion, who had followed him to the study, was getting tired of waiting on the mat. Mike got up and opened the door. John lumbered in.  The movement broke the tension.  'Thanks, Mike,' said Mr Jackson, as Mike started to leave the room, 'you're a sportsman.'     3. The New Era Begins   Details of what were in store for him were given to Mike next morning. During his absence at Ilsworth a vacancy had been got for him in that flourishing institution, the New Asiatic Bank; and he was to enter upon his duties, whatever they might be, on the Tuesday of the following week. It was short notice, but banks have a habit of swallowing their victims rather abruptly. Mike remembered the case of Wyatt, who had had just about the same amount of time in which to get used to the prospect of Commerce.  On the Monday morning a letter arrived from Psmith. Psmith was still perturbed. 'Commerce,' he wrote, 'continues to boom. My pater referred to Comrade Bickersdyke last night as a Merchant Prince. Comrade B. and I do not get on well together. Purely for his own good, I drew him aside yesterday and explained to him at great length the frightfulness of walking across the bowling-screen. He seemed restive, but I was firm. We parted rather with the Distant Stare than the Friendly Smile. But I shall persevere. In many ways the casual observer would say that he was hopeless. He is a poor performer at Bridge, as I was compelled to hint to him on Saturday night. His eyes have no animated sparkle of intelligence. And the cut of his clothes jars my sensitive soul to its foundations. I don't wish to speak ill of a man behind his back, but I must confide in you, as my Boyhood's Friend, that he wore a made-up tie at dinner. But no more of a painful subject. I am working away at him with a brave smile. Sometimes I think that I am succeeding. Then he seems to slip back again. However,' concluded the letter, ending on an optimistic note, 'I think that I shall make a man of him yet--some day.'  Mike re-read this letter in the train that took him to London. By this time Psmith would know that his was not the only case in which Commerce was booming. Mike had written to him by return, telling him of the disaster which had befallen the house of Jackson. Mike wished he could have told him in person, for Psmith had a way of treating unpleasant situations as if he were merely playing at them for his own amusement. Psmith's attitude towards the slings and arrows of outrageous Fortune was to regard them with a bland smile, as if they were part of an entertainment got up for his express benefit.  Arriving at Paddington, Mike stood on the platform, waiting for his box to emerge from the luggage-van, with mixed feelings of gloom and excitement. The gloom was in the larger quantities, perhaps, but the excitement was there, too. It was the first time in his life that he had been entirely dependent on himself. He had crossed the Rubicon. The occasion was too serious for him to feel the same helplessly furious feeling with which he had embarked on life at Sedleigh. It was possible to look on Sedleigh with quite a personal enmity. London was too big to be angry with. It took no notice of him. It did not care whether he was glad to be there or sorry, and there was no means of making it care. That is the peculiarity of London. There is a sort of cold unfriendliness about it. A city like New York makes the new arrival feel at home in half an hour; but London is a specialist in what Psmith in his letter had called the Distant Stare. You have to buy London's good-will.  Mike drove across the Park to Victoria, feeling very empty and small. He had settled on Dulwich as the spot to get lodgings, partly because, knowing nothing about London, he was under the impression that rooms anywhere inside the four-mile radius were very expensive, but principally because there was a school at Dulwich, and it would be a comfort being near a school. He might get a game of fives there sometimes, he thought, on a Saturday afternoon, and, in the summer, occasional cricket.  Wandering at a venture up the asphalt passage which leads from Dulwich station in the direction of the College, he came out into Acacia Road. There is something about Acacia Road which inevitably suggests furnished apartments. A child could tell at a glance that it was bristling with bed-sitting rooms.  Mike knocked at the first door over which a card hung.  There is probably no more depressing experience in the world than the process of engaging furnished apartments. Those who let furnished apartments seem to take no joy in the act. Like Pooh-Bah, they do it, but it revolts them.  In answer to Mike's knock, a female person opened the door. In appearance she resembled a pantomime 'dame', inclining towards the restrained melancholy of Mr Wilkie Bard rather than the joyous abandon of Mr George Robey. Her voice she had modelled on the gramophone. Her most recent occupation seemed to have been something with a good deal of yellow soap in it. As a matter of fact--there are no secrets between our readers and ourselves--she had been washing a shirt. A useful occupation, and an honourable, but one that tends to produce a certain homeliness in the appearance.  She wiped a pair of steaming hands on her apron, and regarded Mike with an eye which would have been markedly expressionless in a boiled fish.  'Was there anything?' she asked.  Mike felt that he was in for it now. He had not sufficient ease of manner to back gracefully away and disappear, so he said that there was something. In point of fact, he wanted a bed-sitting room.  'Orkup stays,' said the pantomime dame. Which Mike interpreted to mean, would he walk upstairs?  The procession moved up a dark flight of stairs until it came to a door. The pantomime dame opened this, and shuffled through. Mike stood in the doorway, and looked in.  It was a repulsive room. One of those characterless rooms which are only found in furnished apartments. To Mike, used to the comforts of his bedroom at home and the cheerful simplicity of a school dormitory, it seemed about the most dismal spot he had ever struck. A sort of Sargasso Sea among bedrooms.  He looked round in silence. Then he said: 'Yes.' There did not seem much else to say.  'It's a nice room,' said the pantomime dame. Which was a black lie. It was not a nice room. It never had been a nice room. And it did not seem at all probable that it ever would be a nice room. But it looked cheap. That was the great thing. Nobody could have the assurance to charge much for a room like that. A landlady with a conscience might even have gone to the length of paying people some small sum by way of compensation to them for sleeping in it.  'About what?' queried Mike. Cheapness was the great consideration. He understood that his salary at the bank would be about four pounds ten a month, to begin with, and his father was allowing him five pounds a month. One does not do things _en prince_ on a hundred and fourteen pounds a year.  The pantomime dame became slightly more animated. Prefacing her remarks by a repetition of her statement that it was a nice room, she went on to say that she could 'do' it at seven and sixpence per week 'for him'--giving him to understand, presumably, that, if the Shah of Persia or Mr Carnegie ever applied for a night's rest, they would sigh in vain for such easy terms. And that included lights. Coals were to be looked on as an extra. 'Sixpence a scuttle.' Attendance was thrown in.  Having stated these terms, she dribbled a piece of fluff under the bed, after the manner of a professional Association footballer, and relapsed into her former moody silence.  Mike said he thought that would be all right. The pantomime dame exhibited no pleasure.  ''Bout meals?' she said. 'You'll be wanting breakfast. Bacon, aigs, an' that, I suppose?'  Mike said he supposed so.  'That'll be extra,' she said. 'And dinner? A chop, or a nice steak?'  Mike bowed before this original flight of fancy. A chop or a nice steak seemed to be about what he might want.  'That'll be extra,' said the pantomime dame in her best Wilkie Bard manner.  Mike said yes, he supposed so. After which, having put down seven and sixpence, one week's rent in advance, he was presented with a grubby receipt and an enormous latchkey, and the _seance_ was at an end. Mike wandered out of the house. A few steps took him to the railings that bounded the College grounds. It was late August, and the evenings had begun to close in. The cricket-field looked very cool and spacious in the dim light, with the school buildings looming vague and shadowy through the slight mist. The little gate by the railway bridge was not locked."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6754"],["title","The Tale of Brownie Beaver (#1)"],["body"," where to work on it. Of course, that's all right if you're willing to work for the whole village. But I say, let others do the work! As for me, I've never put a single stick nor a single armful of mud on that dam; and what's more, I never intend to, either.  \"My tunnel in the bank suits me very well. Of course, it may not be so airy in summer as a house such as you're making for yourself. But I don't live in my house in summer. So what's the difference to me? In summer I go up the stream, or down--just as it suits me--and I see something of the world and have a fine time. There's nothing like travel, you know, to broaden one,\" said Tired Tim.  Brownie Beaver stopped just a moment and looked at the lazy fellow. He was certainly broad enough, Brownie thought. He was so fat that his sides stuck far out. But it was no wonder--for he never did any work.  \"You'd better take my advice,\" Tired Tim told Brownie.  But Brownie Beaver had returned to his wood-cutting. He didn't even stop to answer. To him, working was just fun. And building a fine house was as good as any game.     IV  THE FRESHET   The rain had fallen steadily for two days and two nights-not just a gentle drizzle, but a heavy downpour.  For some time it did not in the least disturb Brownie Beaver and his neighbors--that is to say, all but one of them. For there was a very old gentleman in the village known as Grandaddy Beaver who began to worry almost as soon as it began to rain.  \"We're a-going to have a freshet,\" he said to everybody he met. \"I've seen 'em start many a time and I can always tell a freshet almost as soon as I see it coming.\"  Grandaddy Beaver's friends paid no heed to his warning. And some of them were so unkind as to laugh when the old gentleman crawled on top of his house and began to mend it.  \"You young folks can poke fun at me if you want to,\" said Grandaddy Beaver, \"but I'm a-going right ahead and make my house as strong as I can. For when the freshet gets here I don't want my home washed away.\"  All day long people would stop to watch the old fellow at work upon his roof. And everybody thought it was a great joke--until the second day came and everybody noticed that it was raining just as hard as ever.  But no one except Grandaddy Beaver had ever heard of a freshet at that time of year. So even then nobody else went to work on his house, though some people _did_ stop smiling. A freshet, you know, is a serious thing.  As the second day passed, the rain seemed to fall harder. And still Grandaddy Beaver kept putting new sticks on the roof of his house and plastering mud over them. And at last Brownie Beaver began to think that perhaps the old gentleman was right, after all, and that maybe everybody else was wrong.  So Brownie went home and set to work. And all his neighbors at once began to smile at him.  But Brownie Beaver didn't mind that.  \"My roof needed mending, anyhow,\" he said. \"And if we _should_ have a freshet. I'll be ready for it. And if we don't have one, there'll be no harm done.\"  [Illustration: Mr. Crow Called Down the Chimney]  Now, all this time the water had been rising slowly. But that was no more than everyone expected, since it was raining so hard. But when the second night came, the water began to rise very fast. It rose so quickly that several families found their bedroom floors under water almost before they knew it.  Then old Grandaddy Beaver went through the village and stopped at every door.  \"What do you think about it now?\" he asked. \"Is it a freshet or isn't it?\"  In the houses where the water had climbed above the bedroom floors the people all agreed that it was a freshet and that Grandaddy Beaver had been right all the time. But there were still plenty of people who thought the old gentleman was mistaken.  \"The water won't come any higher,\" they said. \"It never has, at this time of year.\" But they looked a bit worried, in spite of what they said.  \"It's a-going to be the worst freshet that's happened since you were born,\" their caller croaked. \"You mark my words!\"  When he came to Brownie Beaver's house Grandaddy found that there was one person, at least, that had taken his advice.  \"I see you're all ready for the freshet!\" the old gentleman remarked. \"They laughed at me; but I was right,\" he said.  \"They laughed at me, too,\" Brownie Beaver told him.  \"There's nobody in this village that'll laugh again tonight,\" Grandaddy said very solemnly, \"for there's a-going to be a flood before morning.\"     V  BROWNIE SAVES THE DAM   Brownie Beaver was always glad that he had taken Grandaddy's advice about the freshet. And Brownie's neighbors were glad that he had, too. For that was really the only thing that saved the village from being carried away by the flood of water that swept down upon the pond, after it had rained for two days and two nights.  The pond rose so quickly and the water rushed past so fast that people had to scramble out of their houses and begin working on them, to keep them from being washed away.  That rush of water meant only one thing. The pond was full and running over! And just as likely as not the dam would be carried away--the dam on which Grandaddy Beaver had worked when he was a youngster, and on which his own grandaddy had worked before him. It would take years and years to build another such dam as that.  Now, with almost everybody working on his own house, there was almost no one left to work upon the dam. But people never stopped to think about that. They never once remembered that out of the whole village old Grandaddy and Brownie Beaver were the only persons whose houses had been made ready for the freshet and that those two were the only people with nothing to do at home.  \"There'll be plenty to help save the dam,\" everybody said to himself. \"I'll just work on my house.\"  Now, Brownie Beaver knew that there was nothing more he could do to make his house safe, so he swam over to the dam, expecting to find a good many of his neighbors there. But old Grandaddy Beaver was the only other person he found. And he seemed worried.  \"It's a great pity!\" he said to Brownie. \"Here's this fine dam, which has taken so many years to build, and it's a-going to be washed away--you mark my words!\"  \"What makes you think that?\" asked Brownie.  \"There's nobody here to do anything,\" said Grandaddy Beaver. \"The spillways of this dam ought to be made as big as possible, to let the freshet pass through. But I can't do it, for I can't swim as well as I could once.\"  Brownie Beaver looked at the rushing water which poured over the top of the dam in a hundred places and was already carrying off mud and sticks, eating the dam away before his very eyes.  \"I'll save the dam!\" he cried. \"You?\" Grandaddy Beaver exclaimed. \"Why, what do you think you can do?\" Being so old, he couldn't help believing that other people were too young to do difficult things.  \"Watch me and I'll show you!\" Brownie Beaver told him. And without saying another word he swam to the nearest spillway and began making it bigger.  Sometimes he had to fight the freshet madly, to keep from being swept over the dam himself. Sometimes, too, as he stood on the dam it crumbled beneath him and he found himself swimming again.  How many narrow escapes he had that day Brownie Beaver could never remember. When they happened, he didn't have time to count them, he was working so busily. And if old Grandaddy Beaver hadn't told everyone afterward, how Brownie saved the great dam from being swept away, and how hard he had worked, and how he had swum fearlessly into the torrent, people wouldn't have known anything about it.  To be sure, they had noticed that the water went down almost as suddenly as it rose. But they hadn't stopped to think that there must have been some reason for that. And when they learned that Brownie Beaver was the reason, the whole village gave him a vote of thanks.  They wanted to give him a gold-headed cane, too. But they were unable to find one anywhere.  When Brownie Beaver heard of that he said it was just as well, because he seldom walked far on land and there wasn't much use in a person's carrying a cane when he swam, anyhow. Although it was sometimes done, he had always considered it a silly practice--and one that he would not care to follow.     VI  A HAPPY THOUGHT   Brownie Beaver liked to know what was going on in the world. But living far from Pleasant Valley as he did, he seldom heard any news before it was quite old.  \"I wish--\" he said to Mr. Crow one day, when that old gentleman was making him a visit--\"I wish someone would start a newspaper in this neighborhood.\"  Mr. Crow told Brownie that he would be glad to bring him an old newspaper whenever he happened to find one. \"Thank you!\" Brownie Beaver said. \"You're very kind. But an old newspaper would be of no use to me.\"  \"Why not?\" Mr. Crow inquired. \"They make very good beds, I've been told. And I suppose that is what you want one for.\"  \"Not at all!\" Brownie replied. \"I'd like to know what's happening over in Pleasant Valley. It takes so long for news to reach us here in our pond that it's often hardly worth listening to when we hear it--it's so old. Now, what I'd really prefer is a newspaper that would tell me everything that's going to happen a week later.\"  Mr. Crow said he never heard of a newspaper like that.  \"Well, somebody ought to start one,\" Brownie Beaver answered.  Mr. Crow thought deeply for some minutes without saying a word. And at last He cried suddenly:  \"I have an idea!\"  \"Have you?\" Brownie Beaver exclaimed. \"What is it, Mr. Crow?\"  \"I'll be your newspaper!\" Mr. Crow told him.  At that Brownie Beaver looked somewhat doubtful.  \"That's very kind of you,\" he said. \"But I'm afraid it wouldn't do me much good. You're so black that the ink wouldn't show on you at all---unless,\" he added, \"they use _white_ ink to print on you.\"  \"You don't understand,\" old Mr. Crow said. \"What I mean is this: I'll fly over here once a week and tell you everything "]]]
