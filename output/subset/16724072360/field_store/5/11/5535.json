Not that he would have cherished any fears of the fidelity of the wife whom he honoured as the purest and noblest of her sex, and of whom he spoke to the knight with reverence and love; he desired only to guard her from any occurrence that might offend her.  Wolf listened in surprise.  He had firmly resolved that on no account would he stay in Ratisbon.  What could he find save fresh anxiety and never-ending anguish of the heart if he remained near Barbara, who disdained his love?  He possessed little ambition.  It was only for the sake of the woman he loved that he had recently made more active exertions, but with his excellent acquirements and the fair prospects which were open to him at the court, it seemed, even to his modest mind, too humble a fate to bury himself in a Spanish castle in order to while away with music the lonely hours of a noblewoman, no matter how high her rank, how beautiful and estimable she might be, or how gladly he would render her admirable husband a favour.  Quijada had said this to himself, and perceived plainly enough what was passing in the young knight's thoughts.  So he frankly confessed that he was well aware how few temptations his invitation offered a man endowed with Wolf's rare advantages, but he came by no means with empty hands--and he now informed the listening musician what he could offer him.  This certainly gave his proposal a different aspect.  The aristocratic Quijada family--and as its head he himself--had in its gift a rich living, which annually yielded thousands of ducats, in the great capital of Valladolid.  Many a son of a distinguished race sought it, but he wished to bestow it upon Wolf.  It would insure him more than a comfortable support, permit him to marry the woman of his choice, and, if he remained several years in Villagarcia, afford him the possibility of accumulating a neat little property, as he would live in Quijada's castle as a welcome guest and scarcely ever be obliged to open his purse strings.  Besides, music was cultivated in Valladolid, and if Don Luis introduced him to the clergy there, it might easily happen that they would avail themselves of his great knowledge and fine ability and intrust to him the amendment and perhaps, finally, the direction of the church music.  As Dona Magdalena often spent several months with her brother, the Marquis Rodrigo de la Mota, Wolf could from time to time be permitted to visit the Netherlands or Italy to participate in the more active musical life of these countries.  Wolf listened to this explanation with increasing attention.  The narrow path which buried itself in the sand was becoming a thoroughfare leading upward.  He was glad that he had withheld his refusal; but this matter was so important that the prudent young man, after warmly thanking Don Luis for his good opinion, requested some time for consideration.  True, Quijada could assure him that, for the sake of his wife, Dona Magdalena de Ulloa, whom from childhood she had honoured with her special favour, the regent would place no obstacle in the way of his retirement from her service.  But Wolf begged him to have patience with him.  He was not a man to make swift decisions, and nowhere could he reflect better than in the saddle during a long ride.  He would inform him of his determination by the first messenger despatched from Brussels to the Emperor.  Even now he could assure him that this generous offer seemed very tempting, since solitude always had far more charm for him than the noisy bustle of the court.  Quijada willingly granted the requested delay, and, before bidding him farewell, Wolf availed himself of the opportunity to deliver into his hands the papers collected by his adopted father, which he had on his person.  They contained the proof that he was descended from the legal marriage of a knight and a baroness; and Don Luis willingly undertook to have them confirmed by the Emperor, and his patent renewed in a way which, if he accepted his proposal, might also be useful to him in Spain.  So Wolf took leave of the major-domo with the conviction that he possessed a true friend in this distinguished man.  If the regent did not arbitrarily detain him, he would show himself in Villagarcia to be worthy of his confidence.  On the stairs he met the Emperor's confessor, Don Pedro de Soto. Wolf bowed reverently before the dignified figure of the distinguished Dominican, and the latter, as he recognised him, paused to request curtly that he would give him a few minutes the following day.  \"If I can be of any service to your Reverence,\" replied Wolf, taking the prelate's delicate hand to kiss it; but the almoner, with visible coldness, withdrew it, repellently interrupting him: \"First, Sir Knight, I must ask you for an explanation.  Where the plague is raging in every street, we ought to guard our own houses carefully against it.\"  \"Undoubtedly,\" replied Wolf, unsuspiciously.  \"But I shall set out early to-morrow morning with her Majesty.\"  \"Then,\" replied the Dominican after a brief hesitation, \"then a word with you now.\"  He continued his way to the second story, and Wolf, with an anxious mind, followed him into a waiting room, now empty, near the staircase.  The deep seriousness in the keen eyes of the learned confessor, which could look gentle, indulgent, and sometimes even merry, revealed that he desired to discuss some matter of importance; but the very first question which the priest addressed to him restored the young man's composure.  The confessor merely desired to know what took him to the house of the man who must be known to him as the soul of the evangelical innovations in his native city, and the friend of Martin Luther.  Wolf now quietly informed him what offer Dr. Hiltner, as syndic of Ratisbon, had made him in the name of the Council.  \"And you?\" asked the confessor anxiously.  \"I declined it most positively,\" replied Wolf, \"although it would have suited my taste to stand at the head of the musical life in my native city.\"  \"Because you prefer to remain in the service of her Majesty Queen Mary?\" asked De Soto.  \"No, your Eminence.  Probably I shall soon leave the position near her person.  I rather feared that, as a good Catholic, I would find it difficult to do my duty in the service of an evangelical employer.\"  \"There is something in that.  But what led the singer--you know whom I mean--to the same house?\"  Wolf could not restrain a slight smile, and he answered eagerly: \"The young lady and I grew up together under the same roof, your Eminence, and she came for no other purpose than to bid me farewell.  A lamb that clings more firmly to the shepherd, and more strongly abhors heresy, could scarcely be found in our Redeemer's flock.\"  \"A  lamb!\" exclaimed the  almoner with  a slight touch of scorn.  \"What are we to think of the foe of heresy who exchanges tender kisses with the wife of the most energetic leader of Protestantism?\"  \"By your permission, your Eminence,\" Wolf asserted, \"only the daughter offered her her lips.  She and her mother made the singer's acquaintance at the musical exercises established here by the Council.  Music is the only bond between them.\"--\"Yet there is a bond,\" cried De Soto suspiciously.  \"If you see her again before your departure, advise her, in my name, to sever it.  She found a friendly welcome and much kindness in that house, and here at least--tell her so--only one faith exists.  A prosperous journey, Sir Knight.\"  The delay caused by this conversation induced Wolf to quicken his pace. It had grown late, and Erasmus Eckhart had surely been waiting some time for his school friend in the old precentor's house.  This was really the case, but the Wittenberg theologian, whose course of study had ended only a fortnight before, and who, with his long, brown locks and bright blue eyes, still looked like a gay young student, had had no reason to lament the delay.  He was first received by Ursel, who had left her bed and was moving slowly about the room, and how much the old woman had had to tell her young fellow-believer from Wittenberg about Martin Luther, who was now no longer living, and Professor Melanchthon; but Erasmus Eckhart liked to talk with her, for as a schoolmate and intimate friend of Wolf he had paid innumerable visits to the house, and received in winter an apple, in summer a handful of cherries, from her.  The young man was still less disposed to be vexed with Wolf for his delay when Barbara appeared in Ursel's room.  Erasmus had played with her, too, when he was a boy, and they shared a treasure of memories of the fairest portion of life.  When Wolf at last returned and Barbara gave him her hand, Erasmus envied him the affectionate confidence with which it was done.  She was charged with the warmest messages from her father to the knight, and conscientiously delivered them.  The old gentleman's companion had advised starting that evening, because experience taught that, on a long ride, it was better for man and beast to spend the night outside the city.  They were to put up at the excellent tavern in Winzer, an hour's journey from Ratisbon, and continue the ride from that point.  Wolf knew that many couriers did the same thing, in order to avoid delay at the gate, and only asked whom her father had chosen for a companion.  \"A young nobleman who was here as a recruiting officer,\" replied Barbara curtly.  She had not heard until the last moment whom her father had selected, and had only seen Pyramus Kogel again while the captain's groom was buckling his knapsack upon the saddle.  He had ridden to the house, and while she gazed past him, as though an invisible cap concealed him from her eyes, he asked whether she had no wish concerning her father at heart.  \"That some one else was to accompany him,\" came her sharp reply.  Then, before the captain put his foot into the stirrup, she threw her arms around "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5565"],["title","Barbara Blomberg â€” Volume 05 (#2)"],["body","old man's neck, kissed him tenderly, and uttered loving wishes for him to take with him on his way.  Her father, deeply moved, at last swung himself into the saddle, commending her to the protection of the gracious Virgin.  It was not wholly easy for him to part with her, but the prospect of riding out into the world with a full purse, highly honoured by his imperial master, gratified the old adventure-loving heart so much that he could feel no genuine sympathy.  Too honest to feign an emotion which he did not experience, he behaved accordingly; and, besides, he was sure of leaving his child in the best care as in her earlier years, when, glad to leave the dull city, business, and his arrogant, never-satisfied wife behind, he had gone with a light heart to war.  While pressing the horse's flanks between his legs and forcing the spirited animal, which went round and round with him in a circle, to obedience, he waved his new travelling hat; but Barbara, meanwhile, was thinking that he could only leave her with his mind thus free from care because she was deceiving him, and, as her eyes rested on her father's wounded limb projecting stiffly into the air, bitter grief overwhelmed her.  How often the old wounds caused him pain!  Other little infirmities, too, tortured him.  Who would bind them up on the journey?  who would give him the medicine which afforded relief?  Then pity affected her more deeply than ever before, and it was with difficulty that she forced back the rising tears.  Her father might perhaps have noticed them, for one groom carried a torch, and the one- eyed maid's lantern was shining directly into her face.  But while she was struggling not to weep aloud, emotion and anxiety for the old man who, through her fault, would be exposed to so much danger, extorted the cry: \"Take care of him, Herr Pyramus!  I will be grateful to you.\"  \"That shall be a promise, lovely, ungracious maiden,\" the recruiting officer quickly answered.  But the old man was already waving his hat again, his horse dashed upon the Haidplatz at a gallop, and his companion, with gallant bearing, followed.  Barbara had then gone back into the house, and the maid-servant lighted her upstairs.  It had become perfectly dark in her rooms, and the solitude and silence there oppressed her like a hundredweight burden.  Besides, terrible thoughts had assailed her, showing her herself in want and shame, despised, disdained, begging for a morsel of bread, and her father under his fallen horse, on his lonely, couch of pain, in his coffin.  Then her stay in her lonely rooms seemed unendurable.  She would have lost her reason ere Quijada came at midnight to conduct her for a short time to the Golden Cross.  She could not remain long with her lover, because the servants were obliged to be up early in the morning on account of the regent's departure.  With Ursel she would be protected from the terrors of solitude, for, besides the old woman's voice, a man's tones also reached her through the open window.  It was probably the companion of her childhood.  In his society she would most speedily regain her lost peace of mind.  In his place she had at first found only Erasmus Eckhart.  The strong, bold boy had become a fine-looking man.  A certain gravity of demeanour had early taken possession of him, and while his close-shut lips showed his ability to cling tenaciously to a resolution, his bright eyes sparkled with the glow of enthusiasm.  Barbara could believe in this young man's capacity for earnest, lofty aspiration, and for that very reason it had aroused special displeasure in her mind when he gaily recalled the foolish pranks, far better suited to a boy, into which as a child she had often allowed herself to be hurried.  She felt as if, in doing so, he was showing her a lack of respect which he would scarcely have ventured toward a young lady whom he esteemed, and the petted singer, whom no less a personage than the Emperor Charles deemed worthy of his love, was unwilling to tolerate such levity from so young a man.  She made no claim to reverence, but she expected admiration and the recognition of being an unusual person, who was great in her own way.  For the sake of the monarch who raised her to his side, she owed it to herself to show, even in her outward bearing, that she did not stand too far below him in aristocratic dignity.  She succeeded in this admirably during the conversation on music and singing which she carried on with Erasmus.  When she at last desired to return home, Wolf accompanied her up the stairs, informed her of his conversation with the confessor, and at the same time warned her against incautious visits to the Hiltners so long as the Emperor held his court in Ratisbon.  To have fallen under suspicion of heresy would have been the last thing Barbara expected, and she called it foolish, nay, ridiculous.  But, ere she clasped Wolf's hand in farewell, she promised to show the almoner at the first opportunity upon how false a trail he had come.     CHAPTER XXII.  When Wolf went back to Erasmus the latter assured his friend that he had met no maiden in Ratisbon who, to rare gifts, united the dignity which he had hitherto admired only in the ladies whom he had met at the court of the Elector of Saxony.  His sparkling eyes flashed more brightly as he spoke, and, like a blushing girl, he confessed to his friend that Jungfrau Blomberg's promise to sing one of his own compositions to him made him a happy man.  Barbara's conduct had made the repressed fire of love blaze up anew in Wolf.  Now, for the first time, the woman he loved fully and entirely fulfilled the ideal which he had formed of the \"queen\" of his heart.  Was it the sad separation from him, the taking leave of her father, or her new love, which was bestowed on a man whom he also esteemed, that impressed upon her nature the stamp of a nobility which beseemed her as well as it suited her aristocratic beauty?  Never had it appeared to him so utterly impossible that he could yield her to another without resistance.  Perhaps the man chosen by such a jewel was more worthy than he, but no one's love could surpass his in strength and fervour.  She had tested it, and he need no longer call himself an insignificant suitor; for, if he gained possession of the living which Don Luis had ready for him, if he obtained a high position in Valladolid--But his friend gave him no time to pursue such thoughts further, for, while Barbara shortly after midnight stole down the stairs like a criminal, and Quijada conducted her to her imperial lover, Erasmus began to press him with demands which he was obliged to reject.  The Wittenberg master of arts, ever since his first meeting with his friend, had been on the point of asking the question how he, who had obtained in the school of poets an insight into the pure word of God, could prevail upon himself to continue to wear the chains of Rome and remain a Catholic.  Wolf had expected this query, and, while he filled his companion's goblet with the good Wurzburg wine which Ursula provided, he begged him not to bring religion into their conversation.  The young Wittenberg theologian, however, had come for the express purpose of discussing it with his friend.  Religion, he asserted in the fervid manner characteristic of him, was in these times the axis around which turned the inner life of the world and every individual.  He himself had resolved to live for the object for whose sake it was worth while to die.  He knew the great perils which would be associated with it for one of his warlike temperament, but he had become, by the divine summons, an evangelical theologian, a combatant for the liberation of the slaves sighing under the tyranny of Rome.  A serious conversation with a friend who was a German and resisted yielding to a movement of the spirit which was kindling the inmost depths of the German nature, thoughts, and feelings, and was destined to heal the woes of the German nation and preserve it from the basest abuse, would be to him inconceivable.  Wolf interrupted this avowal with the assurance that he must nevertheless decline a religious discussion with him, for the weapons they would use were too different.  Erasmus, as a theologian, was deeply versed in the Protestant faith, while he professed Catholicism merely as a consequence of his birth and with a layman's understanding and knowledge.  Yet he would not shun the conflict if his hands were not bound by the most sacred of oaths.  Then he turned to the past, and while he himself, as it were, lived through for the second time the most affecting moment in his existence, he transported his friend to his dead mother's sick-bed.  In vivid language he described how the devout widow and nun implored her son to resist like a rock in the sea the assault of the new heretical ideas, that the thousands of prayers which she had uttered for him, for his soul, and his father's, might not be vain.  Then Wolf confessed that just at that time, as a pupil in the school of poets, he had come under the influence of the scholar Naevius, whose evangelical views Erasmus knew, and related how difficult it had been for him to take the oath which, nevertheless, now that he had once sworn it, he would keep, even though life and his own intelligence would not have taught him to prefer the old faith to every new doctrine, whether it emanated from Luther, from Calvin, or from Zwingli.  For a short time Erasmus found no answer to this statement, and Wolf's old nurse, who herself clung to the Protestants from complete conviction, and had listened attentively to his words, urged her young co-religionist, by all sorts of signs, to respect his friend's decision.  The confession of his schoolmate had not been entirely without effect upon the young theologian.  The name of \"mother\" also filled him with reverence.  True, his birth had cost his own mother her life, but he had long possessed a distinct idea of her"]]]
