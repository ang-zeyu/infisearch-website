Woodward, sneeringly asked: \"Whence came these excessive      sensibilities that cannot bear a few slaves in a remote Territory      until the white people establish a Constitution?\"  Another, Mr.      Charles E. Lex (a Republican), speaking of the Southern People,      said: \"What, then, can we say to them? what more than we have      expressed in the resolutions we have offered?  If they are really      aggrieved by any laws upon our Statute-books opposed to their      rights--if upon examination any such are found to be in conflict      with the Constitution of these United States--nay, further, if they      but serve to irritate our brethren of the South, whether      Constitutional or not, I, for one, have no objection that they      should instantly be repealed.\"  Another said, \"Let us repeal our      obnoxious Personal Liberty bills * * *; let us receive our brother      of the South, if he will come among us for a little time, attended      by his servant, and permit him thus to come.\"  And the resolutions      adopted were even still more abject in tone than the speeches.]  But the South at present was too busy in perfecting its long-cherished plans for the disruption of the Union, to more than grimly smile at this evidence of what it chose to consider \"a divided sentiment\" in the North.  While it weakened the North, it strengthened the South, and instead of mollifying the Conspirators against the Union, it inspired them with fresh energy in their fell purpose to destroy it.  The tone of the Republican press, too, while more dignified, was thoroughly conciliatory.  The Albany Evening Journal,--[November 30, 1860]--the organ of Governor Seward, recognizing that the South, blinded by passion, was in dead earnest, but also recognizing the existence of \"a Union sentiment there, worth cherishing,\" suggested \"a Convention of the People, consisting of delegates appointed by the States, in which it would not be found unprofitable for the North and South, bringing their respective griefs, claims, and proposed reforms, to a common arbitrament, to meet, discuss, and determine upon a future\"--before a final appeal to arms.  So, too, Horace Greeley, in the New York Tribune,--[November 9, 1860.]--after weakly conceding, on his own part, the right of peaceable Secession, said: \"But while we thus uphold the practical liberty, if not the abstract right, of Secession, we must insist that the step be taken, if it ever shall be, with the deliberation and gravity befitting so momentous an issue.  Let ample time be given for reflection; let the subject be fully canvassed before the People; and let a popular vote be taken in every case, before Secession is decreed.\"  Other leading papers of the Northern press, took similar ground for free discussion and conciliatory action.  In the Senate, as well as the House of Representatives--as also was shown by the appointment, heretofore mentioned, of Select Committees to consider the gravity of the situation, and suggest a remedy--the same spirit of Conciliation and Concession, and desire for free and frank discussion, was apparent among most of the Northern and Border-State members of those Bodies.  But these were only met by sneers and threats on the part of the Fire-eating Secession members of the South.  In the Senate, Senator Clingman of North Carolina, sneeringly said: \"They want to get up a free debate, as the Senator (Mr. Seward) from New York expressed it, in one of his speeches.  But a Senator from Texas told me the other day that a great many of these free debaters were hanging from the trees of that country;\" and Senator Iverson, of Georgia, said: \"Gentlemen speak of Concession, of the repeal of the Personal Liberty bills.  Repeal them all to-morrow, and you cannot stop this revolution.\" After declaring his belief that \"Before the 4th of March, five States will have declared their independence\" and that \"three other States will follow as soon as the action of the people can be had;\" he proceeded to allude to the refusal of Governor Houston of Texas to call together the Texas Legislature for action in accord with the Secession sentiment, and declared that \"if he will not yield to that public sentiment, some Texan Brutus will arise to rid his country of this hoary-headed incubus that stands between the people and their sovereign will!\"  Then, sneering at the presumed cowardice of the North, he continued: \"Men talk about their eighteen millions (of Northern population); but we hear a few days afterwards of these same men being switched in the face, and they tremble like sheep-stealing dogs!  There will be no War.  The North, governed by such far-seeing Statesmen as the Senator (Mr. Seward) from New York, will see the futility of this.  In less than twelve months, a Southern Confederacy will be formed; and it will be the most successful Government on Earth.  The Southern States, thus banded together, will be able to resist any force in the World.  We do not expect War; but we will be prepared for it--and we are not a feeble race of Mexicans either.\"  On the other hand, there were Republicans in that Body who sturdily met the bluster of the Southern Fire-eaters with frank and courageous words expressing their full convictions on the situation and their belief that Concessions could not be made and that Compromises were mere waste paper.  Thus, Senator Ben Wade of Ohio, among the bravest and manliest of them all, in a speech in the Senate, December 17, the very day on which the South Carolina Secession Convention was to assemble, said to the Fire-eaters: \"I tell you frankly that we did lay down the principle in our platform, that we would prohibit, if we had the power, Slavery from invading another inch of the Free Soil of this Government.  I stand to that principle to-day.  I have argued it to half a million of people, and they stand by it; they have commissioned me to stand by it; and, so help me God, I will! * * *  On the other hand, our platform repudiates the idea that we have any right, or harbor any ultimate intention to invade or interfere with your institutions in your own States.  * * * It is not, by your own confessions, that Mr. Lincoln is expected to commit any overt act by which you may be injured.  You will not even wait for any, you say; but, by anticipating that the Government may do you an injury, you will put an end to it--which means, simply and squarely, that you intend to rule or ruin this Government.  * * *  As to Compromises, I supposed that we had agreed that the Day of Compromises was at an end.  The most solemn we have made have been violated, and are no more.  * * *  We beat you on the plainest and most palpable issue ever presented to the American people, and one which every man understood; and now, when we come to the Capital, we tell you that our candidates must and shall be inaugurated--must and shall administer this Government precisely as the Constitution prescribes.  * * *  I tell you that, with that verdict of the people in my pocket, and standing on the platform on which these candidates were elected, I would suffer anything before I would Compromise in any way.\"  In the House of Representatives, on December 10, 1860, a number of propositions looking to a peaceful settlement of the threatened danger, were offered and referred to the Select Committee of Thirty-three.  On the following Monday, December 17, by 154 yeas to 14 nays, the House adopted a resolution, offered by Mr. Adrian of New Jersey, in these words:  \"Resolved, That we deprecate the spirit of disobedience to the Constitution, wherever manifested; and that we earnestly recommend the repeal of all Statutes by the State Legislatures in conflict with, and in violation of, that sacred instrument, and the laws of Congress passed in pursuance thereof.\"  On the same day, the House adopted, by 135 yeas to no nays, a resolution offered by Mr. Lovejoy of Illinois, in these words:  \"Whereas, The Constitution of the United States is the Supreme law of the Land, and ready and faithful obedience to it a duty of all good and law-abiding citizens; Therefore:  \"Resolved, That we deprecate the spirit of disobedience to the Constitution, wherever manifested; and that we earnestly recommend the repeal of all Nullification laws; and that it is the duty of the President of the United States to protect and defend the property of the United States.\"       [This resolution, before adoption, was modified by declaring it to      be the duty of all citizens, whether \"good and law abiding\" or not,      to yield obedience to the Constitution, as will be seen by      referring to the proceedings in the Globe of that date, where the      following appears:       \"Mr. LOGAN.  I hope there will be no objection on this side of the      House to the introduction of the [Lovejoy] resolution.  I can see      no difference myself, between this resolution and the one      [Adrian's] just passed, except in regard to verbiage.  I can find      but one objection to the resolution, and that is in the use of the      words declaring that all' law abiding' citizens should obey the      Constitution.  I think that all men should do so.       \"Mr. LOVEJOY.  I accept the amendment suggested by my Colleague.       \"Mr. LOGAN.  It certainly should include members of Congress; but      if it is allowed to remain all 'good and law abiding' citizens, I      do not think it will include them.  [Laughter.]       \"The resolution was modified by the omission of those words.\"]  It also adopted, by 115 yeas to 44 nays, a resolution offered by Mr. Morris of Illinois, as follows:  \"Resolved by the House of Representatives: That we properly estimate the immense value of our National Union to our collective and individual happiness; that we cherish a cordial, habitual, and immovable attachment to it; that we will speak of it as the palladium of our political safety and prosperity; that we will watch its preservation"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7135"],["title","The Great Conspiracy, Volume 3 (#1)"],["body"," asking questions.  I said to Mr. Pickens, 'What next do you propose we shall do? are we to tell the People that Republicanism is a failure?  If you are for that, I am not. I came here to sustain and uphold American institutions; to defend the rights of the North as well as the South; to secure harmony and good fellowship between all Sections of our common Country.' They dared not answer these questions.  The Southern temper had not then been gotten up.  As my questions were not answered, I moved an adjournment of the Caucus /sine die/.  Mr. Craig, of Virginia, seconded the motion, and the company was broken up.  We returned to the House, and Mr. Ingersoll, of Pennsylvania, a glorious patriot then as now, introduced a resolution which temporarily calmed the excitement.\"  The remarks upon this statement, made November 4, 1861, by the National Intelligencer, were as follows:  \"However busy Mr. Pickens may have been in the Caucus after it met, the most active man in getting it up and pressing the Southern members to go into it, was Mr. R.  B. Rhett, also a member from South Carolina.  The occasion, or alleged cause of this withdrawal from the House into secret deliberation was an anti-Slavery speech of Mr. Slade, of Vermont, which Mr. Rhett violently denounced, and proposed to the Southern members to leave the House and go into Conclave in one of the Committee-rooms, which they generally did, if not all of them.  We are able to state, however, what may not have been known to Governor Thomas, that at least three besides himself, of those who did attend it, went there with a purpose very different from an intention to consent to any Treasonable measure.  These three men were Henry A.  Wise, Balie Peyton, and William Cost Johnson.  Neither of them opened his lips in the Caucus; they went to observe; and we can assure Governor Thomas, that if Mr. Pickens or Mr. Calhoun, (whom he names) or any one else had presented a distinct proposition looking to Disunion, or Revolt, or Secession, he would have witnessed a scene not soon to be forgotten.  The three whom we have mentioned were as brave as they were determined.  Fortunately, perhaps, the man whom they went particularly to watch, remained silent and passive.\"  Let us, however, pursue the inquiry a little further.  On the 14th of November, 1860, Alexander H. Stephens addressed the Legislature of Georgia, and in a portion of that address--replying to a speech made before the same Body the previous evening by Mr. Toombs, in which the latter had \"recounted the evils of this Government\"--said:  \"The first [of these evils] was the Fishing Bounties, paid mostly to the sailors of New England.  Our friend stated that forty-eight years of our Government was under the administration of Southern Presidents.  Well, these Fishing Bounties began under the rule of a Southern President, I believe.  No one of them, during the whole forty-eight years, ever set his Administration against the principle or policy of them.  * * *  \"The next evil which my friend complained of, was the Tariff.  Well, let us look at that for a moment.  About the time I commenced noticing public matters, this question was agitating the Country almost as fearfully as the Slave question now is.  In 1832, when I was in college, South Carolina was ready to Nullify or Secede from the Union on this account.  And what have we seen?  The Tariff no longer distracts the public counsels.  Reason has triumphed!  The present Tariff was voted for by Massachusetts and South Carolina.  The lion and the lamb lay down together--every man in the Senate and House from Massachusetts and South Carolina, I think, voted for it, as did my honorable friend himself. And if it be true, to use the figure of speech of my honorable friend, that every man in the North that works in iron, and brass and wood, has his muscle strengthened by the protection of the Government, that stimulant was given by his vote and I believe (that of) every other Southern man.  \"Mr. TOOMBS--The Tariff lessened the duties.  \"Mr. STEPHENS--Yes, and Massachusetts with unanimity voted with the South to lessen them, and they were made just as low as Southern men asked them to be, and that is the rate they are now at.  If reason and argument, with experience, produced such changes in the sentiments of Massachusetts from 1832 to 1857, on the subject of the Tariff, may not like changes be effected there by the same means--reason and argument, and appeals to patriotism on the present vexed question?  And who can say that by 1875 or 1890, Massachusetts may not vote with South Carolina and Georgia upon all those questions that now distract the Country and threaten its peace and existence.  \"Another matter of grievance alluded to by my honorable friend was the Navigation Laws.  This policy was also commenced under the Administration of one of these Southern Presidents who ruled so well, and has been continued through all of them since. * * * One of the objects (of these) was to build up a commercial American marine by giving American bottoms the exclusive Carrying Trade between our own ports.  This is a great arm of national power.  This object was accomplished.  We have now an amount of shipping, not only coastwise, but to foreign countries, which puts us in the front rank of the Nations of the World.  England can no longer be styled the Mistress of the Seas. What American is not proud of the result?  Whether those laws should be continued is another question.  But one thing is certain; no President, Northern or Southern, has ever yet recommended their repeal. * * *  \"These then were the true main grievances or grounds of complaint against the general system of our Government and its workings--I mean the administration of the Federal Government.  As to the acts of the federal States I shall speak presently: but these three were the main ones used against the common head.  Now, suppose it be admitted that all of these are evils in the system; do they overbalance and outweigh the advantages and great good which this same Government affords in a thousand innumerable ways that cannot be estimated?  Have we not at the South, as well as the North, grown great, prosperous, and happy under its operations?  Has any part of the World ever shown such rapid progress in the development of wealth, and all the material resources of national power and greatness, as the Southern States have under the General Government, notwithstanding all its defects?  \"Mr. TOOMBS--In spite of it.  \"Mr. STEPHENS--My honorable friend says we have, in spite of the General Government; that without it, I suppose he thinks, we might have done as well, or perhaps better, than we have done in spite of it.  * * * Whether we of the South would have been better off without the Government, is, to say the least, problematical.  On the one side we can only put the fact, against speculation and conjecture on the other.  * * *  The influence of the Government on us is like that of the atmosphere around us.  Its benefits are so silent and unseen that they are seldom thought of or appreciated.  \"We seldom think of the single element of oxygen in the air we breathe, and yet let this simple, unseen and unfelt agent be withdrawn, this life-giving element be taken away from this all-pervading fluid around us, and what instant and appalling changes would take place in all organic creation.  \"It may be that we are all that we are 'in spite of the General Government,' but it may be that without it we should have been far different from what we are now.  It is true that there is no equal part of the Earth with natural resources superior perhaps to ours.  That portion of this Country known as the Southern States, stretching from the Chesapeake to the Rio Grande, is fully equal to the picture drawn by the honorable and eloquent Senator last night, in all natural capacities.  But how many ages and centuries passed before these capacities were developed to reach this advanced age of civilization. There these same hills, rich in ore, same rivers, same valleys and plains, are as they have been since they came from the hand of the Creator; uneducated and uncivilized man roamed over them for how long no history informs us.  \"It was only under our institutions that they could be developed.  Their development is the result of the enterprise of our people, under operations of the Government and institutions under which we have lived. Even our people, without these, never would have done it.  The organization of society has much to do with the development of the natural resources of any Country or any Land.  The institutions of a People, political and moral, are the matrix in which the germ of their organic structure quickens into life--takes root, and develops in form, nature, and character.  Our institutions constitute the basis, the matrix, from which spring all our characteristics of development and greatness.  Look at Greece.  There is the same fertile soil, the same blue sky, the same inlets and harbors, the same AEgean, the same Olympus; there is the same land where Homer sung, where Pericles spoke; it is in nature the same old Greece--but it is living Greece no more.  \"Descendants of the same people inhabit the country; yet what is the reason of this vast difference?  In the midst of present degradation we see the glorious fragments of ancient works of art-temples, with ornaments and inscriptions that excite wonder and admiration--the remains of a once high order of civilization, which have outlived the language they spoke--upon them all, Ichabod is written--their glory has departed.  Why is this so?  I answer, their institutions have been destroyed.  These were but the fruits of their forms of government, the matrix from which their great development sprang; and when once the institutions of a People have been destroyed, there is no earthly power that can bring back the Promethean spark to kindle them here again, any more than in"]]]
