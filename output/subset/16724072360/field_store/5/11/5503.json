Demetrius can defend the idolatry of his favorites warmly enough, never fear.  If you can spare the time, good Father, stay and help me to convince him.\"  \"I have already stayed too long,\" replied the priest, \"for the Bishop has commanded my presence.  I should like to speak to you, my dear Marcus; to-morrow morning, early, will you come to me?  The Lord be with you, beloved!\"  He rose, and as he gave Mary his hand she detained him a moment signing to her son to leave them, and said in a low tone:  \"Marcus must not suspect that I know of the error into which he has been led; speak roundly to his conscience, and as to the girl, I will take her in hand.  Will it not be possible for Theophilus to grant me an interview?\"  \"Hardly, at present,\" replied the priest.  \"As you know, Cynegius is here and the fate of the Bishop and of our cause hangs on the next few days. Give up your ambitious desires I beseech you, daughter, for even if Theophilus were to admit you I firmly believe, nay--do not be angry-- I can but hope that he would never give way on this point.\"  \"No?\"  said the widow looking down in some embarrassment; but when her visitor was gone she lifted her head with a flash of wilful defiance.  She then made Marcus, who had on the previous day given her a full account of his voyage from Rome, tell her all that had passed between himself and Demetrius; she asked him how he liked his horse, whether he hoped to win the approaching races, and generally what he had been doing and was going to do.  But it did not escape her notice that Marcus was more reticent than usual and that he tried to bring the conversation round to his voyage and to the guests in the Xenodochium; however, she always stopped him, for she knew what he was aiming at and would not listen to anything on that subject.  It was not till long after the slaves had lighted the three-branched silver lamps that Demetrius appeared.  His stepmother received him kindly and began to talk on indifferent subjects; but he replied with ill- disguised impatience, for he had not come to chatter and gossip.  She fully understood this; but it pleased her to check and provoke him and she did it in a way which vividly reminded him of his early days, of the desolation and unhappiness that had blighted his young life when this woman had taken the place of his own tender gentle mother, and come between him and his father.  Day after day, in that bygone time, she had received him just as she had this evening: with words that sounded kindly, but with a cold, unloving heart.  He knew that she had always seen his boyish errors and petty faults in the worst light, attributing them to bad propensities and innate wickedness, that she had injured him in his father's eyes by painting a distorted image of his disposition and doings--and all these sins he could not forgive her.  At the time of his father's assassination Demetrius was already grown to man's estate, and as the eldest son it would have been his right and duty to take part with his uncle Porphyrius in the management of the business; but he could not endure the idea of living in the same place with his stepmother, so, having a pronounced taste for a country life, he left the widow in possession of the house in the Canopic street, persuaded his uncle to pay over his father's share in the business in hard cash and then had quitted Alexandria to take entire charge of the family estates in Cyrenaica. In the course of a few years he had become an admirable farmer; the landowners throughout the province were glad to take his advice or follow his example, and the accounts which he now laid on the table by the side of Mary's couch--three goodly rolls--proved by the irrefragable evidence of figures that he had actually doubled their revenues from the estates of which he had been the manager.  He had earned his right to claim his independence, to persist in his own determinations and to go his own way; he was animated by the pride of an independent nature that recklessly breaks away from a detested tie when it has means at command either to rest without anxiety or to devote its energies to new enterprise.  When Demetrius had allowed his stepmother time enough for subjects in which he took no interest, he laid his hand on the account-books and abruptly observed that it was now time to talk seriously.  He had already explained to Marcus that he could no longer undertake to meet her requirements; and as, with him, to decide was to act, he wished at once to come to a decision as to whether he should continue to manage the family estates in the way he thought proper, or should retire and devote himself to the care of his own land.  If Mary accepted the latter alternative he would at once cancel their deed of agreement, but even then he was very willing to stay on for a time in Cyrenaica, and put the new steward, when she had appointed one, in the way of performing his onerous duties.  After that he would have nothing more to do with the family estates.  This was his last word; and whichever way she decided, they might part without any final breach, which he was anxious to avoid if only for the sake of Marcus.  Demetrius spoke gravely and calmly; still, the bitterness that filled his soul imparted a flavor to his speech that did not escape the widow, and she replied with some emphasis that she should be very sorry to think that any motives personal to herself had led to his decision; she owed much, very much, to his exertions and had great pleasure in expressing her obligations.  He was aware, of course, that the property he had been managing had been purchased originally partly with her fortune and partly out of her husband's pocket, and that half of it was therefore hers and half of it the property of Marcus and himself; but that by her husband's will the control and management were hers absolutely.  She had endeavored to carry out the intentions of her deceased husband by entrusting the stewardship of the estate to Demetrius while he was still quite young; under his care the income had increased, and she had no doubt that in the future he might achieve even greater results; at the same time, the misunderstandings that the whole business had given rise to were not to be endured, and must positively be put an end to, even if their income were to diminish by half.  \"I,\" she  exclaimed, \"am  a  Christian, with  my whole heart and soul. I have dedicated my body and life to the service of my Saviour.  What shall all the treasures of the world profit me if I lose my soul; and that, which is my immortal part, must inevitably perish if I allow my pockets to be filled by the toil of heathen peasants and slaves.  I therefore must insist--and on this point I will not yield a jot--that our slaves in Cyrenaica, a flock of more than three thousand erring sheep, shall either submit to be baptized or be removed to make way for Christians.\"  \"That is to say .  .  .\"  began Demetrius hastily.  \"I have not yet done,\" she interrupted.  \"So far as the peasants are concerned who rent and farm our land they all, without exception--as you said yesterday--are stiff-necked idolaters.  We must give them time to think it over, but the annual agreement will not be renewed with any who will not pledge themselves to give up the old sacrifices and to worship the Redeemer.  If they submit they will be safe--in this world and the next; if they refuse they must go, and the land must be let to Christians in their stead.\"  \"Just as I change this seat for another!\"  said Demetrius with a laugh, and lifting up a heavy bronze chair he flung it down again on the hard mosaic pavement so that the floor shook.  Maria started violently.  \"My body may tremble,\" she said in great excitement, \"but my soul is firm when its everlasting bliss is at stake.  I insist--and my representative, whether he be you or another, must carry my orders into effect without an hour's delay--I insist that every heathen shrine, every image of the field and garden-gods, every altar and sacred stone which the heathens use for their idolatrous practices shall be pulled down, overthrown, mutilated and destroyed.  That is what I require and insist on.\"  \"And that is what I will never consent to,\" cried Demetrius in a voice like low thunder.  \"I cannot and will not.  These things have been held precious and sacred to men for thousands of years and I cannot, will not, blow them off the face of the earth, as you blow a feather off your cloak.  You may go and do it yourself; you may be able to achieve it.\"  \"What do you mean?\"  asked Mary drawing herself up with a glance of indignant protest.  \"Yes--if any one can do it you can!\"  repeated Demetrius imperturbably. \"I went to-day to seek the images of our forefathers--the venerable images that were clear to our infancy, the portraits of our fathers' fathers and mothers, the founders of the honor of our race.  And where are they?  They have gone with the protectors of our home, the pride and ornament of this house--of the street, of the city--the Hermes and Pallas Athene that you--you flung into the lime-kiln.  Old Phabis told me with tears in his eyes.  Alas poor house that is robbed of its past, of its glory, and of its patron deities!\"  \"I have placed it under a better safeguard,\" replied Maria in a tremulous voice, and she looked it Marcus"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5502"],["title","Serapis â€” Volume 02 (#2)"],["body","an appeal for sympathy.  \"Now, for the last time, I ask you:  Will you accede to my demands or will you not?\"  \"I will not,\" said Demetrius resolutely.  \"Then I must find a new agent to manage the estates.\"  \"You will soon find one; but your land--which is our land too--will become a desert.  Poor land!  If you destroy its shrines and sanctuaries you will destroy its soul; for they are the soul of the land.  The first inhabitants gathered round the sanctuary, and on that sanctuary and the gods that dwell there the peasant founds his hopes of increase on what he sows and plants, and of prosperity for his wife and children and cattle and all that he has.  In destroying his shrines you ruin his hopes, and with them all the joy of life.  I know the peasant; he believes that his labors must be vain if you deprive him of the gods that make it thrive. He sows in hope, in the swelling of the grain he sees the hand of the gods who claim his joyful thanksgiving after the harvest is gathered in. You are depriving him of all that encourages and uplifts and rejoices his soul when you ruin his shrines and altars!\"  \"But I give him other and better ones,\" replied Mary.  \"Take care then that they are such as he can appreciate,\" said Demetrius gravely.  \"Persuade him to love, to believe, to hope in the creed you force upon him; but do not rob him of what he trusts in before he is prepared to accept the substitute you offer him.--Now, let me go; we are neither of us in the temper to make the best arrangements for the future. One thing, at any rate, is certain: I have nothing more to do with the estate.\"     CHAPTER VI.  After leaving his stepmother Demetrius made good use of his time and dictated a number of letters to his secretary, a slave he had brought with him to Alexandria, for the use of the pen was to him unendurable labor.  The letters were on business, relating to his departure from Cyrenaica and his purpose of managing his own estates for the future, and when they lay before him, finished, rolled up and sealed, he felt that he had come to a mile-stone on his road, a landmark in his life.  He paced the room in silence, trying to picture to himself the fate of the slaves and peasants who, for so many years, had been his faithful servants and fellow-laborers, whose confidence he had entirely won, and many of whom he truly loved.  But he could not conceive of their life, their toil or their festivals, bereft of images, offerings, garlands, and hymns of rejoicing.  To him they were as children, forbidden to laugh and play, and he could not help once more recurring to his boyhood and the day of his going to school, when, instead of running and shouting in his father's sunny garden, he had been made to sit still and silent in a dull class-room.  And now had the whole world reached such a boundary line in existence beyond which there was to be no more freedom and careless joy-- where a ceaseless struggle for higher things must begin and never end?  If the Gospel were indeed true, and if all it promised could ever find fulfilment, it might perhaps be prudent to admit the sinfulness of man and to give up the joys and glories of this world to win the eternal treasure that it described.  Many a good and wise man whom he had known --nay the Emperor, the great and learned Theodosius himself--was devoted heart and soul to the Christian faith, and Demetrius knew from his own experience that his mother's creed, in which he had been initiated as a boy and from which his father, after holding him at the font had perverted him at an early age, offered great consolations and enduring help to those whose existence was one of care, poverty, and suffering. But his laborers and servants?  They were healthy and contented.  What power on earth could induce them--a race that clung devotedly to custom --to desert the faith of their fathers, and the time-honored traditions to which they owed all the comforts and pleasures of life, or to seek in a strange creed the aid which they already believed that they possessed.  He did not repent of his determination; but he nevertheless said to himself that, when once he was gone, Mary would proceed only too soon on the work of extermination and destruction; and every temple on the estate, every statue, every whispering grotto, every shrine and stone anointed by pious hands, doomed now to perish, rose before his fancy.  Demetrius was accustomed to rise at cock-crow and go to bed at an early hour, and he was on the point of retiring even before the usual time, when Marcus came to his room and begged him to give him yet an hour.  \"You are angry with my mother,\" said the younger man with a look of melancholy entreaty, \"but you know there is nothing that she would not sacrifice for the faith.  And you can smile so bitterly!  But only put yourself in my place.  Loving my mother as I do, it is acutely painful to me to see another person--to see you whom I love, too, for you are my friend and brother--to see you, I say, turn your back on her so completely.  My heart is heavy enough to-day I can tell you.\"  \"Poor boy!\"  said the countryman.  \"Yes, I am truly your friend, and am anxious to remain so; you are not to blame in this business--and for that matter, I am anything but cheerful.  You have chosen to say: Down with the shrines!  Perish all those who do not think as we do!  Still, look at the thing as you will, in some cases certainly violence must ensue--nay, if no blood is shed it will be a wonder!  You sum up the matter in one common term: The heathen peasants on the estate.  My view of it is totally different; I know these farmers and their wives and children, each one by name and by sight.  There is not one but is ready to bid me good day and shake my hand or kiss my dress.  Many a one has come to me in tears and left me happy.--By the great Zeus! no one ever accused me of being soft-hearted, but I could wish this day that I were harder; and my blood turns to gall as I ask--What is all this for--to what possible end?\"  \"For the sake and honor of the faith, Demetrius; for the eternal salvation of our people.\"  \"Indeed!\" retorted Demetrius with a drawl, \"I know better.  If that and that alone were intended you would build churches and chapels and send us worthy priests--Eusebius and the like--and would try to win men's hearts to your Lord by the love you are always talking so much about.  That was my advice to your mother, only this morning.  I believe the end might be attained by those means, among us as elsewhere; ultimately it will, no doubt, be gained--but not to-day nor to-morrow.  A peasant, when he had become accustomed to the church and grasped a trust in the new God, would of his own accord give up the old gods and their sanctuaries; I could count you off a dozen such instances.  That I could have looked on at calmly, for I want only men's arms and legs and do not ask for their souls; but to burn down the old house before you have collected wood and stone to build a new one I call wicked.--It is cruelty and madness, and when so shrewd a woman as your mother is bent on carrying through such a measure, come what may, there is something more behind it.\"  \"You think she wants to get rid of you--you, Demetrius!\" interrupted Marcus eagerly.  \"But you are mistaken, you are altogether wrong.  What you have done for the estate . . .\"  \"Oh! as for that!\" cried the other, \"what has my work to do with all this?  Ere the year is out everything that can remind us of the heathen gods is to be swept away from the hamlets and fields of the pious Mary. That is what is intended!  Then they will hurry off to the Bishop with the great news and to crown one marvel with another, the reversion will be secured of a martyr's nimbus.  And this is what all this zeal is for --this and nothing else!\"  \"You are speaking of my mother, remember!\"  cried Marcus, looking at his brother with a touching appeal in his eyes.  Demetrius shook his shaggy head and spoke more temperately as he went on:  \"Yes, child, I had forgotten that--and I may be mistaken of course, for I am no more than human.  Here one thing follows so close on another, and in this house I feel so battered and storm-tossed, that I hardly know myself.  But old Phabis tells me that steps are being seriously taken to procure the title of Martyr for our father Apelles.\"  \"My mother is quite convinced that he died for the faith, and she loved him devotedly . . .\"  \"Then it is so!\"  cried Demetrius, grinding his teeth and thumping his fist down on the table.  \"The lies sown by one single man have produced a deadly weed that is smothering this miserable house!  You--to be sure, what can you know of our father?  I knew him; I have been present when he and his friends, the philosophers, have laughed to scorn things which not only you Christians but even pious heathen regard as sacred.  Lucretius was his evangelist, and the Cosmogony of that utter atheist lay by his pillow and was his companion wherever he went.\"  \"He admired the heathen poets, but he was a Christian all the same,\" replied Marcus.  \"Neither more nor less than Porphyrius, our uncle, or myself,\" retorted his brother.  \"Since the day when our grandfather Philippus was baptized, wealth and happiness have deserted this house.  He gave up the old gods solely that he might not lose the right of supplying the city and the Emperor with corn, and became a Christian and made his sons Christians. But he had us educated by his heathen friends, and though we passed for Christians we were not so in fact.  When it was absolutely necessary he showed himself in church with us; but our daily life, our pleasures, our pastimes were heathen, and when life began for us in earnest we offered a bleeding sacrifice to the gods.  It was impossible to retract honestly, since a renegade Christian returning to the worship of the old gods is incapacitated by law from making a will.  You know this; and when you ask me why I am content to"]]]
