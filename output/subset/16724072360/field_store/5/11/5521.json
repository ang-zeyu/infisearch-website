Martina thus heard a great deal about Paula; and though it was all adverse and colored to her prejudice she would have liked to see the daughter of the great and famous Thomas whom she had known; besides, after all she had heard, she could fear nothing from Paula for her niece: uncommonly handsome, but haughty, repellent, unamiable, and--like Heliodora herself--of the orthodox sect.--What could tempt \"great Sesostris\" to give her the preference?  Katharina herself proposed to Martina to make them acquainted; but nothing would have induced Dame Martina to go out of her rooms, protected to the utmost from the torrid sunshine, so she left it to Heliodora to pay the visit and give her a report of the hero's daughter.  Heliodora had devoted herself heart and soul to the little heiress, and humored her on many points.  This was carried out.  Katharina actually had the audacity to bring the rivals together, even after she had reported to each all she knew of Orion's position with regard to the other.  It was exquisite sport; still, in one respect it did not fulfil her intentions, for Paula gave no sign of suffering the agonies of jealousy which Katharina had hoped to excite in her.  Heliodora, on the other hand, came home depressed and uneasy; Paula had received her coldly and with polite formality, and the young widow had remained fully aware that so remarkable a woman might well cast her own image in Orion's heart into the shade, or supplant it altogether.  Like a wounded man who, in spite of the anguish, cannot resist touching the wound to assure himself of its state, Heliodora went constantly to see Katharina in order to watch her rival from the garden or to be taken to call on her, though she was always very coldly received.  At first Katharina had pitied the young woman whose superior in intelligence she knew herself to be; but a certain incident had extinguished this feeling; she now simply hated her, and pricked her with needle-thrusts whenever she had a chance.  Paula seemed invulnerable; but there was not a pang which Katharina would not gladly have given her to whom she owed the deepest humiliation her young life had ever known. How was it that Paula failed to regard Heliodora as a rival?  She had reflected that, if Orion had really returned the widow's passion, he could not have borne so long a separation.  It was on purpose to avoid Heliodora, and to remain faithful to what he was and must always be to Paula, that he had gone with the senator, far from Memphis.  Heliodora-- her instinct assured her--was the poor, forsaken woman with whom he had trifled at Byzantium, and for whom he had committed that fatal theft of the emerald.  If Fate would but bring him home to her, and if she then yielded all he asked--all her own soul urged her to grant, then she would be the sole mistress and queen of his heart--she must be, she was sure of it!  And though, even as she thought of it, she bowed her head in care, it was not from fear of losing him; it was only her anxiety about her father, her good old friend, Rufinus, and his family, whom she had made so entirely her own.  This was the state of affairs this morning, when to his old friend's vexation, Philippus had so hastily and silently drunk off his after- breakfast draught; just as he set down the cup, the black door-keeper announced that a hump-backed man wished to see his master at once on important business.  \"Important business!\" repeated the leech.  \"Give me four more legs in addition to my own two, or a machine to make time longer than it is, and then I will take new patients-otherwise no!  Tell the fellow.  .  .  .\"  \"No, not sick.  .  .  .\"  interrupted the negro.  \"Come long way. Gardener to Greek man Rufinus.\"  Philippus started: he could guess what this messenger had to say, and his heart sank with dread as he desired that he might be shown in.  A glance at Gibbus told him what he had rightly feared.  The poor fellow was hardly recognizable.  He was coated with dust from head to foot, and this made him look like a grey-haired old man; his sandals hung to his feet in strips; the sweat, pouring down his cheeks, had made gutters as it were in the dust on his face, and his tears, as the physician held out his hand to him, washed out other channels.  In reply to the leech's anxious, long drawn \"Dead?\"  he nodded silently; and when Philippus, clasping his hands to his temples, cried out: \"Dead! My poor old Rufinus dead!  But how, in Heaven's name, did it happen? Speak, man, speak!\"--Gibbus pointed to the old philosopher and said: \"Come out then, with  me, Master.  No third person.  .  .  .\"  Philippus, however, gave him to understand that Horapollo was his second self; and the hunch-back went on to tell him what he had seen, and how his beloved master had met his end.  Horapollo sat listening in astonishment, shaking his head disapprovingly, while the physician muttered curses.  But the bearer of evil tidings was not interrupted, and it was not till he had ended that Philippus, with bowed head and tearful eyes, said:  \"Poor, faithful old man; to think that he should die thus--he who leaves behind him all that is best in life, while I--I.  .  .  .\"  And he groaned aloud.  The old man glanced at him with reproachful displeasure.  While the leech broke the seals of the tablets, which the abbess had carefully closed, and began to read the contents, Horapollo asked the gardener: \"And the nuns?  Did they all escape?\"  \"Yes, Master! on the morning after we reached Doomiat, a trireme took them all out to sea.\"  And the old man grumbled to himself:  \"The working bees killed and the Drones saved!\"  Gibbus, however, contradicted him, praising the laborious and useful life of the sisters, in whose care he himself had once been.  Meanwhile Philippus had read his friend's last letter.  Greatly disturbed by it he turned hither and thither, paced the room with long steps, and finally paused in front of the gardener, exclaiming: \"And what next?  Who is to tell them the news?\"  \"You,\" replied Gibbus, raising his hands in entreaty.  \"I-oh, of course, I!\"  growled the physician.  \"Whatever is difficult, painful, intolerable, falls on my shoulders as a matter of course!  But I cannot--ought not--I will not do it.  Had I any part or lot in devising this mad expedition?  You observe, Father?--What he, the simpleton, brewed, I--I again am to drink.  Fate has settled that!\"  \"It is hard, it is hard, child!\"  replied the old man.  \"Still, it is your duty.  Only consider--if that man, as he stands before us now, were to appear before the women....\"  But Philippus broke in: \"No, no, that would not do!  And you, Gibbus-- this very day there has been an Arab again to see Joanna; and if they were to suspect that you had been with your master--for you look strangely.--No, man; your devotion merits a better reward.  They shall not catch you.  I release you from your service to the widow, and we-- what do you say, Father?--we will keep him here.\"  \"Right, very right,\" said Horapollo.  \"The Nile must some day rise again. Stay with us; I have long had a fancy to eat vegetables of my own growing.\"  But Gibbus firmly declined the offer, saying he wished to return to his old mistress.  When the physician again pointed out to him how great a danger he was running into, and the old man desired to know his reasons, the hunch-back exclaimed:  \"I promised my master to stay with the women; and now, while in all the household I am the only free man, shall I leave them unprotected to secure my own miserable life?  Sooner would I see a scimitar at my throat.  When my head is off the rascals are welcome to all that is left.\"  The words came hollow and broken from his parched tongue, and as he spoke the faithful fellow's face changed.  Even under the dust he turned pale, and Philippus had to support him, for his feet refused their office.  His long tramp through the torrid heat had exhausted his strength; but a draught of wine soon brought him to himself again and Horapollo ordered the slave to lead him to the kitchen and desire the cook to take the best care of him.  As soon as the friends were alone, the elder observed:  \"That worthy, foolhardy, old child who is now dead, seems to have left you some strange request.  I could see that as you were reading.\"  \"There--take it!\"  replied  Philippus;  and again he walked up and down the room, while Horapollo took the letter.  Both faces of the tablets were covered with irregular, up-and-down lines of writing to the following effect:       \"Rufinus, in view of death, to his beloved Philippus:       \"One shivering fit after another comes over me; I shall certainly      die to-day.  I must make haste.  Writing is difficult.  If only I      can say what is most pressing.--First: Joanna and the poor child.      Be everything you can be to them.  Protect them as their guardian,      Kyrios, and friend.  They have enough to live on and something still      to spare for others.  My brother Leonax manages the property, and he      is honest.  Joanna knows all about it.--Tell her and the poor child      that I send them ten thousand blessings--and to Joanna endless      thanks for all her goodness.--And to you, my friend: heed the old      man's words.  Rid your heart of Paula.  She is not for you: you      know, young Orion.  But as to yourself:  Those who were born in high      places rarely suit us, who have dragged ourselves up from below to a      better position.  Be her friend; that she deserves--but let that be      all.  Do not live alone, a wife brings all that is best into a man's      life; it is she who weaves sweet dreams into his dull sleep.  You      know nothing of all this as yet; and your worthy old friend--to whom      my greetings--has held aloof from it all his life....       \"For your private eye: it is a dying man who speaks thus.  You must      know that my poor child, our Pul, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5525"],["title","The Bride of the Nile â€” Volume 09 (#2)"],["body","you as the most perfect of      men and esteems you above all others.  You know her and Joanna.      Bear witness to your friend that no evil word ever passed the lips      of either of them.  Far be it from me to advise you, who bear the      image of another woman in your heart,--to say: marry the child, she      is the wife for you.  But this much to you both--Father and son--I      do advise you to live with the mother and daughter as true and      friendly house-mates.  You will none of you repent doing so.  This      is a dying man's word.  I can write no more.  You are the women's      guardian, Philip, a faithful one I know.  A common aim makes men      grow alike.  You and I, for many a year.--Take good care of them for      me; I entreat you--good care.\"  The last words were separated and written all astray; the old man could hardly make them out.  He now sat looking, as Phillipus had done before, sorely puzzled and undecided over this strange document.  \"Well?\"  asked the leech at last.  \"Aye-well?\"  repeated the other with a shrug.  Then both again were silent; till Horapollo rose, and taking his staff, also paced the room while he murmured, half to himself and half to his younger friend \"They are two quiet, reasonable women.  There are not many of that sort, I fancy.  How the little one helped me up from the low seat in the garden!\" It was a reminiscence that made him chuckle to himself; he stopped Philippus, who was pacing at his side, by lightly patting his arm, exclaiming with unwonted vivacity:  \"A man should be ready to try everything--the care of women even, before he steps into the grave. And is it a fact that neither of them is a scold or a chatter-box?\"  \"It is indeed.\"  \"And what 'if' or 'but' remains behind?\"  asked the old man.  \"Let us be reckless for once, brother!  If the whole business were not so diabolically serious, it would be quite laughable.  The young one for me and the old one for you in our leisure hours, my son; better washed linen; clothes without holes in them; no dust on our books; a pleasant 'Rejoice' every morning, or at meal-times;--only look at the fruit on that dish!  No better than the oats they strew before horses.  At the old man's everything was as nice as it used to be in my own home at Philae: Supper a little work of art, a feast for the eye as well as the appetite! Pulcheria seems to understand all that as well as my poor dead sister did.  And then, when I want to rise, such a kind, pretty little hand to help one up!  I have long hated this dwelling.  Lime and dust fall from the ceiling in my bedroom, and here there are wide gaps in the flooring- I stumbled over one yesterday--and our niggardly landlords, the officials, say that if we want anything repaired we may do it ourselves, that they have no money left for such things.  Now, under that worthy old man's roof everything was in the best order.\"  The philosopher chuckled aloud and rubbed his hands as he went on: \"Supposing we kick over the traces for once, Philip.  Supposing we were to carry out our friend's dying wish?  Merciful Isis!  It would certainly be a good action, and I have not many to boast of.  But cautiously--what do you say?  We can always throw it up at a month's notice.\"  Then he grew grave again, shook his head, and said meditatively: \"No, no; such plans only disturb one's peace of mind.  A pleasant vision!  But scarcely feasible.\"  \"Not for the present, at any rate,\" replied the leech.  \"So long as Paula's fate remains undecided, I beg you to let the matter rest.\"  The old man muttered a curse on her; then he said with a vicious, sharp flash in his eyes: \"That patrician viper!  Every where in everything--she spoils it all!  But wait a while!  I fancy she will soon be removed from our path, and then...  No, even now, at the present time, I will not allow that we should be deprived of what would embellish life, of doing a thing which may turn the scale in my favor in the day of judgment.  The wishes of a dying man are sacred: So our fathers held it; and they were right.  The old man's will must be done!  Yes, yes, yes.  It is settled. As soon as that hindrance is removed, we will keep house with the two women.  I have said; and I mean it.\"  At this point the gardener came in again, and the old man called out to him:  \"Listen, man.  We shall live together after all; you shall hear more of this later.  Stay with my people till sundown, but you must keep your own counsel, for they are all listeners and blabs.  The physician here will now take the melancholy tidings to the unfortunate widow, and then you can talk it all over with her at night.  Nothing startling must take place at the house there; and with regard to your master, even his death must remain a secret from every one but us and his family.\"  The gardener knew full well how much depended on his silence; Philippus tacitly agreed to the old man's arrangement, but for the present he avoided discussing the matter with the women.  When, at length he set off on his painful errand to the widow, Horapollo dismissed him saying:  \"Courage, courage, my Son.--And as you pass by, just glance at our little garden;--we grieved to see the fine old palm-tree perish; but now a young and vigorous shoot is growing from the root.\"  \"It has been drooping since yesterday and will die away,\" replied Philippus shrugging his shoulders.  But the old man exclaimed: \"Water it, Gibbus! the palm-tree must be watered at once.\"  \"Aye, you have water at hand for that!\"  retorted the leech, but he added bitterly as he reached the stairs, \"If it were so in all cases!\"  \"Patience and good purpose will always win,\" murmured the old man; and when he was alone he growled on angrily: \"Only be rid of that dry old palm-tree--his past life in all its relations to that patrician hussy Away with it, into the fire!--But how am I to get her?  How can I manage it?\"  He threw himself back in his arm-chair, rubbing his forehead with the tips of his fingers.  He had come to no result when the negro requested an audience for some visitors.  These were the heads of the senate of Memphis, who had come as a deputation to ask counsel of the old sage. He, if any one, would find some means of averting or, at any rate, mitigating the fearful calamity impending over the town and country, and against which prayer, sacrifice, processions, and pilgrimages had proved abortive.  They were quite resolved to leave no means untried, not even if heathen magic should be the last resource.      CHAPTER X.  All Katharina's sympathy with Heliodora had died finally in the course of the past, moonless night.  She had secretly accompanied her, with her maid and an old deaf and dumb stable-slave, to a soothsayer--for there still were many in Memphis, as well as magicians and alchemists; and this woman had told the young widow that her line of life led to the greatest happiness, and that even the wildest wishes of her heart would find fulfilment.  What those wishes were Katharina knew only too well; the probability of their accomplishment had roused her fierce jealousy and made her hate Heliodora.  Heliodora had gone to consult the sorceress in a simple but rich dress. Her peplos was fastened on the shoulder, not by an ordinary gold pin, but by a button which betrayed her taste for fine jewels, as it consisted of a sapphire of remarkable size; this had at once caught the eye of the witch, showing her that she had to deal with a woman of rank and wealth. She had taken Katharina, who had come very plainly dressed, for her companion or poor friend, so she had promised her no more than the removal of certain hindrances, and a happy life at last, with a husband no longer young and a large family of children.  The woman's business was evidently a paying one; the interior of her house was conspicuously superior to the wretched hovels which surrounded it, in the poorest and most squalid part of the town.  Outside, indeed, it differed little from its neighbors; in fact; it was intentionally neglected, to mislead the authorities, for witchcraft and the practice of magic arts were under the penalty of death.  But the fittings of the roofless centre-chamber in which she was wont to perform her incantations and divinations argued no small outlay.  On the walls were hangings with occult figures; the pillars were painted with weird and grewsome pictures; crucibles and cauldrons of various sizes were simmering over braziers on little altars; on the shelves and tables stood cups, phials, and vases, a wheel on which a wryneck hopped up and down, wax images of men and women--some with needles through their hearts, a cage full of bats, and glass jars containing spiders, frogs, leeches, beetles, scorpions, centipedes and other foul creatures; and lengthways down the room was stretched a short rope walk, used in a Thracian form of magic. Perfumes and pungent vapors filled the air, and from behind a curtain which hid the performers came a monotonous music of children's voices, bells, and dull drumming.  Medea, so the wise woman was called, though scarcely past five and forty, harmonized in appearance with this strange habitation, full as it was of objects calculated to rouse repulsion, dread, and amazement.  Her face was pale, and her extraordinary height was increased by a mass of coal- black hair, curled high over a comb at the very top of her head.  At the end of the first visit paid her by the two young women, who had taken her by surprise, so that several things were lacking which on the second occasion proved to be very effective in the exercise of her art, she had made Heliodora promise to return in three days' time.  The young widow had kept her word, and had made her appearance punctually with Katharina.  To be in Egypt, the land of sorcery and the magic arts, without putting them to the test, was impossible.  Even Martina allowed this, though she did not care for such things for herself.  She was content with"]]]
