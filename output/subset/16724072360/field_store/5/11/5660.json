But come home with me for the sake of Lang Syne,    And see Mrs. Merdle and see how we dine.     I must not expect,” he advised in advance,    “To meet with a dinner got up in perfection,    But must run the risk of the luck and the chance,    As candidates do on the day of election.”     The Merdle Origin.      Now Merdle, _en passant_, I had known for a score    Of years, when a dinner with Jones, Brown or Smith    As good as one gets for a quarter or more,    Was a thing unthought of, or else but a myth    In Merde's day-dreaming of things yet in store,    When hope painted visions of a painted abode,    And hope never hoped for anything more--    I'm sure never dreamed he would dine _a la mode_.     In dreams wildest fancy I doubt if he dreamed,    That time in its changes that wears rocky shores,    Should change what so changeless certainly seemed,    Till Merdle, Jack Merdle, would own twenty stores,    Much more own a bank, e'en the horse that he rode,    Or pay half the debts of the wild oats he sowed.     I knew when he worked at his old father's trade,    And thought he would stick to his wax and the last,    But Fortune, the fickle, incontinent jade,    A turn to his fortune has given a cast;    “A wife with a fortune,” which men hunt in packs,    To Jack was the fortune that fell to his share;    A fortune that often is such a hard tax,    That men hurry through it with “nothing to spare,”     With “nothing to eat,” or a house “fit to live in,”     With “nothing half decent” to put on their backs,    With nothing “exclusive” to have or believe in,    “Except what is common to common street hacks.”     So fortune and comfort, that should be like brothers,    Though fought for and bled for where fortunes are made,    Though sought for and failed of by ten thousand others,    Are not worth the fighting and fuss that is made.     But fortune for Merdle by Cupid was cast,    And bade him look higher than wax and the last,    That Merdle his father, with good honest trade,    Had used with the stitches his waxed end had made.     I knew when old Merdle lived down by the mill,    I often went fishing and Jack dug the bait;    But Jack Merdle then never thought he should fill    With fish and roast meat such a full dinner plate:    Nor I, when my line which I threw for a trout    While Jack watched the bob of the light floating cork,    Ever thought of the time in a “Merdle turn out”     To ride, or to dine with a pearl handle fork    In Jack's splendid mansion, where taste, waste and style,    Contend for preemption, as then by the mill,    Old Merdle contended with fortune the while,    For bread wherewithal Jack's belly to fill.     [Illustration: “I NEVER THOUGHT THEN LITTLE KITTY MALONE, AS HEIR TO    OLD CRIPUS WOULD BRING HIM THE CASH.”]     I never thought then little Kitty Malone    As heir to old Gripus would bring him the cash,    'Pon which as a banker Jack Merdle has shone,    And Kitty in fashion has cut such a dash;    Nor when as a girl not a shoe to her feet,    She accepted my offers of coppers or candy,    She would tell me in satin “we've nothing to eat,”     While eating from silver or sipping her brandy,    And wond'ring that Merdle, the Jack I have named,    Should bring home a friend--['twas thus she exclaimed--    The day that I've mentioned--a day to remember--    When Merdle and I in his carriage and bays,    Through Avenue Five on a day in September,    Drove up to a mansion with gas-light ablaze.)     Mrs. Merdle At Home.      She Discourseth of Nothing to Eat and the Cost thereof.     Why Merdle--why did you bring Dinewell to-day?    So very, though welcome, so quite unexpected!     For dinner, if any, I'm sure I can't say,    Our servants with washing are all so infected.     If any's provided, 't is nothing but scraps    Of pot-luck or pick up of some common fare;    Or something left over from last week perhaps,    Which you've brought a friend, and an old one, to share.     I never, I'm sure now, so much was ashamed,    To think he'll discover--what's true to the letter--    We've nothing, or next to't that's fit to be named,    For one who is used every day to what's better.     But what can you expect if you come on a Monday?    Our French cook's away too, I vow and declare--    But if you would see us with something to spare,    Let's know when you're coming, or come on a Sunday;    For that of all others, for churchmen or sinners,    A day is for gorging with extra good dinners.     [Illustration: “AND THAT IS JUST WHAT, AS OUR BUTCHER EXPLAINS, THE    DICKENS HAS PLAYED WITH OUR BEEF AND OUR MUTTON.”]     If Merdle had told me a friend would be here,    A dinner I'd get up in spite of the bills--    I often tell butcher he's wonderful dear--    He says every calf that a butcher now kills,    Will cost near as much as the price of a steer,    Before all the banks in their discount expanded    And flooded the country with 'lamp-black and rags,'    Which poor men has ruined and shipwrecked and stranded    On Poverty's billows and quick-sands and crags.     And that is just what, as our butcher explains,    The dickens has played with our beef and our mutton;    But something is gained, for, with all of his pains,    The poor man won't make of himself such a glutton.     I'm sure if they knew what a sin 't is to eat,    When things are all selling at extravagant prices,    That poor folks more saving would be of their meat,    And learn by example how little suffices.     I wish they could see for themselves what a table--    What examples we set to the laboring poor,    In prudence, and saving, in those who are able    To live like a king and his court on a tour.     I feel, I acknowledge, sometimes quite dejected    To think, as it happens with you here today,    To drop in so sudden and quite unexpected,    How poor we are living some people will say.     Mrs. Merdle goes to Market.      With prices outrageous they charge now for meat,    And servants so worthless are every day growing,    I wonder we get half enough now to eat,    And shouldn't if 't want for the fact of my going    To market to cheapen potatoes and beef,    And talk to the butchers about their abuses,    And listen to stories beyond our belief,    They tell while they cheat us, by way of excuses.     And grocers--do tell us--is 't legal to charge    Such prices for sugar, and butter, and flour?     Oh, why don't the Mayor in his wisdom enlarge    Both weight and measure as he does 'doubtful power?'     The Dinner-bell Rings.      Mrs. Merdle Describes the Sufferings of Dyspepsia and its Remedy.     But come, now, I hear by the sound of the ringing    That dinner is ready; and time none to spare    To finish our eating in time for the singing    At Niblo's; or at Burton's drop in for a stare.     To 'kill time' the object, whatever the source is,    And that is the reason we sit at the table    And call for our dinner in slow-coming courses,    To kill, while we eat, all the time we are able.     Though little, I told you, that's worthy your taste    You'll find on our table, pray don't think us mean--    Your welcome is ample--that's better than waste--    Oh! here comes the soup in a silver tureen--    'Tis mock turtle too--so good for digestion:    That kills me by inches, the wretched complaint    Dyspepsia--to cure which, I take by suggestion    Port-wine in the soup, when I feel slightly faint.     The Dinner Table Talk.      Now soup, if you like made of beef very nice,    You'll find this the next thing to the height of perfection;    And eaten with ketchup, or thickened with rice,    Will suit you I know, if this is your selection.     My own disposition to this one inclines,    But dreadful dyspepsia destroys all the pleasure    Of dinner, except it's well tinctured with wines    Which plan I adopt as a health-giving measure.     A table well ordered, well furnished, and neat,    No wonder our nature for ever is tempting;    And I'd like to know if Mahomet could beat    Its pleasures--dyspepsia for ever exempting--    With all that he promised in paradise gained,    With Houris attendant in place of the churls    With which we are worried, tormented, and pained--    The colored men servants, or green Irish girls.     Mrs. Merdle doubts Paradise's Uneating Pleasure.      Though Houris are handsome, though lovely the place--    More lovely perhaps than our own country seat--    I never could see, in the light of free grace    What pleasure they have there with nothing to eat.     With nothing to wear, if the climate is suiting,    We might get along I am sure pretty well;    No washing and starching and crimping and fluting,    No muslin and laces and trouble of dressing, they tell,    E'er troubles the women, or bothers the men,    Who soon grow accustomed, as people do here,    To fashions prevailing, and things that they ken;    To dresses fore-shortened where bosoms appear;    To bonnets that show but a rose in the wearing;    To dresses that sweep like a besom the street;    To dresses so gauzy the hoops through are seen;    To shoes quite as gauzy to cover the feet;    But watch how a man here goes raving and swearing,    At wife and all hands, if they've nothing to eat!     Mrs. Merdle Discourseth of Things Earthly.      No matter how costly or flimsy her dresses,    The angel you honor with your kind attentions;    No matter how foolish her wardrobe inventions,    You love her, or say so, from slipper to tresses;    But, presto! you call her the greatest of sinners,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5868"],["title","Nothing to Eat (#2)"],["body","smiling, she treats you to badly cooked dinners;    Which proves where the seat is of men's best affections,    With which 'pon their honor they extol us as wives,    And treat us at dinner with sagest reflections,    Of beauty, and duty we owe all our lives    To you, noble lords, of this mundane creation;    Which, judging from some things they tell us,    Was made for the creatures of this trading nation,    Who make it a business to buy us and sell us,    Like 'Erie,' or 'Central,' or other such stocks;    With care, when they bid for a very 'Miss Nancy,'    That she's of a stock that the brokers call 'fancy,'    Or else has a pocket 'chuck full of the rocks'--    The rocks that are wrecking each day of their sailing,    More fortunes than ever in ocean were swallowed;    Where 'ventures' of marriage their victims impaling    With mammon and mis'ry together have wallowed.     Mrs. Merdle Discourseth of Things Eatable.      Now Colonel, to husband you need not be winking,    While wiping the soup with a smile from your lips;    I know just as well as he does how you're thinking    The soup is as tasteless as though made of chips.     You need not deny it, and swear that no better    Concocted was ever in London or Paris;    Remember the praises you gave in your letter    Of cooking and eating you wrote to Miss Harris.     Now, Colonel, don't offer a word more to flatter--    The soup may be so-so, but wait for the meat;    And after you've seen the last dish, plate, or platter,    You'll own then, I'm certain, we've nothing to eat--    That is compared, as described to Miss Harris,    With all the best tables you eat at in Paris.     Mrs. Merdle Ordereth the Second Course.      Come, John, Jane, and Susan, the soup take away,    And bring in the turbot, the sheep's head and bass;    And have you got lobster and salad to-day?    And see that the celery's all right in the glass.     Now fish--Colonel Dinewell, which fish will you try?    And how shall I dress it to suit your nice taste?    For sauce to the fish is as love to the sigh,    Imperfect, it's worthless, and both prove a waste.     Mrs. Merdle Discourseth of Hygiene and Fish Sauce.      But this is concocted by rules so complete;    Though piquant, is healthy and easy digested;    And if you will note it as slowly we eat,    The contents I'll give for our friends interested.     Imprimus: in fish stock, an onion we stew,    And anchovy essence two spoonfuls we add;    With butter, horse-radish, and lemons a few;    Mushrooms, too, in ketchup is not very bad;    And pickle of walnuts with onions chopped fine,    To which there is added some old sherry wine.     My doctor, so queer, when I suffer distress,    Inquires what I've latterly foolishly eaten,    And swears that to swallow this 'horrible mess,'    Would entitle a dog like a dog to be beaten.     But la! such a doctor knows nothing of women's complaints,    And talks Latin nonsense about 'regular diet;'    And thinks that us mortals--should live more like saints,    On moonshine and nonsense of a heavenly quiet.     He says that a woman of my plaint complaining,    If she was a woman at all half discreet,    Would shudder to think every day she is maiming    Her stomach with trash, and such stuff as we eat!     Mrs. Merdle Describeth her Doctor.      But he's an old fogy, you may know by this sign--    He don't smoke tobacco, drink lager or wine;    And swears that rich gravy, roast pork or chop,    Would kill a big ostrich, if stuffed in his crop.     He told me one day 'bout the pain in my feet,    'I see what 't is ails you--you've nothing to eat!'     Provoking, absurd, foolish hint that my health    Was injured by eating what station and wealth    And fashion give right for my sex to enjoy    In spite of the doctors we choose to employ.     Mrs. Merdle Discourseth again on Dinner.      But you are not eating, and I fear that the fish,    Or else 't is the gravy's not done to your wish.     You're starving while waiting for something to eat--    Thank fortune I told you how poorly we live--    I hope John now will give us a piece of roast meat,    Or else such a dinner you'd never forgive.     Why yes, Merdle, look, there is beef on that dish--    Jane Hill, don't you see, there's a plate here to shift--    That John is now bringing--'t is all he can lift--    And Colonel, that turkey, you know 't is my wish--    You know that Excelsior's your motto in carving--    As nothing more now we shall have on the table    “We'll eat and give thanks this day that we're able    To keep our poor bodies entirely from starving.     Now Susan's this all that you've been able to pick up?    Oh, no! there's a ham, and it's done to a turn    So nice, that the nose of a Jew needn't stick up;    And a tongue--well, a tongue I never could spurn;    It's nice while the wine at our leisure we sip;    And good with a cracker in wine we can dip.     [Illustration: “MY APPETITE'S NONE OF THE BEST AND SO I MUST PAMPER    THE DELICATE THING. AND TICKLE A FANCY THAT'S VERY CAPRICIOUS WITH    BITS OF A TURKEY, THE BREAST OR THE WING. WITH KIRF VERY TENDER AND    GRAVY DELICIOUS.”]     Mrs. Merdle Accepteth of a slight Dinner, suitable for a Woman suffering with Dyspepsia.      Some turkey? why yes--the least mite will suffice;    A side bone and dressing and bit of the breast;    The tip of the rump--that's it--and one o' the fli's--    In spite of the doctor: my appetite's none of the best,    And so I must pamper the delicate thing,    And tickle a fancy that's very capricious    With bits of a turkey, the breast or the wing,    With beef very tender, and gravy delicious.     Some beef now? I thank you, not any at present;    I'll nibble a little at what I have got,    And wish for a duck, or a grouse, or a pheasant,    Though none of them come for a wish, in the pot.     Mrs. Merdle Discourseth of Wishes and her Sufferings.      'If wishes were horses'--I've heard when a girl--    'If wishes were horses, the beggars would ride'--    If wishes were pheasants, I'd wish with a skirl    Till cooked ones came flying and sat by my side.     A fig, then, for doctors, their tinctures and drugs;    Good eating would cure me, with plenty of game;    And as for pill boxes, and bottles, and jugs,    I wouldn't know one, when I saw it, by name.     Oh, dear! such a load now my stomach oppresses,    While eating these trifles, attempting to dine--    I'm sure 'taint the turkey--it must be my dresses--    And if so 't will ease them to sip sherry wine.     'Tis sad, though, to be such a sad invalid--    Dear me, Colonel Dinewell, you've done eating meat--    Your doctor, like mine, I hope hasn't forbid,    That you shouldn't have, as I do, so little to eat.    Ah! well then, I see, though I've hardly begun,    The meats and the solids must go right away;    So bring in the pudding, if Susan's got one,    Which will for a while one's appetite stay.     Mrs. Merdle Discourseth of Pudding.      A pudding! why yes, as I live, too, it's plum;    So plain, Susan makes them on purpose for me    I never refuse, when the plum puddings come,    To finish my dinner, if finished 't can be    On things unsubstantial, like puddings and pies,    So made up of suet, and currants, and flour,    Like this one before us, to get up the size,    And stirred up and beaten with eggs by the hour,    With bread crumbs, and citron, and small piece of mace;    With nutmeg, and cinnamon, and sugar, and milk,    And” currants, and raisins, and spices so race,    And what else I know not of things of that ilk.     The whole after cooking six hours at the least,    When thus well compounded with delicate skill,    With wine sauce is eaten, to finish the feast,    And suits the digestion of ladies quite ill,    Who suffer as I do, from having bad cooks,    And very weak stomachs, and food that near kills 'em;    And then such a sight of bad rules in the books    From contents to finis, to cure one that fills 'em.     [Illustration: “FOR NOTHING TO CURE WITH IS USED BUT COLD WATER: AND    WHAT WITH THE BATHING AND WASHING AND SCRUBBING--“]     There's one of all others so much recommended    To cure every ill of old Eve's every daughter,    With nothing or next to't, for medicine expended,    For nothing to cure with is used but cold water.     And what with the bathing, and washing, and scrubbing;    The packing, and sweating, and using the sheet;    The shower bath, and douche bath, and all sorts of rubbing;    And literally nothing but brown bread to eat,    No wonder the patient accepts of the lure,    To escape such a ducking, acknowledged a cure.     But Lord, what a skein I have made of my yarn,    While Susan's arranging and changing the plates,    And running all round old Robin Hood's barn,    Like puzzles at school that we made on our slates;    But talking of puzzles, no one that we made,    While playing the fool we played as a trade,    When childhood and folly joined hands at the schools,    Could equal the pranks of these cold-water fools.     Yes, yes, Mr. Merdle, I knew by the smelling    The pudding was ready, without any telling;    So Colonel, I'll help you a delicate slice--    For nothing, I'm sure, like a dinner you've eaten--    And afterwards follow with jelly and ice,    So pleasant while waiting to cool off the heat on;    And then with a syllabub, comfit, or cream,    Our dessert of almonds and raisins we'll nibble,    Till coffee comes in to revive with it's steam,    When cakes in its fragrance we'll leisurely dibble.     I'm sure after all it's a terrible bore    To labor so hard as we do for our victuals;    I envy the women that beg at the door,    Or hire out for wages to handle your kettles,    And wash, bake, and iron, and do nothing but cooking,    So rugged and healthy, and often good looking:    The doctor has told me except when they're mothers,    They never take tincture, or rhubarb, or pill,    And swears the"]]]
