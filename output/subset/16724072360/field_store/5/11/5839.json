She still looks at me, but how cold her face is!\" Saying this, the poor child suddenly rose from the side of her dead sister, and, running terrified, threw herself into the arms of her mother; while the distracted parent, forgetful that her paralyzed limbs were incapable of sustaining her, made a violent effort to rise, and ran toward the corpse; but her strength failed her, and she fell on the floor, uttering a last cry of despair. That cry found an echo in Morel's heart, and roused him from his stupor; with one step he reached the bed's side, snatching from it his child, four years old. She was dead! Cold and want had hastened her end, although her complaint, brought on by the want of common necessaries, was beyond cure. Her poor little limbs were already cold and stiff. Morel, his gray hair almost standing on end with despair and fright, remained motionless, holding his dead child in his arms, whom he contemplated with fixed, tearless eyes, bloodshot with agony.  \"Morel! Morel! give my Adele to me!\" shrieked the unhappy mother, holding out her arms toward her husband; \"it is not true that she is dead: you shall see--I will warm her in my arms!\"  The idiot's curiosity was excited by the haste with which the two bailiffs approached the lapidary, who would not part with the body of his infant. The old woman ceased to howl, rose from her bed, slowly approached Morel, and passing her hideous and stupid face over his shoulder, gazed vacantly on the corpse of her grandchild. The features of the idiot retained their usual expression of ferocity. After a little time, she uttered a sort of hoarse, hollow groan, like a hungry beast, and returning to her bed, she threw herself upon it, crying out, \"I am hungry! I am hungry!\"  \"You see, gentlemen, this poor little girl, just four years old-- Adele; yes, she was named Adele. Only last night, she fondly returned my caresses--and now--look at her! You will, perhaps, say that I have one less to feed, and that I ought not to murmur,\" said the artisan, with a haggard look.  The poor man's reason began to totter under so many repeated shocks.  \"Morel, I want my child; I will have her!\" said Madeleine.  \"True, true,\" replied the lapidary, \"each in turn, that is but fair!\" He went and laid the child in the arms of his wife. Then, hiding his face between his hands, he groaned bitterly. Madeleine, almost as frenzied as her husband, laid the child in the straw of her couch, and watched it with a sort of savage jealousy; while the other children were kneeling round in tears.  The bailiffs, for a moment softened by the death of the child, soon returned to their accustomed brutality of conduct. \"Oh, look here, my friend,\" said Malicorne to the lapidary, \"your child is dead; it is unfortunate, but we are all mortal; we cannot help it, nor can you, so there's an end of it. We have an extra job to do to-day--a _swell_ to grab.\"  Morel did not hear the man. Completely lost in mournful contemplation, the artisan said to himself, in a hollow and broken voice: \"It will be necessary to bury my poor little girl--to watch her here till they come to carry her away. But how?--we have nothing! And the coffin!-- who will give us credit? Oh, a little coffin for a child of four years old ought not to cost much! And then we shall want no bearers! One can take it under his arm. Ha! ha! ha!\" added he, with a frightful burst of laughter, \"how lucky I am! She might perhaps have lived to be eighteen, Louise's age, and no one would have given me credit for a large coffin!\"  \"Egad! this chap seems as though he would lose his senses!\" said Bourdin to Malicorne. \"Look at him; he quite frightens me! and how the old idiot howls with hunger! What a queer lot!\"  \"We must, however, make a finish; although the arrest of this beggar is only for seventy-six francs, seventy-five centimes, it is only right that we should swell the costs to two hundred and forty or fifty francs. It is the _wolf_ who pays.\"  \"You mean who has to _fork out_--for this poor devil here will have to pay the fiddler, since it is he that must dance.\"  \"By the time he has paid his creditor two thousand five hundred francs, for principal, interest, costs, and all, he will be warm.\"  \"It will not be then as now, for it freezes,\" said the bailiff, blowing his fingers. \"Come, old fellow, pack up and let us be off; you can blubber as you go along. Who the devil can help the youngun's kicking the bucket!\"  \"Besides, when people are so poor, they have no right to have children.\"  \"A good idea!\" said Malicorne. Then slapping Morel on the shoulder, he continued: \"Come, come, old boy, we can wait no longer; since you cannot pay, off to prison with you!\"  \"Prison!\" said a pure, youthful voice; \"Morel to prison!\" A young, bright, rosy brunette suddenly entered the garret.  \"Oh, Miss Dimpleton!\" said one of the children, crying; \"you are so good; save papa! they want to take him to prison, and little sister is dead.\"  \"Adele dead!\" exclaimed the girl, whose large, brilliant black eyes were veiled in tears. \"Your father to prison? This cannot be.\" Stupefied by surprise, she looked alternately at the lapidary, his wife, and the bailiffs.  \"My pretty girl,\" said Bourdin approaching Miss Dimpleton, \"you're cool, you must try to make this poor man listen to reason; his little girl is dead, but nevertheless he must come with us to Clichy--to the debtors' prison. We are sheriffs' officers.\"  \"It is, then, all true,\" said the girl.  \"Quite true. The mother has the little one in her bed--they cannot take it from her; and while she is hugging it there, the father ought to take the opportunity of slipping out.\"  \"My God! my God! what misery,\" said Miss Dimpleton. \"What is to be done?\"  \"Pay, or go to prison! there is no other way, unless you have notes for two or three thousand francs to lend them,\" said Malicorne, in a careless tone; \"if you have them, _shell out_, and we will _cut_, devilish glad to get away.\"  \"Oh, this is dreadful!\" said Miss Dimpleton, with indignation; \"daring to jest with such dreadful misfortunes.\"  \"Well then, joking aside,\" replied the other bailiff, \"if you would do some good, endeavor to prevent the woman from seeing us take away her husband. You will thus save each of them a very disagreeable quarter of an hour.\"  The advice was good, though coarsely given, and Miss Dimpleton, following it, approached Madeleine, who, distracted with grief, did not appear to notice the young girl, as she knelt down beside the bed with the children.  Meanwhile, Morel had only recovered from his temporary delirium to sink under the most painful reflections. Having become calm, he could view far too clearly the horror of his situation. The notary must be pitiless, since he had gone to such extremity; the bailiffs did but do their duty. The artisan was therefore resigned.  \"Come, come, let's be marching some time to-day,\" said Bourdin to him.  \"I cannot leave these diamonds here, my wife is half mad,\" said Morel, pointing to the stones scattered upon the bench; \"the person for whom I work will come for them this morning, or in the course of the day. Their amount is considerable.\"  \"Good!\" said Hoppy, who still remained near the half-open door: \"good, good! Screech-Owl shall know that.\"  \"Grant me only till to-morrow,\" urged Morel, \"that I may restore the diamonds.\"  \"Impossible! We must go immediately.\"  \"But I cannot, by leaving the diamonds here, run the risk of their being lost.\"  \"Take them with you, a coach waits at the door, which you will have to pay for, with the other expenses. We can call on the owner of the stones; if he is not at home you can place them in the registry at Clichy; they will be as safe there as in the bank. Come, make haste; we will slip away before your wife or children are aware of it.\"  \"Grant me only till to-morrow, that I may bury my child!\" entreated Morel, with a supplicating voice, half stifled with the sobs he endeavored to restrain.  \"No! we have already lost more than an hour waiting here.\"  \"This burying still worries you, then?\" added Malicorne.  \"Oh! yes, it makes me sad,\" said Morel, with bitterness; \"you so much fear to grieve people. Well, then, a last farewell!\"  \"There, again! confound you, make haste!\" said Malicorne, with brutal impatience.  \"How long have you had the order to arrest me?\"  \"The judgment was signed four months since; but it was only yesterday that our officer received instructions from the lawyer to put it in execution.\"  \"Yesterday only. Why was it delayed so long?\"  \"How can I tell? Come, pack up.\"  \"Yesterday! and Louise not yet here! Where can she be? what has become of her?\" said the lapidary, taking from the bench a card-box filled with cotton, in which he arranged the jewels. \"But never mind that; in prison I shall have plenty of time for thinking.\"  \"Come, pack up the duds to take with you, and make haste and dress yourself.\"  \"I have no clothes to pack up: I have only these diamonds to take away, and place in the prison registry.\"  \"Well, then, dress yourself.\"  \"I have no other clothes than these.\"  \"Going out in these rags?\" said Bourdin.  \"You will be ashamed of me, doubtless,\" said the lapidary, bitterly.  \"No, it is of no consequence, since we go in your coach,\" answered Malicorne.  \"Father, father! mother is calling you,\" said one of the children.  \"You hear?\" muttered Morel, rapidly, appealing to one of the bailiffs; \"do not be inhuman; grant me a last favor. I have not the courage to say farewell to my wife and children; it would break my heart. If they see you take me away they will run after me, and I would avoid that. I therefore beg of you to say aloud that you will return in three or four days, and pretend to go away; you can wait for me on the landing below; I will come to you in less than five minutes. That will spare "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6602"],["title","Mysteries of Paris — Volume 02 (#2)"],["body","the pain of saying farewell. I will no longer resist, I promise you. I shall go stark mad; I was nearly so just now.\"  \"Not so green!--you want to give us the slip!\" said Malicorne, \"want to bolt, old son!\"  \"Oh, God! God!\" cried Morel, with mournful indignation.  \"I don't think he intends to chouse us,\" said Bourdin, in a low tone to his companion; \"let us do as he wishes, or we'll never get away. I will wait outside the door, there is no other outlet from the garret-- he cannot escape us.\"  \"Very well; but he needn't be so particular about leaving the mucky crib!\" Then, addressing Morel in a low voice, he said: \"Now then, look sharp, and we will wait for you below. Make haste, and offer some pretense for our going.\"  \"I thank you,\" said Morel.  \"Very well, it shall be so,\" said Bourdin, in a loud voice, and looking significantly at the artisan; \"in such case, as you promise to pay in a short time, we will leave you for the present, and call again in four or five days; but then you must be punctual.\"  \"Yes, gentlemen, I trust I shall then be able to pay you.\"  The bailiffs left the room; while Hoppy, for fear of being seen, had disappeared down the staircase at the same time the bailiffs quitted the garret.  \"Madame Morel, do you hear?\" said Miss Dimpleton, trying to withdraw the attention of the mother from her melancholy abstraction; \"they will not take away your husband--the two men are gone.\"  \"Mother, don't you hear? they will not take father away,\" said the eldest of the boys.  \"Morel, listen to me,\" murmured Madeleine, in a state of delirium. \"Take one of the large diamonds and sell it--no one will know it, and we shall be saved. Our Adele will no longer feel cold; she will not be dead.\"  Taking advantage of a moment when none belonging to him were observing his actions, the lapidary cautiously left the room. The bailiff was waiting for him upon a sort of little landing, covered also by the roof. Upon this landing, opened the door of a loft, which had formerly been part of the garret occupied by the Morels, and in which Pipelet kept his stock of leather; and the worthy porter called this place his _box at the play_, because, by means of a hole made in the wall between two laths, he was sometimes a witness to the sad scenes that passed in the Morels' room. The bailiff noticed the door of the loft; in a moment he thought that most likely his prisoner had reckoned upon that outlet for escape, or to hide himself.  \"Come, march, old fellow!\" said he, beginning to descend the stair, and making a sign to the lapidary to follow.  \"One minute more, I beseech!\" said Morel; and he fell on his knees upon the floor. Through a chink in the door, he threw a last look upon his family, and clasping his hands, he uttered, in a low, heart-rending voice, while tears flowed down his haggard cheeks: \"Farewell, my dear children--my poor wife! may heaven preserve you all! Farewell!\"  \"Make haste and cut that sermon,\" said Bourdin, brutally, \"Malicorne is quite right; you needn't make so much fuss about leaving the stinking kennel. What a hole! what a hole!\"  Morel rose to follow the bailiff, when the words \"Father! father!\" sounded on the staircase.  \"Louise!\" exclaimed the lapidary, raising his hands toward heaven; \"I can then clasp you to my breast before I go!\"  \"I thank thee, God, I am in time!\" said the voice, approaching nearer and nearer, and light steps were heard rapidly ascending the stairs.  \"Be calm, my dear,\" said a third voice, sharp, asthmatic, and out of breath, coming from a lower part of the house;  \"I will lay in wait, if I must, in the alley, with my broom and my old darling, and they sha'n't leave here till you have spoken to them, the contemptible beggars!\"  The reader has doubtless recognized Mrs. Pipelet, who, less nimble than Louise, followed her slowly. An instant after, the lapidary's daughter was in her father's arms.  \"It is indeed you, Louise, my darling Louise!\" said Morel, crying; \"but how pale you are! For mercy's sake what ails you?\"  \"Nothing, nothing, father,\" stammered Louise. \"I have run so fast. Here is the money!\"  \"How is this?\"  \"You are free!\"  \"So you know?\"  \"Yes, yes! Here, sir, take the money,\" said the young girl, giving a rouleau of gold to Malicorne.  \"But this money, Louise--this money?\"  \"You shall know all presently; don't be uneasy. Come and comfort dear mother.\"  \"No, not now!\" exclaimed Morel, placing himself before the door, remembering that Louise was still in ignorance of the death of the little girl; \"wait, I must speak to you. Now, about this money?\"  \"Stay!\" said Malicorne, as he finished counting the gold, and while putting it in his pocket; \"sixty-four, sixty-five--that will just make thirteen hundred francs. Have you no more than that, my little dear?\"  \"Why, you only owe thirteen hundred francs?\" said Louise, addressing her father, with a stupefied air.  \"Yes,\" said the lapidary.  \"Stop!\" rejoined the catchpole; \"the bill is for thirteen hundred francs. Well, the bill is paid; but the expenses? Without the execution, they are already eleven hundred and forty francs.\" [Footnote: We append some curious facts about imprisonment for debt, taken from \"_Le Pauvre Jacques_,\" a paper published by the Society of Christian Morality Prison Committee:--  \"A protest and a warrant is legally set down as at 4 francs 35 centimes for the first, and 4 francs 70 centimes for the other, but is generally increased by the warrant-officers to 10fr. 40c., and 16fr. 40c. respectively. Thus 26fr. 80c. illegally obtained for what should have been but 9fr. 50c. The law sets down bailiff fees thus:--Stamp and registry, 3fr. 50c.; hackney-coach, 5fr.; arresting and imprisonment, 60fr. 25c.; turnkey's fee, 8fr. Total 76fr. 75c. One bill of charges taken as the average of those sent in by sheriffs' officers, swells the above to 240 francs!\"  In the same paper is this paragraph:--  \"M---, bailiff, has written to desire correction of the article on the Hanged Woman. He did not kill her, he says. We did not say that he did _kill_ that unfortunate woman. We reprint that article:--  \"M---, bailiff, having writ out for a cabinet-maker in the Rue de la Lune, was seen by the latter from the house windows. He called out to his wife.--'I am lost, for there they come to arrest me!' His wife heard this, and fastened the door, while her husband hid him self in the loft. The bailiff called in a locksmith. The wife's room door was forced, and they found the woman had hanged herself! The sight of the corpse did not delay or prevent the officer hunting for the husband. 'I arrest you.' 'I have no money.' 'To prison, then.' 'Very well, let me give my wife good-bye.' 'That be hanged, like she is herself. She's dead.' What can you complain of, M---? we only print your own words, which minutely and blackly paint this frightful picture.\"  This same paper quotes three or four hundred facts, of which the following is a fair sample:--  \"On collection of a 300 franc debt a warrant-officer charged 964 francs! The debtor, a workman with five children, lay seven months in prison.\"  For two reasons, the present writer quotes from \"_Le Pauvre Jacques_,\" firstly, to show that the chapter just read falls below reality; and again, to prove that, if merely in a philanthropic point of view, the maintenance of such a state of things (the exorbitance of extras, illegally extorted by public servants,) often paralyzes the most generous intentions. For instance, with 1,000 francs there might be three or four honest though unfortunate workmen restored to their families from a prison whither petty debts of 250 or 500 francs had driven them; but these sums being tripled by a shameful exaggeration of costs, the most charitable persons often recoil from doing a good deed at the thought of two-thirds of their bounty merely going to sheriffs and their officers. And yet, there are few hardships more worthy of relief than those befalling such unfortunate people as we speak of.]  \"Gracious heaven!\" cried Louise; \"I thought it was only thirteen hundred francs in all! But, sir, we will very soon pay you the remainder; this is a pretty good sum on account--is it not, father?\"  \"Soon!--very well; bring the money to the office, and we will then let your father go. Come, let's be off.\"  \"You will take him away?\"  \"At once. This is on account. When the rest is paid, he will be free. Go on, Bourdin; let us get out of this.\"  \"Mercy! mercy!\" shrieked Louise.  \"Oh, what a row! here it is--the old game over again: it is enough to make one sweat in the depth of winter--on my honor!\" said the bailiff, in a brutal tone. Then advancing toward Morel, he continued: \"If you don't come along at once, I will take you by the collar, and bundle you down. This wind-up is beastly!\"  \"Oh, poor father! when I had hoped to save you!\" said Louise, overwhelmed.  \"No, no! hope nothing for me! Heaven is not just!\" cried the lapidary, in a voice of deep despair, and stamping his feet with rage.  \"Peace! heaven is just! There is Providence for honest men!\" said a soft, yet manly voice.  The same instant Rudolph appeared at the door of the little recess, from whence he had, unseen, witnessed the greater part of the scenes we have just related. He was very pale, and deeply moved. At this sudden interposition, the bailiffs drew back with surprise; while Morel and his daughter stared at the prince vacantly. Taking from his pocket a small parcel of folded bank notes, Rudolph selected three, and giving them to Malicorne, said to him: \"Here are two thousand five hundred francs; give back to this girl the money you have just received from her.\"  More and more surprised, the bailiff took the notes hesitatingly, examined them very suspiciously, turning them over and over, and finally pocketed them. But as his alarm and surprise began to subside, so did his natural coarseness return, and eying Rudolph from head to foot with an impertinent stare, he exclaimed, \"Your notes are good;"]]]
