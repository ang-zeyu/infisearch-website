He had called for her again, and on the way home learned that neither his Majesty nor the regent had been among the listeners, and he had gone to rest like a knight who has been hurled upon the sand.  The next morning, after mass, Barbara went to the rehearsal, and returned in a very joyous mood with the tidings that the Emperor wished to hear her about noon.  But this time her father wanted to forbid her taking part in the performance, and Wolf had not found it easy to make him understand that this would insult and offend his Majesty.  The dispute was by no means ended when the little Maltese summoned her to the New Scales.  Wolf accompanied her only to the Haidplatz, for he had been called to the Town Hall on business connected with his inheritance; but Barbara learned in the room assigned to the musicians that the noon performance had just been countermanded, and no special reason had been given for the change.  The leader of the orchestra had been accustomed to submit to the sovereign's arrangements as unresistingly as to the will of higher powers, and Barbara also restrained herself.  True, wrath boiled and seethed in her breast, but before retiring she only said briefly, with a seriousness which revealed the contempt concealed beneath:  \"You were quite right, Maestro Appenzelder.  The Emperor considered my voice nothing unusual, and nothing else is fit for the august ears of his Majesty.  Now I will go to the green woods.\"  The leader of the boy choir again did his best to detain her, for what the noon denied the evening would bring, and Gombert aided him with courteous flatteries; but Barbara listened only a short time, then, interrupting both with the exclamation, \"I force myself upon no one, not even the highest!\" she left the room, holding her head haughtily erect.  Appenzelder fixed his eyes helplessly upon the ground.  \"I'd rather put a hoarse sailor or a croaking owl into my choir henceforward than such a trilling fair one, who has more whims in her head than hairs on it.\"  Then he went out to look for Wolf, for he, as well as Gombert, had noticed that he possessed a certain degree of influence over Barbara. What should he say to their Majesties if they ordered the choir for the late meal and missed the voice about which the Oueen had said so many complimentary things in the Emperor's name?  Wolf had told him that he was summoned to the Town Hall.  The maestro followed him, and when he learned there that he had gone to the syndic, Dr. Hiltner, he inquired the way to this gentleman's house.  But the knight was no longer to be found there.  For the third time the busy magistrate was not at home, but he had been informed that the syndic expected him that afternoon, as he wished to discuss a matter of importance.  Dr. Hiltner's wife knew what it was, but silence had been enjoined upon her, and she was a woman who knew how to refrain from speech.  She and her daughter Martina--who during Wolf's absence had grown to maidenhood--were sincerely glad to see him; he had been the favourite schoolmate of her adopted son, Erasmus Eckhart, and a frequent guest in her household.  Yet she only confirmed to the modest young man, who shrank from asking her more minute questions, that the matter concerned an offer whose acceptance promised to make him a prosperous man.  She was expecting her Erasmus home from Wittenberg that evening or early the next morning, and to find Wolf here again would be a welcome boon to him.  What had the syndic in view?  Evidently something good.  Old Ursel should help counsel him.  The doctor liked her, and, in spite of the severe illness, she had kept her clever brain.  He would take Barbara into his confidence, too, for what concerned him concerned her also.  But when he turned from the Haidplatz into Red Cock Street he saw three fine horses in front of the cantor house.  A groom held their bridles. The large chestnut belonged to the servant.  The other two-a big-boned bay and an unusually wellformed Andalusian gray, with a small head and long sweeping tail--had ladies' saddles.  The sister of rich old Peter Schlumperger, who was paying court to Barbara, had dismounted from the former.  She wanted to persuade the young girl, in her brother's name, to join the party to the wood adjoining Prfifening Abbey.  At first she had opposed the marriage between the man of fifty and Barbara; but when she saw that her brother's affection had lasted two years, nay, had increased more and more, and afforded new joy to the childless widower, she had made herself his ally.  She, too, was widowed and had a large fortune of her own.  Her husband, a member of the Kastenmayr family, had made her his heiress.  Blithe young Barbara, whose voice and beauty she knew how to value, could bring new life and brightness into the great, far too silent house.  The girl's poverty was no disadvantage; she and her brother had long found it difficult to know what to do with the vast wealth which, even in these hard times, was constantly increasing, and the Blomberg family was as aristocratic as their own.  The widow's effort to persuade the girl to ride had not been in vain, for Wolf met Frau Kastenmayr on the stairs, and Barbara followed in a plain dark riding habit, which had been her mother's.  So, in spite of Maestro Appenzelder, Miss Self-Will had really determined to leave the city.  Her hasty information that the Emperor did not wish to hear the choir at noon somewhat relieved his mind; but when, in answer to his no less hasty question about the singing at the late meal, the answer came, \"What is that to me?\" he perceived that the sensitiveness which yesterday had almost led her to a similar step had now urged her to an act that might cause Appenzelder great embarrassment, and rob her forever of the honour of singing before their Majesties.  While the very portly Frau Kastenmayr went panting down the narrow stairs, Wolf again stopped Barbara with the question why she so carelessly trifled with what might be the best piece of good fortune in her life, and shook his head doubtfully as, tossing hers higher, with self-important pride she answered low enough not to be heard by the widow, \"Because a ride through the green woods in the month of May is pleasanter than to sing into vacancy at midnight unheeded.\"  Here the high, somewhat shrill voice of Frau Kastenmayr, who felt jealous in her brother's behalf at hearing Barbara whispering with the young knight, interrupted them.  Her warning, \"Where are you, my darling?\" made the girl, with the skirt of her riding habit thrown over her arm, follow her swiftly.  Wolf, offended and anxious, would have liked to make her feel his displeasure, but could not bring himself to let her go unattended, and, with some difficulty, first helped Frau Kastenmayr upon her strong steed, then, with very mingled feelings, aided Barbara to mount the noble Andalusian.  While she placed her little foot in his hand to spring thence with graceful agility into the saddle, the widow, with forced courtesy, invited the young gentleman to accompany her and her brother to Prufening.  There would be a merry meal, which she herself had provided, in the farmhouse on the abbey lands.  Without giving a positive answer, Wolf bowed, and his heart quivered as Barbara, from her beautiful gray horse, waved her riding whip to him as a queen might salute a vassal.  How erect she sat in her saddle! how slender and yet how well rounded her figure was!  What rapture it would be to possess her charms!  That she would accept the elderly Schlumperger for the sake of his money was surely impossible.  And yet!  How could she, with laughing lips, cast to the wind the rare favour of fortune which permitted her to display her art to the Emperor, and so carelessly leave him, Wolf, who had built the bridge to their Majesties, in the lurch, unless she had some special purpose in view; and what could that be except the resolution to become the mistress of one of the richest houses in Ratisbon?  The words \"My darling,\" which Frau Kastenmayr had called to Barbara, again rang in his ears, and when the two ladies and the groom had vanished, he returned in a very thoughtful mood to the faithful old maid-servant.  Every one else who was in the street or at the window looked after Barbara, and pointed out to others the beautiful Jungfrau Blomberg and the proud security with which she governed the spirited gray.  She had become a good rider, first upon her father's horses, and then at the Wollers in the country, and took risks which many a bold young noble would not have imitated.  Her aged suitor's gray Andalusian was dearer than the man himself, whom she regarded merely as a sheet-anchor which could be used if everything else failed.  The thought of what might happen when, after these days of working for her bread ended, still more terrible ones followed, had troubled her again and again the day before.  Now she no longer recollected these miserable things.  What a proud feeling it was to ride on horseback through the sweet May air, in the green woods, as her own mistress, and bid defiance to the ungrateful sovereign in the Golden Cross!  The frustration of the hope that her singing would make the Emperor desire to hear her again and again had wounded her to the depths of her soul and spoiled her night's rest.  The annoyance of having vainly put forth her best efforts to please him had become unendurable after the fresh refusal which, as it were, set the seal upon her fears, and in the defiant flight to the forest she seemed to have found the right antidote. As she approached the monarch's residence, she felt glad and proud that he, who could force half the world to obey him, could not rule her.  To attract his notice by another performance would have been the most natural course, but Barbara had placed herself in a singular relation toward the Emperor Charles.  To her he was the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5563"],["title","Barbara Blomberg â€” Volume 03 (#2)"],["body","n, not the Emperor, and that he did not express a desire to hear her again seemed like an insult which the man offered to the woman, the artist, who was ready to obey his sign.  Her perverse spirit had rebelled against such lack of appreciation of her most precious gifts, and filled her with rankling hatred against the first person who had closed his heart to the victorious magic of her voice.  When she refused Appenzelder her aid in case the Emperor Charles desired to hear the choir that evening, and promised Frau Kastenmayr to accompany her to Prufening, she had been like a rebellious child filled with the desire to show the man who cared nothing for her that, against her will, he could not hear even a single note from her lips.  They were to meet the other members of the party at St. Oswald's Church on the Danube, so they were obliged to pass the Golden Cross.  This suited Barbara and, with triumphant selfconfidence, in which mingled a slight shade of defiance, she looked up to the Emperor's windows.  She did not see him, it is true, but she made him a mute speech which ran: \"When, foolish sovereign, who did not even think it worth while to grant me a single look, you hear the singing again to-night, and miss the voice which, I know full well, penetrated your heart, you will learn its value, and long for it as ardently as I desired your summons.\"  Here her cheeks glowed so hotly that Frau Kastenmayr noticed it, and with maternal solicitude asked, from her heavy, steady bay horse:  \"Is the gray too gay for you, my darling?\"     CHAPTER XIII.  Shortly after sunset Appenzelder received the order to have the boy choir sing before the Emperor.  During the noon hour, which the monarch had spent alone, thoughts so sad, bordering upon melancholy, had visited him, although for several hours he had been free from pain, that he relinquished his resentful intention of showing his undutiful sister how little he cared for her surprise and how slight was his desire to enjoy music.  In fact, he, too, regarded it as medicine, and hoped especially for a favourable effect from the exquisite soprano voice in the motet \"Tu pulchra es.\"  He still had some things to look over with Granvelle, but the orchestra and the boy choir must be ready by ten o'clock.  Would it not have been foolish to bear this intolerable, alarming mood until the midnight meal?  It must be dispelled, for he himself perceived how groundless it was.  The pain had passed away, the despatches contained no bad news, and Dr. Mathys had permitted him to go out the next day.  When Adrian already had his hand on the door knob, he called after him, \"And Appenzelder must see that the exquisite new voice--he knows--is heard.\"  Soon after, when Granvelle had just left him, the steward, Malfalconnet, entered, and, in spite of the late hour--the Nuremberg clock on the writing table had struck nine some time before--asked an audience for Sir Wolf Hartschwert, one of her Highness the regent's household, to whom she committed the most noiseless and the most noisy affairs, namely, the secret correspondence and the music.  \"The German?\" asked Charles, and as the baron, with a low bow, assented, the Emperor continued: \"Then it is scarcely an intrigue, at any rate a successful one, unless he is unlike the usual stamp.  But no!  I noticed the man.  There is something visionary about him, like most of the Germans.  But I have never seen him intoxicated.\"  \"Although he is of knightly lineage, and, as I heard, at home in the neighbourhood of the Main, where good wine matures,\" remarked Malfalconnet, with another bow.  \"At this moment he looks more than sober, rather as though some great fright had roused him from a carouse. Poor knight!\"  \"Ay, poor knight!\" the Emperor assented emphatically.  \"To serve my sister of Hungary in one position may be difficult for a man who is no sportsman, and now in two!  God's death!  These torments on earth will shorten his stay in purgatory.\"  The Emperor Charles had spoken of his sister in a very different tone the day before, but now she remained away from him and kept with her a friend whom he greatly needed, so he repaid her for it.  Therefore, with a shrug of the shoulders expressive of regret, he added, \"However badly off we may be ourselves, there is always some one with whom we would not change places.\"  \"Were I, the humblest of the humble, lucky enough to be in your Majesty's skin,\" cried the baron gaily, \"I wouldn't either.  But since I am only poor Malfalconnet, I know of nobody--and I'm well acquainted with Sir Wolf--who seems to me more enviable than your Majesty.\"  \"Jest, or earnest?\" asked the Emperor.  \"Earnest, deep, well-founded earnest,\" replied the other with an upward glance whose solemn devotion showed the sovereign that mischief was concealed behind it.  \"Let your Majesty judge for yourself.  He is a knight of good family, and looks like a plain burgher.  His name is Wolf Hartschwert, and he is as gentle as a lamb and as pliant as a young willow.  He appears like the meek, whom our Lord calls blessed, and yet he is one of the wisest of the wise, and, moreover, a master in his art. Wherever he shows himself, delusion follows delusion, and every one redounds to his advantage, for whoever took him for an insignificant man must doff his hat when he utters his name.  If a shrewd fellow supposed that this sheep would not know A from B, he'll soon give him nuts to crack which are far too hard for many a learned master of arts.  Nobody expects chivalric virtues and the accompanying expenditure from this simple fellow; yet he practises them, and, when he once opens his hand, people stare at him as they do at flying fish and the hen that lays a golden egg.  Appreciative surprise gazes at him, beseeching forgiveness, wherever he is known, as surely as happy faces welcome your Majesty's entry into any Netherland city.  Fortune, lavish when she once departs from her wonted niggardliness, guards this her favourite child from disappointment and misconstruction.\"  \"The blessing of those who are more than they seem,\" replied the Emperor.  \"That is his also,\" sighed Malfalconnet.  \"That man, your Majesty, and I the poorest of the poor!  I was born a baron, and, as the greatest piece of good fortune, obtained the favour of my illustrious master.  Now everybody expects from me magnificence worthy of my ancient name, and a style of living in keeping with the much-envied grace that renders me happy.  But if your Majesty's divine goodness did not sometimes pay my debts, which are now a part of me as the tail belongs to the comet--\"  \"Oho!\" cried the Emperor here.  \"If that is what is coming--\"  \"Do I look so stupid,\" interrupted the baron humbly, \"as to repeat to-day things which yesterday did not wholly fail to make an impression upon your Majesty?\"  \"They would find deaf cars,\" Charles replied.  \"You are certainly less destitute of brains than of money, because you lack system.  One proceeds in a contrary direction from the other.  Besides, your ancient name, though worthy of all honour, does not inspire the most favourable impression.  Malfalconnet!  Mal is evil, and falconnet--or is it falconnelle?--is a cruel, greedy bird of prey.  So whoever encounters no evil from you, whoever escapes you unplucked, also enjoys a pleasant surprise.  As for not being plucked, I, at least, unfortunately have not experienced this.  But we will not cloud by too long waiting the good fortune of the gentleman outside who was born under such lucky stars. What brings the Wolf in sheep's clothing to us?\"  \"One would almost suppose,\" replied the baron with a crafty smile, \"that he was coming to-day on a useless errand, and meant to apply to your Majesty for the payment of his debts.\"  Here the Emperor interrupted him with an angry gesture; but Malfalconnet went on soothingly: \"However, there is nothing to be feared from lambs in sheep's clothing.  Just think, your Majesty, how warm they must be in their double dress!  No; he comes from the musicians, and apparently brings an important message.\"  \"Admit him, then,\" the Emperor commanded.  A few minutes later Wolf stood before the sovereign, and, in Appenzelder's name, informed him in a tone of sincere regret, yet with a certain degree of reserve, that the performance of the choir boys that day would leave much to be desired, for two of the best singers had not yet recovered.  \"But the substitute, the admirable substitute?\"  Charles impatiently interrupted.  \"That is just what troubles us,\" Wolf replied uneasily.  \"The magnificent new voice wishes to desert the maestro to-night.\"  \"Desert?\"  cried the Emperor angrily.  \"A choir boy in the service of her Majesty the Queen of Hungary!  So there is still something new under the sun.\"  \"Certainly,\" replied Wolf with a low bow, still striving, in obedience to the regent's strict command, not to reveal the sex of the new member of the choir.  \"And this case is especially unusual.  This voice is not in her Majesty's service.  It belongs to a volunteer, as it were, a native of this city, whose wonderful instrument and rare ability we discovered. But, begging your Majesty's pardon, the soul of such an artist is a strange thing, inflammable and enthusiastic, but just as easily wounded and disheartened.\"  \"The soul of a boy!\" cried Charles contemptuously.  \"Appenzelder does not look like a man who would permit such whims.\"  \"Not in his choir, certainly,\" said the young nobleman.  \"But this voice --allow me to repeat it--is not at his disposal.  It was no easy matter to obtain it at all, and, keenly as the maestro disapproves of the caprices of this beautiful power, he can not force it--the power, I mean --to the obedience which his boys----\"  Here the Emperor laughed shrilly.  \"The power, the voice!  The songstress, you should say.  This whimsical volunteer with the voice of an angel, who is so tenderly treated by rough Appenzelder, is a woman, not a refractory choir boy.  How"]]]
