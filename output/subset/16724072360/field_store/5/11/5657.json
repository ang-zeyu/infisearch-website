Mobile was important to the enemy, and in the absence of a threatening force was guarded by little else than artillery.  If threatened by land and from the water at the same time the prize would fall easily, or troops would have to be sent to its defence.  Those troops would necessarily come from Bragg.  My judgment was overruled, and the troops under my command were dissipated over other parts of the country where it was thought they could render the most service.  Soon it was discovered in Washington that Rosecrans was in trouble and required assistance.  The emergency was now too immediate to allow us to give this assistance by making an attack in rear of Bragg upon Mobile. It was therefore necessary to reinforce directly, and troops were sent from every available point.  Rosecrans had very skilfully manoeuvred Bragg south of the Tennessee River, and through and beyond Chattanooga. If he had stopped and intrenched, and made himself strong there, all would have been right and the mistake of not moving earlier partially compensated.  But he pushed on, with his forces very much scattered, until Bragg's troops from Mississippi began to join him.  Then Bragg took the initiative. Rosecrans had to fall back in turn, and was able to get his army together at Chickamauga, some miles south-east of Chattanooga, before the main battle was brought on.  The battle was fought on the 19th and 20th of September, and Rosecrans was badly defeated, with a heavy loss in artillery and some sixteen thousand men killed, wounded and captured. The corps under Major-General George H. Thomas stood its ground, while Rosecrans, with Crittenden and McCook, returned to Chattanooga. Thomas returned also, but later, and with his troops in good order.  Bragg followed and took possession of Missionary Ridge, overlooking Chattanooga. He also occupied Lookout Mountain, west of the town, which Rosecrans had abandoned, and with it his control of the river and the river road as far back as Bridgeport.  The National troops were now strongly intrenched in Chattanooga Valley, with the Tennessee River behind them and the enemy occupying commanding heights to the east and west, with a strong line across the valley from mountain to mountain, and with Chattanooga Creek, for a large part of the way, in front of their line.  On the 29th Halleck telegraphed me the above results, and directed all the forces that could be spared from my department to be sent to Rosecrans.  Long before this dispatch was received Sherman was on his way, and McPherson was moving east with most of the garrison of Vicksburg.  A retreat at that time would have been a terrible disaster.  It would not only have been the loss of a most important strategic position to us, but it would have been attended with the loss of all the artillery still left with the Army of the Cumberland and the annihilation of that army itself, either by capture or demoralization.  All supplies for Rosecrans had to be brought from Nashville. The railroad between this base and the army was in possession of the government up to Bridgeport, the point at which the road crosses to the south side of the Tennessee River; but Bragg, holding Lookout and Raccoon mountains west of Chattanooga, commanded the railroad, the river and the shortest and best wagon-roads, both south and north of the Tennessee, between Chattanooga and Bridgeport.  The distance between these two places is but twenty-six miles by rail, but owing to the position of Bragg, all supplies for Rosecrans had to be hauled by a circuitous route north of the river and over a mountainous country, increasing the distance to over sixty miles.  This country afforded but little food for his animals, nearly ten thousand of which had already starved, and not enough were left to draw a single piece of artillery or even the ambulances to convey the sick. The men had been on half rations of hard bread for a considerable time, with but few other supplies except beef driven from Nashville across the country.  The region along the road became so exhausted of food for the cattle that by the time they reached Chattanooga they were much in the condition of the few animals left alive there--\"on the lift.\" Indeed, the beef was so poor that the soldiers were in the habit of saying, with a faint facetiousness, that they were living on \"half rations of hard bread and BEEF DRIED ON THE HOOF.\"  Nothing could be transported but food, and the troops were without sufficient shoes or other clothing suitable for the advancing season. What they had was well worn.  The fuel within the Federal lines was exhausted, even to the stumps of trees. There were no teams to draw it from the opposite bank, where it was abundant.  The only way of supplying fuel, for some time before my arrival, had been to cut trees on the north bank of the river at a considerable distance up the stream, form rafts of it and float it down with the current, effecting a landing on the south side within our lines by the use of paddles or poles. It would then be carried on the shoulders of the men to their camps.  If a retreat had occurred at this time it is not probable that any of the army would have reached the railroad as an organized body, if followed by the enemy.  On the receipt of Mr. Dana's dispatch Mr. Stanton sent for me. Finding that I was out he became nervous and excited, inquiring of every person he met, including guests of the house, whether they knew where I was, and bidding them find me and send me to him at once.  About eleven o'clock I returned to the hotel, and on my way, when near the house, every person met was a messenger from the Secretary, apparently partaking of his impatience to see me.  I hastened to the room of the Secretary and found him pacing the floor rapidly in his dressing-gown. Saying that the retreat must be prevented, he showed me the dispatch.  I immediately wrote an order assuming command of the Military Division of the Mississippi, and telegraphed it to General Rosecrans.  I then telegraphed to him the order from Washington assigning Thomas to the command of the Army of the Cumberland; and to Thomas that he must hold Chattanooga at all hazards, informing him at the same time that I would be at the front as soon as possible.  A prompt reply was received from Thomas, saying, \"We will hold the town till we starve.\"  I appreciated the force of this dispatch later when I witnessed the condition of affairs which prompted it.  It looked, indeed, as if but two courses were open:  one to starve, the other to surrender or be captured.  On the morning of the 20th of October I started, with my staff, and proceeded as far as Nashville.  At that time it was not prudent to travel beyond that point by night, so I remained in Nashville until the next morning.  Here I met for the first time Andrew Johnson, Military Governor of Tennessee.  He delivered a speech of welcome.  His composure showed that it was by no means his maiden effort.  It was long, and I was in torture while he was delivering it, fearing something would be expected from me in response.  I was relieved, however, the people assembled having apparently heard enough.  At all events they commenced a general hand-shaking, which, although trying where there is so much of it, was a great relief to me in this emergency.  From Nashville I telegraphed to Burnside, who was then at Knoxville, that important points in his department ought to be fortified, so that they could be held with the least number of men; to Admiral Porter at Cairo, that Sherman's advance had passed Eastport, Mississippi, that rations were probably on their way from St. Louis by boat for supplying his army, and requesting him to send a gunboat to convoy them; and to Thomas, suggesting that large parties should be put at work on the wagon-road then in use back to Bridgeport.  On the morning of the 21st we took the train for the front, reaching Stevenson Alabama, after dark.  Rosecrans was there on his way north. He came into my car and we held a brief interview, in which he described very clearly the situation at Chattanooga, and made some excellent suggestions as to what should be done.  My only wonder was that he had not carried them out.  We then proceeded to Bridgeport, where we stopped for the night.  From here we took horses and made our way by Jasper and over Waldron's Ridge to Chattanooga. There had been much rain, and the roads were almost impassable from mud, knee-deep in places, and from wash-outs on the mountain sides.  I had been on crutches since the time of my fall in New Orleans, and had to be carried over places where it was not safe to cross on horseback.  The roads were strewn with the debris of broken wagons and the carcasses of thousands of starved mules and horses.  At Jasper, some ten or twelve miles from Bridgeport, there was a halt.  General O. O. Howard had his headquarters there.  From this point I telegraphed Burnside to make every effort to secure five hundred rounds of ammunition for his artillery and small-arms.  We stopped for the night at a little hamlet some ten or twelve miles farther on.  The next day we reached Chattanooga a little before dark.  I went directly to General Thomas's headquarters, and remaining there a few days, until I could establish my own.  During the evening most of the general officers called in to pay their respects and to talk about the condition of affairs.  They pointed out on the map the line, marked with a red or blue pencil, which Rosecrans had contemplated falling back upon.  If any of them had approved the move they did not say so to me.  I found General W. F. Smith occupying the position of chief engineer of the Army of the Cumberland.  I had known Smith as a cadet at West Point, but had "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5863"],["title","Personal Memoirs of U. S. Grant, Part 4. (#2)"],["body","recollection of having met him after my graduation, in 1843, up to this time.  He explained the situation of the two armies and the topography of the country so plainly that I could see it without an inspection.  I found that he had established a saw-mill on the banks of the river, by utilizing an old engine found in the neighborhood; and, by rafting logs from the north side of the river above, had got out the lumber and completed pontoons and roadway plank for a second bridge, one flying bridge being there already.  He was also rapidly getting out the materials and constructing the boats for a third bridge.  In addition to this he had far under way a steamer for plying between Chattanooga and Bridgeport whenever we might get possession of the river.  This boat consisted of a scow, made of the plank sawed out at the mill, housed in, and a stern wheel attached which was propelled by a second engine taken from some shop or factory.  I telegraphed to Washington this night, notifying General Halleck of my arrival, and asking to have General Sherman assigned to the command of the Army of the Tennessee, headquarters in the field.  The request was at once complied with.    CHAPTER XLI.  ASSUMING THE COMMAND AT CHATTANOOGA--OPENING A LINE OF SUPPLIES--BATTLE OF WAUHATCHIE--ON THE PICKET LINE.  The next day, the 24th, I started out to make a personal inspection, taking Thomas and Smith with me, besides most of the members of my personal staff.  We crossed to the north side of the river, and, moving to the north of detached spurs of hills, reached the Tennessee at Brown's Ferry, some three miles below Lookout Mountain, unobserved by the enemy.  Here we left our horses back from the river and approached the water on foot. There was a picket station of the enemy on the opposite side, of about twenty men, in full view, and we were within easy range. They did not fire upon us nor seem to be disturbed by our presence.  They must have seen that we were all commissioned officers. But, I suppose, they looked upon the garrison of Chattanooga as prisoners of war, feeding or starving themselves, and thought it would be inhuman to kill any of them except in self-defence.  That night I issued orders for opening the route to Bridgeport--a cracker line, as the soldiers appropriately termed it.  They had been so long on short rations that my first thought was the establishment of a line over which food might reach them.  Chattanooga is on the south bank of the Tennessee, where that river runs nearly due west.  It is at the northern end of a valley five or six miles in width, through which Chattanooga Creek runs.  To the east of the valley is Missionary Ridge, rising from five to eight hundred feet above the creek and terminating somewhat abruptly a half mile or more before reaching the Tennessee.  On the west of the valley is Lookout Mountain, twenty-two hundred feet above-tide water.  Just below the town the Tennessee makes a turn to the south and runs to the base of Lookout Mountain, leaving no level ground between the mountain and river.  The Memphis and Charleston Railroad passes this point, where the mountain stands nearly perpendicular. East of Missionary Ridge flows the South Chickamauga River; west of Lookout Mountain is Lookout Creek; and west of that, Raccoon Mountains.  Lookout Mountain, at its northern end, rises almost perpendicularly for some distance, then breaks off in a gentle slope of cultivated fields to near the summit, where it ends in a palisade thirty or more feet in height.  On the gently sloping ground, between the upper and lower palisades, there is a single farmhouse, which is reached by a wagon-road from the valley east.  The intrenched line of the enemy commenced on the north end of Missionary Ridge and extended along the crest for some distance south, thence across Chattanooga valley to Lookout Mountain. Lookout Mountain was also fortified and held by the enemy, who also kept troops in Lookout valley west, and on Raccoon Mountain, with pickets extending down the river so as to command the road on the north bank and render it useless to us.  In addition to this there was an intrenched line in Chattanooga valley extending from the river east of the town to Lookout Mountain, to make the investment complete.  Besides the fortifications on Mission Ridge, there was a line at the base of the hill, with occasional spurs of rifle-pits half-way up the front.  The enemy's pickets extended out into the valley towards the town, so far that the pickets of the two armies could converse.  At one point they were separated only by the narrow creek which gives its name to the valley and town, and from which both sides drew water.  The Union lines were shorter than those of the enemy.  Thus the enemy, with a vastly superior force, was strongly fortified to the east, south, and west, and commanded the river below.  Practically, the Army of the Cumberland was besieged. The enemy had stopped with his cavalry north of the river the passing of a train loaded with ammunition and medical supplies.  The Union army was short of both, not having ammunition enough for a day's fighting.  General Halleck had, long before my coming into this new field, ordered parts of the 11th and 12th corps, commanded respectively by Generals Howard and Slocum, Hooker in command of the whole, from the Army of the Potomac to reinforce Rosecrans.  It would have been folly to send them to Chattanooga to help eat up the few rations left there.  They were consequently left on the railroad, where supplies could be brought to them.  Before my arrival, Thomas ordered their concentration at Bridgeport.  General W. F. Smith had been so instrumental in preparing for the move which I was now about to make, and so clear in his judgment about the manner of making it, that I deemed it but just to him that he should have command of the troops detailed to execute the design, although he was then acting as a staff officer and was not in command of troops.  On the 24th of October, after my return to Chattanooga, the following details were made:  General Hooker, who was now at Bridgeport, was ordered to cross to the south side of the Tennessee and march up by Whitesides and Wauhatchie to Brown's Ferry.  General Palmer, with a division of the 14th corps, Army of the Cumberland, was ordered to move down the river on the north side, by a back road, until opposite Whitesides, then cross and hold the road in Hooker's rear after he had passed. Four thousand men were at the same time detailed to act under General Smith directly from Chattanooga. Eighteen hundred of them, under General Hazen, were to take sixty pontoon boats, and under cover of night float by the pickets of the enemy at the north base of Lookout, down to Brown's Ferry, then land on the south side and capture or drive away the pickets at that point.  Smith was to march with the remainder of the detail, also under cover of night, by the north bank of the river to Brown's Ferry, taking with him all the material for laying the bridge as soon as the crossing was secured.  On the 26th, Hooker crossed the river at Bridgeport and commenced his eastward march.  At three o'clock on the morning of the 27th, Hazen moved into the stream with his sixty pontoons and eighteen hundred brave and well-equipped men.  Smith started enough in advance to be near the river when Hazen should arrive.  There are a number of detached spurs of hills north of the river at Chattanooga, back of which is a good road parallel to the stream, sheltered from the view from the top of Lookout. It was over this road Smith marched.  At five o'clock Hazen landed at Brown's Ferry, surprised the picket guard, and captured most of it.  By seven o'clock the whole of Smith's force was ferried over and in possession of a height commanding the ferry.  This was speedily fortified, while a detail was laying the pontoon bridge.  By ten o'clock the bridge was laid, and our extreme right, now in Lookout valley, was fortified and connected with the rest of the army.  The two bridges over the Tennessee River--a flying one at Chattanooga and the new one at Brown's Ferry--with the road north of the river, covered from both the fire and the view of the enemy, made the connection complete.  Hooker found but slight obstacles in his way, and on the afternoon of the 28th emerged into Lookout valley at Wauhatchie.  Howard marched on to Brown's Ferry, while Geary, who commanded a division in the 12th corps, stopped three miles south.  The pickets of the enemy on the river below were now cut off, and soon came in and surrendered.  The river was now opened to us from Lookout valley to Bridgeport. Between Brown's Ferry and Kelly's Ferry the Tennessee runs through a narrow gorge in the mountains, which contracts the stream so much as to increase the current beyond the capacity of an ordinary steamer to stem it.  To get up these rapids, steamers must be cordelled; that is, pulled up by ropes from the shore.  But there is no difficulty in navigating the stream from Bridgeport to Kelly's Ferry.  The latter point is only eight miles from Chattanooga and connected with it by a good wagon-road, which runs through a low pass in the Raccoon Mountains on the south side of the river to Brown's Ferry, thence on the north side to the river opposite Chattanooga. There were several steamers at Bridgeport, and abundance of forage, clothing and provisions.  On the way to Chattanooga I had telegraphed back to Nashville for a good supply of vegetables and small rations, which the troops had been so long deprived of.  Hooker had brought with him from the east a full supply of land transportation.  His animals had not been subjected to hard work on bad roads without forage, but were in good condition.  In five days from my arrival in Chattanooga the way was open to Bridgeport and, with the aid of steamers and Hooker's teams, in a week the troops were receiving full rations.  It is hard for any one "]]]
