'What were you afraid of, nursie?' asked the princess.  'Never mind,' she answered.  'Perhaps I will tell you another day. Now tell me where you have been.'  'I've been up a long way to see my very great, huge, old grandmother,' said the princess.  'What do you mean by that?' asked the nurse, who thought she was making fun.  'I mean that I've been a long way up and up to see My GREAT grandmother.  Ah, nursie, you don't know what a beautiful mother of grandmothers I've got upstairs.  She is such an old lady, with such lovely white hair--as white as my silver cup.  Now, when I think of it, I think her hair must be silver.'  'What nonsense you are talking, princess!' said the nurse.  'I'm not talking nonsense,' returned Irene, rather offended.  'I will tell you all about her.  She's much taller than you, and much prettier.'  'Oh, I dare say!' remarked the nurse.  'And she lives upon pigeons' eggs.'  'Most likely,' said the nurse.  'And she sits in an empty room, spin-spinning all day long.'  'Not a doubt of it,' said the nurse.  'And she keeps her crown in her bedroom.'  'Of course--quite the proper place to keep her crown in.  She wears it in bed, I'll be bound.'  'She didn't say that.  And I don't think she does.  That wouldn't be comfortable--would it?  I don't think my papa wears his crown for a night-cap.  Does he, nursie?'  'I never asked him.  I dare say he does.'  'And she's been there ever since I came here--ever so many years.'  'Anybody could have told you that,' said the nurse, who did not believe a word Irene was saying.  'Why didn't you tell me, then?'  'There was no necessity.  You could make it all up for yourself.'  'You don't believe me, then!' exclaimed the princess, astonished and angry, as she well might be.  'Did you expect me to believe you, princess?' asked the nurse coldly. 'I know princesses are in the habit of telling make-believes, but you are the first I ever heard of who expected to have them believed,' she added, seeing that the child was strangely in earnest.  The princess burst into tears.  'Well, I must say,' remarked the nurse, now thoroughly vexed with her for crying, 'it is not at all becoming in a princess to tell stories and expect to be believed just because she is a princess.'  'But it's quite true, I tell you.'  'You've dreamt it, then, child.'  'No, I didn't dream it.  I went upstairs, and I lost myself, and if I hadn't found the beautiful lady, I should never have found myself.'  'Oh, I dare say!'  'Well, you just come up with me, and see if I'm not telling the truth.'  'Indeed I have other work to do.  It's your dinnertime, and I won't have any more such nonsense.'  The princess wiped her eyes, and her face grew so hot that they were soon quite dry.  She sat down to her dinner, but ate next to nothing. Not to be believed does not at all agree with princesses: for a real princess cannot tell a lie.  So all the afternoon she did not speak a word.  Only when the nurse spoke to her, she answered her, for a real princess is never rude--even when she does well to be offended.  Of course the nurse was not comfortable in her mind--not that she suspected the least truth in Irene's story, but that she loved her dearly, and was vexed with herself for having been cross to her. She thought her crossness was the cause of the princess's unhappiness, and had no idea that she was really and deeply hurt at not being believed. But, as it became more and more plain during the evening in her every motion and look, that, although she tried to amuse herself with her toys, her heart was too vexed and troubled to enjoy them, her nurse's discomfort grew and grew.  When bedtime came, she undressed and laid her down, but the child, instead of holding up her little mouth to be kissed, turned away from her and lay still.  Then nursie's heart gave way altogether, and she began to cry.  At the sound of her first sob the princess turned again, and held her face to kiss her as usual.  But the nurse had her handkerchief to her eyes, and did not see the movement.  'Nursie,' said the princess, 'why won't you believe me?'  'Because I can't believe you,' said the nurse, getting angry again.  'Ah! then, you can't help it,' said Irene, 'and I will not be vexed with you any more.  I will give you a kiss and go to sleep.'  'You little angel!' cried the nurse, and caught her out of bed, and walked about the room with her in her arms, kissing and hugging her.  'You will let me take you to see my dear old great big grandmother, won't you?' said the princess, as she laid her down again.  'And you won't say I'm ugly, any more--will you, princess?' 'Nursie, I never said you were ugly.  What can you mean?'  'Well, if you didn't say it, you meant it.'  'Indeed, I never did.'  'You said I wasn't so pretty as that--'  'As my beautiful grandmother--yes, I did say that; and I say it again, for it's quite true.'  'Then I do think you are unkind!' said the nurse, and put her handkerchief to her eyes again.  'Nursie, dear, everybody can't be as beautiful as every other body, you know.  You are very nice-looking, but if you had been as beautiful as my grandmother--'  'Bother your grandmother!' said the nurse.  'Nurse, that's very rude.  You are not fit to be spoken to till you can behave better.'  The princess turned away once more, and again the nurse was ashamed of herself.  'I'm sure I beg your pardon, princess,' she said, though still in an offended tone.  But the princess let the tone pass, and heeded only the words.  'You won't say it again, I am sure,' she answered, once more turning towards her nurse.  'I was only going to say that if you had been twice as nice-looking as you are, some king or other would have married you, and then what would have become of me?'  'You are an angel!' repeated the nurse, again embracing her. 'Now,' insisted Irene, 'you will come and see my grandmother--won't you?'  'I will go with you anywhere you like, my cherub,' she answered; and in two minutes the weary little princess was fast asleep.    CHAPTER 5  The Princess Lets Well Alone  When she woke the next morning, the first thing she heard was the rain still falling.  Indeed, this day was so like the last that it would have been difficult to tell where was the use of It.  The first thing she thought of, however, was not the rain, but the lady in the tower; and the first question that occupied her thoughts was whether she should not ask the nurse to fulfil her promise this very morning, and go with her to find her grandmother as soon as she had had her breakfast.  But she came to the conclusion that perhaps the lady would not be pleased if she took anyone to see her without first asking leave; especially as it was pretty evident, seeing she lived on pigeons' eggs, and cooked them herself, that she did not want the household to know she was there.  So the princess resolved to take the first opportunity of running up alone and asking whether she might bring her nurse.  She believed the fact that she could not otherwise convince her she was telling the truth would have much weight with her grandmother.  The princess and her nurse were the best of friends all dressing-time, and the princess in consequence ate an enormous little breakfast.  'I wonder, Lootie'--that was her pet name for her nurse--'what pigeons' eggs taste like?' she said, as she was eating her egg--not quite a common one, for they always picked out the pinky ones for her.  'We'll get you a pigeon's egg, and you shall judge for yourself,' said the nurse.  'Oh, no, no!' returned Irene, suddenly reflecting they might disturb the old lady in getting it, and that even if they did not, she would have one less in consequence.  'What a strange creature you are,' said the nurse--'first to want a thing and then to refuse it!'  But she did not say it crossly, and the princess never minded any remarks that were not unfriendly.  'Well, you see, Lootie, there are reasons,' she returned, and said no more, for she did not want to bring up the subject of their former strife, lest her nurse should offer to go before she had had her grandmother's permission to bring her.  Of course she could refuse to take her, but then she would believe her less than ever.  Now the nurse, as she said herself afterwards, could not be every moment in the room; and as never before yesterday had the princess given her the smallest reason for anxiety, it had not yet come into her head to watch her more closely.  So she soon gave her a chance, and, the very first that offered, Irene was off and up the stairs again.  This day's adventure, however, did not turn out like yesterday's, although it began like it; and indeed to-day is very seldom like yesterday, if people would note the differences--even when it rains. The princess ran through passage after passage, and could not find the stair of the tower.  My own suspicion is that she had not gone up high enough, and was searching on the second instead of the third floor. When she turned to go back, she failed equally in her search after the stair.  She was lost once more.  Something made it even worse to bear this time, and it was no wonder that she cried again.  Suddenly it occurred to her that it was after having cried before that she had found her grandmother's stair.  She got up at once, wiped her eyes, and started upon a fresh quest.  This time, although she did not find what she hoped, she found what was next best: she did not come on a stair that went up, but she came upon one that went down.  It was evidently not the stair she had come up, yet it was a good deal better than none; so down she went, and was singing merrily before she reached the bottom. There, to her surprise, she found herself in the kitchen.  Although she was not allowed to go there alone, her nurse had often taken her, and she was a great favourite with the servants.  So there was a general rush at her the moment she appeared, for"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7086"],["title","Life of Her Most Gracious Majesty the Queen — Volume 2 (#1)"],["body","next two days, the ordinary length of a royal visit, began with _battues_ for the Prince, when the accumulation of game was so enormous that, in place of the fact being remarkable that \"he hit almost everything he fired at,\" it would have been singular if a good shot could have avoided doing so. Fifty beaters, so near each other that their sticks almost touched, entered a thick cover and drove the game past the place where the sportsmen were stationed, into the open space of the park. Out the hares rushed from every quarter, \"so many of them, that it was often impossible to stop more than one out of half-a-dozen. The ground immediately in front of the shooters became strewn with dead and dying.... It was curious to behold the evident reluctance with which the hares left their retreat, and then their perplexity at finding themselves so beset without. Many actually made for the canal, and swam like dogs across a piece of water nearly a hundred yards wide, shaking themselves upon landing, and making off without any apparent distress. The pheasants were still more averse 'to come and be killed.' For some time not one appeared above the trees. The cocks were heard crowing like domestic fowls, as the numerous tribe retreated before the sticks of the advancing army of beaters. Upon arriving, however, at the edge of the wood, quite a cloud ascended, and the slaughter was proportionately great.\"  \"Slaughter,\" not sport, is the appropriate word. One cannot help thinking that so it must have struck the Prince; nor are we surprised that, on the next opportunity he had of exercising a sportsman's legitimate vocation, with the good qualities of patience, endurance, and skill, which it is calculated to call forth, emphatic mention is made of his keen enjoyment.  Besides shooting there was walking for both ladies and gentlemen, to the number of twenty guests, \"in the mild, clear weather,\" in the beautiful park. There was the usual county gathering, in order to confer on the upper ten thousand, within a radius of many miles, the much-prized honour of \"meeting\" the Queen at a dinner or a ball. Lastly, her Majesty and the Prince planted the oak and the cedar which were to rank like heirlooms, and be handed down as trophies of a royal visit and princely favour, to future generations.  The Queen and Prince Albert returned to Windsor on the evening of Saturday, the 18th of January, and on the afternoon of Monday, the 20th, they started again to pay a long-projected visit to her old friend the Duke of Wellington at Strathfieldsaye. It was known that the Duke had set his heart on entertaining his sovereign in his own house, and she not only granted him the boon, but in consideration of his age, his laurels, and the long and intimate connection between them, she let the visit have more of a private and friendly character than the visits of sovereigns to subjects were wont to have. However, the country did not lose its gala. Arches of winter evergreens instead of summer flowers, festive banners, loyal inscriptions, yeoman corps, holiday faces, met her on all sides. At Swallowfield--a name which Mary Russell Mitford has made pleasant to English ears--\"no less a person than the Speaker of the House of Commons,\" the representative of an old Huguenot refugee, the Right Honourable John Shaw Lefevre, commanded the troop of yeomanry.  The Iron Duke met his honoured guests in the hall and conducted them to the library. Every day the same formula was gone through. \"The Duke takes the Queen in to dinner, sits by her Majesty, and after dinner gets up and says, 'With your Majesty's permission I give the health of her Majesty,' and then the same to the Prince. They then adjourn to the library, and the Duke sits on the sofa by the Queen (almost as a father would sit by a daughter) for the rest of the evening until eleven o'clock, the Prince and the gentlemen being scattered about in the library or the billiard-room, which opens into it. In a large conservatory beyond, the band of the Duke's grenadier regiment plays through the evening.\"  There was much that was unique and kindly in the relations between the Queen and the greatest soldier of his day. He had stood by her baptismal font; she had been his guest, when she was the girl- Princess, at Walmer. He had sat in her first Council; he had witnessed her marriage; she was to give his name to one of her sons; in fact, he had taken part in every event of her life. The present arrangements were a graceful, well-nigh filial, tribute of affectionate regard for the old man who had served his country both on the battle-field and in the senate, who had watched his Queen's career with the keenest interest, and rejoiced in her success as something with which he had to do.  The old soldier also gave the Prince shooting, but it was the \"fine wild sport\" which might have been expected from the host, and which seemed more to the taste of the guest. And in the party of gentlemen who walked for miles over the ploughed land and through the brushwood, none kept up the pace better than the veteran.  The weather was broken and partly wet during the Queen's stay at Strathfieldsaye, and in lieu of out-of-door exercise, the tennis-court came into request. Lord Charles Wellesley, the Duke's younger son, played against professional players, and Prince Albert engaged Lord Charles and one of the professional players, the Queen looking on.  When the visit was over, the Duke punctiliously performed his part of riding on horseback by her Majesty's carriage for the first stage of her journey.  Comical illustrations are given of the old nobleman and soldier's dry rebuffs, administered to the members of the press and the public generally, who haunted Strathfieldsaye on this occasion.  The first was in reply to a request for admission to the house on the plea that the writer was one of the staff of a popular journal commissioned to give the details of the visit. \"Field-Marshal the Duke of Wellington presents his compliments to Mr. ---, and begs to say he does not see what his house at Strathfieldsaye has to do with the public press.\" The other was in the form of a still more ironical notice put up in the grounds, \"desiring that people who wish to see the house may drive up to the hall-door and ring the bell, but that they are to abstain from walking on the flagstones and looking in at the windows.\"  In February the Queen opened Parliament in person for what was destined to be a stormy session, particularly in relation to Sir Robert Peel's measure proposing an increased annual grant of money to the Irish Roman Catholic priests' college of Maynooth. In the Premier's speech, in introducing the Budget, he was able to pay a well-merited compliment on the wise and judicious economy shown in the management of her Majesty's income, so that it was equal to meet the heavy calls made upon it by the visits of foreign sovereigns, who were entertained in a manner becoming the dignity of the sovereign, \"without adding one tittle to the burdens of the country. And I am not required, on the part of her Majesty,\" went on Sir Robert Peel, \"to press for the extra expenditure of one single shilling on account of these unforeseen causes of increased expenditure. I think, to state this is only due to the personal credit of her Majesty, who insists upon it that there shall be every magnificence required by her station, but without incurring a single debt.\" In order to show how the additional cost of such royal hospitality taxed the resources even of the Queen of England, it may be well to give an idea of the ordinary scale of housekeeping at Windsor Castle. Lady Bloomfield likens the kitchen-fire to Nebuchadnezzar's burning fiery furnace. Even when there was no company, from fifteen to twenty joints hung roasting there. In one year the number of people fed at dinner in the Castle amounted to a hundred and thirteen thousand!  Shall we be accused of small moralities and petty lessons in thrift if we say that this passage in Sir Robert Peel's speech recalls the stories of the child-Princess's training, in a wholesome horror of debt, and the exercise of such little acts of self-denial as can alone come in a child's way; that it brings to mind the Tunbridge anecdote of the tiny purchaser on her donkey, bidden to look at her empty purse when a little box in the bazaar caught her eye, and prohibited from going further in obtaining the treasure, till the next quarter's allowance was due? Well might the nation that had read the report of Sir Robert Peel's speech listen complacently when it heard in the following month, of the Queen's acquisition of a private property which should be all her own and her husband's, to do with, as they chose. Another country bestowed, upon quite different grounds, on one of its sovereigns the honourable title of King Honest Man. Here was Queen Honest Woman, who would not buy what she could not afford, or ask her people to pay for fancies in which she indulged, regardless of her means. A different example had been presented by poor Louis XVI. and Marie Antoinette, who, after a course of what their most faithful servants admitted to be grievous misrule and misappropriation of public dignities and funds--to satisfy the ambition and greed of favourites or their friends--in the face of national bankruptcy, private ruin, and widespread disaffection, in the very death-throes of the Revolution, chose that time of all others to buy--under whatever specious pretext of exchange and indemnification--for him who had already so many hunting-seats, the fresh one of Rambouillet; for her, who had Little Trianon in its perfection, the new suburban country house of St. Cloud.  Osborne abounded in the advantages which the royal couple sought. It was in the Isle of Wight, which her Majesty had loved in her girlhood, with the girdle of sea that gave such assurance of the much-courted, much-needed seclusion, as could hardly be procured elsewhere--"]]]
