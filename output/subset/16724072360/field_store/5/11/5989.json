Let us diligently apply the means, never      doubting that a just God, in his own good time, will give us the      rightful result.                      Yours very truly,                                    A. LINCOLN.]   But Chattanooga, and the grand majorities in all the Fall State-elections, save that of New Jersey,--and especially the manner in which loyal Ohio sat down upon the chief Copperhead-Democrat and Treason-breeder of the North, Vallandigham--came most auspiciously to strengthen the President's hands.       [The head of the Knights of the Golden Circle, and the Democratic      candidate for Governor of Ohio]  And now he saw, more clearly still, the approach of that time when the solemn promise and declaration of Emancipation might be recorded upon the sacred roll of the Constitution, and thus be made safe for all time.  In his Annual Message of December, 1863, therefore, President Lincoln, after adverting to the fact that \"a year ago the War had already lasted nearly twenty months,\" without much ground for hopefulness, proceeded to say:  \"The preliminary Emancipation Proclamation, issued in September, was running its assigned period to the beginning of the New Year.  A month later the final Proclamation came, including the announcement that Colored men of suitable condition would be received into the War service.  The policy of Emancipation, and of employing Black soldiers, gave to the future a new aspect, about which hope, and fear, and doubt, contended in uncertain conflict.  \"According to our political system, as a matter of Civil Administration, the General Government had no lawful power to effect Emancipation in any State, and for a long time it had been hoped that the Rebellion could be suppressed without resorting to it as a Military measure.  It was all the while deemed possible that the necessity for it might come, and that if it should, the crisis of the contest would then be presented.  It came, and, as was anticipated, it was followed by dark and doubtful days.  \"Eleven months having now passed, we are permitted to take another view * * * Of those who were Slaves at the beginning of the Rebellion, full one hundred thousand are now in the United States Military service, about one half of which number actually bear arms in the ranks; thus giving the double advantage of taking so much labor from the Insurgent cause, and supplying the places which otherwise must be filled with so many White men.  So far as tested, it is difficult to say they are not as good soldiers as any.  \"No servile insurrection, or tendency to violence or cruelty, has marked the measures of Emancipation and arming the Blacks.  These measures have been much discussed in Foreign Countries, and contemporary with such discussion the tone of public sentiment there is much improved.  At home, the same measures have been fully discussed, supported, criticised, and denounced, and the annual elections following are highly encouraging to those whose official duty it is to bear the Country through this great trial.  Thus we have the new reckoning.  The crisis which threatened to divide the friends of the Union is past.\"  After alluding to his Proclamation of Amnesty, issued simultaneously with this Message, to all repentant Rebels who would take an oath therein prescribed, and contending that such an oath should be (as he had drawn it) to uphold not alone the Constitution and the Union, but the Laws and Proclamations touching Slavery as well, President Lincoln continued:  \"In my judgment they have aided and will further aid, the Cause for which they were intended.  To now abandon them, would be not only to relinquish a lever of power, but would also be a cruel and an astounding breach of faith.\"  And, toward the close of the Message, he added:  \"The movements by State action, for Emancipation, in several of the States not included in the Emancipation Proclamation, are matters of profound gratulation.  And while I do not repeat in detail what I have heretofore so earnestly urged upon the subject, my general views remain unchanged; and I trust that Congress will omit no fair opportunity of AIDING THESE IMPORTANT STEPS TO A GREAT CONSUMMATION.\"  Mr. Lincoln's patient but persistent solicitude, his earnest and unintermitted efforts--exercised publicly through his Messages and speeches, and privately upon Members of Congress who called upon, or whose presence was requested by him at the White House--in behalf of incorporating Emancipation in the Constitution, were now to give promise, at least, of bearing good fruit.  Measures looking to this end were submitted in both Houses of Congress soon after its meeting, and were referred to the respective Judiciary Committees of the same, and on the 10th of February, 1864, Mr. Trumbull reported to the Senate, from the Senate Judiciary Committee, of which he was Chairman, a substitute Joint Resolution providing for the submission to the States of an Amendment to the United States Constitution in the following words:  \"ART. XIII., SEC. I.  Neither Slavery nor Involuntary Servitude, except as a punishment for crime, whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.  \"SEC. II.  Congress shall have power to enforce this Article by appropriate legislation.\"  This proposed Amendment came up for consideration in the Senate, on the 28th of March, and a notable debate ensued.  On the same day, in the House of Representatives, Thaddeus Stevens--with the object perhaps of ascertaining the strength, in that Body, of the friends of out-and-out Emancipation--offered a Resolution proposing to the States the following Amendments to the United States Constitution:  \"ART. I.  Slavery and Involuntary Servitude, except for the punishment of crimes whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, is forever prohibited in the United States and all its Territories.  \"ART. II.  So much of Article four, Section two, as refers to the delivery up of Persons held to Service or Labor, escaping into another State, is annulled.\"  The test was made upon a motion to table the Resolution, which motion was defeated by 38 yeas to 69 nays, and showed the necessity for converting three members from the Opposition.  Subsequently, at the instance of Mr. Stevens himself, the second Article of the Resolution was struck out by 72 yeas to 26 nays.  The proceedings in both Houses of Congress upon these propositions to engraft upon the National Constitution a provision guaranteeing Freedom to all men upon our soil, were now interrupted by the death of one who would almost have been willing to die twice over, if, by doing so, he could have hastened their adoption.  Owen Lovejoy, the life-long apostle of Abolitionism, the fervid gospeller of Emancipation, was dead; and it seemed almost the irony of Fate that, at such a time, when Emancipation most needed all its friends to make it secure, its doughtiest champion should fall.  But perhaps the eloquent tributes paid to his memory, in the Halls of Congress, helped the Cause no less.  They at least brought back to the public mind the old and abhorrent tyrannies of the Southern Slave power; how it had sought not not only to destroy freedom of Action, but freedom of Speech, and hesitated not to destroy human Life with these; reminded the Loyal People of the Union of much that was hateful, from which they had escaped; and strengthened the purpose of Patriots to fix in the chief corner-stone of the Constitution, imperishable muniments of human Liberty.  Lovejoy's brother had been murdered at Alton, Illinois, while vindicating freedom of Speech and of the Press; and the blood of that martyr truly became \"the seed of the Church.\"  Arnold--recalling a speech of Owen Lovejoy's at Chicago, and a passage in it, descriptive of the martyrdom,--said to the House, on this sad occasion: \"I remember that, after describing the scene of that death, in words--which stirred every heart, he said he went a pilgrim to his brother's grave, and, kneeling upon the sod beneath which sleeps that brother, he swore, by the everlasting God, eternal hostility to African Slavery.\"  And, continued Arnold, \"Well and nobly has he kept that oath.\"  Washburne, too, reminded the House of the memorable episode in that very Hall when, (April 5, 1860), the adherents of Slavery crowding around Lovejoy with fierce imprecations and threats, seeking then and there to prevent Free Speech, \"he displayed that undaunted courage and matchless bearing which extorted the admiration of even his most deadly foes.\" \"His\"--continued the same speaker--\"was the eloquence of Mirabeau, which in the Tiers Etat and in the National Assembly made to totter the throne of France; it was the eloquence of Danton, who made all France to tremble from his tempestuous utterances in the National Convention. Like those apostles of the French Revolution, his eloquence could stir from the lowest depths all the passions of Man; but unlike them, he was as good and as pure as he was eloquent and brave, a noble minded Christian man, a lover of the whole human Race, and of universal Liberty regulated by Law.\"  Grinnell, in his turn, told also with real pathos, of his having recently seen Lovejoy in the chamber of sickness.  \"When,\" said Grinnell, \"I expressed fears for his recovery, I saw the tears course down his manly cheek, as he said 'Ah! God's will be done, but I have been laboring, voting, and praying for twenty years that I might see the great day of Freedom which is so near and which I hope God will let me live to rejoice in.  I want a vote on my Bill for the destruction of Slavery, root and branch.'\"        [Sumner, afterward speaking of Lovejoy and this Measure, said: \"On      the 14th of December, 1863, he introduced a Bill, whose title      discloses its character: 'A Bill to give effect to the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7139"],["title","The Great Conspiracy, Volume 7 (#1)"],["body","I might make an appeal to you to vote for this      Amendment.  It is going to be very close; a few votes one way or      the other will decide it.'       \"To this, I responded: 'Mr. President, so far as I am concerned,      you need not have sent for me to ascertain my views on this      subject, for although I represent perhaps the strongest      Slave-district in Missouri, and have the misfortune to be one of the      largest Slave-owners in the country where I reside, I had already      determined to vote for the Amendment.       \"He arose from his chair, and grasping me by the hand, gave it a      hearty shake, and said: 'I am most delighted to hear that.'       \"He asked me how many more of the Missouri delegates in the House      would vote for it.       \"I said I could not tell; the Republicans of course would; General      Loan, Mr. Blow, Mr. Boyd, and Colonel McClurg.       \"He said, 'Won't General Price vote for it?  He is a good Union      man.' I said I could not answer.       \"'Well, what about General King?'       \"I told him I did not know.       \"He then asked about Judges Hall and Norton.       \"I said they would both vote against it, I thought.       \"'Well,' he said, 'are you on good terms with Price and King?'       \"I responded in the affirmative, and that I was on easy terms with      the entire delegation.       \"He then asked me if I would not talk with those who might be      persuaded to vote for the amendment, and report to him as soon as I      could find out what the prospect was.'       \"I answered that I would do so with pleasure, and remarked at the      same time, that when I was a young man, in 1848, I was the Whig      competitor of King for Governor of Missouri, and, as he beat me      very badly, I thought now he should pay me back by voting as I      desired him on this important question.       \"I promised the President I would talk to this gentleman upon the      subject.       \"He said: 'I would like you to talk to all the Border-State men      whom you can approach properly, and tell them of my anxiety to have      the measure pass; and let me know the prospect of the Border-State      vote,' which I promised to do.       \"He again said: 'The passage of this Amendment will clinch the      whole subject; it will bring the War, I have no doubt, rapidly to a      close.'\"--Arnold's Life of Lincoln, pp. 358-359,]  On the 5th of January, 1865, the Christmas Recess having expired, Congress re-assembled.  The motion to reconsider the vote-by which the Joint Resolution, to amend the Constitution by the abolition of Slavery, had been defeated--was not called up, on that day, as its friends had not all returned; but the time was mainly consumed in able speeches, by Mr. Creswell of Maryland, and Stevens of Pennsylvania, in which the former declared that \"whether we would or not, we must establish Freedom if we would exterminate Treason.  Events have left us no choice.  The People have learned their duty and have instructed us accordingly.\"  And Mr. Thaddeus Stevens solemnly said: \"We are about to ascertain the National will, by another vote to amend the Constitution.  If gentlemen opposite will yield to the voice of God and Humanity, and vote for it, I verily believe the sword of the Destroying Angel will be stayed, and this People be reunited.  If we still harden our hearts, and blood must still flow, may the ghosts of the slaughtered victims sit heavily upon the souls of those who cause it!\"  On the 6th of January, Mr. Ashley called up his motion to reconsider the vote defeating the Thirteenth Amendment, and opened the debate with a lengthy and able speech in favor of that measure, in concluding which he said:  \"The genius of history, with iron pen, is waiting to record our verdict where it will remain forever for all the coming generations of men to approve or condemn.  God grant that this verdict may be one over which the friends of Liberty, impartial and universal, in this Country and Europe, and in every Land beneath the sun, may rejoice; a verdict which shall declare that America is Free; a verdict which shall add another day of jubilee, and the brightest of all, to our National calendar.\"  The debate was participated in by nearly all the prominent men, on both sides of the House--the speeches of Messrs. Cox, Brooks, Voorhees, Mallory, Holman, Woods and Pendleton being the most notable, in opposition to, and those of Scofield, Rollins, Garfield and Stevens, in favor of, the Amendment.  That of Scofield probably stirred up \"the adversary\" more thoroughly than any other; that of Rollins was more calculated to conciliate and capture the votes of hesitating, or Border-State men; that of Garfield was perhaps the most scholarly and eloquent; while that of Stevens was remarkable for its sledge-hammer pungency and characteristic brevity.  Mr. Pendleton, toward the end of his speech, had said of Mr. Stevens: \"Let him be careful, lest when the passions of these times be passed away, and the historian shall go back to discover where was the original infraction of the Constitution, he may find that sin lies at the door of others than the people now in arms.\"  And it was this that brought the sterling old Patriot again to his feet, in vindication of the acts of his liberty-inspired life, and in defense of the power to amend the Constitution, which had been assailed.  The personal antithesis with which he concluded his remarks was in itself most dramatically effective, Said he:  \"So far as the appeals of the learned gentleman (Mr. Pendleton) are concerned, in his pathetic winding up, I will be willing to take my chance, when we all moulder in the dust.  He may have his epitaph written, if it be truly written, 'Here rests the ablest and most pertinacious defender of Slavery, and opponent of Liberty;' and I will be satisfied if my epitaph shall be written thus: 'Here lies one who never rose to any eminence, and who only courted the low ambition to have it said that he had striven to ameliorate the condition of the poor, the lowly, the downtrodden, of every race, and language, and color.\"  As he said these words, the crowded floors and galleries broke out into involuntary applause for the grand \"Old Commoner\"--who only awaited its cessation, to caustically add: \"I shall be content, with such a eulogy on his lofty tomb and such an inscription on my humble grave, to trust our memories to the judgment of after ages.\"  The debate, frequently interrupted by Appropriation Bills, and other important and importunate measures, lasted until the 31st of January, when Mr. Ashley called the previous question on his motion to reconsider.  Mr. Stiles at once moved to table the motion to reconsider.  Mr. Stiles's motion was lost by 57 yeas to 111 nays.  This was in the nature of a test-vote, and the result, when announced, was listened to, with breathless attention, by the crowded House and galleries.  It was too close for either side to be satisfied; but it showed a gain to the friends of the Amendment; that was something.  How the final vote would be, none could tell.  Meanwhile it was known, from the announcements on the floor, that Rogers was absent through his own illness and Voorhees through illness in his family.  The previous question being seconded and the main question ordered, the yeas and nays were called on the motion to reconsider--and the intense silence succeeding the monotonous calling of the names was broken by the voice of the Speaker declaring the motion to reconsider, carried, by 112 yeas to 57 nays.  This vote created a slight sensation.  There was a gain of one, (English), at any rate, from among those not voting on the previous motion.  Now, if there should be but the change of a single vote, from the nays to the yeas, the Amendment would be carried!  The most intensely anxious solicitude was on nearly every face, as Mr. Mallory, at this critical moment, made the point of order that \"a vote to reconsider the vote by which the subject now before the House was disposed of, in June last, requires two-thirds of this Body,\" and emphatically added: \"that two-thirds vote has not been obtained.\"  A sigh of relief swept across the galleries, as the Speaker overruled the point of order.  Other attempted interruptions being resolutely met and defeated by Mr. Ashley, in charge of the Resolution, the \"previous question\" was demanded, seconded, and the main question ordered--which was on the passage of the Resolution.  And now, amid the hush of a breathless and intent anxiety--so absolute that the scratch of the recording pencil could be heard--the Clerk commenced to call the roll!  So consuming was the solicitude, on all sides, for the fate of this portentous measure, that fully one-half the Representatives kept tally at their desks as the vote proceeded, while the heads of the gathered thousands of both sexes, in the galleries, craned forward, as though fearing to lose the startlingly clear responses, while the roll-call progressed.  When it reached the name of English--Governor English, a Connecticut Democrat, who had not voted on the first motion, to table the motion to reconsider, but had voted \"yea\" on the motion to reconsider,--and he responded with a clear-cut \"aye\" on the passage of the Resolution--it looked as though light were coming at last, and applause involuntarily broke forth from the Republican side of the floor, spreading instantly to the galleries, despite the efforts of the Speaker to preserve order.  So, when Ganson of New York, and other Democrats, voted \"aye,\" the applause was renewed again and again, and still louder again, when, with smiling face--which corroborated the thrilling, fast-spreading, whisper, that \"the Amendment is safe!\"--Speaker Colfax directed the Clerk to call his name, as a member of the House, and, in response to that call, voted \"aye!\"  Then came dead silence, as the Clerk passed the result to the Speaker --during which a pin might have been"]]]
