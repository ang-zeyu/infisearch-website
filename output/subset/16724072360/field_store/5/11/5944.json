By boiling bones at a high temperature, the animal matter separates in the form of gelatine. Dogs and cats extract the animal matter from the bones they eat. Fossil bones deposited in the ground during the Geologic period, were found by Cuvier to contain considerable animal matter. Gelatine was actually extracted from the Cambridge mastodon, and made into glue. A tolerably nutritious food might thus be manufactured from bones older than man himself.] (cartilage) which can be bent like rubber.  If the bone be burned in the fire, thus consuming the animal matter, the shape will still be the same, but it will have lost its tenacity, and the beautiful, pure-white residue [Footnote: From bones thus calcined, the phosphorus of the chemist is made. See Steele's \"Popular Chemistry,\" page 114. If the animal matter be not consumed, but only charred, the bone will be black and brittle. In this way, the \"boneblack\" of commerce is manufactured.] may be crumbled into powder with the fingers.  FIG. 2.  [Illustration: _The Thigh Bone, or Femur, sawed lengthwise._]  We thus see that a bone receives hardness and rigidity from its mineral, and tenacity and elasticity from its animal matter.  The entire bone is at first composed of cartilage, which gradually _ossifies_ or turns to bone. [Footnote: The ossification of the bones on the sides and upper part of the skull, for example, begins by a rounded spot in the middle of each one. From this spot the ossification extends outward in every direction, thus gradually approaching the edges of the bone. When two adjacent bones meet, there will be a line where their edges are in contact with each other, but have not yet united; but when more than two bones meet in this way, there will be an empty space between them at their point of junction. Thus, if you lay down three coins upon the table with their edges touching one another, there will be a three-sided space in the middle between them; if you lay down four coins in the same manner, the space between them will be four-sided. Now at the back part of the head there is a spot where three bones come together in this way, leaving a small, three-sided opening between them: this is called the \"posterior fontanelle.\" On the top of the head, four bones come together, leaving between them a large, four-sided opening: this is called the \"anterior fontanelle.\" These openings are termed the _fontanelles_, because we can feel the pulsations of the brain through them, like the bubbling of water in a fountain. They gradually diminish in size, owing to the growth of the bony parts around them, and are completely closed at the age of four years after birth.--DALTON.] Certain portions near the joints are long delayed in this process, and by their elasticity assist in breaking the shock of a fall. [Footnote: Frogs and toads, which move by jumping, and consequently receive so many jars, retain these unossified portions (epiphyses) nearly through, life, while alligators and turtles whose position is sprawling, and whose motions are measured do not have them at all--LEIDY] Hence the bones of children are tough, are not readily fractured, and when broken easily heal again; [Footnote: This is only one of the many illustrations of the Infinite care that watches over helpless infancy, until knowledge and ability are acquired to meet the perils of life.] while those of elderly people are liable to fracture, and do not quickly unite.  FIG. 3.  [Illustration: _A thin slice of Bone, highly magnified showing the lacunć, the tiny tubes (canaliculi) radiating from them, and four Haversian canals, three seen crosswise and one lengthwise._]  THE STRUCTURE OF THE BONES--When a bone is sawed lengthwise, it is found to be a compact shell filled with a spongy substance This filling increases in quantity, and becomes more porous at the ends of the bone, thus giving greater size to form a strong joint, while the solid portion increases near the middle, where strength alone is needed. Each fiber of this bulky material diminishes the shock of a sudden blow, and also acts as a beam to brace the exterior wall. The recumbent position of the alligator protects him from falls, and therefore his bones contain very little spongy substance.  In the body, bones are not the dry, dead, blanched things they commonly seem to be, but are moist, living, pinkish structures, covered with a tough membrane, called the per-i-os'-te-um [Footnote: The relations of the periosteum to the bone are very interesting. Instances are on record where the bone has been removed, leaving the periosteum, from which the entire bone was afterward renewed.] (_peri_, around, and _osteon_, a bone), while the hollow is filled with marrow, rich in fat, and full of blood vessels. If we examine a thin slice with the microscope, we shall see black spots with lines running in all directions, and looking very like minute insects. These are really little cavities, called la-cu'-nć [Footnote: When the bone is dry, the lacunć are filled with air, which refracts the light, so that none of it reaches the eye, and hence the cavities appear black.] from which radiate tiny tubes. The lacunć are arranged in circles around larger tubes, termed from their discoverer, _Haversian canals_, which serve as passages for the blood vessels that nourish the bone.  GROWTH OF THE BONES.--By means of this system of canals, the blood circulates as freely through the bones as through any part of the body, The whole structure is constantly but slowly changing, [Footnote: Bone is sometimes produced with surprising rapidity. The great Irish Elk is calculated by Prof. Owen to have cast off and renewed, annually in its antlers eighty pounds of bone.] old material being taken out and new put in. A curious illustration is seen in the fact that if madder be mixed with the food of pigs, it will tinge their bones red.  REPAIR OF THE BONES.--When a bone is broken, the blood at once oozes out of the fractured ends. This soon gives place to a watery fluid, which in a fortnight thickens to a gristly substance, strong enough to hold them in place. Bone matter is then slowly deposited, which in five or six weeks will unite the broken parts. Nature, at first, apparently endeavors to remedy the weakness of the material by excess in the quantity, and so the new portion is larger than the old. But the extra matter will be gradually absorbed, sometimes so perfectly as to leave no trace of the injury. (See p. 271.)  A broken limb should be held in place by splints, or a plaster cast, to enable this process to go on uninterruptedly, and also lest a sudden jar might rupture the partially mended break. For a long time, the new portion consists largely of animal matter, and so is tender and pliable. The utmost care is therefore necessary to prevent a malformation.  THE JOINTS are packed with a soft, smooth cartilage, or gristle, which fits so perfectly as to be airtight. Upon convex surfaces, it is thickest at the middle, and upon concave surfaces, it is thickest at the edge, or where the wear is greatest. In addition, the ends of the bones are covered with a thin membrane, the _synovial_ (_sun_, with; _ovum_, an egg), which secretes a viscid fluid, not unlike the white of an egg. This lubricates the joints, and prevents the noise and wear of friction. The body is the only machine that oils itself.  The bones which form the joint are tied with stout ligaments (_ligo_, I bind), or bands, of a smooth, silvery white tissue, [Footnote: The general term _tissue_ is applied to the various textures of which the organs are composed. For example, the osseous tissue forms the bones; the fibrous tissue, the skin, tendons, and ligaments.] so strong that the bones are sometimes broken without injuring the fastenings.  II. CLASSIFICATION OF THE BONES.  For convenience, the bones of the skeleton are considered in three divisions: the _head_, the _trunk_, and the _limbs_.  1. THE HEAD.  THE BONES OF THE SKULL AND THE FACE form a cavity for the protection of the brain and the four organs of sense, viz.: sight, smell, taste, and hearing. All these bones are immovable except the lower jaw, which is hinged [Footnote: A ring of cartilage is inserted in its joints, something after the manner of a washer in machinery. This follows the movements of the jaw, and admits of freer motion, while it guards against dislocation.] at the back so as to allow for the opening and shutting of the mouth.  THE SKULL is composed, in general, of two compact plates, with a spongy layer between. These are in several pieces, the outer ones being joined by notched edges, sutures (su'tyurs,), in the way carpenters term dovetailing. (See Fig. 4.)  FIG. 4.  [Illustration: _The Skull._--1. _frontal bone;_ 2, _parietal bone;_ 3, _temporal bone;_ 4, _the sphenoid bone;_ 5, _ethmoid bone;_ 6, _superior maxillary (upper jaw) bone;_ 7, _malar bone;_ 8, _lachrymal bone;_ 9, _nasal bone;_ 10, _inferior maxillary (lower jaw) bone._]  The peculiar structure and form of the skull afford a perfect shelter for the brain--an organ so delicate that, if unprotected, an ordinary blow would destroy it. Its oval or egg shape adapts it to resist pressure. The smaller and stronger end is in front, where the danger is greatest. Projections before and behind shield the less protected parts. The hard plates are not easy to penetrate. [Footnote: Instances have been known where bullets, striking against the skull, have glanced off, been flattened, or even split into halves. In the Peninsular Campaign, the author saw a man who had been struck in the forehead by a bullet which, instead of penetrating the brain, had followed the skull around to the back of the head, and there passed out.] The spongy packing deadens every blow.

Hey?\" He turned up his head and looked at her, and Polly's hand shook worse than ever when the little snapping eyes were full on her face, and she had all she could do to keep from running out of the room and up on deck where she could breathe freely.  \"I am so sorry,\" she managed to gasp, feeling if she didn't say something, she should surely run. \"Does your head feel better?\" And she smoothed his hot forehead gently just as Phronsie always did Grandpapa's when it ached. And when she thought of Phronsie, then it was all she could do to keep the tears back. Where could she be? And would Jasper never come back?  And just then in ran Tom with a great clatter, complaining noisily every step of the way. \"I told you you'd much better get off to your stateroom, Granddad!\" he exclaimed. \"Here, I'll help you down there.\" And he laid a hasty hand on the feeble old arm.  \"I think he is sick,\" said Polly, gently. Jasper came hurrying in. \"Phronsie is all right,\" he had time to whisper to Polly.  \"Oh, Jasper!\" the colour rushed into her cheek that had turned quite white. \"I am so glad.\"  \"Nonsense!\" exclaimed Tom, abruptly. \"It's only one of his crotchets. You don't know; he gets up plenty of 'em on occasion.\"  \"What did you want a sovereign for?\" asked the old gentleman, querulously, taking his sharp little eyes off Polly to fasten them on his grandson's face. \"Say, I _will_ know.\"  \"And I say no matter,\" retorted Tom, roughly. \"And you ought to come down to your state-room where you belong. Come, Granddad!\" And he tried again to lay hold of his arm. But the little old gentleman sank back, and looked up at Polly again. \"I think I'll stay here,\" he said.  \"I say,\" began the boy, in an embarrassed way, \"this is dreadfully rough on you,\" and then he looked away from Polly to Jasper. \"And if you knew him as well as I do,\" nodding his head at his Grandfather, \"you wouldn't get in such a funk.\"  Polly was busy smoothing the hot forehead under the white hair, and appeared not to notice a word he said.  \"Your Grandfather really appears ill,\" said Jasper. \"And the doctor might give him something to help him.\"  Tom burst into a short laugh and kicked his heel against the table. \"Hoh! hoh! I say, you don't know him; oh, what muffs you are! He's well enough, only he's determined not to go to his state-room where he belongs, but to kick up a row here.\"  \"Very well,\" said Jasper, coolly, \"since you are determined to do nothing for his relief, I shall take it upon myself to summon the doctor.\" He stepped to a table a bit further off, and touched the electric button back of it.  \"Here, don't do that,\" remonstrated Tom, springing forward. But it was too late, and the steward who attended to calls on the library stepped in.  \"It isn't the hour for giving out books,\" he began.  Tom was stamping his foot impatiently, and scowling at Jasper, alternately casting longing glances out the nearest port-hole.  \"It isn't books we want,\" said Jasper, quickly, \"but this old gentleman\"--whose head was now heavily sunken on his breast, and whose cheek was quite white--\"appears to be very ill, and to need the doctor.\"  \"Is that so?\" The steward leaned over and peered into the old face. \"Well, he doesn't look just right, and that's a fact. Is he your father?\"  \"Oh, no,\" said Jasper, quickly, \"I don't know who he is. But, do hurry, for he's sick, and needs the doctor at once.\"  \"I'll get Dr. Jones.\" Off ran the steward toward the surgeon's cabin.  \"See what you've done,\" cried Tom, in a towering passion. \"Kicked up a pretty mess--when I tell you I've seen my Grandfather just as bad a hundred times.\"  Jasper made no reply, and Polly continued to stroke gently the poor head.  \"Well--well--well!\" exclaimed Mr. King, coming in, \"to be sure, it's very stupid in me not to think of looking in the library for both of you before. O dear me--bless me!\" And he came to a dead stop of astonishment.  \"Father,\" cried Jasper, \"this poor man seems very ill.\"  \"Oh, yes,\" breathed Polly, pitifully, \"he really is, Grandpapa.\" And she put out her hand to seize one of Mr. King's. \"And Jasper has sent for the doctor.\"  \"And none too soon, I should say,\" remarked Mr. King, grimly, with a keen glance into the old man's face. \"Raise his feet a little higher, Jasper; put a pillow under them; there, that's it. Well, the doctor should be hurried up.\" He glanced quickly around. \"Here, you boy,\" seeing Tom, \"run as you never have run before, and tell the doctor to come quickly.\"  \"There isn't any need,\" began Tom.  \"Do you _go_!\" commanded Mr. King, pointing to the door. And Tom went.  \"Father, that boy is his grandson,\" said Jasper, pointing to the sick man.  Mr. King stared into Jasper's face, unable to make a reply.  \"He is,\" declared Polly. \"Oh, Grandpapa, he really is!\" Then she buried her flushed face up against Mr. King's arm.  \"There is no need to waste words,\" said Mr. King, finding his tongue. \"There, there, Polly, child,\" fondling her brown head, \"don't feel badly. I'm sure you've done all you could.\"  \"'Twas Jasper; he did it all--I couldn't do anything,\" said Polly.  \"Oh, Polly, you did everything,\" protested Jasper.  \"Yes, yes, I know, you both did,\" said Mr. King. \"Well, here's the doctor, thank the Lord!\"  And then when nobody wanted them, the library seemed to be full of people, and the news spreading out to the decks, many of the passengers got out of their steamer chairs, and tried to swarm into the two doorways.  Tom, who never knew how he summoned Dr. Jones, being chiefly occupied in astonishment at finding that he obeyed a command from a perfect stranger, did not come back to the library, but kept himself with the same amazed expression on his face, idly kicking his heels in a quiet corner of the deck near by. He never thought of such a thing as being worried over his Grandfather, for he couldn't remember when the old gentleman hadn't been subject to nervous attacks; but somehow since \"a row,\" as he expressed it, \"had been kicked up,\" it was just as well to stay in the vicinity and see the end of it. But he wasn't going inside--no, not he!  After awhile, Tom was just beginning to yawn, and to feel that no one could expect him to waste time like that, and probably his Grandfather was going to sleep it out on the sofa, and the stupid doctor would find that there was nothing the matter, only the old man was nervous. \"And I'm going back to the fellows,\" decided Tom, shaking his long legs.  \"Oh, here you are!\" cried Jasper, running up to him. \"Come quickly,\" seizing his arm.  \"Hey, here, what are you about?\" roared Tom at him, shaking off the hand.  \"You must excuse me for wasting no ceremony,\" said Jasper, sternly. It struck Tom that he looked very much like the old gentleman who had told him to _go!_ \"Your Grandfather is very ill; something is the matter with his heart, and the doctor has sent me for you. He says he may not live an hour.\" It was necessary to tell the whole of the dreadful truth, for Tom was still staring at him in defiance.     II  TWO ENGLISH FRIENDS   \"I don't want you,\" muttered the old gentleman, feebly, turning his head away from Tom, and then he set his lips tightly together. But he held to Polly's hand.  \"You would better go out,\" Dr. Jones nodded to Tom. \"It excites him.\"  The second time Tom was told to go. He stood quite still. \"He's my Grandfather!\" he blurted out.  \"Can't help it,\" said Dr. Jones, curtly; \"he's my patient. So I tell you again it is imperative that you leave this room.\" Then he turned back to his work of making the sick man comfortable without taking any more notice of the boy.  Tom gave a good long look at as much of his Grandfather's face as he could see, then slunk out, in a dazed condition, trying to make himself as small as possible. Jasper found him a half hour afterward, hanging over the rail away from curious eyes, his head buried on his arms.  \"I thought you'd like to know that your Grandfather is better,\" said Jasper, touching the bent shoulder.  \"Get away, will you?\" growled Tom, kicking out his leg, unmindful where it struck.  \"And the doctor has gotten him into his state-room, and he is as comfortable as he could be made.\" Jasper didn't add that Dr. Jones had asked him to come back, and that the old man was still insisting that Polly should hold his hand.  \"In that case,\" declared Tom, suddenly twitching up his head, \"I will go down there.\" His face was so drawn that Jasper started, and then looked away over the sea, and did not appear to notice the clenched hand down by the boy's side.  \"I--I--didn't know he was sick.\" Tom brought it out in gusts, and his face worked worse than ever in his efforts not to show his distress. The only thing he could do was to double up his hand tighter than ever, as he tried to keep it back of him.  \"I understand,\" nodded Jasper, still looking off over the blue water.  \"And now I'll go down,\" said Tom, drawing a long breath and starting off. Oh! and Dr. Jones had said the last thing to Jasper as he rushed off with the good news to Tom, \"On no account let that boy see his Grandfather. I won't answer for the consequences if you do.\"  \"See here,\" Jasper tore his gaze off from the shimmering water. \"The doctor doesn't--doesn't think you ought to see your Grandfather now.\"  \"Hey!\" cried Tom, his drawn lips flying open, and his big blue eyes distending in anger. \"He's my Grandfather. I rather think I shall do as I've a mind to,\" and he plunged off.  \"Tom!\" Jasper took long steps after him. \"Beg your pardon, this is no time for thinking of anything but your Grandfather's life. Dr. Jones said you were not to see him at present.\" The truth must be told, for in another moment"]]]
