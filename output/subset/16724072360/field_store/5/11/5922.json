His best answer to \"Old Mortality\" would have been a novel, as good and on the whole as fair, written from the Covenanting side. Hogg attempted this reply, not to Scott's pleasure according to the Shepherd, in \"The Brownie of Bodsbeck.\" The Shepherd says that when Scott remarked that the \"Brownie\" gave an untrue description of the age, he replied, \"It's a devilish deal truer than yours!\" Scott, in his defence, says that to please the friends of the Covenanters, \"their portraits must be drawn without shadow, and the objects of their political antipathy be blackened, hooved, and horned ere they will acknowledge the likeness of either.\" He gives examples of clemency, and even considerateness, in Dundee; for example, he did not bring with him a prisoner, \"who laboured under a disease rendering it painful to him to be on horseback.\" He examines the story of John Brown, and disproves the blacker circumstances. Yet he appears to hold that Dundee should have resigned his commission rather than carry out the orders of Government? Burley's character for ruthlessness is defended by the evidence of the \"Scottish Worthies.\" As Dr. McCrie objects to his \"buffoonery,\" it is odd that he palliates the \"strong propensity\" of Knox \"to indulge his vein of humour,\" when describing, with ghoul-like mirth, the festive circumstances of the murder and burial of Cardinal Beaton. The odious part of his satire, Scott says, is confined to \"the fierce and unreasonable set of extra-Presbyterians,\" Wodrow's High Flyers. \"We have no delight to dwell either upon the atrocities or absurdities of a people whose ignorance and fanaticism were rendered frantic by persecution.\" To sum up the controversy, we may say that Scott was unfair, if at all, in tone rather than in statement. He grants to the Covenanters dauntless resolution and fortitude; he admits their wrongs; we cannot see, on the evidence of their literature, that he exaggerates their grotesqueness, their superstition, their impossible attitude as of Israelites under a Theocracy, which only existed as an ideal, or their ruthlessness on certain occasions. The books of Wodrow, Kirkton, and Patrick Walker, the sermons, the ghost stories, the dying speeches, the direct testimony of their own historians, prove all that Scott says, a hundred times over. The facts are correct, the testimony to the presence of another, an angelic temper, remains immortal in the figure of Bessie McLure. But an unfairness of tone may be detected in the choice of such names as Kettledrummle and Poundtext: probably the \"jog-trot\" friends of the Indulgence have more right to complain than the \"high-flying\" friends of the Covenant. Scott had Cavalier sympathies, as Macaulay had Covenanting sympathies. That Scott is more unjust to the Covenanters than Macaulay to Claverhouse historians will scarcely maintain. Neither history or fiction would be very delightful if they were warless.  This must serve as an apology more needed by Macaulay--than by Sir Walter. His reply to Dr. McCrie is marked by excellent temper, humour, and good humor. The \"Quarterly Review\" ends with the well known reference to his brother Tom's suspected authorship: \"We intended here to conclude this long article, when a strong report reached us of certain transatlantic confessions, which, if genuine (though of this we know nothing), assign a different author to those volumes than the party suspected by our Scottish correspondents. Yet a critic may be excused for seizing upon the nearest suspected person, or the principle happily expressed by Claverhouse in a letter to the Earl of Linlithgow. He had been, it seems, in search of a gifted weaver who used to hold forth at conventicles: 'I sent for the webster, they brought in his brother for him: though he, maybe, cannot preach like his brother, I doubt not but he is as well principled as he, wherefore I thought it would be no great fault to give him the trouble to go to jail with the rest.'\"  Nobody who read this could doubt that Scott was, at least, \"art and part\" in the review. His efforts to disguise himself as an Englishman, aided by a Scotch antiquary, are divertingly futile. He seized the chance of defending his earlier works from some criticisms on Scotch manners suggested by the ignorance of Gifford. Nor was it difficult to see that the author of the review was also the author of the novel. In later years Lady Louisa Stuart reminded Scott that \"Old Mortality,\" like the Iliad, had been ascribed by clever critics to several hands working together. On December 5, 1816, she wrote to him, \"I found something you wot of upon my table; and as I dare not take it with me to a friend's house, for fear of arousing curiosity\"--she read it at once. She could not sleep afterwards, so much had she been excited. \"Manse and Cuddie forced me to laugh out aloud, which one seldom does when alone.\" Many of the Scotch words \"were absolutely Hebrew\" to her. She not unjustly objected to Claverhouse's use of the word \"sentimental\" as an anachronism. Sentiment, like nerves, had not been invented in Claverhouse's day.  The pecuniary success of \"Old Mortality\" was less, perhaps, than might have been expected. The first edition was only of two thousand copies. Two editions of this number were sold in six weeks, and a third was printed. Constable's gallant enterprise of ten thousand, in \"Rob Roy,\" throws these figures into the shade.  \"Old Mortality\" is the first of Scott's works in which he invades history beyond the range of what may be called living oral tradition. In \"Waverley,\" and even in \"Rob Roy,\" he had the memories of Invernahyle, of Miss Nairne, of many persons of the last generation for his guides. In \"Old Mortality\" his fancy had to wander among the relics of another age, among the inscribed tombs of the Covenanters, which are common in the West Country, as in the churchyards of Balmaclellan and Dalry. There the dust of these enduring and courageous men, like that of Bessie Bell and Marion Gray in the ballad, \"beiks forenenst the sun,\" which shines on them from beyond the hills of their wanderings, while the brown waters of the Ken murmur at their feet.                 Here now in peace sweet rest we take,                Once murdered for religion's sake,  says the epitaph on the flat table-stone, beneath the wind tormented trees of Iron Gray. Concerning these _Manes Presbyteriani_, \"Guthrie's and Giffan's Passions\" and the rest, Scott had a library of rare volumes full of prophecies, \"remarkable Providences,\" angelic ministrations, diabolical persecutions by The Accuser of the Brethren,--in fact, all that Covenanteers had written or that had been written about Covenanteers. \"I'll tickle ye off a Covenanter as readily as old Jack could do a young Prince; and a rare fellow he is, when brought forth in his true colours,\" he says to Terry (November 12, 1816). He certainly was not an unprejudiced witness, some ten years earlier, when he wrote to Southey, \"You can hardly conceive the perfidy, cruelty, and stupidity of these people, according to the accounts they have themselves preserved. But I admit I had many prejudices instilled into me, as my ancestor was a Killiecrankie man.\" He used to tease Grahame of \"The Sabbath,\" \"but never out of his good humour, by praising Dundee, and laughing at the Covenanters.\" Even as a boy he had been familiar with that godly company in \"the original edition of the lives of Cameron and others, by Patrick Walker.\" The more curious parts of those biographies were excised by the care of later editors, but they may all be found now in the \"Biographia Presbyteriana\" (1827), published by True Jock, chief clerk to \"Leein' Johnnie,\" Mr. John Ballantyne. To this work the inquirer may turn, if he is anxious to see whether Scott's colouring is correct. The true blue of the Covenant is not dulled in the \"Biographia Presbyteriana.\"  With all these materials at his command, Scott was able almost to dwell in the age of the Covenant hence the extraordinary life and brilliance of this, his first essay in fiction dealing with a remote time and obsolete manners. His opening, though it may seem long and uninviting to modern readers, is interesting for the sympathetic sketch of the gentle consumptive dominie. If there was any class of men whom Sir Walter could not away with, it was the race of schoolmasters, \"black cattle\" whom he neither trusted nor respected. But he could make or invent exceptions, as in the uncomplaining and kindly usher of the verbose Cleishbotham. Once launched in his legend, with the shooting of the Popinjay, he never falters. The gallant, dauntless, overbearing Bothwell, the dour Burley, the handful of Preachers, representing every current of opinion in the Covenant, the awful figure of Habakkuk Mucklewrath, the charm of goodness in Bessie McLure, are all immortal, deathless as Shakspeare's men and women. Indeed here, even more than elsewhere, we admire the life which Scott breathes into his minor characters, Halliday and Inglis, the troopers, the child who leads Morton to Burley's retreat in the cave, that auld Laird Nippy, old Milnwood (a real \"Laird Nippy\" was a neighbour of Scott's at Ashiestiel), Ailie Wilson, the kind, crabbed old housekeeper, generous in great things, though habitually niggardly in things small. Most of these are persons whom we might still meet in Scotland, as we might meet Cuddie Headrigg--the shrewd, the blithe, the faithful and humorous Cuddie. As to Miss Jenny Dennison, we can hardly forgive Scott for making that gayest of soubrettes hard and selfish in married life. He is too severe on the harmless and even beneficent race of coquettes, who brighten life so much, who so rapidly \"draw up with the new pleugh lad,\" and who do so very little harm when all is said. Jenny plays the part of a leal and brave lass in the siege of Tillietudlem, hunger and terror do not subdue her spirit; she is true, in spite of many temptations, to her Cuddie,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6940"],["title","Old Mortality, Volume 2. (#1)"],["body","which has been given to us, they caused shut the gates of the tower, and called in men, and collected ammunition. They were ever a fierce and a malignant house.\"  \"We will not, with my consent,\" said Burley, \"engage in a siege which may consume time. We must rush forward, and follow our advantage by occupying Glasgow; for I do not fear that the troops we have this day beaten, even with the assistance of my Lord Ross's regiment, will judge it safe to await our coming.\"  \"Howbeit,\" said Poundtext, \"we may display a banner before the Tower, and blow a trumpet, and summon them to come forth. It may be that they will give over the place into our mercy, though they be a rebellious people. And we will summon the women to come forth of their stronghold, that is, Lady Margaret Bellenden and her grand-daughter, and Jenny Dennison, which is a girl of an ensnaring eye, and the other maids, and we will give them a safe conduct, and send them in peace to the city, even to the town of Edinburgh. But John Gudyill, and Hugh Harrison, and Miles Bellenden, we will restrain with fetters of iron, even as they, in times bypast, have done to the martyred saints.\"  \"Who talks of safe conduct and of peace?\" said a shrill, broken, and overstrained voice, from the crowd.  \"Peace, brother Habakkuk,\" said Macbriar, in a soothing tone, to the speaker.  \"I will not hold my peace,\" reiterated the strange and unnatural voice; \"is this a time to speak of peace, when the earth quakes, and the mountains are rent, and the rivers are changed into blood, and the two-edged sword is drawn from the sheath to drink gore as if it were water, and devour flesh as the fire devours dry stubble?\"  While he spoke thus, the orator struggled forward to the inner part of the circle, and presented to Morton's wondering eyes a figure worthy of such a voice and such language. The rags of a dress which had once been black, added to the tattered fragments of a shepherd's plaid, composed a covering scarce fit for the purposes of decency, much less for those of warmth or comfort. A long beard, as white as snow, hung down on his breast, and mingled with bushy, uncombed, grizzled hair, which hung in elf-locks around his wild and staring visage. The features seemed to be extenuated by penury and famine, until they hardly retained the likeness of a human aspect. The eyes, grey, wild, and wandering, evidently betokened a bewildered imagination. He held in his hand a rusty sword, clotted with blood, as were his long lean hands, which were garnished at the extremity with nails like eagle's claws.  \"In the name of Heaven! who is he?\" said Morton, in a whisper to Poundtext, surprised, shocked, and even startled, at this ghastly apparition, which looked more like the resurrection of some cannibal priest, or druid red from his human sacrifice, than like an earthly mortal.  \"It is Habakkuk Mucklewrath,\" answered Poundtext, in the same tone, \"whom the enemy have long detained in captivity in forts and castles, until his understanding hath departed from him, and, as I fear, an evil demon hath possessed him. Nevertheless, our violent brethren will have it, that he speaketh of the spirit, and that they fructify by his pouring forth.\"  Here he was interrupted by Mucklewrath, who cried in a voice that made the very beams of the roof quiver--\"Who talks of peace and safe conduct? who speaks of mercy to the bloody house of the malignants? I say take the infants and dash them against the stones; take the daughters and the mothers of the house and hurl them from the battlements of their trust, that the dogs may fatten on their blood as they did on that of Jezabel, the spouse of Ahab, and that their carcasses may be dung to the face of the field even in the portion of their fathers!\"  \"He speaks right,\" said more than one sullen voice from behind; \"we will be honoured with little service in the great cause, if we already make fair weather with Heaven's enemies.\"  \"This is utter abomination and daring impiety,\" said Morton, unable to contain his indignation.  \"What blessing can you expect in a cause, in which you listen to the mingled ravings of madness and atrocity?\"  \"Hush, young man!\" said Kettledrummle, \"and reserve thy censure for that for which thou canst render a reason. It is not for thee to judge into what vessels the spirit may be poured.\"  \"We judge of the tree by the fruit,\" said Poundtext, \"and allow not that to be of divine inspiration that contradicts the divine laws.\"  \"You forget, brother Poundtext,\" said Macbriar, \"that these are the latter days, when signs and wonders shall be multiplied.\"  Poundtext stood forward to reply; but, ere he could articulate a word, the insane preacher broke in with a scream that drowned all competition.  \"Who talks of signs and wonders? Am not I Habakkuk Mucklewrath, whose name is changed to Magor-Missabib, because I am made a terror unto myself and unto all that are around me?--I heard it--When did I hear it?--Was it not in the Tower of the Bass, that overhangeth the wide wild sea?--And it howled in the winds, and it roared in the billows, and it screamed, and it whistled, and it clanged, with the screams and the clang and the whistle of the sea-birds, as they floated, and flew, and dropped, and dived, on the bosom of the waters. I saw it--Where did I see it?--Was it not from the high peaks of Dunbarton, when I looked westward upon the fertile land, and northward on the wild Highland hills; when the clouds gathered and the tempest came, and the lightnings of heaven flashed in sheets as wide as the banners of an host?--What did I see?--Dead corpses and wounded horses, the rushing together of battle, and garments rolled in blood.--What heard I?--The voice that cried, Slay, slay--smite--slay utterly--let not your eye have pity! slay utterly, old and young, the maiden, the child, and the woman whose head is grey--Defile the house and fill the courts with the slain!\"  \"We receive the command,\" exclaimed more than one of the company. \"Six days he hath not spoken nor broken bread, and now his tongue is unloosed:--We receive the command; as he hath said, so will we do.\"  Astonished, disgusted, and horror-struck, at what he had seen and heard, Morton turned away from the circle and left the cottage. He was followed by Burley, who had his eye on his motions.  \"Whither are you going?\" said the latter, taking him by the arm.  \"Any where,--I care not whither; but here I will abide no longer.\"  \"Art thou so soon weary, young man?\" answered Burley. \"Thy hand is but now put to the plough, and wouldst thou already abandon it? Is this thy adherence to the cause of thy father?\"  \"No cause,\" replied Morton, indignantly--\"no cause can prosper, so conducted. One party declares for the ravings of a bloodthirsty madman; another leader is an old scholastic pedant; a third\"--he stopped, and his companion continued the sentence--\"Is a desperate homicide, thou wouldst say, like John Balfour of Burley?--I can bear thy misconstruction without resentment. Thou dost not consider, that it is not men of sober and self-seeking minds, who arise in these days of wrath to execute judgment and to accomplish deliverance. Hadst thou but seen the armies of England, during her Parliament of 1640, whose ranks were filled with sectaries and enthusiasts, wilder than the anabaptists of Munster, thou wouldst have had more cause to marvel; and yet these men were unconquered on the field, and their hands wrought marvellous things for the liberties of the land.\"  \"But their affairs,\" replied Morton, \"were wisely conducted, and the violence of their zeal expended itself in their exhortations and sermons, without bringing divisions into their counsels, or cruelty into their conduct. I have often heard my father say so, and protest, that he wondered at nothing so much as the contrast between the extravagance of their religious tenets, and the wisdom and moderation with which they conducted their civil and military affairs. But our councils seem all one wild chaos of confusion.\"  \"Thou must have patience, Henry Morton,\" answered Balfour; \"thou must not leave the cause of thy religion and country either for one wild word, or one extravagant action. Hear me. I have already persuaded the wiser of our friends, that the counsellors are too numerous, and that we cannot expect that the Midianites shall, by so large a number, be delivered into our hands. They have hearkened to my voice, and our assemblies will be shortly reduced within such a number as can consult and act together; and in them thou shalt have a free voice, as well as in ordering our affairs of war, and protecting those to whom mercy should be shown--Art thou now satisfied?\"  \"It will give me pleasure, doubtless,\" answered Morton, \"to be the means of softening the horrors of civil war; and I will not leave the post I have taken, unless I see measures adopted at which my conscience revolts. But to no bloody executions after quarter asked, or slaughter without trial, will I lend countenance or sanction; and you may depend on my opposing them, with both heart and hand, as constantly and resolutely, if attempted by our own followers, as when they are the work of the enemy.\"  Balfour waved his hand impatiently.  \"Thou wilt find,\" he said, \"that the stubborn and hard-hearted generation with whom we deal, must be chastised with scorpions ere their hearts be humbled, and ere they accept the punishment of their iniquity. The word is gone forth against them, 'I will bring a sword upon you that shall avenge the quarrel of my Covenant.' But what is done shall be done gravely, and with discretion, like that of the worthy James Melvin, who executed judgment on the tyrant and oppressor, Cardinal Beaton.\"  \"I own to you,\" replied Morton, \"that I feel still more abhorrent at cold-blooded and premeditated cruelty, than at that which is practised in the heat of zeal and resentment.\"  \"Thou art yet but a youth,\" replied Balfour, \"and hast not learned how"]]]
