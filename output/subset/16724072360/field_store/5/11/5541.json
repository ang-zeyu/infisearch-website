But longingly as Barbara thought of Spain and of her boy, often as she went to the Dubois house and to the regent's home to obtain news, nothing could be heard of her child.  Many provisions of the imperial will were known, but there was no mention of her son.  Yet Charles could not have forgotten him, and Adrian protested that it would soon appear that he had not omitted him in his last will, and this was done in a manner which indicated that he knew more than he would or could confess.  All this increased Barbara's impatience to the highest degree, and induced her to watch and question with twofold zeal.  On no account would she have left the capital during this period of decision, and, though her husband earnestly entreated her to go to the springs, whose waters had proved so beneficial, she remained in Brussels.  In August she saw King Philip set out for Spain, and Margaret of Parma, her son's sister, assume the government of the Netherlands as regent.  On various occasions she succeeded in obtaining a near view of the stately-lady, with her clever; kindly and, spite of the famous down on her upper lip, by no means unlovely features, and her attractive appearance gave Barbara courage to request an audience, in order to learn from her something about her child.  But the effort was vain, for the duchess had had no news of the existence of a second son of her father; and this time it was Granvelle who prevented the regent from receiving the woman who would probably have spoken to her of the boy concerning whose fate King Philip had yet reached no determination.  Barbara spent the month of October in depression caused by this fresh disappointment, but it, too, passed without bringing her any satisfaction.  It seemed almost foolish to lull herself further with ambitious expectations, but the hope a mother's heart cherishes for her child does not die until its last throb; and if the Emperor Charles's will did not give her John his rights, then the gracious Virgin would secure them, if necessary, by a miracle.  Her faithful clinging to hope was rewarded, for when one day, with drooping head, she returned home from another futile errand, she found Hannibal Melas there, as bearer of important news.  The Emperor's last will had a codicil, which concerned a son of his Majesty; but, a few days before his end, Charles had also remembered Barbara, and commissioned Ogier Bodart, Adrian's successor, to buy a life annuity for her in Brussels.  Hannibal had learned all this from secret despatches received by Granvelle the day before.  Informing her of their contents might cost him his place; but how often she had entreated him to think of her if any news came from Valladolid of a boy named Geronimo or John, and how much kindness she had showed him when he was only a poor choir boy!  At last, at last the most ardent desire of the mother's heart was to be fulfilled.  She saw in the codicil the bridge which would lead her son to splendour and magnificence, and up to the last hour of his life the Emperor Charles had also remembered her.  She felt not only relieved of a burden, but as if borne on wings.  Which of these two pieces of news rendered her the happier, she could not have determined.  Yet she did not once think of the addition to her income. What was that in comparison to the certainty that to the last Charles did not forget her!  It made her husband happy to see her sunny cheerfulness.  Never had she played and romped with the children in such almost extravagant mirth. Nay, more!  For the first time the officer's modest house echoed with the singing of its mistress.  Though her voice was no longer so free from sharpness and harshness as in the old days, it by no means jarred upon the ear; nay, every tone revealed its admirable training.  She had broken the long silence with Josquin's motet, \"Quia amore langueo,\" and in her quiet chamber dedicated it, as it were, to the man to whom this cry of longing had been so dear. Then, in memory of and gratitude to him, other religious songs which he had liked to hear echoed from her lips.  The little German ballads which she afterward sang, to the delight of her boys, deeply moved her husband's heart, and she herself found that it was no insult to art when, with the voice that she now possessed, she again devoted herself to the pleasure of singing.  If the codicil brought her son what she desired, she could once more, if her voice lost the sharpness which still clung to it, serve her beloved art as a not wholly unworthy priestess, and then, perchance, she would again possess the right, so long relinquished, of calling herself happy.  She would go the next day to Appenzelder, who always greeted her kindly when they met in the street, and ask his advice.  If only Wolf had been there!  He understood how to manage women's voices also, and could have given her the best directions how to deal with the new singing exercises.  It seemed as though in these days not one of her wishes remained unfulfilled, for the very next afternoon, just as she was dressing to call upon the leader of the boy choir, the servant announced a stranger.  A glad presentiment hurried her into the vestibule, and there stood Sir Wolf Hartschwert in person, an aristocratic cavalier in his black Spanish court costume.  He had become a man indeed, and his appearance did not even lack the \"sosiego,\" the calm dignity of the Castilian noble, which gave Don Louis Quijada so distinguished an appearance.  True, his greeting was more eager and cordial than the genuine \"sosiego\" --which means \"repose\"--would have permitted.  Even the manner in which Wolf expressed his pleasure in the new melody of Barbara's voice, and whispered an entreaty to send the children and Frau Lamperi--who came to greet him--away for a short time, was anything but patient.  What had he in view?  Yet it must be something good.  When the light shone through her flower-decked window upon his face, she thought she perceived this by the smile hovering around his lips. She was not mistaken, nor did she wait long for the joyous tidings she expected; his desire to tell her what, with the exception of the regent-- to whom his travelling companion, the Grand Prior Don Luis de Avila, was perhaps just telling it as King Philip's envoy--no human being in the Netherlands could yet know, was perhaps not much less than hers to hear it.  Scarcely an hour before he had dismounted in Brussels with the nobleman, and his first visit was to her, whom his news must render happy, even happier than it did him and the woman in the house near the palace, whose heart cherished the Emperor's son scarcely less warmly than his own mother's.  On the long journey hither he had constantly anticipated the pleasure of telling every incident in succession, just as it had happened; but Barbara interrupted his first sentence with an inquiry how her John was faring.  \"He is so well that scarcely ever has any boy in the happiest time of his life fared better,\" was the reply; and its purport, as well as the tone in which it was uttered, entered Barbara's heart like angels' greetings from the wide-open heavens.  But Wolf went on with his report, and when, in spite of hundreds of questions, he at last completed the main points, his listener staggered, as if overcome by wine, to the image of the Virgin on the pilaster, and with uplifted hands threw herself on her knees before it.  Wolf, unobserved, silently stole away.      CHAPTER XVII.  The following afternoon Wolf sought Barbara again, and now for the first time succeeded in relating regularly and clearly what, constantly interrupted by her impatience, he had told in a confused medley the day before.  Pyramus, as usual, was away, and Barbara had taken care that no one should interrupt them.  Deep silence pervaded the comfortable room, and Wolf had seated himself in the arm-chair opposite to the young wife when, at her entreaty, he began to tell the story again.  She had informed him of Dona Magdalena's letter, and that it took her to the Emperor's residence in San Yuste.  At that point her friend's fresh tidings began.  In the spring of the previous year Wolf had again been summoned from Valladolid, where in the winter he directed the church singing as prinnen of the religious music, to Cuacos, near San Yuste, where Quijada's wife lived with her foster-son Geronimo.  From there he had often gone with Dona Magdalena and the boy to the Emperor's residence, and frequently saw him.  The account given in the letter written by Quijada's wife also applied to the last months of the imperial recluse's existence.  Doubtless he sometimes devoted himself to pious exercises and quiet meditation, but he was usually busied with political affairs and the reading and dictating of despatches.  Even at that time he received many visitors.  When Geronimo came from Cuacos, he was permitted to go in and out of his apartments freely, and the Emperor even seemed to prefer him to Don Carlos, his grandson, King Philip's only son, who was destined to become the head of his house; at least, Charles's conduct favoured this opinion.  On his return to Spain he had made his grandson's acquaintance in Valladolid.  He was a boy who had well-formed, somewhat sickly features, and a fragile body.  Of course the grandfather felt the deepest interest in him, and the influence of the famous victor in so many battles upon the twelve- year-old lad was a most beneficial one.  But Charles had scarcely left Valladolid when the passionate boy's extremely dangerous tastes burst forth with renewed violence.  The recluse student of human nature had probably perceived them, for when his tutor, and especially the young evildoer's aunt, Juana, the Emperor Charles's daughter, earnestly entreated him to let the grandson, whose presence would disturb him very little, come to San Yuste, because his"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5570"],["title","Barbara Blomberg â€” Volume 10 (#2)"],["body","over Don Carlos would be of priceless value, the grandfather most positively refused the request.  On the other hand, the Emperor had not only tolerated his son Geronimo near him, but rejoiced in his presence, for the quiet sufferer's eyes had sparkled when he saw him.  Wolf himself had often witnessed this delightful sight.  How Barbara's heart swelled, how eagerly she listened, as Wolf described how well founded was his Majesty's affection for this beautiful, extremely lovable, docile, true-hearted, and, moreover, frank, boy!  True, he showed as yet little taste for knowledge and all that can be learned from books; but he devoted himself with fiery zeal to the knightly exercises which since his Majesty's death Quijada himself was directing, and in which he promised to become a master.  Besides, by appealing to his ambition, he could be induced to put forth all his powers, and, if his teachers aimed at what they studiously omitted, it would not be difficult to make a scholar of him.  He had not remained unnoticed by any of the great lords who had sought the Emperor in Sal Yuste and met him.  The Venetian ambassador Bodoaro, had asked the name of the splendid young noble.  Even when Death was already stretching hi hand toward the Emperor, he was still overburdened with business, and the heretical agitation which was discovered at that time in Spain had caused him much sorrow, especially as men and women whom he knew personally, belonging to the distinguished families of Posa and De Rojas, has taken part in it.  The monarch's end came more quickly than was expected.  He had been unable to attend the auto-da-fe at which the heretics were committed to the flames.  He would have done so gladly, and after this mournful experience even regretted that he had granted the German misleader, Luther, the safe conduct promised.  Before a fatal weakness suddenly attacked him his health had been rather better than before; then his voice failed, and Quijada was compelled to kneel beside his bed that he might understand what he wished to impress upon him.  While doing so, the dying man had expressed the desire that Don Luis would commend Geronimo to the love of his son Philip.  He had also remembered the love of better days, and when Barbara insisted upon learning what he had said of her, Wolf, who had heard it from Don Luis, did not withhold it.  He had complained of her perverse nature.  Had she obediently gone to the convent, he might have spared himself and her the sorrow of holding her so rigidly aloof from his person.  Finally, he had spoken of her singing with rapturous delight.  At night the \"Quia amore langueo\" from the Mary motet had echoed softly from his lips, and when he perceived that Don Luis had heard him, he murmured that this peerless cry of longing, reminded him not of the earthly but the heavenly love.  At these words Barbara hid her face in her hands, and Wolf paused until she had controlled the sobs which shook her breast.  Then he went on, she listening devoutly with wet eyes and clasped hands.  The Archbishop of Toledo was summoned, and predicted that Charles would die on the day after to-morrow, St. Matthew's day.  He was born on St. Matthias's day, and he would depart from life on St. Matthew's,-- [September 12, 1558]--Matthias's brother and fellow-disciple.  So it was, and Barbara remembered that his son and hers had also seen the light of the world on St. Matthias's day.  Charles's death-agony was severe.  When Dr. Mathys at last said softly to those who were present, \"Jam moritur,\"--[Now he is dying]--the loud cry \"Jesus!\" escaped his lips, and he sank back upon the pillows lifeless.  Here Wolf was again obliged to give his weeping friend time to calm herself.  What he now had to relate--both knew it--was well suited to transform the tears which Barbara was shedding in memory of the beloved dead to tears of joy.  While she was wiping her eyes, Wolf described the great anxiety which, after Charles's death, overpowered the Quijadas in Villagarcia.  The codicil had existed, and Don Luis was familiar with its contents. But how would King Philip take it?  Dona Magdalena knew not what to do with herself in her anxiety.  The immediate future must decide Geronimo's fate, so she went on a pilgrimage with her darling to the Madonna of Guadelupe to pray for the repose of the Emperor's soul, and also to beseech the gracious Virgin mercifully to remember him, Geronimo.  Until that time the boy had believed Don Luis and his wife to be his parents, and had loved Dona Magdalena like the most affectionate son.  He had not even the slightest suspicion that he was a child of the Emperor, and was perfectly satisfied with the lot of being the son of a grandee and the child of so good, tender, and beautiful a mother.  This exciting expectation on the part of the Quijadas lasted nearly a whole year, for it was that length of time before Don Philip finally left the Netherlands and reached Valladolid.  He spent the anniversary of his father's death in the monastery of Del Abrojo.  There, or previously, he had read the codicil in which his imperial father acknowledged the boy Geronimo as his son.  Barbara now desired to learn the contents of the codicil and, as Wolf had told her yesterday how the boy's fate had changed, he interrupted his narrative and obeyed her wish.  As a widower, Charles confessed that he had had a son in Germany by an unmarried woman.  He had reason to wish that the boy should assume the robe of a reformed order, but he must be neither forced nor persuaded to do so.  If he wished to remain in the world, he would settle upon him a yearly income of from twenty to thirty thousand ducats, which was to pass also to his heirs.  Whatever mode of life he might choose, he commanded his son Philip to honour him and treat him with due respect.  As on the day before, when Barbara had only learned in general terms what the codicil contained, her soul to-day, while listening to the more minute particulars, was filled with grateful joy.  Her sacrifice had not been vain.  For years the fear of seeing her son vanish in a monastery had darkened her days and nights, and Quijada and Dona Magdalena had also probably dreaded that King Philip might confide his half-brother to a reformed order, for the monarch had by no means hastened to inform the anxious pair what he had determined.  It was not until the end of September that, upon the pretext of hunting, he went to the monastery of San Pedro de la Espina, a league from Villagarcia, and ordered Don Luis to seek him there with the boy. He was to leave the latter wholly unembarrassed, and not even inform him that the gentleman whom he would meet was the King.  His decision, he had added in the chilling manner characteristic of him, would depend upon circumstances.  Quijada, with a throbbing heart, obeyed, but Geronimo had no suspicion of what awaited him, and only wondered why his mother took so much trouble about his dress, since they were merely going hunting.  The tears glittering in her eyes he attributed to the anxiety which she often expressed when he rode with the hunters on the fiery young Andalusian which his father had given him.  He was then twelve years and a half old, but might easily have been taken for fourteen.  \"It was a splendid sight,\" Wolf went on, \"as the erect figure of the dark Don Luis, on his powerful black stallion, galloped beside the fair, handsome boy with his white skin and blue eyes, who managed his spirited dun horse so firmly and joyously.  \"Dona Magdalena and I followed them on our quiet bays.  Her lips moved constantly, and her right hand never stirred from the rosary at her belt while we were riding along the woodland paths.  \"To soothe her, I began to talk about the pieces of music which his Majesty had brought from Brussels, but she did not hear me. So I remained silent until the monastery glimmered through the trees. \"The blood left her cheeks, for at the same moment the thought came to us both that King Philip was taking him to the monks.  \"But we had scarcely time to confide what we feared to each other ere the blast of horns echoed from the forest.  \"Then, to calm the anxious mother's heart, I remarked, 'His Majesty would not have the horns sounded in that way if he were taking the pious brothers a new companion,' and Dona Magdalena's wan cheeks again flushed slightly.  \"The forest is cleared in front of the monastery, but it surrounds on all sides the open glade amid whose grass the meadow saffron was then growing thickly.  \"I can still see Geronimo as he swung himself from the saddle to gather some of the flowers.  His mother needed them as medicine for a poor woman in the village.  \"We stopped behind the last trees, where we had a good view of the glade. Don Luis left the boy to himself for a time; but when the blast of horns and the baying of the hounds sounded nearer, he ordered him, in the commanding tone he used in teaching him to ride, to remount.  \"Geronimo laughed, thrust the flowers hastily into his saddlebag, and with a bold leap vaulted on his horse's back.  \"A few minutes after, the King rode out of the forest.  \"He was mounted on a noble bay hunting charber, and wore a huntsman's dress.  \"No rider can hold a slender figure more erect.  \"His haughty head, with the fair, pointed beard, was carried slightly thrown back, which gave him an especially arrogant appearance.  \"When he saw Quijada, he raised his riding-whip with a significant gesture to his lips.  We, too, understood what it meant, and Don Luis knew him far better than we.  \"He greeted the King without the least constraint, as if he were merely a friend of noble birth, then beckoned to Geronimo, and the introduction was only the brief words, 'My son' and 'The Count of Flanders.'  \"The boy raised his little plumed hat with frank courtesy and, while bowing in the saddle, forced his dun horse to approach the King sideways. It was no easy matter, and seemed "]]]
