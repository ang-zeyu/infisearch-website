But he knew, and so did his wife, that the truth of his refusal lay in the fact that he could not bear to part with his youngest child--even though she visited at home each week-end.  Mrs. Brewster sided with Polly's ambition, and planned to visit her old home in Denver to see if she could find any friends who would prove to be desirable for Polly to associate with. The matter stood thus this lovely June day when the unexpected letter arrived.  The very unusual occurrence created enough interest for Polly to take her mind from the burro, so she ran swiftly towards the house while every possible correspondent she could think of passed through her thoughts. But she was as much at sea as ever, when she danced up the log steps leading directly to the kitchen.  \"Maw, Maw! Where are you--is there really a letter?\"  \"Yes--from Denver! But how is Noddy?\" replied Mrs. Brewster, coming to the kitchen door, holding a square envelope in her hand.  \"Dear little Noddy--she is all right now, Maw, but it looked mighty bad a bit of time back. I just had to pray and _pray_ with all my might, Maw--you know how!\" sighed Polly, taking the refined-looking letter from her mother without seeing it.  \"I never knew how I loved that dear little bundle of fuzz and flesh till I thought she was dead! Oh, I am so glad she will live that I don't care if I ever eat again or not!\"  Still holding the precious letter, Polly turned back to look at the barn where the object of her love was lapping up the gruel. Mrs. Brewster smiled indulgently at her intense young daughter, then reminded her of the unopened communication.  \"Dear me! So much excitement in one day--I don't see how I can quiet down again. But _who_ do you suppose would write to _me_?\" queried Polly, holding the envelope at arm's length and studying the hand-writing.  \"I'm not clairvoyant, Polly, so suppose you open it and see for yourself,\" laughed Mrs. Brewster.  \"Well, I hate to spoil this nice stationery but--here it goes!\" murmured Polly, severing an end of the envelope as if she was the executioner of an innocent victim.  \"See who it's from, Polly, while I dish up your dinner. Of course you don't care whether you ever eat again, but I would suggest that at least you strive to ward off starvation,\" remarked her mother, teasingly, as she took a well-filled plate from the oven.  \"Wh-h-y--of all things!\" gasped Polly, as she read the letter quickly.  Mrs. Brewster stood waiting to hear more, and Polly gave another hurried glance at the signature before explaining.  \"It's from Anne Stewart--the girl who used to teach at Bear Forks school that time the teacher got sick and had to leave for a few months. You know--the pretty one with the blonde hair that all the big scholars raved over?\" announced Polly.  \"Oh, yes! The one that you said was so happy to be in this wonderful country?\"  \"Yes, that's the girl! Well, guess what she writes me?\" And Polly waved the written sheet above her head.  \"Polly, have you been writing to her about High School?\" hurriedly asked Mrs. Brewster.  \"I never thought of that! Maybe we can plan it with her,\" returned Polly, her expression changing instantly to meet the new suggestion of her mother's.  \"Well, time enough to settle that question. Now tell me what she wrote,\" declared Mrs. Brewster, sighing with relief.  \"You'll be taken right off your feet, Maw, so you'd best sit down and listen,\" advised Polly, nibbling at a biscuit while she waited for her mother to be seated.  \"Now, I don't want you to shake your head or say a word, until I'm all through reading, Maw. It's something terribly surprising and goodness only knows why she asked _me_. I was so young when she taught school that she never noticed me much.\"  \"Yes, you were _so_ much younger two years ago, and you are so very ancient now!\" retorted Mrs. Brewster, trying to appear serious.  \"You know what I mean--but this isn't reading you the letter and I know just how you'll gasp when you hear her brother--listen and I'll read it.\"     CHAPTER II  A MOMENTOUS LETTER   Having seen that her mother was seated and ready for the surprise, Polly read:  \"Dear Miss Polly:  \"As you are fast reaching the boundary-line where girlhood and womanhood meet, I feel I must address you with the prefix that dignifies this stage of your life, although I seem to know you best as the rosy-cheeked little girl whose name of 'Polly' seemed to fit her exactly.  \"Perhaps your mother will be surprised that I did not write this letter to her, as most of it concerns her and her family directly. But I can best explain why I am writing to you by the following:  \"My brother Paul and your brother John are chums in college, you know, and I heard quite recently that you wished to prepare for High School in Denver this fall. When a friend in Chicago wrote me to find a good home in the mountains near Denver where I can stay with and tutor his daughters during the summer, I thought of the region about Bear Forks. Having been there myself, I know how wonderful the country and climate are.  \"If your mother and yourself think well of my proposition, I know I can help you a great deal, also, towards preparing you for High School, as I will have to devote a short time each day this summer in keeping Eleanor up in her studies.  \"Last year Eleanor and Barbara Maynard, of Chicago, came to board with us in Denver. These girls are acquainted with Paul and John, through their brother who is a class-mate of the boys. The younger girl, Eleanor, who is your age, had been very ill and the doctor ordered her to Denver because of the wonderful air. Her sister, who is about my age, accompanied her. The father, Mr. Maynard, engaged me to tutor Eleanor, or Nolla we call her, during her stay in Denver, as she was backward in lessons.  \"We three became very good friends and when the girls went back to Chicago, I missed their companionship very much. I had a letter from the father last week, asking me to find a mountain resort for this summer where he could send the girls, as Nolla needs the invigorating air and simple life of the Rockies. She is organically sound but not strong enough to stand city air and life.  \"Mr. Maynard has been through the Bear Forks country and when I wrote suggesting a ranch there, he immediately wired me to settle the matter at once. To-day I had a letter from the mother who cannot go with her daughters for the summer, so she asked me to go with them, more as a friend and adviser than as a tutor. My expenses will be paid, and my salary for tutoring Nolla will be a blessing to help Paul through his third year's term of the college course.  \"I know your brother is away with Tom Latimer on some practice work with a survey crew, so his room is vacant this summer. Then too, I was told by John that you had a small spare room back of the kitchen, so that three girls could have comfortable quarters. If, by any chance, your mother would consent to take us in for the summer, I could help you with your preparatory lessons for High School next term, at the same time that I coach Nolla. And I will agree for myself and the two girls that we will not expect any other than your usual home-life.  \"This unexpected request may meet with disapproval and refusal by your family, but do not let one of the causes be on the grounds of the extra work we might create, because we do not want any fussing, whatever, but we do want to be treated as members of the family--to do our share of anything that needs to be done.  \"Mr. Maynard wishes his girls to live in the outdoors as much as possible, so we will not be in your mother's way. I certainly hope your father and mother will allow us to come, and I can promise you that you will enjoy these girls very much. The terms are of no consequence, Mr. Maynard said, as he is ready to pay anything to give Nolla a quiet home and the life she needs.  \"I trust you can persuade your mother to try us, at any rate, and so, hoping for a favorable reply to this letter,  \"I am your sincere friend,                                    ANNE STEWART.\"  While Polly read the letter aloud, her mother thought rapidly. She had the picture of a charming girl who had often met John Brewster at social gatherings during the term she taught the children at Bear Forks. Now her brother Paul was one of John's chums at college. Perhaps this girl had visited at Chicago, and perhaps John had visited her home at Denver--but he had never said a word about it. It was very evident that this girl had an intimate acquaintance with the home-life at Pebbly Pit, and this knowledge must have reached her through John. Hence John and she must be very well acquainted. John would doubtless marry some day, but his mother did not care to see him entangled before he had launched his bark on the waters of his ambition. If he was touched by one of Cupid's darts to fancy himself in love with his chum's pretty sister, it was good judgment for his mother to know all there was to be known about the girl. Not that the letter confessed this state of affairs, but the mother feared that such must be the case--for who could resist loving her handsome, clever boy?  \"Maw! I _said_--Anne Stewart is perfectly lovely!\"  \"Oh, yes, Polly! So I believe,\" replied Mrs. Brewster, in an absent-minded manner.  \"Well! If you'd let them come here I would love it!\"  \"You can't judge beforehand, Polly. Having three city strangers come suddenly to live at a ranch where city manners are unknown, will turn things upside-down, you know.\"  \"But you see, Maw, the teacher offers to help me with lessons so I can pass for High School in the fall,\" Polly reminded her mother.  \"I can do as much for you, dear, without the care of strangers,\" remonstrated Mrs. Brewster, who would not commit herself until she had had time to weigh all things carefully.  \"Then I s'pose"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6001"],["title","Polly of Pebbly Pit (#2)"],["body"," you intend refusing this request!\" pouted the disappointed girl.  \"I wish to think over the situation most wisely before we reply to the letter. Now finish your dinner and do the dishes. I am going to take my mending to the side porch.\"  Polly did as she was told but her imagination strayed to Denver and Chicago, as she tried to picture Barbara and Eleanor Maynard with Anne Stewart, visiting Pebbly Pit that summer. Meantime, Mrs. Brewster considered the _pros_ and _cons_ of the problem. If this Anne Stewart proved to be the sort of wife John needed, it would be advisable to have her know her future family-in-law. If she was not desirable, it would be discovered during the weeks she lived under the same roof with John's mother. But should it transpire that there was no cause for worry about John and this young teacher, she would still prove to be a good friend for Polly to know in case the child attended school in Denver the following term. Mrs. Brewster had almost decided to speak favorably to Polly of the plan, when the girl joined her on the porch.  \"Do you suppose Daddy will mind having so many young folks about the place--that is, if you will let them come?\"  \"I'm sure your Paw will be happy to give you pleasure, and you know how glad he is to have young people visiting here, rather than having you leave home to visit others,\" remarked Mrs. Brewster, slowly drawing the yarn through a hole in a sock.  \"While I washed the dishes, I wondered if he would say anything to you about the extra work, the three girls will make?\" said Polly, trying to \"feel\" her mother out.  \"That will be his main objection, I think. He had planned for me to visit my old friends in Denver, this summer, but this new departure will make it impossible for me to be away from here.\"  \"Oh, Maw, if you want to go away, don't let these girls spoil your plans!\" cried Polly, contritely.  \"I really had not thought of my own pleasure in visiting old friends at Denver, Polly, but I had planned to see about your residence this winter should you attend school there. I want you to board with a family that can offer you the proper atmosphere. If this young teacher proves to be nice, she will know all I needed to find out about the school and a boarding house, and I will not have to leave my beloved home at all.\"  \"Well, then, it all depends on what Daddy will say!\" cried Polly, joyously. \"I do wish he'd hurry in.\"  \"He must have known your wishes, Polly; I see him coming towards the house,\" laughed Mrs. Brewster.  Polly leaned over the hand-rail of the porch to watch her father coming nearer and nearer. Then, when she thought he was in hailing distance, she shouted:  \"Daddy! Do hurry and hear the news--came in my letter!\" And the missive was waved back and forth to urge the rancher to greater speed.  Mr. Brewster reached the porch and whipped off his wide sombrero to mop his warm forehead. \"Well, Maw, did Poll tell you about Noddy? Ah tell you! Our Polly is some doctor, all right!\"  As the rancher chuckled over his words, Polly felt she had been guilty of neglect, for she had quite forgotten to ask how Noddy was. Mrs. Brewster smiled as she continued her darning.  \"Who's with Noddy now--did you give Jeb careful instructions, Paw?\" anxiously queried Polly.  \"Noddy's sleeping as peacefully as a babe, so you-all needn't worry any more. Now tell me all about the wonderful letter.\"  \"Sam, do you remember that golden-haired young lady from Denver, who took Miss Shalp's place at Bear Forks school for a few months?\" quickly asked Mrs. Brewster.  The note of anxiety in the query was not overlooked by the rancher, but he answered indifferently--to all appearances:  \"Shore thing, wife. Could any one forget such a nice girl in a hurry?\"  \"Well, Sam, the letter's from her--Anne Stewart is her name.\"  \"Don't tell him what! Let me read it, Maw!\" cried Polly.  So the letter was read again and the moment it was concluded Polly and Mrs. Brewster looked fearfully at Mr. Brewster, for they both expected violent objections from him.  But the rancher stood boring a hole with the toe of his boot down through the soft grass sod, while he seemed to study the cobbler's handiwork. After a few moments of tense silence, he looked up and laughed heartily.  \"Who'd have thought it, Mary? You, young looking enough to pass for a blushing bride but having a son old enough to think of a sweet-heart. And little Poll here, trying to bamboozle us to let her go away to school. Ah, well!\"  Polly gazed from father to mother and back again. \"What has John got to do with this letter? Gracious, he isn't thinking of a wife, I hope!\"  Her parents laughed at her perplexity, and Mr. Brewster explained satisfactorily to her question:  \"I was thinking of the four pretty girls we'd have at the ranch all summer, if John comes home to choose one of them.\"  \"Oh, Daddy! Then you'll have them come?\" cried Polly, at the same time jumping at her father to throw her arms about his neck.  \"On one condition--yes. That is: a gal to do the chores for Maw, so she can look after such a handful of trouble as three new ready-made daughters will make for her.\"  \"A hired girl! Why, Sam, how you talk. What could I ever do with help in such a small house? Besides, Anne Stewart says they will help with the work,\" objected Mrs. Brewster.  \"That's my only condition! You're not going to slave for a lot of city girls if I know it. Why, they won't know how to hold a kitchen knife, let alone cook for the family,\" replied Mr. Brewster.  \"I'll agree at once, Sam, because I know there isn't a girl or woman to hire within fifty miles of Oak Creek,\" laughed Mrs. Brewster.  \"Then Polly can answer the letter as she likes, and I will hunt up a gal. You said it: you'd agree to hire help if one can be found!\" quickly came from the rancher.  \"Sam, you took this occasion to have your own about hired help,\" laughed his wife, shaking her head deprecatingly.  \"You never would listen before, but now you've got to!\" said Mr. Brewster, triumphantly.  \"Polly, you can run in and answer that letter as soon as you like,\" hinted Mrs. Brewster, and the girl eagerly obeyed.  While she wrote the answer over and over till it met with her approval, her parents exchanged confidences regarding John and this young teacher, but Polly never dreamed of such fears.  The letter that left Pebbly Pit the following day was the first thread woven in the warp and woof of two young lives--Eleanor Maynard in Chicago and Polly Brewster in the Rockies. Had the reply been other than it was, would these two girls have met and experienced the interesting schooldays, college years, and business careers that they enjoyed through becoming acquainted that summer at Pebbly Pit?     CHAPTER III  PREPARING FOR THE UNKNOWN   The letter sent from Pebbly Pit to Anne Stewart was forwarded by the latter to the Maynard girls in Chicago. It was eagerly read aloud to Mrs. Maynard by Barbara. Reaching the paragraph in the letter where Mrs. Brewster asked Anne Stewart if she thought five dollars a week for the board of each would be asking too much, Barbara dropped the sheet of paper and gasped. An expression of incredulity appeared on the faces of the mother and daughter, while Eleanor laughed outright.  \"Just fancy! Five dollars a week!\" she cried, throwing herself back on the cushions of the divan.  \"It must be a mistake! I trust it isn't meant for fifty a week! That is about the price a good hotel would charge, but I had hoped this place would be more reasonable. However, I am quite sure that figure five is a mistake; no one can possibly give meals at that rate, no matter how meager the fare may be!\" declared Mrs. Maynard.  \"The writing is plain enough and so is the figure '5,' mother,\" returned Barbara, referring again to the letter, then handing it to her mother.  Mrs. Maynard adjusted her lorgnette and studied the figure given. \"It _does_ seem to be five, without a doubt!\" admitted she.  \"Oh, well! it really doesn't matter much what the price is just as long as we have a good time this summer!\" exclaimed Eleanor.  \"But, Nolla, dear, it does matter! Your father is dreadfully upset about our plans. He says my Newport season will cost far more than I fancied it would, and you two girls going to a mountain resort like this is an extra cost. He will have to be away all summer on important business connected with the bank, and _that_ will cost extra money. Altogether, he feels anything but indifferent,\" sighed Mrs. Maynard, handing the letter back to Barbara.  \"Well, we are not responsible for father's worries over the bank's loans, but we _are_ concerned about the style and quality of meals to be served at this Brewster place for five dollars a week,\" scorned Barbara.  \"I don't believe Anne Stewart would take us to a place where anything was horrid and cheap! She knows what's good as well as we do!\" defended Eleanor, who was eager to go to this mountain ranch.  \"Nolla is quite right, Bob. Anne is too particular to engage board in an undesirable house or hotel!\" added Mrs. Maynard.  \"Besides, these Brewsters have a farm, you know, and I suppose they raise lots of things that we have to pay such awful prices for--eggs, chickens, butter and vegetables,\" added Eleanor.  Mrs. Maynard and Barbara looked with admiration at the young girl, for that was an idea they had not thought of!  \"Of course, that's why they can board us so reasonably! Then, too, I suppose they do their own marketing for other items of food, such as delicacies and supplies from the baker's! It does make a difference in the accounts, you see, when one markets!\" ventured Barbara, glancing at her mother who never bothered about anything connected with the housekeeping--leaving it all for the servants to do.  \"Now, Bob, don't criticize your mother's methods. I can't drudge about the house and take charge of the Social Clubs and Welfare Work as well,\" complained Mrs. Maynard.  \"Of course not, Bob! Besides, mother never did know "]]]
