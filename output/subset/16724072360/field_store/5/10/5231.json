Five doti, or $7.50, will purchase a slave in the markets of Ujiji that will fetch in Zanzibar $30. Ordinary menslaves may be purchased for $6 which would sell for $25 on the coast. We will say he purchases slaves to the full extent of his means--after deducting $1,500 expenses of carriage to Ujiji and back--viz. $3,500, the slaves--464 in number, at $7-50 per head--would realize $13,920 at Zanzibar! Again, let us illustrate trade in ivory. A merchant takes $5,000 to Ujiji, and after deducting $1,500 for expenses to Ujiji, and back to Zanzibar, has still remaining $3,500 in cloth and beads, with which he purchases ivory. At Ujiji ivory is bought at $20 the frasilah, or 35 lbs., by which he is enabled with $3,500 to collect 175 frasilahs, which, if good ivory, is worth about $60 per frasilah at Zanzibar. The merchant thus finds that he has realized $10,500 net profit! Arab traders have often done better than this, but they almost always have come back with an enormous margin of profit.  The next people to the Banyans in power in Zanzibar are the Mohammedan Hindis. Really it has been a debateable subject in my mind whether the Hindis are not as wickedly determined to cheat in trade as the Banyans. But, if I have conceded the palm to the latter, it has been done very reluctantly. This tribe of Indians can produce scores of unconscionable rascals where they can show but one honest merchant. One of the honestest among men, white or black, red or yellow, is a Mohammedan Hindi called Tarya Topan. Among the Europeans at Zanzibar, he has become a proverb for honesty, and strict business integrity. He is enormously wealthy, owns several ships and dhows, and is a prominent man in the councils of Seyd Burghash. Tarya has many children, two or three of whom are grown-up sons, whom he has reared up even as he is himself. But Tarya is but a representative of an exceedingly small minority.  The Arabs, the Banyans, and the Mohammedan Hindis, represent the higher and the middle classes. These classes own the estates, the ships, and the trade. To these classes bow the half-caste and the negro.  The next most important people who go to make up the mixed population of this island are the negroes. They consist of the aborigines, Wasawahili, Somalis, Comorines, Wanyamwezi, and a host of tribal representatives of Inner Africa.  To a white stranger about penetrating Africa, it is a most interesting walk through the negro quarters of the Wanyamwezi and the Wasawahili. For here he begins to learn the necessity of admitting that negroes are men, like himself, though of a different colour; that they have passions and prejudices, likes and dislikes, sympathies and antipathies, tastes and feelings, in common with all human nature. The sooner he perceives this fact, and adapts himself accordingly, the easier will be his journey among the several races of the interior. The more plastic his nature, the more prosperous will be his travels.  Though I had lived some time among the negroes of our Southern States, my education was Northern, and I had met in the United States black men whom I was proud to call friends. I was thus prepared to admit any black man, possessing the attributes of true manhood or any good qualities, to my friendship, even to a brotherhood with myself; and to respect him for such, as much as if he were of my own colour and race. Neither his colour, nor any peculiarities of physiognomy should debar him with me from any rights he could fairly claim as a man. \"Have these men--these black savages from pagan Africa,\" I asked myself, \"the qualities which make man loveable among his fellows? Can these men--these barbarians--appreciate kindness or feel resentment like myself?\" was my mental question as I travelled through their quarters and observed their actions. Need I say, that I was much comforted in observing that they were as ready to be influenced by passions, by loves and hates, as I was myself; that the keenest observation failed to detect any great difference between their nature and my own?  The negroes of the island probably number two-thirds of the entire population. They compose the working-class, whether enslaved or free. Those enslaved perform the work required on the plantations, the estates, and gardens of the landed proprietors, or perform the work of carriers, whether in the country or in the city. Outside the city they may be seen carrying huge loads on their heads, as happy as possible, not because they are kindly treated or that their work is light, but because it is their nature to be gay and light-hearted, because they, have conceived neither joys nor hopes which may not be gratified at will, nor cherished any ambition beyond their reach, and therefore have not been baffled in their hopes nor known disappointment.  Within the city, negro carriers may be heard at all hours, in couples, engaged in the transportation of clove-bags, boxes of merchandise, &c., from store to \"godown\" and from \"go-down\" to the beach, singing a kind of monotone chant for the encouragement of each other, and for the guiding of their pace as they shuffle through the streets with bare feet. You may recognise these men readily, before long, as old acquaintances, by the consistency with which they sing the tunes they have adopted. Several times during a day have I heard the same couple pass beneath the windows of the Consulate, delivering themselves of the same invariable tune and words. Some might possibly deem the songs foolish and silly, but they had a certain attraction for me, and I considered that they were as useful as anything else for the purposes they were intended.  The town of Zanzibar, situate on the south-western shore of the island, contains a population of nearly one hundred thousand inhabitants; that of the island altogether I would estimate at not more than two hundred thousand inhabitants, including all races.  The greatest number of foreign vessels trading with this port are American, principally from New York and Salem. After the American come the German, then come the French and English. They arrive loaded with American sheeting, brandy, gunpowder, muskets, beads, English cottons, brass-wire, china-ware, and other notions, and depart with ivory, gum-copal, cloves, hides, cowries, sesamum, pepper, and cocoa-nut oil.  The value of the exports from this port is estimated at $3,000,000, and the imports from all countries at $3,500,000.  The Europeans and Americans residing in the town of Zanzibar are either Government officials, independent merchants, or agents for a few great mercantile houses in Europe and America.  The climate of Zanzibar is not the most agreeable in the world. I have heard Americans and Europeans condemn it most heartily. I have also seen nearly one-half of the white colony laid up in one day from sickness. A noxious malaria is exhaled from the shallow inlet of Malagash, and the undrained filth, the garbage, offal, dead mollusks, dead pariah dogs, dead cats, all species of carrion, remains of men and beasts unburied, assist to make Zanzibar a most unhealthy city; and considering that it it ought to be most healthy, nature having pointed out to man the means, and having assisted him so far, it is most wonderful that the ruling prince does not obey the dictates of reason.  The bay of Zanzibar is in the form of a crescent, and on the south-western horn of it is built the city. On the east Zanzibar is bounded almost entirely by the Malagash Lagoon, an inlet of the sea. It penetrates to at least two hundred and fifty yards of the sea behind or south of Shangani Point. Were these two hundred and fifty yards cut through by a ten foot ditch, and the inlet deepened slightly, Zanzibar would become an island of itself, and what wonders would it not effect as to health and salubrity! I have never heard this suggestion made, but it struck me that the foreign consuls resident at Zanzibar might suggest this work to the Sultan, and so get the credit of having made it as healthy a place to live in as any near the equator. But apropos of this, I remember what Capt. Webb, the American Consul, told me on my first arrival, when I expressed to him my wonder at the apathy and inertness of men born with the indomitable energy which characterises Europeans and Americans, of men imbued with the progressive and stirring instincts of the white people, who yet allow themselves to dwindle into pallid phantoms of their kind, into hypochondriacal invalids, into hopeless believers in the deadliness of the climate, with hardly a trace of that daring and invincible spirit which rules the world.  \"Oh,\" said Capt. Webb, \"it is all very well for you to talk about energy and all that kind of thing, but I assure you that a residence of four or five years on this island, among such people as are here, would make you feel that it was a hopeless task to resist the influence of the example by which the most energetic spirits are subdued, and to which they must submit in time, sooner or later. We were all terribly energetic when we first came here, and struggled bravely to make things go on as we were accustomed to have them at home, but we have found that we were knocking our heads against granite walls to no purpose whatever. These fellows--the Arabs, the Banyans, and the Hindis--you can't make them go faster by ever so much scolding and praying, and in a very short time you see the folly of fighting against the unconquerable. Be patient, and don't fret, that is my advice, or you won't live long here.\"  There were three or four intensely busy men, though, at Zanzibar, who were out at all hours of the day. I know one, an American; I fancy I hear the quick pit-pat of his feet on the pavement beneath the Consulate, his cheery voice ringing the salutation, \"Yambo!\" to every one he met; and he had lived at Zanzibar twelve years.  I know another, one of the sturdiest of Scotchmen, a most pleasant-mannered and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51570"],["title","Cry Snooker (#1)"],["body","DEGREE HOPE SERVE     YOU AGAIN T C FRUMP V-P IN CHARGE OF SNAFU  George dropped the telegram.  \"What are you waiting for, man?\" Charlie said. \"Call Rosy, will ya?\"  \"She won't answer,\" George said. \"She thinks I don't love her.\"  \"Come on! We better get home before she starts making dinner.\"  They ran down to the Park-O-Port.  \"Ahm sorry, Mistuh Charlie,\" the snappy attendant said. \"Caint git yuh cah now. It's on de top floh behind seven lines of cahs an _dey_ aint comin out till five like every weekday sept Satterdays, Sunneys an holidays.\"  \"Give him a tip and let's get a taxi,\" George said. He ran into the street just in time to flag a cab.  George tossed the cabbie ten dollars. \"Step on it. It may be a matter of life and death.\"  \"I could have called Beth,\" Charlie said.  \"We'll get there almost as fast.\"  They zoomed through the underpass and turned onto the freeway. A cycle cop emerged from behind a Schlitz billboard and took after them, his siren wailing.  \"Never mind the cop,\" George said.  The cabbie hunched forward and gripped the wheel. \"Mister,\" he said, \"I've been waiting for a chance like this.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The cop gained on them and as he came abreast George grew confused. He saw the cop's big sun glasses shining like the eyes of a wasp and his hat snapping in the wind. George had never broken the law in his life. He had a deep respect for the police, preservers of law and order.  The cop motioned the cabbie to pull over. The cab zoomed over a crest on the freeway and ripped down the slope with marked increase in speed.  George rolled down the window and flapped his arms. \"My wife!\" he yelled.  The cop cut the siren. His hand went down to his holster.  \"My wife!\" George yelled. \"Pressure cooker.\"  The cop grinned and nodded to say he understood, and roaring ahead waved them to follow. The siren started up again.  They lost him when they turned off the freeway and raced past the supermarket to their street. Sunnydale looked peaceful in the afternoon. George's house came in view. He heaved a sigh of relief as the cabbie pulled to a stop.  \"Rosy!\" he yelled, dashing up the walk.  He flung open the door and stopped. The house was silent except for Rosy's voice in the kitchen. She was counting backwards:  \"Five ... four ... three....\"  \"Rosy!\"  \"One ... zero.\"  A steaming hiss sounded in the kitchen. In a moment it rose to a howling pitch. There was a tremendous crash and a tremor shook the plaster from the walls.  In the settling dust Timmy crawled out of the kitchen with a pot on his head.  In the kitchen Rosy sat on the floor, clutching the instruction booklet.  \"Now see what you did, George!\"  \"What _I_ did?\"  \"Barging in like that,\" Rosy said, tears of frustration streaking her dusty cheeks. \"I must have pressed the wrong button.\"  Beside her on the floor lay the Touch Command Control Panel. Its colored lights blinked on and off like a pinball machine.  Charlie came into the kitchen with Timmy in his arms.  \"Oh my gosh!\" Rosy cried, looking up at the ceiling. A hole was ripped out in the roof and through it they could see God's blue sky.         *       *       *       *       *  George grabbed the control panel and they ran outside. They saw the snooker describing a lovely ellipse over Sunnydale.  \"My roast!\" Rosy wailed.  \"It seems to be waiting for orders,\" Charlie said.  \"Have to get it down,\" George said, setting the control panel on the lawn. \"Before it slams into some airplane.\"  He pressed a large red button. The snooker wobbled for a moment, then broke its orbit and dove for Charlie's house. It smashed in at the back and came out the front. Beth ran out in a bathrobe, screaming.  \"Stop it!\" Charlie yelled, flinging himself at the control panel and pressing a yellow button.  The snooker resumed its orbit, then wobbled and dove into every second or third house in the street, working the houses from side to side.  Women ran out and stood dazed, clutching their children and watching the snooker.  Desperately George pressed the blue button. The snooker resumed its orbit, wobbled, flew once over the street as if to check what all needed to be hit, then slammed through the whole length of houses from end to end.  Two houses caught fire. Charlie pressed the largest button of all, the green one. The snooker righted itself and flew out over the town. Wherever it struck a small cloud of dust rose in the air.  Four fire-engines turned into the street. Three of them turned around and raced back to downtown.  They lost sight of the snooker for a while. All they saw was the clouds of dust mushrooming all over town, and here and there a fire. When the snooker came in view again, it was rising toward a jet plane circling overhead.  \"It'll get hit!\" Charlie said.  George pressed all four buttons.  The snooker wobbled for a moment. Then it seemed to shake off the confused commands and rose into the plane's path. The plane veered. The snooker turned after it and rose steeply. Then it dove and slammed down through the fuselage.  They all stared as the plane crashed into the supermarket. Above them the pilot floated down in a parachute. He seemed to see the blinking lights of the control panel and worked the chute calmly. He landed through the hole in Rosy's kitchen. He came out of the house eating a piece of cold chicken.  He wore an air-research uniform with a belt slanted across his chest and high shiny boots, and in his hand he carried a Rommel whip.         *       *       *       *       *  He strode up to George and looked down at the blinking control panel. With the toe of his boot he pushed a black button in the lower left corner and squinted up at the sky, chewing the chicken. The snooker obeyed instantly and resumed its original elliptical orbit.  \"_Ja_,\" he said. \"Very goot.\" He gazed out over the town, the clouds of dust and the fires burning. \"Excellent,\" he said, tossing the chicken bone over his back. It hit Charlie in the face.  \"You must be the dismantling expert,\" George said hopefully.  \"I am more. I am the infentor of pressure snooker.\" He noticed Rosy and Beth. \"Ladies,\" he said, clicking his heels and bowing. \"I haf the honor to present myself. Vernher von Wissenschaft, at your serfice.\"  \"Likewise,\" Rosy said. \"Could you get my pressure cooker down before it does any more damage?\"  \"Ha ha!\" Vernher von Wissenschaft laughed. \"Very goot! Pressure _cooker_! Hm, goot way to deceive brutal enemy. Export five hoondred tausend pressure cookers to enemy homes. _Ja_, I like it.\"  \"You don't understand,\" Rosy said. \"My roast will be ruined if you don't get it down pretty soon.\"  \"You cook rosht in my infention?\"  \"Biggest roast you ever saw,\" Rosy said. She hugged George. \"You see, this is our wedding anniversary and I'm dying to know how it came out.\"  \"Rosht?\" he mused, following the snooker with his eyes and licking his fingers thoughtfully. \"Why not? Maybe I make deal on side with Amerikan Kitchen Appliance Inkorporated. If rosht comes out goot.\" He looked at the broken houses and the firemen spraying the fires. \"_Ja_,\" he decided, \"kill two experiments mit one snooker.\"  He waited for the snooker to pass overhead. Then he gave the control panel a sharp kick with his heel, breaking it in two. The snooker wobbled and exploded. Bits of steel whirred out over Sunnydale. A brown cloud appeared above them and in a moment they were all drenched in a rainfall of roast beef.  By the time the gravy hit them it had cooled enough to taste.  \"It's wonderful!\" Rosy said.  \"Chust a minute,\" Vernher von Wissenschaft said. \"Scientific experiment not so fast.\" He removed a shred of roast beef from behind his ear and chewed.  \"Isn't it good?\" Rosy asked anxiously.  Vernher von Wissenschaft finished tasting. He thought a moment, stretched his face. \"Excellent,\" he said.  \"Do you _really_ like it?\"  \"Ja, excellent.\" He held up a finger. \"Perhaps,\" he suggested, \"two more grains pepper.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Two weeks later, when all the fires in the town had been put out and the damage assessed, a great banquet was held in the Emperor Room to honor George. In the street a huge crowd of well-wishers waited to greet him as he came out. The Emperor Room could accommodate only the town's important personages; there were so many of them that some of the best families did not bribe the mayor in time to get a seat.  But George managed to get standing room for Mr. Perkins and Mr. Zungenspiel.  Beside George at the table of honor sat Charlie. Next to him Vernher von Wissenschaft in a splendid uniform, cracking his Rommel whip from time to time. Everybody who was anybody was there: the Police Commissioner, the Gambling Czar, the District Attorney, the Teamsters' Boss, Senator Smiley, Coroner Schadenfrohm, the Election Commissioner, the Slum Owner, the Housing Inspector.  \"Never before,\" the mayor orated, \"has so much damage been done by such a little man in such a short time.\"  Vernher cracked his whip. \"Very goot,\" he said, turning to George. \"Rhetoric, you know.\"  \"The national economy,\" the mayor continued, \"was in danger of imminent collapse ever since our old-fashioned P.O.--planned obsolescence--reached a point of no return. We had to produce more and more until the market was glutted. Of course we would not sell so much as a toaster to our brutal enemy.\" (Applause.)  Vernher cracked his whip. \"Very goot.\"  \"But now,\" the mayor said, smiling at George, \"the solution to our economic impasse has been found! This young man had the daring vision to contribute a brilliant new concept to our economics. S. D.--Senseless Destruction!\" (Applause.)  Vernher cracked his whip. \"Excellent.\"  The mayor raised his arms for silence. \"I have good news,\" he said. \"Congress has just voted one billion dollars for Senseless Destruction research!\" (Wild applause.)  Vernher cracked his whip six times.  \"I can promise you, ladies and gentlemen,\" the mayor continued, \"what"]]]
