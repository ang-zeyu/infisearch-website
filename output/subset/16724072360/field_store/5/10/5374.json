Her first word was her last: \"’Tis no good for ’ee to think anything about it.\"  Byron was helpless.  He could not win her to his will, neither could he break her.  She was capable, as she let him see, of separating from him. If he appealed to the hinds, they would side with her.  Her cousins at Hember and St. Cadic, the neighbours in the adjacent valleys, would take her part.  Turning the matter over, however, he perceived that time, by giving Sabina fresh interests, fresh cares, might prove his friend.  Nurslings tie the mother to the house and when the babies came his wife would have her hands full.  She must let go what she could not hold; and he would be ready to pick up, bit by bit, what she let fall.  In this hope he settled to his new life.  It was unthinkable that he should attempt to farm Higher Polnevas, when his mind was filled with Wastralls.  Of a brooding nature, through which at times flames of emotion broke, he was content to spend his days thinking out and dwelling on the changes he would make when his opportunity came. Sabina’s farming, cautious and well-considered, chafed him.  He wanted the land to bring forth a hundredfold where she now gave a mere return. He was her lover asking of her all that she could give, eager only to have the exploiting of her possibilities.  To make her fruitful was to be his work.  He saw the seed swell in her bosom, the silent marvel of growth, the harvest that should reward his husbandry; and, because out of the heart the mouth speaketh, when he talked it was of intensive farming, of the money that lay in sugar-beet, strawberries, asparagus, of market-gardening and the use of glass.  Thereby he damaged his cause; for Sabina, listening, came to the conclusion that she had married an unpractical dreamer.  If he believed in his theories why did he not rent land and prove them?  That he only talked, satisfied her that she had been right in her refusal to let him farm Wastralls and her grip on the land tightened.  The kindly fields deserved better of her than that she should put them at the mercy of a dreamer.  Whether or no the man’s life that she led did her disservice, it is certain that no children came to modify the situation.  In the loft, the carved wooden cradle lay with only the wind to set it a-rock; below, the rooms were as empty of new life as is a whispering conch.  The bustle of the farm was like the swish of water about a rock islet, that little spot of sterility and stagnation at the heart of multitudinous life. Sabina, who had natural instincts, who had mothered a bibulous father and many a bit of life from the fields and hedges, was disappointed; but her feeling was mild compared with that of her husband.  His children were to have delivered Wastralls into his hand, assuaged at last the long ache of his passion; but the years turned on their axes, going as they had come.  At first Byron bore himself with a good courage. After the unprofitable days of his seafaring it was enough to watch the tamarisk stems warming into red life, to spend the daylight wandering over the well-known ground, to return at night to the grey house on its shelf of rock.  If, after a while, these delights palled, it was because they led nowhither.  Meanwhile, under Sabina’s judicious management, the farm prospered. Neither cared to spend, the one because she had no wants, the other because what he desired could not be bought.  With every year the bank stocking grew heavier, also the man’s heart; and every year found his thoughts fixed more bitterly upon his disappointment.  Sabina saw but without understanding. Her man was moody, foolish too with his perpetual harping on his rights, but she was not thereby alienated, for, wise or unreasonable, he was her man.  Though she envied Tom his houseful of daughters and Constantine his big sons, her own lack left her the more leisure to care for her husband’s comfort.  The standard of living at Wastralls was higher than that of the surrounding farms.  Byron ate according to his fancy and lay soft; was given indeed those things to which he was indifferent, and denied that after which he hungered.  \"I’m kep’ like a prize bullock,\" he said morosely, \"when what I want is to be workin’ and doin’ for meself.\"  \"Well, my dear, ’oo told you not to work?  There’s plenty to do, there’s that four-acre field, why don’t yer go and plough up that, ’stead of in ’ere mumpin’ about?\"  \"As though I was yer ’ind?\"  \"What, still wantin’ to be maister?\"  \"Iss, an’ shall be till I die.\"  \"Now look ’ere.  If you want money to buy Polnevas you can ’av it, but Wastralls you will never ’av.\"  \"Well, if I can’t ’av Wastralls I won’t ’av nothing; but you mark my words\"—he bent towards her and brought one hand with a thump into the palm of the other—\"if I can’t ’av it by ’itch, I will by crook.\"  \"Not so long as I live then, any’ow.\"  Byron was slightly underhung, a formation which gives the face a look of strength and purpose.  \"We shall see, some day, which of us is the strongest of the two.\"  The woman, happy in her work and with her main affection satisfied, could answer with reasonable good-humour: \"Well, my dear feller, ’tis my land and I must do my duty by it.  ’Tis I’m responsible, not you, to the folks up yonder,\" and a movement of her bright head indicated the burial-ground at Church Town.  \"I’m sorry you’re disappointed, but I can’t ’elp it.\"  \"Oh, hang it—sorry?\"  \"Well, I be sorry.  I’d like for ’ee to ’av everything to make yer ’appy; but Wastralls I can’t give.\"  She smiled at him in her friendly fashion, a sweet inviting smile.  \"I do my best to make it up to yer in other ways and that you know.\"  \"Iss, I want bread and you do give me a stone.\"  He turned away, leaving her, as ever, uncomprehending. It was impossible for her to think of him as other than a child, who for his own sake must be denied and prevented, who was hers to care for and, in ways that could not harm him, to indulge.  The truth to her, as to so many of us, would have been unbelievable.  The break-up of the situation was due to an accident. Sabina had driven a young horse to the fair at St. Columb Major and this animal, excited by the unwonted traffic, the smells and the noise, became unmanageable.  Plunging down the hill, he came into collision with a heavy van.  The prancing feet slipped and he fell, shooting his driver over the shafts. Though clear of horse and cart, she was flung with considerable violence against the front wheel of the van.  This startled the van horses and the heavy lumbersome creatures, with a prodigious clatter, started up the street.  Sabina, rendered unconscious by the blow she had received, had fallen between the wheels and the van, lurching forward, passed over her.  It was thought at first that she was killed but the crushed woman who, later that afternoon, was admitted to the little hospital at Stowe, was still breathing.  As the case seemed hopeless, the husband was sent for, and Byron, in a ferment of excitement, came pounding in on the heels of the messenger.  His horse was in a lather when he checked him at the hospital gate.  \"Poor Sabina, poor old girl, it was a terrible thing for her to die as she lived; away from home like that.  No doubt ’er ’ead was full of the farmin’, never once thought of dyin’, but the Lorrd would be merciful.\"  \"If she’s goin’ to die, don’t ’ee keep it from me,\" he said to Dr. Derek, who was in charge of the case.  \"I’d rather knaw the worst.\"  \"And,\" as he explained to the neighbours, on his return home, after being allowed to glance at the unconscious face on the pillow, \"the poor doctor ’ee couldn’t give me no encouragement.\"                                   *CHAPTER II*   The sight of Sabina, her florid face grey against the white bandages, her pale lips open to facilitate the drawing of difficult breath, had convinced her husband that she could not possibly recover.  That evening he called the hinds together, told them what had happened, and for the first time gave them their orders.  As he went back into the house, old George Biddick, who had been many years on the farm, and was of a noticing disposition, drew the attention of a new-come labourer to the receding figure.  \"Speaks as though ’e’d been maister all the time, don’t ’e?  An’ carries ’isself pretty straight, too, considerin’ as ’e’m bowed wi’ grief.\"  \"I don’t s’pose ’e realize things yet,\" said Jim, a Rosevear from across the hills.  \"Must ’av been tarr’ble shock for’n.\"  The other man glanced sideways out of small brown eyes, and gave a non-committal grunt.  He was queerly shaped, with a high-shouldered short body and long legs and, being related to most of the cottagers, was known generally as \"Uncle George!\"  \"Dunno so much about that.  Missus is so strong as a dunkey,\" he said, as he returned to his work of bedding down the horses, \"an’ she may chate the crows yet.\"  But Jim Rosevear was not listening, his thoughts had run before him up the road, to where, at the stone stile, a maid would be waiting.  The rest of the world might be concerned with death; but he was young and his concern was with life, more life.  When, on the following day, Byron rode over to the hospital, he was told that his wife still breathed; but that an operation had become necessary, an operation which it was scarcely possible she could survive.  He found it difficult to understand why it must be.  \"Why punish ’er so?  Wouldn’t it be better to let ’er die quiet than to ’ack ’er about?\"  The wheel of the van had gone over both legs, crushing together bone and flesh and the surgeon proposed to amputate.  The limbs were injured beyond hope of saving; and it was explained that their removal might give the patient a chance.  \"Do you think then, sir,\" said the anxious husband, \"that she’ll be better if she ’av the operation?\"  \"She may.  The condition is critical and unless the operation is"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53372"],["title","Star of India (#1)"],["body","rrace. Formerly the house had been a farm dwelling, the last remnant of a property acquired a century ago by a Carrington ancestor with a fortune made in the East and dissipated in the West. The Court, where the Verralls now reigned, had once belonged to this magnificent Carrington, and the ladies of The Chestnuts never forgot the fact. They regarded the Verralls as interlopers, though by now the Verralls had been lords of the manor for several generations.  But though The Court and all its acres were lost to the Carringtons, they had clung as a family to Chestnut Farm, adding to it from time to time as fluctuating fortunes permitted. It was a haven for Carrington widows, unmarried daughters, retired old-soldier Carringtons; a jumping-off place for sons as they started in life, a holiday home for successions of young Carringtons while their parents were abroad; and there was still the family vault in the parish church where they could be buried if India spared them to die in England. Stella's grandfather, whom she could not remember, lay there with others of his name, and it had never entered grandmamma's mind to live or die anywhere but at The Chestnuts.  But to return to the drawing-room--a room that breathed of a people long connected with the East--here were sandal-wood boxes, caskets composed of porcupine quills, coloured clay models of Indian servants, brasses and embroideries. The warmth of the afternoon drew forth faint aromas still stored in these relics, mementoes of travel and service and adventure, the perfume that still hung in the folds of the handsome cashmere shawl draped about old Mrs. Carrington's shoulders.  It was she who opened the debate; failing her lead, neither of her daughters would have dreamed of alluding to their niece's outburst at the luncheon table.  \"What do you imagine is wrong with Stella?\" The old lady's sunken dark eyes, that yet were quick and bright, turned from one daughter to the other. The rest of her muscles were perfectly still.  \"She is growing up,\" said Augusta boldly. She was the elder of the two and more nearly resembled her mother, physically and mentally, than did faint-hearted Ellen.  \"She is still a child!\" pronounced Mrs. Carrington, oblivious of the fact that she herself had been married at the age of seventeen, had sailed to India and returned with three children before she was twenty-one.  \"Perhaps,\" ventured Ellen, \"seeing Maud Verrall in church dressed as a grown-up young lady made her feel a little--well, I hardly know how to express myself--rather kept back?\"  Ellen herself had been guiltily conscious of a vague feeling of envy caused by the sight of The Court people in all their prosperity and finery.  \"Kept back from what?\" demanded Mrs. Carrington. \"Would you wish to see Stella trigged out like that forward monkey Maud Verrall?\"  \"Maud was always a most underbred child,\" said Augusta.  Ellen hastily took up the cue. \"Yes, don't you remember the day she came to tea and broke the vase, and allowed Stella to be blamed? I saw her break it myself, but of course we could say nothing as Maud was our guest, and dear little Stella said nothing.\"  \"But what has that to do with the way Stella behaved to-day?\" inquired her sister. Ellen thought this rather unkind of Augusta.  \"Oh! nothing, of course,\" Ellen admitted. \"Only it just shows----\"  \"We are all aware that Stella has spirit,\" said grandmamma, ignoring this passage, \"she is a true Carrington, but spirit in certain circumstances is a danger and not to be encouraged, just as in others it may be admirable. Now if the child had been a boy----\"  The old lady's gaze turned to a portrait that hung over the mantelpiece--that of a gentleman in a blue velvet coat with lace and silver buttons, powdered hair and bold, bright eyes that seemed to smile on the little feminine conclave in amused toleration. \"Spirit\" in a man was to be accepted and, whatever its consequences, condoned; but in a female, particularly in a young girl, it should be guarded against, suppressed. Ellen Carrington's eyes turned also to the portrait. Long years ago she had shown symptoms of \"spirit\" in connection with the attentions of a dashing young cousin who had strongly resembled the portrait. Mamma was antagonistic; he had sailed for India (just as had all male Carringtons one after the other), and the ship had gone down; so that his vow to return with a fortune and claim his sweet Ellen was never fulfilled.  Augusta, so far as anyone was aware, had known no romance. The family spirit in Augusta found outlet in a fierce devotion to her mother, and in the maintenance of a pathetically pretentious sort of state in the household; the very manner in which she would ring the bell might have argued the existence of a host of retainers. Not for worlds would she have answered the front door herself, neither would she have permitted Ellen or Stella to do so. Her attitude towards the domestic staff at The Chestnuts--old Betty, with a daily slave from the village, and the aged, bad-tempered factotum out of doors--was almost that of a Royal personage, punctilious in the matter of good mornings and thank yous, yet carefully distant as became the upholding of class distinction.  \"It's a pity she was not a boy,\" said Augusta, \"then she could have gone to school--a little more discipline----\"  \"Yes, Stella's education----\" interrupted Mrs. Carrington, and paused thoughtfully. Her daughters listened. Augusta was responsible for Stella's arithmetic, geography, history; Ellen for her progress in music, needlework, drawing. Was fault to be found with these educational efforts?--which in truth were not altogether congenial to the teachers, conscientiously though they pursued them. Stella was frequently tiresome, and she did such odd things--for example, she had \"a trick,\" as they called it, of rising at dawn and rambling about the woods and commons and returning late for breakfast, and then she would be listless and inattentive for the rest of the day. At times she was \"wild\" and disobedient, although at others disarmingly docile and quick and affectionate. On the whole, the aunts were proud of their pupil; what was mamma about to say concerning Stella's education?  Mamma said: \"Though unfortunately Stella is not a boy, I have lately been thinking that if a suitable school can be found---- What was the name of that friend of yours, Augusta, who years ago started a school for young ladies at Torquay?\"  \"Jane Ogle,\" said Augusta shortly. In the opinion of Augusta, Jane Ogle had lost caste when she opened a school. As the daughter of an officer, Jane should not have descended to such depths as the earning of her living when she had plenty of relations with any of whom she could have made her home in genteel idleness. Still, if mamma had any serious notion of a school for Stella it was so far fortunate that Miss Ogle had thus bemeaned herself, seeing that none of them knew anything about boarding schools for girls, institutions which were to be regarded with suspicion.  \"Then you really think, mamma,\" said Augusta incredulously, \"that Stella needs different tuition, or at least different management?\"  \"Her behaviour to-day would point to it,\" mamma replied. \"Perhaps you would write to Miss Ogle, my dear, and make inquiries as to her methods and terms. I am inclined to think Stella is getting a little beyond us in every way.\"   Stella, after rushing from the dining-room and up the stairs in such unladylike fashion, had thrown herself on her bed and wept until her ill-humour evaporated and she began to think more kindly of milk pudding and boiled mutton. Then, feeling hungry and rather ashamed, she had bathed her eyes and \"tidied\" her hair, and for a while sat and gazed from the low window of her bedroom--gazed on the familiar lawn sloping to a narrow stream that had been the cause of many punishments in her childhood, what with her attempts to jump it, the catching of imaginary fish, the sailing of paper boats, all of which had involved \"getting her feet wet,\" a crime in the view of grandmamma and the aunts. The cedar tree on the lawn had also been a source of trouble, for Stella had never fought the temptation to climb it, and the climbing of trees was forbidden as not only hoydenish but disastrous to clothes--the same with the high wall of the kitchen garden. There seemed hardly a spot in the limited domain that for Stella was not associated with punishment; yet she adored \"the grounds,\" as Aunt Augusta entitled the garden, at all seasons of the year, and at this season she still found it heavenly to dabble in the stream, to climb the branches of the cedar tree, even to roll on the fragrant turf.... She loved the old house as well, though two of the rooms she had always avoided instinctively--grandmamma's bedroom was one; Stella felt it held secrets, there was something mysterious and \"dead\" in its atmosphere. The painted toy horse and the wooden soldier, the half-finished sampler, and the shabby doll enshrined on the chest of drawers seemed to her ghostly objects, sad reminders as they were of uncles and aunts who had never grown up. When, for any reason, she was obliged to enter the room it was as if these little dead uncles and aunts still hovered about the big bed with its faded chintz curtains, as if they were listening, watching, hating her for her being alive.  Aunt Augusta's room she also disliked; it might have been a spare room, so cold, so polished, so neat, and the enlarged photographs of bygone Carringtons, framed and hung on the walls, were hideous--all crinolines and strings of black beads and stove-pipe hats and long whiskers.... Aunt Ellen's room was different; it harboured an apologetic air of frivolity, imparted by gay little ornaments and a screen covered with Christmas cards and pictures cut from illustrated papers. Whenever Stella studied this screen she found something she had never noticed before. Above all, in one corner stood a"]]]
