And the ocean's full of things I haven't seen yet. I don't _want_ to grow down!\"  Mater paled with shock. Pater gave his spawn a scalding, scandalized look. \"You'll learn! You can't beat Biology,\" he said thickly, creditably keeping his voice down. \"Junior, you may go!\"  Junior bobbled off, and Pater admonished Mater sternly, \"We must have patience, my dear! All children pass through these larval stages....\"  \"Yes, dear,\" sighed Mater.         *       *       *       *       *  At long last, Junior seemed to have resigned himself to making the best of it.  With considerable exertions, hampered by his increasing bottom-heaviness, he was fetching loads of stones, seaweed and other debris to a spot downslope, and there laboring over what promised to be a fairly ambitious cairn. Judging by what they could see of it, his homesite might even prove a credit to the colony (so went Pater's thoughts) and attract a mate who would be a good catch (thus Mater mused).  Junior was still to be seen at times along the reef in company with his free-swimming friends among the other polyps, at some of whom his parents had always looked askance, fearing they were by no means well-bred. In fact, there was strong suspicion that some of them--waifs from the disreputable Shallows district in the hazardous reaches just below the tide-mark--had never been bred at all, but were products of budding, a practice frowned on in polite society.  However, Junior's appearance and rate of locomotion made it clear he would soon be done with juvenile follies. As Pater repeated with satisfaction--you can't beat Biology; as one becomes more and more bottle-shaped, the romantic illusions of youth must inevitably perish.  \"I always knew there was sound stuff in the youngster,\" declared Pater expansively.  \"At least he won't be able to go around with those ragamuffins much longer,\" breathed Mater thankfully.  \"What does the young fool think he's doing, fiddling round with soapstone?\" grumbled Pater, peering critically through the green to try to make out the details of Junior's building. \"Doesn't he know it's apt to slip its place in a year or two?\"  \"Look, dear,\" hissed Mater acidly, \"isn't that the little polyp who was so rude once?... I wish she wouldn't keep watching Junior like that. Our northwest neighbor heard _positively_ that she's the child of an only parent!\"  \"Never mind.\" Pater turned to reassure her. \"Once Junior is properly rooted, his self-respect will cause him to keep riffraff at a distance. It's a matter of Psychology, my dear; the vertical position makes all the difference in one's thinking.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The great day arrived. Laboriously Junior put a few finishing touches to his construction--which, so far as could be seen from a distance, had turned out decent-looking enough, though it was rather questionably original in design: lower and flatter than was customary.  With one more look at his handiwork, Junior turned bottom-end-down and sank wearily onto the finished site. After a minute, he paddled experimentally, but flailing tentacles failed to lift him. He was already rooted, and growing more solidly so by the moment.  \"Congratulations!\" cried the neighbors. Pater and Mater bowed this way and that in acknowledgment. Mater waved a condescending tentacle to the three maiden aunts.  \"I told you so!\" said Pater triumphantly.  \"Yes, dear....\" said Mater meekly.  Suddenly there were outcries of alarm from the dwellers down-reef. A wave of dismay swept audibly through all the nearer part of the colony. Pater and Mater looked around, and froze.  Junior had begun paddling again, but this time in a most peculiar manner--with a rotary twist and sidewise scoop which looked awkward, but which he performed so deftly that he must have practiced it. Fixed upright as he was now on the platform he had built, he looked for all the world as if he were trying to swim sidewise.  \"He's gone _mad_!\" squeaked Mater.  \"I ...\" gulped Pater, \"I'm afraid not.\"  At least, they saw, there was method in Junior's actions. He went on paddling in the same fashion and now he, and his platform with him, were farther away than they had been, and growing more remote as they stared.         *       *       *       *       *  Parts of the homesite that was not a homesite revolved in some way incomprehensible to eyes that had never seen the like. And the whole affair trundled along, rocking at bumps in the sandy bottom, and squeaking painfully; nevertheless, it moved.  The polyps watching from the reef swam out and frolicked after Junior, watching his contrivance go and chattering eager questions, while their parents bawled at them to keep away from that.  The three maiden aunts shrieked faintly and swooned in one another's tentacles. The colony was shaken as it had not been since the tidal wave.  \"COME BACK!\" thundered Pater. \"You CAN'T do that!\"  \"_Come back!_\" shrilled Mater. \"You can't do _that_!\"  \"Come back!\" gabbled the neighbors. \"You can't _do_ that!\"  But Junior was past listening to reason. Junior was on wheels."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/49823"],["title","Batik and Other Pattern Dyeing (#1)"],["body"," work. The Oriental craftsman never forces crackle. With him it is always an incident, the subtle accident of his handicraft.    [Illustration: JAVANESE WOMAN ENGAGED IN BATIK DECORATION {p. 15}]  The nature of the process forces simple execution in waxing the shapes and outlines, and also limits the number of times the piece may be dyed. Applying the wax becomes increasingly difficult after each dipping. Spotting of color over the entire piece makes thinking in color as important as the painting in of the wax.  The Oriental process of dyeing is the reverse of the American, in that it applies the darkest colors first. This necessitates previous waxing over parts to be kept light and also the removal of the wax and an entire new waxing after each dyeing. The American method is to dye the lightest colors first and build up the deeper colors. Between dyeings the old waxing is repaired and additional areas waxed.  The \"sarong,\" worn by Javanese natives, is a skirt-like piece of goods about the size and proportion of a window curtain. This garment falls from the waist, or above it, to the feet. The fabric is cheap cotton manufactured in Holland or England. The color and decoration of the sarong is influenced by caste and religion. The feudal framework of Javanese society has given much significance to rank.  The women add to the sarong a \"kemban.\" This garment is not unlike a blouse without shoulder supports or sleeves. The kemban is wound tightly about the body under the arms. The drapery covers the upper part of the sarong.  The \"slendang\" completes the wearing apparel of the women. It is a scarf worn for adornment or useful for carrying the youngest child, or other burdens.  The Javanese man wears the sarong in the same manner as the women, which leads the foreigner to awkward misunderstandings. His long hair is done on the top of his head and bound around with a \"sarong kapala.\" This head dress is tied at the nape of the neck. The sarong kapala is square, and when fitted is starched and shaped to the head.    [Illustration: JAVANESE NATIVES DYEING BATIKS {p. 17}]  Among the poorer classes these garments are plain, usually dark blue, for daily wear, but on occasions they are vivid with color decorations.  The native worker prepares his cotton goods by soaking in oil, afterwards in lye. This process is repeated until the material is softened and a pleasing yellow gray.  Hand decoration is done by women. The material is hung over an upright frame. The hand supports the goods, and the molten wax is applied to the design. They use a funnel-like cup with a bamboo handle. The wax trickles slowly through the slender tube, and with this the outline is made. This instrument is called a \"tjanting.\" There is no right or wrong side of this fabric, as the waxing is done on both sides. To cover large surfaces with wax, they use a brush. These women have acquired a high degree of skill through repetition of the same design on the same kind of garment.  The wooden frame over which the goods are fastened is moveable. The wax is melted over an earthen heater with an open side, into which the ends of long sticks are thrust for burning.    [Illustration: JAVANESE MAN DECORATING A SARONG WITH A TJAP {p. 19}]  Although the tjanting is the more desired and versatile device for applying wax, the men wax batiks with \"tjaps.\" The tjap is a wooden block with designs of metal insert. The craftsman sits on a low stool in front of an inclined table over which the goods are smoothly spread. The bottom of a shallow pan is covered with wax, heated in the same manner as for the tjanting. An absorbent pad is placed in the pan, the tjap is pressed on the pad and imprinted on the fabric. The fabric is then turned and, with another tjap made like the first except with its symmetry reversed, wax imprints are made in exactly the same places. This insures good waxing on both sides of the fabric. The piece is then ready for the dye.    [Illustration: JAVANESE BATIK TOOLS {p. 20}]  Sometimes a set of many tjaps is used to work out a pattern for a sarong or other garment. The making of these tjaps is the laborious and expensive work of experts. Of course we may expect to find many repetitions of such patterns, differing from one another only in the accidents of dyeing.  Frequently different methods of applying wax are used in the same decoration. Freehand work with the tjanting and brush on fine pieces serve to take away from the mechanical reproduction of tjap designs. The decoration of the end papers of this book, taken from a fine old sarong, affords an interesting study.  The most artistic and highly regarded effects in batiks among the Japanese workers are executed as they are in America today, _i.e._, the wax is applied with a brush and is as free from mechanical aids as painting.  Pieter Mijer, in \"Batiks and How to Make Them,\" published by Dodd Mead & Company, New York, writes of the modern development of batiks in Holland. The artists who have stimulated the present interest are Cris Lebeau, Dijesselhof and Lion Cachet. The illustrations of their work have a charm and individuality worthy of the highest respect. The author's own piece shown in the same group does not lose by comparison.  This book is also rich in valuable instruction and other illustrations of batiks, showing high American standards of the craft.  Batik adaptation in America is without tradition, and is an outgrowth of youth and enthusiasm caught up and carried on the high tide of progress and opportunity. The real significance of its popularity reaches backward into the necessity that confronted workers in textile designing after Europe was caught in the maelstrom of war.  The textile manufacturer has quickly adapted batik designs, indeed the artist working in batiks feels a close kinship to textile industry.  Batik decoration is free from limitations that restrict mechanical printing. In designing fabrics for the ordinary methods of mechanical reproduction, where great yardage is produced, the designer consults an average taste; whereas in batiks each piece is definitely designed with a particular setting or individual in view. There is no necessity for much repetition of any design, nor indeed can exact copy ever be made.  The first enthusiasm of the worker in batiks is apt to find expression in a burst of color run riot, of \"crackle craze,\" with too little attention paid to design. But this soon gives way, as it should, to more conservative expression in which design is the controlling element, and the art comes to its own as a method of subtle and beautiful illumination of textiles.

It is necessary that there be an attraction or affinity between the fiber of the fabric and the dye in solution. All parts of the fabric must be given equal opportunity to extract the dye in order that a uniform color or \"level\" dyeing be obtained.    [Illustration: {USING A DYE-BATH} {p. 35}]  To accomplish this end experience has found that a few simple things must be observed. These have to do with, (1) the preparation of the fabric for dyeing, (2) the making of the dye-bath, (3) the handling of the fabric while in the dye-bath, and (4) the handling of the fabric after the dyeing.  1. _The Preparation of the Fabric._ The fabric must be clean. A spot of grease or other soil allows that part of the fabric less opportunity to extract color from the dye-bath, with the result that the dyeing is not level. Thorough washing with soap and warm water followed by a good rinsing will remove most spots. The methods of the dry cleaner will be necessary for others.  All sizing must be removed. Sizing consists of substances such as clay, flour, starch, gum, oil, tallow, soap, etc., put into the fiber, either before or after weaving, for the purpose of giving weight, body, strength, stiffness, softness, finish, or other desired quality. Some sizing prevents the extraction of color from the dye-bath. In other cases the sizing itself absorbs a large share of the color, and later when the sizing is removed by washing this color goes with it. Vigorous washing with soap and hot water, followed by rinsing, will remove most sizing. A fabric which suffers injury by the removal of its sizing is not suitable for dyeing.  Previously dyed fabrics are often uneven in color due to spotting and fading. Level dyeing cannot be done over such color. The practice of the professional dyer is to remove or level this color before attempting further dyeing. This often calls for skill beyond that of the inexperienced worker. Sometimes prolonged boiling in strong soap suds will accomplish this. Many colors will also yield to hot hydrosulphite solution followed by a good rinsing.  Of course where goods have been previously colored there are limitations as to the colors that may be obtained by additional dyeing. For example, blue goods cannot, without the removal of the blue color, be dyed yellow but may be dyed green or purple or a deeper blue. Yellow goods cannot be dyed pink, but may be dyed orange, green, brown or black. This will be discussed more fully later.  Some fibers are hard and harsh and resistant, like crash and most"]]]
