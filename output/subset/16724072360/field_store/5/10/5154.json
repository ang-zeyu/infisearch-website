Doors twenty-five to thirty feet high and everything else in proportion.\"  \"Neighbors or privacy?\" asked Stanford.  \"Privacy,\" said Young.  \"We'll take care of it,\" promised Riggs. \"Leave the matter of the house to us.\"  Young stood for a long moment, looking at the two of them. Then he said, \"I thank you, gentlemen. I thank you for your helpfulness and your understanding. But most of all I thank you for not asking any questions.\"  He turned slowly and walked out of the room and they sat in silence for minutes after he was gone.  Finally, Stanford offered a deduction: \"It will have to be a place that a boy would like. Woods to run in and a little stream to fish in and a field where he can fly his kites. What else could it be?\"  \"He's been out ordering children's furniture and toys,\" Riggs agreed. \"Stuff from five thousand years ago. The kind of things he used when he was a child. But scaled to adult size.\"  \"Now,\" said Stanford, \"he wants a house built to the same proportions. A house that will make him think or help him believe that he is a child. But will it work, Riggs? His body will not change. He cannot make it change. It will only be in his mind.\"  \"Illusion,\" declared Riggs. \"The illusion of bigness in relation to himself. To a child, creeping on the floor, a door is twenty-five to thirty feet high, relatively. Of course the child doesn't know that. But Andrew Young does. I don't see how he'll overcome that.\"  \"At first,\" suggested Stanford, \"he will know that it's illusion, but after a time, isn't there a possibility that it will become reality so far as he's concerned? That's why he needs our help. So that the house will not be firmly planted in his memory as a thing that's merely out of proportion ... so that it will slide from illusion into reality without too great a strain.\"  \"We must keep our mouths shut.\" Riggs nodded soberly. \"There must be no interference. It's a thing he must do himself ... entirely by himself. Our help with the house must be the help of an unseen, silent agency. Like brownies, I think the term was that he used, we must help and be never seen. Intrusion by anyone would introduce a jarring note and would destroy illusion and that is all he has to work on. Illusion pure and simple.\"  \"Others have tried,\" objected Stanford, pessimistic again. \"Many others. With gadgets and machines....\"  \"None has tried it,\" said Riggs, \"with the power of mind alone. With the sheer determination to wipe out five thousand years of memory.\"  \"That will be his stumbling block,\" said Stanford. \"The old, dead memories are the things he has to beat. He has to get rid of them ... not just bury them, but get rid of them for good and all, forever.\"  \"He must do more than that,\" said Riggs. \"He must replace his memories with the outlook he had when he was a child. His mind must be washed out, refreshed, wiped clean and shining and made new again ... ready to live another five thousand years.\"  The two men sat and looked at one another and in each other's eyes they saw a single thought--the day would come when they, too, each of them alone, would face the problem Andrew Young faced.  \"We must help,\" said Riggs, \"in every way we can and we must keep watch and we must be ready ... but Andrew Young cannot know that we are helping or that we are watching him. We must anticipate the materials and tools and the aids that he may need.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Stanford started to speak, then hesitated, as if seeking in his mind for the proper words.  \"Yes,\" said Riggs. \"What is it?\"  \"Later on,\" Stanford managed to say, \"much later on, toward the very end, there is a certain factor that we must supply. The one thing that he will need the most and the one thing that he cannot think about, even in advance. All the rest can be stage setting and he can still go on toward the time when it becomes reality. All the rest may be make-believe, but one thing must come as genuine or the entire effort will collapse in failure.\"  Riggs nodded. \"Of course. That's something we'll have to work out carefully.\"  \"If we can,\" Stanford said.         *       *       *       *       *  The yellow button over here and the red one over there and the green one doesn't fit, so I'll throw it on the floor and just for the fun of it, I'll put the pink one in my mouth and someone will find me with it and they'll raise a ruckus because they will be afraid that I will swallow it.  And there's nothing, absolutely nothing, that I love better than a full-blown ruckus. Especially if it is over me.  \"Ug,\" said Andrew Young, and he swallowed the button.  He sat stiff and straight in the towering high chair and then, in a fury, swept the oversized muffin tin and its freight of buttons crashing to the floor.  For a second he felt like weeping in utter frustration and then a sense of shame crept in on him.  Big baby, he said to himself.  Crazy to be sitting in an overgrown high chair, playing with buttons and mouthing baby talk and trying to force a mind conditioned by five thousand years of life into the channels of an infant's thoughts.  Carefully he disengaged the tray and slid it out, cautiously shinnied down the twelve-foot-high chair.  The room engulfed him, the ceiling towering far above him.  The neighbors, he told himself, no doubt thought him crazy, although none of them had said so. Come to think of it, he had not seen any of his neighbors for a long spell now.  A suspicion came into his mind. Maybe they knew what he was doing, maybe they were deliberately keeping out of his way in order not to embarrass him.  That, of course, would be what they would do if they had realized what he was about. But he had expected ... he had expected ... that fellow, what's his name? ... at the commission, what's the name of that commission, anyhow? Well, anyway, he'd expected a fellow whose name he couldn't remember from a commission the name of which he could not recall to come snooping around, wondering what he might be up to, offering to help, spoiling the whole setup, everything he'd planned.  I can't remember, he complained to himself. I can't remember the name of a man whose name I knew so short a time ago as yesterday. Nor the name of a commission that I knew as well as I know my name. I'm getting forgetful. I'm getting downright childish.  Childish?  Childish!  Childish and forgetful.  Good Lord, thought Andrew Young, that's just the way I want it.  On hands and knees he scrabbled about and picked up the buttons, put them in his pocket. Then, with the muffin tin underneath his arm, he shinnied up the high chair and, seating himself comfortably, sorted out the buttons in the pan.  The green one over here in this compartment and the yellow one ... oops, there she goes onto the floor. And the red one in with the blue one and this one ... this one ... what's the color of this one? Color? What's that?  What is what?  What--         *       *       *       *       *  \"It's almost time,\" said Stanford, \"and we are ready, as ready as we'll ever be. We'll move in when the time is right, but we can't move in too soon. Better to be a little late than a little early. We have all the things we need. Special size diapers and--\"  \"Good Lord,\" exclaimed Riggs, \"it won't go that far, will it?\"  \"It should,\" said Stanford. \"It should go even further to work right. He got lost yesterday. One of our men found him and led him home. He didn't have the slightest idea where he was and he was getting pretty scared and he cried a little. He chattered about birds and flowers and he insisted that our man stay and play with him.\"  Riggs chuckled softly. \"Did he?\"  \"Oh, certainly. He came back worn to a frazzle.\"  \"Food?\" I asked Riggs. \"How is he feeding himself?\"  \"We see there's a supply of stuff, cookies and such-wise, left on a low shelf, where he can get at them. One of the robots cooks up some more substantial stuff on a regular schedule and leaves it where he can find it. We have to be careful. We can't mess around too much. We can't intrude on him. I have a feeling he's almost reached an actual turning point. We can't afford to upset things now that he's come this far.\"  \"The android's ready?\"  \"Just about,\" said Stanford.  \"And the playmates?\"  \"Ready. They were less of a problem.\"  \"There's nothing more that we can do?\"  \"Nothing,\" Stanford said. \"Just wait, that's all. Young has carried himself this far by the sheer force of will alone. That will is gone now. He can't consciously force himself any further back. He is more child than adult now. He's built up a regressive momentum and the only question is whether that momentum is sufficient to carry him all the way back to actual babyhood.\"  \"It has to go back to that?\" Riggs looked unhappy, obviously thinking of his own future. \"You're only guessing, aren't you?\"  \"All the way or it simply is no good,\" Stanford said dogmatically. \"He has to get an absolutely fresh start. All the way or nothing.\"  \"And if he gets stuck halfway between? Half child, half man, what then?\"  \"That's something I don't want to think about,\" Stanford said.         *       *       *       *       *  He had lost his favorite teddy bear and gone to hunt it in the dusk that was filled with elusive fireflies and the hush of a world quieting down for the time of sleep. The grass was drenched with dew and he felt the cold wetness of it soaking through his shoes as he went from bush to hedge to flowerbed, looking for the missing toy.  It was necessary, he told himself, that he find the nice little bear, for it was the one that slept with him and if he did not find it, he knew that it would spend a lonely and comfortless night. But at no time did he admit, even to his innermost thought, that it was he who needed the bear and not the bear who needed him.  A soaring bat swooped low and for a horrified moment, catching sight of the zooming terror, a blob of darkness in the gathering dusk, he squatted low against the ground,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51046"],["title","...And It Comes Out Here (#1)"],["body","you, but nobody pays much attention to you. Why should they? You wouldn't care if you saw a man in a leopard-skin suit; you'd figure it was some part in a play and let it go. Well, people don't change much.  You get up your courage and go up to a boy selling something that might be papers on tapes.  \"Where can I find the Museum of Science?\"  \"Downayer rien turn lefa the sign. Stoo bloss,\" he tells you. Around you, you hear some pretty normal English, but there are others using stuff as garbled as his. The educated and uneducated? I don't know.  You go right until you find a big sign built into the rubbery surface of the walk: _Miuzi:m *v Syens_. There's an arrow pointing and you turn left. Ahead of you, two blocks on, you can see a pink building, with faint aqua trimming, bigger than most of the others. They are building lower than they used to, apparently. Twenty floors up seems about the maximum. You head for it, and find the sidewalk is marked with the information that it is the museum.         *       *       *       *       *  You go up the steps, but you see that it seems to be closed. You hesitate for a moment, then. You're beginning to think the whole affair is complete nonsense, and you should get back to the time machine and go home. But then a guard comes to the gate. Except for the short legs in his suit and the friendly grin on his face, he looks like any other guard.  What's more, he speaks pretty clearly. Everyone says things in a sort of drawl, with softer vowels and slurred consonants, but it's rather pleasant.  \"Help you, sir? Oh, of course. You must be playing in 'Atoms and Axioms.' The museum's closed, but I'll be glad to let you study whatever you need for realism in your role. Nice show. I saw it twice.\"  \"Thanks,\" you mutter, wondering what kind of civilization can produce guards as polite as that. \"I--I'm told I should investigate your display of atomic generators.\"  He beams at that. \"Of course.\" The gate is swung to behind you, but obviously he isn't locking it. In fact, there doesn't seem to be a lock. \"Must be a new part. You go down that corridor, up one flight of stairs and left. Finest display in all the known worlds. We've got the original of the first thirteen models. Professor Jonas was using them to check his latest theory of how they work. Too bad he could not explain the principle, either. Someone will, some day, though. Lord, the genius of that twentieth century inventor! It's quite a hobby with me, sir. I've read everything I could get on the period. Oh--congratulations on your pronunciation. Sounds just like some of our oldest tapes.\"  You get away from him, finally, after some polite thanks. The building seems deserted and you wander up the stairs. There's a room on your right filled with something that proclaims itself the first truly plastic diamond former, and you go up to it. As you come near, it goes through a crazy wiggle inside, stops turning out a continual row of what seem to be bearings, and slips something the size of a penny toward you.  \"Souvenir,\" it announces in a well-modulated voice. \"This is a typical gem of the twentieth century, properly cut to 58 facets, known technically as a Jaegger diamond, and approximately twenty carats in size. You can have it made into a ring on the third floor during morning hours for one-tenth credit. If you have more than one child, press the red button for the number of stones you desire.\"  You put it in your pocket, gulping a little, and get back to the corridor. You turn left and go past a big room in which models of spaceships--from the original thing that looks like a V-2, and is labeled first Lunar rocket, to a ten-foot globe, complete with miniature manikins--are sailing about in some kind of orbits. Then there is one labeled _Wep:nz_, filled with everything from a crossbow to a tiny rod four inches long and half the thickness of a pencil, marked _Fynal Hand Arm_. Beyond is the end of the corridor, and a big place that bears a sign, _Mad:lz *v Atamic Pau:r Sorsez_.         *       *       *       *       *  By that time, you're almost convinced. And you've been doing a lot of thinking about what you can do. The story I'm telling has been sinking in, but you aren't completely willing to accept it.  You notice that the models are all mounted on tables and that they're a lot smaller than you thought. They seem to be in chronological order, and the latest one, marked _2147--Rincs Dyn*pat:_, is about the size of a desk telephone. The earlier ones are larger, of course, clumsier, but with variations, probably depending on the power output. A big sign on the ceiling gives a lot of dope on atomic generators, explaining that this is the first invention which leaped full blown into basically final form.  You study it, but it mentions casually the inventor, without giving his name. Either they don't know it, or they take it for granted that everyone does, which seems more probable. They call attention to the fact that they have the original model of the first atomic generator built, complete with design drawings, original manuscript on operation, and full patent application.  They state that it has all major refinements, operating on any fuel, producing electricity at any desired voltage up to five million, any chosen cyclic rate from direct current to one thousand megacycles, and any amperage up to one thousand, its maximum power output being fifty kilowatts, limited by the current-carrying capacity of the outputs. They also mention that the operating principle is still being investigated, and that only such refinements as better alloys and the addition of magnetric and nucleatric current outlets have been added since the original.  So you go to the end and look over the thing. It's simply a square box with a huge plug on each side, and a set of vernier controls on top, plus a little hole marked, in old-style spelling, _Drop BBs or wire here_. Apparently that's the way it's fueled. It's about one foot on each side.  \"Nice,\" the guard says over your shoulder. \"It finally wore out one of the cathogrids and we had to replace that, but otherwise it's exactly as the great inventor made it. And it still operates as well as ever. Like to have me tell you about it?\"  \"Not particularly,\" you begin, and then realize bad manners might be conspicuous here. While you're searching for an answer, the guard pulls something out of his pocket and stares at it.  \"Fine, fine. The mayor of Altasecarba--Centaurian, you know--is arriving, but I'll be back in about ten minutes. He wants to examine some of the weapons for a monograph on Centaurian primitives compared to nineteenth century man. You'll pardon me?\"  You pardon him pretty eagerly and he wanders off happily. You go up to the head of the line, to that Rinks Dynapattuh, or whatever it transliterates to. That's small and you can carry it. But the darned thing is absolutely fixed. You can't see any bolts, but you can't budge it, either.         *       *       *       *       *  You work down the line. It'd be foolish to take the early model if you can get one with built-in magnetic current terminals--Ehrenhaft or some other principle?--and nuclear binding-force energy terminals. But they're all held down by the same whatchamaycallem effect.  And, finally, you're right back beside the original first model. It's probably bolted down, too, but you try it tentatively and you find it moves. There's a little sign under it, indicating you shouldn't touch it, since the gravostatic plate is being renewed.  Well, you won't be able to change the time cycle by doing anything I haven't told you, but a working model such as that is a handy thing. You lift it; it only weighs about fifty pounds! Naturally, it can be carried.  You expect a warning bell, but nothing happens. As a matter of fact, if you'd stop drinking so much of that scotch and staring at the time machine out there now, you'd hear what I'm saying and know what will happen to you. But of course, just as I did, you're going to miss a lot of what I say from now on, and have to find out for yourself. But maybe some of it helps. I've tried to remember how much I remembered, after he told me, but I can't be sure. So I'll keep on talking. I probably can't help it, anyhow. Pre-set, you might say.  Well, you stagger down the corridor, looking out for the guard, but all seems clear. Then you hear his voice from the weapons room. You bend down and try to scurry past, but you know you're in full view. Nothing happens, though.  You stumble down the stairs, feeling all the futuristic rays in the world on your back, and still nothing happens. Ahead of you, the gate is closed. You reach it and it opens obligingly by itself. You breathe a quick sigh of relief and start out onto the street.  Then there's a yell behind you. You don't wait. You put one leg in front of the other and you begin racing down the walk, ducking past people, who stare at you with expressions you haven't time to see. There's another yell behind you.  Something goes over your head and drops on the sidewalk just in front of your feet, with a sudden ringing sound. You don't wait to find out about that, either. Somebody reaches out a hand to catch you and you dart past.  The street is pretty clear now and you jolt along, with your arms seeming to come out of the sockets, and that atomic generator getting heavier at every step.  Out of nowhere, something in a blue uniform about six feet tall and on the beefy side appears--and the badge hasn't changed much. The cop catches your arm and you know you're not going to get away, so you stop.  \"You can't exert yourself that hard in this heat, fellow,\" the cop says. \"There are laws against that, without a yellow sticker. Here, let me grab you a taxi.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Reaction sets in a bit and your knees begin to buckle, but you shake your head and come up for air.  \"I--I left my money home,\" you begin.  The cop"]]]
