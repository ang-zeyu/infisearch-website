Then all of the IAB's membership and much of their capital will be involved with EV. Much of that capital is already in anticipatory motion. So a highly complex structure now ultimately depends on the integrity of the Sollenar Corporation. If Sollenar stock falls in value, not just you but many IAB members will be greatly embarrassed. Which is another way of saying EV must succeed.\"  \"I know all that! What of it? There's no risk. I've had every related patent on Earth checked. There will be no catastrophic obsolescence of the EV system.\"  Ermine said: \"There are engineers on Mars. Martian engineers. They're a dying race, but no one knows what they can still do.\"  Sollenar raised his massive head.  Ermine said: \"Late this evening, my office learned that Cortwright Burr has been in close consultation with the Martians for several weeks. They have made some sort of machine for him. He was on the flight that landed at the Facility a few moments ago.\"  Sollenar's fists clenched. The lights crashed off and on, and the room wailed. From the terrace came a startled cry, and a sound of smashed glass.  Mr. Ermine nodded, excused himself and left.  --A few moments later, Mr. Ermine stepped out at the pedestrian level of the Sollenar Building. He strolled through the landscaped garden, and across the frothing brook toward the central walkway down the Avenue. He paused at a hedge to pluck a blossom and inhale its odor. He walked away, holding it in his naked fingers.   II  Drifting slowly on the thread of his spinneret, Rufus Sollenar came gliding down the wind above Cortwright Burr's building.  The building, like a spider, touched the ground at only the points of its legs. It held its wide, low bulk spread like a parasol over several downtown blocks. Sollenar, manipulating the helium-filled plastic drifter far above him, steered himself with jets of compressed gas from plastic bottles in the drifter's structure.  Only Sollenar himself, in all this system, was not effectively transparent to the municipal anti-plane radar. And he himself was wrapped in long, fluttering streamers of dull black, metallic sheeting. To the eye, he was amorphous and non-reflective. To electronic sensors, he was a drift of static much like a sheet of foil picked by the wind from some careless trash heap. To all of the senses of all interested parties he was hardly there at all--and, thus, in an excellent position for murder.  He fluttered against Burr's window. There was the man, crouched over his desk. What was that in his hands--a pomander?  Sollenar clipped his harness to the edges of the cornice. Swayed out against it, his sponge-soled boots pressed to the glass, he touched his left hand to the window and described a circle. He pushed; there was a thud on the carpeting in Burr's office, and now there was no barrier to Sollenar. Doubling his knees against his chest, he catapulted forward, the riot pistol in his right hand. He stumbled and fell to his knees, but the gun was up.  Burr jolted up behind his desk. The little sphere of orange-gold metal, streaked with darker bronze, its surface vermicular with encrustations, was still in his hands. \"Him!\" Burr cried out as Sollenar fired.  Gasping, Sollenar watched the charge strike Burr. It threw his torso backward faster than his limbs and head could follow without dangling. The choked-down pistol was nearly silent. Burr crashed backward to end, transfixed, against the wall.         *       *       *       *       *  Pale and sick, Sollenar moved to take the golden ball. He wondered where Shakespeare could have seen an example such as this, to know an old man could have so much blood in him.  Burr held the prize out to him. Staring with eyes distended by hydrostatic pressure, his clothing raddled and his torso grinding its broken bones, Burr stalked away from the wall and moved as if to embrace Sollenar. It was queer, but he was not dead.  Shuddering, Sollenar fired again.  Again Burr was thrown back. The ball spun from his splayed fingers as he once more marked the wall with his body.  Pomander, orange, whatever--it looked valuable.  Sollenar ran after the rolling ball. And Burr moved to intercept him, nearly faceless, hunched under a great invisible weight that slowly yielded as his back groaned.  Sollenar took a single backward step.  Burr took a step toward him. The golden ball lay in a far corner. Sollenar raised the pistol despairingly and fired again. Burr tripped backward on tiptoe, his arms like windmills, and fell atop the prize.  Tears ran down Sollenar's cheeks. He pushed one foot forward ... and Burr, in his corner, lifted his head and began to gather his body for the effort of rising.  Sollenar retreated to the window, the pistol sledging backward against his wrist and elbow as he fired the remaining shots in the magazine.  Panting, he climbed up into the window frame and clipped the harness to his body, craning to look over his shoulder ... as Burr--shredded; leaking blood and worse than blood--advanced across the office.  He cast off his holds on the window frame and clumsily worked the drifter controls. Far above him, volatile ballast spilled out and dispersed in the air long before it touched ground. Sollenar rose, sobbing--  And Burr stood in the window, his shattered hands on the edges of the cut circle, raising his distended eyes steadily to watch Sollenar in flight across the enigmatic sky.         *       *       *       *       *  Where he landed, on the roof of a building in his possession, Sollenar had a disposal unit for his gun and his other trappings. He deferred for a time the question of why Burr had failed at once to die. Empty-handed, he returned uptown.  He entered his office, called and told his attorneys the exact times of departure and return and knew the question of dealing with municipal authorities was thereby resolved. That was simple enough, with no witnesses to complicate the matter. He began to wish he hadn't been so irresolute as to leave Burr without the thing he was after. Surely, if the pistol hadn't killed the man--an old man, with thin limbs and spotted skin--he could have wrestled that thin-limbed, bloody old man aside--that spotted old man--and dragged himself and his prize back to the window, for all that the old man would have clung to him, and clutched at his legs, and fumbled for a handhold on his somber disguise of wrappings--that broken, immortal old man.  Sollenar raised his hand. The great window to the city grew opaque.  Bess Allardyce knocked softly on the door from the terrace. He would have thought she'd returned to her own apartments many hours ago. Tortuously pleased, he opened the door and smiled at her, feeling the dried tears crack on the skin of his cheeks.  He took her proffered hands. \"You waited for me,\" he sighed. \"A long time for anyone as beautiful as you to wait.\"  She smiled back at him. \"Let's go out and look at the stars.\"  \"Isn't it chilly?\"  \"I made spiced hot cider for us. We can sip it and think.\"  He let her draw him out onto the terrace. He leaned on the parapet, his arm around her pulsing waist, his cape drawn around both their shoulders.  \"Bess, I won't ask if you'd stay with me no matter what the circumstances. But it might be a time will come when I couldn't bear to live in this city. What about that?\"  \"I don't know,\" she answered honestly.  And Cortwright Burr put his hand up over the edge of the parapet, between them.         *       *       *       *       *  Sollenar stared down at the straining knuckles, holding the entire weight of the man dangling against the sheer face of the building. There was a sliding, rustling noise, and the other hand came up, searched blindly for a hold and found it, hooked over the stone. The fingers tensed and rose, their tips flattening at the pressure as Burr tried to pull his head and shoulders up to the level of the parapet.  Bess breathed: \"Oh, look at them! He must have torn them terribly climbing up!\" Then she pulled away from Sollenar and stood staring at him, her hand to her mouth. \"But he _couldn't_ have climbed! We're so high!\"  Sollenar beat at the hands with the heels of his palms, using the direct, trained blows he had learned at his athletic club.  Bone splintered against the stone. When the knuckles were broken the hands instantaneously disappeared, leaving only streaks behind them. Sollenar looked over the parapet. A bundle shrank from sight, silhouetted against the lights of the pedestrian level and the Avenue. It contracted to a pinpoint. Then, when it reached the brook and water flew in all directions, it disappeared in a final sunburst, endowed with glory by the many lights which found momentary reflection down there.  \"Bess, leave me! Leave me, please!\" Rufus Sollenar cried out.   III  Rufus Sollenar paced his office, his hands held safely still in front of him, their fingers spread and rigid.  The telephone sounded, and his secretary said to him: \"Mr. Sollenar, you are ten minutes from being late at the TTV Executives' Ball. This is a First Class obligation.\"  Sollenar laughed. \"I thought it was, when I originally classified it.\"  \"Are you now planning to renege, Mr. Sollenar?\" the secretary inquired politely.  Certainly, Sollenar thought. He could as easily renege on the Ball as a king could on his coronation.  \"Burr, you scum, what have you done to me?\" he asked the air, and the telephone said: \"Beg pardon?\"  \"Tell my valet,\" Sollenar said. \"I'm going.\" He dismissed the phone. His hands cupped in front of his chest. A firm grip on emptiness might be stronger than any prize in a broken hand.  Carrying in his chest something he refused to admit was terror, Sollenar made ready for the Ball.  But only a few moments after the first dance set had ended, Malcolm Levier of the local TTV station executive staff looked over"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51726"],["title","Wall of Crystal, Eye of Night (#2)"],["body","llenar's shoulder and remarked:  \"Oh, there's Cort Burr, dressed like a gallows bird.\"  Sollenar, glittering in the costume of the Medici, did not turn his head. \"Is he? What would he want here?\"  Levier's eyebrows arched. \"He holds a little stock. He has entree. But he's late.\" Levier's lips quirked. \"It must have taken him some time to get that makeup on.\"  \"Not in good taste, is it?\"  \"Look for yourself.\"  \"Oh, I'll do better than that,\" Sollenar said. \"I'll go and talk to him a while. Excuse me, Levier.\" And only then did he turn around, already started on his first pace toward the man.         *       *       *       *       *  But Cortwright Burr was only a pasteboard imitation of himself as Sollenar had come to know him. He stood to one side of the doorway, dressed in black and crimson robes, with black leather gauntlets on his hands, carrying a staff of weathered, natural wood. His face was shadowed by a sackcloth hood, the eyes well hidden. His face was powdered gray, and some blend of livid colors hollowed his cheeks. He stood motionless as Sollenar came up to him.  As he had crossed the floor, each step regular, the eyes of bystanders had followed Sollenar, until, anticipating his course, they found Burr waiting. The noise level of the Ball shrank perceptibly, for the lesser revelers who chanced to be present were sustaining it all alone. The people who really mattered here were silent and watchful.  The thought was that Burr, defeated in business, had come here in some insane reproach to his adversary, in this lugubrious, distasteful clothing. Why, he looked like a corpse. Or worse.  The question was, what would Sollenar say to him? The wish was that Burr would take himself away, back to his estates or to some other city. New York was no longer for Cortwright Burr. But what would Sollenar say to him now, to drive him back to where he hadn't the grace to go willingly?  \"Cortwright,\" Sollenar said in a voice confined to the two of them. \"So your Martian immortality works.\"  Burr said nothing.  \"You got that in addition, didn't you? You knew how I'd react. You knew you'd need protection. Paid the Martians to make you physically invulnerable? It's a good system. Very impressive. Who would have thought the Martians knew so much? But who here is going to pay attention to you now? Get out of town, Cortwright. You're past your chance. You're dead as far as these people are concerned--all you have left is your skin.\"  Burr reached up and surreptitiously lifted a corner of his fleshed mask. And there he was, under it. The hood retreated an inch, and the light reached his eyes; and Sollenar had been wrong, Burr had less left than he thought.  \"Oh, no, no, Cortwright,\" Sollenar said softly. \"No, you're right--I can't stand up to that.\"  He turned and bowed to the assembled company. \"Good night!\" he cried, and walked out of the ballroom.  Someone followed him down the corridor to the elevators. Sollenar did not look behind him.  \"I have another appointment with you now,\" Ermine said at his elbow.         *       *       *       *       *  They reached the pedestrian level. Sollenar said: \"There's a cafe. We can talk there.\"  \"Too public, Mr. Sollenar. Let's simply stroll and converse.\" Ermine lightly took his arm and guided him along the walkway. Sollenar noticed then that Ermine was costumed so cunningly that no one could have guessed the appearance of the man.  \"Very well,\" Sollenar said.  \"Of course.\"  They walked together, casually. Ermine said: \"Burr's driving you to your death. Is it because you tried to kill him earlier? Did you get his Martian secret?\"  Sollenar shook his head.  \"You didn't get it.\" Ermine sighed. \"That's unfortunate. I'll have to take steps.\"  \"Under the By-Laws,\" Sollenar said, \"I cry _laissez faire_.\"  Ermine looked up, his eyes twinkling. \"_Laissez faire?_ Mr. Sollenar, do you have any idea how many of our members are involved in your fortunes? _They_ will cry _laissez faire_, Mr. Sollenar, but clearly you persist in dragging them down with you. No, sir, Mr. Sollenar, my office now forwards an immediate recommendation to the Technical Advisory Committee of the IAB that Mr. Burr probably has a system superior to yours, and that stock in Sollenar, Incorporated, had best be disposed of.\"  \"There's a bench,\" Sollenar said. \"Let's sit down.\"  \"As you wish.\" Ermine moved beside Sollenar to the bench, but remained standing.  \"What is it, Mr. Sollenar?\"  \"I want your help. You advised me on what Burr had. It's still in his office building, somewhere. You have resources. We can get it.\"  \"_Laissez faire_, Mr. Sollenar. I visited you in an advisory capacity. I can do no more.\"  \"For a partnership in my affairs could you do more?\"  \"Money?\" Ermine tittered. \"For me? Do you know the conditions of my employment?\"         *       *       *       *       *  If he had thought, Sollenar would have remembered. He reached out tentatively. Ermine anticipated him.  Ermine bared his left arm and sank his teeth into it. He displayed the arm. There was no quiver of pain in voice or stance. \"It's not a legend, Mr. Sollenar. It's quite true. We of our office must spend a year, after the nerve surgery, learning to walk without the feel of our feet, to handle objects without crushing them or letting them slip, or damaging ourselves. Our mundane pleasures are auditory, olfactory, and visual. Easily gratified at little expense. Our dreams are totally interior, Mr. Sollenar. The operation is irreversible. What would you buy for me with your money?\"  \"What would I buy for myself?\" Sollenar's head sank down between his shoulders.  Ermine bent over him. \"Your despair is your own, Mr. Sollenar. I have official business with you.\"  He lifted Sollenar's chin with a forefinger. \"I judge physical interference to be unwarranted at this time. But matters must remain so that the IAB members involved with you can recover the value of their investments in EV. Is that perfectly clear, Mr. Sollenar? You are hereby enjoined under the By-Laws, as enforced by the Special Public Relations Office.\" He glanced at his watch. \"Notice was served at 1:27 AM, City time.\"  \"1:27,\" Sollenar said. \"City time.\" He sprang to his feet and raced down a companionway to the taxi level.  Mr. Ermine watched him quizzically.  He opened his costume, took out his omnipresent medical kit, and sprayed coagulant over the wound in his forearm. Replacing the kit, he adjusted his clothing and strolled down the same companionway Sollenar had run. He raised an arm, and a taxi flittered down beside him. He showed the driver a card, and the cab lifted off with him, its lights glaring in a Priority pattern, far faster than Sollenar's ordinary legal limit allowed.   IV  Long Island Facility vaulted at the stars in great kangaroo-leaps of arch and cantilever span, jeweled in glass and metal as if the entire port were a mechanism for navigating interplanetary space. Rufus Sollenar paced its esplanades, measuring his steps, holding his arms still, for the short time until he could board the Mars rocket.  Erect and majestic, he took a place in the lounge and carefully sipped liqueur, once the liner had boosted away from Earth and coupled in its Faraday main drives.  Mr. Ermine settled into the place beside him.  Sollenar looked over at him calmly. \"I thought so.\"  Ermine nodded. \"Of course you did. But I didn't almost miss you. I was here ahead of you. I have no objection to your going to Mars, Mr. Sollenar. _Laissez faire._ Provided I can go along.\"  \"Well,\" Rufus Sollenar said. \"Liqueur?\" He gestured with his glass.  Ermine shook his head. \"No, thank you,\" he said delicately.  Sollenar said: \"Even your tongue?\"  \"Of course my tongue, Mr. Sollenar. I taste nothing. I touch nothing.\" Ermine smiled. \"But I feel no pressure.\"  \"All right, then,\" Rufus Sollenar said crisply. \"We have several hours to landing time. You sit and dream your interior dreams, and I'll dream mine.\" He faced around in his chair and folded his arms across his chest.  \"Mr. Sollenar,\" Ermine said gently.  \"Yes?\"  \"I am once again with you by appointment as provided under the By-Laws.\"  \"State your business, Mr. Ermine.\"  \"You are not permitted to lie in an unknown grave, Mr. Sollenar. Insurance policies on your life have been taken out at a high premium rate. The IAB members concerned cannot wait the statutory seven years to have you declared dead. Do what you will, Mr. Sollenar, but I must take care I witness your death. From now on, I am with you wherever you go.\"  Sollenar smiled. \"I don't intend to die. Why should I die, Mr. Ermine?\"  \"I have no idea, Mr. Sollenar. But I know Cortwright Burr's character. And isn't that he, seated there in the corner? The light is poor, but I think he's recognizable.\"  Across the lounge, Burr raised his head and looked into Sollenar's eyes. He raised a hand near his face, perhaps merely to signify greeting. Rufus Sollenar faced front.  \"A worthy opponent, Mr. Sollenar,\" Ermine said. \"A persevering, unforgiving, ingenious man. And yet--\" Ermine seemed a little touched by bafflement. \"And yet it seems to me, Mr. Sollenar, that he got you running rather easily. What _did_ happen between you, after my advisory call?\"  Sollenar turned a terrible smile on Ermine. \"I shot him to pieces. If you'd peel his face, you'd see.\"  Ermine sighed. \"Up to this moment, I had thought perhaps you might still salvage your affairs.\"  \"Pity, Mr. Ermine? Pity for the insane?\"  \"Interest. I can take no part in your world. Be grateful, Mr. Sollenar. I am not the same gullible man I was when I signed my contract with IAB, so many years ago.\"  Sollenar laughed. Then he stole a glance at Burr's corner.         *       *       *       *       *  The ship came down at Abernathy Field, in Aresia, the Terrestrial city.
