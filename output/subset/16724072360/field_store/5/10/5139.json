He paused a moment to collect his thoughts. \"First of all, you know that there are two coexistent universes or planes, with point-to-point correspondence, but that these planes are of very different size. For every one of the infinitude of points in our Universe--which we call for convenience the 'alpha' plane--there is a single corresponding point in the smaller or 'beta' plane.\"  Anne pursed her lips doubtfully. \"If they match point for point, how can there be any difference in size?\" she asked.  John searched his pockets. After a little difficulty, he produced an envelope and a pencil stub. On the back of the envelope, he drew two parallel lines, one about five inches long, and the other about double the length of the first.  \"Actually,\" he said, \"each of these line segments has an infinite number of points in it, but we'll ignore that. I'll just divide each one of these into ten equal parts.\" He did so, using short, neat cross-marks.  \"Now I'll establish a one-to-one correspondence between these two segments, which we will call one-line universes, by connecting each of my dividing cross-marks on the short segment with the corresponding mark on the longer line. I'll use dotted lines as connectors. That makes eleven dotted lines. You see?\"  Anne nodded. \"That's plain enough. It reminds me of a venetian blind that has hung up on one side. Like ours in the living room last week that I couldn't fix, but had to wait until you came home.\"  \"Yes,\" said John. \"Now, let us call this longer line-segment an 'alpha' universe; an analogue of our own multi-dimensional 'alpha' universe. If I move my pencil along the line at one section a second like this, it takes me ten seconds to get to the other end. We will assume that this velocity of an inch a second is the fastest anything can go along the 'alpha' line. That is the velocity of light, therefore, in the 'alpha' plane--186,000 miles a second, in round numbers. No need to use decimals.\"         *       *       *       *       *  He hurried on as Anne stirred and seemed about to speak. \"But if I slide out from my starting point along a dotted line part way to the 'beta' universe--something which, for reasons I can't explain now, takes negligible time--watch what happens. If I still proceed at the rate of an inch a second in this inter-planar region, then, with the dotted lines all bunched closely together, after five seconds when I switch along another dotted line back to my original universe, I have gone almost the whole length of that longer line. Of course, this introduction of 'alpha' matter--my pencil point in this case--into the inter-planar region between the universes sets up enormous strains, so that after a certain length of time our spaceship is automatically rejected and returned to its own proper plane.\"  \"Could anybody in the littler universe use the same system?\"  John laughed. \"If there were anybody in the 'beta' plane, I guess they could, although they would end up traveling slower than they would if they just stayed in their own plane. But there isn't anybody. The 'beta' plane is a constant level entropy universe--completely without life of its own. The entropy level, of course, is vastly higher than that of our own universe.\"  Anne sat up. \"I'll forgive you this time for bringing up that horrid word _entropy_, if you'll promise me not to do it again,\" she said.         *       *       *       *       *  John Shrugged his shoulders and smiled. \"Now,\" he said, \"if I want to get somewhere fast, I just start off in the right direction, and switch over toward 'beta.' When 'beta' throws me back, a light-year or so toward my destination, I just switch over again. You see, there is a great deal more difference in the sizes of Alpha universe and Beta universe than in the sizes of these alpha and beta line-segment analogues. Then I continue alternating back and forth until I get where I want to go. Establishing my correct velocity vector is complicated mathematically, but simple in practice, and is actually an aiming device, having nothing to do with how fast I go.\"  He hesitated, groping for the right words. \"In point of fact, you have to imagine that corresponding points in the two universes are moving rapidly past each other in all directions at once. I just have to select the right direction, or to convince the probability cloud that corresponds to my location in the 'alpha' universe that it is really a point near the 'beta' universe, going my way. That's a somewhat more confused way of looking at it than merely imagining that I continue to travel in the inter-planar region at the same velocity that I had in 'alpha,' but it's closer to a description of what the math says happens. I could make it clear if I could just use mathematics, but I doubt if the equations will mean much to you.  \"At any rate, distance traveled depends on mass--the bigger the ship, the shorter the distance traveled on each return to our own universe--and not on velocity in 'alpha.' Other parameters, entirely under the control of the traveler, also affect the time that a ship remains in the inter-planar region.  \"There are refinements, of course. Recently, for example, we have discovered a method of multi-transfer. Several of the transmitters that accomplish the transfer are used together. When they all operate exactly simultaneously, all the matter within a large volume of space is transferred as a unit. With three or four transmitters keyed together, you could transfer a comet and its tail intact. And that's how inter-planar traveling works. Clear now?\"  \"And that's why they call it 'stitching,'\" said Anne with seeming delight. \"You just think of the ship as a needle stitching its way back and forth into and out of our universe. Why didn't you just say so?\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"I have. Many times. But there's another interesting point about stitching. Subjectively, the man in the ship seems to spend about one day in each universe alternately. Actually, according to the time scale of an observer in the 'alpha' plane, his ship disappears for about a day, then reappears for a minute fraction of a second and is gone again. Of course, one observer couldn't watch both the disappearance and reappearance of the same ship, and I assume the observers have the same velocity in 'alpha' as does the stitching ship. Anyway, after a ship completes its last stitch, near its destination, there's a day of subjective time in which to make calculations for the landing--to compute trajectories and so forth--before it actually fully rejoins this universe. And while in the inter-planar region it cannot be detected, even by someone else stitching in the same region of 'alpha' space.  \"That's one of the things that makes interruption of the enemy ships entirely impossible. If a ship is in an unfavorable position, it just takes one more quick stitch out of range, then returns to a more favorable location. In other words, if it finds itself in trouble, it can be gone from our plane again even before it entirely rejoins it. Even if it landed by accident in the heart of a blue-white star, it would be unharmed for that tiny fraction of a second which, to the people in the ship, would seem like an entire day.  \"If this time anomaly didn't exist, it might be possible to set up defenses that would operate after a ship's arrival in the solar system but before it could do any damage; but as it is, they can dodge any defense we can devise. Is all that clear?\"  Anne nodded. \"Uh-hunh, I understood every word.\"  \"There is another thing about inter-planar travel that you ought to remember,\" said Bristol. \"When a ship returns to our universe, it causes a wide area disturbance; you have probably heard it called space shiver or the bong wave. The beta universe is so much smaller than our own alpha that you can imagine a spaceship when shifted toward it as being several beta light-years long. Now, if you think of a ship, moving between the alpha and beta lines on this envelope, as getting tangled in the dotted lines that connect the points on the two lines, that would mean that it would affect an area smaller than its own size on beta--a vastly larger area on alpha.  \"So when a ship returns to alpha, it 'twangs' those connecting lines, setting up a sort of shock in our universe covering a volume of space nearly a parsec in diameter. It makes a sort of 'bong' sound on your T.V. set. Naturally, this effect occurs simultaneously over the whole volume of space affected. As a result, when an invader arrives, using inter-planar ships, we know instantaneously he is in the vicinity. Unfortunately, his sudden appearance and the ease with which he can disappear makes it impossible, even with this knowledge, to make adequate preparations to receive him. Even if he is in serious trouble, he has gone again long before we can detect the bong.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"Well, dear,\" said Anne.  \"As usual, I'm sure you have made me understand perfectly. This time you did so well that I may still remember what stitching is by tomorrow. If the Oracle means anything at all by his statement, I suppose it means that we can use stitching to help defend ourselves, just as the invaders are using it to attack us. But the whole thing sounds completely silly to me. The Oracle, I mean.\"  Anne Bristol stood up, put her hands on her shapely hips and shook her head at her husband. \"Honestly,\" she said, \"you men are all alike. Paying so much attention to a toy you built yourself, and only last week you made fun of my going to a fortune teller. And the fuss you made about the ten dollars when you know it was worth every cent of it. She really told me the most amazing things. If you'd only let me tell you some of....\"  \"Darling!\" interrupted John with the hopeless patience of a harassed husband. \"It isn't the same thing at all. Buster isn't a fortune teller or the ghost of somebody's great aunt"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50940"],["title","Wailing Wall (#1)"],["body","ns. We couldn't trust them, Lee, even if we could understand them!\"  \"It's our job to understand them,\" Stryker said doggedly. \"Our function is to find colonies disoriented by the Hymenops and to set them straight if we can. If we can't, we call in a long-term reorientation crew, and within three generations the culture will pass again for Terran. The fact that slave colonies invariably lose their knowledge of longevity helps; they don't get it back until they're ready for it.  \"I've seen some pretty foul results of Hymenop experimenting on human colonies, Arthur. There was the ninth planet of Beta Pegasi--rediscovered in 3910, I think it was--that developed a religious fixation on fertility, a mania fostered by the Hymenops to supply expendable labor for their mines. The natives stopped mining when the Hymenops gave up the invasion and went back to 70 Ophiuchi, but they were still multiplying like rabbits when we found them. They followed a cultural conviction something like that observed in Oriental races of ancient Terran history, but they didn't pursue the Oriental tradition of sacrosancts. They couldn't--there were too many of them. By the time they were found, they numbered fourteen _billions_ and they were eating each other. Still it took only three generations to set them straight.\"  He took one of Farrell's cigarettes and puffed it placidly.  \"For that matter, Earth had her own share of eccentric cultures. I recall reading about one that existed as late as the twentieth century and equaled anything we're likely to find here. Any society should be geared to a set of social controls designed to furnish it, as a whole with a maximum of pleasure and a minimum of discomfort, but these ancient Terrestrial Dobuans--island aborigines, as I remember it--had adjusted to their total environment in a manner exactly opposite. They reversed the norm and became a society of paranoiacs, hating each other in direct ratio to nearness of relationship. Husbands and wives detested each other, sons and fathers--\"  \"Now you're pulling my leg,\" Farrell protested. \"A society like that would be too irrational to function.\"  \"But the system worked,\" Stryker insisted. \"It balanced well enough, as long as they were isolated. They accepted it because it was all they knew, and an abrupt reversal that negated their accustomed habits would create an impossible societal conflict. They were reoriented after the Fourth War, and succeeding generations adjusted to normal living without difficulty.\"  A sound from overhead made them look up. Gibson was standing in the _Marco's_ open port.  \"Conference,\" Gibson said in his heavy baritone, and went back inside.         *       *       *       *       *  They followed Gibson quickly and without question, more disturbed by the terse order than by the killing in the grass flats. Knowing Gibson, they realized that he would not have wasted even that one word unless emergency justified it.  They found him waiting in the chart room with Xavier. For the thousandth time, seeing the two together, Farrell found himself comparing them: the robot, smoothly functional from flexible gray plastoid body to featureless oval faceplate, blandly efficient, totally incapable of emotion; Gibson, short and dark and competent heavy-browed and humorless. Except for initiative, Farrell thought, the two of them could have traded identities and no one would have been able to notice any difference.  \"Xav and I found our Ringwave trouble,\" Gibson said. \"The generator is functioning, but the warp isn't going out. Something here on Sadr III is neutralizing it.\"  They stared at him as if he had just told them the planet was flat.  \"But a Ringwave can't be stopped completely, once it is started,\" Stryker protested. \"You'd have to dismantle it to shut it off, Gib!\"  \"The warping field can be damped out, though,\" Gibson said. \"Adjacent generators operating at different phase levels will heterodyne at a frequency representing the mean variance between levels. The resulting beat-phase will be too low to maintain either field, and one or the other, or both, will blank out. If you remember, all Terran-designed power plants are set to the same phase for that reason.\"  \"But these natives _can't_ have a Ringwave plant!\" Farrell argued. \"There's only this one village on Sadr III, Gib, an insignificant little agrarian township! If they had the Ringwave, they'd be mechanized. They'd have vehicles, landing ports....\"  \"The Hymenops had the Ringwave,\" Gibson interrupted. \"And they left the dome down there, the first undamaged one we've found. Figure it out for yourselves.\"  They digested the statement in silence. Stryker paled slowly, as if it needed time for apprehension to work its way through his fat bulk. Farrell's uneasiness, sourceless until now, grew to chill certainty.         *       *       *       *       *  \"I think I've expected this, without realizing it, since my first flight,\" he said. \"It stood to reason that the Hymenops would quit running somewhere, that we'd bump into them eventually out here on the fringes. Twenty thousand light-years back to 70 Ophiuchi is a long way to retreat.... Gib, do you think they're still here?\"  Gibson did not shrug, but his voice seemed to. \"It won't matter one way or the other unless we can clear the _Marco's_ generator.\"  From another man it might have been irony. Knowing Gibson, Farrell and Stryker accepted it as a bald statement of fact.  \"Then we're up against a Hymenop hive-mind,\" Stryker said. \"And we can't run away from it. Any suggestions?\"  \"We'll have to find the interfering generator and stop it,\" Farrell offered, knowing that was the only obvious solution.  \"One alternative,\" Gibson corrected. \"If we can determine what phase-level the interfering warp uses, we may be able to adjust the _Marco's_ generator to match it. Once they're in resonance, they won't interfere.\" He caught Stryker's unspoken question and answered it. \"It would take a week. Maybe longer.\"  Stryker vetoed the alternative. \"Too long. If there are Hymenops here, they won't give us that much time.\"  Farrell switched on the chart room scanning screen and centered it on the village downslope. Scattered cottages with dark tiled roofs and lamp-bright windows showed up clearly. Out of their undisciplined grouping swept the great hemispherical curve of the dome, glinting dully metallic in the starshine.  \"Maybe we're jumping to conclusions,\" he said. \"We've been here for five weeks without seeing a trace of Hymenops, and from what I've read of them, they'd have jumped us the minute we landed. Chances are that they left Sadr III in too great a hurry to wreck the dome, and their Ringwave power plant is still running.\"  \"You may be right,\" Stryker said, brightening. \"They carried the fight to us from the first skirmish, two hundred years ago, and they damned near beat us before we learned how to fight them.\"  He looked at Xavier's silent plastoid figure with something like affection. \"We'd have lost that war without Xave's kind. We couldn't match wits with Hymenop hive-minds, any more than a swarm of grasshoppers could stand up to a colony of wasps. But we made mechanicals that could. Cybernetic brains and servo-crews, ships that thought for themselves....\"  He squinted at the visiscreen with its cryptic, star-streaked dome. \"But they don't think as we do. They may have left a rear guard here, or they may have boobytrapped the dome.\"  \"One of us will have to find out which it is,\" Farrell said. He took a restless turn about the chart room, weighing the probabilities. \"It seems to fall in my department.\"  Stryker stared. \"You? Why?\"  \"Because I'm the only one who _can_ go. Remember what Gib said about changing the _Marco's_ Ringwave to resonate with the interfering generator? Gib can make the change; I can't. You're--\"  \"Too old and fat,\" Stryker finished for him. \"And too damned slow and garrulous. You're right, of course.\"  They let it go at that and put Xavier on guard for the night. The mechanical was infinitely more alert and sensitive to approach than any of the crew, but the knowledge did not make Farrell's sleep the sounder.  He dozed fitfully, waking a dozen times during the night to smoke cigarettes and to speculate fruitlessly on what he might find in the dome. He was sweating out a nightmare made hideous by monstrous bees that threatened him in buzzing alien voices when Xavier's polite monotone woke him for breakfast.         *       *       *       *       *  Farrell was halfway down the grassy slope to the village when he realized that the _Marco_ was still under watch. Approaching close enough for recognition, he saw that the sentry this time was Tarvil, the Sadrian who had first approached the ship. The native's glance took in Farrell's shoulder-pack of testing tools and audiphone, brushed the hand-torch and blast gun at the Terran's belt, and slid away without trace of expression.  \"I'm going into the dome,\" Farrell said. He tried to keep the uncertainty out of his voice, and felt a rasp of irritation when he failed. \"Is there a taboo against that?\"  The native fell in beside him without speaking and they went down together, walking a careful ten feet apart, through dew-drenched grass flats that gleamed like fields of diamonds under the early morning sun. From the village, as they approached, straggled the inevitable exodus of adults and half-grown children, moving silently out to the fields.  \"Weird beggars,\" Farrell said into his audiphone button. \"They don't even rub elbows at work. You'd think they were afraid of being contaminated.\"  Stryker's voice came tinnily in his ear. \"They won't seem so strange once we learn their motivations. I'm beginning to think this aloofness of theirs is a religious concomitant, Arthur, a hangover from slave-controls designed to prevent rebellion through isolation. Considering what they must have suffered under the Hymenops, it's a wonder they're even sane.\"  \"I'll grant "]]]
