Beyond this we have no right to expect; he would not charge his memory with regrets for people, who do not let his absence interfere with their pleasures or occupations.\"  \"Bravo, Miss Vernon! if he was some worthy curate, in a white tie and spectacles, you would not bustle up so warmly in his defence; but a handsome light dragoon, with moustache, and a long sword and spurs, and saucy 'make way for me look,' is another affair.\"  \"Wrong again, Mr. Winter,\" said Kate. \"I see no reason why a Lancer's cap may not cover as good qualities, as a clerical broad-brim--and I have been too long your pupil, not to appreciate form and color.\"  \"Good; and if every Lancer was like Captain Egerton, I, for one, would prefer trusting them, even in a confessional, to the white neck-clothed curates,\" chimed in the organist.  \"In truth, though Egerton is the type of a class I have always disliked, I cannot help liking him--especially when I think of his--pooh, pooh--I was forgetting--\" And Winter stopped abruptly.  \"You are mysterious,\" said the Colonel. \"But let me see the _Times_, at your house; I want to read the Indian news, that came by the last mail; and to see Mrs. Winter.\"  \"Do you really think you will go to Italy, Miss Vernon?\" asked Gilpin.  \"I fear it is problematical. I long to travel; but grandpapa has some business, and nurse has had a dream, which bodes evil for my wishes.\"  \"Oh, the dream ought not to be classed with the business.\"  \"I dare confess to you, and to you only,\" returned Kate, with a smile, \"that it seems to shake my hopes far more than the business.\"  \"The philosophic Miss Vernon--superstitious!\"  \"No, no! yet, you know--      'It may be a sound,     A tone of music, summer's eve, or spring;     A flower, the wind, the ocean, which shall wound,     Striking the electric chain wherewith we're darkly bound.'\"  \"Winter would say it was the east wind.\"  \"Perhaps so,\" said Miss Vernon, \"for alas! how ignominiously physical are the causes of many a tenderly poetic mood! not that I am at all addicted to such, but--\"  \"I think it is a mistake to consider everything physical, as despicable,\" observed Gilpin; \"we hear of mere physical force, mere physical wants; but the same hand made and blended our two natures, and we shall be happy and healthy, in proportion as we train both to work in harmony, without giving undue preference to either.\"  \"I often think we have a species of trinity within us,\" said Miss Vernon. \"We have sense with all its powerful tendencies in one direction, and spirit with its aspirations in another, while the heart and its affections seem to be neutral ground, where the claims of both may be adjusted.\"  \"I like the fancy; but sense gets the upper hand in many a heart.\"  \"No,\" interrupted Kate, \"the heart may be destroyed in the struggle, but while it exists, the spirit always has fair play.\"  \"Your sentence is too sweeping; in all such warfare, the variations are so delicately shaded that--\"  \"Walk in, Colonel,\" broke in Winter; \"never mind if Mrs. Winter is in or not; Gilpin, we'll have some Scotch broth for luncheon, that will set you up. I give you no choice--in you must come.\"  \"Sense must carry the day, Mr. Gilpin,\" said Kate, smiling.         *       *       *       *       *  Some days elapsed after this conversation before a reply from Mr. Moore reached the Colonel; and the anxiety he and Kate had experienced, died away into a half-forgetfulness.  It is strange how events, which at first strike us with such keen force, lose their sharpness of outline as the mind becomes accustomed to what was at first a novel aspect of affairs; and, as nothing fresh arises, we gradually sink back into our former frame of mind, or recur to that which distressed it, in momentary spasms of anxiety.  So Kate and her grandfather had quite recovered their usual serenity, and the former had written to Lady Desmond, long and affectionately; rejoicing that the cloud which had for a while interposed between them, had been dispersed; merely mentioning the obstacle to their journey, as a temporary annoyance, and speaking of its removal as a matter of certainty.  But she did not allude to it when in conversation with the Colonel, as she fancied he avoided the subject.  Such was their frame of mind when, at the usual post hour, one morning, Mrs. O'Toole entered.  \"A letther for the masther,\" a large, blue, pitiless looking envelop, such as emanate from attorneys' and merchants' offices, implacable places, sacrificial alters, where youth and joy, tenderness and the pleasant amenities of life are immolated at the shrine of the English juggernaut \"business.\"  The Colonel, keeping his eye fixed on it, felt in his pockets for his spectacles, silently, with a certain determination of manner, very different from the joyous confusion with which he sought for them, when opening Fred Egerton's letter; then with a loud hem, as if he wished to clear both throat and brains, he tore open the missive.  Kate sat opposite gazing at him, as if she could read the contents through his countenance; and although that morning she had risen with the full conviction that the anticipated letter would only prove their anxiety to be groundless, she now felt the terrible, creeping, gnawing, sickening sensation of doubt and dread which makes the hand so cold, and the eye so dim, when felt in its full force.  This however was her first and but slight experience of care, so she sat quite still, not knowing of what she thought, until her grandfather had turned over the second page of the rather lengthy epistle; and she could see the flourishing signature at the end of it. Still the Colonel did not speak, but turned back to re-read some passage, and Kate was surprised to find she had not courage to ask \"what news?\"  At last her grandfather without looking up, handed her the letter, observing--  \"Much what I ought to have anticipated; read it, my dear.\"  Kate, with a sensation of extreme repugnance, took the letter and read as follows:--                                             \"_Dublin, March 27th_, 18--.        \"MY DEAR SIR,   \"In reply to yours of the 21st inst., on the subject of Lady Desmond's  communication to Miss Vernon, it is true that the present Mr. Taaffe  has raised the question as to whether the debt to his uncle was paid;  seeing, on searching the records, that the judgments securing it  remain unsatisfied on the roll. But, as I concluded you got warrants  to satisfy them, at the time of the payment, I was not uneasy on the  subject, and thought it unnecessary to trouble you until I should  first search amongst your papers in my possession for them, which, as  yet, I have not done, as the matter was not pressing. If, however, you  did not get the necessary warrants to satisfy, as I begin to apprehend  was the case from the tenor of your letter, I fear we shall have some  trouble, as the present Mr. Taaffe affects to consider himself bound  to conclude the debt was not paid; and obliged, in his character  as executor of his late uncle, to call it in, altho' he knows, in  his heart, (as I firmly believe), the contrary. I trust, however,  although you may not, (from your unacquaintance with law terms and  forms) recollect what sort of acknowledgment you got at the time, it  will turn up to be a warrant to satisfy, or, if not, some docu-ment  sufficient to induce a court of equity to stay any proceedings Mr.  Taaffe may be advised to institute at law, on foot of the judgment.   \"You had better search diligently among your papers and send me  whatever you find, at all affecting this matter, and in the mean time  I will search also amongst those of yours in my possession.   \"With respectful compliments to Miss Vernon, I remain, my dear sir,  your faithful and obedient servant,                                                               \"J. MOORE.    \"To Colonel Vernon, &c.\"   Kate's first feeling was that of indignant scorn at such, to her  imagination, unheard of villany as that recorded in the letter she had  just perused; but she suppressed the expression of it, in order to  put the least gloomy view of the matter, her simple sense presented,  before her grandfather.   \"After all it is not so bad,\" she said, \"you see, Mr. Moore, only  anticipates, 'some trouble,' and surely there can be no doubt your  word would be taken, especially in Ireland, before any other man's  oath!\"   \"My dear Kate, '_some trouble_,' has a very vague meaning from a  solicitor; it may be a month's quibbling or forty years' litigation;  and in law there is no such thing as honour; every thing must be  proved; and though judge and jury may believe me incapable of wronging  Mr. Taaffe of one sou; yet, if I cannot bring _legal proof_, he must  succeed.\"   \"What a dishonest wretch he must be! but I always had a horror of the  name of Taaffe!\" cried Kate, the proud, indignant blood mounting to  her forehead.   \"Some association of ideas with Taffy's thieving propensities?\"  observed the Colonel, with an effort to be cheerful.   \"But, dear grandpapa, what is to be done? this letter leaves us just  in the same state of uncertainty we were in before.\"   \"We must search amongst all my papers, dear child, as Moore advises;  if I find any thing bearing on the subject, I will send it to him; but  I much fear I shall find nothing; I destroyed a great many papers,  as useless, on leaving Dungar, and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53358"],["title","\"War to the Knife;\" or, Tangata Maori (#1)"],["body"," and other remnants of the so-called \"black art.\" The seasons came and went, Massinger Chase grew fair in early spring and summer prime, the leaves of many autumns faded and fell, the heir grew from a rosy infant to a sturdy schoolboy--a tall stripling. Then the lady pined and withered, after lingering sadly in hope of the return of him who never again crossed the threshold of his ancient hall.  She was laid to rest with the dames of her race. An authentic statement of the death of Sir Rainauld reached England from abroad, and his son, Sir Alured, reigned in his stead.  Meanwhile, it had been discovered after his departure that large sums had been disbursed, and payments made to foreign personages. Warrants and vouchers, legally witnessed, were in the hands of financiers whose demands could not be legally resisted. Sale had to be made, with the concurrence of Sir Alured when he came of age, of portions of the estate, which seriously curtailed its area and importance. Sir Alured, however, an easy-going, unambitious youth, had promised his mother, of whom he was passionately fond, to break the entail. Contented with the field-sports and homely pleasures which there was no present danger of his being forced to relinquish, he cared little for the future. Notwithstanding the sacrifice of the goodly acres which (in addition to his portrait in the costume of a Roumanian heiduck, hanging in King Edward's corridor) gave Sir Rainauld's descendants something to remember him by, it had been found necessary to negotiate another loan upon the security of the estate. This was looked upon as an unimportant, easily released encumbrance at the time; but, like all the tentacles of the dire octopus, Debt, it had a tendency to draw the debtor closer to that gaping maw, down which in all ages have gone the old and worn, the young and fair, the strong and brave, all sorts and conditions of men.  Sir Alured had no desire to pry into the arcana of science, nor did he show curiosity about the transmutation of metals. Indolent, if not self-indulgent, he was wholly averse to the examination of accounts. The interest on the mortgage, with occasional loans, increased the liability notably before his death; so that when our hero, Sir Roland (an ancestor had fought at Roncesvalles), came into the estate on attaining his majority, he was startled at the portentous amount for which he stood liable to the mortgagee.  Being, however, for his age, a sensible young person, he set himself to live quietly, to reduce expenses, and in a general way to pay off his liabilities by degrees. Just as he had formed these meritorious resolves, rents commenced to fall. Old tenants, who had been punctual and regular of payment, began to decline from their proud position, asking for time, and, what was still worse, for abatement of rent. And with a show of reason. What with the importation of cheap meat, butter, wheat, and oats--all manner of farm produce, indeed, produced in colonies and other countries--the English farmer found himself unable to continue to pay rents calculated on prices which seemed to have fled for ever. It was hoped that farm commodities would regain their value, but they receded for the two years which were to see a recovery. Finally, after consultations with Messrs. Nourse and Lympett, it was decided that, at Sir Roland's present scale of expenditure, there needed to be no compulsory sale in his time. An heiress would set all right. Sir Roland must marry money. It was his duty to his family, his duty to the county, his duty to England.  Then Massinger Court could be restored to its former splendour, and the estate to its legitimate position in the county.  Sir Roland did not assent or otherwise to these propositions. He did not particularly want to marry--just yet, at all events. He was too happy and comfortable as he was. Even with his curtailed revenues, he found the position of a country gentleman pleasant and satisfactory. He was not expected to do much, whereas everybody, old and young, were most anxious to make themselves useful and agreeable to him. Of course a man must marry some day.  So much was clearly the duty of the heir of Massinger. The ancient house must not be suffered to become extinct.  Strangely enough, the succession had always gone in the direct line. But there was no hurry. He had not seen any one so far on whom he was passionately anxious to confer the title of Lady Massinger. So, matters might be worse. In this philosophical frame of mind, he told himself that he was content to remain a bachelor for the next half-dozen years or so, during which period his pecuniary affairs might be expected to improve rather than otherwise.  At eight and twenty a man is young--very young indeed, as occasionally reflects the middle-aged _viveur_, looking regretfully back on the feats and feelings of his lost youth. Sir Roland was fairly well equipped, according to the society needs of the day. An Oxford degree taken creditably guaranteed all reasonable literary attainment; at any rate, the means and method of further development. Fond of field-sports, he shot brilliantly and rode well. Vigorous and active, neither plain nor handsome, but having an air of distinction--that subtle but unmistakeable accompaniment of race--he yet presented few points of divergence from the tens of thousands of youthful Britons capable, in time of need, of calm heroism and Spartan endurance, but unaware of any pressing necessity for stepping out of the beaten track.  Though unostentatious by nature and habit, it was not to be supposed that the name of Sir Roland Massinger, of Massinger Court, was unfamiliar to matrons with marriageable daughters, as well in his own county, as in the Mayfair gatherings which he did not disdain during the season.  More than one of his fair partners would not have objected to bear his name and title embellished, as his position could not fail to be, by the handsome settlements which her father's steadfast attention to trade would enable him to make.  But, so far, all appreciative reception of his ordinary courtesies--the sudden glance, the winning smile, the interested attention to his unstudied talk, conservatory lounges, country-house visits--all the harmless catalogue of the boy-god's snares and springes, were wasted on this careless wayfarer, protected by a lofty ideal and an untouched heart.  Though he had listened politely to the prudent counsel of his man of business as to the necessity of repairing his attenuated fortune by marriage, such an arrangement had never been seriously contemplated by him. He felt himself capable of a passionate attachment to the princess of his dreams, could Fate but lead him into her presence. Not as yet had he encountered her. That was beyond doubt. He would await the voice of the oracle. In the meanwhile he was far from being _ennuyé_. There was a mildly pleasurable sensation in merely contemplating \"the supreme psychological moment\" from afar, and speculating as to situations not yet arisen. He awaited in resigned contentment the goddess-moulded maiden. In the meanwhile he was not minded to worship at the shrines of the lesser divinities.  Was Fate, unsmiling, ironic, even now listening to the too-presumptuous mortal?  It would appear so. For, shortly after making these prudential resolutions, he met at a military ball the beautiful Hypatia Tollemache, who decided the question of elective affinity once and for ever. One look, a brief study of her unrivalled graces, an introduction, an entrancing interchange of ideas after a deliriously thrilling dance--even a second waltz, perilously near the end of the evening--and the solemn chime from the ancient tower, found an echo in his heart, which seemed to ring \"forever, ever, ever, forever.\"  That there are moments like this in men's lives, fateful, irrevocable, who may doubt? Sir Roland did not, at any rate. All the forces of his nature were aroused, electrically stimulated, magnified in power and volume. As they separated conventionally, and he delivered her into the care of her chaperon, the parting smile with which she favoured him seemed the invitation of an angelic visitant. He could have cast himself at her feet, had not the formalism of this too-artificial age forbidden such abasement.  When he returned to the country house where he was staying, he examined himself closely as to his sensations.  How had he, the cool and indifferent Roland Massinger, come to be so affected by this--by _any_ girl? He could almost believe in the philtre of the ancients. It wasn't the champagne; he had forgotten all about it, besides being by habit abstemious. Supper he had hardly touched. It could not even be a form of indigestion--here he laughed aloud. Surely his reason wasn't giving way? He had heard of abnormal brain-seizures. But he was not the sort of man. He had never worked hard, though steadily at college. And, when a man's appetite, sleep, and general health were faultless, what could have caused this dire mental disturbance? He went to bed, but sleep was out of the question. Throwing open the window, he gazed over the hushed landscape. The moon, immemorial friend of lovers, came to his aid. Slowly and majestically she rose, silvering over the ruined abbey, the ghostly avenue, the far-seen riverpools, as with calm, luminous, resistless ascent, she floated higher and yet higher through the cloud-world. Gradually his troubled spirit recognized the peaceful influence. His mind became composed, and betaking himself to bed, he sank into a slumber from which he was only aroused by the dressing-bell.  The cheerful converse of a country-house breakfast succeeding a prolonged shower-bath and a satisfactory toilette, restored him to a condition more nearly resembling his usual frame of mind. He was, however, rallied as to his sudden subjugation, which had not escaped the keen critics of a ball-room. In defence, he went so far as to admit that Miss"]]]
