Then they all went on their journey and soon came to the place where Lehi and those who were with him were stopping.  This story shows again how the Lord watches over those who do right, and how he keeps them from harm when the wicked try to hurt them. Each time when Nephi was in danger the Lord saved him from all harm. This was because Nephi was a good man, and was obedient and faithful to the Lord. He was also obedient to his father Lehi, who loved him very much.  [Image captioned: \"NEPHI'S BRETHREN SEEK HIS LIFE.\"]  Points to be remembered in this story: Lehi's sons sent to Jerusalem a second time--Their errand is to invite a man named Ishmael and his family to join their father's family in the wilderness--As the Lord intended to lead Lehi and his family to a new country where there were no people, it was desirable that Ishmael go with them--Ishmael had several daughters, whom it was expected would become the wives of Lehi's sons--Ishmael and family agree to go into the wilderness--After starting Laman and Lemuel and some of Ishmael's family rebel and want to turn back--Nephi encourages them to keep on their journey--They become angry at Nephi and bind him with cords, intending to kill him--Nephi prays and the Lord loosens the cords and he gets free--Again Nephi's older brothers want to take his life, but Ishmael's wife and her son and daughter stop them and persuade them to leave him alone--Afterwards Laman and Lemuel are sorry and ask Nephi to forgive them--Nephi forgives his brothers and they all go on their journey and come to the place where Lehi is stopping--The Lord always takes care of those who obey Him.    LEHI AND HIS SONS.  NEPHI'S VISION.  While Lehi was in the wilderness the Lord showed him in visions many things that would happen in the world a long time afterwards. A vision is something like a dream in which a person sees things as they really are or as they will be. When a vision is from the Lord that which is shown is something that has or will really happen. The way the Lord tells His prophets about what is going to take place is often by showing them a vision or a dream in which they see what is going to happen just as it will be when it takes place.  When Lehi had these visions he told about them to his children. Nephi was so interested or pleased with what his father told him that he wanted to see the visions for himself. So he prayed often to the Lord and asked Him to show him the things that his father Lehi saw. Nephi had such strong faith that he was enabled to receive an answer to his prayers.  At one time, when Nephi was thinking about what his father had seen, a vision of the Lord came to him. In this vision he was taken up into a high mountain. An angel of the Lord spoke to him and asked him what he desired. Nephi said he wished to see what his father had seen. The angel said to Nephi \"Look!\" Nephi looked and he saw Jerusalem as it would appear in six hundred years to come. Then he saw other cities. In the city of Nazareth which was near Jerusalem he saw a very beautiful virgin or young woman. The angel said this was the mother of the Savior.  [Image captioned \"NEPHI'S VISION.\"]  Soon after he looked again and saw this beautiful young woman with a child in her arms. The angel told Nephi that the child was the Savior, and that after many years from that time He would be born and live upon the earth. Nephi then saw the Savior grown to manhood, and He went to John the baptist to be baptized. After this the Spirit of God, or the Holy Ghost rested upon the Savior and He went about teaching the people the gospel, telling them how they should live. He also healed the sick, and the blind and the lame, and raised dead persons to life. Nephi continued to look upon the vision and he saw the Savior taken by the wicked people and nailed to a cross and left there to die. The angel explained to Nephi that in this way the Savior would die for the sins of the world.  Afterwards appeared the Savior's apostles and then he saw that the wicked people in the world fought against the church the Savior started on the earth, and killed the saints who belonged to the church; then the people in the world were left for a long time without the gospel.  Many other things that have happened in the world since that time were seen by Nephi. He also saw things that have happened in this time when we live.  All the things which Nephi saw in this great vision came to pass just as he saw them many hundreds of years before. The Savior was born six hundred years after Nephi saw Him in this vision. His mother lived in the city of Nazareth where Nephi saw her. The Savior was baptized and went about teaching the people, healing the sick, the blind and the lame, and raising the dead. He was crucified, too, just as Nephi saw He would be; and the church which He started was destroyed on the earth, the saints being put to death by wicked men.  From this story we may learn that the Lord knows all about what will happen in this world. He knew before the world was made what would take place in the thousands of years to come. The Lord knows all things. He knows what each one of us may do or say. He even knows what we think, when we do not act or speak. When we say or do anything that is not right He knows about it, and is displeased. When we do good He sees it, and is pleased with us. If we try always to do right He will love us and will help us to do good.  We learn also from this story that the Lord tells good men about many things that are going to take place before they do happen. This is because He loves them.  By knowing what is going to happen beforehand these good men can often save themselves from danger or trouble.  In this way Lehi and his family were saved from death by leaving Jerusalem before it was destroyed. Lehi tried also to save the people of Jerusalem by telling them what was going to happen, but they would not believe him. They were so wicked they tried to kill him, and he had to leave to save his own life.  Points to be remembered in this story: Lehi sees many things in visions--He tells about them to his family--Nephi so pleased with hearing what his father tells he desires to see the things himself--An angel shows him a beautiful vision in which he sees the Savior and His mother--He also sees the Savior teaching the people and healing the sick--Sees Him nailed to a cross--Sees what happens afterwards--His church destroyed--The Lord knows all things--He tells His prophets many things that are going to take place.    LEHI AND HIS SONS.  THEY CONTINUE THEIR JOURNEY.  When Lehi moved into the wilderness he went as the Lord guided him. He was told that he would be led to a choice land, and he trusted in the Lord to be guided in the right direction.  Lehi and his company had been camping by the shore of the Red Sea for some time, when one night the Lord told Lehi to start again on his journey the next morning. He did not know which way to go, but he knew the Lord would show him, as He had done before.  The next morning when Lehi arose he saw lying on the ground near his tent door a ball made of fine brass. It was curiously formed. Inside the ball were two spindles, or needles. One of these needles pointed in the direction the people were to travel. The Lord had placed this ball by Lehi's tent door that he might use it as a guide on his journey. Lehi called this ball liahona.  As the Lord commanded, Lehi's company gathered up their property, their tents, provisions and seeds of all kinds, and started in the direction that was pointed out by the liahona, or brass ball. The reason they took seeds with them was that they might plant them in the country to which they were going. As they traveled along they camped from time to time in order to get food. While stopping at camp the men would take their bows and arrows and hunt animals, which they killed for food. In those days they did not have guns, as people have now. They used bows and arrows, and sometimes slings with which they would throw stones. They did not make fires to cook their food, but ate the meat raw. The Lord blessed the food for their sakes and it made them strong and healthy.  [Image captioned \"LEHI FINDS THE LIAHONA.\"]  Sometimes it was hard for the men to get enough food for all the company. The animals were not very plentiful, although the road they took was through the best part of the country, along the side of the Red Sea. But much of the country through which they traveled was rocky and barren. There was but little water to be found.  At one time when the company stopped Nephi broke his bow while he and his brethren were hunting. His brothers' bows about the same time lost their springs and were not as good as they had been. On this account they returned to camp without killing any animals, and so they were left without food.  Their bows were made of steel, and they had no way of mending them when broken. As they depended on these weapons for food they felt very sorrowful when Nephi's bow was broken. The people were hungry, and they did not know what to do to get food. Laman and Lemuel and the sons of Ishmael began to complain very much. Even Lehi complained at this time, for they were all suffering for food, and it was a very hard trial to them.  At last Nephi made a bow of wood, and out of a straight stick made an arrow. He then asked his father where he should go to get food. Lehi, not knowing where to direct him, inquired of the Lord. The Lord told Lehi to look at the ball of brass which he had found near his tent door. He did so, and there on the ball was writing which told just where he should go.  Lehi and Nephi found that the ball or liahona directed them according to their faith. When they lost faith it would not direct them, but when their faith was strong it would show them where to go or what to do.  According to the directions on the ball Nephi went"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51096"],["title","The Mormons: A Discourse Delivered Before the Historical Society of Pennsylvania (#1)"],["body","up on a piece of drift wood outside.  Dreadful, indeed, was the suffering of these forsaken beings. Cowed and cramped by cold and sunburn, alternating as each weary day and night dragged on, they were, almost all of them, the crippled victims of disease. They were there because they had no homes, nor hospital nor poor-house nor friends to offer them any. They could not satisfy the feeble cravings of their sick: they had not bread to quiet the fractious hunger cries of their children. Mothers and babes, daughters and grandparents, all of them alike, were bivouacked in tatters, wanting even covering to comfort those whom the sick shiver of fever was searching to the marrow.  These were Mormons, famishing, in Lee county, Iowa, in the fourth week of the month of September, in the year of our Lord 1846. The city,--it was Nauvoo, Illinois. The Mormons were the owners of that city, and the smiling country round. And those who had stopped their ploughs, who had silenced their hammers, their axes, their shuttles and their workshop wheels; those who had put out their fires, who had eaten their food, spoiled their orchards, and trampled under foot their thousands of acres of unharvested bread; these,--were the keepers of their dwellings, the carousers in their Temple,--whose drunken riot insulted the ears of their dying.  I think it was as I turned from the wretched night-watch of which I have spoken, that I first listened to the sounds of revel of a party of the guard within the city. Above the distant hum of the voices of many, occasionally rose distinct the loud oath-tainted exclamation, and the falsely intonated scrap of vulgar song;--but lest this requiem should go unheeded, every now and then, when their boisterous orgies strove to attain a sort of ecstatic climax, a cruel spirit of insulting frolic carried some of them up into the high belfry of the Temple steeple, and there, with the wicked childishness of inebriates, they whooped, and shrieked, and beat the drum that I had seen, and rang in charivaric unison their loud-tongued steam-boat bell.  They were, all told, not more than six hundred and forty persons who were thus lying on the river flats. But the Mormons in Nauvoo and its dependencies had been numbered the year before at over twenty thousand. Where were they? They had last been seen, carrying in mournful trains their sick and wounded, halt and blind, to disappear behind the western horizon, pursuing the phantom of another home. Hardly anything else was known of them: and people asked with curiosity, What had been their fate--what their fortunes?  I purpose making these questions the subject of my Lecture. Since the expulsion of the Mormons, to the present date, I have been intimately conversant with the details of their history. But I shall invite your attention most particularly to an account of what happened to them during their first year in the Wilderness; because at this time more than any other, being lost to public view, they were the subjects of fable and misconception. Happily, it was during this period I myself moved with them; and earned, at dear price, as some among you are aware, my right to speak with authority of them and their character, their trials, achievements and intentions.  The party encountered by me at the river shore were the last of the Mormons that left the city. They had all of them engaged the year before, that they would vacate their homes, and seek some other place of refuge. It had been the condition of a truce between them and their assailants; and as an earnest of their good faith, the chief elders and some others of obnoxious standing, with their families, were to set out for the West in the Spring of 1846. It had been stipulated in return, that the rest of the Mormons might remain behind in the peaceful enjoyment of their Illinois abode, until their leaders, with their exploring party, could with all diligence select for them a new place of settlement beyond the Rocky Mountains, in California, or elsewhere, and until they had opportunity to dispose to the best advantage of the property which they were then to leave.  Some renewed symptoms of hostile feeling had, however, determined the pioneer party to begin their work before the Spring. It was, of course, anticipated that this would be a perilous service; but it was regarded as a matter of self-denying duty. The ardor and emulation of many, particularly the devout and the young, were stimulated by the difficulties it involved; and the ranks of the party were therefore filled up with volunteers from among the most effective and responsible members of the sect. They began their march in midwinter; and by the beginning of February, nearly all of them were on the road, many of their wagons having crossed the Mississippi on the ice.  Under the most favoring circumstances, an expedition of this sort, undertaken at such a season of the year, could scarcely fail to be disastrous. [A] But the pioneer company had to set out in haste, and were very imperfectly supplied with necessaries. The cold was intense. They moved in the teeth of keen-edged northwest winds, such as sweep down the Iowa peninsula from the ice-bound regions of the timber-shaded Slave Lake and Lake of the Woods: on the Bald Prairie there, nothing above the dead grass breaks their free course over the hard rolled hills. Even along the scattered water courses, where they broke the thick ice to give their cattle drink, the annual autumn fires had left little wood of value. The party, therefore, often wanted for good camp fires, the first luxury of all travellers; but to men insufficiently furnished with tents and other appliances of shelter, almost an essential to life. After days of fatigue, their nights were often passed in restless efforts to save themselves from freezing. Their stock of food also proved inadequate; and as their systems became impoverished, their suffering from cold increased.  Sickened with catarrhal affections, manacled by the fetters of dreadfully acute rheumatisms, some contrived for a-while to get over the shortening day's march, and drag along some others. But the sign of an impaired circulation soon began to show itself in the liability of all to be dreadfully frost-bitten. The hardiest and strongest became helplessly crippled. About the same time, the strength of their beasts of draught began to fail. The small supply of provender they could carry with them had given out. The winter-bleached prairie straw proved devoid of nourishment; and they could only keep them from starving by seeking for the browse, as it is called, or green bark and tender buds and branches, of the cotton-wood and other stinted growths of the hollows.  To return to Nauvoo was apparently the only escape; but this would have been to give occasion for fresh mistrust, and so to bring new trouble to those they had left there behind them. They resolved at least to hold their ground, and to advance as they might, were it only by limping through the deep snows a few slow miles a day. They found a sort of comfort in comparing themselves to the Exiles of Siberia, [B] and sought cheerfulness in earnest prayings for the Spring,--longed for as morning by the tossing sick.  The Spring came at last. It overtook them in the Sac and Fox country, still on the naked prairie, not yet half way over the trail they were following between the Mississippi and Missouri rivers. But it brought its own share of troubles with it. The months with which it opened proved nearly as trying as the worst of winter.  The snow and sleet and rain, which fell as it appeared to them without intermission, made the road over the rich prairie soil as impassable as one vast bog of heavy black mud. Sometimes they would fasten the horses and oxen of four or five wagons to one, and attempt to get ahead in this way, taking turns; but at the close of a day of hard toil for themselves and their cattle, they would find themselves a quarter or half a mile from the place they left in the morning. The heavy rains raised all the water-courses: the most trifling streams were impassable. Wood fit for bridging was often not to be had, and in such cases the only resource was to halt for the freshets to subside,--a matter in the case of the headwaters of the Chariton, for instance, of over three weeks' delay.  These were dreary waitings upon Providence. The most spirited and sturdy murmured most at their forced inactivity. And even the women, whose heroic spirits had been proof against the lowest thermometric fall, confessed their tempers fluctuated with the ceaseless variations of the barometer. They complained, too, that the health of their children suffered more. It was the fact, that the open winds of March and April brought with them more mortal sickness than the sharpest freezing weather.  The frequent burials made the hardiest sicken. On the soldier's march, it is a matter of discipline, that after the rattle of musketry over his comrade's grave, he shall tramp it to the music of some careless tune in a lively quick-step. But, in the Mormon camp, the companion who lay ill and gave up the ghost within view of all, all saw as he lay stretched a corpse, and all attended to his last resting-place. It was a sorrow then, too, of itself to simple-hearted people, the deficient pomps of their imperfect style of funeral. The general hopefulness of human,--including Mormon--nature, was well illustrated by the fact, that the most provident were found unfurnished with undertaker's articles; so that bereaved affection was driven to the most melancholy makeshifts.  The best expedient generally was to cut down a log of some eight or nine feet long, and slitting it longitudinally, strip off its dark bark in two half cylinders. These, placed around the body of the deceased, and bound firmly together with withes made of the alburnum, formed a rough sort of tubular coffin, which surviving relatives and friends, with a little show"]]]
