They also did the duty of trusty watchers, for they were a dangerous foe for any intruder who, under the shadow of the night, might attempt to violate a grave.  Thus--on that summer evening of the year 1352 B.C., when we invite the reader to accompany us to the Necropolis of Thebes--after the priests’ hymn had died away, all was still in the City of the Dead.  The soldiers on guard were already returning from their first round when suddenly, on the north side of the Necropolis, a dog barked loudly; soon a second took up the cry, a third, a fourth. The captain of the watch called to his men to halt, and, as the cry of the dogs spread and grew louder every minute, commanded them to march towards the north.  The little troop had reached the high dyke which divided the west bank of the Nile from a branch canal, and looked from thence over the plain as far as the river and to the north of the Necropolis. Once more the word to “halt” was given, and as the guard perceived the glare of torches in the direction where the dogs were barking loudest, they hurried forward and came up with the author of the disturbance near the Pylon of the temple erected by Seti I., the deceased father of the reigning King Rameses II.     [The two pyramidal towers joined by a gateway which formed the    entrance to an Egyptian temple were called the Pylon.]  The moon was up, and her pale light flooded the stately structure, while the walls glowed with the ruddy smoky light of the torches which flared in the hands of black attendants.  A man of sturdy build, in sumptuous dress, was knocking at the brass-covered temple door with the metal handle of a whip, so violently that the blows rang far and loud through the night. Near him stood a litter, and a chariot, to which were harnessed two fine horses. In the litter sat a young woman, and in the carriage, next to the driver, was the tall figure of a lady. Several men of the upper classes and many servants stood around the litter and the chariot. Few words were exchanged; the whole attention of the strangely lighted groups seemed concentrated on the temple-gate. The darkness concealed the features of individuals, but the mingled light of the moon and the torches was enough to reveal to the gate-keeper, who looked down on the party from a tower of the Pylon, that it was composed of persons of the highest rank; nay, perhaps of the royal family.  He called aloud to the one who knocked, and asked him what was his will.  He looked up, and in a voice so rough and imperious, that the lady in the litter shrank in horror as its tones suddenly violated the place of the dead, he cried out--“How long are we to wait here for you--you dirty hound? Come down and open the door and then ask questions. If the torch-light is not bright enough to show you who is waiting, I will score our name on your shoulders with my whip, and teach you how to receive princely visitors.”  While the porter muttered an unintelligible answer and came down the steps within to open the door, the lady in the chariot turned to her impatient companion and said in a pleasant but yet decided voice, “You forget, Paaker, that you are back again in Egypt, and that here you have to deal not with the wild Schasu,--[A Semitic race of robbers in the cast of Egypt.]--but with friendly priests of whom we have to solicit a favor. We have always had to lament your roughness, which seems to me very ill-suited to the unusual circumstances under which we approach this sanctuary.”  Although these words were spoken in a tone rather of regret than of blame, they wounded the sensibilities of the person addressed; his wide nostrils began to twitch ominously, he clenched his right hand over the handle of his whip, and, while he seemed to be bowing humbly, he struck such a heavy blow on the bare leg of a slave who was standing near to him, an old Ethiopian, that he shuddered as if from sudden cold, though-knowing his lord only too well--he let no cry of pain escape him. Meanwhile the gate-keeper had opened the door, and with him a tall young priest stepped out into the open air to ask the will of the intruders.  Paaker would have seized the opportunity of speaking, but the lady in the chariot interposed and said:  “I am Bent-Anat, the daughter of the King, and this lady in the litter is Nefert, the wife of the noble Mena, the charioteer of my father. We were going in company with these gentlemen to the north-west valley of the Necropolis to see the new works there. You know the narrow pass in the rocks which leads up the gorge. On the way home I myself held the reins and I had the misfortune to drive over a girl who sat by the road with a basket full of flowers, and to hurt her--to hurt her very badly I am afraid. The wife of Mena with her own hands bound up the child, and then she carried her to her father’s house--he is a paraschites--[One who opened the bodies of the dead to prepare them for being embalmed.]--Pinem is his name. I know not whether he is known to you.”  “Thou hast been into his house, Princess?”  “Indeed, I was obliged, holy father,” she replied, “I know of course that I have defiled myself by crossing the threshold of these people, but--”  “But,” cried the wife of Mena, raising herself in her litter, “Bent-Anat can in a day be purified by thee or by her house-priest, while she can hardly--or perhaps never--restore the child whole and sound again to the unhappy father.”  “Still, the den of a paraschites is above every thing unclean,” said the chamberlain Penbesa, master of the ceremonies to the princess, interrupting the wife of Mena, “and I did not conceal my opinion when Bent-Anat announced her intention of visiting the accursed hole in person. I suggested,” he continued, turning to the priest, “that she should let the girl be taken home, and send a royal present to the father.”  “And the princess?” asked the priest.  “She acted, as she always does, on her own judgment,” replied the master of the ceremonies.  “And that always hits on the right course,” cried the wife of Mena.  “Would to God it were so!” said the princess in a subdued voice. Then she continued, addressing the priest, “Thou knowest the will of the Gods and the hearts of men, holy father, and I myself know that I give alms willingly and help the poor even when there is none to plead for them but their poverty. But after what has occurred here, and to these unhappy people, it is I who come as a suppliant.”  “Thou?” said the chamberlain.  “I,” answered the princess with decision. The priest who up to this moment had remained a silent witness of the scene raised his right hand as in blessing and spoke.  “Thou hast done well. The Hathors fashioned thy heart and the Lady of Truth guides it. Thou hast broken in on our night-prayers to request us to send a doctor to the injured girl?”     [Hathor was Isis under a substantial form. She is the goddess of    the pure, light heaven, and bears the Sun-disk between cow-horns on    a cow’s head or on a human head with cow’s ears. She was named the    Fair, and all the pure joys of life are in her gift. Later she was    regarded as a Muse who beautifies life with enjoyment, love, song,    and the dance. She appears as a good fairy by the cradle of    children and decides their lot in life. She bears many names: and    several, generally seven, Hathors were represented, who personified    the attributes and influence of the goddess.]  “Thou hast said.”  “I will ask the high-priest to send the best leech for outward wounds immediately to the child. But where is the house of the paraschites Pinem? I do not know it.”  “Northwards from the terrace of Hatasu,--[A great queen of the 18th dynasty and guardian of two Pharaohs]--close to--; but I will charge one of my attendants to conduct the leech. Besides, I want to know early in the morning how the child is doing.--Paaker.”  The rough visitor, whom we already know, thus called upon, bowed to the earth, his arms hanging by his sides, and asked:  “What dost thou command?”  “I appoint you guide to the physician,” said the princess. “It will be easy to the king’s pioneer to find the little half-hidden house again--     [The title here rendered pioneer was that of an officer whose duties    were those at once of a scout and of a Quarter-Master General. In    unknown and comparatively savage countries it was an onerous post.    --Translator.]  besides, you share my guilt, for,” she added, turning to the priest, “I confess that the misfortune happened because I would try with my horses to overtake Paaker’s Syrian racers, which he declared to be swifter than the Egyptian horses. It was a mad race.”  “And Amon be praised that it ended as it did,” exclaimed the master of the ceremonies. “Packer’s chariot lies dashed in pieces in the valley, and his best horse is badly hurt.”  “He will see to him when he has taken the physician to the house of the paraschites,” said the princess. “Dost thou know, Penbesa--thou anxious guardian of a thoughtless girl--that to-day for the first time I am glad that my father is at the war in distant Satiland?”--[Asia].  “He would not have welcomed us kindly!” said the master of the ceremonies, laughing.  “But the leech, the leech!” cried Bent-Anat. “Packer, it is settled then. You will conduct him, and bring us to-morrow morning news of the wounded girl.”  Paaker bowed; the princess bowed her head; the priest and his companions, who meanwhile had come out of the temple and joined him, raised their hands in blessing, and the belated procession moved towards the Nile.  Paaker remained alone with his two slaves; the commission with which the princess had charged him greatly displeased him.

The world was at least ignorant of its bereavement, while to me it was a real and terrible actuality.  \"What can we do?\" I asked, hiding my perturbation beneath the mask of a low and level voice.  \"We may stop here, and die of asphyxiation when our atmosphere tanks are empty,\" replied Perry, \"or we may continue on with the slight hope that we may later sufficiently deflect the prospector from the vertical to carry us along the arc of a great circle which must eventually return us to the surface.  If we succeed in so doing before we reach the higher internal temperature we may even yet survive.  There would seem to me to be about one chance in several million that we shall succeed--otherwise we shall die more quickly but no more surely than as though we sat supinely waiting for the torture of a slow and horrible death.\"  I glanced at the thermometer.  It registered 110 degrees.  While we were talking the mighty iron mole had bored its way over a mile into the rock of the earth's crust.  \"Let us continue on, then,\" I replied.  \"It should soon be over at this rate.  You never intimated that the speed of this thing would be so high, Perry.  Didn't you know it?\"  \"No,\" he answered.  \"I could not figure the speed exactly, for I had no instrument for measuring the mighty power of my generator.  I reasoned, however, that we should make about five hundred yards an hour.\"  \"And we are making seven miles an hour,\" I concluded for him, as I sat with my eyes upon the distance meter.  \"How thick is the Earth's crust, Perry?\" I asked.  \"There are almost as many conjectures as to that as there are geologists,\" was his answer.  \"One estimates it thirty miles, because the internal heat, increasing at the rate of about one degree to each sixty to seventy feet depth, would be sufficient to fuse the most refractory substances at that distance beneath the surface.  Another finds that the phenomena of precession and nutation require that the earth, if not entirely solid, must at least have a shell not less than eight hundred to a thousand miles in thickness.  So there you are.  You may take your choice.\"  \"And if it should prove solid?\" I asked.  \"It will be all the same to us in the end, David,\" replied Perry.  \"At the best our fuel will suffice to carry us but three or four days, while our atmosphere cannot last to exceed three.  Neither, then, is sufficient to bear us in the safety through eight thousand miles of rock to the antipodes.\"  \"If the crust is of sufficient thickness we shall come to a final stop between six and seven hundred miles beneath the earth's surface; but during the last hundred and fifty miles of our journey we shall be corpses.  Am I correct?\" I asked.  \"Quite correct, David.  Are you frightened?\"  \"I do not know.  It all has come so suddenly that I scarce believe that either of us realizes the real terrors of our position.  I feel that I should be reduced to panic; but yet I am not.  I imagine that the shock has been so great as to partially stun our sensibilities.\"  Again I turned to the thermometer.  The mercury was rising with less rapidity.  It was now but 140 degrees, although we had penetrated to a depth of nearly four miles.  I told Perry, and he smiled.  \"We have shattered one theory at least,\" was his only comment, and then he returned to his self-assumed occupation of fluently cursing the steering wheel.  I once heard a pirate swear, but his best efforts would have seemed like those of a tyro alongside of Perry's masterful and scientific imprecations.  Once more I tried my hand at the wheel, but I might as well have essayed to swing the earth itself.  At my suggestion Perry stopped the generator, and as we came to rest I again threw all my strength into a supreme effort to move the thing even a hair's breadth--but the results were as barren as when we had been traveling at top speed.  I shook my head sadly, and motioned to the starting lever.  Perry pulled it toward him, and once again we were plunging downward toward eternity at the rate of seven miles an hour.  I sat with my eyes glued to the thermometer and the distance meter.  The mercury was rising very slowly now, though even at 145 degrees it was almost unbearable within the narrow confines of our metal prison.  About noon, or twelve hours after our start upon this unfortunate journey, we had bored to a depth of eighty-four miles, at which point the mercury registered 153 degrees F.  Perry was becoming more hopeful, although upon what meager food he sustained his optimism I could not conjecture.  From cursing he had turned to singing--I felt that the strain had at last affected his mind.  For several hours we had not spoken except as he asked me for the readings of the instruments from time to time, and I announced them.  My thoughts were filled with vain regrets.  I recalled numerous acts of my past life which I should have been glad to have had a few more years to live down.  There was the affair in the Latin Commons at Andover when Calhoun and I had put gunpowder in the stove--and nearly killed one of the masters.  And then--but what was the use, I was about to die and atone for all these things and several more.  Already the heat was sufficient to give me a foretaste of the hereafter.  A few more degrees and I felt that I should lose consciousness.  \"What are the readings now, David?\" Perry's voice broke in upon my somber reflections.  \"Ninety miles and 153 degrees,\" I replied.  \"Gad, but we've knocked that thirty-mile-crust theory into a cocked hat!\" he cried gleefully.  \"Precious lot of good it will do us,\" I growled back.  \"But my boy,\" he continued, \"doesn't that temperature reading mean anything to you?  Why it hasn't gone up in six miles.  Think of it, son!\"  \"Yes, I'm thinking of it,\" I answered; \"but what difference will it make when our air supply is exhausted whether the temperature is 153 degrees or 153,000?  We'll be just as dead, and no one will know the difference, anyhow.\" But I must admit that for some unaccountable reason the stationary temperature did renew my waning hope.  What I hoped for I could not have explained, nor did I try.  The very fact, as Perry took pains to explain, of the blasting of several very exact and learned scientific hypotheses made it apparent that we could not know what lay before us within the bowels of the earth, and so we might continue to hope for the best, at least until we were dead--when hope would no longer be essential to our happiness.  It was very good, and logical reasoning, and so I embraced it.  At one hundred miles the temperature had DROPPED TO 152 1/2 DEGREES! When I announced it Perry reached over and hugged me.  From then on until noon of the second day, it continued to drop until it became as uncomfortably cold as it had been unbearably hot before. At the depth of two hundred and forty miles our nostrils were assailed by almost overpowering ammonia fumes, and the temperature had dropped to TEN BELOW ZERO!  We suffered nearly two hours of this intense and bitter cold, until at about two hundred and forty-five miles from the surface of the earth we entered a stratum of solid ice, when the mercury quickly rose to 32 degrees.  During the next three hours we passed through ten miles of ice, eventually emerging into another series of ammonia-impregnated strata, where the mercury again fell to ten degrees below zero.  Slowly it rose once more until we were convinced that at last we were nearing the molten interior of the earth.  At four hundred miles the temperature had reached 153 degrees.  Feverishly I watched the thermometer.  Slowly it rose.  Perry had ceased singing and was at last praying.  Our hopes had received such a deathblow that the gradually increasing heat seemed to our distorted imaginations much greater than it really was.  For another hour I saw that pitiless column of mercury rise and rise until at four hundred and ten miles it stood at 153 degrees.  Now it was that we began to hang upon those readings in almost breathless anxiety.  One hundred and fifty-three degrees had been the maximum temperature above the ice stratum.  Would it stop at this point again, or would it continue its merciless climb?  We knew that there was no hope, and yet with the persistence of life itself we continued to hope against practical certainty.  Already the air tanks were at low ebb--there was barely enough of the precious gases to sustain us for another twelve hours.  But would we be alive to know or care?  It seemed incredible.  At four hundred and twenty miles I took another reading.  \"Perry!\" I shouted.  \"Perry, man!  She's going down! She's going down! She's 152 degrees again.\"  \"Gad!\" he cried.  \"What can it mean?  Can the earth be cold at the center?\"  \"I do not know, Perry,\" I answered; \"but thank God, if I am to die it shall not be by fire--that is all that I have feared.  I can face the thought of any death but that.\"  Down, down went the mercury until it stood as low as it had seven miles from the surface of the earth, and then of a sudden the realization broke upon us that death was very near.  Perry was the first to discover it.  I saw him fussing with the valves that regulate the air supply.  And at the same time I experienced difficulty in breathing. My head felt dizzy--my limbs heavy.  I saw Perry crumple in his seat.  He gave himself a shake and sat erect again.  Then he turned toward me.  \"Good-bye, David,\" he said.  \"I guess this is the end,\" and then he smiled and closed his eyes.  \"Good-bye, Perry, and good luck to you,\" I answered,"]]]
