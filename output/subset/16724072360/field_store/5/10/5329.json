It will be shown further that Rigdon had opportunity to steal the manuscript and that he foreknew the forthcoming and the contents of the Book of Mormon; that through Parley P. Pratt, later one of the first Mormon apostles, a plain and certain connection is traced between Sidney Rigdon and Joseph Smith, and that they were friends between 1827 and 1830. To all this will be added very conclusive evidence of the identity of the distinguished features of Spaulding's \"Manuscript Found\" and the Book of Mormon. These facts, coupled with Smith's admitted intellectual incapacity for producing the book unaided, will close the argument upon this branch of the question, and it is hoped will convince all not in the meshes of Mormonism that the Book of Mormon is a plagiarism. To those Mormons whose minds are untainted by mysticism, who have the intelligence to weigh evidence and the courage to proclaim convictions opposed to accepted church theories--to such Mormons, though not convinced that the evidence here reviewed amounts to a demonstration, it must be that this essay will yet furnish even to them a more believable and more probable theory of the origin of the Book of Mormon than the one which involves a belief in undemonstrable miracles as well as matters entirely outside of all other experience of sane humans. Certainly the theory here advanced requires for its belief the acceptance of less of improbable assumption than does any other explanation offered. With this statement of what it is expected to accomplish we may proceed to review the evidence in detail.  SOLOMON SPAULDING AND HIS FIRST MANUSCRIPT.  Solomon Spaulding was born in 1761 at Ashford, Conn., graduated from Dartmouth in 1785, graduated in theology in 1787, and became an obscure preacher. The fact that Spaulding had become an infidel, [5] that in rewriting the first outline of his story he adopted, as he said, \"the old Scripture style\" to make it seem more ancient, [6] and the further fact that he told at least four persons at different times that his story would some day be accepted as veritable history [7]--all of these, combined with the peculiar product, tend to show that one motive for the writing of this supposed novel may have been the author's desire to burlesque the Bible and furnish a practical demonstration of the gullibility of the masses.  [Footnote 5: See Addendum to Spaulding Manuscript at Oberlin College and Howe's \"Mormonism Unveiled,\" 288.]  [Footnote 6: Howe's \"Mormonism Unveiled,\" 288.]  [Footnote 7: Howe's \"Mormonism Unveiled,\" 283, 4, 6, 7.]  While at Dartmouth College, Spaulding had as a classmate the subsequently famous imposter and criminal, Stephen Burroughs, [8] which fact furnishes interesting material for reflection as to how far the subsequent ill fame of Burroughs, coupled with personal acquaintance, may have operated in Spaulding as a fruitful suggestion inducing this labor as a means of securing fortune through fraud. If Spaulding did not see the possibility of a new and profitable religion in his \"Manuscript Found,\" then he was more short-sighted than was a nephew of his named King. This nephew told one Hale, a schoolteacher, of his belief that he could start a new religion out of this novel and make money thereby, at the same time briefly outlining a plan very similar to the one long afterward adopted by Smith, Rigdon and Company. If we can place any confidence in the report of an interview between a Mormon \"elder\" and a nephew of Solomon Spaulding, then it would appear that in the opinion of the latter's brother Solomon Spaulding was not a man who would be, by conscientious scruples, deterred from practicing such a fraud, if believed profitable. [10] Be that as it may, Spaulding did hope by the sale of his literary production to make sufficient money to enable him to pay his debts. [11]  [Footnote 8: \"Memoirs of Stephen Burroughs,\" p. 26, ed. of 1811, shows Burroughs to have entered Dartmouth in 1781, which must have been Spaulding's date of entry, he having graduated in 1785.]  [Footnote 9: \"New Light on Mormonism,\" 261.]  [Footnote 10: xxxv. _Saints' Herald_, 820.]  [Footnote 11: Howe's \"Mormonism Unveiled,\" 285.]  In 1809 Solomon Spaulding and Henry Lake built and conducted a forge at Salem (now Conneaut), O., where, in 1812, the former made his second business failure. [12]  [Footnote 12: \"Prophet of Palmyra,\" 443; Howe's \"Mormonism Unveiled,\" 279 and 282; \"New Light on Mormonism,\" 13.]  Spaulding, being an invalid, possessed of a good education and habits of study, naturally took to literary work, which he probably commenced soon after 1809, [13] and continued until his death in October, 1816. During this seven years he seems to have written several other manuscripts [14] besides the two with which we are directly concerned.  [Footnote 13: Howe's \"Mormonism Unveiled,\" 279; \"New Light on Mormonism,\" 13-14.]  [Footnote 14: Howe's \"Mormonism Unveiled,\" 285; \"New Light on Mormonism,\" 20.]  Necessarily Spaulding's surroundings gave some direction to the course of his literary efforts. Environed as he was in a country where once dwelt the mound-builders, and having himself caused one of the mounds to be opened, with the resulting discovery of bones and relics of a supposedly prehistoric civilization, [15] like thousands before him, he was led to speculate upon the character of that civilization and the origin of those ancient peoples. Josiah Priest, in his \"Wonders of Nature and Providence\" (1824), quotes over forty authors, half of whom are Americans, and all of whom, prior to 1824, advocated an Israelitish origin of the American Indian. Some of these dated as far back as Clavigaro, a Catholic priest in the seventeenth century.  [Footnote 15: \"New Light on Mormonism,\" 14.]  In Spaulding's first writing of his manuscript story, he pretended to find a roll of parchment in a stone box within a cave. In the Latin language, this contained an account of a party of Roman sea voyagers, who, in the time of Constantine, were, by storms, drifted ashore on the American continent. One of their number left this record of their travels, of Indian wars and customs, which record Spaulding pretends to have found and to translate. [16] How that resembles a synopsis of the Book of Mormon!  [Footnote 16: \"The Manuscript Found.\" For Howe's synopsis see \"Mormonism Unveiled,\" 288. Whitney's \"History of Utah,\" 49-51.]  In 1834, when E. D. Howe had in preparation his book, \"Mormonism Unveiled,\" wherein the Spaulding story was first exploited, this first manuscript was given by Spaulding's family to D. P. Hurlburt, the agent of Howe. The Spaulding family, without having made any examination whatever of the papers delivered to Hurlburt, seem always to have believed, [17] though without any evidence, that he received and sold to the Mormons the rewritten story entitled \"Manuscript Found,\" which will be more fully discussed hereafter. From Howe this first manuscript story went into the possession of one L. L. Rice, who bought out Howe's business, and later, with other effects of Rice's, it was shipped to Honolulu, and there, in 1884, accidentally discovered by President James H. Fairchild of Oberlin College. [18] This manuscript is now in the Oberlin library, and has been published by two of the Mormon sects as being a refutation of the Spaulding origin of the Book of Mormon. It can be such refutation only to those who mistake it for another story. Howe, in 1834, published a fair synopsis of the manuscript now at Oberlin [19] and submitted the original to the witnesses who testified to the many points of identity between Spaulding's \"Manuscript Found\" and the Book of Mormon. These witnesses then (in 1834) recognized the manuscript, secured by Hurlburt and now at Oberlin, as being one of Spaulding's, but not the one which they asserted was similar to the Book of Mormon. They further said that Spaulding had told them that he had altered his original plan of writing by going farther back with his dates and writing in the old Scripture style, in order that his story might appear more ancient. [20]  [Footnote 17: \"New Light on Mormonism,\" by Mrs. Ellen F. Dickinson.]  [Footnote 18: Publisher's Preface to \"The Manuscript Found,\" p. iv. _Deseret News_, 1886; Whitney's \"History of Utah,\" p. 49; Talmage's \"Articles of Faith,\" 278-9.]  [Footnote 19: Howe's \"Mormonism Unveiled,\" 288; Whitney's \"History of Utah,\" 49.]  [Footnote 20: Howe's \"Mormonism Unveiled,\" 288.]  According to many witnesses, the re-written \"Manuscript Found\" (like the Book of Mormon) was an attempt at imitating the literary style of the Bible. So was the manuscript submitted to Patterson, according to his own statement. [21] No such indications are found in the Oberlin manuscript, which further evidences that it is not the manuscript of which the witnesses testified, and which Patterson says was submitted to him. The Oberlin manuscript also furnishes internal evidences of an improbability that it was ever submitted to a publisher by any man as sane and well educated as was Spaulding. The plot of the story is incomplete, and the manuscript is full of interlineations, alterations, careless or phonetic spelling, and misused capital letters. These are all easily explainable consistently with Spaulding's erudition, if we view the manuscript as a hasty and careless blocking out of his literary work, but it is not in such a condition as would make him willing to submit it to a publisher.

Nevertheless, there is but one plan of salvation, and one door into the sheepfold, \"He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.\"[I]  [Footnote I: John 10:1.]  We have not made the way narrow nor the gate strait, that few there be that find it! Nor was ours the edict, \"Not every one that saith Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he that doeth the will of the father.\"[J]  [Footnote J: Matt. 7th chapter.]  The fact that certain laws must be observed, and ordinances complied with, is not the ruling of the Latter-day Saints, but the divine mandate of the Author of our salvation, who has said he will judge all men according to their works and opportunities. We are merely complying with the teachings of the Master which we have received, and which are requisite to salvation.  If belief alone were sufficient, then even the devils, who fear and tremble, would be saved. They recognized the Savior and declared on several occasions that he was the Son of God.[K] And the devils in the days of the sons of Sceva declared that they knew Jesus and Paul, yet they were far from the road to salvation.[L]  [Footnote K: Mark 5:2-9; Luke 4:33-34.]  [Footnote L: Acts 19:15.]  Notwithstanding the apparently narrow construction of the Latter-day Saints pertaining to the scriptures--and we most emphatically declare that all men must obey these laws if they would be saved, excepting those who die without law, and therefore are not judged by law[M]--we are broader and more liberal in our teachings than the believers in the faith-only theory of salvation, who would save all who profess a belief in the name of the Redeemer, but reject all others, consigning them to everlasting destruction without one ray of hope, simply because they did not confess that Jesus was the Christ. This view condemns all who lived at a time or place that the knowledge of the Redeemer of the world could not reach them. They would reject this vast majority of the human family, men women and children, to eternal damnation, without the fault being their own!  [Footnote M: Moroni 8:22.]  With the Latter-day Saints this is not so. While it is true we teach that a man must comply with these principles of the gospel in order to receive salvation and exaltation in the kingdom of heaven--which is proved by many passages of scripture--nevertheless, we hold out the hope that all may be saved, excepting the sons of perdition--a class that willfully rejects the atonement of the Savior: for the Lord intends to save all the workmanship of his hands, save these few who will not receive salvation. Our doctrine consigns none others to perdition, but holds forth the hope that all will eventually be saved in the kingdom of God at some time and in some degree of glory.  Little children are redeemed from the foundation of the world through the atonement, \"Wherefore, they cannot sin,\" the Lord has said, \"for power is not given unto Satan to tempt little children, until they begin to become accountable before me; for it is given unto them even as I will, according to mine own pleasure, that great things may be required at the hand of their fathers. And again, I say unto you, that whoso having knowledge, have I not commanded to repent?\"[N]  [Footnote N: Doc. & Cov. 29:46-49.]  He that declares that little children are born in sin, and therefore require baptism, denies the mercy of the father and does not understand the nature and significance of the atonement. The Savior said: \"Suffer little children and forbid them not to come unto me, for of such is the kingdom of heaven.\" The Prophet Mormon sums the whole matter up in the following words:    Little children cannot repent; wherefore it is awful wickedness   to deny the pure mercies of God unto them, for they are   all alive in him because of his mercy.    And he that saith, that little children need baptism, denieth   the mercies of Christ, and setteth at naught the atonement of   him and the power of his redemption.    Wo unto such, for they are in danger of death, hell, and   endless torment. I speak it boldly, God hath commanded me.   Listen unto them and give heed, or they stand against you at the   judgment seat of Christ.    For behold that all little children are alive in Christ, and   also all they that are without the law. For the power of redemption   cometh on all they that have no law; wherefore, he   that is not condemned, or he that is under no condemnation,   cannot repent; and unto such baptism availeth nothing.    But it is mockery before God, denying the mercies of Christ,   and the power of His Holy Spirit, and putting trust in dead   works.    Behold, my son, this thing ought not to be; for repentance   is unto them that are under condemnation and under the curse   of a broken law.    And the first fruits of repentance is baptism, and baptism   cometh by faith, unto the fulfilling of the commandments; and   the fulfilling of commandments bringeth remission of sins.[O]  [Footnote O: Moroni 8:19-25.]  The question naturally arises, if all must accept the principles of the gospel and be baptized for the remission of their sins, what of the dead who died without receiving the remission of their sins, or accepting Christ while they were in the flesh? They cannot be baptized in water now and have hands laid on their heads for the gift of the Holy Ghost, for these things of necessity pertain to this mortal probation. Therefore, it would be impossible for them to be baptized now or even after the resurrection, for they would no longer be mortal, but subject to the laws and regulations of that life which is to come. These ordinances must be performed in this life, or, if for the dead, vicariously by some one who is in mortality, the living acting as proxy for the dead. Again we hear the objection raised, that this is impossible; that one man cannot stand, or answer for another's sins; but that every man must stand for himself. This is true so far as it is possible to be done. But occasions have arisen where the man guilty of transgressing the law was unable to redeem himself. And punishment for sin, is for the propitiation of sin, and in such cases there is nothing in the scriptures forbidding one to stand vicariously for another when circumstances render it impossible for the first to comply with the law. In ancient Israel they had the scapegoat. On the head of this goat, Aaron placed both his hands and confessed over him all the iniquity of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions in all their sins, putting them upon the head of the goat, and then sent him away \"by the hand of a fit man into the wilderness.\" And the goat bore upon him all their iniquities into the wilderness \"unto a land not inhabited:\"[P] This was but one instance. In various ways of vicarious offerings have been made and accepted. Then why should it be considered a strange thing for the Latter-day Saints to believe that the children have the privilege to stand vicariously for their dead fathers, and by proxy perform these ordinances, that belong to this life, in their behalf?  [Footnote P: Leviticus 16:20-22. See also Leviticus chapters 4 and 5.]  The fact is, the whole plan of redemption is based on vicarious salvation, One without sin standing for the whole human family, all of whom were under the curse. It is most natural and just that he who commits the wrong should pay the penalty--atone for his wrong doing. Therefore, when Adam was the transgressor of the law, justice demanded that he, and none else, should answer for the sin and pay the penalty with his life. But Adam, in breaking and law, himself became subject to the curse, and being under the curse could not atone, or undo what he had done. Neither could his children, for they also were under the curse, and it required one who was not subject to the curse to atone for that original sin. Moreover, since we were all under the curse, we were also powerless to atone for our individual sins. It therefore became necessary for the Father to send his Only Begotten Son, who was free from sin, to atone for our sins as well as for Adam's transgression, which justice demanded should be done. He accordingly offered himself a sacrifice for sins, and through his death upon the cross took upon himself both Adam's transgression and our individual sins, thereby redeeming us from the fall, and from our sins, on condition of repentance.  Let us illustrate: A man walking along the road happens to fall into a pit so deep and dark that he cannot climb to the surface and regain his freedom. How can he save himself from his predicament? Not by any exertions on his own part, for there is no means of escape in the pit. He calls for help and some kindly disposed soul, hearing his cries for relief, hastens to his assistance and by lowering a ladder, gives to him the means by which he may climb again to the surface of the earth. This was precisely the condition that Adam placed himself and his posterity in, when he partook of the forbidden fruit. All being together in the pit, none could gain the surface and relieve the others. The pit was banishment from the presence of the Lord and temporal death, the dissolution of the body. And all being subject to death, none could provide the means of escape. Therefore, in his infinite mercy, the Father heard the cries of his children and sent his Only Begotten Son, who was not subject to death nor to sin, to provide the means of escape. This he did through his infinite atonement and the everlasting gospel. The Savior voluntarily laid down his life and took it up again to satisfy the demands of justice, which required this infinite atonement. His Father accepted this offering in the stead of the blood of all those who were under the curse, and consequently"]]]
