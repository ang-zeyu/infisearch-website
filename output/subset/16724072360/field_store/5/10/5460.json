For an hour I battled against the cruelly enveloping death that surrounded me upon all sides.  At first I found that by climbing high into the framework above me I could find more of the precious life-giving elements, and for a while these sustained me.  It must have been an hour after Perry had succumbed that I at last came to the realization that I could no longer carry on this unequal struggle against the inevitable.  With my last flickering ray of consciousness I turned mechanically toward the distance meter.  It stood at exactly five hundred miles from the earth's surface--and then of a sudden the huge thing that bore us came to a stop.  The rattle of hurtling rock through the hollow jacket ceased.  The wild racing of the giant drill betokened that it was running loose in AIR--and then another truth flashed upon me.  The point of the prospector was ABOVE us.  Slowly it dawned on me that since passing through the ice strata it had been above.  We had turned in the ice and sped upward toward the earth's crust.  Thank God! We were safe!  I put my nose to the intake pipe through which samples were to have been taken during the passage of the prospector through the earth, and my fondest hopes were realized--a flood of fresh air was pouring into the iron cabin.  The reaction left me in a state of collapse, and I lost consciousness.     II  A STRANGE WORLD   I was unconscious little more than an instant, for as I lunged forward from the crossbeam to which I had been clinging, and fell with a crash to the floor of the cabin, the shock brought me to myself.  My first concern was with Perry.  I was horrified at the thought that upon the very threshold of salvation he might be dead.  Tearing open his shirt I placed my ear to his breast.  I could have cried with relief--his heart was beating quite regularly.  At the water tank I wetted my handkerchief, slapping it smartly across his forehead and face several times.  In a moment I was rewarded by the raising of his lids.  For a time he lay wide-eyed and quite uncomprehending.  Then his scattered wits slowly foregathered, and he sat up sniffing the air with an expression of wonderment upon his face.  \"Why, David,\" he cried at last, \"it's air, as sure as I live.  Why--why what does it mean?  Where in the world are we?  What has happened?\"  \"It means that we're back at the surface all right, Perry,\" I cried; \"but where, I don't know.  I haven't opened her up yet.  Been too busy reviving you.  Lord, man, but you had a close squeak!\"  \"You say we're back at the surface, David?  How can that be?  How long have I been unconscious?\"  \"Not long.  We turned in the ice stratum.  Don't you recall the sudden whirling of our seats?  After that the drill was above you instead of below.  We didn't notice it at the time; but I recall it now.\"  \"You mean to say that we turned back in the ice stratum, David?  That is not possible.  The prospector cannot turn unless its nose is deflected from the outside--by some external force or resistance--the steering wheel within would have moved in response.  The steering wheel has not budged, David, since we started.  You know that.\"  I did know it; but here we were with our drill racing in pure air, and copious volumes of it pouring into the cabin.  \"We couldn't have turned in the ice stratum, Perry, I know as well as you,\" I replied; \"but the fact remains that we did, for here we are this minute at the surface of the earth again, and I am going out to see just where.\"  \"Better wait till morning, David--it must be midnight now.\"  I glanced at the chronometer.  \"Half after twelve.  We have been out seventy-two hours, so it must be midnight.  Nevertheless I am going to have a look at the blessed sky that I had given up all hope of ever seeing again,\" and so saying I lifted the bars from the inner door, and swung it open.  There was quite a quantity of loose material in the jacket, and this I had to remove with a shovel to get at the opposite door in the outer shell.  In a short time I had removed enough of the earth and rock to the floor of the cabin to expose the door beyond.  Perry was directly behind me as I threw it open.  The upper half was above the surface of the ground.  With an expression of surprise I turned and looked at Perry--it was broad day-light without!  \"Something seems to have gone wrong either with our calculations or the chronometer,\" I said.  Perry shook his head--there was a strange expression in his eyes.  \"Let's have a look beyond that door, David,\" he cried.  Together we stepped out to stand in silent contemplation of a landscape at once weird and beautiful.  Before us a low and level shore stretched down to a silent sea.  As far as the eye could reach the surface of the water was dotted with countless tiny isles--some of towering, barren, granitic rock--others resplendent in gorgeous trappings of tropical vegetation, myriad starred with the magnificent splendor of vivid blooms.  Behind us rose a dark and forbidding wood of giant arborescent ferns intermingled with the commoner types of a primeval tropical forest. Huge creepers depended in great loops from tree to tree, dense under-brush overgrew a tangled mass of fallen trunks and branches. Upon the outer verge we could see the same splendid coloring of countless blossoms that glorified the islands, but within the dense shadows all seemed dark and gloomy as the grave.  And upon all the noonday sun poured its torrid rays out of a cloudless sky.  \"Where on earth can we be?\" I asked, turning to Perry.  For some moments the old man did not reply.  He stood with bowed head, buried in deep thought.  But at last he spoke.  \"David,\" he said, \"I am not so sure that we are ON earth.\"  \"What do you mean Perry?\" I cried.  \"Do you think that we are dead, and this is heaven?\" He smiled, and turning, pointing to the nose of the prospector protruding from the ground at our backs.  \"But for that, David, I might believe that we were indeed come to the country beyond the Styx.  The prospector renders that theory untenable--it, certainly, could never have gone to heaven.  However I am willing to concede that we actually may be in another world from that which we have always known.  If we are not ON earth, there is every reason to believe that we may be IN it.\"  \"We may have quartered through the earth's crust and come out upon some tropical island of the West Indies,\" I suggested.  Again Perry shook his head.  \"Let us wait and see, David,\" he replied, \"and in the meantime suppose we do a bit of exploring up and down the coast--we may find a native who can enlighten us.\"  As we walked along the beach Perry gazed long and earnestly across the water.  Evidently he was wrestling with a mighty problem.  \"David,\" he said abruptly, \"do you perceive anything unusual about the horizon?\"  As I looked I began to appreciate the reason for the strangeness of the landscape that had haunted me from the first with an illusive suggestion of the bizarre and unnatural--THERE WAS NO HORIZON!  As far as the eye could reach out the sea continued and upon its bosom floated tiny islands, those in the distance reduced to mere specks; but ever beyond them was the sea, until the impression became quite real that one was LOOKING UP at the most distant point that the eyes could fathom--the distance was lost in the distance.  That was all--there was no clear-cut horizontal line marking the dip of the globe below the line of vision.  \"A great light is commencing to break on me,\" continued Perry, taking out his watch.  \"I believe that I have partially solved the riddle.  It is now two o'clock. When we emerged from the prospector the sun was directly above us.  Where is it now?\"  I glanced up to find the great orb still motionless in the center of the heaven.  And such a sun!  I had scarcely noticed it before.  Fully thrice the size of the sun I had known throughout my life, and apparently so near that the sight of it carried the conviction that one might almost reach up and touch it.  \"My God, Perry, where are we?\" I exclaimed.  \"This thing is beginning to get on my nerves.\"  \"I think that I may state quite positively, David,\" he commenced, \"that we are--\" but he got no further.  From behind us in the vicinity of the prospector there came the most thunderous, awe-inspiring roar that ever had fallen upon my ears.  With one accord we turned to discover the author of that fearsome noise.  Had I still retained the suspicion that we were on earth the sight that met my eyes would quite entirely have banished it.  Emerging from the forest was a colossal beast which closely resembled a bear.  It was fully as large as the largest elephant and with great forepaws armed with huge claws.  Its nose, or snout, depended nearly a foot below its lower jaw, much after the manner of a rudimentary trunk.  The giant body was covered by a coat of thick, shaggy hair.  Roaring horribly it came toward us at a ponderous, shuffling trot.  I turned to Perry to suggest that it might be wise to seek other surroundings--the idea had evidently occurred to Perry previously, for he was already a hundred paces away, and with each second his prodigious bounds increased the distance.  I had never guessed what latent speed possibilities the old gentleman possessed.  I saw that he was headed toward a little point of the forest which ran out toward the sea not far from where we had been standing, and as the mighty creature, the sight of which had galvanized him into such remarkable action, was forging steadily toward me.  I set off after Perry, though at a somewhat more decorous pace.  It was evident that the massive beast pursuing us was not built for speed, so all that I considered necessary was to gain the trees sufficiently ahead of it to enable me to climb to the safety of some great branch before it came up.  Notwithstanding our danger I could not help but"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5450"],["title","An Egyptian Princess — Volume 01 (#1)"],["body","Herodotus.  How richly she was endowed with gifts and graces may be gathered too from the manner in which tradition and fairy lore have endeavored to render her name immortal.  By many she is said to have built the most beautiful of the Pyramids, the Pyramid of Mycerinus or Menkera.  One tale related of her and reported by Strabo and AElian probably gave rise to our oldest and most beautiful fairy tale, Cinderella; another is near akin to the Loreley legend.  An eagle, according to AElian--the wind, in Strabo's tale,--bore away Rhodopis' slippers while she was bathing in the Nile, and laid them at the feet of the king, when seated on his throne of justice in the open market.  The little slippers so enchanted him that he did not rest until he had discovered their owner and made her his queen.  The second legend tells us how a wonderfully beautiful naked woman could be seen sitting on the summit of one of the pyramids (ut in una ex pyramidibus); and how she drove the wanderers in the desert mad through her exceeding loveliness.  Moore borrowed this legend and introduces it in the following verse:                \"Fair Rhodope, as story tells--                The bright unearthly nymph, who dwells                'Mid sunless gold and jewels hid,                The lady of the Pyramid.\"  Fabulous as these stories sound, they still prove that Rhodopis must have been no ordinary woman.  Some scholars would place her on a level with the beautiful and heroic Queen Nitokris, spoken of by Julius Africanus, Eusebius and others, and whose name, (signifying the victorious Neith) has been found on the monuments, applied to a queen of the sixth dynasty. This is a bold conjecture; it adds however to the importance of our heroine; and without doubt many traditions referring to the one have been transferred to the other, and vice versa.  Herodotus lived so short a time after Rhodopis, and tells so many exact particulars of her private life that it is impossible she should have been a mere creation of fiction.  The letter of Darius, given at the end of Vol. II., is intended to identify the Greek Rhodopis with the mythical builder of the Pyramid. I would also mention here that she is called Doricha by Sappho.  This may have been her name before she received the title of the \"rosy-cheeked one.\"  I must apologize for the torrent of verse that appears in the love-scenes between Sappho and Bartja; it is also incumbent upon me to say a few words about the love-scenes themselves, which I have altered very slightly in the new edition, though they have been more severely criticised than any other portion of the work.  First I will confess that the lines describing the happy love of a handsome young couple to whom I had myself become warmly attached, flowed from my pen involuntarily, even against my will (I intended to write a novel in prose) in the quiet night, by the eternal Nile, among the palms and roses.  The first love-scene has a story of its own to me.  I wrote it in half an hour, almost unconsciously.  It may be read in my book that the Persians always reflected in the morning, when sober, upon the resolutions formed the night before, while drunk.  When I examined in the sunshine what had come into existence by lamplight, I grew doubtful of its merits, and was on the point of destroying the love-scenes altogether, when my dear friend Julius Hammer, the author of \"Schau in Dich, und Schau um Dich,\" too early summoned to the other world by death, stayed my hand.  Their form was also approved by others, and I tell myself that the 'poetical' expression of love is very similar in all lands and ages, while lovers' conversations and modes of intercourse vary according to time and place.  Besides, I have to deal with one of those by no means rare cases, where poetry can approach nearer the truth than prudent, watchful prose.  Many of my honored critics have censured these scenes; others, among whom are some whose opinion I specially value, have lavished the kindest praise upon them.  Among these gentlemen I will mention A. Stahr, C. V. Holtei, M. Hartmann, E. Hoefer, W. Wolfsohn, C. Leemans, Professor Veth of Amsterdam, etc.  Yet I will not conceal the fact that some, whose opinion has great weight, have asked: \"Did the ancients know anything of love, in our sense of the word?  Is not romantic love, as we know it, a result of Christianity?\"  The following sentence, which stands at the head of the preface to my first edition, will prove that I had not ignored this question when I began my task.       \"It has often been remarked that in Cicero's letters and those of      Pliny the younger there are unmistakeable indications of sympathy      with the more sentimental feeling of modern days.  I find in them      tones of deep tenderness only, such as have arisen and will arise      from sad and aching hearts in every land and every age.\"                                A. v. HUMBOLDT.  Cosmos II. P. 19.  This opinion of our great scholar is one with which I cheerfully coincide and would refer my readers to the fact that love-stories were written before the Christian era: the Amor and Psyche of Apuleius for instance. Indeed love in all its forms was familiar to the ancients.  Where can we find a more beautiful expression of ardent passion than glows in Sappho's songs?  or of patient faithful constancy than in Homer's Penelope?  Could there be a more beautiful picture of the union of two loving hearts, even beyond the grave, than Xenophon has preserved for us in his account of Panthea and Abradatas? or the story of Sabinus the Gaul and his wife, told in the history of Vespasian?  Is there anywhere a sweeter legend than that of the Halcyons, the ice-birds, who love one another so tenderly that when the male becomes enfeebled by age, his mate carries him on her outspread wings whithersoever he will; and the gods, desiring to reward such faithful love, cause the sun to shine more kindly, and still the winds and waves on the \"Halcyon days\" during which these birds are building their nest and brooding over their young?  There can surely have been no lack of romantic love in days when a used-up man of the world, like Antony, could desire in his will that wherever he died his body might be laid by the side of his beloved Cleopatra: nor of the chivalry of love when Berenice's beautiful hair was placed as a constellation in the heavens.  Neither can we believe that devotion in the cause of love could be wanting when a whole nation was ready to wage a fierce and obstinate war for the sake of one beautiful woman.  The Greeks had an insult to revenge, but the Trojans fought for the possession of Helen.  Even the old men of Ilium were ready \"to suffer long for such a woman.\"  And finally is not the whole question answered in Theocritus' unparalleled poem, \"the Sorceress?\"  We see the poor love- lorn girl and her old woman-servant, Thestylis, cowering over the fire above which the bird supposed to possess the power of bringing back the faithless Delphis is sitting in his wheel.  Simoetha has learnt many spells and charms from an Assyrian, and she tries them all.  The distant roar of the waves, the stroke rising from the fire, the dogs howling in the street, the tortured fluttering bird, the old woman, the broken- hearted girl and her awful spells, all join in forming a night scene the effect of which is heightened by the calm cold moonshine.  The old woman leaves the girl, who at once ceases to weave her spells, allows her pent- up tears to have their way, and looking up to Selene the moon, the lovers' silent confidante, pours out her whole story: how when she first saw the beautiful Delphis her heart had glowed with love, she had seen nothing more of the train of youths who followed him, \"and,\" (thus sadly the poet makes her speak)                                \"how I gained my home                I knew not; some strange fever wasted me.                Ten days and nights I lay upon my bed.                O tell me, mistress Moon, whence came my love!\"  \"Then\" (she continues) when Delphis at last crossed her threshold:                                                    \"I                Became all cold like snow, and from my brow                Brake the damp dewdrops: utterance I had none,                Not e'en such utterance as a babe may make                That babbles to its mother in its dreams;                But all my fair frame stiffened into wax,--                O tell me mistress Moon, whence came my love!\"  Whence came her love?  thence, whence it comes to us now.  The love of the creature to its Creator, of man to God, is the grand and yet gracious gift of Christianity.  Christ's command to love our neighbor called into existence not only the conception of philanthropy, but of humanity itself, an idea unknown to the heathen world, where love had been at widest limited to their native town and country.  The love of man and wife has without doubt been purified and transfigured by Christianity; still it is possible that a Greek may have loved as tenderly and longingly as a Christian.  The more ardent glow of passion at least cannot be denied to the ancients.  And did not their love find vent in the same expressions as our own?  Who does not know the charming roundelay:                     \"Drink the glad wine with me,                     With me spend youth's gay hours;                     Or a sighing lover be,                     Or crown thy brow with flowers.                     When I am merry and mad,                     Merry and mad be you;                     When I am sober and sad,                     Be sad and sober too!\"  --written however by no poet of modern days, but by Praxilla, in the fifth century before Christ.  Who would guess either that Moore's little song was modelled on one written even earlier than the date of our story?                     \"As o'er her loom the Lesbian maid                     In love-sick"]]]
