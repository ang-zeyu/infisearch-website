Leydig, Gerstaecker, and others believe this same organ to be olfactory.  Perhaps, after all, there is room for only one more doctor of science who will permanently settle this and a few other vexing questions for us.  But what of the millions of Nature Lovers, who each year snatch only a brief time afield, for rest and recreation?  What of the masses of men and women whose daily  application to the work of life makes vacation study a burden, or whose business has so broken the habit of study that concentration is distasteful if not impossible? These people number in the ratio of a million to one Naturalist. They would be delighted to learn the simplest name possible for the creatures they or their friends find afield, and the markings, habits, and characteristics by which they can be identified. They do not care in the least for species and minute detail concerning anatomy, couched in resounding Latin and Greek terms they cannot possibly remember.  I never have seen or heard of any person who on being shown any one of ten of our most beautiful moths, did not consider and promptly pronounce it the most exquisite creation he ever had seen, and evince a lively interest in its history.  But when he found it necessary to purchase a text-book, devoid of all human interest or literary possibility, and wade through pages of scientific dissertation, all the time having the feeling that perhaps through his lack of experience his identification was not aright, he usually preferred to remain in ignorance.  It is in the belief that all Nature Lovers, afield for entertainment or instruction, will be thankful for a simplification of any method now existing for becoming acquainted with moths, that this book is written and illustrated.  In gathering the material used I think it is quite true that I have lost as many good subjects as I have secured, in my efforts to follow the teachings of scientific writers.  My complaint against them is that they neglect essential detail and are not always rightly informed.  They confuse one with a flood of scientific terms describing minute anatomical parts and fail to explain the simple yet absolutely essential points over which an amateur has trouble, wheat often only a few words would suffice.  For example, any one of half a dozen writers tells us that when a caterpillar finishes eating and is ready to go into winter quarters it crawls rapidly around for a time, empties the intestines, and transformation takes place.  Why do not some of them explain further that a caterpillar of, say, six inches in length will shrink to THREE, its skin become loosened, the horns drop limp, and the creature appear dead and disintegrating? Because no one mentioned these things, I concluded that the first caterpillar I found in this state was lost to me and threw it away. A few words would have saved the complete history of a beautiful moth, to secure which no second opportunity was presented for five years.  Several works I consulted united in the simple statement that certain caterpillars pupate in the ground.  In Packard's \"Guide\", you will find this--\"Lepidopterous pupae should be...kept moist in mould until the image appears.\"  I followed this direction, even taking the precaution to bake the earth used, because I was very anxious about some rare moths. When they failed to emerge in season I dug them out, only to find that those not moulded had been held fast by  the damp, packed earth, and all were ruined.  I learned by investigation that pupation takes place in a hole worked out by the caterpillar, so earth must touch these cases only as they lie upon it.  The one word 'hole' would have saved all those moths for me.  One writer stated that the tongue cases of some pupae turn over and fasten on the back between the wing shields, and others were strangely silent on the subject.  So for ten months I kept some cases lying on their backs with the feet up and photographed them in that position.  I had to discover for myself that caterpillars that pupate in the ground change to the moth form with the feet and legs folded around the under side of the thorax, the wings wrap over them, and the tongue case bends UNDER and is fastened between the wings.  For years I could find nothing on the subject of how a moth from a burrowing caterpillar made its appearance.  In two recent works I find the statement that the pupa cases come to the surface before the moths leave them, but how the operation is performed is not described or explained.  Pupa cases from earth consist of two principal parts: the blunt head and thorax covering, and the ringed abdominal sections.  With many feeders there is a long, fragile tongue shield.  The head is rounded and immovable of its own volition.  The abdominal part is in rings that can be turned and twisted; on the tip are two tiny, needlesharp points, and on each of three rings of the abdominal shield there are in many cases a pair of tiny hooks, very slight projections, yet enough to be of use.  Some lepidopterists think the pupa works head first to the surface, pushing with the abdomen.  To me this seems impossible. The more one forced the blunt head against the earth the closer it would pack, and the delicate tongue shield surely would break. There is no projection on the head that would loosen or lift the earth.  One prominent lepidopterist I know, believes the moth emerges underground, and works its way to the surface as it fights to escape a cocoon.  I consider this an utter impossibility. Remember the earth-encrusted cicada cases you have seen clinging to the trunks of trees, after the insect has reached the surface and abandoned them.  Think what would happen to the delicate moth head, wings, and downy covering!  I am willing to wager all I possess, that no lepidopterist, or any amateur, ever found a freshly emerged moth from an underground case with the faintest trace of soil on its head or feet, or a particle of down missing; as there unquestionably must be, if it forced its way to freedom through the damp spring earth with its mouth and feet.  The point was settled for me when, while working in my garden, one came through the surface within a few inches of my fingers, working with the tip of the abdomen.  It turned, twisted, dug away the dirt, fastened the abdominal tip, pulled up the head, and then bored with the tip again.  Later I saw several others emerge in the same way, and then made some experiments that forever convinced me that this is the only manner in which ground pupae possibly  could emerge.  One writer I had reason to suppose standard authority stated that caterpillars from Citheronia Regalis eggs emerged in sixteen days. So I boxed some eggs deposited on the eleventh, labelled them due to produce caterpillars on the twenty-seventh and put away the box to be attended on that date.  Having occasion to move it on the twentyfourth, I peeped in and found half my caterpillars out and starved, proving that they had been hatched at least thirty-six hours or longer; half the others so feeble they soon became inactive, and the remainder survived and pupated.  But if the time specified had been allowed to elapse, every  caterpillar would have starved.  One of the books I read preparatory to doing this work asserts concerning spinners: \"Most caterpillars make some sort of cocoon or shelter, which may be of pure silk neatly wound, or of silk mixed with hair and all manner of external things--such as pieces of leaf, bark, moss, and lichen, and even grains of earth.\"  I have had caterpillars spin by the hundred, in boxes containing most of these things, have gathered outdoor cocoons by the peck, and microscopically examined dozens of them, and with the exception of leaf, twig, bark, or some other foundation against which it was spun, I never have seen a cocoon with shred, filament, or particle of anything used in its composition that was not drawn from the spinning tube or internal organism of the caterpillar, with the possible exception of a few hairs from the tubercles.  I have been told by other workers that they have had captive caterpillars use earth and excrement in their cocoons.  This same work, in an article on protective colouration, lays emphasis on the statement that among pupa cases artificially fastened to different objects out of doors, \"the elimination was ninety-two per cent on fences where pupae were conspicuous, as against fifty-two per cent among nettles, where they were inconspicuous.\" This statement is elaborated and commented upon as making a strong point for colourative protection through inconspicuousness.  Personally, I think the nettles did the work, regardless of colour. I have learned to much experience afield that a patch of nettles or thistles afford splendid protection to any form of life that can survive them.  I have seen insects and nesting birds find a safety in their shelter, unknown to their kind that home elsewhere.  The test is not fair enough to be worth consideration.  If these same pupae had been as conspicuously  placed as on the fence, on any EDIBLE GROWTH, in the same location as the fence, and then left to the mercy of playing children, grazing stock, field mice, snakes, bats, birds, insects and parasites, the story of what happened to them would have been different.  I doubt very seriously if it would have proved the point those lepidopterists started out to make in these conditions, which are the only fair ones under which such an experiment could be made.  Many people mentioned in connexion with the specimens they brought me have been more than kind in helping to collect the material this volume contains; but its publication scarcely would have been possible to me had it not been for the enthusiasm of one girl who prefers not to be mentioned and the work of a seventeen-year-old boy,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4907"],["title","Moths of the Limberlost: A Book About Limberlost Cabin (#2)"],["body","Miller.  He has been my sole helper in many difficult days of field work among the birds, and for the moths his interest reached such a pitch that he spent many hours afield in search of eggs, caterpillars, cocoons, and moths, when my work confined me to the cabin.  He has carried to me many of my rarest cocoons, and found in their native haunts several moths needed to complete the book.  It is to be hoped that these wonderful days afield have brought their own compensation, for kindness such as his I never can reward adequately.  The book proves my indebtedness to the Deacon and to Molly-Cotton.  I also owe thanks to Bob Burdette Black, the oldest and warmest friend of my bird work, for many fine moths and cocoons, and to Professor R. R. Rowley for the laborious task of scientifically criticizing this book and with unparalleled kindness lending a helping hand where an amateur stumbled.    CHAPTER II  MOTHS, EGGS, CATERPILLARS, WINTER QUARTERS   If you are too fastidious to read this chapter, it will be your permanent loss, for it contains the life history, the evolution of one of the most amazingly complicated and delicately beautiful creatures in existence.  There are moths that come into the world, accomplish the functions that perpetuate their kind, and go out, without having taken any nourishment.  There are others that feed and live for a season.  Some fly in the morning, others in the glare of noon, more in the evening, and the most important class of big, exquisitely lovely  ones only at night.  This explains why so many people never have seen them, and it is a great pity, for the nocturnal, non-feeding moths are birdlike in size, flower-like in rare and complicated colouring, and of downy, silent wing.  The moths that fly by day and feed are of the Sphinginae group, Celeus and Carolina, or Choerocampinae, which includes the exquisite Deilephila Lineata, and its cousins; also Sphingidae, which cover the clear-winged Hemaris diffinis and Thysbe.  Among those that fly at night only and take no food are the members of what is called the Attacine group, comprising our largest and commonest moth, Cecropia; also its near relative Gloveri, smaller than Cecropia and of lovely rosy wine-colour; Angulifera, the male greyish brown, the female yellowish red; Promethea, the male resembling a monster Mourning Cloak butterfly and the female bearing exquisite red-wine flushings; Cynthia, beautiful in shades of olive green, sprinkled with black, crossed by bands of pinkish lilac and bearing crescents partly yellow, the remainder transparent. There are also the deep yellow Io, pale blue-green Luna, and Polyphemus, brown with pink bands of the Saturniidae; and light yellow, red-brown and grey Regalis, and lavender and yellow Imperialis of the Ceratocampidae, and their relatives.  Modest and lovely Modesta belongs with the Smerinthinae group; and there are others, feeders and non-feeders, forming a list too long to incorporate, for I have not mentioned the Catocalae family, the fore-wings of which resemble those of several members of the Sphinginae, in colour, and when they take flight, the back ones flash out colours that run the gamut from palest to deepest reds, yellows, and browns, crossed by wide circling bands of black; with these, occasionally the black so predominates that it appears as if the wing were black and the bands of other colour.  All of them are so exquisitely beautiful that neither the most exacting descriptions, nor photographs from life, nor water colours faithfully copied from living subjects can do them justice.  They must be seen alive, newly emerged, down intact, colours at their most brilliant shadings, to be appreciated fully.  With the exception of feeding or refraining from eating, the life processes of all these are very similar.  Moths are divided into three parts, the head, thorax, and abdomen, with the different organs of each.  The head carries the source of sight, scent, and the mouth parts, if the moth feeds, while the location of the ears is not yet settled definitely.  Some scientists place hearing in the antennae, others in a little organ on each side the base of the abdomen.  Packard writes: \"The eyes are large and globose and vary in the distance apart in different families\":  but fails to tell what I want to know most: the range and sharpness of their vision.  Another writer states that the eyes are so incomplete in development that a moth only can distinguish light from darkness and cannot discern your approach at over five feet.  This accords with my experience with Cecropia, Polyphemus, Regalis, and Imperialis.  Luna either can see better, hear acutely, or is naturally of more active habit.  It is difficult to capture by hand in daytime; and Promethea acts as if its vision were even clearer.  This may be the case, as it flies earlier in the day than any of the others named, being almost impossible to take by hand unless it is bound to a given spot by sex attraction. Unquestionably the day fliers that feed--the Sphinginae and Choerocampinae groups--have fairly good vision, as also the little \"Clear-wings\" tribe, for they fly straight to the nectar-giving flowers and fruits they like best to feed upon, and it is extra good luck if you capture one by hand or even with a net.  It must be remembered that all of them see and go to a bright light at night from long distances.  Holland writes: \"The eyes of moths are often greatly developed,\" but makes no definite statements as to their range of vision, until he reaches the Catocalae family, of which he records:  \"The hind wings are, however, most brilliantly coloured.  In some species they are banded with pink, in others with crimson; still others have markings of yellow, orange, or snowy white on a background of jet black.  These colours are distinctive of the species to a greater or less extent.  They are only displayed at night.  The conclusion is irresistibly forced upon us that the eyes of these creatures are capable of discriminating these colours in the darkness.  We cannot do it.  No human eye in the blackness of the night can distinguish red from orange or crimson from yellow.  The human eye is the greatest of all anatomical marvels, and the most wonderful piece of animal mechanism in the world, but not all of power is lodged within it. There are other allied mechanisms which have the power of responding to certain forms of radiant energy to a degree which it does not possess.\"  This conclusion is not \"irresistibly forced\" upon me.  I do believe, know in fact, that all day-flying, feeding moths have keener sight and longer range of vision than non-feeders; but I do not believe the differing branches of the Catocalae group, or moths of any family, locate each other \"in the blackness of night,\" by  seeing markings distinctly.  I can think of no proof that moths, butterflies or any insects recognize or appreciate colour.  Male moths mate with females of their kind distinctly different from them in colour, and male butterflies pair with albinos of their species, when these differ widely from the usual colouring.  A few moths are also provided with small simple eyes called ocelli; these are placed on top of the head and are so covered with down they cannot be distinguished save by experts.  Mueller believes that these are for the perception of objects close to a moth while the compound eyes see farther, but he does not prove it.  If the moth does not feed, the mouth parts are scarcely developed. If a feeder, it has a long tongue that can be coiled in a cleft in the face between the palpi, which Packard thinks were originally the feelers.  This tongue is formed of two grooved parts so fastened together as to make a tube through which it takes flower and fruit nectar and the juices of decaying animal matter.  What are thought by some to be small organs of touch lie on either side the face, but the exact use of these is yet under discussion, It is wofully difficult to learn some of these things.  In my experience the antennae, are the most sensitive, and therefore the most important organs of the head--to me.  In the Attacine group these stand out like delicately cut tiny fern fronds or feathers, always being broader and more prominent on the male.  Other families are very similar and again they differ widely.  You will find moths having pointed hair-like antennae; others heaviest at the tip in club shape, or they may be of even proportion but flat, or round, or a feathered shaft so fine as to be unnoticed as it lies pressed against the face.  Some writers say the antennae are the seat of scent, touch, and hearing.  I had not thought nature so impoverished in evolving her forms as to overwork one delicate little organ for three distinct purposes.  The antennae are situated close where the nose is, in almost every form of life, and I would prefer to believe that they are the organs of scent and feeling.  I know a moth suffers most over any injury to them; but one takes flight no quicker or more precipitately at a touch on the antennae than on the head, wing, leg, or abdomen.  We are safe in laying down a law that antennae are homologous organs and used for identical purposes on all forms of life carrying them. The short antennae of grasshoppers appear to be organs of scent. The long hair-fine ones of katydids and crickets may be also, but repeatedly I have seen these used to explore the way ahead over leaves and limbs, the insect feeling its path and stepping where a touch assures it there is safe footing.  Katydids, crickets, and grasshoppers all have antennae, and all of these have ears definitely located; hence their feelers are not for auricular purposes. According to my logic those of the moth cannot be either.  I am quite sure that primarily they serve the purpose of a nose, as they are too short in most cases to be of much use as 'feelers,' although that is undoubtedly their secondary  office.  If this be true, it explains"]]]
