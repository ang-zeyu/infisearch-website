And Santa Claus at once sent him with rubber boots for Charlie Smith, and a doll for Mamie Brown; so that even those two disappointed ones became happy.  As for the wicked Daemons of the Caves, they were filled with anger and chagrin when they found that their clever capture of Santa Claus had come to naught.  Indeed, no one on that Christmas Day appeared to be at all selfish, or envious, or hateful.  And, realizing that while the children's saint had so many powerful friends it was folly to oppose him, the Daemons never again attempted to interfere with his journeys on Christmas Eve."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5192"],["title","On a Dynamical Top, for exhibiting the phenomena of the motion of a system of (#1)"],["body","math}   Let $1/A = a^2$, $1/B = b^2$, $1/c = c^2$, $V/H^2 = e^2$, and this equation becomes   \\begin{displaymath} a^2l^2 + b^2m^2 + c^2n^2 = e^2 \\end{displaymath} (3)  and the equation to the cone, described by the invariable axis within the body, is   \\begin{displaymath} (a^2 - e^2) x^2 + (b^2 - e^2) y^2 + (c^2 - e^2) z^2 = 0 \\end{displaymath} (4)   The intersections of this cone with planes perpendicular to the principal axes are found by putting $x$, $y$, or $z$, constant in this equation. By giving $e$ various values, all the different paths of the pole of the invariable axis, corresponding to different initial circumstances, may be traced.   Figure: Figure 1   * In the figures, I have supposed $a^2 = 100$, $b^2= 107$, and $c^2= 110$. The first figure represents a section of the various cones by a plane perpendicular to the axis of $x$, which is that of greatest moment of inertia. These sections are ellipses having their major axis parallel to the axis of $b$. The value of $e^2$ corresponding to each of these curves is indicated by figures beside the curve. The ellipticity increases with the size of the ellipse, so that the section corresponding to $e^2 = 107$ would be two parallel straight lines (beyond the bounds of the figure), after which the sections would be hyperbolas.   Figure: Figure 2   * The second figure represents the sections made by a plane, perpendicular to the _mean_ axis. They are all hyperbolas, except when $e^2 = 107$, when the section is two intersecting straight lines.   Figure: Figure 3   The third figure shows the sections perpendicular to the axis of least moment of inertia. From $e^2 = 110$ to $e^2 = 107$ the sections are ellipses, $e^2 = 107$ gives two parallel straight lines, and beyond these the curves are hyperbolas.   Figure: Figure 4   * The fourth and fifth figures show the sections of the series of cones made by a cube and a sphere respectively. The use of these figures is to exhibit the connexion between the different curves described about the three principal axes by the invariable axis during the motion of the body.   Figure: Figure 5   * We have next to compare the velocity of the invariable axis with respect to the body, with that of the body itself round one of the principal axes. Since the invariable axis is fixed in space, its motion relative to the body must be equal and opposite to that of the portion of the body through which it passes. Now the angular velocity of a portion of the body whose direction-cosines are $l$, $m$, $n$, about the axis of $x$ is   \\begin{displaymath} \\frac{\\omega_1}{1 - l^2} - \\frac{l}{1 - l^2}(l\\omega_1 + m\\omega_2 + n\\omega-3). \\end{displaymath}   Substituting the values of $\\omega_1$, $\\omega_2$, $\\omega_3$, in terms of $l$, $m$, $n$, and taking account of equation (3), this expression becomes   \\begin{displaymath} H\\frac{(a^2 - e^2)}{1 - l^2}l. \\end{displaymath}   Changing the sign and putting $\\displaystyle l = \\frac{\\omega_1}{a^2H}$ we have the angular velocity of the invariable axis about that of $x$   \\begin{displaymath} = \\frac{\\omega_1}{1 - l^2} \\frac{e^2 - a^2}{a^2}, \\end{displaymath}   always positive about the axis of greatest moment, negative about that of least moment, and positive or negative about the mean axis according to the value of $e^2$. The direction of the motion in every case is represented by the arrows in the figures. The arrows on the outside of each figure indicate the direction of rotation of the body.  * If we attend to the curve described by the pole of the invariable axis on the sphere in fig. 5, we shall see that the areas described by that point, if projected on the plane of $yz$, are swept out at the rate   \\begin{displaymath} \\omega_1 \\frac{e^2 - a^2}{a^2}. \\end{displaymath}   Now the semi-axes of the projection of the spherical ellipse described by the pole are   \\begin{displaymath} \\sqrt{\\frac{e^2 - a^2}{b^2 - a^2}} \\hspace{1cm}\\textrm{and}\\hspace{1cm} \\sqrt{\\frac{e^2 - a^2}{c^2 - a^2}}. \\end{displaymath}   Dividing the area of this ellipse by the area described during one revolution of the body, we find the number of revolutions of the body during the description of the ellipse--   \\begin{displaymath} = \\frac{a^2}{\\sqrt{b^2 - a^2}\\sqrt{c^2 - a^2}}. \\end{displaymath}   The projections of the spherical ellipses upon the plane of $yz$ are all similar ellipses, and described in the same number of revolutions; and in each ellipse so projected, the area described in any time is proportional to the number of revolutions of the body about the axis of $x$, so that if we measure time by revolutions of the body, the motion of the projection of the pole of the invariable axis is identical with that of a body acted on by an attractive central force varying directly as the distance. In the case of the hyperbolas in the plane of the greatest and least axis, this force must be supposed repulsive. The dots in the figures 1, 2, 3, are intended to indicate roughly the progress made by the invariable axis during each revolution of the body about the axis of $x$, $y$ and $z$ respectively. It must be remembered that the rotation about these axes varies with their inclination to the invariable axis, so that the angular velocity diminishes as the inclination increases, and therefore the areas in the ellipses above mentioned are not described with uniform velocity in absolute time, but are less rapidly swept out at the extremities of the major axis than at those of the minor.  * When two of the axes have equal moments of inertia, or $b = c$, then the angular velocity $\\omega_1$ is constant, and the path of the invariable axis is circular, the number of revolutions of the body during one circuit of the invariable axis, being   \\begin{displaymath} \\frac{a^2}{b^2 - a^2} \\end{displaymath}   The motion is in the same direction as that of the rotation, or in the opposite direction, according as the axis of $x$ is that of greatest or of least moment of inertia.  * Both in this case, and in that in which the three axes are unequal, the motion of the invariable axis in the body may be rendered very slow by diminishing the difference of the moments of inertia. The angular velocity of the axis of $x$ about the invariable axis in space is   \\begin{displaymath} \\omega_1\\frac{e^2 - a^2l^2}{a^2(1 - l^2)}, \\end{displaymath}   which is greater or less than $\\omega_1$, as $e^2$ is greater or less than $a^2$, and, when these quantities are nearly equal, is very nearly the same as $\\omega_1$ itself. This quantity indicates the rate of revolution of the axle of the top about its mean position, and is very easily observed.  * The _instantaneous axis_ is not so easily observed. It revolves round the invariable axis in the same time with the axis of $x$, at a distance which is very small in the case when $a$, $b$, $c$, are nearly equal. From its rapid angular motion in space, and its near coincidence with the invariable axis, there is no advantage in studying its motion in the top.  * By making the moments of inertia very unequal, and in definite proportion to each other, and by drawing a few strong lines as diameters of the disc, the combination of motions will produce an appearance of epicycloids, which are the result of the continued intersection of the successive positions of these lines, and the cusps of the epicycloids lie in the curve in which the instantaneous axis travels. Some of the figures produced in this way are very pleasing.  In order to illustrate the theory of rotation experimentally, we must have a body balanced on its centre of gravity, and capable of having its principal axes and moments of inertia altered in form and position within certain limits. We must be able to make the axle of the instrument the greatest, least, or mean principal axis, or to make it not a principal axis at all, and we must be able to _see_ the position of the invariable axis of rotation at any time. There must be three adjustments to regulate the position of the centre of gravity, three for the magnitudes of the moments of inertia, and three for the directions of the principal axes, nine independent adjustments, which may be distributed as we please among the screws of the instrument.   Figure: Figure 6   The form of the body of the instrument which I have found most suitable is that of a bell (fig. 6). $C$ is a hollow cone of brass, $R$ is a heavy ring cast in the same piece. Six screws, with heavy heads, $x$, $y$, $z$, $x'$, $y'$, $z'$, work horizontally in the ring, and three similar screws, $l$, $m$, $n$, work vertically through the ring at equal intervals. $AS$ is the axle of the instrument, $SS$ is a brass screw working in the upper part of the cone $C$, and capable of being firmly clamped by means of the nut $c$. $B$ is a cylindrical brass bob, which may be screwed up or down the axis, and fixed in its place by the nut $b$.  The lower extremity of the axle is a fine steel point, finished without emery, and afterwards hardened. It runs in a little agate cup set in the top of the pillar $P$. If any emery had been embedded in the steel, the cup would soon be worn out. The upper end of the axle has also a steel point by which it may be kept steady while spinning.  When the instrument is in use, a coloured disc is attached to the upper end of the axle.  It will be seen that there are eleven adjustments, nine screws in the brass ring, the axle screwing in the cone, and the bob screwing on the axle. The advantage of the last two adjustments is, that by them large alterations can be made, which are not possible by means of the small screws.  The first thing to be done with the instrument is, to make the steel point at the end of the axle coincide with the centre of gravity of the whole. This is done roughly by screwing the axle to the right place nearly, and then balancing the instrument on its point, and screwing the bob and the horizontal screws till the instrument will remain balanced in any position in which it is placed.  When this adjustment is "]]]
