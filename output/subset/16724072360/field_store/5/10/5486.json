I see it in your face.\"  In fact, every feature of the dusky maid-servant's ugly face betrayed that pleasant thoughts were agitating her mind.  Her black eyes flashed with fearless daring, and a smile beautified her big mouth and thick lips as she replied:  \"A loving heart like yours understands the art of prophecy better than the chief priest of the great Serapis.  Yes, my young mistress, he of whom you speak must disappear from this wicked city where so much evil threatens you both.  He will certainly escape and, if the immortals aid us and we are wise and brave, you also.  Whence the help comes can be told later.  Now, the first thing is to transform you--don't be reluctant--into the ugliest woman in the world--black Anukis.  You must escape from the palace in this disguise.--Now you know the whole plan, and while I get what is necessary from my chest of clothes, I beg you, mistress, to consider how we are to obtain the black stains for that ivory skin and golden hair.\"  With these words she left the room, but Barine flung herself into her friend's arms, exclaiming, amid tears and laughter: \"Though I should be forced to remain forever as black and crooked as faithful Aisopion, if he did not withdraw his love, though I were obliged to go through fire and water--I would  O Charmian! what changes so quickly as joy and sorrow? I would fain show some kindness to every one in the world, even to your Queen, who has brought all these troubles upon me.\"  The new-born hope had transformed the despairing woman into a happy one, and Charmian perceived it with grateful joy, secretly wishing that Cleopatra had listened to her appeal.  While examining the hair-dyes used by the Queen she saw, lurking in the background of what was still unexplained, and therefore confused her mind, fresh and serious perils.  Barine, on the contrary, gazed across them to the anticipated meeting with her lover, and was full of the gayest expectation until the maid-servant's return.  The work of disfigurement began without delay.  Anukis moved her lips as busily as her hands, and described in regular order all that had befallen her during the eventful day.  Barine listened with rising excitement, and her joy increased as she beheld the path which had been smoothed for her by the care and wisdom of her friends.  Charmian, on the contrary, became graver and more quiet the more distinctly she perceived the danger her favourite must encounter. Yet she could not help admitting that it would be a sin against Barine's safety, perhaps her very life, to withhold her from this well-considered plan of escape.  That it must be tried was certain; but as the moment which was to endanger the woman she loved drew nearer, and she could not help saying to herself that she was aiding an enterprise in opposition to the express command of the Queen and helping to execute a plan which threatened to rouse the indignation, perhaps the fury, of Cleopatra, a feeling of sorrow overpowered her.  She feared nothing for herself.  Not for a single instant did she think of the unpleasant consequences which Barine's escape might draw upon her.  The burden on her soul was due only to the consciousness of having, for the first time, opposed the will of the sovereign, to fulfil whose desires and to promote whose aims had been the beloved duty of her life.  Doubtless the thought crossed her mind that, by aiding Barine's escape, she was guarding Cleopatra from future repentance; probably she felt sure that it was her duty to help rescue this beautiful young life, whose bloom had been so cruelly assailed by tempest and hoar-frost, and which now had a prospect of the purest happiness; yet, though in itself commendable, the deed brought her into sharp conflict with the loftiest aims and aspirations of her life.  And how much nearer than the other was the woman--she shrank from the word-- whom she was about to betray, how much greater was Cleopatra's claim to her love and gratitude!  Could she have any other emotion than thankfulness if the plan of escape succeeded?  Yet she was reluctant to perform the task of making Barine's beautiful, symmetrical figure resemble the hunch-backed Nubian's, or to dip her fingers into the pomade intended for Cleopatra; and it grieved her to mar the beauty of Barine's luxuriant tresses by cutting off part of her thick fair braids.  True, these things could not be avoided, if the flight was to succeed, and the further Anukis advanced in her story, the fewer became her mistress's objections to the plan.  The conversation between Iras and Alexas, which had been overheard by the maid, already made it appear necessary to withdraw Barine and her lover from the power of such foes.  The faithful man whom Anukis had found with Dion, whose name she did not mention and of whose home she said only that no safer hiding-place could be found, even by the mole which burrowed in the earth, really seemed to have been sent with Gorgias to Dion's couch by Fate itself.  The control of the subterranean chambers in the Temple of Isis which had been bestowed on the architect, also appeared like a miracle.  Upon a small tablet, which the wise Aisopion had intentionally delayed handing to her mistress until now, were the lines:  \"Archibius greets his sister Charmian.  If I know your heart, it will be as hard for you as for me to share this plot, yet it must be done for the sake of her father, to save the life and happiness of his child.  So it must fall to your lot to bring Barine to the Temple of Isis at the Corner of the Muses.  She will find her lover there and, if possible, be wedded to him.  As the sanctuary is so near, you need leave the palace only a short time.  Do not tell Barine what we have planned.  The disappointment would be too great if it should prove impracticable.\"  This letter and the arrangement it proposed transformed the serious scruples which shadowed Charmian's good-will into a joyous, nay, enthusiastic desire to render assistance.  Barine's marriage to the man who possessed her heart was close at hand, and she was the daughter of Leonax, who had once been dear to her.  Fear and doubt vanished as if scattered to the four winds, and when Aisopion's work of transformation was completed and Barine stood before her as the high-shouldered, dark- visaged, wrinkled maid, she could not help admitting that it would be easy to escape from the palace in that disguise.  She now told Barine that she intended to accompany her herself; and though the former's stained face forced her to refrain from kissing her friend, she plainly expressed to her and the faithful freedwoman the overflowing gratitude which filled her heart.  Anukis was left alone.  After carefully removing all the traces of her occupation, as habit dictated, she raised her arms in prayer, beseeching the gods of her native land to protect the beautiful woman to whom she had loaned her own misshapen form, which had now been of genuine service, and who had gone forth to meet so many dangers, but also a happiness whose very hope had been denied to her.  Charmian had told her maid that if the Queen should inquire for her before Iras returned from the Choma to say that she had been obliged to leave the palace, and to supply her place.  During their absence, when Charmian had been attacked by sickness, Cleopatra had often entrusted the care of her toilet to Aisopion, and had praised her skill.  The Queen's confidential attendant was followed as usual when she went out by a dark-skinned maid.  Lanterns and lamps had already been lighted in the corridors of the spacious palace, and the court-yards were ablaze with torches and pitch-pans; but, brilliantly as they burned in many places, and numerous as were the guards, officers, eunuchs, clerks, soldiers, cooks, attendants, slaves, door-keepers, and messengers whom they passed, not one gave them more than a careless glance.  So they reached the last court-yard, and then came a moment when the hearts of both women seemed to stop beating--for the man whom they had most cause to dread, Alexas the Syrian, approached.  And he did not pass the fugitives, but stopped Charmian, and courteously, even obsequiously, informed her that he wished to get rid of the troublesome affair of her favourite, which had been assigned to him against his will, and therefore had determined to bring Barine to trial early the following morning.  The Syrian's body-servant attended his master, and while the former was talking with Charmian the latter turned to the supposed Nubian, tapped her lightly on the shoulder, and whispered: \"Come this evening, as you did yesterday.  You haven't finished the story of Prince Setnau.\"  The fugitive felt as if she had grown dumb and could never more regain the power of speech.  Yet she managed to nod, and directly after the favourite bowed a farewell to Charmian.  The Ligurian was obliged to follow his master, while Charmian and Barine passed through the gateway between the last pylons into the open air.  Here the sea-breeze seemed to waft her a joyous greeting from the realm of liberty and happiness, and the timid woman, amid all the perils which surrounded her, regained sufficient presence of mind to tell her friend what Alexas's slave had whispered--that Aisopion might remind him of it the same evening, and thus strengthen his belief that the Nubian had accompanied the Queen's confidante.  The way to the Temple of Isis was short.  The stars showed that they would reach their destination in time; but a second delay unexpectedly occurred.  From the steps leading to the cella of the sanctuary a procession, whose length seemed endless, came towards them.  At the head of the train marched eight pastophori, bearing the image of Isis.  Then came the basket-bearers of the goddess with several other priestesses, followed by the reader with an open book-roll.  Behind him appeared the quaternary number of prophets, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5479"],["title","Cleopatra â€” Volume 07 (#2)"],["body","head, the chief priest, moved with stately dignity beneath a canopy.  The rest of the priestly train bore in their hands manuscripts, sacred vessels, standards, and wreaths.  The priestesses--some of whom, with garlands on their flowing hair, were already shaking the sistrum of Isis--mingled with the line of priests, their high voices blending with the deep notes of the men.  Neokori, or temple servants, and a large number of worshippers of Isis, closed the procession, all wearing wreaths and carrying flowers.  Torch and lantern bearers lighted the way, and the perfume of the incense rising from the little pan of charcoal in the hand of a bronze arm, which the pastophori waved to and fro, surrounded and floated after the procession.  The two women waiting for the train to pass saw it turn towards Lochias, and the conversation of the bystanders informed them that its object was to convey to \"the new Isis,\" the Queen, the greeting of the goddess, and assure the sovereign of the divinity's remembrance of her in the hour of peril.  Cleopatra could not help accepting this friendly homage, and it was incumbent upon her to receive it wearing on her head the crown of Upper and Lower Egypt, and robed in all the ecclesiastical vestments which only her two most trusted attendants knew how to put on with the attention to details that custom required.  This had never been entrusted to maids of inferior position like the Nubian; so Cleopatra would miss Charmian.  The thought filled her with fresh uneasiness and, when the steps were at last free, she asked herself anxiously how all this would end.  It seemed as if the fugitive and her companion had exposed themselves to this great peril in vain; for some of the temple servants were forcing back those who wished to enter the sanctuary, shouting that it would be closed until the return of the procession.  Barine gazed timidly into Charmian's face; but, ere she could express her opinion, the tall figure of a man appeared on the temple steps.  It was Archibius, who with grave composure bade them follow him, and silently led them around the sanctuary to a side door, through which, a short time before, a litter had passed, accompanied by several attendants.  Ascending a flight of steps within the long building, they reached the dimly lighted cella.  As in the Temple of Osiris at Abydos seven corridors, here three led to the same number of apartments, the holy place of the sanctuary.  The central one was dedicated to Isis, that on the left to her husband Osiris, and that on the right to Horus, the son of the great goddess. Before it, scarcely visible in the dim light, stood the altars, loaded with sacrifices by Archibius.  Beside that of Horus was the litter which had been borne into the temple before the arrival of the women.  From it, supported by two friends, descended a slender young man.  A hollow sound echoed through the pillared hall.  The iron door at the main entrance of the temple had been closed.  The shrill rattle that followed proceeded from the metal bolts which an old servant of the sanctuary had shot into the sockets.  Barine started, but neither inquired the cause of the noise nor perceived the wealth of objects here presented to the senses; for the man who, leaning on another's arm, approached the altar, was Dion, the lover who had perilled his life for her sake.  Her eyes rested intently on his figure, her whole heart yearned towards him and, unable to control herself,--she called his name aloud.  Charmian gazed anxiously around the group, but soon uttered a sigh of relief; for the tall man whose arm supported Dion was Gorgias, the worthy architect, his best friend, and the other, still taller and stronger, her own brother Archibius.  Yonder figure, emerging from the disguise of wraps, was Berenike, Barine's mother.  All trustworthy confidants!  The only person whom she did not know was the handsome young man standing at her brother's side.  Barine, whose arm she still held, had struggled to escape to rush to her mother and lover; but Archibius had approached, and in a whisper warned her to be patient and to refrain from any greeting or question, \"supposing,\" he added, \"that you are willing to be married at this altar to Dion, the son of Eumenes.\"  Charmian felt Barine's arm tremble in hers at this suggestion, but the young beauty obeyed her friend's directions.  She did not know what had be fallen her, or whether, in the excess of happiness which overwhelmed her, to shout aloud in her exultant joy, or melt into silent tears of gratitude and emotion.  No one spoke.  Archibius took a roll of manuscript from Dion's hand, presented himself before the assembled company as the bride's kyrios, or guardian, and asked Barine whether she so recognized him.  Then he returned to Dion the marriage contract, whose contents he knew and approved, and informed those present that, in the marriage about to be solemnized, they must consider him the paranymphos, or best man, and Berenike as the bridesmaid, and they instantly lighted a torch at the fires burning on one of the altars.  Archibius, as kyrios, joined the lovers' hands in the Egyptian--Barine's mother, as bridesmaid, in the Greek-manner, and Dion gave his bride a plain iron ring.  It was the same one which his father had bestowed at his own wedding, and he whispered: \"My mother valued it; now it is your turn to honour the ancient treasure.\"  After stating that the necessary sacrifices had been offered to Isis and Serapis, Zeus, Hera, and Artemis, and that the marriage between Dion, son of Eumenes, and Barine, daughter of Leonax, was concluded, Archibius shook hands with both.  Haste seemed necessary, for he permitted Berenike and his sister only time for a brief embrace, and Gorgias to clasp her hand and Dion's.  Then he beckoned, and the newly made bride's mother followed him in tears, Charmian bewildered and almost stupefied.  She did not fully realize the meaning of the event she had just witnessed until an old neokori had guided her and the others into the open air.  Barine felt as if every moment might rouse her from a blissful dream, and yet she gladly told herself that she was awake, for the man walking before her, leaning on the arm of a friend, was Dion.  True, she saw, even in the faint light of the dim temple corridor, that he was suffering.  Walking appeared to be so difficult that she rejoiced when, yielding to Gorgias's entreaties, he entered the litter.  But where were the bearers?  She was soon to learn; for, even while she looked for them, the architect and the youth, in whom she had long since recognized Philotas, her grandfather's assistant, seized the poles.  \"Follow us,\" said Gorgias, under his breath, and she obeyed, keeping close behind the litter, which was borne first down a broad and then a narrow staircase, and finally along a passage.  Here a door stopped the fugitives; but the architect opened it and helped his friend out of the litter, which before proceeding farther he placed in a room filled with various articles discovered during his investigation of the subterranean temple chambers.  Hitherto not a word had been spoken.  Now Gorgias called to Barine: \"This passage is low--you must stoop.  Cover your head, and don't be afraid if you meet bats.  They have long been undisturbed.  We might have taken you from the temple to the sea, and waited there, but it would probably have attracted attention and been dangerous.  Courage, young wife of Dion! The corridor is long, and walking through it is difficult; but compared with the road to the mines, it is as smooth and easy as the Street of the King.  If you think of your destination, the bats will seem like the swallows which announce the approach of spring.\"  Barine nodded gratefully to him; but she kissed the hand of Dion, who was moving forward painfully, leaning on the arm of his friend.  The light of the torch carried by Gorgias's faithful foreman, who led the way, had fallen on her blackened arm, and when the little party advanced she kept behind the others.  She thought it might be unpleasant for her lover to see her thus disfigured, and spared him, though she would gladly have remained nearer.  As soon as the passage grew lower, the wounded man's friends took him in their arms, and their task was a hard one, for they were not only obliged to move onward bending low under the heavy burden, but also to beat off the bats which, frightened by the foreman's torch, flew up in hosts.  Barine's hair was covered, it is true, but at any other time the hideous creatures, which often brushed against her head and arms, would have filled her with horror and loathing.  Now she scarcely heeded them; her eyes were fixed on the recumbent figure in the bearers' arms, the man to whom she belonged, body and soul, and whose patient suffering pierced her inmost heart.  His head rested on the breast of Gorgias, who walked directly in front of her; the architect's stooping posture concealed his face, but his feet were visible and, whenever they twitched, she fancied he was in pain.  Then she longed to press forward to his side, wipe the perspiration from his brow in the hot, low corridor, and whisper words of love and encouragement.  This she was sometimes permitted to do when the friends put down their heavy burden.  True, they allowed themselves only brief intervals of rest, but they were long enough to show her how the sufferer's strength was failing.  When they at last reached their destination, Philotas was forced to exert all his strength to support the exhausted man, while Gorgias cautiously opened the door.  It led to a flight of sea-washed steps close to the garden of Didymus, which as a child she had often used with her brother to float a little boat upon the water.  The architect opened the door only a short distance; he was expected, for Barine soon heard him whisper, and suddenly the door was flung wide. A tall man raised Dion and bore him into "]]]
