You'll not catch me going up there again.\"  Fatima did not prove such a nuisance as we had feared.  Huldah Jane liked her, and Ismay, in spite of her declaration that she would have nothing to do with her, looked after her comfort scrupulously.  She even used to get up in the middle of the night and go out to see if Fatima was warm.  Max came in every day and, being around, gave us good advice.  Then one day, about three weeks after Aunt Cynthia's departure, Fatima disappeared--just simply disappeared as if she had been dissolved into thin air.  We left her one afternoon, curled up asleep in her basket by the fire, under Huldah Jane's eye, while we went out to make a call.  When we came home Fatima was gone.  Huldah Jane wept and was as one whom the gods had made mad.  She vowed that she had never let Fatima out of her sight the whole time, save once for three minutes when she ran up to the garret for some summer savory.  When she came back the kitchen door had blown open and Fatima had vanished.  Ismay and I were frantic.  We ran about the garden and through the out-houses, and the woods behind the house, like wild creatures, calling Fatima, but in vain.  Then Ismay sat down on the front doorsteps and cried.  \"She has got out and she'll catch her death of cold and Aunt Cynthia will never forgive us.\"  \"I'm going for Max,\" I declared.  So I did, through the spruce woods and over the field as fast as my feet could carry me, thanking my stars that there was a Max to go to in such a predicament.  Max came over and we had another search, but without result. Days passed, but we did not find Fatima.  I would certainly have gone crazy had it not been for Max.  He was worth his weight in gold during the awful week that followed.  We did not dare advertise, lest Aunt Cynthia should see it; but we inquired far and wide for a white Persian cat with a blue spot on its tail, and offered a reward for it; but nobody had seen it, although people kept coming to the house, night and day, with every kind of a cat in baskets, wanting to know if it was the one we had lost.  \"We shall never see Fatima again,\" I said hopelessly to Max and Ismay one afternoon.  I had just turned away an old woman with a big, yellow tommy which she insisted must be ours--\"cause it kem to our place, mem, a-yowling fearful, mem, and it don't belong to nobody not down Grafton way, mem.\"  \"I'm afraid you won't,\" said Max.  \"She must have perished from exposure long ere this.\"  \"Aunt Cynthia will never forgive us,\" said Ismay, dismally.  \"I had a presentiment of trouble the moment that cat came to this house.\"  We had never heard of this presentiment before, but Ismay is good at having presentiments--after things happen.  \"What shall we do?\" I demanded, helplessly.  \"Max, can't you find some way out of this scrape for us?\"  \"Advertise in the Charlottetown papers for a white Persian cat,\" suggested Max.  \"Some one may have one for sale.  If so, you must buy it, and palm it off on your good Aunt as Fatima.  She's very short-sighted, so it will be quite possible.\"  \"But Fatima has a blue spot on her tail,\" I said.  \"You must advertise for a cat with a blue spot on its tail,\" said Max.  \"It will cost a pretty penny,\" said Ismay dolefully.  \"Fatima was valued at one hundred dollars.\"  \"We must take the money we have been saving for our new furs,\" I said sorrowfully.  \"There is no other way out of it.  It will cost us a good deal more if we lose Aunt Cynthia's favor.  She is quite capable of believing that we have made away with Fatima deliberately and with malice aforethought.\"  So we advertised.  Max went to town and had the notice inserted in the most important daily.  We asked any one who had a white Persian cat, with a blue spot on the tip of its tail, to dispose of, to communicate with M. I., care of the _Enterprise_.  We really did not have much hope that anything would come of it, so we were surprised and delighted over the letter Max brought home from town four days later.  It was a type-written screed from Halifax stating that the writer had for sale a white Persian cat answering to our description.  The price was a hundred and ten dollars, and, if M. I. cared to go to Halifax and inspect the animal, it would be found at 110 Hollis Street, by inquiring for \"Persian.\"  \"Temper your joy, my friends,\" said Ismay, gloomily.  \"The cat may not suit.  The blue spot may be too big or too small or not in the right place.  I consistently refuse to believe that any good thing can come out of this deplorable affair.\"  Just at this moment there was a knock at the door and I hurried out.  The postmaster's boy was there with a telegram.  I tore it open, glanced at it, and dashed back into the room.  \"What is it now?\" cried Ismay, beholding my face.  I held out the telegram.  It was from Aunt Cynthia.  She had wired us to send Fatima to Halifax by express immediately.  For the first time Max did not seem ready to rush into the breach with a suggestion.  It was I who spoke first.  \"Max,\" I said, imploringly, \"you'll see us through this, won't you?  Neither Ismay nor I can rush off to Halifax at once.  You must go to-morrow morning.  Go right to 110 Hollis Street and ask for 'Persian.'  If the cat looks enough like Fatima, buy it and take it to Aunt Cynthia.  If it doesn't--but it must!  You'll go, won't you?\"  \"That depends,\" said Max.  I stared at him.  This was so unlike Max.  \"You are sending me on a nasty errand,\" he said, coolly.  \"How do I know that Aunt Cynthia will be deceived after all, even if she be short-sighted.  Buying a cat in a joke is a huge risk.  And if she should see through the scheme I shall be in a pretty mess.\"  \"Oh, Max,\" I said, on the verge of tears.  \"Of course,\" said Max, looking meditatively into the fire, \"if I were really one of the family, or had any reasonable prospect of being so, I would not mind so much.  It would be all in the day's work then.  But as it is--\"  Ismay got up and went out of the room.  \"Oh, Max, please,\" I said.  \"Will you marry me, Sue?\" demanded Max sternly.  \"If you will agree, I'll go to Halifax and beard the lion in his den unflinchingly.  If necessary, I will take a black street cat to Aunt Cynthia, and swear that it is Fatima.  I'll get you out of the scrape, if I have to prove that you never had Fatima, that she is safe in your possession at the present time, and that there never was such an animal as Fatima anyhow.  I'll do anything, say anything--but it must be for my future wife.\"  \"Will nothing else content you?\" I said helplessly.  \"Nothing.\"  I thought hard.  Of course Max was acting abominably--but--but--he was really a dear fellow--and this was the twelfth time--and there was Anne Shirley!  I knew in my secret soul that life would be a dreadfully dismal thing if Max were not around somewhere. Besides, I would have married him long ago had not Aunt Cynthia thrown us so pointedly at each other's heads ever since he came to Spencervale.  \"Very well,\" I said crossly.  Max left for Halifax in the morning.  Next day we got a wire saying it was all right.  The evening of the following day he was back in Spencervale.  Ismay and I put him in a chair and glared at him impatiently.  Max began to laugh and laughed until he turned blue.  \"I am glad it is so amusing,\" said Ismay severely.  \"If Sue and I could see the joke it might be more so.\"  \"Dear little girls, have patience with me,\" implored Max.  \"If you knew what it cost me to keep a straight face in Halifax you would forgive me for breaking out now.\"  \"We forgive you--but for pity's sake tell us all about it,\" I cried.  \"Well, as soon as I arrived in Halifax I hurried to 110 Hollis Street, but--see here!  Didn't you tell me your Aunt's address was 10 Pleasant Street?\"  \"So it is.\"  \"'T isn't.  You look at the address on a telegram next time you get one.  She went a week ago to visit another friend who lives at 110 Hollis.\"  \"Max!\"  \"It's a fact.  I rang the bell, and was just going to ask the maid for 'Persian' when your Aunt Cynthia herself came through the hall and pounced on me.\"  \"'Max,' she said, 'have you brought Fatima?'  \"'No,' I answered, trying to adjust my wits to this new development as she towed me into the library.  'No, I--I--just came to Halifax on a little matter of business.'  \"'Dear me,' said Aunt Cynthia, crossly, 'I don't know what those girls mean.  I wired them to send Fatima at once.  And she has not come yet and I am expecting a call every minute from some one who wants to buy her.'  \"'Oh!' I murmured, mining deeper every minute.  \"'Yes,' went on your aunt, 'there is an advertisement in the Charlottetown _Enterprise_ for a Persian cat, and I answered it. Fatima is really quite a charge, you know--and so apt to die and be a dead loss,'--did your aunt mean a pun, girls?--'and so, although I am considerably attached to her, I have decided to part with her.'  \"By this time I had got my second wind, and I promptly decided that a judicious mixture of the truth was the thing required.  \"'Well, of all the curious coincidences,' I exclaimed.  'Why, Miss Ridley, it was I who advertised for a Persian cat--on Sue's behalf.  She and Ismay have decided that they want a cat like Fatima for themselves.'  \"You should have seen how she beamed.  She said she knew you always really liked cats, only you would never own up to it.  We clinched the dicker then and there.  I passed her over your hundred and ten dollars--she took the money without turning a hair--and now you are the joint owners of Fatima.  Good luck to your bargain!\"  \"Mean old thing,\" sniffed Ismay.  She meant Aunt Cynthia, and, remembering our shabby furs, I didn't disagree with her.  \"But there is no Fatima,\" I said, dubiously.  \"How shall we account for her when Aunt Cynthia comes home?\"  \"Well, your aunt isn't coming home for a month yet.

But mark you, they were excellent females--oh, very excellent. Times have changed with a vengeance, judging from the line-up of co-eds to-day. There was one girl there who can’t be a day over eighteen--and she looked as if she were made out of gold and roseleaves and dewdrops.”  “The oracle speaks in poetry,” laughed Eric. “That was Florence Percival, who led the class in mathematics, as I’m a living man. By many she is considered the beauty of her class. I can’t say that such is my opinion. I don’t greatly care for that blonde, babyish style of loveliness--I prefer Agnes Campion. Did you notice her--the tall, dark girl with the ropes of hair and a sort of crimson, velvety bloom on her face, who took honours in philosophy?”  “I DID notice her,” said David emphatically, darting a keen side glance at his friend. “I noticed her most particularly and critically--for someone whispered her name behind me and coupled it with the exceedingly interesting information that Miss Campion was supposed to be the future Mrs. Eric Marshall. Whereupon I stared at her with all my eyes.”  “There is no truth in that report,” said Eric in a tone of annoyance. “Agnes and I are the best of friends and nothing more. I like and admire her more than any woman I know; but if the future Mrs. Eric Marshall exists in the flesh I haven’t met her yet. I haven’t even started out to look for her--and don’t intend to for some years to come. I have something else to think of,” he concluded, in a tone of contempt, for which anyone might have known he would be punished sometime if Cupid were not deaf as well as blind.  “You’ll meet the lady of the future some day,” said David dryly. “And in spite of your scorn I venture to predict that if fate doesn’t bring her before long you’ll very soon start out to look for her. A word of advice, oh, son of your mother. When you go courting take your common sense with you.”  “Do you think I shall be likely to leave it behind?” asked Eric amusedly.  “Well, I mistrust you,” said David, sagely wagging his head. “The Lowland Scotch part of you is all right, but there’s a Celtic streak in you, from that little Highland grandmother of yours, and when a man has that there’s never any knowing where it will break out, or what dance it will lead him, especially when it comes to this love-making business. You are just as likely as not to lose your head over some little fool or shrew for the sake of her outward favour and make yourself miserable for life. When you pick you a wife please remember that I shall reserve the right to pass a candid opinion on her.”  “Pass all the opinions you like, but it is MY opinion, and mine only, which will matter in the long run,” retorted Eric.  “Confound you, yes, you stubborn offshoot of a stubborn breed,” growled David, looking at him affectionately. “I know that, and that is why I’ll never feel at ease about you until I see you married to the right sort of a girl. She’s not hard to find. Nine out of ten girls in this country of ours are fit for kings’ palaces. But the tenth always has to be reckoned with.”  “You are as bad as _Clever Alice_ in the fairy tale who worried over the future of her unborn children,” protested Eric.  “_Clever Alice_ has been very unjustly laughed at,” said David gravely. “We doctors know that. Perhaps she overdid the worrying business a little, but she was perfectly right in principle. If people worried a little more about their unborn children--at least, to the extent of providing a proper heritage, physically, mentally, and morally, for them--and then stopped worrying about them after they ARE born, this world would be a very much pleasanter place to live in, and the human race would make more progress in a generation than it has done in recorded history.”  “Oh, if you are going to mount your dearly beloved hobby of heredity I am not going to argue with you, David, man. But as for the matter of urging me to hasten and marry me a wife, why don’t you”--It was on Eric’s lips to say, “Why don’t you get married to a girl of the right sort yourself and set me a good example?” But he checked himself. He knew that there was an old sorrow in David Baker’s life which was not to be unduly jarred by the jests even of privileged friendship. He changed his question to, “Why don’t you leave this on the knees of the gods where it properly belongs? I thought you were a firm believer in predestination, David.”  “Well, so I am, to a certain extent,” said David cautiously. “I believe, as an excellent old aunt of mine used to say, that what is to be will be and what isn’t to be happens sometimes. And it is precisely such unchancy happenings that make the scheme of things go wrong. I dare say you think me an old fogy, Eric; but I know something more of the world than you do, and I believe, with Tennyson’s _Arthur_, that ‘there’s no more subtle master under heaven than is the maiden passion for a maid.’ I want to see you safely anchored to the love of some good woman as soon as may be, that’s all. I’m rather sorry Miss Campion isn’t your lady of the future. I liked her looks, that I did. She is good and strong and true--and has the eyes of a woman who could love in a way that would be worth while. Moreover, she’s well-born, well-bred, and well-educated--three very indispensable things when it comes to choosing a woman to fill your mother’s place, friend of mine!”  “I agree with you,” said Eric carelessly. “I could not marry any woman who did not fulfill those conditions. But, as I have said, I am not in love with Agnes Campion--and it wouldn’t be of any use if I were. She is as good as engaged to Larry West. You remember West?”  “That thin, leggy fellow you chummed with so much your first two years in Queenslea? Yes, what has become of him?”  “He had to drop out after his second year for financial reasons. He is working his own way through college, you know. For the past two years he has been teaching school in some out-of-the-way place over in Prince Edward Island. He isn’t any too well, poor fellow--never was very strong and has studied remorselessly. I haven’t heard from him since February. He said then that he was afraid he wasn’t going to be able to stick it out till the end of the school year. I hope Larry won’t break down. He is a fine fellow and worthy even of Agnes Campion. Well, here we are. Coming in, David?”  “Not this afternoon--haven’t got time. I must mosey up to the North End to see a man who has got a lovely throat. Nobody can find out what is the matter. He has puzzled all the doctors. He has puzzled me, but I’ll find out what is wrong with him if he’ll only live long enough.”    CHAPTER II. A LETTER OF DESTINY  Eric, finding that his father had not yet returned from the college, went into the library and sat down to read a letter he had picked up from the hall table. It was from Larry West, and after the first few lines Eric’s face lost the absent look it had worn and assumed an expression of interest.  “I am writing to ask a favour of you, Marshall,” wrote West. “The fact is, I’ve fallen into the hands of the Philistines--that is to say, the doctors. I’ve not been feeling very fit all winter but I’ve held on, hoping to finish out the year.  “Last week my landlady--who is a saint in spectacles and calico--looked at me one morning at the breakfast table and said, VERY gently, ‘You must go to town to-morrow, Master, and see a doctor about yourself.’  “I went and did not stand upon the order of my going. Mrs. Williamson is She-Who-Must-Be-Obeyed. She has an inconvenient habit of making you realize that she is exactly right, and that you would be all kinds of a fool if you didn’t take her advice. You feel that what she thinks to-day you will think to-morrow.  “In Charlottetown I consulted a doctor. He punched and pounded me, and poked things at me and listened at the other end of them; and finally he said I must stop work ‘immejutly and to onct’ and hie me straightway to a climate not afflicted with the north-east winds of Prince Edward Island in the spring. I am not to be allowed to do any work until the fall. Such was his dictum and Mrs. Williamson enforces it.  “I shall teach this week out and then the spring vacation of three weeks begins. I want you to come over and take my place as pedagogue in the Lindsay school for the last week in May and the month of June. The school year ends then and there will be plenty of teachers looking for the place, but just now I cannot get a suitable substitute. I have a couple of pupils who are preparing to try the Queen’s Academy entrance examinations, and I don’t like to leave them in the lurch or hand them over to the tender mercies of some third-class teacher who knows little Latin and less Greek. Come over and take the school till the end of the term, you petted son of luxury. It will do you a world of good to learn how rich a man feels when he is earning twenty-five dollars a month by his own unaided efforts!  “Seriously, Marshall, I hope you can come, for I don’t know any other fellow I can ask. The work isn’t hard, though you’ll likely find it monotonous. Of course, this little north-shore farming settlement isn’t a very lively place. The rising and setting of the sun are the most exciting events of the average day. But the people are very kind and hospitable; and Prince Edward Island in the month of June is such a thing as you don’t often see except in happy dreams. There are some trout in the pond and you’ll always find an old salt at the harbour ready and willing to take you out cod-fishing or lobstering.  “I’ll bequeath you my boarding house. You’ll find it comfortable and not further from the school than a good constitutional. Mrs. Williamson is the dearest soul alive; and she is one of those old-fashioned cooks who feed you on feasts of fat things and whose price is above rubies.  “Her husband, Robert, or Bob, as he is commonly called despite his sixty years, is quite "]]]
