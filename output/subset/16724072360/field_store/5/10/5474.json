The little one understands very well what I am to him, and sees what Cleopatra is. If I could find it in my heart to ill-use him in secret, this mother--who is not fit to be a mother--would soon have her way.  Hard as it would be to me so soon to leave the poor feeble little child, who has grown as dear to my soul as my own--aye and closer, even closer, as I may well say--this time I will do it, even at the risk of Cleopatra's plunging us into ruin, my husband and me, as she has done to so many who have dared to contravene her will.\"  The wet-nurse wept aloud, but Zoe laid her hand on the distressed woman's shoulder, and said soothingly: \"I know you have more to submit to from Cleopatra's humors than any of us all, but do not be overhasty.  Tomorrow she will send you a handsome present, as she so often has done after being unkind; and though she vexes and hurts you again and again, she will try to make up for it again and again till, when this year is over, your attendance on the prince will be at an end, and you can go home again to your own family.  We all have to practise patience; we live like people dwelling in a ruinous house with to-day a stone and to-morrow a beam threatening to fall upon our heads.  If we each take calmly whatever befalls us our masters try to heal our wounds, but if we resist may the gods have mercy on us! for Cleopatra is like a strung bow, which sets the arrow flying as soon as a child, a mouse, a breath of air even touches it--like an over-full cup which brims over if a leaf, another drop, a single tear falls into it.  We should, any one of us, soon be worn out by such a life, but she needs excitement, turmoil and amusement at every hour.  She comes home late from a feast, spends barely six hours in disturbed slumber, and has hardly rested so long as it takes a pebble to fall to the ground from a crane's claw before we have to dress her again for another meal.  From the council-board she goes to hear some learned discourse, from her books in the temple to sacrifice and prayer, from the sanctuary to the workshops of artists, from pictures and statues to the audience-chamber, from a reception of her subjects and of foreigners to her writing-room, from answering letters to a procession and worship once more, from the sacred services back again to her dressing-tent, and there, while she is being attired she listens to me while I read the most profound works--and how she listens! not a word escapes her, and her memory retains whole sentences.  Amid all this hurry and scurry her spirit must need be like a limb that is sore from violent exertion, and that is painfully tender to every rough touch.  We are to her neither more nor less than the wretched flies which we hit at when they trouble us, and may the gods be merciful to those on whom this queen's hand may fall!  Euergetes cleaves with the sword all that comes in his way. Cleopatra stabs with the dagger, and her hand wields the united power of her own might and of her yielding husband's.  Do not provoke her.  Submit to what you cannot avert; just as I never complain when, if I make a mistake in reading, she snatches the book from my hand, or flings it at my feet.  But I, of course, have only myself to fear for, and you have your husband and children as well.\"  Praxinoa bowed her head at these words in sad assent, and said:  \"Thank you for those words!  I always think only from my heart, and you mostly from your head.  You are right, this time again there is nothing for me to do but to be patient; but when I have fulfilled the duties here, which I undertook, and am at home again, I will offer a great sacrifice to Asclepias and Hygiea, like a person recovered from a severe illness; and one thing I know: that I would rather be a poor girl, grinding at a mill, than change with this rich and adored queen who, in order to enjoy her life to the utmost, carelessly and restlessly hurries past all that our mortal lot has best to offer.  Terrible, hideous to me seems such an existence with no rest in it! and the heart of a mother which is so much occupied with other things that she cannot win the love of her child, which blossoms for every hired nurse, must be as waste as the desert!  Rather would I endure anything--everything--with patience than be such a queen!\"     CHAPTER VIII.  \"What!  No one to come to meet me?\"  asked the queen, as she reached the foot of the last flight of porphyry steps that led into the ante-chamber to the banqueting-hall, and, looking round, with an ominous glance, at the chamberlains who had accompanied her, she clinched her small fist. \"I arrive and find no one here!\"  The \"No one\" certainly was a figure of speech, since more than a hundred body-guards-Macedonians in rich array of arms-and an equal number of distinguished court-officials were standing on the marble flags of the vast hall, which was surrounded by colonnades, while the star-spangled night-sky was all its roof; and the court-attendants were all men of rank, dignified by the titles of fathers, brothers, relatives, friends and chief-friends of the king.  These all received the queen with a many-voiced \"Hail!\" but not one of them seemed worthy of Cleopatra's notice.  This crowd was less to her than the air we breathe in order to live--a mere obnoxious vapor, a whirl of dust which the traveller would gladly avoid, but which he must nevertheless encounter in order to proceed on his way.  The queen had expected that the few guests, invited by her selection and that of her brother Euergetes to the evening's feast, would have welcomed her here at the steps; she thought they would have seen her--as she felt herself--like a goddess borne aloft in her shell, and that she might have exulted in the admiring astonishment of the Roman and of Lysias, the Corinthian: and now the most critical instant in the part she meant to play that evening had proved a failure, and it suggested itself to her mind that she might be borne back to her roof-tent, and be floated down once more when she was sure of the presence of the company.  But there was one thing she dreaded more even than pain and remorse, and that was any appearance of the ridiculous; so she only commanded the bearers to stand still, and while the master of the ceremonies, waiving his dignity, hurried off to announce to her husband that she was approaching, she signed to the nobles highest in rank to approach, that she might address a few gracious words to them, with distant amiability.  Only a few however, for the doors of thyia wood leading into the banqueting hall itself, presently opened, and the king with his friends came forward to meet Cleopatra.  \"How were we to expect you so early?\"  cried Philometor to his wife.  \"Is it really still early?\"  asked the queen, \"or have I only taken you by surprise, because you had forgotten to expect me?\"  \"How unjust you are!\"  replied the king.  \"Must you now be told that, come as early as you will, you always come too late for my desires.\"  \"But for ours,\" cried Lysias, \"neither too early nor too late, but at the very right time--like returning health and happiness, or the victor's crown.\"  \"Health as taking the place of sickness?\"  asked Cleopatra, and her eyes sparkled keenly and merrily.  \"I perfectly understand Lysias,\" said Publius, intercepting the Greek.  \"Once, on the field of Mars, I was flung from my horse, and had to lie for weeks on my couch, and I know that there is no more delightful sensation than that of feeling our departed strength returning as we recover.  He means to say that in your presence we must feel exceptionally well.\"  \"Nay rather,\" interrupted Lysias, \"our queen seems to come to us like returning health, since so long as she was not in our midst we felt suffering and sick for longing.  Thy presence, Cleopatra, is the most effectual remedy, and restores us to our lost health.\"  Cleopatra politely lowered her fan, as if in thanks, thus rapidly turning the stick of it in her hand, so as to make the diamonds that were set in it sparkle and flash.  Then she turned to the friends, and said:  \"Your words are most amiable, and your different ways of expressing your meaning remind me of two gems set in a jewel, one of which sparkles because it is skilfully cut, and reflects every light from its mirrorlike facets, while the other shines by its genuine and intrinsic fire.  The genuine and the true are one, and the Egyptians have but one word for both, and your kind speech, my Scipio--but I may surely venture to call you Publius--your kind speech, my Publius seems to me to be truer than that of your accomplished friend, which is better adapted to vainer ears than mine.  Pray, give me your hand.\"  The shell in which she was sitting was gently lowered, and, supported by Publius and her husband, the queen alighted and entered the banqueting- hall, accompanied by her guests.  As soon as the curtains were closed, and when Cleopatra had exchanged a few whispered words with her husband, she turned again to the Roman, who had just been joined by Eulaeus, and said:  \"You have come from Athens, Publius, but you do not seem to have followed very closely the courses of logic there, else how could it be that you, who regard health as the highest good--that you, who declared that you never felt so well as in my presence--should have quitted me so promptly after the procession, and in spite of our appointment?  May I be allowed to ask what business--\"  \"Our noble friend,\" answered Eulaeus, bowing low, but not allowing the queen to finish her speech, \"would seem to have found some particular charm in the bearded recluses of Serapis, and to be seeking among them the key-stone of his studies at Athens.\"  \"In that he is very right,\" said the queen.  \"For from them he can learn to direct his attention to that third division of our existence, concerning which least is taught in Athens--I mean"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/54626"],["title","Being a Summary Statement of the Investigation Made (#1)"],["body","the effect that no special legislative measures for prohibiting or restricting the Mormon propaganda have been adopted in Germany. Steps are taken by the police to expel any foreign members of the sect who may render themselves obnoxious in any way, but, as I have already stated in this House, the police in Germany have a great many powers that are not possessed by the police in this country. I am not yet in a position to state the full result of my inquiries with regard to Mormon propaganda in this country and America, but I have not so far discovered any ground for legislative action in the matter.  \"MR. HOUSTON: Is the right hon. Gentleman aware that the hostility to this propaganda is growing rapidly in this country, and that in some instances benches of magistrates are so sympathetic with the rioters that they have dismissed the complaints against them made by the police?  \"MR. CHURCHILL: I think anything in the nature of rowdyism and mob action ought to be sternly suppressed by those responsible for the maintenance of the peace.\"  From the above citations it is obvious that the chief indictment against the \"Mormon\" elder in Great Britain is that he is bribing and secretly inducing English girls and women to emigrate to Utah for immoral purposes. It is interesting to note, however, what the law has to say in this regard, and I therefore refer to The Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1885 (48 and 49 Vict., chapter 69, Sec. 2), which says:  \"Any person who procures or attempts to procure any woman or girl to leave her usual place of abode in the United Kingdom (such place not being a brothel), with intent that she may, for the purposes of prostitution, become an inmate of a brothel within or without the Queen's dominions, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and being convicted thereof shall be liable at the discretion of the court to be imprisoned for any term not exceeding two years, with or without hard labor.\"  Referring to this identical clause The Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1912 (2 and 3 Geo. 5, chapter 20, Sec. 1), says:  \"A constable may take into custody without a warrant, any person whom he shall have good cause to suspect of having committed, or of attempting to commit, any offence against section two of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1885 (which relates to procuration and attempted procuration).\"  Is it not reasonable to suppose, therefore, that if there existed an atom of truth in the indictment, that the laws just quoted and others would have been used in the suppression of the \"Mormon\" propaganda in this country? The fact is, on the other hand, that during the 77 years that the \"Mormon\" elder has proselyted in the British Isles not a single case has been proved nor has one yet arisen.  The fact that no mention of the \"Mormon\" question has been made in the House of Commons since the 8th of May, 1911, until the present time, proves that Mr. Churchill's statement on that date was accepted as final. But since, on the other hand, his conclusion was preceded by the clause, \"I am not yet in a position to state the full result of my inquiries,\" there still remained the possibility of the appearance of further evidence which might modify this conclusion. With this idea in view the following letter was penned:  Durham House,  295 Edge Lane, Liverpool,  May 14th, 1914.  Sir:  On the 8th of May, 1911, the Secretary of State for Home Affairs, Mr. Winston Churchill, made the following statement in the House of Commons: \"I am not yet in a position to state the full result of my inquiries with regard to Mormon propaganda in this country and America, but I have not so far discovered any ground for legislative action in the matter.\"  I am desirous of ascertaining the conclusions drawn, or the result of the inquiries on the \"Mormon\" question, spoken of above, and should therefore deem it a favor to receive an official copy of same.  In the event that this not available, could the records containing such facts be viewed by appointment, and could citations be made to some reliable periodical containing the facts in the case?  Thanking you in anticipation of this favor, and apologizing for this intrusion upon your valuable time,  I am, Sir,  Yours sincerely,  (Signed) ARTHUR L. BEELEY.  RT. HON. REGINALD MCKENNA, K.C.,  Home Office,  Whitehall,  London, S.W.  The following letter was received in reply:  Home Office,  Whitehall,  22nd May, 1914.  Sir,  In reply to your letter of the 14th instant, with reference to the Mormon propaganda in this country and in America, I am directed by the Secretary of State to say that no official report has been published, but that the extensive enquiries which were made did not reveal any grounds for legislative action.  The Secretary of State regrets that it would be contrary to practice to accede to your request to be allowed to see the official records dealing with this matter.  I am, Sir,  Your obedient Servant,  (Signed) A.J. EAGLESTON.  ARTHUR L. BEELEY, ESQ.,  Durham House,  295 Edge Lane, Liverpool.  The only difference between Mr. Churchill's conclusion of May 8th, 1911, and the statement in the letter of May 22nd, 1914, is the inclusion in the latter of the phrase \"extensive inquiries.\" Referring again to the prescribed powers of the Secretary of State, Professor Alpheus Todd in his treatise, _Parliamentary Government in England_, says: \"In addition to his prescribed police powers, large statutory authority has been assigned to the Home Secretary. He has a direct controlling power over the administration of justice and police in all the municipal boroughs.\"  It is apparent, therefore, that the \"extensive enquiries\" would be made through the very effective channels at the disposal of the Home Secretary, viz., the different police forces. Now, it is an absolute fact, and has later become common knowledge, that the various police forces throughout the United Kingdom were instructed to make full inquiries into these allegations and to report their findings to the Home Office. The fact that eight different members of Parliament, each representing different constituencies, brought the matter before the attention of the House of Commons, is further proof that the inquiries would be thorough and universal, i.e., not confined to any one part of the country. The fact that the question was debated eight times within nine months on the floor of the House of Commons is further evidence that the question had become an aggravated one and would be dealt with \"very thoroughly,\" as Mr. Churchill promised. Again, the fact, as stated by Mr. Churchill on the 18th of November, 1911, that the allegations which reached the Home Office were inquired into and no ground for action found, is an additional reason for believing that the inquiries would be thorough-going. In this connection let it be borne in mind that Mr. Churchill, on the 20th April, 1911, stated that \"the whole question is receiving consideration,\" and on the 6th of March, 1911, said: \"I am treating it in a serious spirit, and looking into it very thoroughly.\"  Now, then, in the light of these facts, the conclusion drawn by Mr. Churchill in May, 1911, and the declaration of the Home Secretary, so recent as May 22nd, 1914, to the effect \"that the extensive inquiries which were made did not reveal any grounds for legislative action,\" prove conclusively that such allegations are untrue. And what is very remarkable is the fact that Mr. Winston Churchill made this statement and reached this conclusion in spite of himself, for on the 19th of April, 1911, he implied that he himself regarded the \"Mormon\" propaganda as dangerous. Now, then, since as Professor Todd further points out, that \"He (the Home Secretary) himself is a magistrate, and exercises a power to examine and commit for trial persons charged with offenses against the State,\" is it not only reasonable to suppose that in the exercise of this power and duty he would have committed for trial and punished more rigorously any and all offenders; and further, is not the argument also tenable that he undoubtedly would have proposed and introduced \"effective legislation\"?  The judge has rendered his decision, dear reader. The court of last appeal, after \"extensive inquiries,\" has awarded in favor of the silent defendants. The \"Mormon\" elder is exonerated, and the falsifier, in spite of his prejudice, calumny and invective, has been ignominiously defeated.  The question logically rises itself here: What can be said of our accusers who persist in the circulation of these charges, who reject the findings of their own Government, and thereby insult it by tacitly implying that the British Government is aiding, abetting and conniving at the alleged infamous practices of the \"Mormon\" Church? Such a man is either an ignoramus or a prevaricator of the first water, and we care not which horn of the dilemma he chooses."]]]
