Meanwhile she had nestled comfortably among the cushions of a lounge; and when she mentioned Antyllus's unseemly conduct, she spoke of it, with a carelessness that startled Berenike, as a vexatious piece of rudeness which must not occur again.  \"But who is to prevent it?\" asked the mother anxiously.  \"Who, save ourselves?\" replied Barine.  \"He will not be admitted.\"  \"And if he forced his way in?\"  Barine's big blue eyes flashed angrily, and there was no lack of decision in her voice as she exclaimed, \"Let him try it!\"  \"But what power have we to restrain the son of Antony?\" asked Berenike. \"I do not know.\"  \"I do,\" replied her daughter.  \"I will be brief, for a visitor is coming.\"  \"So late?\" asked the mother anxiously.  \"Archibius wishes to discuss an important matter with us.\"  The lines on the brow of the older woman smoothed, but it contracted again as she exclaimed inquiringly: \"Important business at so unusual an hour!  Ah, I have expected nothing good since early morning!  On my way to my brother's a raven flew up before me and fluttered towards the left into the garden.\"  \"But I,\" replied Barine, after receiving, in reply to her inquiry, a favourable report concerning her uncle's health-\"I met seven--there were neither more nor less; for seven is the best of numbers--seven snow-white doves, which all flew swiftly towards the right.  The fairest of all came first, bearing in its beak a little basket which contained the power that will keep Antony's son away from us.  Don't look at me in such amazement, you dear receptacle of every terror.\"  \"But, child, you said that Archibius was coming so late to discuss an important matter,\" rejoined the mother.  \"He must be here soon.\"  \"Then cease this talking in riddles; I do not guess them quickly.\"  \"You will solve this one,\" returned Barine; \"but we really have no time to lose.  So-my beautiful dove was a good, wise thought, and what it carried in its basket you shall hear presently.  You see, mother, many will blame us, though here and there some one may pity; but this state of things must not continue.  I feel it more and more plainly with each passing day; and several years must yet elapse ere this scruple becomes wholly needless.  I am too young to welcome as a guest every one whom this or that man presents to me.  True, our reception-hall was my father's work-room and you, my own estimable, blameless mother, are the hostess here; but though superior to me in every respect, you are so modest that you shield yourself behind your daughter until the guests think of you only when you are absent.  So those who  seek us both merely say, 'I am going to visit Barine'--and there are too many who say this-- I can no longer choose, and this thought--\"  \"Child!  child!\" interrupted her mother joyfully, \"what god met you as you went out this morning?\"  \"Surely you know,\" she answered gaily; \"it was seven doves, and, when I took the little basket from the bill of the first and prettiest one, it told me a story.  Do you want to hear it?\"  \"Yes, yes; but be quick, or we shall be interrupted.\"  Then Barine leaned farther back among the cushions, lowered her long lashes, and began: \"Once upon a time there was a woman who had a garden in the most aristocratic quarter of the city--here near the Paneum, if you please.  In the autumn, when the fruit was ripening, she left the gate open, though all her neighbours did the opposite.  To keep away unbidden lovers of her nice figs and dates, she fastened on the gate a tablet bearing the inscription: 'All may enter and enjoy the sight of the garden; but the dogs will bite any one who breaks a flower, treads upon the grass, or steals the fruit.'  \"The woman had nothing but a lap-dog, and that did not always obey her. But the tablet fulfilled its purpose; for at first none came except her neighbours in the aristocratic quarter.  They read the threat, and probably without it would have respected the property of the woman who so kindly opened the door to them.  Thus matters went on for a time, until first a beggar came, and then a Phoenician sailor, and a thievish Egyptian from the Rhakotis--neither of whom could read.  So the tablet told them nothing; and as, moreover, they distinguished less carefully between mine and thine, one trampled the turf and another snatched from the boughs a flower or fruit.  More and more of the rabble came, and you can imagine what followed.  No one punished them for the crime, for they did not fear the barking of the lap-dog, and this gave even those who could read, courage not to heed the warning.  So the woman's pretty garden soon lost its peculiar charm; and the fruit, too, was stolen. When the rain at last washed the inscription from the tablet, and saucy boys scrawled on it, there was no harm done; for the garden no longer offered any attractions, and no one who looked into it cared to enter. Then the owner closed her gate like the neighbours, and the next year she again enjoyed the green grass and the bright hues of the flowers.  She ate her fruit herself, and the lap-dog no longer disturbed her by its barking.\"  \"That is,\" said her mother, \"if everybody was as courteous and as well bred as Gorgias, Lysias, and the others, we would gladly continue to receive them.  But since there are rude fellows like Antyllus--\"  \"You have understood the story correctly,\" Barine interrupted.  \"We are certainly at liberty to invite to our house those who have learned to read our inscription.  To-morrow visitors will be informed that we can no longer receive them as before.\"  \"Antyllus's conduct affords an excellent pretext,\" her mother added. \"Every fair-minded person must understand--\"  \"Certainly,\" said Barine, \"and if you, shrewdest of women, will do your part--  \"Then for the first time we can act as we please in our own home. Believe me, child--if you only do not--\"  \"No ifs!--not this time!\" cried the young beauty, raising her hand beseechingly.  \"It gives me such delight to think of the new life, and if matters come to pass as I hope and wish--then--do not you also believe, mother, that the gods owe me reparation?\"  \"For what?\" asked the deep voice of Archibius, who had entered unannounced, and was now first noticed by the widow and her daughter.  Barine hastily rose and held out both hands to her old friend, exclaiming, \"Since they bring you to us, they are already beginning the payment.\"     CHAPTER V.  An artist, especially a great artist, finds it easy to give his house an attractive appearance.  He desires comfort in it, and only the beautiful is comfortable to him.  Whatever would disturb harmony offends his eye, and to secure the noblest ornament of his house he need not invite any stranger to cross its threshold.  The Muse, the best of assistants, joins him unbidden.  Leonax, Barine's father, had been thus aided to transform the interior of his house into a very charming residence.  He had painted on the walls of his own work-room incidents in the life of Alexander the Great, the founder of his native city, and on the frieze a procession of dancing Cupids.  Here Barine now received her guests, and the renown of these paintings was not one of the smallest inducements which had led Antony to visit the young beauty and to take his son, in whom he wished to awaken at least a fleeting pleasure in art.  He also knew how to prize her beauty and her singing, but the ardent passion which had taken possession of him in his mature years was for Cleopatra alone.  He whose easily won heart and susceptible fancy had urged him from one commonplace love to another had been bound by the Queen with chains of indestructible and supernatural power.  By her side a Barine seemed to him merely a work of art endowed with life and a voice that charmed the ear.  Yet he owed her some pleasant hours, and he could not help bestowing gifts upon any one to whom he was indebted for anything pleasant.  He liked to be considered the most generous spendthrift on earth, and the polished bracelet set with a gem, on which was carved Apollo playing on his lyre, surrounded by the listening Muses, looked very simple, but was really an ornament of priceless value, for the artist who made it was deemed the best stone- cutter in Alexandria in the time of Philadelphus, and each one of the tiny figures sculptured on the bit of onyx scarcely three fingers wide was a carefully executed masterpiece of the most exquisite beauty. Antony had chosen it because he deemed it a fitting gift for the woman whose song had pleased him.  He had not thought of asking its value; indeed, only a connoisseur would have perceived it; and as the circlet was not showy and well became her beautiful arm, Barine liked to wear it.  Had not the war taken him away, Antony's second visit would certainly not have been his last.  Besides the singing which enthralled him, the conversation had been gay and brilliant, and in addition to Leonax's paintings, he had seen other beautiful works of art which the former had obtained by exchanging with many distinguished companions.  Nor was there any lack of plastic creations in the spacious apartment, to which the flashing of the water poured by a powerful man from the goatskin bottle on his shoulder into a shell lent a special charm.  The master who had carved this stooping Nubian had also created the much- discussed statues of the royal lovers.  The clay Eros, who with bent knee was aiming at a victim visible to himself alone, was also his work. Antony, when paying his second visit, had laughingly laid the garland he wore before \"the greatest of human conquerors,\" while a short time ago his son Antyllus had rudely thrust his bouquet of flowers into the opening of the curved right arm which was drawing the string.  In doing so the statue had been injured.  Now the flowers lay unheeded upon the little altar at"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5474"],["title","Cleopatra â€” Volume 02 (#2)"],["body"," end of the large room, lighted only by a single lamp; for the ladies had left it with their guest.  They were in Barine's favourite apartment, a small room, where there were several pictures by her dead father.  Antyllus's bouquet, and the damage to the clay statue of Eros, had played a prominent part in the conversation between the three, and rendered Archibius's task easier.  Berenike had greeted the guest with a complaint of the young Roman's recklessness and unseemly conduct, to which Barine added the declaration that they had now sacrificed enough to Zeus Xenios, the god of hospitality.  She meant to devote her future life to the modest household gods and to Apollo, to whom she owed the gift of song.  Archibius had listened silently in great surprise until she had finished her explanation and declared that henceforth she intended to live alone with her mother, instead of having her father's workshop filled with guests.  The young beauty's vivid imagination transported her to this new and quieter life.  But, spite of the clear and glowing hues in which she described her anticipations, her grey-haired listener could not have believed in them fully.  A subtle smile sometimes flitted over his grave, somewhat melancholy face--that of a man who has ceased to wrestle in the arena of life, and after severe conflict now preferred to stand among the spectators and watch others win or lose the prize of victory.  Doubtless the wounds which he had received still ached, yet his sorrowful experiences did not prevent his being an attentive observer.  The expression of his clear eyes showed that he mentally shared whatever aroused his sympathy.  Whoever understood how to listen thus, and, moreover--the prominence of the brow above the nose showed it--was also a trained thinker, could not fail to be a good counsellor, and as such he was regarded by many, and first of all by the Queen.  The wise deliberation, which was one of his characteristic traits, showed itself on this occasion; for though he had come to persuade Barine try a country residence, he refrained from doing until she had exhausted the story of her own affairs and inquired the important cause of his visit.  In the principal matter his request was granted ere he made it.  So he could begin with the query whether the mother and daughter did not think that the transition to the new mode of life could be effected more easily if they were absent from the city a short time.  It would awaken comment they should close their house against guests on the morrow, and as the true reason could not be given, many would be offended.  If, on the contrary, they could resolve to quit the capital for a few weeks, many, it is true, would lament their decision, but what was alloted to all alike could be resented by no one.  Berenike eagerly assented, but Barine grew thoughtful.  Then Archibius begged her to speak frankly, and after she had asked where they could he proposed his country estate.  His keen grey eyes had perceived that something, bound her so firmly to the city that in the case of a true woman like Barine it must be an affair of the heart.  He had evidently judged correctly, for, at his prediction that there would be no lack of visits from her dearest friends, she raised her head, her blue eyes sparkled brightly, and when Archibius paused she to her mother, exclaiming gaily \"We will go!\"  Again the vivid imagination daughter conjured the future before her in distinct outlines.  She alone knew whom she meant when she spoke of the visitor she expected at Irenia, Archibius's estate.  The name meant \"The place of peace,\" and it pleased her.  Archibius listened smilingly; but when she began to assign him also a part in driving the little Sardinian horses and pursuing the birds, he interrupted her with the statement that whether he could speedily allow himself a pleasure which he should so keenly enjoy--that of breathing the country air with such charming guests--would depend upon the fate of another.  Thank the gods, he had been able to come here with a lighter heart, because, just before his departure, he had heard of a splendid victory gained by the Queen.  The ladies would perhaps permit him to remain a little longer, as he was expecting confirmation of the news.  It was evident that he awaited it in great suspense, and that his heart was by no means free from anxiety.  Berenike shared it, and her pleasant face, which had hitherto reflected her delight at her daughter's sensible resolution, was now clouded with care as Archibius began: \"The object of my presence here?  You are making it very easy for me to attain it.  If I deemed it honest, I could now conceal the fact that I had sought you to induce you to leave the city. I see no peril from the boyish insolence of the son of Antony.  The point in question, child, is merely to put yourself out of the reach of Caesarion.\"  \"If you could place me in the moon, it would please me best, as far as he is concerned,\" replied Barine eagerly.  \"That is just what induced me to change our mode of life, since my door cannot be closed against the boy who, though still under a tutor, uses his rank as a key to open it.  And just think of being compelled to address that dreamer, with eyes pleading for help, by the title of 'king'!\"  \"Yet what mighty impulse might not be slumbering in the breast of a son of Julius Caesar and Cleopatra?\" said Archibius.  \"And passion--I know, my child, that it is no fault of yours--has now awakened within him. Whatever the result may be, it must fill his mother's heart with anxiety. That is why it is needful to hasten your departure, and to keep your destination a secret.  He will attempt no violence; but--he is the child of his parents--and some unexpected act may be anticipated from him.\"  \"You startle me!\"  cried Barine.  \"You transform the cooing dove which entered my house into a dangerous griffin.\"  \"As such you may regard him,\" said the other, warningly.  \"You will be a welcome guest, Barine, but I invited you, whom I have loved from your earliest childhood, the daughter of my dearest friend, not merely to do you a service at Irenia, but to save from grief or even annoyance the person to whom--who is not aware of it--I owe everything.\"  The words conveyed to both ladies the knowledge that, though they were dear to Archibius, he would sacrifice them, and with them, perhaps, all the rest of the world, for the peace and happiness of the Queen.  Barine had expected nothing else.  She knew that Cleopatra had made the philosopher's son a wealthy man and the owner of extensive estates; but she also felt that the source of his loyal devotion to the Queen, over whom he watched like a tender father, was due to other causes.  Cleopatra prized him also.  Had he been ambitious, he could have stood at the helm of the ship of state, as Epitrop long ago, but--the whole city knew it-- he had more than once refused to accept a permanent office, because he believed that he could serve his mistress better as an unassuming, unnoticed counsellor.  Berenike had told Barine that the relations between Cleopatra and Archibius dated back to their childhood, but she had learned no particulars.  Various rumours were afloat which, in the course of time, had been richly adorned and interwoven with anecdotes, and Barine naturally lent the most ready credence to those which asserted that the princess, in her earliest youth, had cherished a childish love for the philosopher's son.  Now her friend's conduct led her to believe it.  When Archibius paused, the young beauty assured him that she understood him; and as the alabaster hanging lamp and a three-branched light cast a brilliant glow upon the portrait which her father had painted of the nineteen-year-old Queen, and afterwards copied for his own household, she pointed to it, and, pursuing the current of her own thoughts, asked the question:  \"Was she not marvellously beautiful at that time?\"  \"As your father's work represents her,\" was the reply.  \"Leonax painted the portrait of Octavia, on the opposite side, the same year, and perhaps the artist deemed the Roman the fairer woman.\"  He pointed as he spoke to a likeness of Octavianus's sister, whom Barine's father had painted as the young wife of Marcellus, her first husband.  \"Oh, no!\"  said Berenike.  \"I still remember perfectly how Leonax returned in those days.  What woman might not have been jealous of his enthusiasm for the Roman Hera?  At that time I had not seen the portrait, and when I asked whether he thought Octavia more beautiful than the Queen, for whom Eros had inflamed his heart, as in the case of most of the beautiful women he painted, he exclaimed--you know his impetuous manner--'Octavia stands foremost in the ranks of those who are called \"beautiful\" or \"less beautiful\"; the other, Cleopatra, stands alone, and can be compared with no one.'\"  Archibius bent his head in assent, then said firmly, \"But, as a child, when I first saw her, she would have been the fairest even in the dance of the young gods of love.\"  \"How old was she then?\"  asked Barine, eagerly.  \"Eight years,\" he answered.  \"How far in the past it is, yet I have not forgotten a single hour!  \"Barine now earnestly entreated him to tell them the story of those days, but Archibius gazed thoughtfully at the floor for some time ere he raised his head and answered: \"Perhaps it will be well if you learn more of the woman for whose sake I ask a sacrifice at your hands.  Arius is your brother and uncle.  He stands near to Octavianus, for he was his intellectual guide, and I know that he reveres the Roman's sister, Octavia, as a goddess.  Antony is now struggling with Octavianus for the sovereignty of the world.  Octavia succumbed in the conflict against the woman of whom you desire to hear.  It is not my place to judge her, but I may instruct and warn.  Roman nations burn incense to Octavia, and, when Cleopatra's name is uttered, they veil their faces"]]]
