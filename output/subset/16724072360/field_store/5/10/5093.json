This passage, of course, refers directly to Adam's condition in the Garden of Eden, and not to the spirit life preceding that period of innocent ignorance. But the fact remains that man, in the spirit life, needed experience in mortality, in order to become wiser, as much as he needed a body for purposes of progression and eternal increase.  Adam Not Deceived.--When Adam and Eve partook of the forbidden fruit, it was the woman who was beguiled by Satan and induced to go contrary to the divine command. The man was not deceived. Adam was but telling the truth when he answered the Lord, \"The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat\" (Gen. 3:12). Those who satirize Father Adam for this reply, imputing to him an unworthy motive, a desire to evade responsibility and \"hide behind the woman in the case,\" take but a superficial view of the subject. Adam was not trying to evade the issue: he was simply stating the fact. The Lord wanted the truth, and no fable would suffice, however polite, in the opinion of shallow wits or would-be chivalrous wisacres, it might have been to invent one, in order to shield the fair transgressor.  A Deliberate Transgression.--Adam, after Eve had transgressed, did likewise in order to carry out a divine command previously given--the command to multiply and replenish the earth (Gen. 1:28). Eve, by her act, had separated herself from her husband, and made it impossible, unless he followed her and also became mortal, to carry out God's original behest. This was Adam's motive. He was facing a dilemma. He must make choice between two divine commands, and doubtless felt that he could not consistently do otherwise than as he did. He disobeyed in order to obey, retrieving, so far as he possibly could, the situation resulting from Eve's disobedience. He did it wittingly, deliberately, undeceived as to the consequences, realizing that in no other way could he carry out God's first command and become the progenitor of the human race. Adam and Eve, with their eyes open, rejoiced over what had befallen them, recognizing it as part of a preordained plan to people the earth with their posterity, and afford to a world of waiting spirits the opportunity, long anticipated, of taking earthly tabernacles and starting out upon their great pilgrimage to perfection.  Adam and Eve Rejoice.--\"And in that day Adam blessed God and was filled, and began to prophesy concerning all the families of the earth, saying: Blessed be the name of God, for because of my transgression my eyes are opened, and in this life I shall have joy, and again in the flesh I shall see God.  \"And Eve, his wife, heard all these things and was glad, saying: Were it not for our transgression we never should have had seed, and never should have known good and evil, and the joy of our redemption, and the eternal life which God giveth unto all the obedient.\"--(\"Pearl of Great Price,\" Book of Moses, 5:10,11.)  \"Adam fell that man might be, and man is that he might have joy.\" But there would be no joy, no progress, no eternal life for fallen man--only pain, sorrow, and everlasting banishment from God's presence, had Christ not died to nullify the ill effects of Adam's act, and lift man up from his fallen condition.  Human Standards and Divine Dispensations.--Why, it may be asked, did God place Adam and Eve in so seemingly contradictory a position? Why were they forbidden to do what they had manifestly come to do, and which had to be done in order to carry out the divine purpose? For that is the problem in a nutshell, as it appears to human eyes. I can only answer in the words of Nephi: \"All things have been done in the wisdom of him who knoweth all things.\" Man cannot sit in judgment upon his Maker, nor measure by human standards divine dispensations. The God who gives life, and takes it, without committing murder, can command today and countermand tomorrow, and yet remain consistent and unchangeable. In a world where faith is necessary to progress, and where premature knowledge would prevent progress by swallowing up faith, by destroying the opportunity for its exercise, man must not expect to know all things. That calamities and sacrifices bring forth blessings, is apparent to observation and experience; but the deep why and wherefore of it all remains a mystery. Adam's fall and Christ's atonement were fearful calamities, from the human point of view; but wonderful benefits and advantages accrued therefrom. Just why such sacrifices have to be made, however, in order that such blessings may come, is too profound a problem for the finite mind to solve.  Spiritual and Temporal Death.--The fall brought man into the world--into this state of mortality; but it also brought death, with all its sad concomitants. Not such a death as the righteous now contemplate, and such as both righteous and unrighteous must undergo, as a change preparatory to resurrection. There was no resurrection when Adam fell--not upon this planet--nothing but death, resting like a pall over the prospective human race. Adam and Eve, after the fall, were spiritually dead, and were doomed to the temporal death as well--the dissolution of the body--and they had entailed this fate upon their posterity. Hell had triumphed over man's, or rather woman's, weakness. Life was dead, death reigned, and demons held high carnival.  The World in Pawn.--Adam's transgression had put the world in pawn. The name of the pawnbroker was death, and his claim was twofold. Death held all things in his grasp, and there was no help for it this side of heaven. No part of what had been pledged could be used as the means of redemption. Adam could not redeem himself, great and mighty as he was--in the spirit; for he was no other than Michael the archangel, leader of the hosts of heaven. But this puissant Michael was now a weak, frail, mortal man, under the penalty of a broken law, and powerless to repair the injury that had been wrought. He and the race that was to spring from him were utterly lost, unless the Almighty One would intervene, and do for them what they could not do for themselves. If man could have redeemed himself, it would have been required of him; but because self-redemption was impossible, a Redeemer had to be provided.  The Redemption.--Redemption must come, if at all, through some Being high enough and powerful enough to make an infinite atonement, one fully covering the far-reaching effects of the original transgression. The scales of eternal justice, unbalanced by Adam's act, had to be repoised, and right's equilibrium restored. Who could do this? Who could retrieve the situation, bring good out of evil, mould failure into success, and snatch victory from the jaws of defeat? Where was the Moses for such an exodus? Where the deliverance from this worse than Egyptian bondage--a bondage of which Egypt's slavery was but typical?  The life of a God was the price of the world's freedom, and that price was paid by the God of Israel, who descended from his glorious throne, made himself mortal, an exile of eternity, walked in the dust of his own footstool, and by submitting to death, broke the bands of death, and made it possible for man to live again, and go on to the goal of endless glory. He was the Lamb \"without spot or blemish,\" typified by the lamb of the Passover, and preordained for sacrifice, to \"take away the sins of the world.\" He gave himself as an offering, as a ransom for human redemption, and by the shedding of his own blood, paid the debt of the universe, took the world out of pawn, and became the Author of Salvation for all mankind.    CHAPTER IV.  The Gods in Council.  Fore-ordination.--The parts played by Adam and Eve in this sublime tragedy were doubtless cast at the same time that the pre-eminent role was assigned to the Redeemer and Savior. Likewise, is it just as reasonable to infer that other great ones were forechosen for service in the cause of humanity. It is more than an inference; it is a revealed fact. What other meaning can be attached to the word of the Lord to Jeremiah (1:5): \"Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations\"? If this be true of Jeremiah, why not true of other prophets, both ancient and modern? Joseph Smith is on record as saying that men who have such callings to minister to the inhabitants of the world, were \"ordained to that very purpose in the grand council of heaven before this world was\" (\"Compendium,\" p. 285).  Two Plans Proposed.--In that same Grand Council--the \"congregation of the mighty\" (Ps. 1:5)--there were two candidates, if we may so designate them, for the redeemership. One was like unto the Father, desiring for the pure love of God's children to uplift them, and at the same time glorify the Great Head, by the sacrifice that he proposed to make. The other was proud, self-willed, and bent upon personal aggrandizement, regardless of consequences. The former stood for freedom--man's agency--and the rewarding of all souls according to their works. The latter proposed coercion, so that not one soul should be lost; thinking, perhaps, that his demanded compensation for proposed service might be made in that way all the more abundant.  Lucifer Rebels.--The first was chosen; the second rebelled, and was cast out, with a third of those then populating the spirit world. That third, following Lucifer, who became Satan, were doomed with him to wander up and down the earth, as fallen spirits, tempting and trying the children of men--those who, as a reward for keeping their first estate, where they \"walked by sight,\" were given a second estate--the privilege of taking tabernacles, and \"walking by faith\" through the shadowed experiences of mortality.  Upon this subject the Prophet Joseph says: \"The contention in heaven was: Jesus said there would be certain souls that would not be saved; "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50566"],["title","Falcons of Narabedla (#1)"],["body","clean out my drawer.  I got along all right in Alaska, for a while. But I wasn't the same. The armistice had hardly been signed when they sent me back to the States with a recommendation of overwork. I tried to explain it to Andy. \"They said I needed a rest. Maybe so. The shock did something funny to me ... tore me open ... like the electric shock treatments they give catatonic patients. I know a lot of things I never learned. Ordinary radio work doesn't mean anything to me any more. It doesn't make sense. When people out west were talking about flying saucers or whatever they were--and when they talked about weather disturbances after the atomic tests, things did make sense for a while. And when we came down here--\" I paused, trying to fit confused impressions together. He wasn't going to believe me, anyhow, but I wanted him to. A tree slapped against the cabin window; I jumped. \"It started up again the day we came up in the mountains. Energy out of nowhere, following me around. It can't knock me out. Have you noticed I let you turn the lights on and off? The day we came up, I shorted my electric razor and blew out five fuses trying to change one.\"  \"Yeah, I remember, you had to drive to town for them--\" My brother's eyes watched me, uneasy. \"Mike, you're kidding--\"  \"I wish I were,\" I said. \"That energy just drains into me, and nothing happens. I'm immune.\" I shrugged, rose and walked across to the radio I'd put in here, so carefully, before the war. I picked up the disconnected plug; thrust it into the socket. I snapped the dial on. \"I'll show you,\" I told him.  The panel flashed and darkened; confused static came cracking from the speaker, erratic. I took my hand away.  \"Turn it up--\" Andy said uneasily.  My hand twiddled the dial. \"It's already up.\"  \"Try another station;\" the kid insisted stubbornly. I pushed all the buttons in succession; the static crackled and buzzed, the panel light flickered on and off in little cryptic flashes. I sighed. \"And reception was perfect at noon,\" I told him, \"You were listening to the news.\" I took my hand away again. \"I don't want to blow the thing up.\"  Andy came over and switched the button back on. The little panel light glowed steadily, and the mellow voice of Milton Cross filled the room ... \"now conduct the Boston Philharmonic Orchestra in the Fifth or 'Fate' symphony of Ludwig von Beethoven ...\" the noise of mixed applause, and then the majestic chords of the symphony, thundering through the rooms of the cabin.  \"Ta-da-da-dumm----Ta-da-da-DUMM!\"  My brother stared at me as racing woodwinds caught up with the brasses. There was nothing wrong with the radio. \"Mike. What did you do to it?\"  \"I wish I knew,\" I told him. Reaching, I touched the volume button again.  Beethoven died in a muttering static like a thousand drums.  I swore and Andy sucked in his breath between his teeth, edging warily backward. He touched the dials again; once more the smoothness of the \"Fate\" symphony rolled out and swallowed us. I shivered.  \"You'd better let it alone!\" Andy said shakily.  The kid turned in early, but I stayed in the main room, smoking restlessly and wishing I could get a drink without driving eighty miles over bad mountain roads. Neither of us had thought to turn off the radio; it was moaning out some interminable throbbing jazz. I turned over my notes, restlessly, not really seeing them. Once Andy's voice came sleepily from the alcove.  \"Going to read all night, Mike?\"  \"If I feel like it,\" I said tersely and began walking up and down again.  \"Michael! For the luvvagod stop it and let me get some sleep!\" Andy exploded, and I sank down in the chair again. \"Sorry, Andy.\"  Where had the intangible part of me been, those eighteen hours when I first lay crushed under a fallen beam, then under morphine in the hospital? Where had those scars come from? More important, what had made a radio lab blow up in the first place? Electricity sets fires; it shocks men into insensibility or death. It doesn't explode. Radio waves are in themselves harmless. Most important of all, what maniac freak of lightning was I carrying in my body that made me immune to electrical current? I hadn't told Andy about the time I'd deliberately grounded the electric dynamo in the cellar and taken the whole voltage in my body. I was still alive. It would have been a hell of a way to commit suicide--but I hadn't.  I swore, slamming down the window. I was going to bed. Andy was right. Either I was crazy or there was something wrong; in any case, sitting here wouldn't help. If it didn't let up, I'd take the first train home and see a good electrician--or a psychiatrist. But right now, I was going to hit the sack.  My hand went out automatically and switched the light off.  \"Damn!\" I thought incredulously. I'd shorted the dynamo again. The radio stopped as if the whole orchestra had dropped dead; every light in the cabin winked swiftly out, but my hand on the switch crackled with a phosphorescent glow as the entire house current poured into my body. I tingled with weird shock; I heard my own teeth chattering.  And something snapped wide open in my brain. I heard, suddenly, an excited voice, shouting.  \"Rhys! _Rhys!_ That is the man!\"     CHAPTER TWO  Rainbow City   \"_You are mad_,\" said the man with the tired voice.  I was drifting. I was swaying, bodiless, over a huge abyss of caverned space; chasmed, immense, limitless. Vaguely, through a sleeping distance, I heard two voices. This one was old and very tired.  \"You are mad. They will know. Narayan will know.\"  \"Narayan is a fool,\" said the second voice.  \"Narayan is the Dreamer,\" the tired voice said. \"He is the Dreamer, and where the Dreamer walks he will know. But have it your way. I am very old and it does not matter. I give you this power, freely--to spare you. But Gamine--\"  \"Gamine--\" the second voice stopped. After a long time, \"You are old, and a fool, Rhys,\" it said. \"What is Gamine to me?\"  Bodiless, blind, I drifted and swayed and swung in the sound of the voices. The humming, like a million high-tension wires, sang around me and I felt myself cradled in the pull of a great magnet that held me suspended surely on nothingness and drew me down into the field of some force beneath. Far below me the voices faded. I swung free--fell--plunged downward in sickening motion, head over heels, into the abyss....  My feet struck hard flooring. I wrenched back to consciousness with a jolt. Winds blew coldly in my face; the cabin walls had been flung back to the high-lying stars. I was standing at a barred window at the very pinnacle of a tall tower, in the lap of a weird blueness that arched flickeringly in the night. I caught a glimpse of a startled face, a lean tired old face beneath a peaked hood, in the moment before my knees gave way and I fell, striking my head against the bars of the window.  I was lying on a narrow, high bed in a room filled with doors and bars. I could see the edge of a carved mirror set in a frame, and the top of a chest of some kind. On a bench at the edge of my field of vision there were two figures sitting. One was the old grey man, hunched wearily beneath his robe, wearing robes like a Tibetan Lama's, somber black, and a peaked hood of grey. The other was a slimmer younger figure, swathed in silken silvery veiling, with a thin opacity where the face should have been, and a sort of opalescent shine of flesh through the silvery-sapphire silks. The figure was that of a boy or a slim immature girl; it sat erect, motionless, and for a long time I studied it, curious, between half-opened lids. But when I blinked, it rose and passed through one of the multitudinous doors; at once a soft sibilance of draperies announced return. I sat up, getting my feet to the floor, or almost there; the bed was higher than a hospital bed. The blue-robe held a handled mug, like a baby's drinking-cup, at me. I took it in my hand hesitated--  \"Neither drug nor poison,\" said the blue-robe mockingly, and the voice was as noncommittal as the veiled body; a sexless voice, soft alto, a woman's or a boy's. \"Drink and be glad it is none of Karamy's brewing.\"  I tasted the liquid in the mug; it had an indeterminate greenish look and a faint pungent taste I could not identify, although it reminded me variously of anise and garlic. It seemed to remove the last traces of shock. I handed the cup back empty and looked sharply at the old man in the Lama costume.  \"You're--Rhys?\" I said. \"Where in hell have I gotten to?\" At least, that's what I meant to say. Imagine my surprise when I found myself asking--in a language I'd never heard, but understood perfectly--\"To which of the domains of Zandru have I been consigned now?\" At the same moment I became conscious of what I was wearing. It seemed to be an old-fashioned nightshirt, chopped off at the loins, deep crimson in color. \"Red flannels yet!\" I thought with a gulp of dismay. I checked my impulse to get out of bed. Who could act sane in a red nightshirt?  \"You might have the decency to explain where I am,\" I said. \"If you know.\"  The tiredness seemed part of Rhys voice. \"Adric,\" he said wearily. \"Try to remember.\" He shrugged his lean shoulders. \"You are in your own Tower. And you have been under restraint again. I am sorry.\" His voice sounded futile. I felt prickling shivers run down my backbone. In spite of the weird surroundings, the phrase \"under restraint\" had struck home. I was a lunatic in an asylum.  The blue-robed one cut in in that smooth, sexless, faint-sarcastic voice. \"While Karamy holds the amnesia-ray, Rhys, you will be explaining it to him a dozen times a cycle. He will never be of use to us again. This time Karamy won. Adric; try to remember. You are at home, in Narabedla.\"  I shook my head. Nightshirt or no nightshirt, I'd face this on my feet. I walked to Rhys; put my clenched hands on his shoulders. \"Explain this! Who am I supposed to be? You called me Adric. I'm no more Adric than you are!\"  \"Adr"]]]
