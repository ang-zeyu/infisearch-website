When he did, only Crifer seemed at all interested, yet the lame-footed man's mind was inadequate to cope with the situation. He suggested that the viewport might also be variable and Rikud found himself wishing that his friend had never read that book on astronomy.  Chuls did not believe Rikud at all. \"There are not that many doors in the world,\" he said. \"The library has a door and there is a door to the women's quarters; in five years, the Calculator will send you through that. But there are no others.\"  Chuls smiled an indulgent smile and Rikud came nearer to him. \"Now, by the world, there are two other doors!\"  Rikud began to shout, and everyone looked at him queerly.  \"What are you doing that for?\" demanded Wilm, who was shorter even than Crifer, but had no lame foot.  \"Doing what?\"  \"Speaking so loudly when Chuls, who is close, obviously has no trouble hearing you.\"  \"Maybe yelling will make him understand.\"  Crifer hobbled about on his good foot, doing a meaningless little jig. \"Why don't we go see?\" he suggested. Then, confused, he frowned.  \"Well, I won't go,\" Chuls replied. \"There's no reason to go. If Rikud has been imagining things, why should I?\"  \"I imagined nothing. I'll show you--\"  \"You'll show me nothing because I won't go.\"  Rikud grabbed Chuls' blouse with his big fist. Then, startled by what he did, his hands began to tremble. But he held on, and he tugged at the blouse.  \"Stop that,\" said the older man, mildly.         *       *       *       *       *  Crifer hopped up and down. \"Look what Rikud's doing! I don't know what he's doing, but look. He's holding Chuls' blouse.\"  \"Stop that,\" repeated Chuls, his face reddening.  \"Only if you'll go with me.\" Rikud was panting.  Chuls tugged at his wrist. By this time a crowd had gathered. Some of them watched Crifer jump up and down, but most of them watched Rikud holding Chuls' blouse.  \"I think I can do that,\" declared Wilm, clutching a fistful of Crifer's shirt.  Presently, the members of the crowd had pretty well paired off, each partner grabbing for his companion's blouse. They giggled and laughed and some began to hop up and down as Crifer had done.  A buzzer sounded and automatically Rikud found himself releasing Chuls.  Chuls said, forgetting the incident completely, \"Time to retire.\"  In a moment, the room was cleared. Rikud stood alone. He cleared his throat and listened to the sound, all by itself in the stillness. What would have happened if they hadn't retired? But they always did things punctually like that, whenever the buzzer sounded. They ate with the buzzer, bathed in the health-rays with it, slept with it.  What would they do if the buzzer stopped buzzing?  This frightened Rikud, although he didn't know why. He'd like it, though. Maybe then he could take them outside with him to the big garden of the two viewports. And then he wouldn't be afraid because he could huddle close to them and he wouldn't be alone.         *       *       *       *       *  Rikud heard the throbbing again as he stood in the room of the machinery. For a long time he watched the wheels and cogs and gears spinning and humming. He watched for he knew not how long. And then he began to wonder. If he destroyed the wheels and the cogs and the gears, would the buzzer stop? It probably would, because, as Rikud saw it, he was clearly an \"unauthorized person.\" He had heard the voice again upon entering the room.  He found a metal rod, bright and shiny, three feet long and half as wide as his arm. He tugged at it and it came loose from the wires that held it in place. He hefted it carefully for a moment, and then he swung the bar into the mass of metal. Each time he heard a grinding, crashing sound. He looked as the gears and cogs and wheels crumbled under his blows, shattered by the strength of his arm.  Almost casually he strode about the room, but his blows were not casual. Soon his easy strides had given way to frenzied running. Rikud smashed everything in sight.  When the lights winked out, he stopped. Anyway, by that time the room was a shambles of twisted, broken metal. He laughed, softly at first, but presently he was roaring, and the sound doubled and redoubled in his ears because now the throbbing had stopped.  He opened the door and ran through the little corridor to the smaller viewport. Outside he could see the stars, and, dimly, the terrain beneath them. But everything was so dark that only the stars shone clearly. All else was bathed in a shadow of unreality.  Rikud never wanted to do anything more than he wanted to open that door. But his hands trembled too much when he touched it, and once, when he pressed his face close against the viewport, there in the darkness, something bright flashed briefly through the sky and was gone.  Whimpering, he fled.         *       *       *       *       *  All around Rikud were darkness and hunger and thirst. The buzzer did not sound because Rikud had silenced it forever. And no one went to eat or drink. Rikud himself had fumbled through the blackness and the whimpering to the dining room, his tongue dry and swollen, but the smooth belt that flowed with water and with savory dishes did not run any more. The machinery, Rikud realized, also was responsible for food.  Chuls said, over and over, \"I'm hungry.\"  \"We will eat and we will drink when the buzzer tells us,\" Wilm replied confidently.  \"It won't any more,\" Rikud said.  \"What won't?\"  \"The buzzer will never sound again. I broke it.\"  Crifer growled. \"I know. You shouldn't have done it. That was a bad thing you did, Rikud.\"  \"It was not bad. The world has moved through the blackness and the stars and now we should go outside to live in the big garden there beyond the viewport.\"  \"That's ridiculous,\" Chuls said.  Even Crifer now was angry at Rikud. \"He broke the buzzer and no one can eat. I hate Rikud, I think.\"  There was a lot of noise in the darkness, and someone else said, \"I hate Rikud.\" Then everyone was saying it.  Rikud was sad. Soon he would die, because no one would go outside with him and he could not go outside alone. In five more years he would have had a woman, too. He wondered if it was dark and hungry in the women's quarters. Did women eat?  Perhaps they ate plants. Once, in the garden, Rikud had broken off a frond and tasted it. It had been bitter, but not unpleasant. Maybe the plants in the viewport would even be better.  \"We will not be hungry if we go outside,\" he said. \"We can eat there.\"  \"We can eat if the buzzer sounds, but it is broken,\" Chuls said dully.  Crifer shrilled, \"Maybe it is only variable and will buzz again.\"  \"No,\" Rikud assured him. \"It won't.\"  \"Then you broke it and I hate you,\" said Crifer. \"We should break you, too, to show you how it is to be broken.\"  \"We must go outside--through the viewport.\" Rikud listened to the odd gurgling sound his stomach made.  A hand reached out in the darkness and grabbed at his head. He heard Crifer's voice. \"I have Rikud's head.\" The voice was nasty, hostile.  Crifer, more than anyone, had been his friend. But now that he had broken the machinery, Crifer was his enemy, because Crifer came nearer to understanding the situation than anyone except Rikud.  The hand reached out again, and it struck Rikud hard across the face. \"I hit him! I hit him!\"  Other hands reached out, and Rikud stumbled. He fell and then someone was on top of him, and he struggled. He rolled and was up again, and he did not like the sound of the angry voices. Someone said, \"Let us do to Rikud what he said he did to the machinery.\" Rikud ran. In the darkness, his feet prodded many bodies. There were those who were too weak to rise. Rikud, too, felt a strange light-headedness and a gnawing hurt in his stomach. But it didn't matter. He heard the angry voices and the feet pounding behind him, and he wanted only to get away.  It was dark and he was hungry and everyone who was strong enough to run was chasing him, but every time he thought of the garden outside, and how big it was, the darkness and the hunger and the people chasing him were unimportant. It was so big that it would swallow him up completely and positively.  He became sickly giddy thinking about it.  But if he didn't open the door and go into the garden outside, he would die because he had no food and no water and his stomach gurgled and grumbled and hurt. And everyone was chasing him.  He stumbled through the darkness and felt his way back to the library, through the inner door and into the room with the voice--but the voice didn't speak this time--through its door and into the place of machinery. Behind him, he could hear the voices at the first door, and he thought for a moment that no one would come after him. But he heard Crifer yell something, and then feet pounding in the passage.  Rikud tripped over something and sprawled awkwardly across the floor. He felt a sharp hurt in his head, and when he reached up to touch it with his hands there in the darkness, his fingers came away wet.  He got up slowly and opened the next door. The voices behind him were closer now. Light streamed in through the viewport. After the darkness, it frightened Rikud and it made his eyes smart, and he could hear those behind him retreating to a safe distance. But their voices were not far away, and he knew they would come after him because they wanted to break him.  Rikud looked out upon the garden and he trembled. Out there was life. The garden stretched off in unthinkable immensity to the cluster of low mounds against the bright blue which roofed the many plants. If plants could live out there as they did within the world, then so could people. Rikud and his people _should_. This was why the world had moved across the darkness and the stars for all Rikud's lifetime and more. But he was afraid.  He reached up and grasped the handle of the door and he saw that his fingers were red with the wetness which had come from his hurt head. Slowly he slipped to the cool floor--"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51305"],["title","Confidence Game (#1)"],["body","eat.\"  It was certainly unfair and probably immoral. But I had no choice whatever.  \"Okay,\" I said, tasting bitterness over the craving.         *       *       *       *       *  The coffee was in a thick white cup before me on the counter. It was pale, grayish brown and steaming faintly. I picked it up in both hands to feel its warmth.  Out of the corner of my eye, I could see the woman sitting on the stool beside me. She had no right to intrude. This moment should be mine, but there she sat, marring it for me, a contemptible _tourist_.  I gulped down the thick, dark liquid brutally. It was all I could do. The cramp flowed out of my diaphragm. I took another swallow and was able to think straight again. A third swallow and I felt--good. Not abnormally stimulated, but strong, alert, poised on the brink of exhilaration.  That was what coffee did for me.  I was a caffeine addict.  Earth-norm humans sometimes have the addiction to a slight extent, but I knew that as a Centurian I had it infinitely worse. Caffeine affected my metabolism like a pure alkaloid. The immediate effects weren't the same, but the _need_ ran as deep.  I finished the cup. I didn't order another because I wasn't a pure sensualist. I just needed release. Sometimes, when I didn't have the price of a cup, I would look around in alleys and find cola bottles with a few drops left in them. They have a little caffeine in them--not enough, never enough, but better than nothing.  \"Now what do you want to eat?\" the woman asked.  I didn't look at her. She didn't know. She thought I was a human--an _Earth_ human. I was a _man_, of course, not an _alien_ like a Martian. Earthmen ran the whole Solar Federation, but I was just as good as an Earthman. With my suntan and short mane, I could pass, couldn't I? That proved it, didn't it?  \"Hamburger,\" I said. \"Well done.\" I knew that would probably be all they had fit to eat at a place like this. It might be horse meat, but then I didn't have the local prejudices.  I didn't look at the woman. I couldn't. But I kept remembering how clean she looked and I was aware of how clean she smelled. I was so dirty, so very dirty that I could never get clean if I bathed every hour for the rest of my life.  The hamburger was engulfed by five black-crowned, broken fingernails and raised to two rows of yellow ivory. I surrounded it like an ameba, almost in a single movement of my jaws.  Several other hamburgers followed the first. I lost count. I drank a glass of milk. I didn't want to black out on coffee with Doc waiting for me.  \"Could I have a few to take with me, miss?\" I pleaded.  She smiled. I caught that out of the edge of my vision, but mostly I just felt it.  \"That's the first time you've called me anything but 'ma'am',\" she said. \"I'm not an old-maid schoolteacher, you know.\"  That probably meant she was a schoolteacher, though. \"No, miss,\" I said.  \"It's Miss Casey--Vivian Casey,\" she corrected. She was a schoolteacher, all right. No other girl would introduce herself as Miss Last Name. Then there was something in her voice....  \"What's your name?\" she said to me.  I choked a little on a bite of stale bun.  I _had_ a name, _of course_.         *       *       *       *       *  Everybody has a name, and I knew if I went off somewhere quiet and thought about it, mine would come to me. Meanwhile, I would tell the girl that my name was ... Kevin O'Malley. Abruptly I realized that that _was_ my name.  \"Kevin,\" I told her. \"John Kevin.\"  \"Mister Kevin,\" she said, her words dancing with bright absurdity like waterhose mist on a summer afternoon, \"I wonder if you could help _me_.\"  \"Happy to, miss,\" I mumbled.  She pushed a white rectangle in front of me on the painted maroon bar. \"What do you think of this?\"  I looked at the piece of paper. It was a coupon from a magazine.      Dear Acolyte R. I. S.:      Please send me FREE of obligation, in sealed wrapper, \"The     Scarlet Book\" revealing to me how I may gain Secret Mastery of the     Universe      Name: ........................      Address: .....................  The world disoriented itself and I was on the floor of the somber diner and Miss Vivian Casey was out of sight and scent.  There was a five dollar bill tight in my fist. The counterman was trying to pull it out.  I looked up at his stubbled face. \"I had half a dozen hamburgers, a cup of coffee and a glass of milk. I want four more 'burgers to go and a pint of coffee. By your prices, that will be one sixty-five--if the lady didn't pay you.\"  \"She didn't,\" he stammered. \"Why do you think I was trying to get that bill out of your hand?\"  I didn't say anything, just got up off the floor. After the counterman put down my change, I spread out the five dollar bill on the vacant bar, smoothing it.  I scooped up my change and walked out the door. There was no one on the sidewalk, only in the doorways.         *       *       *       *       *  First I opened the door on an amber world, then an azure one. Neon light was coming from the chickenwire border of the room, from a window somewhere beyond. The wino on one side of the room was singing and the one on the other side was praying, same as before. Only they had changed around--prayer came from the left, song from the right.  Doc sat on the floor in the half-darkness and he had made a _thing_.  My heart hammered at my lungs. I _knew_ this last time had been different. Whatever it was was getting closer. This was the first time Doc had ever made anything. It didn't look like much, but it was a start.  He had broken the light bulb and used the filament and screw bottom. His strong hands had unraveled some of the bed \"springs\"--metal webbing--and fashioned them to his needs. My orb-point pen had dissolved under his touch. All of them, useless parts, were made into a meaningful whole.  I knew the thing had meaning, but when I tried to follow its design, I became lost.  I put the paper container of warm coffee and the greasy bag of hamburgers on the wooden chair, hoping the odor wouldn't bring any hungry rats out of the walls.  I knelt beside Doc.  \"An order, my boy, an order,\" he whispered.  I didn't know what he meant. Was he suddenly trying to give me orders?  He held something out to me. It was my notebook. He had used my pen, before dismantling it, to write something. I tilted the notebook against the neon light, now red wine, now fresh grape. I read it.  \"Concentrate,\" Doc said hoarsely. \"Concentrate....\"  I wondered what the words meant. Wondering takes a kind of concentration.  The words \"First Edition\" were what I was thinking about most.         *       *       *       *       *  The heavy-set man in the ornate armchair was saying, \"The bullet struck me as I was pulling on my boot....\"  I was kneeling on the floor of a Victorian living room. I'm quite familiar with Earth history and I recognized the period immediately.  Then I realized what I had been trying to get from Doc all these months--time travel.  A thin, sickly man was sprawled in the other chair in a rumpled dressing gown. My eyes held to his face, his pinpoint pupils and whitened nose. He was a condemned snowbird! If there was anything I hated or held in more contempt than tourists or Martians, it was a snowbird.  \"My clients have occasioned singular methods of entry into these rooms,\" the thin man remarked, \"but never before have they used instantaneous materialization.\"  The heavier man was half choking, half laughing. \"I say--I say, I would like to see you explain this, my dear fellow.\"  \"I have no data,\" the thin man answered coolly. \"In such instance, one begins to twist theories into fact, or facts into theories. I must ask this unemployed, former professional man who has gone through a serious illness and is suffering a more serious addiction to tell me the place and _time_ from which he comes.\"  The surprise stung. \"How did you know?\" I asked.  He gestured with a pale hand. \"To maintain a logical approach, I must reject the supernatural. Your arrival, unless hallucinatory--and despite my voluntary use of one drug and my involuntary experiences recently with another, I must accept the evidence of my senses or retire from my profession--your arrival was then super-normal. I might say super-scientific, of a science not of my or the good doctor's time, clearly. Time travel is a familiar folk legend and I have been reading an article by the entertaining Mr. Wells. Perhaps he will expand it into one of his novels of scientific romance.\"  I knew who these two men were, with a tormenting doubt. \"But the other--\"  \"Your hands, though unclean, have never seen physical labor. Your cranial construction is of a superior type, or even if you reject my theories, concentration does set the facial features. I judge you have suffered an illness because of the inhibition of your beard growth. Your over-fondness for rum or opium, perhaps, is self-evident. You are at too resilient an age to be so sunk by even an amour. Why else then would you let yourself fall into such an underfed and unsanitary state?\"         *       *       *       *       *  He was so smug and so sure, this snowbird. I hated him. Because I couldn't trust to my own senses as he did.  \"You don't exist,\" I said slowly, painfully. \"You are fictional creations.\"  The doctor flushed darkly. \"You give my literary agent too much credit for the addition of professional polish to my works.\"  The other man was filling a large, curved pipe from something that looked vaguely like an ice-skate. \"Interesting. Perhaps if our visitor would tell us something of his age with special reference to the theory and practice of temporal transference, Doctor, we would be better equipped to judge whether we exist.\"  There was no theory or practice of time travel. I told them all I had ever heard theorized from Hindu yoga through Extra-sensory Perception to Relativity and the positron and negatron.  \"Interesting.\" He breathed out suffocating black clouds of smoke. \"P"]]]
