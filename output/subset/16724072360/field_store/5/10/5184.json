Here, difficult going demanded full attention.         *       *       *       *       *  He'd never gone as far as the bridge before, not having wanted to look as if he might be leaving the city. The approach was a jungle of concrete with an underbrush of reinforcing-steel that reached for the unwary with rusted spines. Frequently they had to balance on cracked girders, and inch over roadless spots high off the ground.  Here Ida took the lead. When they got to where three approach roads made a clover-leaf, she led him down a side road and into a forest.  Roddie stopped, and seized her arm.  \"What are you trying to do?\" he demanded.  \"I'm taking you with me,\" Ida said firmly. \"Taking you where you belong!\"  \"No!\" he blurted, drawing his hammer. \"I can't go, nor let you go. I belong here!\"  Ida gasped, twisted loose, and ran. Roddie ran after her.  She wasn't so easily caught. Like a frightened doe, she dashed in and out among the trees, leaped to the bridge's underpinnings where they thrust rustedly from a cliff, and scrambled up the ramp.  Roddie sighed and slowed down. The pavement ended just beyond the cable anchors. From there to the south tower, only an occasional dangling support wire showed where the actual bridge had been suspended. Ida was trapped.  He could take his time. Let the soldiers come up, as they undoubtedly would, to finish the job....  But Ida didn't seem to realize she was trapped. Without hesitation she dashed up the main left-hand suspension cable and ran along its curved steel surface.  For a moment, Roddie thought of letting her go, letting her run up the ever-steepening catenary until--because there were no guard-ropes or handgrips--she simply fell. That would solve his problem.  Except it wouldn't be _his_ solution. Her death wouldn't prove him to his friends.  He set out quickly, before Ida was lost to sight in the thick fog that billowed in straight from the ocean. At first he ran erect along the top of the yard-wide cylinder of twisted metal, but soon the curve steepened. He had to go on all fours, clinging palm and sole.  Blood was on the cable where she'd passed. More blood stained it when he'd followed.  But because his friends knew neither pain nor fatigue, Roddie would admit none either. Nor would he give in to the fear that dizzied him at every downward look. He scrambled on like an automaton, watching only his holds, till he rammed Ida's rear with his head.         *       *       *       *       *  She had stopped, trembling and gasping. Roddie clung just below her and looked dazedly around. There was nothing in sight but fog, pierced by the rapier of rusted wire supporting them. Neither end of it was in sight.  Upward lay success, if death were not nearer on the cable. No soldier had ever come even this far, for soldiers, as he'd told Ida, never left the city, were not built to do so. But _he_ was here; with luck, he could capitalize on the differences that had plagued him so long.  \"Go on!\" he ordered hoarsely. \"Move!\"  There was neither answer nor result. He broke off an end of loosened wire and jabbed her rear. Ida gasped and crawled on.  Up and up they went, chilled, wet, bleeding, pain-racked, exhausted. Never had Roddie felt so thoroughly the defects of his peculiar non-mechanical construction.  Without realizing it, he acquired a new purpose, a duty as compelling as that of any soldier or fire-watcher. He had to keep that trembling body of his alive, mount to the tall rust tower overhead.  He climbed and he made Ida climb, till, at nightmare's end, the fog thinned and they came into clear, windswept air and clawed up the last hundred feet to sanctuary.  They were completely spent. Without word or thought they crept within the tower, huddled together for warmth on its dank steel deck, and slept for several hours.         *       *       *       *       *  Roddie awoke as Ida finished struggling free of his unconscious grip. Limping, he joined her painful walk around the tower. From its openings they looked out on a strange and isolated world.  To the north, where Ida seemed drawn as though by instinct, Mount Tamalpais reared its brushy head, a looming island above a billowy white sea of fog. To the south were the Twin Peaks, a pair of buttons on a cotton sheet. Eastward lay Mount Diablo, bald and brooding, tallest of the peaks and most forbidding.  But westward over the ocean lay the land of gold--of all the kinds of gold there are, from brightest yellow to deepest orange. Only a small portion of the setting sun glared above the fog-bank; the rest seemed to have been broken off and smeared around by a child in love with its color.  Fascinated, Roddie stared for minutes, but turned when Ida showed no interest. She was intent on the tower itself. Following her eyes, Roddie saw his duty made suddenly clear.  Easy to make out even in the fading light was the route by which Invaders could cross to the foot of this tower on the remaining ruins of the road, climb to where he now stood, and then descend the cable over the bridge's gap and catch the city unaware. Easy to estimate was the advantage of even this perilous route over things that scattered on the water and prevented a landing in strength. Easy to see was the need to kill Ida before she carried home this knowledge.  Roddie took the hammer from his waist.  \"Don't! Oh, don't!\" Ida screamed. She burst into tears and covered her face with scratched and bloodied hands.  Surprised, Roddie withheld the blow. He had wept, as a child, and, weeping, had for the first time learned he differed from his friends. Ida's tears disturbed him, bringing unhappy memories.  \"Why should you cry?\" he asked comfortingly. \"You know your people will come back to avenge you and will destroy my friends.\"  \"But--but my people are your people, too,\" Ida wailed. \"It's so senseless, now, after all our struggle to escape. Don't you see? Your friends are only machines, built by our ancestors. We are Men--and the city is ours, not theirs!\"  \"It _can't_ be,\" Roddie objected. \"The city surely belongs to those who are superior, and my friends are superior to your people, even to me. Each of _us_ has a purpose, though, while you Invaders seem to be aimless. Each of _us_ helps preserve the city; you only try to rob and end it by destroying it. _My_ people must be the true Men, because they're so much more rational than yours.... And it isn't rational to let you escape.\"  Ida had turned up her tear-streaked face to stare at him.  \"Rational! What's rational about murdering a defenseless girl in cold blood? Don't you realize we're the same sort of being, we two? Don't--don't you remember how we've been with each other all day?\"  She paused. Roddie noticed that her eyes were dark and frightened, yet somehow soft, over scarlet cheeks. He had to look away. But he said nothing.  \"Never mind!\" Ida said viciously. \"You can't make me beg. Go ahead and kill--see if it proves you're superior. My people will take over the city regardless of you and me, and regardless of your jumping-jack friends, too! Men can accomplish anything!\"         *       *       *       *       *  Scornfully she turned and looked toward the western twilight. It was Roddie's turn to stand and stare.  \"Purpose!\" Ida flung at him over her shoulder. \"Logic! Women hear so much of that from men! You're a man, all right! Men _always_ call it logic when they want to destroy! Loyalty to your own sort, kindness, affection--all emotional, aren't they? Not a bit logical. Emotion is for creating, and it's so much more logical to destroy, isn't it?\"  She whirled back toward him, advancing as if she wanted to sink her teeth into his throat. \"Go ahead. Get it over with--if you have the courage.\"  It was hard for Roddie to look away from that wrath-crimsoned face, but it was even harder to keep staring into the blaze of her eyes. He compromised by gazing out an opening at the gathering dusk. He thought for a long time before he decided to tuck his hammer away.  \"It isn't reasonable to kill you now,\" he said. \"Too dark. You can't possibly get down that half-ruined manway tonight, so let's see how I feel in the morning.\"  Ida began to weep again, and Roddie found it necessary to comfort her.  And by morning he knew he was a Man."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51256"],["title","The Cool War (#1)"],["body","r. We make much business.\"  \"Why not? Help retire Latin-American dictators to Siberia. More gold in Siberia than in Las Vegas.\"  \"Hyi, hyi, that is funny. You come again.\"  On his way up to the roof, Pashkov studied the invoice he had lifted. It was from a manufacturer of sporting arms to Francisco Jesus Maria Gonzales, Salvation Army Economy Lodgings. He tucked the invoice into his inner pocket with a satisfied grunt, climbed into his flier and hopped over to Hotel Reisen, where Zubov's kidnaping team was waiting for him.         *       *       *       *       *  Comrade Zubov, the kidnaping expert, was pacing the roof of Hotel Reisen. As Pashkov eased down in his flier, Zubov's big front tooth flashed with delight. Pashkov felt like tossing him a bone.  \"Everything in order, Gospodin Pashkov. Constant vigilance maintained at hospital by my two assistants. With your pardon, Comrade Petchareff urges all haste. Colonel James is due to leave the hospital tomorrow.\"  \"Comrade Petchareff always urges haste. What else?\"  Zubov's big tooth settled respectfully over his lower lip. His small eyes were so closely set that he looked cockeyed when he focused them on his superior.  \"With your pardon, I shall conduct you to our suite. Plans for kidnaping of Colonel James all ready.\"  \"Here's a cigar for you.\"  \"Gratefully accepted. Reduced unavoidable fatalities to six.\" Zubov counted on his long hard fingers. \"Two watchmen, three nurses, one doctor.\"  In the hotel corridor, Zubov looked before and after, his eyes crossed suspiciously, and peered around corners. They got to their suite without incident, and Pashkov gave him another cigar.  \"Gratefully accepted. Here is a map of hospital and grounds. Here is a map of twenty-third floor. Here is a map of Colonel James' room. Here is hospital routine between midnight and dawn. With your pardon--\"  Pashkov picked up the phone, dialed the Soviet embassy, and got the chargé d'affaires. \"How is your underdeveloped countries fund?\" he asked.  \"Always depleted, always replenished.\"  \"I don't want any Russian brands.\"  \"Nothing but foreign,\" the chargé buzzed. \"We got almost everything now through an American surplus outlet in Hamburg. Nationals get caught with American goods, Americans get blamed. Wonderful confusion. What do you need?\"  \"Thirty-o-six two-twenty, three thousand--if you have it.\"  \"Most popular. What else?\"  \"Pineapples--one crate.\"  \"Only confiscated German potatoes. Will that do?\"  \"Fine. And a small can of sentimental caviar.\"  \"Too risky.\"  \"It's all right. It will fall to local authorities by tomorrow.\"  Pashkov put down the receiver. Give the Cubans enough to expect more--make sure they stay in town.         *       *       *       *       *  Zubov was cross-checking his kidnaping plans. He said, \"With your pardon, do we take Colonel James alive or dead-or-alive?\"  \"Alive.\"  Zubov pulled a long face. \"Dead-or-alive would be easier, Gospodin Pashkov. Fast, clean job.\"  Pashkov squinted at Zubov's crossed eyes. \"Have you had your eyes examined lately?\"  \"No need,\" Zubov assured him with a smile. \"I see more than most people.\"  Pashkov held up his remaining cigar. \"How many cigars in my hand?\"  \"Two.\"  At that moment the door opened and Zubov's kidnaping team lumbered in. They were a couple of big apes dressed in blue canvas shoes, red trousers, yellow jackets, white silk scarves, sport caps and sun glasses.  \"What are you doing here?\" cried Zubov. \"Why aren't you observing the hospital?\"  \"Dhh, you said to report ... um ... if something happened,\" the first ape said in a thick voice.  \"Well?\"  \"Victim's room lights out,\" the ape said.  \"My assistants,\" Zubov introduced them to Pashkov. \"Line up, line up, lads. With your pardon, they are good lads. This is Petya, and this is Kolya. No, _this_ is Kolya and this one is Petya.\"  \"Twins?\"  \"Not exactly. Same genetic experiment. Good lads. Stand straight, Petya. Don't curl your feet like that, Kolya, I've told you before. Why didn't you shave your hands today?\"  Kolya looked guiltily at his hands.  \"They've made progress,\" Zubov assured Pashkov, pulling a small whip from his hip pocket. \"Straight, lads, straight,\" he flicked the whip. \"We have company.\"  \"Are their costumes your own idea?\"  \"With your pardon, for purposes of concealment. What are your orders?\"  Pashkov told them to pick up the boxes of ammunition at the embassy and deliver them to the Cubans, and then to commandeer a private automobile.  \"We have autos at the embassy pool,\" Zubov suggested.  \"I want a vehicle off the street. Then report back here with your lads.\"  Petya gave Kolya a box on the ear.  \"Boys, boys!\" Zubov cracked the whip. \"Out you go. A job for Gospodin Pashkov, lads. They don't get enough exercise,\" he grinned, backing out after them. \"With your pardon, I'll thrash them later.\"  And they were gone. Pashkov turned to the hospital maps and studied them before taking a nap.         *       *       *       *       *  Shortly before dawn, Zubov's team returned, their mission accomplished.  \"With your pardon, an excellent Mercedes,\" Zubov reported.  Pashkov had changed into the hospital gown with the Coca-Cola legend on the back. He glanced at his watch. It was four o'clock in the morning.  He tossed his bundle of clothing to the first ape. \"Take my flier back to Moscow, Kolya lad. Give my clothes to Nadezhda Brunhildova, and tell Comrade Petchareff to expect Colonel James today.\"  Clutching the bundle, Kolya stuck his tongue out at Petya and bounded out of the room. They waited at the window until they saw Kolya take off in Pashkov's flier. Then they made their way down the service stairs to the alley, Pashkov dressed only in the hospital gown; got into the stolen Mercedes and drove to the National Hospital, all three leaning forward.  In the ambulance court, Zubov and Petya moved quickly to a Red Cross flier. Pashkov dropped the invoice he had lifted from the Cubans on the front seat of the stolen car, and followed.  A watchman emerged from his hut, looked idly up at the rising ambulance, and shuffled back to his morning coffee.  As Petya brought the flier to a hovering stop against Colonel James' window, Pashkov bounced into the room; Zubov drew his gun and jumped in after.  Colonel James awoke, turned on the night lamp, and sat up in the bed, his eyes blinking.  Pashkov stood looking at Colonel James. The resemblance between them was remarkable. Zubov's eyes were crossed with astonishment.  \"My dear Gospodin Pashkov!\" Colonel James greeted him in Russian, yawning. \"How kind of you to visit me. Do sit down.\" Not only was his Russian good; his voice was a good imitation of Pashkov's voice.  \"You're not really sick?\" Pashkov asked, sitting down on the bed.  \"Not physically. But imagine my psychological condition. When I look in the mirror--\" The colonel shuddered.  \"I hope your sacrifice won't be permanent?\" Pashkov said.  \"That would be too much. How is my Russian? The truth, now.\"  \"Excellent. Put up your gun, Zubov. Colonel James and I don't get to talk very often.\"  \"And a pity we don't. Good manners accomplish more than an opera full of cloaks and daggers. Cigarette?\"  \"Gratefully accepted,\" Zubov said, slipping his gun into its holster with a flourish.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Your treatment is over, then?\" Pashkov asked. \"You are ready for your assignment?\"  \"Ready.\"  \"And that is?\"  \"Delicate, very delicate. I must report to the Palace this morning.\"  \"Shall I kidnap him now?\" Zubov interrupted, puffing conceitedly on his cigarette.  \"Mind your language, Zubov. May I ask, Colonel--do you want me to think I am falling into a trap?\"  \"No, no, my friend. I am only doing my best not to show my surprise at seeing you again.\" The colonel got out of bed and sat down on Pashkov's other side.  \"Zubov will make your trip to Moscow comfortable. All right, Zubov.\"  Zubov focused his crossed eyes on Pashkov.  \"Take him straight to Petchareff,\" Colonel James said to Zubov. \"I'll report as soon as I know what these Swedes are up to.\"  Zubov seized Pashkov by the scruff of the neck and dragged him towards the window.  \"Hold your claws, Zubov lad,\" Pashkov said. \"You have got the wrong man, can't you see? _That_ is Colonel James.\"  \"Eh?\"  \"Use your eyes, blockhead. _I_ am Pashkov.\"  Zubov did use his eyes. He looked from one to the other, and back. The more he focused, the more his eyes crossed. \"Eh?\"  Colonel James sat calmly on the bed. He said, \"Carry him out.\"  Zubov lifted Pashkov off the floor, crashed with his weight against the wall, but held on, grinned and staggered with Pashkov in his arms to the window.  \"You miserable idiot,\" Pashkov shouted. \"You'll get a rest cure for this!\"  Zubov dropped him, pulled his gun and backed off into a corner. \"How can I tell you two apart just by looking!\" he cried hysterically. \"I'm not a learned man.\"  \"One small but decisive proof,\" Pashkov said, unbuttoning his hospital gown. \"I have a mole.\"  Zubov yanked the colonel up by an arm. \"Send _me_ to rest cures, will you?\"  Colonel James sighed. \"I guess we have to keep up appearances,\" he muttered, and climbed out the window into the hovering ambulance. Zubov leaped in after, and they were off.         *       *       *       *       *  The suit of clothes hanging in the closet might have been Pashkov's own, identical with the clothes Kolya had taken to Moscow not an hour before. Even the underwear had facsimiles of the Order of Lenin sewn in.  Satisfied, he crawled into the bed and fell into a pleasant snooze.  He was awakened by the nurse, Anastina Bjorklund--alias Anastasia Semionovna Bezumnaya, formerly of the Stakhanovite Booster's Committee, Moscow Third Worker's District.  \"Wonderful morning, Colonel James!\"  Petchareff seldom let one agent know what another was doing.  She put a big breakfast tray on Pashkov's lap. \"Cloudy, damp, and windy. London stock market caves in, race riots in South Africa, famine in India, earthquake"]]]
