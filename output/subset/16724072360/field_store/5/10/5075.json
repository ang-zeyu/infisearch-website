Nell was his daughter!\"    III  As thought and feeling multiplied, Cameron was overwhelmed.  Beyond belief, indeed, was it that out of the millions of men in the world two who had never seen each other could have been driven into the desert by memory of the same woman.  It brought the past so close.  It showed Cameron how inevitably all his spiritual life was governed by what had happened long ago.  That which made life significant to him was a wandering in silent places where no eye could see him with his secret. Some fateful chance had thrown him with the father of the girl he had wrecked. It was incomprehensible; it was terrible.  It was the one thing of all possible happenings in the world of chance that both father and lover would have found unendurable.  Cameron's pain reached to despair when he felt this relation between Warren and himself.  Something within him cried out to him to reveal his identity.  Warren would kill him; but it was not fear of death that put Cameron on the rack.  He had faced death too often to be afraid. It was the thought of adding torture to this long-suffering man.  All at once Cameron swore that he would not augment Warren's trouble, or let him stain his hands with blood.  He would tell the truth of Nell's sad story and his own, and make what amends he could.  Then Cameron's thought shifted from father to daughter.  She was somewhere beyond the dim horizon line.  In those past lonely hours by the campfire his fancy had tortured him with pictures of Nell. But his remorseful and cruel fancy had lied to him.  Nell had struggled upward out of menacing depths.  She had reconstructed a broken life.  And now she was fighting for the name and happiness of her child.  Little Nell! Cameron experienced a shuddering ripple in all his being--the physical rack of an emotion born of a new and strange consciousness.  As Cameron gazed out over the blood-red, darkening desert suddenly the strife in his soul ceased.  The moment was one of incalculable change, in which his eyes seemed to pierce the vastness of cloud and range, and mystery of gloom and shadow--to see with strong vision the illimitable space before him.  He felt the grandeur of the desert, its simplicity, its truth.  He had learned at last the lesson it taught.  No longer strange was his meeting and wandering with Warren. Each had marched in the steps of destiny; and as the lines of their fates had been inextricably tangled in the years that were gone, so now their steps had crossed and turned them toward one common goal.  For years they had been two men marching alone, answering to an inward driving search, and the desert had brought them together. For years they had wandered alone in silence and solitude, where the sun burned white all day and the stars burned white all night, blindly following the whisper of a spirit.  But now Cameron knew that he was no longer blind, and in this flash of revelation he felt that it had been given him to help Warren with his burden.  He returned to camp trying to evolve a plan.  As always at that long hour when the afterglow of sunset lingered in the west, Warren plodded to and fro in the gloom.  All night Cameron lay awake thinking.  In the morning, when Warren brought the burros to camp and began preparations for the usual packing, Cameron broke silence.  \"Pardner, your story last night made me think.  I want to tell you something about myself.  It's hard enough to be driven by sorrow for one you've loved, as you've been driven; but to suffer sleepless and eternal remorse for the ruin of one you've loved as I have suffered--that is hell....  Listen.  In my younger days--it seems long now, yet it's not so many years--I was wild.  I wronged the sweetest and loveliest girl I ever knew.  I went away not dreaming that any disgrace might come to her.  Along about that time I fell into terrible moods--I changed--I learned I really loved her.  Then came a letter I should have gotten months before.  It told of her trouble--importuned me to hurry to save her.  Half frantic with shame and fear, I got a marriage certificate and rushed back to her town. She was gone--had been gone for weeks, and her disgrace was known. Friends warned me to keep out of reach of her father.  I trailed her--found her.  I married her.  But too late!... She would not live with me. She left me--I followed her west, but never found her.\"  Warren leaned forward a little and looked into Cameron's eyes, as if searching there for the repentance that might make him less deserving of a man's scorn.  Cameron met the gaze unflinchingly, and again began to speak:  \"You know, of course, how men out here somehow lose old names, old identities.  It won't surprise you much to learn my name really isn't Cameron, as I once told you.\"  Warren stiffened upright.  It seemed that there might have been a blank, a suspension, between his grave interest and some strange mood to come.  Cameron felt his heart bulge and contract in his breast; all his body grew cold; and it took tremendous effort for him to make his lips form words.  \"Warren, I'm the man you're hunting.  I'm Burton.  I was Nell's lover!\"  The old man rose and towered over Cameron, and then plunged down upon him, and clutched at his throat with terrible stifling hands. The harsh contact, the pain awakened Cameron to his peril before it was too late. Desperate fighting saved him from being hurled to the ground and stamped and crushed.  Warren seemed a maddened giant.  There was a reeling, swaying, wrestling struggle before the elder man began to weaken.  The Cameron, buffeted, bloody, half-stunned, panted for speech.  \"Warren--hold on!  Give me--a minute.  I married Nell.  Didn't you know that?... I saved the child!\"  Cameron felt the shock that vibrated through Warren.  He repeated the words again and again.  As if compelled by some resistless power, Warren released Cameron, and, staggering back, stood with uplifted, shaking hands.  In his face was a horrible darkness.  \"Warren!  Wait--listen!\" panted Cameron.  \"I've got that marriage certificate--I've had it by me all these years.  I kept it--to prove to myself I did right.\"  The old man uttered a broken cry.  Cameron stole off among the rocks.  How long he absented himself or what he did he had no idea.  When he returned Warren was sitting before the campfire, and once more he appeared composed.  He spoke, and his voice had a deeper note; but otherwise he seemed as usual.  They packed the burros and faced the north together.  Cameron experienced a singular exaltation.  He had lightened his comrade's burden.  Wonderfully it came to him that he had also lightened his own.  From that hour it was not torment to think of Nell. Walking with his comrade through the silent places, lying beside him under the serene luminous light of the stars, Cameron began to feel the haunting presence of invisible things that were real to him--phantoms whispering peace.  In the moan of the cool wind, in the silken seep of sifting sand, in the distant rumble of a slipping ledge, in the faint rush of a shooting star he heard these phantoms of peace coming with whispers of the long pain of men at the last made endurable.  Even in the white noonday, under the burning sun, these phantoms came to be real to him. In the dead silence of the midnight hours he heard them breathing nearer on the desert wind--nature's voices of motherhood, whispers of God, peace in the solitude.    IV  There came a morning when the sun shone angry and red through a dull, smoky haze.  \"We're in for sandstorms,\" said Cameron.  They had scarcely covered a mile when a desert-wide, moaning, yellow wall of flying sand swooped down upon them.  Seeking shelter in the lee of a rock, they waited, hoping the storm was only a squall, such as frequently whipped across the open places.  The moan increased to a roar, and the dull red slowly dimmed, to disappear in the yellow pall, and the air grew thick and dark.  Warren slipped the packs from the burros.  Cameron feared the sandstorms had arrived some weeks ahead of their usual season.  The men covered their heads and patiently waited.  The long hours dragged, and the storm increased in fury.  Cameron and Warren wet scarfs with water from their canteens, and bound them round their faces, and then covered their heads.  The steady, hollow bellow of flying sand went on.  It flew so thickly that enough sifted down under the shelving rock to weight the blankets and almost bury the men.  They were frequently compelled to shake off the sand to keep from being borne to the ground.  And it was necessary to keep digging out the packs.  The floor of their shelter gradually rose higher and higher. They tried to eat, and seemed to be grinding only sand between their teeth.  They lost the count of time. They dared not sleep, for that would have meant being buried alive. The could only crouch close to the leaning rock, shake off the sand, blindly dig out their packs, and every moment gasp and cough and choke to fight suffocation.  The storm finally blew itself out.  It left the prospectors heavy and stupid for want of sleep.  Their burros had wandered away, or had been buried in the sand.  Far as eye could reach the desert had marvelously changed; it was now a rippling sea of sand dunes. Away to the north rose the peak that was their only guiding mark. They headed toward it, carrying a shovel and part of their packs.  At noon the peak vanished in the shimmering glare of the desert. The prospectors pushed on, guided by the sun.  In every wash they tried for water.  With the forked peach branch in his hands Warren always succeeded in locating water.  They dug, but it lay too deep.  At length, spent and sore, they fell and slept through that night and part of the next day.  Then they succeeded in getting water, and quenched their thirst, and filled the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50217"],["title","Dave Dawson with the Pacific Fleet (#1)"],["body","ll, I don't mean anything against America, Dave. And I'm certainly willing and anxious to go wherever I'm ordered. But--well, you've got oodles and oodles of pukka pilots over here. Why should we be sent over here to instruct? After the Singapore business, why were we recalled to England and then sent out here? Why not to some other Front? Russia, or Libya, or right where we were in the Far East?\"[1]  [Footnote 1: _Dave Dawson At Singapore._]  \"_Instruct?_\" Dave echoed sharply, and gave his pal a keen look. \"What do you mean, instruct? Were you told something I wasn't told? Holy tripe! If they make a darned instructor out of me, I'll wreck every ship until they realize I'm no good at that sort of thing. Instruct? Why, doggone it, I--\"  \"I say, don't go sailing off your topper!\" Freddy cried in alarm. \"Nobody told me anything. I simply said instruct, because I'm blessed if I can think of any other reason why the Air Ministry should send us over here.\"  \"Instruct!\" Dave groaned and made a face. \"Gosh! Have you spoiled my homecoming by bringing that up. But, heck, Freddy! You must be all wet on that idea. Why ship us halfway around the world to teach Yank fledglings how to fly? That doesn't make sense. Why not at least send us straight to Canada?\"  Freddy Farmer pursed his lips and looked thoughtful. But there was a very impish look in his eyes that Dave missed completely.  \"Well, of course you're very famous,\" Farmer murmured. \"You have quite a record for bringing down Nazi planes. British ones, too. Crashes, and rotten landings, you know. Come to think of it, perhaps it's because of those crashes.\"  \"Crashes!\" Dawson cried as his eyes flashed. \"Listen, you little wing crumpler! For every crate I've busted up, you've--\"  \"No doubt Churchill got in touch with your President,\" the English youth went on as though he hadn't been interrupted. \"They often talk with each other by trans-oceanic phone, I understand. Perhaps right after Pearl Harbor, Churchill called up and said, 'I say, Mr. President! That chap, Dave Dawson--he's one of you Yanks, you know.' And your President said, 'Oh, yes, Dawson. Has that blighter crashed again, Mr. Prime Minister?' To which Churchill replied, 'Can't say, Mr. President. Haven't looked over the R.A.F. flight reports for the day yet. It's quite likely, though. But what I called about, Mr. President: Now that you're in this war, do you think you could take the little beggar off our hands? Our aircraft production is on the rise, but--'\"  Freddy Farmer cut off the last as he suddenly realized that he was only talking to the Clipper's window. He swung around on his heel, gulped, and blushed to the roots of his hair. Dave Dawson and some dozen other passengers of the Clipper were standing there in a group smiling at him.  \"It's the altitude, ladies and gentlemen,\" Dave said loudly. \"On the ground he's really quite a nice guy. But go on, Freddy. I didn't mean to interrupt. Sorry.\"  His whole face on fire, Freddy Farmer took a step forward, fists bunched. Then he quickly relaxed, and grinned.  \"Fancy I asked for it,\" he said. Then, with a grave bow at the other passengers, he added, \"It's undoubtedly the truth, though. He has crashed more than any other pilot in the R.A.F. Just look at his face. Nothing but countless crashes could make it look like that. I ask you!\"  \"Okay, that evens up!\" Dave cried, as everybody joined in the laugh. \"But you sounded as if you were set for hours.\"  At that moment the steward came into the lounge and requested the passengers to take their seats while the landing was being made. As Dave dropped into his seat next to Freddy, a tingle of excitement quivered through his body, and his heart started whanging around in his chest like a broken piston rod. Back home! Back home to the good old U.S.A. He still could hardly believe that it was true. It was more like living out a dream--a wonderful, joy-filled dream. He was afraid that almost any second he would wake up and find himself back in his hut at some Royal Air Force Fighter Squadron in England, or Egypt, or India, or the Far East.  \"But it's not a dream, it's true!\" he heard his own voice mutter softly. \"And that's just _why_ it doesn't make sense! Why _should_ it be true? Why _did_ the Air Ministry send Freddy and me over here?\"     CHAPTER TWO  _Center Of The World_   As the giant Pan-American Clipper went sliding down toward the landing basin off LaGuardia Field, that question sounded again and again in Dave's brain like a tolling bell. But each time he could think of no answer that seemed reasonable or logical. And each time he groped for the answer, he mentally kicked himself for not having taken the bull by the horns and found out a few things when he had the chance.  That chance had come just a few days ago; two days after he and Freddy had returned from their special assignment in the Singapore area of the war. They hadn't been appointed to any squadron upon their arrival in London. Fact was, they had been given a week's leave to enjoy themselves in the war-torn but still very much chin-up city. They did have fun for two days. Then came the order to report to a certain room at the Air Ministry. It turned out to be the office of Air Vice-Marshal Stoneham, in charge of Active Service Personnel.  For the first few minutes the high ranking Air Ministry official had inquired about their health, how they liked being back in London, and a lot of other things that were of equal \"value\" in waging a winning war. Then suddenly he had informed them that they were leaving the next day for the United States. It was with great difficulty that they kept from toppling right out of their chairs. And while each struggled to catch his breath and gain control of his tongue, the Air Vice-Marshal had gone on to say that they would fly to Lisbon by British Airways, and from Lisbon to New York by Pan-American Clipper. Upon arriving at New York they would be met by a member of the British Embassy at Washington who would escort them to the Nation's Capital.  \"So there you are, Flight Lieutenants,\" the Air Vice-Marshal had finished up with a smile while they still tried to get their feet back on the ground. \"You can pick up traveling vouchers and what-not on the way out. Good luck, and happy landings, and all that sort of thing. Certainly wish I were going along with you. Wonderful country, America. Of course it isn't England, but it's still quite all right, no end.\"  Perhaps fifteen seconds after that, Dave and Freddy found themselves accepting travel vouchers and other papers from a junior officer. And another couple of minutes after that they found themselves out on the street and headed back toward their hotel. Gosh, yes! He should have asked a few questions of that Air Vice-Marshal when he had the chance. But that had been the trouble. He hadn't had the chance. Things had happened with such startling suddenness and rapidity that--well, _bingo_, he and Freddy were on the Clipper flying west.  \"I wish I hadn't even said it!\"  Dave snapped out of his old thought trance and glanced at Freddy Farmer.  \"Wish you hadn't said what?\" he demanded.  The English youth sighed, made a face, and gestured with one hand.  \"That bit about us coming over here to instruct American fledglings,\" he said. \"The more I think of it, the more I'm afraid that it just might be true. That would be terrible, Dave. Not that I don't want to do everything possible to help, you understand. But instruct? I'd be perfectly rotten at that game. I'm sure of it!\"  \"Me too!\" Dawson groaned as his heart started sinking again. \"And it would just be my luck to get some student who didn't know a flat spin from a three dollar hat. But I'm sure it can't be that. Heck! Let's look at the bright side. Maybe they've sent us over here to take charge of American war flying.\"  \"Hardly!\" Freddy said with a chuckle. \"After all, the United Nations really are very keen to _win_ the war, you know. And with you--\"  \"Skip it!\" Dave cut in. \"I was only trying to make conversation.\"  \"Don't bother,\" Freddy murmured, and looked out the window. \"It's quite interesting enough to watch one of these big ladies come down and land. Phew! That LaGuardia Field is certainly a big place, isn't it?\"  \"Fair, just fair,\" Dave grunted. \"It's really just one of our emergency fields, you know. Why, we've got airports over here that are so big that they serve breakfast at the start of the take-off and lunch when the transport passes over the far end of the field. And--\"  \"And glide from there to a landing on the next airport, eh?\" Freddy Farmer grunted.  \"You're learning too fast,\" Dave said with a grin. \"I wonder who'll meet us.\"  \"_I_ wonder if he'll be able to tell us anything!\" Freddy added. \"For two pennies I'd refuse to budge an inch until I'm told what this is all about.\"  \"Do that and you'll _be told_!\" Dave said with a chuckle. \"But not the way you think, sweetheart. Ah, nice! A sweet landing, that one. These Clipper captains sure know their onions when it comes to over-water flying. Well, there's the dock, and customs shed. And I wonder who in that crowd is our welcoming committee. Gee! I hope we can spend a little while in New York so I can show you off to the natives.\"  \"Never mind the natives,\" Freddy said as the huge Clipper was mushed through the water toward the landing dock. \"I'll be perfectly content to see the sights.\"  \"And I'm just the guy who can show them to you,\" Dave said. \"Right from the Battery up to the Bronx Zoo. No. Nix on the Bronx Zoo. Can't take chances.\"  \"Chances on what?\" Freddy said as he walked into it with both eyes shut.  \"The chances of coming out with the wrong baboon,\" Dave replied instantly.  Freddy Farmer swung but missed by a mile. Dave had caught up his bag and was out of his seat and heading forward. Five minutes later they had cleared customs and were standing on American soil. They stood there for a minute wondering if the party who was supposed to meet"]]]
