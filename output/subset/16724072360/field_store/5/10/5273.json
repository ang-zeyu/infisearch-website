That is your own angle, isn't it?\"  I nodded. Indeed it was, and it had been expressed in precisely the same words that I had used in speaking to Chief Weston.  \"However,\" he went on blandly, \"you'll agree that a clue is usually the result of a mistake, or failure to plan completely, or the result of some accidental circumstance.\"  \"Right.\"  \"But in a 'perfect crime' there would be no error, no mistake.\"  \"Yes, but aren't you backing yourself into a hole that you've lined with fish hooks yourself?\"  \"Not at all,\" he replied. \"Clues must be cleverly contrived, created, and established in such a way that the episode is ultimately known to be crime and not labeled misadventure, suicide, or the like. Otherwise,\" he said with a genial smile, \"we're writing about a 'perfectly justifiable homicide' instead of a 'perfect crime.'\"  I nodded again.  \"And, of course,\" he finished, \"these clues must also provide precisely the correct amount of information so that the motive of the criminal is not only fulfilled, but exposed--if not to one of the characters in the book, at least to the reader.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Mr. Wood relaxed and sipped his own drink. From somewhere aloft, a number of individually insignificant traces added up to fairly reliable evidence that Florence and Mrs. Wood were about to return. I gathered that the cross-questioning had allayed any parental suspicion.  I said, \"One thing you haven't mentioned,\" and paused for effect. \"To the Hindu, 'perfection' means the inclusion of an almost imperceptible flaw so that its maker cannot be accused of presuming to be as good as God. Is your 'perfect crime' to be perfect in the eyes of the criminal, or in the eyes of the police?\"  He said, \"Ah, Captain Schnell, that is indeed one of my bothersome problems.\"  Mrs. Wood came into the room, followed by Florence. The girl had lost the soaked-gamin look. She was transformed by modern alchemy into a poised young woman who forced me to revise my estimated eighteen several years upward. She nodded affably at her father, smiled at me and then came over because she noticed that my highball glass was empty.  I thanked her, and she smiled wide and bright as she asked, \"Has Daddy been giving you the details of his impossible bandit?\"  \"Well, in a way.\"  Mr. Wood said, \"I'm sort of like the standard television father--incapable of adding two and two without the close supervision of the female members of my family.\"  \"I--that is, we--keep telling Daddy he should hire Superman for a hero.\"  \"You've changed,\" chuckled Mr. Wood.  \"Changed?\"  \"Yesterday you advocated that I hire a detective with telepathy and a sense of perception.\"  \"We discussed it on the way home,\" said Florence.  \"Superman?\" I asked.  \"No, this extra-sensory business,\" said Florence.  Mr. Wood inquired, \"Are you interested in parapsychology, Captain Schnell?\"  \"I've been interested in the subject for a good many years,\" I answered.  \"Would the public accept it, I wonder,\" he mused.  Mrs. Wood said, \"A lot of people read psychic books.\"  Mr. Wood said plaintively, \"I don't want to write psychic books. I want to write whodunits. But it would solve my problem, wouldn't it? My series would consist of crimes that would be perfect, except for the introduction of a Master of Psionics who tells the story in the first person singular, and who solves the crime by parapsychic power.\"  \"It might read better if you made your extra-sensory character the criminal,\" I suggested.  He shook his head. \"Wouldn't do at all. A criminal with extra-sensory talent would always win out over the police. There have been only a very few successful stories written in which the criminal got away.\"  \"Maybe he wouldn't,\" I said.  \"But how could he possibly fail?\"  \"He might get sloppy.\"  \"Sloppy! Mind reading every anticipated move?\"  \"Or bored.\"  \"Bored!\"  \"One often leads to the other,\" I told him with a smile. \"Which is just my policeman's way of thinking. From the policeman's point of view, you're overlooking one rather important angle.\"  \"Indeed? Well, you must tell me all about it.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"Okay,\" I said. \"My point is that you should not view this as a single incident in the life of an extra-sensory who has turned his talent to crime, but rather take the overall view. For instance, we can write the life history of our Psi-man in broad terms. As a schoolboy, he was considered extraordinarily lucky at games of chance and skilled in games of manual dexterity; he stood high in schoolwork and at the same time managed to do it without working very hard. By the time he enters high school, he realizes that his success is due to some sort of 'sensing' of when things will be right. This increases the efficiency of his talent and he surges forward and would have become top-of-class if he hadn't discovered that brilliance in recitation made up for a lack of handed-in homework.  \"In other words, nothing stands as a real challenge to him. His talents surmount the obstacles that confront his fellow man. He could collect corporations or be a labor leader, President or bum. Anything he wants can be gotten without much fuss. Our Psi-man is primarily interested in a statistical income sufficient to support him to the dictates of his ambition. The trick is to achieve, say, twenty grand per annum, in such a way that the manipulation is never discovered.  \"At first our Psi-man plans meticulously. But soon this process seems unnecessary because the poor ignorant homo saps don't even know they're being conned. He has no hard surface against which to whet his nervous edge, and so he begins to play games. He leaves clues, at first to ascertain the true level of his fellow man's intelligence and ability. Next he leaves conflicting clues to see which way the poor dopes will jump. In a world that scoffs at parapsychic phenomena, he leaves clues to support the theory that only an extra-sensory criminal could have done the dastardly deed. Will one of the ignorant apes recognize the truth? If he does, will he be in a high position, or will he be one of the diligent ones who fetch coffee for the guy in the upper office? If the work of a Psi-man is recognized, how will our bright policeman go about it, and what will he do with the evidence after it's been shown to him?  \"And so, Mr. Wood, our Psi-man criminal has become bored because there is no one in the world to challenge him, and he gets sloppy through his growing contempt for the antlike activities of his fellow creatures. At last he shows himself, deliberately taunting them to take action against him. And that,\" I concluded, with a nod at him, \"might be the 'perfect crime' in which your extra-sensory criminal finally exposes himself.\"  \"But why,\" Mrs. Wood asked in perplexity, \"would such a talented person turn to crime--or do you think that all extra-sensory people--\"  I turned to smile at her. \"Mrs. Wood, I was not speaking of extra-sensory people as a statistical body. I was referring to one particular character.\"  \"I find him hard to believe in.\"  \"On the contrary, my dear,\" said Mr. Wood, \"Captain Schnell has drawn an amazingly accurate thumbnail sketch of our Psi-man, and I daresay that he could go on and on, filling in more minute details.\"  \"Oh, yes, indeed,\" I said. \"But I must leave it up to the professional writer to tell what the brilliant policeman does when he recognizes the work as that of an extra-sensory. For instance, does he become bold enough to mention it to Chief Weston, or to Commissioner Stone? Or will he confine his discussion to the company of a rain-soaked young woman so circumstantially available and coincidentally willing to discuss Psionics?\"  \"Captain Schnell,\" breathed Florence Wood, \"what on Earth are you talking about?\"  \"Your father,\" I said.  Mr. Wood stepped into the breach. \"Captain Schnell was dramatizing for your benefit, I'm sure. Because Captain Schnell knows very well how impossible it is to surprise a telepath into revealing himself.\"  Florence Wood's expression changed to a mildly bothered smile. \"It certainly sounded as if he were accusing you of something.\"  \"You mean--like--_mind reading_?\" he asked with a big belly laugh that closed the subject.   IV  By most of the rules of society, both Mr. Wood and I were guilty of gross gentility. He greeted me overtly as the welcome guest and needled me with a show of patronizing tolerance as he implied that my basic interest was in Florence.  To match him, I accepted his hospitality and made use of the proximity to spy on him and his family.  There are ways and means of making a pretended deaf-mute reveal himself--the human being does not live who will not leap halfway out of his skin at the shock of an unexpected revolver shot, no matter how well trained he is at feigning deafness.  As for surprising a telepath, I knew it wouldn't work, but I had to try it anyway. I put both Mrs. Wood and Florence through a number of mental hurdles. To this, Mr. Wood took a quietly tolerant attitude. He understood and was prepared to accept as healthily normal a certain amount of lust and carnal conjecture in the minds of males who were interested in his daughter. He forgave me for mentally insulting his wife because he knew that my mental peregrinations were only aimed at determining whether his wife was telepathic. Finally he came out flatly and told me to stop wasting my effort, because neither Florence nor Mrs. Wood had a trace of extra-sensory power. Their lack of shocked or outraged response was not a case of the well-trained telepath divining my intention and planning a blank response."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51822"],["title","Arcturus Times Three (#1)"],["body"," no comment on what sort of animal it _might_ be could be half so informative as actually _being_ what it was.  Jerry repressed an urge to fidget. This was almost the worst part of Contact: The wait, while the senseless briefing took place. Soon enough he would know more of the species under observation than could be held on ten reams of briefing-sheets. Soon enough he would be sent, for an irreducible forty minutes, into the mind of each of the creatures to be learned.  The irreducible time-extent of Contact was its primary hazard. When the Contact helmet had been developed, it had been found that approximately forty minutes--forty-point-oh-three minutes, to be exact--had to be spent in the creature's mind. No amount of redesigning, fiddling or tinkering could change that time. The Zoologist could spend neither more nor less than that amount in a creature's mind.  Since all creatures have natural enemies, Contact called for more than simply curling up and relaxing inside the alien mind. The zoologist's host-alien might have a metabolism which called for it to drink a pint of water every fifteen minutes or shrivel. In which case the zoologist would shrivel with it, his punishment for not sufficiently Learning his host.  This, then, was the reason those irreducible forty minutes were a hazard. Should the creature being Contacted die, the zoologist died with it. There was no avoiding death if it came to the inhabited creature. A good zoologist Learned fast, or perished. Which is why there is no such thing as a bad Space Zoologist. You're either a good one or a dead one.  Peters' voice came to a halt and he closed the plastic folder over the briefing-sheet.  \"That's about the size of it, sir,\" he said. \"We've focused the Contact-beams toward the indicated areas and made a final check of all the wiring, tubes and power-sources.\"  Jerry sighed contentedly and shut his eyes.  \"Whenever you're ready, then, Captain,\" he whispered, and relaxed his body in preparation for his first Contact. His mind and imagination toyed a moment with brief fancies about his forthcoming existences in swamp, desert and sea, then he pushed the thoughts away and let his mind go empty.  Faintly, he heard Peters calling an order to the technician within the spaceship--  Then silent lightning flashed across his consciousness.   II  He opened his eyes. Six eyes. In two rows of three eyes each.  He did not, however, see six images. The widespread belief in the multitudinous images seen by the faceted eyes of a housefly had been debunked the first time a helmeted biochemist had intruded upon that insect's puny brain. As with human eyes, the images were fused into a whole when they reached the mind. Save for the disconcerting sensation of possessing a horizontal and vertical peripheral vision of approximately three hundred degrees sight was comfortably normal.  Jerry looked over his surroundings and noted one slightly annoying side-effect of his hexafocal outlook. As a human will see--as when looking at the tip of a pencil pointed at the face--two images at the far end of any object looked upon, so Jerry, while able to zero in anywhere he chose, could see six ghost-images corresponding in their angle of perspective to the positions of his six eyes. Had he a pencil-tip to stare at, it would have appeared, beyond the tip, to be vaguely like a badminton bird seen head on, with images of the pencil-body comprising the \"feathers.\"  A few moments of glancing about soon took care of the primary irritation of this unfamiliar sensation, and Jerry began to study his surroundings carefully.  He was inside a circular cavity of some sort, facing toward brightness at the opening ahead of him. The walls of the cavity were dark, sandy-smooth and slightly moist, so he reasoned he was in some sort of burrow in the soil. Beyond the opening, there was light and warmth and a hint of greenery which his host's eyes could not bring into sharp focus.  \"I wish I knew my size,\" he thought. \"Am I some small insect awaiting a victim, or a rabbit-souled mammal hiding from a predator, or a lion-sized carnivore sleeping off a heavy meal?\"  Attempts to turn his head for a look at his host's body availed him nothing. Jerry relaxed for a moment, and tried to sense his body by _feel_. He had, he knew in a moment, no neck. Head and torso were a one-piece unit, or at least inflexibly joined.  Carefully, Jerry moved his right \"hand\" out before his face for a look. He saw a thin, flesh-covered bony limb, with a double \"elbow,\" terminating in a semicircular pad which seemed suited for nothing but support. No claw, talon or digit on the pad; just a tesselated rubbery bottom, the tesselations apparently acting as treads do on a tire.  \"Whatever I am,\" Jerry sighed, \"I'm non-skid.\" He considered a moment, then added, \"I can't be an insect, then. Insects can't rely on weight to keep them rightside up, and need gripping mechanisms. Okay, insect-size is out.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Jerry extended the pad before him and cautiously leaned his weight on it, then removed it back beneath his torso and studied the earth where it had rested. There was a concavity there, corresponding to the pad. It was not especially deep.  \"Well, that lets out elephant-size,\" he reasoned, \"and most oversize forms. I must be somewhere between a mouse and a middle-sized wolf. But _what_ am I?\"  Jerry tried breathing. Nothing happened; there was no sense of dilation anywhere in his body. \"Odd,\" he thought. \"Unless I get oxygen--or whatever gases this creature breathes--through my food.... Or maybe I have air-tubes like an insect's.... No, I'd have to shift my body now and then for air circulation, and I feel no discomfort remaining still. Besides, I have flesh, and that tube arrangement only functions well in a body with an endoskeleton. Must be dependent on food intake, then. Stores its oxygen or whatever.\"  He extended the tesselated pad, and rubbed it cautiously against the soil. There was a dim sensation of touch in the pad. But it was subordinate to a soma-centric sense of location. His pad \"knew\" where it was in relation to his body, but had no great tactile capacity for his surroundings. \"Well,\" Jerry thought, \"that lets out _feeling_ my body to determine shape or function.\"  As it sometimes did when he was enhosted, his mind went back to old Peters, his instructor, who had taught \"Project C\" to the eager young zoologists. Project Contact had been mostly devoted to giving the student an open mind on metabolism and adaptability to environment. A Learner had to be able to reason out--and quickly--the metabolism of his host. It was little use knowing a Terran life-ecology; man lives on combustibles and oxygen, the oxygen combining with combustibles to provide heat, and plants live on carbon dioxide and water and sunlight, renewing the atmospheric oxygen. So old Peters had always stressed the student's learning their Basic Combinations.  Basic Combinations prepared the student--or so the school board hoped--for a wide variety of chemical relationships between a host and its environment. The students had to know what to do to survive should the host, for instance, live in a chlorine atmosphere, and need large amounts of antimony in its diet for proper combustion and survival. There were a good many chemical elements in the universe; the student had to know how to deal with any combination of them in a host's metabolism.  For the most part, the instincts of the host would carry a Learner through the Contact period. A species tended to keep its physical needs not only in its mind, but in its body as well. Mr. Peters had a saying he'd been fond of emphasizing to the students: \"When in doubt, black out.\" The saying became a cliche to the student body, but they had the sense not to disregard it. A cliche is, after all, only a truth which has become trite because it is vitally necessary to use it often.  \"When in doubt, black out,\" meant simply that if a situation arose which seemed impossible to handle rationally, the enhosted Learner's last resort was reliance upon the instinctive behavior of the host. The only thing to be done was to pull the mind into a tiny knot bobbing in the host's own brain, and let the host itself, once more in control, take the Learner instinctively to environmental victory. Or defeat.         *       *       *       *       *  There were dangers, of course. A Learner enhosted in a chicken, for instance, would be a fool to trust the chicken's instincts regarding, say, a snake. A chicken confronted by a snake tends to become hypnotized by its deadly adversary, and to stand stupidly in place until it is killed. In cases of that sort, the Learner would be safer taking control and going clucking off to the nearest high ground.  On the other hand, a Learner inhabiting something with the hairtrigger instincts of a bat would be much better off letting the animal's instincts take over in moments of grave risk, such as flying through the blades of a revolving fan. A bat could get through without a second thought about those whirling metal scythes, but a man's mind could not think fast enough to avoid a grim death by all-over amputation.  \"Maybe,\" Jerry thought hopefully, \"I've got an _easy_ one.\" It was possible, of course. His host might be in the midst of an afternoon siesta, and Jerry could relax and \"sit out\" his forty minutes of Contact. But such cases were few. At any moment a predator might come down into that orifice in the soil, and Jerry would have to fight for his host's life to preserve his own. Relaxed Learning was seldom feasible.  \"I'd better see what sort of fighting equipment I have,\" he decided, wishing vainly that he could just turn his head and look his body over. This proceeding by _feel_ was a slow, tortuous, and sometimes deceptive process. Hollow fangs that seemed capable of injecting venom into an enemy might--as in the case of the Venusian Sea Vampires--turn"]]]
