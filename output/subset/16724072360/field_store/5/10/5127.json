'_... dreams, in their vivid coloring of life, as in that fleeting, shadowy, misty strife of semblance with reality which brings to the delirious eye more lovely things of paradise and love--and all our own!--than young Hope in his sunniest hour hath known...._'  So sometimes he read poetry, but even that was hardly equal to the dreams.  And then he would wake up and listen to Terrence's voice. He would look out the window over the barren frigid land where there was nothing but seams of worn land, like scabs under the brazen sky.  \"If I had a choice,\" he thought, \"I wouldn't ever wake up at all again. The dreams may not be more real, but they're preferable.\"  Dreams were supposed to be wishful thinking, primarily, but he couldn't live in them very long. His body would dry up and he would die. He had to stay awake enough to put a little energy back into himself. Of course, if he died and lost the dreams, there would be one compensation--he would also be free of Terrence and the rest of them who had learned that the only value in life lay in killing one's way across the Cosmos.  But then he had a feeling Terrence's voice wouldn't be annoying him much more anyway. The voice was unreal, coming out of some void. He could switch off Terrence any time now, but he was still curious.  \"Bruce--Bruce, you still there? Listen, we're up here at what we figure to be five hundred thousand feet! It _is_ impossible. We keep climbing and now we look up and we can see up and up and there the mountain is going up and up--\"  And some time later: \"Bruce, Marsha's dying! We don't know what's the matter. We can't find any reason for it. She's lying here and she keeps laughing and calling your name. She's a woman, so that's probably it. Women don't have real guts.\"  Bruce bent toward the radio. Outside the shelter, the wind whistled softly at the door.  \"Marsha,\" he said.  \"Bruce--\"  She hadn't said his name that way for a long time.  \"Marsha, remember how we used to talk about human values? I remember how you seemed to have something maybe different from the others. I never thought you'd really buy this will to conquer, and now it doesn't matter....\"  He listened to her voice, first the crazy laughter, and then a whisper. \"Bruce, hello down there.\" Her voice was all mixed up with fear and hysteria and mockery. \"Bruce darling, are you lonely down there? I wish I were with you, safe ... free ... warm. I love you. Do you hear that? I really love you, after all. After all....\"  Her voice drifted away, came back to him. \"We're climbing the highest mountain. What are you doing there, relaxing where it's peaceful and warm and sane? You always were such a calm guy. I remember now. What are you doing--reading poetry while we climb the mountain? What was that, Bruce--that one about the mountain you tried to quote to me last night before you ... I can't remember it now. Darling, what...?\"         *       *       *       *       *  He stared at the radio. He hesitated, reached out and switched on the mike. He got through to her.  \"Hello, hello, darling,\" he whispered. \"Marsha, can you hear me?\"  \"Yes, yes. You down there, all warm and cozy, reading poetry, darling. Where you can see both ways instead of just up and down, up and down.\"  He tried to imagine where she was now as he spoke to her, how she looked. He thought of Earth and how it had been there, years ago, with Marsha. Things had seemed so different then. There was something of that hope in his voice now as he spoke to her, yet not directly to her, as he looked out the window at the naked frigid sky and the barren rocks.      \"'... and there is nowhere to go from the top of a mountain,       But down, my dear;     And the springs that flow on the floor of the valley       Will never seem fresh or clear     For thinking of the glitter of the mountain water       In the feathery green of the year....'\"  The wind stormed over the shelter in a burst of power, buried the sound of his own voice.  \"Marsha, are you still there?\"  \"What the devil's the idea, poetry at a time like this, or any time?\" Terrence demanded. \"Listen, you taking this down? We haven't run into any signs of the others. Six hundred thousand feet, Bruce! We feel our destiny. We conquer the Solar System. And we'll go out and out, and we'll climb the highest mountain, the highest mountain anywhere. We're going up and up. We've voted on it. Unanimous. We go on. On to the top, Bruce! Nothing can stop us. If it takes ten years, a hundred, a thousand years, we'll find it. We'll find the top! Not the top of this world--the top of _everything_. The top of the UNIVERSE!\"  Later, Terrence's voice broke off in the middle of something or other--Bruce couldn't make any sense out of it at all--and turned into crazy yells that faded out and never came back.  Bruce figured the others might still be climbing somewhere, or maybe they were dead. Either way it wouldn't make any difference to him. He knew they would never come back down.  He was switching off the radio for good when he saw the coloration break over the window. It was the same as the dream, but for an instant, dream and reality seemed fused like two superimposed film negatives.  He went to the window and looked out. The comfortable little city was out there, and the canal flowing past through a pleasantly cool yet sunny afternoon. Purple mist blanketed the knees of low hills and there was a valley, green and rich with the trees high and full beside the softly flowing canal water.  The filmy shapes that seemed alive, that were partly translucent, drifted along the water's edge, and birds as delicate as colored glass wavered down the wind.  He opened the shelter door and went out. The shelter looked the same, but useless now. How did the shelter of that bleak world get into this one, where the air was warm and fragrant, where there was no cold, from that world into this one of his dreams?  The girl--Helene--was standing there leaning against a tree, smoking a cigarette.  He walked toward her, and stopped. In the dream it had been easy, but now he was embarrassed, in spite of the intimacy that had grown between them. She wore the same casual slacks and sandals. Her hair was brown. She was not particularly beautiful, but she was comfortable to look at because she seemed so peaceful. Content, happy with what was and only what was.  He turned quickly. The shelter was still there, and behind it the row of spaceships--not like chalk marks on a tallyboard now, but like odd relics that didn't belong there in the thick green grass. Five ships instead of four.  There was his own individual shelter beyond the headquarters building, and the other buildings. He looked up.  There was no mountain.         *       *       *       *       *  For one shivery moment he knew fear. And then the fear went away, and he was ashamed of what he had felt. What he had feared was gone now, and he knew it was gone for good and he would never have to fear it again.  \"Look here, Bruce. I wondered how long it would take to get it through that thick poetic head of yours!\"  \"Get what?\" He began to suspect what it was all about now, but he wasn't quite sure yet.  \"Smoke?\" she said.  He took one of the cigarettes and she lighted it for him and put the lighter back into her pocket.  \"It's real nice here,\" she said. \"Isn't it?\"  \"I guess it's about perfect.\"  \"It'll be easy. Staying here, I mean. We won't be going to Earth ever again, you know.\"  \"I didn't _know_ that, but I didn't _think_ we ever would again.\"  \"We wouldn't want to anyway, would we, Bruce?\"  \"No.\"  He kept on looking at the place where the mountain had been. Or maybe it still was; he couldn't make up his mind yet. Which was and which was not? That barren icy world without life, or this?  \"'_Is all that we see or seem_,'\" he whispered, half to himself, \"'_but a dream within a dream?_'\"  She laughed softly. \"Poe was ahead of his time,\" she said. \"You still don't get it, do you? You don't know what's been happening?\"  \"Maybe I don't.\"  She shrugged, and looked in the direction of the ships. \"Poor guys. I can't feel much hatred toward them now. The Martians give you a lot of understanding of the human mind--after they've accepted you, and after you've lived with them awhile. But the mountain climbers--we can see now--it's just luck, chance, we weren't like them. A deviant is a child of chance.\"  \"Yes,\" Bruce said. \"There's a lot of people like us on Earth, but they'll never get the chance--the chance we seem to have here, to live decently....\"  \"You're beginning to see now which was the dream,\" she said and smiled. \"But don't be pessimistic. Those people on Earth will get their chance, too, one of these fine days. The Conquerors aren't getting far. Venus, and then Mars, and Mars is where they stop. They'll keep coming here and climbing the mountain and finally there won't be any more. It won't take so long.\"  She rose to her toes and waved and yelled. Bruce saw Pietro and Marlene walking hand in hand up the other side of the canal. They waved back and called and then pushed off into the water in a small boat, and drifted away and out of sight around a gentle turn.  She took his arm and they walked along the canal toward where the mountain had been, or still was--he didn't know.  A quarter of a mile beyond the canal, he saw the high mound of red, naked hill, corroded and ugly, rising up like a scar of the surrounding green.  She wasn't smiling now. There were shadows on her face as the pressure on his arm stopped him.  \"I was on the first ship and Marlene on the second. None like us on the third, and on the fourth ship was Pietro. All the others had to climb the mountain--\" She stopped talking for a moment, and then he felt the pressure of her fingers on his arm. \"I'm very glad you came on the fifth,\" she whispered. \"Are you glad now?\"  \"I'm very glad,\" he said.  \"The Martians tested us,\" she explained. \"They're masters of "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50872"],["title","Not Fit for Children (#1)"],["body","is equally vul--too similar.\"  \"You and your big mouth!\" I projected to Ppon.  \"Look who's thinking!\" he excogitated back. I could see I'd have to give him a mind-lashing later.  It was up to me to save the situation. \"If you would like to examine me more closely, sir,\" I addressed the scientist, \"you will see that I am not a human being.\"  He approached me dubiously.  \"Closer,\" I said, looking him in the eye, as I bared my teeth and growled. \"I have five eyes, sir, and you will notice that I am looking at you with each one of them. I have seven arms, sir--\" here I reached out to grab him \"--and you will notice that they are all living tissue.\"  \"No, you couldn't be a human being,\" he agreed, backing away as soon as I released my grip, \"but the whole thing is ... odd. Very odd.\"  \"If anthropologists on Earth can't explain all the customs of the primitives there,\" Sam tried to placate him, \"how can we explain the behavior of extraterrestrials? Let's go into some of the houses. The chief has kindly given us his permission to look around.\"  \"Our houses are your houses,\" I stated, bowing graciously.  As always, the tourists grew extremely enthusiastic about the furniture in our simple dwellings. \"What lovely--er--things you have,\" squirrel-tooth commented. \"What are they used for?\"  \"Well, the _pryu_ is for the _mrach_, of course,\" I explained glibly, \"and the _wrooov_ is much used for _cvrking_ the _budz_, although the _ywrl_ is preferred by the less discriminating.  \"Oh,\" she said. \"How I should love to have one of the--'_wroov_' I think it was you said, for my very own. I wonder whether....\"  By a curious coincidence, Hsoj arrived at this point, carrying a tray full of things and stuff.  \"Artifacts!\" he shouted. \"Nice artifacts! Who wants to buy artifacts?\"         *       *       *       *       *  All the tourists did. They were pretty good artifacts, if I do say so myself. I'd made them out of the junk I rescued from our dustbins before the disintegration unit got to work. Honestly, I can't understand how the old ones can complain about our being wasteful and then go and throw away all sorts of perfectly useful things.  \"You must pay the natives in metal,\" the guide explained. \"They accept only coins.\"  \"Why?\" the stout female wanted to know. \"Do they really eat metal?\"  \"I doubt it. One of them ate a couple of pounds of Earth candy a tourist gave him last time and he seemed to enjoy it without ill effects.\"  \"Without ill effects!\" Ppon excogitated. \"You should have seen Ztul afterward, boy!\"  \"Look, Mac.\" A short fat human offered Hsoj a small silver coin and then five larger brown ones. \"Which would you rather have?\"  \"Them.\" Hsoj pointed unhesitatingly to the brown coins.  A smile rippled covertly through the tourists.  \"They're a simple and child-like people, but really so good-natured,\" Sam footnoted.  All of us gave simple good-natured smiles as Hsoj accepted the gift of the brown coins.  \"Keep up the good work,\" I projected. \"We can use all the copper we can get.\"  \"You like metal, dear?\" a female asked Hsoj. She unfastened a belt from around her waist. \"Would you take this in exchange for some of your pretty things?\"  \"Say 'yes,'\" I conceptualized. \"That's steel. Old and worthless to her, but not to us.\"  \"I know, I know,\" Hsoj ideated impatiently. \"What makes you think you're the only one who knows anything?\"  Never had we got such a big haul before, because everybody seemed to have all sorts of metal stuff on him that he valued less than coins.  Now came the sad part of the spiel. \"Remember, folks, these simple, honest individuals you see before you are but the scanty remnants of a once-proud race who spanned the skies. For their ancestors must have been godlike indeed to have erected such edifices as that commanding structure over there.\" Sam pointed to the portable atmosphere machine which was set up several _yebil_ away to give our playground proper air. \"Once glorious, now fallen into ruin and decay.\"  \"You're going to catch _muh_ from the old ones,\" Ppon ideated, \"when they find out you haven't been keeping the machine clean.\"  \"Don't be a silly _oosh_,\" I thought back with a mental grin. \"I'm using the atmosphere machine to create atmosphere.\"  \"You're getting to be as stupid as a human,\" he thought in disgust.  \"May we go inside?\" the scientific passenger asked Sam.  \"No, indeed,\" I said hastily. \"It is our temple, sacred to the gods. No unbeliever may set foot in it.\"  \"What are the basic tenets of your religion?\" the scientist wanted to know.  \"We do not talk about it,\" I said with dignity. \"It is tabu. Bad form.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"And now,\" announced the guide, glancing at his watch, \"we have just time for the war dance before we leave for Vesta.\"  \"Against whom are they planning a war?\" asked a small passenger, turning pale.  \"It's a vestigial ritual,\" Sam explained quickly, \"dating back to the days when there were other--er--when there was somebody to fight. Just an invocation to the gods ... general stuff like that ... nothing to be afraid of. Isn't it so, Qan?\"  \"Quite so,\" I replied, folding all my arms across my mother's cloak. \"Come in peace, go in peace. Our motto.\"  We started the dance. It wouldn't have got us a passing mark in first grade, where we'd learned it _rffi_ ago, but our version of the dance of the _zkuchi_ was plenty good enough for the tourists.  \"If I ever visit Earth, _Janna_ forbid,\" I thought to Ppon as we executed an intricate caracole, \"I'm going to wear earplugs all the time.\"  The dance finished.  \"Now everybody get together!\" Sam shouted, clapping his hands to round up his charges. \"We are about to leave little _Gchik_.\"  \"He should only know what _gchik_ means,\" Ppon sniggered mentally.  \"Little _Gchik_ is barren, dying, its past glories all but forgotten,\" Sam almost sobbed, \"but still its simple, warm-hearted inhabitants carry on bravely....\"  \"Couldn't we _do_ something for them?\" suggested the stout female.  Everybody murmured assent. This contingency arose all too often--a result of our being just too lovable.  \"No one can help us,\" I said in a deep voice, pulling the cloak over my face. The _idzik_ feathers trimming it tickled like crazy. \"We must dree our own weird alone. Besides, the air of _Gchik_ has a deleterious effect upon human beings if they're exposed to it for longer than four hours.\"  There was a mad scramble to reach the ship.  \"Stand by the atmosphere machine, Hsoj,\" I instructed, \"to poison a little air in case anybody wants to take a sample.\"  The scientist actually did, in a little bottle he seemed to have brought along for the purpose; but he got off the \"asteroid\" as rapidly as the rest of them, after that.  We watched the spaceship dwindle to a silver mote in the distance.  \"Whew,\" Ppon thought, sinking to the surface. \"That war dance sure takes a lot out of a fellow.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Then he conceptualized indignantly as he--as well as the rest of us--floated off the top level. \"Somebody's cut the gravity!\"  \"Must be Grandfather,\" I mentalized. \"I suppose he thinks we've been out long enough, so he's warning us, just as if we were a bunch of infants. I guess we'd better go inside, though. Let's not forget to turn off the atmosphere, fellows. It uses too much energy and the old ones won't let us play topside any more.\"  \"You know everything, don't you, Qan?\" Ppon sneered.  I ignored him. \"Pretty good haul,\" I excogitated as I hefted the bags of metal. \"Here, Ztul, catch!\"  \"You always make me carry everything!\" he complained.  Grandfather caught us as we lowered ourselves from the airlock. I figured he must have been getting suspicious or otherwise he'd never have left his beloved engines.  \"What's this you youngsters have?\" he wanted to know, pouncing on our bags. \"Metal, eh? I suppose you were going to make another fake meteorite out of it for me, were you?\"  \"I thought you wanted metal, Grandfather,\" I sulked. He could have been more appreciative.  \"Certainly I want metal. You know I need it to get the drive working again. But what I want to know is where you got it from. I'd think you stole it, but how could even little _muhli_ like you steal out here in space?\"  \"They have always brought you metal from time to time, Father,\" Mother projected, coming out as she overthought us. \"So clever of them, I always thought.\"  \"Yes, but I've been thinking that their encountering so many meteorites was a singularly curious coincidence. And they were curious meteorites, too. I suppose the young ones made them themselves.\"  \"But out of what, Father? You know we don't have any spare metal on the ship. That's why you haven't been able to get the repairs finished before. Where else could they get the metal but from meteorites?\"  \"I don't know where they get their metal from, but certainly not from meteorites. These pieces here are artifacts. Look, the metal has been more or less refined and roughly formed into shapes with crude designs upon them. Tell me the truth, Qan, where did you get these?\"  \"Some people gave them to us,\" I replied sullenly.  \"People?\" asked my mother. \"What are people?\"  \"Natives of this solar system. They call themselves people.\"  \"Nonsense!\" my grandfather interjected. \"It's just another one of your fantasies. You know what the astronomers say--none of the planets of this little system is capable of supporting life.\"  \"They come from the third planet,\" I persisted, trying to keep from disgracing myself by _fllwng_ in front of the other young ones. \"There is life there. All of us have seen them. Besides, there is the metal.\"  My companions chorused agreement.  \"You see, Father,\" my mother smiled, stroking my head with three hands, \"the wise ones are not always right.\"         *       *       *       *       *  My grandfather nodded his head slowly. \"It is not impossible, I suppose. I hope it is true that these--people _gave_ you and your friends the metal, Qan.\" "]]]
