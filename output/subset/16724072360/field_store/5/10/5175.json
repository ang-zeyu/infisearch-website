So what I have to propose is a simple thing--to take a chance.\"  She reached out and touched the rusted hulk of the rocket.  \"This is _our_ rocket. We paid for our trip. And we're going to _take_ our trip!\"  Everyone rustled and stood on tiptoes and opened an astonished mouth.  Mr. Thirkell began to cry. He did it quite easily and very effectively.  \"We're going to get in this ship,\" said Mrs. Bellowes, ignoring him. \"And we're going to take off to where we were going.\"  Mr. Thirkell stopped crying long enough to say, \"But it was all a fake. I don't know anything about space. He's not out there, anyway. I lied. I don't know where He is, and I couldn't find Him if I wanted to. And you were fools to ever take my word on it.\"  \"Yes,\" said Mrs. Bellowes, \"we were fools. I'll go along on that. But you can't blame us, for we're old, and it was a lovely, good and fine idea, one of the loveliest ideas in the world. Oh, we didn't really fool ourselves that we could get nearer to Him physically. It was the gentle, mad dream of old people, the kind of thing you hold onto for a few minutes a day, even though you know it's not true. So, all of you who want to go, you follow me in the ship.\"  \"But you can't go!\" said Mr. Thirkell. \"You haven't got a navigator. And that ship's a ruin!\"  \"You,\" said Mrs. Bellowes, \"will be the navigator.\"  She stepped into the ship, and after a moment, the other old ladies pressed forward. Mr. Thirkell, windmilling his arms frantically, was nevertheless pressed through the port, and in a minute the door slammed shut. Mr. Thirkell was strapped into the navigator's seat, with everyone talking at once and holding him down. The special helmets were issued to be fitted over every gray or white head to supply extra oxygen in case of a leakage in the ship's hull, and at long last the hour had come and Mrs. Bellowes stood behind Mr. Thirkell and said, \"We're ready, sir.\"  He said nothing. He pleaded with them silently, using his great, dark, wet eyes, but Mrs. Bellowes shook her head and pointed to the control.  \"Takeoff,\" agreed Mr. Thirkell morosely, and pulled a switch.  Everybody fell. The rocket went up from the planet Mars in a great fiery glide, with the noise of an entire kitchen thrown down an elevator shaft, with a sound of pots and pans and kettles and fires boiling and stews bubbling, with a smell of burned incense and rubber and sulphur, with a color of yellow fire, and a ribbon of red stretching below them, and all the old women singing and holding to each other, and Mrs. Bellowes crawling upright in the sighing, straining, trembling ship.  \"Head for space, Mr. Thirkell.\"  \"It can't last,\" said Mr. Thirkell, sadly. \"This ship can't last. It will--\"  It did.  The rocket exploded.  Mrs. Bellowes felt herself lifted and thrown about dizzily, like a doll. She heard the great screamings and saw the flashes of bodies sailing by her in fragments of metal and powdery light.  \"Help, help!\" cried Mr. Thirkell, far away, on a small radio beam.  The ship disintegrated into a million parts, and the old ladies, all one hundred of them, were flung straight on ahead with the same velocity as the ship.  As for Mr. Thirkell, for some reason of trajectory, perhaps, he had been blown out the other side of the ship. Mrs. Bellowes saw him falling separate and away from them, screaming, screaming.  _There goes Mr. Thirkell_, thought Mrs. Bellowes.  And she knew where he was going. He was going to be burned and roasted and broiled good, but very good.  Mr. Thirkell was falling down into the Sun.  _And here we are_, thought Mrs. Bellowes. _Here we are, going on out, and out, and out._  There was hardly a sense of motion at all, but she knew that she was traveling at fifty thousand miles an hour and would continue to travel at that speed for an eternity, until....  She saw the other women swinging all about her in their own trajectories, a few minutes of oxygen left to each of them in their helmets, and each was looking up to where they were going.  _Of course_, thought Mrs. Bellowes. _Out into space. Out and out, and the darkness like a great church, and the stars like candles, and in spite of everything, Mr. Thirkell, the rocket, and the dishonesty, we are going toward the Lord._  And there, yes, _there_, as she fell on and on, coming toward her, she could almost discern the outline now, coming toward her was His mighty golden hand, reaching down to hold her and comfort her like a frightened sparrow....  \"I'm Mrs. Amelia Bellowes,\" she said quietly, in her best company voice. \"I'm from the planet Earth.\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51184"],["title","Inside Earth (#1)"],["body","at all.... Well, you know what happened on Samtrak.\"  I knew. The Samtraks are now the entrepreneurs of the Empire, really ingenious traders, but within the memory of some of our older men they were a sore-spot. They didn't understand the meaning of Empire any more than Earth does, and they never did understand it until we goaded them into open rebellion. The very reverse of divide and rule, you might say, and it worked. We withdrew trading privileges one by one, until they revolted successfully, thus educating themselves sociologically in only a few generations.         *       *       *       *       *  Vorka said, \"The problem of Earth is not quite that simple.\" He leaned back, made a bridge of his fingers, and peered across them at me. \"Do you know precisely what a provocateur job is, Conru?\"  I said that I did, but only in a hazy way, because until now my work had been pretty much restricted to social relations on the more advanced Empire planets. However, I told him that I did know the idea was to provoke discontent and, ultimately, rebellion.  The Coordinator smiled. \"Well, that's just the starter, Conru. It's a lot more complex than that. Each planet has its own special problems. The Samtraks, for example, had a whole background of cutthroat competition. That was easy: we eliminated that by showing them what _real_ cutthroat competition could be like. But Earth is different. Look at it this way. They fight among themselves. Because of their mythical distinctions, not realizing that there are no inferior races, only more or less advanced ones, and that individuals must be judged as individuals, not as members of groups, nations or races. A planet like Earth can be immensely valuable to the Empire, but not if it has to be garrisoned. Its contribution must be voluntary and whole-hearted.\"  \"A difficult problem,\" I said. \"My opinion is that we should treat all exactly alike--_force_ them to abandon their unrealistic differences.\"  \"Exactly!\" The Coordinator seemed pleased, but, actually, this was pretty elementary stuff. \"We're never too rough on the eager lads who come here from Valgol and kick the natives around a bit. We even encourage it when the spirit of rebelliousness dies down.\"  I told him I had met one.  \"Irritating, wasn't it, Conru? Humiliating. Of course, these lads will be reconditioned to civilization when they finish their military service and prepare for more specialized work. Yes, treating all Earthlings alike is the solution. We put restrictions on these colonials; they can't hold top jobs, and so on. And we encourage wild stories about brutality on our part. Not enough to make everybody mad at us, or even a majority--the rumored tyranny has always happened to someone else. But there's a certain class of beings who'll get fighting mad, and that's the class we want.\"  \"The leaders,\" I chimed in. \"The idealists. Brave, intelligent, patriotic. The kind who probably wouldn't be a part of this racial bickering, anyway.\"  \"Right,\" said the Coordinator. \"We'll give them the ammunition for their propaganda. We've _been_ doing it. Result: the leaders get mad. Races, religions, nationalities, they hate us worse than they hate each other.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The way he painted it, I was hardly needed at all. I told him that.  \"Ideally, that would be the situation, Conru. Only it doesn't work that way.\" He took out a soft cloth and wiped his forehead. \"Even the leaders are too involved in this myth of differences and they can't concentrate all their efforts. Luron, of course, would be the other alternative--\"  That was a very logical statement, but sometimes logic has a way of making you laugh, and I was laughing now. Luron considered itself our arch-enemy. With a few dozen allies on a path of conquest, Luron thought it could wrest Empire from our hands. Well, we let them play. And each time Luron swooped down on one of the more primitive planets, we let them, for Luron would serve as well as ourselves in goading backward peoples to unite and advance. Perhaps Luron, as a social entity, grew wiser each time. Certainly the primitive colonials did. Luron had started a chain reaction which threatened to overthrow the tyranny of superstition on a hundred planets. Good old Luron, our arch-enemy, would see the light itself some day.  The Coordinator shook his head. \"Can't use Luron here. Technologies are entirely too similar. It might shatter both planets, and we wouldn't want that.\"  \"So what do we use?\"  \"You, Conru. You get in with the revolutionaries, you make sure that they want to fight, you--\"  \"I see,\" I told him. \"Then I try to stop it at the last minute. Not so soon that the rebellion doesn't help at all--\"  The Coordinator put his hand down flat. \"Nothing of the sort. They _must_ fight. And they must be defeated, again and again, if necessary, until they are ready to succeed. That will be, of course, when they are _totally_ against us.\"  I stood up. \"I understand.\"  He waved me back into the chair. \"You'll be lucky to understand it by the time you're finished with this assignment and transferred to another ... that is, if you come out of this one alive.\"  I smiled a bit sheepishly and told him to go ahead.  \"We have some influence in the underground movement, as you might logically expect. The leader is a man we worked very hard to have elected.\"  \"A member of one of the despised races?\" I guessed.  \"The best we could do at this point was to help elect someone from a minority sub-group of the dominant white race. The leader's name is Levinsohn. He is of the white sub-group known as Jews.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"How well is this Levinsohn accepted by the movement?\"  \"Considerable resistance and hostility,\" the Coordinator said. \"That's to be expected. However, we've made sure that there is no other organization the minority-haters can join, so they have to follow him or quit. He's able, all right; one of the most able men they have, which helps our aims. Even those who discriminate against Jews reluctantly admire him. He's moved the headquarters of the movement out into space, and the man's so brilliant that we don't even know where. We'll find out, mainly through you, I hope, but that isn't the important thing.\"  \"What is?\" I asked, baffled.  \"To report on the unification of Earth. It's possible that the anarch movement can achieve it under Levinsohn. In that case, we'll make sure they win, or think they win, and will gladly sign a treaty giving Earth equal planetary status in the Empire.\"  \"And if unity hasn't been achieved?\"  \"We simply crush this rebellion and make them start all over again. They'll have learned some degree of unity from this revolt and so the next one will be more successful.\" He stood up and I got out of my chair to face him. \"That's for the future, though. We'll work out our plans from the results of this campaign.\"  \"But isn't there a lot of danger in the policy of fomenting rebellion against us?\" I asked.  He lifted his shoulders. \"Evolution is always painful, forced evolution even more so. Yes, there are great dangers, but advance information from you and other agents can reduce the risk. It's a chance we must take, Conru.\"  \"Conrad,\" I corrected him, smiling. \"Plain Mr. Conrad Haugen ... of Earth.\"   II  A few days later, I left North America Center, and in spite of the ominous need to hurry, my eastward journey was a ramble. The anarchs would be sure to check my movements as far back as they could, and my story had better ring true. For the present, I must _be_ my role, a vagabond.  The city was soon behind me. It was far from other settlement--it is good policy to keep the Centers rather isolated, and we could always contact our garrisons in native towns quickly enough. Before long I was alone in the mountains.  I liked that part of the trip. The Rockies are huge and serene, a fresh cold wind blows from their peaks and roars in the pines, brawling rivers foam through their dales and canyons--it is a big landscape, clean and strong and lonely. It speaks with silence.  I hitched a ride for some hundreds of miles with one of the great truck-trains that dominate the western highways. The driver was Earthling, and though he complained much about the Valgolian tyranny he looked well-fed, healthy, secure. I thought of the wars which had been laying the planet waste, the social ruin and economic collapse which the Empire had mended, and wondered if Terra would ever be fit to rule itself.  I came out of the enormous mountainlands into the sage plains of Nevada. For a few days I worked at a native ranch, listening to the talk and keeping my mouth shut. Yes, there was discontent!  \"Their taxes are killing me,\" said the owner. \"What the hell incentive do I have to produce if they take it away from me?\" I nodded, but thought: _Your kind was paying more taxes in the old days, and had less to show for it. Here you get your money back in public works and universal security. No one on Earth is cold or hungry. Can you only produce for your own private gain, Earthling?_  \"The labor draft got my kid the other day,\" said the foreman. \"He'll spend two good years of his life working for them, and prob'ly come back hopheaded about the good o' the Empire.\"  _There was a time_, I thought, _when millions of Earthlings clamored for work, or spent years fighting their wars, gave their youth to a god of battle who only clamored for more blood. And how can we have a stable society without educating its members to respect it?_  \"I _want_ another kid,\" said the female cook. \"Two ain't really enough. They're good boys, but I want a girl too. Only the Eridanian law says if I go over my quota, if I have one more, they'll sterilize me! And they'd do it, the meddling devils.\"  _A billion Earthlings are all the Solar System can hold under decent standards of living without exhausting what natural resources their own culture left us_, I thought. _We aren't "]]]
