The cornice-dandruff pattered down. A few small fragments rebounded from the metal hoopskirt.  Robie made some small, uncertain movements, as if feeling for broken bones. He was hunting for the traffic light, but it no longer shone either red or green.  He slowly scanned a full circle. There was nothing anywhere to interest his reference silhouettes. Yet whenever he tried to move, his under-scanners warned him of low obstructions. It was very puzzling.  The silence was disturbed by moans and a crackling sound, as faint at first as the scampering of distant rats.  A seared man, his charred clothes fuming where the blast had blown out the fire, rose from the curb. Robie scanned him.  \"Good day, sir,\" Robie said. \"Would you care for a smoke? A truly cool smoke? Now I have here a yet-unmarketed brand....\"  But the customer had run away, screaming, and Robie never ran after customers, though he could follow them at a medium brisk roll. He worked his way along the curb where the man had sprawled, carefully keeping his distance from the low obstructions, some of which writhed now and then, forcing him to jog. Shortly he reached a fire hydrant. He scanned it. His electronic vision, though it still worked, had been somewhat blurred by the blast.  \"Hello, youngster,\" Robie said. Then, after a long pause, \"Cat got your tongue? Well, I have a little present for you. A nice, lovely polly-lop.  \"Take it, youngster,\" he said after another pause. \"It's for you. Don't be afraid.\"  His attention was distracted by other customers, who began to rise up oddly here and there, twisting forms that confused his reference silhouettes and would not stay to be scanned properly. One cried, \"Water,\" but no quarter clinked in Robie's claws when he caught the word and suggested, \"How about a nice refreshing drink of Poppy Pop?\"  The rat-crackling of the flames had become a jungle muttering. The blind windows began to wink fire again.         *       *       *       *       *  A little girl marched, stepping neatly over arms and legs she did not look at. A white dress and the once taller bodies around her had shielded her from the brilliance and the blast. Her eyes were fixed on Robie. In them was the same imperious confidence, though none of the delight, with which she had watched him earlier.  \"Help me, Robie,\" she said. \"I want my mother.\"  \"Hello, youngster,\" Robie said. \"What would you like? Comics? Candy?\"  \"Where is she, Robie? Take me to her.\"  \"Balloons? Would you like to watch me blow up a balloon?\"  The little girl began to cry. The sound triggered off another of Robie's novelty circuits, a service feature that had brought in a lot of favorable publicity.  \"Is something wrong?\" he asked. \"Are you in trouble? Are you lost?\"  \"Yes, Robie. Take me to my mother.\"  \"Stay right here,\" Robie said reassuringly, \"and don't be frightened. I will call a policeman.\" He whistled shrilly, twice.  Time passed. Robie whistled again. The windows flared and roared. The little girl begged, \"Take me away, Robie,\" and jumped onto a little step in his hoopskirt.  \"Give me a dime,\" Robie said.  The little girl found one in her pocket and put it in his claws.  \"Your weight,\" Robie said, \"is fifty-four and one-half pounds.\"  \"Have you seen my daughter, have you seen her?\" a woman was crying somewhere. \"I left her watching that thing while I stepped inside--_Rita!_\"  \"Robie helped me,\" the little girl began babbling at her. \"He knew I was lost. He even called the police, but they didn't come. He weighed me, too. Didn't you, Robie?\"  But Robie had gone off to peddle Poppy Pop to the members of a rescue squad which had just come around the corner, more robotlike in their asbestos suits than he in his metal skin."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50827"],["title","Orphans of the Void (#1)"],["body","unaware. The exec was pale with surprise.  \"What were they?\" he said blankly. \"Lord, they looked like robots!\"  \"They were.\"  Ball stared confoundedly at the screen. The things were now a confusion of dots in the mist.  \"Almost humanoid,\" Steffens said, \"but not quite.\"  Ball was slowly absorbing the situation. He turned to gaze inquiringly at Steffens.  \"Well, what do we do now?\"  Steffens shrugged. \"They saw us. We could leave now and let them quite possibly make a ... a legend out of our visit, or we could go down and see if they tie in with the buildings on Tyban IV.\"  \"_Can_ we go down?\"  \"Legally? I don't know. If they are robots, yes, since robots cannot constitute a race. But there's another possibility.\" He tapped his fingers on the screen confusedly. \"They don't have to be robots at all. They could be the natives.\"  Ball gulped. \"I don't follow you.\"  \"They could be the original inhabitants of this planet--the brains of them, at least, protected in radiation-proof metal. Anyway,\" he added, \"they're the most perfect mechanicals I've ever seen.\"  Ball shook his head, sat down abruptly. Steffens turned from the screen, strode nervously across the Main Deck, thinking.  The Mapping Command, they called it. Theoretically, all he was supposed to do was make a closeup examination of unexplored systems, checking for the presence of life-forms as well as for the possibilities of human colonization. Make a check and nothing else. But he knew very clearly that if he returned to Sirius base without investigating this robot situation, he could very well be court-martialed one way or the other, either for breaking the Law of Contact or for dereliction of duty.  And there was also the possibility, which abruptly occurred to him, that the robots might well be prepared to blow his ship to hell and gone.  He stopped in the center of the deck. A whole new line of thought opened up. If the robots were armed and ready ... could this be an outpost?  _An outpost!_  He turned and raced for the bridge. If he went in and landed and was lost, then the League might never know in time. If he went in and stirred up trouble....  The thought in his mind was scattered suddenly, like a mist blown away. A voice was speaking in his mind, a deep calm voice that seemed to say:  \"_Greetings. Do not be alarmed. We do not wish you to be alarmed. Our desire is only to serve...._\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"Greetings, it said! Greetings!\" Ball was mumbling incredulously through shocked lips.  Everyone on the ship had heard the voice. When it spoke again, Steffens was not sure whether it was just one voice or many voices.  \"We await your coming,\" it said gravely, and repeated: \"Our desire is only to serve.\"  And then the robots sent a _picture_.  As perfect and as clear as a tridim movie, a rectangular plate took shape in Steffens' mind. On the face of the plate, standing alone against a background of red-brown, bare rocks, was one of the robots. With slow, perfect movement, the robot carefully lifted one of the hanging arms of its side, of its _right_ side, and extended it toward Steffens, a graciously offered hand.  Steffens felt a peculiar, compelling urge to take the hand, realized right away that the urge to take the hand was not entirely his. The robot mind had helped.  When the picture vanished, he knew that the others had seen it. He waited for a while; there was no further contact, but the feeling of the robot's urging was still strong within him. He had an idea that, if they wanted to, the robots could control his mind. So when nothing more happened, he began to lose his fear.  While the crew watched in fascination, Steffens tried to talk back. He concentrated hard on what he was saying, said it aloud for good measure, then held his own hand extended in the robot manner of shaking hands.  \"Greetings,\" he said, because it was what _they_ had said, and explained: \"We have come from the stars.\"  It was overly dramatic, but so was the whole situation. He wondered baffledly if he should have let the Alien Contact crew handle it. Order someone to stand there, feeling like a fool, and _think_ a message?  No, it was his responsibility; he had to go on:  \"We request--we respectfully request permission to land upon your planet.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Steffens had not realized that there were so many.  They had been gathering since his ship was first seen, and now there were hundreds of them clustered upon the hill. Others were arriving even as the skiff landed; they glided in over the rocky hills with fantastic ease and power, so that Steffens felt a momentary anxiety. Most of the robots were standing with the silent immobility of metal. Others threaded their way to the fore and came near the skiff, but none touched it, and a circle was cleared for Steffens when he came out.  One of the near robots came forward alone, moving, as Steffens now saw, on a number of short, incredibly strong and agile legs. The black thing paused before him, extended a hand as it had done in the picture. Steffens took it, he hoped, warmly; felt the power of the metal through the glove of his suit.  \"Welcome,\" the robot said, speaking again to his mind, and now Steffens detected a peculiar alteration in the robot's tone. It was less friendly now, less--Steffens could not understand--somehow less _interested_, as if the robot had been--expecting someone else.  \"Thank you,\" Steffens said. \"We are deeply grateful for your permission to land.\"  \"Our desire,\" the robot repeated mechanically, \"is only to serve.\"  Suddenly, Steffens began to feel alone, surrounded by machines. He tried to push the thought out of his mind, because he knew that they _should_ seem inhuman. But....  \"Will the others come down?\" asked the robot, still mechanically.  Steffens felt his embarrassment. The ship lay high in the mist above, jets throbbing gently.  \"They must remain with the ship,\" Steffens said aloud, trusting to the robot's formality not to ask him why. Although, if they could read his mind, there was no need to ask.  For a long while, neither spoke, long enough for Steffens to grow tense and uncomfortable. He could not think of a thing to say, the robot was obviously waiting, and so, in desperation, he signaled the Aliencon men to come on out of the skiff.  They came, wonderingly, and the ring of robots widened. Steffens heard the one robot speak again. The voice was now much more friendly.  \"We hope you will forgive us for intruding upon your thought. It is our--custom--not to communicate unless we are called upon. But when we observed that you were in ignorance of our real--nature--and were about to leave our planet, we decided to put aside our custom, so that you might base your decision upon sufficient data.\"  Steffens replied haltingly that he appreciated their action.  \"We perceive,\" the robot went on, \"that you are unaware of our complete access to your mind, and would perhaps be--dismayed--to learn that we have been gathering information from you. We must--apologize. Our only purpose was so that we could communicate with you. Only that information was taken which is necessary for communication and--understanding. We will enter your minds henceforth only at your request.\"  Steffens did not react to the news that his mind was being probed as violently as he might have. Nevertheless it was a shock, and he retreated into observant silence as the Aliencon men went to work.  The robot which seemed to have been doing the speaking was in no way different from any of the others in the group. Since each of the robots was immediately aware of all that was being said or thought, Steffens guessed that they had sent one forward just for appearance's sake, because they perceived that the Earthmen would feel more at home. The picture of the extended hand, the characteristic handshake of Earthmen, had probably been borrowed, too, for the same purpose of making him and the others feel at ease. The one jarring note was the robot's momentary lapse, those unexplainable few seconds when the things had seemed almost disappointed. Steffens gave up wondering about that and began to examine the first robot in detail.  It was not very tall, being at least a foot shorter than the Earthmen. The most peculiar thing about it, except for the circling eye-band of the head, was a mass of symbols which were apparently engraved upon the metal chest. Symbols in row upon row--numbers, perhaps--were upon the chest, and repeated again below the level of the arms, and continued in orderly rows across the front of the robot, all the way down to the base of the trunk. If they were numbers, Steffens thought, then it was a remarkably complicated system. But he noticed the same pattern on the nearer robots, all apparently identical. He was forced to conclude that the symbols were merely decoration and let it go tentatively at that, although the answer seemed illogical.  It wasn't until he was on his way home that Steffens remembered the symbols again. And only then did he realized what they were.         *       *       *       *       *  After a while, convinced that there was no danger, Steffens had the ship brought down. When the crew came out of the airlock, they were met by the robots, and each man found himself with a robot at his side, humbly requesting to be of service. There were literally thousands of the robots now, come from all over the barren horizon. The mass of them stood apart, immobile on a plain near the ship, glinting in the sun like a vast, metallic field of black wheat.  The robots had obviously been built to serve. Steffens began to _feel_ their pleasure, to sense it in spite of the blank, expressionless faces. They were almost like children in their eagerness, yet they were still reserved. Whoever had built them, Steffens thought in wonder, had built them well.  Ball came to join Steffens, staring at the robots through the clear plastic of his helmet with "]]]
