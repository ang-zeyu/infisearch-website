Still, the painful constraint she imposed on herself must find vent in some way, and, as the tortured anguish of her soul reached its height, large tears rolled down her cheeks.  These, too, were noticed by her enemy and made the target of her wit; but this time the sarcasm failed to produce its effect upon the Syrian, for, instead of laughing, he grew grave, and whispered something which seemed to Barine a reproof or a warning.  Iras's reply was merely a contemptuous shrug of the shoulders.  Barine had noticed long before that her mother, in her fear and bewilderment, had brought her own cloak instead of her daughter's, and this circumstance also did not seem to her foe too trivial for a sneer.  But the childish insolence that seemed to have taken possession of one who usually by no means lacked dignity, was merely the mask beneath which she concealed her own suffering.  A grave motive was the source of the mirth by which she affected to be moved at the sight of her enemy's cloak.  The grey, ill-fitting garment disfigured Barine, and she desired that the Queen should feel confident of surpassing her rival even in outward charms.  No one, not even Cleopatra, could dispense with a protecting wrap in this cold draught, and nothing suited her better than the purple mantle in whose delicate woollen fabric black and gold dragons and griffins were embroidered.  Iras had taken care that it lay ready. Barine could not fail to appear like a beggar in comparison, though Alexas said that her blue kerchief was marvellously becoming.  He was a base-minded voluptuary, who, aided by rich gifts of mind and wide knowledge, had shunned no means of ingratiating himself with Antony, the most lavish of patrons.  The repulse which this man, accustomed to success, had received from Barine had been hard to forget, yet he did not resign the hope of winning her.  Never had she seemed more desirable than in her touching weakness.  Even base natures are averse to witnessing the torture of the defenceless, and when Iras had aimed another poisoned shaft at her, he ventured, at the risk of vexing his ally, to say, under his breath:  \"Condemned criminals are usually granted, before their end, a favourite dish.  I have no cause to wish Barine anything good; but I would not grudge that.  You, on the contrary, seem to delight in pouring wormwood on her last mouthful.\"  \"Certainly,\" she answered, her eyes sparkling brightly.  \"Malice is the purest of pleasures; at least to me, when exercised on this woman.\"  The Syrian, with a strange smile, held out his hand, saying: \"Keep your good-will towards me, Iras.\"  \"Because,\" she retorted with a  sneer, \"evil may follow my enmity.  I think so, too.  I am not especially sensitive concerning myself, but whoever dares\"--here she raised her voice--\"to harm one whom I--Just listen to the cheers!  How she carries all hearts with her!  Though Fate had made her a beggar, she would still be peerless among women.  She is like the sun.  The clouds which intrude upon her pathway of radiance are consumed and disappear.\"  While uttering the last sentence she had turned towards Barine, whose ear the sharp voice again pierced like a thorn, as she commanded her to prepare for the examination.  Almost at the same moment the door, caught by the wind, closed with a loud bang.  The \"introducer\"--[Marshal of the court.]--had opened it, and, after a hasty glance, exclaimed:  \"The audience will not be given in this meeting place for all the winds of heaven!  Her Majesty desires to receive her late visitor in the Hall of Shells.\"  With these words he bowed courteously to Barine, and ushered her and her two companions through several corridors and apartments into a well- heated anteroom.  Here even the windows were thoroughly protected from the storm.  Several body-guards and pages belonging to the corps of the \"royal boys\" stood waiting to receive them.  \"This is comfortable.\"  said Alexas, turning to Iras.  \"Was the winter we have just experienced intended to fill us with twofold gratitude for the delights of the mild spring in this blessed room?\"  \"Perhaps so,\" she answered sullenly, and then added in a low tone: \"Here at Lochias the seasons do not follow their usual course.  They change according to the pleasure of the supreme will.  Instead of four, the Egyptians, as you know, have but three; in the palaces on the Nile they are countless.  What is the meaning of this sudden entry of summer? Winter would have pleased me better.\"  The Queen--Iras knew not why--had changed her arrangements for Barine's reception.  This vexed her, and her features assumed a gloomy, threatening expression as the young beauty, casting aside her cloak and kerchief, stood awaiting Cleopatra in a white robe of fine material and perfect fit.  The thick, fair braids, wound simply around her shapely head, gave her an appearance of almost childish youth, and the sight made Iras feel as if she, and Cleopatra also, were outwitted.  In the dimly lighted atrium of the house near the Paneum garden, she had noticed only that Barine wore something white.  Had it been merely a night robe, so much the better.  But she might have appeared in her present garb at the festival of Isis.  The most careful deliberation could have selected nothing more suitable or becoming.  And did this vain woman go to rest with costly gold ornaments?  Else how did the circlet chance to be on her arm?  Each of Cleopatra's charms seemed to Iras, who knew them all, like a valuable possession of her own.  To see even the least of them surpassed by another vexed her; and to behold in yonder woman a form which she could not deny was no less beautiful, enraged, nay, pierced her to the heart.  Since she had known that because of Barine she could hope for nothing more from the man to whose love she believed she possessed a claim dating from their childhood, she had hated the young beauty.  And now to the many things which contributed to increase her hostile mood, was added the disagreeable consciousness that during the last few hours she had treated her contemptibly.  Had she only seen earlier what her foe's cloak concealed, she would have found means to give her a different appearance. But she must remain as she was; for Chairman had already entered.  Other hours, however, would follow, and if the next did not decide the fate of the woman whom she hated, future ones should.  For this purpose she did not need the aid of Charmian, her uncle Archibius's sister, who had hitherto been a beloved associate and maternal friend.  But what had happened?  Iras fancied that her pleasant features wore a repellent expression which she had never seen before. Was this also the singer's fault?  And what was the cause?  The older woman's manner decided the question whether she should still bestow upon her returned relative the love of a grateful niece.  No, she would no longer put any restraint upon herself.  Charmian should feel that she (Iras) considered any favour shown to her foe an insult.  To work against her secretly was not in her nature.  She had courage to show an enemy her aversion, and she did not fear Charmian enough to pursue a different course.  She knew that the artist Leonax, Barine's father, had been Charmian's lover; but this did not justify her favouring the woman who had robbed her niece of the heart of the man whom she--as Charmian knew--had loved from childhood.  Charmian had just had a long conversation with her brother, and had also learned in the palace that Barine had been summoned to the Queen's presence in the middle of the night; so, firmly persuaded that evil was intended to the young woman who had already passed through so many agitating scenes of joy and sorrow, she entered the waiting-room, and her pleasant though no longer youthful face, framed in smooth, grey hair, was greeted by Barine as the shipwrecked mariner hails the sight of land.  All the emotions which had darkened and embittered her soul were soothed. She hastened towards her friend's sister, as a frightened child seeks its mother, and Charmian perceived what was stirring in her heart.  It would not do, under existing circumstances, to kiss her in the palace, but she drew Leonax's daughter towards her to show Iras that she was ready to extend a protecting hand over the persecuted woman.  But Barine gazed at her with pleading glances, beseeching aid, whispering amid her tears: \"Help me, Charmian.  She has tortured, insulted, humiliated me with looks and words--so cruelly, so spitefully!  Help me; I can bear no more.\"  Charmian shook her kind head and urged her in a whisper to calm herself. She had robbed Iras of her lover; she should remember that.  Cost what it might, she must not shed another tear.  The Queen was gracious.  She, Charmian, would aid her.  Everything would depend on showing herself to Cleopatra as she was, not as slander represented her.  She must answer her as she would Archibius or herself.  The kindly woman, as she spoke, stroked her brow and eyes with maternal tenderness, and Barine felt as if goodness itself had quelled the tempest in her soul.  She gazed around her as though roused from a troubled dream, and now for the first time perceived the richly adorned room in which she stood, the admiring glances of the boys in the Macedonian corps of pages, and the bright fire blazing cheerily on the hearth.  The howling of the storm increased the pleasant sense of being under a firm roof, and Iras, who had whispered to the \"introducer\" at the door, no longer seemed like a sharp thorn or a spiteful demon, but a woman by no means destitute of charm, who repulsed her, but on whom she had inflicted the keenest pang a woman's heart can suffer.  Then she again thought of her wounded lover at home, and remembered that, whatever might happen, his heart did not belong to Iras, but to her alone.  Lastly, she recalled Archibius's description of Cleopatra's"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5477"],["title","Cleopatra — Volume 05 (#2)"],["body","d, and this remembrance was followed by the conviction that the omnipotent sovereign would be neither cruel nor unjust, and that it would depend upon herself to win her favour.  Charmian, too, was the Queen's confidante; and if the manner of Iras and Alexas had alarmed her, Charmian's might well inspire confidence.  All these thoughts darted through her brain with the speed of lightning. Only a brief time for consideration remained; for, even as she bowed her head on the bosom of her friend, the \"introducer\" entered the room, crying, \"Her illustrious Majesty will expect those whom she summoned in a few minutes!\"  Soon after a chamberlain appeared, waving a fan of ostrich feathers and, preceded by the court official, they passed through several brilliantly lighted, richly furnished rooms.  Barine again breathed freely and moved with head erect; and when the wide, lofty folding doors of ebony, against whose deep black surface the inlaid figures of Tritons, mermaids, shells, fish, and sea monsters were sharply relieved, she beheld a glittering, magnificent scene, for the hall which Cleopatra had chosen for her reception was completely covered with various marine forms, from the shells to coral and starfish.  A wide, lofty structure, composed of masses of stalactites and unhewn blocks of stone, formed a deep grotto at the end of the hall, whence peered the gigantic head of a monster whose open jaws formed the fireplace of the chimney.  Logs of fragrant Arabian wood were blazing brightly on the hearth, and the dragon's ruby glass eyes diffused a red light through the apartment which, blended with the rays of the white and pink lamps in the shape of lotus flowers fastened among gold and silver tendrils and groups of sedges on the walls and ceiling, filling the spacious apartment with the soft light whose roseate hue was specially becoming to Cleopatra's waxen complexion.  Several stewards and cup-bearers, the master of the hunt, chamberlains, female attendants, eunuchs, and other court officials were awaiting the Queen, and pages who belonged to the Macedonian cadet corps of royal boys stood sleepily, with drooping heads, around the small throne of gold, coral, and amber which, placed opposite to the chimney, awaited the sovereign.  Barine had already seen this magnificent hall, and others still more beautiful in the Sebasteum, and the splendour therefore neither excited nor abashed her; only she would fain have avoided the numerous train of courtiers.  Could it be Cleopatra's intention to question her before the eyes of all these men, women, and boys?  She no longer felt afraid, but her heart still throbbed quickly.  It had beat in the same way in her girlhood, when she was asked to sing in the presence of strangers.  At last she heard doors open, and an invisible hand parted the heavy curtains at her right.  She expected to see the Regent, the Keeper of the Seal, and the whole brilliantly adorned train of attendants who always surrounded the Queen on formal occasions, enter the magnificent hall. Else why had it been selected as the scene of this nocturnal trial?  But what was this?  While she was still recalling the display at the Adonis festival, the curtains began to close again.  The courtiers around the throne straightened their bowed figures, the pages forgot their fatigue, and all joined in the Greek salutation of welcome, and the \"Life! happiness! health!\" with which the Egyptians greeted their sovereign.  The woman of middle height who now appeared before the curtain, and who, as she crossed the wide hall alone and unattended, seemed to Barine even smaller than when surrounded by the gay throng at the Adonis festival, must be the Queen.  Ay, it was she!  Iras was already standing by her side, and Charmian was approaching with the \"introducer.\"  The women rendered her various little services thus Iras took from her shoulders the purple mantle, with its embroidery of black and gold dragons.  What an exquisite masterpiece of the loom it must be!  All the dangers against which she must defend herself flashed swiftly through Barine's mind; yet, for an instant, she felt the foolish feminine desire to see and handle the costly mantle.  But Iras had already laid it on the arm of one of the waiting maids, and Cleopatra now glanced around her, and with a youthful, elastic step approached the throne.  Once more the feeling of timidity which she had had in her girlhood overpowered Barine, but with it came the memory of the garden of Epicurus, and Archibius's assurance that she, too, would have left the Queen with her heart overflowing with warm enthusiasm had not a disturbing influence interposed between them.  Yet, had this disturbing influence really existed?  No.  It was created solely by Cleopatra's jealous imagination.  If she would only permit her to speak freely now, she should hear that Antony cared as little for her as she, Barine, for the boy Caesarion.  What prevented her from confessing that her heart was another's?  Iras had no one to blame save herself if she spoke the truth pitilessly in her presence.  Cleopatra now turned to the \"introducer,\" waving her hand towards the throne and those who surrounded it.  Ay, she was indeed beautiful.  How bright and clear was the light of her large eyes, in spite of the harassing days through which she had passed and the present night of watching!  Cleopatra's heart was still elated by the reception of her bold idea of escape, and she approached Barine with gentler feelings and intentions. She had chosen a pleasanter room for the interview than the one Iras had selected.  She desired a special environment to suit each mood, and as soon as she saw the group of courtiers who surrounded the throne she ordered their dismissal.  The \"introducer,\" to carry out the usual ceremonial, had commanded their presence in the audience chamber, but their attendance had given the meeting a form which was now distasteful to the Queen.  She wished to question, not to condemn.  At so happy an hour it was a necessity of her nature to be gracious. Perhaps she had been unduly anxious concerning this singer.  It even seemed probable; for a man who loved her like Antony could scarcely yearn for the favour of another woman.  This view had been freshly confirmed by a brief conversation with the chief Inspector of Sacrifices, an estimable old man, who, after hearing how Antony had hurried in pursuit of her at Actium, raised his eyes and hands as if transported with rapture, exclaiming: \"Unhappy Queen!  Yet happiest of women!  No one was ever so ardently beloved; and when the tale is told of the noble Trojan who endured such sore sufferings for a woman's sake, future generations will laud the woman whose resistless spell constrained the greatest man of his day, the hero of heroes, to cast aside victory, fame, and the hope of the world's sovereignty, as mere worthless rubbish.\"  Posterity, whose verdict she dreaded--this wise old reader of the future was right--must extol her as the most fervently beloved, the most desirable of women.  And Mark Antony?  Even had the magic power of Nektanebus's goblet forced him to follow her and to leave the battle, there still remained his will, a copy of which--received from Rome--Zeno, the Keeper of the Seal, had showed to her at the close of the council.  \"Wherever he might die,\" so ran the words, \"he desired to be buried by the side of Cleopatra.\" Octavianus had wrested it from the Vestal Virgins, to whose care it had been entrusted, in order to fill the hearts of Roman citizens and matrons with indignation against his foe.  The plot had succeeded, but the document had reminded Cleopatra that her heart had given this man the first of its flowers, that love for him had been the sunshine of her life.  So, with head erect, she had crossed the threshold where she was to meet the woman who had ventured to sow tares in her garden.  She intended to devote only a short time to the interview, which she anticipated with the satisfaction of the strong who are confident of victory.  As she approached the throne, her train left the hall; the only persons who remained were Charmian, Iras, Zeno, the Keeper of the Seal, and the \"introducer.\"  Cleopatra cast a rapid glance at the throne, to which an obsequious gesture of the courtier's hand invited her; but she remained standing, gazing keenly at Barine.  Was it the coloured rays from the ruby eyes of the dragon in the fireplace which shed the roseate glow on Cleopatra's cheeks?  It certainly enhanced the beauty of a face now only too frequently pallid and colourless, when rouge did not lend its aid; but Barine understood Archibius's ardent admiration for this rare woman, when Cleopatra, with a faint smile, requested her to approach.  Nothing more winning could be imagined than the frank kindness, wholly untinged by condescending pride, of this powerful sovereign.  The less Barine had expected such a reception the more deeply it moved her; nay, her eyes grew dim with grateful emotion, which lent them so beautiful a lustre, she looked so lovely in her glad surprise, that Cleopatra thought the months which had elapsed since her first meeting with the singer had enhanced her charms.  And how young she was!  The Queen swiftly computed the years which Barine must have lived as the wife of Philostratus, and afterwards as the attractive mistress of a hospitable house, and found it difficult to reconcile the appearance of this blooming young creature with the result of the calculation.  She was surprised, too, to note the aristocratic bearing whose possession no one could deny the artist's daughter.  This was apparent even in her dress, yet Iras had roused her in the middle of the night, and certainly had given her no time for personal adornment.  She had expected lack of refinement and boldness, in the woman who was said to have attracted so many men, but even the most bitter prejudice could have detected no trace of it.  On the"]]]
