ALBERICH        Not near enough.       Thine arms around me       Tenderly throw,       That I may fondle       Thy neck with my fingers,       And closely may cling   To thy bosom with love and with longing.  WELLGUNDE        Art thou in love?       For love art thou pining?       Approach and show me       Thy face and thy form.       Fie! thou horrible       Hunchback, for shame!       Swarthy, horny-skinned       Rogue of a dwarf!       Find thou a sweetheart       Fonder than I?  ALBERICH          [_Tries to detain her by force_        I may not be fair,       But fast I can hold!  WELLGUNDE           [_Swimming up quickly to the middle rock._        Hold firm, or I will escape!  WOGLINDE AND FLOSSHILDE [_Laughing._        Ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! ha!  ALBERICH [_Angrily calling after Wellgunde._        Fickle maid!   Bony, cold-blooded fish!       Fair if I seem not,       Pretty and playful       Smooth and sleek--   Hei! if I am so loathsome   Give thy love to the eels!  FLOSSHILDE        What ails thee, dwarf?       Daunted so soon?       Though two have been wooed,       Still a third waits thee,       Solace sweet   Fain at a word to grant!  ALBERICH        Soothing song       Sounds in my ear!       'Twas well I found       Three and not one!   The chance is I charm one of many,   Whilst, single, no one would choose me!       Hither come gliding,       And I will believe!  FLOSSHILDE [_Dives down to Alberich._        How senseless are ye,       Silly sisters,   Not to see he is fair!  ALBERICH [_Hastening towards her._        I well may deem them       Dull and ill-favoured,   Seeing how lovely thou art!  FLOSSHILDE        Sing on! Thy song,       So soft and sweet,   Entrancing sounds in my ear!  ALBERICH [_Caressing her with confidence._        My heart burns       And flutters and fails,   Flattered by praises so sweet!  FLOSSHILDE [_Gently resisting him._        Thy grace and beauty       Make glad my eye;       And thy smile refreshes       My soul like balm          [_She draws him tenderly towards her._        Dearest of men!  ALBERICH        Sweetest of maids!  FLOSSHILDE        Wert thou but mine!  ALBERICH        Wert mine for ever!  FLOSSHILDE [_Ardently._        To be pierced by thy glance,       To be pricked by thy beard,   To see and to feel them for aye!       Might thy hair hard as bristles       Flow ever more   Enraptured Flosshilde wreathing!       And thy form like a frog's,       And the croak of thy voice--       O could I, dumb with amaze,       Marvel forever on these!  WOGLINDE AND WELLGUNDE          [_Dive down close to them and laugh._        Ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! ha!  ALBERICH [_Starting in alarm._        Wretches, dare ye thus scoff?  FLOSSHILDE [_Suddenly darting away from him._        A suitable end to the song.          [_She swims up quickly with her sisters._  WOGLINDE AND WELLGUNDE [_Laughing._        Ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! ha!  ALBERICH [_In a wailing voice._        Woe's me! Ah, woe's me!       Alas! Alas!       The third one, so dear,       Does she too betray?       O sly and shameful   Worthless and dissolute wantons!       Live ye on lies   Alone, O ye false nixie brood?

Faint-hearted wooer,       Why couldst not hold   The maid, when won, more fast?       True are we,       And troth we keep   With lovers when once caught.       Grasp then and hold;       Away with all fear!   In the waves we scarce can escape.       Wallala!   Lalaleia! Leialalei!   Heia! Heia! Ha hei!          [_They swim apart hither and thither, now lower,         now higher, to provoke Alberich to give chase._  [Illustration: Plate 03, The Rhine-Maidens teasing Alberich.]  ALBERICH         Fiercely within me        Passionate fires        Consume and flame!        Love and fury,        Wild, resistless,        Lash me to frenzy!   So laugh and lie your fill--        One of you I desire,        And one must yield to my yearning!          [_He starts chasing them with desperate energy.         He climbs with terrible agility, and, springing         from rock to rock, tries to catch one maiden         after another. They keep eluding him with mocking         laughter. He stumbles and falls into the abyss, and         clambers up quickly again and resumes the chase.         They sink down a little towards him; he almost         reaches them, but falls, back again, and once         more tries to catch them. At last he pauses out         of breath, and, foaming with rage, stretches his         clenched fist up towards the maidens._  ALBERICH        If but this fist had one!          [_He remains speechless with rage, gazing upwards,         when he is suddenly attracted and arrested by the         following spectacle. Through the water a light         of continually increasing brilliance breaks from         above, and, at a point near the top of the middle         rock, kindles to a radiant and dazzling golden         gleam. A magical light streams from this through         the waves._  WOGLINDE        Look, sisters!       The wakener laughs to the deep.  WELLGUNDE        Through the billows green       The blissful slumberer greets.  FLOSSHILDE        He kisses the eyelid,       Making it open;       Bathed in splendour,       Behold it smiles,       Sending, like a star,   Gleaming light through the waves.  THE THREE RHINE-MAIDENS          [_Swimming gracefully round the cliff together._        Heia jaheia!       Heia jaheia!   Wallala la la la leia jahei!       Rhinegold!       Rhinegold!       Radiant delight,   How glorious and glad thy smile,       Over the water   Shooting effulgence afar!       Heia jahei!       Heia jaheia!       Waken, friend!       Wake in joy!       That we may please thee,       Merry we'll play,       Waters afire,       Billows aflame,       As, blissfully bathing,       Dancing and singing,   We dive and encircle thy bed!       Rhinegold!       Rhinegold!       Heia jaheia!       Heia jaheia!   Wallala la la la heia jahei!          [_With increasing mirthful abandonment the maidens         swim round the rock. The water is filled with a         glimmering golden light._  ALBERICH          [_Whose eyes, strongly attracted by the radiance,         stare fixedly at the gold._        What is it, sleek ones,       That yonder gleams and shines?  THE THREE RHINE-MAIDENS        Where dost thou hail from, O churl,       Of the Rhinegold not to have heard?  WELLGUNDE        Knows not the elf       Of the famed eye golden   That wakes and sleeps in turn?  WOGLINDE        Of the star resplendent       Down in the depths   Whose light illumines the waves?  THE THREE RHINE-MAIDENS [_Together_        See how gaily       We glide in the glory!       Wouldst thou also       Be bathed in brightness,   Come, float and frolic with us!   Wallala la la leia lalei!   Wallala la la leia jahei!  ALBERICH        Has the gold no value       Apart from your games?       It were not worth getting!  WOGLINDE        He would not scoff,       Scorning the gold,   Did he but know all its wonders!  WELLGUNDE    That man surely   The earth would inherit       Who from the Rhinegold       Fashioned the ring   Which measureless power imparts.  FLOSSHILDE        Our father told us,       And strictly bade us       Guard with prudence       The precious hoard   That no thief from the water might steal it.   Be still, then, chattering fools.  WELLGUNDE        O prudent sister,       Why chide and reproach?       Hast thou not heard       That one alone   Can hope to fashion the gold?  WOGLINDE        Only the man       Who love defies,       Only the man       From love who flies   Can learn and master the magic   That makes a ring of the gold.  WELLGUNDE        Secure then are we       And free from care:   For love is part of living;   No one would live without loving.  WOGLINDE        And least of all he,       The languishing elf,       With pangs of love       Pining away.  FLOSSHILDE        I fear him not       Who should surely know,       By his savage lust       Almost inflamed.  [Illustration: Plate 04       \"Mock away! Mock away!

Wallaleia la la!       Join in our laughter,       Lovable elf!       In the golden glory       How gallant thy sheen!   O come, lovely one, laugh as we laugh!       Heia jaheia!       Heia jaheia!

If love be beyond me   My cunning could compass delight?          [_In a terribly loud voice._        Mock away! Mock!   The Niblung makes for your toy!          [_Raging he springs on to the middle rock,         and clambers to the top. The maidens scatter,         screaming, and swim upwards on different sides._  THE THREE RHINE MAIDENS    Heia! Heia!heia jahei!       Save yourselves!       The elf is distraught!       Swirling waters splash       At every leap:   The creature's crazy with love!   Ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! ha!

Woe! Woe!          [_The water sinks with them. From the lowest depth         Alberich's shrill, mocking laughter rings up. The         rocks are hidden by impenetrable darkness.

Rescue the gold!     Help us! Help us!     Woe! Woe!\"]     SECOND SCENE   _The waves have gradually changed into clouds which, becoming lighter and lighter by degrees, finally disperse in a fine mist. As the mist vanishes upwards in light little clouds an open space on a mountain height becomes visible in the dim light which precedes dawn. At one side Wotan with Fricka beside him both asleep, lie on a flowery bank. The dawning day illumines with increasing brightness a castle with glittering pinnacles which stands on the summit of a cliff in the background. Between this and the foreground a deep valley is visible through which the Rhine flows._    FRICKA          [_Awakes; her gaze falls on the castle, which has         become plainly visible; alarmed._  WOTAN [_Continuing to dream._    The happy hall of delight   Is guarded by gate and door:       Manhood's honour,       Power for aye,   Rise to my lasting renown!  FRICKA [_Shakes him._        Up from deceitful       Bliss of a dream!   My husband, wake and consider!  WOTAN          [_Awakes and raises himself slightly. His glance is         immediately arrested by the view of the castle._    The walls everlasting are built!       On yonder summit       The Gods' abode       Proudly rears       Its radiant strength!   As I nursed it in dream   And desired it to be,       Strong it stands,       Fair to behold,   Brave and beautiful pile!  FRICKA        While thou rejoicest,       Joyless am I.       Thou hast thy hall;       My heart fears for Freia.   Heedless one, hast thou forgotten   The price that was to be paid?       The work is finished,       And forfeit the pledge:   Hast thou then no care for the cost?  WOTAN    My bargain well I remember   With them who built the abode.       'Twas a pact tamed them,       The obstinate race,       So that this hallowed       Hall they have built me.   It stands--the strong ones' doing:--   Fret not thou, counting the cost.  FRICKA    O laughing, insolent lightness!   Mirth how cruel and callous!   Had I but known of thy pact,   The trick had never been played;       But far from your counsels       Ye men kept the women,   That, deaf to us and in peace,   Alone ye might deal with the giants.       So without shame       Ye promised them Freia,   Freia, my beautiful sister,   Proud of playing the thief.       What remains holy       Or precious to men   Once grown greedy of might?  WOTAN [_Calmly._        From such greed       Was Fricka then free   Herself when the castle she craved?  FRICKA    I was forced to ponder some means   To keep my husband faithful,   True to me when his fancy   Tempted him far from his home.       Halls high and stately,       Decked to delight thee,       Were to constrain thee       To peaceful repose.   But thou hadst the work designed   Intent on war alone;       It was to add       More to thy might still,       To stir up to tumult still fiercer   That built were the towering walls  WOTAN        Wouldst thou, O Wife!       In the castle confine me,   To me, the god, must be granted,       Faithful at home,       The right to wage war   And conquer the world from without.       Ranging and changing       All men love:   That sport at least thou must leave me.  FRICKA        Cold, hard-hearted,       Merciless man!       For the idle baubles,       Empire and sway,   Thou stakest in insolent scorn   Love and a woman's worth!  WOTAN    When I went wooing, to win thee       I staked ungrudging,   Gladly one of my eyes:   What folly now then to scold!       Women I honour       Beyond thy desire!       I will not abandon       Frei, the fair:   Such never was my intent.  FRICKA          [_ Anxiously looking towards a point not on the         stage._        Then succour her now:       Defenceless, in fear,   Hither she hastens for help!  FREIA          [_Enters as if flying from someone._         Help me, sister!        Shield me, o brother!        From yonder mountain        Menaces Fasolt:    He comes to bear me off captive.  WOTAN        Let him come!       Sawest thou Loge?  FRICKA        To this tricky deceiver       O why wilt thou trust?   He always snares thee anew,   Though from his snares thou hast suffered.  WOTAN    I ask for no aid   Where simple truth suffices;       But to turn the spite       Of foes to profit,   Craft and cunning alone   Can teach, as by Loge employed.   He whose advice I obeyed   Has promised ransom for Freia:   On him my faith I have fixed.  FRICKA    And art left in the lurch.       The giants come.       Lo! hither they stride:   Where lingers now thine ally?  FREIA        Where tarry ye, my brothers,       When help ye should bring me,   Weak and bartered away by my kin?       O help me, Donner!       Hither! Hither!   Rescue Freia, my Froh!  FRICKA    Now the knaves who plotted and tricked thee   Abandon thee in thy need.          [_Fasolt and Fafner, both of gigantic stature,         enter, armed with stout clubs._  FASOLT        Soft sleep       Sealed thine eyes       While we, both sleepless,   Built the castle walls:       Working hard       Wearied not,       Heaping, heaving       Heavy stones.       Tower steep,       Door and gate       Keep and guard   Thy goodly castle halls.          [_Pointing to the castle._        There stands       What we builded,       Shining fair       Beneath the sun.       Enter in   And pay the price!  WOTAN    Name, Workers, your wage.   What payment will appease you?  FASOLT    We made the terms   That seemed to us meet.   Hast thou forgot so soon?       Freia, the fair one,       Holda, the free one--       The bargain is   We bear her away.  WOTAN (Quickly.)        Ye must be mad       To moot such a thing!   Ask some other wage;   Freia I will not grant.  FASOLT          _Stands for a space speechless with angry surprise._        What is this? Ha!       Wouldest deceive?--       Go back on thy bond?       What thy spear wards       Are they but sport,   All the runes of solemn bargain?  FAFNER        O trusty brother!   Fool, dost now see the trick?  FASOLT        Son of light,       Light, unstable,   Hearken! Have a care!   In treaties keep thou troth!       What thou art       Thou art only by treaties,       For, built on bonds,   There are bounds to thy might.       Though cunning thou,       More clever than we:       Though we once freemen,       Are pledged to peace,   Cursed be all thy wisdom;--       Peaceful promises perish!--       Wilt thou not open,   Honest and frank   Stand fast by a bargain once fixed.       A stupid giant       Tells thee this:   O wise one, take it from him!  [Illustration: plate 06, Freia, the fair one]  WOTAN    How sly to judge us serious   When plainly we were but jesting!       The beautiful Goddess       Light and bright--   For churls what charm could she have?  FASOLT        Jeerest thou?       Ha! how unjust!   Ye who by beauty rule,   Proud and radiant race!       How foolish, striving       For towers of stone,   Woman's love to pledge--   Price of walls and of halls!   We dolts, despising ease,   Sweating with toil-hardened hands,       Have worked, that a woman       With gentle delight   In our midst might sojourn   And ye call the pact a jest?  FAFNER    Cease thy childish chatter;   No gain look we to get.       Freia's charms       Mean little;   But it means much,   If from the Gods we remove her.       Golden apples   Ripen within her garden;       She alone   Grows the apples and tends them.       The goodly fruit       Gives to her kinsfolk,       Who eat thereof,       Youth everlasting.       Sick and pale,       Their beauty would perish,       Old and weak,       Wasting away,   Were not Freia among them.          [_Roughly._    From their midst, therefore, Freia must forth!  WOTAN [_Aside._        Loge lingers long!  FASOLT        We wait for thy word!  WOTAN        Ask some other wage!  FASOLT        No other: Freia alone!  FAFNER        Thou there, follow us!          [_Fafner and Fasolt press towards Freia. Froh and         Donner enter in haste._  FREIA        Help! Help from the harsh ones!  FROH        To me, Freia!          [_Clasping Freia in his arms._ [_To Fafner._        Back, overbold one!       Froh shields the fair one!  DONNER [_Confronting the giants._        Fasolt and Fafner,       Have ye not felt   With what weight my hammer falls?  FAFNER        What means thy threat?  FASOLT        What wouldst thou here?   No strife we desire;   We want but our due reward.  DONNER        Oft I've doled out       Giants their due:   Come, your reward is here   Waiting, full measure and more!          [_He swings his hammer._  WOTAN          [_Stretching out his spear between the combatants._        Hold, thou fierce one!       Nothing by force!       All bonds and treaties       My spear protects;   Spare then thy hammer's haft!  FREIA        Woe's me! Woe's me!       Wotan forsakes me!  FRICKA        Can such be thy thought,       Merciless man?  WOTAN          [_Turns away and sees Loge coming._         There comes Loge!       Hot is thy haste       Smoothly to settle   Thy sorry, badly-made bargain!  LOGE          [_Has come up out of the valley in the background._        What is this bargain       That I am blamed for?--       The one with the giants   That thou thyself didst decide?
