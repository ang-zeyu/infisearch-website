The matin bell. Bless, Lord, Thy servants!    Give me my crutch.     (Exit.)     GREGORY.         Boris, Boris, before thee    All tremble; none dares even to remind thee    Of what befell the hapless child; meanwhile    Here in dark cell a hermit doth indite    Thy stern denunciation. Thou wilt not    Escape the judgment even of this world,    As thou wilt not escape the doom of God.     FENCE OF THE MONASTERY*          *This scene was omitted by Pushkin from the published         version of the play.     GREGORY and a Wicked Monk     GREGORY. O, what a weariness is our poor life,    What misery! Day comes, day goes, and ever    Is seen, is heard one thing alone; one sees    Only black cassocks, only hears the bell.    Yawning by day you wander, wander, nothing    To do; you doze; the whole night long till daylight    The poor monk lies awake; and when in sleep    You lose yourself, black dreams disturb the soul;    Glad that they sound the bell, that with a crutch    They rouse you. No, I will not suffer it!    I cannot! Through this fence I'll flee! The world    Is great; my path is on the highways never    Thou'lt hear of me again.     MONK.                   Truly your life    Is but a sorry one, ye dissolute,    Wicked young monks!     GREGORY.          Would that the Khan again    Would come upon us, or Lithuania rise    Once more in insurrection. Good! I would then    Cross swords with them! Or what if the tsarevich    Should suddenly arise from out the grave,    Should cry, \"Where are ye, children, faithful servants?    Help me against Boris, against my murderer!    Seize my foe, lead him to me!\"     MONK.                       Enough, my friend,    Of empty babble. We cannot raise the dead.    No, clearly it was fated otherwise    For the tsarevich--But hearken; if you wish    To do a thing, then do it.     GREGORY.                 What to do?     MONK. If I were young as thou, if these grey hairs    Had not already streaked my beard--Dost take me?     GREGORY. Not I.     MONK.        Hearken; our folk are dull of brain,    Easy of faith, and glad to be amazed    By miracles and novelties. The boyars    Remember Godunov as erst he was,    Peer to themselves; and even now the race    Of the old Varyags is loved by all. Thy years    Match those of the tsarevich. If thou hast    Cunning and hardihood--Dost take me now?     GREGORY. I take thee.     MONK.               Well, what say'st thou?     GREGORY.                                 'Tis resolved.    I am Dimitry, I tsarevich!     MONK.                    Give me    Thy hand, my bold young friend. Thou shalt be tsar!     PALACE OF THE PATRIARCH  PATRIARCH, ABBOT of the Chudov Monastery     PATRIARCH. And he has run away, Father Abbot?     ABBOT. He has run away, holy sovereign, now three days ago.     PATRIARCH. Accursed rascal! What is his origin?     ABBOT. Of the family of the Otrepievs, of the lower nobility    of Galicia; in his youth he took the tonsure, no one    knows where, lived at Suzdal, in the Ephimievsky    monastery, departed from there, wandered to various    convents, finally arrived at my Chudov fraternity;    but I, seeing that he was still young and inexperienced,    entrusted him at the outset to Father Pimen, an old man,    kind and humble. And he was very learned, read our    chronicle, composed canons for the holy brethren; but,    to be sure, instruction was not given to him from the    Lord God--     PATRIARCH. Ah, those learned fellows! What a thing to    say, \"I shall be tsar in Moscow.\" Ah, he is a vessel of    the devil! However, it is no use even to report to the    tsar about this; why disquiet our father sovereign?    It will be enough to give information about his flight to    the Secretary Smirnov or the Secretary Ephimiev.    What a heresy: \"I shall be tsar in Moscow!\"...    Catch, catch the fawning villain, and send him to    Solovetsky to perpetual penance. But this--is it not    heresy, Father Abbot?     ABBOT. Heresy, holy Patriarch; downright heresy.     PALACE OF THE TSAR  Two Attendants     1ST ATTENDANT. Where is the sovereign?     2ND ATTENDANT.                  In his bed-chamber,    Where he is closeted with some magician.     1ST ATTENDANT. Ay; that's the kind of intercourse he loves;    Sorcerers, fortune-tellers, necromancers.    Ever he seeks to dip into the future,    Just like some pretty girl. Fain would I know    What 'tis he would foretell.     2ND ATTENDANT.             Well, here he comes.    Will it please you question him?     1ST ATTENDANT.                How grim he looks!     (Exeunt.)     TSAR. (Enters.) I have attained the highest power. Six years    Already have I reigned in peace; but joy    Dwells not within my soul. Even so in youth    We greedily desire the joys of love,    But only quell the hunger of the heart    With momentary possession. We grow cold,    Grow weary and oppressed! In vain the wizards    Promise me length of days, days of dominion    Immune from treachery--not power, not life    Gladden me; I forebode the wrath of Heaven    And woe. For me no happiness. I thought    To satisfy my people in contentment,    In glory, gain their love by generous gifts,    But I have put away that empty hope;    The power that lives is hateful to the mob,--    Only the dead they love. We are but fools    When our heart vibrates to the people's groans    And passionate wailing. Lately on our land    God sent a famine; perishing in torments    The people uttered moan. The granaries    I made them free of, scattered gold among them,    Found labour for them; furious for my pains    They cursed me! Next, a fire consumed their homes;    I built for them new dwellings; then forsooth    They blamed me for the fire! Such is the mob,    Such is its judgment! Seek its love, indeed!    I thought within my family to find    Solace; I thought to make my daughter happy    By wedlock. Like a tempest Death took off    Her bridegroom--and at once a stealthy rumour    Pronounced me guilty of my daughter's grief--    Me, me, the hapless father! Whoso dies,    I am the secret murderer of all;    I hastened Feodor's end, 'twas I that poisoned    My sister-queen, the lowly nun--all I!    Ah! Now I feel it; naught can give us peace    Mid worldly cares, nothing save only conscience!    Healthy she triumphs over wickedness,    Over dark slander; but if in her be found    A single casual stain, then misery.    With what a deadly sore my soul doth smart;    My heart, with venom filled, doth like a hammer    Beat in mine ears reproach; all things revolt me,    And my head whirls, and in my eyes are children    Dripping with blood; and gladly would I flee,    But nowhere can find refuge--horrible!    Pitiful he whose conscience is unclean!     TAVERN ON THE LITHUANIAN FRONTIER  MISSAIL and VARLAAM, wandering friars; GREGORY in secular attire; HOSTESS     HOSTESS. With what shall I regale you, my reverend    honoured guests?     VARLAAM. With what God sends, little hostess. Have you    no wine?     HOSTESS. As if I had not, my fathers! I will bring it at    once. (Exit.)     MISSAIL. Why so glum, comrade? Here is that very    Lithuanian frontier which you so wished to reach.     GREGORY. Until I shall be in Lithuania, till then I shall not    Be content.     VARLAAM. What is it that makes you so fond of Lithuania!    Here are we, Father Missail and I, a sinner, when we fled    from the monastery, then we cared for nothing. Was it    Lithuania, was it Russia, was it fiddle, was it dulcimer?    All the same for us, if only there was wine. That's the    main thing!     MISSAIL. Well said, Father Varlaam.     HOSTESS. (Enters.)    There you are, my fathers. Drink to your health.     MISSAIL. Thanks, my good friend. God bless thee. (The    monks drink. Varlaam trolls a ditty: \"Thou passest    by, my dear,\" etc.) (To GREGORY) Why don't you join    in the song? Not even join in the song?     GREGORY. I don't wish to.     MISSAIL. Everyone to his liking--     VARLAAM. But a tipsy man's in Heaven.* Father Missail!    We will drink a glass to our hostess. (Sings: \"Where    the brave lad in durance,\" etc.) Still, Father Missail,    when I am drinking, then I don't like sober men; tipsiness    is one thing--but pride quite another. If you want    to live as we do, you are welcome. No?--then take    yourself off, away with you; a mountebank is no    companion for a priest.          [*The Russian text has here a play on the words which cannot         be satisfactorily rendered into English.]     GREGORY. Drink, and keep your thoughts to yourself,*    Father Varlaam! You see, I too sometimes know how    to make puns.          [*The Russian text has here a play on the words which cannot         be satisfactorily rendered into English.]     VARLAAM. But why should I keep my thoughts to myself?     MISSAIL. Let him alone, Father Varlaam.     VARLAAM. But what sort of a fasting man is he? Of his    own accord he attached himself as a companion to us;    no one knows who he is, no one knows whence he comes--    and yet he gives himself grand airs; perhaps he has a    close acquaintance with the pillory. (Drinks and sings:    \"A young monk took the tonsure,\" etc.)     GREGORY. (To HOSTESS.) Whither leads this road?     HOSTESS. To Lithuania, my dear, to the Luyov mountains.     GREGORY. And is it far to the Luyov mountains?     HOSTESS. Not far; you might get there by evening, but for    the tsar's frontier barriers, and the captains of the    guard.     GREGORY. What say you? Barriers! What means this?     HOSTESS. Someone has escaped from Moscow, and orders    have been given to detain and search everyone.     GREGORY. (Aside.) Here's a pretty mess!     VARLAAM. Hallo, comrade!"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50890"],["title","The Birds of Lorrane (#1)"],["body","ciously. They rolled over and over in the sand. Ingomar threw a switch that gave him communication outside the ship, and yelled at them.  They stopped fighting at once. He said, \"Have you two lost your minds?\"  Pisces II laughed. \"Now how could one lose his mind? It goes with him everywhere.\"  \"All right,\" Ingomar said. \"I meant, have you become insane?\"  \"Of course not,\" Pisces I said. \"We are peaceful entities. We intentionally developed this argument to break the monotony of life here.\"  \"Is it so bad as that?\"  \"It is terrible. Will you take us aboard?\"  Ingomar did not answer, but switched the communicator off and busied himself with recording his observations. He took advantage of their continued presence and took photographs.  Finally, after several hours, they leapt into the air and flew away toward the distant mountains. Ingomar was sorry to see them leave, and more than once checked his instruments for signs of a coming storm in case they were right. But nothing outside had changed.  After they had left he opened the ship and stepped outside, taking readings with instruments to record the character of the planet. He trudged through the eternally drifting sand, looking for some sign of life. No plants, insects, animals anywhere. Only the fine, mobile sand, occasionally an outcropping of rock not yet eroded away. And the heat! Ingomar was forced to turn the controls of his environment suit almost all the way up to keep comfortable. Then, when the sun receded behind the ghostly barren mountains, the cold came creeping in. Ingomar turned his controls in the other direction, while walking back to his ship. He was afraid he would not keep the cold outside.  The landscape, with the sun's absence, was dark and fearful. Shadows moved in the wind, shadows of drifting sand that took on the shapes of monsters lurking in the darkness. Ingomar was not one to frighten easily, but the night took on such ominous sighs and moans and movements that his imagination began to magnify them beyond recognition. When he finally saw the ship loom up before him he ran, stumbling toward it. He fumbled in the darkness for the control knob to open the lock and found it at last. He leapt inside, accompanied by a cold blast of wind and sand, and stood there panting, hearing his heart pound in his ears.  The night was long and lonely. He was too far from civilization for his radio equipment to bring the comfort of familiar sounds. He tried to read, but found concentration impossible. He thought of the birds, wondering where they were now, how they kept from freezing to death at night. He rewrote his notes, adding remembered facts and impressions. Finally he decided sleep was the most painless way of spending the night, and swallowed a small capsule designed to induce total sleep for at least six hours.         *       *       *       *       *  He awoke the next morning standing on his head.  The bed, horizontal the night before, was now vertical. The whole room was vertical. Panic swept over him like a wave of burning fire. He scrambled to the airlock. It opened grotesquely.  The ship, which last night had stood so proudly, now lay on its side. And in his drugged sleep he had not known when it fell. For Ingomar, the bottom dropped out of everything, and his heart dropped with it. There was no resetting of a ship once it had fallen. This took special equipment. Ingomar Bjorgson was a doomed man, and he knew it.  While he stood outside in the morning sun, staring at the horrible spectacle before him, the two birds alighted, one on each side.  \"Why didn't you listen to us?\" Pisces I said in an accusing tone.  \"Yes,\" Pisces II echoed angrily. \"You make me sick, thinking you're so smart, coming down here in your big ship and strutting around like you think you're a God, or something. Now, how big do you feel? Do you realize that this is our first opportunity to leave this planet? I've a good notion to peck your stupid eyes out right here and now.\"  \"Leave him be,\" Pisces I said. \"He may not be so bright, but I think he would have taken us with him, after he got used to us and saw how harmless we are.\"  Pisces II leapt at him, almost knocking Ingomar off his feet. \"Shut up! I've a good notion to peck your eyes out, too.\"  \"Oh, stop it!\" Ingomar said wearily. \"We're all doomed to spend the rest of our lives here. How was I to know that the storm would be so bad? My instruments gave no indication whatever.\"  \"Actually, it was our fault,\" Pisces II said, more calmly. \"We failed to mention the nature of the storm. We thought you knew. It was a magnetic storm. A shifting of magnetic currents surrounding the planet. We had no idea that you would think of the weather.\"  They walked with him around the fallen ship. It was not injured, that much Ingomar could see. The soft bed of sand had cushioned its fall. If it could only be righted! Ingomar knew it was impossible.  \"It is pointed toward that knoll out there. See? Suppose we all got inside and blasted off. We would slide along and maybe when we reached the knoll we'd have enough speed to keep on going in a straight line until we could point her nose upward.\"  Ingomar shook his head, but he appreciated the suggestion. It indicated that they were willing to try anything. He knew their motives were not entirely philanthropic, but he liked them more for it, anyway.  He said, \"There is only one way out, and that is for someone to come in and get us.\"  \"Well,\" Pisces II said, \"What are you waiting for? Call them.\"  \"I can't. We are too far out for communication.\"  The two gray birds eyed one another in disbelief. Pisces I scratched his breast impolitely. Then he said, \"Are you telling us that you have come this far from your own solar system, knowing that you could not call for help, if necessary?\"  Ingomar nodded.         *       *       *       *       *  Pisces II snorted through his beak, and scratched in the sand. \"Stupidity,\" he said. \"There is no other word for it.\"  \"Yes, there is,\" Pisces I answered, somewhat sharply. \"In fact, there are several possible words. Bravery. Desperation. Actually I think it is a combination of both. I am sure that you are aware how rare intelligent life is in the universe. When you heard of us, you rushed out here at once. I would call it bravery to go beyond the sound of the voices of your kind. You are desperate because you are lonely in an almost empty universe.\"  \"We must help him,\" said Pisces II.  \"Of course. But first let's make him comfortable. It will be a long wait.\"  \"Thank you,\" Ingomar said, moved by their sympathy. \"But you cannot help. Or do you have a way to send messages?\"  \"Yes, in a way,\" Pisces II said, \"You see....\"  Pisces I lifted a huge wing and knocked Pisces II in the sand. He turned to Ingomar. \"Do you promise to take us with you, if we should succeed in getting help?\"  Ingomar did not think it over. \"Yes,\" he said.  \"Then we will do it. But first we must make you comfortable. Do you have equipment for shelter, besides the ship?\"  \"Yes, there is the bubble. It can be expanded to become a house.\"  \"Get it,\" Pisces II said.  Ingomar did. He dragged it outside and began to unfold it, in preparation for inflation. But Pisces II stopped him. \"Not here,\" he said. \"It will be a long time. Our calculation is that it will take at least forty-five days to get help. The trip from your planet alone is at least forty days. You will not wish to stare at your toppled ship for so long. I suggest we go beyond the first knoll.\"  Pisces I laughed and said to Ingomar, \"For once he is using his brain. We will carry it.\"  He grasped the bubble in his claws, flapped his enormous wings and sailed off. Soon he returned, and among the three of them all his food and books and any equipment he might need was carried over the knoll out of sight of the wrecked ship.  \"We will not return,\" they said, \"until the rescue ship arrives. So make yourself comfortable. Do not stray too far from the ship. This is the most miserable planet in the universe. Give us plenty of time. We know we can summon help, but we do not know how long it will take. We may need as many as seventy-five days.\"  Ingomar settled down to wait.         *       *       *       *       *  The fierce, burning sun had turned Ingomar's face and naked arms into fried areas of intense pain, but he regained consciousness when he felt the coolness of the ointment. It penetrated deep down, under the burned skin, into flesh and muscle, soothing injured cells.  He opened his eyes. He moved his head. The eyes were burned and bloodshot, but he could see a ship standing a hundred feet away. It was not sleek and long, pointing its needle nose at the sky, though. It was round, dull white, like a giant egg laid by a giant bird.  Bird? Ingomar chuckled, senses returning, thinking through his pain of Pisces I or Pisces II laying an egg. Then he laughed aloud.  He stopped, quite abruptly, and looked again. The egg was still there, but it was not an egg. It was actually a ship and the airlock was open and Pisces II was backing out, dragging a sort of stretcher on wheels.  \"It's a ... a ... ship!\" he exclaimed, tears running down his cheeks, over the ointment. \"Whose ship is it?\"  \"Ours,\" said Pisces I.  \"Yours?\" Ingomar said, after a long pause while the pain raged over his skin. He tried to sit up, and Pisces I got behind him and pushed, nudging him upright. \"Where did you get it?\"  \"Oh,\" Pisces II interrupted. \"We had it all the time.\"  \"Shut up!\" Pisces I yelled. \"He asked me.\"  \"Hold your tongue,\" Pisces II retorted hotly, \"or I'll take off and leave you here. I've had enough of you in the past century to last a lifetime.\"  Pisces I said to Ingomar, \"Pay no attention to that peasant.\" He helped Pisces II push the stretcher next to Ingomar. Then he pushed a lever and the stretcher reduced itself to ground height. It was too short for Ingomar's body, having been designed for the body of a bird. \"He's right, though,\""]]]
