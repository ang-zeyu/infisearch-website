Nathan Gripp frowned. He cared very little about his clerk, but he resented any want of respect to himself. He felt that the balance at his bankers was large enough to insure him a high degree of consideration from his work-people at least.  \"How many vests are there?\" he asked.  \"Half a dozen.\"  \"And the boy wants his pay, I suppose.\"  \"He hasn't asked for it, but he will. They always do.\"  \"Tell him we only pay when a full dozen are finished and brought in. We'll credit him, or his mother, with these.\"  \"That'll pay them off,\" thought the astute clothing merchant.  Samuel received this order with inward satisfaction, and went back smiling.  \"Well, young feller,\" said he, \"it's all right. The vests ain't over-well done, but we'll keep 'em. Now you can go.\"  But Dan did not move.  \"It seems to me you've forgotten something,\" he said.  \"What's that?\"  \"You haven't paid me for the work.\"  \"It's all right. We'll pay when the next half dozen are brought in. Will you take 'em now?\"  Dan was disagreeably surprised. This was entirely out of the usual course, and he knew very well that the delay would be a great inconvenience.  \"We've always been paid when we brought in work,\" he said.  \"We've changed our rule,\" said the clerk, nonchalantly. \"We only pay when a full dozen are brought in.\"  \"What difference does it make to you? We need the money, and can't wait.\"  \"It's my orders, young feller. It's what Mr. Gripp just told me.\"  \"Then I'll speak to him,\" said Dan, promptly.  \"Just as you like.\"  Dan approached the proprietor of the establishment.  \"Mr. Gripp,\" said he, \"I've just brought in half a dozen vests, but your clerk here won't pay me for them.\"  \"You will get your pay, young man, when you bring in another half dozen.\"  \"But, Mr. Gripp, we need the money. We haven't got a big bank account. Our rent is due to-morrow.\"  \"Is it, indeed? I don't see how that concerns me.\"  \"Will you pay me to-night as a favor?\" pleaded Dan, humbling himself for his mother's sake.  \"I can't break over my rule,\" said Nathan Gripp. \"Besides, Samuel says the work isn't very well done.\"  \"Then he lies!\" exclaimed Dan, provoked.  \"Do you hear that, Mr. Gripp?\" ejaculated the angry Samuel, his tallowy complexion putting on a faint flush. \"Didn't I tell you he was impudent?\"  Nathan Gripp's small black eyes snapped viciously.  \"Boy,\" said he, \"leave my store directly. How dare you address me in such a way, you young tramp?\"  \"I'm no more a tramp than yourself,\" retorted Dan, now thoroughly angry.  \"Samuel, come here, and put out this boy!\" exclaimed Nathan, too dignified to attempt the task himself.  Samuel advanced, nothing loth, his fishy eyes gleaming with pleasure.  \"Get out, you vagabond!\" he exclaimed, in the tone of authority.  \"You're a couple of swindlers!\" exclaimed Dan. \"You won't pay for honest work.\"  \"Out with him, Samuel!\" ordered Gripp.  Samuel seized Dan by the shoulder, and attempted to obey orders, but our hero doubled him up with a blow from his fist, and the luckless clerk, faint and gasping, staggered and nearly fell.  Dan stepped out on the sidewalk, and raising his hat, said, with mock politeness, \"Good-morning, gentlemen!\" and walked away, leaving Gripp and his assistant speechless with anger.  [Illustration: \"You're a couple of swindlers!\" exclaimed Dan. \"You won't pay for honest work.\" Page 30.]     CHAPTER IV.  AN ODD COUPLE.   When Dan's excitement was over, he felt that he had won a barren victory. He had certainly been badly treated, and was justified in yielding to his natural indignation; but for all that he had acted unwisely.  Nathan Gripp had not refused payment, he had only postponed it, and as he had the decided advantage, which money always has when pitted against labor, it would have been well to have been conciliatory. Now Gripp would undoubtedly annoy him with further delay, and refuse to give Mrs. Mordaunt any further work.  \"I suppose I've acted like a fool,\" said Dan to himself, with compunction. \"My spunk is always getting the better of me, and I am afraid poor mother will have to suffer. Well, there's no use crying for spilt milk; I must see what I can do to mend matters.\"  While these thoughts were passing through Dan's mind he found himself passing the clothing establishment of Jackson & Co., who were special rivals of Mr. Gripp.  \"Perhaps I can get some work for mother here,\" thought Dan. \"I'll try, at any rate.\"  He entered, and looking about him, attracted the attention of a clerk.  \"Do you want something in our line to-day?\" asked the clerk, pleasantly.  \"Yes, I do,\" said Dan, \"if you're giving things away; but as I've got a note of ten thousand dollars to meet to-morrow, I can't pay anything out.\"  \"Your credit ought to be good,\" said the salesman, smiling, \"but we don't trust.\"  \"All right,\" said Dan; \"I may as well proceed to business. My mother makes vests for amusement. Can you give her any work?\"  \"I will speak to Mr. Jackson. One of our hands is sick, and if your mother understands how to do the work, we may be able to give her some.\"  The young man went to the rear of the store, and returned with the proprietor.  \"Has your mother any experience?\" asked the proprietor, a big man, with sandy whiskers.  He was an Englishman, as any one might see, and a decided improvement on Nathan Gripp, whom he cordially hated.  \"Yes, sir; she has been making vests for the last two years.\"  \"For whom has she been working?\"  \"For Nathan Gripp.\"  \"Humph! Has Gripp discharged her?\"  \"No, sir; she has discharged him.\"  Mr. Jackson laughed, and nodded to his salesman. He rather enjoyed this allusion to his rival.  \"Then she didn't like Gripp?\"  \"No, sir. He paid her starvation wages and made her wait for the money. He's a mean fellow.\"  \"I don't admire him much myself,\" said the Englishman. \"How much now did he pay for vest-making?\"  \"Twenty cents apiece.\"  \"We don't pay much more ourselves. There is so much competition that we have to sell low.\"  \"Mother would rather make for you at eighteen cents than for Gripp for twenty,\" said Dan.  Mr. Jackson was pleased, but he said, by way of drawing out Dan:  \"How do you know but I am a mean skinflint, too?\"  \"You don't look like one,\" said the boy.  Mr. Jackson smiled graciously.  \"Joseph,\" said he, \"have we any vests ready for making?\"  \"Yes, sir. We have some bundles of half a dozen each.\"  \"Take this boy's name and address and give him one. My boy, we will pay your mother twenty-five cents each, but we expect good work.\"  \"You will be satisfied, sir,\" said Dan, confidently, and he left the store in excellent spirits.  \"It's turned out right, after all,\" thought he; \"but I am afraid we shall miss the money old Gripp owed mother. I don't know how we are going to pay the rent to-morrow. We shall be over two dollars short unless something turns up.\"  Dan carried the bundle of work home, and told his mother what had happened. She was pleased with the increase of pay, but that was in the future. It would be a week before she could collect any pay from Jackson & Co., and the landlord would not wait.  \"I wish I could think of some way of raising money,\" said Dan, putting his face between his hands and looking thoughtful. \"If you only had some jewels, mother, that we could raise money on now, we would be all right.\"  \"I have nothing but my wedding-ring,\" said Mrs. Mordaunt, sadly.  \"You must keep that, mother. Don't part with that unless you are obliged to.\"  \"I would rather not, Dan, but if there is no other way----\"  \"There must be another way. I will find another way. Just don't think of it any more, mother. When does the landlord come?\"  \"Generally between twelve and one.\"  \"Then we shall have all the forenoon to forage round in. It's only two dollars and a half we want. I ought to be able to raise two dollars and a half.\"  \"That is a great deal of money to us now, Dan.\"  \"I wonder whether Shorty wouldn't lend it to me?\" said Dan, reflectively.  \"Who is Shorty, my son?\"  \"He is a little hump-backed dwarf that keeps a cigar stand down on Broadway, not far from Trinity Church. He has a good trade, and doesn't waste his money. Yes, I will ask Shorty.\"  \"I hope he will be willing to grant your request, Dan.\"  \"I hope so, too. He's a good-natured fellow, Shorty is, and he'll do it, if he can. I'll see him the first thing to-morrow morning.\"  Somewhat cheered by Dan's confident tone, Mrs. Mordaunt went to sleep as early as usual, forgetting the trouble possibly in store.  The next morning, before selling his papers, Dan went round to Shorty's stand.  \"Good-morning, Dan,\" said the dwarf, in a singularly melodious voice.  \"Good-morning, Shorty. I thought I'd find you here.\"  \"Yes, I begin business early.\"  \"I am going to ask a favor of you,\" said Dan, abruptly.  \"What is it, Dan?\"  \"Our rent's due to-day, and we are two dollars and a half short. I can make the fifty cents before noon. Can you lend me two dollars till I am able to pay it?\"  To Dan's dismay Shorty shook his head.  \"I wish I could, Dan, but there's something in the way.\"  \"If you're afraid I won't pay you back, you needn't think of that. I never went back on a fellow that lent me money yet.\"  \"I am not afraid of trusting you, Dan, but I haven't got the money.\"  \"I understand,\" said Dan, coldly, for he suspected this to be a subterfuge.  \"No, you don't understand,\" said Shorty, eagerly. \"You think what I say is a sham, but you wouldn't if you"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53346"],["title","The Analogy of Religion to the Constitution and Course of Nature (#1)"],["body","he never was a Papist, is now so evident, that we can account for the imputation only by the strong jealousy of the Romish Church then prevalent.  Butler now became still more munificent. His private charities were exceedingly generous, and his public ones seemed sometimes to border on extravagance. He gave $2,000 a year to the county hospital, and often gave away thousands of dollars at a time. But though quite lavish in buildings and ornaments, as well as in benevolence, he was remarkably frugal in his personal expenses. It is said of him, by Rev. John Newton, that on one occasion, when a distinguished visitor dined with him by appointment, the provision consisted of a single joint of meat, and a pudding. The bishop remarked to his guest on that occasion, that he “had long been disgusted with the fashionable expense of time and money in entertainments, and was determined that it should receive no countenance from his example.”  Of his amusements we know little except that he took much horseback exercise, and often employed his secretary, Mr. Emms, to play for him on the organ.  Butler held the see of Durham less than two years. Symptoms of general physical decay betrayed themselves about the time of his promotion, and in spite of all that skill and affection could prompt, he sunk to rest June 16th, 1752, aged sixty. He was never married.  A considerable number of his sermons and charges have been printed, but are too philosophical to be generally read. His great work is the Analogy, published in 1736, and from that day read and admired by every highly-cultivated mind. He was induced to write by a state of things very remarkable in the history of religion. Debauchery and infidelity were almost universal, not in any one class of society but in all. England had reached the culminating point of irreligion, and the firm re-establishment of Episcopacy had as yet done nothing to mend the nation’s morals. Piety was deemed a mark of ignorance and vulgarity, and multitudes of those who professed it were persecuted to dungeons and death.  Infidel writers, warmed into life by court corruption, became more numerous and audacious than ever before. Their methods of attacking Christianity were various; but the most successful then, as always, was to impugn certain doctrines and declarations of the Sacred Scriptures, as irrational, and hence reject the whole. They generally admitted the Being and perfection of God, and extolled the sufficiency of natural religion; but denied any revelation, or any necessity for one. The verdict of the world was that the Bible is not authentic, that man is not accountable, nor even probably immortal, that God neither rewards nor punishes, and that present indulgence, as far as our nature admits, is both wise and safe.  Bishop Downam,[2] one of the most learned of the clergy, in the early part of the seventeenth century writes thus: “In these times, if a man do but labor to keep a good conscience, though he meddle not with matters of state, if he make conscience of swearing, sanctify the Sabbath, frequent sermons, or abstain from the common corruptions of the times, he shall straightway be condemned for a puritan, and be less favored than either a carnal gospeller, or a close Papist.”  It was considered settled, especially in polite circles, that Christianity, after so long a prevalence, had been found out to be an imposture. The clergy, as a body, did nothing to dispel this moral gloom, but rather increased it by their violent and scandalous conduct. In the sad language of Bishop Warburton, “Religion had lost its hold on the minds of the people.” He adds with great point, “Though a _rule of right_ may direct the philosopher to a principle of action; and the _point of honor_ may keep up the thing called manners, among gentlemen: yet nothing but _religion_ can ever fix a sober standard of behavior among the common people.” Even the universities were on the side of irreligion; for professorships, as well as pulpits, were given to men, not for positive worth and fitness, but for possessing qualities then most in vogue with those who held the appointing power. Such were the trying times which had driven our pilgrim fathers to seek a home amid the wilds of an unexplored continent, and to face the dangers of sea and savage.  It must ever be regarded as among the highest instances of God’s bringing good out of evil, that this outrageous rampancy of infidelity brought out a host of champions for the truth of His word; who boldly met the odium of discipleship, and waged battle in such style that the Deistical controversy was settled forever. Never was a dispute more determined on both sides, and never was victory more complete. Literary infidelity not only recoiled, but was routed; and can never again prevail. Henceforth, no _scholar_ will ever treat the evidences of Christianity as a subject of ridicule or contempt.  When we contrast the stupendous learning, and powerful logic, of the Christian writers of that century, with the superficial and almost contemptible productions of the writers against whom they contended, we are tempted to wonder why such power should be requisite to overthrow such weakness. But we must remember, that frail logic and shallow considerations, will persuade men to indulge their vices; while the soundest reasonings and the most impressive inducements, with difficulty lead them to self-restraint and true holiness.  The infidel writers of that day have sunk into such oblivion that their works are now seldom found but in great libraries; and even well-educated persons scarcely know more of them than their names. Yet so perfectly did their principles accord with the temper of the times and the universal depravity of the carnal heart, that they enjoyed the highest popularity with all classes. Forever honored be the names of that noble band, who, in face of such odds, established the authority of the Bible, and left the advocates of atheism and immorality without a lurking-place.[3] In this noble cohort Butler stands conspicuous: and to him, I think, more than to all the others, is to be attributed the sudden and total overthrow of infidelity, when it was in its glory.  As a metaphysician, few have equalled him. What he added to the science, has ever since remained a part of it, which can be said of scarcely another. He advanced more that was new, fortified old positions more ably, and applied speculation to religion more usefully than any before him. Our language furnishes no profounder thinking. Merely to understand him is an honorable distinction, and requires no small previous training of the power of attention. As a polemic, he is keen, sagacious, candid, patient, persevering, calm, inventive, and profound: every page indicates that repose of mind, which belongs only to true greatness, combined with a full knowledge of the subject. So far as I am able to judge, he never presses a consideration beyond its just limits, and seldom introduces an illustration which has not the force of an argument. Fallacies he seems to abolish at a touch.  The Analogy employed much of his life. It was begun in his twentieth year, but was not published till he was forty-five. Such a mode of writing never makes large books, for the matter, constantly revised, becomes constantly condensed. The Analogy is so condensed, as that to make a satisfactory synopsis is scarcely practicable. Hence, though my Conspectus and notes have aided my pupils to understand and remember the argument, they do not in any measure obviate the necessity of studying the book itself. If they do not increase the number of those who shall studiously peruse the book itself, my aim and expectations will be disappointed.  To this work no reply has ever been attempted! Extensive as is its diffusion, and great as is its acknowledged influence, infidelity has had the highest inducements to attempt to set it aside. Written for a present purpose, and most signally accomplishing it, it is yet so written as to endure, in full value, through all coming time. It is undoubtedly “the most original and the most profound work extant, in any language, on the philosophy of religion,”[4] “the most argumentative and philosophical defence of Christianity ever submitted to the world.”[5]  Writers in defence of Christianity had, before Butler, amply discussed the several departments of evidences; but still there remained objections. The structure of the globe, the course of nature, the organization of animals, &c. were affirmed to contradict revelation. Its doctrines and duties, moreover, were pronounced inconsistent with sound reason. Butler repeats none of the old arguments, but confines himself to the showing that the declarations of revelation are in perfect harmony with facts seen daily in the world, and which all admit. That the world might not have been ordered and governed otherwise, he does not choose to dispute. Taking things as they are, and closely studying the connection between one thing and another, we ought to inquire what course of action on our part, will conform to the needs of such a nature and such circumstances. Our bodies are constructed of parts, all adapted to each other, and also to one general end. So too, our souls. And the two together have relations and adaptations, which may, to some extent at least, indicate what is designed to be the _general_ end of our existence. If Christianity befits these several parts of our mixed nature and their obvious uses, then there is nothing incongruous between the two; and no objections against Christianity can be drawn from the course of nature. On the contrary, all seems to be governed as the gospel declares it is, and shows that the Author of man and the Author of the Bible is the same. This is still more impressive when we consider that we have a _moral faculty_; for it is the very object and business of this faculty to deal with right and wrong, good and evil; the facts and"]]]
