Permanent U-E status, a hundred thousand credits a year and, of course, on Damorlan you'd be on an expense account; our money's no good there. By the time you got back, there'd be about a million and a half waiting for you, with interest. You could buy all the instruments and tape all the music you wanted. And, if the Musicians' Guild puts up a fuss, you could buy it, too. Don't let anybody kid you about the wheel, son; money was mankind's first significant invention.\"  \"But ten years. That's a long time away from home.\"  \"Home is where the heart is, and you wanting to see your own planet go up in a puff of smoke--why, even an ilf wouldn't say a thing like that!\" Spano shook his head. \"That's too detached for me to understand. You'll find the years will pass quickly on Damorlan. You'll have stimulating work to do; every moment will be a challenge. When it's all over, you'll be only thirty-eight--the very prime of life. You won't have aged even that much, because you'll be entitled to longevity treatments at regular intervals.  \"So think it over, m'boy.\" He rose waveringly and clapped Clarey on the shoulder. \"And take the rest of the afternoon off; I'll fix it with Archives. We wouldn't want you coming back from Classification intoxicated.\" He winked. \"Make a very bad impression on your co-workers.\"  Han masked herself and escorted Clarey to the restaurant portway. \"Don't believe everything he says. But I think you'd better accept the offer.\"  \"I don't have to,\" Clarey said.  \"No,\" she agreed, \"you don't. But you'd better.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Clarey took the cheap underground route home. His antiseptic little two-room apartment seemed even bleaker than usual. He dialed a dyspep pill from the auto-spensor; the lunch was beginning to tell on him. And that evening he couldn't even take an interest in _Sentries of the Sky_, which, though he'd never have admitted it, was his favorite program. He had no friends; nobody would miss him if he left Earth or died or anything. The general's right, he thought; I might as well be an alien on an alien planet. At least I'll be paid better. And he wondered whether, in lighter gravity, his spirits might not get a lift.  He dragged himself to work the next day. He found someone did care after all. \"Well, Sub-Archivist Clarey,\" Chief Section Archivist MacFingal snarled, \"I would have expected to see more sparkle in your eye, more pep in your step, after a whole day of nothing but sweet rest.\"  \"But--but General Spano said it would be all right if I didn't report back in the afternoon.\"  \"Oh, it is all right, Sub-Archivist, no question of that. How could I dare to complain about a man who has such powerful friends? I suppose if I gave you the Sagittarius files to reorganize, you'd go running to your friend General Spano, sniveling about cruel and unfair treatment.\"  So Clarey started reorganizing the Sagittarius files--a sickeningly dull task which should by rights have gone to a junior archivist. All morning he couldn't help thinking about Damorlan--its invigorating atmosphere, its pleasant climate, its presumed absence of archives and archivists. During his lunchstop he looked up the planet in the files. There was only a small part of a tape on it. There might be more in the Classified Files. It was, of course, forbidden to view secretapes without a direct order from the Chief Archivist, but the tapes were locked by the same code as the rare editions. After all, he told himself, I have a legitimate need for the information.  So he punched for Damorlan in the secret files. He put the tape in the viewer. He saw the natives. Cold shock filled him, and then hot fury. They were humanoid all right--pallid, pale-haired creatures. Objective viewpoint, he thought furiously; detachment be damned! I was picked _because I look like one of them_!  He was wrenched away from the viewer. \"Sub-Archivist Clarey, what is the meaning of this?\" Chief Section Archivist MacFingal demanded. \"You know what taking a secretape out without permission means?\"  Clarey knew. The reorientation machine. \"Ask General Spano,\" he said in a constricted voice. \"He'll tell you it's all right.\"         *       *       *       *       *  General Spano said that it was, indeed, all right. \"I'm so glad to hear you've decided to join us. Splendid career for an enterprising young man. Smoke-stick?\"  Clarey refused; he no longer had any interest in trying one.  \"Don't look so grim,\" Spano said jovially. \"You'll like the Damorlanti once you get to know them. Very affectionate people. Haven't had any major wars for several generations. Currently there are just a few skirmishes at the poles and you ought to be able to keep away from those easily. And they'll simply love you.\"  \"But I don't like anyone,\" Clarey said. \"And I don't see why the Damorlanti should like me,\" he added fairly.  \"I'll tell you why! Because it'll be your job to _make_ them like you. You've got to be friendly and outgoing if it kills you. Anyone can develop a winning personality if he sets his mind to it. I though you said you watched the tri-dis!\"  \"I--I don't always watch the commercials,\" Clarey admitted.  \"Oh, well, we all have our little failings.\" Spano leaned forward, his voice now pitched to persuasive decibels. \"Normally, of course, you wouldn't stoop to hypocrisy to gain friends, and quite right, too--people should accept you as you are or they wouldn't be worthy of becoming your friends. But this is different. You have to be what they want, because you want something from them. You'll have to suffer rebuffs and humiliations and never show resentment.\"  \"In other words,\" Clarey said, \"a secret agent is supposed to forget all about such concepts as self-respect.\"  \"If necessary, yes. But here self-respect doesn't enter into it. These aren't people and they don't really matter. You wouldn't be humiliated, would you, if you tried to pat a dog and it snarled at you?\"  \"Steff, he's got to think of them as people until he's definitely given them a clean bill of health,\" Han Vollard protested. \"Otherwise, the whole thing won't work.\"  \"Well,\" the general temporized, \"think of them as people, then, but as inferior people. Let them snoop and pry and sneer. Always, at the back of your mind, you'll have the knowledge that this is all a sham, that someday they'll get whatever it is they deserve. You might even think of it as a game, Clarey--no more personal than when you fail to get the gardip ball into the loop.\"  \"I don't happen to play gardip, General,\" Clarey reminded him coldly. Gardip was strictly a U-E pastime. And, in any case, Clarey was not a gamesman.  He was put through intensive indoctrination, given accelerated courses in the total secret agent curriculum: Self-Defense and Electronics, Decoding and Resourcefulness, Xenopsychology and Acting.  \"There are eight cardinal rules of acting,\" the robocoach told him. \"The first is: Never Identify. You'll never be able to become the character you're playing, because you aren't that character--the playwright gave birth to him, not your mother. Therefore--\"  \"But I'm only going to play one role,\" Clarey broke in. \"All I need to know is how to play that role well and convincingly. My life may depend on it.\"  \"I teach acting,\" the robocoach said loftily. \"I don't run a charm school. If you come to me, you learn--or, at least, are exposed to--all I have to offer. I refuse to tailor my art to any occasional need. Now, the second cardinal rule....\"         *       *       *       *       *  Clarey was glad he could absorb the languages and social structure of the planet through the impersonal hypno-tapes. He had to learn more than one language because the planet was divided into several national units, each speaking a different tongue. Inefficient as far as planetary operation went, but advantageous to him, Han Vollard pointed out, because, though he'd work in Vangtor, he would be supposed to have originated in Ventimor; hence his accent.  \"Work?\" Clarey asked. \"I thought I was going to be an undercover agent.\"  \"You'll have a cover job,\" she explained wearily. \"You can't just wander around with no visible source of income, unless you're a member of the nobility, and it would be risky to elevate you to the peerage.\"  \"What kind of a job will I have?\" Clarey asked, brightening a little at the idea of possibly having something interesting to do.  \"They call it _librarian_. I'm not exactly sure what it is, but Colonel Blynn--he's our chief officer on the planet--says that after indoctrination you ought to be able to handle it.\"  Clarey already knew that jobs on Damorlan weren't officially assigned, but that employer and employee somehow managed to find each other and work out arrangements themselves. Sometimes, Han now explained, employers would advertise for employees. Colonel Blynn had answered such a job in Vangtor on his behalf from an accommodation address in Ventimor. \"You were hired sight unseen, because you came cheap. So they probably won't check your references. Let's hope not, anyway.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The trip to Damorlan was one long aching agony. Since luxury liners naturally didn't touch on Damorlan, he was sent out on a service freighter, built for maximum stowage rather than comfort. Most of the time he was spacesick. The only thing that comforted him was that it would be ten years before he'd have to go back.  They landed on the Earthmen's spaceport--the only spaceport, of course--at Barshwat, and he was hustled off to Earth Headquarters in an animal-drawn cart that made him realize there were other ailments besides spacesickness.  \"Afraid you're going to have to hole up in my suite while you're with us,\" Colonel Blynn apologized when Clarey was safely inside. \"The rest of the establishment is crawling"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51868"],["title","The Troublemakers (#1)"],["body","d.\"  \"Nobody's asked my opinion,\" complained Gloria, swinging her leg and hiking the hem of her skirt another half-inch above the slender ankle.  \"Nobody will. However, Miss Hanford, I shall place your card in the 'eligible' file and have your characteristics checked. I'm sure that we can find a man who will be acceptable to you--and also to the department of Domestic Tranquility.\"  \"Humph!\"  \"Sneer if you will, Miss Hanford. But marriage and motherhood have taken the 'hell' out of a lot of hell-raisers in the past.\"   II  Junior Spaceman Howard Reed entered the commandant's office eagerly and briskly. His salute was snappy as he announced himself.  Commander Breckenridge looked up at the young spaceman without expression, nodded curtly, and then looked down at the pile of papers neatly stacked in the center of his desk. Without saying a word, the commander fingered down through the pile until he came to a thin sheaf of papers stapled together. This file he withdrew, placed atop the stack, and then he proceeded to read every word of every page as if he were refreshing his memory about some minor incident that had become important only because of the upper-level annoyance it had caused.  When he finished, he looked up and said coldly, \"I presume you know why you're here, Mr. Reed?\"  \"I can guess, sir--because of my technical suggestion.\"  \"You are correct.\"  \"And it's been accepted?\" cried the junior spaceman eagerly.  \"It has not!\" snapped the superior officer. \"In fact--\"  \"But, sir, I don't understand--\"  \"Silence!\" said Commander Breckenridge. Almost automatically, his right hand slipped the top drawer open to expose the vial of tri-colored capsules. His hand stopped short of them, dangling into the drawer from the wrist resting on the edge. He looked down at the pills and seemed to be debating whether it would be better to conduct this painful interview as gentlemen should, or to let his righteous anger show.  \"Mr. Reed,\" he said heavily, \"your aptitudes and qualifications were reviewed most carefully by the Bureau of Personnel, and their considered judgment caused your replacement here, in the Bureau of Operations. You were _not_--and I repeat, _not_--placed in the Bureau of Research. Is this clear?\"  \"Yes, sir. But--\"  \"Mr. Reed, I cannot object to the provisions in the Regulations whereby encouragement is given both the officers and men to proffer suggestions for the betterment of the Service. However, a shoe-maker should stick to his last. The benefit of this program becomes a detriment when any officer or man tries to invade other departments. This works both ways, Mr. Reed. There is not an officer in the whole Bureau of Research who can tell me a single thing about organizing my Bureau of Operations. Conversely, I would be completely stunned if any Operations officer were to come up with something that hasn't been known to the Bureau of Research for years.\"  \"Yes, sir. I see your point, sir. But if the Bureau of Research has known about my suggestion for years, why isn't it being used?\"  \"Because, Mr. Reed, it will not work!\"  \"But, sir, it's _got_ to work!\"  \"And you feel so firmly convinced of this that you had the temerity to bypass my office?\"  \"Sir, you yourself make a point of professing to know absolutely nothing about scientific matters.\"  \"All right, we'll table this angle for a few minutes. Just what makes this notion of yours so important, Mr. Reed?\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"Sir,\" said Reed, \"the maximum range for our most efficient spacecraft is only a bit over seventeen light-years to the point of no return. My suggestion deals with a means of extending that range a hundred times. Perhaps more. If it were my decision, sir, anything that even hinted at extending the cruising range would receive a maximum-urgency priority.\"  \"In other words, you feel that anything we can do to extend our operations is the most important thing in the whole Space Service?\"  \"Well, sir, perhaps not _the_ most important, but--\"  \"Your modesty is gratifying. I presume this modesty would prevent you from accepting any more than the Letter of Commendation from the Office of the Secretary?\"  \"I don't understand, sir.\"  \"You don't? Mr. Reed, was your desire to improve the efficiency of Operations a simple desire to improve the Service--or did you hope that this brilliant suggestion would, perhaps, provide you with a better assignment?\"  \"I still do not understand.\"  \"Oh, you don't? Mr. Reed, why did you join the Space Service in the first place?\"  \"Because, sir, I hoped that I could be instrumental in helping mankind to spread across the Galaxy.\"  \"Mr. Reed, have you sand in your shoes?\"  \"Sir?\"  The commander sighed. \"You hoped to go along on the voyage, didn't you?\"  \"Well, sir, I did have a hope that I'd become a real spaceman.\"  \"And you're disappointed?\"  Howard Reed's face was wistful, torn between a desire to confide in his commanding officer and the fear of saying what he knew to be a sharp criticism of the Space Service.  Then Reed realized that he was in a bad pinch anyway, and so he said, \"Sir, I'm commissioned as a junior spaceman, but in three years I've only made one short test flight--and only to Luna! I am competent to pilot--or at least that's what the flight simulators say in my checkout tests. I'm a junior spaceman--yet every time I apply for active space duty, I'm refused! Three years I've spent in the Service, sir, solving theoretical and hypothetical problems in space operations. But aside from one test flight to the Moon, I have yet to set a foot inside of a spacecraft, let alone stand on the soil of another world!\"  \"You must learn patience, Mr. Reed.\"  \"_Patience_, sir? Look, sir, I took this sedentary duty until I'd had it up to here, and then I began to pry into the question of why we have a Space Force, complete with spacecraft, and still do so little space traveling. I found out. We're limited to a maximum range of seventeen light-years to the point of no return. Even a trip to Eden, Tau Ceti, our nearest colony, is eleven-point-eight light-years, and that takes prodigious power.\"  \"Granted,\" said the commander.  \"But now, sir, if we could increase our range by one hundred times, this does not necessarily mean that we must actually power the spacecraft for that point of no return. It also means that we could charge the ship with one one-hundredth of its former banks for the short trip to Eden, Tau Ceti--which would leave a _fantastic_ amount of storage and cargo and passenger space. Sir, we could start real commerce!\"         *       *       *       *       *  Commander Breckenridge gave no reaction.  \"And you hoped to be among them.\"  \"Yes, sir! As a kid, I read about mankind's first exploration of space two hundred years ago, sir. Of course, I couldn't hope to set foot on a new planet, since every possible planet within the seventeen-light-year range has been looked over. But I wanted to see space myself, sir--and I did hope that I might extend Man's frontier beyond our rather small limit.\"  \"Yes, I can understand the impatience of youth,\" said Commander Breckenridge. \"For that, I can forgive you. But for trying to do the other man's job, I cannot.\"  \"Sir, you're as much as saying that no one can have a good technical idea but the technical people at the Bureau of Research.\"  In answer, the commander flipped over several pages of the file. He said: \"Mister Reed, this is what resulted in your abortive attempt to gain a scientific ear instead of forwarding your suggestion through the standard channels. I'm going to quote some pertinent parts of a letter from Commander Briggs, head of the Bureau of Research. Listen:  \"--young genius has rediscovered the line of mathematical argument known here at Research as 'Hansen's Folly' because it was first exploited by young Spaceman Hansen about a hundred and fifty years ago. Hansen's Folly is probably to be expected of a young, ambitious young officer with stars in his eyes. I'd be inclined to congratulate him--if it weren't for the fact that Hansen's Folly turns up with such regularity that we here at Research hold a regular pool against its next rediscovery. You'll be happy to know that you, your young genius, and your department have 'won' for me the great honor (?) of buying dinner for the crew at the Officers Club on Saturday next.  \"Don't be too hard on young Reed; the rediscovery of Hansen's Folly takes a rather bright mind. However, Breck, I _will_ congratulate your bright young man if he can--without any further clue--go back over his own mathematics and locate the flaw. I'll--\"  \"There's more of this, but it isn't germane,\" said Breckenridge quietly. \"This is enough.\"  \"Enough, sir?\" repeated Reed blankly.  \"Enough to let you know what goes on. Now, Mr. Reed, you've committed nothing but a brash act of bad taste in bypassing the standard channels. Such an indiscretion demands some form of punishment, but if I were to attempt to outline punishment officially, it would be unfortunately easy for some legal eagle to point out that your behavior was, to the best of your knowledge, intended for the betterment of the Service. And furthermore that I was wreaking vengeance upon your hapless soul for having made my name the brunt of jokes at the Officers Club.\"  \"I'm sorry, sir.\"  \"Being sorry is not enough, Mr. Reed. But I have a plan that will gratify everybody concerned. You want to become an active spaceman? Very well, your next tour of duty will be at the Space Force Station on the planet Eden, Tau Ceti. It will terminate when you have finally succeeded in locating the flaw in Hansen's Folly and can show the error to the satisfaction of Commander Briggs. Have I made myself clear, Mr. Reed?\"  \"Yes, sir, and thank you, sir. You're really doing me a favor, sir.\"  \"Mr. Reed, despite the age-old platitude, it is wise to look the gift horse in the mouth, at least before saying thanks.\"   III  Scholar Norman Ross smiled at his"]]]
