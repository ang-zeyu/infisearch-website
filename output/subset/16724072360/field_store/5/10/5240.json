How can all share a single emotional experience?\"  His researches delved deeply into the Hrrshtk compositions, and a tentative theory based on the Most Common Harmonic, now shown to have been totally mistaken, led to the T85 discoveries.  The Hrrshtk notes, however, found long afterward, provide the real answer.  Among a pile of sketches and musical fragments was found a long list--or, rather, a series of lists. In the form of a Galactic Dictionary, the paper is divided into many columns, each headed with the name of a different planet.  Rather than describe this document, we are printing an excerpt from it herewith:      DENEB III  TERRA    MARS       FOMALHAUT II  SIRIUS VII     Love       Anger    Hunger     Sadness       Madness     Hate       Joy      F'rit      Prayer        Love     Prayer     Madness  Sadness    Full          Joy     Vilb       NPE      Non-F'rit  Golk          NPE  In completed form, the document contains over one hundred and fifty separate listings for race, and over six hundred separate emotional or subject headings. In some places (like the Terra and Sirius listing for Vilb, above), the text is marked NPE, and this has been taken to mean No Precise Equivalent. For instance, such a marking appears after the Denebian _shhr_ for both Terra and Mars, although Sirius has the listing _grk_ and Fomalhaut _plarat_ in the desert.  Hrrshtk may be hailed, therefore, as the discoverer of the Doctrine of Emotional Equivalency, later promulgated in a different form by Space Patrol Psychiatrist Rodney Garman. Further, the document alluded to above explains a phrase in Hrrshtk's noted letter to Dibble Young, which has puzzled commentators since its first appearance.  Hrrshtk is here alluding to the composition of his Revolutionary Ode, which all Terra knows as the most perfect expression of true love to be found in music:  \"It's a Revolutionary Ode to me, my friend--but not to you. As we say here, one man's mood is another man's passion.\"         *       *       *       *       *  _SEPTEMBER 1_: On this date in the year 9909, Treth Schmaltar died on his home planet of Wellington V. All the Galaxy knows his famous Symphonic Storm Suite; less known, but equally interesting, is the history and development of its solo instrument.  The natives of Wellington V feed on airborne plankton, which is carried by the vibrations of sound or speech. This was a little-known fact for many years, but did account for the joy with which the first explorers on Wellington V were greeted. Their speech created waves that fed the natives.  When eating, the natives emit a strange humming noise, due to the action of the peculiar glottis. These facts drove the first settlers, like Treth Schmaltar, to the invention of a new instrument.  This was a large drumlike construction with a small hole in its side through which airborne plankton could enter. Inside the drum, a Wellingtonian crouched. When the drum was beaten, the air vibrations drove plankton into the native's mouth, and he ate and hummed.  (A mechanical device has since replaced the native. This is, of course, due to the terrific expense of importing both natives and plankton to other planets than Wellington V for concerts.)  Thus, a peculiarity of native life led not only to the Symphonic Storm Suite, but to such lovely compositions as Schmaltar's Hum-Drum Sonata.         *       *       *       *       *  _SEPTEMBER 30_: The victimization of the swanlike inhabitants of Harsh XII, perhaps the most pitiful musical scandal of the ages, was begun by Ferd Pill, born on this date in 8181. Pill, who died penitent in a neuterary of the Benedictine Order, is said to have conceived his idea after perusing some early Terran legends about the swan.  He never represented himself as the composer, but always as the agent or representative of a Harsh XII inhabitant. In the short space of three years, he sold over two hundred songs, none of great length but all, as musicians agree to this day, of a startling and almost un-Hnau-like beauty.  When a clerk in the records department of Pill's publishers discovered that Pill, having listed himself as the heir of each of the Harsh XII composers, was in fact collecting their money, an investigation began.  That the composers were in fact dead was easily discovered. That Pill was their murderer was the next matter that came to light.  In an agony of self-abasement, Pill confessed his crime. \"The Harshians don't sing at all,\" he said. \"They don't make a sound. But--like the legendary swan of old Terra--they do deliver themselves of one song in dying. I murdered them in order to record these songs, and then sold the recordings.\"  Pill's subsequent escape from the prison in which he was confined, and his trip to the sanctuary of the neuterary, were said to have been arranged by the grateful widow of one of the murdered Harshians, who had been enabled by her mate's death to remarry with a younger and handsomer Harshian.         *       *       *       *       *  _DECEMBER 5_: Today marks the birthday of Timmis Calk, a science teacher of Lavoris II.  Calk is almost forgotten today, but his magnificent Student Orchestra created a storm both of approval and protest when it was first seen in 9734. Critics on both sides of what rapidly became a Galaxywide controversy were forced, however, to acknowledge the magnificent playing of the Student Orchestra and its great technical attainments.  Its story begins with Calk himself and his sweetheart, a lovely being named Silla.  Though Calk's love for Silla was true and profound, Silla did not return his affectionate feelings. She was an anti-scientist, a musician. The sects were split on Lavoris II to such an extent that marriage between Calk and his beloved would have meant crossing the class lines--something which Silla, a music-lover, was unwilling to contemplate.  Calk therefore determined to prove to her that a scientist could be just as artistic as any musician. Months of hard work followed, until finally he was ready.  He engaged the great Drick Hall for his first concert--and the program consisted entirely of classical works of great difficulty. Beethoven's Ninth Symphony opened the program, and Fenk's Reversed Ode closed it. Calk had no time for the plaudits of critics and audience; he went searching for Silla.  But he was too late. She had heard his concert--and had immediately accepted the marriage proposal of a childhood sweetheart.  Calk nearly committed suicide. But at the last moment, he tossed the spraying-bottle away and went back to Silla.  \"Why?\" he said. \"Why did you reject me, after hearing the marvelous music which I created?\"  \"You are not a musician, but a scientist,\" Silla said. \"Any musician would have refrained from _growing_ his orchestra from seeds.\"  Unable to understand her esthetic revulsion, Calk determined there and then to continue his work with the Student Orchestra (it made a great deal more money than science-teaching). Wrapping his rootlets around his branches, he rolled away from her with crackling dignity."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51623"],["title","Always a Qurono (#1)"],["body","service, the men around him had to at least make a show of respect and paying attention to him. Being ignored was a new experience for him. While it was a strange thing to say of an explorer, Barnhart didn't particularly like new experiences ... or rather he only liked the same kind of new experiences.  He kicked the wine-colored soil in red-faced impotence the first few dozen times quronos went silently past him on the way to gather fruit from the forest, or hew logs to keep the buildings in repairs (which seemed to be a constant occupation.)  However, when the twenty-fifth alien shouldered past him the morning after he first discovered the village, Barnhart caught him by the shoulder, swung him half around and slugged him off his feet with a stabbing right cross.  The alien shook his head foggily a few times and slowly climbed to his feet.  Barnhart bit at his under lip. That hadn't been a wise thing to do at all. He should know that unorthodox moves like that led only to certain disaster. He fumbled for his force-field projector, and with a flush of adrenalin discovered he had lost it.  Now, he thought, the alien will signal the rest of them. And they, all one hundred of them (now does that include the one I first saw in the clearing or not?) they will converge on me and--  The qurono marched off into the forest.  Everyone was still ignoring Barnhart.         *       *       *       *       *  Barnhart munched on a steak sandwich listlessly and watched the aliens through the faint haze of the force field.  He had found the projector half stamped into the earth and he was testing it. But even a test was foolish. None of them was close enough to him to harm him with so much as a communicable disease. He might as well quit roughing it and get back to the cottage.  In the last few days he had had time to think. He took up his journal.      _Eighth Day_      I can only suppose that these actions of the aliens represent some     kind of religious ritual. Again I am presented with the problem of     whether these rituals are a part of their normal, daily life, or     are they a special series instigated by my presence?      Yesterday I observed two of the quronos repairing one of the     village houses. The native lumber seems to be ill-suited to     construction purposes. Several times I have noticed logs tearing     themselves free and crawling back into the virgin forest. Due to     the instability of their building materials the aliens are     constantly having to repair their houses.      In watching the two quronos at work I observed something highly     significant.      The humanoids worked smoothly as a team, splitting and planing down     the reluctant logs with double-bladed axes. Then, putting the     lumber in place, they fastened it down with triangular wooden pegs.     They pounded these pegs home awkwardly with the flat side of the     axes.      The axes are crude and obviously indigenous to the culture.      I view this with considerable alarm.      Obviously any culture that can produce an axe is capable of     inventing the hammer.      The quronos are not using their hammers in front of me. I am     producing a change in their routine.      Where will it end?      What are they saving their hammers for?      _800: Eighth Day_  Barnhart had written that just before dawn, but as usual the aliens had continued to ignore him. For all he knew the ritual might go on for years--before they used their hammers. Or whatever they were planning.  It was drawing near time for his nap, but he felt completely wide awake even inside the safety of the force field. His throat hurt and the backs of his legs ached with the waiting, the waiting for the natives to come out and begin xenogutting.  He wiped his hands together and forced a smile. Why should he worry what the natives did? He was completely safe. He could live out his life in immutable security.  But this wasn't his world. No part of it was his ... or at least only the part he had brought with him. Sanity lay in holding to what was left of his own world. But sanity didn't always mean survival.  What if he could make the quronos' world his own?  Barnhart wiped at the tiny stings against his face and his fingertips came away moist with beads of perspiration.  The aliens began marching out of the houses, in twos from the ten-foot doors, singly from the foot-square openings of every other facing wall.  It wasn't his world of fire-works-streaked Ohio summers and bold green hills, this planet cowled with nun-like secrecy, looking acrid, tasting violet and transmitting a beauty and confusion only a trio of physical scientists could solve.  But there was only one thing to do.  Barnhart let down his force field and went out.  The human body wasn't well-adapted for it but Barnhart did his best to join the quronos in xenogutting.  Instantly the cry welled up.  \"_Master._\"  Barnhart stood up and faced the aliens, deeply disturbed.         *       *       *       *       *  He was even more disturbed when, later, he wrote again in his journal:      _Ninth day_      \"Qurono,\" I have learned from the Leader, is a term referring to a     particular type of sub-human android. The synthetic process used     in manufacturing these men does not allow them to develop beyond a     certain point--a built-in safety factor of their creators, I can     only suppose. Thus they were given the concept of the axe and have     retained it, but they were able only to devise the idea of using     the axe to hammer things with and are not capable of thinking of a     special hammering tool.      With almost complete lack of creative ability they are bound to     the same routine, to which they adhere with an almost religious     fanaticism.      Since last night I have been treated as virtually a god. I have     been given one of their buildings entirely for my own use.      I find this turn of events absolutely surprising. I intend to     discuss this with the Leader today. (Note to any ethnologist who     may see these papers: Since all quronos are built to the same     standards none is superior to another. But, recognizing the need     for one director, each of the one hundred has an alternate term     as Leader.)      _900: Ninth day_  Despite the upsetting turn of events Barnhart decided he was more comfortable in his familiar role of command.  He glanced at his wristwatch and was surprised to note that he had overslept. The time for both breakfast and chronopting was past. He made himself ready and left the building.  The alien was waiting just outside the door. He looked as if he hadn't moved all night. Yet, Barnhart thought, he seemed a trifle shorter.  \"Are you the Leader?\" Barnhart asked.  \"I am the Leader. But you are the Master.\"  As an officer of a close-confines spaceship that sounded a little stuffy even to Barnhart. The fellow _still_ looked shorter. Maybe they had changed Leaders the way he had been told the night before. Or maybe quronos shrank when left out in the night air.  \"Let's go someplace where we can sit down. And, incidentally, just call me 'sir' or 'captain.'\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  Barnhart nodded. He had been expecting: Yes, Master, I will call you 'captain.'  But the alien didn't move. He finally decided that the Leader thought they could sit on the ground where they were standing.  Barnhart squatted.  The Leader squatted.  Before they could speak a muffled explosion vibrated the ground and Barnhart caught a fleeting glimpse of an unstable chemical rocket tearing jerkily into the maroon sky.  \"Celebration for my arrival?\" Barnhart asked.  \"Perhaps so. We are putting the un-needed ones in status.\"  He decided to let that ride for the moment.  \"Tell me, why didn't you recognize me before I joined you in your--ritual, Leader?\"  The alien tilted his head. \"What was there to recognize? We thought you were some new variety of animal. Before you xenogutted how were we to know you were rational life?\"  Barnhart nodded. \"But how did you so cleverly deduce that I was your Master?\"  \"There are one hundred of us. You were the one hundred and first. You had to be the Master returned.\"  The Master had been some friendly lifeform in the Federation, obviously. Otherwise the qurono androids wouldn't speak Galactic. Barnhart nibbled on his under lip.  \"I want to find out how much you still know after the Master has been away so long,\" the captain said. \"Tell me, how do you communicate with the Master?\"  \"What for?\" The Leader began to look at Barnhart oddly.  \"For anything. Where's the sub-space radio?\"  The direct approach produced a rather ironic expression on the qurono's narrow face but no answer. But if there was a radio on the planet Barnhart meant to find it. Spacemen forced to abandon their craft were required to report to the nearest Federation base as quickly as possible. Besides, he meant to see that Simmons and his Anglo stooge and all the others paid for their mutiny. But, he decided, perhaps he had better not press the matter at the moment.  Another rocket punctuated the moment of silence.  \"Take me to your launching area,\" Barnhart said.  The android stood up and walked. But he walked at Barnhart's side, forcing the captain to catch his stride a half-step to let the alien lead him. He wasn't sure if it was a mark of respect not to get ahead of the Master or an attempt to see if he knew where the launching site was located. The quronos were limited, but just _how_ limited Barnhart was beginning to wonder.         *       *       *       *       *  They rounded the clump of drooping lavender trees and Barnhart saw the eight men laying on the ground in the transparent casings. Not men, but quronos, he corrected himself; in a molded clear membrane of some sort.  \"They are in status,\" the Leader explained, answering the captain's unasked question.  \"This is how you keep your population at one hundred,\" Barnhart thought aloud, removing his glasses to rest his"]]]
