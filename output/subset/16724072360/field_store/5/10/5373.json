But all life is a dispute about taste and tasting!  \"Taste: that is weight at the same time, and scales and weigher; and alas for every living thing that would live without dispute about weight and scales and weighing!\"[8]  But it is more particularly in Nietzsche's understanding of the instinct which drove him to expression, and in his attitude towards those whom he would teach, that we recognize the typical artist, in the highest acceptation of the word--that is to say, as a creature of abundance, who must give thereof or perish. Out of plenitude and riches only, do his words come to us. With him there can be no question of eloquence as the result of poverty, vindictiveness, spite, resentment, or envy; for such eloquence is of the swamp.[9] Where he is wrath, he speaks from above, where he despises his contempt is prompted by love alone, and where he annihilates he does so as a creator.[10]  \"Mine impatient love,\" he says, \"floweth over in streams, down towards the sunrise and the sunset. From out silent mountains and tempests of affliction, rusheth my soul into the valleys.  \"Too long have I yearned and scanned the far horizon. Too long hath the shroud of solitude been upon me: thus have I lost the habit of silence.  \"A tongue have I become and little else besides, and the brawling of a brook, falling from lofty rocks: downward into the dale will I pour my words.  \"And let the torrent of my love dash into all blocked highways. How could a torrent help but find its way to the sea!  \"Verily, a lake lies within me, complacent and alone; but the torrent of my love draws this along with it, down--into the ocean!  \"New highways I tread, new worlds come unto me; like all creators I have grown weary of old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on worn-out soles.  \"Too slow footed is all speech for me:--Into thy chariot, O storm, do I leap! And even thee will I scourge with my devilry.  \"Thus spake Zarathustra.\"[11]   [1] Delivered at University College on Dec. 1st, 1910.  [2] _W. P._, Vol. I, p. 1.

The Art of to-day, unholy and undivine as the Tower of Babel, seems to have incurred the wrath of a mighty godhead, and those who were at work upon it have abandoned it to its fate, and have scattered apart--all speaking different tongues, and all filled with confusion.  Precisely on account of the disorder which now prevails in this department of life, sincere and honest people find it difficult to show the interest in it, which would be only compatible with its importance.  Probably but few men, to-day, could fall on their knees and sob at the deathbed of a great artist, as Pope Leo X once did. Maybe there are but one or two who, like the Taiko's generals, when Teaism was in the ascendancy in Japan, would prefer the present of a rare work of art to a large grant of territory as a reward of victory;[12] and there is certainly not one individual in our midst but would curl his lips at the thought of a mere servant sacrificing his life for a precious picture.  And yet, says the Japanese writer, Okakura-Kakuzo, \"many of our favourite dramas in Japan are based on the loss and subsequent recovery of a noted masterpiece.\"[13]  In this part of the world to-day, not only the author, but also the audience for such dramas is entirely lacking.  The layman, as well as the artist, knows perfectly well that this is so. Appalled by the disorder, contradictoriness, and difference of opinion among artists, the layman has ceased to think seriously about Art; while artists themselves are so perplexed by the want of solidarity in their ranks, that they too are beginning to question the wherefore of their existence.  Not only does every one arrogate to himself the right to utter his word upon Art; but Art's throne itself is now claimed by thousands upon thousands of usurpers--each of whom has a \"free personality\" which he insists upon expressing,[14] and to whom severe law and order would be an insuperable barrier. Exaggerated individualism and anarchy are the result. But such results are everywhere inevitable, when all æsthetic canons have been abolished, and when there is no longer anybody strong enough to command or to lead.  \"Knowest thou not who is most needed of all?\" says Zarathustra. \"He who commandeth great things.  \"To execute great things is difficult; but the more difficult task is to command great things.\"[15]  Direct commanding of any sort, however, as Nietzsche declares, has ceased long since. \"In cases,\" he observes, \"where it is believed that the leader and bell-wether cannot be dispensed with, attempt after attempt is made nowadays to replace commanders by the summing together of clever gregarious men: all representative constitutions, for example, are of this origin.\"[16]  Although, in this inquiry, the Fine Arts will be the subject of my particular attention, it should not be supposed that this is necessarily the department in modern life in which Nietzsche believed most disorder, most incompetence, and most scepticism prevails. I selected the Fine Arts, in the first place, merely because they are the arts concerning which I am best informed, and to which the Nietzschean doctrine can be admirably applied; and secondly, because sculpture and painting offer a wealth of examples known to all, which facilitates anything in the way of an exposition. For even outsiders and plain men in the street must be beginning to have more than an inkling of the chaos and confusion which now reigns in other spheres besides the Fine Arts. It must be apparent to most people that, in every department of modern life where culture and not calculation, where taste and not figures, where ability and not qualifications, are alone able to achieve anything great--that is to say, in religion, in morality, in law, in politics, in music, in architecture, and finally in the plastic arts, precision and government are now practically at an end.  \"Disintegration,\" says Nietzsche,\"--that is to say, uncertainty--is peculiar to this age: nothing stands on solid ground or on a sound faith.... All our road is slippery and dangerous, while the ice which still bears us has grown unconscionably thin: we all feel the mild and gruesome breath of the thaw-wind--soon, where we are walking, no one will any longer be able to stand!\"[17]  We do not require to be told that in religion and moral matters, scarcely any two specialists are agreed--the extraordinarily large number of religious sects in England alone needs but to be mentioned here; in law we divine that things are in a bad state; in politics even our eyes are beginning to give us evidence of the serious uncertainty prevailing; while in architecture and music the case is pitiable.  \"If we really wished, if we actually dared to devise a style of architecture which corresponded to the state of our souls,\" says Nietzsche, \"a labyrinth would be the building we should erect. But,\" he adds, \"we are too cowardly to construct anything which would be such a complete revelation of our hearts.\"[18]  However elementary our technical knowledge of the matter may be, we, as simple inquirers, have but to look about our streets to-day, in order to convince ourselves of the ignominious muddle of modern architecture. Here we find structural expedients used as ornaments,[19] the most rigid parts of buildings, in form (the rectangular parts, etc.), placed near the roof instead of in the basement,[20] and pillars standing supporting, and supported by, nothing.[21] Elsewhere we see solids over voids,[22] mullions supporting arches,[23] key-stones introduced into lintels,[24] real windows appearing as mere holes in the wall, while the ornamental windows are shams,[25] and pilasters resting on key-stones.[26]  And, everywhere, we see recent requirements masked and concealed behind Greek, Roman, Gothic, Renaissance, Rococo, and Baroque embellishments, thrown together helter-skelter, and with a disregard of structural demands which must startle even the uninitiated.[27]  Our streets are ugly in the extreme.[28] Only at night, as Camille Mauclair says, does the artificial light convert their hideousness into a sort of lugubrious grandeur,[29] and that is perhaps why, to the sensitive artistic Londoner, the darkness of night or the pale glow of the moon is such a solace and relief.  As to the state of modern music, this is best described perhaps, though with perfectly unconscious irony, by Mr. Henry Davey, in the opening words of his _Student's Musical History_.  \"Music has indeed been defined,\" he says, \"as 'sound with regular vibrations,' other sounds being called noise. This definition,\" the author adds, \"is only suited to undeveloped music; modern music may include noise and even silence.\"[30]  People are mistaken if they suppose that Nietzsche, in attacking Wagner as he did, was prompted by any personal animosity or other considerations foreign to the question of music. In Wagner, Nietzsche saw a Romanticist of the strongest possible type, and he was opposed to the Romantic School of Music,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53370"],["title","Wastralls: A Novel (#1)"],["body","had left a son.  Tom, the owner of Hember, thought that as its fields marched with those of Wastralls, he ought to marry his cousin; while Constantine sought her because the glint of her bright hair had dazzled him.  A fine maid was Sabina, blue eyes flush with rounded cheeks, not the passionate eyes of Old Squire, but the blue of ice-depths when the sun is shining in a clear sky; and when it was a question of marriage she found the straight sticks who offered themselves for weapon and support were of a too familiar wood.  She would go a little farther into the forest.      _Arise up, Maid, all in your gown of green_       _For summer is a-come into day;_     _You are as fine a lady as wait upon the queen_       _In the merry morning of May._     _Arise up, Maid, out of your bed_       _For summer is a-come into day;_     _Your chamber shall be strewed with the white rose and the red_       _In the merry morning of May_ [*]  [*] Padstow Hobby-horse song.   The green waves of the Atlantic roll strange flotsam into the sandy bays of that bitter coast; and the sea, hungry though it be, can give up more than the dead. One summer on the bosom of a forgotten sunset, a boat had drifted into Morwen Cove, to strand, when the tide turned, amid the weed and rubbish of the foreshore. In it, swollen with cold, unconscious, nearly dead, lay a waif, the survivor of some obscure wreck.  Leadville Byron, a hind who with his childless wife lived over the disused fish-cellars at Wastralls, chanced upon the boat. Its contents stirred the father in him and, as he carried home the bit of human waste, his anxiety was lest it might be reclaimed; indeed he never quite lost his fear that what the sea had given the land, that unknown of towns and country beyond the hills, might take.  If inquiries were made, however, they did not reach Trevorrick and the child, a lusty, black-browed youngster, grew to manhood, without further change in his surroundings.  His native tongue had been unintelligible to the villagers and he could not give himself a name.  His foster-parents, therefore, felt themselves justified in calling him Leadville.  If his name were ever discovered he could return to it, meanwhile he was buttressed against the curiosity of strangers.  As was only natural the Byrons bred him to work on the land; and at eighteen, Wastralls—the delectable hillside, the edge of cliff, the tumuli of the ancient folk—were all he knew; indeed, it required a cataclysm to prove to him that he was not a clod of Wastralls earth.  In outward seeming the lad was not unlike the people among whom he lived.  A little more swarthy, with a more sombre expression in his dark eyes, a broader chest than was often seen, he might have passed for a Cornishman.  The difference was one of temperament and it was a difference so great, that never to the end of his life was he to be other to them than a ’foreigner.’  One autumn, after a rainy, reedy summer, a summer of losses, Mr. Rosevear was forced to believe he could work the farm with fewer labourers; and young Byron, being the last to join the little band of hinds, must be the first to go.  The lad took his dismissal hardly.  By dewing the land with his sweat he had made it his and, against his will, a deep and narrow will, he could not be disinherited.  He considered himself as much part of Wastralls as a bush of tamarisk in the hedge. As, however, he must go, he listened to his foster-father’s suggestion and returned temporarily to the great waters which had spewed him up. He went, but in every ship’s wake, in the reek of foreign cities, in the wind that blew from home, he saw visions of those few fields which to him were the world.  He had the inward eye of the dreamer and, as the year turned, saw spring drawing her green skirts over the hillside and hanging the orchard with her gossamers.  He saw the dandelions starring the thick grass by the river, the lush dark grass in which he had rolled himself moved by the ecstasy of life; and to him the salt sea was barren and unprofitable, a desert upon which he must go to and fro until the days of his pilgrimage were accomplished.  The death of old Byron brought the wanderer back to Hindoo Cottage—as the fish-cellars were called—only to find that the wife had followed her man; and that he—Leadville the younger—was again without even the semblance of a human tie.  He had not loved the old couple, love did not at any time come easily to him and all the emotion of which he was capable had long been concentrated upon Wastralls; but he was anxious to secure his foster-father’s berth as teamster.  To the outpourings of the neighbours he listened unheeding and presently took his way to the farmhouse, there to learn that Rosevear had been laid in a neater ditch than that of his inadvertent choice and that Sabina—big, ripe, fair, a woman who might have stepped out of the Elizabethan age—reigned in his stead.  The opportunity was self-evident and Byron, back in his place and once more happy, soon realized that his heart’s desire was within reach.  It was not Sabina that he wanted but Wastralls; and that, again, not for ambition’s sake, but because his late experience had taught him the value of security.  Asking no more of life than permission to spend his youth, his strength, his passion on the land, he found consent in Sabina’s awakening interest.  She had disdained the easy-kindled fires of Tom, of Constantine, and of the Tregols lads, but the sombre glow in Byron’s eyes was disturbing. It moved her as something unknown and full of a strange promise, that promise which is in the rising sap and germinating seed.  The neighbours expressed a kindly apprehension, for though marriage between persons of different race may be eugenically sound, it seldom brings happiness to the individual; but Sabina was beyond reason, for in the stranger she had found her mate.  Within a month the banns were called and a little later the oddly assorted couple pushed off into matrimony. Whereas, however, Byron believed himself to be marrying Wastralls—the good farm and the waste lands by the sea—making it for ever flesh of his flesh, his in indissoluble union, Sabina did not intend to endow her lover with her worldly goods.  She held the land by right of inheritance and by a worthier right, that of the farmer who deals understandingly with her fields.  Although she cultivated the farm in the way that had brought prosperity to the family, her stock was pedigree and realized good prices, her seed was the best procurable and she was always ready to try new manures and dressings.  She was not a woman of ideas, neither was she reactionary but a fold of Old Squire’s mantle hung from her shoulders and, as the neighbours said, \"to give the maid her due, her’s a first-rate farmer.\"  She loved her farm, but as a sportsman loves a good dog.  She exacted from it the utmost it could give and was its considerate master, but she could have no conception of Leadville’s attitude. If it had been explained to her that he loved the land as a man loves a woman, she would have doubted her informant, and if convinced have thought her husband a fool for his pains.  As it was, when he attempted to assert his new rights, as he did immediately after their marriage, she stared in surprise.  \"’Oo told you to give the orders to the ’inds when I’ve got a tongue of me own?\"  \"I thought I was savin’ of ’ee a lot of trouble.\"  \"I don’t want yer to do my work for me.  I can do it meself.\"  \"I should think you got enough to do indoors without goin’ outdoors workin’.  I don’t see what a woman want to be out in all weathers for.\"  Sabina laughed good-humouredly.  \"My dear feller, I always bin outdoor. Rain or fine don’t make any difference to me.\"  \"Well, my dear, you’ll lose all they good looks o’ yours.  I don’t like to see women all burned up.  You’ll be an old woman before you’m a young one.\"  \"I don’t care what I be, and I don’t believe a word you say is true. Ony’ow I shall chance it.\"  \"Well, ’tis the man’s place to teel the land.\"  \"A fine mess you’d make of it, too.  Look at the Mill fields!  If Con turned the ditches out they wouldn’t be so wet; even Tom don’t keep ’is fields so clean as mine.\"  \"I don’t care ’bout that, ’bain’t a woman’s work.\"  \"Aw, git away.  ’Tidn’t all women that want to farm; but those that do, let’m ’av it.  ’Tis just whether they can farm or can’t.\"  \"Well, I think it’s my business as I’m yer ’usband. You ought to let me ’av it.\"  \"What’s the good to let you ’av it, you dunno nothing about farmin’. You bin to sea most all yer life.  ’Tis years an’ years since you ploughed a bit o’ ground.\"  A dark colour came into the bridegroom’s cheek. \"’Ow can you say that when I was brought up on the land.  I knaw all about farm work.  ’Aving married you, to ’av the farm’s my due.\"  Sabina sat very straight in her chair.  \"Now once for all,\" said she, \"let’s settle this matter.  Wastralls is mine, and I dare you to so much as lay a finger on it. If you want to farm so much as all that, Higher Polnevas is to let, and its fields are joinin’ ours.  Why don’t you go over and take that?  I’ll let you ’av the money for that, but you won’t ’av Wastralls.\"  Byron had not expected opposition.  Sabina, being a woman, would naturally be glad to have the outdoor work taken off her hands.  His surprise at her attitude was so intense that he stared at her in a helpless silence, until she clinched the matter by exclaiming in her hearty, fresh-air voice, \"’Tis no good for ’ee to think anything about it.\"  This phrase opened the flood-gates.  Usually somewhat silent, he had moods when the words tumbled over each other in a multitude beyond counting.  Perceiving he had miscalculated he set to work to retrieve his error and, during the course of the evening, learnt many things but not how to make Sabina change her mind. The poor man, desperately afraid, did all he knew.  He entreated and she smiled, he blustered and she"]]]
