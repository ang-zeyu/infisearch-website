Their morale was high, in spite of inevitable conflicts between members. This schooner, bringing in supplies from Sydney and Rabaul, was the last civilized contact they would have for another six months.         *       *       *       *       *  While Sorensen nervously supervised, the crew of the schooner unloaded the cargo. He didn't want any of the equipment, some of it shipped over six thousand miles, to be broken now. No replacements were possible; whatever they didn't have, they would have to do without. He breathed out in relief when the last crate, containing a metals detector, was safely hoisted over the side and put on the beach above the high-water mark.  There was something odd about that box. He examined it and found a quarter-sized hole in one end. It had not been properly sealed.  Dan Drake, the co-manager of the expedition, joined him. \"What's wrong?\" Drake asked.  \"Hole in that crate,\" Sorensen said. \"Salt water might have gotten in. We'll be in tough shape if this detector doesn't work.\"  Drake nodded. \"We better open it and see.\" He was a short, deeply tanned, broad-chested man with close-cropped black hair and a straggly mustache. He wore an old yachting cap jammed down over his eyes, giving his face a tough bulldog look. He pulled a big screwdriver from his belt and inserted it into the crack.  \"Wait a moment,\" Sorensen said. \"Let's get it up to the camp first. Easier to carry the crate than something packed in grease.\"  \"Right,\" Drake said. \"Take the other end.\"  The camp was built in a clearing a hundred yards from the beach, on the site of an abandoned native village. They had been able to re-thatch several huts, and there was an old copra shed with a galvanized iron roof where they stored their supplies. Here they got the benefit of any breeze from the sea. Beyond the clearing, the gray-green jungle sprang up like a solid wall.  Sorensen and Drake set the case down. The skipper, who had accompanied them with the newspapers, looked around at the bleak huts and shook his head.  \"Would you like a drink, Skipper?\" Sorensen asked. \"Afraid we can't offer any ice.\"  \"A drink would be fine,\" the skipper said. He wondered what drove men to a godforsaken place like this in search of imaginary Spanish treasure.  Sorensen went into one of the huts and brought out a bottle of Scotch and a tin cup. Drake had taken out his screwdriver and was vigorously ripping boards off the crate.  \"How does it look?\" Sorensen asked.  \"It's OK,\" Drake said, gently lifting out the metals detector. \"Heavily greased. Doesn't seem like there was any damage--\"  He jumped back. The skipper had come forward and stamped down heavily on the sand.  \"What's the matter?\" Sorensen asked.  \"Looked like a scorpion,\" the skipper said. \"Damned thing crawled right out of your crate there. Might have bit you.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Sorensen shrugged. He had gotten used to the presence of an infinite number of insects during his three months on Vuanu. Another bug more or less didn't seem to make much difference.  \"Another drink?\" he asked.  \"Can't do it,\" the skipper said regretfully. \"I'd better get started. All your party healthy?\"  \"All healthy so far,\" Sorensen said. He smiled. \"Except for some bad cases of gold fever.\"  \"You'll never find gold in this place,\" the skipper said seriously. \"I'll look in on you in about six months. Good luck.\"  After shaking hands, the skipper went down to the beach and boarded his ship. As the first pink flush of sunset touched the sky, the schooner was under way. Sorensen and Drake watched it negotiate the pass. For a few minutes its masts were visible above the reef. Then they had dipped below the horizon.  \"That's that,\" Drake said. \"Us crazy American treasure-hunters are alone again.\"  \"You don't think he suspected anything?\" Sorensen asked.  \"Definitely not. As far as he's concerned, we're just crackpots.\"  Grinning, they looked back at their camp. Under the copra shed was nearly fifty thousand dollars worth of gold and silver bullion, dug out of the jungle and carefully reburied. They had located a part of the _Santa Teresa_ treasure during their first month on the island. There was every indication of more to come. Since they had no legal title to the land, the expedition was not eager to let the news get out. Once it was known, every gold-hungry vagabond from Perth to Papeete would be heading to Vuanu.  \"The boy'll be in soon,\" Drake said. \"Let's get some stew going.\"  \"Right,\" Sorensen said. He took a few steps and stopped. \"That's funny.\"  \"What is?\"  \"That scorpion the skipper squashed. It's gone.\"  \"Maybe he missed it,\" Drake said. \"Or maybe he just pushed it down into the sand. What difference does it make?\"  \"None, I guess,\" Sorensen said.   II  Edward Eakins walked through the jungle with a long-handled spade on his shoulder, sucking reflectively on a piece of candy. It was the first he'd had in weeks, and he was enjoying it to the utmost. He was in very good spirits. The schooner yesterday had brought in not only machinery and replacement parts, but also candy, cigarettes and food. He had eaten scrambled eggs this morning, and real bacon. The expedition was becoming almost civilized.  Something rustled in the bushes near him. He marched on, ignoring it.  He was a lean, sandy-haired man, amiable and slouching, with pale blue eyes and an unprepossessing manner. He felt very lucky to have been taken on the expedition. His gas station didn't put him on a financial par with the others, and he hadn't been able to put up a full share of the money. He still felt guilty about that. He had been accepted because he was an eager and indefatigable treasure-hunter with a good knowledge of jungle ways. Equally important, he was a skilled radio operator and repairman. He had kept the transmitter on the ketch in working condition in spite of salt water and mildew.  He could pay his full share now, of course. But _now_, when they were practically rich, didn't really count. He wished there were some way he could--  There was that rustle in the bushes again.  Eakins stopped and waited. The bushes trembled. And out stepped a mouse.  Eakins was amazed. The mice on this island, like most wild animal life, were terrified of man. Although they feasted off the refuse of the camp--when the rats didn't get it first--they carefully avoided any contact with humans.  \"You better get yourself home,\" Eakins said to the mouse.  The mouse stared at him. He stared back. It was a pretty little mouse, no more than four or five inches long, and colored a light tawny brown. It didn't seem afraid.  \"So long, mouse,\" Eakins said. \"I got work to do.\" He shifted his spade to the other shoulder and turned to go. As he turned, he caught a flash of brown out of the corner of his eye. Instinctively he ducked. The mouse whirled past him, turned, and gathered itself for another leap.  \"Mouse, are you out of your head?\" Eakins asked.  The mouse bared its tiny teeth and sprang. Eakins knocked it aside.  \"Now get the hell out of here,\" he said. He was beginning to wonder if the rodent was crazy. Did it have rabies, perhaps?  The mouse gathered itself for another charge. Eakins lifted the spade off his shoulders and waited. When the mouse sprang, he met it with a carefully timed blow. Then carefully, regretfully, he battered it to death.  \"Can't have rabid mice running around,\" he said.  But the mouse hadn't seemed rabid; it had just seemed very determined.  Eakins scratched his head. Now what, he wondered, had gotten into that little mouse?  In the camp that evening, Eakins' story was greeted with hoots of laughter. It was just like Eakins to be attacked by a mouse. Several men suggested that he go armed in case the mouse's family wanted revenge. Eakins just smiled sheepishly.         *       *       *       *       *  Two days later, Sorensen and Al Cable were finishing up a morning's hard work at Site 4, two miles from the camp. The metals detector had shown marked activity at this spot. They were seven feet down and nothing had been produced yet except a high mound of yellow-brown earth.  \"That detector must be wrong,\" Cable said, wiping his face wearily. He was a big, pinkish man. He had sweated off twenty pounds on Vuanu, picked up a bad case of prickly heat, and had enough treasure-hunting to last him a lifetime. He wished he were back in Baltimore taking care of his used-car agency. He didn't hesitate to say so, often and loudly. He was one member who had not worked out well.  \"Nothing wrong with the detector,\" Sorensen said. \"Trouble is, we're digging in swampy ground. The cache must have sunk.\"  \"It's probably a hundred feet down,\" Cable said, stabbing angrily at the gluey mud.  \"Nope,\" Sorensen said. \"There's volcanic rock under us, no more than twenty feet down.\"  \"Twenty feet? We should have a bulldozer.\"  \"Might be costly bringing one in,\" Sorensen said mildly. \"Come on, Al, let's get back to camp.\"  Sorensen helped Cable out of the excavation. They cleaned off their tools and started toward the narrow path leading back to the camp. They stopped abruptly.  A large, ugly bird had stepped out of the brush. It was standing on the path, blocking their way.  \"What in hell is that?\" Cable asked.  \"A cassowary,\" Sorensen said.  \"Well, let's boot it out of the way and get going.\"  \"Take it easy,\" Sorensen said. \"If anyone does any booting, it'll be the bird. Back away slowly.\"  The cassowary was nearly five feet high, a black-feathered ostrich-like bird standing erect on powerful legs. Each of its feet was three-toed, and the toes curved into heavy talons. It had a yellowish, bony head and short, useless wings. From its neck hung a brilliant wattle colored red, green, and purple.  \"It is dangerous?\" Cable asked.  Sorensen nodded. \"Natives on New Guinea have been kicked to death by those birds.\"  \"Why haven't"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51834"],["title","Never Come Midnight (#1)"],["body","known, but the broad-shouldered youth of the early pictures, golden of hair and skin and eyes, almost classical in feature and build. Plastic surgery could have converted a fleeting resemblance to a precise one, yet, somehow, Hubbard _felt_ that this was flesh and blood of the old man's.  \"You're very like your father,\" he said, inaccurately: Emrys was less like his father than he should have been, given that startling identity of physique.  \"Am I?\" The boy smiled. \"I never knew him. Of course, I know I look like the pictures, but pictures never tell much, do they?\"  He had many papers to give Peter Hubbard. Too many; no honest man had his life so well in order. But then Emrys' honesty was not the issue, only his identity. The birth certificate said he had been born on Clergal fifty-five years before, so he was ten years older than Hubbard's wildest estimate. A young man, but not a boy--a man of full maturity, but still too young to be, normally, Jan Shortmire's son. Then Hubbard opened Emrys Shortmire's passport and received another shock.  He tried to sound calm. \"I see you were on Morethis the same time your father was!\"  Emrys' smile widened. \"Curious coincidence, wasn't it?\"  A surge of almost physical dislike filled the lawyer. \"Is that all it was--a coincidence?\"  \"Are you suggesting that I pushed my father into the Ekkan?\" Emrys asked pleasantly.  \"Certainly not!\" Hubbard was indignant at the thought that he, as a lawyer, would have voiced such a suspicion, even if it had occurred to him. \"I thought you two might have arranged to meet on Morethis.\"  \"I told you I'd never seen my father,\" Emrys reminded him. \"As for what I was doing on Morethis--that's my business.\"  \"All I'm concerned with is whether or not you _are_ Emrys Shortmire.\" Distaste was almost tangible on Hubbard's tongue. \"It does seem surprising that, since you _were_ on Morethis at the time your father died, you should not have come to claim your inheritance sooner.\"  \"I had affairs of my own to wind up,\" Emrys said flatly.         *       *       *       *       *  Hubbard tapped the papers. \"You understand that these must be checked before you receive your father's estate?\"  \"I understand perfectly.\" Emrys' voice was soft as a Si-yllan cat-man's, and even more insulting. \"They will be gone over thoroughly for any possible error, any tiny imperfection, anything that could invalidate my claim. But you will find them entirely in order.\"  \"I'm sure of that.\" And Hubbard knew, if the papers were forgeries, they would be works of art.  \"You'll probably want me to undergo an equally thorough physical examination for signs of--ah--surgical tampering. Yes, I see I'm right.\"  Ungenerous hope leaped inside Hubbard. \"You would object?\"  \"On the contrary, I'd be delighted. Haven't had a thorough medical checkup for years.\" On this cooperative note, Emrys Shortmire bowed and left.  Hubbard sighed back against the velvet cushions of his chair--real silk, for he was a very rich old man. Unfortunately, he could not doubt that this was Jan Shortmire's progeny. But--and Hubbard sat upright--no matter how much Emrys resembled his father, that was only one parent. Who had the young man's mother been?  Quickly, Hubbard searched through the papers for the birth certificate. The name was Iloa Tasqi. The nationality: _Morethan_.  No wonder the affair had been kept so secret. No wonder Emrys seemed so strange and that Jan had lied about his previous visit to the dark planet. Small wonder, too, that he'd had a son he was not aware of. Who would have believed that human and Morethan could breed together? For the Morethans, although humanoid, were not at all human.  So Emrys Shortmire was only half human. The other half was--well, the vidicasts called it _monster_, and, now that he had met the young man, Peter Hubbard was inclined to agree.   II  Outside the office building, Emrys Shortmire paused and inhaled deeply. Say what you would about the atmospheres of some of the other planets' being fresher and purer, the air of Earth, being the air in which Man had evolved, was the air that felt best in his nostrils and filled his lungs to greatest satisfaction. And, after the fetid atmosphere of Morethis, this was pure heaven. Gray sky and violet dying sun against blue sky and radiant golden sun. No wonder the Morethans were what they were, and Earthmen were what they were.  Well, the golden sun of Earth would set somewhat sooner than the physicists--or the sociologists--had prognosticated. But all that would be long after he himself had died. It was no concern of his, anyway. He was Emrys Shortmire, born out of Jan Shortmire and no mortal woman; and nothing else on Earth, or in the Universe, mattered.  Disdaining the importunate heli-cabs that besieged him with plaintive mechanical offers of transportation, he walked down the street, enjoying the pull of the planet upon the youth and strength of his body, delighting in the clarity of his vision and the keenness of his nostrils. He was so absorbed in his thoughts and so unaccustomed still to Earth's traffic that he did not look where he was going. The groundcar was upon him before he knew it. Of course something like this would happen, he thought bitterly, as darkness descended upon him and he waited for the crushing impact. It was always like that in the old stories, always some drawback to spoil the magic gift.  But then it was light again. The car had passed over him and he was unharmed, to the amazement--and disappointment--of the avid crowd that had gathered.  \"Pedestrians should look where they're going,\" the voice of the car observed petulantly. \"Repairs cost money.\"  Being part human, Emrys was shaken by the experience. His eye caught the brilliant sign of a bar. Here, he thought, would be syrup to soothe his nerves. And he went inside, eager to try the taste of ancient vintages of Earth--unobtainable on the other planets, since fine wines and liquors could not endure the journey through space.         *       *       *       *       *  He sipped a whisky and soda, trying not to feel disappointed at the savor. As he drank, he felt eyes upon him--the bartender's. Yet the long Qesharakan reflecting glass above the bar showed him nothing unusual about his appearance. Did the bartender know who he was? How could he?  Then Emrys noticed that the man glanced from him to someone else--a girl sitting at the other end of the bar. As she met Emrys' eye, she smiled at him. Absently, with remote appreciation of her good looks, he smiled back, then returned to the contemplation of his drink. The bartender's expression deepened to amused contempt.  Emrys realized what was wrong and he could hardly keep from laughing. So intent had he been on the pursuit of his goal that he had almost lost sight of the goal itself. Deliberately, he turned his head and smiled at the girl. She promptly smiled back.  He sat down at her side. Now that he was close, her aquamarine hair showed dark at the roots, and, through the thick golden maquillage, the pores stood out on her nose. Also, she was not so very young. He laughed then, and, when she asked why, bought her a drink. After he had bought her several more, they went to her apartment--a luxurious one in a good section of town. She was not going to be cheap, but, he thought with rising anticipation, he could afford her.  However, the night was curiously unsatisfactory. For him--apparently not for the girl, because the next morning she indignantly refused his money. Evidently the experience had been something out of the ordinary for her. He could not feel it was her fault that it had been nothing for him; the lack was in _him_, he thought, some almost-felt emotion he could not recapture.  Promising to call her, he left, went back to his hotel room and flung himself upon the resilient burim-moss couch.  His body wasn't tired, but his head ached wearily. The liquor, naturally, on an empty stomach ... after all those years of Morethan qumesht. And then the trip. Even with the Shortmire engines--standard equipment now, of course--it had taken a long, tiring time, for Morethis was the most distant of all the civilized planets. Anyone would be exhausted after such a trip. Added to all this, the accident. There were no bruises on his body yet, but later, he knew, they would be visible.         *       *       *       *       *  At last he slept, or seemed to, and dreamed he was on Morethis again--or Morethis was there with him. The air thickened about him into the tangible atmosphere of the dark planet--the swirling aniline fog that never cleared. And in the midst stood Uvrei, the high priest, robed in amethyst and sable. The term _high priest_ was vulgar as applied to him, but the nearest terrestrial equivalent to what he was.  The lips in the shockingly beautiful face parted. \"How goes it, son of my spirit?\" the familiar greeting rolled out, in the familiar voice, deep yet sweet, like dulcet thunder.  \"My head hurts, father of my soul.\" Emrys knew his voice was a petulant child's, yet he could not stop himself. \"I was promised--\"  \"You have not taken care,\" the ancient one said.  How ancient he was, Emrys did not know. The priests of Morethis were, they said, immortal. And they did live for a long, long time, far longer than the common people, whom they resembled only vaguely. Terrestrial scholars said the ruling class was a variant of the Morethan race, inbred to preserve its identity, probably closer to the original world-shaking Morethans than their debased followers. The members of this group seemed young, as coin faces seem young, also old, like coins themselves.  \"I warned you it takes time for the final adjustments to be made. Wait, my son; haste means nothing to you.\"  \"But I've waited so long,\" Emrys complained.  \"Wait a little longer, then. You have all the time in the world.\"  The fog swirled shut about him, and Emrys sank into his personal miasma of sleep. When he woke up, late"]]]
