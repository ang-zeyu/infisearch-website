When the last passenger entered the big ship--a little girl--the airlocks disconnected and the lift-ship pulled swiftly away.  It was not quite two miles from the _Star Queen_ when its emergency airlocks opened and spacesuited figures plunged out of it to emptiness. Simultaneously, the ports of the lift-ship glowed and almost immediately the whole plating turned cherry-red, crimson, and then orange, from unlimited heat developed within it.  The lift-ship went incandescent and ruptured and there was a spout of white-hot air, and then it turned blue-white and puffed itself to nothing in metallic steam. Where it had been there was only shining gas, which cooled. Beyond it there were figures in spacesuits which tried to swim away from it.  The _Star Queen's_ control room, obviously, saw the happening. The lift-ship's atomic pile had flared out of control and melted down the ship. It had developed something like sixty thousand degrees Fahrenheit when it ceased to flare. It did not blow up; it only vaporized. But the process must have begun within seconds after the lift-ship broke contact with the _Star Queen_.  In automatic reaction, the man in control of the liner cut her drive and offered to turn back and pick up the spacesuited figures in emptiness. The offer was declined with almost hysterical haste. In fact, it was barely made before the other lift-ships moved in on rescue missions. They had waited. And they were picking up castaways before the _Star Queen_ resumed its merely interplanetary drive and the process of aiming for a solar system some thirty light-years away.  When the liner flicked into overdrive, more than half the floating figures had been recovered, which was remarkable. It was almost as remarkable as the flare-up of the lift-ship's atomic pile. One has to know exactly what to do to make a properly designed atomic pile vaporize metal. Somebody had known. Somebody had done it. And the other lift-ships were waiting to pick up the destroyed lift-ship's crew when it happened.  The matter of the lift-ship's destruction was fresh in Nordenfeld's mind when Jensen had told his story. The two items fitted together with an appalling completeness. They left little doubt or hope.         *       *       *       *       *  Nordenfeld consulted the passenger records and presently was engaged in conversation with the sober-faced, composed little girl on a sofa in one of the cabin levels of the _Star Queen_.  \"You're Kathy Brand, I believe,\" he said matter-of-factly. \"I understand you've been having a rather bad time of it.\"  She seemed to consider.  \"It hasn't been too bad,\" she assured him. \"At least I've been seeing new things. I got dreadfully tired of seeing the same things all the time.\"  \"What things?\" asked Nordenfeld. His expression was not stern now, though his inner sensations were not pleasant. He needed to talk to this child, and he had learned how to talk to children. The secret is to talk exactly as to an adult, with respect and interest.  \"There weren't any windows,\" she explained, \"and my father couldn't play with me, and all the toys and books were ruined by the water. It was dreadfully tedious. There weren't any other children, you see. And presently there weren't any grownups but my father.\"  Nordenfeld only looked more interested. He'd been almost sure ever since knowing of the lift-ship's destruction and listening to Jensen's account of the rumor the government of Altaira denied. He was horribly sure now.  \"How long were you in the place that hadn't any windows?\"  \"Oh, dreadfully long!\" she said. \"Since I was only six years old! Almost half my life!\" She smiled brightly at him. \"I remember looking out of windows and even playing out-of-doors, but my father and mother said I had to live in this place. My father talked to me often and often. He was very nice. But he had to wear that funny suit and keep the glass over his face because he didn't live in the room. The glass was because he went under the water, you know.\"  Nordenfeld asked carefully conversational-sounding questions. Kathy Brand, now aged ten, had been taken by her father to live in a big room without any windows. It hadn't any doors, either. There were plants in it, and there were bluish lights to shine on the plants, and there was a place in one corner where there was water. When her father came in to talk to her, he came up out of the water wearing the funny suit with glass over his face. He went out the same way. There was a place in the wall where she could look out into another room, and at first her mother used to come and smile at her through the glass, and she talked into something she held in her hand, and her voice came inside. But later she stopped coming.         *       *       *       *       *  There was only one possible kind of place which would answer Kathy's description. When she was six years old she had been put into some university's aseptic-environment room. And she had stayed there. Such rooms were designed for biological research. They were built and then made sterile of all bacterial life and afterward entered through a tank of antiseptic. Anyone who entered wore a suit which was made germ-free by its passage through the antiseptic, and he did not breathe the air of the aseptic room, but air which was supplied him through a hose, the exhaled-air hose also passing under the antiseptic outside. No germ or microbe or virus could possibly get into such a room without being bathed in corrosive fluid which would kill it. So long as there was someone alive outside to take care of her, a little girl could live there and defy even chlorophage.  And Kathy Brand had done it. But, on the other hand, Kamerun was the only planet where it would be necessary, and it was the only world from which a father would land his small daughter on another planet's spaceport. There was no doubt. Nordenfeld grimly imagined someone--he would have had to be a microbiologist even to attempt it--fighting to survive and defeat the chlorophage while he kept his little girl in an aseptic-environment room.  She explained quite pleasantly as Nordenfeld asked more questions. There had been other people besides her father, but for a long time there had been only him. And Nordenfeld computed that somehow she'd been kept alive on the dead planet Kamerun for four long years.  Recently, though--very recently--her father told her that they were leaving. Wearing his funny, antiseptic-wetted suit, he'd enclosed her in a plastic bag with a tank attached to it. Air flowed from the tank into the bag and out through a hose that was all wetted inside. She breathed quite comfortably.  It made sense. An air tank could be heated and its contents sterilized to supply germ-free--or virus-free--air. And Kathy's father took an axe and chopped away a wall of the room. He picked her up, still inside the plastic bag, and carried her out. There was nobody about. There was no grass. There were no trees. Nothing moved.  Here Kathy's account was vague, but Nordenfeld could guess at the strangeness of a dead planet, to the child who barely remembered anything but the walls of an aseptic-environment room.  Her father carried her to a little ship, said Kathy, and they talked a lot after the ship took off. He told her that he was taking her to a place where she could run about outdoors and play, but he had to go somewhere else. He did mysterious things which to Nordenfeld meant a most scrupulous decontamination of a small spaceship's interior and its airlock. Its outer surface would reach a temperature at which no organic material could remain uncooked.  And finally, said Kathy, her father had opened a door and told her to step out and good-by, and she did, and the ship went away--her father still wearing his funny suit--and people came and asked her questions she did not understand.         *       *       *       *       *  Kathy's narrative fitted perfectly into the rumor Jensen said circulated among usually well-informed people on Altaira. They believed, said Jensen, that a small spaceship had appeared in the sky above Altaira's spaceport. It ignored all calls, landed swiftly, opened an airlock and let someone out, and plunged for the sky again. And the story said that radar telescopes immediately searched for and found the ship in space. They trailed it, calling vainly for it to identify itself, while it drove at top speed for Altaira's sun.  It reached the sun and dived in.  Nordenfeld reached the skipper on intercom vision-phone. Jensen had been called there to repeat his tale to the skipper.  \"I've talked to the child,\" said Nordenfeld grimly, \"and I'm putting her into isolation quarters in the hospital compartment. She's from Kamerun. She was kept in an aseptic-environment room at some university or other. She says her father looked after her. I get an impression of a last-ditch fight by microbiologists against the chlorophage. They lost it. Apparently her father landed her on Altaira and dived into the sun. From her story, he took every possible precaution to keep her from contagion or carrying contagion with her to Altaira. Maybe he succeeded. There's no way to tell--yet.\"  The skipper listened in silence.  Jensen said thinly, \"Then the story about the landing was true.\"  \"Yes. The authorities isolated her, and then shipped her off on the _Star Queen_. Your well-informed friends, Jensen, didn't know what their government was going to do!\" Nordenfeld paused, and said more coldly still, \"They didn't handle it right. They should have killed her, painlessly but at once. Her body should have been immersed, with everything that had touched it, in full-strength nitric acid. The same acid should have saturated the place where the ship landed and every place she walked. Every room she entered, and every hall she passed through, should have been doused with nitric and then burned. It would still not have been all one could wish.

If you travel north from Bidon Cinq 1,229 kilometers you reach Colomb-Béchar, the nearest thing to a city in southern Algeria. There are no railroads, no highways. The track through the desert is marked by oil drums filled with gravel so the wind won't blow them away. There is an oil drum every quarter of a mile or so. You go from one to the next, carrying your own fuel and water. If you get lost, the authorities come looking for you in aircraft. Sometimes they find you.  In the latter decades of the Twentieth Century, Bidon Cinq became an outpost of the Sahara Reforestation Commission which was working north from the Niger, and south from Algeria as well as east from the Atlantic. The water table in the vicinity of Bidon Cinq was considerably higher than had once been thought. Even artesian wells were possible in some localities. More practical still were springs and wells exploited by the new solar-powered pumps that in their tens of thousands were driving back the sands of the world's largest desert.  Johnny McCord and Derek Mason ate in the officer's mess, divorced from the forty or fifty Arabs and Songhai who composed their work force. It wasn't snobbery, simply a matter of being able to eat in leisure and discuss the day's activities free of the chatter of the larger mess hall.  Derek looked down into his plate. \"Hiram,\" he drawled, \"who ever invented this here _cous cous_?\"  Johnny looked over at the tall, easy-going Canadian who was his second in command and scowled dourly. He was in no humor for their usual banter. \"What's the matter with _cous cous_?\" Johnny growled.  \"I don't know,\" Derek said. \"I'm a meat and potatoes man at heart.\"  Johnny shrugged. \"_Cous cous_ serves the same purpose as potatoes do. Or rice, or spaghetti, or bread, or any of the other bland basic foods. It's what you put on it that counts.\"  Derek stared gloomily into his dish. \"Well, I wish they'd get something more interesting than ten-year-old mutton to put on this.\"  Johnny said, \"Where in the devil is Pierre? It's nearly dark.\"  \"Reuben?\" Derek drawled. \"Why Reuben went out to check the crops up in the northeast forty. Took the horse and buggy.\"  That didn't help Johnny's irritation. \"He took an air-cushion jeep, instead of a copter? Why, for heaven's sake?\"  \"He wanted to check quite a few of the pumps. Said landing and taking off was more trouble than the extra speed helped. He'll be back shortly.\"  \"He's back now,\" a voice from the door said.  Pierre Marimbert, brushing sand from his clothes, pushed into the room and made his way to the mess-hall refrigerator. He said nothing further until he had a can of beer open.  Johnny said, \"Damn it, Pierre, you shouldn't stay out this late in a jeep. If you got stuck out there, we'd have one hell of a time finding you. In a copter you've at least got the radio.\"  Pierre had washed the dust from his throat. Now he said quietly, \"I wanted to check on as many pumps as I could.\"  \"You could have gone back tomorrow. The things are supposed to be self-sufficient, no checking necessary more than once every three months. There's practically nothing that can go wrong with them.\"  Pierre finished off the can of beer, reached into the refrigerator for another. \"Dynamite can go wrong with them,\" he said.         *       *       *       *       *  The other two looked at him, shocked silent.  Pierre said, \"I don't know how many altogether. I found twenty-two of the pumps in the vicinity of In Ziza had been blown to smithereens--out of forty I checked.\"  Johnny rapped, \"How long ago? How many trees...?\"  Pierre laughed sourly. \"I don't know how long ago. The transplants, especially the slash pine, are going to be just so much kindling before I get new pumps in.\"  Derek said, shocked, \"That's our oldest stand.\"  Pierre Marimbert, a forty-year-old, sun-beaten Algerian _colon_, eldest man on the team, sank into his place at the table. He poured the balance of his can of beer into a glass.  Johnny said, \"What ... what can we do? How many spare pumps can you get into there, and how soon?\"  Pierre looked up at him wearily. \"You didn't quite hear what I said, Johnny. I only checked forty. Forty out of nearly a thousand in that vicinity. Twenty-two of them were destroyed, better than fifty percent. For all I know, that percentage applies throughout the whole In Ziza area. If so, there's damn few of your trees going to be left alive. We have a few spare pumps on hand here, but we'd have to get a really large number all the way from Dakar.\"  Derek said softly, \"That took a lot of men and a lot of dynamite. Which means a lot of transport--and a lot of money. We've had trouble before, but usually it was disgruntled nomads, getting revenge for losing their grazing land.\"  Johnny snorted, \"Damn little grazing this far north.\"  Derek nodded. \"I'm simply saying that even if we could blame our minor sabotage on the Tuareg in the past, we can't do it this time. There's money behind anything this big.\"  Johnny McCord said wearily, \"Let's eat. In the morning we'll go out and take a look. I'd better call Timbuktu on this. If nothing else, the Mali Federation can send troops out to protect us.\"  Derek grunted. \"With a standing army of about 25,000 men, they're going to patrol a million and a half square miles of desert?\"  \"Can you think of anything else to do?\"  \"No.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Pierre Marimbert began dishing _cous cous_ into a soup plate, then poured himself a glass of _vin ordinaire_. He said, \"I can't think of a better place for saboteurs. Twenty men could do millions of dollars of destruction and never be found.\"  Johnny growled, \"It's not as bad as all that. They've got to eat and drink, and so do their animals. There are damned few places where they can.\"  From the door a voice said, \"I am intruding?\"  They hadn't heard her car come up. The three men scrambled to their feet.  \"Good evening,\" Johnny McCord blurted.  \"Hell ... o!\" Derek breathed.  Pierre Marimbert was across the room, taking her in hand. \"_Bonjour, Mademoiselle. Que puis-je faire pour vous? Voulez-vous une biere bien fraiche ou un apéritif? Il fait trés chaud dans le desert._\" He led her toward the table.  \"Easy, easy there, Reuben,\" Derek grumbled. \"The young lady speaks English. Give a man a chance.\"  Johnny was placing a chair for her. \"Paul Peterson, from Poste Weygand, radioed that you were coming. You're a little late, Mademoiselle Desage.\"  She was perhaps thirty, slim, long-legged, Parisian style. Even at Bidon Cinq, half a world away from the Champs Elysées, she maintained her chic.  She made a moue at Johnny, while taking the chair he held. \"I had hoped to surprise you, catch you off guard.\" She took in the sun-dried, dour-faced American wood technologist appraisingly, then turned her eyes in turn to Derek and Pierre.  \"You three are out here all alone?\" she said demurely.  \"Desperately,\" Derek said.  Johnny McCord said, \"Mademoiselle Hélène Desage, I am John McCord, and these are my associates, Monsieur Pierre Marimbert and Mr. Derek Mason. Gentlemen, Mademoiselle Desage is with _Paris Match_, the French equivalent of _Life_, so I understand. In short, she is undoubtedly here for a story. So ixnay on the ump-pays.\"  \"I would love cold beer,\" Hélène Desage said to Pierre, and to Johnny McCord, \"These days a traveling reporter for _Paris Match_ must be quite a linguist. My English, Spanish and Italian are excellent. My German passable. And while I am not fluent in Pig-Latin, I can follow it. What is this you are saying about the pumps?\"  \"Oh, Lord,\" Johnny said. \"Perhaps I'll tell you in the morning. But for now, would you like to clean up before supper? You must be exhausted after that 260 kilometers from Poste Weygand.\"  Pierre said hurriedly, \"I'll take Mademoiselle Desage over to one of the guest bungalows.\"  \"Zut!\" she said. \"The sand! It is even worse than between Reggan and Poste Weygand. Do you realize that until I began coming across your new forests I saw no life at all between these two posts?\"  The three forestry experts bowed in unison, as though rehearsed. \"Mademoiselle,\" Derek, from the heart, \"calling our transplant forests is the kindest thing you could have said in these parts.\"  They all laughed and Pierre led her from the room.  Derek looked at Johnny McCord. \"Wow, that was a slip mentioning the pumps.\"  Johnny was looking through the door after her. \"I suppose so,\" he said sourly. \"I'll have to radio the brass and find out the line we're supposed to take with her. That's the biggest magazine in the French-speaking world and you don't get a job on it without knowing the journalistic ropes. That girl can probably smell a story as far as a Tuareg can smell water.\"  \"Well, then undoubtedly she's already sniffing. Because, between that clan of Tuareg with its flocks and the pump saboteurs, we've got more stories around here than I ever expected!\"   III  In the morning Hélène Desage managed to look the last word in what desert fashion should be, when she strolled into Johnny McCord's office. Although she came complete with a sun helmet that must have been the product of a top Parisian shop, she would have been more at place on the beaches at Miami, Honolulu or Cannes. Her shorts were short and fitting, her blouse silken, her walking shoes dainty.  He considered for a moment and then decided against informing her that Moslems, particularly in this part of the world, were little used to seeing semi-nude women strolling about. He'd leave the job of explanation to Pierre, as a fellow Frenchman and the oldest man present to boot.  \"_Bonjour_,\" she said. \"What a lovely day. I have been strolling about your little oasis. But you have made it a garden!\"  \"Thanks,\" Johnny said. \"We've got to have something to do after working hours. Entertainment is on the scarce side. But it's more than a garden. We've been experimenting to see just what trees will take to"]]]
