Unknowing where her fingers stray'd,                     She weeping turned away and said,'                     Oh, my sweet mother, 'tis in vain,                      I cannot weave as once I wove;                     So wilder'd is my heart and brain                     With thinking of that youth I love.'\"  If my space allowed I could add much more on this subject, but will permit myself only one remark in conclusion.  Lovers delighted in nature then as now; the moon was their chosen confidante, and I know of no modern poem in which the mysterious charm of a summer night and the magic beauty which lies on flowers, trees and fountains in those silent hours when the world is asleep, is more exquisitely described than in the following verses, also by Sappho, at the reading of which we seem forced to breathe more slowly, \"kuhl bis an's Herz hinan.\"                     \"Planets, that around the beauteous moon                     Attendant wait, cast into shade                     Their ineffectual lustres, soon                     As she, in full-orb'd majesty array'd,                     Her silver radiance pours                     Upon this world of ours.\"  and:--                     \"Thro' orchard plots with fragrance crown'd,                     The clear cold fountain murm'ring flows;                     And forest leaves, with rustling sound,                     Invite to soft repose.\"  The foregoing remarks seemed to me due to those who consider a love such as that of Sappho and Bartja to have been impossible among the ancients. Unquestionably it was much rarer then than in these days: indeed I confess to having sketched my pair of lovers in somewhat bright colors. But may I not be allowed, at least once, to claim the poet's freedom?  How seldom I have availed myself of this freedom will be evident from the notes included in each volume.  They seemed to me necessary, partly in order to explain the names and illustrate the circumstances mentioned in the text, and partly to vindicate the writer in the eyes of the learned. I trust they may not prove discouraging to any, as the text will be found easily readable without reference to the explanations.       Jena, November 23, 1868.                               GEORG EBERS, DR.    PREFACE TO THE FOURTH GERMAN EDITION.  Two years and a half after the appearance of the third edition of \"An Egyptian Princess,\" a fourth was needed.  I returned long since from the journey to the Nile, for which I was preparing while correcting the proof-sheets of the third edition, and on which I can look back with special satisfaction.  During my residence in Egypt, in 1872-73, a lucky accident enabled me to make many new discoveries; among them one treasure of incomparable value, the great hieratic manuscript, which bears my name.  Its publication has just been completed, and it is now in the library of the Leipzig University.  The Papyrus Ebers, the second in size and the best preserved of all the ancient Egyptian manuscripts which have come into our possession, was written in the 16th century B. C., and contains on 110 pages the hermetic book upon the medicines of the ancient Egyptians, known also to the Alexandrine Greeks.  The god Thoth (Hermes) is called \"the guide\" of physicians, and the various writings and treatises of which the work is composed are revelations from him.  In this venerable scroll diagnoses are made and remedies suggested for the internal and external diseases of most portions of the human body.  With the drugs prescribed are numbers, according to which they are weighed with weights and measured with hollow measures, and accompanying the prescriptions are noted the pious axioms to be repeated by the physician, while compounding and giving them to the patient.  On the second line of the first page of our manuscript, it is stated that it came from Sais.  A large portion of this work is devoted to the visual organs.  On the twentieth line of the fifty-fifth page begins the book on the eyes, which fills eight large pages.  We were formerly compelled to draw from Greek and Roman authors what we knew about the remedies used for diseases of the eye among the ancient Egyptians.  The portion of the Papyrus Ebers just mentioned is now the only Egyptian source from whence we can obtain instruction concerning this important branch of ancient medicine.  All this scarcely seems to have a place in the preface of a historical romance, and yet it is worthy of mention here; for there is something almost \"providential\" in the fact that it was reserved for the author of \"An Egyptian Princess\" to bestow the gift of this manuscript upon the scientific world.  Among the characters in the novel the reader will meet an oculist from Sais, who wrote a book upon the diseases of the visual organs.  The fate of this valuable work exactly agrees with the course of the narrative.  The papyrus scroll of the Sais oculist, which a short time ago existed only in the imagination of the author and readers of \"An Egyptian Princess,\" is now an established fact.  When I succeeded in bringing the manuscript home, I felt like the man who had dreamed of a treasure, and when he went out to ride found it in his path.  A reply to Monsieur Jules Soury's criticism of \"An Egyptian Princess\" in the Revue des deux Mondes, Vol. VII, January 1875, might appropriately be introduced into this preface, but would scarcely be possible without entering more deeply into the ever-disputed question, which will be answered elsewhere, whether the historical romance is ever justifiable. Yet I cannot refrain from informing Monsieur Soury here that \"An Egyptian Princess\" detained me from no other work.  I wrote it in my sick-room, before entering upon my academic career, and while composing it, found not only comfort and pleasure, but an opportunity to give dead scientific material a living interest for myself and others.  Monsieur Soury says romance is the mortal enemy of history; but this sentence may have no more justice than the one with which I think myself justified in replying: Landscape painting is the mortal enemy of botany. The historical romance must be enjoyed like any other work of art.  No one reads it to study history; but many, the author hopes, may be aroused by his work to make investigations of their own, for which the notes point out the way.  Already several persons of excellent mental powers have been attracted to earnest Egyptological researches by \"An Egyptian Princess.\"  In the presence of such experiences, although Monsieur Soury's clever statements appear to contain much that is true, I need not apply his remark that \"historical romances injure the cause of science\" to the present volume.            Leipzig, April 19, 1875.                                          GEORG EBERS.    PREFACE TO THE FIFTH GERMAN EDITION.  Again a new edition of \"An Egyptian Princess\" has been required, and again I write a special preface because the printing has progressed so rapidly as unfortunately to render it impossible for me to correct some errors to which my attention was directed by the kindness of the well- known botanist, Professor Paul Ascherson of Berlin, who has travelled through Egypt and the Oases.  In Vol. I, page 7, I allow mimosas to grow among other plants in Rhodopis' garden.  I have found them in all the descriptions of the Nile valley, and afterwards often enjoyed the delicious perfume of the golden yellow flowers in the gardens of Alexandria and Cairo.  I now learn that this very mimosa (Acacia farnesiana) originates in tropical America, and was undoubtedly unknown in ancient Egypt.  The bananas, which I mentioned in Vol. I, p. 64, among other Egyptian plants, were first introduced into the Nile valley from India by the Arabs.  The botanical errors occurring in the last volume I was able to correct.  Helm's admirable work on \"Cultivated Plants and Domestic Animals\" had taught me to notice such things.  Theophrastus, a native of Asia Minor, gives the first description of a citron, and this proves that he probably saw the so- called paradise-apple, but not our citron, which I am therefore not permitted to mention among the plants cultivated in ancient Lydia.  Palms and birches are both found in Asia Minor; but I permitted them to grow side by side, thereby committing an offense against the geographical possibility of vegetable existence.  The birch, in this locality, flourishes in the mountainous region, the palm, according to Griesbach (Vegetation of the Earth, Vol. I, p. 319) only appears on the southern coast of the peninsula.  The latter errors, as I previously mentioned, will be corrected in the new edition.  I shall of course owe special thanks to any one who may call my attention to similar mistakes.       Leipzig, March 5, 1877                                     GEORG EBERS    PREFACE TO THE NINTH GERMAN EDITION.  I have nothing to add to the ninth edition of \"An Egyptian Princess\" except that it has been thoroughly revised.  My sincere thanks are due to Dr. August Steitz of Frankfort on the Main, who has travelled through Egypt and Asia Minor, for a series of admirable notes, which he kindly placed at my disposal.  He will find that they have not remained unused.       Leipzig, November 13, 1879.                                         GEORG EBERS     AN EGYPTIAN PRINCESS.  By Georg Ebers  Volume 1.    CHAPTER I.  The Nile had overflowed its bed.  The luxuriant corn-fields and blooming gardens on its shores were lost beneath a boundless waste of waters; and only the gigantic temples and palaces of its cities, (protected from the force of the water by dikes), and the tops of the tall palm-trees and acacias could be seen above its surface.  The branches of the sycamores and plane-trees drooped and floated on the waves, but the boughs of the tall silver poplars strained upward, as if anxious to avoid the watery world beneath.

You knew him, you can understand what I mean. Now, mention your wish; my heart is as calmly quiet as the Nile waters which are flowing by so quietly, and I am ready to hear it, be it good or evil.\"  \"I am glad to see you thus,\" said the Athenian.  \"If you had remembered the noble friend of wisdom, as Pythagoras was wont to call himself a little sooner, your soul would have regained its balance yesterday.  The master enjoins us to look back every evening on the events, feelings and actions of the day just past.  \"Now had you done this, you would have felt that the unfeigned admiration of all your guests, among whom were men of distinguished merit, outweighed a thousandfold the injurious words of a drunken libertine; you would have felt too that you were a friend of the gods, for was it not in your house that the immortals gave that noble old man at last, after his long years of misfortune, the greatest joy that can fall to the lot of any human being? and did they not take from you one friend only in order to replace him in the same moment, by another and a better?  Come, I will hear no contradiction.  Now for my request.  \"You know that people sometimes call me an Athenian, sometimes a Halikarnassian.  Now, as the Ionian, AEolian and Dorian mercenaries have never been on good terms with the Karians, my almost triple descent (if I may call it so) has proved very useful to me as commander of both these divisions.  Well qualified as Aristomachus may be for the command, yet in this one point Amasis will miss me; for I found it an easy matter to settle the differences among the troops and keep them at peace, while he, as a Spartan, will find it very difficult to keep right with the Karian soldiers.  \"This double nationality of mine arises from the fact that my father married a Halikarnassian wife out of a noble Dorian family, and, at the time of my birth, was staying with her in Halikarnassus, having come thither in order to take possession of her parental inheritance.  So, though I was taken back to Athens before I was three months old, I must still be called a Karian, as a man's native land is decided by his birthplace.  \"In Athens, as a young nobleman, belonging to that most aristocratic and ancient family, the Philaidae, I was reared and educated in all the pride of an Attic noble.  Pisistratus, brave and clever, and though of equal, yet by no means of higher birth, than ourselves, for there exists no family more aristocratic than my father's, gained possession of the supreme authority.  Twice, the nobles, by uniting all their strength, succeeded in overthrowing him, and when, the third time, assisted by Lygdamis of Naxos, the Argives and Eretrians, he attempted to return, we opposed him again.  We had encamped by the temple of Minerva at Pallene, and were engaged in sacrificing to the goddess, early, before our first meal, when we were suddenly surprised by the clever tyrant, who gained an easy, bloodless victory over our unarmed troops.  As half of the entire army opposed to the tyrant was under my command, I determined rather to die than yield, fought with my whole strength, implored the soldiers to remain steadfast, resisted without yielding a point, but fell at last with a spear in my shoulder.  \"The Pisistratidae became lords of Athens.  I fled to Halikarnassus, my second home, accompanied by my wife and children.  There, my name being known through some daring military exploits, and, through my having once conquered in the Pythian games, I was appointed to a command in the mercenary troops of the King of Egypt; accompanied the expedition to Cyprus, shared with Aristomachus the renown of having conquered the birthplace of Aphrodite for Amasis, and finally was named commander-in- chief of all the mercenaries in Egypt.  \"Last summer my wife died; our children, a boy of eleven and a girl of ten years, remained with an aunt in Halikarnassus.  But she too has followed to the inexorable Hades, and so, only a few days ago I sent for the little ones here.  They cannot, however, possibly reach Naukratis in less than three weeks, and yet they will already have set out on their journey before a letter to countermand my first order could reach them.  \"I must leave Egypt in fourteen days, and cannot therefore receive them myself.  \"My own intentions are to go to the Thracian Chersonese, where my uncle, as you know, has been called to fill a high office among the Dolonki. The children shall follow me thither; my faithful old slave Korax will remain in Naukratis on purpose to bring them to me.  \"Now, if you will show to me that you are in deed and truth my friend, will you receive the little ones and take care of them till the next ship sails for Thrace?  But above all, will you carefully conceal them from the eyes of the crown-prince's spies?  You know that Psamtik hates me mortally, and he could easily revenge himself on the father through the children.  I ask you for this great favor, first, because I know your kindness by experience; and secondly, because your house has been made secure by the king's letter of guarantee, and they will therefore be safe here from the inquiries of the police; notwithstanding that, by the laws of this most formal country, all strangers, children not excepted, must give up their names to the officer of the district.  \"You can now judge of the depth of my esteem, Rhodopis; I am committing into your hands all that makes life precious to me; for even my native land has ceased to be dear while she submits so ignominiously to her tyrants.  Will you then restore tranquillity to an anxious father's heart, will you--?\"  \"I will, Phanes, I will!\"  cried the aged woman in undisguised delight. \"You are not asking me for any thing, you are presenting me with a gift. Oh, how I look forward already to their arrival!  And how glad Sappho will be, when the little creatures come and enliven her solitude!  But this I can assure you, Phanes, I shall not let my little guests depart with the first Thracian ship.  You can surely afford to be separated from them one short half-year longer, and I promise you they shall receive the best lessons, and be guided to all that is good and beautiful.\"  \"On that head I have no fear,\" answered Phanes, with a thankful smile. \"But still you must send off the two little plagues by the first ship; my anxiety as to Psamtik's revenge is only too well grounded.  Take my most heartfelt thanks beforehand for all the love and kindness which you will show to my children.  I too hope and believe, that the merry little creatures will be an amusement and pleasure to Sappho in her lonely life.\"  \"And more,\" interrupted Rhodopis looking down; \"this proof of confidence repays a thousand-fold the disgrace inflicted on me last night in a moment of intoxication.--But here comes Sappho!\"     CHAPTER IV.  Five days after the evening we have just described at Rhodopis' house, an immense multitude was to be seen assembled at the harbor of Sais.  Egyptians of both sexes, and of every age and class were thronging to the water's edge.  Soldiers and merchants, whose various ranks in society were betokened by the length of their white garments, bordered with colored fringes, were interspersed among the crowd of half-naked, sinewy men, whose only clothing consisted of an apron, the costume of the lower classes.  Naked children crowded, pushed and fought to get the best places.  Mothers in short cloaks were holding their little ones up to see the sight, which by this means they entirely lost themselves; and a troop of dogs and cats were playing and fighting at the feet of these eager sight-seers, who took the greatest pains not to tread on, or in any way injure the sacred animals.       [According to various pictures on the Egyptian monuments.  The      mothers are from Wilkinson III.  363.  Isis and Hathor, with the      child Horus in her lap or at her breast, are found in a thousand      representations, dating both from more modern times and in the Greek      style.  The latter seem to have served as a model for the earliest      pictures of the Madonna holding the infant Christ.]  The police kept order among this huge crowd with long staves, on the metal heads of which the king's name was inscribed.  Their care was especially needed to prevent any of the people from being pushed into the swollen Nile, an arm of which, in the season of the inundations, washes the walls of Sais.  On the broad flight of steps which led between two rows of sphinxes down to the landing-place of the royal boats, was a very different kind of assembly.  The priests of the highest rank were seated there on stone benches.  Many wore long, white robes, others were clad in aprons, broad jewelled collars, and garments of panther skins.  Some had fillets adorned with plumes that waved around brows, temples, and the stiff structures of false curls that floated over their shoulders; others displayed the glistening bareness of their smoothly-shaven skulls.  The supreme judge was distinguished by the possession of the longest and handsomest plume in his head-dress, and a costly sapphire amulet, which, suspended by a gold chain, hung on his breast.  The highest officers of the Egyptian army wore uniforms of gay colors,97 and carried short swords in their girdles.  On the right side of the steps a division of the body-guard was stationed, armed with battleaxes, daggers, bows, and large shields; on the left, were the Greek mercenaries, armed in Ionian fashion.  Their new leader, our friend Aristomachus, stood with a few of his own officers apart from the Egyptians, by the colossal statues of Psamtik I., which had been erected on the space above the steps, their faces towards the river.  In front of these statues, on a silver chair, sat Psamtik, the heir to the throne: He wore a close-fitting garment of many colors, interwoven with gold, and was surrounded by the"]]]
