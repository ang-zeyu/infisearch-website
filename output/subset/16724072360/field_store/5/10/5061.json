One knows what to expect in county Tryon--but not here, Loskiel--not here.\"  \"Our business here is like to be ended tomorrow,\" I remarked.  \"Thank God for that,\" he said heartily, rising and buckling on his war belt. He added: \"As for any recruits we have been ordered to pick up en passant, I see small chance of that accomplishment hereabout. Will you summon the landlord, Mr. Loskiel?\"  I discovered the man standing at the open door, his warn hands clasped behind him, and staring stupidly at the cloudless sky. He followed me back to the taproom, and we reckoned with him. Somehow, I thought he had not expected to be paid a penny--yet he did not thank us.  \"Are you not Benjamin Hays?\" inquired Boyd, carelessly retying his purse.  The fellow seemed startled to hear his own name pronounced so loudly, but answered very quietly that he was.  \"This house belongs to a great villain, one James Holmes, does it not?\" demanded Boyd.  \"Yes, sir,\" he whispered.  \"How do you come to keep an ordinary here?\"  \"The town authorities required an ordinary. I took it in charge, as they desired.\"  \"Oh! Where is this rascal, Holmes?\"  \"Gone below, sir, some time since.\"  \"I have heard so. Was he not formerly Colonel of the 4th regiment?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"And deserted his men, eh? And they made him Lieutenant-Colonel below, did they not?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Colonel--of what?\" snarled Boyd in disgust.  \"Of the Westchester Refugee Irregulars.\"  \"Oh! Well, look out for him and his refugees. He'll be back here one of these days, I'm thinking.\"  \"He has been back.\"  \"What did he do?\"  The man said listlessly: \"It was like other visits. They robbed, tortured, and killed. Some they burnt with hot ashes, some they hung, cut down, and hung again when they revived. Most of the sheep, cattle, and horses were driven off. Last year thousands of bushels of fruit decayed in the orchards; the ripened grain lay rotting where wind and rain had laid it; no hay was cut, no grain milled.\"  \"Was this done by the banditti from the lower party?\"  \"Yes, sir; and by the leather-caps, too. The leather-caps stood guard while the Tories plundered and killed. It is usually that way, sir. And our own renegades are as bad. We in Westchester have to entertain them all.\"  \"But they burn no houses?\"  \"Not yet, sir. They have promised to do so next time.\"  \"Are there no troops here?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"What troops?\"  \"Colonel Thomas's Regiment and Sheldon's Horse and the Minute Men.\"  \"Well, what the devil are they about to permit this banditti to terrify and ravage a peaceful land?\" demanded Boyd.  \"The country is of great extent,\" said the man mildly. \"It would require many troops to cover it. And His Excellency has very, very few.\"  \"Yes,\" said Boyd, \"that is true. We know how it is in the North--with hundreds of miles to guard and but a handful of men. And it must be that way.\" He made no effort to throw off his seriousness and nodded toward me with a forced smile. \"I am twenty-two years of age,\" he said, \"and Mr. Loskiel here is no older, and we fully expect that when we both are past forty we will still be fighting in this same old war. Meanwhile,\" he added laughing, \"every patriot should find some lass to wed and breed the soldiers we shall require some sixteen years hence.\"  The man's smile was painful; he smiled because he thought we expected it; and I turned away disheartened, ashamed, burning with a fierce resentment against the fate that in three years had turned us into what we were--we Americans who had never known the lash--we who had never learned to fear a master.  Boyd said: \"There is a gentleman, one Major Ebenezer Lockwood, hereabouts. Do you know him?\"  \"No, sir.\"  \"What? Why, that seems strange!\"  The man's face paled, and he remained silent for a few moments. Then, furtively, his eyes began for the hundredth time to note the details of our forest dress, stealing stealthily from the fringe on legging and hunting shirt to the Indian beadwork on moccasin and baldrick, devouring every detail as though to convince himself. I think our pewter buttons did it for him.  Boyd said gravely: \"You seem to doubt us, Mr. Hays,\" and read in the man's unsteady eyes distrust of everything on earth--and little faith in God.  \"I do not blame you,\" said I gently. \"Three years of hell burn deep.\"  \"Yes,\" he said, \"three years. And, as you say, sir, there was fire.\"  He stood quietly silent for a space, then, looking timidly at me, he rolled back his sleeves, first one, then the other, to the shoulders. Then he undid the bandages.  \"What is all that?\" asked Boyd harshly.  \"The seal of the marauders, sir.\"  \"They burnt you? God, man, you are but one living sore! Did any white man do that to you?\"  \"With hot horse-shoes. It will never quite heal, they say.\"  I saw the lieutenant shudder. The only thing he ever feared was fire--if it could be said of him that he feared anything. And he had told me that, were he taken by the Iroquois, he had a pistol always ready to blow out his brains.  Boyd had begun to pace the room, doubling and undoubling his nervous fingers. The landlord replaced the oil-soaked rags, rolled down his sleeves again, and silently awaited our pleasure.  \"Why do you hesitate to tell us where we may find Major Lockwood?\" I asked gently.  For the first time the man looked me full in the face. And after a moment I saw his expression alter, as though some spark--something already half dead within him was faintly reviving.  \"They have set a price on Major Lockwood's head,\" he said; and Boyd halted to listen--and the man looked him in the eyes for a moment.  My lieutenant carried his commission with him, though contrary to advice and practice among men engaged on such a mission as were we. It was folded in his beaded shot-pouch, and now he drew it out and displayed it.  After a silence, Hays said:  \"The old Lockwood Manor House stands on the south side of the village of Poundridge. It is the headquarters and rendezvous of Sheldon's Horse. The Major is there.\"  \"Poundridge lies to the east of Bedford?\"  \"Yes, sir, about five miles.\"  \"Where is the map, Loskiel?\"  Again I drew it from my hunting shirt; we examined it, and Hays pointed out the two routes.  Boyd looked up at Hays absently, and said: \"Do you know Luther Kinnicut?\"  This time all the colour fled the man's face, and it was some moments before the sudden, unreasoning rush of terror in that bruised mind had subsided sufficiently for him to compose his thoughts. Little by little, however, he came to himself again, dimly conscious that he trusted us--perhaps the first strangers or even neighbours whom he had trusted in years.  \"Yes, sir, I know him,\" he said in a low voice.  \"Where is he?\"  \"Below--on our service.\"  But it was Luther Kinnicut, the spy, whom we had come to interview, as well as to see Major Lockwood, and Boyd frowned thoughtfully.  I said: \"The Indians hereabout are Mohican, are they not, Mr. Hays?\"  \"They were,\" he replied; and his very apathy gave the answer a sadder significance.  \"Have they all gone off?\" asked Boyd, misunderstanding.  \"There were very few Mohicans to go. But they have gone.\"  \"Below?\"  \"Oh, no, sir. They and the Stockbridge Indians, and the Siwanois are friendly to our party.\"  \"There was a Sagamore,\" I said, \"of the Siwanois, named Mayaro. We believe that Luther Kinnicut knows where this Sagamore is to be found. But how are we to first find Kinnicut?\"  \"Sir,\" he said, \"you must ask Major Lockwood that. I know not one Indian from the next, only that the savages hereabout are said to be favourable to our party.\"  Clearly there was nothing more to learn from this man. So we thanked him and strapped on our accoutrements, while he went away to the barn to bring up our horses. And presently our giant rifleman appeared leading the horses, and still munching a bough-apple, scarce ripe, which he dropped into the bosom of his hunting shirt when he discovered us watching him.  Boyd laughed: \"Munch away, Jack, and welcome,\" he said, \"only mind thy manners when we sight regular troops. I'll have nobody reproaching Morgan's corps that the men lack proper respect--though many people seem to think us but a parcel of militia where officer and man herd cheek by jowl.\"  On mounting, he turned in his saddle and asked Hays what we had to fear on our road, if indeed we were to apprehend anything.  \"There is some talk of the Legion Cavalry, sir--Major Tarleton's command.\"  \"Anything definite?\"  \"No, sir--only the talk when men of our party meet. And Major Lockwood has a price on his head.\"  \"Oh! Is that all?\"  \"That is all, sir.\"  Boyd nodded laughingly, wheeled his horse, and we rode slowly out into the Bedford Road, the mounted rifleman dogging our heels.  From every house in Bedford we knew that we were watched as we rode; and what they thought of us in our flaunting rifle dress, or what they took us to be--enemy or friend--I cannot imagine, the uniform of our corps being strange in these parts. However, they must have known us for foresters and riflemen of one party or t'other; and, as we advanced, and there being only three of us, and on a highway, too, very near to the rendezvous of an American dragoon regiment, the good folk not only peeped out at us from between partly closed shutters, but even ventured to open their doors and stand gazing after we had ridden by.  Every pretty maid he saw seemed to comfort Boyd prodigiously, which was always the case; and as here and there a woman smiled faintly at him the last vestige of sober humour left him and he was more like the reckless, handsome young man I had come to care for a great deal, if not wholly to esteem.  The difference in rank between us permitted him to relax if he chose; and though His Excellency and our good Baron were ever dinning discipline and careful respect for rank into the army's"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4989"],["title","A Sweet Girl Graduate (#1)"],["body"," with their rich glory of architecture and the smooth lawns of the college gardens as they sloped gently down to the river.  St. Benet’s, the college for women, was approached by a private road, and high entrance gates obstructed the gaze of the curious. Inside there were cheerful halls and pleasant gardens and gay, fresh, unrestrained life. But the passer-by got no peep of these things unless the high gates happened to be open.  This was the first evening of term, and most of the girls were back. There was nothing very particular going on, and they were walking about the gardens, and greeting old friends, and telling each other their experiences, and more or less picking up the threads which had been broken or loosened in the long vacation.  The evenings were drawing in, but the pleasant twilight which was soon to be rendered brilliant by the full moon seemed to the girls even nicer than broad daylight to linger about in. They did not want to go into the houses; they flitted about in groups here and there, chatting and laughing merrily.  St. Benet’s had three halls, each with its own vice-principal, and a certain number of resident students. Each hall stood in its own grounds and was more or less a complete home in itself. There were resident lecturers and demonstrators for the whole college and one lady principal, who took the lead and was virtually head of the college.  Miss Vincent was the name of the present principal. She was an old lady and had a vice-principal under her at Vincent Hall, the largest and newest of these spacious homes, where young women received the advantages of university instruction to prepare them for the battle of life.  Priscilla was to live at Heath Hall— a slightly smaller house, which stood at a little distance away— its grounds being divided from the grounds of Vincent Hall by means of a rustic paling. Miss Heath was the very popular vice-principal of this hall, and Prissie was considered a fortunate girl to obtain a home in her house. She sat now a forlorn and rather scared young person, huddled up in one corner of the fly which turned in at the wide gates, and finally deposited her and her luggage at the back entrance of Heath Hall.  Priscilla looked out in the darkness of the autumn night with frightened eyes. She hated herself for feeling nervous. She had told Aunt Raby that, of course, she would have no silly tremors, yet here she was trembling and scarcely able to pay the cabman his fare.  She heard a girl’s laugh in the distance, and it caused her to start so violently that she dropped one of her few treasured sixpences, which went rolling about aimlessly almost under the horse’s hoofs.  “Stop a minute, I’ll find it for you,” said a voice. A tall girl with big, brown eyes suddenly darted into view, picked up the sixpence as if by magic, popped it into Priscilla’s hand and then vanished. Priscilla knew that this was the girl who had laughed; she heard her laughing again as she turned to join some one who was standing beside a laurel hedge. The two linked their arms together and walked off in the darkness.  “Such a frightened poor fresher!” said the girl who had picked up the sixpence to her companion.  “Maggie,” said the other in a warning voice, “I know you, I know what you mean to do.”  “My dear, good Nancy, it is more than I know myself. What awful indiscretion does your prophetic soul see me perpetrating?”  “Oh, Maggie, as if anything could change your nature! You know you’ll take up that miserable fresher for about a fortnight, and make her imagine that you are going to be excellent friends for the rest of your life, and then— p—— f! you’ll snuff her out as if she had never existed; I know you, Maggie, and I call it cruel.”  “Is not that Miss Banister I hear talking?” said a voice quite close to the two girls.  They both turned, and immediately with heightened color rushed up eagerly to shake hands with the vice-principal of their college.  “How do you do, my dears?” she said in a hearty voice. “Are you quite well, Maggie, and you, Nancy? Had you a pleasant holiday? And did you two great chums spend it together?”  The girls began answering eagerly; some other girls came up and joined the group, all anxious to shake hands with Miss Heath and to get a word of greeting from her.  At this moment the dressing-gong for dinner sounded, and the little group moved slowly toward the house.  In the entrance hall numbers of girls who had recently arrived were standing about; all had a nod, or a smile, or a kiss for Maggie Oliphant.  “How do you do, Miss Oliphant? Come and see me to-night in my room, won’t you, dear?” issued from many throats.  Maggie promised in her good-natured, affectionate, wholesale way.  Nancy Banister was also greeted by several friends. She, too, was gay and bright, but quieter than Maggie. Her face was more reliable in its expression, but not nearly so beautiful.  “If you accept all these invitations, Maggie,” she said as the two girls walked down the corridor which led to their rooms, “you know you will have to sit up until morning. Why will you say ‘yes’ to every one? You know it only causes disappointment and jealousy.”  Maggie laughed.  “My dear, good creature, don’t worry your righteous soul,” she answered. “I’ll call on all the girls I can, and the others must grin and bear it. Now we have barely time to change our dresses for dinner. Surely, though, Nance, there’s a light under Annabel Lee’s door. Who have they dared to put into her room? It must be one of those wretched freshers. I don’t think I can bear it. I shall have to go away into another corridor.”  “Maggie, dear— you are far too sensitive. Could the college afford to keep a room empty because poor, dear Annie Lee occupied it?”  “They could, they ought,” burst from Maggie. She stamped her foot with anger. “That room is a shrine to me. It will always be a shrine. I shall hate the person who lives in it.” Tears filled her bright brown eyes. Her arched, proud lips trembled. She opened her door, and going into her room, shut it with a bang, almost in Nancy Banister’s face.  Nancy stood still for a moment. A quick sigh came from her lips.  “Maggie is the dearest girl in the college,” she said to herself; “the dearest, the sweetest, the prettiest, yet also the most tantalizing, the most provoking, the most inconsequent. It is the greatest wonder she has kept so long out of some serious scrape. She will never leave here without doing something outrageous, and yet there isn’t a girl in the place to be named with her. I wish—” here Nancy sighed again and put her hand to her brow as if to chase away some perplexity.  Then, after a moment’s hesitation, she went up to the door of the room next to Maggie’s and knocked.  There was a moment’s silence, then a constrained voice said:  “Come in.”  Nancy entered at once.  Priscilla Peel was standing in the center of the room. The electric light was turned on, revealing the bareness and absence of all ornament of the apartment; a fire was laid in the grate but not lit, and Priscilla’s ugly square trunk, its canvas covering removed, stood in a prominent position, half on the hearthrug, half on the square of carpet which covered the center of the floor. Priscilla had taken off her jacket and hat. She had washed her hands, and removed her muddy boots, and smoothed out her straight, light brown hair. She looked what she felt— a very stiff and unformed specimen of girlhood. There was a great lump in her throat, brought there by mingled nervousness and home-sickness, but that very fact only made her manner icy and repellent.  “Forgive me,” said Nancy, blushing all over her rosy face. “I thought perhaps you might like to know one or two things as you are quite strange here. My name is Banister. I have a room in the same corridor, but quite at the other end. You must come and visit me presently. Oh, has no one lit your fire? Wouldn’t you like one? The evenings are turning so chilly now, and a fire in one’s room gives one a home-like feeling, doesn’t it? Shall I light it for you?”  “No, no, thank you,” said Priscilla stiffly. She longed to rush at Nancy and smother her with kisses, but she could only stand in the middle of her room, helpless and awkward, held in a terrible bondage of shyness.  Nancy drew back a step, chilled in spite of herself.  “I see there are matches on the chimney-piece,” she said, “so you can light the fire yourself whenever you like. The gong that will sound in a minute will be for dinner, and Miss Heath always likes us to be punctual for that meal. It does not matter about any other. Do you think you can find your way to the dining-hall or shall I come and fetch you?”  “No— thank you. I— I can manage.”  “But I’ll come with pleasure if you like me to.”  “No, I’d rather you didn’t trouble, please.”  “Very well; if you’re sure you know the way. You go down the broad stairs, then turn to the right, then to the left. Good-by. I must rush off, or I shall be late.”  Nancy shut the door behind her. She did it gently, although she did not feel gentle, for she had a distinct sensation of being irritated.  Meanwhile Priscilla, clasping her hands together behind the closed door, looked yearningly in the direction where the bright face and trim, neat girlish figure had stood. She was trembling slightly and her eyes slowly filled with tears.  “I feel sick and lonely and horrid,” she said under her breath. “Talk of nerves; oh, if Aunt Raby could see me now! Why, I’m positively shaking, I can scarcely speak, I can scarcely think properly. What would the children say if they saw their Prissie now? And I’m the girl who is to fight the world, and kill the dragon, and make a home for the nestlings. Don’t I feel like it! Don’t I look like it! Don’t I just loathe myself! How hideously I do my hair, and what a frightful dress I have on. Oh, I wish I weren’t shaking so much. I know I shall get red all over at dinner. I wish I weren’t going to dinner. I wish, oh, I"]]]
