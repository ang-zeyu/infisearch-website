All that I can even guess at is that Adastral House has something up its sleeve. And we'll not find out until they're darn good and ready to tell us.\"  \"It's always like that,\" Dave grumbled. \"Gee, sitting here is driving me bats. For two cents I'd go out and take a walk, and the heck with the bombs. But I....\"  Dave cut himself off short as he suddenly became conscious of the waiter standing at his elbow. He looked up.  \"Yes?\" he grunted.  \"Beg pardon, sir,\" the waiter said, \"but would you two gentlemen be Flying Officers Dawson and Farmer?\"  \"Right,\" Dave said with a nod. \"I'm Dawson.\"  The waiter held out a folded slip of paper.  \"A phone call just received, sir,\" he said. \"The party at the other end said that either of you two gentlemen was to call this number at once. It took a moment or two to find you. The manager thought you might be in your rooms. He tried there first.\"  As the waiter spoke the last he gave the pair a look that seemed to say that men in uniform shouldn't scurry down to the basement just on account of a mere bomb raid.  \"We would be, but we're hungry,\" Freddy Farmer said quietly.  \"Yes, of course, sir,\" the waiter said as his face got beet red. Then he hastily shoved the paper into Dave Dawson's hand and hurried away.  Dave unfolded the paper and looked at the phone number. It was a London exchange but the number was completely unfamiliar. He handed the paper to Freddy.  \"Any of your girl friends know you're here?\" he asked.  Freddy glanced at the number, himself, and shook his head.  \"Clear as mud to me,\" he said. \"I haven't the faintest idea. But we'd better call it before a Jerry bomb flattens the telephone company. There's a booth over there. You want to call it?\"  \"And maybe get one of your girls?\" Dave chuckled and shook his head. \"And you tell her it was your valet? Nix, pal. You go call her. I'll stand outside and make faces. Boy! Love in an air raid. Now ain't that something!\"  Freddy blushed slightly but made no return comment. They got up and crossed the dining room to the phone booth built into the wall. The young Englishman stepped inside, closed the door, and put through the call. Dave watching him say his eyes pop, and his jaw drop, and the light of eager excitement leap into his eyes. In less than a minute Freddy was out of the booth and as breathless as though he had just run a couple of miles at top speed.  \"Guess what?\" he gasped.  \"You just tell me instead,\" Dave said. \"What's up? An armistice been signed?\"  \"That was an Air Ministry number, Dave!\" Freddy breathed. \"As soon as the All-Clear sounds you and I are to report to Room Five Hundred, Fifth Floor, Air Ministry!\"  \"No kidding?\" Dave echoed as the familiar tingling sensation came to the back of his neck. An eerie tingling that had always proved in the past to be an advance warning of action and danger just ahead. \"Who has Room Five Hundred?\"  \"The chap who talked to me on the phone just now,\" Freddy said. \"None other than Air Marshal Manners!\"  \"Manners?\" Dave gasped. \"The man who led the R.A.F. at Dunkirk? Hey, wait a minute! Before we went out for service with the Fleet Air Arm in the Middle East I heard some kind of a rumor that he was going to be put in charge of something very big, and very hush-hush. Boy, oh boy! Do you think, Freddy?\"  \"I'm not thinking,\" Freddy said and fished in his pocket for money to pay for his meal. \"I'm heading for Adastral House right now.\"  \"You mean you're following me!\" Dave cried and bolted from the dining room.     CHAPTER TWO  _Daredevil Wings_   As Dave Dawson and Freddy Farmer stepped through the door of Room Five Hundred on the Fifth Floor of the Air Ministry their first impression was that they were stepping into a concert hall, and that the place was almost filled up. The room was huge, tremendous in size, and at least thirty or forty men in R.A.F. uniform were seated in chairs. At the far end Air Marshal Manners, the R.A.F. hero of Dunkirk, sat at a table on a small raised platform.  \"Name, rank, and papers, please!\"  Dave stopped short and jerked his head around to stare into the inquiring eyes of a Staff Sergeant. The non-com held a sheet of paper in one hand, and a pencil in the other.  \"Must make sure you're supposed to be here, you know,\" he said as Dave continued to stare.  \"Oh sure, sorry,\" Dave grinned, snapping out of his trance. \"Flying Officer Dawson, Former Flight Squadron Two-ten. Here's my pass and papers.\"  The Staff Sergeant checked the papers with what was on the sheet he held in his hand. Then he gave Dave a searching look and nodded.  \"Check, sir,\" he said. \"Take any seat.\"  Dave put his papers back in his pocket, and waited for Freddy to pass examination. Then they walked farther into the room and found a couple of vacant chairs. For some ten or fifteen minutes they just sat there looking around and wondering what was up. They were not alone in wondering either. They could tell that all of the others were as much in the dark as they were. One thing struck an important and intriguing note, however. Both of them saw many faces they had seen during the last month flying off at least fifty different airdromes about England in as many different types of planes. It wasn't until then that it dawned on them that they had not been the only ones to take that unusual and mysterious advanced flying course.  And then when general curiosity was just about ready to burst wide open like an exploding bomb, Air Marshal Manners stood up, rapped on the table and grinned down into the sea of faces.  \"All right, chaps,\" he said. \"I guess we can get on with it. Relax, all of you. Smoke if you wish. I know this must look like some blasted school room, but it isn't. I decided this was the best place to get you all together, so that was that.\"  The Air Marshal paused, cleared his throat, and took a perch on a corner of the table. Then for a moment or two he let his wide set steel blue eyes roam from face to face. As Dave locked looks with the famous ace he had the sudden impression that Manners was looking straight into his brain and reading all that was there.  \"In case you don't know,\" the Air Marshal spoke again, \"I hate blasted speech making. So don't expect anything polished from me. And if what I say doesn't make sense, don't hesitate to interrupt me with questions. First, though, I've got to ask you a question. And, lads, don't try to be heroes. Everybody is a hero in this confounded mess. It doesn't mean a thing. Find the answer to what I ask deep down inside of you. Be honest with yourself, and with me. Now, here's the question. Is there any one here who would rather return to his squadron for regular service in place of accepting assignments that may call for service and performance far beyond the ordinary call of duty? Think it over, chaps, and if you would prefer to return to your squadron and your pals it will be perfectly all right. It will mean nothing to me one way or the other. And I will give you my word on that.\"  The Air Marshal stopped talking and a pin dropping silence settled over the room. If anybody actually debated whether to return to his squadron, or remain, nobody else realized it. Every pair of eyes was fixed steadfastly on Air Marshal Manners' face. And every pair of lips remained still for two long minutes. It was the Air Ministry high ranker who finally broke the silence. He grinned and made a little gesture with one hand.  \"Knew perfectly well it would be a waste of breath to ask it,\" he said. \"Okay, right you are, then. We're all in it together, come what may. Now, you don't have to tell me you've been close to blowing your top with curiosity these last few weeks. I can see it in your faces right now. Well, I'll put an end to the mystery. A few weeks ago I was put in charge of what is to be known as the Emergency Command. In simple language the Emergency Command is to be made up of proven pilots who can fly anything, at any time, and at any place. That's why you chaps have been buzzing from drome to drome these last few weeks. I made a list of a hundred pilots I'd like to have in my Command. Those pilots were sent through the special training courses. And you thirty-five lads qualified for service in the Emergency Command. And by the way, congratulations to each and every one of you. You all proved you have the kind of stuff I'm going to need.\"  The Air Marshal paused for breath and to grin at the sea of eager faces before him. The pilots grinned back, and in the breast of each was the tingling warmth that comes with the knowledge of having accomplished something above the ordinary.  \"And now to get down to serious business,\" the famous ace of Dunkirk said in a grave tone. \"The jobs you'll get will be tough ones. All of them. I fancy that no two jobs will be the same. You'll be flying one type of ship one day, and another type the next. Maybe one day you'll go on a special Berlin bomb raid. And perhaps when you return ... if you do ... you'll be assigned the task of ferrying War Office officials to Canada, or goodness knows where. In case you're wondering just why such a Command should be formed, just give a thought or two to the name. That's the whole explanation. An Emergency Command. Pilots ready to do any kind of a job at a moment's notice. A suicide command, if you like. The point is, though, you will not act as a unit. You'll be assigned to a number of established squadrons, but your job there will be special, and you will follow my orders as given you through the O.C. of the squadron to which you happen to be assigned at the time. All clear up to now?\"  Air Marshal Manners paused again and ran his eyes over the group. Heads nodded and the murmur of assent passed from lip to lip. He grinned and heaved a sigh of mock relief.  \"Well, so much for that, then,\" he said. \"Now, something else. The Emergency Command is to be something that is very hush-hush, and for very good reason, I think. Because of your work you "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50960"],["title","Dave Dawson on Convoy Patrol (#2)"],["body","soon learn many, many important secrets about R.A.F. operation. Adolf's little Intelligence and Gestapo boys would love to find out some of those things themselves. So to check any attempt on their part to find out, the identity of you chaps is going to remain a secret. By that, I mean that on the records you will join a squadron as a replacement, and only the O.C. of that squadron will know that you are there for a certain purpose. And when you leave it will go in the records as a routine transfer or some other suitable explanation. So naturally you lads have got to live up to it all the time. Act the part of a replacement, and don't say a thing to anybody.  \"And now, thank heavens, I come to the last part of this speech making. Here on this table are thirty-five sealed envelopes. In each envelop is the number of an R.A.F. squadron, the name of its O.C., and its present location. As all of you have qualified for any kind of a job there is no sense in my designating a certain job for a certain chap. In short, you'll pick your first assignment blind. Some assignments are solo, meaning that you'll go alone. And some will be for two of three of you chaps. It all depends. So step up here and each of you take an envelop. However, don't open it at once. I've got a few more words to say first. Right-o. Step up, all of you.\"  The Air Marshal finished the sentence with a gesture of his hand-toward the table. There was a shuffling of feet as the pilots stood up and walked towards the table on the raised platform. Dave turned his head to look at Freddy, and in his pal's eyes he read the same thought that was in his own brain. Was this night to see them split up? To see them sent to opposite ends of the British Isles? Perhaps to opposite ends of the earth? It was a thought that cut deep, and though each forced a cheery grin to his lips there was the beginning of a dull ache of dread and fear in his heart.  \"I've got my fingers crossed, if you know what I mean,\" Dave whispered out the corner of his mouth.  \"I've had mine crossed since we came in,\" Freddy replied. \"Had a feeling that something like this might pop up. Luck, Dave, old boy!\"  \"Luck to us both!\" Dave breathed fervently and took his place in the line that was forming.  Some ten minutes later each pilot held a sealed envelop in his hands, and he held it as gingerly as though it were a delayed action bomb that might go off any second. Air Marshal Manners crushed out the cigarette he was smoking and faced them again.  \"More rubbish talk, chaps,\" he said, \"but I owe it to you and to myself to give you all a fair chance. Don't take what I say lightly. This is serious business. Mighty serious. Maybe half of you will be dead by this time tomorrow night. There is no telling. When you open your envelopes you'll jolly well be thumbing your nose at death. The odds will be all against you. That's why I had to pick the best I could find. Pilots with all around ability, courage, and fighting spirit. The Emergency Command, and just that. Pilots who have the choice of two things. Doing the well nigh impossible, or getting a wooden cross. And so, if any of you want to change your minds now, go ahead. It will still be perfectly all right with me.\"  As Air Marshal Manners spoke the last he looked at each man in turn, and his eyes repeated sincerely what his lips had just said. Nobody made a single move. Not a pilot so much as licked his lips as though to say something. Thirty-five steel clawed birdmen of the R.A.F. stared him right back in the eye, and waited.  \"God bless you all,\" the famous ace said softly. \"Right-o. Open your sealed assignments. Orders as to what you are to do will be awaiting you at the Squadron you join.\"  Almost before the Air Marshal had finished the room was filled with the crackling sound of sealed envelopes being ripped open. However, neither Freddy nor Dave opened theirs at once. Invisible hands seemed to stay them, and they looked once more at each other. For some crazy reason Dave's throat choked up, and for a moment Freddy's face became a sort of a blur. It was clear again in his vision almost instantly, however. He grinned and shrugged.  \"Well, it's got to be done, and so here goes,\" he said.  With that he ripped open his envelop, and drew out the card inside. The few words were printed by typewriter, and read:         Squadron No. 74,        Coastal Command,     Squadron Leader Hays,       Plymouth, England.  Dave stared at the printed words, and was almost afraid to raise his eyes and look at Freddy. He heard the ripping sound that the English youth made. And then there was a moment of silence as Freddy read of his own assignment. Then suddenly both acted as though by silent and mutual agreement. They stepped close and placed their cards side by side. The whole world seemed to stand still as they stared at each other's cards. A moment later unconfined joy filled their hearts, for the printing on the cards was identical.  \"Boy, do I feel ninety years younger!\" Dave finally breathed.  \"That's putting it mildly,\" Freddy echoed in a voice choked with emotion. \"Phew! I feel like I had just died a thousand times, and come to life again. Wonder if any other chaps are going to Coastal Command?\"  A few minutes later they found that they were the only two assigned to the Coastal Command Squadron stationed at Plymouth. And just before they left to head for their new station Air Marshal Manners drew them to one side.  \"You're either lucky, or mighty _un_lucky, lads,\" he said. \"I wondered what two would get that assignment. The toughest of the lot, in my opinion. Means everything to England. Everything. But that's all I've got to say, now. Good luck, you two. And happy landings!\"  The famous ace of Dunkirk gripped them both hard by the hand, then abruptly turned on his heel and walked away. Dave and Freddy looked at each other, but neither spoke. There was no need to speak. Each knew what the other was thinking, for he was thinking the same thing. High adventure and furious action awaited them just ahead. And perhaps death, too. But what they did about it would mean everything to England. Air Marshal Manners had said so. And knowing the man and his reputation for abrupt frankness they realized that he had not purposely painted the picture black. He had told them straight from the shoulder, and he had meant every word he said. England was counting on them, and there could be no such thing as failure. Not even in death.  \"Well, what are we waiting for?\" Dave finally grunted. \"Let's go!\"     CHAPTER THREE  _Satan's Agent_   All Nazi bombing aircraft had gone scurrying back across the Channel to their funk holes in Occupied France, and a new dawn was sliding up out of the east as the train bearing Dave and Freddy raced along the track toward the great British naval base at Plymouth on the south coast. By a bit of luck they had managed to get an apartment to themselves. And as soon as the train had pulled out of the London station they had stretched out on the seats with the idea of getting in as much sleep as possible before tearing into the mysterious task that lay ahead of them.  Their intentions and their efforts were fine, but that's about as far as things went. Sleep completely ignored and abandoned them. There was too much in their brains, and in their hearts to permit sleep a single chance to take charge. And so after an hour they both gave it up, sat up, and switched on the dome light in the car ceiling.  \"Boy, that did me a world of good!\" Dave breathed and rubbed knuckles in his eyes. \"Feel like a new man, and rarin' to go.\"  \"Liar, you didn't sleep a wink,\" Freddy said scornfully.  \"Yeah?\" Dave shot at him. \"Who says so?\"  \"I do!\" Freddy shot back. \"I was awake every second of the time, and I didn't hear a thing.\"  \"Hear a thing?\" Dave questioned without thinking. \"What do you mean?\"  \"You,\" Freddy said. \"When you sleep you snore loud enough to shatter windows. And there was hardly a murmur out of you.\"  \"Ouch!\" Dave yelped. \"Strike three on me! I sure walked right into that one. Okay, I was kidding. I didn't get in a wink, either. Boy, if you must know, this suspense is wearing me down.\"  \"Practically exhausted, I am,\" Freddy murmured. \"Coastal Command, eh? I guess that means those Yank built Consolidated \"Catalina\" flyingboats.\"  \"Or maybe those big four engined British Short \"Sunderland\" flying boats,\" Dave added in a speculative manner. \"Well, either one suits me. Both are tip-top crates. But that means patrolling over coastal waters hunting for submarines. Heck, unless the bus falls apart and you drop into the drink I can't see much danger in that kind of work.\"  \"Neither can I,\" Freddy said. Then thoughtfully rubbing the palms of his hands together, \"Somehow, though, I have the hunch that it's going to be a bit more than tootling a flyingboat around from here to there and back again. The way Manners said happy landings to us makes.... Well, the way he said it made me sort of feel my stomach was suddenly filled with cracked ice. You know, sort of cold and shivery?\"  \"Right on the nose!\" Dave said and nodded vigorously. \"And there was a look in his eye, too. Gave me the feeling he knew darn well he'd never see us again.\"  \"What a pleasant thought!\" Freddy groaned. \"I say, let's talk about something else. Any more of this and I swear I'll leap off the train and walk back.\"  \"That will be the day, when Freddy Farmer back-tracks on anything!\" Dave said with a chuckle. \"But maybe it's best to talk of other things. After all, in this game talking about the unknown doesn't help at all. Like other jobs we've had, we've just simply got to take this one in stride as it comes along. And let it go like that.\"  \"Oh quite,\" Freddy murmured. Then wistfully, \"But I'd still jolly well like to know what we're going up against.\"  \"You'll find out, and soon!\" Dave said. \"Right now, skip it. Tell me. What do you think of the Dodgers' chances to cop the flag this "]]]
