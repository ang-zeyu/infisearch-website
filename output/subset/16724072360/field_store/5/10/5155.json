But you should have come to me.\" He reaches out and taps a pedestrian lightly on the shoulder. \"Sir, an emergency request. Would you help this gentleman?\"  The pedestrian grins, looks at his watch, and nods. \"How far?\"  You did notice the name of the building from which you came and you mutter it. The stranger nods again, reaches out and picks up the other side of the generator, blowing a little whistle the cop hands him. Pedestrians begin to move aside, and you and the stranger jog down the street at a trot, with a nice clear path, while the cop stands beaming at you both.  That way, it isn't so bad. And you begin to see why I decided I might like to stay in the future. But all the same, the organized cooperation here doesn't look too good. The guard can get the same and be there before you.  And he is. He stands just inside the door of the building as you reach it. The stranger lifts an eyebrow and goes off at once when you nod at him, not waiting for thanks. And the guard comes up, holding some dinkus in his hand, about the size of a big folding camera and not too dissimilar in other ways. He snaps it open and you get set to duck.  \"You forgot the prints, monograph, and patent applications,\" he says. \"They go with the generator--we don't like to have them separated. A good thing I knew the production office of 'Atoms and Axioms' was in this building. Just let us know when you're finished with the model and we'll pick it up.\"  You swallow several sets of tonsils you had removed years before, and take the bundle of papers he hands you out of the little case. He pumps you for some more information, which you give him at random. It seems to satisfy your amiable guard friend. He finally smiles in satisfaction and heads back to the museum.  You still don't believe it, but you pick up the atomic generator and the information sheets, and you head down toward the service elevator. There is no button on it. In fact, there's no door there.  You start looking for other doors or corridors, but you know this is right. The signs along the halls are the same as they were.         *       *       *       *       *  Then there's a sort of cough and something dilates in the wall. It forms a perfect door and the elevator stands there waiting. You get in, gulping out something about going all the way down, and then wonder how a machine geared for voice operation can make anything of that. What the deuce would that lowest basement be called? But the elevator has closed and is moving downward in a hurry. It coughs again and you're at the original level. You get out--and realize you don't have a light.  You'll never know what you stumbled over, but, somehow, you move back in the direction of the time machine, bumping against boxes, staggering here and there, and trying to find the right place by sheer feel. Then a shred of dim light appears; it's the weak light in the time machine.  You've located it.  You put the atomic generator in the luggage space, throw the papers down beside it, and climb into the cockpit, sweating and mumbling. You reach forward toward the green button and hesitate. There's a red one beside it and you finally decide on that.  Suddenly, there's a confused yell from the direction of the elevator and a beam of light strikes against your eyes, with a shout punctuating it. Your finger touches the red button.  You'll never know what the shouting was about--whether they finally doped out the fact that they'd been robbed, or whether they were trying to help you. You don't care which it is. The field springs up around you and the next button you touch--the one on the board that hasn't been used so far--sends you off into nothingness. There is no beam of light, you can't hear a thing, and you're safe.  It isn't much of a trip back. You sit there smoking and letting your nerves settle back to normal. You notice a third set of buttons, with some pencil marks over them--\"Press these to return to yourself 30 years\"--and you begin waiting for the air to get stale. It doesn't because there is only one of you this time.  Instead, everything flashes off and you're sitting in the machine in your own back yard.  You'll figure out the cycle in more details later. You get into the machine in front of your house, go to the future in the sub-basement, land in your back yard, and then hop back thirty years to pick up yourself, landing in front of your house. Just that. But right then, you don't care. You jump out and start pulling out that atomic generator and taking it inside.         *       *       *       *       *  It isn't hard to disassemble, but you don't learn a thing; just some plates of metal, some spiral coils, and a few odds and ends--all things that can be made easily enough, all obviously of common metals. But when you put it together again, about an hour later, you notice something.  Everything in it is brand-new and there's one set of copper wires missing! It won't work. You put some #12 house wire in, exactly like the set on the other side, drop in some iron filings, and try it again.  And with the controls set at 120 volts, 60 cycles and 15 amperes, you get just that. You don't need the power company any more. And you feel a little happier when you realize that the luggage space wasn't insulated from time effects by a field, so the motor has moved backward in time, somehow, and is back to its original youth--minus the replaced wires the guard mentioned--which probably wore out because of the makeshift job you've just done.  But you begin getting more of a jolt when you find that the papers are all in your own writing, that your name is down as the inventor, and that the date of the patent application is 1951.  It will begin to soak in, then. You pick up an atomic generator in the future and bring it back to the past--your present--so that it can be put in the museum with you as the inventor so you can steal it to be the inventor. And you do it in a time machine which you bring back to yourself to take yourself into the future to return to take back to yourself....  Who invented what? And who built which?  Before long, your riches from the generator are piling in. Little kids from school are coming around to stare at the man who changed history and made atomic power so common that no nation could hope to be anything but a democracy and a peaceful one--after some of the worst times in history for a few years. Your name eventually becomes as common as Ampere, or Faraday, or any other spelled without a capital letter.  But you're thinking of the puzzle. You can't find any answer.  One day you come across an old poem--something about some folks calling it evolution and others calling it God. You go out, make a few provisions for the future, and come back to climb into the time machine that's waiting in the building you had put around it. Then you'll be knocking on your own door, thirty years back--or right now, from your view--and telling your younger self all these things I'm telling you.  But now....  Well, the drinks are finished. You're woozy enough to go along with me without protest, and I want to find out just why those people up there came looking for you and shouting, before the time machine left.  Let's go."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51075"],["title","A Stone and a Spear (#1)"],["body","invitation--and Curt's acceptance.  When she was gone, there was a moment's silence. The logs crackled with shocking pistol shots in the fireplace. The scientist moved to stir the coals and then turned abruptly to Curt.  \"When are you going to leave Detrick?\"  \"When are _you_ coming back?\" Curt demanded instead of answering.  \"So they still want me, even after the things I said when I left.\"  \"You're needed badly. When I told Hansen I was coming down, he said it would be worth five years of my own work to bring you back.\"  \"They want me to produce even deadlier toxins than those I gave them,\" Dell said viciously. \"They want some that can kill ten million people in four minutes instead of only one million--\"  \"Any man would go insane if he looked at it that way. It would be the same as gun-makers being tormented by the vision of torn men destroyed by their bullets, the sorrowing families--\"  \"And why shouldn't the gun-makers be tormented?\" Dell's voice was low with controlled hate. \"They are men like you and me who give the _war_-makers new tools for their trade.\"  \"Oh, Dell, it's not as simple as that.\" Curt raised a hand and let it fall wearily. They had been over this so many times before. \"Weapon designers are no more responsible than any other agents of society. It's pure neurosis to absorb the whole guilt of wars yet unfought merely because you happened to have developed a potential weapon.\"  Dell touched the massive dome of his skull. \"Here within this brain of mine has been conceived a thing which will probably destroy a billion human lives in the coming years. D. triconus toxin in a suitable aerosol requires only a countable number of molecules in the lungs of a man to kill him. My brain and mine alone is responsible for that vicious, murderous discovery.\"  \"Egotism! Any scientist's work is built upon the pyramid of past knowledge.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"The weapon I have described exists. If I had not created it, it would not exist. It is as simple as that. No one shares my guilt and my responsibility. And what more do they want of me now? What greater dream of mass slaughter and destruction have they dreamed?\"  \"They want you,\" said Curt quietly, \"because they believe we are not the only ones possessing the toxin. They need you to come back and help find the antitoxin for D. triconus.\"  Dell shook his head. \"That's a blind hope. The action of D. triconus is like a match set to a powder train. The instant its molecules contact protoplasm, they start a chain reaction that rips apart the cell structure. It spreads like fire from one cell to the next, and nothing can stop it once it's started operating within a given organism.\"  \"But doesn't this sense of guilt--unwarranted as it is--make you _want_ to find an antitoxin?\"  \"Suppose I succeeded? I would have canceled the weapon of an enemy. The military would know he could nullify ours in time. Then they would command me to work out still another toxin. It's a vicious and insane circle, which must be broken somewhere. The purpose of the entire remainder of my life is to break it.\"  \"When you are fighting for your life and the enemy already has his hands about your throat,\" Curt argued, \"you reach for the biggest rock you can get your hands on and beat his brains in. You don't try to persuade him that killing is unethical.\"  For an instant it seemed to Curt that a flicker of humor touched the corners of Dell's mouth. Then the lines tightened down again.  \"Exactly,\" he said. \"You reach for a rock and beat his brains in. You don't wipe human life off the face of the Earth in order to reach that enemy. I asked you to come down here to help me break this circle of which I spoke. There has to be someone here--after I'm gone--\"  Dell's eyes shifted to the depths of shadows beyond the firelight and remained fixed on unseen images.  \"Me? Help you?\" Curt asked incredulously. \"What could I do? Give up science and become a truck gardener, too?\"  \"You might say that we would be in the rock business,\" replied Dell. \"Fighting is no longer on the level of one man with his hands about another's throat, but it _should_ be. Those who want power and domination should have to fight for it personally. But it has been a long time since they had to.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Even in the old days, kings and emperors hired mercenaries to fight their wars. The militarists don't buy swords now. They buy brains. We're the mercenaries of the new day, Curt, you and I. Once there was honor in our profession. We searched for truth for its own sake, and because it was our way of life. Once we were the hope of the world because science was a universal language.  \"What a horrible joke that turned out to be! Today we are the terror of the world. The war-makers built us fine laboratories, shining palaces, and granted every whim--for a price. They took us up to the hills and showed us the whole world and we sold our souls for it.  \"Look what happened after the last war. Invading armies carried off prize Nazi brains like so much loot, set the scientists up in big new laboratories, and these new mercenaries keep right on pouring out knowledge for other kings and emperors.  \"Their loyalty is only to their science. But they can't experiment for knowledge any more, only weapons and counter-weapons. You'll say I'm anti-war, even, perhaps, anti-American or pro-Russian. I am not against just wars, but I am against unjust slaughter. And I love America too much to let her destroy herself along with the enemy.\"  \"Then what are we to do?\" Curt demanded fiercely. \"What are we to do while enemy scientists prepare these same weapons to exterminate _us_? Sure, it's one hell of a mess. Science is already dead. The kind you talk about has been dead for twenty years. All our fine ideals are worthless until the politicians find a solution to their quarrels.\"  \"Politicians? Since when did men of science have to wait upon politicians for solutions of human problems?\" Dell passed a hand over his brow, and suddenly his face contorted in pain.  \"What is it?\" Curt exclaimed, rising.  \"Nothing--nothing, my boy. Some minor trouble I've had lately. It will pass in a moment.\"  With effort, he went on. \"I wanted to say that already you have come to think of science being divided into armed camps by the artificial boundaries of the politicians. Has it been so long ago that it was not even in your lifetime, when scientists regarded themselves as one international brotherhood?\"  \"I can't quarrel with your ideals,\" said Curt softly. \"But national boundary lines do, actually, divide the scientists of the world into armed camps.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"Your premises are still incorrect. They do not deliberately war on each other. It is only that they have blindly sold themselves as mercenaries. And they can be called upon to redeem themselves. They can break their unholy contracts.\"  \"There would have to be simultaneous agreement among the scientists of all nations. And they are men, influenced by national ideals. They are not merely ivory-tower dabblers and searchers after truth.\"  \"Do you remember me five years ago?\" Dell's face became more haggard, as if the memory shamed him. \"Do you remember when I told the atomic scientists to examine their guts instead of their consciences?\"  \"Yes. You certainly _have_ changed.\"  \"And so can other men. There is a way. I need your help desperately, Curt--\"  The face of the aging biochemist contorted again with unbearable pain. His forehead beaded with sweat as he clenched his skull between his vein-knotted hands.  \"Dell! What is it?\"  \"It will pass,\" Dr. Dell breathed through clenched teeth. \"I have some medicine--in my bedroom. I'm afraid I'll have to excuse myself tonight. There's so much more I have to say to you, but we'll continue our talk in the morning, Curt. I'm sorry--\"  He stumbled out, refusing Curt's offer of aid with a grim headshake. The fire crackled loudly within the otherwise silent room. Curt felt cold at the descending chill of the night, his mind bewildered at Dell's barrage, some of it so reasonable, some of it so utterly confused. And there was no clue to the identity of the powerful force that had made so great a change in the once militant scientist.  Slowly Curt mounted the staircase of the old house and went to the room Dell had assigned them. Louise was in bed reading a murder mystery.  \"Secret mission completed?\" she asked.  Curt sat down on the edge of the bed. \"I'm afraid something terrible is wrong with Dell. Besides the neurotic guilt complex because of his war work, he showed signs of a terrific and apparently habitual pain in his head. If that should be brain tumor, it might explain his erratic notions, his abandonment of his career.\"  \"Oh, I hope it's not that!\"         *       *       *       *       *  It seemed to Curt that he had slept only minutes before he was roused by sounds in the night. He rolled over and switched on the light. His watch said two o'clock. Louise raised up in sharp alarm.  \"What is it?\" she whispered.  \"I thought I heard something. There it is again!\"  \"It sounds like someone in pain. It must be Dell!\"  Curt leaped from the bed and wrestled into his bathrobe. As he hurried toward Dell's room, there was another deep groan that ended in a shuddering sob of unbearable agony.  He burst into the scientist's room and switched on the light. Dell looked up, eyes glazed with pain.  \"Dr. Dell!\"  \"Curt--I thought I had time left, but this is as far as I can go--Just remember all I said tonight. Don't forget a word of it.\" He sat up rigidly, hardly breathing in the effort of control. \"The responsibility for the coming destruction of civilization lies at the doors of the scientist mercenaries. Don't allow it, Curt. Get them to abandon the laboratories of the warriors. Get them to reclaim their honor--\"  He fell back upon the pillow, his face white with pain and shining with sweat."]]]
