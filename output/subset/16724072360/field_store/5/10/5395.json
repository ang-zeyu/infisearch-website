Their private tutor left them—being a Northern man he could not stand the climate—and then they were as uneasy as fish out of their native element. They galloped their ponies about the country in search of adventure, paddled around the lake in their canoe, roamed listlessly through the woods with their guns in their hands; in short, to quote from Don, “they became as shiftless and of as little use in the world as ever Godfrey Evans had been.”  “I don’t at all like this thing,” the general one day said to his wife, “and there must be a stop put to it. The boys will grow up as ignorant as the negroes. I shall pack them both off to school.”  Mrs. Gordon thought of the way in which Don had conducted himself at the last school he attended (he had been expelled from it on account of the “scrapes” that his inordinate love of mischief brought him into), and made no reply.  “I have not forgotten that unfortunate occurrence,” said the general, who well knew what was passing in his wife’s mind. “But I think it was a lesson to Don, and one that will never fade from his memory. Being blessed with wonderful health and strength, he is fairly overflowing with animal spirits, and some of his surplus energy must be worked off in some way. I’ll put him where he will be held with his nose close to the grindstone. I’ll send him to Bridgeport.”  “Do you think he can endure the discipline?” asked the anxious mother, who knew how easily Don could be governed by kindness, and how obstinate he was under harsh treatment.  “He’ll have to; it is just what he needs. After he has spent six hours in racking his brain over the hardest kind of problems in mathematics, and two hours and a half more in handling muskets and broadswords under the eye of a strict drillmaster, he will feel more like going to bed than he will like running the guard to eat Cony Ryan’s pancakes and drink his sour buttermilk. I know, for I have been right there.”  When General Gordon once made up his mind to a course of action he lost no time in carrying it into effect. Before the week was passed he and his two boys were on their way to Bridgeport, where they arrived in time to learn something of the life the students led while they were in camp. The veteran superintendent welcomed the general as an old friend and pupil, received him and his boys into his marquee, and took pains to see that the latter made some agreeable acquaintances among the members of the first class, who showed them every thing there was to be seen. Bert did not have much to say, but Don was all enthusiasm.  “That’s the school for me,” said he to his father when they were on their way to Rochdale, after Don and Bert had passed their examination and been admitted as members of the academy. “How nicely those fellows were drilled, and what good-natured gentlemen all the instructors are! We shall have easy times during the first year. It will seem like play for me to go back to the beginning of algebra again.”  The general smiled, but said nothing until they reached home and the boys began to get ready to go back to the academy at the beginning of the school year. Then he tried to make them understand that “easy times” were entirely unknown in Bridgeport; that the instructors, although they were “good-natured” enough to the guests they met while in camp, were the sternest and most inflexible of disciplinarians in the barracks; and that there was as wide a gulf between them and the students as there was between the officers and privates in the army. Somehow Don could not bring himself to believe it, but before many months more had passed over his head he found out that his father knew what he was talking about. He made his mother the most solemn promises in regard to his behavior, assuring her that he had been in “scrapes” enough, and that henceforth he would give her and his teachers no trouble; and when he made those promises he was fully resolved to live up to them. He was then entirely unacquainted with the temptations that fell to the lot of a Bridgeport student. Cony Ryan’s pancakes and surreptitious sleigh-rides had no charms for him, neither had the guard-house and extra duty any terrors, because he did not know that there were any such things. But they were soon brought to his notice, and perhaps we shall see how he kept his promises after that.  The night of the 15th of January found Don and Bert installed in their room in the academy. It was large enough to accommodate two single beds, a steam-heater, a washstand, a table, and two chairs. At the foot of each bed was a small cupboard, in which they were to keep their uniforms, after they got them, and also their officers’ swords, if they were fortunate enough to win them at the next examination. Bert was poring over his French lesson, while Don, who was more than a year ahead of his class in all his studies, was reading the “Rules and Regulations” that hung upon the wall. There were fifty rooms on that floor, all occupied by boys who were supposed to be studying their lessons for the morrow. The only sound that broke the stillness was a steady tramping in the hall.  “I wish that fellow, whoever he is, would go into his room and keep still,” said Bert, after he had waited a long time for the tramping to cease.  “He’ll not go away until he is relieved,” replied Don. “He is a sentry. I have just been reading about him. He has charge of all the rooms on this floor, and it is his duty to suppress all loud talking or laughing, and to inspect the rooms occasionally to see that the occupants have not slipped out.”  “Where would they go if they did slip out?” asked Bert.  “I am sure I don’t know,” replied Don, as he walked up to the heater and held his hands over it. “Neither do I see why one should want to leave a comfortable room like this to parade around in the deep snow, even if there _were_ a place to go to pass the evening. It’s fearful cold up here in this country, isn’t it?”  When Don and Bert left their Southern home the air was balmy, the birds were singing, a few early flowers were beginning to bud under the genial influence of the sun, and they earned their overcoats done up in shawl-straps; but long before they reached their journey’s end they had put on all their heaviest clothing, and when the train brought them into Bridgeport they found the streets blocked with snow, and the river covered with a sheet of ice that was fourteen inches in thickness. The dreary winter scene that met their gaze every time they looked out of the academy windows made them shiver involuntarily, and it was no wonder that they wanted to hug the fire.  “Suppose that sentry should find a room empty when he looked into it?” said Bert, without replying to his brother’s question. “What then?”  “It would be his duty to report the owners,” said Don.  “That looks almost too much like tale-bearing,” answered Bert. “I don’t like the idea; do you?”  “No, I don’t; but what is a fellow to do about it? If it ever comes our turn to stand sentry during study hours, we can take our choice between doing our full duty, without fear or favor, and being reported and punished ourselves for negligence. I know what my choice will be. If the boys don’t want me to report them, they must live up to the regulations.”  When Don said this he meant every word of it; but after he had been at the academy a few weeks, Bert noticed that he never gave expression to such ideas as these. He learned how to keep his back turned toward a room when he had reason to believe that the owners desired to “take French” for the evening; and when he was certain that they were out of harm’s way, he could open the door of that very room, and without much stretching of his imagination convert the “dummies” that occupied the beds into living, breathing students. It soon became known to a certain class of boys that the Planter was a “brick,” who would rather get into trouble himself than report any of his schoolmates; and they were not slow to take advantage of his good-nature. That was the term the students applied to his neglect of duty; but the superintendent called it disobedience of orders, and Don was punished accordingly.  “What was that noise?” exclaimed Bert, suddenly.  “It sounded like a drum,” answered Don.  And that was just what it was. A couple of drummers were walking around the building, every now and then giving their instruments a single tap.  “It certainly means something,” said Bert, with no little anxiety in his tone; “but I am all in the dark.”  So was Don. He was about to propose that they should step out into the hall and ask the sentry to enlighten them, when the door suddenly opened and that dreaded functionary thrust his head into the room.  “I say, Plebe,” he exclaimed, nodding to Don, “give us your name, will you?”  Don wonderingly complied, and the sentry drew a note-book from his pocket and wrote something in it.  “Very unpleasant piece of business,” said he, “but it can’t be helped. Orders are orders, as you will find before you have been here a great while. Next time keep your ears open.”  “Why, what’s the matter?” inquired Don. “Have we done anything wrong?”  “I should say so. Why didn’t you douse your glim? Did you not hear the signal?”  “We heard a drum, if that’s what you mean,” said Bert.  “That was ‘taps,’ and it meant ‘lights out.’ Put that lamp out at once.”  “We’ll do it just as soon as we get ready for bed,” replied Bert, jumping up and pulling off his coat.  “Put it out, I tell you,” exclaimed the sentry. “Put it out _now_, and undress in the dark, as the rest of the fellows do. You had better take my advice and slumber lightly, for after the morning gun is fired you will have just six minutes in which to get into your clothes and fall in for roll-call. Pleasant dreams.”  “Humph!” said Bert, as the sentry closed the door and went out into the hall to inspect the other rooms. “How can a fellow’s dreams be pleasant when he knows that he is going to be "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5348"],["title","Ragged Dick, Or, Street Life in New York with the Boot-Blacks (#1)"],["body","Theatre, and to Tony Pastor’s, and if he had any money left afterwards, he would invite some of his friends in somewhere to have an oyster-stew; so it seldom happened that he commenced the day with a penny.  Then I am sorry to add that Dick had formed the habit of smoking. This cost him considerable, for Dick was rather fastidious about his cigars, and wouldn’t smoke the cheapest. Besides, having a liberal nature, he was generally ready to treat his companions. But of course the expense was the smallest objection. No boy of fourteen can smoke without being affected injuriously. Men are frequently injured by smoking, and boys always. But large numbers of the newsboys and boot-blacks form the habit. Exposed to the cold and wet they find that it warms them up, and the self-indulgence grows upon them. It is not uncommon to see a little boy, too young to be out of his mother’s sight, smoking with all the apparent satisfaction of a veteran smoker.  There was another way in which Dick sometimes lost money. There was a noted gambling-house on Baxter Street, which in the evening was sometimes crowded with these juvenile gamesters, who staked their hard earnings, generally losing of course, and refreshing themselves from time to time with a vile mixture of liquor at two cents a glass. Sometimes Dick strayed in here, and played with the rest.  I have mentioned Dick’s faults and defects, because I want it understood, to begin with, that I don’t consider him a model boy. But there were some good points about him nevertheless. He was above doing anything mean or dishonorable. He would not steal, or cheat, or impose upon younger boys, but was frank and straight-forward, manly and self-reliant. His nature was a noble one, and had saved him from all mean faults. I hope my young readers will like him as I do, without being blind to his faults. Perhaps, although he was only a boot-black, they may find something in him to imitate.  And now, having fairly introduced Ragged Dick to my young readers, I must refer them to the next chapter for his further adventures.     CHAPTER II. JOHNNY NOLAN   After Dick had finished polishing Mr. Greyson’s boots he was fortunate enough to secure three other customers, two of them reporters in the Tribune establishment, which occupies the corner of Spruce Street and Printing House Square.  When Dick had got through with his last customer the City Hall clock indicated eight o’clock. He had been up an hour, and hard at work, and naturally began to think of breakfast. He went up to the head of Spruce Street, and turned into Nassau. Two blocks further, and he reached Ann Street. On this street was a small, cheap restaurant, where for five cents Dick could get a cup of coffee, and for ten cents more, a plate of beefsteak with a plate of bread thrown in. These Dick ordered, and sat down at a table.  It was a small apartment with a few plain tables unprovided with cloths, for the class of customers who patronized it were not very particular. Our hero’s breakfast was soon before him. Neither the coffee nor the steak were as good as can be bought at Delmonico’s; but then it is very doubtful whether, in the present state of his wardrobe, Dick would have been received at that aristocratic restaurant, even if his means had admitted of paying the high prices there charged.  Dick had scarcely been served when he espied a boy about his own size standing at the door, looking wistfully into the restaurant. This was Johnny Nolan, a boy of fourteen, who was engaged in the same profession as Ragged Dick. His wardrobe was in very much the same condition as Dick’s.  “Had your breakfast, Johnny?” inquired Dick, cutting off a piece of steak.  “No.”  “Come in, then. Here’s room for you.”  “I aint got no money,” said Johnny, looking a little enviously at his more fortunate friend.  “Haven’t you had any shines?”  “Yes, I had one, but I shan’t get any pay till to-morrow.”  “Are you hungry?”  “Try me, and see.”  “Come in. I’ll stand treat this morning.”  Johnny Nolan was nowise slow to accept this invitation, and was soon seated beside Dick.  “What’ll you have, Johnny?”  “Same as you.”  “Cup o’ coffee and beefsteak,” ordered Dick.  These were promptly brought, and Johnny attacked them vigorously.  Now, in the boot-blacking business, as well as in higher avocations, the same rule prevails, that energy and industry are rewarded, and indolence suffers. Dick was energetic and on the alert for business, but Johnny the reverse. The consequence was that Dick earned probably three times as much as the other.  “How do you like it?” asked Dick, surveying Johnny’s attacks upon the steak with evident complacency.  “It’s hunky.”  I don’t believe “hunky” is to be found in either Webster’s or Worcester’s big dictionary; but boys will readily understand what it means.  “Do you come here often?” asked Johnny.  “Most every day. You’d better come too.”  “I can’t afford it.”  “Well, you’d ought to, then,” said Dick. “What do you do I’d like to know?”  “I don’t get near as much as you, Dick.”  “Well you might if you tried. I keep my eyes open,—that’s the way I get jobs. You’re lazy, that’s what’s the matter.”  Johnny did not see fit to reply to this charge. Probably he felt the justice of it, and preferred to proceed with the breakfast, which he enjoyed the more as it cost him nothing.  Breakfast over, Dick walked up to the desk, and settled the bill. Then, followed by Johnny, he went out into the street.  “Where are you going, Johnny?”  “Up to Mr. Taylor’s, on Spruce Street, to see if he don’t want a shine.”  “Do you work for him reg’lar?”  “Yes. Him and his partner wants a shine most every day. Where are you goin’?”  “Down front of the Astor House. I guess I’ll find some customers there.”  At this moment Johnny started, and, dodging into an entry way, hid behind the door, considerably to Dick’s surprise.  “What’s the matter now?” asked our hero.  “Has he gone?” asked Johnny, his voice betraying anxiety.  “Who gone, I’d like to know?”  “That man in the brown coat.”  “What of him. You aint scared of him, are you?”  “Yes, he got me a place once.”  “Where?”  “Ever so far off.”  “What if he did?”  “I ran away.”  “Didn’t you like it?”  “No, I had to get up too early. It was on a farm, and I had to get up at five to take care of the cows. I like New York best.”  “Didn’t they give you enough to eat?”  “Oh, yes, plenty.”  “And you had a good bed?”  “Yes.”  “Then you’d better have stayed. You don’t get either of them here. Where’d you sleep last night?”  “Up an alley in an old wagon.”  “You had a better bed than that in the country, didn’t you?”  “Yes, it was as soft as—as cotton.”  Johnny had once slept on a bale of cotton, the recollection supplying him with a comparison.  “Why didn’t you stay?”  “I felt lonely,” said Johnny.  Johnny could not exactly explain his feelings, but it is often the case that the young vagabond of the streets, though his food is uncertain, and his bed may be any old wagon or barrel that he is lucky enough to find unoccupied when night sets in, gets so attached to his precarious but independent mode of life, that he feels discontented in any other. He is accustomed to the noise and bustle and ever-varied life of the streets, and in the quiet scenes of the country misses the excitement in the midst of which he has always dwelt.  Johnny had but one tie to bind him to the city. He had a father living, but he might as well have been without one. Mr. Nolan was a confirmed drunkard, and spent the greater part of his wages for liquor. His potations made him ugly, and inflamed a temper never very sweet, working him up sometimes to such a pitch of rage that Johnny’s life was in danger. Some months before, he had thrown a flat-iron at his son’s head with such terrific force that unless Johnny had dodged he would not have lived long enough to obtain a place in our story. He fled the house, and from that time had not dared to re-enter it. Somebody had given him a brush and box of blacking, and he had set up in business on his own account. But he had not energy enough to succeed, as has already been stated, and I am afraid the poor boy had met with many hardships, and suffered more than once from cold and hunger. Dick had befriended him more than once, and often given him a breakfast or dinner, as the case might be.  “How’d you get away?” asked Dick, with some curiosity. “Did you walk?”  “No, I rode on the cars.”  “Where’d you get your money? I hope you didn’t steal it.”  “I didn’t have none.”  “What did you do, then?”  “I got up about three o’clock, and walked to Albany.”  “Where’s that?” asked Dick, whose ideas on the subject of geography were rather vague.  “Up the river.”  “How far?”  “About a thousand miles,” said Johnny, whose conceptions of distance were equally vague.  “Go ahead. What did you do then?”  “I hid on top of a freight car, and came all the way without their seeing me.* That man in the brown coat was the man that got me the place, and I’m afraid he’d want to send me back.”  * A fact.   “Well,” said Dick, reflectively, “I dunno as I’d like to live in the country. I couldn’t go to Tony Pastor’s or the Old Bowery. There wouldn’t be no place to spend my evenings. But I say, it’s tough in winter, Johnny, ’specially when your overcoat’s at the tailor’s, an’ likely to stay there.”  “That’s so, Dick. But I must be goin’, or Mr. Taylor’ll get somebody else to shine his boots.”  Johnny walked back to Nassau Street, while Dick kept on his way to Broadway.  “That boy,” soliloquized Dick, as Johnny took his departure, “aint got no ambition. I’ll bet he won’t get five shines to-day. I’m glad I aint like him. I couldn’t go to the theatre, nor buy no cigars, nor get half as much as I wanted to eat.—Shine yer boots, sir?”  Dick always had an eye to business, and this remark was addressed to a young man, dressed in a stylish manner, who was swinging a jaunty cane.  “I’ve had my boots blacked once already this morning, but this"]]]
