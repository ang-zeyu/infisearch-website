It had passed through various animal forms, and now began a new human course in the body of a paraschites, once more to stand after death in the presence of the judges of the under-world.  Pentaur had crossed the threshold of the man he despised with aversion; the man himself, sitting at the feet of the suffering girl, had exclaimed as he saw the priest approaching the hovel:  \"Yet another white robe!  Does misfortune cleanse the unclean?\"  Pentaur had not answered the old man, who on his part took no further notice of him, while he rubbed the girl's feet by order of the leech; and his hands impelled by tender anxiety untiringly continued the same movement, as the water-wheel in the Nile keeps up without intermission its steady motion in the stream.  \"Does misfortune cleanse the unclean?\"  Pentaur asked himself.  \"Does it indeed possess a purifying efficacy, and is it possible that the Gods, who gave to fire the power of refining metals and to the winds power to sweep the clouds from the sky, should desire that a man--made in their own image--that a man should be tainted from his birth to his death with an indelible stain?\"  He looked at the face of the paraschites, and it seemed to him to resemble that of his father.  This startled him!  And when he noticed how the woman, in whose lap the girl's head was resting, bent over the injured bosom of the child to catch her breathing, which she feared had come to a stand-still--with the anguish of a dove that is struck down by a hawk--he remembered a moment in his own childhood, when he had lain trembling with fever on his little bed. What then had happened to him, or had gone on around him, he had long forgotten, but one image was deeply imprinted on his soul, that of the face of his mother bending over him in deadly anguish, but who had gazed on her sick boy not more tenderly, or more anxiously, than this despised woman on her suffering child.  \"There is only one utterly unselfish, utterly pure and utterly divine love,\" said he to himself, \"and that is the love of Isis for Horus--the love of a mother for her child.  If these people were indeed so foul as to defile every thing they touch, how would this pure, this tender, holy impulse show itself even in them in all its beauty and perfection?\"  \"Still,\" he continued, \"the Celestials  have implanted maternal love in the breast of the lioness, of the typhonic river-horse of the Nile.\"  He looked compassionately at the wife of the paraschites.  He saw her dark face as she turned it away from the sick girl.  She had felt her breathe, and a smile of happiness lighted up her old features; she nodded first to the surgeon, and then with a deep sigh of relief to her husband, who, while he did not cease the movement of his left hand, held up his right hand in prayer to heaven, and his wife did the same.  It seemed to Pentaur that he could see the souls of these two, floating above the youthful creature in holy union as they joined their hands; and again he thought of his parents' house, of the hour when his sweet, only sister died.  His mother had thrown herself weeping on the pale form, but his father had stamped his foot and had thrown back his head, sobbing and striking his forehead with his fist.  \"How piously submissive and thankful are these unclean ones!\"  thought Pentaur; and repugnance for the old laws began to take root in his heart. \"Maternal love may exist in the hyaena, but to seek and find God pertains only to man, who has a noble aim.  Up to the limits of eternity--and God is eternal!--thought is denied to animals; they cannot even smile.  Even men cannot smile at first, for only physical life--an animal soul--dwells in them; but soon a share of the world's soul--beaming intelligence-- works within them, and first shows itself in the smile of a child, which is as pure as the light and the truth from which it comes.  The child of the paraschites smiles like any other creature born of woman, but how few aged men there are, even among the initiated, who can smile as innocently and brightly as this woman who has grown grey under open ill-treatment.\"  Deep sympathy began to fill his heart, and he knelt down by the side of the poor child, raised her arm, and prayed fervently to that One who had created the heavens and who rules the world--to that One, whom the mysteries of faith forbade him to name; and not to the innumerable gods, whom the people worshipped, and who to him were nothing but incarnations of the attributes of the One and only God of the initiated--of whom he was one--who was thus brought down to the comprehension of the laity.  He raised his soul to God in passionate emotion; but he prayed, not for the child before him and for her recovery, but rather for the whole despised race, and for its release from the old ban, for the enlightenment of his own soul, imprisoned in doubts, and for strength to fulfil his hard task with discretion.  The gaze of the sufferer followed him as he took up his former position.  The prayer had refreshed his soul and restored him to cheerfulness of spirit.  He began to reflect what conduct he must observe towards the princess.  He had not met Bent-Anat for the first time yesterday; on the contrary, he had frequently seen her in holiday processions, and at the high festivals in the Necropolis, and like all his young companions had admired her proud beauty--admired it as the distant light of the stars, or the evening-glow on the horizon.  Now he must approach this lady with words of reproof.  He pictured to himself the moment when he must advance to meet her, and could not help thinking of his little tutor Chufu, above whom he towered by two heads while he was still a boy, and who used to call up his admonitions to him from below.  It was true, he himself was tall and slim, but he felt as if to-day he were to play the part towards Bent-Anat of the much-laughed-at little tutor.  His sense of the comic was touched, and asserted itself at this serious moment, and with such melancholy surroundings.  Life is rich in contrasts, and a susceptible and highly-strung human soul would break down like a bridge under the measured tread of soldiers, if it were allowed to let the burden of the heaviest thoughts and strongest feelings work upon it in undisturbed monotony; but just as in music every key-note has its harmonies, so when we cause one chord of our heart to vibrate for long, all sorts of strange notes respond and clang, often those which we least expect.  Pentaur's glance flew round the one low, over-filled room of the paraschites' hut, and like a lightning flash the thought, \"How will the princess and her train find room here?\"  flew through his mind.  His fancy was lively, and vividly brought before him how the daughter of the Pharaoh with a crown on her proud head would bustle into the silent chamber, how the chattering courtiers would follow her, and how the women by the walls, the physicians by the side of the sick girl, the sleek white cat from the chest where she sat, would rise and throng round her. There must be frightful confusion.  Then he imagined how the smart lords and ladies would keep themselves far from the unclean, hold their slender hands over their mouths and noses, and suggest to the old folks how they ought to behave to the princess who condescended to bless them with her presence.  The old woman must lay down the head that rested in her bosom, the paraschites must drop the feet he so anxiously rubbed, on the floor, to rise and kiss the dust before Bent-Anat.  Whereupon--the \"mind's eye\" of the young priest seemed to see it all--the courtiers fled before him, pushing each other, and all crowded together into a corner, and at last the princess threw a few silver or gold rings into the laps of the father and mother, and perhaps to the girl too, and he seemed to hear the courtiers all cry out: \"Hail to the gracious daughter of the Sun!\"--to hear the joyful exclamations of the crowd of women--to see the gorgeous apparition leave the hut of the despised people, and then to see, instead of the lovely sick child who still breathed audibly, a silent corpse on the crumpled mat, and in the place of the two tender nurses at her head and feet, two heart-broken, loud-lamenting wretches.  Pentaur's hot spirit was full of wrath.  As soon as the noisy cortege appeared actually in sight he would place himself in the doorway, forbid the princess to enter, and receive her with strong words.  She could hardly come hither out of human kindness.  \"She wants variety,\" said he to himself, \"something new at Court; for there is little going on there now the king tarries with the troops in a distant country; it tickles the vanity of the great to find themselves once in a while in contact with the small, and it is well to have your goodness of heart spoken of by the people.  If a little misfortune opportunely happens, it is not worth the trouble to inquire whether the form of our benevolence does more good or mischief to such wretched people.\"  He ground his teeth angrily, and thought no more of the defilement which might threaten Bent-Anat from the paraschites, but exclusively, on the contrary, of the impending desecration by the princess of the holy feelings astir in this silent room.  Excited as he was to fanaticism, his condemning lips could not fail to find vigorous and impressive words.  He stood drawn to his full height and drawing his breath deeply, like a spirit of light who holds his weapon raised to annihilate a demon of darkness, and he looked out into the valley to perceive from afar the cry of the runners and the rattle of the wheels of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5441"],["title","Uarda : a Romance of Ancient Egypt — Volume 03 (#1)"],["body","things that are done, and cannot be undone.\"  The Nomarch--[Chief of a Nome or district.]--of Suan, in the southern part of the country, asked for funds for a necessary, new embankment. The Regent listened to his eager representation with benevolence, nay with expressions of sympathy; but assured him that the war absorbed all the funds of the state, that the chests were empty; still he felt inclined--even if they had not failed--to sacrifice a part of his own income to preserve the endangered arable land of his faithful province of Suan, to which he desired greeting.  As soon as the Nomarch had left him, he commanded that a considerable sum should be taken out of the Treasury, and sent after the petitioner.  From time to time in the middle of conversation, he arose, and made a gesture of lamentation, to show to the assembled mourners in the court that he sympathized in the losses which had fallen on them.  The sun had already passed the meridian, when a disturbance, accompanied by loud cries, took possession of the masses of people, who stood round the scribes in the palace court.  Many men and women were streaming together towards one spot, and even the most impassive of the Thebans present turned their attention to an incident so unusual in this place.  A detachment of constabulary made a way through the crushing and yelling mob, and another division of Lybian police led a prisoner towards a side gate of the court.  Before they could reach it, a messenger came up with them, from the Regent, who desired to be informed as to what happened.  The head of the officers of public safety followed him, and with eager excitement informed Ani, who was waiting for him, that a tiny man, the dwarf of the Lady Katuti, had for several hours been going about in the court, and endeavoring to poison the minds of the citizens with seditious speeches.  Ani ordered that the misguided man should be thrown into the dungeon; but so soon as the chief officer had left him, he commanded his secretary to have the dwarf brought into his presence before sundown.  While he was giving this order an excitement of another kind seized the assembled multitude.  As the sea parted and stood on the right hand and on the left of the Hebrews, so that no wave wetted the foot of the pursued fugitives, so the crowd of people of their own free will, but as if in reverent submission to some high command, parted and formed a broad way, through which walked the high-priest of the House of Seti, as, full robed and accompanied by some of the \"holy fathers,\" he now entered the court.  The Regent went to meet him, bowed before him, and then withdrew to the back of the hall with him alone.  It is nevertheless incredible,\" said Ameni, \"that our serfs are to follow the militia!\"  \"Rameses requires soldiers--to conquer,\" replied the Regent.  \"And we bread--to live,\" exclaimed the priest.  \"Nevertheless I am commanded, at once, before the seed-time, to levy the temple-serfs.  I regret the order, but the king is the will, and I am only the hand.\"  \"The hand, which he makes use of to sequester ancient rights, and to open a way to the desert over the fruitful land.\"       [\"With good management,\" said the first Napoleon, \"the Nile      encroaches upon the desert, with bad management the desert      encroaches upon the Nile.\"]  \"Your acres will not long remain unprovided for.  Rameses will win new victories with the increased army, and the help of the Gods.\"  \"The Gods! whom he insults!\"  \"After the conclusion of peace he will reconcile the Gods by doubly rich gifts.  He hopes confidently for an early end to the war, and writes to me that after the next battle he wins he intends to offer terms to the Cheta.  A plan of the king's is also spoken of--to marry again, and, indeed, the daughter of the Cheta King Chetasar.\"  Up to this moment the Regent had kept his eyes cast down.  Now he raised them, smiling, as if he would fain enjoy Ameni's satisfaction, and asked:  \"What dost thou say to this project?\"  \"I say,\" returned Ameni, and his voice, usually so stern, took a tone of amusement, \"I say that Rameses seems to think that the blood of thy cousin and of his mother, which gives him his right to the throne, is incapable of pollution.\"  \"It is the blood of the Sun-god!\"  \"Which runs but half pure in his veins, but wholly pure in thine.\"  The Regent made a deprecatory gesture, and said softly, with a smile which resembled that of a dead man:  \"We are not alone.\"  No one is here,\" said Ameni, \"who can hear us; and what I say is known to every child.\"  \"But if it came to the king's ears--\" whispered Ani, \"he--\"  \"He would perceive how unwise it is to derogate from the ancient rights of those on whom it is incumbent to prove the purity of blood of the sovereign of this land.  However, Rameses sits on the throne; may life bloom for him, with health and strength!\"--[A formula which even in private letters constantly follows the name of the Pharaoh.]  The Regent bowed, and then asked:  \"Do you propose to obey the demand of the Pharaoh without delay?\"  \"He is the king.  Our council, which will meet in a few days, can only determine how, and not whether we shall fulfil his command.\"  \"You will retard the departure of the serfs, and Rameses requires them at once.  The bloody labor of the war demands new tools.\"  \"And the peace will perhaps demand a new master, who understands how to employ the sons of the land to its greatest advantage--a genuine son of Ra.\"  The Regent stood opposite the high-priest, motionless as an image cast in bronze, and remained silent; but Ameni lowered his staff before him as before a god, and then went into the fore part of the hall.  When Ani followed him, a soft smile played as usual upon his countenance, and full of dignity he took his seat on the throne.  \"Art thou at an end of thy communications?\"  he asked the high-priest.  \"It remains for me to inform you all,\" replied Ameni with a louder voice, to be heard by all the assembled dignitaries, \"that the princess Bent- Anat yesterday morning committed a heavy sin, and that in all the temples in the land the Gods shall be entreated with offerings to take her uncleanness from her.\"  Again a shadow passed over the smile on the Regent's countenance.  He looked meditatively on the ground, and then said:  \"To-morrow I will visit the House of Seti; till then I beg that this affair may be left to rest.\"  Ameni bowed, and the Regent left the hall to withdraw to a wing of the king's palace, in which he dwelt.  On his writing-table lay sealed papers.  He knew that they contained important news for him; but he loved to do violence to his curiosity, to test his resolution, and like an epicure to reserve the best dish till the last.  He now glanced first at some unimportant letters.  A dumb negro, who squatted at his feet, burned the papyrus rolls which his master gave him in a brazier.  A secretary made notes of the short facts which Ani called out to him, and the ground work was laid of the answers to the different letters.  At a sign from his master this functionary quitted the room, and Ani then slowly opened a letter from the king, whose address: \"To my brother Ani,\" showed that it contained, not public, but private information.  On these lines, as he well knew, hung his future life, and the road it should follow.  With a smile, that was meant to conceal even from himself his deep inward agitation, he broke the wax which sealed the short manuscript in the royal hand.  \"What relates to Egypt, and my concern for my country, and the happy issue of the war,\" wrote the Pharaoh, \"I have written to you by the hand of my secretary; but these words are for the brother, who desires to be my son, and I write to him myself.  The lordly essence of the Divinity which dwells in me, readily brings a quick 'Yes' or 'No' to my lips, and it decides for the best.  Now you demand my daughter Bent-Anat to wife, and I should not be Rameses if I did not freely confess that before I had read the last words of your letter, a vehement 'No' rushed to my lips. I caused the stars to be consulted, and the entrails of the victims to be examined, and they were adverse to your request; and yet I could not refuse you, for you are dear to me, and your blood is royal as my own. Even more royal, an old friend said, and warned me against your ambition and your exaltation.  Then my heart changed, for I were not Seti's son if I allow myself to injure a friend through idle apprehensions; and he who stands so high that men fear that he may try to rise above Rameses, seems to me to be worthy of Bent-Anat.  Woo her, and, should she consent freely, the marriage may be celebrated on the day when I return home. You are young enough to make a wife happy, and your mature wisdom will guard my child from misfortune.  Bent-Anat shall know that her father, and king, encourages your suit; but pray too to the Hathors, that they may influence Bent-Anat's heart in your favor, for to her decision we must both submit.\"  The Regent had changed color several times while reading this letter. Now he laid it on the table with a shrug of his shoulders, stood up, clasped his hand behind him, and, with his eyes cast meditatively on the floor, leaned against one of the pillars which supported the beams of the roof.  The longer he thought, the less amiable his expression became.  \"A pill sweetened with honey,       [Two recipes for pills are found in the papyri, one with honey for      women, and one without for men.]  such as they give to women,\" he muttered to himself.  Then he went back to the table, read the king's letter through once more, and said: \"One may learn from it how to deny by granting, and at the same time not to forget to give it a brilliant show of magnanimity.  Rameses knows his daughter.  She is a girl like any other, and will take good care not to choose a man twice as old as herself, and who might be her father. Rameses will 'submit'--I am to I submit!'
