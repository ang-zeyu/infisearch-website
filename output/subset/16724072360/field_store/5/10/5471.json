Golden boats were sailing on this lake and in them sat lovely boys and girls dressed in snow-white garments, and singing sweet songs as they passed over the water.  There were no rowers to direct these boats, and yet they moved over the ripples of the lake in a graceful order, as if guided by some magic unseen hand.  A large ship sailed in the midst of this little fleet.  Its deck glittered with precious stones.  It seemed to be steered by one beautiful boy only, and, strange to say, the rudder he guided consisted of one white lotusflower, the delicate leaves of which seemed scarcely to touch the water.  A very lovely woman, dressed like a queen, lay on silken cushions in the middle of the vessel; by her side sat a man of larger stature than that of ordinary mortals.  He wore a crown of ivy on his flowing curls, a panther-skin hung over his shoulders and he held a crooked staff in the right hand.  In the back part of the ship was a roof made of ivy, lotus- blossoms and roses; beneath it stood a milk-white cow with golden horns, covered with a cloth of purple.  The man was Osiris, the woman Isis, the boy at the helm their son Horus, and the cow was the animal sacred to the immortal Isis.  The little boats all skimmed over the water, singing glad songs of joy as they passed by the ship, and receiving in return showers of flowers and fruits, thrown down upon the lovely singers by the god and goddess within.  Suddenly I heard the roll of thunder.  It came crashing on, louder, and louder, and in the midst of this awful sound a man in the skin of a wild boar, with hideous features and bristling red hair, came out of the gloomiest part of the sacred grove, plunged into the lake, followed by seventy creatures like himself, and swam up to the ship of Osiris.       [We have taken our description of this spectacle entirely from the      Osiris-myth, as we find it in Plutarch, Isis and Orisis 13-19.      Diod. I. 22. and a thousand times repeated on the monuments.  Horus      is called \"the avenger of his father,\" &c.  We copy the battle with      all its phases from an inscription at Edfu, interpreted by Naville.]  \"The little boats fled with the swiftness of the wind, and the trembling boy helmsman dropped his lotusblossom.  \"The dreadful monster then rushed on Osiris, and, with the help of his comrades, killed him, threw the body into a coffin and the coffin into the lake, the waters of which seemed to carry it away as if by magic. Isis meanwhile had escaped to land in one of the small boats, and was now running hither and thither on the shores of the lake, with streaming hair, lamenting her dead husband and followed by the virgins who had escaped with her.  Their songs and dances, while seeking the body of Osiris, were strangely plaintive and touching, and the girls accompanied the dance by waving black Byssus scarfs in wonderfully graceful curves. Neither were the youths idle; they busied themselves in making a costly coffin for the vanished corpse of the god, accompanying their work with dances and the sound of castanets.  When this was finished they joined the maidens in the train of the lamenting Isis and wandered on the shore with them, singing and searching.  \"Suddenly a low song rose from some invisible lips.  It swelled louder and louder and announced, that the body of the god had been transported by the currents of the Mediterranean to Gebal in distant Phoenicia.  This singing voice thrilled to my very heart; Neithotep's son, who was my companion, called it 'the wind of rumor.'  \"When Isis heard the glad news, she threw off her mourning garments and sang a song of triumphant rejoicing, accompanied by the voices of her beautiful followers.  Rumor had not lied; the goddess really found the sarcophagus and the dead body of her husband on the northern shore of the lake.       [It is natural, that Isis should find the body of her husband in the      north.  The connection between Phoenicia and Egypt in this myth, as      it has been handed down to us by Plutarch, is very remarkable.  We      consider the explanation of the close affinity between the Isis and      Osiris and the Adonis myths to be in the fact, that Egyptians and      Phoenicians lived together on the shores of the Delta where the      latter had planted their colonies.  Plutarch's story of the finding      of Osiris' dead body is very charming.  Isis and Osiris.  Ed. Parth.      15.]  \"They brought both to land with dances; Isis threw herself on the beloved corpse, called on the name of Osiris and covered the mummy with kisses, while the youths wove a wonderful tomb of lotus-flowers and ivy.  \"When the coffin had been laid under this beautiful vault, Isis left the sad place of mourning and went to look for her son.  She found him at the east end of the lake, where for a long time I had seen a beautiful youth practising arms with a number of companions.  \"While she was rejoicing over her newly-found child, a fresh peal of thunder told that Typhon had returned.  This time the monster rushed upon the beautiful flowering grave, tore the body out of its coffin, hewed it into fourteen pieces, and strewed them over the shores of the lake.  \"When Isis came back to the grave, she found nothing but faded flowers and an empty coffin; but at fourteen different places on the shore fourteen beautiful colored flames were burning.  She and her virgins ran to these flames, while Horus led the youths to battle against Typhon on the opposite shore.  \"My eyes and ears hardly sufficed for all I had to see and hear.  On the one shore a fearful and interesting struggle, peals of thunder and the braying of trumpets; on the other the sweet voices of the women, singing the most captivating songs to the most enchanting dances, for Isis had found a portion of her husband's body at every fire and was rejoicing.  \"That was something for you, Zopyrus!  I know of no words to describe the grace of those girls' movements, or how beautiful it was to see them first mingling in intricate confusion, then suddenly standing in faultless, unbroken lines, falling again into the same lovely tumult and passing once more into order, and all this with the greatest swiftness. Bright rays of light flashed from their whirling ranks all the time, for each dancer had a mirror fastened between her shoulders, which flashed while she was in motion, and reflected the scene when she was still.  \"Just as Isis had found the last limb but one of the murdered Osiris, loud songs of triumph and the flourish of trumpets resounded from the opposite shore.  \"Horus had conquered Typhon, and was forcing his way into the nether regions to free his father.  The gate to this lower world opened on the west side of the lake and was guarded by a fierce female hippopotamus.  \"And now a lovely music of flutes and harps came nearer and nearer, heavenly perfumes rose into the air, a rosy light spread over the sacred grove, growing brighter every minute, and Osiris came up from the lower world, led by his victorious son.  Isis hastened to embrace her risen and delivered husband, gave the beautiful Horus his lotus-flower again instead of the sword, and scattered fruits and flowers over the earth, while Osiris seated himself under a canopy wreathed with ivy, and received the homage of all the spirits of the earth and of the Amenti.\"       [The lower world, in Egyptian Amenti, properly speaking, the West or      kingdom of death, to which the soul returns at the death of the      body, as the sun at his setting.  In a hieroglyphic inscription of      the time of the Ptolemies the Amenti is called Hades.]  Darius was silent.  Rhodopis began:  \"We thank you for your charming account; but this strange spectacle must have a higher meaning, and we should thank you doubly if you would explain that to us.\"  \"Your idea is quite right,\" answered Darius, \"but what I know I dare not tell.  I was obliged to promise Neithotep with an oath, not to tell tales out of school.\"  \"Shall I tell you,\" asked Rhodopis, \"what conclusions various hints from Pythagoras and Onuphis have led me to draw, as to the meaning of this drama?  Isis seems to me to represent the bountiful earth; Osiris, humidity or the Nile, which makes the earth fruitful; Horus, the young spring; Typhon, the scorching drought.  The bounteous earth, robbed of her productive power, seeks this beloved husband with lamentations in the cooler regions of the north, where the Nile discharges his waters.  At last Horus, the young springing power of nature, is grown up and conquers Typhon, or the scorching drought.  Osiris, as is the case with the fruitful principle of nature, was only apparently dead, rises from the nether regions and once more rules the blessed valley of the Nile, in concert with his wife, the bounteous earth.\"  \"And as the murdered god behaved properly in the lower regions,\" said Zopyrus, laughing, \"he is allowed, at the end of this odd story, to receive homage from the inhabitants of Hamestegan, Duzakh and Gorothman, or whatever they call these abodes for the Egyptian spirit-host.\"  \"They are called Amenti,\" said Darius, falling into his friend's merry mood; but you must know that the history of this divine pair represents not only the life of nature, but also that of the human soul, which, like the murdered Osiris, lives an eternal life, even when the body is dead.\"  \"Thank you,\" said the other; \"I'll try to remember that if I should chance to die in Egypt.  But really, cost what it may, I must see this wonderful sight soon.\"  \"Just my own wish,\" said Rhodopis.  \"Age is inquisitive.\"  \"Yo"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5460"],["title","An Egyptian Princess — Complete (#1)"],["body","our oldest and most beautiful fairy tale, Cinderella; another is near akin to the Loreley legend. An eagle, according to AElian--the wind, in Strabo’s tale,--bore away Rhodopis’ slippers while she was bathing in the Nile, and laid them at the feet of the king, when seated on his throne of justice in the open market. The little slippers so enchanted him that he did not rest until he had discovered their owner and made her his queen.  The second legend tells us how a wonderfully beautiful naked woman could be seen sitting on the summit of one of the pyramids (ut in una ex pyramidibus); and how she drove the wanderers in the desert mad through her exceeding loveliness.  Moore borrowed this legend and introduces it in the following verse:         “Fair Rhodope, as story tells--         The bright unearthly nymph, who dwells         ‘Mid sunless gold and jewels hid,         The lady of the Pyramid.”  Fabulous as these stories sound, they still prove that Rhodopis must have been no ordinary woman. Some scholars would place her on a level with the beautiful and heroic Queen Nitokris, spoken of by Julius Africanus, Eusebius and others, and whose name, (signifying the victorious Neith) has been found on the monuments, applied to a queen of the sixth dynasty. This is a bold conjecture; it adds however to the importance of our heroine; and without doubt many traditions referring to the one have been transferred to the other, and vice versa. Herodotus lived so short a time after Rhodopis, and tells so many exact particulars of her private life that it is impossible she should have been a mere creation of fiction. The letter of Darius, given at the end of Vol. II., is intended to identify the Greek Rhodopis with the mythical builder of the Pyramid. I would also mention here that she is called Doricha by Sappho. This may have been her name before she received the title of the “rosy-cheeked one.”  I must apologize for the torrent of verse that appears in the love-scenes between Sappho and Bartja; it is also incumbent upon me to say a few words about the love-scenes themselves, which I have altered very slightly in the new edition, though they have been more severely criticised than any other portion of the work.  First I will confess that the lines describing the happy love of a handsome young couple to whom I had myself become warmly attached, flowed from my pen involuntarily, even against my will (I intended to write a novel in prose) in the quiet night, by the eternal Nile, among the palms and roses. The first love-scene has a story of its own to me. I wrote it in half an hour, almost unconsciously. It may be read in my book that the Persians always reflected in the morning, when sober, upon the resolutions formed the night before, while drunk. When I examined in the sunshine what had come into existence by lamplight, I grew doubtful of its merits, and was on the point of destroying the love-scenes altogether, when my dear friend Julius Hammer, the author of “Schau in Dich, und Schau um Dich,” too early summoned to the other world by death, stayed my hand. Their form was also approved by others, and I tell myself that the ‘poetical’ expression of love is very similar in all lands and ages, while lovers’ conversations and modes of intercourse vary according to time and place. Besides, I have to deal with one of those by no means rare cases, where poetry can approach nearer the truth than prudent, watchful prose. Many of my honored critics have censured these scenes; others, among whom are some whose opinion I specially value, have lavished the kindest praise upon them. Among these gentlemen I will mention A. Stahr, C. V. Holtei, M. Hartmann, E. Hoefer, W. Wolfsohn, C. Leemans, Professor Veth of Amsterdam, etc. Yet I will not conceal the fact that some, whose opinion has great weight, have asked: “Did the ancients know anything of love, in our sense of the word? Is not romantic love, as we know it, a result of Christianity?” The following sentence, which stands at the head of the preface to my first edition, will prove that I had not ignored this question when I began my task.     “It has often been remarked that in Cicero’s letters and those of    Pliny the younger there are unmistakable indications of sympathy    with the more sentimental feeling of modern days. I find in them    tones of deep tenderness only, such as have arisen and will arise    from sad and aching hearts in every land and every age.”                 A. v. HUMBOLDT. Cosmos II. P. 19.  This opinion of our great scholar is one with which I cheerfully coincide and would refer my readers to the fact that love-stories were written before the Christian era: the Amor and Psyche of Apuleius for instance. Indeed love in all its forms was familiar to the ancients. Where can we find a more beautiful expression of ardent passion than glows in Sappho’s songs? or of patient faithful constancy than in Homer’s Penelope? Could there be a more beautiful picture of the union of two loving hearts, even beyond the grave, than Xenophon has preserved for us in his account of Panthea and Abradatas? or the story of Sabinus the Gaul and his wife, told in the history of Vespasian? Is there anywhere a sweeter legend than that of the Halcyons, the ice-birds, who love one another so tenderly that when the male becomes enfeebled by age, his mate carries him on her outspread wings whithersoever he will; and the gods, desiring to reward such faithful love, cause the sun to shine more kindly, and still the winds and waves on the “Halcyon days”  during which these birds are building their nest and brooding over their young? There can surely have been no lack of romantic love in days when a used-up man of the world, like Antony, could desire in his will that wherever he died his body might be laid by the side of his beloved Cleopatra: nor of the chivalry of love when Berenice’s beautiful hair was placed as a constellation in the heavens. Neither can we believe that devotion in the cause of love could be wanting when a whole nation was ready to wage a fierce and obstinate war for the sake of one beautiful woman. The Greeks had an insult to revenge, but the Trojans fought for the possession of Helen. Even the old men of Ilium were ready “to suffer long for such a woman.” And finally is not the whole question answered in Theocritus’ unparalleled poem, “the Sorceress?” We see the poor love-lorn girl and her old woman-servant, Thestylis, cowering over the fire above which the bird supposed to possess the power of bringing back the faithless Delphis is sitting in his wheel. Simoetha has learnt many spells and charms from an Assyrian, and she tries them all. The distant roar of the waves, the stroke rising from the fire, the dogs howling in the street, the tortured fluttering bird, the old woman, the broken-hearted girl and her awful spells, all join in forming a night scene the effect of which is heightened by the calm cold moonshine. The old woman leaves the girl, who at once ceases to weave her spells, allows her pent-up tears to have their way, and looking up to Selene the moon, the lovers’ silent confidante, pours out her whole story: how when she first saw the beautiful Delphis her heart had glowed with love, she had seen nothing more of the train of youths who followed him, “and,”  (thus sadly the poet makes her speak)                 “how I gained my home         I knew not; some strange fever wasted me.         Ten days and nights I lay upon my bed.         O tell me, mistress Moon, whence came my love!”  “Then” (she continues) when Delphis at last crossed her threshold:                           “I         Became all cold like snow, and from my brow         Brake the damp dewdrops: utterance I had none,         Not e’en such utterance as a babe may make         That babbles to its mother in its dreams;         But all my fair frame stiffened into wax,--         O tell me mistress Moon, whence came my love!”  Whence came her love? thence, whence it comes to us now. The love of the creature to its Creator, of man to God, is the grand and yet gracious gift of Christianity. Christ’s command to love our neighbor called into existence not only the conception of philanthropy, but of humanity itself, an idea unknown to the heathen world, where love had been at widest limited to their native town and country. The love of man and wife has without doubt been purified and transfigured by Christianity; still it is possible that a Greek may have loved as tenderly and longingly as a Christian. The more ardent glow of passion at least cannot be denied to the ancients. And did not their love find vent in the same expressions as our own? Who does not know the charming roundelay:            “Drink the glad wine with me,           With me spend youth’s gay hours;           Or a sighing lover be,           Or crown thy brow with flowers.           When I am merry and mad,           Merry and mad be you;           When I am sober and sad,           Be sad and sober too!”  --written however by no poet of modern days, but by Praxilla, in the fifth century before Christ. Who would guess either that Moore’s little song was modelled on one written even earlier than the date of our story?            “As o’er her loom the Lesbian maid           In love-sick languor hung her head.           Unknowing where her fingers stray’d,           She weeping turned away and said,’           Oh, my sweet mother, ‘tis in vain,            I cannot weave as once I wove;           So wilder’d is my heart and brain           With thinking of that youth I love.’”  If my space allowed I could add much more on this subject, but will permit myself only one remark in conclusion. Lovers delighted in nature then as now; the moon was their chosen confidante, and I know of no modern poem in which the mysterious charm of a summer night and the magic beauty which lies on flowers, trees and fountains in those silent hours when the world"]]]
