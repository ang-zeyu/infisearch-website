They write it on the walls in rest rooms.\"  \"Of course they do--because they don't understand! They are afraid of us. Wouldn't you be afraid of someone who could do the things we do, if you _couldn't_ do them?\"  Just like that, it was over.  That is, the first shock was over. Mrs. Jamieson watched Earl leave the house, walking slowly along the river, a boy with a man's problems. His friends called to him from the river, but he chose not to hear. He wanted to be alone. He needed to think, to feel the newness of the thing.  Perhaps he would cross the river and enter the deep forest there. When the initial shock wore off he might experiment with his new power. He would not travel far, in these first attempts. Probably he would stay within walking distance of his clothes, because he still lacked the tricks others had learned.  It was a hot, mucky afternoon with storm clouds pushing out of the west. Mrs. Jamieson put on her swimming suit and wandered down to the river to cool herself.         *       *       *       *       *  For the remainder of that summer they worked together. They practiced at night mostly, taking longer and longer jumps, until Earl's confidence allowed him to reach any part of the Earth he chose. She knew the habits of Agents. She knew how to avoid them.  They would select a spot sufficiently remote to insure detection, she would devise some prank to irritate the Agents; then they would quickly return to Wisconsin. The Agents would rush to the calculated spot, but would find only the bare footprints of a woman and a boy. They would swear and drive back to their offices to dig through files, searching for some clue to their identity.  It was inevitable that they should identify Mrs. Jamieson as one of the offenders, since they had discovered, even before Stinson took his group to Centaurus, that individuals had thought patterns peculiar to themselves. These could be identified, if caught on their detectors, and even recorded for the files. But the files proved confusing, for they said that Mrs. Jamieson had gone to Centaurus with the others.  Had she returned to Earth? The question did not trouble them long. They had more serious problems. Stinson had selected only the best of the Konvs when he left Earth, leaving all those with criminal tendencies behind. They could have followed if they chose--what could stop them? But it was more lucrative to stay. On Earth they could rob, loot, even murder--without fear of the law.  Earl changed.  Even before the summer was over, he matured. The childish antics of his friends began to bore him. \"Be careful, Earl,\" his mother would say. \"Remember who you are. Play with them sometimes, even if you don't like it. You have a long way to go before you will be ready.\"  During the long winter evenings, after they had watched their favorite video programs, they would sit by the fireplace. \"Tell me about the great ones,\" he would say, and she would repeat all the things she remembered about Stinson and Benjamin and Straus. She never tired of discussing them. She would tell about Benjamin's wife, Lisa, and try to describe the horror in Lisa's young mind when the news went out that E. Mason Jamieson had been killed. She wanted him to learn as much as possible about his father's death, knowing that soon the Agents would be after Earl. They were so clever, so persistent. She wanted him to be ready, not only in ways of avoiding their traps ... but ready with a heart full of hate.  Sometimes when she talked about her husband, Mrs. Jamieson wanted to stand up and scream at her son, \"Hate, hate! Hate! You must learn to hate!\" But she clenched her hands over her knitting, knowing that he would learn it faster if she avoided the word.         *       *       *       *       *  The winter passed, and the next summer, and two more summers.  Earl was ready for college. They had successfully kept their secret. They had been vigilant in every detail. Earl referred to the \"damn Agents\" now with a curl of his lip. They had been successful in contacting other Konvs, and sometimes visited them at a remote rendezvous.  \"When you have finished college,\" Mrs. Jamieson told her son, \"we will go to Centaurus.\"  \"Why not now?\"  \"Because when you get there they will need men who can contribute to the development of the planet. Stinson is a physicist, Benjamin a metallurgist, Straus a doctor. But Straus is an old man by this time. A young doctor will be needed. Study hard, Earl. Learn all you can. Even the great ones get sick.\"  She did not mention her secret hope, that before they left Earth he would have fully avenged his father's death. He was clever and intelligent.  He could kill many Agents.  So she exhumed the money she had hidden more than ten years before. The house beside the Little Wolf river was sold. They found a modest bungalow within walking distance of the University's medical school. Mrs. Jamieson furnished it carefully but, oddly, rather lavishly.  This was her husband's money she was spending now. It needed to last only a few years. Then they would leave Earth forever.  A room was built on the east side of the bungalow, with its own private entrance. This was Earl's room. Ostensibly the private entrance was for convenience due to the irregular hours of college students.  It was also convenient for coming home late at night after Agent hunting.  Mrs. Jamieson was becoming obvious.  Excitement brought color to her cheeks when she thought of Earl facing one of them--a lean, cunning jaguar facing a fat, lazy bear. It was her notion that federal Agents were evil creatures, tools of a decadent, bloodthirsty society, living off the fat of the land.  She painted the room herself, in soft, pastel colors. When it was finished she showed Earl regally into the room, making a big joke of it.  \"Here you can study and relax, and have those bull sessions students are always having,\" she said.  \"There will be no friends,\" he answered, \"not here. No Konvs will be at the university.\"  \"Why not? Stinson selected only educated, intelligent people. When one dies the cylinder is taken and adjusted to a new thought pattern--usually a person from the same family. I would say it is very likely that Konvs will be found here.\"         *       *       *       *       *  He shook his head. \"No. They knew we were coming, and no one said a word about others being here. I'm afraid we are alone.\"  \"Well, I think not,\" she said firmly. \"Anyway, the room will be comfortable.\"  He shook his head again. \"Why can't I be in the house with you? There are two bedrooms.\"  She said quickly, \"You can if you wish. I just thought you'd like being alone, at your age. Most boys do.\"  \"I'm not like most boys, mother. The Konvs saw to that. Sometimes I'm sorry. Back in high school I used to wish I was like the others. Do you remember Lorane Peters?\" His mother nodded. \"Well, when we were seniors last year she liked me quite a lot. She didn't say so, but I knew it. She would sit across the aisle from me, and sometimes when I saw how her hair fell over her face when she read, I wanted to lean over and whisper to her, 'Hey, Lorrie--' just as if I was human--'can I take you to the basketball game?'\"  Mrs. Jamieson turned to leave the room, but he stopped her. \"You understand what I'm saying, don't you?\"  \"No, I don't!\" she said sharply. \"You're old enough to face realities. You are a Konv. You always will be a Konv. _Have you forgotten your own father?_\"  She turned her back and slammed the door. Earl stood very still for a long time in the room that was to have been happy for him. She was crying just beyond the wall.  Earl did not use the room that first year. He slept in the second bedroom. He did not mention his frustrated desires to be normal, not after the first attempt, but he persisted in his efforts to be so. Use of the cylinder was out of the question for them now, anyway.  In the spring Mrs. Jamieson caught a virus cold which resulted in a long convalescence. Earl moved into the new bedroom. At first she thought he moved in an effort to please her because of the illness, but she soon grew aware of her mistake.  One day he disappeared.         *       *       *       *       *  Mrs. Jamieson was alarmed. Had the Agents found him? She watched the papers daily for some word of Konvs being killed.  The second day after his disappearance she found a small item. A Konv had raided the Agent's office in Stockholm, killing three, and getting killed himself. Mrs. Jamieson dropped the paper immediately and went to Stockholm. She did not consider the risk. In Stockholm she found clothes and made discreet inquiries. The slain man had been a Finnish Konv, one of those left behind by Stinson as an undesirable. His wife had been killed by the Agents the week before. He had gone completely insane and made the raid singlehanded. Mrs. Jamieson read the account of crimes committed by the man and his wife, and determined to prevent Earl from making the mistake of taking on more than he could handle.  When she arrived at her own home, Earl was in his room.  \"Where have you been?\" she asked petulantly.  \"Oh, here and there.\"  \"I thought you were involved in that fight in Stockholm.\"  He shook his head.  She stood in the doorway and watched him leaning over his desk, attempting to write something on a sheet of paper. She was proud of his profile, tow-headed as a boy, handsome in a masculine way. He cracked his knuckles nervously.  \"What did you do?\" she asked.  Suddenly he flung the pencil down, jumped from his chair and paced the floor. \"I talked to an Agent last night,\" he said.  \"Where?\"  \"Bangkok.\"  Mrs. Jamieson had to sit down. Finally she was able to ask, \"How did it happen?\"  \"I broke into the office there to get at the records. He caught me.\"  \"What were you looking for?\"  \"I wanted to learn the names of the men who killed Father.\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51605"],["title","Jamieson (#2)"],["body"," said the word strangely. He was unaccustomed to it.  \"Did you find them?\"  He pointed to the paper on his desk. Mrs. Jamieson, trembling, picked it up and read the names. Seeing them there, written like any other names would be written, made her furious. How could they? How could the names of murderers look like ordinary names? When she thought them in her mind, they even sounded like ordinary names--and they shouldn't! She had always thought that those names, if she ever saw them, would be filthy, unholy scratches on paper, evil sounds, like the rustle of bedclothes to a jealous lover listening at a keyhole. \"Tom Palieu\" didn't sound evil; neither did \"Al Jonson.\" She was shaken by this more than she would permit Earl to see.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Why did you want the names?\"  \"I don't know,\" he said. \"Curiosity, maybe, or a subconscious desire for revenge. I just wanted to see them.\"  \"Tell me what happened! If an Agent saw you ... well, either he killed you or you killed him. But you're here alive.\"  \"I didn't kill him. That's what seems so strange. And he didn't try to kill me. We didn't even fight. He didn't ask why I broke in without breaking the lock or even a window. He seemed to know. He did ask what I was doing there, and who I was. I told him, and ... he helped me get the names. He asked where I lived. 'None of your damn business,' I told him. Then he said he didn't blame me for not telling, that Konvs must fear Agents, and hate them. Then he said, 'Do you know why we kill Konvs? We kill them because there is no prison cell in the world that will hold a Konv. When they break the law, we have no choice. It is a terrible thing, but must be done. We don't want your secret; we only want law and order. There is room enough in the world for both of us.'\"  Mrs. Jamieson was furious. \"And you believed him?\"  \"I don't know. I just know what he said--and that he let me go without trying to shoot me.\"  Mrs. Jamieson stopped on her way out of the room and laid a hand on his arm. \"Your father would have been proud of you,\" she said. \"Soon you will learn the truth about the Agents.\"  Beyond the closed door, out of sight of her son, Mrs. Jamieson gave rein to the excitement that ran through her. He had wanted the names! He didn't know why--not yet--but he would. \"He'll do it yet!\" she whispered to the flowered wallpaper. She didn't care that no one heard her.  She didn't know where the men were now, those who had killed her husband. They could be anywhere. Agents moved from post to post; in ten years they might be scattered all over Earth. In the killing of Konvs, some cylinders might even be taken by Agents--and used by them, for the power and freedom the cylinders gave must be coveted even by them. And they were in the best position to gain them. She was consumed by fear that one or more of the men on Earl's list might have acquired a cylinder and were now Konvs themselves.         *       *       *       *       *  Two weeks later she read a news item saying that Tom Palieu had been killed by a Konv. The assassin's identity was unknown, but agents were working on the case.  She knew. She had found a gun in Earl's desk.  She took the paper into Earl's room. \"Did you do this?\"  He turned away from her. \"It doesn't matter whether I did or not. They will suspect me. His name was on the list.\"  \"They will,\" she agreed. \"It doesn't matter who the Konv is, now that an Agent has been killed. The one in Bangkok will tell them about you and the list of names, and it's all they need.\"  \"Well, what else can he do?\" Earl asked. \"After all, he is an Agent. If one of them is killed, he will have to tell what he knows.\"  \"You're defending him? Why?\" she cried. \"Tell me why!\"  He removed her hand from his arm. Her nails were digging into his flesh. \"I don't know why. Mother, I'm sorry, but Agents are just people to me. I can't hate them the way you do.\"  Mrs. Jamieson's face colored, then drained white.  Suddenly, with a wide, furious sweep of her hand, she slapped his face. So much strength and rage was in her arm that the blow almost sent him spinning. They faced each other, she breathing hard from the exertion, Earl stunned immobile--not by the blow, but from the knowledge that she could hate so suddenly, viciously.  She controlled herself. \"We must find a way to leave here,\" she said, calmly.  \"They won't find us.\"  \"Oh, yes they will,\" she said. \"Don't underestimate them. Agents are picked from the most intelligent people on Earth. It will be a small job for them. Don't forget they know who you are. Even if you hadn't been so stupid as to tell them, they'd know. They knew my pattern from the time your father was alive. They got yours when we were together years ago, teasing them. They linked your pattern with mine. They know that your father and I had a son. Your birth was recorded. The only difficult aspect of their job now is to find where you live, and it won't be impossible. They will drive their cars through every city on Earth with those new detectors, until they pick up your pattern or mine. I'm afraid it's time to leave Earth.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Earl sat down suddenly, \"It's just as well. I thought maybe some day I might hate them too, or learn to like them. But I can do neither, so I am halfway between, and no man can live this way.\"  She did not answer him. Finally he said, \"It doesn't make sense to you, does it?\"  \"No, it doesn't. This is not the time for such discussions, anyway. The Agents have their machines working at top speed, while we sit here and talk.\"  Suddenly they were not alone.  No sound was generated by the man's coming. One instant they were talking alone, the next he was here. Earl saw him first. He was a middle-aged man whose hair was completely white. He stood near the desk, easily, as if standing there were the most natural way to relax. He was entirely nude ... but it seemed natural and right.  Then Mrs. Jamieson saw him.  \"Benjamin!\" she cried. \"I knew someone would come.\"  He smiled. \"This is your son?\"  \"Yes,\" she said. \"We are ready.\"  \"I remember when you were born,\" he said, and smiled in reminiscence. \"Your father was afraid you would be twins.\"  Earl said, \"Why was my father killed?\"  \"By mistake. Back in those days, like now, there were good Konvs and bad. One of those not selected by Stinson to join us was enraged, half crazy with envy. He killed two women there in Bangkok. The Agents thought Jamieson--I mean, your father--did it. Jamieson was the greatest man among us. It was he who first conceived the theory that there was a basic, underlying law in the operation of the cylinders. Even now, no one knows how the idea of love ties in with the Stinson Effect; but we do know that hate and greed as motivating forces can greatly minimize the cylinders' power. That is why the undesirables with cylinders have never reached Centaurus.\"  Heavy steps sounded on the porch outside.  \"We'd better hurry,\" Mrs. Jamieson said.  Benjamin held out his hands. They took them, to increase the power of the cylinders. As the Agents pounded on the door, Mrs. Jamieson flicked one thought of hatred at them, but of course they did not hear her. Benjamin's hands gripped tightly.  Mrs. Jamieson slowly opened her eyes....  She no longer felt the hands. _She was still in the room!_ Benjamin and her son were gone. Her outstretched hands touched nothing.  Her power was gone!  The Agents stepped into the room over the broken door. She stared at them, then ran to Earl's desk, fumbling for the gun.  The Agents' guns rattled.  Love, Benjamin said, the greatest of these is love. Or did someone else say that? Someone, somewhere, perhaps in another time, in some misty, forgotten chip of time long gone, in another frame of reference perhaps....  Mrs. Jamieson could not remember, before she died."]]]
