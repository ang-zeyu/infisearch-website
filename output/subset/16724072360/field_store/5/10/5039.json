In the present instance, however, though I deem it necessary to tell again such a well known story as the rise of The Church, I shall attempt no embellishment of it; nor shall I deal with the religious condition of the world at the time of the origin of The Church with any view to establish the probability of the story; nor stop to call attention to the reasonableness and strength of it; nor the evidences of its truth, or necessity, although the temptation to do this is always strong whenever the facts of that story are passed before me in review. I shall content myself on this occasion with a mere statement of the facts, such as an annalist might make, without any further consideration of them whatsoever; and this because such a statement will serve my present purpose.  Joseph Smith, the man who, under the direction of God, was the founder of The Church, was born at the little village of Sharon, Windsor County, in the State of Vermont, on the 23rd of December, in the year of our Lord 1805.  When he was ten years of age the Smith family moved from Vermont to the State of New York, settling in Palmyra, Wayne County. Four years later the family moved a few miles south to the town of Manchester, Ontario County.  Here, in the spring of 1820, a great religious revival agitated the community, and Joseph Smith was much affected by it.  In the course of this religious excitement he was much perplexed over the discussion and strifes of the different Christian sects, and often wondered how it was that the Church of Christ could be so divided into contending factions. \"I found,\" he said some years later when writing his recollections of those early days of his religious experience--\"I found that there was a great clash in religious sentiment; if I went to one society they referred me to one plan, and another to another--each one pointing to his own particular creed as the _summum bonum_ of perfection. Considering that all could not be right, and that God could not be the author of so much confusion, I determined to investigate the subject more fully, believing that if God had a Church it would not be split up into factions, and that if he taught one society to worship one way and administer in one set of ordinances, he would not teach another principles which were diametrically opposed.\" [B]  [Footnote B: From a letter to Mr. John Wentworth, written in 1842. Mr. Wentworth at the time was the editor of the _Chicago Democrat_.]  In the midst of these perplexities Joseph's attention was called to the first chapter of the epistle of James, where it is written: \"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and unbraideth not; and it shall be given him.\"  This instruction the youth determined to follow, and accordingly repaired to a secret place in the woods near his father's house, where he called upon God for wisdom.  While so engaged he was seized upon by some power of darkness which threw him violently to the ground, and it seemed for a time that he was doomed to sudden destruction. It was no imaginary power, but some actual being from the unseen world who thus seized him. His tongue for a time was bound that he could not speak; darkness gathered about him; but, exerting all his powers, he called upon God to deliver him out of the hands of his enemy, and at the very moment he was ready to give up in despair and abandon himself to destruction, he beheld a pillar of light immediately over his head descending towards him. Its brightness was above that of the sun at noonday, and no sooner did it envelop him than he was freed from the enemy who had held him in his power.  When the light rested upon him he beheld within it two personages standing above him in the air, whose brightness and glory defied all description. They exactly resembled each other in form and features. One of them, pointing to the other, said:   \"JOSEPH, THIS IS MY BELOVED SON, HEAR HIM.\"  As soon as the youth gained his self-possession, he asked the personage to whom he was thus introduced, which of all the religious sects was right, that he might join it.  He was answered that none of the sects were right; that their creeds were an abomination to God; that their professors were corrupt; that they drew near to God with their lips but their hearts were far removed from him; that they taught for doctrine the commandments of men; that they had a form of godliness but denied the power thereof; and he was strictly commanded to join none of them: but was informed that at some future time the fullness of the Gospel would be made known to him.[C]  [Footnote C: Letter to Mr. John Wentworth, 1842.  I cannot refrain at this point from calling attention, at least in a foot note, to the importance of this great vision which lies at the very foundation of what the world calls \"Mormonism.\"  At a glance it gives the reason for the existence of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints; and also the reason for the proclamation of the new dispensation of the Gospel it presents to the world.  It makes known the awful fact that the Gospel was not on the earth at that time; that none of the churches were acknowledged of God as his; that divine authority to preach and administer the ordinances of salvation was not among men. Therefore if men were to have the Gospel of Jesus Christ it must be restored from heaven; the Church of Christ must be again established; divine authority must be renewed.  Moreover, this splendid vision dispelled the vagaries that men had conjured up in respect to the person of Deity. Instead of being a personage without body, parts or passions, it revealed the fact that he had both body and parts, that he was in the form of man, or, rather, that man had been made in his image.  The vision clearly proves that the Father and Son are distinct persons, and not one person as the Christian world believes. The oneness of the Godhead, so frequently spoken of in scripture, must therefore relate to oneness of sentiment and agreement in purpose--to likeness.  The great revelation swept away the rubbish of human dogma, tradition and speculation that had accumulated in all the ages since Messiah's personal ministry on earth, by announcing that God did not acknowledge any of the sects of Christendom as his Church, nor their creeds as his gospel. Indeed, the Lord himself declared that they taught for doctrine the commandments of men. Thus the ground was cleared for the planting of the truth.  The vision showed how mistaken the Christian world was in claiming that all revelation had ceased--that God would no more reveal himself to man.  The vision created a witness for God on the earth: a man lived who could say to some purpose that God lived and that Jesus was the Christ, for he had seen and talked with them. Thus was laid anew the foundation for faith in God.--_Roberts_.]  This heavenly visitation Joseph Smith related to many of his acquaintances, including some sectarian ministers, who generally disbelieved his story and ridiculed him for telling it; all said inspired dreams and revelations from God were no more to be expected.  After an interval of three years Joseph Smith again received a heavenly visitant. On the 21st of September, 1823, after having retired to his chamber, he betook himself to prayer, seeking to know his standing before the Lord. While so engaged his room began to be filled with beautiful light, in the midst of which he beheld a personage who announced himself to be Moroni, one of the ancient prophets of the western hemisphere, now raised from the dead, and made an angel of God. He said he was sent from the Divine Presence to reveal the existence of an ancient record engraven upon plates of gold, giving an account of the origin of the American Indians; of God's hand-dealings with their forefathers; of the rise and fall of their civilization; of the ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ among them after his resurrection from the dead and of the establishment of the Christian religion and the Church of God in their midst.  Joseph Smith was also informed that this record was concealed in a hill not far distant; and that with it would be found a Urim and Thummim,[D] consisting of two stones fastened in silver bows attached to a breast-plate, by means of which the record could be translated through the power of God. The Prophet then beheld in a vision the hill where the plates were hidden.  [Footnote D: Those who would be informed concerning the Urim and Thummim and its use among the ancients, should consult the following scriptures: Ex. 28:30; Lev. 8:8; Deut. 33:8; Ezra 2:63; Neh. 7:65; Num. 17:21; I Sam. 28:6.]  When this vision was passed the angel quoted a number of ancient prophecies relating to the gathering of Israel in the last days, and the judgments of God upon the wicked, all of which he declared would soon be fulfilled.[E] The angel visited him three times during that same night, repeating to him each time the message he first announced.  [Footnote E: The passages quoted are as follows: Malachi, part of chapter 3. (most likely the first part); Malachi, chapter 4; Isaiah 11; Acts 3:22, 23; Joel 2:28-32.]  The next day Moroni again appeared to him when he was crossing a field, and announced to him once more the message of the night before, and instructed the youth to make a confidant of his father, Joseph Smith, Sen., and make known to him the visitations he had received and the things revealed, which the youth promptly and gladly did, and from that hour received consolation and encouragement from his father.  The same day, namely, 22nd of September, 1823, Joseph Smith went to the place where the record was deposited--called by Moroni, Cumorah--and there in a rude stone box, the crowning cover of which he could see above the surface of the hillside, he found the record, together "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/49526"],["title","The Missouri Persecutions (#2)"],["body","the Urim and Thummim.  Moroni appeared to him again while he was viewing the sacred treasure, and forbade him taking the plates from their place of concealment, as the time had not yet come for him to take possession of them. He was required to meet the angel at that place in one year from that time, and from year to year, until the time should come for the record to be given to him for translation.  These annual visits at Cumorah continued until the 22nd of September, 1827, when the plates were committed to his keeping with instructions to translate them. He received a strict commandment to show them to no man, except such as God would appoint to see them, and bear witness of their existence and the truth of what they contained; nor was he to have any other object in view in obtaining and translating the record than the glory of God and the establishment of his Church in the earth.  With the assistance of a man of the name of Martin Harris, and another of the name of Oliver Cowdery, the latter acting as his scribe, Joseph translated the record in about two years and a half, and published it at Palmyra, New York, early in the spring of 1830.  The stone box in which the record had been preserved, and the record itself, is thus described by Joseph Smith:   Convenient to the village of Manchester, Ontario County, New York,  stands a hill of considerable size, and the most elevated of any in  the neighborhood. On the west side of this hill, not far from the  top, under a stone of considerable size, lay the plates, deposited in  a stone box. This stone was thick and rounding in the middle on the  upper side, and thinner towards the edges, so that the middle part of  it was visible above the ground, but the edge all round was covered  with earth. Having removed the earth, and obtained a lever, which I  got fixed under the edge of the stone, and with a little exertion  raised it up, I looked in, and there indeed did I behold the plates,  the Urim and Thummim and the breast-plate, as stated by the messenger.  The box in which they lay was formed by laying stones together in  some kind of cement. In the bottom of the box were laid two stones  crossways of the box, and on these stones lay the plates, and the  other things with them.[F]  [Footnote F: Millennial Star, Supplement to Vol. 14, p.6.]  These records were engraven on plates which had the appearance of gold; each plate was six inches wide and eight inches long, and not quite so thick as common tin. They were filled with engravings, in Egyptian characters, and bound together in a volume as the leaves of a book, with three rings running through the whole. The volume was something near six inches in thickness, a part of which was sealed. The characters on the unsealed part were small, and beautifully engraved. The whole book exhibited many signs of antiquity in its construction and much skill in the art of engraving.[G]  [Footnote G: Letter to Mr. Wentworth.]  The following is a summary of this interesting record as given by the Prophet in his letter to Mr. Wentworth:   In this important and interesting book the history of ancient America  is unfolded, from its first settlement by a colony that came from  the Tower of Babel, at the confusion of languages, to the beginning  of the fifth century of the Christian era. We are informed by these  records that America in ancient times had been inhabited by two  distinct races of people. The first was called Jaredites and came  directly from the Tower of Babel. The second race came directly  from the city of Jerusalem, about six hundred years before Christ.  They were principally Israelites, of the descendants of Joseph. The  Jaredites were destroyed about the time that the Israelites came from  Jerusalem, who succeeded them in the inheritance of the country. The  principal nation of the second race fell in battle towards the close  of the fourth century (A.D.) The remnant are the Indians that now  inhabit this country. This book also tells us that our Savior made  his appearance upon this continent after his resurrection; that he  planted the gospel here in all its fullness, and richness, and power,  and blessing; that they had apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers and  evangelists; the same order, the same priesthood, the same ordinances,  gifts, powers and blessings, as were enjoyed on the eastern continent;  that the people were cut off in consequence of their transgressions;  that the last of their prophets who existed among them were commanded  to write an abridgment of their prophecies, history, etc., and to hide  it up in the earth, and that it should come forth and be united with  the Bible for the accomplishment of the purposes of God in the last  days.  The Book of Mormon was not brought forth without serious opposition. The commandment not to show the plates to anyone except those whom God should appoint to be witnesses of their existence and their truth, necessarily enjoined secrecy upon Joseph Smith, and involved more or less of mystery in his movements; and yet it became necessary for some to know of his having the records, or else how could he obtain the necessary assistance to translate them? These prohibitions upon the Prophet and the necessary secrecy they involved, gave rise to a perfect flood of misrepresentations and slanders; enemies pursued him at every turn; the vilest calumnies were circulated both with respect to himself and his family; they were charged with the grossest ignorance, superstition, idleness, and all things that go to the making of vicious and low characters; and yet it is evident from the testimony of those who personally knew them, that the Smiths, while poor, were nevertheless people of upright lives, kind neighbors, and good citizens. This is not said for the purpose of claiming for Joseph Smith exemption from many boyish follies, and the common weaknesses of humanity--the existence of these weaknesses, in fact, he himself freely admits and deplores; and as much has been made of his own admissions on that head, I think it proper that what he has said upon the subject should be given in full, and hence I republish here a letter of his to Oliver Cowdery which the Prophet wrote upon hearing that Cowdery, in 1834, was about to publish a series of letters on the subject of \"Early Scenes in the Church.\" Following is the letter:   _Oliver Cowdery:_   DEAR BROTHER: Having learned from the first number of the _Messenger  and Advocate,_ that you were not only about to \"give a history of the  rise and progress of the Church of the Latter-day Saints,\" but that  said history would necessarily embrace my life and character, I have  been induced to give you the time and place of my birth; as I have  learned that many of the opposers of those principles which I have  held forth to the world, profess a personal acquaintance with me,  though when in my presence, represent me to be another person in age,  education, and stature, from what I am.   I was born (according to the record of the same, kept by my parents)  in the town of Sharon, Windsor County, Vermont, on the 23rd of  December, 1805.   At the age of ten my father's family removed to Palmyra, New York,  where, and in the vicinity of which, I lived, or made it my place of  residence, until I was twenty-one; the latter part in the town of  Manchester.   During this time, as is common to most or all youths, I fell into many  vices and follies; but as my accusers are and have been forward to  accuse me of being guilty of gross and outrageous violations of the  peace and good order of the community, I take the occasion to remark  that, though as I have said above, \"as is common to most, or all,  youths, I fell into many vices and follies,\" I have not, neither can  it be sustained, in truth, been guilty of wronging or injuring any  man or society of men; and those imperfections to which I allude, and  for which I have often had occasion to lament, were a light, and too  often, vain mind, exhibiting a foolish and trifling conversation.   This being all, and the worst, that my accusers can substantiate  against my moral character, I wish to add that it is not without a  deep feeling of regret that I am thus called upon in answer to my own  conscience, to fulfill a duty I owe to myself, as well as to the cause  of truth, in making this public confession of my former uncircumspect  walk, and trifling conversation and more particularly, as I often  acted in violation of those holy precepts which I knew came from God.  But as the \"Articles and Covenants\" of this Church are plain upon  this particular point, I do not deem it important to proceed further.  I only add, that I do not, nor never have, pretended to be any other  than a man \"subject to passion,\" and liable, without the assisting  grace of the Savior, to deviate from that perfect path in which all  men are commanded to walk.   By giving the above a place in your valuable paper, you will confer a  lasting favor upon myself, as an individual, and, as I humbly hope,  subserve the cause of righteousness.   I am, with feelings of esteem, your fellow-laborer in the Gospel of  our Lord, JOSEPH SMITH.  It is clear from this letter that Joseph Smith, while acknowledging his imperfections, does not accuse himself of any dark crimes of a nature to disqualify him for his subsequently exalted station or the great work to which he was called. He goes no further than to confess to lightness and vanity of mind, resulting in \"a foolish and trifling conversation;\" but even that, on account of his quick conscience and innocent life, occasioned him much remorse.  While the Book of Mormon was in process of translation, namely, in May, 1829, the question of baptism came up between Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery. They repaired to the woods to inquire of the Lord concerning it, when an angel from heaven appeared to them and announced himself to be John the Baptist, of the New Testament, now raised from the"]]]
