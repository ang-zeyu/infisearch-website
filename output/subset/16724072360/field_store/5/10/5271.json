Only the forewoman in the funny hat showed signs of life, looking alertly at Chandler, at the judge, at the man next to her, around the auditorium. Maybe it was a good sign. At least she did not have the frozen in concrete, guilty-as-hell look of the others.  His attorney asked him the question he had been waiting for: \"Tell us, in your own words, what happened.\" Chandler opened his mouth, and paused. Curiously, he had forgotten what he wanted to say. He had rehearsed this moment again and again; but all that came out was:  \"I didn't do it. I mean, I did the acts, but I was possessed. That's all. Others have done worse, under the same circumstances, and been let off. Just as Fisher was acquitted for murdering the Learnards, as Draper got off after what he did to the Cline boy. As Jack Souther over there was let off after he murdered my own wife. They should be. They couldn't help themselves. Whatever this thing is that takes control, I know it can't be fought. My God, you can't even _try_ to fight it!\"  He was not getting through. The faces had not changed. The forewoman of the jury was now searching systematically through her pocketbook, taking each item out and examining it, putting it back and taking out another. But between times she looked at him and at least her expression wasn't hostile. He said, addressing her:  \"That's all there is to it. It wasn't me running my body. It was someone else. I swear it before all of you, and before God.\"  The prosecutor did not bother to question him.  Chandler went back to his seat and sat down and watched the next twenty minutes go by in the wink of an eye, rapid, rapid, they were in a hurry to shoot him. He could hardly believe that Judge Ellithorp could speak so fast, the jurymen rise and file out at a gallop, zip, whisk, and they were back again. Too fast! he cried silently, time had gone into high gear; but he knew that it was only his imagination. The twenty minutes had been a full twelve hundred seconds. And then time, as if to make amends, came to a stop, abrupt, brakes-on. The judge asked the jury for their verdict and it was an eternity before the forewoman arose.  She was beginning to look rather disheveled. Beaming at Chandler--_surely_ the woman was rather odd, it couldn't be just his imagination--she fumbled in her pocketbook for the slip of paper with the verdict. But she wore an expression of suppressed laughter.  \"I _knew_ I had it,\" she cried triumphantly and waved the slip above her head. \"Now, let's see.\" She held it before her eyes and squinted. \"Oh, yes. Judge, we the jury, and so forth and so on--\"  She paused to wink at Judge Ellithorp. An uncertain worried murmur welled up in the auditorium. \"All that junk, Judge,\" she explained, \"anyway, we unanimously--but _unanimously_, love!--find this son of a bitch innocent. Why,\" she giggled, \"we think he ought to get a medal, you know? I tell you what you do, love, you go right over and give him a big wet kiss and say you're sorry.\" She kept on talking, but no one heard. The murmur became a mass scream.  \"Stop, stop her!\" bawled the judge, dropping his glasses. \"Bailiff!\"  The scream became a word, in many voices chorused: _Possessed!_ And beyond doubt the woman was. The men around her hurled themselves away, as from leprosy among them, and then washed back like a lynch mob. She was giggling as they fell on her. \"Got a cigarette? No cigarettes in this lousy bag--oh.\" She screamed as they touched her, went limp and screamed again.  It was a different note this time, pure hysteria: \"I couldn't _stop_. Oh, _God_.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Chandler caught his lawyer by the arm and jerked him away from staring at the scene. All of a sudden he was alive again. \"You, damn it. Listen! The jury acquitted me, right?\"  The lawyer was startled. \"Don't be ridiculous. It's a clear case of--\"  \"Be a lawyer, man! You live on technicalities, don't you? Make this one work for me!\"  The attorney gave him a queer, thoughtful look, hesitated, shrugged and got to his feet. He had to shout to be heard. \"Your honor! I take it my client is free to go.\"  He made almost as much of a stir as the sobbing woman, but he outshouted the storm. \"The jury's verdict is on record. Granted there was an _apparent_ case of possession. Nevertheless--\"  Judge Ellithorp yelled back: \"No nonsense, you! Listen to me, young man--\"  The lawyer snapped, \"Permission to approach the bench.\"  \"Granted.\"  Chandler sat unable to move, watching the brief, stormy conference. It was painful to be coming back to life. It was agony to hope. At least, he thought detachedly, his lawyer was fighting for him; the prosecutor's face was a thundercloud.  The lawyer came back, with the expression of a man who has won a victory he did not expect, and did not want. \"Your last chance, Chandler. Change your plea to guilty.\"  \"But--\"  \"Don't push your luck, boy! The judge has agreed to accept a plea. They'll throw you out of town, of course. But you'll be alive.\" Chandler hesitated. \"Make up your mind! The best I can do otherwise is a mistrial, and that means you'll get convicted by another jury next week.\"  Chandler said, testing his luck: \"You're sure they'll keep their end of the bargain?\"  The lawyer shook his head, his expression that of a man who smells something unpleasant. \"Your honor! I ask you to discharge the jury. My client wishes to change his plea.\"  ... In the school's chemistry lab, an hour later, Chandler discovered that the lawyer had left out one little detail. Outside there was a sound of motors idling, the police car that would dump him at the town's limits; inside was a thin, hollow hiss. It was the sound of a Bunsen burner, and in its blue flame a crudely shaped iron changed slowly from cherry to orange to glowing straw. It had the shape of a letter \"H\".  \"H\" for \"hoaxer.\" The mark they were about to put on his forehead would be with him wherever he went and as long as he lived, which would probably not be long. \"H\" for \"hoaxer,\" so that a glance would show that he had been convicted of the worst offense of all.  No one spoke to him as the sheriff's man took the iron out of the fire, but three husky policemen held his arms while he screamed.   III  The pain was still burning when Chandler awoke the next day. He wished he had a bandage, but he didn't, and that was that.  He was in a freight car--had hopped it on the run at the yards, daring to sneak back into town long enough for that. He could not hope to hitchhike, with that mark on him. Anyway, hitchhiking was an invitation to trouble.  The railroads were safer--far safer than either cars or air transport, notoriously a lightning-rod attracting possession. Chandler was surprised when the train came crashing to a stop, each freight car smashing against the couplings of the one ahead, the engine jolting forward and stopping again.  Then there was silence. It endured.  Chandler, who had been slowly waking after a night of very little sleep, sat up against the wall of the boxcar and wondered what was wrong.  It seemed remiss to start a day without signing the Cross or hearing a few exorcismal verses. It seemed to be mid-morning, time for work to be beginning at the plant. The lab men would be streaming in, their amulets examined at the door. The chaplains would be wandering about, ready to pray a possessing spirit out. Chandler, who kept an open mind, had considerable doubt of the effectiveness of all the amulets and spells--certainly they had not kept him from a brutal rape--but he felt uneasy without them.... The train still was not moving. In the silence he could hear the distant huffing of the engine.  He went to the door, supporting himself with one hand on the wooden wall, and looked out.  The tracks followed the roll of a river, their bed a few feet higher than an empty three-lane highway, which in turn was a dozen feet above the water. As he looked out the engine brayed twice. The train jolted uncertainly, then stopped again.  Then there was a very long time when nothing happened at all.  From Chandler's car he could not see the engine. He was on the convex of the curve, and the other door of the car was sealed. He did not need to see it to know that something was wrong. There should have been a brakeman running with a flare to ward off other trains; but there was not. There should have been a station, or at least a water tank, to account for the stop in the first place. There was not. Something had gone wrong, and Chandler knew what it was. Not the details, but the central fact that lay behind this and behind almost everything that went wrong these days.  The engineer was possessed. It had to be that.  Yet it was odd, he thought, as odd as his own trouble. He had chosen this car with care. It contained eight refrigerator cars full of pharmaceuticals, and if anything was known about the laws governing possession, as his lawyer had told him, it was that such things were almost never interfered with.  Chandler jumped down to the roadbed, slipped on the crushed rock and almost fell. He had forgotten the wound on his forehead. He clutched the sill of the car door, where an ankh and fleur-de-lis had been chalked to ward off demons, until the sudden rush of blood subsided and the pain began to relent. After a moment he walked gingerly to the end of the car, slipped between the cars, dodged the couplers and climbed the ladder to its roof.  It was a warm, bright, silent day. Nothing moved. From his height he could see the Diesel at the front of the train and the caboose at its rear. No people. The train was halted a quarter-mile from where the tracks swooped across the river on a suspension bridge. Away from the river, the side of the tracks that had been hidden from him before, was an uneven rock cut and, above it, the slope of a mountain.  By looking carefully he could spot the signs of a number of homes within half a mile or so--the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51809"],["title","Survival Kit (#1)"],["body","-eyed man, I will guide you. Oh, there never was a guide like Mooney--not when a guide's fee can run so high. But when you are where you want to go, then we'll discuss the price....  A hacksaw, he schemed, and a Geiger counter. He had worn his fingers raw trying to find the little button or knob that Harse had used to open them. All right, he was licked there. But there were more ways than one to open a cat's eye.  A hacksaw. A Geiger counter. And, Mooney speculated drowsily, maybe a gun, if the pale-eyed man got tough.  Mooney fell asleep in joy and anticipation for the first time in more than a dozen years.         *       *       *       *       *  It was bright the next morning. Bright and very cold.  \"Look alive!\" Mooney said to the pale-eyed man, shivering. It had been a long walk from Uncle Lester's house to the bridge, in that ripping, shuddering wind that came in off the Atlantic.  Harse got up off his knees, from where he had been examining the asphalt pavement under the snow. He stood erect beside Mooney, while Mooney put on an egg-sucking smile and aimed his thumb down the road.  The station wagon he had spotted seemed to snarl and pick up speed as it whirled past them onto the bridge.  \"I hope you skid into a ditch!\" Mooney bawled into the icy air. He was in a fury. There was a bus line that went where they wanted to go. A warm, comfortable bus that would stop for them if they signaled, that would drop them just where they wanted to be, to convert one of Harse's ball-bearings into money. The gold one, Mooney planned. Not the diamond, not the pearl. Just a few dollars was all they wanted, in this Jersey shore area where the towns were small and the gossip big. Just the price of fare into New York, where they could make their way to Tiffany's.  But the bus cost thirty-five cents apiece. Total, seventy cents. Which they didn't have.  \"Here comes another. Car?\"  Mooney dragged back the corners of his lips into another smile and held out his thumb.  It was a panel truck, light blue, with the sides lettered: _Chris's Delicatessen. Free Deliveries._ The driver slowed up, looked them over and stopped. He leaned toward the right-hand window.  He called: \"I can take you far's Red Ba--\"  He got a good look at Mooney's companion then and swallowed. Harse had put on an overcoat because Mooney insisted on it and he wore a hat because Mooney had told him flatly there would be trouble and questions if he didn't. But he hadn't taken off his own silvery leotard, which peeped through between neck and hat and where the coat flapped open.  \"--ank,\" finished the driver thoughtfully.  Mooney didn't give him a chance to change his mind. \"Red Bank is just where we want to go. Come on!\" Already he had his hand on the door. He jumped in, made room for Harse, reached over him and slammed the door.  \"Thank you very much,\" he said chattily to the driver. \"Cold morning, isn't it? And that was some storm last night. Say, we really do appreciate this. Anywhere in Red Bank will be all right to drop us, anywhere at all.\"  He leaned forward slightly, just enough to keep the driver from being able to get a really good look at his other passenger.  It would have gone all right, it really would, except that just past Fair Haven, Harse suddenly announced: \"It is the time for me to. Eat?\"         *       *       *       *       *  He snip-snapped something around the edges of the gleaming sort of dispatch case, which opened. Mooney, peering over his shoulder, caught glimpses of shiny things and spinning things and things that seemed to glow. So did the driver.  \"Hey,\" he said, interested, \"what've you got there?\"  \"My business,\" said Harse, calmly and crushingly.  The driver blinked. He opened his mouth, and then he shut it again, and his neck became rather red.  Mooney said rapidly: \"Say, isn't there--uh--isn't there a lot of snow?\" He feigned fascination with the snow on the road, leaning forward until his face was nearly at the frosty windshield. \"My gosh, I've never seen the road so snowy!\"  Beside him, Harse was methodically taking things out of other things. A little cylinder popped open and began to steam; he put it to his lips and drank. A cube the size of a fist opened up at one end and little pellets dropped out into a cup. Harse picked a couple up and began to chew them. A flat, round object the shape of a cafeteria pie flipped open and something gray and doughy appeared--  \"Holy heaven!\"  Mooney's face slammed into the windshield as the driver tramped on his brakes. Not that Mooney could really blame him. The smell from that doughy mass could hardly be believed; and what made it retchingly worse was that Harse was eating it with a pearly small spoon.  The driver said complainingly: \"Out! Out, you guys! I don't mind giving you a lift, but I've got hard rolls in the back of the truck and that smell's going to--Out! You heard me!\"  \"Oh,\" said Harse, tasting happily. \"No.\"  \"_No?_\" roared the driver. \"Now listen! I don't have to take any lip from hitchhikers! I don't have to--\"  \"One moment,\" said Harse. \"Please.\" Without hurry and without delay, beaming absently at the driver, he reached into the silvery case again. Snip, snippety-snap; a jointed metal thing wriggled and snicked into place. And Harse, still beaming, pointed it at the driver.  Pale blue light and a faint whine.  It was a good thing the truck was halted, because the whining blue light reached diffidently out and embraced the driver; and then there was no driver. There was nothing. He was gone, beyond the reach of any further lip from hitchhikers.   III  So there was Mooney, driving a stolen panel truck, Mooney the bankrupt, Mooney the ne'er-do-well, and now Mooney the accomplice murderer. Or so he thought, though the pale-eyed man had laughed like a panther when he'd asked.  He rehearsed little speeches all the day down U.S. One, Mooney did, and they all began: \"Your Honor, I didn't know--\"  Well, he hadn't. How could a man like Mooney know that Harse was so bereft of human compassion as to snuff out a life for the sake of finishing his lunch in peace? And what could Mooney have done about it, without drawing the diffident blue glow to himself? No, Your Honor, really, Your Honor, he took me by surprise....  But by the time they ditched the stolen car, nearly dry of gas, at the Hoboken ferry, Mooney had begun to get his nerve back. In fact, he was beginning to perceive that in that glittering silvery dispatch case that Harse hugged to him were treasures that might do wonders for a smart man unjustly dogged by hard times. The wampum alone! But beyond the wampum, the other good things that might in time be worth more than any amount of mere money.  There was that weapon. Mooney cast a glance at Harse, blank-eyed and relaxed, very much disinterested in the crowds of commuters on the ferry.  Nobody in all that crowd would believe that Harse could pull out a little jointed metal thing and push a button and make any one of them cease to exist. Nobody would believe it--not even a jury. Corpus delicti, body of evidence--why, there would _be_ no evidence! It was a simple, workable, foolproof way of getting any desired number of people out of the way without fuss, muss or bother--and couldn't a smart but misfortunate man like Mooney do wonders by selectively removing those persons who stood as obstacles in his path?  And there would be more, much, much more. The thing to do, Mooney schemed, was to find out just what Harse had in that kit and how to work it; and then--who could know, perhaps Harse would himself find the diffident blue light reaching out for him before the intersection of Brooklyn and December twenty-sixth?  Mooney probed.  \"Ah,\" laughed Harse. \"Ho! I perceive what you want. You think perhaps there is something you can use in my survival kit.\"  \"All right, Harse,\" Mooney said submissively, but he did have reservations.  First, it was important to find out just what was in the kit. After that--  Well, even a man from the future had to sleep.         *       *       *       *       *  Mooney was in a roaring rage. How dared the Government stick its bureaucratic nose into a simple transaction of citizens! But it turned out to be astonishingly hard to turn Harse's wampum into money. The first jeweler asked crudely threatening questions about an emerald the size of the ball of his thumb; the second quoted chapter and verse on the laws governing possession of gold. Finally they found a pawnbroker, who knowingly accepted a diamond that might have been worth a fortune; and when they took his first offer of a thousand dollars, the pawnbroker's suspicions were confirmed. Mooney dragged Harse away from there fast.  But they did have a thousand dollars.  As the cab took them across town, Mooney simmered down; and by the time they reached the other side, he was entirely content. What was a fortune more or less to a man who very nearly owned some of the secrets of the future?  He sat up, lit a cigarette, waved an arm and said expansively to Harse: \"Our new home.\"  The pale-eyed man took a glowing little affair with eyepieces away from in front of his eyes.  \"Ah,\" he said. \"So.\"  It was quite an attractive hotel, Mooney thought judiciously. It did a lot to take away the sting of those sordidly avaricious jewelers. The lobby was an impressively close approximation of a cathedral and the bellboys looked smart and able.  Harse made an asthmatic sound. \"What is. That?\" He was pointing at a group of men standing in jovial amusement around the entrance to the hotel's grand ballroom, just off the lobby. They wore purple harem pants and floppy green hats, and every one of them carried a silver-paper imitation of a scimitar.  Mooney chuckled in a superior way. \"You aren't up on our local customs, are you? That's a convention, Harse. They dress up that way because they belong to a lodge. A lodge is a kind of fraternal organization. A fraternal organization is--\"  Harse said abruptly:"]]]
