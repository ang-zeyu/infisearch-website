They landed in the chairs, and Johnnie ran and picked them both up.  Altogether, lying on the best parlor sofa was not very restful; and as the day went on, and the sun beating on the blindless windows made the room hotter, Elsie grew continually more and more feverish and homesick and disconsolate.  Meanwhile Johnnie was kept in occupation by Mrs. Worrett, who had got the idea firmly fixed in her mind, that the chief joy of a child's life was to chase chickens.  Whenever a hen fluttered past the kitchen door, which was about once in three minutes, she would cry: \"Here, Johnnie, here's another chicken for you to chase;\" and poor Johnnie would feel obliged to dash out into the sun.  Being a very polite little girl, she did not like to say to Mrs. Worrett that running in the heat was disagreeable: so by dinner-time she was thoroughly tired out, and would have been cross if she had known how; but she didn't-- Johnnie was never cross.  After dinner it was even worse; for the sun was hotter, and the chickens, who didn't mind sun, seemed to be walking all the time.  \"Hurry, Johnnie, here's another,\" came so constantly, that at last Elsie grew desperate, got up, and went to the kitchen with a languid appeal: \"Please, Mrs. Worrett, won't you let Johnnie stay by me, because my head aches so hard?\"  After that, Johnnie had a rest; for Mrs. Worrett was the kindest of women, and had no idea that she was not amusing her little guest in the most delightful manner.  A little before six, Elsie's head felt better; and she and Johnnie put on their hats, and went for a walk in the garden.  There was not much to see: beds of vegetables,--a few currant bushes,--that was all. Elsie was leaning against a paling, and trying to make out why the Worrett house had that queer tiptoe expression, when a sudden loud grunt startled her, and something touched the top of her head.  She turned, and there was an enormous pig, standing on his hind legs, on the other side of the paling.  He was taller than Elsie, as he stood thus, and it was his cold nose which had touched her head.  Somehow, appearing in this unexpected way, he seemed to the children like some dreadful wild beast.  They screamed with fright, and fled to the house, from which Elsie never ventured to stir again during their visit. John chased chickens at intervals, but it was a doubtful pleasure; and all the time she kept a wary eye on the distant pig.  That evening, while Mrs. Worrett slept and Mr. Worrett smoked outside the door, Elsie felt so very miserable that she broke down altogether. She put her head in Johnnie's lap, as they sat together in the darkest corner of the room, and sobbed and cried, making as little noise as she possibly could.  Johnnie comforted her with soft pats and strokings; but did not dare to say a word, for fear Mrs. Worrett should wake up and find them out.  When the morning came, Elsie's one thought was, would Alexander come for them in the afternoon?  All day she watched the clock and the road with feverish anxiety.  Oh! if papa had changed his mind,--had decided to let them stay for a week at Conic Section,--what should she do?  It was just possible to worry through and keep alive till afternoon, she thought; but if they were forced to spend another night in that feather-bed, with those mosquitoes, hearing the blue shad rattle and quiver hour after hour,--she should die, she was sure she should die!  But Elsie was not called upon to die, or even to discover how easy it is to survive a little discomfort.  About five, her anxious watch was rewarded by the appearance of a cloud of dust, out of which presently emerged old Whitey's ears and the top of the well-known carryall. They stopped at the gate.  There was Alexander, brisk and smiling, very glad to see his \"little misses\" again, and to find them so glad to go home.  Mrs. Worrett, however, did not discover that they were glad; no indeed!  Elsie and John were much too polite for that.  They thanked the old lady, and said good-by so prettily that, after they were gone, she told Mr. Worrett that it hadn't been a bit of trouble having them there, and she hoped they would come again; they enjoyed every thing so much; only it was a pity that Elsie looked so peaked. And at that very moment Elsie was sitting on the floor of the carryall, with her head in John's lap, crying and sobbing for joy that the visit was over and that she was on the way home.  \"If only I live to get there,\" she said, \"I'll never, no, never, go into the country again!\" which was silly enough; but we must forgive her because she was half sick.  Ah, how charming home did look, with the family grouped in the shady porch, Katy in her white wrapper, Clover with rose-buds in her belt, and everybody ready to welcome and pet the little absentees!  There was much hugging and kissing, and much to tell of what had happened in the two days: how a letter had come from Cousin Helen; how Daisy White had four kittens as white as herself; how Dorry had finished his water-wheel,--a wheel which turned in the bath-tub, and was \"really ingenious,\" papa said; and Phil had \"swapped\" one of his bantam chicks for on of Eugene Slack's Bramapootras.  It was not till they were all seated round the tea-table that anybody demanded an account of the visit.  Elsie felt this a relief, and was just thinking how delicious every thing was, from the sliced peaches to the clinking ice in the milk-pitcher, when papa put the dreaded question,--  \"Well, Elsie, so you decided to come, after all.  How was it?  Why didn't you stay your week out?  You look pale, it seems to me.  Have you been enjoying yourself too much?  Tell us all about it.\"  Elsie looked at papa, and papa looked at Elsie.  Dr. Carr's eyes twinkled just a little, but otherwise he was perfectly grave.  Elsie began to speak, then to laugh, then to cry, and the explanation, when it came, was given in a mingled burst of all three.  \"O papa, it was horrid!  That is, Mrs. Worrett was just as kind as could be, but so fat; and oh, such a pig!  I never imagined such a pig!  And the calico on that horrid sofa was so slippery that I rolled off five times, and once I hurt myself real badly.  And we had a feather-bed; and I was so homesick that I cried all the evening.\"  \"That must have been gratifying to Mrs. Worrett,\" put in Dr. Carr.  \"Oh! she didn't know it, papa.  She was asleep, and snoring so that nobody could hear.  And the flies!--such flies, Katy!--and the mosquitoes, and our window wouldn't open till I put in a nail.  I am so glad to get home!  I never want to go into the country again, never, never!  Oh, if Alexander hadn't come!--why, Clover, what are you laughing for?  And Dorry,--I think it's very unkind,\" and Elsie ran to Katy, hid her face, and began to cry.  \"Never mind, darling, they didn't mean to be unkind.  Papa, her hands are quite hot; you must give her something.\"  Katy's voice shook a little; but she would not hurt Elsie's feeling by showing that she was amused.  Papa gave Elsie \"something\" before she went to bed,-- a very mild dose I fancy; for doctors' little girls, as a general rule, do not take medicine, and next day she was much better.  As the adventures of the Conic Section visit leaked out bit by bit, the family laughed till it seemed as if they would never stop.  Phil was forever enacting the pig, standing on his triumphant hind legs, and patting Elsie's head with his nose; and many and many a time, \"It will end like your visit to Mrs. Worrett,\" proved a useful check when Elsie was in a self-willed mood and bent on some scheme which for the moment struck her as delightful.  For one of the good things about our childish mistakes is, that each one teaches us something; and so, blundering on, we grow wiser, till, when the time comes, we are ready to take our places among the wonderful grown-up people who never make mistakes.     CHAPTER II.  A NEW YEAR AND A NEW PLAN.   When summer lingers on into October, it often seems as if winter, anxious to catch a glimpse of her, hurries a little; and so people are cheated out of their autumn.  It was so that year.  Almost as soon as it ceased to be hot it began to be cold.  The leaves, instead of drifting away in soft, dying colors, like sunset clouds, turned yellow all at once; and were whirled off the trees in a single gusty night, leaving every thing bare and desolate.  Thanksgiving came; and before the smell of the turkey was fairly out of the house, it was time to hang up stockings and dress the Christmas tree.  They had a tree that year in honor of Katy's being downstairs.  Cecy, who had gone away to boarding-school, came home; and it was all delightful, except that the days flew too fast.  Clover said it seemed to her very queer that there was so much less time than usual in the world. She couldn't imagine what had become of it: there used to be plenty. And she was certain that Dorry must have been tinkering all the clocks,--they struck so often.  It was just after New Year that Dr. Carr walked in one day with a letter in his hand, and remarked: \"Mr. and Mrs. Page are coming to stay with us.\"  \"Mr. and Mrs. Page,\" repeated Katy; \"who are they, papa?  Did I ever see them?\"  \"Once, when you were four years old, and Elsie a baby.  Of chouse you don't remember it.\"  \"But who are they, papa?\"  \"Mrs. Page was your dear mother's second cousin; and at one time she lived in your grandfather's family, and was like a sister to mamma and Uncle Charles.  It is a good many years since I have seen her.  Mr. Page is a railroad engineer.  He is coming this way on business, and they will stop for a few days with us.  Your Cousin Olivia writes that she is anxious to see all you children.  Have every thing as nice as you can, Katy.\"  \"Of course, I will.  What day are the coming?\"  \"Thursday,--"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51414"],["title","...So They Baked a Cake (#1)"],["body","tolerate. He wasn't as sour on humanity as I, but he granted me the right to my opinions, which was something.  \"God, yes!\" he said. \"Skipper tell you about the time-error?\"  I said, \"Yes, but what's there to be sad about? You don't mind that part, do you?\" To my knowledge, Mac hadn't left anything behind but his dirty laundry.  Hulbert was in his mid-thirties, slender, balding and normally as cheerful and stupidly optimistic as they come. Now he looked worse off than Larson.  \"Yeah, I mind that,\" he said kind of resentfully. \"I thought we'd have more time to--sort of get used to the idea of--well, outgrowing our generation. But think, by now many of my older buddies will be dead. A dozen World Series will be over. Who knows, maybe there's a war going on back there?\"  Of all the morbid nonsense. Yearning for the obituary column, the sports page and the headlines. But then people are rarely sensible when something disturbs their tidy little universe that they take for granted.  It was a little terrifying, though, staring out into that smothering lamp-black. We were moving so fast and living so slowly that even the light-waves from the galaxies toward which we moved had disappeared. We were reversing the \"redshift\" effect of receding light sources. We approached the stars before us at such a velocity that their light impinged at a rate above the visible violet spectrum.  Mac blurted out, \"It will never work out.\"  \"What won't?\"  \"Colonization. Not at these unholy distances, even if we do find an earth-type planet or two. People won't leave everything behind them like this. I--I feel cut off. Something's gone, everything, everybody we knew back there. It's terrible to consider!\"         *       *       *       *       *  I sat down beside him, stared out into the India-ink and faced a few over-due realities myself. Our chances of finding a habitable planet were remote. Finding intelligent life on it was even more unlikely. That such life would resemble men, was so improbable that the odds in favor were virtually nonexistent.  So--what had I really to look forward to? A quick survey of the star-system in the company of these nincompoop ideo-savants, then a return to a civilization of complete strangers--a culture in which we would all be anachronisms, almost a century behind the times.  A parade of faces began peering at me out of the darkness. There was Bess with the golden hair, and Carol and petite Annette--and Cliff, my red-headed old room-mate who knew how to charcoal-broil a steak--and our bachelor apartment with the battered old teevee set and my collection of books and pipes, and there was my out-board jet up on lovely Lake Vermillion where a man could still catch a fat pike.  What would it be like when we got back? More people, less food, tighter rationing, crowding beyond conception.  Hell!  When the rest of the crew learned of our sharply-revised estimated time of arrival they came down with the same emotional cramps afflicting Larson and Hulbert. It was sickening, a bunch of so-called mature technicians and scientists moping around like a barracks full of drafted rookies, matching miniature billfold photos of cuties that were now approaching crone-hood. The whole venture had become a tragic affair overnight, and for the next few days all thoughts turned backward.  So nobody was remotely prepared for what happened. They were even unprepared to think straight--with their heads instead of their hearts. And Larson was worst of all!  On the last day Larson eased off our 1800-mile-per-second velocity, and as the stars started showing again, shifting from faint violet down into the more cheerful spectrum, spirits aboard began lifting a little.         *       *       *       *       *  I was in the control-room with Larson and Mac when we got our first inkling. Mac was fooling with the electronic search gear, sweeping for planets, when he gave a yip and pointed a jabbing finger at the scope.  \"Audio,\" he stammered. \"Look at that!\" He lengthened the sweep and the jumble of vertical lines spread out like a picket fence made of rubber.  \"A carrier wave with audio modulation,\" he said with disbelief all over his face.  Larson remained calm. \"I hear you, lad. Don't shout.\" He studied the signal and frowned deeply. \"It's faint, but you can get a fix.\"  As they played with the instruments I looked forward through the green shield that protected us from Alpha C's heavy radiation. Our destination star was now a brilliant blob dominating our piece of heaven. It was a difficult thing to grasp that we had travelled almost 26 trillion miles--in five days, ship's time.  Mac said, \"It's a planet, sure enough, but that audio--\"  Larson snapped, \"Forget the audio! Give me a bearing, and let's be getting on course. That may be the only planet in the system, and I don't want to lose it.\"  His arms pumped and his big hands pawed at the controls as he brought the inertialess drive into manual manipulations.  For the next few, tense hours we stalked the planet at a discreetly low velocity. When his navigation problem was complete and we were on a slow approach orbit, Mac began playing with the communication rig again.  The ship's intercom was cut in, and we had to chase people out as excitement mounted over our discovery. Finally, when his elbow had been jostled once too often, Larson ordered the control room cleared of all hands but Hulbert and me.  When we were alone Larson said, \"This is fantastic.\"  Mac's face was tied into an amazed scowl, too, as he studied the feeble little patterns on his wave analyzer. \"You said it,\" he breathed. \"We've got ourselves a sweet little earth-type planet, if we can believe the spectro, and unless I'm stark space-happy, there's something or somebody down there beaming a broadcast smack in our direction, following us around like the string on a yo-yo.\"  \"How do you figure that?\" Larson wanted to know.  Mac replied, \"At this distance the field strength is too strong for anything but a beamed transmission. Mister, _they have us bracketed_.\"  Mac swung to the panel on his left and cut in the communication circuit. \"It's strong enough to listen to, now. Let's see what kind of gibberish we can wring out of that carrier wave.\"  He threw a couple of switches and hunted for the exact frequency. A whisper and a rustle of the carrier brushed the speaker. Mac centered in and turned up the volume.  Then even I sucked air. A voice issued from the sound-cone. A man's voice: \"--lcome to New Columbia. Welcome, _Albert E._ Come in, please. Welcome to New Columbia. Welcome, _Albert E._ Come in please.\"         *       *       *       *       *  It repeated over and over. Larson let his breath go first with a nervous snort. Mac and Larson both looked at me as if maybe I had something to do with it. Hands trembling, Mac picked up the microphone and reached for the transmitter switch. Larson grabbed the mike from his hand. \"Not so fast, dammit!\"  \"But they know we're up here,\" Mac protested. \"They even know the name of our ship!\"  \"And our language,\" I added. I wasn't bored any more.  Larson nodded slowly. \"What kind of devilish intelligence have we run into? I need time--to think.\"  The way he said it sent a cold draught down my spine, and then my imagination started catching up to his. At our rate of approach to the star system, how could any living being have had time to sense our presence, pick our brains to learn our ship's name, our language, master our method of communication, contrive a transmitter and get on the air?  The magnitude of the accomplishment sent the importance of our little triumph of space travel tumbling into a cocked limbo of insignificance.  For a moment I considered the old curvature of space concept. Could we have somehow doubled back--completing a mystic circle? Was that old Sol up there burning through our green shield? What a laugh that would be! The mental giants of our times backtracking and circling like a tenderfoot lost in the woods on Lake Minnetonka.  Mac cut off the transmitter reluctantly, but he said, \"Yeah, I guess I see what you mean, skipper.\" Larson got to his feet and paced the crowded wedge of space, punching a fist into his other hand with meaty slaps.  He stopped and listened to the soft muttering of the speaker and shook his head. \"It makes no sense. It's impossible. Utterly impossible!\"  The man's voice from the planet implacably continued repeating the message--no trace of an accent, nothing to suggest an alien origin in its tone, pitch or enunciation.  Perhaps that's what threw Larson so hard. If there had been the faintest taint of other worldliness about it, I think he'd have hauled stakes and gotten us out of there. But the song of the siren was too powerful--the irresistible mental image of a fellow human out here in the bottom of space was salt in the bleeding wounds of Larson's loneliness.  He stared out where the planet must be, some million miles before us. Suddenly the tenseness relaxed from his face and he got the damndest expression of mixed incredulity, hopefulness and sorrow. Tears began welling from his eyes and streaming down the rugged contours of his cheeks.  It didn't add. Nor could I reason a motive for his laconic command: \"Intersection orbit, Mr. Hulbert. We'll take her down,\" he said quietly. That was all. He hunched over the control board and moved things according to Mac's computations.         *       *       *       *       *  Soon I could make out the planet. We came in from an obtuse angle with its sun, so it showed first as a crescent of pale, green silver. Then it filled the viewing dome, and Mac began working the homing equipment. \"May I acknowledge their message now, skipper?\"  Larson shook his head with compressed lips.  \"But if we are going in anyway--\" Mac argued.  \"No!\" Larson exploded. Then his voice softened. \"I think I know the mystery of the voice,\" he said. \"It must be, it must be! But if it isn't--if I'm wrong--God alone "]]]
