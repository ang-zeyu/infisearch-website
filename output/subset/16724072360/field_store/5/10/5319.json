Oh, Mr. Fairfield, DO say yes! Coax him to, won't you, Mrs. Fairfield! Oh, I can't tell you,--I daren't! I just KNOW you won't do it! Oh, Patty, do,--DO!\"  Impetuous Mona had swayed out of the swing in her eagerness, and was now kneeling by Patty's side, stroking her hand, and gazing into her face with imploring eyes.  \"Mona Galbraith,\" said Patty, laughing, \"are you rehearsing for melodrama, or what? For, if so, you don't know your lines, and you're 'way off on your gestures, and--and, as a whole, your act is not convincing.\"  \"Oh, don't say that, Patty!\" exclaimed Mona, laughing herself. \"ANYTHING but that! It must be convincing,--it must,--it MUST!\"  \"Is it meant for a roaring farce?\" asked Mr. Fairfield, politely, \"or merely high comedy?\"  \"I think it's a problem play,\" said Nan, laughing anew at the excited visitor, who had returned to the swing, and was vigorously pushing herself back and forth with her slippered toe.  \"Let me help you, Mona,\" said Mr. Fairfield, kindly. \"Is it something you have to tell us,--or ask us?\"  \"Yes, sir, yes! That's it!\"  \"Well, tell us, then. But take your time and tell us quietly. Then you won't get incoherent.\"  The quiet friendliness of his tones seemed to reassure the girl, and letting the swing stand still, Mona began:  \"You see, Mr. Fairfield,--and Mrs. Fairfield, my father is going to Europe next week. It's on a business trip, and he only just found out that he had to go. He will take me with him if I want to go, but I don't! So I proposed a plan to him instead of that, which he thinks is fine. And,--and, I want to know what you think about it.\"  \"We will probably approve of it, if your father does,\" said Nan, helpfully.  \"Well--it's just this. For me to stay at home, and keep our house open, and have Patty stay there with me, instead of her going to the mountains with you.\"  \"You and Patty stay there alone!\" exclaimed Mr. Fairfield.  \"No, sir; not alone. Father would ask his sister, my Aunt Adelaide, to stay with us, as chaperon. She's a lovely lady, and she'd be glad to come.\"  \"Well, I don't know,--I don't know,\" said Mr. Fairfield. \"I'm not sure I could go off and leave Patty with strangers.\"  \"But I'm not a stranger,\" said Mona, \"and Aunt Adelaide won't be, as soon as you know her. I haven't seen her myself for some years, but she's a lovely, sweet character,--everybody says so. And then, you see, we wouldn't have to close up our house, and Patty wouldn't have to leave Spring Beach,--and, oh, we could have lovely times!\"  \"How long will your father be gone?\"  \"Two months. August and September. He would rather take me with him, but he said if you all agreed to my plan, he would do so, too.\"  \"Well, it's a surprise,\" said Mr. Fairfield, \"and we'll have to think it over, and talk it over. How does it strike you, Patty?\"  Patty considered. It was her habit to decide quickly, but this was a case with several sides to be looked at. Yet, of course, it must be decided at once, for Mr. Galbraith must have time to make his preparations.  Patty's heart jumped with joy at the thought of staying at Spring Beach instead of going to the mountains. But--the joy was a little dampened at the idea of staying with Mona, and not at \"The Pebbles.\"  \"Why can't we both stay here?\" she said at last. \"Let Mona visit me here, and let her aunt chaperon us just the same.\"  \"Oh, no,\" Mona said. \"I know father wouldn't consent to that. You see, it's a great undertaking to close up our big place, and find homes for the servants, and look after the horses and gardens and all that, just for two months. Father was relieved at the thought of just walking off and leaving it all in charge of Aunt Adelaide. And then, we could have so much more room there, you know--\" Mona paused, blushing. She did not want to imply that \"Red Chimneys\" was a grandly appointed mansion, while \"The Pebbles\" was only a pretty cottage, but that was what she meant.  \"Yes, I know,\" said Nan, kindly helping her out. \"You have such immense grounds, and luxuries of all sorts. Why, your place is a Pleasure Park of itself, with the pond and tennis court, and fountains and grottoes and all such things.\"  \"Yes, it is a lovely summer place,\" said Mona, earnestly, \"and I should do everything I could to make Patty happy there. I know how much she wants to stay at Spring Beach, and it seemed such a satisfactory plan all round.\"  Patty was still thinking. But, by this time, she was wondering if she were really a selfish, disagreeable snob or not. For, the truth was, Patty did not entirely like Mona, though she had grown to like her much better than at first. Nor did she like Mona's home, with its ostentatiously expensive appointments, both indoors and out. And yet, it was exceedingly comfortable and luxurious, and Patty knew she could do exactly as she chose in every respect.  But, again, Patty was a favourite in Spring Beach society, and Mona was not. This might cause complications in the matter of invitations to entertainments. But Patty knew this would mostly redound to Mona's benefit. She would be asked on Patty's account to places where otherwise she would not have been invited. And Patty well knew SHE would be left out of nothing just because she was visiting Mona.  And yet, to accept her hospitality for two months meant to acknowledge her as an intimate friend,--a chosen companion. Was it quite honest to do this when, privately, Patty disapproved of many of Mona's ways and tastes? Then, it occurred to Patty that Mr. Hepworth had urged her to do what she could to help Mona,--to improve her manners, her dress, her tastes. Patty jumped at this idea, and then as suddenly paused to scrutinise her own motives, and make sure she was not pretending to herself that she did for Mona's sake what she was really doing for her own. But being quick at decisions, she saw at once that it was about evenly divided. She was willing, if she could, to help Mona in any way, and she felt that this justified her in accepting the offered hospitality of one whom she couldn't emulate.  Mr. Fairfield watched Patty's face closely, and knew pretty well what sort of a mental controversy she was holding with herself. He was not surprised when she said at last:  \"Well, so far as I have a voice in this matter, I'd like to go. I think it's very kind of Mona to ask me, and I'd try not to be a troublesome visitor. You know, Father Fairfield, how much I would rather stay in Spring Beach than go to the mountains. And I suppose I could take my motor-car to Mona's with me.\"  \"Yes, of course,\" Mona said. \"And father says if I don't go to Europe, he'll buy me a runabout just like yours, and we can have lovely times going out together.\"  \"Would your aunt come at once?\" asked Nan, who wanted to know more about the chaperon who would have Patty in charge.  \"Yes, father will send for her as soon as we decide. But you know, Mrs. Fairfield, I should keep house, as I always do, and Aunt Adelaide would only be with us in the cause of propriety.\"  Nan smiled at the thought of Mona's housekeeping, for \"Red Chimneys\" was so liberally provided with servants that Mona's duties consisted mainly in mentioning her favourite dishes to the cook.  \"Are you sure you could behave yourself, Patty?\" asked her father, teasingly, \"without either Nan or myself to keep you in order?\"  \"Oh, yes,\" said Patty, drawing down the corners of her mouth demurely. \"In fact, as I should be on my own responsibility, I'd have to be even more careful of my manners than I am at home.\"  Mr. Fairfield sighed a little. \"Well, Puss,\" he said, \"I really wanted you with us on our trip, but as you'd rather stay here, and as this way seems providentially opened for you, I can only say you may accept Mona's invitation if you choose.\"  \"Then I DO choose, you dear old Daddy!\" cried Patty, making a rush for her father, and, seating herself on the arm of his chair, she patted his head, while she told him how glad she was of his consent. \"For,\" she said, \"I made up my mind not to coax. If you didn't agree readily, I was going to abide by your wishes, without a murmur.\"  \"Oh, what a goody-girl!\" said Mr. Fairfield, laughing. \"Now, you see, Virtue is its own reward.\"  \"And I'm SO glad!\" Mona declared, fervently. \"Oh, Patty, we'll have perfectly elegant times! I was so afraid you wouldn't WANT to come to stay with me.\"  \"Oh, yes, I do,\" said Patty, \"but I warn you I'm a self-willed young person, and if I insist on having my own way, what are you going to do?\"  \"Let you have it,\" said Mona, promptly. \"Your way is always better than mine.\"  \"But suppose you two quarrel,\" said Mr. Fairfield, \"what can you do then? Patty will have nowhere to go.\"  \"Oh, we won't quarrel,\" said Mona, confidently. \"Patty's too sweet-tempered,--\"  \"And you're too amiable,\" supplemented Nan, who was fond of Mona in some ways, though not in others. But she, too, thought that Patty would have a good influence over the motherless girl, and she was honestly glad that Patty could stay at her beloved seashore for the rest of the summer.  So it was settled, and Mona went flying home to carry the glad news to her father, and to begin at once to arrange Patty's rooms.     CHAPTER III  SUSAN TO THE RESCUE   The day that Mr. and Mrs. Fairfield were to start on their trip to the mountains came during what is known as \"a hot spell.\" It was one of those days when life seems almost unbearable,--when the slightest exertion seems impossible.  There was no breeze from the ocean, and the faint, languid land breeze that now and then gave an uncertain puff, was about as refreshing as a heat-wave from an opened furnace door.  At the breakfast table, Patty tried to persuade them not to go that day. \"You'll faint in the train, Nan, on a day like this,\" she said. \"Do wait until to-morrow.\"  \"There's no prospect of its being any better to-morrow,\" said"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5266"],["title","Travels in the Interior of Africa — Volume 01 (#1)"],["body","their different factories to receive their letters, and learn the nature and amount of her cargo; and the captain despatched a messenger to Dr. Laidley to inform him of my arrival.  He came to Jonkakonda the morning following, when I delivered him Mr. Beaufoy’s letter, and he gave me a kind invitation to spend my time at his house until an opportunity should offer of prosecuting my journey.  This invitation was too acceptable to be refused, and being furnished by the Doctor with a horse and guide, I set out from Jonkakonda at daybreak on the 5th of July, and at eleven o’clock arrived at Pisania, where I was accommodated with a room and other conveniences in the Doctor’s house.  Pisania is a small village in the king of Yany’s dominions, established by British subjects as a factory for trade, and inhabited solely by them and their black servants.  It is situated on the banks of the Gambia, sixteen miles above Jonkakonda.  The white residents, at the time of may arrival there, consisted only of Dr. Laidley, and two gentlemen who were brothers, of the name of Ainsley; but their domestics were numerous. They enjoyed perfect security under the king’s protection, and being highly esteemed and respected by the natives at large, wanted no accommodation or comfort which the country could supply, and the greatest part of the trade in slaves, ivory, and gold was in their hands.  Being now settled for some time at my ease, my first object was to learn the Mandingo tongue, being the language in almost general use throughout this part of Africa, and without which I was fully convinced that I never could acquire an extensive knowledge of the country or its inhabitants. In this pursuit I was greatly assisted by Dr. Laidley.  In researches of this kind, and in observing the manners and customs of the natives, in a country so little known to the nations of Europe, and furnished with so many striking and uncommon objects of nature, my time passed not unpleasantly, and I began to flatter myself that I had escaped the fever, or seasoning, to which Europeans, on their first arrival in hot climates, are generally subject.  But on the 31st of July I imprudently exposed myself to the night-dew in observing an eclipse of the moon, with a view to determine the longitude of the place; the next day I found myself attacked with a smart fever and delirium, and such an illness followed as confined me to the house during the greatest part of August.  My recovery was very slow, but I embraced every short interval of convalescence to walk out, and make myself acquainted with the productions of the country.  In one of those excursions, having rambled farther than usual, on a hot day, I brought on a return of my fever, and on the 10th of September I was again confined to my bed.  The fever, however, was not so violent as before; and in the course of three weeks I was able, when the weather would permit, to renew my botanical excursions; and when it rained, I amused myself with drawing plants, &c., in my chamber.  The care and attention of Dr. Laidley contributed greatly to alleviate my sufferings; his company and conversation beguiled the tedious hours during that gloomy season, when the rain falls in torrents; when suffocating heats oppress by day, and when the night is spent by the terrified travellers in listening to the croaking of frogs (of which the numbers are beyond imagination), the shrill cry of the jackal, and the deep howling of the hyæna, a dismal concert, interrupted only by the roar of such tremendous thunder as no person can form a conception of but those who have heard it.  The country itself being an immense level, and very generally covered with wood, presents a tiresome and gloomy uniformity to the eye; but although Nature has denied to the inhabitants the beauties of romantic landscapes, she has bestowed on them, with a liberal hand, the more important blessings of fertility and abundance.  A little attention to cultivation procures a sufficiency of corn, the fields afford a rich pasturage for cattle, and the natives are plentifully supplied with excellent fish, both from the Gambia river and the Walli creek.  The grains which are chiefly cultivated are—Indian corn (_zea mays_); two kinds of _holcus spicatus_, called by the natives _soono_ and _sanio_; _holcus niger_, and _holcus bicolor_, the former of which they have named _bassi woolima_, and the latter _bassiqui_.  These, together with rice, are raised in considerable quantities; besides which, the inhabitants in the vicinity of the towns and villages have gardens which produce onions, calavances, yams, cassavi, ground nuts, pompions, gourds, water-melons, and some other esculent plants.  I observed likewise, near the towns, small patches of cotton and indigo. The former of these articles supplies them with clothing, and with the latter they dye their cloth of an excellent blue colour, in a manner that will hereafter be described.  In preparing their corn for food, the natives use a large wooden mortar called a _paloon_, in which they bruise the seed until it parts with the outer covering, or husk, which is then separated from the clean corn by exposing it to the wind, nearly in the same manner as wheat is cleared from the chaff in England.  The corn thus freed from the husk is returned to the mortar and beaten into meal, which is dressed variously in different countries; but the most common preparation of it among the nations of the Gambia is a sort of pudding which they call _kouskous_. It is made by first moistening the flour with water, and then stirring and shaking it about in a large calabash, or gourd, till it adheres together in small granules resembling sago.  It is then put into an earthen pot, whose bottom is perforated with a number of small holes; and this pot being placed upon another, the two vessels are luted together either with a paste of meal and water, or with cows’ dung, and placed upon the fire.  In the lower vessel is commonly some animal food and water, the steam or vapour of which ascends through the perforations in the bottom of the upper vessel, and softens and the kouskous, which is very much esteemed throughout all the countries that I visited.  I am informed that the same manner of preparing flour is very generally used on the Barbary coast, and that the dish so prepared is there called by the same name.  It is therefore probable that the negroes borrowed the practice from the Moors.  Their domestic animals are nearly the same as in Europe.  Swine are found in the woods, but their flesh is not esteemed.  Probably the marked abhorrence in which this animal is held by the votaries of Mohammed has spread itself among the pagans.  Poultry of all kinds, the turkey excepted, is everywhere to be had.  The guinea-fowl and red partridge abound in the fields, and the woods furnish a small species of antelope, of which the venison is highly and deservedly prized.  Of the other wild animals in the Mandingo countries, the most common are the hyæna, the panther, and the elephant.  Considering the use that is made of the latter in the East Indies, it may be thought extraordinary that the natives of Africa have not, in any part of this immense continent, acquired the skill of taming this powerful and docile creature, and applying his strength and faculties to the service of man. When I told some of the natives that this was actually done in the countries of the East, my auditors laughed me to scorn, and exclaimed, “_Tobaubo fonnio_!” (“A white man’s lie!”)  The negroes frequently find means to destroy the elephant by firearms; they hunt it principally for the sake of the teeth, which they transfer in barter to those who sell them again to the Europeans.  The flesh they eat, and consider it as a great delicacy.  On the 6th of October the waters of the Gambia were at the greatest height, being fifteen feet above the high-water mark of the tide, after which they began to subside, at first slowly, but afterwards very rapidly, sometimes sinking more than a foot in twenty-four hours.  By the beginning of November the river had sunk to its former level, and the tide ebbed and flowed as usual.  When the river had subsided, and the atmosphere grew dry, I recovered apace, and began to think of my departure, for this is reckoned the most proper season for travelling. The natives had completed their harvest, and provisions were everywhere cheap and plentiful.  Dr. Laidley was at this time employed in a trading voyage at Jonkakonda. I wrote to him to desire that he would use his interest with the _slatees_, or slave-merchants, to procure me the company and protection of the first _coffle_ (or caravan) that might leave Gambia for the interior country; and, in the meantime, I requested him to purchase for me a horse and two asses.  A few days afterwards the Doctor returned to Pisania, and informed me that a coffle would certainly go for the interior in the course of the dry season; but that, as many of the merchants belonging to it had not yet completed their assortment of goods, he could not say at what time they would set out.  As the characters and dispositions of the slatees, and people that composed the caravan, were entirely unknown to me—and as they seemed rather averse to my purpose, and unwilling to enter into any positive engagements on my account—and the time of their departure being withal very uncertain, I resolved, on further deliberation, to avail myself of the dry season, and proceed without them.  Dr. Laidley approved my determination, and promised me every assistance in his power to enable me to prosecute my journey with comfort and safety.  This resolution having been formed, I made preparations accordingly.  And now, being about to take leave of my hospitable friend (whose kindness and solicitude continued to the moment of my departure), and to quit for many months the countries bordering on the Gambia, it seems proper, before I proceed with my"]]]
