At last she spoke, and he bent down to catch the words. \"Dear papa,\" she whispered, \"would it make you happy? and do you think mamma knows, and that she would like it?\"  \"Your mamma loves us both too well not to be pleased with anything that would add to our happiness,\" he replied gently.  \"Dear papa, you won't be angry if I ask another question?'\"'  \"No, darling; ask as many as you wish.\"  \"Then, papa, will I have to call her mamma? and do you think my own mamma would like it?\"  \"If Miss Allison consents to take a mother's place to you, I am sure your own mamma, if she could speak to you, would tell you she deserved to have the title; and it would hurt us both very much if you refused to give it. Indeed, my daughter, I cannot ask her to come to us unless you will promise to do so, and to love and obey, her just as you do me. Will you?\"  \"I will try to obey her, papa; and I shall love her very dearly, for I do already; but I can not love anybody quite so well as I love you, my own dear, dear father!\" she said, throwing her arms around his neck.  He returned her caress, saying tenderly, \"That is all I can ask, dearest; I must reserve the first place in your heart for myself.\"  \"Do you think she will come, papa?\" she asked anxiously.  \"I don't know, daughter; I have not asked her yet. But shall I tell her that it will add to your happiness if she will be your mamma?\"  \"Yes, sir; and that I will call her mamma, and obey her and love her dearly. Oh, papa, ask her very soon, won't you?\"  \"Perhaps; but don't set your heart too much on it, for she may not be quite so willing to take such a troublesome charge as Miss Stevens seems to be,\" he said, returning to his playful tone.  Elsie looked troubled and anxious.  \"I hope she will, papa,\" she said; \"I think she might be very glad to come and live with you; and in such a beautiful home, too.\"  \"Ah! but everyone does not appreciate my society as highly as you do,\" he replied, laughing and pinching her cheek; \"and besides, you forget about the troublesome little girl. I have heard ladies say they would not marry a man who had a child.\"  \"But Miss Rose loves me, papa; I am sure she does,\" she said, flushing, and the tears starting to her eyes.  \"Yes, darling, I know she does,\" he answered soothingly. \"I am only afraid she loves you better than she does me.\"  A large party of equestrians were setting out from the hotel that evening soon after tea, and Elsie, in company with several other little girls, went out upon the veranda to watch them mount and ride away. She was absent but a few moments from the parlor, where she had left her father, but when she returned to it he was not there. Miss Rose, too, was gone, she found upon further search, and though she had not much difficulty in conjecturing why she had thus, for the first time, been left behind, she could not help feeling rather lonely and desolate.  She felt no disposition to renew the afternoon's conversation with Annie Hart, so she went quietly upstairs to their private parlor and sat down to amuse herself with a book until Chloe came in from eating her supper. Then the little girl brought a stool, and seating herself in the old posture with her head in her nurse's lap, she drew her mother's miniature from her bosom, and fixing her eyes lovingly upon it, said, as she had done hundreds of times before: \"Now, mammy, please tell me about my dear, dear mamma.\"  The soft eyes were full of tears; for with all her joy at the thought of Rose, mingled a strange sad feeling that she was getting farther away from that dear, precious, unknown mother, whose image had been, since her earliest recollection, enshrined in her very heart of hearts.     CHAPTER II    O lady! there be many things   That seem right fair above;   But sure not one among them all   Is half so sweet as love;--   Let us not pay our vows alone,   But join two altars into one.    --O. W. HOLMES    Here still is the smile that no cloud can o'ercast,   And the heart, and the hand, all thy own to the last.    --MOORE.   Mr. Horace Dinsmore was quite remarkable for his conversational powers, and Rose, who had always heretofore found him a most entertaining companion, wondered greatly at his silence on this particular evening. She waited in vain for him to start some topic of conversation, but as he did not seem disposed to do so, she at length made the attempt herself, and tried one subject after another. Finding, however, that she was answered only in monosyllables, she too grew silent and embarrassed, and heartily wished for the relief of Elsie's presence.  She had proposed summoning the child to accompany them as usual, but Mr. Dinsmore replied that she had already had sufficient exercise, and he would prefer having her remain at home.  They had walked some distance, and coming to a rustic seat where they had often rested, they sat down. The moon was shining softly down upon them, and all nature seemed hushed and still. For some moments neither of them spoke, but at length Mr. Dinsmore broke the silence.  \"Miss Allison,\" he said, in his deep, rich tones, \"I would like to tell you a story, if you will do me the favor to listen.\"  It would have been quite impossible for Rose to tell why her heart beat so fast at this very commonplace remark, but so it was; and she could scarcely steady her voice to reply, \"I always find your stories interesting, Mr. Dinsmore.\"  He began at once.  \"Somewhere between ten and eleven years ago, a wild, reckless boy of seventeen, very much spoiled by the indulgence of a fond, doting father, who loved and petted him as the only son of his departed mother, was spending a few months in one of our large Southern cities, where he met, and soon fell desperately in love with, a beautiful orphan heiress, some two years his junior.  \"The boy was of too ardent a temperament, and too madly in love, to brook for a moment the thought of waiting until parents and guardians should consider them of suitable age to marry, in addition to which he had good reason to fear that his father, with whom family pride was a ruling passion, would entirely refuse his consent upon learning that the father of the young lady had begun life as a poor, uneducated boy, and worked his way up to wealth and position by dint of hard labor and incessant application to business.  \"The boy, it is true, was almost as proud himself, but it was not until the arrows of the boy-god had entered into his heart too deeply to be extracted, that he learned the story of his charmer's antecedents. Yet I doubt if the result would have been different had he been abundantly forewarned; for oh, Miss Rose, if ever an angel walked the earth in human form it was she!--so gentle, so good, so beautiful!\"  He heaved a deep sigh, paused a moment, and then went on:  \"Well, Miss Rose, as you have probably surmised, they were privately married. If that sweet girl had a fault, it was that she was too yielding to those she loved, and she did love her young husband with all the warmth of her young guileless heart; for she had neither parents nor kinsfolk, and he was the one object around which her affections might cling. They were all the world to each other, and for a few short months they were very happy.  \"But it could not last; the marriage was discovered--her guardian and the young man's father were both furious, and they were torn asunder; she carried away to a distant plantation, and he sent North to attend college.  \"They were well-nigh distracted, but cherished the hope that when they should reach their majority and come into possession of their property, which was now unfortunately entirely in the hands of their guardians, they would be reunited.  \"But--it is the old story--their letters were intercepted, and the first news the young husband received of his wife was that she had died a few days after giving birth to a little daughter.\"  Again Mr. Dinsmore paused, then continued:  \"It was a terrible stroke! For months, reason seemed almost ready to desert her throne; but time does wonders, and in the course of years it did much to heal his wounds. You would perhaps suppose that he would at once--or at least as soon as he was his own master--have sought out his child, and lavished upon it the wealth of his affections: but no; he had conceived almost an aversion to it; for he looked upon it as the cause--innocent, it is true--but still the cause of his wife's death. He did not know till long years afterwards that her heart was broken by the false story of his desertion and subsequent death. Her guardian was a hard, cruel man, though faithful in his care of her property.  \"With him the child remained until she was about four years old when a change was made necessary by his death, and she, with her faithful nurse, was received into her paternal grandfather's family until her father, who had then gone abroad, should return. But my story is growing very long, and you will be weary of listening. I will try to be as brief as possible.  \"The little girl, under the care of her nurse and the faithful instructions of a pious old Scotchwoman--who had come over with the child's maternal grandparents, and followed the fortunes of the daughter and granddaughter, always living as housekeeper in the families where they resided--had grown to be a sweet, engaging child, inheriting her mother's beauty and gentleness. She had also her mother's craving for affection, and was constantly looking and longing for the return of her unknown father, which was delayed from time to time until she was nearly eight years of age.  \"At last he came; but ah, what a bitter disappointment awaited the poor child! His mind had been poisoned against her, and instead of the love and tenderness she had a right to expect, he met her with coldness--almost with aversion. Poor little one! she was nearly heartbroken, and for a time scarcely dared venture into her father's presence. She was gentle,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9966"],["title","The Spartan Twins (#1)"],["body","when we have company, we have a feast.\"  His Mother did not answer him; she was too busy.  She sent Chloe to the closet for a jar of wine, and some goat's-milk cheese, and she herself went upstairs to get some dried figs from the store-room. Daphne followed Chloe to the closet, and for a moment there was no one beside the hearth-fire but Dion and Argos, and the sausages smelled very good indeed.  \"I wonder if she counted them,\" thought Dion to himself, as he looked longingly at them. And then almost before he knew it himself he had snatched one of the sausages from the fire and had bitten a piece off the end! It was so very hot that it burned both his fingers and his tongue like everything, and when he tried to lick his fingers, he let go of the sausage, and Argos snapped it up and swallowed it whole. It burned all the way down to his stomach, and Argos gave a dreadful howl of pain and dashed through the door out into the farm-yard. Dion heard his Mother's footsteps coming down the stair. He thought perhaps he'd better join Argos.  When Lydia reached the hearth-fire once more, only Daphne was in the room. She set down the basket of figs and knelt to turn the sausages. She had counted them and she saw at once that one was missing. She was shocked and surprised, but she guessed what had become of it. Mothers are just like that. She rose from her knees and looked around for the culprit. She saw Daphne.  \"You naughty boy!\" she said sternly to Daphne. \"What have you done with that sausage?\"  \"I didn't do anything with it; I never even saw it,\" cried poor Daphne. \"And, besides that, I'm not a naughty boy. I'm not a boy at all! I'm Daphne!\"  \"Where's Dion, then?\" demanded Lydia.  \"I don't know where he is,\" said Daphne. \"I didn't see him either, but I heard Argos howl as if some one had stepped on his tail. Maybe he took the sausage.\"  Lydia went to the door and looked out into the farm-yard. Away off in the farthest corner by the sheep-pen she saw two dark shadows.  \"Come here at once,\" she called.  Dion and Argos both obeyed, but they came very slowly, and Argos had his tail between his legs. Lydia pointed to the fire.  \"Where is the other sausage?\" she inquired, with stern emphasis.  \"Argos ate it,\" said Dion.  \"Open your mouth,\" said his Mother. She looked at Dion's tongue. It was all red where it was burned.  \"I suppose Argos took it off the fire and made you bite it when it was hot,\" said Lydia grimly. \"Very well, he is a bad dog and cannot have any sausage with his supper. And a boy that hasn't any more manners than a dog can't have any either. And neither one can be trusted in the kitchen where things are cooking. Go sit on the wood-pile until I call you.\"  She put both Dion and Argos out of doors and turned to her cooking again.  \"Supper is nearly ready,\" she called at last to Chloe. \"You and Daphne may bring out the couch and get the table ready.\"  Under the arcade in the court there was a small wooden table. Chloe and Daphne lifted it and brought it near the fire. Then they brought a plain wooden bench that also stood under the thatch and placed it beside the table. They arranged cushions of lamb's wool upon the bench, and near the foot set a low stool. Daphne brought the dishes, and when everything was ready, Lydia sent Chloe to call her husband and the Stranger, while she herself went out to the farm-yard. She found Dion and Argos sitting side by side on the wood-pile in dejected silence.  \"Come in and wash your hands,\" she said to Dion. \"If you get yourself clean, wrists and all, you may have your supper with us, but remember, no sausage. You have had your fingers with your food.\" This is what mothers used to say to their children in those days, because there were no knives or forks, and often not even spoons, to eat with.  Lydia didn't invite Argos in, but he came anyway, and lay down beside the fire with his nose on his paws, just where people would be most likely to stumble over him.  When Melas and the Stranger came in, they sat down side by side on the couch. Chloe knelt before them, took off their sandals, and bathed their feet. Then the Stranger loosened his long, cloak-like garment, and he and Melas reclined side by side upon the couch, their left elbows resting on the lamb's-wool cushions. Chloe moved the little table within easy reach of their hands, and Lydia took her place on the stool beside the couch. It was now quite dark except for the light of the hearth-fire.  The Twins had been brought up to be seen and not heard, especially when there was company, and as Dion was not anxious to call attention to himself just then, the two children slipped quietly into their places on the floor by the hearth-fire just as Melas and the Stranger dipped their bread into their broth and began to eat.  It must be confessed that Melas seemed to enjoy the black broth much more than his guest did, but the stranger ate it nevertheless, and when the last drop was gone, the men both wiped their fingers on scraps of bread and threw them to Argos, who snapped them up as greedily as if his tongue had never been burned at all. Then Chloe brought the sausages hot from the fire, and barley-cakes from the oven. When she had served the men and had explained that these cakes were really not so good as her barley-cakes usually were, Lydia gave the Twins each one, and she gave Daphne a sausage. She just looked at Dion without a single word.  He knew perfectly well what she meant. He munched his barley-cake in mournful silence, and I suppose no sausage ever smelled quite so good to any little boy in the whole world as Daphne's did to Dion just then. However, there were plenty of barley-cakes, and his mother let him have honey to eat with them, which comforted Dion so much that when the Stranger began to talk to Melas, he forgot his troubles entirely. He forgot his manners too, and listened with his eyes and mouth both wide open until the honey ran off the barley-cake and down between his fingers. Then he licked his fingers!  No one saw him do it, not even his Mother, because she too was watching the the inhabitants of the little farm. They lived so far from the sea, and so far from highways of travel on the island, that the Twins in all their lives had seen but few persons besides their own family and the slaves who worked on the farm. The Stranger was to them a visitor from another world--the great outside world which lay beyond the shining blue waters of the bay. They had seen that distant world sometimes from a hill-top on a clear day, but they had never been farther from home than the little seaport of Ambelaca two miles away.  \"How is it,\" the Stranger was saying to Melas, \"that you, a Spartan, live here, so far from your native soil, and so near to Athens? The Spartans have but little love for the Athenians as a rule, nor for farming either, I am told.\"  \"We love the Athenians quite as well as they love us,\" answered Melas; \"and as for my being here, I have my father to thank for that. He was a soldier of the Persian Wars and settled here after the Battle of Salamis. I grew up on the island, and thought myself fortunate when I had a chance to become overseer on this farm.\"  \"Who is the owner of the farm?\" asked the Stranger.  \"Pericles, Chief Archon of Athens,\" answered Melas.  \"You are indeed fortunate to be in his service,\" said the Stranger. \"He is the greatest man in Athens, and consequently the greatest man in the world, as any Athenian would tell you!\"  \"Do you know him?\" asked Dion, quite forgetting in his interest that children should be seen and not heard.  Lydia shook her head at Dion, but the Stranger answered just as politely as if Dion were forty years old instead of ten.  \"Yes,\" he said, \"I know Pericles well. I went with him only yesterday to see the new temple he is having built upon the great hill of the Acropolis in Athens. You have seen it, of course,\" he said, turning to Melas.  \"No,\" answered Melas. \"I sell most of my produce in the markets of the Piraeus, and go to Athens itself only when necessary to take fruit and vegetables to the city home of Pericles. There is no occasion to go in the winter, and the season for planting is only just begun. Perhaps later in the summer I shall go.\"  \"When you do,\" said the Stranger, \"do not fail to see the new building on the sacred hill. It is worth a longer journey than from here to Athens, I assure you. People will come from the ends of the earth to see it some day, or I am no true prophet.\"  \"Oh,\" murmured Daphne to Dion, \"don't you wish we could go too?\"  \"You can't go. You're a girl!\" Dion whispered back. \"Girls can't do such things, but I'm going to get Father to take me with him the very next time he goes.\"  Daphne turned up her nose at Dion. \"I don't care if I am a girl,\" she whispered back. \"I'm no Athenian sissy that never puts her nose out of doors, I can do everything you can do here on the farm, and I guess I could in Athens too. Besides, no one would know I'm a girl; I look just as much like a boy as you do. I look just like you.\"  \"You do not,\" said Dion resentfully. \"You can't look like a boy.\"  \"Ail right,\" answered Daphne, \"then you must look just like a girl, for you know very well Father can't tell us apart, so there now.\"  Dion opened his mouth to reply, but just then his Mother shook her head at them, and at the same moment Chloe, coming in with the wine-jar, stumbled over Argos and nearly fell on the table. Argos yelped, and Dion and Daphne both laughed. Lydia was dreadfully ashamed because Chloe had been so awkward, and ashamed of the Twins for laughing. She apologized to the Stranger.  \"Oh, well,\" said the Stranger, and he laughed a little too, even if he was a philosopher, \"boys will be boys, and those seem two fine strong little fellows of yours. One of these days they'll be competing in the Olympian games, I suppose, and how proud you will be if they should bring home the wreath of victors!\"  \"They are as strong as the young"]]]
