I had forgotten. I remember now.\" And Florian shivered a little, not with fear, but with distaste.  \"A man prefers to forget these things when he marries. It is natural enough. But are you not afraid of me who come from yonder?\"  \"Why should I be afraid of you, Tiburce, who gave your life for mine?\"  \"I do not say. But we change yonder.\"  \"And does love change, Tiburce? For surely love is immortal.\"  \"Living or dead, love changes. I do not say love dies in us who may hope to gain nothing more from love. Still, lying alone in the dark clay, there is nothing to do, as yet, save to think of what life was, and of what sunlight was, and of what we sang and whispered in dark places when we had lips; and of how young grass and murmuring waters and the high stars beget fine follies even now; and to think of how merry our loved ones still contrive to be, even now, with their new playfellows. Such reflections are not always conducive to philanthropy.\"  \"Tell me,\" said Florian then, \"and is there no way in which we who are still alive may aid you to be happier yonder?\"  \"Oh, but assuredly,\" replied Tiburce d'Arnaye, and he discoursed of curious matters; and as he talked, the mists about the graveyard thickened. \"And so,\" Tiburce said, in concluding his tale, \"it is not permitted that I make merry at your wedding after the fashion of those who are still in the warm flesh. But now that you recall our ancient compact, it is permitted I have my peculiar share in the merriment, and I may drink with you to the bride's welfare.\"  \"I drink,\" said Florian, as he took the proffered cup, \"to the welfare of my beloved Adelaide, whom alone of women I have really loved, and whom I shall love always.\"  \"I perceive,\" replied the other, \"that you must still be having your joke.\"  Then Florian drank, and after him Tiburce. And Florian said, \"But it is a strange drink, Tiburce, and now that you have tasted it you are changed.\"  \"You have not changed, at least,\" Tiburce answered; and for the first time he smiled, a little perturbingly by reason of the change in him.  \"Tell me,\" said Florian, \"of how you fare yonder.\"  So Tiburce told him of yet more curious matters. Now the augmenting mists had shut off all the rest of the world. Florian could see only vague rolling graynesses and a gray and changed Tiburce sitting there, with bright wild eyes, and discoursing in a small chill voice. The appearance of a woman came, and sat beside him on the right. She, too, was gray, as became Eve's senior: and she made a sign which Florian remembered, and it troubled him.  Tiburce said then, \"And now, young Florian, you who were once so dear to me, it is to your welfare I drink.\"  \"I drink to yours, Tiburce.\"  Tiburce drank first: and Florian, having drunk in turn, cried out, \"You have changed beyond recognition!\"  \"You have not changed,\" Tiburce d'Arnaye replied again. \"Now let me tell you of our pastimes yonder.\"  With that he talked of exceedingly curious matters. And Florian began to grow dissatisfied, for Tiburce was no longer recognizable, and Tiburce whispered things uncomfortable to believe; and other eyes, as wild as his, but lit with red flarings from behind, like a beast's eyes, showed in the mists to this side and to that side, for unhappy beings were passing through the mists upon secret errands which they discharged unwillingly. Then, too, the appearance of a gray man now sat to the left of that which had been Tiburce d'Arnaye, and this newcomer was marked so that all might know who he was: and Florian's heart was troubled to note how handsome and how admirable was that desecrated face even now.  \"But I must go,\" said Florian, \"lest they miss me at Storisende, and Adelaide be worried.\"  \"Surely it will not take long to toss off a third cup. Nay, comrade, who were once so dear, let us two now drink our last toast together. Then go, in Sclaug's name, and celebrate your marriage. But before that let us drink to the continuance of human mirth-making everywhere.\"  Florian drank first. Then Tiburce took his turn, looking at Florian as Tiburce drank slowly. As he drank, Tiburce d'Arnaye was changed even more, and the shape of him altered, and the shape of him trickled as though Tiburce were builded of sliding fine white sand. So Tiburce d'Arnaye returned to his own place. The appearances that had sat to his left and to his right were no longer there to trouble Florian with memories. And Florian saw that the mists of Walburga's Eve had departed, and that the sun was rising, and that the graveyard was all overgrown with nettles and tall grass.  He had not remembered the place being thus, and it seemed to him the night had passed with unnatural quickness. But he thought more of the fact that he had been beguiled into spending his wedding-night in a graveyard, in such questionable company, and of what explanation he could make to Adelaide.   2. _Of Young Persons in May_  The tale tells how Florian de Puysange came in the dawn through flowering gardens, and heard young people from afar, already about their maying. Two by two he saw them from afar as they went with romping and laughter into the tall woods behind Storisende to fetch back the May-pole with dubious old rites. And as they went they sang, as was customary, that song which Raimbaut de Vaqueiras made in the ancient time in honor of May's ageless triumph.  Sang they:    \"_May shows with godlike showing   To-day for each that sees   May's magic overthrowing   All musty memories   In him whom May decrees   To be love's own. He saith,   'I wear love's liveries   Until released by death_.'    \"_Thus all we laud May's sowing,   Nor heed how harvests please   When nowhere grain worth growing   Greets autumn's questing breeze,   And garnerers garner these--   Vain words and wasted breath   And spilth and tasteless lees--   Until released by death._    \"_Unwillingly foreknowing   That love with May-time flees,   We take this day's bestowing,   And feed on fantasies   Such as love lends for ease   Where none but travaileth,   With lean infrequent fees,   Until released by death_.\"  And Florian shook his sleek black head. \"A very foolish and pessimistical old song, a superfluous song, and a song that is particularly out of place in the loveliest spot in the loveliest of all possible worlds.\"  Yet Florian took no inventory of the gardens. There was but a happy sense of green and gold, with blue topping all; of twinkling, fluent, tossing leaves and of the gray under side of elongated, straining leaves; a sense of pert bird noises, and of a longer shadow than usual slanting before him, and a sense of youth and well-being everywhere. Certainly it was not a morning wherein pessimism might hope to flourish.  Instead, it was of Adelaide that Florian thought: of the tall, impulsive, and yet timid, fair girl who was both shrewd and innocent, and of her tenderly colored loveliness, and of his abysmally unmerited felicity in having won her. Why, but what, he reflected, grimacing--what if he had too hastily married somebody else? For he had earlier fancied other women for one reason or another: but this, he knew, was the great love of his life, and a love which would endure unchanged as long as his life lasted.   3. _What Comes of Marrying Happily_  The tale tells how Florian de Puysange found Adelaide in the company of two ladies who were unknown to him. One of these was very old, the other an imposing matron in middle life. The three were pleasantly shaded by young oak-trees; beyond was a tall hedge of clipped yew. The older women were at chess, while Adelaide bent her meek golden head to some of that fine needlework in which the girl delighted. And beside them rippled a small sunlit stream, which babbled and gurgled with silver flashes. Florian hastily noted these things as he ran laughing to his wife.  \"Heart's dearest--!\" he cried. And he saw, perplexed, that Adelaide had risen with a faint wordless cry, and was gazing at him as though she were puzzled and alarmed a very little.  \"Such an adventure as I have to tell you of!\" says Florian then.  \"But, hey, young man, who are you that would seem to know my daughter so well?\" demands the lady in middle life, and she rose majestically from her chess-game.  Florian stared, as he well might. \"Your daughter, madame! But certainly you are not Dame Melicent.\"  At this the old, old woman raised her nodding head. \"Dame Melicent? And was it I you were seeking, sir?\"  Now Florian looked from one to the other of these incomprehensible strangers, bewildered: and his eyes came back to his lovely wife, and his lips smiled irresolutely. \"Is this some jest to punish me, my dear?\"  But then a new and graver trouble kindled in his face, and his eyes narrowed, for there was something odd about his wife also.  \"I have been drinking in queer company,\" he said. \"It must be that my head is not yet clear. Now certainly it seems to me that you are Adelaide de la ForÃªt, and certainly it seems to me that you are not Adelaide.\"  The girl replied, \"Why, no, messire; I am Sylvie de Nointel.\"  \"Come, come,\" says the middle-aged lady, briskly, \"let us make an end to this play-acting, and, young fellow, let us have a sniff at you. No, you are not tipsy, after all. Well, I am glad of that. So let us get to the bottom of this business. What do they call you when you are at home?\"  \"Florian de Puysange,\" he answered, speaking meekly enough. This capable large person was to the young man rather intimidating.  \"La!\" said she. She looked at him very hard. She nodded gravely two or three times, so that her double chin opened and shut. \"Yes, and you favor him. How old are you?\"  He told her twenty-four.  She said, inconsequently: \"So I was a fool, after all. Well, young man, you will never be as good-looking as your father, but I trust you have an honester"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/95"],["title","The Prisoner of Zenda (#1)"],["body","son, the famous Elphberg name of Rudolf) had always been averse from my going, and, since his death, my brother, prompted by Rose, had accepted the family tradition which taught that a wide berth was to be given to that country. But the moment Ruritania had come into my head I was eaten up with a curiosity to see it. After all, red hair and long noses are not confined to the House of Elphberg, and the old story seemed a preposterously insufficient reason for debarring myself from acquaintance with a highly interesting and important kingdom, one which had played no small part in European history, and might do the like again under the sway of a young and vigorous ruler, such as the new King was rumoured to be. My determination was clinched by reading in _The Times_ that Rudolf the Fifth was to be crowned at Strelsau in the course of the next three weeks, and that great magnificence was to mark the occasion. At once I made up my mind to be present, and began my preparations. But, inasmuch as it has never been my practice to furnish my relatives with an itinerary of my journeys and in this case I anticipated opposition to my wishes, I gave out that I was going for a ramble in the Tyrol--an old haunt of mine--and propitiated Roseâs wrath by declaring that I intended to study the political and social problems of the interesting community which dwells in that neighbourhood.  âPerhaps,â I hinted darkly, âthere may be an outcome of the expedition.â  âWhat do you mean?â she asked.  âWell,â said I carelessly, âthere seems a gap that might be filled by an exhaustive work on--â  âOh! will you write a book?â she cried, clapping her hands. âThat would be splendid, wouldnât it, Robert?â  âItâs the best of introductions to political life nowadays,â observed my brother, who has, by the way, introduced himself in this manner several times over. _Burlesdon on Ancient Theories and Modern Facts_ and _The Ultimate Outcome, by a Political Student_, are both works of recognized eminence.  âI believe you are right, Bob, my boy,â said I.  âNow promise youâll do it,â said Rose earnestly.  âNo, I wonât promise; but if I find enough material, I will.â  âThatâs fair enough,â said Robert.  âOh, material doesnât matter!â she said, pouting.  But this time she could get no more than a qualified promise out of me. To tell the truth, I would have wagered a handsome sum that the story of my expedition that summer would stain no paper and spoil not a single pen. And that shows how little we know what the future holds; for here I am, fulfilling my qualified promise, and writing, as I never thought to write, a book--though it will hardly serve as an introduction to political life, and has not a jot to do with the Tyrol.  Neither would it, I fear, please Lady Burlesdon, if I were to submit it to her critical eye--a step which I have no intention of taking.     CHAPTER 2  Concerning the Colour of Menâs Hair   It was a maxim of my Uncle Williamâs that no man should pass through Paris without spending four-and-twenty hours there. My uncle spoke out of a ripe experience of the world, and I honoured his advice by putting up for a day and a night at âThe Continentalâ on my way to--the Tyrol. I called on George Featherly at the Embassy, and we had a bit of dinner together at Durandâs, and afterwards dropped in to the Opera; and after that we had a little supper, and after that we called on Bertram Bertrand, a versifier of some repute and Paris correspondent to _The Critic_. He had a very comfortable suite of rooms, and we found some pleasant fellows smoking and talking. It struck me, however, that Bertram himself was absent and in low spirits, and when everybody except ourselves had gone, I rallied him on his moping preoccupation. He fenced with me for a while, but at last, flinging himself on a sofa, he exclaimed:  âVery well; have it your own way. I am in love--infernally in love!â  âOh, youâll write the better poetry,â said I, by way of consolation.  He ruffled his hair with his hand and smoked furiously. George Featherly, standing with his back to the mantelpiece, smiled unkindly.  âIf itâs the old affair,â said he, âyou may as well throw it up, Bert. Sheâs leaving Paris tomorrow.â  âI know that,â snapped Bertram.  âNot that it would make any difference if she stayed,â pursued the relentless George. âShe flies higher than the paper trade, my boy!â  âHang her!â said Bertram.  âIt would make it more interesting for me,â I ventured to observe, âif I knew who you were talking about.â  âAntoinette Mauban,â said George.  âDe Mauban,â growled Bertram.  âOho!â said I, passing by the question of the `deâ. âYou donât mean to say, Bert--?â  âCanât you let me alone?â  âWhereâs she going to?â I asked, for the lady was something of a celebrity.  George jingled his money, smiled cruelly at poor Bertram, and answered pleasantly:  âNobody knows. By the way, Bert, I met a great man at her house the other night--at least, about a month ago. Did you ever meet him--the Duke of Strelsau?â  âYes, I did,â growled Bertram.  âAn extremely accomplished man, I thought him.â  It was not hard to see that Georgeâs references to the duke were intended to aggravate poor Bertramâs sufferings, so that I drew the inference that the duke had distinguished Madame de Mauban by his attentions. She was a widow, rich, handsome, and, according to repute, ambitious. It was quite possible that she, as George put it, was flying as high as a personage who was everything he could be, short of enjoying strictly royal rank: for the duke was the son of the late King of Ruritania by a second and morganatic marriage, and half-brother to the new King. He had been his fatherâs favourite, and it had occasioned some unfavourable comment when he had been created a duke, with a title derived from no less a city than the capital itself. His mother had been of good, but not exalted, birth.  âHeâs not in Paris now, is he?â I asked.  âOh no! Heâs gone back to be present at the Kingâs coronation; a ceremony which, I should say, heâll not enjoy much. But, Bert, old man, donât despair! He wonât marry the fair Antoinette--at least, not unless another plan comes to nothing. Still perhaps she--â He paused and added, with a laugh: âRoyal attentions are hard to resist--you know that, donât you, Rudolf?â  âConfound you!â said I; and rising, I left the hapless Bertram in Georgeâs hands and went home to bed.  The next day George Featherly went with me to the station, where I took a ticket for Dresden.  âGoing to see the pictures?â asked George, with a grin.  George is an inveterate gossip, and had I told him that I was off to Ruritania, the news would have been in London in three days and in Park Lane in a week. I was, therefore, about to return an evasive answer, when he saved my conscience by leaving me suddenly and darting across the platform. Following him with my eyes, I saw him lift his hat and accost a graceful, fashionably dressed woman who had just appeared from the booking-office. She was, perhaps, a year or two over thirty, tall, dark, and of rather full figure. As George talked, I saw her glance at me, and my vanity was hurt by the thought that, muffled in a fur coat and a neck-wrapper (for it was a chilly April day) and wearing a soft travelling hat pulled down to my ears, I must be looking very far from my best. A moment later, George rejoined me.  âYouâve got a charming travelling companion,â he said. âThatâs poor Bert Bertrandâs goddess, Antoinette de Mauban, and, like you, sheâs going to Dresden--also, no doubt, to see the pictures. Itâs very queer, though, that she doesnât at present desire the honour of your acquaintance.â  âI didnât ask to be introduced,â I observed, a little annoyed.  âWell, I offered to bring you to her; but she said, âAnother time.â Never mind, old fellow, perhaps thereâll be a smash, and youâll have a chance of rescuing her and cutting out the Duke of Strelsau!â  No smash, however, happened, either to me or to Madame de Mauban. I can speak for her as confidently as for myself; for when, after a nightâs rest in Dresden, I continued my journey, she got into the same train. Understanding that she wished to be let alone, I avoided her carefully, but I saw that she went the same way as I did to the very end of my journey, and I took opportunities of having a good look at her, when I could do so unobserved.  As soon as we reached the Ruritanian frontier (where the old officer who presided over the Custom House favoured me with such a stare that I felt surer than before of my Elphberg physiognomy), I bought the papers, and found in them news which affected my movements. For some reason, which was not clearly explained, and seemed to be something of a mystery, the date of the coronation had been suddenly advanced, and the ceremony was to take place on the next day but one. The whole country seemed in a stir about it, and it was evident that Strelsau was thronged. Rooms were all let and hotels overflowing; there would be very little chance of my obtaining a lodging, and I should certainly have to pay an exorbitant charge for it. I made up my mind to stop at Zenda, a small town fifty miles short of the capital, and about ten from the frontier. My train reached there in the evening; I would spend the next day, Tuesday, in a wander over the hills, which were said to be very fine, and in taking a glance at the famous Castle, and go over by train to Strelsau on the Wednesday morning, returning at night to sleep at Zenda.  Accordingly at Zenda I got out, and as the train passed where I stood on the platform, I saw my friend Madame de Mauban in her place; clearly she was going through to Strelsau, having, with more providence than I could boast, secured apartments there. I smiled to think how surprised George Featherly would have been to know that she and I had been fellow travellers for so long.  I was very kindly received at the hotel--it was really no more than an inn--kept by a fat old lady"]]]
