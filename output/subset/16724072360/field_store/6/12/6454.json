What a wild country it must be!\"  \"Dear, darling, jolly old place!\" said Kitty, dancing up and down.  \"And you really give me to understand that people make remarks on one another in that sort of fashion?\" said Alice, darting away from her companion and pouring some water into a basin to wash her hands.  \"Well, yes, love, they do when they like, and they don't when they don't like. We are free and easy folk, I can tell you, and we have a gay time. I'll tell you all about father and the old castle, and the dogs, and the cows, and the cats, and the rabbits, and the mice when we have a spare moment. That brother of yours, Fred, is not half a bad old chap; and I saw a nice, curly-headed little gossoon coming in just now with his books under his arm. What's his name?\"  \"Oh, you mean Philip. Yes, he's the youngest; he's well enough if you don't spoil him, Kitty.\"  \"I won't spoil him, bless his heart,\" said Kitty; \"but of course I'll make friends with him. I couldn't live without boys. There are two at home, Pat and Laurence; and, oh! I shall miss Laurie, dear old chap! I must not think of him.\" Kitty's face underwent a swift change, the brightness went out of it just as if a heavy cloud had swept away the sun; the big, very handsome dark-blue eyes, so dark as to be almost black, grew full of sudden tears; the exquisitely curved lips trembled; she turned her head aside and looked out of the window.  At that moment it seemed to Alice that she saw beneath Kitty's wild, eccentric manners a heart of gold. She only caught a glimpse of it, for the next moment the girl was chatting away in the most light, frivolous, extraordinary style. The dinner-bell sounded through the house, and the pair went down to dinner.  \"I'd like to sit near you, please, Mr. Denvers,\" said Kitty.  Philip's place was always near his father; this had been a custom ever since he had been a baby. Kitty now ensconced herself in the little boy's chair.  \"Am I taking anybody's seat?\" she asked, looking up.  \"Only mine,\" said Phil.  \"Never mind, little gossoon; you shall have it to-morrow. I want to sit near Mr. Denvers because I expect he can tell me a good many things I don't understand.\"  \"You must allow me to eat my dinner, Miss Malone. You see I have a good deal of carving to do, and besides I am a busy man,\" said Mr. Denvers in a good-humored voice, for it was difficult to resist the roguish glances of Kitty's eyes, and the sort of affectionate way in which she cuddled up to her host's side.  \"Oh, I won't talk _over_ much,\" she said, glancing with her flashing eyes round at the entire party. \"But you see I am quite a stranger; and, oh my! the place does seem lonely. You are all so stiff, I cannot quite understand it. Is it the English fashion, please, Mr. Denvers?\"  \"Well, you see,\" answered Mrs. Denvers from the other end of the table, \"we don't know you yet.\"  \"But I am sure all the same we shall be very good friends,\" said Mr. Denvers. \"May I give you a glass of wine?\"  \"Wine! Bless you, I'm a teetotaller,\" said Kitty. \"Why, it isn't habits of intoxication you'll be putting into me. I never take anything but water, or milk when I can get it; and it isn't Miss Malone you're going to call me is it, for if it is I tell you frankly that I'll die entirely. I must be Kitty from this moment, or Kitty Malone, or anything of that sort, but Kitty something it must be. Now, is it settled fair and square, Kitty shall I be? Here's my hand on my heart; I'll die if I'm called Miss Malone!\"  Fred burst into roars of laughter.  \"I say,\" he cried, \"what an extraordinary girl you are!\"  \"Well, and so are you an extraordinary boy,\" said Kitty. \"Oh, dear me, I am hungry! Do you mind handing me over the potatoes? Why, you don't mean to say you peel 'em. I never heard of such a thing! Why don't you have them in their jackets?\"  \"Potatoes are generally mashed or peeled or something of that sort in England,\" said Mr. Denvers. \"I see, Kitty--\" he added.  \"Ah! bless you now for calling me that! What is it you want to say, dear Mr. Denvers?\"  \"I see we shall have a good deal to teach you,\" he said, and then he too burst into a fit of laughter, and so the merry, somewhat rollicking meal proceeded.  Alice alone would not succumb to the fascinations of the Irish maiden. She sat holding herself somewhat stiff, feeling a good deal disgusted, wondering what Bessie Challoner would say, what Gwin Harley would think, anticipating in advance Elma's sneers.  Kitty, however, subjugated Mr. and Mrs. Denvers and the two boys completely. As to Pointer, he would not leave her side; as her long, white, taper fingers touched the top of his grizzled head, he looked at her with eyes of unutterable love.  \"What have you done to the dog?\" said Fred at last. He felt almost afraid, in his great admiration of the bewitching stranger.  \"Only given him a taste of blarney,\" was the reply. \"Tell me now, Fred, were you ever in Ireland?\"  \"No,\" answered Fred.  \"Ah! I thought as much. If you had been, and if you had kissed the Blarney Stone, why then, it's nothing could withstand you.\"  \"What is the Blarney Stone?\" asked Fred.  \"Don't you know that much? Why you are an ignoramus out and out. Well, I'll tell you. It's a stone on Blarney Castle, set low down in the wall, five or six feet from the top; and to kiss it, why that is no easy matter, for you have to be held by your heels and let hang over the wall; and if you can get some one to hold you tight--very tight, mind--you slide down and you reach the stone and you kiss it, and from that moment--oh glory! but you carry everything before you. There's not a man, a woman, nor a child, no, nor a beastie either, that can resist you. You bewitch 'em.\"  \"I have no doubt, Kitty, you kissed the stone,\" said Mr. Denvers.  \"Why then, it's yes, sir,\" she answered raising her big eyes and then dropping them again with an inimitable expression.  \"What a queer little girl you are!\" he said. \"You are very amusing; but I think we must tame you a bit.\"  \"You won't do that, sir. They call me the wild Irish girl at home, and the wild Irish girl I'll be to the end of the chapter. If it's schooling I want, why, I'll have it, but taming, no thank you.\"  Kitty jumped from her seat and began to dance a sort of improvised Irish jig about the room.  \"Do you know the jig?\" she said, dancing up to Fred as she spoke.  \"No,\" he answered; \"are you trying it on now?\"  \"Yes; jump up, my hearty, and I'll teach you in a twinkling. Here, watch me; point your toes so, turn round--pirouette as we call it. Now, then, put your hand on your hip, courtesy to me, and come back again. That's how it's done. Oh, Fred, I'll soon have you as beautiful a broth of a boy as if you were born in Old Ireland.\"  \"Fred, my son, it is time for you to go back to college,\" said his father. \"Kitty, we are very pleased to have you here, and you are a very amusing girl; but you know life is not all play.\"  Kitty pulled a long face. Fred darted a laughing glance at her, and ran off. Kitty and Alice at last found themselves alone.  \"You're disapproving of me a good bit, aren't you, Alice?\" said Kitty, going up to the other girl and taking both her hands in hers.  \"Well, I think you are very odd,\" said Alice.  \"And do you want me to be quite sober and tame, and to have all the spirit knocked out me, alanna?\"  \"No; but we don't do exactly as you do in this country.\"  \"And you think you'll tame me into your cut-and-dry pattern?\"  \"I don't know about that. I don't understand you, Kitty.\"  \"You will after a bit, Alice. It's here I am for sure, and a gray sort of land it is! Why, the sun doesn't even shine!\"  \"Oh, doesn't it,\" said Alice angrily. \"It's ridiculous to talk in that strain about this country. We have much finer weather than you have in Ireland.\"  \"Don't be cross, darling; I mean it metaphorically. You see we live a gay life over there, we have a joke about everything, and the wit that runs out of our mouths--why, it's like flashes of lightning. Oh, we have a good time in the old country, and when you come and stay with me at Castle Malone you'll say so for yourself. Now, then, what do you want to do this afternoon?\"  \"I must look over my lessons first.\"  \"Lessons--how many?\"  \"A good few. You see of course I want to get on.\"  \"By the way, Alice,\" said Mrs. Denvers, who came into the room at that moment, \"I am afraid you had a bad mark for unpunctuality this morning.\"  \"Yes, mother, that is so.\"  \"And what is your place in form?\"  \"I went down two or three places, mother.\"  \"I am sorry to hear it; your father will be very much annoyed.\"  \"I'll try and make up for it to-morrow, mother. And, mother, Gwin Harley has asked me to go to tea with her this afternoon--may I?\"  \"I don't see how you can. There is Kitty Malone.\"  \"But she has asked Kitty too.\"  \"What's that?\" asked Kitty, bounding forward. \"A tea party, bless you?\"  \"You have been asked to tea at Harley Grove. Mother, may we go? I think Kitty would enjoy it.\"  \"If you are sure you are not too tired, Kitty; you have had a long journey,\" said Mrs. Denvers.  \"I'm not a scrap tired,\" said Kitty. \"I'm as gay as a lark and as fresh as a daisy. I hope it's rather a big swell party, for I have got some awfully pretty dresses. I want to make myself look smart. You can tell me how they manage these sort of things in England. I'm all agog to go.\"  \"Yes, Alice, you may go,\" said Mrs. Denvers. \"But Kitty, my dear, if I were you I would let them down lightly.\"  \"What do you mean, dear Mrs. Denvers?\"  \"Don't startle them too much. They are not accustomed to such--such frankness as you are disposed to give.\"  \"I'll bewitch 'em,\" said Kitty, beginning again to dance with light fantastic measure up and down the room. \"I'll bewitch 'em one and all.

I didn't kiss the Blarney"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9990"],["title","Brave and Bold; Or, The Fortunes of Robert Rushton (#1)"],["body","ready.  \"I am a little late this morning, mother,\" he said. \"I must hurry down my breakfast, or I shall be late at the factory, and that will bring twenty-five cents fine.\"  \"It would be a pity to get fined, but you mustn't eat too fast. It is not healthful.\"  \"I've got a pretty good digestion, mother,\" said Robert, laughing. \"Nothing troubles me.\"  \"Still, you mustn't trifle with it. Do you remember, Robert,\" added his mother, soberly, \"it is just two years to-day since your poor father left us for Boston to take command of his ship?\"  \"So it is, mother; I had forgotten it.\"  \"I little thought then that I should never see him again!\" and Mrs. Rushton sighed.  \"It is strange we have never heard anything of the ship.\"  \"Not so strange, Robert. It must have gone down when no other vessel was in sight.\"  \"I wish we knew the particulars, mother. Sometimes I think father may have escaped from the ship in a boat, and may be still alive.\"  \"I used to think it possible, Robert; but I have given up all hopes of it. Two years have passed, and if your father were alive, we should have seen him or heard from him ere this.\"  \"I am afraid you are right. There's one thing I can't help thinking of, mother,\" said Robert, thoughtfully. \"How is it that father left no property? He received a good salary, did he not?\"  \"Yes; he had received a good salary for several years.\"  \"He did not spend the whole of it, did he?\"  \"No, I am sure he did not. Your father was never extravagant.\"  \"Didn't he ever speak to you on the subject?\"  \"He was not in the habit of speaking of his business; but just before he went away, I remember him telling me that he had some money invested, and hoped to add more to it during the voyage which proved so fatal to him.\"  \"He didn't tell you how much it was, nor how it was invested?\"  \"No; that was all he said. Since his death, I have looked everywhere in the house for some papers which would throw light upon it; but I have been able to find nothing. I do not care so much for myself, but I should be glad if you did not have to work so hard.\"  \"Never mind me, mother; I'm young and strong, I can stand work--but it's hard on you.\"  \"I am rich in having a good son, Robert.\"  \"And I in a good mother,\" said Robert, affectionately. \"And, now, to change the subject. I suspect I have incurred the enmity of Halbert Davis.\"  \"How is that?\" asked Mrs. Rushton.  \"I went home with Hester Paine, last evening, from writing school. Just as she had accepted my escort, Halbert came up, and in a condescending way, informed her that he would see her home.\"  \"What did she say?\"  \"She told him she was engaged to me. He said, coolly, that he would relieve me of the duty, but I declined his obliging offer. He looked mad enough, I can tell you. He's full of self-conceit, and I suppose he wondered how any one could prefer me to him.\"  \"I am sorry you have incurred his enmity.\"  \"I didn't lose any sleep by it.\"  \"You know his father is the superintendent of the factory.\"  \"Halbert isn't.\"  \"But he may prejudice his father against you, and get you discharged.\"  \"I don't think he would be quite so mean as that. We won't borrow trouble, mother. But time's up, and I must go.\"  Robert seized his hat and hurried to the mill. He was in his place when the great factory bell stopped ringing on the stroke of seven, and so escaped the fine, which would have cut off one-quarter of a day's pay.  Meanwhile, Halbert Davis had passed an uncomfortable and restless night. He had taken a fancy to Hester Paine, and he had fully determined to escort her home on the previous evening. As she was much sought after among her young companions, it would have gratified his pride to have it known that she had accepted his company. But he had been cut out, and by Robert Rushton--one of his father's factory hands. This made his jealousy more intolerable, and humiliated his pride, and set him to work devising schemes for punishing Robert's presumption. He felt that it was Robert's duty, even though he had been accepted, to retire from the field as soon as his, Halbert's, desire was known. This Robert had expressly declined to do, and Halbert felt very indignant. He made up his mind that he would give Robert a chance to apologize, and if he declined to do so he would do what he could to get him turned out of the factory.  At twelve o'clock the factory bell pealed forth a welcome sound to the hundreds who were busily at work within the great building. It was the dinner hour, and a throng of men, women and children poured out of the great portals and hastened to their homes or boarding houses to dine. Among them was Robert Rushton. As he was walking homeward with his usual quick, alert step, he came upon Halbert Davis, at the corner of the street.  Halbert was dressed carefully, and, as usual, was swinging his cane in his gloved hand. Robert would have passed him with a nod, but Halbert, who was waiting for him, called out:  \"I say, you fellow, stop a minute. I want to speak to you.\"  \"Are you addressing me?\" asked Robert, with a pride as great as his own.  \"Yes.\"  \"Then you had better mend your manners.\"  \"What do you mean?\" demanded Halbert, his sallow face slightly flushing.  \"My name is Robert Rushton. Call me by either of these names when you speak to me, and don't say 'you fellow.'\"  \"It seems to me,\" sneered Halbert, \"that you are putting on airs for a factory boy.\"  \"I am a factory boy, I acknowledge, and am not ashamed to acknowledge it. Is this all you have to say to me? If so, I will pass on, as I am in haste.\"  \"I have something else to say to you. You were impudent to me last evening.\"  \"Was I? Tell me how.\"  \"Did you not insist on going home with Hester Paine, when I had offered my escort?\"  \"What of that?\"  \"You forget your place.\"  \"My place was at Hester Paine's side, since she had accepted my escort.\"  \"It was very presumptuous in a factory boy like you offering your escort to a young lady like Miss Paine.\"  \"I don't see it,\" said Robert, independently; \"and I don't think it struck Hester in that light. We had a very agreeable walk.\"  Halbert was provoked and inflamed with jealousy, and the look with which he regarded our hero was by no means friendly.  \"You mustn't regard yourself as Miss Paine's equal because she condescended to walk with you,\" he said. \"You had better associate with those of your own class hereafter, and not push yourself in where your company is not agreeable.\"  \"Keep your advice to yourself, Halbert Davis,\" said Robert, hotly, for he felt the insult conveyed in these words. \"If I am a factory boy I don't intend to submit to your impertinence; and I advise you to be careful what you say. As to Miss Hester Paine, I shall not ask your permission to walk with her, but shall do so whenever she chooses to accept my escort. Has she authorized you to speak for her?\"  \"No; but----\"  \"Then wait till she does.\"  Halbert was so incensed that, forgetting Robert's superior strength, evident enough to any one who saw the two, one with his well-knit, vigorous figure, the other slender and small of frame, he raised his cane and struck our hero smartly upon the arm.  In a moment the cane was wrested from his grasp and applied to his own person with a sharp, stinging blow which broke the fragile stick in two.  Casting the pieces upon the ground at his feet, Robert said, coolly:  \"Two can play at that game, Halbert Davis. When you want another lesson come to me.\"  He passed his discomfited antagonist and hastened to the little cottage, where his mother was wondering what made him so much behind time.     CHAPTER III.   THE SPECIAL DEPOSIT.  Stung with mortification and more incensed against Robert than ever, Halbert hastened home. The house in which he lived was the largest and most pretentious in Millville--a large, square house, built in modern style, and with modern improvements, accessible from the street by a semi-circular driveway terminating in two gates, one at each end of the spacious lawn that lay in front. The house had been built only three years, and was the show-place of the village.  Halbert entered the house, and throwing his hat down on a chair in the hall, entered the dining-room, his face still betraying his angry feelings.  \"What's the matter, Halbert?\" asked his mother, looking up as he entered.  \"Do you see this?\" said Halbert, displaying the pieces of his cane.  \"How did you break it?\"  \"I didn't break it.\"  \"How came it broken, then?\"  \"Robert Rushton broke it.\"  \"The widow Rushton's son?\"  \"Yes; he's a low scoundrel,\" said Halbert bitterly.  \"What made him break it?\"  \"He struck me with it hard enough to break it, and then threw the pieces on the ground. I wouldn't mind it so much if he were not a low factory boy, unworthy of a gentleman's attention.\"  \"How dared he touch you?\" asked Mrs. Davis, angrily.  \"Oh, he's impudent enough for anything. He walked home with Hester Paine last evening from the writing school. I suppose she didn't know how to refuse him. I met him just now and told him he ought to know his place better than to offer his escort to a young lady like Hester. He got mad and struck me.\"  \"It was very proper advice,\" said Mrs. Davis, who resembled her son in character and disposition, and usually sided with him in his quarrels. \"I should think Hester would have more sense than to encourage a boy in his position.\"  \"I have no doubt she was bored by his company,\" said Halbert, who feared on the contrary that Hester was only too well pleased with his rival, and hated him accordingly; \"only she was too good-natured to say so.\"  \"The boy must be a young brute to turn upon you so violently.\"  \"That's just what he is.\"  \"He ought to be punished for it.\"  \"I'll tell you how it can be done,\" said Halbert. \"Just you speak to father about it, and get him dismissed from the factory.\"  \"Then he is employed in the factory?\"  \"Yes. He and his mother are as poor as poverty, and that's about all they have to live upon; yet "]]]
