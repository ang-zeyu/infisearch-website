And he went on once more with a long argument full of Bible quotations and everything.  And I wuz too tuckered out to say much more. But I did contend for it to the last, that I didn't believe a rostrum would be any more tottlin' and skairful a place than the barell I had been a-standin' on all day, nor the work I'd do on it any harder than the scrapin' of the ceilin' of that meetin house.  And I don't believe it would, I stand jest as firm on it to-day as I did then.     CHAPTER XX.   Wall, we got the scrapin' done after three hard and arjous days' works, and then we preceeded to clean the house. The day we set to clean the meetin' house prior and before paperin', we all met in good season, for we knew the hardships of the job in front of us, and we all felt that we wanted to tackle it with our full strengths.  Sister Henzy, wife of Deacon Henzy, got there jest as I did. She wuz in middlin' good spirits and a old yeller belzerine dress.  Sister Gowdy had the ganders and newraligy and wore a flannel for 'em round her head, but she wuz in workin' spirits, her will wuz up in arms, and nerved up her body.  Sister Meechim wuz a-makin' soap, and so wuz Sister Sypher, and Sister Mead, and me. But we all felt that soap come after religion, not before. \"Cleanliness _next_ to godliness.\"  So we wuz all willin' to act accordin' and tackle the old meetin' house with a willin' mind.  Wall, we wuz all engaged in the very heat of the warfare, as you may say, a-scrubbin' the floors, and a-scourin' the benches by the door, and a-blackin' the 2 stoves that stood jest inside of the door. We wuz workin' jest as hard as wimmen ever worked--and all of the wimmen who wuzn't engaged in scourin' and moppin' wuz a-settin' round in the pews a-workin' hard on articles for the fair--when all of a suddin the outside door opened and in come Josiah Allen with 3 of the other men bretheren.  They had jest got the great news of wimmen bein' apinted for Deaconesses, and had come down on the first minute to tell us. She that wuz Celestine Bobbet wuz the only female present that had heard of it.  Josiah had heard it to the post-office, and he couldn't wait till noon to tell me about it, and Deacon Gowdy wuz anxius Miss Gowdy should hear it as soon es possible. Deacon Sypher wanted his wife to know at once that if she wuzn't married she could have become a deaconess under his derectin'.  And Josiah wanted me to know immegietly that I, too, could have had the privilege if I had been a more single woman, of becomin' a deaconess, and have had the chance of workin' all my hull life for the meetin' house, with a man to direct my movements and take charge on me, and tell me what to do, from day to day and from hour to hour.  And Deacon Henzy was anxious Miss Henzy should get the news as quick as she could. So they all hastened down to the meetin' house to tell us.  And we left off our work for a minute to hear 'em. It wuzn't nowhere near time for us to go home.  Josiah had lots of further business to do in Jonesville and so had the other men. But the news had excited 'em, and exhilerated 'em so, that they had dropped everything, and hastened right down to tell us, and then they wuz a-goin' back agin immegietly.  I, myself, took the news coolly, or as cool as I could, with my temperature up to five or five and a half, owin' to the hard work and the heat.  [Illustration: THE LAST NEWS FROM THE CONFERENCE.]  Miss Gowdy also took it pretty calm. She leaned on her mop handle, partly for rest (for she was tuckered out) and partly out of good manners, and didn't say much.  But Miss Sypheris such a admirin'woman, she looked fairly radiant at the news, and she spoke up to her husband in her enthusiastik warm-hearted way--  \"Why, Deacon Sypher, is it possible that I, too, could become a deacon, jest like you?\"  \"No,\" sez Deacon Sypher solemnly, \"no, Drusilly, not like me. But you wimmen have got the privelege now, if you are single, of workin' all your days at church work under the direction of us men.\"  \"Then I could work at the Deacon trade under you,\" sez she admirin'ly, \"I could work jest like you--pass round the bread and wine and the contribution box Sundays?\"  \"Oh, no, Drusilly,\" sez he condesendinly, \"these hard and arjuous dutys belong to the male deaconship. That is their own one pertickiler work, that wimmen can't infringe upon. Their hull strength is spent in these duties, wimmen deacons have other fields of labor, such as relievin' the wants of the sick and sufferin', sittin' up nights with small-pox patients, takin' care of the sufferin' poor, etc., etc.\"  \"But,\" sez Miss Sypher (she is so good-hearted, and so awful fond of the deacon), \"wouldn't it be real sweet, Deacon, if you and I could work together as deacons, and tend the sick, relieve the sufferers--work for the good of the church together--go about doin' good?\"  \"No, Drusilly,\" sez he, \"that is wimmen's work. I would not wish for a moment to curtail the holy rights of wimmen. I wouldn't want to stand in her way, and keep her from doin' all this modest, un-pretendin' work, for which her weaker frame and less hefty brain has fitted her.  \"We will let it go on in the same old way. Let wimmen have the privelege of workin' hard, jest as she always has. Let her work all the time, day and night, and let men go on in the same sure old way of superentendin' her movements, guardin' her weaker footsteps, and bossin' her round generally.\"  Deacon Sypher is never happy in his choice of language, and his method of argiment is such that when he is up on the affirmative of a question, the negative is delighted, for they know he will bring victery to their side of the question. Now, he didn't mean to speak right out about men's usual way of bossin' wimmen round. It was only his unfortunate and transparent manner of speakin'.  And Deacon Bobbet hastened to cover up the remark by the statement that \"he wuz so highly tickled that wimmen wuzn't goin' to be admitted to the Conference, because it would _weaken_ the Conference.\"  \"Yes,\" sez my Josiah, a-leanin' up aginst the meetin' house door, and talkin' pretty loud, for Sister Peedick and me had gone to liftin' round the big bench by the door, and it wuz fearful heavy, and our minds wuz excersised as to the best place to put it while we wuz a-cleanin' the floor.  \"You see,\" sez he, \"we feel, we men do, we feel that it would be weakenin' to the Conference to have wimmen admitted, both on account of her own lack of strength and also from the fact that every woman you would admit would keep out a man. And that,\" sez he (a-leanin' back in a still easier attitude, almust a luxurious one), \"that, you see, would tend naterally to weakenin' the strength of a church.\"  [Illustration: \"WALL,\" SEZ I, \"MOVE ROUND A LITTLE, WON'T YOU, FOR WE WANT TO SET THE BENCH.\"]  \"Wall,\" sez I, a-pantin' hard for breath under my burden, \"move round a little, won't you, for we want to set the bench here while we scrub under it. And,\" sez I, a-stoppin' a minute and rubbin' the perspiratin and sweat offen my face, \"Seein' you men are all here, can't you lay holt and help us move out the benches, so we can clean the floor under 'em? Some of 'em are very hefty,\" sez I, \"and all of us Sisters almost are a-makin' soap, and we all want to get done here, so we can go home and bile down; we would dearly love a little help,\" sez I.  \"I would help,\" sez Josiah in a willin' tone, \"I would help in a minute, if I hadn't got so much work to do at home.\"  And all the other male bretheren said the same thing--they had got to git to get home to get to work. (Some on 'em wanted to play checkers, and I knew it.)  But some on 'em did have lots of work on their hands, I couldn't dispute it.     CHAPTER XXI.   Why, Deacon Henzy, besides all his cares about the buzz saw mill, and his farm work, had bought a steam threshin' machine that made him sights of work. It was a good machine. But it wuz fairly skairful to see it a-steamin' and a-blowin' right along the streets of Jonesville without the sign of a horse or ox or anything nigh it to draw it. A-puffin' out the steam, and a-tearin' right along, that awful lookin' that it skairt she that wuz Celestine Bobbet most into fits.  She lived in a back place where such machines wuz unknown, and she had come home to her father's on a visit, and wuz goin' over to visit some of his folks that day, over to Loontown.  And she wuz a-travellin' along peacible, with her father's old mair, and a-leanin' back in the buggy a readin' a article her father had sent over by her to Deacon Widrig, a witherin' article about female Deaconesses, and the stern necessity of settin' 'em apart and sanctifyen' 'em to this one work--deacon work--and how they mustn't marry, or tackle any other hard jobs whatsumever, or break off into any other enterprize, only jest plain deacon work.  It wuz a very flowery article. And she wuz enjoyin' of it first rate, and a-thinkin', for she is a little timid and easily skairt, and the piece had convinced her--  She wuz jest a-thinkin' how dretful it would be if sum female deaconess should ever venter into some other branch of business, and what would be"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9448"],["title","Samantha among the Brethren â€” Volume 6 (#1)"],["body",", by tellin' him that Ralph S. Robinson wuz a-layin' at death's door, and his life depended on his gettin' sleep, and we wuz afraid the bells in the mornin' would roust him up,  and I had come to see if he would omit the ringin' of 'em in the mornin'.  \"Not ring the bells!\" sez he, in wild amaze. \"Not ring the church bells on the Sabbath day?\"  His look wuz skairful in the extreme, but I sez--  \"Yes, that is what I said, we beg of you as a Christian to not ring the bells in the mornin'.\"  \"A Christian! A Christian! Advise me as a _Christian_ to not ring the Sabbath bells!\"  I see the idee skairt him. He wuz fairly pale with surprise and borrow. And I told him agin', puttin' in all the perticilers it needed to make the story straight and good, how Ralph S. Robinson had labored for the good of others, and how his strength had gin out, and he wuz now a-layin' at the very pint of death, and how his girl and his sister wuz a-breakin' their hearts over him, and how we had some hopes of savin' his life if he could get some sleep, that the doctors said his life depended on it, and agin I begged him to do what we asked.  But the Deacon had begin to get over bein' skairt, and he looked firm as anybody ever could, as he sez: \"The bells never hurt anybody, I know, for here I have lived right by the side of 'em for 20 years. Do I look broke down and weak?\" sez he.  \"No,\" sez I, honestly. \"No more than a grannit monument, or a steel trap.\"  \"Wall,\" sez he, \"what don't hurt me won't hurt nobody else.\"  \"But,\" sez I, \"folks are made up different.\" Sez I, \"The Bible sez so, and what might not hurt you, might be the ruin of somebody else. Wuz you ever nervous?\" sez I.  \"Never,\" sez he. And he added firmly, \"I don't believe in nerves. I never did. There hain't no use in 'm.\"  \"It wuz a wonder they wuz made, then,\" sez I. \"As a generel thing the Lord don't make things there hain't no use on. Howsumever,\" sez I, \"there hain't no use in disputin' back and forth on a nerve. But any way, sickness is so fur apart from health, that the conditions of one state can't be compared to the other; as Ralph S. Robinson is now, the sound of the bells, or any other loud noise means torture and agony to him, and, I am afraid, death. And I wish you would give orders to not have 'em rung in the mornin'.\"  \"Are you a professor?\" sez he.  \"Yes,\" sez I.  \"What perswaision?\" sez he.  \"Methodist Episcopal,\" sez I.  \"And do you, a member of a sister church, which, although it has many errors, is still a-gropin' after the light! Do you counsel me to set aside the sacred and time honored rules of our church, and allow the Sabbath to go by unregarded, have the sanctuary desecrated, the cause of religion languish--I cannot believe it. Think of the widespread desolation it would cause if, as the late lamented Mr. Selkirk sung:    \"'The sound of the church-going bells,   These valleys and hills never heard.'\"  \"No church, no sanctuary, no religius observances.\"  \"Why,\" sez I, \"that wouldn't hinder folks from goin' to church. Folks seem to get to theatres, lectures, and disolvin' views on time, and better time than they do to meetin',\" sez I. \"In your opinin' it hain't necessary to beat a drum and sound on a bugle as the Salvation Army duz, to call folks to meetin'; you are dretful hard on them, so I hear.\"  \"Yes, they make a senseless, vulgar, onnecessary racket, disturbin' and agrivatin' to saint and sinner.\"  \"But,\" sez I, \"they say they do it for the sake of religion.\"  \"Religion hain't to be found in drum-sticks,\" sez he bitterly.  \"No,\" sez I, \"nor in a bell clapper.\"  \"Oh,\" sez he, \"that is a different thing entirely, that is to call worshippers together, that is necessary.\"  Sez I, \"One hain't no more necessary than the other in my opinion.\"  Sez he, \"Look how fur back in the past the sweet bells have sounded out.\"  \"Yes,\" sez I candidly, \"and in the sweet past they wuz necessary,\" sez I. \"In the sweet past, there wuzn't a clock nor a watch, the houses wuz fur apart, and they needed bells. But now there hain't a house but what is runnin' over with clocks--everybody knows the time; they know it so much that time is fairly a drug to 'em. Why, they time themselves right along through the day, from breakfast to midnight. Time their meals, their business, their pleasures, their music, their lessons, their visits, their visitors, their pulse beats, and their dead beats. They time their joys and their sorrows, and everything and everybody, all through the week, and why should they stop short off Sundays? Why not time themselves on goin' to meetin'? They do, and you know it. There hain't no earthly need of the bells to tell the time to go to meetin', no more than there is to tell the time to put on the tea-kettle to get supper. If folks want to go to meetin' they will get there, bells or no bells, and if they don't want to go, bells hain't a-goin' to get 'em started.  \"Take a man with the Sunday _World_ jest brung in, a-layin' on a lounge, with his feet up in a chair, and kinder lazy in the first place, bells hain't a-goin' to start him.  \"And take a woman with her curl papers not took down, and a new religeus novel in her hand, and a miliner that disapinted her the night before, and bells hain't a-goin' to start her. No, the great bell of Moscow won't start 'em.  [Illustration: \"BELLS HAIN'T A-GOIN' TO START HIM.\"]  \"And take a good Christian woman, a widow, for instance, who loves church work, and has a good handsome Christian pasture, who is in trouble, lost his wife, mebby, or sunthin' else bad, and the lack of bells hain't a-goin' to keep that women back, no, not if there wuzn't a bell on earth.\"  \"Oh, wall, wavin' off that side of the subject,\" sez he (I had convinced him, I know, but he wouldn't own it, for he knew well that if folks wanted to go they always got there, bells or no bells). \"But,\" sez he wavin' off that side of the subject, \"the observance is so time honored, so hallowed by tender memories and associations all through the past.\"  \"Don't you 'spoze, Deacon Garven,\" sez I, \"that I know every single emotion them bells can bring to anybody, and felt all those memorys and associations. I'll bet, or I wouldn't be afraid to bet, if I believed in bettin', that there hain't a single emotion in the hull line of emotions that the sound of them bells can wake up, but what I have felt, and felt 'em deep too, jest as deep as anybody ever did, and jest es many of 'em. But it is better for me to do without a upliftin', soarin' sort of a feelin' ruther than have other people suffer agony.\"  \"Agony!\" sez he, \"talk about their causin' agony, when there hain't a more heavenly sound on earth.\"  [Illustration: \"A-LEANIN' OVER THE FRONT GATE ON A STILL SPRING MORNIN'.\"]  \"So it has been to me,\" sez I candidly. \"To me they have always sounded beautiful, heavenly. Why,\" sez I, a-lookin' kinder fur off, beyond Deacon Garven, and all other troubles, as thoughts of beauty and insperation come to me borne out of  the past into my very soul, by the tender memories of the bells--thoughts of the great host of believers who had gathered together at the sound of the bells--the great army of the Redeemed--    'Some of the host have crossed the flood, and some   are crossin' now,'  thinks I a-lookin' way off in a almost rapped way. And then I sez to Deacon Garven in a low soft voice, lower and more softer fur, than I had used to him,  \"Don't I know what it is to stand a-leanin' over the front gate on a still spring mornin', the smell of the lilacs in the air, and the brier roses. A dew sparklin' on the grass under the maples, and the sunshine a-fleckin' the ground between 'em, and the robins a-singin' and the hummin' birds a-hoverin' round the honeysuckles at the door. And over all and through all, and above all clear and sweet, comin' from fur off a-floatin' through the Sabbath stillness, the sound of the bells, a-bringin' to us sweet Sabbath messages of love and joy. Bringin' memories too, of other mornin's as fair and sweet, when other ears listened with us to the sound, other eyes looked out on the summer beauty, and smiled at the sound of the bells. Heavenly emotions, sweet emotions come to me on the melody of the bells, peaceful thoughts, inspirin' thoughts of the countless multitude that has flocked together at the sound of the bells. The aged feet, the eager youthful feet, the children's feet, all, all walkin' to the sound of the bells. Thoughts of the happy youthful feet that set out to walk side by side, at their ringin' sounds. Thoughts of the aged ones grown tired, and goin' to their long dreamless sleep to their solemn sound. Thoughts of the brave hero's who set out to protect us with their lives while the bells wuz ringin' out their approval of such deeds. Thoughts of how they pealed out joyfully on their return bearin' the form of Peace. Thoughts of how the bells filled the mornin' and evenin' air, havin' throbbed and beat with every joy and every pain of our life, till they seem a part of us (as it were) and the old world would truly seem lonesome without 'em.  \"As I told you, and told you truly, I don't believe there is a single emotion in the hull line of emotions, fur or near, but what them bells have rung into my very soul.  \"But such emotions, beautiful and inspirin' though they are, can be dispensed with better than justice and mercy can. Sweet and tender sentiment is dear to me, truly, near and dear, but mercy and pity and common sense, have also a powerful grip onto my right arm, and have to lead me round a good deal of the time.  \"Beautiful emotion, when it stands opposed to eternal justice, ort to step gently aside and let justice have a free road. Sentiment is truly sweet, but any one can get along without it, take it right along through the year, better than they can without sleep.  \"You see if you can't sleep you must die, while a person can worry along a good many years without sentiment. Or, that is, I have been told they could. I don't know"]]]
