I saw her no more, but soon afterwards found Mr. Wigglesworth cutting her virgin name into the stone which she had chosen.  “She is dead,--poor girl,” said he, interrupting the tune which he was whistling, “and she chose a good piece of stuff for her headstone. Now which of these slabs would you like best to see your own name upon?”  “Why, to tell you the truth, my good Mr. Wigglesworth,” replied I, after a moment’s pause,--for the abruptness of the question had somewhat startled me,--“to be quite sincere with you, I care little or nothing about a stone for my own grave, and am somewhat inclined to scepticism as to the propriety of erecting monuments at all, over the dust that once was human.  The weight of these heavy marbles, though unfelt by the dead corpse of the enfranchised soul, presses drearily upon the spirit of the survivor, and causes him to connect the idea of death with the dungeon-like imprisonment of the tomb, instead of with the freedom of the skies.  Every gravestone that you ever made is the visible symbol of a mistaken system.  Our thoughts should soar upward with the butterfly,--not linger with the exuviae that confined him. In truth and reason, neither those whom we call the living, and still less the departed, have anything to do with the grave.”  “I never heard anything so heathenish!” said Mr. Wigglesworth, perplexed and displeased at sentiments which controverted all his notions and feelings, and implied the utter waste, and worse, of his whole life’s labor; “would you forget your dead friends, the moment they are under the sod?”  “They are not under the sod,” I rejoined; “then why should I mark the spot where there is no treasure hidden!  Forget them?  No! But to remember them aright, I would forget what they have cast off.  And, to gain the truer conception of DEATH, I would forget them GRAVE!”  But still the good old sculptor murmured, and stumbled, as it were, over the gravestones amid which he had walked through life. Whether he were right or wrong, I had grown the wiser from our companionship and from my observations of nature and character, as displayed by those who came, with their old griefs or their new ones, to get them recorded upon his slabs of marble.  And yet, with my gain of wisdom, I had likewise gained perplexity; for there was a strange doubt in my mind, whether the dark shadowing of this life, the sorrows and regrets, have not as much real comfort in them--leaving religious influences out of the question--as what we term life’s joys."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9216"],["title","Beneath an Umbrella (From \"Twice Told Tales\") (#1)"],["body","wealth and poverty are intermingled, presenting a range of strongly contrasted pictures.  Here, too, may be found the golden mean.  Through yonder casement I discern a family circle,--the grandmother, the parents, and the children,--all flickering, shadow-like, in the glow of a wood-fire. Bluster, fierce blast, and beat, thou wintry rain, against the window-panes!  Ye cannot damp the enjoyment of that fireside. Surely my fate is hard, that I should be wandering homeless here, taking to my bosom night, and storm, and solitude, instead of wife and children. Peace, murmurer!  Doubt not that darker guests are sitting round the hearth, though the warm blaze hides all but blissful images.  Well; here is still a brighter scene. A stately mansion, illuminated for a ball, with cut-glass chandeliers and alabaster lamps in every room, and sunny landscapes hanging round the walls.  See! a coach has stopped, whence emerges a slender beauty, who, canopied by two umbrellas, glides within the portal, and vanishes amid lightsome thrills of music.  Will she ever feel the night-wind and the rain? Perhaps,--perhaps!  And will Death and Sorrow ever enter that proud mansion?  As surely as the dancers will be gay within its halls to-night.  Such thoughts sadden, yet satisfy my heart; for they teach me that the poor man, in his mean, weather-beaten hovel, without a fire to cheer him, may call the rich his brother, brethren by Sorrow, who must be an inmate of both their households,--brethren by Death, who will lead them, both to other homes.  Onward, still onward, I plunge into the night.  Now have I reached the utmost limits of the town, where the last lamp struggles feebly with the darkness, like the farthest star that stands sentinel on the borders of uncreated space.  It is strange what sensations of sublimity may spring from a very humble source.  Such are suggested by this hollow roar of a subterranean cataract, where the mighty stream of a kennel precipitates itself beneath an iron grate, and is seen no more on earth.  Listen awhile to its voice of mystery; and fancy will magnify it, till you start and smile at the illusion.  And now another sound,--the rumbling of wheels,--as the mail-coach, outward bound, rolls heavily off the pavements, and splashes through the mud and water of the road.  All night long, the poor passengers will be tossed to and fro between drowsy watch and troubled sleep, and will dream of their own quiet beds, and awake to find themselves still jolting onward.  Happier my lot, who will straightway hie me to my familiar room, and toast myself comfortably before the fire, musing, and fitfully dozing, and fancying a strangeness in such sights as all may see.  But first let me gaze at this solitary figure, who comes hitherward with a tin lantern, which throws the circular pattern of its punched holes on the ground about him. He passes fearlessly into the unknown gloom, whither I will not follow him.  This figure shall supply me with a moral, wherewith, for lack of a more appropriate one, I may wind up my sketch.  He fears not to tread the dreary path before him, because his lantern, which was kindled at the fireside of his home, will light him back to that same fireside again.  And thus we, night-wanderers through a stormy and dismal world, if we bear the lamp of Faith, enkindled at a celestial fire, it will surely lead us home to that Heaven whence its radiance was borrowed."]]]
