Holy crosse!\" [161]  He divined at once that the Welch were storming the Saxon hold.  Short time indeed sufficed for that active knight to case himself in his mail; and, sword in hand, he burst through the door, cleared the stairs, and gained the hall below, which was filled with men arming in haste.  \"Where is Harold?\" he exclaimed.  \"On the trenches already,\" answered Sexwolf, buckling his corslet of hide.  \"This Welch hell hath broke loose.\"  \"And you are their beacon-fires?  Then the whole land is upon us!\"  \"Prate less,\" quoth Sexwolf; \"those are the hills now held by the warders of Harold: our spies gave them notice, and the watch-fires prepared us ere the fiends came in sight, otherwise we had been lying here limbless or headless.  Now, men, draw up, and march forth.\"  \"Hold! hold!\" cried the pious knight, crossing himself, \"is there no priest here to bless us? first a prayer and a psalm!\"  \"Prayer and psalm!\" cried Sexwolf, astonished, \"an thou hadst said ale and mead, I could have understood thee.--Out! Out!--Holyrood, Holyrood!\"  \"The godless paynims!\" muttered the Norman, borne away with the crowd.  Once in the open space, the scene was terrific.  Brief as had been the onslaught the carnage was already unspeakable.  By dint of sheer physical numbers, animated by a valour that seemed as the frenzy of madmen or the hunger of wolves, hosts of the Britons had crossed trench and stream, seizing with their hands the points of the spears opposed to them, bounding over the corpses of their countrymen, and with yells of wild joy rushing upon the close serried lines drawn up before the fort.  The stream seemed literally to run gore; pierced by javelins and arrows, corpses floated and vanished, while numbers, undeterred by the havoc, leaped into the waves from the opposite banks.  Like bears that surround the ship of a sea-king beneath the polar meteors, or the midnight sun of the north, came the savage warriors through that glaring atmosphere.  Amidst all, two forms were pre-eminent: the one, tall and towering, stood by the trench, and behind a banner, that now drooped round the stave, now streamed wide and broad, stirred by the rush of men--for the night in itself was breezeless.  With a vast Danish axe wielded by both hands, stood this man, confronting hundreds, and at each stroke, rapid as the levin, fell a foe.  All round him was a wall of his own-- the dead.  But in the centre of the space, leading on a fresh troop of shouting Welchmen who had forced their way from another part, was a form which seemed charmed against arrow and spear.  For the defensive arms of this chief were as slight as if worn but for ornament: a small corselet of gold covered only the centre of his breast, a gold collar of twisted wires circled his throat, and a gold bracelet adorned his bare arm, dropping gore, not his own, from the wrist to the elbow.  He was small and slight-shaped--below the common standard of men--but he seemed as one made a giant by the sublime inspiration of war.  He wore no helmet, merely a golden circlet; and his hair, of deep red (longer than was usual with the Welch), hung like the mane of a lion over his shoulders, tossing loose with each stride.  His eyes glared like the tiger's at night, and he leaped on the spears with a bound.  Lost a moment amidst hostile ranks, save by the swift glitter of his short sword, he made, amidst all, a path for himself and his followers, and emerged from the heart of the steel unscathed and loud-breathing; while, round the line he had broken, wheeled and closed his wild men, striking, rushing, slaying, slain.  \"Pardex, this is war worth the sharing,\" said the knight.  \"And now, worthy Sexwolf, thou shalt see if the Norman is the vaunter thou deemest him.  Dieu nous aide!  Notre Dame!--Take the foe in the rear.\" But turning round, he perceived that Sexwolf had already led his men towards the standard, which showed them where stood the Earl, almost alone in his peril.  The knight, thus left to himself, did not hesitate:--a minute more, and he was in the midst of the Welch force, headed by the chief with the golden panoply.  Secure in his ring mail against the light weapons of the Welch, the sweep of the Norman sword was as the scythe of Death.  Right and left he smote through the throng which he took in the flank, and had almost gained the small phalanx of Saxons, that lay firm in the midst, when the Cymrian Chief's flashing eye was drawn to his new and strange foe, by the roar and the groan round the Norman's way; and with the half-naked breast against the shirt of mail, and the short Roman sword against the long Norman falchion, the Lion King of Wales fronted the knight.  Unequal as seems the encounter, so quick was the spring of the Briton, so pliant his arm, and so rapid his weapon, that that good knight (who rather from skill and valour than brute physical strength, ranked amongst the prowest of William's band of martial brothers) would willingly have preferred to see before him Fitzosborne or Montgommeri, all clad in steel and armed with mace and lance, than parried those dazzling strokes, and fronted the angry majesty of that helmless brow. Already the strong rings of his mail had been twice pierced, and his blood trickled fast, while his great sword had but smitten the air in its sweeps at the foe; when the Saxon phalanx, taking advantage of the breach in the ring that girt them, caused by this diversion, and recognising with fierce ire the gold torque and breastplate of the Welch King, made their desperate charge.  Then for some minutes the pele mele was confused and indistinct--blows blind and at random-- death coming no man knew whence or how; till discipline and steadfast order (which the Saxons kept, as by mechanism, through the discord) obstinately prevailed.  The wedge forced its way; and, though reduced in numbers and sore wounded, the Saxon troop cleared the ring, and joined the main force drawn up by the fort, and guarded in the rear by its wall.  Meanwhile Harold, supported by the band under Sexwolf, had succeeded at length in repelling farther reinforcements of the Welch at the more accessible part of the trenches; and casting now his practised eye over the field, he issued orders for some of the men to regain the fort, and open from the battlements, and from every loophole, the batteries of stone and javelin, which then (with the Saxons, unskilled in sieges,) formed the main artillery of forts.  These orders given, he planted Sexwolf and most of his band to keep watch round the trenches; and shading his eye with his hand, and looking towards the moon, all waning and dimmed in the watchfires, he said, calmly, \"Now patience fights for us.  Ere the moon reaches yon hill-top, the troops of Aber and Caer-hen will be on the slopes of Penmaen, and cut off the retreat of the Walloons.  Advance my flag to the thick of yon strife.\"  But as the Earl, with his axe swung over his shoulder, and followed but by some half-score or more with his banner, strode on where the wild war was now mainly concentred, just midway between trench and fort, Gryffyth caught sight both of the banner and the Earl, and left the press at the very moment when he had gained the greatest advantage; and when indeed, but for the Norman, who, wounded as he was, and unused to fight on foot, stood resolute in the van, the Saxons, wearied out by numbers, and falling fast beneath the javelins, would have fled into their walls, and so sealed their fate,--for the Welch would have entered at their heels.  But it was the misfortune of the Welch heroes never to learn that war is a science; and instead of now centering all force on the point most weakened, the whole field vanished from the fierce eye of the Welch King, when he saw the banner and form of Harold.  The Earl beheld the coming foe, wheeling round, as the hawk on the heron;--halted, drew up his few men in a semicircle, with their large shields as a rampart, and their levelled spears as a palisade; and before them all, as a tower, stood Harold with his axe.  In a minute more he was surrounded; and through the rain of javelins that poured upon him, hissed and glittered the sword of Gryffyth.  But Harold, more practised than the Sire de Graville in the sword-play of the Welch, and unencumbered by other defensive armour (save only the helm, which was shaped like the Norman's,) than his light coat of hide, opposed quickness to quickness, and suddenly dropping his axe, sprang upon his foe, and clasping him round with his left arm, with the right hand griped at his throat:  \"Yield and quarter!--yield, for thy life, son of Llewellyn!\"  Strong was that embrace, and deathlike that gripe; yet, as the snake from the hand of the dervise--as a ghost from the grasp of the dreamer, the lithe Cymrian glided away, and the broken torque was all that remained in the clutch of Harold.  At this moment a mighty yell of despair broke from the Welch near the fort: stones and javelins rained upon them from the walls, and the fierce Norman was in the midst, with his sword drinking blood; but not for javelin, stone, and sword, shrank and shouted the Welchmen.  On the other side of the trenches were marching against them their own countrymen, the rival tribes that helped the stranger to rend the land: and far to the right were seen the spears of the Saxon from Aber, and to the left was heard the shout of the forces under Godrith from Caer-hen; and they who had sought the leopard in his lair were now themselves the prey caught in the toils.  With new heart, as they beheld these reinforcements, the Saxons pressed on; tumult, and flight, and indiscriminate slaughter, wrapped the field.  The Welch rushed to the stream and the trenches; and in the bustle and hurlabaloo, Gryffyth was swept along, as a bull by a torrent; still facing the foe, now chiding, now smiting his own men, now rushing alone on the pursuers, and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7678"],["title","Harold : the Last of the Saxon Kings â€” Volume 07 (#2)"],["body","their onslaught, he gained, still unwounded, the stream, paused a moment, laughed loud, and sprang into the wave.  A hundred javelins hissed into the sullen and bloody waters.  \"Hold!\" cried Harold the Earl, lifting his hand on high, \"No dastard dart at the brave!\"     CHAPTER IV.   The fugitive Britons, scarce one-tenth of the number that had first rushed to the attack,--performed their flight with the same Parthian rapidity that characterised the assault; and escaping both Welch foe and Saxon, though the former broke ground to pursue them, they gained the steeps of Penmaen.  There was no further thought of slumber that night within the walls. While the wounded were tended, and the dead were cleared from the soil, Harold, with three of his chiefs, and Mallet de Graville, whose feats rendered it more than ungracious to refuse his request that he might assist in the council, conferred upon the means of terminating the war with the next day.  Two of the thegns, their blood hot with strife and revenge, proposed to scale the mountain with the whole force the reinforcements had brought them, and put all they found to the sword.  The third, old and prudent, and inured to Welch warfare, thought otherwise.  \"None of us,\" said he, \"know what is the true strength of the place which ye propose to storm.  Not even one Welchman have we found who hath ever himself gained the summit, or examined the castle which is said to exist there.\" [162]  \"Said!\" echoed De Graville, who, relieved of his mail, and with his wounds bandaged, reclined on his furs on the floor.  \"Said, noble sir! Cannot our eyes perceive the towers?\"  The old thegn shook his head.  \"At a distance, and through mists, stones loom large, and crags themselves take strange shapes.  It may be castle, may be rock, may be old roofless temples of heathenesse that we see.  But to repeat (and, as I am slow, I pray not again to be put out in my speech)--none of us know what, there, exists of defence, man-made or Nature-built.  Not even thy Welch spies, son of Godwin, have gained to the heights.  In the midst lie the scouts of the Welch King, and those on the top can see the bird fly, the goat climb.  Few of thy spies, indeed, have ever returned with life; their heads have been left at the foot of the hill, with the scroll in their lips,-- 'Dic ad inferos--quid in superis novisti.'  Tell to the shades below what thou hast seen in the heights above.\"  \"And the Walloons know Latin!\" muttered the knight; \"I respect them!\"  The slow thegn frowned, stammered, and renewed:  \"One thing at least is clear; that the rock is well nigh insurmountable to those who know not the passes; that strict watch, baffling even Welch spies, is kept night and day; that the men on the summit are desperate and fierce; that our own troops are awed and terrified by the belief of the Welch, that the spot is haunted and the towers fiend-founded.  One single defeat may lose us two years of victory.  Gryffyth may break from the eyrie, regain what he hath lost, win back our Welch allies, ever faithless and hollow.  Wherefore, I say, go on as we have begun.  Beset all the country round; cut off all supplies, and let the foe rot by famine--or waste, as he hath done this night, his strength by vain onslaught and sally.\"  \"Thy counsel is good,\" said Harold, \"but there is yet something to add to it, which may shorten the strife, and gain the end with less sacrifice of life.  The defeat of tonight will have humbled the spirits of the Welch; take them yet in the hour of despair and disaster.  I wish, therefore, to send to their outposts a nuncius, with these terms: 'Life and pardon to all who lay down arms and surrender.'\"  \"What, after such havoc and gore?\" cried one of the thegns.  \"They defend their own soil,\" replied the Earl simply: \"had not we done the same?\"  \"But the rebel Gryffyth?\" asked the old thegn, \"thou canst not accept him again as crowned sub-king of Edward?\"  \"No,\" said the Earl, \"I propose to exempt Gryffyth alone from the pardon, with promise, natheless, of life if he give himself up as prisoner; and count, without further condition, on the King's mercy.\" There was a prolonged silence.  None spoke against the Earl's proposal, though the two younger thegns misliked it much.  At last said the elder, \"But hast thou thought who will carry this message?  Fierce and wild are yon blood-dogs; and man must needs shrive soul and make will, if he will go to their kennel.\"  \"I feel sure that my bode will be safe,\" answered Harold: for Gryffyth has all the pride of a king, and, sparing neither man nor child in the onslaught, will respect what the Roman taught his sires to respect-- envoy from chief to chief--as a head scatheless and sacred.\"  \"Choose whom thou wilt, Harold,\" said one of the young thegns, laughing, \"but spare thy friends; and whomsoever thou choosest, pay his widow the weregeld.\"  \"Fair sirs,\" then said De Graville, \"if ye think that I, though a stranger, could serve you as nuncius, it would be a pleasure to me to undertake this mission.  First, because, being curious as concerns forts and castles, I would fain see if mine eyes have deceived me in taking yon towers for a hold of great might.  Secondly, because that same wild-cat of a king must have a court rare to visit.  And the only reflection that withholds my pressing the offer as a personal suit is, that though I have some words of the Breton jargon at my tongue's need, I cannot pretend to be a Tully in Welch; howbeit, since it seems that one, at least, among them knows something of Latin, I doubt not but what I shall get out my meaning!\"  \"Nay, as to that, Sire de Graville,\" said Harold, who seemed well pleased with the knight's offer, \"there shall be no hindrance or let, as I will make clear to you; and in spite of what you have just heard, Gryffyth shall harm you not in limb or in life.  But, kindly and courteous Sir, will your wounds permit the journey, not long, but steep and laborious, and only to be made on foot?\"  \"On foot!\" said the knight, a little staggered, \"Pardex! well and truly, I did not count upon that!\"  \"Enough,\" said Harold, turning away in evident disappointment, \"think of it no more.\"  \"Nay, by your leave, what I have once said I stand to,\" returned the knight; \"albeit, you may as well cleave in two one of those respectable centaurs of which we have read in our youth, as part Norman and horse.  I will forthwith go to my chamber, and apparel myself becomingly--not forgetting, in case of the worst, to wear my mail under my robe.  Vouchsafe me but an armourer, just to rivet up the rings through which scratched so felinely the paw of that well- appelled Griffin.\"  \"I accept your offer frankly,\" said Harold, \"and all shall be prepared for you, as soon as you yourself will re-seek me here.\"  The knight rose, and though somewhat stiff and smarting with his wounds, left the room lightly, summoned his armourer and squire, and having dressed with all the care and pomp habitual to a Norman, his gold chain round his neck, and his vest stiff with broidery, he re- entered the apartment of Harold.  The Earl received him alone, and came up to him with a cordial face.  \"I thank thee more, brave Norman, than I ventured to say before my thegns, for I tell thee frankly, that my intent and aim are to save the life of this brave king; and thou canst well understand that every Saxon amongst us must have his blood warmed by contest, and his eyes blind with national hate.  You alone, as a stranger, see the valiant warrior and hunted prince, and as such you can feel for him the noble pity of manly foes.\"  \"That is true,\" said De Graville, a little surprised, \"though we Normans are at least as fierce as you Saxons, when we have once tasted blood; and I own nothing would please me better than to dress that catamaran in mail, put a spear in its claws, and a horse under its legs, and thus fight out my disgrace at being so clawed and mauled by its griffes.  And though I respect a brave knight in distress, I can scarce extend my compassion to a thing that fights against all rule, martial and kingly.\"  The Earl smiled gravely.  \"It is the mode in which his ancestors rushed on the spears of Caesar.  Pardon him.\"  \"I pardon him, at your gracious request,\" quoth the knight, with a grand air, and waving his hands; \"say on.\"  \"You will proceed with a Welch monk--whom, though not of the faction of Gryffyth, all Welchmen respect--to the mouth of a frightful pass, skirting the river; the monk will bear aloft the holy rood in signal of peace.  Arrived at that pass, you will doubtless be stopped.  The monk here will be spokesman; and ask safe-conduct to Gryffyth to deliver my message; he will also bear certain tokens, which will no doubt win the way for you.\"  \"Arrived before Gryffyth, the monk will accost him; mark and heed well his gestures, since thou wilt know not the Welch tongue he employs. And when he raises the rood, thou,--in the mean while, having artfully approached close to Gryffyth,--wilt whisper in Saxon, which he well understands, and pressing the ring I now give thee into his hand, 'Obey, by this pledge; thou knowest Harold is true, and thy head is sold by thine own people.'  If he asks more thou knowest nought.\"  \"So far, this is as should be from chief to chief,\" said the Norman, touched, \"and thus had Fitzosborne done to his foe.  I thank thee for this mission, and the more that thou hast not asked me to note the strength of the bulwark, and number the men that may keep it.\"  Again Harold smiled.  \"Praise me not for this, noble Norman--we plain Saxons have not your refinements.  If ye are led to the summit, which I think ye will not be, the monk at least will have eyes to see, and tongue to relate.  But to thee I confide this much;--I know already, that Gryffyth's strongholds are not his walls and his towers, but the superstition of our men, and the despair of his own.  I could win those heights, as I have won heights as"]]]
