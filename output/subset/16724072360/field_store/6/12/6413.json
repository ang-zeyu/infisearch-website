There was an Old Man of Kamschatka,                Who possessed a remarkably fat cur,                His gait and his waddle,                Were held as a model,                To all the fat dogs in Kamschatka.     83.

There was an Old Person of Anerley,                Whose conduct was strange and unmannerly;                He rushed down the Strand,                With a Pig in each hand,                But returned in the evening to Anerley.     88.

There was an Old Person of Spain,                Who hated all trouble and pain;                So he sate on a chair,                With his feet in the air,                That umbrageous Old Person of Spain.     91.                 There was a Young Lady of Russia,                Who screamed so that no one could hush her;                Her screams were extreme,                No one heard such a scream,                As was screamed by that Lady of Russia.     92.                 There was an Old Man, who said, \"Well!                Will NOBODY answer this bell?                I have pulled day and night,                Till my hair has grown white,                But nobody answers this bell!\"     93.

There was a Young Lady of Welling,                Whose praise all the world was a-telling;                She played on the harp,                And caught several carp,                That accomplished Young Lady of Welling.     96.                 There was an Old Person of Tartary,                Who divided his jugular artery;                But he screeched to his wife,                And she said, \"Oh, my life!                Your death will be felt by all Tartary!\"     97.                 There was an old Person of Chester,                Whom several small children did pester;                They threw some large stones,                Which broke most of his bones,                And displeased that old person of Chester.     98.                 There was an Old Man with an owl,                Who continued to bother and howl;                He sate on a rail,                And imbibed bitter ale,                Which refreshed that Old Man and his owl.     99.                 There was an Old Person of Gretna,                Who rushed down the crater of Etna;                When they said, \"Is it hot?\"                He replied, \"No, it's not!\"                That mendacious Old Person of Gretna.     100.                 There was a Young Lady of Sweden,                Who went by the slow train to Weedon;                When they cried, \"Weedon Station!\"                She made no observation,                But thought she should go back to Sweden.     101.                 There was a Young Girl of Majorca,                Whose aunt was a very fast walker;                She walked seventy miles,                And leaped fifteen stiles,                Which astonished that Girl of Majorca.     102.                 There was an Old Man of the Cape,                Who possessed a large Barbary Ape;                Till the Ape one dark night,                Set the house on a light,                Which burned that Old Man of the Cape.     103.                 There was an Old Lady of Prague,                Whose language was horribly vague;                When they said, \"Are these caps?\"                She answered, \"Perhaps!\"                That oracular Lady of Prague.     104.                 There was an Old Person of Sparta,                Who had twenty-five sons and one daughter;                He fed them on snails,                And weighed them in scales,                That wonderful person of Sparta.     105.                 There was an Old Man at a easement,                Who held up his hands in amazement;                When they said, \"Sir, you'll fall!\"                He replied, \"Not at all!\"                That incipient Old Man at a casement.     106.                 There was an old Person of Burton,                Whose answers were rather uncertain;                When they said, \"How d'ye do?\"                He replied, \"Who are you?\"                That distressing old person of Burton.     107.                 There was an Old Person of Ems,                Who casually fell in the Thames;                And when he was found,                They said he was drowned,                That unlucky Old Person of Ems.     108.                 There was an Old Person of Ewell,                Who chiefly subsisted on gruel;                But to make it more nice,                He inserted some mice,                Which refreshed that Old Person of Ewell.     109.                 There was a Young Lady of Parma,                Whose conduct grew calmer and calmer;                When they said, \"Are you dumb?\"                She merely said, \"Hum!\"                That provoking Young Lady of Parma.     110.                 There was an Old Man of Aosta,                Who possessed a large Cow, but he lost her;                But they said, \"Don't you see,                She has rushed up a tree?                You invidious Old Man of Aosta!\"     111.                 There was an Old Man, on whose nose,                Most birds of the air could repose;                But they all flew away,                At the closing of day,                Which relieved that Old Man and his nose.     112.                 There was a Young Lady of Clare,                Who was sadly pursued by a bear;                When she found she was tired,                She abruptly expired,                That unfortunate Lady of Clare."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9822"],["title","Mrs. Mary Robinson, Written (#1)"],["body","for better fortune lavishing favours on unworthy objects, gratifying the avarice of ignorance and dulness, while I, who sacrificed reputation, an advantageous profession, friends, patronage, the brilliant hours of youth, and the conscious delight of correct conduct, am condemned to the scanty pittance bestowed on every indifferent page who holds up his ermined train of ceremony?  \"You will say, 'Why trouble me with all this?' I answer, 'Because when I am at peace, you may be in possession of my real sentiments and defend my cause when I shall not have the power of doing it.'  \"My comedy has been long in the hands of a manager, but whether it will ever be brought forward time must decide. You know, my dear friend, what sort of authors have lately been patronised by managers; their pieces ushered to public view, with all the advantages of splendour; yet I am obliged to wait two long years without a single hope that a trial would be granted. Oh, I am tired of the world and all its mortifications. I promise you this shall close my chapters of complaints. Keep them, and remember how ill I have been treated.\"  Eight days later she wrote to the same friend:  \"In wretched spirits I wrote you last week a most melancholy letter. Your kind answer consoled me. The balsam of pure and disinterested friendship never fails to cure the mind's sickness, particularly when it proceeds from disgust at the ingratitude of the world.\"  The play to which she referred was probably that mentioned in the sequel to her memoirs, which was unhappily a failure. It is notable that the principal character in the farce was played by Mrs. Jordan, who was later to become the victim of a royal prince, who left her to die in poverty and exile.  The letter of another great actress, Sarah Siddons, written to John Taylor, shows kindness and compassion toward Perdita.  \"I am very much obliged to Mrs. Robinson,\" says Mrs. Siddons, \"for her polite attention in sending me her poems. Pray tell her so with my compliments. I hope the poor, charming woman has quite recovered from her fall. If she is half as amiable as her writings, I shall long for the possibility of being acquainted with her. I say the possibility, because one's whole life is one continual sacrifice of inclinations, which to indulge, however laudable or innocent, would draw down the malice and reproach of those prudent people who never do ill, 'but feed and sleep and do observances to the stale ritual of quaint ceremony.' The charming and beautiful Mrs. Robinson: I pity her from the bottom of my soul.\"  Almost to the last she retained her beauty, and delighted in receiving her friends and learning from them news of the world in which she could no longer move. Reclining on her sofa in the little drawing-room of her house in St. James's Place, she was the centre of a circle which comprised many of those who had surrounded her in the days of her brilliancy, amongst them being the Prince of Wales and his brother the Duke of York.  Possibly, for the former, memory lent her a charm which years had not utterly failed to dispel.  J. Fitzgerald Molloy.

MARY ROBINSON   At the period when the ancient city of Bristol was besieged by Fairfax's army, the troops being stationed on a rising ground in the vicinity of the suburbs, a great part of the venerable minster was destroyed by the cannonading before Prince Rupert surrendered to the enemy; and the beautiful Gothic structure, which at this moment fills the contemplative mind with melancholy awe, was reduced to but little more than one-half of the original fabric. Adjoining to the consecrated hill, whose antique tower resists the ravages of time, once stood a monastery of monks of the order of St. Augustine. This building formed a part of the spacious boundaries which fell before the attacks of the enemy, and became a part of the ruin, which never was repaired or re-raised to its former Gothic splendours.  On this spot was built a private house, partly of simple, and partly of modern architecture. The front faced a small garden, the gates of which opened to the Minster Green (now called the College Green); the west side was bounded by the cathedral, and the back was supported by the ancient cloisters of St. Augustine's monastery. A spot more calculated to inspire the soul with mournful meditation can scarcely be found amidst the monuments of antiquity.  In this venerable mansion there was one chamber whose dismal and singular constructure left no doubt of its having been a part of the original monastery. It was supported by the mouldering arches of the cloisters, dark, Gothic, and opening on the minster sanctuary, not only by casement windows that shed a dim midday gloom, but by a narrow winding staircase, at the foot of which an iron-spiked door led to the long gloomy path of cloistered solitude. This place remained in the situation in which I describe it in the year 1776, and probably may, in a more ruined state, continue so to this hour.  In this awe-inspiring habitation, which I shall henceforth denominate the Minster House, during a tempestuous night, on the 27th of November, 1758, I first opened my eyes to this world of duplicity and sorrow. I have often heard my mother say that a mare stormy hour she never remembered. The wind whistled round the dark pinnacles of the minster tower, and the rain beat in torrents against the casements of her chamber. Through life the tempest has followed my footsteps, and I have in vain looked for a short interval of repose from the perseverance of sorrow.  In the male line I am descended from a respectable family in Ireland, the original name of which was MacDermott. From an Irish estate, my great-grandfather changed it to that of Darby. My father, who was born in America, was a man of strong mind, high spirit, and great personal intrepidity. Many anecdotes, well authenticated, and which, being irrefragable, are recorded as just tributes to his fame and memory, shall, in the course of these memoirs, confirm this assertion.  My mother was the grandchild of Catherine Seys, one of the daughters and co-heiresses of Richard Sey's, Esq., of Boverton Castle, in Glamorganshire. The sister of my great-grandmother, named Anne, married Peter, Lord King, who was nephew, in the female line, to the learned and truly illustrious John Locke--a name that has acquired celebrity which admits of no augmented panegyric.  Catherine Seys was a woman of great piety and virtue--a character which she transferred to her daughter, and which has also been acknowledged as justly due to her sister, Lady King.[1] She quitted this life when my grandmother was yet a child, leaving an only daughter, whose father also died while she was in her infancy. By this privation of paternal care my grandmother became the _élève_ of her mother's father, and passed the early part of her life at the family castle in Glamorganshire. From this period till the marriage of my mother, I can give but a brief account. All I know is, that my grandmother, though wedded unhappily, to the latest period of her existence was a woman of amiable and simple manners, unaffected piety, and exemplary virtue. I remember her well; and I speak not only from report, but from my own knowledge. She died in the year 1780.  My grandmother Elizabeth, whom I may, without the vanity of consanguinity, term a truly good woman, in the early part of her life devoted much of her time to botanic study. She frequently passed many successive months with Lady Tynt, of Haswell, in Somersetshire, who was her godmother, and who was the Lady Bountiful of the surrounding villages. Animated by so distinguished an example, the young Elizabeth, who was remarkably handsome,[2] took particular delight in visiting the old, the indigent, and the infirm, resident within many miles of Haswell, and in preparing such medicines as were useful to the maladies of the peasantry. She was the village doctress, and, with her worthy godmother, seldom passed a day without exemplifying the benevolence of her nature.  My mother was born at Bridgwater, in Somersetshire, in the house near the bridge, which is now occupied by Jonathan Chub, Esq., a relation of my beloved and lamented parent, and a gentleman who, to acknowledged worth and a powerful understanding, adds a superior claim to attention by all the acquirements of a scholar and a philosopher.  My mother, who never was what may be called a handsome woman, had nevertheless, in her youth, a peculiarly neat figure, and a vivacity of manner which obtained her many suitors. Among others, a young gentleman of good family, of the name of Storr, paid his addresses. My father was the object of my mother's choice, though her relations rather wished her to form a matrimonial alliance with Mr. S. The conflict between affection and duty was at length decided in favour of my father, and the rejected lover set out in despair for Bristol. From thence, in a few days after his arrival, he took his passage in a merchantman for a distant part of the globe; and from that hour no intelligence ever arrived of his fate or fortune. I have often heard my mother speak of this gentleman with regret and sorrow.  My mother was between twenty and thirty years of age at the period of her marriage. The ceremony was performed at Dunyatt, in the county of Somerset. My father was shortly after settled at Bristol, and during the second year after their union a son was born to bless and honour them.[3]  Three years after my mother gave birth to a daughter, named Elizabeth, who died of the smallpox at the age of two years and ten months. In the second winter following this event, which deeply afflicted the most affectionate of parents, I was born. She had"]]]
