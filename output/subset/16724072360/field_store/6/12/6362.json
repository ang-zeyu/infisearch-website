Nothing easier,\" laughed Alberich.  And again putting the helmet on his head he coaxed:--  \"Come, little toad! Creep from your cranny!\" Alberich was gone, and there at Wotan's feet hopped the tiny toad.  \"Quick, Wotan!\" cried Loki.  And in an instant Wotan put his heavy foot upon the toad.  Loki reached down and took the magic wishing-cap.  As soon as the cap was off, the toad disappeared, and there lay Alberich, held fast by Wotan's giant foot.  \"Let me go!\" shrieked the dwarf. \"Take your foot off of me, this minute!\"  Wotan calmly answered: \"You may go when you have promised all I ask.\"  \"Then what do you want?\" groaned Alberich.  \"I want all your glittering gold,\" said Wotan.   THE CURSE  Alberich held the ring close under his breast and muttered to himself: \"They may have the gold! What do I care! With this ring I can soon make my slaves dig more.\"  Then aloud he said: \"You may take the gold. My slaves shall heap it at your feet.\"  He slyly slipped his hand to his lips and, kissing the ring, called his slaves with its magic.  In a moment the little black Nibelungs came in swarms from every shaft, bearing the precious gold.  Alberich did not like to have them see him under Wotan's foot.  \"Heap up the treasure!\" he yelled. \"Don't stop to stare at me. I am still your master. Now, crawl back into your shafts and drudge. I am coming in a minute, and it will not be well for you if I do not find you digging!\"  Trembling with fear, they scurried to the darkest depths.  \"Now, there is your gold!\" said Alberich. \"Give back my helmet and let me go!\"  But Loki quickly tossed the helmet upon the shining heap.  \"Take it, then,\" snarled the dwarf, thinking he could easily, with the power of the ring, force Mimi to make another, \"but let me go, I say!\"  \"Just wait a minute, Alberich,\" said Wotan. \"That ring I saw glittering on your finger,--I must have that too.\"  \"The ring!\" Alberich screamed in horror. \"No, you shall never have the ring!\"  Wotan's face grew stern.  \"That ring does not belong to you. You stole its gold from the Rhine-children,\" he said.  \"Think twice, Wotan, before you take this ring from me! I warn you now a curse goes with it.\"  But Wotan drew the ring from the dwarf's finger, then set him free.  \"Farewell, Alberich! Farewell!\"  \"Ha!\" laughed Alberich in scorn. \"It will never bring you happiness. Its owner shall always feel its curse of care, sorrow, and unrest.\"  Then, turning, he groped his way down the cavern, far poorer than the day he went stealing along the slippery bed of the river. Then, he had no gold. Now, he had no gold and no friends.   THE GREEDY FAFNER  Wotan and Loki hurried back to the mountain-side with their treasure.  At the same time Fafner returned, bringing Freya.  Already Fafner had made up his mind that if he gave Freya back, he must have a very great deal of gold.  When Freya again reached her own country, the sun grew brighter, the air grew sweeter, and the glow of youth came back to the cheeks of Wotan and his family.  \"Here, Fafner, is your gold!\" great Wotan cried.  \"I am sorry to give Freya up,\" said Fafner. \"Pile up the gold between her and me. You may keep her if there is gold enough to hide her completely from my sight. So long as I can see her, I cannot part with her.\"  Then Wotan and his family heaped the glittering gold. They piled it as loosely as they could, but when they had put on all the gold they had, the greedy Fafner cried:--  \"More, more! It is not high enough! Still I can see fair Freya's shimmering hair. Throw on that shining helmet!\"  \"Put it on, Loki,\" commanded Wotan. \"There, Fafner, is your pay. Freya again belongs to me.\"  \"Not yet!\" cried Fafner, as he peeped through a space in the heap. \"I can see her eyes through here.\" Then, pointing to the ring on Wotan's finger: \"Bring that ring and put it in this space.\"  \"Never!\" cried Wotan.  Then Loki spoke. \"The ring belongs to the Rhine-maidens, and Wotan is going to return it to them. Already we have given you more than you should expect, all that shining heap and the helmet besides.\"  \"I will not give you any more!\" roared Wotan. \"Not all the mighty world shall take this ring from my finger!\"  \"Then I shall be gone,\" said Fafner. \"I was afraid you would not give me enough gold. Freya is mine forevermore.\"  Wotan's family began to plead for Freya. \"She is worth more to us than all the gold in this world! Without her we must all wither and die!\"  It was no use to resist. Wotan knew that he dared not lose Freya.  Taking the ring from his finger, he flung it upon the shining heap.   A SLAVE TO GOLD  Fafner gathered up the hoard--the hoard for which he had worked--the hoard for which he had made so much trouble.  He carried it off to his own country. Now that he had it, he had no thought of using it.  He wanted it merely for gold's sake; not for the sake of the great, good things that might be done with it. The only thing he wished to do was to keep others from getting it.  He heaped it up in a cave in the forest. Then he put on the helmet and changed himself into a fierce, ugly dragon.  For the love of mere gold he was willing to give up being a splendid giant, who roamed freely over the beautiful mountains, and to become a hideous, twisting, squirming monster.  The rest of his life he would lie at the door of the cave and guard the treasure. The treasure should lie there useless to all the world.  Fafner,--a slave to gold!   THE BEAUTIFUL VALHALLA  As Fafner carried away his treasure, a great storm gathered over the mountain crest.  The sky grew black. The thunder rolled. Its echoes bounded on from cloud to cloud, from peak to peak, then rumbled down the valleys to the sea.  Then the clouds drifted away. The setting sun shot its long rays into the deep valley.  There, arching over the river and reaching from the flowery mountain-side to the very door of the gleaming castle, stood a shining rainbow bridge.  \"Lo! our castle! Our beautiful Valhalla!\" cried the king. \"Let us cross over. It shall be our dwelling-place forevermore.\"  One by one they stepped upon the bridge.  As Wotan walked slowly and sadly over, he heard the wailing of the Rhine-maidens in the river below:--    \"Rhine-gold! Rhine-gold!   We long for your light!\"  \"I shall never be happy again,\" thought Wotan. \"I have given my honor for Valhalla. What an awful price I have paid!\"     THE WALKUERE   A MATCHLESS SWORD  Many years passed. The giants lived on in their beautiful Valhalla.  But their king was sad.  He could not forget Alberich's curse. What if Alberich should in some way gain possession of the ring again! He would destroy Valhalla.  \"Oh, why was I not brave enough to give the ring back to the Rhine-children!\" sighed Wotan.  \"If only it might again be a mere thing of beauty to gladden their hearts, but so long as it is in the world, how many more will it not rob of their happiness.  \"Surely, some great hero must come who will be brave enough to slay the dragon and give the ring back to its rightful owners.\"  Said Wotan to himself, \"I shall make a mighty sword, and when the hero comes, his sword will be ready for him.\"  Then the great Wotan wrought a matchless sword.  When it was finished, he took it and went into the forest. Straight he went to the home of the bold robber Hunding.  It was a beautiful moonlight night when he reached Hunding's hut.  From the loud laughter and shouting that Wotan heard as he neared the hut, he knew that Hunding and his friends were having a merry feast.  Wotan lifted the latch and entered.  The great, rude room was built around the trunk of a mighty ash tree.  The walls were made of roughly hewn logs.  The floors were covered with the skins of wild animals of the forest.  Mats of reeds and grasses hung upon the walls.  The huge fireplace was built of rough stones.  The mighty Wotan scowled upon the crowd.  Then, lifting the gleaming sword above his head, with one great lunging blow, he buried the bright blade, even to its hilt, in the great ash tree's quivering side.  Then, turning to the guests, he said:--  \"The sword shall belong to him who can draw it from the ash tree's heart.\"  [Illustration: HE TUGGED IN VAIN]  Though each guest tugged with all his might, he tugged in vain.  In the years that followed, many came and went, and all tried hard to gain the sword, and still that magic blade slept on within the ash tree's sheath.   THE VALIANT SIEGMUND  One very dark and stormy night, Siegmund, a brave warrior, wandered alone in the forest.  That day a desperate battle had been fought.  As the darkness came on, Siegmund escaped from the enemy.  He had lost his weapons, and now he trudged through the pathless woods, seeking some place where he might find balm for his wounds and shelter from the raging storm.  He was almost exhausted when he caught sight of a flickering candlelight in the window of a forest hut.  With the little strength that he had left, he dragged himself to its door.  No one answered his call, and no longer caring if it were the home of friend or foe, he opened the door, and staggering in he sank upon the hearth.  As he looked about him he thought, \"This is the home of some forest chief.\"  A great fire burned in the rude fireplace, and, as he grew warm, being worn and weary, he sank into a heavy sleep.   HUNDING'S WIFE  As Siegmund slept, the door of the inner room was gently opened and a beautiful woman stole softly in.  She was clad in snowy white.  Her head was crowned with a wealth of golden hair.  She had heard Siegmund as he entered the room, and, thinking her chieftain had returned from the hunt, she came to greet him.  Instead she saw a stranger on the hearth, and, drawing near, she saw that his face looked sad and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9457"],["title","Travels in Arabia; comprehending an account of those territories in Hedjaz which (#1)"],["body","Hedjaz. This, says he, is not used by the Arabian Bedouins in the usual acceptation of the word. They call Hedjaz exclusively the mountainous country, comprehending many fertile valleys south of Tayf, and as far as the dwelling-places of the Asyr Arabs, where the coffee-tree begins to be cultivated abundantly. This is the general application of the term among all the Bedouins of those countries; and the towns-people of Mekka and Djidda also use it in that sense among themselves. But when they converse with foreigners, whose notions they politely adopt, the name Hedjaz is bestowed on the country between Tayf, Mekka, Medina, Yembo, and Djidda. The Bedouins give the name of El Ghor, or the low-land, to the whole province westward of the mountains from Mekka up to Beder and Yembo; while those mountains themselves northward of Tayf are called by them Hedjaz-es- Shám, or the Northern Hedjaz. [This would confirm the derivation of Hedjaz (mentioned by Golius) from ahhtedjezet, quod (provincia Hhegiaz) colligata et constricta montibus sit: but others derive it from the Arabic word yehedjez, because Hedjaz divides Nedjed from Tehama, or because it connects Yemen with Syria, between which it is situate. As even the shortest note written by Burckhardt must be considered valuable, a few lines, that immediately follow the passage above quoted from his Journal, are here given: I compute the population of the province usually called Hedjaz, comprising the whole territory of the Sherif of Mekka, together with that of Medina and the towns situated therein, and all the Bedouin tribes, at about two hundred and fifty thousand souls; a number which, I am certain, is rather over than under rated; the greater part being the Bedouin inhabitants of the mountains, and principally the strong tribes of Beni Harb.]  [p.xi] On reference to pages 396 and 397, a remark will be found concerning the different application of this name (Hedjaz) among those who inhabit the sea-coast and those Bedouins who occupy the interior country; and it will even appear that doubts have been entertained whether the sacred city Medina does not belong rather to Nedjed than to Hedjaz.  From statements so vague as those above quoted, an attempt to trace exactly the limits of any country must be vain and fallacious: that region, therefore, which borders on the Red Sea, and which the natives, we know, entitle unequivocally Hedjaz, is marked in our map, as in almost every other published hitherto, merely with that name, its first letter being placed where the editor supposes Arabia Petraea to terminate, and its last letter where he would separate Hedjaz from Tehama. [Burckhardt (Syrian Travels p. 511.) quotes Makrizi, the Egyptian historian, who says, in his chapter on Aila, (Akaba): It is from hence that the Hedjaz begins: in former times it was the frontier place of the Greeks, &c.]  To those who seek the most accurate information respecting places but little known, this work is sufficiently recommended by the name of its author, and of the country which it describes. The manners of the Hejazi Arabs have continued, says Sir William Jones, from the time of Solomon to the present age. [Discourse on the Arabs, Asiat. Researches, vol. ii.] Our notions of Mecca must be drawn, says Gibbon, from the Arabians. As no unbeliever is permitted to enter the city, our travellers are silent; and the short hints of Thevenot are taken from the suspicious mouth of an African renegado. [Roman Empire, chap. 50. note 18.]  But the reader of this preface must not be withholden from  [p.xii] perusing Burckhardts authentic and interesting account of the places which he visited, of the extraordinary ceremonies which he witnessed, and of the people among whom he lived in the character of a Muselman.  Some short notices, written on a detached leaf, but evidently intended by the author as an introduction to his Journal, are given accordingly in the next page: for, that the Arabian Travels should appear under such a form as Burckhardt himself probably wished them to assume, has been throughout a favourite object of the editor,  WILLIAM OUSELY.  London, January, 1829.   [p.xiii] THE AUTHORS INTRODUCTION.  IN the pages of this Journal I have frequently quoted some Arabian historians, whose works are in my possession. It is now to me a subject of regret that those manuscripts were not with me in the Hedjaz. The two first I purchased at Cairo, after my return from Arabia.  These works are--l. The History of Mekka, entitled Akhbar Mekka, a thick quarto volume, by Aby el Wolyd el Azraky, who flourished in the year of the Hedjra 223, and has traced the annals of his native city down to that period. This work is particularly interesting on account of its topographical notices, and the authors intimate acquaintance with the state of Arabia before Islám or Mohammedanism. The manuscript appears, from the hand-writing, to be six, or perhaps seven hundred years old.  2. The History of Mekka, entitled Akd e themyn, in three folio volumes, by Taky ed' dyn el Fasy, who was himself Kadhy of Mekka. This history comes down to the year of the Hedjra 829, and is comprised [p.xiv] in the first volume; the other two volumes containing biographical anecdotes of distinguished natives of Mekka.  3. The History of the Mosque of Mekka, with which the history of the town is interwoven, called El Aalam hy aalam beled Allah el haram, in one volume quarto. The author was Kottob ed dyn el Mekky, who held high offices at Mekka, and brings the history down to the year 990 of the Hedjra.  4. The History of the Hedjaz, and more particularly of Mekka, by Asamy. Of this chronicle I possess only the second volume, a large folio manuscript, comprising historical records from the time of the Beni Omeya, to the year (of the Hedjra) 1097. I have not been able to ascertain the title of this work, which abounds with curious and valuable information. The author, Asamy, was a native of Mekka.  5. The History of the Temple and Town of Medina. This work is entitled Khelaset el Wafa, its author was Nour ed dyn Aly Ibn Ahmed e Samhoudy, [To this writer Burckhardt refers in p. 323, by the letters (V.S.) Vide Sumhoudy.] and it is comprised in one folio volume, bringing the history down to the year 911 of the Hedjra.

The name of Kayd Beg, which frequently occurs, is sometimes spelt in the Ms. Kait Beg, and once erroneously Kail Beg. On reference to Burckhardts Nubian Travels, it appears that he entered Djidda on the 18th of July, and not on the 15th, as printed in the first page of this volume through a mistake of the figure 8 for 5; the ink with which he wrote having in many parts of his Journal faded considerably, and become of a pale reddish colour. As far, also, as the faded ink in some places of the Ms. allows the editor (and others who have seen it) to judge, Mekkawy is used to express a person of Mekka: in many pages of the Ms. Mekkan is distinctly written, but the Arabic derivative Mekky occurs only in the Authors Introduction (p. xiv.) Local derivatives similar to Mekkawy occur in the various parts of Burckhardts works: the present volume, and his Syrian and Nubian Travels, exhibit Djiddawy, Yembawy, Kennawy, Dongolawy, Bornawy, Bedjawy, &c. from Djidda, Yembo, Kenne, Dongola, Bornou, Bedja. &c.  [p.1] TRAVELS  IN  THE HEDJAZ OF ARABIA  DJIDDA  MY arrival in the Hedjaz was attended with some unfavourable circumstances. On entering the town of Djidda, in the morning of the 15th of July, 1814, I went to the house of a person on whom I had a letter of credit, delivered to me, at my departure from Cairo, in January, 1813, when I had not yet fully resolved to extend my travels into Arabia. From this person I met with a very cold reception; the letter was thought to be of too old a date to deserve notice: indeed, my ragged appearance might have rendered any one cautious how he committed himself with his correspondents, in paying me a large sum of money on their account; bills and letters of credit are, besides, often trifled with in the mutual dealings of Eastern merchants; and I thus experienced a flat refusal, accompanied, however, with an offer of lodgings in the man's house. This I accepted for the first two days, thinking that, by a more intimate acquaintance I might convince him that I was neither an adventurer nor impostor; but finding him inflexible, I removed to one of the numerous public  [p.2] Khans in the town, my whole stock of money being two dollars and a few sequins, sewed up in an amulet which I wore on my arm. I had little time to make melancholy reflections upon my situation; for on the fourth day after my arrival, I was attacked by a violent fever, occasioned, probably, by indulging too freely in the fine fruits which were then in the Djidda market; an imprudence, which my abstemious diet, for the last twelve"]]]
