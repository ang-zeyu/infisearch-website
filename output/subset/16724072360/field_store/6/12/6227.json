People get killed there all the time.\"  \"Fiddlesticks! I don't believe they do. Well, I reckon I won't get killed. Uncle Robert will take better care of me than that.\"     CHAPTER II   TRAVELING NORTH  As a result of many letters back and forth between Mr. Fairfield and the Northern aunts, Patty stood one morning on the platform of the railway station, all ready to depart for her new homes.  It was the first week in December, and the little girl shivered as she thought of the arctic cold to which she imagined herself going.  \"Of course they'll meet me in a sleigh, won't they, papa?\" she said.  \"Perhaps so, but I doubt it,\" he replied. \"They don't have such snowstorms in Jersey now as they used to when I was a boy. Last winter they had no sleighing at all. But here comes Miss Powers; let us go to greet her.\" Miss Powers was a sharp-faced lady who came marching along the platform with a firm step.  Patty was to travel in her care, not because she was an especially desirable traveling companion, but because she was the only acquaintance of the Fairfields who chanced to be going North at that time.  \"Good-morning,\" she cried, \"are you here already? I was certain you'd be late and miss the train. Not a very pleasant day, is it? I wish we had planned to go to-morrow instead. Why, Patty, you are wearing your best hat! You'll spoil it, I'm sure. Have you your trunk check? Give it to me, you'll certainly lose it else.\"  \"Here it is, Miss Powers,\" said Mr. Fairfield, pleasantly, \"and I dare say you will prove more responsible than my rattle-pated daughter.\"  He squeezed Patty's hand affectionately as he said this, and a great wave of homesickness came over the child's heart. She caught her father round the neck, and vainly trying to keep the tears back, she whispered,  \"Oh, papa, dear, let me stay with you. I don't want to go to Aunt Isabel's,--I know she's horrid, and I just want you, you, _you_!\"  Miss Powers was shocked at this exhibition of emotion, and said with asperity:  \"Come, come, it's too late to talk like that now. And a big girl like you ought to be ashamed to act so babyish.\"  But Mr. Fairfield kissed Patty tenderly and said: \"Dear, we're going to be very brave, you know,--and besides, you're only going for a visit. All people go visiting at some time in their lives, and next December I'll be shaking the dust of Richmond off of my feet and coming after you, pell-mell.\" Patty smiled through her tears, and then the train came tooting along and they all climbed aboard.  As the train waited for ten minutes, Mr. Fairfield had ample time to find the seats engaged for the travelers, and to arrange their hand-luggage in the racks provided for it. Then he bade Miss Powers good-bye, and, turning to Patty, clasped her in his arms as he said:  \"Pattykins, good-bye. The year will soon pass away, and then we'll have a jolly little home together. Be brave and gentle always, and as a parting gift I give you this little box which contains a talisman to help you bear any troubles or difficulties that may come to you.\"  As he spoke, he put into Patty's hand a small parcel sealed at each end with red sealing-wax.  \"Don't open it now,\" he continued. \"Keep it just as it is until you reach Aunt Isabel's. Then after you have gone to your room on the first night of your stay with her, open the box and see what is in it.\"  Then the warning whistle blew, and with a final embrace of his little daughter, Mr. Fairfield left the car.  The train started, and for a moment Patty saw her father waving his handkerchief, and then he was lost to her sight. She felt just like indulging in a good cry, but Miss Powers would have none of that.  The worthy spinster was already opening her bag and preparing to make herself comfortable for her journey.  \"Now, Patty,\" she said, but not unkindly, \"you've left your pa behind, and you're going away from him to stay a year. You've got to go, you can't help yourself, so you might just as well make the best of it, and be cheerful instead of miserable. So now that's settled, and you'd better get out your books and games or whatever you brought along to amuse yourself with.\"  Miss Powers had taken off her hat and gloves and arranged a small balsam pillow behind her head. She put on her glasses, and opened a book in which she at once became absorbed.  Patty, being thus left to her own devices, became much interested in the novelty of her surroundings. It was great fun to lean back against the high-cushioned seat and look out of the window at the trees and plantations and towns as they flew by. This kept her amused until noontime, when a waiter came through the car banging a gong.  Miss Powers shut her book with a snap, and announced that they would go to the dining-car for their lunch.  This was even more fun, for it seemed so queer to Patty to sit at a table and eat, while at the same time she was flying through the country at such break-neck speed.  \"It's like the enchanted carpet, isn't it, Miss Powers?\" she said, as they slid through a thick grove and then out into the sunshine again.  \"What is? what carpet?\" asked Miss Powers, looking down at the floor of the car.  \"Oh, not a real carpet,\" said Patty, politely repressing a smile at the elder lady's ignorance of fairy-lore. \"I mean, for us to go scooting along so fast is like the travelers on the magicians' carpet. Don't you know, the carpet would move of itself wherever he told it to.\"  \"H'm,\" commented Miss Powers, \"that would be a good kind of a carpet to have at housecleaning time, wouldn't it?\"  This prosaic disposition of the magic carpet quite shocked Patty, but she adapted herself to the idea, and said, \"Yes, indeed; you could just say, 'Carpet, get up and go out and hang yourself on the clothes-line, and then shake yourself well and come back again,'--oh, that would be convenient.\"  Miss Powers smiled in an absent-minded sort of way, and Patty chattered on, half to herself and half to her companion.  \"But suppose the carpet should be naughty and refuse to go,--that wouldn't be so pleasant.\"  \"Or suppose it should run away and never come back?\"  This latter remark was made by a strange voice, and Patty looked up quickly to see the man who was seated opposite, smiling in a very friendly way.  He was an elderly gentleman with white hair and beard, and it seemed to Patty's vivid imagination that he looked like Noah, or some other of the ancient patriarchs.  \"That would be a great joke on the housekeeper,\" Patty answered, feeling already well acquainted with the pleasant old gentleman, \"and I suppose she would have to get a new carpet.\"  \"Or have a hard-wood floor laid in her room,\" he responded.  \"Or live on a bare floor,\" said Miss Powers. \"I think it would be a very slack housekeeper who would let her carpets shake themselves, and she would probably be too lazy or too poor to replace the ones that ran away.\"  Mr. Noah, as Patty called the old man in her mind, laughed heartily at this, and during the rest of the luncheon hour proved himself a genial and entertaining companion.  The day passed quickly, and at bedtime Patty was quite tired enough to welcome the thought of tucking herself away in one of those queer-looking bunks that the porter was arranging.  \"I'll sleep on the top shelf,\" she said, gleefully, \"may I, Miss Powers?\"  \"I'll be very glad if you will, child,--I've no desire to climb up there. Ugh, I don't think I can sleep anywhere on this bobbety-bobble train.\"  Then the porter brought a small step-ladder, and this delighted Patty beyond measure.  \"Ho!\" said she, \"now I'm 'Jack and the Beanstalk.' 'A-hitchet, a-hatchet, a-up I go'!\" and with two jumps and a spring she landed in the upper berth.  \"Now,\" she said to herself, \"I know how Alice felt when she grew so large that she filled up the whole room. Let me see, what did she do? She put one arm out the window and one foot up the chimney. Well, I can't do that, and I don't see any little cakes to eat, as she did, that will make me grow smaller, so I s'pose I'll just have to scrounch around till I'm ready for bed, and then slide in. I'm sure I shan't sleep, it's all so noisy and exciting.\"  But when she finally straightened herself out on the coarse, cinder-sprinkled linen of the Pullman, the chink-a-chunk of the train changed to a lullaby, and in about two minutes Patty was sound asleep.     CHAPTER III   NEW FRIENDS  It was about four o'clock the next afternoon when the train came puffing into the great train-shed in Jersey City.  It had passed through Elmbridge about an hour before, but being an express train, it made no stop at such small places.  So Mr. St. Clair had arranged to meet Patty at Jersey City and take her back home with him.  Patty recognized her uncle as soon as he entered the car, and ran to greet him.  \"Howdy, Uncle Robert,\" she said, in her pretty southern way, \"are you looking for me?\"  \"I am, if you're little Patty Fairfield. But you've grown so since I saw you that I think I shall have to ask for your credentials.\"  Patty laughed, and answered: \"My credentials are that I remember the doll and the candy you brought me five years ago, and I just _know_ you're my Uncle Robert.\"  \"I am indeed, and I've come to carry you off to a lot of other admiring relatives.\"  Then Patty introduced Miss Powers, and after gathering up the various wraps and bags they all left the train. Miss Powers was to cross the ferry to New York, so Patty and Uncle Robert escorted her to the ferry-boat and bade her good-bye, with many thanks for her kind care of the little girl during the journey.  Then Uncle Robert said: \"Now we'll go out to Elmbridge as quick as we can skip, but first we must pick up Ethelyn, whom I left in the waiting-room.\"  \"Oh, is Ethelyn here?\" cried Patty. \"I am so glad, I'm just crazy to see her.\"  Apparently Ethelyn was crazy too, for she flew at her cousin as soon as"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8456"],["title","Patty Fairfield (#2)"],["body","entered the door.  \"You dear thing!\" she exclaimed, \"I'm so delighted to see you. Oh, how pretty you are! We'll be awfully good chums, won't we?\"  \"I'm sure we shall,\" replied Patty, who was just a wee bit frightened by this dashing young cousin.  Ethelyn was about Patty's age, but somewhat shorter and decidedly less slender. Her yellow hair was not long, indeed it was cut evenly round just above her shoulders, but it was crinkled and fluffed out until her head had the contour of a yellow pumpkin.  A huge black hat with a wide rolling brim was perched on top of the yellow mop, and ornamented with feathers and shining buckles.  Both the girls wore dark blue suits trimmed with fur, but Ethelyn's was resplendent with wide lace-trimmed collars, and she wore clattering bangles on her wrists, and a fancy little muff hung round her neck by a silver chain.  Her skirts were as short as Patty's, and she seemed like a little girl, and yet she had a wise, grown-up air, and she began to patronize her cousin at once.  \"Your frock is nice,\" she said, \"but it has no style to it. Well, I suppose you couldn't get much in the way of dressmakers where you lived, but Madame Marsala will soon turn you out all right. Mamma says she'll just enjoy ordering new clothes for you, and your papa told her to get whatever she chose. Oh, won't we have fun! We always go to New York for our things, and the shops are just lovely.\"  \"Come, come, children,\" said Uncle Robert, who had been looking after Patty's trunks, \"the train is made up, let us get aboard.\"  They went through one of a whole row of little gates in an iron fence, and Patty wondered at the numerous trains and the crowds of people moving swiftly towards them.  She wondered if everything at the North were conducted on such a wholesale and such a hurrying plan. They hurried along the platform and hurried into a car, then Uncle Robert put the two children into a seat together, while he sat behind them and devoted himself to his evening paper.  The girls chatted gaily and Patty learned much about the home she was going to, and began to think of it as a very beautiful and attractive place.  The train stopped at Elmbridge, and without waiting for her father, Ethelyn piloted Patty off the car.  \"Here's our carriage,\" she said, as a handsome pair of horses with jingling chains came prancing up. A footman in livery handed the young ladies in, and Patty felt as if she had come among very grand people indeed.  While they waited for Mr. St. Clair, who was giving the checks to the baggage-master, Patty admired the pretty little station of rough gray stone, and the neatly kept grounds and paths all about it.  \"Yes, they are pretty,\" assented Ethelyn, \"but just wait till you see our grounds. We have the finest place in Elmbridge. In summer it's just lovely.\"  Then Mr. St. Clair came, and giving the coachman the order \"Home,\" he seated himself opposite the two girls.  \"Well, Patty, how do you like it, so far?\" he asked, genially, of his niece.  \"Oh, Uncle Robert, I think it's beautiful, but I hoped we'd have a sleigh-ride. I've never been in a sleigh.\"  \"Bless you, child, we don't have much sleighing. However, perhaps we can scare up a sleigh-ride before the winter is over. We have a pretty fine sleigh, eh, Ethelyn?\"  \"Yes, indeed, we have a beautiful great big one, and I have a little cutter, all my own. I'll take you sleighing, Patty, if we get half a chance.\"  Soon they reached the St. Clair home and drove up the long winding avenue to the house.  Patty saw a brilliantly lighted mansion, and as they drew near it, she heard the most piercing shrieks and yells, as of a human being in desperate straits of some kind.  Patty wondered if she were about to enter a Bluebeard's castle, but deeming it polite to take no notice of the uproar, she tried to appear unheeding though the shrieks increased in violence as they came up to the house and the carriage stopped at the front door.     CHAPTER IV   VILLA ROSA  \"Here we are, chickens,\" said Uncle Robert, as the footman threw open the carriage door, \"here's your new home, Patty, and you're very welcome to your Uncle Robert's house.\"  It was almost dark and Patty could distinguish only the outlines of a magnificent house, so large that it seemed like a palace.  They went up massive stone steps between great stone lions, to a wonderful veranda bright with electric lights, and lights streamed from every window and from the wide front doors which flew open as they reached them.  But though all this beauty and elegance impressed Patty like a dream of Fairyland, she paid little heed to it, for she was so shocked and disturbed by the shrieks from within, which were now distinctly audible as those of a child.  \"Goodness me!\" exclaimed Ethelyn, just as Patty could stand it no longer and was about to ask what it meant, \"what can be the matter with Florelle this time? I hope you enjoy squealing, Patty, for you'll hear plenty of it in this house. Don't mind it; little sister has a fearful temper, and we have to let her squeal it out.\"  Patty was relieved to learn that it wasn't a case of intentional torture, and by this time she found herself in the great hall.  The grandeur of her surroundings fairly dazzled her, for Patty was an inexperienced little girl, and had lived simply, though very comfortably all her life. And so she looked with amazement on the walls frescoed in brilliant colors, the enormous gilt-framed mirrors, the tall palms and marble statues, the rich draperies and stained-glass windows.  If she had been older and more experienced she would have known that it was _too_ gorgeous, the coloring too bright and garish, and the ornamentation over-showy. But to her childish eyes it all seemed wonderfully fine.  \"Oh, Uncle Robert,\" she cried, \"is this your home? How beautiful it is! I never saw such a lovely place in my life.\"  This speech pleased Mr. St. Clair beyond measure, for he dearly loved to have his beautiful home appreciated, and he beamed, and rubbed his hands together with a general air of satisfaction.  \"Yes, yes,\" he said, \"it is fine,--_fine_! There isn't another such place for miles around.\"  Then they went into the drawing-room and Patty was presented to her Aunt Isabel.  Mrs. St. Clair was a fair, large woman, with golden hair, elaborately frizzed, and kind blue eyes. She was fashionably dressed, and her silks rustled and her bugles tinkled as she came forward to meet her visitor.  \"I am charmed to see you, Patty, my dear,\" she said, kissing her affectionately.  \"And I am very glad to be here, Aunt Isabel,\" said Patty, and just then she was interrupted by the violent entrance of what seemed to be a small pink cyclone.  This was the eight year old Florelle, and without a doubt it was she who was responsible for the shrieks Patty had heard.  The child wore a short, beruffled dress of pink silk, a huge pink sash, and pink stockings and slippers. Her eyes were reddened with crying and her cheeks were tear-stained, and she ran to Patty, screaming:  \"I will! I _will_! She's _my_ cousin, and I'm going to see her _now_.\"  Then she threw her arms round Patty's waist, and smiled up into her face. She was a very pretty little girl when she smiled, and Patty couldn't help admiring her, though so far she had seemed like anything but a lovable character.  \"Oh, Florelle,\" said her mother, mildly, \"how naughty you are. I told you to go to bed like a goody girl, and you should see Cousin Patty in the morning.\"  \"But I wanted to see her to-night. So I made nurse dress me, and I'm going to stay up to dinner.\"  \"Let her stay, mamma,\" said Ethelyn. \"If you don't, she'll yell again, and I'm tired of hearing her.\"  \"Yes, you can stay, baby,\" said Mrs. St. Clair, \"and now, Ethelyn, take Patty to her room, and get yourselves ready for dinner.\"  The two girls went off together, and Patty discovered that the rest of the house was as sumptuous as her first view of it.  The same brilliant coloring and florid ornamentation appeared everywhere, and when at last Ethelyn stopped before an open door, and said, \"This is your room,\" Patty gave a little cry of delight, for she entered what seemed a veritable fairy bower.  The walls and ceiling were tinted pink and frescoed with garlands of roses and flying birds. There was a fascinating bay window with latticed panes, and a cozy window-seat with soft cushions. The brass bedstead had a lace coverlet over pink silk, and the toilet-table had frilled curtains and pink ribbons. There were silver-mounted brushes and bottles and knickknacks of all kinds. The little work-table was a gem, and there was a lovely writing-desk with silver appointments and pink blotting-paper. Then there was a cozy divan, with lots of fluffy pink pillows, and through a half-opened door, Patty could see a dear little dressing-room.  There were beautiful pictures on the walls, and costly vases and bric-a-brac all about, and it all showed such kind thought on the part of somebody, that Patty's heart was touched.  \"Is it for me? Who did it all?\" she asked, turning to Ethelyn with shining eyes.  \"Oh, mamma did it; she loves to do such things. That is, she planned it, and the servants did the work. Here's my room right next. It's just like it, almost.\" So it was, or at least it had been, but it showed signs of carelessness and disorder. A lamp globe was broken, and there was a large hole burned in one of the pretty rugs. The toilet table, too, was in sad disarray, and some papers were sticking out of the closed desk.  \"Don't look at it,\" said Ethelyn, apologetically, \"I'm so careless. I broke that globe when I was swinging my dumb-bells, and I've done it so often that mamma declared she wouldn't get me another. And I upset the alcohol lamp on the rug. But I don't care; when we have a party it will all get spruced up; mamma has everything put in order then. Now we'll dress for dinner, Patty. What are you going to wear?\"  \"I don't know; I haven't many dresses."]]]
