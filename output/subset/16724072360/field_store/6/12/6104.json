I would have intimate league with France; I would strengthen ourselves with Spain and the German Emperor; I would buy or seduce the votes of the sacred college; I would have thy poor brother, whom thou so pitiest because he has no son to marry a king's daughter, no daughter to wed with a king's son--I would have thy unworthy brother, Montagu, the father of the whole Christian world, and, from the chair of the Vatican, watch over the weal of kingdoms.  And now, seest thou why with to-morrow's sun I depart for Calais, and lend my voice in aid of Clarence's for the first knot in this complicated bond?\"  \"But will Warwick consent while the king opposes?  Will his pride--\"  \"His pride serves us here; for so long as Clarence did not dare to gainsay the king, Warwick in truth might well disdain to press his daughter's hand upon living man.  The king opposes, but with what right?  Warwick's pride will but lead him, if well addressed, to defy affront and to resist dictation.  Besides, our brother has a woman's heart for his children; and Isabel's face is pale, and that will plead more than all my eloquence.\"  \"But can the king forgive your intercession and Warwick's contumacy?\"  \"Forgive!--the marriage once over, what is left for him to do?  He is then one with us, and when Gloucester returns all will be smooth again,--smooth for the second and more important nuptials; and the second shall preface the third; meanwhile, you return to the court. To these ceremonials you need be no party: keep but thy handsome son from breaking his neck in over-riding his hobby, and 'bide thy time!'\"  Agreeably with the selfish but sagacious policy thus detailed, the prelate departed the next day for Calais, where Clarence was already urging his suit with the ardent impatience of amorous youth.  The archbishop found, however, that Warwick was more reluctant than he had anticipated, to suffer his daughter to enter any House without the consent of its chief; nor would the earl, in all probability, have acceded to the prayers of the princely suitor, had not Edward, enraged at the flight of Clarence, and worked upon by the artful queen, committed the imprudence of writing an intemperate and menacing letter to the earl, which called up all the passions of the haughty Warwick.  \"What!\" he exclaimed, \"thinks this ungrateful man not only to dishonour me by his method of marrying his sisters, but will he also play the tyrant with me in the disposal of mine own daughter!  He threats! he!--enough.  It is due to me to show that there lives no man whose threats I have not the heart to defy!\"  And the prelate finding him in this mood had no longer any difficulty in winning his consent. This ill-omened marriage was, accordingly, celebrated with great and regal pomp at Calais, and the first object of the archbishop was attained.  While thus stood affairs between the two great factions of the state, those discontents which Warwick's presence at court had a while laid at rest again spread, broad and far, throughout the land.  The luxury and indolence of Edward's disposition in ordinary times always surrendered him to the guidance of others.  In the commencement of his reign he was eminently popular, and his government, though stern, suited to the times; for then the presiding influence was that of Lord Warwick.  As the queen's counsels prevailed over the consummate experience and masculine vigour of the earl, the king's government lost both popularity and respect, except only in the metropolis; and if, at the close of his reign, it regained all its earlier favour with the people, it must be principally ascribed to the genius of Hastings, then England's most powerful subject, and whose intellect calmly moved all the springs of action.  But now everywhere the royal authority was weakened; and while Edward was feasting at Shene and Warwick absent at Calais, the provinces were exposed to all the abuses which most gall a population.  The poor complained that undue exactions were made on them by the hospitals, abbeys, and barons; the Church complained that the queen's relations had seized and spent Church moneys; the men of birth and merit complained of the advancement of new men who had done no service: and all these several discontents fastened themselves upon the odious Woodvilles, as the cause of all.  The second breach, now notorious, between the king and the all-beloved Warwick, was a new aggravation of the popular hatred to the queen's family, and seemed to give occasion for the malcontents to appear with impunity, at least so far as the earl was concerned: it was, then, at this critical time that the circumstances we are about to relate occurred.     CHAPTER II.  THE WOULD-BE IMPROVERS OF JOVE'S FOOTBALL, EARTH.--THE SAD FATHER AND THE SAD CHILD.--THE FAIR RIVALS.  Adam Warner was at work on his crucible when the servitor commissioned to attend him opened the chamber door, and a man dressed in the black gown of a student entered.  He approached the alchemist, and after surveying him for a moment in a silence that seemed not without contempt, said, \"What, Master Warner, are you so wedded to your new studies that you have not a word to bestow on an old friend?\"  Adam turned, and after peevishly gazing at the intruder a few moments, his face brightened up into recognition.  \"En iterum!\" he said.  \"Again, bold Robin Hilyard, and in a scholar's garb!  Ha!  doubtless thou hast learned ere this that peaceful studies do best insure man's weal below, and art come to labour with me in the high craft of mind-work!\"  \"Adam,\" quoth Hilyard, \"ere I answer, tell me this: Thou with thy science wouldst change the world: art thou a jot nearer to thy end?\"  \"Well-a-day,\" said poor Adam, \"you know little what I have undergone. For danger to myself by rack and gibbet I say nought.  Man's body is fair prey to cruelty, and what a king spares to-day the worm shall gnaw to-morrow.  But mine invention--my Eureka--look!\" and stepping aside, he lifted a cloth, and exhibited the mangled remains of the unhappy model.  \"I am forbid to restore it,\" continued Adam, dolefully.  \"I must work day and night to make gold, and the gold comes not; and my only change of toil is when the queen bids me construct little puppet-boxes for her children!  How, then, can I change the world?  And thou,\" he added, doubtingly and eagerly--\"thou, with thy plots and stratagem, and active demagogy, thinkest thou that thou hast changed the world, or extracted one drop of evil out of the mixture of gall and hyssop which man is born to drink?\"  Hilyard was silent, and the two world-betterers--the philosopher and the demagogue--gazed on each other, half in sympathy, half in contempt.  At last Robin said,--  \"Mine old friend, hope sustains us both; and in the wilderness we yet behold the Pisgah!  But to my business.  Doubtless thou art permitted to visit Henry in his prison.\"  \"Not so,\" replied Adam; \"and for the rest, since I now eat King Edward's bread, and enjoy what they call his protection, ill would it beseem me to lend myself to plots against his throne.\"  \"Ah, man, man, man,\" exclaimed Hilyard, bitterly, \"thou art like all the rest,--scholar or serf, the same slave; a king's smile bribes thee from a people's service!\"  Before Adam could reply, a panel in the wainscot slid back and the bald head of a friar peered into the room.  \"Son Adam,\" said the holy man, \"I crave your company an instant, oro vestrem aurem;\" and with this abominable piece of Latinity the friar vanished.  With a resigned and mournful shrug of the shoulders, Adam walked across the room, when Hilyard, arresting his progress, said, crossing himself, and in a subdued and fearful whisper, \"Is not that Friar Bungey, the notable magician?\"  \"Magician or not,\" answered Warner, with a lip of inexpressible contempt and a heavy sigh, \"God pardon his mother for giving birth to such a numskull!\" and with this pious and charitable ejaculation Adam disappeared in the adjoining chamber, appropriated to the friar.  \"Hum,\" soliloquized Hilyard, \"they say that Friar Bungey is employed by the witch duchess in everlasting diabolisms against her foes.  A peep into his den might suffice me for a stirring tale to the people.\"  No sooner did this daring desire arise than the hardy Robin resolved to gratify it; and stealing on tiptoe along the wall, he peered cautiously through the aperture made by the sliding panel.  An enormous stuffed lizard hung from the ceiling, and various strange reptiles, dried into mummy, were ranged around, and glared at the spy with green glass eyes.  A huge book lay open on a tripod stand, and a caldron seethed over a slow and dull fire.  A sight yet more terrible presently awaited the rash beholder.  \"Adam,\" said the friar, laying his broad palm on the student's reluctant shoulders, \"inter sapentes.\"  \"Sapientes, brother,\" groaned Adam.  \"That's the old form, Adam,\" quoth the friar, superciliously,-- \"sapentes is the last improvement.  I say, between wise men there is no envy.  Our noble and puissant patroness, the Duchess of Bedford, hath committed to me a task that promiseth much profit.  I have worked at it night and day stotis filibus.\"  \"O man, what lingo speakest thou?--stotis filibus!\"  \"Tush, if it is not good Latin, it does as well, son Adam.  I say I have worked at it night and day, and it is now advanced eno' for experiment.  But thou art going to sleep.\"  \"Despatch! speak out! speak on!\" said Adam, desperately,--\"what is thy achievement?\"  \"See!\" answered the friar, majestically; and drawing aside a black pall, he exhibited to the eyes of Adam, and to the more startled gaze of Robin Hilyard, a pale, cadaverous, corpse-like image, of pigmy proportions, but with features moulded into a coarse caricature of the lordly countenance of the Earl of Warwick.  \"There,\" said the friar, complacently, and "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7720"],["title","The Last of the Barons â€” Volume 06 (#2)"],["body","his hands, \"that is no piece of bungling, eh?  As like the stout earl as one pea to another.\"  \"And for what hast thou kneaded up all this waste of wax?\" asked Adam. \"Forsooth, I knew not you had so much of ingenious art; algates, the toy is somewhat ghastly.\"  \"Ho, ho!\" quoth the friar, laughing so as to show a set of jagged, discoloured fangs from ear to ear, \"surely thou, who art so notable a wizard and scholar, knowest for what purpose we image forth our enemies.  Whatever the duchess inflicts upon this figure, the Earl of Warwick, whom it representeth, will feel through his bones and marrow,--waste wax, waste man!\"  \"Thou art a devil to do this thing, and a blockhead to think it, O miserable friar!\" exclaimed Adam, roused from all his gentleness.  \"Ha!\" cried the friar, no less vehemently, and his burly face purple with passion, \"dost thou think to bandy words with me?  Wretch!  I will set goblins to pinch thee black and blue!  I will drag thee at night over all the jags of Mount Pepanon, at the tail of a mad nightmare!  I will put aches in all thy bones, and the blood in thy veins shall run into sores and blotches.  Am I not Friar Bungey?  And what art thou?\"  At these terrible denunciations, the sturdy Robin, though far less superstitious than most of his contemporaries, was seized with a trembling from head to foot; and expecting to see goblins and imps start forth from the walls, he retired hastily from his hiding-place, and, without waiting for further commune with Warner, softly opened the chamber door and stole down the stairs.  Adam, however, bore the storm unquailingly, and when the holy man paused to take breath, he said calmly,--  \"Verily, if thou canst do these things, there must be secrets in Nature which I have not yet discovered.  Howbeit, though thou art free to try all thou canst against me, thy threats make it necessary that this communication between us should be nailed up, and I shall so order.\"  The friar, who was ever in want of Adam's aid, either to construe a bit of Latin, or to help him in some chemical illusion, by no means relished this quiet retort; and holding out his huge hand to Adam, said, with affected cordiality,--  \"Pooh! we are brothers, and must not quarrel.  I was over hot, and thou too provoking; but I honour and love thee, man,--let it pass.  As for this figure, doubtless we might pink it all over, and the earl be never the worse.  But if our employers order these things and pay for them, we cunning men make profit by fools!\"  \"It is men like thee that bring shame on science,\" answered Adam, sternly; \"and I will not listen to thee longer.\"  \"Nay, but you must,\" said the friar, clutching Adam's robe, and concealing his resentment by an affected grin.  \"Thou thinkest me a mere ignoramus--ha! ha!--I think the same of thee.  Why, man, thou hast never studied the parts of the human body, 1'11 swear.\"  \"I'm no leech,\" said Adam.  \"Let me go.\"  \"No, not yet.  I will convict thee of ignorance.  Thou dost not even know where the liver is placed.\"  \"I do,\" answered Adam, shortly; \"but what then?\"  \"Thou dost?--I deny it.  Here is a pin; stick it into this wax, man, where thou sayest the liver lies in the human frame.\"  Adam unsuspiciously obeyed.  \"Well! the liver is there, eh?  Ah, but where are the lungs?\"  \"Why, here.\"  \"And the midriff?\"  \"Here, certes.\"  \"Right!--thou mayest go now,\" said the friar, dryly.  Adam disappeared through the aperture, and closed the panel.  \"Now I know where the lungs, midriff, and liver are,\" said the friar to himself, \"I shall get on famously.  'T is a useful fellow, that, or I should have had him hanged long ago!\"  Adam did not remark on his re-entrance that his visitor, Hilyard, had disappeared, and the philosopher was soon reimmersed in the fiery interest of his thankless labours.  It might be an hour afterwards, when, wearied and exhausted by perpetual hope and perpetual disappointment, he flung himself on his seat; and that deep sadness, which they who devote themselves in this noisy world to wisdom and to truth alone can know, suffused his thoughts, and murmured from his feverish lips.  \"Oh, hard condition of my life!\" groaned the sage,--\"ever to strive, and never to accomplish.  The sun sets and the sun rises upon my eternal toils, and my age stands as distant from the goal as stood my youth!  Fast, fast the mind is wearing out the frame, and my schemes have but woven the ropes of sand, and my name shall be writ in water. Golden dreams of my young hope, where are ye?  Methought once, that could I obtain the grace of royalty, the ear of power, the command of wealth, my path to glory was made smooth and sure; I should become the grand inventor of my time and land; I should leave my lore a heritage and blessing wherever labour works to civilize the round globe.  And now my lodging is a palace, royalty my patron; they give me gold at my desire; my wants no longer mar my leisure.  Well, and for what?  On condition that I forego the sole task for which patronage, wealth, and leisure were desired!  There stands the broken iron, and there simmers the ore I am to turn to gold,--the iron worth more than all the gold, and the gold never to be won!  Poor, I was an inventor, a creator, the true magician; protected, patronized, enriched, I am but the alchemist, the bubble, the dupe or duper, the fool's fool.  God, brace up my limbs!  Let me escape! give me back my old dream, and die at least, if accomplishing nothing, hoping all!\"  He rose as he spoke; he strode across the chamber with majestic step, with resolve upon his brow.  He stopped short, for a sharp pain shot across his heart.  Premature age and the disease that labour brings were at their work of decay within: the mind's excitement gave way to the body's weakness, and he sank again upon his seat, breathing hard, gasping, pale, the icy damps upon his brow.  Bubblingly seethed the molten metals, redly glowed the poisonous charcoal, the air of death was hot within the chamber where the victim of royal will pandered to the desire of gold.  Terrible and eternal moral for Wisdom and for Avarice, for sages and for kings,--ever shall he who would be the maker of gold breathe the air of death!  \"Father,\" said the low and touching voice of one who had entered unperceived, and who now threw her arms round Adam's neck, \"Father, thou art ill, and sorely suffering--\"  \"At heart--yes, Sibyll.  Give me thine arm; let us forth and taste the fresher air.\"  It was so seldom that Warner could be induced to quit his chamber, that these words almost startled Sibyll, and she looked anxiously in his face, as she wiped the dews from his forehead.  \"Yes--air--air!\" repeated Adam, rising.  Sibyll placed his bonnet over his silvered locks, drew his gown more closely round him, and slowly and in silence they left the chamber, and took their way across the court to the ramparts of the fortress- palace.  The day was calm and genial, with a low but fresh breeze stirring gently through the warmth of noon.  The father and child seated themselves on the parapet, and saw, below, the gay and numerous vessels that glided over the sparkling river, while the dark walls of Baynard's Castle, the adjoining bulwark and battlements of Montfichet, and the tall watch-tower of Warwick's mighty mansion frowned in the distance against the soft blue sky.  \"There,\" said Adam, quietly, and pointing to the feudal roofs, \"there seems to rise power, and yonder (glancing to the river), yonder seems to flow Genius!  A century or so hence the walls shall vanish, but the river shall roll on.  Man makes the castle, and founds the power,--God forms the river and creates the Genius.  And yet, Sibyll, there may be streams as broad and stately as yonder Thames, that flow afar in the waste, never seen, never heard by man.  What profits the river unmarked; what the genius never to be known?\"  It was not a common thing with Adam Warner to be thus eloquent. Usually silent and absorbed, it was not his gift to moralize or declaim.  His soul must be deeply moved before the profound and buried sentiment within it could escape into words.  Sibyll pressed her father's hand, and, though her own heart was very heavy, she forced her lips to smile and her voice to soothe.  Adam interrupted her.  \"Child, child, ye women know not what presses darkest and most bitterly on the minds of men.  You know not what it is to form out of immaterial things some abstract but glorious object,--to worship, to serve it, to sacrifice to it, as on an altar, youth, health, hope, life,--and suddenly in old age to see that the idol was a phantom, a mockery, a shadow laughing us to scorn, because we have sought to clasp it.\"  \"Oh, yes, Father, women have known that illusion.\"  \"What!  Do they study?\"  \"No, Father, but they feel!\"  \"Feel!  I comprehend thee not.\"  \"As man's genius to him is woman's heart to her,\" answered Sibyll, her dark and deep eyes suffused with tears.  \"Doth not the heart create, invent?  Doth it not dream?  Doth it not form its idol out of air? Goeth it not forth into the future, to prophesy to itself?  And sooner or later, in age or youth, doth it not wake at last, and see how it hath wasted its all on follies?  Yes, Father, my heart can answer, when thy genius would complain.\"  \"Sibyll,\" said Warner, roused and surprised, and gazing on her wistfully, \"time flies apace.  Till this hour I have thought of thee but as a child, an infant.  Thy words disturb me now.\"  \"Think not of them, then.  Let me never add one grief to thine.\"  \"Thou art brave and gay in thy silken sheen,\" said Adam, curiously stroking down the rich, smooth stuff of Sibyll's tunic; \"her grace the duchess is generous to us.  Thou art surely happy here!\"  \"Happy!\"  \"Not happy!\" exclaimed Adam, almost joyfully, \"wouldst thou that we were back once more in our desolate, ruined home?\"  \"Yes, ob, yes!--but rather away, far away, in some quiet village, some green nook; for the desolate, ruined"]]]
