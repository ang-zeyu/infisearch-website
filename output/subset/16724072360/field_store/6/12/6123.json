Lemercier?\"  \"She is a Mademoiselle Julie Caumartin, and was a very popular _coryphee_.  She has hereditary right to be a good dancer, as the daughter of a once more famous ornament of the ballet, _la belle_ Leonie --whom you must have seen in your young days.\"  \"Of course.  Leonie--she married a M. Surville, a silly _bourgeois gentilhomme_, who earned the hatred of Paris by taking her off the stage. So that is her daughter  I see no likeness to her mother--much handsomer. Why does she call herself Caumartin?\"  \"Oh,\" said Frederic, \"a melancholy but trite story.\"  \"Leonie was left a widow, and died in want.  What could the poor young daughter do?  She found a rich protector, who had influence to get her an appointment in the ballet: and there she did as most girls so circumstanced do--appeared under an assumed name, which she has since kept.\"  \"I understand,\" said Victor, compassionately.  \"Poor thing! she has quitted the platform, and is coming this way, evidently to speak to you. I saw her eyes brighten as she caught sight of your face.\"  Lemercier attempted a languid air of modest self-complacency as the girl now approached him.  \"_Bonjour_, M. Frederic!  Ah, mon Dieu! how thin you have grown!  You have been ill?\"  \"The hardships of a military life, Mademoiselle.  Ah, for the _beaux fours_ and the peace we insisted on destroying under the Empire which we destroyed for listening to us!  But you thrive well, I trust.  I have seen you better dressed, but never in greater beauty.\"  The girl blushed as she replied, \"Do you really think as you speak?\"  \"I could not speak more sincerely if I lived in the legendary House of Glass.\"  The girl clutched his arm, and said in suppressed tones, \"Where is Gustave?\"  \"Gustave Rameau?  I have no idea.  Do you never see him now?\"  \"Never,--perhaps I never shall see him again; but when you do meet him, say that Julie owes to him her livelihood.  An honest livelihood, Monsieur.  He taught her to love verses--told her how to recite them. I am engaged at this cafe--you will find me here the same hour every day, in case--in case--You are good and kind, and will come and tell me that Gustave is well and happy even if he forgets me. _Au revoir_!  Stop, you do look, my poor Frederic, as if--as if--pardon me, Monsieur Lemercier, is there anything I can do?  Will you condescend to borrow from me?  I am in funds.\"  Lemercier at that offer was nearly moved to tears.  Famished though he was, he could not, however, have touched that girl's earnings.  \"You are an angel of goodness, Mademoiselle!  Ah, how I envy Gustave Rameau!  No, I don't want aid.  I am always a--_rentier_.\"  \"_Bien_!  and if you see Gustave, you will not forget.\"  \"Rely on me.  Come away,\" he said to De Mauleon; \"I don't want to hear that girl repeat the sort of bombast the poets indite nowadays.  It is fustian; and that girl may have a brain of feather, but she has a heart of gold.\"  \"True,\" said Victor, as they regained the street.  \"I overheard what she said to you.  What an incomprehensible thing is a woman! how more incomprehensible still is a woman's love!  Ah, pardon me; I must leave you.  I see in the procession a poor woman known to me in better days.\"  De Mauleon walked towards the woman he spoke of--one of the long procession to the bakery--a child clinging to her robe.  A pale grief- worn woman, still young, but with the weariness of age on her face, and the shadow of death on her child's.  \"I think I see Madame Monnier,\" said De Mauleon, softly.  She turned and looked at him drearily.  A year ago, she would have blushed if addressed by a stranger in a name not lawfully hers.  \"Well,\" she said, in hollow accents broken by cough; \"I don't know you, Monsieur.\"  \"Poor woman!\" he resumed, walking beside her as she moved slowly on, while the eyes of other women in the procession stared at him hungrily. \"And your child looks ill too.  It is your youngest?\"  \"My only one!  The others are in Pere la  Chaise.  There are but few children alive in my street now.  God has been very merciful, and taken them to Himself.\"  De Mauleon recalled the scene of a neat comfortable apartment, and the healthful happy children at play on the floor.  The mortality among the little ones, especially in the quartier occupied by the working classes, had of late been terrible.  The want of food, of fuel, the intense severity of the weather, had swept them off as by a pestilence.  \"And Monnier--what of him?  No doubt he is a National Guard, and has his pay?\"  The woman made no answer, but hung down her head.  She was stifling a sob.  Till then her eyes seemed to have exhausted the last source of tears.  \"He lives still?\" continued Victor, pityingly: \"he is not wounded?\"  \"No: he is well--in health; thank you kindly, Monsieur.\"  \"But his pay is not enough to help you, and of course he can get no work. Excuse me if I stopped you.  It is because I owed Armand Monnier a little debt for work, and I am ashamed to say that it quite escaped my memory in these terrible events.  Allow me, Madame, to pay it to you,\" and he thrust his purse into her hand.  \"I think this contains about the sum I owed; if more or less, we will settle the difference later.  Take care of yourself.\"  He was turning away when the woman caught hold of him.  \"Stay, Monsieur.  May Heaven bless you!--but--but tell me what name I am to give to Armand.  I can't think of any one who owed him money.  It must have been before that dreadful strike, the beginning of all our woes. Ah, if it were allowed to curse any one, I fear my last breath would not be a prayer.\"  \"You would curse the strike, or the master who did not forgive Armand's share in it?\"  \"No, no,--the cruel man who talked him into it--into all that has changed the best workman, the kindest heart--the--the--\" again her voice died in sobs.  \"And who was that man?\" asked De Mauleon, falteringly.  \"His name was Lebeau.  If you were a poor man, I should say 'Shun him.'\"  \"I have heard of the name you mention; but if we mean the same person, Monnier cannot have met him lately.  He has not been in Paris since the siege.\"  \"I suppose not, the coward!  He ruined us--us who were so happy before; and then, as Armand says, cast us away as instruments he had done with. But--but if you do know him, and do see him again, tell him--tell him not to complete his wrong--not to bring murder on Armand's soul.  For Armand isn't what he was--and has become, oh, so violent!  I dare not take this money without saying who gave it.  He would not take money as alms from an aristocrat.  Hush! he beat me for taking money from the good Monsieur Raoul de Vandemar--my poor Armand beat me!\"  De Mauleon shuddered.  \"Say that it is from a customer whose rooms he decorated in his spare hours on his own account before the strike,-- Monsieur --------;\" here he uttered indistinctly some unpronounceable name and hurried off, soon lost as the streets grew darker.  Amid groups of a higher order of men-military men, nobles, _ci-devant_ deputies-- among such ones his name stood very high.  Not only his bravery in the recent sorties had been signal, but a strong belief in his military talents had become prevalent; and conjoined with the name he had before established as a political writer, and the remembrance of the vigour and sagacity with which he had opposed the war, he seemed certain, when peace and order became established, of a brilliant position and career in a future administration: not less because he had steadfastly kept aloof from the existing Government, which it was rumoured, rightly or erroneously, that he had been solicited to join; and from every combination of the various democratic or discontented factions.  Quitting these more distinguished associates, he took his way alone towards the ramparts.  The day was closing; the thunders of the cannon were dying down.  He passed by a wine-shop round which were gathered many of the worse specimens of the _Moblots_ and National Guards, mostly drunk, and loudly talking in vehement abuse of generals and officers and commissariat.  By one of the men, as he came under the glare of a petroleum lamp (there was gas no longer in the dismal city), he was recognised as the commander who had dared to insist on discipline, and disgrace honest patriots who claimed to themselves the sole option between fight and flight.  The man was one of those patriots--one of the new recruits whom Victor had shamed and dismissed for mutiny and cowardice.  He made a drunken plunge at his former chief, shouting, \"A bas Pai-isto!  Comrades, this is the coquin De Mauleon who is paid by the Prussians for getting us killed: a la lanterne!\" \"A la lanterne!\" stammered and hiccupped others of the group; but they did not stir to execute their threat.  Dimly seen as the stern face and sinewy form of the threatened man was by their drowsied eyes, the name of De Mauleon, the man without fear of a foe, and without ruth for a mutineer, sufficed to protect him from outrage; and with a slight movement of his arm that sent his denouncer reeling against the lamp-post, De Mauleon passed on:--when another man, in the uniform of a National Guard, bounded from the door of the tavern, crying with a loud voice, \"Who said De Mauleon?--let me look on him:\" and Victor, who had strode on with slow lion-like steps, cleaving the crowd, turned, and saw before him in the gleaming light a face, in which the bold frank, intelligent aspect of former days was lost in a wild, reckless, savage expression--the face of Armand Monnier.  \"Ha! are you really Victor de Mauleon?\" asked Monnier, not fiercely, but under his breath,--in that sort of stage whisper which is the natural utterance of excited men under the mingled influence of potent drink and hoarded rage.  \"Certainly; I am Victor de Mauleon.\"  \"And you"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7748"],["title","The Parisians â€” Volume 12 (#2)"],["body","in command of the -- company of the National Guard on the 30th of November at Champigny and Villiers?\"  \"I was.\"  \"And you shot with your own hand an officer belonging to another company who refused to join yours?\"  \"I shot a cowardly soldier who ran away from the enemy, and seemed a ringleader of other runaways; and in so doing, I saved from dishonour the best part of his comrades.\"  \"The man was no coward.  He was an enlightened Frenchman, and worth fifty of such aristos as you; and he knew better than his officers that he was to be led to an idle slaughter.  Idle--I say idle.  What was France the better, how was Paris the safer, for the senseless butchery of that day? You mutinied against a wiser general than Saint Trochu when you murdered that mutineer.\"  \"Armand Monnier, you are not quite sober to-night, or I would argue with you that question.  But you no doubt are brave: how and why do you take the part of a runaway?\"  \"How and why?  He was my brother, and you own you murdered him: my brother--the sagest head in Paris.  If I had listened to him, I should not be,--bah!--no matter now what I am.\"  \"I could not know he was your brother; but if he had been mine I would have done the same.\"  Here Victor's lip quivered, for Monnier griped him by the arm, and looked him in the face with wild stony eyes.  \"I recollect that voice!  Yet-- yet--you say you are a noble, a Vicomte--Victor de Mauleon, and you shot my brother!\"  Here he passed his left hand rapidly over his forehead.  The fumes of wine still clouded his mind, but rays of intelligence broke through the cloud.  Suddenly he said in a loud, and calm, and natural voice:  \"Mons. le Vicomte, you accost me as Armand Monnier--pray how do you know my name?\"  \"How should I not know it?  I have looked into the meetings of the 'Clubs rouges.'  I have heard you speak, and naturally asked your name.  _Bon soir_ M. Monnier!  When you reflect in cooler moments, you will see that if patriots excuse Brutus for first dishonouring and then executing his own son, an officer charged to defend his country may be surely pardoned for slaying a runaway to whom he was no relation, when in slaying he saved the man's name and kindred from dishonour--unless, indeed, you insist on telling the world why he was slain.\"  \"I know your voice--I know it.  Every sound becomes clearer to my ear. And if--\"  But while Monnier thus spoke, De Mauleon had hastened on.  Monnier looked round, saw him gone, but did not pursue.  He was just intoxicated enough to know that his footsteps were not steady, and he turned back to the wine-shop and asked surlily for more wine.  Could you have seen him then as he leant swinging himself to and fro against the wall,--had you known the man two years ago, you would have been a brute if you felt disgust. You could only have felt that profound compassion with which we gaze on a great royalty fallen.  For the grandest of all royalties is that which takes its crown from Nature, needing no accident of birth.  And Nature made the mind of Armand Monnier king-like; endowed it with lofty scorn of meanness and falsehood and dishonour, with warmth and tenderness of heart which had glow enough to spare from ties of kindred and hearth and home, to extend to those distant circles of humanity over which royal natures would fain extend the shadow of their sceptre.  How had the royalty of the man's nature fallen thus?  Royalty rarely falls from its own constitutional faults.  It falls when, ceasing to be royal, it becomes subservient to bad advisers.  And what bad advisers, always appealing to his better qualities and so enlisting his worser, had discrowned this mechanic?  \"A little knowledge is a dangerous thing,\" says the old-fashioned poet.  \"Not so,\" says the modern philosopher; \"a little knowledge; is safer than no knowledge.\"  Possibly, as all individuals and all communities must go through the stage of a little knowledge before they can arrive at that of much knowledge, the philosopher's assertion may be right in the long-run, and applied to humankind in general.  But there is a period, as there is a class, in which a little knowledge tends to terrible demoralisation. And Armand Monnier lived in that period and was one of that class.  The little knowledge that his mind, impulsive and ardent, had picked up out of books that warred with the great foundations of existing society, had originated in ill advices.  A man stored with much knowledge would never have let Madame de Grantmesnil's denunciations of marriage rites, or Louis Blane's vindication of Robespierre as the representative of the working against the middle class, influence his practical life.  He would have assessed such opinions at their real worth; and whatever that worth might seem to him, would not to such opinions have committed the conduct of his life.  Opinion is not fateful: conduct is.  A little knowledge crazes an earnest, warm-blooded, powerful creature like Armand Monnier into a fanatic.  He takes an opinion which pleases him as a revelation from the gods; that opinion shapes his conduct; that conduct is his fate. Woe to the philosopher who serenely flings before the little knowledge of the artisan dogmas as harmless as the Atlantis of Plato if only to be discussed by philosophers, and deadly as the torches of Ate if seized as articles of a creed by fanatics!  But thrice woe to the artisan who makes himself the zealot of the Dogma!  Poor Armand acts on the opinions he adopts; proves his contempt for the marriage state by living with the wife of another; resents, as natures so inherently manly must do, the Society that visits on her his defiance of its laws; throws himself, head foremost, against that society altogether; necessarily joins all who have other reasons for hostility to Society; he himself having every inducement not to join indiscriminate strikes--high wages, a liberal employer, ample savings, the certainty of soon becoming employer himself.  No; that is not enough to the fanatic: he persists on being dupe and victim.  He, this great king of labour, crowned by Nature, and cursed with that degree of little knowledge which does not comprehend how much more is required before a schoolboy would admit it to be knowledge at all,--he rushes into the maddest of all speculations--that of the artisan with little knowledge and enormous faith--that which intrusts the safety and repose and dignity of life to some ambitious adventurer, who uses his warm heart for the adventurer's frigid purpose, much as the lawyer-government of September used the Communists,--much as, in every revolution of France, a Bertrand has used a Raton--much as, till the sound of the last trumpet, men very much worse than Victor de Mauleon will use men very much better than Armand Monnier, if the Armand Monniers disdain the modesty of an Isaac Newton on hearing that a theorem to which he had given all the strength of his patient intellect was disputed: \"It may be so;\" meaning, I suppose, that it requires a large amount of experience ascertained before a man of much knowledge becomes that which a man of little knowledge is at a jump-the fanatic of an experiment untried.     CHAPTER II.  Scarcely had De Mauleon quitted Lemercier before the latter was joined by two loungers scarcely less famished than himself--Savarin and De Breze. Like himself, too, both had been sufferers from illness, though not of a nature to be consigned to an hospital.  All manner of diseases then had combined to form the pestilence which filled the streets with unregarded hearses--bronchitis, pneumonia, smallpox, a strange sort of spurious dysentery much more speedily fatal than the genuine.  The three men, a year before so sleek, looked like ghosts under the withering sky; yet all three retained embers of the native Parisian humour, which their very breath on meeting sufficed to kindle up into jubilant sparks or rapid flashes.  \"There are two consolations,\" said Savarin, as the friends strolled or rather crawled towards the Boulevards--\"two consolations for the gourmet and for the proprietor in these days of trial for the gourmand, because the price of truffles is come down.\"  \"Truffles!\" gasped De Breze, with watering mouth; \"impossible!  They are gone with the age of gold.\"  \"Not so.  I speak on the best authority--my laundress; for she attends the _succursale_ in the Rue de Chateaudun; and if the poor woman, being, luckily for me, a childless widow, gets a morsel she can spare, she sells it to me.\"  \"Sells it!\" feebly exclaimed Lemercier.  \"Croesus!  you have money then, and can buy?\"  \"Sells it--on credit!  I am to pension her for life if I live to have money again.  Don't interrupt me.  This honest woman goes this morning to the _succursale_.  I promise myself a delicious _bifteck_ of horse.  She gains the _succursale_, and the employee informs her that there is nothing left in his store except--truffles.  A glut of those in the market allows him to offer her a bargain-seven francs _la boite_.  Send me seven francs, De Breze, and you shall share the banquet.\"  De Breze shook his head expressively.  \"But,\" resumed Savarin, \"though credit exists no more except with my laundress, upon terms of which the usury is necessarily proportioned to the risk, yet, as I had the honour before to observe, there is comfort for the proprietor.  The instinct of property is imperishable.\"  \"Not in the house where I lodge,\" said Lemercier.  \"Two soldiers were billeted there; and during my stay in the ambulance they enter my rooms, and cart away all of the little furniture left there, except a bed and a table.  Brought before a court-martial, they defend themselves by saying, 'The rooms were abandoned.'  The excuse was held valid.  They were let off with a reprimand and a promise to restore what was not already disposed of.  They have restored me another table and four chairs.\" \"Nevertheless, they had the instinct of property, though erroneously developed, otherwise"]]]
