The ringing clank of iron,      The maniac's short, sharp yell!      The hoarse, low curse, throat-stifled;      The starving infant's moan,      The horror of a breaking heart      Poured through a mother's groan.       Up from that loathsome prison      The stricken blind ones cane      Below, had all been darkness,      Above, was still the same.      Yet the holy breath of heaven      Was sweetly breathing there,      And the heated brow of fever      Cooled in the soft sea air.       \"Overboard with them, shipmates!\"      Cutlass and dirk were plied;      Fettered and blind, one after one,      Plunged down the vessel's side.      The sabre smote above,      Beneath, the lean shark lay,      Waiting with wide and bloody jaw      His quick and human prey.       God of the earth! what cries      Rang upward unto thee?      Voices of agony and blood,      From ship-deck and from sea.      The last dull plunge was heard,      The last wave caught its stain,      And the unsated shark looked up      For human hearts in vain.          . . . . . . . . . . . .       Red glowed the western waters,      The setting sun was there,      Scattering alike on wave and cloud      His fiery mesh of hair.      Amidst a group in blindness,      A solitary eye      Gazed, from the burdened slaver's deck,      Into that burning sky.       \"A storm,\" spoke out the gazer,      \"Is gathering and at hand;      Curse on 't, I'd give my other eye      For one firm rood of land.\"      And then he laughed, but only      His echoed laugh replied,      For the blinded and the suffering      Alone were at his side.       Night settled on the waters,      And on a stormy heaven,      While fiercely on that lone ship's track      The thunder-gust was driven.      \"A sail!--thank God, a sail!\"      And as the helmsman spoke,      Up through the stormy murmur      A shout of gladness broke.        Down came the stranger vessel,      Unheeding on her way,      So near that on the slaver's deck      Fell off her driven spray.      \"Ho! for the love of mercy,      We're perishing and blind!\"      A wail of utter agony      Came back upon the wind.       \"Help us! for we are stricken      With blindness every one;      Ten days we've floated fearfully,      Unnoting star or sun.      Our ship 's the slaver Leon,--      We've but a score on board;      Our slaves are all gone over,--      Help, for the love of God!\"       On livid brows of agony      The broad red lightning shone;      But the roar of wind and thunder      Stifled the answering groan;      Wailed from the broken waters      A last despairing cry,      As, kindling in the stormy' light,      The stranger ship went by.              . . . . . . . . .       In the sunny Guadaloupe      A dark-hulled vessel lay,      With a crew who noted never      The nightfall or the day.      The blossom of the orange      Was white by every stream,      And tropic leaf, and flower, and bird      Were in the warns sunbeam.       And the sky was bright as ever,      And the moonlight slept as well,      On the palm-trees by the hillside,      And the streamlet of the dell:      And the glances of the Creole      Were still as archly deep,      And her smiles as full as ever      Of passion and of sleep.       But vain were bird and blossom,      The green earth and the sky,      And the smile of human faces,      To the slaver's darkened eye;      At the breaking of the morning,      At the star-lit evening time,      O'er a world of light and beauty      Fell the blackness of his crime.       1834.     EXPOSTULATION.  Dr. Charles Follen, a German patriot, who had come to America for the freedom which was denied him in his native land, allied himself with the abolitionists, and at a convention of delegates from all the anti- slavery organizations in New England, held at Boston in May, 1834, was chairman of a committee to prepare an address to the people of New England. Toward the close of the address occurred the passage which suggested these lines. \"The despotism which our fathers could not bear in their native country is expiring, and the sword of justice in her reformed hands has applied its exterminating edge to slavery. Shall the United States--the free United States, which could not bear the bonds of a king--cradle the bondage which a king is abolishing? Shall a Republic be less free than a Monarchy? Shall we, in the vigor and buoyancy of our manhood, be less energetic in righteousness than a kingdom in its age?\" --Dr. Follen's Address.  \"Genius of America!--Spirit of our free institutions!--where art thou? How art thou fallen, O Lucifer! son of the morning,--how art thou fallen from Heaven! Hell from beneath is moved for thee, to meet thee at thy coming! The kings of the earth cry out to thee, Aha! Aha! Art thou become like unto us?\"--Speech of Samuel J. May.       OUR fellow-countrymen in chains!      Slaves, in a land of light and law!      Slaves, crouching on the very plains      Where rolled the storm of Freedom's war!      A groan from Eutaw's haunted wood,      A. wail where Camden's martyrs fell,      By every shrine of patriot blood,      From Moultrie's wall and Jasper's well!       By storied hill and hallowed grot,      By mossy wood and marshy glen,      Whence rang of old the rifle-shot,      And hurrying shout of Marion's men!      The groan of breaking hearts is there,      The falling lash, the fetter's clank!      Slaves, slaves are breathing in that air      Which old De Kalb and Sumter drank!       What, ho! our countrymen in chains!      The whip on woman's shrinking flesh!      Our soil yet reddening with the stains      Caught from her scourging, warm and fresh!      What! mothers from their children riven!      What! God's own image bought and sold!      Americans to market driven,      And bartered as the brute for gold!       Speak! shall their agony of prayer      Come thrilling to our hearts in vain?      To us whose fathers scorned to bear      The paltry menace of a chain;      To us, whose boast is loud and long      Of holy Liberty and Light;      Say, shall these writhing slaves of Wrong      Plead vainly for their plundered Right?       What! shall we send, with lavish breath,      Our sympathies across the wave,      Where Manhood, on the field of death,      Strikes for his freedom or a grave?      Shall prayers go up, and hymns be sung      For Greece, the Moslem fetter spurning,      And millions hail with pen and tongue      Our light on all her altars burning?       Shall Belgium feel, and gallant France,      By Vendome's pile and Schoenbrun's wall,      And Poland, gasping on her lance,      The impulse of our cheering call?      And shall the slave, beneath our eye,      Clank o'er our fields his hateful chain?      And toss his fettered arms on high,      And groan for Freedom's gift, in vain?       Oh, say, shall Prussia's banner be      A refuge for the stricken slave?      And shall the Russian serf go free      By Baikal's lake and Neva's wave?      And shall the wintry-bosomed Dane      Relax the iron hand of pride,      And bid his bondmen cast the chain      From fettered soul and limb aside?       Shall every flap of England's flag      Proclaim that all around are free,      From farthest Ind to each blue crag      That beetles o'er the Western Sea?      And shall we scoff at Europe's kings,      When Freedom's fire is dim with us,      And round our country's altar clings      The damning shade of Slavery's curse?       Go, let us ask of Constantine      To loose his grasp on Poland's throat;      And beg the lord of Mahmoud's line      To spare the struggling Suliote;      Will not the scorching answer come      From turbaned Turk, and scornful Russ      \"Go, loose your fettered slaves at home,      Then turn, and ask the like of us!\"       Just God! and shall we calmly rest,      The Christian's scorn, the heathen's mirth,      Content to live the lingering jest      And by-word of a mocking Earth?      Shall our own glorious land retain      That curse which Europe scorns to bear?      Shall our own brethren drag the chain      Which not even Russia's menials wear?       Up, then, in Freedom's manly part,      From graybeard eld to fiery youth,      And on the nation's naked heart      Scatter the living coals of Truth!      Up! while ye slumber, deeper yet      The shadow of our fame is growing!      Up! while ye pause, our sun may set      In blood, around our altars flowing!       Oh! rouse ye, ere the storm comes forth,      The gathered wrath of God and man,      Like that which wasted Egypt's earth,      When hail and fire above it ran.      Hear ye no warnings in the air?      Feel ye no earthquake underneath?      Up, up! why will ye slumber where      The sleeper only wakes in death?       Rise now for Freedom! not in strife      Like that your sterner fathers saw,      The awful waste of human life,      The glory and the guilt of war:'      But break the chain, the yoke remove,      And smite to earth Oppression's rod,      With those mild arms of Truth and Love,      Made mighty through the living God!       Down let the shrine of Moloch sink,      And leave no traces where it stood;      Nor longer let its idol drink      His daily cup of human blood;      But rear another altar there,      To Truth and Love and Mercy given,      And Freedom's gift, and Freedom's prayer,      Shall call an answer down from Heaven!       1834     HYMN.  Written for the meeting of the Anti-Slavery Society, at Chatham Street Chapel, New York, held on the 4th of the seventh month, 1834.        O THOU, whose presence went before      Our fathers in their weary way,      As with Thy chosen moved of yore      The fire by night, the cloud by day!

This wonderful Magic Picture was one of the royal Ozma's greatest treasures.  There was a large gold frame in the center of which was a bluish-gray canvas on which various scenes constantly appeared and disappeared.  If one who stood before it wished to see what any person anywhere in the world was doing, it was only necessary to make the wish and the scene in the Magic Picture would shift to the scene where that person was and show exactly what he or she was then engaged in doing.  So the girls knew it would be easy for them to wish to see Ozma, and from the picture they could quickly learn where she was.  Dorothy advanced to the place where the picture was usually protected by thick satin curtains and pulled the draperies aside.  Then she stared in amazement, while her two friends uttered exclamations of disappointment.  The Magic Picture was gone. Only a blank space on the wall behind the curtains showed where it had formerly hung.     CHAPTER 2  THE TROUBLES OF GLINDA THE GOOD   That same morning there was great excitement in the castle of the powerful Sorceress of Oz, Glinda the Good.  This castle, situated in the Quadling Country, far south of the Emerald City where Ozma ruled, was a splendid structure of exquisite marbles and silver grilles. Here the Sorceress lived, surrounded by a bevy of the most beautiful maidens of Oz, gathered from all the four countries of that fairyland as well as from the magnificent Emerald City itself, which stood in the place where the four countries cornered.  It was considered a great honor to be allowed to serve the good Sorceress, whose arts of magic were used only to benefit the Oz people.  Glinda was Ozma's most valued servant, for her knowledge of sorcery was wonderful, and she could accomplish almost anything that her mistress, the lovely girl Ruler of Oz, wished her to.  Of all the magical things which surrounded Glinda in her castle, there was none more marvelous than her Great Book of Records.  On the pages of this Record Book were constantly being inscribed, day by day and hour by hour, all the important events that happened anywhere in the known world, and they were inscribed in the book at exactly the moment the events happened.  Every adventure in the Land of Oz and in the big outside world, and even in places that you and I have never heard of, were recorded accurately in the Great Book, which never made a mistake and stated only the exact truth.  For that reason, nothing could be concealed from Glinda the Good, who had only to look at the pages of the Great Book of Records to know everything that had taken place. That was one reason she was such a great Sorceress, for the records made her wiser than any other living person.  This wonderful book was placed upon a big gold table that stood in the middle of Glinda's drawing room.  The legs of the table, which were incrusted with precious gems, were firmly fastened to the tiled floor, and the book itself was chained to the table and locked with six stout golden padlocks, the keys to which Glinda carried on a chain that was secured around her own neck.  The pages of the Great Book were larger in size than those of an American newspaper, and although they were exceedingly thin, there were so many of them that they made an enormous, bulky volume.  With its gold cover and gold clasps, the book was so heavy that three men could scarcely have lifted it.  Yet this morning when Glinda entered her drawing room after breakfast, the good Sorceress was amazed to discover that her Great Book of Records had mysteriously disappeared.  Advancing to the table, she found the chains had been cut with some sharp instrument, and this must have been done while all in the castle slept. Glinda was shocked and grieved.  Who could have done this wicked, bold thing?  And who could wish to deprive her of her Great Book of Records?  The Sorceress was thoughtful for a time, considering the consequences of her loss.  Then she went to her Room of Magic to prepare a charm that would tell her who had stolen the Record Book.  But when she unlocked her cupboard and threw open the doors, all of her magical instruments and rare chemical compounds had been removed from the shelves.  The Sorceress has now both angry and alarmed.  She sat down in a chair and tried to think how this extraordinary robbery could have taken place.  It was evident that the thief was some person of very great power, or the theft could not have been accomplished without her knowledge. But who, in all the Land of Oz, was powerful and skillful enough to do this awful thing?  And who, having the power, could also have an object in defying the wisest and most talented Sorceress the world has ever known?  Glinda thought over the perplexing matter for a full hour, at the end of which time she was still puzzled how to explain it.  But although her instruments and chemicals were gone, her KNOWLEDGE of magic had not been stolen, by any means, since no thief, however skillful, can rob one of knowledge, and that is why knowledge is the best and safest treasure to acquire.  Glinda believed that when she had time to gather more magical herbs and elixirs and to manufacture more magical instruments, she would be able to discover who the robber was and what had become of her precious Book of Records.  \"Whoever has done this,\" she said to her maidens, \"is a very foolish person, for in time he is sure to be found out and will then be severely punished.\"  She now made a list of the things she needed and dispatched messengers to every part of Oz with instructions to obtain them and bring them to her as soon as possible.  And one of her messengers met the little Wizard of Oz, who was seated on the back of the famous live Sawhorse and was clinging to its neck with both his arms, for the Sawhorse was speeding to Glinda's castle with the velocity of the wind, bearing the news that Royal Ozma, Ruler of all the great Land of Oz, had suddenly disappeared and no one in the Emerald City knew what had become of her.  \"Also,\" said the Wizard as he stood before the astonished Sorceress, \"Ozma's Magic Picture is gone, so we cannot consult it to discover where she is.  So I came to you for assistance as soon as we realized our loss.  Let us look in the Great Book of Records.\"  \"Alas,\" returned the Sorceress sorrowfully, \"we cannot do that, for the Great Book of Records has also disappeared!\"     CHAPTER 3  THE ROBBERY OF CAYKE THE COOKIE COOK   One more important theft was reported in the Land of Oz that eventful morning, but it took place so far from either the Emerald City or the castle of Glinda the Good that none of those persons we have mentioned learned of the robbery until long afterward.  In the far southwestern corner of the Winkie Country is a broad tableland that can be reached only by climbing a steep hill, whichever side one approaches it.  On the hillside surrounding this tableland are no paths at all, but there are quantities of bramble bushes with sharp prickers on them, which prevent any of the Oz people who live down below from climbing up to see what is on top.  But on top live the Yips, and although the space they occupy is not great in extent, the wee country is all their own.  The Yips had never--up to the time this story begins--left their broad tableland to go down into the Land of Oz, nor had the Oz people ever climbed up to the country of the Yips.  Living all alone as they did, the Yips had queer ways and notions of their own and did not resemble any other people of the Land of Oz. Their houses were scattered all over the flat surface; not like a city, grouped together, but set wherever their owners' fancy dictated, with fields here, trees there, and odd little paths connecting the houses one with another.  It was here, on the morning when Ozma so strangely disappeared from the Emerald City, that Cayke the Cookie Cook discovered that her diamond-studded gold dishpan had been stolen, and she raised such a hue and cry over her loss and wailed and shrieked so loudly that many of the Yips gathered around her house to inquire what was the matter.  It was a serious thing in any part of the Land of Oz to accuse one of stealing, so when the Yips heard Cayke the Cookie Cook declare that her jeweled dishpan had been stolen, they were both humiliated and disturbed and forced Cayke to go with them to the Frogman to see what could be done about it.  I do not suppose you have ever before heard of the Frogman, for like all other dwellers on that tableland, he had never been away from it, nor had anyone come up there to see him.  The Frogman was in truth descended from the common frogs of Oz, and when he was first born he lived in a pool in the Winkie Country and was much like any other frog.  Being of an adventurous nature, however, he soon hopped out of his pool and began to travel, when a big bird came along and seized him in its beak and started to fly away with him to its nest.  When high in the air, the frog wriggled so frantically that he got loose and fell down, down, down into a small hidden pool on the tableland of the Yips.  Now that pool, it seems, was unknown to the Yips because it was surrounded by thick bushes and was not near to any dwelling, and it proved to be an enchanted pool, for the frog grew very fast and very big, feeding on the magic skosh which is found nowhere else on earth except in that one pool.  And the skosh not only made the frog very big so that when he stood on his hind legs he was as tall as any Yip in the country, but it made him unusually intelligent, so that he soon knew more than the Yips did and was able to reason and to argue very well indeed.  No one could expect a "]]]
