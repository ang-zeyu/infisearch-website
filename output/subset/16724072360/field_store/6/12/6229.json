And what makes it so difficult is that its appeal is not to reason. It is to sentiment. To the elemental emotions of the mob. No matter whether its picture is true or false, the result will be the same unless the minds who read it can be cured of its poison. It has become a sensation. Every Northern Congressman has read it. A half million copies have been printed and the presses can't keep up with the demands. This book is storing powder in the souls of the masses who don't know how to think, because they've never been trained to think. This explosive emotion is the preparation for fanaticism. We only wait the coming of the fanatic--the madman who may lift a torch and hurl it into this magazine. The South is asleep. And when we don't sleep, we dance. There's no use fooling ourselves. We're dancing on the crust of a volcano.\"  Pryor rose.  \"I've a number with Mrs. Pryor. I wish you'd think it over, Colonel. This message is my big reason for missing a night session to be here.\"  Lee nodded and strolled out on the lawn before the white pillars of the portico to consider the annoying request. He hated controversy.  Yet he was not the type of man to run from danger. The breed of men from which he sprang had always faced the enemy when the challenge came. In the carriage of his body there was a quiet pride--a feeling not of vanity, but of instinctive power. It was born in him through generations of men who had done the creative thinking of a nation in the building. His face might have been described as a little too regular--a little too handsome perhaps for true greatness, but for the look of deep thought in his piercing eyes. And the finely chiseled lines of character, positive, clean-cut, vigorous. He had backbone.  And yet he was not a bitter partisan. He used his brain. He reasoned. He looked at the world through kindly, conservative eyes. He feared God, only. He believed in his wife, his children, his blood. And he loved Virginia, counting it the highest honor to be--not seem to be--an old-fashioned Virginia gentleman.  He believed in democracy guided by true leaders. This reservation was not a compromise. It was a cardinal principle. He could conceive of no democracy worth creating or preserving which did not produce the superman to lead, shape, inspire and direct its life. The man called of God to this work was fulfilling a divine mission. He must be of the very necessity of his calling a nobleman.  Without vanity he lived daily in the consciousness of his own call to this exalted ideal. It made his face, in repose, grave. His gravity came from the sense of duty and the consciousness of problems to be met and solved as his fathers before him had met and solved great issues.  His conservatism had its roots in historic achievements and the chill that crept into his heart as he thought of this book came, not from the fear of the possible clash of forces in the future, but from the dread of changes which might mean the loss of priceless things in a nation's life. He believed in every fiber of his being that, in spite of slavery, the old South in her ideals, her love of home, her worship of God, her patriotism, her joy of living and her passion for beauty stood for things that are eternal.  And great changes _were_ sweeping over the Republic. He felt this to-day as never before. The Washington on whose lights he stood gazing was rapidly approaching the end of the era in which the Nation had evolved a soul. His people had breathed that soul into the Republic. To this hour the mob had never ruled America. Its spirit had never dominated a crisis. The nation had been shaped from its birth through the heart and brain of its leaders.  But he recalled with a pang that the race of Supermen was passing. Calhoun had died two years ago. Henry Clay had died within the past two months. Daniel Webster lay on his death bed at Mansfield. And there were none in sight to take their places. We had begun the process of leveling. We had begun to degrade power, to scatter talent, to pull down our leaders to the level of the mob, in the name of democracy.  He faced this fact with grave misgivings. He believed that the first requirement of human society, if it shall live, is the discovery of men fit to command--to lead.  With the passing of Clay, Calhoun and Webster the Washington on which he gazed, the Washington of 1852, had ceased to be a forum of great thought, of high thinking and simple living. It had become the scene of luxury and extravagance. The two important establishments of the city were Gautier's, the restaurateur and caterer--the French genius who prepared the feasts for jeweled youth; and Gait, the jeweler who sold the precious stones to adorn the visions of beauty at these banquets.  The two political parties had fallen to the lowest depths of groveling to vote getting by nominating the smallest men ever named for Presidential honors. The Democrats had passed all their real leaders and named as standard-bearer an obscure little politician of New Hampshire, Mr. Franklin Pierce. His sole recommendation for the exalted office was that he would carry one or two doubtful Northern states and with the solid South could thus be elected. The Whig convention in Baltimore had cast but thirty-two votes for Daniel Webster and had nominated a military figurehead, General Winfield Scott.  The Nation was without a leader. And the low rumble of the crowd--the growl of the primal beast--could be heard in the distance with increasing distinctness.  The watcher turned from the White City across the Potomac and slowly walked into his rose garden. Even in September the riot of color was beyond description. In the splendor of the full Southern moon could be seen all shades from deep blood red to pale pink. All sizes from the tiniest four-leaf wild flowers to the gorgeous white and yellow masses that reared their forms like waves of the surf. He breathed the perfume and smiled again. A mocking bird, dropping from the bough of a holly, was singing the glory of a second blooming.  The scene of entrancing beauty drove the thought of strife from his heart. He turned back toward the house and its joys of youth.  Sam's sonorous voice was ringing in deliberation the grand call of the evening's festivities:  \"Choose-yo-pardners-fer-de-ol-Virginy-Reel!\"  And then the stir, the rush, the commotion for place in the final dance. The reel reaches the whole length of the hall with every foot of space crowded. There are thirty couples in line when the musicians pause, tune their instruments and with a sudden burst play \"The Gray Eagle.\" The Virginia Reel stirs the blood of these Southern boys and girls. Its swift, graceful action and the inspiration of the old music seem part of the heart beat of the youth and beauty that sway to its cadences.  The master of Arlington smiled at the memory of the young Congressman's eloquence. Surely it was only a flight of rhetoric.    CHAPTER II   Phil had finally reached the boys' room after the dance, his head in a whirl of excitement. Sleep was the last thing he wished. His imagination was on fire. He had heard of Southern hospitality. He had never dreamed of such waste of good things, such joy in living, such genuine pleasure in the meeting of friends and kinfolks. Custis had insisted on every boy staying all night. A lot of them had stayed. The wide rooms bulged with them. There were cots and pallets everywhere. He had seen the housemaids and the menservants carrying them in after the dance. Their own room contained four beds and as many pallets, and they were all full.  He tried to sleep and couldn't. He dozed an hour, waked at dawn and began day-dreaming. There was no sense of weariness. His mind was too alert. The great house, in which he was made to feel as much at home as in the quiet cottage of his mother in Ohio, fascinated him with its endless menservants, housemaids, serving boys, cooks, coachmen and hostlers.  He thought of the contrast with the quiet efficiency and simplicity of his mother's house. He could see her seated at the little table in the center of the room, a snow-white cap on her head. The work of the house had been done without a servant. It had been done so simply and quietly, he had never been conscious of the fact that it was work at all. It had seemed a ministry of love for her children. Their help had been given with equal joy, unconscious of toil, her kitchen floor was always spotless, with every pot and pan and shining dish in its place as if by magic.  He wondered how Custis' mother could bear the strain of all these people. He wondered how she could manage the army of black servants who hung on her word as the deliverance of an oracle. He could hear the hum of the life of the place already awake with the rising sun. Down in the ravine behind the house he caught the ring of a hammer on an anvil and closer in the sweep of a carpenter's plane over a board. A colt was calling to his mother at the stables and he could hear the chatter and cries of the stable boys busy with the morning feed.  He rose, stepped gingerly beside the sleepers on the floor and stood by an open window. His mind was stirring with a curious desire to see the ghost that haunted this house, its spacious grounds and fields. He, too, had read _Uncle Tom's Cabin_, and wondered. The ghost must be here hiding in some dark corner of cabin or field--the ghost of deathless longing for freedom--the ghost of cruelty--the ghost of the bloodhound, the lash and the auction block.  Somehow he couldn't realize that such things could be, now that he was a guest in a Southern home and saw the bright side of their life. Never had he seen anything brighter than the smiles of those negro musicians as they proudly touched their instruments: the violin, the banjo, the flute, the triangle and castanets, and watched the dancers swing through each number. There could be no mistake about the ring of joy in "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8462"],["title","The Man in Gray: A Romance of North and South (#2)"],["body","Sam's voice. It throbbed with unction. It pulsed with pride. Its joy was contagious. He caught himself glancing at his rolling eyes and swaying body. Once he muttered aloud:  \"Just look at that fool nigger!\"  But somewhere in this paradise of flowers and song birds, of music and dance, of rustling silk, of youth and beauty, the Ghost of Slavery crouched.  In a quiet way he would watch for it to walk. He had to summon all his pride of Section and training in the catch words of the North to keep from falling under the charm of the beautiful life he felt enfolding him.  He no longer wondered why every Northern man who moved South forgot the philosophy of the Snows and became a child of the Sun. He felt the subtle charm of it stealing into his heart and threw off the spell with an effort.  A sparrow chirped under the window. A redbird flashed from a rosebush and a mocking bird from a huge magnolia began to softly sing his morning love song to his mate.  He heard a yawn, turned and saw Custis rubbing his eyes.  \"For heaven's sake, Phil, why don't you sleep?\"  \"Tried and can't.\"  \"Don't like your bed?\"  \"Too much excited.\"  \"One of those girls hooked you?\"  \"No. I couldn't make up my mind. So many beauties they rattled me.\"  \"All right,\" Custis said briskly. \"Let's get up and look around the old plantation.\"  \"Good,\" Phil cried.  Custis called Jeb Stuart in vain. He refused to answer or to budge.  Phil found his shoes at the door neatly blacked and the moment he began to stir a grinning black boy was at his heels to take his slightest order.  \"I don't want _any_thing!\" he said at last to his dusky tormentor.  \"Nuttin tall, sah?\"  \"Nuttin tall!\"  Phil smiled at the eager, rolling eyes.  \"Get out--you make me laugh--\"  The boy ducked.  \"Yassah--des call me if ye wants me--I'se right outside de do'.\"  The two cadets ate breakfast alone. The house was yet asleep--except the children. Their voices could be heard on the lawn at play. They had been put to bed early, at eleven o'clock. They were up with the birds as usual. The sun was an hour high, shining the glory of a perfect September morning. The boys strolled on the lawn. The children were everywhere, playing in groups. Little black and white boys mixed indiscriminately. Robbie Lee was playing rooster fight with Sid, his boon companion. The little black boy born nearest his birthday was dedicated to be his friend, companion and body servant for life.  Phil paused to see the rooster fight.  The boys folded their arms and flew at each other sideways, using their elbows as a rooster uses his spurs.  Robbie was pressing Sid against the fence of the rose garden. Sid's return blows lacked strength.  Robbie stamped his foot angrily.  \"Come on now--no foolin'--fight! There's no fun in a fight, if you don't fight!\"  Sid bucked up and flew at his enemy.  Robbie saw the two older boys watching and gave a star performance. As Sid lunged at him with uplifted arms, and drew back to strike a stunning blow, Robbie suddenly stooped, hurled his elbow under Sid's arm, lifted him clear of the ground and he fell sprawling.  Robbie stood in triumph over the prostrate figure.  Phil laughed.  \"You got him that time, Robbie!\"  Robbie squared himself, raised his spurs and waited for Sid to rise.  Sid was in no hurry. He had enough. He hadn't cried. But he was close to it.  \"Ye needn't put up dem spurs at me no mo'.\"  \"Come on again!\" Robbie challenged.  \"Na, sah. I'se done dead. Ye stick dat spur clean froo me. Hit mighty nigh come out on de odder side!\"  \"Got enough?\"  The game was suddenly ended by a barefoot white boy approaching Robbie. Johnny Doyle carried a dozen teal ducks, six in each hand. They were so heavy for his hands that their heads dragged the ground.  Robbie rushed to meet his friend.  \"Oh, John, where'd you get the ducks?\"  \"Me and daddy killed 'em this mornin' at sun-up on the river.\"  \"Why, the duck season isn't on yet, is it?\" Custis asked the boy.  \"No, sir, but daddy saw a big raft of teal swingin' into the bend of the river yesterday and we got up before daylight and got a mess.\"  \"You brought 'em to me, John?\" Robbie asked eagerly.  \"Jes the same, Robbie. Dad sent 'em to Colonel Lee.\"  \"That's fine of your daddy, John,\" Custis said, placing his hand on the little bare sunburnt head.  \"Yessir, my daddy says Colonel Lee's the greatest man in this county and he's mighty proud to be his neighbor.\"  \"Tell him my father will thank him personally before we leave and say for all that he has given us a treat.\"  Custis handed the ducks to Sid.  \"Take them to the kitchen and tell Aunt Hannah to have them for dinner, sure.\"  Sid started for the kitchen and Robbie called after him:  \"Hurry back, Sid--\"  \"Yassah--right away, sah!\"  Robbie seized John's hand.  \"You'll stay all day?\"  \"I can't.\"  \"We're goin' fishin'--\"  \"Honest?\"  \"Sure. Uncle Ben's sick. But after dinner he's promised to take us. He's not too sick to fish.\"  \"I can't stay,\" the barefoot boy sighed.  \"Come on. There's three bird's nests in the orchard. The second layin'. It ain't no harm to break up the second nest. Birds've no business layin' twice in one season. We _ought_ to break 'em up.\"  \"I'm afraid I can't.\"  His tone grew weaker and Robbie pressed him.  \"Come on. We'll get the bird's eggs and chase the calves and colts till the dinner bell rings, ride the horses home from the fields, and go fishin' after dinner and stay till dark.\"  \"No--\"  \"Come on!\"  John glanced up the road toward the big gate beyond which his mother was waiting his return. The temptation was more than his boy's soul could resist. He shook his head--paused--and grinned.  \"Come on, Sid, John's goin' with us,\" Robbie called to his young henchman as he approached.  \"All right,\" John consented, finally throwing every scruple to the winds. \"Ma'll whip me shore, but, by granny, it'll be worth it!\"  The aristocrat slipped his arm around his chum and led him to the orchard in triumph.  Custis laughed.  \"He'd rather play with that little, poor white rascal than any boy in the country.\"  \"Don't blame him,\" Phil replied. \"He may be dirty and ragged but he's a real boy after a real boy's heart. And the handsomest little beggar I ever saw--who is he?\"  \"The boy of a poor white family, the Doyles. They live just outside our gate on a ten-acre farm. His mother's trying to make him go to school. His father laughs and lets him go hunting and fishing.\"  They were strolling past the first neat row of houses in the servants' quarters. Phil thought of them as the slave quarters. Yet he had not heard the word slave spoken since his arrival. These black people were \"servants\" and some of them were the friends and confidants of their master and his household. Phil paused in front of a cottage. The yard flamed with autumn flowers. Through the open door and windows came the hum of spinning wheels and the low, sweet singing of the dark spinners, spinning wool for the winter clothing of the estate. From the next door came the click and crash of the looms weaving the warm cloth.  \"You make your own cloth?\" the Westerner asked in surprise.  \"Of course, for the servants. It takes six spinners and three weavers working steadily all year to keep up with it, too.\"  \"Isn't it expensive?\"  \"Maybe. We never thought of it. We just make it. Always have in our family for a hundred years.\"  They passed the blacksmith's shop and saw him shoeing a blooded colt. Phil touched the horse's nostrils with a gentle hand and the colt nudged him.  \"It's funny how a horse knows a horseman instinctively--isn't it, Phil?\"  \"Yes. He knows I'm going to join the cavalry.\"  They moved down the long row of whitewashed cottages, each with its yard of flowers and each with a huge pile of wood in the rear--wood enough to keep a sparkling fire through the winter. Chubby-faced babies were playing in the sanded walks and smiling young mothers watched them from the doors.  Phil started to put a question, stammered and was silent.  \"What is it?\" Custis asked.  \"You'll pardon my asking it, old boy, but are these black folks married?\"  The Southern boy laughed heartily.  \"I should say so. A negro wedding is one of the joys of a plantation boy's life.\"  \"But isn't it awful when they're separated?\"  \"They're not separated.\"  \"Never?\"  \"Not on this plantation. Nor on any estate whose master and mistress are our friends. It's not done in our set.\"  \"You keep them when they're old, lazy and worthless?\"  \"If they're married, yes. It's a luxury we never deny ourselves, this softening of the rigor of the slave regime. It's not business. But it's the custom of the country. To separate a husband and wife is an unheard-of thing among our people.\"  The thing that impressed the Westerner in those white rows of little homes was the order and quiet of it all. Every yard was swept clean. There was nowhere a trace of filth or disease-breeding refuse. And birds were singing in the bushes beside these slave cottages as sweetly as they sang for the master and mistress in the pillared mansion on the hill. They passed the stables and paused to watch a dozen colts playing in the inclosure. Beyond the stable under the shadows of great oaks was the dog kennel. A pack of fox hounds rushed to the gate with loud welcome to their young master. He stooped to stroke each head and call each dog's name. A wagging tail responded briskly to every greeting. In another division of the kennel romped a dozen bird-dogs, pointers and setters. The puppies were nearly grown and eager for the fields. They climbed over Custis in yelping puppy joy that refused all rebuffs.  Phil looked in vain for the bloodhounds. He was afraid to ask about them lest he offend his host. Custis had never seen a bloodhound and could not guess the question back of his schoolmate's silence.  Sam entered the inclosure with breakfast for the dogs.  Phil couldn't keep his eyes off the sunlit, ebony face. His smile was contagious. His voice was music.  The Westerner couldn't"]]]
