Here let me have credit for a sober fact.  When the old man had read a page in his book of fate, he bent his keen gray eyes on mine, and proceeded to relate, in all its minute particulars, what was then the most singular event of my life.  It was one which I had no purpose to disclose, till the general unfolding of all secrets; nor would it be a much stranger instance of inscrutable knowledge, or fortunate conjecture, if the beggar were to meet me in the street to-day, and repeat, word for word, the page which I have here written. The fortune-teller, after predicting a destiny which time seems loath to make good, put up his cards, secreted his treasure-bag, and began to converse with the other occupants of the wagon.  “Well, old friend,” said the showman, “you have not yet told us which way your face is turned this afternoon.”  “I am taking a trip northward, this warm weather,” replied the conjurer, “across the Connecticut first, and then up through Vermont, and may be into Canada before the fall.  But I must stop and see the breaking up of the camp-meeting at Stamford.”  I began to think that all the vagrants in New England were converging to the camp-meeting, and had made this wagon their rendezvous by the way.  The showman now proposed that, when the shower was over, they should pursue the road to Stamford together, it being sometimes the policy of these people to form a sort of league and confederacy.  “And the young lady too,” observed the gallant bibliopolist, bowing to her profoundly, “and this foreign gentleman, as I understand, are on a jaunt of pleasure to the same spot.  It would add incalculably to my own enjoyment, and I presume to that of my colleague and his friend, if they could be prevailed upon to join our party.”  This arrangement met with approbation on all hands, nor were any of those concerned more sensible of its advantages than myself, who had no title to be included in it.  Having already satisfied myself as to the several modes in which the four others attained felicity, I next set my mind at work to discover what enjoyments were peculiar to the old   “Straggler,” as the people of the country would have termed the wandering mendicant and prophet. As he pretended to familiarity with the Devil, so I fancied that he was fitted to pursue and take delight in his way of life, by possessing some of the mental and moral characteristics, the lighter and more comic ones, of the Devil in popular stories. Among them might be reckoned a love of deception for its own sake, a shrewd eye and keen relish for human weakness and ridiculous infirmity, and the talent of petty fraud.  Thus to this old man there would be pleasure even in the consciousness, so insupportable to some minds, that his whole life was a cheat upon the world, and that, so far as he was concerned with the public, his little cunning had the upper hand of its united wisdom.  Every day would furnish him with a succession of minute and pungent triumphs: as when, for instance, his importunity wrung a pittance out of the heart of a miser, or when my silly good-nature transferred a part of my slender purse to his plump leather bag; or when some ostentatious gentleman should throw a coin to the ragged beggar who was richer than himself; or when, though he would not always be so decidedly diabolical, his pretended wants should make him a sharer in the scanty living of real indigence.  And then what an inexhaustible field of enjoyment, both as enabling him to discern so much folly and achieve such quantities of minor mischief, was opened to his sneering spirit by his pretensions to prophetic knowledge.  All this was a sort of happiness which I could conceive of, though I had little sympathy with it.  Perhaps, had I been then inclined to admit it, I might have found that the roving life was more proper to him than to either of his companions; for Satan, to whom I had compared the poor man, has delighted, ever since the time of Job, in “wandering up and down upon the earth”; and indeed a crafty disposition, which operates not in deep-laid plans, but in disconnected tricks, could not have an adequate scope, unless naturally impelled to a continual change of scene and society.  My reflections were here interrupted.  “Another visitor!” exclaimed the old showman.  The door of the wagon had been closed against the tempest, which was roaring and blustering with prodigious fury and commotion, and beating violently against our shelter, as if it claimed all those homeless people for its lawful prey, while we, caring little for the displeasure of the elements, sat comfortably talking.  There was now an attempt to open the door, succeeded by a voice, uttering some strange, unintelligible gibberish, which my companions mistook for Greek, and I suspected to be thieves’ Latin.  However, the showman stepped forward, and gave admittance to a figure which made me imagine; either that our wagon had rolled back two hundred years into past ages, or that the forest and its old inhabitants had sprung up around us by enchantment.  It was a red Indian, armed with his bow and arrow.  His dress was a sort of cap, adorned with a single feather of some wild bird, and a frock of blue cotton, girded tight about him; on his breast, like orders of knighthood, hung a crescent and a circle, and other ornaments of silver; while a small crucifix betokened that our Father the Pope had interposed between the Indian and the Great Spirit, whom he had worshipped in his simplicity.  This son of the wilderness, and pilgrim of the storm, took his place silently in the midst of us. When the first surprise was over, I rightly conjectured him to be one of the Penobscot tribe, parties of which I had often seen, in their summer excursions down our Eastern rivers.  There they paddle their birch canoes among the coasting schooners, and build their wigwam beside some roaring milldam, and drive a little trade in basket-work where their fathers hunted deer.  Our new visitor was probably wandering through the country towards Boston, subsisting on the careless charity of the people, while he turned his archery to profitable account by shooting at cents, which were to be the prize of his successful aim.  The Indian had not long been seated, ere our merry damsel sought to draw him into conversation.  She, indeed, seemed all made up of sunshine in the mouth of May; for there was nothing so dark and dismal that her pleasant mind could not cast a glow over it; and the wild Indian, like a fir-tree in his native forest, soon began to brighten into a sort of sombre cheerfulness.  At length, she inquired whether his journey had any particular end or purpose.  “I go shoot at the camp-meeting at Stamford,” replied the Indian.  “And here are five more,” said the girl, “all aiming at the camp-meeting too.  You shall be one of us, for we travel with light hearts; and as for me, I sing merry songs, and tell merry tales, and am full of merry thoughts, and I dance merrily along the road, so that there is never any sadness among them that keep me company.  But, O, you would find it very dull indeed, to go all the way to Stamford alone!”  My ideas of the aboriginal character led me to fear that the Indian would prefer his own solitary musings to the gay society thus offered him; on the contrary, the girl’s proposal met with immediate acceptance, and seemed to animate him with a misty expectation of enjoyment.  I now gave myself up to a course of thought which, whether it flowed naturally from this combination of events, or was drawn forth by a wayward fancy, caused my mind to thrill as if I were listening to deep music.  I saw mankind, in this weary old age of the world, either enduring a sluggish existence amid the smoke and dust of cities, or, if they breathed a purer air, still lying down at night with no hope but to wear out to-morrow, and all the to-morrows which make up life, among the same dull scenes and in the same wretched toil that had darkened the sunshine of to-day.  But there were some, full of the primeval instinct, who preserved the freshness of youth to their latest years by the continual excitement of new objects, new pursuits, and new associates; and cared little, though their birthplace might have been here in New England, if the grave should close over them in Central Asia.  Fate was summoning a parliament of these free spirits; unconscious of the impulse which directed them to a common centre, they had come hither from far and near; and last of all appeared the representative of those mighty vagrants, who had chased the deer during thousands of years, and were chasing it now in the Spirit Land.  Wandering down through the waste of ages, the woods had vanished around his path; his arm had lost somewhat of its strength, his foot of its fleetness, his mien of its wild regality, his heart and mind of their savage virtue and uncultured force; but here, untamable to the routine of artificial life, roving now along the dusty road, as of old over the forest leaves, here was the Indian still.  “Well,” said the old showman, in the midst of my meditations, “here is an honest company of us,--one, two, three, four, five, six,--all going to the camp-meeting at Stamford.  Now, hoping no offence, I should like to know where this young gentleman may be going?”  I started.  How came I among these wanderers?  The free mind, that preferred its own folly to another’s wisdom; the open spirit, that found companions everywhere; above all, the restless impulse, that had so often made me wretched in the midst of enjoyments: these were my claims to be of their society.  “My friends!” cried I, stepping into the centre of the wagon, “I am going with you to the camp-meeting at Stamford.”  “But in what capacity?” asked the old showman, after a moment’s silence.  “All of us here can get our bread in some creditable"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9214"],["title","The White Old Maid (From \"Twice Told Tales\") (#1)"],["body","boy burst forth from a door, and ran, with open arms, towards the ghostly woman, seeming to expect a kiss from her bloodless lips.  She made a slight pause, fixing her eye upon him with an expression of no earthly sweetness, so that the child shivered and stood awe-struck, rather than affrighted, while the Old Maid passed on.  Perhaps her garment might have been polluted even by an infant’s touch; perhaps her kiss would have been death to the sweet boy, within a year.  “She is but a shadow,” whispered the superstitious.   “The child put forth his arms and could not grasp her robe!”  The wonder was increased, when the Old Maid passed beneath the porch of the deserted mansion, ascended the moss-covered steps, lifted the iron knocker, and gave three raps.  The people could only conjecture, that some old remembrance, troubling her bewildered brain, had impelled the poor woman hither to visit the friends of her youth; all gone from their home, long since and forever, unless their ghosts still haunted it,--fit company for the  “Old Maid in the Winding-Sheet.”  An elderly man approached the steps, and reverently uncovering his gray locks, essayed to explain the matter.  “None, Madam,” said he, “have dwelt in this house these fifteen years agone,--no, not since the death of old Colonel Fenwicke, whose funeral you may remember to have followed.  His heirs being ill-agreed among themselves, have let the mansion-house go to ruin.”  The Old Maid looked slowly round, with a slight gesture of one hand, and a finger of the other upon her lip, appearing more shadow-like than ever, in the obscurity of the porch.  But again she lifted the hammer, and gave, this time, a single rap.  Could it be that a footstep was now heard, coming down the staircase of the old mansion, which all conceived to have been so long untenanted?  Slowly, feebly, yet heavily, like the pace of an aged and infirm person, the step approached, more distinct on every downward stair, till it reached the portal.  The bar fell on the inside; the door was opened.  One upward glance, towards the church-spire, whence the sunshine had just faded, was the last that the people saw of the “Old Maid in the Winding-Sheet.”  “Who undid the door?” asked many.  This question, owing to the depth of shadow beneath the porch, no one could satisfactorily answer.  Two or three aged men, while protesting against an inference, which might be drawn, affirmed that the person within was a negro, and bore a singular resemblance to old Caesar, formerly a slave in the house, but freed by death some thirty years before.  “Her summons has waked up a servant of the old family,” said one, half seriously.  “Let us wait here,” replied another.   “More guests will knock at the door, anon.  But the gate of the graveyard should be thrown open!”  Twilight had overspread the town, before the crowd began to separate, or the comments on this incident were exhausted.  One after another was wending his way homeward, when a coach--no common spectacle in those days--drove slowly into the street.  It was an old-fashioned equipage, hanging close to the ground, with arms on the panels, a footman behind, and a grave, corpulent coachman seated high in front,--the whole giving an idea of solemn state and dignity.  There was something awful, in the heavy rumbling of the wheels.  The coach rolled down the street, till, coming to the gateway of the deserted mansion, it drew up, and the footman sprang to the ground.  “Whose grand coach is this?” asked a very inquisitive body.  The footman made no reply, but ascended the steps of the old house, gave three raps with the iron hammer, and returned to open the coach-door.  An old man possessed of the heraldic lore so common in that day examined the shield of arms on the panel.  “Azure, a lion’s head erased, between three flower-deluces,” said he; then whispered the name of the family to whom these bearings belonged. The last inheritor of its honors was recently dead, after a long residence amid the splendor of the British court, where his birth and wealth had given him no mean station.  “He left no child,” continued the herald, “and these arms, being in a lozenge, betoken that the coach appertains to his widow.”  Further disclosures, perhaps, might have been made, had not the speaker suddenly been struck dumb, by the stern eye of an ancient lady, who thrust forth her head from the coach, preparing to descend. As she emerged, the people saw that her dress was magnificent, and her figure dignified, in spite of age and infirmity,--a stately ruin, but with a look, at once, of pride and wretchedness.  Her strong and rigid features had an awe about them, unlike that of the white Old Maid, but as of something evil.  She passed up the steps, leaning on a gold-headed cane; the door swung open, as she ascended,--and the light of a torch glittered on the embroidery of her dress, and gleamed on the pillars of the porch.  After a momentary pause--a glance backwards--and then a desperate effort--she went in.  The decipherer of the coat of arms had ventured up the lowest step, and shrinking back immediately, pale and tremulous, affirmed that the torch was held by the very image of old Caesar.  “But, such a hideous grin,” added he, “was never seen on the face of mortal man, black or white!  It will haunt me till my dying day.”  Meantime, the coach had wheeled round, with a prodigious clatter on the pavement, and rumbled up the street, disappearing in the twilight, while the ear still tracked its course.  Scarcely was it gone, when the people began to question whether the coach and attendants, the ancient lady, the spectre of old Caesar, and the Old Maid herself, were not all a strangely combined delusion, with some dark purport in its mystery.  The whole town was astir, so that, instead of dispersing, the crowd continually increased, and stood gazing up at the windows of the mansion, now silvered by the brightening moon.  The elders, glad to indulge the narrative propensity of age, told of the long-faded splendor of the family, the entertainments they had given, and the guests, the greatest of the land, and even titled and noble ones from abroad, who had passed beneath that portal.  These graphic reminiscences seemed to call up the ghosts of those to whom they referred.  So strong was the impression, on some of the more imaginative hearers, that two or three were seized with trembling fits, at one and the same moment, protesting that they had distinctly heard three other raps of the iron knocker.  “Impossible!” exclaimed others.   “See!  The moon shines beneath the porch, and shows every part of it, except in the narrow shade of that pillar.  There is no one there!”  “Did not the door open?”  whispered one of these fanciful persons.  “Didst thou see it, too?” said his companion, in a startled tone.  But the general sentiment was opposed to the idea, that a third visitant had made application at the door of the deserted house. A few, however, adhered to this new marvel, and even declared that a red gleam, like that of a torch, had shone through the great front window, as if the negro were lighting a guest up the staircase.  This, too, was pronounced a mere fantasy.  But, at once, the whole multitude started, and each man beheld his own terror painted in the faces of all the rest.  “What an awful thing is this!” cried they.  A shriek, too fearfully distinct for doubt, had been heard within the mansion, breaking forth suddenly, and succeeded by a deep stillness, as if a heart had burst in giving it utterance.  The people knew not whether to fly from the very sight of the house, or to rush trembling in, and search out the strange mystery. Amid their confusion and affright, they were somewhat reassured by the appearance of their clergyman, a venerable patriarch, and equally a saint, who had taught them and their fathers the way to heaven, for more than the space of an ordinary lifetime.  He was a reverend figure, with long, white hair upon his shoulders, a white beard upon his breast, and a back so bent over his staff, that he seemed to be looking downward, continually, as if to choose a proper grave for his weary frame.  It was some time before the good old man, being deaf, and of impaired intellect, could be made to comprehend such portions of the affair as were comprehensible at all.  But, when possessed of the facts, his energies assumed unexpected vigor.  “Verily,” said the old gentleman, “it will be fitting that I enter the mansion-house of the worthy Colonel Fenwicke, lest any harm should have befallen that true Christian woman, whom ye call the ‘Old Maid in the Winding-Sheet.’”  Behold, then, the venerable clergyman ascending the steps of the mansion, with a torch-bearer behind him.  It was the elderly man, who had spoken to the Old Maid, and the same who had afterwards explained the shield of arms, and recognized the features of the negro.  Like their predecessors, they gave three raps, with the iron hammer.  “Old Caesar cometh not,” observed the priest.  “Well, I wot, he no longer doth service in this mansion.”  “Assuredly, then, it was something worse, in old Caesar’s likeness!”  said the other adventurer.  “Be it as God wills,” answered the clergyman.  “See! my strength, though it be much decayed, hath sufficed to open this heavy door. Let us enter, and pass up the staircase.”  Here occurred a singular exemplification of the dreamy state of a very old man’s mind.  As they ascended the wide flight of stairs, the aged clergyman appeared to move with caution, occasionally standing aside, and oftener bending his head, as it were in salutation, thus practising all the gestures of one who makes his way through a throng. Reaching the head of the staircase, he looked around, with sad and solemn benignity, laid aside his staff, bared his hoary locks, and was evidently on the point of commencing a prayer.  “Reverend Sir,” said his attendant, who conceived this a very suitable"]]]
