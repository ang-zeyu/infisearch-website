In the home, the little sheltered, love-guarded home of the farmer, the mechanic and the artizen (makin' special mention of the buzz sawyers). And also in the palace walls and the throne. There and every _where_ men would fain shelter wimmen from every care, and every labor, even the lightest and slightest.  Then lastly came the _howsumever_. He proceeded to show _how_ this could be done. And he proved it right out (or thought he did) that the first great requisit' to accomplish all this, wuz to keep wimmen in her place. Keep her from settin' on the Conference, and all other tottlin' eminences, fitted only for man's stalwart strength.  And the end of the article wuz so sort of tragick and skairful that Josiah wept when he read it. He pictured it out in such strong colors, the danger there wuz of puttin' wimmen, or allowin' her to put herself in such a high and percipitous place, such a skairful and dangerous posture as settin' up on a Conference.  [Illustration: \"JOSIAH WEPT WHEN HE READ IT.\"]  \"To have her set up on it,\" sez the writer, in conclusion, \"would endanger her life, her spiritual, her mental and her moral growth. It would shake the permanency of the sacred home relations to its downfall. It would hasten anarchy, and he thought sizm.\"  Why, Josiah Allen handled that paper as if it wuz pure gold. I know he asked me anxiously as he handed it to me to read, \"if my hands wuz perfectly clean,\" and we had some words about it.  And till he could pass it on to Deacon Sypher to read he kep it in the Bible. He put it right over in Galatians, for I looked to see--Second Galatians.  And he wrapped it up in a soft handkerchief when he carried it over to Deacon Sypherses. And Deacon Sypher treasured it like a pearl of great price (so I spoze) till he could pass it on to Deacon Henzy.  And Deacon Henzy was to carry it with care to a old male Deacon in Zoar, bed rid.  Wall, as I say, that is the very first I had read about their bein' any idee promulgated of wimmens settin' up on the Conference.  And I, in spite of Josiah Allen's excitement, wuz in favor on't from the very first.  Yes, I wuz awfully in favor of it, and all I went through durin' the next and ensuin' weeks didn't put the idee out of my head. No, far from it. It seemed as if the severer my sufferin's wuz, the much more this idee flourished in my soul. Just as a heavy plow will meller up the soil so white lilies can take root, or any other kind of sweet posies.  And oh! my heart! wuz not my sufferin's with Lodema Trumble, a hard plow and a harrowin' one, and one that turned up deep furrows?  But of this, more anon and bimeby.     CHAPTER II.   Wall, it wuz on the very next day--on a Thursday as I remember well, for I wuz a-thinkin' why didn't Lodema's letter come the next day--Fridays bein' considered onlucky--and it being a day for punishments, hangin's, and so forth.  But it didn't, it came on a Thursday. And my companion had been to Jonesville and brung me back two letters; he brung 'em in, leavin' the old mair standin' at the gate, and handed me the letters, ten pounds of granulated sugar, a pound of tea, and the request I should have supper on the table by the time that he got back from Deacon Henzy's.  (On that old buzz-saw business agin, so I spozed, but wouldn't ask.)  Wall, I told him supper wuz begun any way, and he had better hurry back. But he wuz belated by reason of Deacon Henzy's bein' away, so I set there for some time alone.  Wall, I wuz goin' to have some scolloped oysters for supper, so the first thing I did wuz to put 'em into the oven--they wuz all ready, I had scolloped 'em before Josiah come, and got 'em all ready for the oven--and then I set down and read my letters.  Wall, the first one I opened wuz from Lodema Trumble, Josiah's cousin on his own side. And her letter brought the sad and harrowin' intelligence that she was a-comin' to make us a good long visit. The letter had been delayed. She was a-comin' that very night, or the next day. Wall, I sithed deep. I love company dearly, but--oh my soul, is there not a difference, a difference in visitors?  Wall, suffice it to say, I sithed deep, and opened the other letter, thinkin' it would kind o' take my mind off.  And for all the world! I couldn't hardly believe my eyes. But it wuz! It wuz from Serena Fogg. It wuz from the Authoress of \"Wedlock's Peaceful Repose.\"  I hadn't heard a word from her for upwards of four years. And the letter brung me startlin' intelligence.  It opened with the unexpected information that she wuz married. She had been married three years and a half to a butcher out to the Ohio.  And I declare my first thought wuz as I read it, \"Wall, she has wrote dretful flowery on wedlock, and its perfect, onbroken calm, and peaceful repose, and now she has had a realizin' sense of what it really is.\"  But when I read a little further, I see what the letter wuz writ for. I see why, at this late day, she had started up and writ me a letter. I see it wuz writ on duty.  She said she had found out that I wuz in the right on't and she wuzn't. She said that when in the past she had disputed me right up and down, and insisted that wedlock wuz a state of perfect serenity, never broken in upon by any cares or vexations whatsomever, she wuz in the wrong on't.  She said she had insisted that when anybody had moored their barks into that haven of wedded life, that they wuz forever safe from any rude buffetin's from the world's waves; that they wuz exempt from any toil, any danger, any sorrow, any trials whatsomever. And she had found she was mistook.  She said I told her it wuz a first-rate state, and a satisfactory one for wimmen; but still it had its trials, and she had found it so. She said that I insisted its serenity wuz sometimes broken in upon, and she had found it so. The last day at my house had tottled her faith, and her own married experience had finished the work. Her husband wuz a worthy man, and she almost worshipped him. But he had a temper, and he raved round considerable when meals wuzn't ready on time, and she havin' had two pairs of twins durin' her union (she comes from a family on her mother's side, so I had hearn before, where twins wuz contagious), she couldn't always be on the exact minute. She had to work awful hard; this broke in on her serenity.  Her husband devotedly loved her, so she said; but still, she said, his bootjack had been throwed voyalent where corns wuz hit onexpected.  [Illustration: \"FOUR TWINS BROKE IN ALSO ON HER WAVELESS CALM.\"]  Their souls wuz mated firm as they could be in deathless ties of affection and confidence, yet doors _had_ been slammed and oaths emitted, when clothin' rent and buttons tarried not with him. Strange actions and demeanors had been displayed in hours of high-headedness and impatience, which had skaired her almost to death before gettin' accustomed to 'em.  The four twins broke in also on her waveless calm. They wuz lovely cherubs, and the four apples of her eyes. But they did yell at times, they kicked, they tore round and acted; they made work--lots of work. And one out of each pair snored. It broke up each span, as you may say. The snorin' filled each room devoted to 'em.  _He_ snored, loud. A good man and a noble man he wuz, so she repeated it, but she found out too late--too late, that he snored. The house wuz small; she could _not_ escape from snores, turn she where she would. She got tired out with her work days, and couldn't rest nights. Her husband, as he wuz doin' such a flourishin' business, had opened a cattle-yard near the house. She wuz proud of his growin' trade, but the bellerin' of the cattle disturbed her fearfully. Also the calves bleating and the lambs callin' on their dams.  It wuz a long letter, filled with words like these, and it ended up by saying that for years now she had wanted to write and tell me that I had been in the right on't and she in the wrong. I had been megum and she hadn't. And she ended by sayin', \"God bless me and adoo.\"  [Illustration: THE LECTURE.]  The fire crackled softly on the clean hearth. The teakettle sung a song of welcome and cheer. The oysters sent out an agreeable atmosphere. The snowy table, set out in pretty china and glassware, looked invitin', and I set there comfortable and happy and so peaceful in my frame, that the events of the past, in which Serena Fogg had flourished, seemed but as yesterday.  I thought it all over, that pleasant evenin' in the past, when Josiah Allen had come in unexpected, and brung the intelligence to me that there wuz goin' to be a lectur' give that evenin' by a young female at the Jonesville school-house, and beset me to go.  And I give my consent. Then my mind travelled down that pleasant road, moongilded, to the school-house. It stopped on the door-step while Josiah hitched the mair.  We found the school-house crowded full, fur a female lecturer wuz a rarity, and she wuz a pretty girl, as pretty a girl as I ever see in my life.  And it wuz a pretty lecture, too, dretful pretty. The name of the lecture wuz, \"Wedlock's Peaceful and Perfect Repose.\"  A pretty name, I think, and it wuz a beautiful lecture, very, and extremely flowery. It affected some of the hearers awfully; they wuz all carried away with it. Josiah Allen wept like a child durin' the rehearsin' of it. I myself didn't weep, but I enjoyed it, some of it, first rate.  I can't begin to tell it all as she did, 'specially after this length of time, in such a lovely, flowery way, but I can probably give a few of the heads of it.  It hain't no ways likely that I can give the heads half the stylish, eloquent look that she did as she held 'em up, but I can jest give the bare heads.  She said that there had been a effort made in some directions to try to speak against the holy state of matrimony. The papers had been full of the subject, \"Is Marriage a Failure, or is it not?\"  She had even read these dreadful words--\"Marriage is a Failure.\" She hated"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9444"],["title","Samantha among the Brethren â€” Volume 2 (#1)"],["body"," jest begun yet, I presume I shall have lots and lots of new things happen to me before night. Because it is jest as I tell you, when things get to happenin' there hain't no tellin' when they will ever stop.\"  Miss Fogg groaned, a low, deep groan, and that is every word she said, only after a little while she spoke up, and sez:  \"You hain't eaten a bit of dinner; it all got cold while you wuz a changin' your dress.\"  \"Oh, wall,\" sez I, \"I can get along some way. And I must hurry up and get the table cleared off any way, and get to my work agin', for I have got to do a lot of cookin' this afternoon. It takes a sight of pies and cakes and such to satisfy twelve or a dozen men.\"  So I went to work vigorously agin. But well might I tell Miss Fogg \"that the day had only jest begun, and there wuz time for lots of things to happen before night,\" for I had only jest got well to work on the ingregiences of my pies when Submit Tewksbury sent over \"to see if I could let her have them sturchien seeds I had promised her--she wanted 'em to run up the inside of her bedroom winder, and shade her through the winter. She wuz jest a-settin' out her winter stock of flower roots and seeds, and wanted 'em immegiatly, and to once, that is, if it was perfectly convenient,\" so the boy said.  Submit is a good creeter, and she wouldn't have put that burden on me on such a time for nothin', not if she had known my tribulations; but she didn't, and I felt that one trial more wouldn't, as the poet hath well said, \"either make or break me.\"  So I went to huntin' for the seeds. Wall, it wuz a good half-hour before I could find 'em, for of course it wuz natural nater, accordin' to the total deprivity of things, that I should find 'em in the bottom of the last bag of seeds that I overhauled.  But Submit had been disappointed, and I didn't want to make her burdens any heavier, so I sent her the sturchien seeds.  But it wuz a trial I do admit to look over more than forty bags of garden and flower seeds in such a time as that. But I sent 'em. I sent Submit the sturchien seeds, and then I laid to work again fast as I possibly could.  But I sez to the author of \"Peaceful Repose,\" I sez to her, sez I:  \"I feel bad to think I hain't gettin' no time to hear you rehearse your lecture, but you can see jest how it is; you see I hain't had a minute's time today. Mebby I will get a few minutes' time before night; I will try to,\" sez I.  \"Oh,\" sez she, \"it hain't no matter about that; I--I--I somehow--I don't feel like rehearsin' it as it was.\" Sez she, \"I guess I shall make some changes in it before I rehearse it agin.\"  Sez I, \"You lay out to make a more mean thing of it, more megum.\"  \"Yes,\" sez she, in faint axents, \"I am a-thinkin' of it.\"  [Illustration: \"AS I STARTED FOR THE BUTTERY.\"]  \"Wall,\" sez I cheerfully, as I started for the buttery with a pile of cups in one hand, the castor and pickle dish in the other, and a pile of napkins under my arm, \"I believe I shall like it as well again if you do, any way,\" sez I, as I kicked away the cat that wuz a-clawin' my dress, and opened the door with my foot, both hands bein' full.  \"Any way, there will be as much agin truth in it.\"  Wall, I went to work voyalently, and in two hours' time I had got my work quelled down some. But I had to strain nearly every nerve in the effort.  And I am afraid I didn't use the colporter just exactly right, who come when I wuz right in the midst of puttin' the ingregiences into my tea cakes. I didn't enter so deep into the argument about the Revised New Testament as I should in easier and calmer times. I conversed considerable, I argued some with him, but I didn't get so engaged as mebby I had ort to. He acted disappointed, and he didn't stay and talk more'n an hour and three quarters.  He generally spends half a day with us. He is a master hand to talk; he'll make your brain fairly spin round he talks so fast and handles such large, curius words. He talked every minute, only when I wuz a-answerin' his questions.  [Illustration: \"THERE WUZ SOMETHIN' WRONG ABOUT 'EM.\"]  Wall, he had jest gone, the front gate had just clicked onto him, when Miss Philander Dagget came in at the back door. She had her press-board in  her hand, and a coat over her arm, and I see in a minute that I had got another trial onto me. I see I had got to set her right.  I set her a chair, and she took off her sun-bonnet and hung it over the back of her chair, and set down, and then she asked me if I could spend time to put in the sleeves of her husband's coat. She said \"there wuz somethin' wrong about em', but she didn't know what.\"  She said \"she wouldn't have bothered me that day when I had so much round, but Philander had got to go to a funeral the next day, as one of the barriers, and he must have his coat.\"  Wall, I wrung my hands out of the dish-water they was in at the time, and took the coat and looked at it, and the minute I set my eyes on it I see what ailed it I see she had got the sleeves sot in so the elbows come right in front of his arms, and if he had wore it in that condition to the funeral or anywhere else he would have had to fold up his arms right acrost his back; there wuzn't no other possible way.  And then I turned tailoress and helped her out of her trouble. I sot the sleeves in proper, and fixed the collar. She had got it sot on as a ruffle. I drawed it down smooth where it ort to be and pinned it--and she went home feelin' first rate.  I am very neighborly, and helpful, and am called so. Jonesville would miss me if any thing should happen.  [Illustration: \"SHE IS APT TO GET THINGS WRONG.\"]  I have often helped that woman a sight. She is a good, willin' creeter, but she is apt to get things wrong, dretful apt. She made her little boy's pantaloons once wrong side before, so it would seem that he would have to set down from the front side, or else stand up.  And twice she got her husband's pantaloons sewed up so there wuz no way to get into em' only to crawl up into 'em through the bottom of the legs. But I have always made a practice of rippin' and tearin' and bastin', and settin' her right, and I did now.  Wall, she hadn't hardly got out of the back door, when Josiah Allen came in in awful distress, he had got a thorn in his foot, he had put on an old pair of boots, and there wuz a hole in the side of one of 'em, and the thorn had got in through the hole. It pained him dretfully, and he wuz jest as crazy as a loon for the time bein'. And he hollered the first thing that \"he wanted some of Hall's salve.\" And I told him \"there wuzn't a mite in the house.\"  And he hollered up and says, \"There would be some if there wuz any sense in the head of the house.\"  [Illustration: \"HE WANTED SOME OF HALL'S SALVE.\"]  I glanced up mechanically at his bald head, but didn't say nothin', for I see it wouldn't do. And he hollered out agin, \"Why hain't there any Hall's salve?\"  Sez I, \"Because old Hall has been dead for years and years, and hain't made any salve.\"  \"Wall, he wouldn't have been dead if he had had any care took of him,\" he yelled out.  \"Why,\" sez I, \"he wuz killed by lightnin'; struck down entirely onexpected five years ago last summer.\"  \"Oh, argue and dispute with a dying man. Gracious Peter! what will become of me!\" he groaned out, a-holdin' his foot in his hand.  Sez I, \"Let me put some Pond's Extract on it, Josiah.\"  \"Pond's Extract!\" he yelled, and then he called that good remedy words I wuz ashamed to hear him utter.  And he jumped round and pranced and kicked just as it is the nater of man to act under bodily injury of that sort. And then he ordered me to take a pin and get the thorn out, and then acted mad as a hen at me all the time I wuz a-doin' it; acted jest as if I wuz a-prickin' him a-purpose.  He talked voyalent and mad. I tried to hush him down; I told him the author of \"Wedlock's Peaceful Repose\" would hear him, and he hollered back \"he didn't care a cent who heard him. He wuz killed, and he shouldn't live to trouble anybody long if that pain kept up.\"  His acts and words wuz exceedingly skairful to anybody who didn't understand the nater of a man. But I wuzn't moved by 'em so much as the width of a horse hair. Good land! I knew that jest as soon as the pain subsided he would be good as gold, so I kep' on, cool and collected, and got the thorn out, and did up the suffering toe in Pond's Extract, and I hadn't only jest got it done, when, for all the world! if I didn't see a double team stop in front of the house, and I peeked through the winder and see as it wuz the livery stable man from Jonesville, and he had brung down the last straws to be lifted onto the camel's back--a hull lot of onexpected company. A hull load of 'em.  There wuz the Baptist minister and his wife and their three children, and the minister's wife's sister-in-law from the West, who wuz there a-visitin', and the editor of the _Augur'ses_ wife (she wuz related to the visitor from the West by marriage) and three of the twins. And old Miss Minkley, she wuz acquainted with the visitor's mother, used to go to school with her. And Drusilly Sypher, she wuz the visitor from the West's bosom friend, or used to be.  Wall, they had all come down to spend the afternoon and visit with each other, and with me and Josiah, and stay to supper.     CHAPTER VI.   The author of \"Peaceful Repose\" sez to me, and she looked pale and skairt; she had heard every word Josiah had said, and she wuz dretful skairt and shocked (not knowin' the ways of men, and not understandin', as I said prior and before, that in two hours' time he would be jest as good as the very best kind of pie, affectionate, and even spoony, if I would allow spoons, which I will not the most of the time). Wall, she proposed, Miss Fogg did, that she should ride back with the livery man. And though I urged her to stay till night, I couldn't urge her as hard as I would otherwise, for by that time the head of the procession of visitors had reached the"]]]
