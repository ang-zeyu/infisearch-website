It was an evil day for Belgium when her frontier was violated, but it was a worse one for Germany. I venture to prophesy that it will be regarded by history as the greatest military as well as political error that has ever been made. Had the great guns that destroyed Liége made their first breach at Verdun, what chance was there for Paris? Those few weeks of warning and preparation saved France, and left Germany as she now is, like a weary and furious bull, tethered fast in the place of trespass and waiting for the inevitable pole-axe.  We were glad to get out of the place, for the gloom of it lay as heavy upon our hearts as the shrapnel helmets did upon our heads. Both were lightened as we sped back past empty and shattered villas to where, just behind the danger line, the normal life of rural Flanders was carrying on as usual. A merry sight helped to cheer us, for scudding down wind above our heads came a Boche aeroplane, with two British at her tail barking away with their machine guns, like two swift terriers after a cat. They shot rat-tat-tatting across the sky until we lost sight of them in the heat haze over the German line.         *       *       *       *       *  The afternoon saw us on the Sharpenburg, from which many a million will gaze in days to come, for from no other point can so much be seen. It is a spot forbid, but a special permit took us up, and the sentry on duty, having satisfied himself of our bona fides, proceeded to tell us tales of the war in a pure Hull dialect which might have been Chinese for all that I could understand. That he was a 'terrier' and had nine children were the only facts I could lay hold of. But I wished to be silent and to think--even, perhaps, to pray. Here, just below my feet, were the spots which our dear lads, three of them my own kith, have sanctified with their blood. Here, fighting for the freedom of the world, they cheerily gave their all. On that sloping meadow to the left of the row of houses on the opposite ridge the London Scottish fought to the death on that grim November morning when the Bavarians reeled back from their shot-torn line. That plain away on the other side of Ypres was the place where the three grand Canadian brigades, first of all men, stood up to the damnable cowardly gases of the Hun. Down yonder is Hill 60, that blood-soaked kopje. The ridge over the fields was held by the cavalry against two army corps, and there where the sun strikes the red roof among the trees I can just see Gheluveld, a name for ever to be associated with Haig and the most vital battle of the war. As I turn away I am faced by my Hull Territorial, who still says incomprehensible things. I look at him with other eyes. He has fought on yonder plain. He has slain Huns, and he has nine children. Could any one better epitomise the duties of a good citizen? I could have found it in my heart to salute him had I not known that it would have shocked him and made him unhappy.  It has been a full day, and the next is even fuller, for it is my privilege to lunch at Headquarters, and to make the acquaintance of the Commander-in-chief and of his staff. It would be an invasion of private hospitality if I were to give the public the impressions which I carried from that charming château. I am the more sorry, since they were very vivid and strong. This much I will say--and any man who is a face reader will not need to have it said--that if the Army stands still it is not by the will of its commander. There will, I swear, be no happier man in Europe when the day has come and the hour. It is human to err, but never possibly can some types err by being backward. We have a superb army in France. It needs the right leader to handle it. I came away happier and more confident than ever as to the future.  Extraordinary are the contrasts of war. Within three hours of leaving the quiet atmosphere of the Headquarters Château I was present at what in any other war would have been looked upon as a brisk engagement. As it was it would certainly figure in one of our desiccated reports as an activity of the artillery. The noise as we struck the line at this new point showed that the matter was serious, and, indeed, we had chosen the spot because it had been the storm centre of the last week. The method of approach chosen by our experienced guide was in itself a tribute to the gravity of the affair. As one comes from the settled order of Flanders into the actual scene of war, the first sign of it is one of the stationary, sausage-shaped balloons, a chain of which marks the ring in which the great wrestlers are locked. We pass under this, ascend a hill, and find ourselves in a garden where for a year no feet save those of wanderers like ourselves have stood. There is a wild, confused luxuriance of growth more beautiful to my eye than anything which the care of man can produce. One old shell-hole of vast diameter has filled itself with forget-me-nots, and appears as a graceful basin of light blue flowers, held up as an atonement to heaven for the brutalities of man. Through the tangled bushes we creep, then across a yard--'Please stoop and run as you pass this point'--and finally to a small opening in a wall, whence the battle lies not so much before as beside us. For a moment we have a front seat at the great world-drama, God's own problem play, working surely to its magnificent end. One feels a sort of shame to crouch here in comfort, a useless spectator, while brave men down yonder are facing that pelting shower of iron.        *       *       *       *       *  There is a large field on our left rear, and the German gunners have the idea that there is a concealed battery therein. They are systematically searching for it. A great shell explodes in the top corner, but gets nothing more solid than a few tons of clay. You can read the mind of Gunner Fritz. 'Try the lower corner!' says he, and up goes the earth-cloud once again. 'Perhaps it's hid about the middle. I'll try.' Earth again, and nothing more. 'I believe I was right the first time after all,' says hopeful Fritz. So another shell comes into the top corner. The field is as full of pits as a Gruyère cheese, but Fritz gets nothing by his perseverance. Perhaps there never was a battery there at all. One effect he obviously did attain. He made several other British batteries exceedingly angry. 'Stop that tickling, Fritz!' was the burden of their cry. Where they were we could no more see than Fritz could, but their constant work was very clear along the German line. We appeared to be using more shrapnel and the Germans more high explosives, but that may have been just the chance of the day. The Vimy Ridge was on our right, and before us was the old French position, with the labyrinth of terrible memories and the long hill of Lorette. When, last year, the French, in a three weeks' battle, fought their way up that hill, it was an exhibition of sustained courage which even their military annals can seldom have beaten.  And so I turn from the British line. Another and more distant task lies before me. I come away with the deep sense of the difficult task which lies before the Army, but with a deeper one of the ability of these men to do all that soldiers can ever be asked to perform. Let the guns clear the way for the infantry, and the rest will follow. It all lies with the guns. But the guns, in turn, depend upon our splendid workers at home, who, men and women, are doing so grandly. Let them not be judged by a tiny minority, who are given, perhaps, too much attention in our journals. We have all made sacrifices in the war, but when the full story comes to be told, perhaps the greatest sacrifice of all is that which Labour made when, with a sigh, she laid aside that which it had taken so many weary years to build.     A GLIMPSE OF THE ITALIAN ARMY   One meets with such extreme kindness and consideration among the Italians that there is a real danger lest one's personal feeling of obligation should warp one's judgment or hamper one's expression. Making every possible allowance for this, I come away from them, after a very wide if superficial view of all that they are doing, with a deep feeling of admiration and a conviction that no army in the world could have made a braver attempt to advance under conditions of extraordinary difficulty.  First a word as to the Italian soldier. He is a type by himself which differs from the earnest solidarity of the new French army, and from the businesslike alertness of the Briton, and yet has a very special dash and fire of its own, covered over by a very pleasing and unassuming manner. London has not yet forgotten Durando of Marathon fame. He was just such another easy smiling youth as I now see everywhere around me. Yet there came a day when a hundred thousand Londoners hung upon his every movement--when strong men gasped and women wept at his invincible but unavailing spirit. When he had fallen senseless in that historic race on the very threshold of his goal, so high was the determination within him, that while he floundered on the track like a broken-backed horse, with the senses gone out of him, his legs still continued to drum upon the cinder path. Then when by pure will power he staggered to his feet and drove his dazed body across the line, it was an exhibition of pluck which put the little sunburned baker straightway among London's heroes. Durando's spirit is alive to-day, I see thousands of him all around me. A thousand such, led by a few young gentlemen of the type who occasionally give us object lessons in how to ride at Olympia, make no mean battalion. It has been a war of most desperate ventures, but never once has there been a lack of volunteers. The Tyrolese are good men--too good to be fighting in so rotten a cause. But from first to last the Alpini have had the ascendency in the hill fighting,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9878"],["title","The Survey of Cornwall (#1)"],["body"," but fourteen Years     old, and yet three Years standing, he was call'd out     to dispute ex tempore, before the Earls of Leicester     and Warwick, with the matchless Sir Philip Sidney.                              Si quaeritis hujus     Fortunam pugnae, non est superatus ab illo.      Ask you the End of this Contest ?     They neither had the better, both the best.\"  Mr. Wood expresses it thus:      \"At fourteen Years of Age\", says he (k), \"he disputed     ex tempore with the matchless Philip Sidney, (while he     was a young (l) Man, I suppose) in the presence of the     Earls of Leicester, Warwick, and other Nobility, at what     time they were lodged in Christ-Church, to receive     entertainment from the Muses.\"  Mr. Wood says afterwards, that      \"After Mr. Carew had spent three Years in Oxon, he retired     to the Middle Temple, where he spent 3 Years more\" (m) ;  which may be true, tho' he brings in no Authority for it. But what he adds, that      \"then he was sent with his Uncle (Sir George Carew     as it seems) in his Embassage unto the King of Poland;     whom when he came to Dantzick, he found that he had     been newly gone from thence into Sweden, whither also     he went after him :\"  And that      \"After his return, and a short stay made in England,     he was sent by his Father into France with Sir Hen.     Nevill, who was then Ambassador Leiger unto K. Hen. 4.     that he might learn the French Tongue, which by reading     and talking, he overcame in three quarters of a Year :\"  All this, I say, cannot hold, if it be true that, tho' he understood Italian, French, High-Dutch, and Spanish, he had never been out of England ; as his Countryman Charles Fitzgeffry seems to assert in the following Compliment to him:       Quis Deus tibi tam bene invocatus (n),     Disertissime millium trecentum     Idemq; optime omnium CARAEE,     (Seu quis multiplicem eruditionem,     Seu quis, quo magis emicas elenchum     Morum ponderet elegantiorum,     Virtutumq; tot auream coronam)     Quis (inquam) Deus (o Deus profecto!)     Tantis te spoliis, tot & trophaeis     Terrarum locupletat exterarum,     Domi perpetuo interim morantem     Et libris patriaeque servientem?     Quo Graij tibi, quo tibi Latini     Auri pondera tanta? quove Hetrusci,     Galli, Teutones, invidiq; Iberi     Tam assatim te opibus suis bearunt?     O si tot Deus ora, totq; linguas     Mihi idulserit, ut tuas referrem     Laudes, quot dedit ora quotq; linguas     Tibi uno Deus ore, lingua in una?  I may add, that Mr. Carew, in his Survey of Cornwall, giving an account of the eminent Men born in that Dutchy, reckons among the Civilians Doctor Carew (o) :      \"In the Civil Law\", says he (p), \"there lived of     late Doctor Kennals, and now (q) doth Doctor Carew,     one of the antientest Masters of the Chancery; in     which Calling, after his younger Years spent abroad     to his benefit, he hath reposed himself.\"  He mentions him again among the Persons employed in State Affairs, and therethrough stept to Preferment (r).      \"Master George Carew\", says he, \"in his younger Years     gathered such Fruit as the University, the Inns of     Court, and Foreign Travel could yield him.  Upon his     Return, he was first call'd to the Bar, then supply'd     the Place of Secretary to the Lord Chancellor Hatton;     and after his Decease, performed the like Office to his     two Successors, by special Recommendation from her     Majesty, who also gave him the Prothonotaryship of the     Chancery; and in anno 1598 sent him Ambassador to the     King of Poland, and other Northern Potentates, where     through unexpected Accidents, he underwent extraordinary     Perils; but God freed him from them, and he performed his     Duty in acceptable manner : And at this present the     Commonwealth  useth his Service, as a Master of the Chancery.\"  Had our Author attended this worthy Person in his Embassies, it is hardly possible he should not have taken some notice of it here; being elsewhere so ready to honour himself with the Friendship or Acquaintance of the Great Men of his Time.  As to what Mr. Wood adds, viz. that Mr. Carew was sent by his Father into France with Sir Henry Nevill.... that he might learn the French Tongue, &c. I am afraid he hath mistaken our Author for his Son, who, in effect, went into France with a Nevill, in order to learn the French Tongue ; as it appears by the following Verses of the aforesaid Fitzgeffry, upon his Return.

Learning is not only useful, but necessary in all Conditions and States of Life; but I will presume to say, that it is more particularly so to all Gentlemen, who are allotted to live in the Country.  And if they cannot pass their leisure Hours in reading, or cultivating Arts and Sciences, they will spend that time in such things as must be detrimental to their Families, and, at the end, fatal to their own Persons.  Our Author could never fall into those Inconveniences : He loved Letters, and not only made them subservient to his own Entertainment, but sometimes useful to the Publick.  As he was a great Master of Languages, he delivered his Opinion upon the true and ready way to learn the Latin Tongue, in answer to a Quaere, Whether the ordinary way by teaching Latin by the Rules of Grammar, be the best way for Youths to learn it (y)?  He wrote likewise a Dissertation, shewing the Excellency of the English Tongue (z) : and published a Translation of the Examen de Ingenios para las Sciencias, written by Juan Huerte, that ingenious and learned Spanish Physician.  It was printed at London in 1594, with this Title:  The Examination of Mens Wits.  In which, by discovering the Variety of Natures, is shewed for what Profession each one is apt, and how far he shall profit therein (A).  His Proficiency in natural Philosophy, enabled him to improve Agriculture and Husbandry to such a degree, that he was accounted among his Neighbours the greatest Husband, and most excellent Manager of Bees in Cornwall (B).  The Enquiries he had made into the History and Antiquities of Nations, and chiefly of Great Britain, engaged him to attempt a Description of Cornwall; as it is natural to every Man to have a particular Fondness for his native Country:      Nescio qua natale solum dulcedine cunctos       Ducit & immemores non finit esse sui.  This he only undertook for his private Satisfaction and Entertainment; but was afterwards prevail'd upon by his Friends to publish it, as we shall see anon. Mr. Camden, who had seen it, and was an excellent Judge in those Matters, thought himself obliged to do justice both to the Author and his Performance, in the first Edition of his Britannia, printed in the Year 1586:      \"But these Matters\" (says he, at the end of his Account     of Cornwall) \"will be laid open more distinctly and     fully, by Richard Carew of Antonie, a Person no less     eminent for his honourable Ancestors, than his own     Virtue and Learning, who is writing a Description of     this Country, not in little, but at large.\"      Sed haec planius & plenius docebit Richardus Carew     de Antonie, non minus generis splendore, quam virtute &     doctrina nobilis; qui hujus regionis descriptionem     latiore specie, & non ad tenue elimat (D).  Our Author's Knowledge in the Laws, his Love for Justice and Equity, and his Affection to the Government, rais'd him to all the Posts of Honour, that are consistent with a Country Life. Mr. Wood assures us (E), that he was made Justice of the Peace in 1581, High-Sheriff of Cornwall in 1586, and about that time was the Queens Deputy for the Militia. And indeed we find in his Survey of Cornwall, that he was Justice of the Peace, and one of the Quorum (F) : and that in the Year 1599, (Sir Walter Raleigh being then Lieutenant General of Cornwall) Mr. Carew was one of the Deputy Lieutenants, Treasurer of the Lieutenancy, and Colonel of a Regiment, consisting of five Companies, or 500 Men, armed with 170 Pikes, 300 Musquets, and 30 Calivers, appointed for Causam Bay (G).  There was at that time a Society of several Gentlemen, eminent for their Learning and Merit, such as Sir Robert Cotton, Mr. Dodderidge, (afterwards Sir John Dodderidge, who died one of the Judges of the King's-Bench) Mr. Camden, Mr. Stow, &c. who had regular Meetings, or Conferences, for the Improvement and Illustration of the History and Antiquities of England.  That Society had a particular Claim to our Author; and in 1589 he was elected a Member of the College of the Antiquaries (H).  The Oration he made at his Introduction, contained, (as I am informed by a Gentleman who saw it)      \"an elegant Display of the Devastations Time so     swiftly makes "]]]
