As its tinkle sounded somewhere up the yard behind, he thrust his whistle into Viner's hand.  \"Mr. Viner,\" he said, \"go up to the end of the passage and blow on that as loud as you can, three times. I'll stand by here till you come back. If you don't hear or see any of our people coming from either direction, blow again.\"  Viner heard steps coming down the yard behind the door as he walked away. And he heard more steps, hurrying steps, as he reached the end of the passage. He turned it to find an inspector and a sergeant approaching from one part of the terrace, a constable from another.  \"You're wanted down here,\" said Viner as they all converged on him. \"There's been murder! One of your men's there--he gave me this whistle to summon further help. This way!\"  The police followed him in silence down the passage. Another figure had come on the scene. Bending over the body and closely scrutinizing it in the light of the policeman's lantern was a man whom Viner knew well enough by sight--a tall, handsome man, whose olive-tinted complexion, large lustrous eyes and Vandyke beard gave him the appearance of a foreigner. Yet though he had often seen him, Viner did not know his name; the police-inspector, however, evidently knew it well enough.  \"What is it, Dr. Cortelyon?\" he asked as he pushed himself to the front. \"Is the man dead?\"  Dr. Cortelyon drew himself up from his stooping position to his full height--a striking figure in his dress jacket and immaculate linen. He glanced round at the expectant faces.  \"The man's been murdered!\" he said in calm, professional accents. \"He's been stabbed clean through the heart. Dead? Yes, for several minutes.\"  \"Who found him here?\" demanded the inspector.  \"I found him,\" answered Viner. He gave a hurried account of the whole circumstances as he knew them, the police watching him keenly. \"I should know the man again if I saw him,\" he concluded. \"I saw his face clearly enough as he passed me.\"  The inspector bent down and hastily felt the dead man's pockets.  \"Nothing at all here,\" he said as he straightened himself. \"No watch or chain or purse or anything. Looks like robbery as well as murder. Does anybody know him?\"  \"I know who this gentlemen is, sir,\" answered the policeman to whom Viner had first gone. \"He's a Mr. Ashton, who came to live not so long since at number seven in Markendale Square, close by Mr. Viner there. I've heard that he came from the Colonies.\"  \"Do you know him,\" asked the inspector, turning to Viner.  \"Only by sight,\" answered Viner. \"I've seen him often, but I didn't know his name. I believe he has a wife and daughter--\"  \"No sir,\" interrupted the policeman. \"He was a single gentleman. The young lady at number seven is his ward, and the older lady looked after her--sort of a companion.\"  The Inspector looked round. Other policemen, attracted by the whistle, were coming into the passage at each end, and he turned to his sergeant.  \"Put a man at the top and another at the bottom of this passage,\" he said. \"Keep everybody out. Send for the divisional surgeon. Dr. Cortelyon, will you see him when he comes along? I want him to see the body before its removal. Now, then, about these ladies--they'll have to be told.\" He turned to Viner. \"I understand you live close by them?\" he asked. \"Perhaps you'll go there with me?\"  Viner nodded; and the inspector, after giving a few more words of instruction to the sergeant, motioned him to follow; together they went down the passage into Markendale Square.  \"Been resident here long, Mr. Viner?\" asked the Inspector as they emerged. \"I noticed that some of my men knew you. I've only recently come into this part myself.\"  \"Fifteen years,\" answered Viner.  \"Do you know anything of this dead man?\"  \"Nothing--not so much as your constable knows.\"  \"Policemen pick things up. These ladies, now? It's a most unpleasant thing to have to go and break news like this. You know nothing about them, sir?\"  \"Not even as much as your man knew. I've seen them often--with him, the dead man. There's an elderly lady and a younger one, a mere girl. I took them for his wife and daughter. But you heard what your man said.\"  \"Well, whatever they are, they've got to be told. I'd be obliged if you'd come with me. And then--that fellow you saw running away! You'll have to give us as near a description of him as you can. What number did my man say it was--seven?\"  Viner suddenly laid a hand on his companion's sleeve. A smart car, of the sort let out on hire from the more pretentious automobile establishments, had just come round the corner and was being pulled up at the door of a house in whose porticoed front hung a brilliant lamp.  \"That's number seven,\" said Viner. \"And--those are the two ladies.\"  The Inspector stopped and watched. The door of the house opened, letting a further flood of light on the broad step beneath the portico and on the pavement beyond; the door of the car opened too, and a girl stepped out, and for a second or two stood in the full glare of the lamps. She was a slender, lissome young creature, gowned in white, and muffled to the throat in an opera cloak out of which a fresh, girlish face, bright in colour, sparkling of eye, crowned by a mass of hair of the tint of dead gold, showed clearly ere she rapidly crossed to the open door. After her came an elderly, well-preserved woman in an elaborate evening toilette, the personification of the precise and conventional chaperon. The door closed; the car drove away; the Inspector turned to Viner with a shake of his head.  \"Just home from the theatre!\" he said. \"And--to hear this! Well, it's got to be done, Mr. Viner, anyhow.\"  Viner, who had often observed the girl whom they had just seen with an interest for which he had never troubled to account, found himself wishing that Miss Penkridge was there in his place. He did not know what part he was to play, what he was to do or say; worse than that, he did not know if the girl in whose presence he would certainly find himself within a minute or two was very fond of the man whom he had just found done to death. In that case--but here his musings were cut short by the fact that the Inspector had touched the bell in the portico of number seven, and that the door had opened, to reveal a smart and wondering parlour-maid, who glanced with surprise at the inspector's uniform.  \"Hush! This is Mr. Ashton's?\" said the Inspector. \"Yes--well, now, what is the name of the lady--the elderly lady--I saw come in just now? Keep quiet, there's a good girl,--the fact is, Mr. Ashton's had an accident, and I want to see that lady.\"  \"Mrs. Killenhall,\" answered the parlour-maid.  \"And the young lady--her name?\" asked the Inspector.  \"Miss Wickham.\"  The Inspector walked inside the house.  \"Just ask Mrs. Killenhall and Miss Wickham if they'll be good enough to see Inspector Drillford for a few minutes,\" he said. Then, as the girl closed the door and turned away up the inner hall, he whispered to Viner. \"Better see both and be done with it. It's no use keeping bad news too long; they may as well know--both.\"  The parlour-maid reappeared at the door of a room along the hall; and the two men, advancing in answer to her summons, entered what was evidently the dining-room of the house. The two ladies had thrown off their wraps; the younger one sat near a big, cheery fire, holding her slender fingers to the blaze; the elder stood facing the door in evident expectancy. The room itself was luxuriously furnished in a somewhat old-fashioned, heavy style; everything about it betokened wealth and comfort. And that its owner was expected home every minute was made evident to the two men by the fact that a spirit-case was set on the centre table, with glasses and mineral waters and cigars; Viner remembered, as his eyes encountered these things, that a half-burned cigar lay close to the dead man's hand in that dark passage so close by.  \"Mrs. Killenhall? Miss Wickham?\" began Drillford, looking sharply from one to the other. \"Sorry to break in on you like this, ladies, but the fact is, there has been an accident to Mr. Ashton, and I'm obliged to come and tell you about it.\"  Viner, who had remained a little in the background, was watching the faces of the two to whom this initial breaking of news was made. And he saw at once that there was going to be no scene. The girl by the fire looked for an instant at the inspector with an expression of surprise, but it was not the surprise of great personal concern. As for the elder woman, after one quick glance from Drillford to Viner, whom she evidently recognized, she showed absolute self-possession.  \"A bad accident?\" she asked.  Drillford again looked from the elder to the younger lady.  \"You'll excuse me if I ask what relation you ladies are to Mr. Ashton?\" he said with a significant glance at Mrs. Killenhall.  \"None!\" replied Mrs. Killenhall. \"Miss Wickham is Mr. Ashton's ward. I am Miss Wickham's chaperon--and companion.\"  \"Well, ma'am,\" said Drillford, \"then I may tell you that my news is--just about as serious as it possibly could be, you understand.\"  In the silence that followed, the girl turned toward the visitors, and Viner saw her colour change a little. And it was she who first spoke.  \"Don't be afraid to tell us,\" she said. \"Is Mr. Ashton dead?\"  Drillford inclined his head, and spoke as he was bidden.  \"I'm sorry to say he is,\" he replied. \"And still more to be obliged to tell you that he came to his death by violence. The truth is--\"  He paused, looking from one to the other, as if to gauge the effect of his words. And again it was the girl who spoke.  \"What is the truth?\" she asked.  \"Murder!\" said Drillford. \"Just that!\"  Mrs. Killenhall, who had remained standing until then, suddenly sat down, with a murmur of horror. But the girl was watching the inspector steadily.  \"When was this? and how, and where?\" she "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9903"],["title","Way of the Lawless (#1)"],["body","came toward Andy with a crackling like musketry, and it was plain that it would leap through Martindale and away into the country beyond at a bound. Andy could see now that it was a roadster, low-hung, ponderous, to keep the road.  Pat Gregg was leaving the saloon; he was on his horse, but he sat the saddle slanting, and his head was turned to give the farewell word to several figures who bulged through the door of the saloon. For that reason, as well as because of the fumes in his brain, he did not hear the coming of the automobile. His friends from the saloon yelled a warning, but he evidently thought it some jest, as he waved his hand with a grin of appreciation. The big car was coming, rocking with its speed; it was too late now to stop that flying mass of metal.  But the driver made the effort. His brakes shrieked, and still the car shot on with scarcely abated speed, for the wheels could secure no purchase in the thin sand of the roadway. Andy's heart stood still in sympathy as he saw the face of the driver whiten and grow tense. Charles Merchant, the son of rich John Merchant, was behind the wheel. Drunken Pat Gregg had taken the warning at last. He turned in the saddle and drove home his spurs, but even that had been too late had not Charles Merchant taken the big chance. At the risk of overturning the machine he veered it sharply to the left. It hung for a moment on two wheels. Andy could count a dozen heartbeats while the plunging car edged around the horse and shoved between Pat and the wall of the house--inches on either side. Yet it must have taken not more than the split part of a second.  There was a shout of applause from the saloon; Pat Gregg sat his horse, mouth open, his face pale, and then the heavy car rolled past the blacksmith shop. Andy, breathing freely and cold to his finger tips, saw young Charlie Merchant relax to a flickering smile as the girl beside him caught his arm and spoke to him.  And then Andy saw her for the first time.  In the brief instant as the machine moved by, he printed the picture to be seen again when she was gone. What was the hair? Red bronze, and fiery where the sun caught at it, and the eyes were gray, or blue, or a gray-green. But colors did not matter. It was all in her smile and the turning of her eyes, which were very wide open. She spoke, and it was in the sound of her voice. \"Wait!\" shouted Andy Lanning as he made a step toward them. But the car went on, rocking over the bumps and the exhaust roaring. Andy became aware that his shout had been only a dry whisper. Besides, what would he say if they did stop?  And then the girl turned sharply about and looked back, not at the horse they had so nearly struck, but at Andy standing in the door of his shop. He felt sure that she would remember his face; her smile had gone out while she stared, and now she turned her head suddenly to the front. Once more the sun flashed on her hair; then the machine disappeared. In a moment even the roar of the engine was lost, but it came back again, flung in echoes from some hillside.  Not until all was silent, and the boys from the saloon were shaking hands with Pat and laughing at him, did Andy turn back into the blacksmith shop. He sat down on the anvil with his heart beating, and began to recall the picture. Yes, it was all in the smile and the glint of the eyes. And something else--how should he say it?--of the light shining through her.  He stood up presently, closed the shop, and went home. Afterward his uncle came in a fierce humor, slamming the door. He found Andy sitting in front of the table staring down at his hands.  \"Buck Heath has been talkin' about you,\" said Jasper.  Andy raised his head. \"Look at 'em!\" he said as he spread out his hands. \"I been scrubbin' 'em with sand soap for half an hour, and the oil and the iron dust won't come out.\"  Uncle Jasper, who had a quiet voice and gentle manners, now stood rigid. \"I wisht to God that some iron dust would work its way into your soul,\" he said.  \"What are you talking about?\"  \"Nothin' you could understand; you need a mother to explain things to you.\"  The other got up, white about the mouth. \"I think I do,\" said Andy. \"I'm sick inside.\"  \"Where's supper?\" demanded Jasper.  Andy sat down again, and began to consider his hands once more. \"There's something wrong--something dirty about this life.\"  \"Is there?\" Uncle Jasper leaned across the table, and once again the old ghost of a hope was flickering behind his eyes. \"Who's been talkin' to you?\"  He thought of the grinning men of the saloon; the hidden words. Somebody might have gone out and insulted Andy to his face for the first time. There had been plenty of insults in the past two years, since Andy could pretend to manhood, but none that might not be overlooked. \"Who's been talkin' to you?\" repeated Uncle Jasper. \"Confound that Buck Heath! He's the cause of all the trouble!\"  \"Buck Heath! Who's he? Oh, I remember. What's he got to do with the rotten life we lead here, Uncle Jas?\"  \"So?\" said the old man slowly. \"He ain't nothin'?\"  \"Bah!\" remarked Andy. \"You want me to go out and fight him? I won't. I got no love for fighting. Makes me sort of sickish.\"  \"Heaven above!\" the older man invoked. \"Ain't you got shame? My blood in you, too!\"  \"Don't talk like that,\" said Andy with a certain amount of reserve which was not natural to him. \"You bother me. I want a little silence and a chance to think things out. There's something wrong in the way I've been living.\"  \"You're the last to find it out.\"  \"If you keep this up I'm going to take a walk so I can have quiet.\"  \"You'll sit there, son, till I'm through with you. Now, Andrew, these years I've been savin' up for this moment when I was sure that--\"  To his unutterable astonishment Andy rose and stepped between him and the door. \"Uncle Jas,\" he said, \"mostly I got a lot of respect for you and what you think. Tonight I don't care what you or anybody else has to say. Just one thing matters. I feel I've been living in the dirt. I'm going out and see what's wrong. Good night.\"     CHAPTER 3   Uncle Jas was completely bowled over. Over against the wall as the door closed he was saying to himself: \"What's happened? What's happened?\" As far as he could make out his nephew retained very little fear of the authority of Jasper Lanning.  One thing became clear to the old man. There had to be a decision between his nephew and some full-grown man, otherwise Andy was very apt to grow up into a sneaking coward. And in the matter of a contest Jasper could not imagine a better trial horse than Buck Heath. For Buck was known to be violent with his hands, but he was not likely to draw his gun, and, more than this, he might even be bluffed down without making a show of a fight. Uncle Jasper left his house supperless, and struck down the street until he came to the saloon.  He found Buck Heath warming to his work, resting both elbows on the bar. Bill Dozier was with him, Bill who was the black sheep in the fine old Dozier family. His brother, Hal Dozier, was by many odds the most respected and the most feared man in the region, but of all the good Dozier qualities Bill inherited only their fighting capacity. He fought; he loved trouble; and for that reason, and not because he needed the money, he was now acting as a deputy sheriff. He was jesting with Buck Heath in a rather superior manner, half contemptuous, half amused by Buck's alcoholic swaggerings. And Buck was just sober enough to perceive that he was being held lightly. He hated Dozier for that treatment, but he feared him too much to take open offense. It was at this opportune moment that old man Lanning, apparently half out of breath, touched Buck on the elbow.  As Buck turned with a surly \"What the darnation?\" the other whispered: \"Be on your way, Buck. Get out of town, and get out of trouble. My boy hears you been talkin' about him, and he allows as how he'll get you. He's out for you now.\"  The fumes cleared sufficiently from Buck Heath's mind to allow him to remember that Jasper Lanning's boy was no other than the milk-blooded Andy. He told Jasper to lead his boy on. There was a reception committee waiting for him there in the person of one Buck Heath.  \"Don't be a fool, Buck,\" said Jasper, glancing over his shoulder. \"Don't you know that Andy's a crazy, man-killin' fool when he gets started? And he's out for blood now. You just slide out of town and come back when his blood's cooled down.\"  Buck Heath took another drink from the bottle in his pocket, and then regarded Jasper moodily. \"Partner,\" he declared gloomily, putting his hand on the shoulder of Jasper, \"maybe Andy's a man-eater, but I'm a regular Andy-eater, and here's the place where I go and get my feed. Lemme loose!\"  He kicked open the door of the saloon. \"Where is he?\" demanded the roaring Andy-eater. Less savagely, he went on: \"I'm lookin' for my meat!\"  Jasper Lanning and Bill Dozier exchanged glances of understanding. \"Partly drunk, but mostly yaller,\" observed Bill Dozier. \"Soon as the air cools him off outside he'll mount his hoss and get on his way. But, say, is your boy really out for his scalp?\" \"Looks that way,\" declared Jasper with tolerable gravity.  \"I didn't know he was that kind,\" said Bill Dozier. And Jasper flushed, for the imputation was clear. They went together to the window and looked out.  It appeared that Bill Dozier was right. After standing in the middle of the street in the twilight for a moment, Buck Heath turned and went straight for his horse. A low murmur passed around the saloon, for other men were at the windows watching. They had heard Buck's talk earlier in the day, and they growled as they saw him turn tail.  Two moments more and Buck would have been on his horse, but in those two moments luck took a hand. Around the corner came Andrew Lanning with his head bowed in thought. At once a roar went up from every throat in the saloon: \"There's your man. Go to him!\"  Buck Heath"]]]
