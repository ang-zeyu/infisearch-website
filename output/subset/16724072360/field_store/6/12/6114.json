Happily unconscious of these hostile prepossessions, the elder Signora chatted on very gayly to the visitor.  She was in excellent spirits; people had been very civil to her both at Colonel Morley's and M. Louvier's.  The American Minister had praised the scarlet jacket.  She was convinced she had made a sensation two nights running.  When the _amour propre_ is pleased, the tongue is freed.  The Venosta ran on in praise of Paris and the Parisians; of Louvier and his soiree and the pistachio ice; of the Americans, and a certain _creme de maraschino_ which she hoped the Signor Inglese had not failed to taste,--the _creme de maraschino_ led her thoughts back to Italy.  Then she grew mournful.  How she missed the native _beau ciel_!  Paris was pleasant, but how absurd to call it \"le Paradis des Femmes,\"--as if les Femmes could find Paradise in a _brouillard_!  \"But,\" she exclaimed, with vivacity of voice and gesticulation, \"the Signor does not come to hear the parrot talk; he is engaged to come that he may hear the nightingale sing.  A drop of honey attracts the fly more than a bottle of vinegar.\"  Graham could not help smiling at this adage.  \"I submit,\" said he, \"to your comparison as regards myself; but certainly anything less like a bottle of vinegar than your amiable conversation I cannot well conceive. However, the metaphor apart, I scarcely know how I dare ask Mademoiselle to sing after the confession I made to her last night.\"  \"What confession?\" asked the Venosta.  \"That I know nothing of music and doubt if I can honestly say that I am fond of it.\"  \"Not fond of music!  Impossible!  You slander yourself.  He who loves not music would have a dull time of it in heaven.  But you are English, and perhaps have only heard the music of your own country.  Bad, very bad--a heretic's music!  Now listen.\"  Seating herself at the piano, she began an air from the \"Lucia,\" crying out to Isaura to come and sing to her accompaniment.  \"Do you really wish it?\" asked Isaura of Graham, fixing on him questioning, timid eyes.  \"I cannot say how much I wish to hear you.\"  Isaura moved to the instrument, and Graham stood behind her.  Perhaps he felt that he should judge more impartially of her voice if not subjected to the charm of her face.  But the first note of the voice held him spell-bound.  In itself the organ was of the rarest order, mellow and rich, but so soft that its power was lost in its sweetness, and so exquisitely fresh in every note.  But the singer's charm was less in voice than in feeling; she conveyed to the listener so much more than was said by the words, or even implied by the music.  Her song in this caught the art of the painter who impresses the mind with the consciousness of a something which the eye cannot detect on the canvas.  She seemed to breathe out from the depths of her heart the intense pathos of the original romance, so far exceeding that of the opera,-the human tenderness, the mystic terror of a tragic love-tale more solemn in its sweetness than that of Verona.  When her voice died away no applause came,--not even a murmur.  Isaura bashfully turned round to steal a glance at her silent listener, and beheld moistened eyes and quivering lips.  At that moment she was reconciled to her art.  Graham rose abruptly and walked to the window.  \"Do you doubt now if you are fond of music?\" cried the Venosta.  \"This is more than music,\" answered Graham, still with averted face. Then, after a short pause, he approached Isaura, and said, with a melancholy half-smile,--  \"I do not think, Mademoiselle, that I could dare to hear you often; it would take me too far from the hard real world: and he who would not be left behindhand on the road that he must journey cannot indulge frequent excursions into fairyland.\"  \"Yet,\" said Isaura, in a tone yet sadder, \"I was told in my childhood, by one whose genius gives authority to her words, that beside the real world lies the ideal.  The real world then seemed rough to me.  'Escape,' said my counsellor, 'is granted from that stony thoroughfare into the fields beyond its formal hedgerows.  The ideal world has its sorrows, but it never admits despair.'  That counsel then, methought, decided my choice of life.  I know not now if it has done so.\"  \"Fate,\" answered Graham, slowly and thoughtfully, \"Fate, which is not the ruler but the servant of Providence, decides our choice of life, and rarely from outward circumstances.  Usually the motive power is within. We apply the word 'genius' to the minds of the gifted few; but in all of us there is a genius that is inborn, a pervading something which distinguishes our very identity, and dictates to the conscience that which we are best fitted to do and to be.  In so dictating it compels our choice of life; or if we resist the dictate, we find at the close that we have gone astray.  My choice of life thus compelled is on the stony thoroughfares, yours in the green fields.\"  As he thus said, his face became clouded and mournful.  The Venosta, quickly tired of a conversation in which she had no part, and having various little household matters to attend to, had during this dialogue slipped unobserved from the room; yet neither Isaura nor Graham felt the sudden consciousness that they were alone which belongs to lovers. \"Why,\" asked Isaura, with that magic smile reflected in countless dimples which, even when her words were those of a man's reasoning, made them seem gentle with a woman's sentiment,--\"why must your road through the world be so exclusively the stony one?  It is not from necessity, it can. not be from taste; and whatever definition you give to genius, surely it is not your own inborn genius that dictates to you a constant exclusive adherence to the commonplace of life.\"  \"Ah, Mademoiselle, do not misrepresent me.  I did not say that I could not sometimes quit the real world for fairyland,--I said that I could not do so often.  My vocation is not that of a poet or artist.\"  \"It is that of an orator, I know,\" said Isaura, kindling; \"so they tell me, and I believe them.  But is not the orator somewhat akin to the poet? Is not oratory an art?\"  \"Let us dismiss the word orator; as applied to English public life, it is a very deceptive expression.  The Englishman who wishes to influence his countrymen by force of words spoken must mix with them in their beaten thoroughfares; must make himself master of their practical views and interests; must be conversant with their prosaic occupations and business; must understand how to adjust their loftiest aspirations to their material welfare; must avoid as the fault most dangerous to himself and to others that kind of eloquence which is called oratory in France, and which has helped to make the French the worst politicians in Europe. Alas!  Mademoiselle, I fear that an English statesman would appear to you a very dull orator.\"  \"I see that I spoke foolishly,--yes, you show me that the world of the statesman lies apart from that of the artist.  Yet--\"  \"Yet what?\"  \"May not the ambition of both be the same?\"  \"How so?\"  \"To refine the rude, to exalt the mean; to identify their own fame with some new beauty, some new glory, added to the treasure-house of all.\"  Graham bowed his head reverently, and then raised it with the flush of enthusiasm on his cheek and brow.  \"Oh, Mademoiselle,\" he exclaimed, \"what a sure guide and what a noble inspirer to a true Englishman's ambition nature has fitted you to be, were it not--\"  He paused abruptly.  This outburst took Isaura utterly by surprise.  She had been accustomed to the language of compliment till it had begun to pall, but a compliment of this kind was the first that had ever reached her ear.  She had no words in answer to it; involuntarily she placed her hand on her heart as if to still its beatings.  But the unfinished exclamation, \"Were it not,\" troubled her more than the preceding words had flattered, and mechanically she murmured, \"Were it not--what?\"  \"Oh,\" answered Graham, affecting a tone of gayety, \"I felt too ashamed of my selfishness as man to finish my sentence.\"  \"Do so, or I shall fancy you refrained lest you might wound me as woman.\"  \"Not so; on the contrary, had I gone on it would have been to say that a woman of your genius, and more especially of such mastery in the most popular and fascinating of all arts, could not be contented if she inspired nobler thoughts in a single breast,--she must belong to the public, or rather the public must belong to her; it is but a corner of her heart that an individual can occupy, and even that individual must merge his existence in hers, must be contented to reflect a ray of the light she sheds on admiring thousands.  Who could dare to say to you, 'Renounce your career; confine your genius, your art, to the petty circle of home'?  To an actress, a singer, with whose fame the world rings, home would be a prison.  Pardon me, pardon--\"  Isaura had turned away her face to hide tears that would force their way; but she held out her hand to him with a childlike frankness, and said softly, \"I am not offended.\"  Graham did not trust himself to continue the same strain of conversation.  Breaking into a new subject, he said, after a constrained pause, \"Will you think it very impertinent in so new an acquaintance, if I ask how it is that you, an Italian, know our language as a native; and is it by Italian teachers that you have been trained to think and to feel?\"  \"Mr. Selby, my second father, was an Englishman, and did not speak any other language with comfort to himself.  He was very fond of me; and had he been really my father I could not have loved him more.  We were constant companions till--till I lost him.\"  \"And no mother left to console you!\"  Isaura shook her head mournfully, and the Venosta here re-entered. Graham felt conscious that he had already stayed too long, and took leave.  They knew that they were to meet that evening at the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7739"],["title","The Parisians â€” Volume 03 (#2)"],["body","avarins'.  To Graham that thought was not one of unmixed pleasure; the more he knew of Isaura, the more he felt self-reproach that he had allowed himself to know her at all.  But after he had left, Isaura sang low to herself the song which had so affected her listener; then she fell into abstracted revery, but she felt a strange and new sort of happiness.  In dressing for M. Savarin's dinner, and twining the classic ivy wreath in her dark locks, her Italian servant exclaimed, \"How beautiful the Signorina looks to-night!\"     CHAPTER III.  M. Savarin was one of the most brilliant of that galaxy of literary men which shed lustre on the reign of Louis Philippe.  His was an intellect peculiarly French in its lightness and grace. Neither England nor Germany nor America has produced any resemblance to it.  Ireland has, in Thomas Moore; but then in Irish genius there is so much that is French.  M. Savarin was free from the ostentatious extravagance which had come into vogue with the Empire.  His house and establishment were modestly maintained within the limit of an income chiefly, perhaps entirely, derived from literary profits.  Though he gave frequent dinners, it was but to few at a time, and without show or pretence.  Yet the dinners, though simple, were perfect of their kind; and the host so contrived to infuse his own playful gayety into the temper of his guests, that the feasts at his house were considered the pleasantest at Paris.  On this occasion the party extended to ten, the largest number his table admitted.  All the French guests belonged to the Liberal party, though in changing tints of the tricolor. _Place aux dames_!  first to be named were the Countess de Craon and Madame Vertot, both without husbands.  The Countess had buried the Count, Madame Vertot had separated from Monsieur.  The Countess was very handsome, but she was sixty; Madame Vertot was twenty years younger, but she was very plain.  She had quarrelled with the distinguished author for whose sake she had separated from Monsieur, and no man had since presumed to think that he could console a lady so plain for the loss of an author so distinguished.  Both these ladies were very clever.  The Countess had written lyrical poems entitled \"Cries of Liberty,\" and a drama of which Danton was the hero, and the moral too revolutionary for admission to the stage; but at heart the Countess was not at all a revolutionist,--the last person in the world to do or desire anything that could bring a washerwoman an inch nearer to a countess.  She was one of those persons who play with fire in order to appear enlightened.  Madame Vertot was of severer mould.  She had knelt at the feet of M. Thiers, and went into the historico-political line.  She had written a remarkable book upon the modern Carthage (meaning England), and more recently a work that had excited much attention upon the Balance of Power, in which she proved it to be the interest of civilization and the necessity of Europe that Belgium should be added to France, and Prussia circumscribed to the bounds of its original margraviate.  She showed how easily these two objects could have been effected by a constitutional monarch instead of an egotistical Emperor.  Madame Vertot was a decided Orleanist.  Both these ladies condescended to put aside authorship in general society.  Next amongst our guests let me place the Count de Passy and _Madame son espouse_.  The Count was seventy-one, and, it is needless to add, a type of Frenchman rapidly vanishing, and not likely to find itself renewed.  How shall I describe him so as to make my English reader understand?  Let me try by analogy.  Suppose a man of great birth and fortune, who in his youth had been an enthusiastic friend of Lord Byron and a jocund companion of George IV.; who had in him an immense degree of lofty romantic sentiment with an equal degree of well-bred worldly cynicism, but who, on account of that admixture, which is so rare, kept a high rank in either of the two societies into which, speaking broadly, civilized life divides itself,--the romantic and the cynical.  The Count de Passy had been the most ardent among the young disciples of Chateaubriand, the most brilliant among the young courtiers of Charles X. Need I add that he had been a terrible lady-killer?  But in spite of his admiration of Chateaubriand and his allegiance to Charles X., the Count had been always true to those caprices of the French noblesse from which he descended,--caprices which destroyed them in the old Revolution; caprices belonging to the splendid ignorance of their nation in general and their order in particular.  Speaking without regard to partial exceptions, the French _gentilhomme_ is essentially a Parisian; a Parisian is essentially impressionable to the impulse or fashion of the moment. Is it _a la mode_ for the moment to be Liberal or anti-Liberal?  Parisians embrace and kiss each other, and swear through life and death to adhere forever to the mode of the moment.  The Three Days were the mode of the moment,--the Count de Passy became an enthusiastic Orleanist.  Louis Philippe was very gracious to him.  He was decorated; he was named _prefet_ of his department; he was created senator; he was about to be sent Minister to a German Court when Louis Philippe fell.  The Republic was proclaimed.  The Count caught the popular contagion, and after exchanging tears and kisses with patriots whom a week before he had called _canaille_, he swore eternal fidelity to the Republic.  The fashion of the moment suddenly became Napoleonic, and with the _coup d'etat_ the Republic was metamorphosed into an Empire. The Count wept on the bosoms of all the _Vieilles Moustaches_ he could find, and rejoiced that the sun of Austerlitz had re-arisen.  But after the affair of Mexico the sun of Austerlitz waxed very sickly. Imperialism was fast going out of fashion.  The Count transferred his affection to Jules Favre, and joined the ranks of the advanced Liberals. During all these political changes, the Count had remained very much the same man in private life; agreeable, good-natured, witty, and, above all, a devotee of the fair sex.  When he had reached the age of sixty-eight he was still _fort bel homme_, unmarried, with a grand presence and charming manner.  At that age he said, \"Je me range,\" and married a young lady of eighteen.  She adored her husband, and was wildly jealous of him; while the Count did not seem at all jealous of her, and submitted to her adoration with a gentle shrug of the shoulders.  The three other guests who, with Graham and the two Italian ladies, made up the complement of ten, were the German Count von Rudesheim, a celebrated French physician named Bacourt, and a young author whom Savarin had admitted into his clique and declared to be of rare promise. This author, whose real name was Gustave Rameau, but who, to prove, I suppose, the sincerity of that scorn for ancestry which he professed, published his verses under the patrician designation of Alphonse de Valcour, was about twenty-four, and might have passed at the first glance for younger; but, looking at him closely, the signs of old age were already stamped on his visage.  He was undersized, and of a feeble slender frame.  In the eyes of women and artists the defects of his frame were redeemed by the extraordinary beauty of the face.  His black hair, carefully parted in the centre, and worn long and flowing, contrasted the whiteness of a high though narrow forehead, and the delicate pallor of his cheeks.  His feature, were very regular, his eyes singularly bright; but the expression of the face spoke of fatigue and exhaustion; the silky locks were already thin, and interspersed with threads of silver; the bright eyes shone out from sunken orbits; the lines round the mouth were marked as they are in the middle age of one who has lived too fast.  It was a countenance that might have excited a compassionate and tender interest but for something arrogant and supercilious in the expression,- something that demanded not tender pity but enthusiastic admiration.  Yet that expression was displeasing rather to men than to women; and one could well conceive that, among the latter, the enthusiastic admiration it challenged would be largely conceded.  The conversation at dinner was in complete contrast to that at the Americans' the day before.  There the talk, though animated, had been chiefly earnest and serious; here it was all touch and go, sally and repartee.  The subjects were the light on lots and lively anecdotes of the day, not free from literature and politics, but both treated as matters of persiflage, hovered round with a jest and quitted with an epigram.  The two French lady authors, the Count de Passy, the physician, and the host far outspoke all the other guests.  Now and then, however, the German Count struck in with an ironical remark condensing a great deal of grave wisdom, and the young author with ruder and more biting sarcasm.  If the sarcasm told, he showed his triumph by a low-pitched laugh; if it failed, he evinced his displeasure by a contemptuous sneer or a grim scowl.  Isaura and Graham were not seated near each other, and were for the most part contented to be listeners.  On adjourning to the salon after dinner, Graham, however, was approaching the chair in which Isaura had placed herself, when the young author, forestalling him, dropped into the seat next to her, and began a conversation in a voice so low that it might have passed for a whisper. The Englishman drew back and observed them.  He soon perceived, with a pang of jealousy not unmingled with scorn, that the author's talk appeared to interest Isaura.  She listened with evident attention; and when she spoke in return, though Graham did not hear her words, he could observe on her expressive countenance an increased gentleness of aspect.  \"I hope,\" said the physician, joining Graham, as most of the other guests gathered round"]]]
