Please to follow me!\"  This said, the gentleman slowly preceded the visitor, now and then stopping to exchange a friendly word with the various parties he passed in his progress; for the urbanity which Warwick possessed himself, his policy inculcated as a duty on all who served him.  A small door at the other extremity of the hall admitted into an anteroom, in which some half score pages, the sons of knights and barons, were gathered round an old warrior, placed at their head as a sort of tutor, to instruct them in all knightly accomplishments; and beckoning forth one of these youths from the ring, the earl's chamberlain said, with a profound reverence, \"Will you be pleased, my young lord, to conduct your cousin, Master Marmaduke Nevile, to the earl's presence?\"  The young gentleman eyed Marmaduke with a supercilious glance.  \"Marry!\" said he, pertly, \"if a man born in the North were to feed all his cousins, he would soon have a tail as long as my uncle, the stout earl's.  Come, sir cousin, this way.\"  And without tarrying even to give Nevile information of the name and quality of his new-found relation,--who was no less than Lord Montagu's son, the sole male heir to the honours of that mighty family, though now learning the apprenticeship of chivalry amongst his uncle's pages,--the boy passed before Marmaduke with a saunter, that, had they been in plain Westmoreland, might have cost him a cuff from the stout hand of the indignant elder cousin.  He raised the tapestry at one end of the room, and ascending a short flight of broad stairs, knocked gently on the panels of an arched door sunk deep in the walls.  \"Enter!\" said a clear, loud voice, and the next moment Marmaduke was in the presence of the King-maker.  He heard his guide pronounce his name, and saw him smile maliciously at the momentary embarrassment the young man displayed, as the boy passed by Marmaduke, and vanished.  The Earl of Warwick was seated near a door that opened upon an inner court, or rather garden, which gave communication to the river.  The chamber was painted in the style of Henry III., with huge figures representing the battle of Hastings, or rather, for there were many separate pieces, the conquest of Saxon England.  Over each head, to enlighten the ignorant, the artist had taken the precaution to insert a label, which told the name and the subject.  The ceiling was groined, vaulted, and emblazoned with the richest gilding and colours.  The chimneypiece (a modern ornament) rose to the roof, and represented in bold reliefs, gilt and decorated, the signing of Magna Charta.  The floor was strewed thick with dried rushes and odorous herbs; the furniture was scanty, but rich.  The low-backed chairs, of which there were but four, carved in ebony, had cushions of velvet with fringes of massive gold; a small cupboard, or beaufet, covered with carpetz de cuir (carpets of gilt and painted leather), of great price, held various quaint and curious ornaments of plate inwrought with precious stones; and beside this--a singular contrast--on a plain Gothic table lay the helmet, the gauntlets, and the battle-axe of the master.  Warwick himself, seated before a large, cumbrous desk, was writing,--but slowly and with pain,--and he lifted his finger as the Nevile approached, in token of his wish to conclude a task probably little congenial to his tastes.  But Marmaduke was grateful for the moments afforded him to recover his self-possession, and to examine his kinsman.  The earl was in the lusty vigour of his age.  His hair, of the deepest black, was worn short, as if in disdain of the effeminate fashions of the day; and fretted bare from the temples by the constant and early friction of his helmet, gave to a forehead naturally lofty yet more majestic appearance of expanse and height.  His complexion, though dark and sunburned, glowed with rich health.  The beard was closely shaven, and left in all its remarkable beauty the contour of the oval face and strong jaw,--strong as if clasped in iron.  The features were marked and aquiline, as was common to those of Norman blood.  The form spare, but of prodigious width and depth of chest, the more apparent from the fashion of the short surcoat, which was thrown back, and left in broad expanse a placard, not of holiday velvet and satins, but of steel polished as a mirror, and inlaid with gold.  And now as, concluding his task, the earl rose and motioned Marmaduke to a stool by his side, his great stature, which, from the length of his limbs, was not so observable when he sat, actually startled his guest. Tall as Marmaduke was himself, the earl towered [The faded portrait of Richard Nevile, Earl of Warwick, in the Rous Roll, preserved at the Herald's College, does justice, at least, to the height and majesty of his stature.  The portrait of Edward IV. is the only one in that long series which at all rivals the stately proportions of the King-maker.] above him,--with his high, majestic, smooth, unwrinkled forehead,-- like some Paladin of the rhyme of poet or romancer; and, perhaps, not only in this masculine advantage, but in the rare and harmonious combination of colossal strength with graceful lightness, a more splendid union of all the outward qualities we are inclined to give to the heroes of old never dazzled the eye or impressed the fancy.  But even this effect of mere person was subordinate to that which this eminent nobleman created--upon his inferiors, at least--by a manner so void of all arrogance, yet of all condescension, so simple, open, cordial, and hero-like, that Marmaduke Nevile, peculiarly alive to external impressions, and subdued and fascinated by the earl's first word, and that word was \"Welcome!\" dropped on his knee, and kissing the hand extended to him, said, \"Noble kinsman, in thy service and for thy sake let me live and die!\"  Had the young man been prepared by the subtlest master of courtcraft for this interview, so important to his fortunes, he could not have advanced a hundredth part so far with the great earl as he did by that sudden, frank burst of genuine emotion; for Warwick was extremely sensitive to the admiration he excited,-- vain or proud of it, it matters not which; grateful as a child for love, and inexorable as a woman for slight or insult: in rude ages, one sex has often the qualities of the other.  \"Thou hast thy father's warm heart and hasty thought, Marmaduke,\" said Warwick, raising him; \"and now he is gone where, we trust, brave men, shrived of their sins, look down upon us, who should be thy friend but Richard Nevile?  So--so--yes, let me look at thee.  Ha! stout Guy's honest face, every line of it: but to the girls, perhaps, comelier, for wanting a scar or two.  Never blush,--thou shalt win the scars yet.  So thou hast a letter from thy father?\"  \"It is here, noble lord.\"  \"And why,\" said the earl, cutting the silk with his dagger--\"why hast thou so long hung back from presenting it?  But I need not ask thee. These uncivil times have made kith and kin doubt worse of each other than thy delay did of me.  Sir Guy's mark, sure eno'!  Brave old man! I loved him the better for that, like me, the sword was more meet than the pen for his bold hand.\"  Here Warwick scanned, with some slowness, the lines dictated by the dead to the priest; and when he had done, he laid the letter respectfully on his desk, and bowing his head over it, muttered to himself,--it might be an Ave for the deceased.  \"Well,\" he said, reseating himself, and again motioning Marmaduke to follow his example, \"thy father was, in sooth, to blame for the side he took in the Wars.  What son of the Norman could bow knee or vail plume to that shadow of a king, Henry of Windsor?  And for his bloody wife--she knew no more of an Englishman's pith and pride than I know of the rhymes and roundels of old Rene, her father.  Guy Nevile--good Guy--many a day in my boyhood did he teach me how to bear my lance at the crest, and direct my sword at the mail joints.  He was cunning at fence--thy worshipful father--but I was ever a bad scholar; and my dull arm, to this day, hopes more from its strength than its craft.\"  \"I have heard it said, noble earl, that the stoutest hand can scarcely lift your battle-axe.\"  \"Fables! romaunt!\"  answered the earl, smiling; \"there it lies,--go and lift it.\"  Marmaduke went to the table, and, though with some difficulty, raised and swung this formidable weapon.  \"By my halidame, well swung, cousin mine!  Its use depends not on the strength, but the practice.  Why, look you now, there is the boy Richard of Gloucester, who comes not up to thy shoulder, and by dint of custom each day can wield mace or axe with as much ease as a jester doth his lathesword.  Ah, trust me, Marmaduke, the York House is a princely one; and if we must have a king, we barons, by stout Saint George, let no meaner race ever furnish our lieges.  But to thyself, Marmaduke--what are thy views and thy wishes?\"  \"To be one of thy following, noble Warwick.\"  \"I thank and accept thee, young Nevile; but thou hast heard that I am about to leave England, and in the mean time thy youth would run danger without a guide.\"  The earl paused a moment, and resumed: \"My brother of Montagu showed thee cold countenance; but a word from me will win thee his grace and favour.  What sayest thou, wilt thou be one of his gentlemen?  If so, I will tell thee the qualities a man must have,--a discreet tongue, a quick eye, the last fashion in hood and shoe-bobbins, a perfect seat on thy horse, a light touch for the gittern, a voice for a love-song, and--\"  \"I have none of these save the horsemanship, gracious my lord; and if thou wilt not receive me thyself, I will not burden my Lord of Montagu and Northumberland.\"  \"Hot and quick!  No!  John of Montagu would not suit thee, nor thou "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7716"],["title","The Last of the Barons â€” Volume 02 (#2)"],["body","him.  But how to provide for thee till my return I know not.\"  \"Dare I not hope, then, to make one of your embassage, noble earl?\"  Warwick bent his brows, and looked at him in surprise.  \"Of our embassage!  Why, thou art haughty, indeed!  Nay, and so a soldier's son and a Nevile should be!  I blame thee not; but I could not make thee one of my train, without creating a hundred enemies--to me (but that's nothing) and to thee, which were much.  Knowest thou not that there is scarce a gentleman of my train below the state of a peer's son, and that I have made, by refusals, malcontents eno', as it is?-- Yet, bold! there is my learned brother, the Archbishop of York. Knowest thou Latin and the schools?\"  \"'Fore Heaven, my lord,\" said the Nevile, bluntly, \"I see already I had best go back to green Westmoreland, for I am as unfit for his grace the archbishop as I am for my Lord Montagu.\"  \"Well, then,\" said the earl, dryly, \"since thou hast not yet station enough for my train, nor glosing for Northumberland, nor wit and lere for the archbishop, I suppose, my poor youth, I must e'en make you only a gentleman about the king!  It is not a post so sure of quick rising and full gipsires as one about myself or my brethren, but it will be less envied, and is good for thy first essay.  How goes the clock?  Oh, here is Nick Alwyn's new horologe.  He tells me that the English will soon rival the Dutch in these baubles.  [Clockwork appears to have been introduced into England in the reign of Edward III., when three Dutch horologers were invited over from Delft.  They must soon have passed into common use, for Chaucer thus familiarly speaks of them:--\"Full sickerer was his crowing in his loge                   Than is a clock or any abbey orloge.\"] The more the pity!--our red-faced yeomen, alas, are fast sinking into lank-jawed mechanics!  We shall find the king in his garden within the next half-hour.  Thou shalt attend me.\"  Marmaduke expressed, with more feeling than eloquence, the thanks he owed for an offer that, he was about to say, exceeded his hopes; but he had already, since his departure from Westmoreland, acquired sufficient wit to think twice of his words.  And so eagerly, at that time, did the youth of the nobility contend for the honour of posts about the person of Warwick, and even of his brothers, and so strong was the belief that the earl's power to make or to mar fortune was all-paramount in England, that even a place in the king's household was considered an inferior appointment to that which made Warwick the immediate patron and protector.  This was more especially the case amongst the more haughty and ancient gentry since the favour shown by Edward to the relations of his wife, and his own indifference to the rank and birth of his associates.  Warwick had therefore spoken with truth when he expressed a comparative pity for the youth, whom he could not better provide for than by a place about the court of his sovereign!  The earl then drew from Marmaduke some account of his early training, his dependence on his brother, his adventures at the archery-ground, his misadventure with the robbers, and even his sojourn with Warner,-- though Marmaduke was discreetly silent as to the very existence of Sibyll.  The earl, in the mean while, walked to and fro the chamber with a light, careless stride, every moment pausing to laugh at the frank simplicity of his kinsman, or to throw in some shrewd remark, which he cast purposely in the rough Westmoreland dialect; for no man ever attains to the popularity that rejoiced or accursed the Earl of Warwick, without a tendency to broad and familiar humour, without a certain commonplace of character in its shallower and more every-day properties.  This charm--always great in the great--Warwick possessed to perfection; and in him--such was his native and unaffected majesty of bearing, and such the splendour that surrounded his name--it never seemed coarse or unfamiliar, but \"everything he did became him best.\" Marmaduke had just brought his narrative to a conclusion, when, after a slight tap at the door, which Warwick did not hear, two fair young forms bounded joyously in, and not seeing the stranger, threw themselves upon Warwick's breast with the caressing familiarity of infancy.  \"Ah, Father,\" said the elder of these two girls, as Warwick's hand smoothed her hair fondly, \"you promised you would take us in your barge to see the sports on the river, and now it will be too late.\"  \"Make your peace with your young cousins here,\" said the earl, turning to Marmaduke; \"you will cost them an hour's joyaunce.  This is my eldest daughter, Isabel; and this soft-eyed, pale-cheeked damozel--too loyal for a leaf of the red rose--is the Lady Anne.\"  The two girls had started from their father's arms at the first address to Marmaduke, and their countenances had relapsed from their caressing and childlike expression into all the stately demureness with which they had been brought up to regard a stranger.  Howbeit, this reserve, to which he was accustomed, awed Marmaduke less than the alternate gayety and sadness of the wilder Sibyll, and he addressed them with all the gallantry to the exercise of which he had been reared, concluding his compliments with a declaration that he would rather forego the advantage proffered him by the earl's favour with the king, than foster one obnoxious and ungracious memory in damozels so fair and honoured.  A haughty smile flitted for a moment over the proud young face of Isabel Nevile; but the softer Anne blushed, and drew bashfully behind her sister.  As yet these girls, born for the highest and fated to the most wretched fortunes, were in all the bloom of earliest youth; but the difference between their characters might be already observable in their mien and countenance.  Isabel; of tall and commanding stature, had some resemblance to her father, in her aquiline features, rich, dark hair, and the lustrous brilliancy of her eyes; while Anne, less striking, yet not less lovely, of smaller size and slighter proportions, bore in her pale, clear face, her dove-like eyes, and her gentle brow an expression of yielding meekness not unmixed with melancholy, which, conjoined with an exquisite symmetry of features, could not fail of exciting interest where her sister commanded admiration.  Not a word, however, from either did Marmaduke abstract in return for his courtesies, nor did either he or the earl seem to expect it; for the latter, seating himself and drawing Anne on his knee, while Isabella walked with stately grace towards the table that bore her father's warlike accoutrements, and played, as it were, unconsciously with the black plume on his black burgonet, said to Nevile,  \"Well, thou hast seen enough of the Lancastrian raptrils to make thee true to the Yorkists.  I would I could say as much for the king himself, who is already crowding the court with that venomous faction, in honour of Dame Elizabeth Gray, born Mistress Woodville, and now Queen of England.  Ha, my proud Isabel, thou wouldst have better filled the throne that thy father built!\"  And at these words a proud flash broke from the earl's dark eyes, betraying even to Marmaduke the secret of perhaps his earliest alienation from Edward IV.  Isabella pouted her rich lip, but said nothing.  \"As for thee, Anne,\" continued the earl, \"it is a pity that monks cannot marry,--thou wouldst have suited some sober priest better than a mailed knight. 'Fore George, I would not ask thee to buckle my baldrick when the war- steeds were snorting, but I would trust Isabel with the links of my hauberk.\"  \"Nay, Father,\" said the low, timid voice of Anne, \"if thou wert going to danger, I could be brave in all that could guard thee!\"  \"Why, that's my girl! kiss me!  Thou hast a look of thy mother now,-- so thou hast! and I will not chide thee the next time I hear thee muttering soft treason in pity of Henry of Windsor.\"  \"Is he not to be pitied?--Crown, wife, son, and Earl Warwick's stout arm lost--lost!\"  \"No!\" said Isabel, suddenly; no, sweet sister Anne, and fie on thee for the words!  He lost all, because he had neither the hand of a knight nor the heart of a man!  For the rest--Margaret of Anjou, or her butchers, beheaded our father's father.\"  \"And may God and Saint George forget me, when I forget those gray and gory hairs!\" exclaimed the earl; and putting away the Lady Anne somewhat roughly, he made a stride across the room, and stood by his hearth.  \"And yet Edward, the son of Richard of York, who fell by my father's side--he forgets, he forgives!  And the minions of Rivers the Lancastrian tread the heels of Richard of Warwick.\"  At this unexpected turn in the conversation, peculiarly unwelcome, as it may be supposed, to the son of one who had fought on the Lancastrian side in the very battle referred to, Marmaduke felt somewhat uneasy; and turning to the Lady Anne, he said, with the gravity of wounded pride, \"I owe more to my lord, your father, than I even wist of,--how much he must have overlooked to--\"  \"Not so!\" interrupted Warwick, who overheard him,--\"not so; thou wrongest me!  Thy father was shocked at those butcheries; thy father recoiled from that accursed standard; thy father was of a stock ancient and noble as my own!  But, these Woodvilles!--tush! my passion overmasters me.  We will go to the king,--it is time.\"  Warwick here rang the hand-bell on his table, and on the entrance of his attendant gentleman, bade him see that the barge was in readiness; then beckoning to his kinsman, and with a nod to his daughters, he caught up his plumed cap, and passed at once into the garden.  \"Anne,\" said Isabel, when the two girls were alone, \"thou hast vexed my father, and what marvel?  If the Lancastrians can be pitied, the Earl of Warwick must be condemned!\"  \"Unkind!\" said Anne, shedding tears; \"I can pity woe and mischance, without blaming those whose hard duty it might be to achieve them.\"  \"In good sooth"]]]
