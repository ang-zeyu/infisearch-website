Happy the man who hath never known what it is to taste of fame,--to have it is a purgatory, to want it is a hell!\"  Rapt in this gloomy self-commune, he heard not the light step that sought his side, till a tender arm was thrown around him, and a face in which sweet temper and pure thought had preserved to matronly beauty all the bloom of youth, looked up smilingly to his own.  \"My lord, my Richard,\" said the countess, \"why didst thou steal so churlishly from me?  Hath there, alas! come a time when thou deemest me unworthy to share thy thoughts, or soothe thy troubles?\"  \"Fond one! no,\" said Warwick, drawing the form still light, though rounded, nearer to his bosom.  \"For nineteen years hast thou been to me a leal and loving wife.  Thou wert a child on our wedding-day, m'amie, and I but a beardless youth; yet wise enough was I then to see, at the first glance of thy blue eye, that there was more treasure in thy heart than in all the lordships thy hand bestowed.\"  \"My Richard!\" murmured the countess, and her tears of grateful delight fell on the hand she kissed.  \"Yes, let us recall those early and sweet days,\" continued Warwick, with a tenderness of voice and manner that strangers might have marvelled at, forgetting how tenderness is almost ever a part of such peculiar manliness of character; \"yes, sit we here under this spacious elm, and think that our youth has come back to us once more.  For verily, m'amie, nothing in life has ever been so fair to me as those days when we stood hand in hand on its threshold, and talked, boy- bridegroom and child-bride as we were, of the morrow that lay beyond.\"  \"Ah, Richard, even in those days thy ambition sometimes vexed my woman's vanity, and showed me that I could never be all in all to so large a heart!\"  \"Ambition!  No, thou mistakest,--Montagu is ambitious, I but proud. Montagu ever seeks to be higher than he is, I but assert the right to be what I am and have been; and my pride, sweet wife, is a part of my love for thee.  It is thy title, Heiress of Warwick, and not my father's, that I bear; thy badge, and not the Nevile's, which I have made the symbol of my power.  Shame, indeed, on my knighthood, if the fairest dame in England could not justify my pride!  Ah, belle amie, why have we not a son?\"  \"Peradventure, fair lord,\" said the countess, with an arch yet half- melancholy smile, \"because that pride, or ambition, name it as thou wilt, which thou excusest so gallantly, would become too insatiate and limitless if thou sawest a male heir to thy greatness; and God, perhaps, warns thee that, spread and increase as thou wilt,--yea, until half our native country becometh as the manor of one man,--all must pass from the Beauchamp and the Nevile into new Houses; thy glory indeed an eternal heirloom, but only to thy land,--thy lordships and thy wealth melting into the dowry of a daughter.\"  \"At least no king hath daughters so dowried,\" answered Warwick; \"and though I disdain for myself the hard vassalage of a throne, yet if the channel of our blood must pass into other streams, into nothing meaner than the veins of royalty should it merge.\"  He paused a moment, and added with a sigh, \"Would that Clarence were more worthy Isabel!\"  \"Nay,\" said the countess, gently, \"he loveth her as she merits.  He is comely, brave, gracious, and learned.\"  \"A pest upon that learning,--it sicklies and womanizes men's minds!\" exclaimed Warwick, bluntly.  \"Perhaps it is his learning that I am to thank for George of Clarence's fears and doubts and calculations and scruples.  His brother forbids his marriage with any English donzell, for Edward dares not specialize what alone he dreads.  His letters burn with love, and his actions freeze with doubts.  It was not thus I loved thee, sweetheart.  By all the saints in the calendar, had Henry V. or the Lion Richard started from the tomb to forbid me thy hand, it would but have made me a hotter lover!  Howbeit Clarence shall decide ere the moon wanes, and but for Isabel's tears and thy entreaties, my father's grandchild should not have waited thus long the coming of so hesitating a wooer.  But lo, our darlings!  Anne hath thine eyes, m'amie; and she groweth more into my heart every day, since daily she more favours thee.\"  While he thus spoke, the fair sisters came lightly and gayly up the terrace: the arm of the statelier Isabel was twined round Anne's slender waist; and as they came forward in that gentle link, with their lithesome and bounding step, a happier blending of contrasted beauty was never seen.  The months that had passed since the sisters were presented first to the reader had little changed the superb and radiant loveliness of Isabel, but had added surprisingly to the attractions of Anne.  Her form was more rounded, her bloom more ripened; and though something of timidity and bashfulness still lingered about the grace of her movements and the glance of her dove- like eye, the more earnest thoughts of the awakening woman gave sweet intelligence to her countenance, and that divinest of all attractions --the touching and conscious modesty--to the shy but tender smile, and the blush that so came and went, so went and came, that it stirred the heart with a sort of delighted pity for one so evidently susceptible to every emotion of pleasure and of pain.  Life seemed too rough a thing for so soft a nature, and gazing on her, one sighed to guess her future.  \"And what brings ye hither, young truants?\" said the earl, as Anne, leaving her sister, clung lovingly to his side (for it was ever her habit to cling to some one), while Isabel kissed her mother's hand, and then stood before her parents, colouring deeply, and with downcast eyes.  \"What brings ye hither, whom I left so lately deep engaged in the loom, upon the helmet of Goliath, with my burgonet before you as a sample?  Wife, you are to blame,--our rooms of state will be arrasless for the next three generations, if these rosy fingers are suffered thus to play the idlers.\"  \"My father,\" whispered Anne, \"guests are on their way hither,--a noble cavalcade; you note them not from this part of the battlements, but from our turret it was fair to see how their plumes and banners shone in the setting sun.\"  \"Guests!\" echoed the earl; \"well, is that so rare an honour that your hearts should beat like village girls at a holiday?  Ah, Isabel! look at her blushes.  Is it George of Clarence at last?  Is it?\"  \"We see the Duke of Gloucester's cognizance,\" whispered Anne, \"and our own Nevile Bull.  Perchance our cousin George, also, may--\"  Here she was interrupted by the sound of the warder's horn, followed a moment after by the roar of one of the bombards on the keep.  \"At least,\" said Warwick, his face lighting up, \"that signal announces the coming of king's blood.  We must honour it,--for it is our own. We will go forth and meet our guests--your hand, countess.\"  And gravely and silently, and in deep but no longer gloomy thought, Warwick descended from the terrace, followed by the fair sisters; and who that could have looked upon that princely pair and those lovely and radiant children, could have foreseen that in that hour, Fate, in tempting the earl once more to action, was busy on their doom!     CHAPTER II.  COUNCILS AND MUSINGS.  The lamp shone through the lattice of Warwick's chamber at the unwonted hour of midnight, and the earl was still in deep commune with his guests.  The archbishop, whom Edward, alarmed by the state of the country and the disaffection of his barons, had reluctantly commissioned to mediate with Warwick, was, as we have before said, one of those men peculiar to the early Church.  There was nothing more in the title of Archbishop of York than in that of the Bishop of Osnaburg (borne by the royal son of George III.) [The late Duke of York.] to prevent him who enjoyed it from leading armies, guiding States, or indulging pleasure.  But beneath the coxcombry of George Nevile, which was what he shared most in common with the courtiers of the laity, there lurked a true ecclesiastic's mind.  He would have made in later times an admirable Jesuit, and no doubt in his own time a very brilliant Pope.  His objects in his present mission were clear and perspicuous; any breach between Warwick and the king must necessarily weaken his own position, and the power of his House was essential to all his views.  The object of Gloucester in his intercession was less defined, but not less personal: in smoothing the way to his brother's marriage with Isabel, he removed all apparent obstacle to his own with Anne.  And it is probable that Richard, who, whatever his crimes, was far from inaccessible to affection, might have really loved his early playmate, even while his ambition calculated the wealth of the baronies that would swell the dower of the heiress and gild the barren coronet of his duchy.  [Majerns, the Flemish chronicler, quoted by Bucke (\"Life of Richard III\"), mentions the early attachment of Richard to Anne.  They were much together, as children, at Middleham.]  \"God's truth!\" said Warwick, as he lifted his eyes from the scroll in the king's writing, \"ye know well, princely cousin, and thou, my brother, ye know well how dearly I have loved King Edward; and the mother's milk overflows my heart when I read these gentle and tender words which he deigns to bestow upon his servant.  My blood is hasty and over-hot, but a kind thought from those I love puts out much fire. Sith he thus beseeches me to return to his councils, I will not be sullen enough to hold back; but, oh, Prince Richard! is it indeed a matter past all consideration that your sister, the Lady Margaret, must wed with the Duke of Burgundy?\"  \"Warwick,\" replied the prince, \"thou"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7719"],["title","The Last of the Barons â€” Volume 05 (#2)"],["body"," mayest know that I never looked with favour on that alliance; that when Clarence bore the Bastard's helmet, I withheld my countenance from the Bastard's presence.  I incurred Edward's anger by refusing to attend his court while the Count de la Roche was his guest. And therefore you may trust me when I say now that Edward, after promises, however rash, most solemn and binding, is dishonoured forever if he break off the contract.  New circumstances, too, have arisen, to make what were dishonour danger also.  By the death of his father, Charolois has succeeded to the Duke of Burgundy's diadem.  Thou knowest his warlike temper; and though in a contest popular in England we need fear no foe, yet thou knowest also that no subsidies could be raised for strife with our most profitable commercial ally.  Wherefore we earnestly implore thee magnanimously to forgive the past, accept Edward's assurance of repentance, and be thy thought--as it has been ever--the weal of our common country.\"  \"I may add, also,\" said the archbishop, observing how much Warwick was touched and softened,--\"that in returning to the helm of state, our gracious king permits me to say, that, save only in the alliance with Burgundy, which toucheth his plighted word, you have full liberty to name conditions, and to ask whatever grace or power a monarch can bestow.\"  \"I name none but my prince's confidence,\" said Warwick, generously; \"in that, all else is given, and in return for that, I will make the greatest sacrifice that my nature knoweth, or can conceive,--I will mortify my familiar demon, I will subdue my PRIDE.  If Edward can convince me that it is for the good of England that his sister should wed with mine ancient and bitter foe, I will myself do honour to his choice.  But of this hereafter.  Enough now that I forget past wrongs in present favour; and that for peace or war, I return to the side of that man whom I loved as my son before I served him as my king.\"  Neither Richard nor the archbishop was prepared for a conciliation so facile, for neither quite understood that peculiar magnanimity which often belongs to a vehement and hasty temper, and which is as eager to forgive as prompt to take offence,--which, ever in extremes, is not contented with anything short of fiery aggression or trustful generosity, and where it once passes over an offence, seeks to oblige the offender.  So, when, after some further conversation on the state of the country, the earl lighted Gloucester to his chamber, the young prince said to himself, musingly,--  \"Does ambition besot and blind men?  Or can Warwick think that Edward can ever view him but as one to be destroyed when the hour is ripe?\"  Catesby, who was the duke's chamberlain, was in attendance as the prince unrobed.  \"A noble castle this,\" said the duke, \"and one in the midst of a warlike population,--our own countrymen of York.\"  \"It would be no mean addition to the dowry of the Lady Isabel,\" said Catesby, with his bland, false smile.  \"Methinks rather that the lordships of Salisbury (and this is the chief) pass to the Lady Anne,\" said Richard, musingly.  \"No, Edward were imprudent to suffer this stronghold to fall to the next heir to his throne.  Marked you the Lady Anne?--her beauty is most excellent.\"  \"Truly, your Highness,\" answered Catesby, unsuspiciously, \"the Lady Isabel seems to me the taller and the statelier.\"  \"When man's merit and woman's beauty are measured by the ell, Catesby, Anne will certainly be less fair than Isabel, and Richard a dolt compared to Clarence.  Open the casement; my dressing-robe; good-night to you!\"     CHAPTER III.  THE SISTERS.  The next morning, at an hour when modern beauty falls into its first sickly sleep, Isabel and Anne conversed on the same terrace, and near the same spot, which had witnessed their father's meditations the day before.  They were seated on a rude bench in an angle of the wall, flanked by a low, heavy bastion.  And from the parapet their gaze might have wandered over a goodly sight, for on a broad space, covered with sand and sawdust, within the vast limits of the castle range, the numerous knights and youths who sought apprenticeship in arms and gallantry under the earl were engaged in those martial sports which, falling elsewhere in disuse, the Last of the Barons kinglily maintained.  There, boys of fourteen, on their small horses, ran against each other with blunted lances.  There, those of more advanced adolescence, each following the other in a circle, rode at the ring; sometimes (at the word of command from an old knight who had fought at Agincourt, and was the preceptor in these valiant studies) leaping from their horses at full speed, and again vaulting into the saddle. A few grim old warriors sat by to censure or applaud.  Most skilled among the younger was the son of Lord Montagu; among the maturer, the name of Marmaduke Nevile was the most often shouted.  If the eye turned to the left, through the barbican might be seen flocks of beeves entering to supply the mighty larder; and at a smaller postern, a dark crowd of mendicant friars, and the more destitute poor, waited for the daily crumbs from the rich man's table.  What need of a poor- law then?  The baron and the abbot made the parish!  But not on these evidences of wealth and state turned the eyes, so familiar to them, that they woke no vanity, and roused no pride.  With downcast looks and a pouting lip, Isabel listened to the silver voice of Anne.  \"Dear sister, be just to Clarence.  He cannot openly defy his king and brother.  Believe that he would have accompanied our uncle and cousin had he not deemed that their meditation would be more welcome, at least to King Edward, without his presence.\"  \"But not a letter! not a line!\"  \"Yet when I think of it, Isabel, are we sure that he even knew of the visit of the archbishop and his brother?\"  \"How could he fail to know?\"  \"The Duke of Gloucester last evening told me that the king had sent him southward.\"  \"Was it about Clarence that the duke whispered to thee so softly by the oriel window?\"  \"Surely, yes,\" said Anne, simply.  \"Was not Richard as a brother to us when we played as children on yon greensward?\"  \"Never as a brother to me,--never was Richard of Gloucester one whom I could think of without fear and even loathing,\" answered Isabel, quickly.  It was at this turn in the conversation that the noiseless step of Richard himself neared the spot, and hearing his own name thus discourteously treated, he paused, screened from their eyes by the bastion in the angle.  \"Nay, nay, sister,\" said Anne; \"what is there in Richard that misbeseems his princely birth?\"  \"I know not, but there is no youth in his eye and in his heart.  Even as a child he had the hard will and the cold craft of gray hairs. Pray Saint Mary you give me not Gloucester for a brother!\"  Anne sighed and smiled.  \"Ah, no,\" she said, after a short pause, \"when thou art Princess of Clarence may I--\"  \"May thou what?\"  \"Pray for thee and thine in the house of God!  Ah, thou knowest not, sweet Isabel, how often at morn and even mine eyes and heart turn to the spires of yonder convent!\"  She rose as she said this, her lip quivered, and she moved on in the opposite direction to that in which Richard stood, still unseen, and no longer within his hearing.  Isabel rose also, and hastening after her, threw her arms round Anne's neck, and kissed away the tears that stood in those meek eyes.  \"My sister, my Anne!  Ah, trust in me, thou hast some secret, I know it well,--I have long seen it.  Is it possible that thou canst have placed thy heart, thy pure love--Thou blushest!  Ah, Anne!  Anne! thou canst not have loved beneath thee?\"  \"Nay,\" said Anne, with a spark of her ancestral fire lighting her meek eyes through its tears, \"not beneath me, but above.  What do I say! Isabel, ask me no more.  Enough that it is a folly, a dream, and that I could smile with pity at myself to think from what light causes love and grief can spring.\"  \"Above thee!\" repeated Isabel, in amaze; \"and who in England is above the daughter of Earl Warwick?  Not Richard of Gloucester?  If so, pardon my foolish tongue.\"  \"No, not Richard,--though I feel kindly towards him, and his sweet voice soothes me when I listen,--not Richard.  Ask no more.\"  \"Oh, Anne, speak, speak!--we are not both so wretched?  Thou lovest not Clarence?  It is--it must be!\"  \"Canst thou think me so false and treacherous,--a heart pledged to thee?  Clarence!  Oh, no!\"  \"But who then--who then?\" said Isabel, still suspiciously.  \"Nay, if thou wilt not speak, blame thyself if I must still wrong thee.\"  Thus appealed to, and wounded to the quick by Isabel's tone and eye, Anne at last with a strong effort suppressed her tears, and, taking her sister's hand, said in a voice of touching solemnity, \"Promise, then, that the secret shall be ever holy; and, since I know that it will move thine anger--perhaps thy scorn--strive to forget what I will confess to thee.\"  Isabel for answer pressed her lips on the hand she held; and the sisters, turning under the shadow of a long row of venerable oaks, placed themselves on a little mound, fragrant with the violets of spring.  A different part of the landscape beyond was now brought in view; calmly slept in the valley the roofs of the subject town of Middleham, calmly flowed through the pastures the noiseless waves of Ure.  Leaning on Isabel's bosom, Anne thus spake, \"Call to mind, sweet sister, that short breathing-time in the horrors of the Civil War, when a brief peace was made between our father and Queen Margaret.  We were left in the palace--mere children that we were--to play with the young prince, and the children in Margaret's train.\"  \"I remember.\"  \"And I was unwell and timid, and kept aloof from the sports with a girl of my own years, whom I think--see how faithful my memory!--they called Sibyll; and Prince Edward, Henry's son, stealing from the rest, sought me out; and we sat together, or"]]]
