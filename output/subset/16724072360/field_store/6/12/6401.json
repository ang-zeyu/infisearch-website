(#2)"],["body","for all the doubts she had known, and for the despair which of late had darkened the face of earth.  Her home lost, the deep and beautiful love of her youth blighted,--that was a creed almost irresistible which told her that grief was but for a day, that happiness was eternal.  Far, too, from revolting such of the Hebrew pride of association as she had formed, the birth of the Messiah in the land of the Israelites seemed to consummate their peculiar triumph as the Elected of Jehovah.  And while she mourned for the Jews who persecuted the Saviour, she gloried in those whose belief had carried the name and worship of the descendants of David over the furthest regions of the world.  Often she perplexed and startled the worthy Inez by exclaiming, \"This, your belief, is the same as mine, adding only the assurance of immortal life--Christianity is but the Revelation of Judaism.\"  The wise and gentle instrument of Leila's conversion did not, however, give vent to those more Catholic sentiments which might have scared away the wings of the descending dove.  She forbore too vehemently to point out the distinctions of the several creeds, and rather suffered them to melt insensibly one into the other: Leila was a Christian, while she still believed herself a Jewess.  But in the fond and lovely weakness of mortal emotions, there was one bitter thought that often and often came to mar the peace that otherwise would have settled on her soul.  That father, the sole softener of whose stern heart and mysterious fates she was, with what pangs would he receive the news of her conversion!  And Muza, that bright and hero-vision of her youth--was she not setting the last seal of separation upon all hope of union with the idol of the Moors?  But, alas! was she not already separated from him, and had not their faiths been from the first at variance?  From these thoughts she started with sighs and tears; and before her stood the crucifix already admitted into her chamber, and--not, perhaps, too wisely--banished so rigidly from the oratories of the Huguenot.  For the representation of that Divine resignation, that mortal agony, that miraculous sacrifice, what eloquence it hath for our sorrows! what preaching hath the symbol to the vanities of our wishes, to the yearnings of our discontent!  By degrees, as her new faith grew confirmed, Leila now inclined herself earnestly to those pictures of the sanctity and calm of the conventual life which Inez delighted to draw.  In the reaction of her thoughts, and her despondency of all worldly happiness, there seemed, to the young maiden, an inexpressible charm in a solitude which was to release her for ever from human love, and render her entirely up to sacred visions and imperishable hopes.  And with this selfish, there mingled a generous and sublime sentiment.  The prayers of a convert might be heard in favour of those yet benighted: and the awful curse upon her outcast race be lightened by the orisons of one humble heart.  In all ages, in all creeds, a strange and mystic impression has existed of the efficacy of self-sacrifice in working the redemption even of a whole people: this belief, so strong in the old orient and classic religions, was yet more confirmed by Christianity--a creed founded upon the grandest of historic sacrifices; and the lofty doctrine of which, rightly understood, perpetuates in the heart of every believer the duty of self-immolation, as well as faith in the power of prayer, no matter how great the object, how mean the supplicator.  On these thoughts Leila meditated, till thoughts acquired the intensity of passions, and the conversion of the Jewess was completed.     CHAPTER III.  THE HOUR AND THE MAN  It was on the third morning after the King of Granada, reconciled to his people, had reviewed his gallant army in the Vivarrambla; and Boabdil, surrounded by his chiefs and nobles, was planning a deliberate and decisive battle, by assault on the Christian camp,--when a scout suddenly arrived, breathless, at the gates of the palace, to communicate the unlooked-for and welcome intelligence that Ferdinand had in the night broken up his camp, and marched across the mountains towards Cordova.  In fact, the outbreak of formidable conspiracies had suddenly rendered the appearance of Ferdinand necessary elsewhere; and, his intrigues with Almamen frustrated, he despaired of a very speedy conquest of the city. The Spanish king resolved, therefore, after completing the devastation of the Vega, to defer the formal and prolonged siege, which could alone place Granada within his power, until his attention was no longer distracted to other foes, and until, it must be added, he had replenished an exhausted treasury.  He had formed, with Torquemada, a vast and wide scheme of persecution, not only against Jews, but against Christians whose fathers had been of that race, and who were suspected of relapsing into Judaical practices.  The two schemers of this grand design were actuated by different motives; the one wished to exterminate the crime, the other to sell forgiveness for it.  And Torquemada connived at the griping avarice of the king, because it served to give to himself, and to the infant Inquisition, a power and authority which the Dominican foresaw would be soon greater even than those of royalty itself, and which, he imagined, by scourging earth, would redound to the interests of Heaven.  The strange disappearance of Almamen, which was distorted and exaggerated, by the credulity of the Spaniards, into an event of the most terrific character, served to complete the chain of evidence against the wealthy Jews, and Jew-descended Spaniards, of Andalusia; and while, in imagination, the king already clutched the gold of their redemption here, the Dominican kindled the flame that was to light them to punishment hereafter.  Boabdil and his chiefs received the intelligence of the Spanish retreat with a doubt which soon yielded to the most triumphant delight.  Boabdil at once resumed all the energy for which, though but by fits and starts, his earlier youth had been remarkable.  \"Alla Achbar!  God is great!\" cried he; \"we will not remain here till it suit the foe to confine the eagle again to his eyrie.  They have left us --we will burst on them.  Summon our alfaquis, we will proclaim a holy war!  The sovereign of the last possessions of the Moors is in the field. Not a town that contains a Moslem but shall receive our summons, and we will gather round our standard all the children of our faith!\"  \"May the king live for ever!\" cried the council, with one voice.  \"Lose not a moment,\" resumed Boabdil--\"on to the Vivarrambla, marshal the troops--Muza heads the cavalry; myself our foot.  Ere the sun's shadow reach yonder forest, our army shall be on its march.\"  The warriors, hastily and in joy, left the palace; and when he was alone, Boabdil again relapsed into his wonted irresolution.  After striding to and fro for some minutes in anxious thought, he abruptly quitted the hall of council, and passed in to the more private chambers of the palace, till he came to a door strongly guarded by plates of iron.  It yielded easily, however, to a small key which he carried in his girdle; and Boabdil stood in a small circular room, apparently without other door or outlet; but, after looking cautiously round, the king touched a secret spring in the wall, which, giving way, discovered a niche, in which stood a small lamp, burning with the purest naphtha, and a scroll of yellow parchment covered with strange letters and hieroglyphics.  He thrust the scroll in his bosom, took the lamp in his hand, and pressing another spring within the niche, the wall receded, and showed a narrow and winding staircase.  The king reclosed the entrance, and descended: the stairs led, at last, into clamp and rough passages; and the murmur of waters, that reached his ear through the thick walls, indicated the subterranean nature of the soil through which they were hewn.  The lamp burned clear and steady through the darkness of the place; and Boabdil proceeded with such impatient rapidity, that the distance (in reality, considerable) which he traversed, before he arrived at his destined bourne, was quickly measured.  He came at last into a wide cavern, guarded by doors concealed and secret as those which had screened the entrance from the upper air.  He was in one of the many vaults which made the mighty cemetery of the monarchs of Granada; and before him stood the robed and crowned skeleton, and before him glowed the magic dial-plate of which he had spoken in his interview with Muza.  \"Oh, dread and awful image!\" cried the king, throwing himself on his knees before the skeleton,--\"shadow of what was once a king, wise in council, and terrible in war, if in those hollow bones yet lurks the impalpable and unseen spirit, hear thy repentant son.  Forgive, while it is yet time, the rebellion of his fiery youth, and suffer thy daring soul to animate the doubt and weakness of his own.  I go forth to battle, waiting not the signal thou didst ordain.  Let not the penance for a rashness, to which fate urges me on, attach to my country, but to me. And if I perish in the field, may my evil destinies be buried with me, and a worthier monarch redeem my errors and preserve Granada!\"  As the king raised his looks, the unrelaxed grin of the grim dead, made yet more hideous by the mockery of the diadem and the royal robe, froze back to ice the passion and sorrow at his heart.  He shuddered, and rose with a deep sigh; when, as his eyes mechanically followed the lifted arm of the skeleton, he beheld, with mingled delight and awe, the hitherto motionless finger of the dial-plate pass slowly on, and rest at the word so long and so impatiently desired.  \"ARM!\" cried the king; \"do I read aright?--are my prayers heard?\"  A low and deep sound, like that of subterranean thunder, boomed through the chamber; and in the same instant the wall opened, and "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9759"],["title","Leila or, the Siege of Granada, Book IV. (#1)"],["body","paced the royal herald and sounded the last warning.  The hush of the immense armament-- the glare of the torches, lighting the ebon faces and giant forms of their bearers--the majestic appearance of the king himself--the heroic aspect of Muza--the bare head and glittering banner of Almamen--all combined with the circumstances of the time to invest the spectacle with something singularly awful, and, perhaps, sublime.  Quexada turned his eyes, mutely, round the ghastly faces of his warriors, and still made not the signal.  His lips muttered--his eyes glared: when, suddenly, he heard below the wail of women; and the thought of Inez, the bride of his youth, the partner of his age, came upon him; and, with a trembling hand, he lowered the yet unquailing standard of Spain.  Then, the silence below broke into a mighty shout, which shook the grim tower to its unsteady and temporary base.  \"Arise, my friends,\" he said, with a bitter sigh; \"we have fought like men--and our country will not blush for us.\"  He descended the winding stairs--his soldiers followed him with faltering steps: the gates of the keep unfolded, and these gallant Christians surrendered themselves to the Moor.  \"Do with it as you will,\" said Quexada, as he laid the keys at the hoofs of Boabdil's barb; \"but there are women in the garrison, who--\"  \"Are sacred,\" interrupted the king.  \"At once we accord their liberty, and free transport whithersoever ye would desire.  Speak, then!  To what place of safety shall they be conducted?\"  \"Generous king!\" replied the veteran Quexada, brushing away his tears with the back of his hand; \"you take the sting from our shame.  We accept your offer in the same spirit in which it is made.  Across the mountains, on the verge of the plain of Olfadez, I possess a small castle, ungarrisoned and unfortified.  Thence, should the war take that direction, the women can readily obtain safe conduct to the queen at Cordova.\"  \"Be it so,\" returned Boabdil.  Then, with Oriental delicacy, selecting the eldest of the officers round him, he gave him instructions to enter the castle, and, with a strong guard, provide for the safety of the women, according to the directions of Quexada.  To another of his officers he confided the Spanish prisoners, and gave the signal to his army to withdraw from the spot, leaving only a small body to complete the ruin of the fortress.  Accompanied by Almamen and his principal officers, Boabdil now hastened towards Granada; and while, with slower progress, Quexada and his companions, under a strong escort, took their way across the Vega, a sudden turn in their course brought abruptly before them the tower they had so valiantly defended.  There it still stood, proud and stern, amidst the blackened and broken wrecks around it, shooting aloft, dark and grim, against the sky.  Another moment, and a mighty crash sounded on their ears, while the tower fell to the earth, amidst volumes of wreathing smoke and showers of dust, which were borne, by the concussion to the spot on which they took their last gaze of the proudest fortress on which the Moors of Granada had beheld, from their own walls, the standard of Arragon and Castile.  At the same time, Leila--thus brought so strangely within the very reach of her father and her lover, and yet, by a mysterious fate, still divided from both,--with Donna Inez, and the rest of the females of the garrison, pursued her melancholy path along the ridges of the mountains.     CHAPTER II.  ALMAMEN'S PROPOSED ENTERPRISE.--THE THREE ISRAELITES--CIRCUMSTANCE IMPRESSES EACH CHARACTER WITH A VARYING DIE.  Boadbil followed up his late success with a series of brilliant assaults on-the neighbouring fortresses.  Granada, like a strong man bowed to the ground, wrenched one after one the bands that had crippled her liberty and strength; and, at length, after regaining a considerable portion of the surrounding territory, the king resolved to lay siege to the seaport of Salobrena.  Could he obtain this town, Boabdil, by establishing communication between the sea and Granada, would both be enabled to avail himself of the assistance of his African allies, and also prevent the Spaniards from cutting off supplies to the city, should they again besiege it.  Thither, then, accompanied by Muza, the Moorish king bore his victorious standard.  On the eve of his departure, Almamen sought the king's presence.  A great change had come over the canton since the departure of Ferdinand; his wonted stateliness of mien was gone; his eyes were sunk and hollow; his manner disturbed and absent.  In fact, his love for his daughter made the sole softness of his character; and that daughter was in the hands of the king who had sentenced the father to the tortures of the Inquisition! To what dangers might she not be subjected, by the intolerant zeal of conversion! and could that frame, and gentle heart, brave the terrific engines that might be brought against her fears?  \"Better,\" thought he, \"that she should perish, even by the torture, than adopt that hated faith.\"  He gnashed his teeth in agony at either alternative.  His dreams, his objects, his revenge, his ambition--all forsook him: one single hope, one thought, completely mastered his stormy passions and fitful intellect.  In this mood the pretended santon met Boabdil.  He represented to the king, over whom his influence had prodigiously increased since the late victories of the Moors, the necessity of employing the armies of Ferdinand at a distance.  He proposed, in furtherance of this policy, to venture himself in Cordova; to endeavour secretly to stir up those Moors, in that, their ancient kingdom, who had succumbed to the Spanish yoke, and whose hopes might naturally be inflamed by the recent successes of Boabdil; and, at least, to foment such disturbances as might afford the king sufficient time to complete his designs, and recruit his force by aid of the powers with which he was in league.  The representations of Almamen at length conquered Boabdil's reluctance to part with his sacred guide; and it was finally arranged that the Israelite should at once depart from the city.  As Almamen pursued homeward his solitary way, he found himself suddenly accosted in the Hebrew tongue.  He turned hastily, and saw before him an old man in the Jewish gown: he recognised Elias, one of the wealthiest and most eminent of the race of Israel.  \"Pardon me, wise countryman!\" said the Jew, bowing to the earth, \"but I cannot resist the temptation of claiming kindred with one through whom the horn of Israel may be so triumphantly exalted.\"  \"Hush, man!\" said Almamen, quickly, and looking sharply round; \"I thy countryman!  Art thou not, as thy speech betokens, an Israelite?\"  \"Yea,\" returned the Jew, \"and of the same tribe as thy honoured father-- peace be with his ashes!  I remembered thee at once, boy though thou wert when thy steps shook off the dust against Granada.  I remembered thee, I say, at once, on thy return; but I have kept thy secret, trusting that, through thy soul and genius, thy fallen brethren might put off sackcloth and feast upon the house-tops.\"  Almamen looked hard at the keen, sharp, Arab features of the Jew; and at length he answered, \"And how can Israel be restored? wilt thou fight for her?\"  \"I am too old, son of Issachar, to bear arms; but our tribes are many, and our youth strong.  Amid these disturbances between dog and dog--\"  \"The lion may get his own,\" interrupted Almamen, impetuously,--\"let us hope it.  Hast thou heard of the new persecutions against us that the false Nazarene king has already commenced in Cordova--persecutions that make the heart sick and the blood cold?\"  \"Alas!\" replied Elias, \"such woes indeed have not failed to reach mine ear; and I have kindred, near and beloved kindred, wealthy and honoured men, scattered throughout that land.\"  \"Were it not better that they should die on the field than by the rack?\" exclaimed Almamen, fiercely.  \"God of my fathers! if there be yet a spark of manhood left amongst thy people, let thy servant fan it to a flame, that shall burn as the fire burns the stubble, so that the earth may bare before the blaze!\"  \"Nay,\" said Elias, dismayed rather than excited by the vehemence of his comrade,--\"be not rash, son of Issachar, be not rash: peradventure thou wilt but exasperate the wrath of the rulers, and our substance thereby will be utterly consumed.\"  Almamen drew back, placed his hand quietly on the Jew's shoulder, looked him hard in the face, and, gently laughing, turned away.  Elias did not attempt to arrest his steps.  \"Impracticable,\" he muttered; \"impracticable and dangerous!  I always thought so.  He may do us harm: were he not so strong and fierce, I would put my knife under his left rib.  Verily, gold is a great thing; and--out on me! the knaves at home will be wasting the oil, now they know old Elias is abroad.\"  Thereat the Jew drew his cloak around him, and quickened his pace.  Almamen, in the meanwhile, sought, through dark and subterranean passages, known only to himself, his accustomed home.  He passed much of the night alone; but, ere the morning star announced to the mountain tops the presence of the sun, he stood, prepared for his journey, in his secret vault, by the door of the subterranean passages, with old Ximen beside him.  \"I go, Ximen,\" said Almamen, \"upon a doubtful quest: whether I discover my daughter, and succeed in bearing her in safety from their contaminating grasp, or whether I fall into their snares and perish, there is an equal chance that I may return no more to Granada.  Should this be so, you will be heir to such wealth as I leave in these places I know that your age will be consoled for the lack of children when your eyes look upon the laugh of gold.\"  Ximen bowed low, and mumbled out some inaudible protestations and thanks. Almamen sighed heavily as he looked round the room.  \"I have evil omens in my soul, and evil prophecies in my books,\" said he, "]]]
