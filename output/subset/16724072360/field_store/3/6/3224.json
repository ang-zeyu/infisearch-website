There was a sick feeling in his stomach for the rest of the day and he returned again and again to examine the hairline around the hook.  The next day he discovered an even more serious threat: the thin skin of the bubble had been spot-welded to the outside reinforcing girders.  Such welding often created hard, brittle spots that would soon crystallize from continued movement--and there was a slight temperature difference in the bubble between his working and sleeping hours that would daily produce a contraction and expansion of the skin. Especially when he used the little cooking burner.  He quit using the burner for any purpose and began a daily inspection of every square inch of the bubble's walls, marking with white chalk all the welding spots that appeared to be definitely weakened. Each day he found more to mark and soon the little white circles were scattered across the walls wherever he looked.  When he was not working at examining the walls he could feel the windows watching him, like staring eyes. Out of self defense he would have to go to them and stare back at the emptiness.  Space was alien; coldly, deadly, alien. He was a tiny spark of life in a hostile sea of Nothing and there was no one to help him. The Nothing outside was waiting day and night for the most infinitesimal leak or crack in the walls; the Nothing that had been waiting out there since time without beginning and would wait for time without end.  Sometimes he would touch his finger to the wall and think, _Death is out there, only one-sixteenth of an inch away_. His first fears became a black and terrible conviction: the bubble could not continue to resist the attack for long. It had already lasted longer than it should have. Two million pounds of pressure wanted out and all the sucking Nothing of intergalactic space wanted in. And only a thin skin of metal, rotten with brittle welding spots, stood between them.  It wanted in--the Nothing wanted in. He knew, then, that Horne and Silverman had not been insane. It wanted in and someday it would get in. When it did it would explode him and jerk out his guts and lungs. Not until that happened, not until the Nothing filled the bubble and enclosed his hideous, turned-inside-out body would it ever be content ...         *       *       *       *       *  He had long since quit wearing the magnetized shoes, afraid the vibration of them would weaken the bubble still more. And he began noticing sections where the bubble did not seem to be perfectly concave, as though the rolling mill had pressed the metal too thin in places and it was swelling out like an over-inflated balloon.  He could not remember when he had last attended to the instruments. Nothing was important but the danger that surrounded him. He knew the danger was rapidly increasing because whenever he pressed his ear to the wall he could hear the almost inaudible tickings and vibrations as the bubble's skin contracted or expanded and the Nothing tapped and searched with its empty fingers for a flaw or crack that it could tear into a leak.  But the windows were far the worst, with the Nothing staring in at him day and night. There was no escape from it. He could feel it watching him, malignant and gloating, even when he hid his eyes in his hands.  The time came when he could stand it no longer. The cot had a blanket and he used that together with all his spare clothes to make a tent stretching from the table to the first instrument panel. When he crawled under it he found that the lower half of one window could still see him. He used the clothes he was wearing to finish the job and it was much better then, hiding there in the concealing darkness where the Nothing could not see him.  He did not mind going naked--the temperature regulators in the bubble never let it get too cold.  He had no conception of time from then on. He emerged only when necessary to bring more food into his tent. He could still hear the Nothing tapping and sucking in its ceaseless search for a flaw and he made such emergences as brief as possible, wishing that he did not have to come out at all. Maybe if he could hide in his tent for a long time and never make a sound it would get tired and go away ...  Sometimes he thought of the cruiser and wished they would come for him but most of the time he thought of the thing that was outside, trying to get in to kill him. When the strain became too great he would draw himself up in the position he had once occupied in his mother's womb and pretend he had never left Earth. It was easier there.  But always, before very long, the bubble would tick or whisper and he would freeze in terror, thinking, _This time it's coming in ..._         *       *       *       *       *  Then one day, suddenly, two men were peering under his tent at him.  One of them said, \"My God--_again!_\" and he wondered what he meant. But they were very nice to him and helped him put on his clothes. Later, in the cruiser, everything was hazy and they kept asking him what he was afraid of.  \"What was it--what did you find?\"  He tried hard to think so he could explain it. \"It was--it was Nothing.\"  \"What were you and Horne and Silverman afraid of--what was it?\" the voice demanded insistently.  \"I told you,\" he said. \"Nothing.\"  They stared at him and the haziness cleared a little as he saw they did not understand. He wanted them to believe him because what he told them was so very true.  \"It wanted to kill us. Please--can't you believe me? It was waiting outside the bubble to kill us.\"  But they kept staring and he knew they didn't believe him. They didn't _want_ to believe him ...  Everything turned hazy again and he started to cry. He was glad when the doctor took his hand to lead him away ...  The bubble was carefully inspected, inside and out, and nothing was found. When it was time for Green's replacement to be transferred to it Larkin reported to Captain McDowell.  \"Everything is ready, Larkin,\" McDowell said. \"You're the next one. I wish we knew what the danger is.\" He scowled. \"I still think one of my roustabouts from the engine room might give us a sane report six months from now instead of the babblings we'll get from you.\"  He felt his face flush and he said stiffly, \"I suggest, sir, that you not jump to conclusions until that time comes.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The cruiser vanished back into hyperspace and he was alone inside the observation bubble, ten thousand light-years beyond the galaxy's outermost sun. He looked out the windows at the gigantic sea of emptiness around him and wondered again what the danger had been that had so terrified the men before him.  Of one thing he was already certain; he would find that nothing was waiting outside the bubble to kill him ...

How will you leave your ship?\"  \"Don't worry about that,\" Preston said calmly.  \"We have to worry! We don't dare open the Dome, with those creatures outside. You _can't_ come down, Postal Ship.\"  \"You want your mail or don't you?\"  The colonist paused. \"Well--\"  \"Okay, then,\" Preston said. \"Shut up and give me landing coordinates!\"  There was a pause, and then the figures started coming over. Preston jotted them down on a scratch-pad.  \"Okay, I've got them. Now sit tight and wait.\" He glanced contemptuously at the three mail-pouches behind him, grinned, and started setting up the orbit.  _Mailman, am I? I'll show them!_         *       *       *       *       *  He brought the Postal Ship down with all the skill of his years in the Patrol, spiralling in around the big satellite of Jupiter as cautiously and as precisely as if he were zeroing in on a pirate lair in the asteroid belt. In its own way, this was as dangerous, perhaps even more so.  Preston guided the ship into an ever-narrowing orbit, which he stabilized about a hundred miles over the surface of Ganymede. As his ship swung around the moon's poles in its tight orbit, he began to figure some fuel computations.  His scratch-pad began to fill with notations.  _Fuel storage--_  _Escape velocity--_  _Margin of error--_  _Safety factor--_  Finally he looked up. He had computed exactly how much spare fuel he had, how much he could afford to waste. It was a small figure--too small, perhaps.  He turned to the radio. \"Ganymede?\"  \"Where are you, Postal Ship?\"  \"I'm in a tight orbit about a hundred miles up,\" Preston said. \"Give me the figures on the circumference of your Dome, Ganymede?\"  \"Seven miles,\" the colonist said. \"What are you planning to do?\"  Preston didn't answer. He broke contact and scribbled some more figures. Seven miles of iceworms, eh? That was too much to handle. He had planned on dropping flaming fuel on them and burning them out, but he couldn't do it that way.  He'd have to try a different tactic.  Down below, he could see the blue-white ammonia ice that was the frozen atmosphere of Ganymede. Shimmering gently amid the whiteness was the transparent yellow of the Dome beneath whose curved walls lived the Ganymede Colony. Even forewarned, Preston shuddered. Surrounding the Dome was a living, writhing belt of giant worms.  \"Lovely,\" he said. \"Just lovely.\"  Getting up, he clambered over the mail sacks and headed toward the rear of the ship, hunting for the auxiliary fuel-tanks.  Working rapidly, he lugged one out and strapped it into an empty gun turret, making sure he could get it loose again when he'd need it.  He wiped away sweat and checked the angle at which the fuel-tank would face the ground when he came down for a landing. Satisfied, he knocked a hole in the side of the fuel-tank.  \"Okay, Ganymede,\" he radioed. \"I'm coming down.\"  He blasted loose from the tight orbit and rocked the ship down on manual. The forbidding surface of Ganymede grew closer and closer. Now he could see the iceworms plainly.  Hideous, thick creatures, lying coiled in masses around the Dome. Preston checked his spacesuit, making sure it was sealed. The instruments told him he was a bare ten miles above Ganymede now. One more swing around the poles would do it.  He peered out as the Dome came below and once again snapped on the radio.         *       *       *       *       *  \"I'm going to come down and burn a path through those worms of yours. Watch me carefully, and jump to it when you see me land. I want that airlock open, or else.\"  \"But--\"  \"No buts!\"  He was right overhead now. Just one ordinary-type gun would solve the whole problem, he thought. But Postal Ships didn't get guns. They weren't supposed to need them.  He centered the ship as well as he could on the Dome below and threw it into automatic pilot. Jumping from the control panel, he ran back toward the gun turret and slammed shut the plexilite screen. Its outer wall opened and the fuel-tank went tumbling outward and down. He returned to his control-panel seat and looked at the viewscreen. He smiled.  The fuel-tank was lying near the Dome--right in the middle of the nest of iceworms. The fuel was leaking from the puncture.  The iceworms writhed in from all sides.  \"Now!\" Preston said grimly.  The ship roared down, jets blasting. The fire licked out, heated the ground, melted snow--ignited the fuel-tank! A gigantic flame blazed up, reflected harshly off the snows of Ganymede.  And the mindless iceworms came, marching toward the fire, being consumed, as still others devoured the bodies of the dead and dying.  Preston looked away and concentrated on the business of finding a place to land the ship.         *       *       *       *       *  The holocaust still raged as he leaped down from the catwalk of the ship, clutching one of the heavy mail sacks, and struggled through the melting snows to the airlock.  He grinned. The airlock was open.  Arms grabbed him, pulled him through. Someone opened his helmet.  \"Great job, Postman!\"  \"There are two more mail sacks,\" Preston said. \"Get men out after them.\"  The man in charge gestured to two young colonists, who donned spacesuits and dashed through the airlock. Preston watched as they raced to the ship, climbed in, and returned a few moments later with the mail sacks.  \"You've got it all,\" Preston said. \"I'm checking out. I'll get word to the Patrol to get here and clean up that mess for you.\"  \"How can we thank you?\" the official-looking man asked.  \"No need to,\" Preston said casually. \"I had to get that mail down here some way, didn't I?\"  He turned away, smiling to himself. Maybe the Chief _had_ known what he was doing when he took an experienced Patrol man and dumped him into Postal. Delivering the mail to Ganymede had been more hazardous than fighting off half a dozen space pirates. _I guess I was wrong_, Preston thought. _This is no snap job for old men._  Preoccupied, he started out through the airlock. The man in charge caught his arm. \"Say, we don't even know your name! Here you are a hero, and--\"  \"Hero?\" Preston shrugged. \"All I did was deliver the mail. It's all in a day's work, you know. The mail's got to get through!\"   THE END     Transcriber's Note:      This etext was produced from _Amazing Stories_ September 1957.
