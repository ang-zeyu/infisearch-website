Belgezad couldn't possibly have bribed the cop, so they both had to be gassed.  \"If he didn't see his assailant, how does he know who it was?\"  \"You were followed from the palace by Jomis Dobigel, who saw you put the necklace into the baggage locker. There are several other witnesses to that.\"  Drake leaned forward. \"Let me point out, my Lord Prosecutor, that the only evidence you have that I was anywhere near the palace is the word of Jomis Dobigel. And he didn't see me _inside_ the palace. I was outside the wall.\"  The Prosecutor shrugged. \"We admit the possibility of an assistant inside the walls of the palace,\" he said. \"We are investigating that now. But even if we never find your accomplice, we have proof that you were implicated, and that is enough.\"  \"What proof do you have?\" Drake asked blandly.  \"Why, the necklace itself, of course!\" The Prosecutor looked as though he suspected Drake of having taken leave of his senses.  Drake shook his head. \"That necklace is mine. I can prove it. It was made for me by a respectable jeweler on Seladon II. It's a very good imitation, but it's a phoney. They aren't diamonds; they're simply well-cut crystals of titanium dioxide. Check them if you don't believe me.\"  The Lord Prosecutor looked dumbfounded. \"But--what--why--\"  Drake looked sad. \"I brought it to give to my good friend, the Noble Belgezad. Of course it would be a gross insult to wear them at the Shan's Coronation, but he could wear them at other functions.  \"And how does my good friend repay me? By having me arrested. My Lord Prosecutor, I am a wronged man.\"  The Prosecutor swallowed heavily and stood up. \"The necklace has, naturally, been impounded by the police. I shall have the stones tested.\"  \"You'll find they're phonies,\" Drake said. \"And that means one of two things. Either they are not the ones stolen from Belgezad or else Belgezad has mortally insulted his Shan by wearing false jewels to the Coronation.\"  \"Well! We shall see about this!\" said the Lord Prosecutor.         *       *       *       *       *  Anson Drake, free as a lark, was packing his clothes in his hotel room when the announcer chimed. He punched the TV pickup and grinned. It was the girl.  When the door slid aside, she came in, smiling. \"You got away with it, Drake! Wonderful! I don't know how you did it, but--\"  \"Did what?\" Drake looked innocent.  \"Get away with the necklace, of course! I don't know how it happened that Dobigel was there, but--\"  \"But, but, but,\" Drake said, smiling. \"You don't seem to know very much at all, do you?\"  \"Wha--what do you mean?\"  Drake put his last article of clothing in his suitcase and snapped it shut. \"I'll probably be searched pretty thoroughly when I get to the spaceport,\" he said coolly, \"but they won't find anything on an innocent man.\"  \"Where is the necklace?\" she asked in a throaty voice.  Drake pretended not to hear her. \"It's a funny thing,\" he said. \"Old Belgezad would never let the necklace out of his hands except to get me. He thought he'd get it back by making sure I was followed. But he made two mistakes.\"  The girl put her arms around his neck. \"His mistakes don't matter as long as we have the necklace, do they?\"  Anson Drake was never a man to turn down an invitation like that. He held her in his arms and kissed her--long and lingeringly.  When he broke away, he went on as though nothing had happened.  \"Two mistakes. The first one was thinking up such an obviously silly plot. If it were as easy to steal jewels from the palace as all that, nothing would be safe on Thizar.  \"The second mistake was sending his daughter to trap me.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The girl gasped and stepped back.  \"It was very foolish of you, Miss Belgezad,\" he went on calmly. \"You see, I happened to know that the real Norma Knight was sentenced to seven years in Seladon Prison over a week ago. Unfortunately, the news hadn't reached Thizar yet. I knew from the first that the whole thing was to be a frame-up. It's too bad that your father had to use the real necklace--it's a shame he lost it.\"  The girl's eyes blazed. \"You--you _thief_! You--\" She used words which no self-respecting lady is supposed to use.  Drake waited until she had finished, and then said: \"Oh, no, Miss Belgezad; I'm no thief. Your father can consider the loss of that necklace as a fine for running narcotics. And you can tell him that if I catch him again, it will be worse.  \"I don't like his kind of slime, and I'll do my best to get rid of them. That's all, Miss B.; it was nice knowing you.\"  He walked out of the room, leaving her to stand there in helpless fury.  His phony necklace had come in handy after all; the police had thought they had the real one, so they had never bothered to check the Galactic Mail Service for a small package mailed to Seladon II. All he'd had to do was drop it into the mail chute from his room and then cool his heels in jail while the Galactic Mails got rid of the loot for him.  The Necklace of Algol would be waiting for him when he got to Seladon II.   THE END     Transcriber's Note:      This etext was produced from _Amazing Stories_ October 1956.

But I want to go. Maybe my grandmother'll be there. The surgeons made her young and pretty again every few years; she looked like my sister when I left.\"  Laney nodded her head. \"There's no point arguing with him, Kanaday. He has to go back there and find out, so let him alone.\"  Rolf smiled. \"Thanks for understanding.\" He took out Quinton's card and turned it over and over in his hand.         *       *       *       *       *  Rolf went to Yawk on foot, dressed in his best clothes, with his face as clean as it had been in some years. Spacertown was just across the river from Yawk, and the bridges spanning the river were bright and gleaming in the mid-afternoon sun.  The bombs had landed on Yawk during the long-forgotten war, but somehow they had spared the sprawling borough across the river. And so Yawk had been completely rebuilt, once the radioactivity had been purged from the land, while what was now Spacertown consisted mostly of buildings that dated back to the Twentieth Century.  Yawk had been the world's greatest seaport; now it was the world's greatest spaceport. The sky was thick with incoming and outgoing liners. The passengers on the ship usually stayed at Yawk, which had become an even greater metropolis than it had been before the Bomb. The crew crossed the river to Spacertown, where they could find their own kind.  Yawk and Spacertown were like two separate planets. There were three bridges spanning the river, but most of the time they went unused, except by spacemen going back home or by spacemen going to the spaceport for embarkation. There was no regular transportation between the two cities; to get from Spacertown to Yawk, you could borrow a jetcar or you could walk. Rolf walked.  He enjoyed the trip. _I'm going back home_, he thought as he paced along the gleaming arc of the bridge, dressed in his Sunday best. He remembered the days of his own childhood, his parentless childhood. His earliest memory was of a fight at the age of six or so. He had stood off what seemed like half the neighborhood, ending the battle by picking up an older bully, much feared by everyone, and heaving him over a fence. When he told his grandmother about the way he had won the fight she cried for an hour, and never told him why. But they had never picked on him again, though he knew the other boys had jeered at him behind his back as he grew bigger and bigger over the years. \"Ape,\" they called him. \"Ape.\"  But never to his face.  He approached the Yawk end of the bridge. A guard was waiting there--an Earther guard, small and frail, but with a sturdy-looking blaster at his hip.  \"Going back, Spacer?\"  Rolf started. How did the guard know? And then he realized that all the guard meant was, are you going back to your ship?  \"No. No, I'm going to a party. Kal Quinton's house.\"  \"Tell me another, Spacer.\" The guard's voice was light and derisive. A swift poke in the ribs would break him in half, Rolf thought.  \"I'm serious. Quinton invited me. Here's his card.\"  \"If this is a joke it'll mean trouble. But go ahead; I'll take your word for it.\"  Rolf marched on past the guard, almost nonchalantly. He looked at the address on the card. _12406 Kenman Road._ He rooted around in his fading memory of Yawk, but he found the details had blurred under the impact of five years of Mars and Venus and the Belt and Neptune. He did not know where Kenman Road was.  The glowing street signs were not much help either. One said 287th Street and the other said 72nd Avenue. Kenman Road might be anywhere.  He walked on a block or two. The streets were antiseptically clean, and he had the feeling that his boots, which had lately trod in Spacertown, were leaving dirtmarks along the street. He did not look back to see.         *       *       *       *       *  He looked at his wristchron. It was getting late, and Kenman Road might be anywhere. He turned into a busy thoroughfare, conscious that he was attracting attention. The streets here were crowded with little people who barely reached his chest; they were all about the same height, and most of them looked alike. A few had had radical surgical alterations, and every one of these was different. One had a unicorn-like horn; another, an extra eye which cunningly resembled his real ones. The Earthers were looking at him furtively, as they would at a tiger or an elephant strolling down a main street.  \"Where are you going, Spacer?\" said a voice from the middle of the street.  Rolf's first impulse was to snarl out a curse and keep moving, but he realized that the question was a good one and one whose answer he was trying to find out for himself. He turned.  Another policeman stood on the edge of the walkway. \"Are you lost?\" The policeman was short and delicate-looking.  Rolf produced his card.  The policeman studied it. \"What business do you have with Quinton?\"  \"Just tell me how to get there,\" Rolf said. \"I'm in a hurry.\"  The policeman backed up a step. \"All right, take it easy.\" He pointed to a kiosk. \"Take the subcar here. There's a stop at Kenman Road. You can find your way from there.\"  \"I'd rather walk it,\" Rolf said. He did not want to have to stand the strain of riding in a subcar with a bunch of curious staring Earthers.  \"Fine with me,\" the policeman said. \"It's about two hundred blocks to the north. Got a good pair of legs?\"  \"Never mind,\" Rolf said. \"I'll take the subcar.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Kenman Road was a quiet little street in an expensive-looking end of Yawk. 12406 was a towering building which completely overshadowed everything else on the street. As Rolf entered the door, a perfumed little Earther with a flashing diamond where his left eye should have been and a skin stained bright purple appeared from nowhere.  \"We've been waiting for you. Come on; Kal will be delighted that you're here.\"  The elevator zoomed up so quickly that Rolf thought for a moment that he was back in space. But it stopped suddenly at the 62nd floor, and, as the door swung open, the sounds of wild revelry drifted down the hall. Rolf had a brief moment of doubt when he pictured Laney and Kanaday at this very moment, playing cards in their mouldering hovel while he walked down this plastiline corridor back into a world he had left behind.  Quinton came out into the hall to greet him. Rolf recognized him by the missing ears; his skin was now a subdued blue to go with his orange robe.  \"I'm so glad you came,\" the little Earther bubbled. \"Come on in and I'll introduce you to everyone.\"  The door opened photoelectrically as they approached. Quinton seized him by the hand and dragged him in. There was the sound of laughter and of shouting. As he entered it all stopped, suddenly, as if it had been shut off. Rolf stared at them quizzically from under his lowering brows, and they looked at him with ill-concealed curiosity.  They seemed divided into two groups. Clustered at one end of the long hall was a group of Earthers who seemed completely identical, all with the same features, looking like so many dolls in a row. These were the Earthers he remembered, the ones whom the plastic surgeons had hacked at and hewn until they all conformed to the prevailing concept of beauty.  Then at the other end was a different group. They were all different. Some had glittering jewels set in their foreheads, others had no lips, no hair, extra eyes, three nostrils. They were a weird and frightening group, highest product of the plastic surgeon's art.  Both groups were staring silently at Rolf.  \"Friends, this is Rolf--Rolf--\"  \"Dekker,\" Rolf said after a pause. He had almost forgotten his own last name.  \"Rolf Dekker, just back from outer space. I've invited him to join us tonight. I think you'll enjoy meeting him.\"  The stony silence slowly dissolved into murmurs of polite conversation as the party-goers adjusted to the presence of the newcomer. They seemed to be discussing the matter earnestly among themselves, as if Quinton had done something unheard-of by bringing a Spacer into an Earther party.  A tall girl with blonde hair drifted up to him.  \"Ah. Jonne,\" Quinton said. He turned to Rolf. \"This is Jonne. She asked to be your companion at the party. She's very interested in space and things connected with it.\"  Things connected with it, Rolf thought. Meaning me. He looked at her. She was as tall an Earther as he had yet seen, and probably suffered for it when there were no Spacers around. Furthermore, he suspected, her height was accentuated for the evening by special shoes. She was not of the Individ persuasion, because her face was well-shaped, with smooth, even features, with no individualist distortion. Her skin was unstained. She wore a clinging off-the-breast tunic. Quite a dish, Rolf decided. He began to see that he might enjoy this party.         *       *       *       *       *  The other guests began to approach timidly, now that the initial shock of his presence had worn off. They asked silly little questions about space--questions which showed that they had only a superficial interest in him and were treating him as a sort of talking dog. He answered as many as he could, looking down at their little painted faces with concealed contempt.  _They think as little of me as I do of them._ The thought hit him suddenly and his broad face creased in a smile at the irony. Then the music started.         *       *       *       *       *  The knot of Earthers slowly broke up and drifted away to dance. He looked at Jonne, who had stood patiently at his side through all this.  \"I don't dance,\" he said. \"I never learned how.\" He watched the other couples moving gracefully around the floor, looking for all the world like an assemblage of puppets. He stared in the dim light, watching the couples clinging to each other as they rocked through"]]]
