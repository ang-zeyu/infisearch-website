[Illustration]     [Illustration: 4 Making Somebody Happy]  4  Making Somebody Happy   Well, that very evening Jimmy Rabbit made a certain young neighbor very happy by hanging a May basket on her door. And then he hurried along to Henry Skunk's house. He hoped Henry was still there; for when Henry Skunk went out of an evening he seldom came home until morning.  Jimmy hung the basket of eggs on the doorknob, rang the bell, and then ran and hid behind a tree. He peeped out, as he heard the door open; and he saw Henry Skunk look all around. He seemed angry, until he caught sight of the basket. And then Henry Skunk certainly was pleased.  \"Ah, ha!\" he exclaimed. \"A May basket! Now, I wonder what friend of mine has left this for me!\" He looked inside the basket. \"Ah, ha! Hens' eggs!\" he cried. \"I'll sit down on my front steps and eat them. Then I won't have to give anybody else a taste.\"  That was like Henry Skunk. He was a selfish fellow--always greedy, never offering to share a dainty with anyone.  Jimmy Rabbit was holding his mouth. He knew that if he laughed he would spoil everything. As he listened, he heard a _snap_! And Henry Skunk said \"Oh!\" as if something hurt him, and surprised him, both. \"I declare, I've broken a tooth!\" he exclaimed. \"That's the hardest egg I ever saw. I'll try another.\" And he took another egg out of the basket.  There was another _snap_! This time Henry cried \"Ow!\" It was queer, to break two teeth like that. And he reached into the basket for the third egg. \"It certainly can't happen again,\" Henry told himself. And he bit the third egg with all his might.  How it hurt him! He fairly howled with pain.  And then Jimmy Rabbit snickered. He could hold in his laughter no longer.  That was enough for Henry Skunk. He looked around quickly. And what he saw made him very angry. For he knew then that those eggs were nothing but a joke.  Now, when he tittered, Jimmy Rabbit had jumped back behind the tree round which he had been peeping. He thought that he was safely out of sight. But he had forgotten all about his ears. They were so long, and they stuck out so far, that Henry Skunk could see them. And he knew right away who had played that trick on him.  He did not think it was any joke, to break three teeth. And he began to creep toward those ears. But there was one thing that Henry Skunk had not noticed. He had not looked up in the branches above Jimmy Rabbit's head. If he had, he would have seen Frisky Squirrel, who had come along to see the fun.  As soon as Frisky saw what was happening, he cried:  \"Look out, Jimmy!\"  And Jimmy Rabbit looked out just in time. The smile faded from his face. And he turned and ran.  Henry Skunk did not chase him. He was no runner. But he hoped that some day he could catch _both_ those meddlesome youngsters.  [Illustration: Jimmy Rabbit delivers his May basket]  \"Well, what did I tell you?\" Jimmy Rabbit said, when Frisky joined him at a good, safe distance from Henry Skunk's house. \"Didn't I say there'd be some fun?\"  \"But I don't understand what happened,\" Frisky said. \"I thought Henry Skunk _liked_ hens' eggs.\"  \"So he does!\" Jimmy Rabbit answered. \"But those were not real hens' eggs. They were china eggs which I found in Farmer Green's henhouse. And they were almost as hard as stones.\"  Frisky Squirrel laughed.  \"I wish we had some more,\" he said. \"Then we could hang a May basket on Fatty Coon's door.... I don't suppose you'd care to go back to Henry's house and get those eggs?\"  \"I don't suppose I would,\" said Jimmy Rabbit.     [Illustration: 5 The New Wheelbarrow]  5  The New Wheelbarrow   There was something that Jimmy Rabbit wanted. He had teased for it for a long time. And at last, after he had almost made up his mind that he wasn't going to get it, one day to his great joy his father brought home the very thing Jimmy had begged for. It was a wheelbarrow! Jimmy Rabbit could hardly believe his eyes.  \"Well, young man, you ought to be pretty grateful for this,\" Mr. Rabbit said.  \"Yes, Father!\" Jimmy answered. He picked up the handles of the wheelbarrow, and began pushing it proudly about the dooryard. \"I'm going to play with my wheelbarrow all the time after this,\" Jimmy said.  \"I reckon you can do a little work with it, too,\" Mr. Rabbit told him. \"I shall expect you to bring home the vegetables for the whole family, every morning.\"  \"Yes, Father!\" Jimmy answered. He thought that would be great sport. He didn't stop to think that it would take a good many vegetables to feed his father and his mother, his four sisters, his two brothers, and himself.  \"I hope, now, to have a little time for recreation,\" Mr. Rabbit remarked.  \"It's too bad you have to work so hard,\" said Jimmy. \"Recreation\" was a big word. Jimmy supposed that it was some kind of specially hard work. He did not know that it meant _play_. \"I'll go down to Farmer Green's garden right away and get a load of his best vegetables!\" Jimmy exclaimed.  Down in Farmer Green's garden Jimmy worked busily, loading his new wheelbarrow to the very top. And then he trundled it home again. No prouder youngster was ever seen in Pleasant Valley than Jimmy Rabbit, pushing that little wheelbarrow up the hill.  \"Let me push it!\" Frisky Squirrel begged.  But Jimmy Rabbit said that he mustn't let anybody else play with that wheelbarrow.  \"Let me take hold of one handle!\" Billy Woodchuck pleaded.  But Jimmy Rabbit told him that _that_ was no way to wheel a wheelbarrow.  Somehow, the next day Jimmy didn't have half so much fun getting the vegetables. And the day after that he actually began to think that gathering vegetables was a good deal like work. And before a week had passed he just hated the sight of Farmer Green's garden.  But all Jimmy's friends still crowded around and begged him to let them push the wheelbarrow. And all the while he had been very firm. He had not given one of them leave to touch the barrow.  At last Jimmy Rabbit had an idea.  \"I'll tell you what I'll do,\" he said to Frisky Squirrel. \"If you weren't my best friend I'd never think of such a thing. And you mustn't expect I'm going to let you do this often----\"  \"Do what?\" Frisky asked.  \"Why, wheel my wheelbarrow!\" said Jimmy.  Frisky Squirrel jumped high up in the air, he was so pleased.  \"Hurrah!\" he cried. \"May I push it now, before you fill it with vegetables?\"  \"Well--no! It's getting late,\" said Jimmy. \"My mother will be expecting me soon. I'll let you wheel the vegetables home for me. But first, you must gather them.\"  Frisky Squirrel was more than willing. And he filled the barrow with cabbages and turnips, lettuce and peas, while Jimmy Rabbit looked on and ordered him about.  \"There!\" said Jimmy, when the wheelbarrow was full. \"Now we'll go home.\" And then, to Frisky Squirrel's surprise, Jimmy climbed on top of the load and sat himself down.  \"What's that for?\" asked Frisky.  \"Why, to keep the vegetables from falling out!\" Jimmy explained. \"You see, you don't know how to wheel a wheelbarrow. You'll be tipping it, first one side and then the other. And we'd have to stop every few steps and pick up a turnip or a cabbage.\"  \"But I don't want to wheel _you_!\" said Frisky. \"You're too heavy!\"  \"Oh, very well, then!\" Jimmy answered. \"If you don't care to wheel the wheelbarrow, it's all the same to me.\" And he started to jump down from his seat on top of the load.  \"No, no!\" Frisky cried. \"Don't get off! I can manage all right!\" After gathering all those vegetables, he didn't want to lose the fun of pushing the wheelbarrow.  \"Walk fast, now!\" Jimmy said. \"We're late already.\"  [Illustration]     [Illustration: 6 A Narrow Escape]  6  A Narrow Escape   Frisky Squirrel had a hard time pushing the wheelbarrow home with Jimmy Rabbit on top of the load of vegetables. He puffed and groaned. And he had to stop every little while to catch his breath.  \"You see, you're not used to wheeling a wheelbarrow,\" Jimmy told him. \"For me, it's no trouble at all. But then, I'm stronger than you are.\"  Now, Frisky had been almost ready to tell Jimmy that he might trundle the barrow the rest of the way. But when he heard that he made up his mind that he would get that wheelbarrow up the hill to Jimmy's house if he didn't do another thing that day.  So he started on again. And at last he stopped in front of Jimmy Rabbit's door.  Jimmy hopped nimbly to the ground. But poor Frisky was so tired that he lay right down and went to sleep. And the next day he never went near Farmer Green's garden.  But Jimmy Rabbit didn't mind that at all. There were plenty of others who wanted to trundle the wheelbarrow. And this time Jimmy told Billy Woodchuck that _he_ might wheel the barrow home for him.  Once more Jimmy Rabbit stood by while the vegetables were gathered for him. Once more he seated himself on top of the load. And once more he had a free ride up the long hill. Jimmy had changed his mind about Farmer Green's garden. He even asked his mother if he might not bring home two loads of vegetables each day, instead of only one. And he was disappointed when she said \"No!\"  There was one thing, however, that Jimmy had overlooked. As the days went by, one by one his friends stayed away from the garden-patch. And at last there was nobody left who wanted to push the wheelbarrow except Fatty Coon. And Fatty Coon was really no friend of his at all. In fact, Jimmy did not like him, because he never could feel sure that Fatty would not get hungry all at once and try to eat him.  But Fatty teased so hard that at last Jimmy agreed to give him his turn at the fun (Jimmy was always careful to speak of gathering vegetables and wheeling them home as \"fun\").  When the barrow was full, Jimmy Rabbit again climbed on"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24628"],["title","The Tale of Jimmy Rabbit (#2)"],["body","of the load. But he kept very close watch of Fatty. And he was ready, any moment, to leap off the wheelbarrow in case Fatty should reach for his legs.  Fatty Coon was strong. He did not tire so easily as the others had. But finally he let go the handles and straightened up.  \"What's the matter?\" asked Jimmy. \"You're not tired, are you?\"  \"No!\" said Fatty. \"But it's harder work than I supposed. I declare, I'm getting terribly hungry.\"  When Jimmy Rabbit heard him say that, his heart went _pitty-pat_. And he almost ran away, then and there.  But what would become of his nice new wheelbarrow if he did that? He was afraid that Fatty Coon would run off with it.  \"My goodness! I'm growing hungrier every minute!\" said Fatty Coon.  Then Jimmy Rabbit had a happy thought. He grabbed up a handful of green peas and tossed them to Fatty.  \"Here!\" he said. \"Eat those! Maybe they'll make you feel better.\"  Fatty Coon ate the peas greedily.  \"More!\" he said. As you see, he was not very polite.  Jimmy threw him two handfuls then.  Still Fatty Coon said \"More!\"  So Jimmy rolled a turnip off the load. And after that he threw out a cabbage, and then a head of lettuce.  \"More! more! more!\" Fatty ordered.  And soon Jimmy Rabbit saw with dismay that the vegetables were nearly all gone. In a few moments he reached the very last one--a big turnip which he could hardly lift.  But he managed to pick it up and raise it above his head. And then with all his might he threw the turnip straight at Fatty Coon.  Fatty was just opening his mouth to say \"More!\" But he never said it. The big turnip struck him right on his fat stomach and knocked his breath out. He gave a faint groan and toppled over on the ground. And he was so fat that he started to roll.  Though he clawed at the grass to stop himself, he rolled faster and faster down the hill.  He was a very comical sight. And at any other time Jimmy Rabbit would have stopped to laugh. But Jimmy was so glad to be rid of Fatty Coon that he picked up the handles of his little wheelbarrow and ran home as fast as he could jump.     [Illustration: 7 A Fast Runner]  7  A Fast Runner   On Blue Mountain, and in Pleasant Valley as well, there lived many fast runners. And among the swiftest was Jimmy Rabbit. But he never ran very far. Whenever he was startled he would go bounding off like the wind; but pretty soon he would stop and listen to see if anyone was following him. And if it happened to be dog Spot, he always hurried to a hollow stump, or perhaps a woodchuck's hole--or a skunk's--and hid there until Spot went away.  Of course, there was some risk in going into somebody else's house. For if the owner happened to be at home there was likely to be a quarrel. Naturally, nobody likes to have some outsider burst into his house without even stopping to knock.  Now, everyone said that Jimmy Rabbit could run fast--that is, all but Tommy Fox. He never would admit that Jimmy Rabbit was much of a runner. I should hate to say that Tommy Fox was jealous. But it certainly did annoy him to hear so much said about Jimmy's wonderful speed.  Perhaps he never would have suggested the race, if Jimmy Rabbit hadn't boasted so much about his running. You see, in time Jimmy's head became turned. And he was often heard to say that there was no one in that part of the country who could beat him.  \"Of course, there may be some one, somewhere, who can outrun me,\" Jimmy Rabbit said. \"But I have yet to meet him.\"  That was a little more than Tommy Fox could bear. And he went off, looking very sour. He trotted over to the creek, did Tommy Fox. And there he might have been seen talking to Mr. Turtle. He talked with him for a long time. And when at last he went away Tommy's face wore a very different look. He was actually smiling.  The very next day Jimmy Rabbit met Tommy Fox in the woods.  \"You'd better go home!\" Tommy told him. \"You have a caller waiting to see you. I just happened to pass your house, and the caller asked me if I had seen you.\"  \"Who is it?\" Jimmy asked him.  But Tommy Fox would not tell him.  \"It's really none of my business,\" he said.  Jimmy Rabbit hurried off. He wondered who wanted to see him, and why.  He was surprised--and disappointed, too--to find that it was nobody but Mr. Turtle. And he was still more surprised when he learned his errand.  \"I have come to challenge you to a race,\" Mr. Turtle told him.  Jimmy Rabbit laughed right in his face.  \"A race!\" he exclaimed. \"Why--you can't run. I guess you've come to the wrong house. I guess you've made a mistake.\"  But Mr. Turtle said that he knew what he was about.  \"I want to race you all the way from the creek to Broad Brook, where it runs into Swift River,\" he said.  Jimmy Rabbit had hard work to keep a straight face.  \"My dear sir!\" he said. \"I could run that distance a hundred times while you were waddling it once. I don't care to race with you. It would be no fun at all for me.\"  When Mr. Turtle heard that, his beady little eyes snapped.  \"Don't be so sure!\" he said. \"I believe I can beat you. And I will bet you----\"  Jimmy Rabbit did not wait for him to finish.  \"Bet!\" he cried. \"I never bet! I'm not allowed to. My mother doesn't approve of betting. And if she heard you mention such a thing to me she would be very angry.\"  \"I didn't mean to say that,\" Mr. Turtle told him hastily. \"It was just a slip of the tongue. What I meant to say was this: If you win the race, I'll _give_ you a fine new sled; and if I win, you can _give_ me your wheelbarrow.\"  Jimmy Rabbit began to be interested. He had always wanted a sled. And by another month or two there ought to be good coasting. It certainly wasn't _betting_, he thought. And as for losing the race--and his wheelbarrow--he knew that such a thing could never happen.  \"I'll race you!\" he cried. \"When shall it be?\"  \"How would to-morrow do?\" said Mr. Turtle. \"It's a long way from the creek to Broad Brook--a good day's journey, I call it. It's too late to start to-day.\"  Jimmy Rabbit grinned. He knew that he could run that far fifty times a day.  \"I'll be at the creek early in the morning,\" he promised.  [Illustration]     [Illustration: 8 The Great Race]  8  The Great Race   On the morning of his great race with Mr. Turtle, Jimmy Rabbit was at the creek bright and early. He brought his two brothers with him, to see the fun. And he found that there were others, too, who had heard of the sport and had come to enjoy it. Frisky Squirrel was there, and Billy Woodchuck, and Fatty Coon. Then there was old Mr. Crow, who was always on hand whenever a crowd gathered. And perhaps the pleasantest and most interested of all was Tommy Fox.  \"I hope you'll let me have a ride on your new sled when the first snow comes,\" he said to Jimmy Rabbit. \"For, of course, you'll win the race. And Mr. Turtle will have to give you the sled, as he promised.\"  \"I'll see,\" said Jimmy. And that was all the answer he would give.  But Tommy Fox seemed satisfied.  \"I'm going to run along beside you,\" he told Jimmy, \"to keep you company. And I'll wait at Broad Brook with you, to see the fun when Mr. Turtle gets there. For everyone knows that you're going to win the race.\"  \"I fully expect to,\" said Jimmy.  Then Tommy drew a line in the sand.  \"Here's where you start!\" he said.  And Mr. Turtle and Jimmy Rabbit toed the mark.  \"One, two, three--go!\" cried Tommy Fox. And with that they were off. In no time at all Jimmy Rabbit had run so far that Mr. Turtle lost sight of him.  \"Just as I expected!\" Tommy Fox said to Jimmy Rabbit. They were in the woods now, and not far from Broad Brook. \"There's no need of hurrying,\" Tommy remarked. \"You can reach the brook quickly enough. It will be late in the afternoon before Mr. Turtle gets this far. I see you're a little out of breath. Why don't you lie down and rest? I'd take a nap, if I were you. And I'll wake you in time for you to win the race.\"  \"That's a good idea,\" Jimmy Rabbit said. \"I'll do it!\" And he lay down on the ground and went to sleep.  Late in the afternoon there were as many people at Broad Brook to see the finish of the race as there had been at the creek in the morning to watch the start.  \"I don't see where Jimmy can be,\" said Frisky Squirrel. \"His brothers are both here--and they can't run as fast as he can.\" But no one seemed to know what had become of Jimmy Rabbit.  \"I'm afraid he's going to lose his wheelbarrow,\" Tommy Fox finally said. \"If he loses the race, he'll have to give his wheelbarrow to Mr. Turtle, just as he promised.\" And Tommy didn't seem at all sorry at such a thought.  \"I hear some one coming!\" Billy Woodchuck cried a little later. He had very sharp ears.  \"And I can _see_ somebody!\" Fatty Coon exclaimed. _He_ had very sharp eyes.  And sure enough! Pretty soon they all saw Mr. Turtle waddle out of the woods and hurry toward them.  Tommy Fox began to dance and sing.  \"He's going to win! He's going to win!\" he said, over and over again.  And it certainly did look as if that was just what was going to happen.  Tommy drew a mark in the sand near the brook. \"As soon as he crosses this line, he'll win the race!\" he shouted.  The two Rabbit boys stepped across the line and waited.  \"Your brother is just as good as beaten,\" Tommy Fox told them. You see, he had never been near Jimmy Rabbit to wake him, as he had agreed. Of course, he had never intended to wake him.  Then Mr. Turtle crossed the line.  \"You've won!\" Tommy exclaimed. And he was so pleased that he gave Mr. Turtle a good, hard slap on the back. \"Ouch!\" Tommy said. There was a look of pain on his face. He had forgotten that Mr. Turtle had such a hard back.  \"Who's won?\" one of the Rabbit brothers asked.  \"Why, Mr. Turtle!\" said Tommy Fox.  \"That,\" said the Rabbit boy, \"that is just where you are mistaken, sir. Jimmy Rabbit has won the race--for _I_ am Jimmy Rabbit.\"  For a moment there was silence. And then a great shout went up. For they all saw that it was Jimmy Rabbit himself, dressed like one of his brothers."]]]
