This needs to be heated and water added each time it is used. This soil is put on pipes with a short stubby brush. The work when completed with the silvery joint and jet black borders appears to the uninitiated very artistic and neat, but when the black soil is worn away the uneven edges of the joint appear, disclosing the reason for using a black soil that covers all defects. The mechanic of today who takes pride in his ability for good workmanship will not cover his work with black soil.  It can readily be seen that the use of lampblack soil encourages poor workmanship, while the use of paste forces, to a certain extent, good workmanship on the part of the mechanic.  Before soil or paste is applied, the pipe needs to be cleansed. Grease and dirt accumulate on the pipe. The methods employed to remove all foreign matter are simply to scrape the surface with fine sand or emery paper; sand and water will also answer for this purpose. This cleans the surface and allows the soil or paste to stick to the pipe.   MAKING DIFFERENT SOLDER JOINTS  The tools used in making the different solder joints as described and illustrated in this chapter are shown in Fig. 14.  CUP JOINT.--The materials necessary for the work (Fig. 15): 12 inches of 1/2-inch AA lead pipe, paste, rosin, 1/2 and 1/2 solder.  If a gas furnace is not on the bench to heat the iron, then a gasoline furnace is necessary.  Each of the following operations must be done thoroughly to insure a perfect job:       _First_, with the SAW cut off 12 inches of 1/2-inch AA lead pipe      from the coil. When cutting off a piece of lead pipe from a coil or      reel, always straighten out 1 foot more than is needed. This leaves      1 foot of straight pipe always on the coil.       [Illustration: FIG. 14.--Tools used for making solder joints.]       _Second_, with the flat side of the RASP, square the ends of the      12-inch piece of pipe. (A good way to do this is to hold the pipe      at right angles with the edge of the bench, run the rasp across the      end of the pipe, keeping the rasp _parallel_ with the edge of the      bench. Apply this to all work when necessary to square the ends of      pipe.)       _Third_, cut the pipe with the saw, making two pieces each 6 inches      in length.       _Fourth_, square the ends just cut.       _Fifth_, rasp the edges of one end as shown in the cut. Hold the      work in such a way that the stroke of the rasp can be seen without      moving the pipe.       _Sixth_, take the other 6-inch piece of pipe and with the TURN PIN      spread one end of it. The turn pin must be struck squarely in the      center with the HAMMER, the point of the turn pin being kept in the      center of the pipe. The pipe should be turned after each blow of      the hammer. The pipe must not rest on the bench but should be held      in the hand while using the turn pin. If the pipe bends, it can be      straightened with BENDING IRONS. If the pipe is spread more on one      side than the other, the turn pin should be hit on the opposite      side so as to even the spread.       [Illustration: FIG. 15.]       _Seventh_, when the pipes are properly fitted, moisten the tips of      the fingers with paste and rub the paste on parts of pipe marked      \"paste.\" Put the pipe aside to allow the paste to dry.       _Eighth_, put the soldering iron on to heat.       _Ninth_, with the SHAVE HOOK scrape off the paste and surface dirt      as shown in the figure. The inside of the cup will look bright, but      must be scraped.       [Illustration: FIG. 16.--Cup joint.]       _Tenth_, place the two pieces into position as shown in Fig. 16,      sprinkle rosin on the joint, melt a few drops of solder on the      joint and with the iron melt the solder on the joint, drawing the      iron around the pipe keeping the solder melted around the iron all      the time.       _Eleventh_, fill the joint with solder and continue to draw the hot      iron around the joint until a smooth and bright surface is      obtained. To master the correct use of the soldering iron in this      work, considerable practice will be necessary.  OVERCAST JOINTS.--(Fig. 17.)       NOTE.--Each operation must be performed thoroughly.       _First_, saw off from a coil of 1-1/2-inch D lead pipe a 10-inch      piece of pipe.       _Second_, square the ends with the rasp, as previously explained.       _Third_, take a 1-1/2-inch DRIFT PLUG and drive through the pipe      (Fig. 18).       _Fourth_, saw the pipe into two pieces of 5 inches each.       _Fifth_, square the ends of the pipe with the rasp.       _Sixth_, rasp off the outside edge of one end of the pipe as shown.       _Seventh_, rasp off the inside edge of one end of the pipe.       _Eighth_, finish rasped surfaces with a file. Both surfaces should      have the same angle.       [Illustration: FIG. 17.]       [Illustration: FIG. 18.]       [Illustration: FIG. 19.--Overcast joint.]       _Ninth_, with a shave hook scrape the outside surface of each pipe      for about 1 inch from the end.       _Tenth_, put the soldering iron on to heat.       _Eleventh_, paste paper on the joint as shown in the cut.       _Twelfth_, fit the pieces together and lay on the bench. Drop some      melted solder on the joint and with the hot iron proceed to flow      the solder around the joint by turning the pipe. Use plenty of flux      (rosin). The pipes must be tacked in three or four places at first      or they will have a tendency to spread.       _Thirteenth_, to finish the joint, lift the iron straight up.  This joint when finished will have a bright smooth finish. The two foregoing joints need considerable practice and should be perfectly mastered before going on to the next job.   SEAMS  A description of the making of wiped seams for lead-lined tanks will not be attempted as very few are made now. The plumber, however, is often called upon to make a seam joining two pieces of sheet lead. The beginner will do well to go over the following exercise carefully and practice it thoroughly.  [Illustration: FIG. 20.--Flat seam.]  MATERIALS.--Two pieces of 8-pound sheet lead, 6 by 10 inches each; one bar of 1/2 and 1/2 solder; paste, paper, and rosin.  TOOLS.--Rasp, shave hook, and soldering iron.  The 10-inch side of each piece is rasped and fitted together. The edges are cleaned and paper is pasted on leaving 1/4 inch for solder. Paste without the paper can be put on. This will make a joint 1/2 inch wide.  Apply the rosin to the joint, then with the heated iron and some solder tack the seam on the top, then on the bottom and middle. This will prevent the seam from spreading when the lead is heated. Solder and rosin can now be put on the full length of the joint. With a hot iron proceed to float the solder down the seam. The soldering iron must not rest at full length on the pieces of lead or it will melt the lead and render the work useless. The solder will flow and form a clean neat seam, if the iron is at the right heat and the right amount of solder is put on. If the iron is too hot, the solder will flow instantly when the iron is laid on it and the solder will disappear as it runs through the seam. If the iron is too cold the solder will not melt enough to flow. Too much solder on the seam will cause it to overflow, that is, the solder will spread beyond the papered edges. After a little practice this surplus solder can be drawn in on the seam with the iron and carried along the seam to some point that has not enough solder. When the seam is completed the edges should be perfectly straight and even. The iron is carried along the seam with one stroke which makes the seam appear smooth and bright.     CHAPTER III  MIXTURES OF SOLDERS FOR SOLDERING IRON AND WIPING. CARE OF SOLDERS. MELTING POINTS OF METALS AND ALLOYS   The importance of good solder, that is, solder correctly mixed and thoroughly cleaned, should not be overlooked. Work is more quickly and neatly done and the job presents a more finished appearance when solder that is correctly made is used.  The solder used in the following work with the soldering iron is called 1/2 and 1/2. This means 1/2 (50 per cent.) lead and 1/2 (50 per cent.) tin.  In the mixture of solder, only pure metals should be used. The lead should be melted first and all the dross cleaned off. The tin should then be added and mixed.  The solder to be used in wiping the joints in the following chapter is a mixture of 37 per cent. tin and 63 per cent. lead. This is called wiping solder.  The following table gives the melting points, etc.:       ---------------+---------+------------------------------------------                     | Melting |           Metal     |  point  |      Mixture      ---------------+---------+------------------------------------------      Sulphur        |  228    | Pure      Tin            |  446    | Pure      Lead           |  626    | Pure      Zinc           |  680    | Pure      Fine solder    |  400    | 50 per cent. tin, 50 per cent. lead (wt.)      Wiping solder  |  370    | 37 per cent. tin, 63 per cent. lead (wt.)      ---------------+---------+------------------------------------------  To recognize fine solder, run off a bar into a mold and let it cool. If there is a frosted streak in the center, the metal has not enough tin. The surface should be bright. To recognize wiping solder, pour some on a brick. When this is cool, the top should be frosty and the under side should have four or five bright spots. The amount poured on the brick should be about the size of a half dollar. If poured on iron, the metal will cool too quickly and show bright all over the under side.  TO MAKE 1/2 AND 1/2 SOLDER OR PLUMBER'S FINE SOLDER.--The possibility of getting pure clean metals to mix solder is very remote. Old pieces of lead pipe, lead trap, old block tin pipe are used to make solder when pure metals are not at"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2527"],["title","The Sorrows of Young Werther (#1)"],["body","a well-covered table, or arrange an excursion or a dance opportunely, and so forth, all this produces a good effect upon my disposition; only I must forget that there lie dormant within me so many other qualities which moulder uselessly, and which I am obliged to keep carefully concealed. Ah! this thought affects my spirits fearfully. And yet to be misunderstood is the fate of the like of us.  Alas, that the friend of my youth is gone! Alas, that I ever knew her! I might say to myself, \"You are a dreamer to seek what is not to be found here below.\" But she has been mine. I have possessed that heart, that noble soul, in whose presence I seemed to be more than I really was, because I was all that I could be. Good heavens! did then a single power of my soul remain unexercised? In her presence could I not display, to its full extent, that mysterious feeling with which my heart embraces nature? Was not our intercourse a perpetual web of the finest emotions, of the keenest wit, the varieties of which, even in their very eccentricity, bore the stamp of genius? Alas! the few years by which she was my senior brought her to the grave before me. Never can I forget her firm mind or her heavenly patience.  A few days ago I met a certain young V--, a frank, open fellow, with a most pleasing countenance. He has just left the university, does not deem himself overwise, but believes he knows more than other people. He has worked hard, as I can perceive from many circumstances, and, in short, possesses a large stock of information. When he heard that I am drawing a good deal, and that I know Greek (two wonderful things for this part of the country), he came to see me, and displayed his whole store of learning, from Batteaux to Wood, from De Piles to Winkelmann: he assured me he had read through the first part of Sultzer's theory, and also possessed a manuscript of Heyne's work on the study of the antique. I allowed it all to pass.  I have become acquainted, also, with a very worthy person, the district judge, a frank and open-hearted man. I am told it is a most delightful thing to see him in the midst of his children, of whom he has nine. His eldest daughter especially is highly spoken of. He has invited me to go and see him, and I intend to do so on the first opportunity. He lives at one of the royal hunting-lodges, which can be reached from here in an hour and a half by walking, and which he obtained leave to inhabit after the loss of his wife, as it is so painful to him to reside in town and at the court.  There have also come in my way a few other originals of a questionable sort, who are in all respects undesirable, and most intolerable in their demonstration of friendship. Good-bye. This letter will please you: it is quite historical.  MAY 22.  That the life of man is but a dream, many a man has surmised heretofore; and I, too, am everywhere pursued by this feeling. When I consider the narrow limits within which our active and inquiring faculties are confined; when I see how all our energies are wasted in providing for mere necessities, which again have no further end than to prolong a wretched existence; and then that all our satisfaction concerning certain subjects of investigation ends in nothing better than a passive resignation, whilst we amuse ourselves painting our prison-walls with bright figures and brilliant landscapes,--when I consider all this, Wilhelm, I am silent. I examine my own being, and find there a world, but a world rather of imagination and dim desires, than of distinctness and living power. Then everything swims before my senses, and I smile and dream while pursuing my way through the world.  All learned professors and doctors are agreed that children do not comprehend the cause of their desires; but that the grown-up should wander about this earth like children, without knowing whence they come, or whither they go, influenced as little by fixed motives, but guided like them by biscuits, sugar-plums, and the rod,--this is what nobody is willing to acknowledge; and yet I think it is palpable.  I know what you will say in reply; for I am ready to admit that they are happiest, who, like children, amuse themselves with their playthings, dress and undress their dolls, and attentively watch the cupboard, where mamma has locked up her sweet things, and, when at last they get a delicious morsel, eat it greedily, and exclaim, \"More!\" These are certainly happy beings; but others also are objects of envy, who dignify their paltry employments, and sometimes even their passions, with pompous titles, representing them to mankind as gigantic achievements performed for their welfare and glory. But the man who humbly acknowledges the vanity of all this, who observes with what pleasure the thriving citizen converts his little garden into a paradise, and how patiently even the poor man pursues his weary way under his burden, and how all wish equally to behold the light of the sun a little longer,--yes, such a man is at peace, and creates his own world within himself; and he is also happy, because he is a man. And then, however limited his sphere, he still preserves in his bosom the sweet feeling of liberty, and knows that he can quit his prison whenever he likes.  MAY 26.  You know of old my ways of settling anywhere, of selecting a little cottage in some cosy spot, and of putting up in it with every inconvenience. Here, too, I have discovered such a snug, comfortable place, which possesses peculiar charms for me.  About a league from the town is a place called Walheim. (The reader need not take the trouble to look for the place thus designated. We have found it necessary to change the names given in the original.) It is delightfully situated on the side of a hill; and, by proceeding along one of the footpaths which lead out of the village, you can have a view of the whole valley. A good old woman lives there, who keeps a small inn. She sells wine, beer, and coffee, and is cheerful and pleasant notwithstanding her age. The chief charm of this spot consists in two linden-trees, spreading their enormous branches over the little green before the church, which is entirely surrounded by peasants' cottages, barns, and homesteads. I have seldom seen a place so retired and peaceable; and there often have my table and chair brought out from the little inn, and drink my coffee there, and read my Homer. Accident brought me to the spot one fine afternoon, and I found it perfectly deserted. Everybody was in the fields except a little boy about four years of age, who was sitting on the ground, and held between his knees a child about six months old: he pressed it to his bosom with both arms, which thus formed a sort of arm-chair; and, notwithstanding the liveliness which sparkled in its black eyes, it remained perfectly still. The sight charmed me. I sat down upon a plough opposite, and sketched with great delight this little picture of brotherly tenderness. I added the neighbouring hedge, the barn-door, and some broken cart-wheels, just as they happened to lie; and I found in about an hour that I had made a very correct and interesting drawing, without putting in the slightest thing of my own. This confirmed me in my resolution of adhering, for the future, entirely to nature. She alone is inexhaustible, and capable of forming the greatest masters. Much may be alleged in favour of rules, as much may be likewise advanced in favour of the laws of society: an artist formed upon them will never produce anything absolutely bad or disgusting; as a man who observes the laws, and obeys decorum, can never be an absolutely intolerable neighbour, nor a decided villain: but yet, say what you will of rules, they destroy the genuine feeling of nature, as well as its true expression. Do not tell me \"that this is too hard, that they only restrain and prune superfluous branches, etc.\" My good friend, I will illustrate this by an analogy. These things resemble love. A warmhearted youth becomes strongly attached to a maiden: he spends every hour of the day in her company, wears out his health, and lavishes his fortune, to afford continual proof that he is wholly devoted to her. Then comes a man of the world, a man of place and respectability, and addresses him thus: \"My good young friend, love is natural; but you must love within bounds. Divide your time: devote a portion to business, and give the hours of recreation to your mistress. Calculate your fortune; and out of the superfluity you may make her a present, only not too often,--on her birthday, and such occasions.\" Pursuing this advice, he may become a useful member of society, and I should advise every prince to give him an appointment; but it is all up with his love, and with his genius if he be an artist. O my friend! why is it that the torrent of genius so seldom bursts forth, so seldom rolls in full-flowing stream, overwhelming your astounded soul? Because, on either side of this stream, cold and respectable persons have taken up their abodes, and, forsooth, their summer-houses and tulip-beds would suffer from the torrent; wherefore they dig trenches, and raise embankments betimes, in order to avert the impending danger.  MAY 27.  I find I have fallen into raptures, declamation, and similes, and have forgotten, in consequence, to tell you what became of the children. Absorbed in my artistic contemplations, which I briefly described in my letter of yesterday, I continued sitting on the plough for two hours. Toward evening a young woman, with a basket on her arm, came running toward the children, who had not moved all that time. She exclaimed from a distance, \"You are a good boy, Philip!\" She gave me greeting: I returned it, rose, and approached her. I inquired if she were the mother of those pretty children. \"Yes,\" she said; and, giving the eldest a piece of bread, she took the little one in her arms and kissed it with a mother's tenderness. \"I left my child in Philip's care,\" she"]]]
