I can listen to these broadcasts tranquilly, but I cannot bear the thought of answering them. That seems to me madness!\"  Sergeant Bellews said approvingly:  \"You got something there! Yes, sir! Did you notice how Betsy's standby light was wabbling while she was bringin' in that broadcast? If she could sweat, she'd've been sweating!\"  Lecky turned his head to stare at the sergeant.  \"Machines,\" said Bellews profoundly, \"act according to the golden rule. They do unto you as they would have you do unto them. You treat a machine right and it treats you right. You treat it wrong and it busts itself--still tryin' to treat you right. See?\"  Lecky blinked.  \"I do not quite see how it applies,\" he said mildly.  \"Betsy's an old, experienced machine,\" said the sergeant. \"A signal that makes her sweat like that has got something wrong about it. Any ordinary machine 'ud break down handlin' it.\"  Graves said jerkily:  \"The other machines that received these broadcasts did break down, Sergeant. All of them.\"  \"Sure!\" said the sergeant with dignity. \"O' course, who's broadcastin' may have been tinkerin' with their signal since they seen it wasn't gettin' through. Betsy can take it now, when younger machines with less experience can't. Maybe a micro-microwatt of signal. Then it makes her sweat. If she was broadcastin', with a hell of a lot more'n a micro-microwatt--it'd be bad! I bet you that every machine we make to broadcast breaks down! I bet--\"  Howell said curtly:  \"Reasonable enough! A signal to pass through time as well as space would be different from a standard wave-type! Of course that must be the answer.\"  Sergeant Bellews said truculently:  \"I got a hunch that whoever's broadcastin' is busting transmitters right an' left. I never knew anything about this before, except that Betsy was pickin' up stuff that came from nowhere. But I bet if you look over the record-tapes you will find they got breaks where one transmitter switched off or broke down and another took over!\"  Lecky's eyes were shining. He regarded Sergeant Bellews with a sort of tender respect.  \"Sergeant Bellews,\" he said softly, \"I like you very much. You have told us undoubtedly true things.\"  \"Think nothin' of it,\" said the sergeant, gratified. \"I run the Rehab Shop here, and I could show you things--\"  \"We wish you to,\" said Lecky. \"The reaction of machines to these broadcasts is the one viewpoint we would never have imagined. But it is plainly important. Will you help us, Sergeant? I do not like to be frightened--and I am!\"  \"Sure, I'll help,\" said Sergeant Bellews largely. \"First thing is to whip some stuff together so we can find out what's what. You take a few Mahon units, and install 'em and train 'em right, and they will do almost anything you've a mind for. But you got to treat 'em right. Machines work by the golden rule. Always! Come along!\"         *       *       *       *       *  Sergeant Bellews went to the Rehab Shop, followed only by Lecky. All about, the sun shone down upon buildings with a remarkably temporary look about them, and on lawns with a remarkably lush look about them, and signboards with very black lettering on gray paint backgrounds. There was a very small airfield inside the barbed-wire fence about the post, and elaborate machine-shops, and rows and rows of barracks and a canteen and a USO theatre, and a post post-office. Everything seemed quite matter-of-fact.  Except for the machines.  They were the real reason for the existence of the post. The barracks and married-row dwellings had washing-machines which looked very much like other washing-machines, except that they had standby lights which flickered meditatively when they weren't being used.         *       *       *       *       *  The television receivers looked like other TV sets, except for minute and wavering standby lights which were never quite as bright or dim one moment as the next. The jeeps--used strictly within the barbed-wire fence around the post--had similar yellow glowings on their instrument-boards, and they were very remarkable jeeps. They never ran off the graveled roads onto the grass, and they never collided with each other, and it was said that the nine-year-old son of a lieutenant-colonel had tried to drive one and it would not stir. Its motor cut off when he forced it into gear. When he tried to re-start it, the starter did not turn. But when an adult stepped into it, it operated perfectly--only it braked and stopped itself when a small child toddled into its path.  There were some people who said that this story was not true, but other people insisted that it was. Anyhow the washing-machines were perfect. They never tangled clothes put into them. It was reported that Mrs. So-and-so's washing-machine had found a load of clothes tangled, and reversed itself and worked backward until they were straightened out.  Television sets turned to the proper channels--different ones at different times of day--with incredible facility. The smallest child could wrench at a tuning-knob and the desired station came on. All the operating devices of Research Installation 83 worked as if they liked to--which might have been alarming except that they never did anything of themselves. They initiated nothing. But each one acted like an old, favorite possession. They fitted their masters. They seemed to tune themselves to the habits of their owners. They were infinitely easy to work right, and practically impossible to work wrong.  Such machines, of course, had not been designed to cope with enigmatic broadcasts or for military purposes. But the jet-planes on the small airfield were very remarkable indeed, and the other and lesser devices had been made for better understanding of the Mahon units which made machines into practically a new order of creation.         *       *       *       *       *  Sergeant Bellews ushered Lecky into the Rehab Shop. There was the pleasant, disorderly array of devices with their wavering standby lights. They gave an effect of being alive, but somehow it was not disturbing. They seemed not so much intent as meditative, and not so much watchful as interested. When the sergeant and his guest moved past them, the unrhythmic waverings of the small yellow lights seemed to change hopefully, as if the machines anticipated being put to use. Which, of course, was absurd. Mahon machines do not anticipate anything. They probably do not remember anything, though patterns of operation are certainly retained in very great variety. The fact is that a Mahon unit is simply a device to let a machine stand idle without losing the nature of an operating machine.  The basic principle goes back to antiquity. Ships, in ancient days, had manners and customs individual to each vessel. Some were sweet craft, easily handled and staunch and responsive. Others were stubborn and begrudging of all helpfulness. Sometimes they were even man-killers. These facts had no rational explanation, but they were facts. In similarly olden times, particular weapons acquired personalities to the point of having personal names--Excalibur, for example.  Every fighting man knew of weapons which seemed to possess personal skill and ferocity. Later, workmen found that certain tools had a knack of fitting smoothly in the hand--seeming even to divine the grain of the wood they worked on. The individual characteristics of violins were notorious, so that a violin which sang joyously under the bow was literally priceless.  And all these things, as a matter of observation and not of superstition, kept their qualities only when in constant use. Let a ship be hauled out of water and remain there for a time, and she would be clumsy on return to her native element. Let a sword or tool stay unused, and it seemed to dull. In particular, the finest of violins lost its splendor of tone if left unplayed, and any violin left in a repair-shop for a month had to be played upon constantly for many days before its living tone came back.         *       *       *       *       *  The sword and the tool perhaps, but the ship and the violin certainly, acted as if they acquired habits of operation by being used, and lost them by disuse. When more complex machines were invented, such facts were less noticeable. True, no two automobiles ever handled exactly the same, and that was recognized. But the fact that no complex machine worked well until it had run for a time was never commented on, except in the observation that it needed to be warmed up. Anybody would have admitted that a machine in the act of operating was a dynamic system in a solid group of objects, but nobody reflected that a stopped machine was a dead thing. Nobody thought to liken the warming-up period for an aeroplane engine to the days of playing before a disuse-dulled violin regained its tone.  Yet it was obvious enough. A ship and a sword and a tool and a violin were objects in which dynamic systems existed when they were used, and in which they ceased to exist when use stopped. And nobody noticed that a living creature is an object which contains a dynamic system when it is living, and loses it by death.  For nearly two centuries quite complex machines were started, and warmed up, and used, and then allowed to grow cold again. In time the more complex machines were stopped only reluctantly. Computers, for example, came to be merely turned down below operating voltage when not in use, because warming them up was so difficult and exacting a task. Which was an unrecognized use of the Mahon principle. It was a way to keep a machine activated while not actually operating. It was a state of rest, of loafing, of idleness, which was not the death of a running mechanism.  The Mahon unit was a logical development. It was an absurdly simple device, and not in the least like a brain.

We want you to take charge of the house, and see to it that the boat is kept shipshape.\"  \"Where is the house?\" queried the astonished boatman.  \"This is it,\" said Sir Walter.  \"This is the house, and the boat too.  In fact, it is a house-boat.\"  \"Then it isn't a new-fangled scheme to drive me out of business?\" said Charon, warily.  \"Not at all,\" returned Sir Walter.  \"It's a new-fangled scheme to set you up in business.  We'll pay you a large salary, and there won't be much to do.  You are the best man for the place, because, while you don't know much about houses, you do know a great deal about boats, and the boat part is the most important part of a house-boat.  If the boat sinks, you can't save the house; but if the house burns, you may be able to save the boat.  See?\"  \"I think I do, sir,\" said Charon.  \"Another reason why we want to employ you for Janitor,\" said Confucius, \"is that our club wants to be in direct communication with both sides of the Styx; and we think you as Janitor would be able to make better arrangements for transportation with yourself as boatman, than some other man as Janitor could make with you.\"  \"Spoken like a sage,\" said Demosthenes.  \"Furthermore,\" said Cassius, \"occasionally we shall want to have this boat towed up or down the river, according to the house committee's pleasure, and we think it would be well to have a Janitor who has some influence with the towing company which you represent.\"  \"Can't this boat be moved without towing?\" asked Charon.  \"No,\" said Cassius.  \"And I'm the only man who can tow it, eh?\"  \"You are,\" said Blackstone.  \"Worse luck.\"  \"And you want me to be Janitor on a salary of what?\"  \"A hundred oboli a month,\" said Sir Walter, uneasily.  \"Very well, gentlemen,\" said Charon.  \"I'll accept the office on a salary of two hundred oboli a month, with Saturdays off.\"  The committee went into executive session for five minutes, and on their return informed Charon that in behalf of the Associated Shades they accepted his offer.  \"In behalf of what?\" the old man asked.  \"The Associated Shades,\" said Sir Walter.  \"The swellest organization in Hades, whose new house-boat you are now on board of.  When shall you be ready to begin work?\"  \"Right away,\" said Charon, noting by the clock that it was the hour of midnight.  \"I'll start in right away, and as it is now Saturday morning, I'll begin by taking my day off.\"     CHAPTER II: A DISPUTED AUTHORSHIP   \"How are you, Charon?\" said Shakespeare, as the Janitor assisted him on board.  \"Any one here to-night?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" said Charon.  \"Lord Bacon is up in the library, and Doctor Johnson is down in the billiard-room, playing pool with Nero.\"  \"Ha-ha!\" laughed Shakespeare.  \"Pool, eh?  Does Nero play pool?\"  \"Not as well as he does the fiddle, sir,\" said the Janitor, with a twinkle in his eye.  Shakespeare entered the house and tossed up an obolus.  \"Heads--Bacon; tails--pool with Nero and Johnson,\" he said.  The coin came down with heads up, and Shakespeare went into the pool-room, just to show the Fates that he didn't care a tuppence for their verdict as registered through the obolus.  It was a peculiar custom of Shakespeare's to toss up a coin to decide questions of little consequence, and then do the thing the coin decided he should not do.  It showed, in Shakespeare's estimation, his entire independence of those dull persons who supposed that in them was centred the destiny of all mankind.  The Fates, however, only smiled at these little acts of rebellion, and it was common gossip in Erebus that one of the trio had told the Furies that they had observed Shakespeare's tendency to kick over the traces, and always acted accordingly.  They never let the coin fall so as to decide a question the way they wanted it, so that unwittingly the great dramatist did their will after all.  It was a part of their plan that upon this occasion Shakespeare should play pool with Doctor Johnson and the Emperor Nero, and hence it was that the coin bade him repair to the library and chat with Lord Bacon.  \"Hullo, William,\" said the Doctor, pocketing three balls on the break. \"How's our little Swanlet of Avon this afternoon?\"  \"Worn out,\" Shakespeare replied.  \"I've been hard at work on a play this morning, and I'm tired.\"  \"All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy,\" said Nero, grinning broadly.  \"You are a bright spirit,\" said Shakespeare, with a sigh.  \"I wish I had thought to work you up into a tragedy.\"  \"I've often wondered why you didn't,\" said Doctor Johnson.  \"He'd have made a superb tragedy, Nero would.  I don't believe there was any kind of a crime he left uncommitted.  Was there, Emperor?\"  \"Yes.  I never wrote an English dictionary,\" returned the Emperor, dryly. \"I've murdered everything but English, though.\"  \"I could have made a fine tragedy out of you,\" said Shakespeare.  \"Just think what a dreadful climax for a tragedy it would be, Johnson, to have Nero, as the curtain fell, playing a violin solo.\"  \"Pretty good,\" returned the Doctor.  \"But what's the use of killing off your audience that way?  It's better business to let 'em live, I say. Suppose Nero gave a London audience that little musicale he provided at Queen Elizabeth's Wednesday night.  How many purely mortal beings, do you think, would have come out alive?\"  \"Not one,\" said Shakespeare.  \"I was mighty glad that night that we were an immortal band.  If it had been possible to kill us we'd have died then and there.\"  \"That's all right,\" said Nero, with a significant shake of his head.  \"As my friend Bacon makes Ingo say, 'Beware, my lord, of jealousy.'  You never could play a garden hose, much less a fiddle.\"  \"What do you mean my attributing those words to Bacon?\" demanded Shakespeare, getting red in the face.  \"Oh, come now, William,\" remonstrated Nero.  \"It's all right to pull the wool over the eyes of the mortals.  That's what they're there for; but as for us--we're all in the secret here.  What's the use of putting on nonsense with us?\"  \"We'll see in a minute what the use is,\" retorted the Avonian.  \"We'll have Bacon down here.\"  Here he touched an electric button, and Charon came in answer.  \"Charon, bring Doctor Johnson the usual glass of ale.  Get some ice for the Emperor, and ask Lord Bacon to step down here a minute.\"  \"I don't want any ice,\" said Nero.  \"Not now,\" retorted Shakespeare, \"but you will in a few minutes.  When we have finished with you, you'll want an iceberg.  I'm getting tired of this idiotic talk about not having written my own works.  There's one thing about Nero's music that I've never said, because I haven't wanted to hurt his feelings, but since he has chosen to cast aspersions upon my honesty I haven't any hesitation in saying it now.  I believe it was one of his fiddlings that sent Nature into convulsions and caused the destruction of Pompeii--so there!  Put that on your music rack and fiddle it, my little Emperor.\"  Nero's face grew purple with anger, and if Shakespeare had been anything but a shade he would have fared ill, for the enraged Roman, poising his cue on high as though it were a lance, hurled it at the impertinent dramatist with all his strength, and with such accuracy of aim withal that it pierced the spot beneath which in life the heart of Shakespeare used to beat.  \"Good shot,\" said Doctor Johnson, nonchalantly.  \"If you had been a mortal, William, it would have been the end of you.\"  \"You can't kill me,\" said Shakespeare, shrugging his shoulders.  \"I know seven dozen actors in the United States who are trying to do it, but they can't.  I wish they'd try to kill a critic once in a while instead of me, though,\" he added.  \"I went over to Boston one night last week, and, unknown to anybody, I waylaid a fellow who was to play Hamlet that night. I drugged him, and went to the theatre and played the part myself.  It was the coldest house you ever saw in your life.  When the audience did applaud, it sounded like an ice-man chopping up ice with a small pick. Several times I looked up at the galleries to see if there were not icicles growing on them, it was so cold.  Well, I did the best could with the part, and next morning watched curiously for the criticisms.\"  \"Favorable?\" asked the Doctor.  \"They all dismissed me with a line,\" said the dramatist.  \"Said my conception of the part was not Shakespearian.  And that's criticism!\"  \"No,\" said the shade of Emerson, which had strolled in while Shakespeare was talking, \"that isn't criticism; that's Boston.\"  \"Who discovered Boston, anyhow?\" asked Doctor Johnson.  \"It wasn't Columbus, was it?\"  \"Oh no,\" said Emerson.  \"Old Governor Winthrop is to blame for that.  When he settled at Charlestown he saw the old Indian town of Shawmut across the Charles.\"  \"And Shawmut was the Boston microbe, was it?\" asked Johnson.  \"Yes,\" said Emerson.  \"Spelt with a P, I suppose?\" said Shakespeare.  \"P-S-H-A-W, Pshaw, M-U-T, mut, Pshawmut, so called because the inhabitants are always muttering pshaw.  Eh?\"  \"Pretty good,\" said Johnson.  \"I wish I'd said that.\"  \"Well, tell Boswell,\" said Shakespeare.  \"He'll make you say it, and it'll be all the same in a hundred years.\"  Lord Bacon, accompanied by Charon and the ice for Nero and the ale for Doctor Johnson, appeared as Shakespeare spoke.  The philosopher bowed stiffly at Doctor Johnson, as though he hardly approved of him, extended his left hand to Shakespeare, and stared coldly at Nero.  \"Did you send for me, William?\" he asked, languidly.  \"I did,\" said Shakespeare.  \"I sent for you because this imperial violinist here says that you wrote _Othello_.\"  \"What nonsense,\" said Bacon.  \"The only plays of yours I wrote were _Ham_--\"  \"Sh!\" said Shakespeare, shaking his head madly.  \"Hush.  Nobody's said anything about that.  This is purely a discussion of _Othello_.\"  \"The fiddling ex-Emperor Nero,\" said Bacon, loudly enough to be heard all about the room, \"is mistaken when he attributes "]]]
