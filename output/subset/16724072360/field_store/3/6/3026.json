There's a wrong time and a right time for everything, you know.\"  \"Just as there is for planting corn,\" Mr. Frog chimed in.  \"Exactly!\" Mr. Crow returned.  \"And for eating it!\" Mr. Frog added.  But old Mr. Crow only said hastily that he would be at the barn by the time Ferdinand reached it. And without another word he flapped himself away across the field.  \"He's a queer one,\" said Ferdinand Frog to himself. \"It seems as if a person couldn't please him, no matter how much a person tried.\" Then he untied his necktie, and tied it again, because he thought one end of the bow was longer than the other; and that was something he couldn't endure.  Then he resumed his jumping. And after exactly one hundred and thirty-two jumps he reached a corner of Farmer Green's great barn, where he found old Mr. Crow waiting for him.  \"Still smiling, I see,\" the old gentleman observed gruffly. \"Maybe you'll laugh out of the other corner of your mouth after you've seen the pretty picture that you look like.\"  \"I hope so! Where is it?\" Ferdinand Frog asked him eagerly. \"Show me the pretty one!\"  \"Come with me!\" said old Mr. Crow. And he led the way around the barn, stopping before the side that faced the road.  \"There!\" he cried. \"It's in the upper left-hand corner, just as I told you.\" And he chuckled as loud as he dared--with Farmer Green inside the building, milking the cows.  As Ferdinand Frog gazed upward a shadow of disappointment came over his face. And for once he did not smile.  \"Do I look like that?\" he faltered.  \"You certainly do,\" old Mr. Crow assured him. \"See those eyes--don't they bulge just like yours? And look at that mouth! It's fully as wide as yours--and maybe a trifle wider!\"  \"The face does look a bit like mine, I'll admit,\" Ferdinand Frog muttered. \"But no one could ever mistake one of us for the other. . . . What's the name of this creature?\"  \"It's called the _hippopotamus_,\" old Mr. Crow replied. \"I heard Johnnie Green say so. And he ought to know, if anyone does.\"     IV  MR. CROW LOSES SOMETHING   The picture of the hippopotamus on Farmer Green's barn did not please Ferdinand Frog. But in a few moments he began to smile again.  \"You've made a mistake,\" he told old Mr. Crow with a snicker. \"When Aunt Polly Woodchuck said I was as pretty as a picture she never could have had this one in mind.\"  \"Why not?\" Mr. Crow inquired. \"The eyes and the mouth----\"  \"Yes! Yes--I know!\" Ferdinand interrupted. \"But this creature has a tail! And tails are terribly out of fashion. I haven't worn one since I was a tadpole.\"  That was enough for old Mr. Crow. _He_ had a tail----or tail feathers, at least. And he at once flew into a terrible rage.  \"You've insulted me!\" he shouted.  Ferdinand Frog knew then that he had blundered. So he hastened to mend matters.  \"There, there!\" he said in a soothing tone. \"Having a tail is not so bad, after all; for you can always cut it off, if you want to be in style.\" And he was surprised to find that his remark only made Mr. Crow angrier than ever.  [Illustration: Old Mr. Crow Plays a Joke on Mr. Frog]  \"Cut off my tail, indeed!\" the old gentleman snorted. \"I'd be a pretty sight, if I did. Why, I wouldn't part with a single tail-feather, on any account.\" He continued to scold Ferdinand Frog at the top of his lungs, telling him that he was a silly fellow, and that nobody--unless it was a few foolish young creatures--thought he was the least bit handsome.  Now, old Mr. Crow was in such a temper that he forgot that Farmer Green was inside the barn. And he made so much noise that Farmer Green heard him and peeped around the corner of the barn to see what was going on.  A moment later the old shot-gun went off with a terrific roar. Ferdinand Frog saw Mr. Crow spring up and go tearing off towards the woods. And a long, black tail-feather floated slowly down out of the air and settled on the ground near the place where Mr. Crow had been standing.  After shaking his fist in Mr. Crow's direction, Farmer Green disappeared.  \"That's a pity,\" Mr. Frog thought. \"Mr. Crow has parted with one of his tail-feathers. And I must find him as soon as I can and tell him how sorry I am.\"  Then Mr. Frog turned to look at the other pictures, which covered the whole side of the big barn. He beheld many strange creatures--some with necks of enormous length, some with humps on their backs, and all of them of amazing colors.  But whether they were ringed, streaked or striped, not one of them was--in Mr. Frog's opinion--one-half as beautiful as the hippopotamus.  \"Even he----\" Mr. Frog decided----\"even he couldn't be called half as handsome as I am. For once old Mr. Crow certainly was mistaken.\"  And he began to laugh. And while he was laughing, Farmer Green came out of the barn with a pail of milk in each hand.  Then Ferdinand Frog had a happy thought. Why not ask Farmer Green to shoot off the tail of the hippopotamus? The loss of that ugly tail would improve the creature's looks, and make him appear still more like Mr. Frog himself.  At least, that was Mr. Frog's own opinion.  And he called to Farmer Green and suggested to him that he step out behind the barn and take a shot at the tail of the hippopotamus.  \"Try your luck!\" Mr. Frog coaxed. \"It's plain to see that you need practice, or you'd have made Mr. Crow part with all his tail-feathers, instead of only one.\" And he laughed harder than ever.  But Farmer Green paid little heed to Ferdinand Frog's wheedling, although he did smile and say:  \"I declare, I believe that bull frog's jeering at me because I missed the old crow!\"     V  MR. FROG'S SECRET SORROW   Ferdinand Frog always looked so cheerful that no one ever suspected that he had a secret sorrow. But it is true, nevertheless, that something troubled him, though he took great pains not to let a single one of his neighbors know that anything grieved him.  His trouble was simply this: he had never been invited to attend the singing-parties which the Frog family held almost every evening in Cedar Swamp.  Now, Ferdinand Frog loved to sing at night.  Indeed, he liked nothing better than to go to the lake not far from the Beaver dam and practice his songs among the lily pads near the shore. He had a deep, powerful bass voice, which one could hear a mile or more across the water on a still evening.  Often he dressed himself with the greatest care and went to the lake alone, where he stayed half the night and sang so loudly that a good many of the wild folk who lived in the neighborhood thought him a great nuisance. Not caring for music, they objected to being forced to listen to Ferdinand Frog's favorite songs.  \"Why don't you go over to Cedar Swamp, if you want to make a noise?\" one of the Beaver family who was known as Tired Tim asked Mr. Frog one evening. \"You have come here for nine nights running; and your racket has upset me so that I haven't done a stroke of work in all this time.\"  Mr. Frog had puffed himself up and had just opened his mouth to begin a new song. But upon being spoken to so rudely he closed his mouth quickly and swallowed several times. For just a second or two he was speechless, he was so surprised. And then presently he began to giggle.  \"I believe you,\" he said. \"I believe that you haven't done a stroke of work for ninety nights.\" He knew--as did everybody else--that Tired Tim was the laziest person for miles around.  \"I said nine--not ninety,\" Tired Tim corrected him.  \"Oh! My mistake!\" Mr. Frog replied.  \"You haven't answered my question,\" Tired Tim reminded him with a wide yawn. \"I asked you why you didn't attend the singing-parties over in Cedar Swamp. You could croak your head off there and no one would stop you.\"  But Mr. Frog shook his head. And at the same time, he sighed.  \"No!\" he said. \"I'd rather sing here on the border of the lake. The trouble is, _I sing too well_ for those fellows over in Cedar Swamp.\"  \"Why don't you join them and teach them how to sing, if you know so much about it?\" Tired Tim persisted.  \"Oh, I've no time for that,\" Ferdinand Frog answered.  And then it was his companion's turn to snicker.  \"You appear to have plenty of time to waste here,\" he observed. \"It's my opinion that there's just one reason why you don't go to the Cedar Swamp singing parties.\"  \"What's that?\" Mr. Frog inquired with a slight trace of uneasiness.  \"They haven't invited you.\"  \"How did you guess that?\" Ferdinand Frog asked him.  He wished, the next moment, that he had not put that question to Tired Tim. For he saw at once that he had given his sad secret away.     VI  TIRED TIM DOES A FAVOR   In spite of all Ferdinand Frog's teasing, Tired Tim Beaver refused to explain how he happened to know Mr. Frog's secret.  To tell the truth, he had _guessed_ the reason why Mr. Frog did not attend the Cedar Swamp singing-parties. But he hoped that Ferdinand Frog would think that some of the musical Frog family had been talking to him. And he even hinted to Mr. Frog that maybe it would be possible to get him an invitation to the singing-parties.  \"Do you think you could do that?\" Ferdinand Frog asked him with, great eagerness.  \"I _might_ be able to; but it wouldn't be an easy matter,\" Tired Tim replied. \"And I'd expect you to do something for me, if I went to so much trouble on your account.\"  \"I'll do _anything_ for you, in return for an invitation to the Cedar Swamp singing-parties,\" Ferdinand Frog declared.  \"Very well!\" Tired Tim told him. \"I'll go right over to the swamp now. And when I tell 'em a few things, I know they'll want you to join 'em.\"  Ferdinand Frog felt so gay that he stood on his head and waved his feet in the air.  \"Let's meet here to-morrow night,\" he suggested.  But Tired Tim objected to that plan.  \"You would be hanging about this place--and singing--for four-and-twenty hours,\" he grumbled. \"It will be a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24590"],["title","The Tale of Ferdinand Frog (#2)"],["body","deal better if we meet on the edge of the swamp.\"  \"Just as you wish!\" Ferdinand Frog exclaimed. \"And since you're going to Cedar Swamp, I'll hop along with you, to keep you company.\"  \"You forget----\" said Tired Tim Beaver----\"you forget that you haven't been invited yet.\"  \"Have you?\" Mr. Frog inquired.  \"Certainly!\" said Tired Tim. And grinning over his shoulder, he swam away.  Mr. Frog watched his friend from the shore.  \"He can't fool me,\" he muttered. \"Tired Tim _invited himself_. And I've been stupid not to do likewise.\"  On the following night Ferdinand Frog went to the edge of Cedar Swamp, where he waited somewhat impatiently on a log until Tired Tim Beaver joined him.  \"Well!\" Mr. Frog cried. \"I'm glad to see you and I hope you've brought my invitation.\"  But Tired Tim wouldn't say yes or no.  \"If I succeed in getting you into the Cedar Swamp singing-parties will you promise me that you won't sing any more around the lake, or near our pond, either?\" he demanded.  Ferdinand Frog gave his solemn promise.  \"Very well, then!\" Tired Tim said. \"Go along over to the swamp. They're expecting you.\"  When he heard the good news Ferdinand Frog was so delighted that he leaped into the air and kicked his heels together.  And then forgetting his solemn promise, he began to bellow at the top of his voice:          \"To Cedar Swamp I'll haste away;            Though first I'll sing a song.          My voice I must not waste to-day,            So I'll not keep you long.          I simply want to let you know            I'm much obliged, before I go.\"  \"Don't mention it!\" said Tired Tim.  \"Don't interrupt me, please!\" said Ferdinand Frog. \"I haven't finished thanking you yet. That's only the first verse.\"  \"How many more are there?\" Tired Tim inquired with a yawn.  \"Ninety-nine!\" Mr. Frog answered. And he was somewhat surprised--and puzzled--when Tired Tim left him suddenly and plunged into the underbrush.     VII  THE SINGING-PARTY   Ferdinand Frog lost no time, after Tired Tim left him. He jumped into the swamp and made straight towards the very middle of it, whence he could already hear the chorus of the numerous Frog family; for the singing-party had begun.  Mr. Frog made all haste, not wishing to miss any more of the fun. Now swimming, now leaping from one hummock to another--or sometimes to an old stump--he quickly reached the place where the Frog family were enjoying themselves.  \"Here he is!\" several of the singers exclaimed as soon as Ferdinand Frog's head popped out of the water, in their midst.  He saw at once that they had been expecting him; and he smiled and bowed--and waited for the company to stop singing and give him a warm greeting with their cold, damp hands. But except for those first few words, no one paid the slightest attention to the newcomer.  In fact, nobody even took the trouble to nod to Ferdinand Frog--much less to shake hands with him and tell him that he was welcome.  Meanwhile one song followed another with hardly a pause between them. And Mr. Frog found that he did not know the words of even one.  He was so impatient that at last he climbed upon an old fallen tree-trunk, which stuck out of the greenish-black water, and began to roar his favorite song, while he beat time for the other singers. The name of that song was \"A Frog on a Log in a Bog\"; and Ferdinand Frog thought that he couldn't have chosen another so fitting.  But the rest of the singing-party had other ideas. They turned about and scowled at Mr. Frog as if he had done something most unpleasant.  \"Stop! Stop!\" several of them cried. And an important-looking fellow near him shouted, \"Don't sing that, for pity's sake!\"  \"Why not?\" Ferdinand Frog faltered. \"What's the matter with my song? It's my special favorite, which I sing at least fifty times each night, regularly.\"  \"It's old stuff,\" the other told him with a sneer. \"We haven't sung that for a year, at least.\"  Ferdinand Frog did not try to argue with him. But as soon as he saw another chance he began a different ditty.  Then a loud groan arose. And somebody stopped him again. And Mr. Frog soon learned that they hadn't sung that one for a year and a half.  Though he tried again and again, he had no better luck. But he kept smiling bravely. And finally he asked the company in a loud voice if he \"wasn't going to have a chance.\"  \"Certainly!\" a number of the singers assured him. \"Your chance is coming later. We shan't forget you.\"  And that made Ferdinand Frog feel better. He told himself that he could wait patiently for a time--if it wasn't too long.     VIII  THE MISSING SUPPER   Ferdinand Frog had begun to feel uneasy again. He was afraid that the singers had forgotten their promise to him. But at last they suddenly started a rousing song which made him take heart again.  They roared out the chorus in a joyful way which left no doubt in his mind that his chance was at hand:          \"Now that the concert is ended            We'll sit at the banquet and feast.          Now that the singing's suspended            We'll dine till it's gray in the east.\"  Mr. Frog only hoped that the company did not expect him to sing to them _all_ the time while they were banqueting.  \"They needn't think--\" he murmured under his breath--\"they needn't think I don't like good things to eat as well as they do.\" But he let no one see that he was worried. That was Ferdinand Frog's way: almost always he managed to smile, no matter how things went.  When the last echoes of the song had died away a great hubbub arose. Everybody crowded around Mr. Frog. And there were cries of \"Now! Now!\"  He thought, of course, that they wanted to hear him sing. So he started once more to sing his favorite song. But they stopped him quickly.  \"We've finished the songs for to-night,\" they told him. \"We're ready for the supper now. . . . Where is it?\"  \"Supper?\" Mr. Frog faltered, as his jaw dropped. \"What supper?\"  \"The supper you're going to give us!\" the whole company shouted. \"You know--don't you?--that we have just made a rule for new members: they're to furnish a banquet.\"  Ferdinand Frog's eyes seemed to bulge further out of his head than ever.  \"I--I never heard of this before!\" he stammered.  \"Didn't Tired Tim tell you about our new rule?\" somebody inquired. \"It was his own idea.\"  \"He never said a word to me about it!\" Ferdinand Frog declared with a loud laugh. \"And I can't give you a supper, for I haven't one ready.\"  \"Then we'll postpone it until to-morrow night,\" the company told him hopefully.  \"What does your rule say?\" Ferdinand Frog rolled his eyes as he put the question to them.  \"It says that the banquet must take place the first night the new member is present,\" a fat gentleman replied.  \"Then I can't give you any food to-morrow night,\" Mr. Frog informed them, \"because it would be against the rule.\"  \"Then you can't be a member!\" a hundred voices croaked.  \"I _am_ one now,\" Ferdinand Frog replied happily. \"And what's more, I don't see how you can keep me out of your singing-parties.\"  There was silence for a time.  \"We've been sold,\" some one said at last. \"We've no rule to prevent this fellow from coming here. And the worst of it is, as everybody knows, his voice is so loud it will spoil all our songs.\"  Oddly enough, the speaker was the very one who had always objected to inviting Ferdinand Frog to join the singing parties. His own voice had always been the loudest in the whole company. And naturally he did not want anybody with a louder one to come and drown his best notes.  But now he couldn't help himself. And thereafter when the singers met in Cedar Swamp he always turned greener in the face than ever and looked as if he were about to burst, when Ferdinand Frog opened his mouth its widest and let his voice rumble forth into the night.     IX  THE MYSTERIOUS STRANGER   When Ferdinand Frog first came to the Beaver pond to live no one knew anything about him.  He appeared suddenly--no one knew whence--and at once made himself very much at home. It was no time at all before he could call every one of the big Beaver family by name. And he acted exactly as if the pond belonged to him, instead of to the Beavers, whose great-grandfathers had dammed the stream many years before.  But the newcomer was so polite that nobody cared to send him away. At the same time, people couldn't help wondering who the stranger was and where he had come from and what his plans for the future were. Whenever two or three Beavers stopped working long enough to enjoy a pleasant chat, they were sure to talk of the mysterious Mr. Frog and tell one another what they thought of him. Many were the tales told about the nimble fellow.  Some said that he had moved all the way from Farmer Green's duck pond, because Johnnie Green had tried to catch him; while others declared that Ferdinand Frog was a famous singer, who had come to that quiet spot in order to rest his voice, which had become harsh from too much use. Indeed, there were so many stories about the stranger that it was hard to know which to believe--especially after old Mr. Crow informed Brownie Beaver that in his opinion Ferdinand Frog was a slippery fellow. \"I shouldn't be surprised----\" Mr. Crow had said with a wise wag of his head----\"I shouldn't be surprised if his real name was Ferdinand Fraud.\"  Anyhow, there was one thing that almost all the Beaver colony agreed upon. They were of one opinion as to Mr. Frog's clothes, which they thought must be very fashionable, because they were like no others that had ever been seen before in those parts.  There was one young gentleman, however--the beau of the village--who disputed everybody, saying that he believed that Ferdinand Frog must be wearing old clothes that were many years behind the times.  Now, there was one lazy Beaver known as Tired Tim who had nothing better to do than to go straight to Mr. Frog and repeat what he heard.  To Tired Tim's surprise--for he had expected Mr. Frog to lose his temper--to his"]]]
