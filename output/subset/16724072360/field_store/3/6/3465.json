Within the space of a hundred yards were lying five dead antelopes, of a species Willem had never seen before.  Feeding on the carcasses were several hyenas.  On the approach of the hunters, they slowly moved away, each laughing like a madman who has just committed some horrible atrocity.  By the \"spoors\" seen upon the river-banks, it was evident that both elephants and lions had visited the place during the night.  While making these and other reconnoissances, Groot Willem was joined by Hans, who had already commenced his favourite study by making an examination of the floral treasures in his immediate locality.  Arriving up with Groot Willem, the attention of Hans was at once directed to an examination of the antelopes, which he pronounced to be elands, but believed them to be of a new and undescribed variety of this animal. They were elands; but each was marked with small white stripes across the body, in this respect resembling \"koodoos.\"  After a short examination of the spoor, Congo asserted that a troop of elands had first visited the watering-place, and that while they were there four bull elephants, also in search of water, had charged with great speed upon the antelopes.  Three or four lions had also joined in the strife, in which the only victims had been the unfortunate elands.  \"I think we are in a place where we had better make a regular enclosure, and stop for a few days,\" suggested Groot Willem, on his return to the camp.  \"There is plenty of feed for the horses, and we have proof that the `drift' where we crossed is a great resort for all kinds of game.\"  \"I'm of the same opinion,\" assented Hendrik; \"but I don't wish to encamp quite so close to the crossing as this is.  We had better move some distance off.  Then we shall not prevent game from seeking the drift, or be ourselves hindered from getting sleep.  Don't you think we'd better move little farther up the river?\"  \"Yes, yes,\" was the unanimous answer.  It was therefore decided that search should be made for a better camping-ground, where they could build themselves a proper enclosure, or \"kraal.\"  After partaking of their first breakfast upon the Limpopo, Groot Willem, Hans, and Hendrik mounted their horses and rode off up the river, accompanied by the full pack of dogs, leaving Arend, with Swartboy and Congo, to take care of the camp.  For nearly three miles, the young hunters rode along the bank of the river, without finding any spot where access to the water could be readily obtained.  The banks were high and steep, and therefore but little visited by such animals as they wished to hunt.  At this point the features of the landscape began to change, presenting an appearance more to their satisfaction.  Light timber, such as would be required for the construction of a stockade, was growing near the river, which was no longer inaccessible, though its banks appeared but little frequented by game.  \"I think this place will suit admirably,\" said Groot Willem.  \"We are only half an hour's ride from the drift, and probably we may find good hunting-ground farther up stream.\"  \"Very likely,\" rejoined Hendrik; \"but before taking too much trouble to build ourselves a big kraal, we had better be sure about what sort of game is to be got here.\"  \"You are right about that,\" answered Willem; \"we must take care to find out whether there are hippopotami and giraffes.  We cannot go home without a pair of the latter.  Our friends would be disappointed, and some I know would have a laugh at us.\"  \"And you for one would deserve it,\" said Hans.  \"Remember how you ridiculed the other hunters who returned unsuccessful.\"  Having selected a place for the kraal, should they decide on staying awhile in the neighbourhood, the young hunters proceeded farther up the river, for the purpose of learning something more of the hunting-ground before finally determining to construct the enclosure.    CHAPTER THREE.  A TWIN TRAP.  Not long after the departure of Groot Willem and his companions, Arend, looking towards a thicket about half a mile from the river, perceived a small herd of antelopes quietly browsing upon the plain.  Mounting his horse, he rode off, with the intention of bagging one or more of them for the day's dinner.  Having ridden to the leeward of the herd, and getting near them, he saw that they were of the species known as \"Duyker,\" or Divers (_Antelope grimmia_).  Near them was a small \"motte\" of the _Nerium oleander_, a shrub about twelve feet high, loaded with beautiful blossoms.  Under the cover of these bushes, he rode up close enough to the antelopes to insure a good shot, and, picking out one of the largest of the herd, he fired.  All the antelopes but one rushed to the edge of the thicket, made a grand leap, and dived out of sight over the tops of the bushes,--thus affording a beautiful illustration of that peculiarity to which they are indebted for their name of Divers.  Riding up to the one that had remained behind, and which was that at which he had fired, the young hunter made sure that it was dead; he then trotted back to the camp, and despatched Congo and the Bushman to bring it in.  They soon returned with the carcass, which they proceeded to skin and make ready for the spit.  While thus engaged, Swartboy appeared to notice some thing out upon the plain.  \"Look yonner, Baas Arend,\" said he.  \"Well, what is it, Swart?\"  \"You see da pack-horse dare?  He gone too much off from de camp.\"  Arend turned and looked in the direction the Bushman was pointing.  One of the horses, which had strayed from its companions, was now more than half a mile off, and was wandering onwards.  \"All right, Swart.  You go on with your cooking.  I'll ride after it myself, and drive it in.\"  Arend, again mounting his horse, trotted off in the direction of the animal that had strayed.  For cooking the antelope, Congo and Swartboy saw the necessity of providing themselves with some water; and taking a vessel for that purpose, they set out for the drift,--that being the nearest place where they could obtain it.  They kept along the bank of the river, and just before reaching a place where they would descend to the water, Congo, who was in the advance, suddenly disappeared!  He had walked on to a carefully concealed pit, dug for the purpose of catching hippopotami or elephants.  The hole was about nine feet deep; and after being astonished by dropping into it, the Kaffir was nearly blinded by the sand, dust, and other materials that had formed the covering of the pit.  Congo was too well acquainted with this South African device for killing large game to be anyways disconcerted by what had happened; and after becoming convinced that he was uninjured by the fall, he turned his glance upward, expecting assistance from his companion.  But Swartboy's aid could not just then be given.  The Bushman, amused by the ludicrous incident that had befallen his rival, was determined to enjoy the fun for a little longer.  Uttering a wild shout of laughter that was a tolerable imitation of an enraged hyena, Swartboy seemed transported into a heaven of unadulterated joy.  Earth appeared hardly able to hold him as he leaped and danced around the edge of the pit.  Never had his peculiar little mind been so intensely delighted; but the manifestations of that delight were more suddenly terminated than commenced; for in the midst of his eccentric capers he, too, suddenly disappeared into the earth as if swallowed up by an earthquake!  His misfortune was similar to that which had befallen his companion.  Two pitfalls had been constructed close together, and Swartboy now occupied the second.  It is a common practice among the natives of South Africa to trap the elephant in these twin pitfalls; as the animals, too hastily avoiding the one, run the risk of dropping into the other.  Swartboy and the Kaffir had unexpectedly found a place where this plan had been adopted; and, much to their discomfiture, without the success anticipated by those who had taken the trouble to contrive it.  The cavity into which Congo had fallen contained about two feet of mud on the bottom.  The sides were perpendicular, and of a soapy sort of clay, so that his attempts at climbing out proved altogether unsuccessful, thus greatly increasing the chagrin of his unphilosophic mind.  He had heard the Bushman's screams of delight, and the sounds had contributed nothing to reconcile him to the mischance that had befallen him.  Several minutes passed and he heard nothing of Swartboy.  He was not surprised at the Bushman's having been amused as well as gratified by his misfortune.  Still, he expected that in time he would lend assistance and pull him out of the pit.  But as this assistance was not given, and as Swartboy, not satisfied with laughing at his misfortune appeared also to have gone off and left him to his fate, the Kaffir became frantic with rage.  Several more minutes passed, which to Congo seemed hours, and still nothing was seen or heard of his companion.  Had Swartboy returned to the camp?  If so, why had not Arend, on ascertaining what was wrong, hastened to the relief of his faithful servant?  As some addition to the discomforts of the place, the pit contained many reptiles and insects that had in some manner obtained admittance, and, like himself, could not escape.  There were toads, frogs, large ants called \"soldiers,\" and other creatures whose company he had no relish to keep.  In vain he called, \"Swartboy!\" and \"Baas Arend!\"  No one came to his call.  The strong, vindictive spirit of his race was soon roused to the pitch of fury, and liberty became only desired for one object.  That was revenge,--revenge on the man who, instead of releasing him from his imprisonment, only exulted in its continuance.  The Bushman had not been injured in falling into the pit, as may be supposed.  After fully"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27911"],["title","The Giraffe Hunters (#2)"],["body","the manner in which his amusement had been so suddenly brought to a termination, his first thought was to extricate himself, without asking assistance from the man who had furnished him with the fun.  His pride would be greatly mortified should the Kaffir get out of his pit, and find him in the other.  That would be a humiliating rencontre.  In silence, therefore, he listened to Congo's cries for assistance, while at the same time doing all in his power to extricate himself.  He tried to pull up a sharp-pointed stake that stood in the bottom of the pit.  This piece of timber had been placed there for the purpose of impaling and killing the hippopotamus or elephant that should drop down upon it; and had the Bushman succeeded in taking it from the place where it had been planted, he might have used it in working his own way to the surface of the earth.  This object, however, he was unable to accomplish, and his mind became diverted to another idea.  Swartboy had a system of logic, not wholly peculiar to himself, by which he was enabled to discover that there must be some first cause for his being in a place from which he could not escape.  That cause was no other than Congo.  Had the Kaffir not fallen into a pit, Swartboy was quite certain that he would have escaped the similar calamity.  He would have liberated Congo from his confinement, and perhaps sympathised with his misfortune, after the first ebullitions of his mirth had been exhausted; but now, on being entrapped himself, he was only conscious that some one was to blame for the disagreeable incident, and was unable to admit that this some one was himself.  The mishap had befallen him in company with the Kaffir.  It was that individual's misfortune that had conducted to his own, and this was another reason why he now submitted to his captivity in profound silence.  Unlike Congo, he did not experience the soul-harrowing thought of being neglected, and could therefore endure his confinement with some degree of patience not possible to his companion.  Moreover, he had the hope of speedy deliverance, which to Congo was denied.  He knew that Arend would soon return to the camp with the stray horse, and miss them.  The water-vessel would also be missed, and a search would be made for it in the right direction.  No doubt Arend, seeing that the bucket was taken away from the camp, and finding that they did not return, would come toward the drift,--the only place where water could be dipped up.  In doing so he must pass within sight of the pits. With this calculation, therefore, Swartboy could reconcile himself to patience and silence, whereas the Kaffir had no such consolatory data to reflect upon.    CHAPTER FOUR.  IN THE PITS.  As time passed on, however, and Swartboy saw that the sun was descending, and that the shades of night would soon be gathering over the river, his hopes began to sink within him.  He could not understand why the young hunter had not long ago come to release them.  Groot Willem, Hendrik, and Hans should have returned by that time; and the four should have made an effectual search for their missing servants. He had remained silent for a long time, under very peculiar circumstances.  But silence now became unbearable, and he was seized with a sudden desire to express his dissatisfaction at the manner Fate had been dealing out events,--a desire no longer to be resisted.  The silence was at last broken by his calling out--  \"Congo, you ole fool, where are you?  What for don't you go home?\"  On the Kaffir's ear the voice fell dull and distant; and yet he immediately understood whence it came.  Like himself, the Bushman was in a living grave!  That explained his neglect to render the long-desired assistance.  \"Lor', Swart! why I waiting for you,\" answered Congo, for the first time since his imprisonment attempting a smile; \"I don't want to go to the camp and leave you behind me.\"  \"You think a big sight too much of yourself,\" rejoined the Bushman. \"Who wants to be near such a black ole fool as you?  You may go back to the camp, and when you get there jus' tell Baas Hendrik that Swartboy wants to see him.  I've got something particular to tell him.\"  \"Very well,\" answered the Kaffir, becoming more reconciled to his position; \"what for you want see Baas Hendrik?  I'll tell him what you want without making him come here.  What shall I say?\"  In answer to this question, Swartboy made a long speech, in which the Kaffir was requested to report himself as a fool for having fallen into a pit,--that he had shown himself more stupid than the sea-cows, that had apparently shunned the trap for years.  On being requested to explain how one was more stupid than the other,-- both having met with the same mischance,--Swartboy went on to prove that his misfortune was wholly owing to the fault of Congo, by the Kaffir having committed the first folly of allowing himself to be entrapped.  Nothing, to the Bushman's mind, could be more clear than that Congo's stupidity in falling into the first pit had led to his own downfall into the second.  This was now a source of much consolation to him, and the verbal expression of his wrongs enabled him for a while to feel rather happy at the fine opportunity afforded for reviling his rival.  The amusement, however, could not prevent his thoughts from returning to the positive facts that he was imprisoned; that in place of passing the day in cooking and eating _duyker_, he had been fasting and fretting in a dark, dirty pit, in the companionship of loathsome reptiles.  His mind now expanding under the exercise of a startled imagination, he became apprehensive.  What if some accident should have occurred to Arend, and prevented his return to the camp?  What if Groot Willem and the others should have strayed, and not find their way back to the place for two or three days?  He had heard of such events happening to other stupid white men, and why not to them?  What if they had met a tribe of the savage inhabitants of the country, and been killed or taken prisoners?  These conjectures, and a thousand others, flitted through the brain of the Bushman, all guiding to the conclusion that, should either of them prove correct, he would first have to eat the reptiles in the pit, and then starve.  It was no consolation to him to think that his rival in the other pit would have to submit to a similar fate.  His unpleasant reveries were interrupted by a short, angry bark; and, looking up to the opening through which he had descended, he beheld the countenance of a wild dog,--the \"wilde honden\" of the Dutch Boers.  Uttering another and a different cry, the animal started back; and from the sounds now heard overhead, the Bushman was certain that it was accompanied by many others of its kind.  An instinctive fear of man led them to retreat for a short distance; but they soon found out that \"the wicked flee when no man pursueth,\" and they returned.  They were hungry, and had the sense to know that the enemy they had discovered was, for some reason, unable to molest them.  Approaching nearer, and more near, they again gathered around the pits, and saw that food was waiting for them at the bottom of both.  They could contemplate their victims unharmed, and this made them courageous enough to think of an attack.  The human voice and the gaze of human eyes had lost their power, and the pack of wild hounds, counting several score, began to think of taking some steps towards satisfying their hunger.  They commenced scratching and tearing away the covering of the pits, sending down a shower of dust, sand, and grass that nearly suffocated the two men imprisoned beneath.  The poles supporting the screen of earth were rotten with age, and the whole scaffolding threatened to come down as the wild dogs scampered over it.  \"If there should be a shower of dogs,\" thought Swartboy, \"I hope that fool Congo will have his share of it.\"  This hope was immediately realised, for the next instant he heard the howling of one of the animals evidently down in the adjoining pit.  It had fallen through, but, fortunately for Congo, not without injuring itself in a way that he had but narrowly escaped.  The dog had got transfixed on the sharp-pointed stake, planted firmly in the centre of the pit, and was now hanging on it in horrible agony, unable to get clear.  Without lying down in the mud, the Kaffir was unable to keep his face more than twelve inches from the open jaws of the dog, that in its struggles spun round as on a pivot; and Congo had to press close against the side of the pit, to keep out of the reach of the creature yelping in his ears.  Swartboy could distinguish the utterances of this dog from those of its companions above, and the interpretation he gave to them was, that a fierce combat was taking place between it and the Kaffir.  The jealousy and petty ill-will so often exhibited by the Bushman was not so strong as he had himself believed.  His intense anxiety to know which was getting the best of the fight, added to the fear that Congo was being torn to pieces, told him that his friendship for the Kaffir far outweighed the animosity he fancied himself to have felt.  The fiendish yells of the dogs, the unpleasant situation in which he was placed, and the uncertainty of the time he was to endure it, were well-nigh driving him distracted; when just then the wild honden appeared to be beating a retreat,--the only one remaining being that in the pit with Congo.  What was driving them away?  Could assistance be at hand?  Breathlessly the Bushman stood listening.    CHAPTER FIVE.  AREND LOST.  In the afternoon, when Groot Willem, Hans, and Hendrik returned to the camp, they found it deserted.  Several jackals reluctantly skulked off as they drew near and on riding up to the spot from which those creatures had retired, they saw the clean-picked bones of an antelope.  The camp must have been deserted for several hours.  \"What does this mean?\""]]]
