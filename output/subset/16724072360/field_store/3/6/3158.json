The expedition to Bechuanaland in 1884, under the command of Sir Charles Warren, was accompanied by a detachment of three balloons, and the following year balloons co-operated with the Sudan Expeditionary Force, when Major Elsdale carried out some photographic experiments from the air.  In 1890 a balloon section was introduced into the Army as a unit of the Royal Engineers, and not long afterwards, the Balloon Factory was established at South Farnborough, where in 1912 it was transformed into the Royal Aircraft Factory. Four balloon sections took part in the South African War and were used during the Siege of Ladysmith, at Magersfontein and Paardeburg. Colonel Lynch, who served in the Boer Army, stated at a lecture delivered in Paris after the war that \"the Boers took a dislike to balloons. All other instruments of war were at their command; they had artillery superior for the most part to, and better served than, that of the English; they had telegraphic and heliographic apparatus; but the balloons were the symbol of a scientific superiority of the English which seriously disquieted them.\"  I went through a course in ballooning during leave from West Africa in 1904 and remember that partly owing to the energy of Colonel Capper, partly to the impetus given by the South African War, and partly to the growing interest in all things aeronautical throughout the civilized world, it was noticeable that the activities of the Balloon Factory were increasing in many directions. Although the spherical balloon had been improved, its disabilities were recognized and experiments were made with elongated balloons, man-flying kites, air photography, signalling devices, observation of artillery fire, mechanical apparatus for hauling down balloons, and petrol motors. A grant for a dirigible balloon was obtained in 1903, though it was not until 1907, the year in which Cody began the construction of his aeroplane at Farnborough, and Charles Rolls his experiments, that the airship \"Nulli Secundus\" made her first flight. She was about 120 feet long and 30 feet in diameter, and was driven by a 40 horse-power engine at a speed of 30 miles an hour. On October 5th this airship flew to London in an hour and a half, circled round St. Paul's, man[oe]uvred over Buckingham Palace, and descended at the Crystal Palace. In the same year, be it remembered, a Zeppelin had made a trip of 200 miles from Friedrichshaven to Frankfort. The \"Nulli Secundus\" was followed in 1910 by the \"Beta\" and the \"Gamma.\"  Meanwhile an Advisory Committee for Aeronautics had been appointed, and the National Physical Laboratory had organized a department at Teddington for the investigation of aeronautical problems in co-operation with the Balloon Factory.   _The Air Battalion._  In 1911 the authorities could no longer close their eyes, especially at a time when rumours of war were rife, to the rapid development of heavier-than-air craft on the Continent. So far, as we have seen, the aeroplane had been regarded in England as little more than the plaything of a few adventurous but foolhardy spirits. A certain amount of experience in piloting and handling aeroplanes had been gained by a handful of Army officers, but the machines used either belonged to the officers themselves, to civilians, or to aviation firms. I was at that time a general staff officer in the Directorate of Military Operations under General Wilson, now Field Marshal and late Chief of the Imperial General Staff, and was the only officer in the War Office who had learned to fly. It appeared very important that a study of the military possibilities of aviation should be made. The prime rôle of cavalry, reconnaissance, seemed to have passed from it. In addition to my normal duties, I visited France, Germany and Italy, collected information on foreign activities, wrote reports, and tried to create a knowledge of the possible effect of future military aeronautics and to urge the formation of a flying corps.  In 1911 the Air Battalion of the Royal Engineers, consisting of Headquarters, No. 1 Company (Airships) and No. 2 Company (Aeroplanes), was formed and superseded the Balloon School. The creation of No. 2 Company, stationed at Larkhill, marked the first formation of a British military unit composed entirely of heavier-than-air aircraft. The same year witnessed the inception of the B.E., F.E. and S.E. type machines in the Balloon Factory, but the total of our machines, both for naval and military requirements, amounted to something less than twelve aeroplanes and two small airships; and the mishaps suffered by the military machines on their flight from Larkhill to Cambridge, to take part in Army Man[oe]uvres, were significant of their unreliability.   _The Royal Flying Corps._  In view, therefore, of the reports received of the progress abroad, the Air Battalion was clearly insufficient to meet the demands which might be made upon it in the event of war; and at the end of 1911 the Prime Minister instructed a standing Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence to consider the future development of air navigation for naval and military purposes. As a result of their deliberations the Committee recommended the creation of a British Air Service to be regarded as one and designated the Royal Flying Corps; the division of the Corps into a Naval Wing, a Military Wing, and a Central Flying School; the maintenance of the closest possible collaboration between the Corps, the Advisory Committee for Aeronautics and the Aircraft (late Balloon) Factory; and the appointment of a permanent Consultative Committee, named the Air Committee, to deal with all aeronautical questions affecting both the Admiralty and the War Office.  Consequent upon these recommendations, a Technical Sub-Committee was formed, consisting of Brig.-General Henderson, Major MacInnes of the directorate of Military Training at the War Office, a splendid officer, who died during the war, and myself, to draft the new scheme. The objects kept in view in framing our peace organization were to suit it to war conditions, as far as they could be foreseen, to base it on an efficient self-contained unit, and, while allowing for the wide differences between naval and military requirements, to ensure the maximum co-operation between the two branches of the Service. Success beyond expectation was achieved in the first two objects, but, as will be seen, the naval and military branches tended for unforeseen but good reasons to diverge, until they joined hands again in 1918 as the Royal Air Force. The bases of the military organization were, a headquarters, the squadron, and the flying depôt. These proved their value during the war and have remained the units of our air forces to this day. The Military Wing was to form a single and complete organization and contain a headquarters, seven aeroplane squadrons, each to consist of twelve active machines and six in reserve, one airship and kite squadron, and a flying depôt. All pilots, whether of the Naval or the Military Wing, were eventually to graduate at the Central Flying School, whence they could join either the Naval Wing at Eastchurch or one of the Military Squadrons. In time of war each branch of the Service was to form a reserve for the other if required.   _The Military Wing._  In accordance with this scheme I received instructions to organize, recruit, train and command the Military Wing of the Royal Flying Corps. The functions of the Military Wing were quite clear: it was to meet the air requirements of the Expeditionary Force primarily for reconnaissance purposes, but its organization was framed so that it could easily be expanded and the scope of its duties widened. Headquarters were established at Farnborough on May 13th, 1912: Barrington-Kennett, an officer of the Grenadier Guards who had been attached to the Air Battalion, was appointed, and made the best of all possible adjutants; and the nucleus of the Corps, consisting at first of the cadres of an airship squadron under Edward Maitland, of two aeroplane squadrons under Burke and Brooke-Popham, and a flying depôt (later the aircraft park) under Carden, who was a little later greatly assisted in the complex matter of technical stores by Beatty, came into existence. At the same time the construction of the Central Flying School was started at Upavon, under Captain G. Payne, R.N. With regard to the other squadrons provided for, the nucleus of No. 4 Squadron was formed the same year, and that of No. 5 Squadron the following year, of Nos. 6 and 7 Squadrons in 1914, while No. 8 Squadron was not started until after the outbreak of war.  Records of the progress and growth of the Corps were left at Farnborough when the Headquarters and four squadrons went to France in August, 1914, and have been lost. This is particularly unfortunate because without them it will be difficult for the historian of the Corps adequately to describe the beginnings and to assess the value of the work then carried out.  The task of forming the new service, which was to do much to assist the Army in saving England, was begun. The time was very short. A great energy had to be brought to the work. As with all things new, it had to contend with apathy and opposition on all sides. There was no precedent to help. The organization of the Corps to its smallest detail of technical stores, supply and transport had to be thought out. The type of machine required; the method of obtaining it from a struggling industry; its use and maintenance; the personnel, its training and equipment; these, and a thousand other aspects of the question,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25254"],["title","Notes on Islam (#1)"],["body","to God_ lies in,    (1) Worship                 [Arabic: ʿibādat]   (2) Seeking His Protection  [Arabic: Isti'anāt]   (3) Seeking His Guidance    [Arabic: Istihdā]  Part III.--_The Straight Path_ [Arabic: islām = madhab] _for Man_   being:--    (1) the path of Grace (= path of those who         obtain Grace)    (2) not the Path of Sin (=path of those         who deliberately go wrong).

Amen.  _St. Matthew_, vi 9-13.               _The Qur'an_, i.   If you will carefully compare the parts of each Prayer which I have written as separate paragraphs marked (_a_), (_b_) and (_c_), you will observe that there is difference only in the language, but no difference whatever in the real meaning. There is in both Prayers absolutely the same spirit of    (_a_) Adoration,    (_b_) Submission, and    (_c_) Supplication.  Both begin with the _praise_ of the Lord to whom all praise is due. This is followed in both by an expression of our _entire dependence_ on Him and submission to His will. Lastly, there is _solicitation for guidance_, positive and negative, _viz._, guidance towards right action and guidance for avoiding temptation.  The three parts (_a_), (_b_) and (_c_) of the Christian as well as of the Muslim Prayer are in perfect accord with the results of a comparative study of the religious systems of the world. They correspond to three essential elements in _all_ religions, _viz._,    (_a_) _Belief_ in the existence of a Supreme Power which           is Infinite and Absolute,    (_b_) _Feeling_ of man's entire dependence on that Power,            and    (_c_) _Desire_ to seek or solicit guidance of that Power            in the daily life of man.  You will thus see that both the Lord's Prayer in the Bible and the Opening Chapter of the Qur'an go to the roots of all religions ever professed by man. They are truly Universal Prayers. No man need hesitate to join in the solemn recitation of either.  We ought to view all monotheistic religions--religions which enjoin belief in one God--in the spirit in which St. Peter viewed them when he said (_Acts_ x. 34-5): \"Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons, but in every nation he that feareth Him and worketh righteousness is accepted with Him.\" The same is the spirit of the oft-repeated definition of 'Muslims' in the Qur'an: [Arabic: llaḏīna ʾāmanū minkum wa-ʿamilū ṣ-ṣāliḥāt] \"those who believe and work righteousness.\" \"Trust in the Lord and do good,\" as the psalm says.     +Note 3.+  I.--_What is Religion?_   I have said that _true_ Islam is the _best_ religion in the world. I must prove my assertion. In order to do so I have to explain:--    I. What do I mean by religion?  II. What is true Islam? III. Why is it the best religion?  I.--_Religion, God and Nature._  _Religion._--No thinking man can help asking himself the questions: \"Whence has this world come? Whither is it bound to go?\" in other words, \"What was the _origin_ ([Arabic: mabdā]) and what will be the _end_ ([Arabic: ma'ād]) of the world of men, animals, plants and things that I perceive?\" The answers which each man gives to these questions constitute his _religion_. A few earnest persons (poets, philosophers and theologians) try to answer these questions for themselves by patient study and earnest thought[13]. But a large majority of men and women merely take the answers taught them by their parents, teachers or priests. There may possibly be a small number of men who do not trouble themselves about these questions. These are not \"thinking men\" and may therefore be left out of account.  Religion is a silent and subtle power that works in the heart of man and makes for righteousness. It is generated by his conviction as to the beginning and end of himself and the world in which he lives and moves[14].  _God._--No intelligent and intelligible answers can be given to questions as to the origin and the end or the government of _Nature_[15] without assuming the existence of the _One and only one God_ who is _Infinite_ and _Absolute_, _i.e._, One who hath neither beginning nor end and who is not conditioned or limited by anything whatever[16]. The Infinite and Absolute One has been called by different names by different people at different times[17]. Yezdan, Ishwara, Jehovah, God, and Allah are the names, in different languages, of the same _Infinite and Absolute God_.    God of the Granite and the Rose     Soul of the Sparrow and the Bee!   The mighty tide of being flows     Through countless channels, Lord, from Thee.  *_Conceptions of God, His attributes, and His relation to Nature._--These have been and will ever be many and various. But I summarise three principal conceptions under each head, for I believe that other ideas, notions or conceptions are but combinations of two or more of these:--   I. Conceptions of God:--    1. God as the Ultimate _Law_.   2. God as the Omnipotent Energy or _Power_.   3. God as the Supreme Being or _Person[18]_.  II. Notions of God's principal attributes:--    1. God as Creator or Nourisher.   2. God as Preserver or Protector.   3. God as Adjuster or Judge[18].  [*] _Paragraphs marked with asterisks and their footnotes may be        omitted at the first reading._   III. Ideas of God's relation with Nature[20] (_i.e._, with the world of men, animals, plants and other objects, and their inter-relations, of which men are aware):--    1. All is _from_ God = God is _above_ Nature                          which He created and                          governs (Theism).    2. God is _in_ All   = God is _in_ Nature although                          Nature is not                          God (Panentheism).    3. God _is_ All      = God _is_ Nature and                          Nature is God (Pantheism)[21].  * The above is but a rough summary. I have neither time nor space to explain and illustrate it. I have ventured to give some hints--imperfect hints, I fear--in the footnotes. I may however state here that, of the above three conceptions, notions or ideas Islam accepts the medium or the middle one which, as a little thought will show, includes the other two conceptions also. You need not at present try to understand the summary or the words given in brackets. My subsequent Notes will explain it to some extent. Please remember that there are many men and many minds, and that there are likely to be as many religions, as many conceptions of God, as many notions of His attributes, and as many ideas of the beginning or end of things, ([Arabic: mabdā' wa ma'ād]) as there are _thinking_ minds[22].   Let me conclude this Note with a short answer to the question why religion is necessary to Man[23]. No society is possible without religion, because of the dual nature of Man. As our poet says, [Persian: ba bahaa'm bahra dari ba malaa'ik neez ham] and as all modern men of science (such as Sir Oliver Lodge and others) admit, there is a higher and a lower in every man's nature, the one lifts him up and the other pulls him down in the scale of animal and social existence. Religion is necessary in order that every man's higher nature may conquer his lower nature in order that he may become a social being who is virtuous and does good of his own accord, and may not remain a mere beast whom the whip alone prevents from doing mischief. It is religion that fosters high-thinking and holy-living, so necessary for the advancement of the human race.     +Note 4.+  II.--_What is true Islam?_   The answer to this question is contained within the four corners, as it were, of the Opening Sura[24] [Arabic: Sura al-fātiḥa] which is a general summary of the whole Qur'an. I have already analysed it and asked you to compare it with the Christian prayer called the Lord's prayer. I am sure you have noted and admired its simplicity and clearness and its almost scientific precision and comprehensiveness. I am only amplifying what I have already said when I say that the Sura teaches three cardinal and eternal truths:--  _1st._--There is but One God who has created the worlds, maintains them, and rules them. In the inimitable words of the Sura of Purity.                                         [Arabic:"]]]
