Again and again in the course of the dinner she took her mind back to the events of the day to discover the reason for her unease.  Usually when she adopted this method she came upon the trivial causes in which apprehension was born, but now she was puzzled to find that a solution was denied her. Her letters of the morning had been pleasant, neither the house nor the servants had given her any trouble. She was well herself, and though she knew John had a little money trouble, since his unfortunate speculation in Roumanian gold shares, and she half suspected that he had had to borrow money to make good his losses, yet his prospects were so excellent and the success of his last book so promising that she, probably seeing with a clearer vision the unimportance of those money worries, was less concerned about the problem than he.  “You will have your coffee in the study, I suppose,” said Grace, “and I know you'll excuse me; I have to see Mrs. Chandler on the mundane subject of laundry.”  She favoured Kara with a little nod as she left the room and touched John's shoulder lightly with her hand in passing.  Kara's eyes followed her graceful figure until she was out of view, then:  “I want to see you, Kara,” said John Lexman, “if you will give me five minutes.”  “You can have five hours, if you like,” said the other, easily.  They went into the study together; the maid brought the coffee and liqueur, and placed them on a little table near the fire and disappeared.  For a time the conversation was general. Kara, who was a frank admirer of the comfort of the room and who lamented his own inability to secure with money the cosiness which John had obtained at little cost, went on a foraging expedition whilst his host applied himself to a proof which needed correcting.  “I suppose it is impossible for you to have electric light here,” Kara asked.  “Quite,” replied the other.  “Why?”  “I rather like the light of this lamp.”  “It isn't the lamp,” drawled the Greek and made a little grimace; “I hate these candles.”  He waved his hand to the mantle-shelf where the six tall, white, waxen candles stood out from two wall sconces.  “Why on earth do you hate candles?” asked the other in surprise.  Kara made no reply for the moment, but shrugged his shoulders. Presently he spoke.  “If you were ever tied down to a chair and by the side of that chair was a small keg of black powder and stuck in that powder was a small candle that burnt lower and lower every minute--my God!”  John was amazed to see the perspiration stand upon the forehead of his guest.  “That sounds thrilling,” he said.  The Greek wiped his forehead with a silk handkerchief and his hand shook a little.  “It was something more than thrilling,” he said.  “And when did this occur?” asked the author curiously.  “In Albania,” replied the other; “it was many years ago, but the devils are always sending me reminders of the fact.”  He did not attempt to explain who the devils were or under what circumstances he was brought to this unhappy pass, but changed the subject definitely.  Sauntering round the cosy room he followed the bookshelf which filled one wall and stopped now and again to examine some title. Presently he drew forth a stout volume.  “'Wild Brazil',” he read, “by George Gathercole-do you know Gathercole?”  John was filling his pipe from a big blue jar on his desk and nodded.  “Met him once--a taciturn devil. Very short of speech and, like all men who have seen and done things, less inclined to talk about himself than any man I know.”  Kara looked at the book with a thoughtful pucker of brow and turned the leaves idly.  “I've never seen him,” he said as he replaced the book, “yet, in a sense, his new journey is on my behalf.”  The other man looked up.  “On your behalf?”  “Yes--you know he has gone to Patagonia for me. He believes there is gold there--you will learn as much from his book on the mountain systems of South America. I was interested in his theories and corresponded with him. As a result of that correspondence he undertook to make a geological survey for me. I sent him money for his expenses, and he went off.”  “You never saw him?” asked John Lexman, surprised.  Kara shook his head.  “That was not--?” began his host.  “Not like me, you were going to say. Frankly, it was not, but then I realized that he was an unusual kind of man. I invited him to dine with me before he left London, and in reply received a wire from Southampton intimating that he was already on his way.”  Lexman nodded.  “It must be an awfully interesting kind of life,” he said. “I suppose he will be away for quite a long time?”  “Three years,” said Kara, continuing his examination of the bookshelf.  “I envy those fellows who run round the world writing books,” said John, puffing reflectively at his pipe. “They have all the best of it.”  Kara turned. He stood immediately behind the author and the other could not see his face. There was, however, in his voice an unusual earnestness and an unusual quiet vehemence.  “What have you to complain about!” he asked, with that little drawl of his. “You have your own creative work--the most fascinating branch of labour that comes to a man. He, poor beggar, is bound to actualities. You have the full range of all the worlds which your imagination gives to you. You can create men and destroy them, call into existence fascinating problems, mystify and baffle ten or twenty thousand people, and then, at a word, elucidate your mystery.”  John laughed.  “There is something in that,” he said.  “As for the rest of your life,” Kara went on in a lower voice, “I think you have that which makes life worth living--an incomparable wife.”  Lexman swung round in his chair, and met the other's gaze, and there was something in the set of the other's handsome face which took his breath away.  “I do not see--” he began.  Kara smiled.  “That was an impertinence, wasn't it!” he said, banteringly. “But then you mustn't forget, my dear man, that I was very anxious to marry your wife. I don't suppose it is secret. And when I lost her, I had ideas about you which are not pleasant to recall.”  He had recovered his self-possession and had continued his aimless stroll about the room.  “You must remember I am a Greek, and the modern Greek is no philosopher. You must remember, too, that I am a petted child of fortune, and have had everything I wanted since I was a baby.”  “You are a fortunate devil,” said the other, turning back to his desk, and taking up his pen.  For a moment Kara did not speak, then he made as though he would say something, checked himself, and laughed.  “I wonder if I am,” he said.  And now he spoke with a sudden energy.  “What is this trouble you are having with Vassalaro?”  John rose from his chair and walked over to the fire, stood gazing down into its depths, his legs wide apart, his hands clasped behind him, and Kara took his attitude to supply an answer to the question.  “I warned you against Vassalaro,” he said, stooping by the other's side to light his cigar with a spill of paper. “My dear Lexman, my fellow countrymen are unpleasant people to deal with in certain moods.”  “He was so obliging at first,” said Lexman, half to himself.  “And now he is so disobliging,” drawled Kara. “That is a way which moneylenders have, my dear man; you were very foolish to go to him at all. I could have lent you the money.”  “There were reasons why I should not borrow money from you,”, said John, quietly, “and I think you yourself have supplied the principal reason when you told me just now, what I already knew, that you wanted to marry Grace.”  “How much is the amount?” asked Kara, examining his well-manicured finger-nails.  “Two thousand five hundred pounds,” replied John, with a short laugh, “and I haven't two thousand five hundred shillings at this moment.”  “Will he wait?”  John Lexman shrugged his shoulders.  “Look here, Kara,” he said, suddenly, “don't think I want to reproach you, but it was through you that I met Vassalaro so that you know the kind of man he is.”  Kara nodded.  “Well, I can tell you he has been very unpleasant indeed,” said John, with a frown, “I had an interview with him yesterday in London and it is clear that he is going to make a lot of trouble. I depended upon the success of my play in town giving me enough to pay him off, and I very foolishly made a lot of promises of repayment which I have been unable to keep.”  “I see,” said Kara, and then, “does Mrs. Lexman know about this matter?”  “A little,” said the other.  He paced restlessly up and down the room, his hands behind him and his chin upon his chest.  “Naturally I have not told her the worst, or how beastly unpleasant the man has been.”  He stopped and turned.  “Do you know he threatened to kill me?” he asked.  Kara smiled.  “I can tell you it was no laughing matter,” said the other, angrily, “I nearly took the little whippersnapper by the scruff of the neck and kicked him.”  Kara dropped his hand on the other's arm.  “I am not laughing at you,” he said; “I am laughing at the thought of Vassalaro threatening to kill anybody. He is the biggest coward in the world. What on earth induced him to take this drastic step?”  “He said he is being hard pushed for money,” said the other, moodily, “and it is possibly true. He was beside himself with anger and anxiety, otherwise I might have given the little blackguard the thrashing he deserved.”  Kara who had continued his stroll came down the room and halted in front of the fireplace looking at the young author with a paternal smile.  “You don't understand Vassalaro,” he said; “I repeat he is the greatest coward in the world. You will probably discover he is full of firearms and threats of slaughter, but you have only to click a revolver to see him collapse. Have you a revolver, by the way?”  “Oh, nonsense,” said the other, roughly, “I cannot engage myself "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2688"],["title","The Clue of the Twisted Candle (#2)"],["body","that kind of melodrama.”  “It is not nonsense,” insisted the other, “when you are in Rome, et cetera, and when you have to deal with a low-class Greek you must use methods which will at least impress him. If you thrash him, he will never forgive you and will probably stick a knife into you or your wife. If you meet his melodrama with melodrama and at the psychological moment produce your revolver; you will secure the effect you require. Have you a revolver?”  John went to his desk and, pulling open a drawer, took out a small Browning.  “That is the extent of my armory,” he said, “it has never been fired and was sent to me by an unknown admirer last Christmas.”  “A curious Christmas present,” said the other, examining the weapon.  “I suppose the mistaken donor imagined from my books that I lived in a veritable museum of revolvers, sword sticks and noxious drugs,” said Lexman, recovering some of his good humour; “it was accompanied by a card.”  “Do you know how it works?” asked the other.  “I have never troubled very much about it,” replied Lexman, “I know that it is loaded by slipping back the cover, but as my admirer did not send ammunition, I never even practised with it.”  There was a knock at the door.  “That is the post,” explained John.  The maid had one letter on the salver and the author took it up with a frown.  “From Vassalaro,” he said, when the girl had left the room.  The Greek took the letter in his hand and examined it.  “He writes a vile fist,” was his only comment as he handed it back to John.  He slit open the thin, buff envelope and took out half a dozen sheets of yellow paper, only a single sheet of which was written upon. The letter was brief:    “I must see you to-night without fail,” ran the scrawl; “meet me    at the crossroads between Beston Tracey and the Eastbourne    Road.  I shall be there at eleven o'clock, and, if you want to    preserve your life, you had better bring me a substantial    instalment.”  It was signed “Vassalaro.”  John read the letter aloud. “He must be mad to write a letter like that,” he said; “I'll meet the little devil and teach him such a lesson in politeness as he is never likely to forget.”  He handed the letter to the other and Kara read it in silence.  “Better take your revolver,” he said as he handed it back.  John Lexman looked at his watch.  “I have an hour yet, but it will take me the best part of twenty minutes to reach the Eastbourne Road.”  “Will you see him?” asked Kara, in a tone of surprise.  “Certainly,” Lexman replied emphatically: “I cannot have him coming up to the house and making a scene and that is certainly what the little beast will do.”  “Will you pay him?” asked Kara softly.  John made no answer. There was probably 10 pounds in the house and a cheque which was due on the morrow would bring him another 30 pounds. He looked at the letter again. It was written on paper of an unusual texture. The surface was rough almost like blotting paper and in some places the ink absorbed by the porous surface had run. The blank sheets had evidently been inserted by a man in so violent a hurry that he had not noticed the extravagance.  “I shall keep this letter,” said John.  “I think you are well advised. Vassalaro probably does not know that he transgresses a law in writing threatening letters and that should be a very strong weapon in your hand in certain eventualities.”  There was a tiny safe in one corner of the study and this John opened with a key which he took from his pocket. He pulled open one of the steel drawers, took out the papers which were in it and put in their place the letter, pushed the drawer to, and locked it.  All the time Kara was watching him intently as one who found more than an ordinary amount of interest in the novelty of the procedure.  He took his leave soon afterwards.  “I would like to come with you to your interesting meeting,” he said, “but unfortunately I have business elsewhere. Let me enjoin you to take your revolver and at the first sign of any bloodthirsty intention on the part of my admirable compatriot, produce it and click it once or twice, you won't have to do more.”  Grace rose from the piano as Kara entered the little drawing-room and murmured a few conventional expressions of regret that the visitor's stay had been so short. That there was no sincerity in that regret Kara, for one, had no doubt. He was a man singularly free from illusions.  They stayed talking a little while.  “I will see if your chauffeur is asleep,” said John, and went out of the room.  There was a little silence after he had gone.  “I don't think you are very glad to see me,” said Kara. His frankness was a little embarrassing to the girl and she flushed slightly.  “I am always glad to see you, Mr. Kara, or any other of my husband's friends,” she said steadily.  He inclined his head.  “To be a friend of your husband is something,” he said, and then as if remembering something, “I wanted to take a book away with me--I wonder if your husband would mind my getting it?”  “I will find it for you.”  “Don't let me bother you,” he protested, “I know my way.”  Without waiting for her permission he left the girl with the unpleasant feeling that he was taking rather much for granted. He was gone less than a minute and returned with a book under his arm.  “I have not asked Lexman's permission to take it,” he said, “but I am rather interested in the author. Oh, here you are,” he turned to John who came in at that moment. “Might I take this book on Mexico?” he asked. “I will return it in the morning.”  They stood at the door, watching the tail light of the motor disappear down the drive; and returned in silence to the drawing room.  “You look worried, dear,” she said, laying her hand on his shoulder.  He smiled faintly.  “Is it the money?” she asked anxiously.  For a moment he was tempted to tell her of the letter. He stifled the temptation realizing that she would not consent to his going out if she knew the truth.  “It is nothing very much,” he said. “I have to go down to Beston Tracey to meet the last train. I am expecting some proofs down.”  He hated lying to her, and even an innocuous lie of this character was repugnant to him.  “I'm afraid you have had a dull evening,” he said, “Kara was not very amusing.”  She looked at him thoughtfully.  “He has not changed very much,” she said slowly.  “He's a wonderfully handsome chap, isn't he?” he asked in a tone of admiration. “I can't understand what you ever saw in a fellow like me, when you had a man who was not only rich, but possibly the best-looking man in the world.”  She shivered a little.  “I have seen a side of Mr. Kara that is not particularly beautiful,” she said. “Oh, John, I am afraid of that man!”  He looked at her in astonishment.  “Afraid?” he asked. “Good heavens, Grace, what a thing to say! Why I believe he'd do anything for you.”  “That is exactly what I am afraid of,” she said in a low voice.  She had a reason which she did not reveal. She had first met Remington Kara in Salonika two years before. She had been doing a tour through the Balkans with her father--it was the last tour the famous archeologist made--and had met the man who was fated to have such an influence upon her life at a dinner given by the American Consul.  Many were the stories which were told about this Greek with his Jove-like face, his handsome carriage and his limitless wealth. It was said that his mother was an American lady who had been captured by Albanian brigands and was sold to one of the Albanian chiefs who fell in love with her, and for her sake became a Protestant. He had been educated at Yale and at Oxford, and was known to be the possessor of vast wealth, and was virtually king of a hill district forty miles out of Durazzo. Here he reigned supreme, occupying a beautiful house which he had built by an Italian architect, and the fittings and appointments of which had been imported from the luxurious centres of the world.  In Albania they called him “Kara Rumo,” which meant “The Black Roman,”  for no particular reason so far as any one could judge, for his skin was as fair as a Saxon's, and his close-cropped curls were almost golden.  He had fallen in love with Grace Terrell. At first his attentions had amused her, and then there came a time when they frightened her, for the man's fire and passion had been unmistakable. She had made it plain to him that he could base no hopes upon her returning his love, and, in a scene which she even now shuddered to recall, he had revealed something of his wild and reckless nature. On the following day she did not see him, but two days later, when returning through the Bazaar from a dance which had been given by the Governor General, her carriage was stopped, she was forcibly dragged from its interior, and her cries were stifled with a cloth impregnated with a scent of a peculiar aromatic sweetness. Her assailants were about to thrust her into another carriage, when a party of British bluejackets who had been on leave came upon the scene, and, without knowing anything of the nationality of the girl, had rescued her.  In her heart of hearts she did not doubt Kara's complicity in this medieval attempt to gain a wife, but of this adventure she had told her husband nothing. Until her marriage she was constantly receiving valuable presents which she as constantly returned to the only address she knew--Kara's estate at Lemazo. A few months after her marriage she had learned through the newspapers that this “leader of Greek society”  had purchased a big house near Cadogan Square, and then, to her amazement and to her dismay, Kara had scraped an acquaintance with her husband even before the honeymoon was over.  His visits had been happily few, but the growing intimacy between John and this strange undisciplined man had been a source of constant distress to her.  Should she, at this, the eleventh hour, tell her husband all her fears and her suspicions?  She debated the point "]]]
