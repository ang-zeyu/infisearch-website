Thou to whose power our hope we give,       Free us from human strife.     Fed by Thy love divine we live,       For Love alone is Life;     And life most sweet, as heart to heart     Speaks kindly when we meet and part.     _I'M SITTING ALONE_       I'm sitting alone where the shadows fall     In somber groups at the vesper-call,     Where tear-dews of night seek the loving rose,     Her bosom to fill with mortal woes.      I'm waiting alone for the bridal hour     Of nymph and naiad from woodland bower;     Till vestal pearls that on leaflets lay,     Ravished with beauty the eye of day.      I'm watching alone o'er the starlit glow,     O'er the silv'ry moon and ocean flow;     And sketching in light the heaven of my youth--     Its starry hopes and its waves of truth.      I'm dreaming alone of its changeful sky--     What rainbows of rapture floated by!     Of a mother's love, that no words could speak     When parting the ringlets to kiss my cheek.      I'm thinking alone of a fair young bride,     The light of a home of love and pride;     How the glance of her husband's watchful eye     Turned to his star of idolatry.      I'm picturing alone a glad young face,     Upturned to his mother's in playful grace;     And the unsealed fountains of grief and joy     That gushed at the birth of that beautiful boy.      I'm weeping alone that the vision is fled,     The leaves all faded, the fruitage shed,     And wishing this earth more gifts from above,     Our reason made right and hearts all love.      Lynn, Mass., _September 3, 1866_.     _THE UNITED STATES TO GREAT BRITAIN_       Hail, brother! fling thy banner       To the billows and the breeze;     We proffer thee warm welcome       With our hand, though not our knees.      Lord of the main and manor!       Thy palm, in ancient day,     Didst rock the country's cradle       That wakes thy laureate's lay.      The hoar fight is forgotten;       Our eagle, like the dove,     Returns to bless a bridal       Betokened from above.      List, brother! angels whisper       To Judah's sceptered race,--     \"Thou of the self-same spirit,       Allied by nations' grace,      \"Wouldst cheer the hosts of heaven;       For Anglo-Israel, lo!     Is marching under orders;       His hand averts the blow.\"      Brave Britain, blest America!       Unite your battle-plan;     Victorious, all who live it,--     The love for God and man.      _Boston Herald_, Sunday, May 15, 1898.     _CHRIST MY REFUGE_       O'er waiting harpstrings of the mind       There sweeps a strain,     Low, sad, and sweet, whose measures bind       The power of pain,      And wake a white-winged angel throng       Of thoughts, illumed     By faith, and breathed in raptured song,       With love perfumed.      Then His unveiled, sweet mercies show       Life's burdens light.     I kiss the cross, and wake to know       A world more bright.      And o'er earth's troubled, angry sea       I see Christ walk,     And come to me, and tenderly,       Divinely talk.      Thus Truth engrounds me on the rock,       Upon Life's shore,     'Gainst which the winds and waves can shock,       Oh, nevermore!      From tired joy and grief afar,       And nearer Thee,--     Father, where Thine own children are,       I love to be.      My prayer, some daily good to do       To Thine, for Thee;     An offering pure of Love, whereto       God leadeth me.     \"_FEED MY SHEEP_\"       Shepherd, show me how to go       O'er the hillside steep,     How to gather, how to sow,--       How to feed Thy sheep;     I will listen for Thy voice,       Lest my footsteps stray;     I will follow and rejoice       All the rugged way.      Thou wilt bind the stubborn will,       Wound the callous breast,     Make self-righteousness be still,       Break earth's stupid rest.     Strangers on a barren shore,       Lab'ring long and lone,     We would enter by the door,       And Thou know'st Thine own;      So, when day grows dark and cold,       Tear or triumph harms,     Lead Thy lambkins to the fold,       Take them in Thine arms;     Feed the hungry, heal the heart,       Till the morning's beam;     White as wool, ere they depart,       Shepherd, wash them clean.     _THE VALLEY CEMETERY_       Ye soft sighing zephyrs through foliage and vine!     Ye echoing moans from the footsteps of time!     Break not on the silence, unless thou canst bear     A message from heaven--\"No partings are there.\"      Here gloom hath enchantment in beauty's array,     And whispering voices are calling away--     Their wooings are soft as the vision more vain--     I would live in their empire, or die in their chain.      Here smileth the blossom and sunshine not dead--     Flowers fresh as the pang in the bosom that bled,--     Yes, constant as love that outliveth the grave,     And time cannot quench in oblivion's wave.      And thou, gentle cypress, in evergreen tears,     Art constant and hopeful though winter appears.     My heart hath thy verdure, it blossoms above;     Like thee, it endureth and liveth in love.      Ambition, come hither! These vaults will unfold     The sequel of power, of glory, or gold;     Then rush into life, and roll on with its tide,     And bustle and toil for its pomp and its pride.      The tired wings flitting through far crimson glow,     Which steepeth the trees when the day-god is low;     The voice of the night-bird must here send a thrill     To the heart of the leaves when the winds are all still.      'Mid graves do I hear the glad voices that swell,     And call to my spirit with seraphs to dwell;     They come with a breath from the verdant springtime,     And waken my joy, as in earliest prime.      Blest beings departed! Ye echoes at dawn!     O tell of their radiant home and its morn!     Then I'll think of its glory, and rest till I see     My loved ones in glory still waiting for me.     _UPWARD_       I've watched in the azure the eagle's proud wing,     His soaring majestic, and feathersome fling--     Careening in liberty higher and higher--     Like genius unfolding a quenchless desire.      Would a tear dim his eye, or pinion lose power     To gaze on the lark in her emerald bower?     When higher he soareth to compass his rest,     What vision so bright as the dream in his breast!      God's eye is upon him. He penciled his path     Whose omniscient notice the frail fledgling hath.     Though lightnings be lurid and earthquakes may shock,     He rides on the whirlwind or rests on the rock.      My course, like the eagle's, oh, still be it high,     Celestial the breezes that waft o'er its sky!     God's eye is upon me--I am not alone     When onward and upward and heavenward borne.      Written in early years.     _THE OAK ON THE MOUNTAIN'S SUMMIT_       Oh, mountain monarch, at whose feet I stand,--     Clouds to adorn thy brow, skies clasp thy hand,--     Nature divine, in harmony profound,     With peaceful presence hath begirt thee round.      And thou, majestic oak, from yon high place     Guard'st thou the earth, asleep in night's embrace,--     And from thy lofty summit, pouring down     Thy sheltering shade, her noonday glories crown?      Whate'er thy mission, mountain sentinel,     To my lone heart thou art a power and spell;     A lesson grave, of life, that teacheth me     To love the Hebrew figure of a tree.      Faithful and patient be my life as thine;     As strong to wrestle with the storms of time;     As deeply rooted in a soil of love;     As grandly rising to the heavens above.     _WOMAN'S RIGHTS_       Grave on her monumental pile;     She won from vice, by virtue's smile,     Her dazzling crown, her sceptered throne,     Affection's wreath, a happy home;      The right to worship deep and pure,     To bless the orphan, feed the poor;     Last at the cross to mourn her Lord,     First at the tomb to hear his word;      To fold an angel's wings below;     And hover o'er the couch of woe;     To nurse the Bethlehem babe so sweet,     The right to sit at Jesus' feet;      To form the bud for bursting bloom,     The hoary head with joy to crown;     In short, the right to work and pray,     \"To point to heaven and lead the way.\"      Lynn, Mass., _May 6, 1876_.     _THE NEW CENTURY_       Thou God-crowned, patient century,     Thine hour hath come! Eternity     Draws nigh--and, beckoning from above,     One hundred years, aflame with Love,     Again shall bid old earth good-by--     And, lo, the light! far heaven is nigh!     New themes seraphic, Life divine,     And bliss that wipes the tears of time     Away, will enter, when they may,     And bask in one eternal day.      'Tis writ on earth, on leaf and flower:     Love hath one race, one realm, one power.     Dear God! how great, how good Thou art     To heal humanity's sore heart;     To probe the wound, then pour the balm--     A life perfected, strong and calm.     The dark domain of pain and sin     Surrenders--Love doth enter in,     And peace is won, and lost is vice:     Right reigns, and blood was not its price.      Pleasant View, Concord, N. H., _January, 1901_.     _TO MY ABSENT BROTHER_       Dwells there a shadow on thy brow--       A look that years impart?     Does there a thought of vanished hours       Come ever o'er thy heart?      Or give those earnest eyes yet back       An image of the soul,     Mirrored in truth, in light and joy,       Above the world's control?      So may their gaze be ever fraught       With utterance deep and strong,     Yielding a holy strength to right,       A stern rebuke to wrong!      Thy soul, upborne on wisdom's wings,       In brighter morn will find     Life hath a higher recompense       Than just to please mankind.      Supreme and omnipresent God,       Guide him in wisdom's way!     Give peaceful triumph to the truth,       Bid error melt away!      Lynn, Mass., _November 8, 1866_.     _SIGNS OF THE HEART_      "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27370"],["title","Poems (#2)"],["body"," Come to me, joys of heaven!       Breathe through the summer air     A balm--the long-lost leaven       Dissolving death, despair!         O little heart,         To me thou art     A sign that never can depart.      Come to me, peace on earth!       From out life's billowy sea,--     A wave of welcome birth,--       The Life that lives in Thee!         O Love divine,         This heart of Thine     Is all I need to comfort mine.      Come when the shadows fall,       And night grows deeply dark;     The barren brood, O call       With song of morning lark;         And from above,         Dear heart of Love,     Send us thy white-winged dove.      Pleasant View, Concord, N. H., 1899.     _FLOWERS_       Mirrors of morn     Whence the dewdrop is born,     Soft tints of the rainbow and skies--     Sisters of song,     What a shadowy throng     Around you in memory rise!      Far do ye flee,     From your green bowers free,     Fair floral apostles of love,     Sweetly to shed     Fragrance fresh round the dead,     And breath of the living above.      Flowers for the brave--     Be he monarch or slave,     Whose heart bore its grief and is still!     Flowers for the kind--     Aye, the Christians who wind     Wreaths for the triumphs o'er ill!      Pleasant View, Concord, N. H., _May 21, 1904_.     _TO THE OLD YEAR--1865_           Pass on, returnless year!     The track behind thee is with glory crowned;     The turf where thou hast trod is holy ground.         Pass proudly to thy bier!          Chill was thy midnight day,     While Justice grasped the sword to hold her throne,     And on her altar our loved Lincoln's own         Great willing heart did lay.          Thy purpose hath been won!     Thou point'st thy phantom finger, grim and cold,     To the dark record of our guilt unrolled,         And smiling, say'st, \"'Tis done!          \"This record I will bear     To the dim chambers of eternity--     The chain and charter I have lived to see         Purged by the cannon's prayer;          \"Convulsion, carnage, war;     The pomp and tinsel of unrighteous power;     Bloated oppression in its awful hour,--         I, dying, dare abhor!\"          One word, receding year,     Ere thou grow tremulous with shadowy night!     Say, will the young year dawn with wisdom's light         To brighten o'er thy bier?          Or we the past forget,     And heal her wounds too tenderly to last?     Or let today grow difficult and vast         With traitors unvoiced yet?          Though thou must leave the tear,--     Hearts bleeding ere they break in silence yet,     Wrong jubilant and right with bright eye wet,--         Thou fast expiring year,          Thy work is done, and well:     Thou hast borne burdens, and may take thy rest,     Pillow thy head on time's untired breast.         Illustrious year, farewell!      Lynn, Mass., _January 1, 1866_.     _INVOCATION FOR 1868_       Father of every age,       Of every rolling sphere,     Help us to write a deathless page       Of truth, this dawning year!      Help us to humbly bow       To Thy all-wise behest--     Whate'er the gift of joy or woe,       Knowing Thou knowest best.      Aid our poor soul to sing       Above the tempest's glee;     Give us the eagle's fearless wing,       The dove's to soar to Thee!      All-merciful and good,       Hover the homeless heart!     Give us this day our daily food       In knowing what Thou art!      Swampscott, Mass., _January 1, 1868_.     _CHRISTMAS MORN_       Blest Christmas morn, though murky clouds         Pursue thy way,     Thy light was born where storm enshrouds         Nor dawn nor day!      Dear Christ, forever here and near,         No cradle song,     No natal hour and mother's tear,         To thee belong.      Thou God-idea, Life-encrowned,         The Bethlehem babe--     Beloved, replete, by flesh embound--         Was but thy shade!      Thou gentle beam of living Love,         And deathless Life!     Truth infinite,--so far above         All mortal strife,      Or cruel creed, or earth-born taint:         Fill us today     With all thou art--be thou our saint,         Our stay, alway.      _December, 1898._     _EASTER MORN_       Gently thou beckonest from the giant hills       The new-born beauty in the emerald sky,     And wakening murmurs from the drowsy rills--       O gladsome dayspring! 'reft of mortal sigh     To glorify all time--eternity--     With thy still fathomless Christ-majesty.      E'en as Thou gildest gladdened joy, dear God,       Give risen power to prayer; fan Thou the flame     Of right with might; and midst the rod,       And stern, dark shadows cast on Thy blest name,     Lift Thou a patient love above earth's ire,     Piercing the clouds with its triumphal spire.      While sacred song and loudest breath of praise       Echo amid the hymning spheres of light,--     With heaven's lyres and angels' loving lays,--       Send to the loyal struggler for the right,     Joy--not of time, nor yet by nature sown,     But the celestial seed dropped from Love's throne.      Prolong the strain \"Christ risen!\" Sad sense, annoy       No more the peace of Soul's sweet solitude!     Deep loneness, tear-filled tones of distant joy,       Depart! Glad Easter glows with gratitude--     Love's verdure veils the leaflet's wondrous birth--     Rich rays, rare footprints on the dust of earth.      Not life, the vassal of the changeful hour,       Nor burdened bliss, but Truth and Love attest     The solemn splendor of immortal power,--       The ever Christ, and glorified behest,     Poured on the sense which deems no suffering vain     That wipes away the sting of death--sin, pain.      Pleasant View, Concord, N. H., _April 18, 1900_.     _RESOLUTIONS FOR THE DAY_       To rise in the morning and drink in the view--       The home where I dwell in the vale,     The blossoms whose fragrance and charms ever new       Are scattered o'er hillside and dale;      To gaze on the sunbeams enkindling the sky--       A loftier life to invite--     A light that illumines my spiritual eye,       And inspires my pen as I write;      To form resolutions, with strength from on high,       Such physical laws to obey,     As reason with appetite, pleasures deny,       That health may my efforts repay;      To kneel at the altar of mercy and pray       That pardon and grace, through His Son,     May comfort my soul all the wearisome day,       And cheer me with hope when 'tis done;      To daily remember my blessings and charge,       And make this my humble request:     Increase Thou my faith and my vision enlarge,       And bless me with Christ's promised rest;      To hourly seek for deliverance strong       From selfishness, sinfulness, dearth,     From vanity, folly, and all that is wrong--       With ambition that binds us to earth;      To kindly pass over a wound, or a foe       (And mem'ry but part us awhile),     To breathe forth a prayer that His love I may know,       Whose mercies my sorrows beguile,--      If these resolutions are acted up to,       And faith spreads her pinions abroad,     'Twill be sweet when I ponder the days may be few       That waft me away to my God.      Written in girlhood.     _O FOR THY WINGS, SWEET BIRD!_       O for thy wings, sweet bird!       And soul of melody by being blest--     Like thee, my voice had stirred       Some dear remembrance in a weary breast.      But whither wouldst thou rove,       Bird of the airy wing, and fold thy plumes?     In what dark leafy grove       Wouldst chant thy vespers 'mid rich glooms?      Or sing thy love-lorn note--       In deeper solitude, where nymph or saint     Has wooed some mystic spot,       Divinely desolate the shrine to paint?      Yet wherefore ask thy doom?       Blessed compared with me thou art--     Unto thy greenwood home       Bearing no bitter memory at heart;      Wearing no earthly chain,       Thou canst in azure bright soar far above;     Nor pinest thou in vain       O'er joys departed, unforgotten love.      O take me to thy bower!       Beguile the lagging hours of weariness     With strain which hath strange power       To make me love thee as I love life less!      From mortal consciousness       Which binds to earth--infirmity of woe!     Or pining tenderness--       Whose streams will never dry or cease to flow;      An aching, voiceless void,       Hushed in the heart whereunto none reply,     And in the cringing crowd       Companionless! Bird, bear me through the sky!      Written more than sixty years ago for the _New Hampshire Patriot_.     _COME THOU_       Come, in the minstrel's lay;       When two hearts meet,       And true hearts greet,     And all is morn and May.      Come Thou! and now, anew,       To thought and deed       Give sober speed,     Thy will to know, and do.      Stay! till the storms are o'er--       The cold blasts done,       The reign of heaven begun,     And Love, the evermore.      Be patient, waiting heart:       Light, Love divine       Is here, and thine;     You therefore cannot part.      \"The seasons come and go:       Love, like the sea,       Rolls on with thee,--     But knows no ebb and flow.      \"Faith, hope, and tears, triune,       Above the sod       Find peace in God,     And one eternal noon.\"      Oh, Thou hast heard my prayer;       And I am blest!       This is Thy high behest:     Thou, here and _everywhere_.     _WISH AND ITEM_      To the editor of the _Item_, Lynn, Mass.       I hope the heart that's hungry       For things above the floor,     Will find within its portals       An item rich in store;      That melancholy mortals       Will count their mercies o'er,     And learn that Truth and wisdom       Have many items more;      That when a wrong is done us,       It stirs no thought of strife;     And Love becomes the substance,       As item, of our life;      That every ragged urchin,       With bare feet soiled or sore,     Share God's most"]]]
