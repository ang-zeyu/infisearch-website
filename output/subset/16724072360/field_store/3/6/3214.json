One day he called his son to his side and said to him:  \"Our island now seems peaceful enough, Inga, and we are happy and prosperous, but I cannot forget those terrible people of Regos and Coregos. My constant fear is that they will send a fleet of boats to search for those of their race whom we defeated many years ago, and whom the sea afterwards destroyed. If the warriors come in great numbers we may be unable to oppose them, for my people are little trained to fighting at best; they surely would cause us much injury and suffering.\"  \"Are we, then, less powerful than in my grandfather's day?\" asked Prince Inga.  The King shook his head thoughtfully.  \"It is not that,\" said he. \"That you may fully understand that marvelous battle, I must confide to you a great secret. I have in my possession three Magic Talismans, which I have ever guarded with utmost care, keeping the knowledge of their existence from anyone else. But, lest I should die and the secret be lost, I have decided to tell you what these talismans are and where they are hidden. Come with me, my son.\"  He led the way through the rooms of the palace until they came to the great banquet hall. There, stopping in the center of the room, he stooped down and touched a hidden spring in the tiled floor. At once one of the tiles sank downward and the King reached within the cavity and drew out a silken bag.  This bag he proceeded to open, showing Inga that it contained three great pearls, each one as big around as a marble. One had a blue tint and one was of a delicate rose color, but the third was pure white.  [Illustration]  \"These three pearls,\" said the King, speaking in a solemn, impressive voice, \"are the most wonderful the world has ever known. They were gifts to one of my ancestors from the Mermaid Queen, a powerful fairy whom he once had the good fortune to rescue from her enemies. In gratitude for this favor she presented him with these pearls. Each of the three possesses an astonishing power, and whoever is their owner may count himself a fortunate man. This one having the blue tint will give to the person who carries it a strength so great that no power can resist him. The one with the pink glow will protect its owner from all dangers that may threaten him, no matter from what source they may come. The third pearl--this one of pure white--can speak, and its words are always wise and helpful.\"  \"What is this, my father!\" exclaimed the Prince, amazed; \"do you tell me that a pearl can speak? It sounds impossible.\"  \"Your doubt is due to your ignorance of fairy powers,\" returned the King, gravely. \"Listen, my son, and you will know that I speak the truth.\"  He held the white pearl to Inga's ear and the Prince heard a small voice say distinctly: \"Your father is right. Never question the truth of what you fail to understand, for the world is filled with wonders.\"  \"I crave your pardon, dear father,\" said the Prince, \"for clearly I heard the pearl speak, and its words were full of wisdom.\"  \"The powers of the other pearls are even greater,\" resumed the King. \"Were I poor in all else, these gems would make me richer than any other monarch the world holds.\"  \"I believe that,\" replied Inga, looking at the beautiful pearls with much awe. \"But tell me, my father, why do you fear the warriors of Regos and Coregos when these marvelous powers are yours?\"  \"The powers are mine only while I have the pearls upon my person,\" answered King Kitticut, \"and I dare not carry them constantly for fear they might be lost. Therefore, I keep them safely hidden in this recess. My only danger lies in the chance that my watchmen might fail to discover the approach of our enemies and allow the warrior invaders to seize me before I could secure the pearls. I should, in that case, be quite powerless to resist. My father owned the magic pearls at the time of the Great Fight, of which you have so often heard, and the pink pearl protected him from harm, while the blue pearl enabled him and his people to drive away the enemy. Often have I suspected that the destroying storm was caused by the fairy mermaids, but that is a matter of which I have no proof.\"  \"I have often wondered how we managed to win that battle,\" remarked Inga thoughtfully. \"But the pearls will assist us in case the warriors come again, will they not?\"  \"They are as powerful as ever,\" declared the King. \"Really, my son, I have little to fear from any foe. But lest I die and the secret be lost to the next King, I have now given it into your keeping. Remember that these pearls are the rightful heritage of all Kings of Pingaree. If at any time I should be taken from you, Inga, guard this treasure well and do not forget where it is hidden.\"  \"I shall not forget,\" said Inga.  Then the King returned the pearls to their hiding place and the boy went to his own room to ponder upon the wonderful secret his father had that day confided to his care.  [Illustration]     The Coming of King Rinkitink  [Illustration]  CHAPTER 2   A few days after this, on a bright and sunny morning when the breeze blew soft and sweet from the ocean and the trees waved their leaf-laden branches, the Royal Watchman, whose duty it was to patrol the shore, came running to the King with news that a strange boat was approaching the island.  At first the King was sore afraid and made a step toward the hidden pearls, but the next moment he reflected that one boat, even if filled with enemies, would be powerless to injure him, so he curbed his fear and went down to the beach to discover who the strangers might be. Many of the men of Pingaree assembled there also, and Prince Inga followed his father. Arriving at the water's edge, they all stood gazing eagerly at the oncoming boat.  It was quite a big boat, they observed, and covered with a canopy of purple silk, embroidered with gold. It was rowed by twenty men, ten on each side. As it came nearer, Inga could see that in the stern, seated upon a high, cushioned chair of state, was a little man who was so very fat that he was nearly as broad as he was high. This man was dressed in a loose silken robe of purple that fell in folds to his feet, while upon his head was a cap of white velvet curiously worked with golden threads and having a circle of diamonds sewn around the band. At the opposite end of the boat stood an oddly shaped cage, and several large boxes of sandalwood were piled near the center of the craft.  As the boat approached the shore the fat little man got upon his feet and bowed several times in the direction of those who had assembled to greet him, and as he bowed he flourished his white cap in an energetic manner. His face was round as an apple and nearly as rosy. When he stopped bowing he smiled in such a sweet and happy way that Inga thought he must be a very jolly fellow.  The prow of the boat grounded on the beach, stopping its speed so suddenly that the little man was caught unawares and nearly toppled headlong into the sea. But he managed to catch hold of the chair with one hand and the hair of one of his rowers with the other, and so steadied himself. Then, again waving his jeweled cap around his head, he cried in a merry voice:  \"Well, here I am at last!\"  \"So I perceive,\" responded King Kitticut, bowing with much dignity.  The fat man glanced at all the sober faces before him and burst into a rollicking laugh. Perhaps I should say it was half laughter and half a chuckle of merriment, for the sounds he emitted were quaint and droll and tempted every hearer to laugh with him.  \"Heh, heh--ho, ho, ho!\" he roared. \"Didn't expect me, I see. Keek-eek-eek-eek! This is funny--it's really funny. Didn't know I was coming, did you? Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo! This is certainly amusing. But I'm here, just the same.\"  \"Hush up!\" said a deep, growling voice. \"You're making yourself ridiculous.\"  Everyone looked to see where this voice came from; but none could guess who had uttered the words of rebuke. The rowers of the boat were all solemn and silent and certainly no one on the shore had spoken. But the little man did not seem astonished in the least, or even annoyed.  King Kitticut now addressed the stranger, saying courteously:  \"You are welcome to the Kingdom of Pingaree. Perhaps you will deign to come ashore and at your convenience inform us whom we have the honor of receiving as a guest.\"  \"Thanks; I will,\" returned the little fat man, waddling from his place in the boat and stepping, with some difficulty, upon the sandy beach. \"I am King Rinkitink, of the City of Gilgad in the Kingdom of Rinkitink, and I have come to Pingaree to see for myself the monarch who sends to my city so many beautiful pearls. I have long wished to visit this island; and so, as I said before, here I am!\"  \"I am pleased to welcome you,\" said King Kitticut. \"But why has Your Majesty so few attendants? Is it not dangerous for the King of a great country to make distant journeys in one frail boat, and with but twenty men?\"  [Illustration]  \"Oh, I suppose so,\" answered King Rinkitink, with a laugh. \"But what else could I do? My subjects would not allow me to go anywhere at all, if they knew it. So I just ran away.\"  \"Ran away!\" exclaimed King Kitticut in surprise.  \"Funny, isn't it? Heh, heh, heh--woo, hoo!\" laughed Rinkitink, and this is as near as I can spell with letters the jolly sounds of his laughter. \"Fancy a King running away from his own people--hoo, hoo--keek, eek, eek, eek! But I had to, don't you see!\"  \"Why?\" asked the other King.  \"They're afraid I'll get into mischief. They don't trust me. Keek-eek-eek--Oh, dear me! Don't trust their own King. Funny, isn't it?\"  \"No harm can come to you on this island,\" said Kitticut, pretending not to notice the odd ways of his guest. \"And, whenever it pleases you to return to your own country, I will send with you a fitting escort of my own people. In the meantime, pray accompany me to my palace, where everything shall be done to make you"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25581"],["title","Rinkitink in Oz (#2)"],["body","and happy.\"  \"Much obliged,\" answered Rinkitink, tipping his white cap over his left ear and heartily shaking the hand of his brother monarch. \"I'm sure you can make me comfortable if you've plenty to eat. And as for being happy--ha, ha, ha, ha!--why, that's my trouble. I'm _too_ happy. But stop! I've brought you some presents in those boxes. Please order your men to carry them up to the palace.\"  \"Certainly,\" answered King Kitticut, well pleased, and at once he gave his men the proper orders.  \"And, by the way,\" continued the fat little King, \"let them also take my goat from his cage.\"  \"A goat!\" exclaimed the King of Pingaree.  \"Exactly; my goat Bilbil. I always ride him wherever I go, for I'm not at all fond of walking, being a trifle stout--eh, Kitticut?--a trifle stout! Hoo, hoo, hoo--keek, eek!\"  The Pingaree people started to lift the big cage out of the boat, but just then a gruff voice cried: \"Be careful, you villains!\" and as the words seemed to come from the goat's mouth the men were so astonished that they dropped the cage upon the sand with a sudden jar.  \"There! I told you so!\" cried the voice angrily. \"You've rubbed the skin off my left knee. Why on earth didn't you handle me gently?\"  \"There, there, Bilbil,\" said King Rinkitink soothingly; \"don't scold, my boy. Remember that these are strangers, and we their guests.\" Then he turned to Kitticut and remarked: \"You have no talking goats on your island, I suppose.\"  \"We have no goats at all,\" replied the King; \"nor have we any animals, of any sort, who are able to talk.\"  \"I wish my animal couldn't talk, either,\" said Rinkitink, winking comically at Inga and then looking toward the cage. \"He is very cross at times, and indulges in language that is not respectful. I thought, at first, it would be fine to have a talking goat, with whom I could converse as I rode about my city on his back; but--keek-eek-eek-eek!--the rascal treats me as if I were a chimney sweep instead of a King. Heh, heh, heh, keek, eek! A chimney sweep--hoo, hoo, hoo!--and me a King! Funny, isn't it?\" This last was addressed to Prince Inga, whom he chucked familiarly under the chin, to the boy's great embarrassment.  \"Why do you not ride a horse?\" asked King Kitticut.  \"I can't climb upon his back, being rather stout; that's why. Kee, kee, keek, eek!--rather stout--hoo, hoo, hoo!\" He paused to wipe the tears of merriment from his eyes and then added: \"But I can get on and off Bilbil's back with ease.\"  He now opened the cage and the goat deliberately walked out and looked about him in a sulky manner. One of the rowers brought from the boat a saddle made of red velvet and beautifully embroidered with silver thistles, which he fastened upon the goat's back. The fat King put his leg over the saddle and seated himself comfortably, saying:  \"Lead on, my noble host, and we will follow.\"  \"What! Up that steep hill?\" cried the goat. \"Get off my back at once, Rinkitink, or I won't budge a step.\"  \"But--consider, Bilbil,\" remonstrated the King. \"How am I to get up that hill unless I ride?\"  \"Walk!\" growled Bilbil.  \"But I'm too fat. Really, Bilbil, I'm surprised at you. Haven't I brought you all this distance so you may see something of the world and enjoy life? And now you are so ungrateful as to refuse to carry me! Turn about is fair play, my boy. The boat carried you to this shore, because you can't swim, and now you must carry me up the hill, because I can't climb. Eh, Bilbil, isn't that reasonable?\"  \"Well, well, well,\" said the goat, surlily, \"keep quiet and I'll carry you. But you make me very tired, Rinkitink, with your ceaseless chatter.\"  After making this protest Bilbil began walking up the hill, carrying the fat King upon his back with no difficulty whatever.  Prince Inga and his father and all the men of Pingaree were much astonished to overhear this dispute between King Rinkitink and his goat; but they were too polite to make critical remarks in the presence of their guests. King Kitticut walked beside the goat and the Prince followed after, the men coming last with the boxes of sandalwood.  When they neared the palace, the Queen and her maidens came out to meet them and the royal guest was escorted in state to the splendid throne room of the palace. Here the boxes were opened and King Rinkitink displayed all the beautiful silks and laces and jewelry with which they were filled. Every one of the courtiers and ladies received a handsome present, and the King and Queen had many rich gifts and Inga not a few. Thus the time passed pleasantly until the Chamberlain announced that dinner was served.  [Illustration]  Bilbil the goat declared that he preferred eating of the sweet, rich grass that grew abundantly in the palace grounds, and Rinkitink said that the beast could never bear being shut up in a stable; so they removed the saddle from his back and allowed him to wander wherever he pleased.  During the dinner Inga divided his attention between admiring the pretty gifts he had received and listening to the jolly sayings of the fat King, who laughed when he was not eating and ate when he was not laughing and seemed to enjoy himself immensely.  \"For four days I have lived in that narrow boat,\" said he, \"with no other amusement than to watch the rowers and quarrel with Bilbil; so I am very glad to be on land again with such friendly and agreeable people.\"  \"You do us great honor,\" said King Kitticut, with a polite bow.  \"Not at all--not at all, my brother. This Pingaree must be a wonderful island, for its pearls are the admiration of all the world; nor will I deny the fact that my kingdom would be a poor one without the riches and glory it derives from the trade in your pearls. So I have wished for many years to come here to see you, but my people said: No! Stay at home and behave yourself, or we'll know the reason why.'\"  \"Will they not miss Your Majesty from your palace at Gilgad?\" inquired Kitticut.  \"I think not,\" answered Rinkitink. \"You see, one of my clever subjects has written a parchment entitled 'How to be Good,' and I believed it would benefit me to study it, as I consider the accomplishment of being good one of the fine arts. I had just scolded severely my Lord High Chancellor for coming to breakfast without combing his eyebrows, and was so sad and regretful at having hurt the poor man's feelings that I decided to shut myself up in my own room and study the scroll until I knew how to be good--hee, heek, keek, eek, eek!--to be good! Clever idea, that, wasn't it? Mighty clever! And I issued a decree that no one should enter my room, under pain of my royal displeasure, until I was ready to come out. They're awfully afraid of my royal displeasure, although not a bit afraid of me. Then I put the parchment in my pocket and escaped through the back door to my boat--and here I am. Oo, hoo-hoo, keek-eek! Imagine the fuss there would be in Gilgad if my subjects knew where I am this very minute!\"  \"I would like to see that parchment,\" said the solemn-eyed Prince Inga, \"for if it indeed teaches one to be good it must be worth its weight in pearls.\"  \"Oh, it's a fine essay,\" said Rinkitink, \"and beautifully written with a goosequill. Listen to this: You'll enjoy it--tee, hee, hee!--enjoy it.\"  He took from his pocket a scroll of parchment tied with a black ribbon, and having carefully unrolled it, he proceeded to read as follows:  \"'A Good Man is One who is Never Bad.' How's that, eh? Fine thought, what? 'Therefore, in order to be Good, you must avoid those Things which are Evil.' Oh, hoo-hoo-hoo!--how clever! When I get back I shall make the man who wrote that a royal hippolorum, for, beyond question, he is the wisest man in my kingdom--as he has often told me himself.\" With this, Rinkitink lay back in his chair and chuckled his queer chuckle until he coughed, and coughed until he choked and choked until he sneezed. And he wrinkled his face in such a jolly, droll way that few could keep from laughing with him, and even the good Queen was forced to titter behind her fan.  When Rinkitink had recovered from his fit of laughter and had wiped his eyes upon a fine lace handkerchief, Prince Inga said to him:  \"The parchment speaks truly.\"  \"Yes, it is true beyond doubt,\" answered Rinkitink, \"and if I could persuade Bilbil to read it he would be a much better goat than he is now. Here is another selection: 'To avoid saying Unpleasant Things, always Speak Agreeably.' That would hit Bilbil, to a dot. And here is one that applies to you, my Prince: 'Good Children are seldom punished, for the reason that they deserve no punishment.' Now, I think that is neatly put, and shows the author to be a deep thinker. But the advice that has impressed me the most is in the following paragraph: 'You may not find it as Pleasant to be Good as it is to be Bad, but Other People will find it more Pleasant.' Haw-hoo-ho! keek-eek! 'Other people will find it more pleasant!'--hee, hee, heek, keek!--'more pleasant.' Dear me--dear me! Therein lies a noble incentive to be good, and whenever I get time I'm surely going to try it.\"  Then he wiped his eyes again with the lace handkerchief and, suddenly remembering his dinner, seized his knife and fork and began eating.     The Warriors from the North  [Illustration]  CHAPTER 3   King Rinkitink was so much pleased with the Island of Pingaree that he continued his stay day after day and week after week, eating good dinners, talking with King Kitticut and sleeping. Once in a while he would read from his scroll. \"For,\" said he, \"whenever I return home, my subjects will be anxious to know if I have learned 'How to be Good,' and I must not disappoint them.\"  The twenty rowers lived on the small end of the island, with the pearl fishers, and seemed not to care whether they ever returned to the Kingdom of Rinkitink or not. Bilbil the goat wandered over the grassy slopes, or among the trees, and passed his days exactly as he pleased. His master seldom cared to ride him."]]]
