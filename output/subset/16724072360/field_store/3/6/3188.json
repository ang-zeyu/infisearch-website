CHAPTER II  THE COVE AND CAVE   The starboard boat was lowered into the water. First the mate, then Captain Broom and two men got in. The latter were Cales and Pete who pulled noiselessly at the oars. The boat glided quietly through the silent darkness towards the shore. The Captain was seated in the stern, his great bulk crouched forward, but there was nothing inert in his posture. His big hands clasped either side of the craft.  In a few minutes the boat grounded softly on the sand of the beach and all hands got ashore. Scarcely a word was spoken, though the cove was so hidden that there seemed to be no possible chance that the landing of the free-booters would be observed. However, Captain Bill Broom took no risk of being discovered. He had many enemies upon the coast and inland as well. Besides, the State of California had set a price upon his head.  Two thousand dollars was the reward for his capture, and so profitable an investment was apt to be realized on sooner or later by some enterprising citizen. So Captain Broom took due care whenever he went abroad not to attract undue attention.  This cove was a favorite lurking place of his when close pressed, where he would take refuge after some daring adventure upon the high seas, until such a time as the hubbub along the coast had died down. Sometimes he lay in hiding there, with the Sea Eagle screened behind the encircling cliffs, waiting like a black spider to rush out and capture some unsuspecting craft.  \"Pick her up, boys,\" said the Captain, \"you know where she belongs,\" pointing to the boat.  \"Aye, aye, sir,\" they replied, and putting it on their shoulders they carried the boat along a narrow path that divided the thick undergrowth; until, after going several hundred yards, they reached a thick screen of brush through which they shoved, and came to a cave.  Although so well hidden, the entrance to the cavern was quite high, so that the men gained admission without stooping, and going a short distance into the dark interior, they placed the boat gently down against the wall. There was a constant and heavy drip of water, so that there was no chance for the boat to warp, as it would have surely done if placed outside in the dry California air.  \"I don't like this yere cave,\" remarked Pete, when left alone with Cales.  \"What's the matter with it? It's dark and damp, but that is the nature of caves.\"  \"It makes me feel creepy, that's all,\" replied Pete, \"and it takes considerable to do that.\"  \"Whatever happened?\" inquired Cales, grinning, \"something terrible, I reckon, to make your thick hide chilly.\"  \"It were before your time,\" replied Pete somewhat reluctantly, \"we raided a ranch back thar agin the mountings. Senor Sebastian owned it and it was said that he could ride all day and never git off his place, and that he had more sheep and cattle than thar is folks in Frisco.\"  \"The Captain shanghied him, I reckon,\" cut in Cales.  \"You hold your windlass,\" commanded the old man in a querulous tone, \"I'm telling this yarn.\"  \"All right, Pop,\" said Cales in a conciliating manner, \"have it yer own way.\" He was really anxious to hear the story the old man had referred to.  \"Young fry is always flapping,\" the older speaker mumbled,--then he took up the course of his narrative. \"Waal, as I was telling ye, this Senor had lots of money and the Cap'n being short of funds thought that he could use some of it. So one night we ran into the cove, it was blacker even than this. I don't see how the old man ever got the craft past the sharks' teeth at the entrance but he did.\"  \"He could have brought her in with his eyes shut,\" declared Cales. \"I never have seen his equal for navigating.\"  \"Waal, we made camp here that night, and the next day, the Cap'n with some of the gang, left for the ranch and I stayed to look after things. Nothing happened that day, and I was dozing by the fire about midnight when I heard them coming back. They had the Senor, a fine-looking old man with a gray mustache and as cold and proud-looking as they make them.  \"The Cap'n was furious because he had not been able to lay his hand on the coin, and he swore that he would make the old Senor tell where his money was or there would be trouble. He took him into this cave and I don't know what happened there, and I don't want to know. All I'm sure of is that I never saw him come out.  \"The Cap'n sent me to the ship to get some chains on the second day and he took 'em into the cave. We sailed a couple of days later, but not a sign did I see of the Senor. That's why this cave makes me creepy, Cales.\"  They were standing near the entrance, when there came a distinct low moan from the interior. It was not a ghostly sound, either. There was no mistaking it.  \"Did you hear that, Cales?\" asked old Pete in a quavering voice.  \"Yes,\" replied Cales, \"I heard it all right. It can't be the Senor?\"  \"No,\" replied Pete. \"He has been dead these years.\"  \"Let's find out,\" said his comrade.  \"There's nothing in this world could make me go in thar,\" declared Pete solemnly, \"besides, it's agin the Captain's orders.\"  \"Well, I'm going,\" said Cales either more brave or less experienced than the other. \"It sounds to me like a woman's voice.\"  \"And I'm goin' to git,\" declared old Pete, tottering towards the path.  \"You're a brave old pirate,\" said Cales contemptuously, and with that he went slowly back into the cave. He had to go cautiously, for beyond a certain point he was not acquainted with the interior. He could feel the moist ground under foot and he kept his hand stretched out, not knowing what he might run against in the dense damp darkness.  Then, suddenly, his hand struck a stone wall. Groping his way, he turned a sharp corner and followed along a low narrow passageway that obliged him to stoop. Then came the sound of the moaning just ahead. Jack Cales was a brave man but it was all that he could do, to keep from turning and running in panic for the mouth of the cave. But though his determination had received a severe shock, it did not turn to flight.  He saw a faint light ahead, spreading a glow at the end of the passage as he came nearer. Then he saw something that held him stone still with a clutch of weird fear. He had reached the end of the narrow passage, and dimly made out a domed room in the rock, white with translucent encrustation.  He struck a match. About him, before, to the right and to the left he could see forms all of ghostly white, some crouching, others standing. Hardly had the light flared up than it sizzled out. Some drops of water falling from the roof had extinguished the blaze. Then was repeated that awful sound of distress.  Cales groped around almost in a frenzy of terror. Where was the exit from that awful room? Round and round he went, and all the time there were strange whisperings in his ears, and unseen hands seemed to clutch his clothes. Once he slipped and was trembling so that he was hardly able to get to his feet. Just as he did so, something swept past him like a breath of wind. Rendered desperate he made another dash, and this time if he had not found a passageway, he felt that he could have knocked a hole through the wall. Then he stood at the mouth of the cave.     CHAPTER III  THE BARBED WIRE   Just at that moment was heard the hoarse voice of Captain Broom booming through the darkness outside.  As Cales turned about, some furry animal sprang past him dashing between his legs and nearly upsetting him.  \"On deck, you scoundrel, come out of there,\" called the Captain.  \"Aye, aye, sir,\" came the reply of Cales in a strangely weak tone, though he was now more concerned by the possible penalty to be meted out by the Captain for disobedience of orders, than by thought of the undetermined occupants of the cave. If it were a cat it was certainly a good joke on old Pete. This was, had they but known it, the swift solution of the mystery.  Oddly enough the Captain said not another word, a fact suggestive to Cales that there was something amiss in the cave and the little company at once took up their line of march. Captain Broom was in the lead, followed by the mate, then Cales, with old Pete bringing up the rear. Just as they started Captain Broom extinguished the lantern and they took up the trail in total darkness. Every precaution would now be necessary for they would soon be in a region where the very name of Broom was execrated with bitter hatred, and every bush would grow a poniard if his whereabouts were known.  It was evident that the skipper was as good a guide on land as he was a pilot at sea, for he led his little party at a steady gait by a winding cow-path through the thick undergrowth. He doubtless knew this region thoroughly, for he had made more than one raid in this locality.  It was soon to be determined, however, that they were not the only ones abroad that night.  They had walked in silence for some time, well on to two hours, when they came to an open space, with the irregular form of a live oak on the southeast corner. Then Captain Broom stopped suddenly, his keen eyesight which no darkness could baffle had discerned some object moving out from the shelter of the oak tree.  It came slowly with uplifted black arms and white hair falling around its face. There was a terrible intensity in its advance across the open space, withal that it moved so slowly. The figure stopped directly in front of Captain Broom.  \"Get out of my way, you hag,\" he roared, but for the first time in his life a certain tremor crept into his voice. Perhaps he was growing old. He drew back his arm as though to strike the woman in his path.  As he did so Jack Cales stooped and picked up a round rock at his feet, intending to hurl it, not at the woman but at the skipper, for he alone of the party divined the possible cause of this poor woman's dementia. But his interference was not necessary for it seemed as though the Captain's arm was paralyzed. He declared afterwards that some"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25473"],["title","Frontier Boys on the Coast; Or, In the Pirate's Power (#2)"],["body","hand had seized his arm.  Then, in a loud, wailing voice the woman put a curse upon the slayer of her husband, for this spectre was none other than the Senora Sebastian. It was terrible to hear her and it must have sent a shiver into the soul of the hardy skipper.  When she had finished, the woman moved past them and vanished in the direction of the ranch. For a full minute the line of men stood without moving a step and in absolute silence, Captain Broom with his arm upraised as he had lifted it to strike.  Then, without saying a word, he took the first forward step and the others followed him through the darkness.  \"Say, Cales,\" growled Pete in a low voice, \"what was it you found in that cave? My old timbers are shaking yet.\"  \"Keep your old jaws shut,\" yelled the Captain, who had wonderfully keen hearing, when anything was spoken that concerned him.  \"How do you suppose the old man heard me?\" mumbled Pete to himself. He dropped back a pace or two, then whispered, \"The old man must be crazy. He is making direct for the Sebastian ranch.\"  \"Do you reckon that these four boys he is looking after, are located there?\" asked Jack.  \"I dunno,\" replied Pete, \"you can calkerlate on one thing though and that is that the skipper knows pretty nigh where those lads are. One of his messengers, a one-eyed, twisted greaser, came aboard the other day, and was gabbling in the Captain's cabin. Then the next thing I knew we was under sail, and came kiting down to the cove.\"  Just then the party halted at the confines of a four strand barbed wire fence. This was the first indication that they were entering the great ranch property that formerly belonged to the Senor Sebastian, the elderly man the Captain had made captive, and which was now the property of his only son.  \"Now, lads,\" said the leader of the expedition, \"Here's a chance to make yourself small. This yere barb is like a devil fish if it once gits a holt of your panties--it won't let go.\"  \"That's so, Captain,\" said the mate, a generally silent and saturnine man.  \"I reckon you know, mate,\" said the Captain. \"The last time we was through these parts, and that some considerable years ago, this same fence got a holt of yer pants and wouldn't let go. I never heard you talk so much and so earnestly in my life before. You want to be more keerful this time.\"  The mate simply grunted by way of reply and, lying close to the ground, he very gingerly and carefully worked his way under the wire and thus escaped his mentioned former unpleasant detention. He then held the lower wire up as high as he could until his chief had wiggled under.  Pete was the only one of the party who was seriously detained, for Jack Cales had slid under as slick as an eel. But Pete's joints were old and rusty and the venomous wire got a clutch on his coat and his pants.  \"What's keeping you back?\" inquired the Captain, gruffly, as Cales and his comrade did not put in an immediate appearance.  \"Pete has got caught, sir,\" said Jack.  \"What are you doing there, you old barnacle?\" inquired the Captain as he came back to the fence.  There was a certain odd comradeship between the skipper and the old salt who had been with him since his African days. Both were New Englanders and had come from neighboring homesteads.  \"Just resting, sir,\" replied the captive.  It certainly did have something of that appearance, for Pete had kept a decisive grip on his old black pipe with his stubby teeth and was puffing at it in apparent peace and resignation.  \"Want me to git you a piller?\" inquired the skipper, sarcastically.  \"Thank ye, sir,\" replied Pete imperturbably.  Meanwhile the mate had been at work with deft fingers and he finally succeeded in extricating the old man and putting him upon his pins.  \"Now if ye are sufficiently rested,\" proposed the skipper, \"we will hike along.\"  This they did. Their way now lay between two stretches of fence that enclosed a road not much traveled for there were only faint traces of wheels in the turf. It was probably not a public highway but belonged to the great ranch.  Everything seemed smooth sailing now, as there was no more barbed wire to be immediately met but Pete soon made himself prominent again. He was rolling along with that gait peculiar to a sailor when aboard land, when he gave a sudden spring and clutched Cales convulsively in the back, giving that individual a big scare.  \"Dad burn it, boys. I've stepped on a rattler.\" An investigation was made very carefully and Captain Broom quickly picked up a short piece of rope.  \"I'll rattle you,\" he cried, touching up the old man with the rope's end.     CHAPTER IV  PETE'S YARN   They went along steadily through the darkness in an almost directly easterly direction. Being now clear of the brush they could make good time on the springy turf.  \"How far are we now from the ranch, Pete?\" inquired Jack.  \"Too durn close to suit me,\" replied Pete. \"I can't tell exactly for these ranches are as big as all outside creation, but I guess we must be as close as a mile to the buildings.\"  \"I reckon the Captain is going to walk up to the front door and ask for accommodations.\"  \"Wouldn't s'prise me a bit, if he done that,\" replied Pete querulously. \"The old man ain't lacking in nerve. Back thar was the first time I ever seen him hang back in my long experience with him.\"  \"When the old lady was speaking her piece? Suppose I ask him how much he made when he captured the Senor,\" suggested Cales, who had recovered his flippant humor.  \"I wouldn't git gay, lad,\" said old Pete, warningly. \"She is just as liable to haunt you in your black spells.\"  \"Don't have 'em, uncle,\" replied Cales.  \"You collect the material for 'em when you are young,\" said the old man wisely, \"and they come out of your bones like rheumatiz when you git old.\"  \"Somebody is coming back of us,\" suddenly whispered Cales.  \"Take to cover, lads,\" ordered the skipper, who was as quick to hear as the younger man. The only cover was a high and thick growth of wild mustard growing alongside the fences.  Quickly they stepped from the open road into the shelter of the tall mustard. They had not long to wait. There was the jingle of spurs and the thud of horses' feet walking slowly along. Next came the voices of men talking.  \"It is useless, Senor, to try and find her, I fear,\" replied one man to the other.  \"It seems so,\" replied the other sadly. \"My mother always seems to be worse when the time of the year approaches that my father disappeared. In spite of all our care she will escape.\"  They had now arrived at a point opposite where the free-booters were hidden. The man who had last spoken struck a light and lit a cigarette; the instantaneous glare showed the dark handsome face of the Spanish type. There was the high-peaked sombrero, the striking clothes, the intent face and then the light died suddenly out.  \"Ah, Manuel,\" said the young man to his companion, \"if I could only once lay hands on that cursed Gringo,\" and he ground his teeth in fury, unable to express himself.  \"Humph, Gringo,\" grunted the Captain, disdainfully.  \"Did you hear anything, Senor?\" asked Manuel.  \"Nothing.\"  \"I was sure I heard something,\" asserted his companion. They had reined in their horses and sat listening quietly for a few seconds.  \"It was probably nothing but a calf by the roadside,\" said the Senor.  The other shook his head doubtfully, then they turned and rode on towards the rancho.  When they were safely out of range, the party of pirates took up their line of march once more.  \"So the greaser took me for a calf,\" remarked Captain Broom. \"If it had been you, Jack Cales, there might be some excuse fer such a mistake.\"  \"Aye, sir,\" replied Cales, glumly.  \"Getting kind of close to the ranch, ain't you, Cap'n?\" ventured old Pete.  \"I thought of leaving you there, Pete, while the rest of us corralled those kids. You are getting too old for these long tramps.\"  No more remarks were heard coming from the direction of Pete, for he was not at all sure but that the Captain might, in a moment of irresponsible humor, do just as he threatened without regard to the consequences.  After they had gone on for a mile from the point where the two men had overtaken them, Captain Broom led his party away from the road in a southerly direction, once more undergoing the harrowing experience of getting through the barbed wire fence. But this time Jack Cales was especially detailed by the Captain to get old Pete through so there would not be any unnecessary delay.  It was evident that they were getting into a different section, a short time after they left the road, for they began going up and winding among little rocky hills. At last they came to a stopping place. They climbed up an elevation and sat on some rocks among a group of dark trees.  \"Now, lads, take it easy,\" said the Captain, \"ye have had quite a footin' and when morning comes, there will be some more ahead and at a faster gait.\"  \"Gosh, Cap'n,\" declared old Pete, \"It's the most walking we've done together since the time we corralled the last bunch of niggers on the west coast of Africa.\"  \"We certainly made money that trip when we sold that cargo of coons to the traders on that Palmetto Island below Charleston. But we will clean up about as much money when we round up those four boys and twice as easy. Tell the two lads about that trip, Pete.\"  The old sailor sat on a rock, and taking out his bag of tobacco filled his short black pipe with one thorny thumb, then he commenced his narrative, with the glow of his pipe lighting up his weatherbeaten face.  \"Well, orders is orders, and the Cap'n wants me to tell this yarn. I might just as well begin it, lads. I never knew any good to come to sailormen cruising around on dry land any more than on this trip.\" He cast a wary eye at Captain Broom, but that worthy merely grunted and Pete resumed his story.  \"Our clipper lay at anchor in a wide bay with only a couple of men on board and the Captain, myself"]]]
