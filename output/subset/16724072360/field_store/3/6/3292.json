And if you're being illegal about it, one of the first things you tell him to do is to forget he's ever been sprayed. This goop is designed for the specific purpose of knocking out hypnotic commands. Just roll up your sleeve like a good girl now, and I'll rub a little of it on your arm.\"  \"You're not rubbing anything on my arm, mister!\" Duomart told him coldly.  Dasinger shrugged resignedly, recapped the tube, and dropped it in his pocket. \"Have it your way then,\" he remarked. \"I was only ...\"  He lunged suddenly towards her.  Duomart gave him quite a struggle. A minute or two later, he had her down on the floor, her body and one arm clamped between his knees, while he unzipped the cuff on the sleeve of the other arm and pulled the sleeve up. He brought out the tube of antihypno ointment and rubbed a few drops of the ointment into the hollow of Duomart's elbow, put the tube back in his pocket, then went on holding her down for nearly another minute. She was gasping for breath, blue eyes furious, muscles tensed.         *       *       *       *       *  Suddenly he felt her relax. An expression of stunned surprise appeared on her face. \"Why,\" she began incredulously, \"he _did_ ...\"  \"Gave you the spray treatment, eh?\" Dasinger said, satisfied. \"I was pretty sure he had.\"  \"Why, that-- At his beck and call, he says! Well, we'll just see about ... let me up, Dasinger! Just wait till I get my hands on that bony partner of yours!\"  \"Now take it easy.\"  \"Take it easy! Why should I? I ...\"  \"It would be better,\" Dasinger explained, \"if Egavine believes you're still under the influence.\"  She scowled up at him; then her face turned thoughtful. \"Ho! You feel it isn't that he's a depraved old goat, that he's got something more sinister in mind?\"  \"It's a definite possibility. Why not wait and find out? The ointment will immunize you against further tricks.\"  Miss Mines regarded him consideringly for a few seconds, then nodded. \"All right! You can let me up now. What do you think he's planning?\"  \"Not easy to say with Dr. Egavine. He's a devious man.\" Dasinger got himself disentangled, came to his feet, and reached down to help her scramble up.  \"They certainly wrap you up with that hypno stuff, don't they!\" she observed wonderingly.  Dasinger nodded. \"They certainly do!\" Then he added, \"I'm keeping the doctor and his little sidekick locked up, too, until we get to the planet. That leaves you and me with the run of the ship.\"  Duomart looked at him. \"So it does,\" she agreed.  \"Know how to use a gun?\"  \"Of course. But I'm not allow-- I don't have one with me on this trip.\"         *       *       *       *       *  He reached into his coat, took out a small gun in a fabric holster. Duomart glanced at it, then her eyes went back to his face.  \"Might clip it to your belt,\" Dasinger said. \"It's a good little shocker, fifty-foot range, safe for shipboard use. It's got a full load, eighty shots. We may or may not run into emergencies. If we don't, you'll still be more comfortable carrying it.\"  Duomart holstered the gun and attached the holster to her belt. She slid the tip of her tongue reflectively out between her lips, drew it back, blinked at the flight screens for a few seconds, then looked across at Dasinger and tapped the holster at her side.  \"That sort of changes things, too!\" she said.  \"Changes what?\"  \"Tell you in a minute. Sit down, Dasinger. Manual course corrections coming up....\" She slid into the pilot seat, moved her hands out over the controls, and appeared to forget about him.  Dasinger settled into a chair to her left, lit a cigarette, smoked and watched her, glancing occasionally at the screens. She was jockeying the Mooncat deftly in and out of the fringes of a gravitic stress knot, presently brought it into the clear, slapped over a direction lever and slid the palm of her right hand along a row of speed control buttons depressing them in turn.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Nice piece of piloting,\" Dasinger observed.  Duomart lifted one shoulder in a slight shrug. \"That's my job.\" Her face remained serious. \"Are you wondering why I edged us through that thing instead of going around it?\"  \"Uh-huh, a little,\" Dasinger admitted.  \"It knocked half an hour off the time it should take us to get to your planet,\" she said. \"That is, if you'll still want to go there. We're being followed, you see.\"  \"By whom?\"  \"They call her the Spy. After the Mooncat she's the fastest job in the Fleet. She's got guns, and her normal complement is twenty armed men.\"  \"The idea being to have us lead them to what we're after, and then take it away from us?\" Dasinger asked.  \"That's right. I'm not supposed to know about it. You know what a Gray Fleet is?\"  Dasinger nodded. \"An Independent that's turned criminal.\"  \"Yes. Willata's Fleet was a legitimate outfit up to four years ago. Then Liu Taunus and Calat and their gang took over. That happened to be the two Fleet bosses you slapped handcuffs on, Dasinger. We're a Gray Fleet now. So I had some plans of my own for this trip. If I can get to some other I-Fleet or to the Hub, I might be able to do something about Taunus. After we were down on the planet, I was going to steal the Mooncat and take off by myself.\"  \"Why are you telling me?\"  Miss Mines colored a little. \"Well, you gave me the gun,\" she said. \"And you clobbered Taunus, and got me out of that hypno thing ... I mean, I'd have to be pretty much of a jerk to ditch you now, wouldn't I? Anyway, now that I've told you, you won't be going back to Willata's Fleet, whatever you do. I'll still get to the Hub.\" She paused. \"So what do you want to do now? Beat it until the coast's clear, or make a quick try for your loot before the Spy gets there?\"  \"How far is she behind us?\" Dasinger asked.  Duomart said, \"I don't know exactly. Here's what happened. When we started out, Taunus told me not to let the Mooncat travel at more than three-quarters speed for any reason. I figured then the Spy was involved in whatever he was planning; she can keep up with us at that rate, and she has considerably better detector reach than the Cat. She's stayed far enough back not to register on our plates throughout the trip.  \"Late yesterday we hit some extensive turbulence areas, and I started playing games. There was this little cluster of three sun systems ahead. One of them was our target, though Dr. Egavine hadn't yet said which. I ducked around a few twisters, doubled back, and there was the Spy coming the other way. I beat it then--top velocity. The Spy dropped off our detectors two hours later, and she can't have kept us on for more than another hour herself.  \"So they'll assume we're headed for one of those three systems, but they don't know which one. They'll have to look for us. There's only one terraprox in the system we're going to. There may be none in the others, or maybe four or five. But the terraprox worlds is where they'll look because the salvage suits you're carrying are designed for ordinary underwater work. After the way I ran from them, they'll figure something's gone wrong with Taunus's plans, of course.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Dasinger rubbed his chin. \"And if they're lucky and follow us straight in to the planet?\"  \"Then,\" Miss Mines said, \"you might still have up to six or seven hours to locate the stuff you want, load it aboard and be gone again.\"  \"Might have?\"  She shrugged. \"We've got a lead on them, but just how big a lead we finally wind up with depends to a considerable extent on the flight conditions they run into behind us. They might get a break there, too. Then there's another very unfortunate thing. The system Dr. Egavine's directed us to now is the one we were closest to when I broke out of detection range. They'll probably decide to look there first. You see?\"  \"Yes,\" Dasinger said. \"Not so good, is it?\" He knuckled his jaw again reflectively. \"Why was Taunus pounding around on you when I came forward?\"  \"Oh, those two runches caught me flying the ship at top speed. Taunus was furious. He couldn't know whether the Spy still had a fix on us or not. Of course he didn't tell me that. The lumps he was preparing to hand out were to be for disregarding his instructions. He does things like that.\" She paused. \"Well, are you going to make a try for the planet?\"  \"Yes,\" Dasinger said. \"If we wait, there's entirely too good a chance the Spy will run across what we're after while she's snooping around for us there. We'll try to arrange things for a quick getaway in case our luck doesn't hold up.\"  Duomart nodded. \"Mind telling me what you're after?\"  \"Not at all. Under the circumstances you should be told....         *       *       *       *       *  \"Of course,\" Dasinger concluded a minute or two later, \"all we'll have a legal claim to is the salvage fee.\"  Miss Mines glanced over at him, looking somewhat shaken. \"You _are_ playing this legally?\"  \"Definitely.\"  \"Even so,\" she said, \"if that really is the wreck of the Dosey Asteroids raider, and the stones are still on board ... you two will collect something like ten million credits between you!\"  \"Roughly that,\" Dasinger agreed. \"Dr. Egavine learned about the matter from one of your Willata Fleetmen.\"  Her eyes widened. \"He what!\"  \"The Fleet lost a unit called Handing's Scout about four years ago, didn't it?\"  \"Three and a half,\" she said. She paused. \"Handing's Scout is the other wreck down there?\"  \"Yes. There was one survivor ... as far as we know. You may recall his name. Leed Farous.\"  Duomart nodded. \"The little kwil hound.

The Septuagint does not hesitate to call her [Greek], that is to say, a ventriloquist, implying that it was she who spoke--and this view of the matter is in harmony with the fact that the exact sense of the Hebrew words which are translated as \"a woman that hath a familiar spirit\" is \"a woman mistress of _Ob._\" _Ob_ means primitively a leather bottle, such as a wine skin, and is applied alike to the necromancer and to the spirit evoked. Its use, in these senses, appears to have been suggested by the likeness of the hollow sound emitted by a half-empty skin when struck, to the sepulchral tones in which the oracles of the evoked spirits were uttered by the medium. It is most probable that, in accordance with the general theory of spiritual influences which obtained among the old Israelites, the spirit of Samuel was conceived to pass into the body of the wise woman, and to use her vocal organs to speak in his own name--for I cannot discover that they drew any clear distinction between possession and inspiration. [4]  If the story of Saul's consultation of the occult powers is to be regarded as an authentic narrative, or, at any rate, as a statement which is perfectly veracious so far as the intention of the narrator goes--and, as I have said, I see no reason for refusing it this character--it will be found, on further consideration, to throw a flood of light, both directly and indirectly, on the theology of Saul's countrymen--that is to say, upon their beliefs respecting the nature and ways of spiritual beings.  Even without the confirmation of other abundant evidences to the same effect, it leaves no doubt as to the existence, among them, of the fundamental doctrine that man consists of a body and of a spirit, which last, after the death of the body, continues to exist as a ghost. At the time of Saul's visit to Endor, Samuel was dead and buried; but that his spirit would be believed to continue to exist in Sheol may be concluded from the well-known passage in the song attributed to Hannah, his mother:--       Jahveh killeth and maketh alive;      He bringeth down to Sheol and bringeth up.                                   (1 Sam. ii. 6.)  And it is obvious that this Sheol was thought to be a place underground in which Samuel's spirit had been disturbed by the necromancer's summons, and in which, after his return thither, he would be joined by the spirits of Saul and his sons when they had met with their bodily death on the hill of Gilboa. It is further to be observed that the spirit, or ghost, of the dead man presents itself as the image of the man himself--it is the man, not merely in his ordinary corporeal presentment (even down to the prophet's mantle) but in his moral and intellectual characteristics. Samuel, who had begun as Saul's friend and ended as his bitter enemy, gives it to be understood that he is annoyed at Saul's presumption in disturbing him; and that, in Sheol, he is as much the devoted servant of Jahveh and as much empowered to speak in Jahveh's name as he was during his sojourn in the upper air.  It appears now to be universally admitted that, before the exile, the Israelites had no belief in rewards and punishments after death, nor in anything similar to the Christian heaven and hell; but our story proves that it would be an error to suppose that they did not believe in the continuance of individual existence after death by a ghostly simulacrum of life. Nay, I think it would be very hard to produce conclusive evidence that they disbelieved in immortality; for I am not aware that there is anything to show that they thought the existence of the souls of the dead in Sheol ever came to an end. But they do not seem to have conceived that the condition of the souls in Sheol was in any way affected by their conduct in life. If there was immortality, there was no state of retribution in their theology. Samuel expects Saul and his sons to come to him in Sheol.  The next circumstance to be remarked is that the name of _Elohim_ is applied to the spirit which the woman sees \"coming up out of the earth,\" that is to say, from Sheol. The Authorised Version translates this in its literal sense \"gods.\" The Revised Version gives \"god\" with \"gods\" in the margin. Reuss renders the word by \"spectre,\" remarking in a note that it is not quite exact; but that the word Elohim expresses \"something divine, that is to say, superhuman, commanding respect and terror\" (\"Histoire des Israelites,\" p. 321). Tuch, in his commentary on Genesis, and Thenius, in his commentary on Samuel, express substantially the same opinion. Dr. Alexander (in Kitto's \"Cyclopaedia\" s. v. \"God\") has the following instructive remarks:--     [_Elohim_ is] sometimes used vaguely to describe unseen    powers or superhuman beings that are not properly thought of as    divine. Thus the witch of Endor saw \"Elohim ascending out of the    earth\" (1 Sam. xxviii. 13), meaning thereby some beings of an    unearthly, superhuman character. So also in Zechariah xii. 8, it    is said \"the house of David shall be as Elohim, as the angel of    the Lord,\" where, as the transition from Elohim to the angel of    the Lord is a minori ad majus, we must regard the former as a    vague designation of supernatural powers.  Dr. Alexander speaks here of \"beings\"; but there is no reason to suppose that the wise woman of Endor referred to anything but a solitary spectre; and it is quite clear that Saul understood her in this sense, for he asks \"What form is HE of?\"  This fact, that the name of Elohim is applied to a ghost, or disembodied soul, conceived as the image of the body in which it once dwelt, is of no little importance. For it is well known that the same term was employed to denote the gods of the heathen, who were thought to have definite quasi-corporeal forms and to be as much real entities as any other Elohim. [5] The difference which was supposed to exist between the different Elohim was one of degree, not one of kind. Elohim was, in logical terminology, the genus of which ghosts, Chemosh, Dagon, Baal, and Jahveh were species. The Israelite believed Jahveh to be immeasurably superior to all other kinds of Elohim. The inscription on the Moabite stone shows that King Mesa held Chemosh to be, as unquestionably, the superior of Jahveh. But if Jahveh was thus supposed to differ only in degree from the undoubtedly zoomorphic or anthropomorphic \"gods of the nations,\" why is it to be assumed that he also was not thought of as having a human shape? It is possible for those who forget that the time of the great prophetic writers is at least as remote from that of Saul as our day is from that of Queen Elizabeth, to insist upon interpreting the gross notions current in the earlier age and among the mass of the people by the refined conceptions promulgated by a few select spirits centuries later. But if we take the language constantly used concerning the Deity in the books of Genesis, Exodus, Joshua, Judges, Samuel, or Kings, in its natural sense (and I am aware of no valid reason which can be given for taking it in any other sense), there cannot, to my mind, be a doubt that Jahveh was conceived by those from whom the substance of these books is mainly derived, to possess the appearance and the intellectual and moral attributes of a man; and, indeed, of a man of just that type with which the Israelites were familiar in their stronger and intellectually abler rulers and leaders. In a well-known passage in Genesis (i. 27) Elohim is said to have \"created man in his own image, in the image of Elohim created he him.\" It is \"man\" who is here said to be the image of Elohim--not man's soul alone, still less his \"reason,\" but the whole man. It is obvious that for those who call a manlike ghost Elohim, there could be no difficulty in conceiving any other Elohim under the same aspect. And if there could be any doubt on this subject, surely it cannot stand in the face of what we find in the fifth chapter, where, immediately after a repetition of the statement that \"Elohim created man, in the likeness of Elohim made he him,\" it is said that Adam begat Seth \"in his own likeness, after his image.\" Does this mean that Seth resembled Adam only in a spiritual and figurative sense? And if that interpretation of the third verse of the fifth chapter of Genesis is absurd, why does it become reasonable in the first verse of the same chapter?  But let us go further. Is not the Jahveh who \"walks in the garden in the cool of the day\"; from whom one may hope to \"hide oneself among the trees\"; of whom it is expressly said that \"Moses and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel,\" saw the Elohim of Israel (Exod. xxiv. 9-11); and that, although the seeing Jahveh was understood to be a high crime and misdemeanour, worthy of death, under ordinary circumstances, yet, for this once, he \"laid not his hand on the nobles of Israel\"; \"that they beheld Elohim and did eat and drink\"; and that afterwards Moses saw his back (Exod. xxxiii. 23)--is not this Deity conceived as manlike in form? Again, is not the Jahveh who eats with Abraham under the oaks at Mamre, who is pleased with the \"sweet savour\" of Noah's sacrifice, to whom sacrifices are said to be \"food\" [6]--is not this Deity depicted as possessed of human appetites? If this were not the current Israelitish idea of Jahveh even in the eighth century B.C., where is the point of Isaiah's scathing admonitions to his countrymen: \"To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith Jahveh: I am full of the burnt-offerings of rams and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he-goats\" (Isa. i. 11). Or of Micah's inquiry, \"Will Jahveh be pleased with thousands of rams or with ten thousands of rivers of "]]]
