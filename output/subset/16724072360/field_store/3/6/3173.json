Isaac, N. W. Sundercombe, G. D. Shaw, T. O. Nicholls, and C. C. Flower. But more particularly am I indebted to Lieut. J. T. Blair, who placed at my disposal a considerable quantity of material which he had been at great pains to collect whilst in London.  As regards photographs and maps: Valuable prints and drafts have been supplied by the Trustees of the Australian War Museum. Mr. C. E. W. Bean, the Australian War Correspondent and Official Historian, has very kindly lent me photographs from his private collection. Mr. E. L. Mitchell and Mr. W. Owen, both of Perth, have generously given unrestricted permission to reproduce from their negatives, and certain members, and relatives of members, have also contributed interesting specimens. For the map of the Australian Corps' Front on Gallipoli, and the plans and diagrams referring to Cairo, Tel-el-Kebir, and the Pyramid, I have especially to thank Captain E. A. E. Andrewartha of the Australian Staff Corps.  The publication of the Nominal Rolls of Members of the Battalion has been made possible largely through the assistance of Major J. M. Lean, M.B.E., the Officer in Charge of Base Records, Melbourne.  For historical data, descriptive matter, and a few other essentials, I have also consulted the following works:--Barrett and Deane (\"The A.A.M.C. in Egypt\"); Callwell (\"The Dardanelles Campaign and its Lessons\"); Ellis (\"Story of the 5th Division\"); Hamilton (\"Gallipoli Diary\"); Masefield (\"Gallipoli\"); \"Military History of the Campaign of 1882 in Egypt\" (official); Nevinson (\"The Dardanelles Campaign\"); Schuler (\"Australia in Arms\"); Sladen (\"Oriental Cairo\"); Woods (\"Washed by Four Seas\"), and several others the names of which I cannot now recall. I am also under a great obligation to J. S. Battye, Litt.D., B.A., LL.B., the General Secretary of the Public Library, whose invaluable advice has guided me through a pleasing but arduous task.

The outbreak of the South African War in 1899 brought to the surface, in the people of Australia, that innate love of the Old Country which so marks the British race in whatever part of the world its members may happen to reside. Each Colony made an offer of men who were anxious to serve side by side with their kinsmen of the Regular Army. These offers were accepted--not because the men were needed at that time, but for the reason that statesmen recognised the existence of an era in the development of the dominions overseas that demanded the admission of their inhabitants to a share in the responsibilities attached to the maintenance and promotion of the welfare of the Empire. The reverses to the British arms which occurred during the opening months of the campaign roused in Australia a spirit of intense loyalty and patriotism, which was exemplified by renewed offers of assistance to the Government in London. These offers received an early response, with the result that across the Indian Ocean was maintained a steady stream of troops during the whole two and a half years of operations.  Western Australia readily took up a share of the burden and played her small, though not unimportant, part. Her contribution in troops consisted of 64 officers and 1,167 other ranks, together with 1,179 horses. On a population basis this effort was greater than that of any of the other Australian States. In casualties the various units (one infantry and nine mounted infantry) suffered a loss of 40 by death and 86 by wounds. That the services rendered were valuable, worthy of the State, and highly creditable to the individuals, may be gathered from "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25355"],["title","Rollo in Geneva (#1)"],["body","the people do who live in and around the place _the language of which we are speaking_. Thus the people of France call their capital _Par-ree_; those of Spain call theirs something like this,--_Madhreedth_; the Italians pronounce theirs _Roma_; but we, in talking English, say simply, _Paris_, _Madrid_, and _Rome_; in other words, when we are talking English, we _talk English throughout_, using English words for names of things, and English pronunciation for names of places, in all cases where there is an English pronunciation established,--as there is in respect to all the rivers, towns, mountains, and other localities on the globe that are well known and often spoken of in the English world.  Mont Blanc is one of these. Like the word _Paris_ it has its French pronunciation for the French, and its English pronunciation for the English; and its English pronunciation is as if it were spelled Mount Blank or Mont Blank. Under this name it has been known and spoken of familiarly all over England and America for centuries; and this, it seems to me, is the proper name to give it when we are speaking English.  Its French pronunciation is very different. It is one which none but a practical French scholar can possibly imitate, except in a very awkward manner. Those who have visited France and Switzerland, and have been accustomed to the French sound, often give the word the French pronunciation; but it is not at all necessary to do so. The word, like _Paris_, has its own established English sound; and if it is not pedantry to attempt to give it the French sound when speaking English, it certainly is not a mispronunciation to give it the English one. Indeed, to require the French pronunciation of the word from English speakers would be in effect to banish it almost altogether from conversation; for among the ten millions, more or less, in England or America, who speak English well, there is probably not one in a thousand that can possibly give the word its true French pronunciation.  In reading this book, therefore, and in speaking of the great Swiss mountain, you are perfectly safe in giving it its plain English sound, as if it were written Mont Blank; and remember the principle, as applicable to all other similar cases. Wherever a foreign name has become so familiar to the English world as to have obtained an established English pronunciation, in speaking English we give it that pronunciation, without any regard to the usage of the people who live on the spot.  But now I must return to Geneva, and give some further account of the reasons why it has been so celebrated.  3. The third reason why Geneva has acquired so much celebrity among mankind is the great number of learned and distinguished philosophers and scholars that have from time to time lived there. Switzerland is a republic, and the canton of Geneva is Protestant; and thus the place has served as a sort of resort and refuge for all the most distinguished foes both of spiritual and political tyranny that have risen up in Europe at intervals during the last five hundred years. Geneva was indeed one of the chief centres of the Reformation; and almost all the great reformers visited it and wrote about it, and thus made all the world familiar with it, during the exciting times in which they lived.  Besides this, Geneva has been made the residence and home of a great many moral and political writers within the last one or two centuries; for the country, being republican, is much more open and free than most of the other countries of Europe. Men who have incurred the displeasure of their own governments by their writings or their acts find a safe asylum in Geneva, where they can think and say what they please. All this has tended very strongly to attract the attention of mankind to Geneva, as to a sort of luminous point in respect to moral and political science, from which light radiates to every part of the civilized world.  4. There is one more reason, very different from the preceding, which tends to make Geneva famous, and to draw travellers to visit it at the present day; and that is, it is a great manufacturing place for watches and jewelry--one of the greatest, indeed, in the world. Travellers, in making the tour of Europe,--and American travellers in particular,--always wish to bring home with them a great number and variety of purchases; and the things that they buy they very naturally desire to buy at the places where they are made. It is not merely that they hope to get them better and cheaper there, but it is a pleasant thought to be associated always afterwards with any object of use or luxury that we possess, that we bought it ourselves at the place of its original manufacture. Thus the gentlemen who travel in Europe like to bring home a fowling-piece from Birmingham, a telescope from London, or a painting from Italy; and the ladies, in planning their tour, wish it to include Brussels or Valenciennes for laces, and Geneva for a watch.  Thus, for one reason or another, immense numbers of people go every year to Geneva, in the course of the tour they make in Europe, either for business or pleasure. It is estimated that the number of these visitors annually is not less than thirty thousand; and the chief streets and quays of the town are marked almost as strikingly by the conspicuousness and splendor of the hotels as Broadway in New York.  The place of departure in France for Geneva is Lyons. If you look upon the map you will see the situation of Lyons on the River Rhone, almost opposite to Geneva. There is a railroad from Paris to Lyons, and so on down the Rhone to Marseilles. But from Lyons up to Geneva--which is likewise situated on the Rhone, at the place where it issues from the Lake of Geneva--there was no railroad at the time of Rollo's visit, though there was one in the process of construction. The party were obliged to travel by _diligence_ on that part of the journey. The diligence is the French stage coach. The diligence leaves Lyons in the evening, and travels all night. As Mr. Holiday arrived at Lyons the evening before, Rollo had the whole of the day to walk about the town before setting out for his evening ride. His father gave him leave to go out alone, and ramble where he pleased.  \"The most curious places,\" said his father, \"are on the other side of the river, where the silk weavers live. Notice what bridge you go over, so that you will know it again, and then if you get lost on the other side it will be no matter. All you will have to do is to keep coming down hill till you reach the river, and then look up and down till you see the bridge where you went over. That will bring you home. And be sure to be at home by five o'clock. We are going to have dinner at half past five.\"  \"Then won't it be in season,\" asked Rollo, \"if I am at home by half past five?\"  \"In season for what?\" asked his father.  \"Why, to save my dinner,\" said Rollo.  \"Yes,\" said his father; \"it might be in season to save your dinner, but that is not what I am planning to save. I have no particular uneasiness about your dinner.\"  \"Why, father!\" said Rollo, surprised.  \"I have no wish to have you go hungry,\" replied his father; \"but then if by any chance you happened to be late at dinner, it would be of no great consequence, for you could buy something, and eat it in the diligence by the way. So I was not planning to save your dinner.\"  \"Then what were you planning to save, father?\" asked Rollo.  \"My own and mother's quiet of mind,\" replied Mr. Holiday, \"especially mother's. If five minutes of the dinner hour were to come and you should not appear, she would begin to be uneasy; and indeed so should I. In such cases as this, children ought always to come before the time when their parents would begin to feel any uneasiness respecting them.\"  Rollo saw at once the correctness of this principle, and he secretly resolved that he would be at home a quarter before five.     CHAPTER II.  PLANNING.   \"What part of the diligence are we going to ride in, father?\" asked Rollo, as they were seated at dinner.  \"In the coupé,\"[A] said Mr. Holiday.  [Footnote A: Pronounced _coupay_.]  \"Ah, father!\" said Rollo; \"I wish you would go on the banquette. We can see so much better on the banquette.\"  \"It would be rather hard climbing for mother,\" said Mr. Holiday, \"to get up to the banquette--such a long ladder.\"  \"O, mother can get up just as easily as not,\" said Rollo. \"Couldn't you, mother?\"  \"I am more afraid about getting _down_ than getting up,\" said his mother.  \"But it is a great deal pleasanter on the banquette,\" said Rollo. \"They keep talking all the time--the conductor, and the drivers, and the other passengers that are there; while in the coupé we shall be all by ourselves. Besides, it is so much cheaper.\"  \"It is cheaper, I know,\" said Mr. Holiday; \"but then as to the talking, I think we shall want to be quiet, and go to sleep if we can. You see it will be night.\"  \"Yes, father, that is true,\" said Rollo; \"but I had rather hear them talk. I can understand almost all they say. And then I like to see them change horses, and to see the conductor climb up and down. Then, besides, at almost all the villages they have parcels to leave at the inns; and it is good fun to see them take the parcels out and toss them down, and tell the bar maid at the inn what she is to do with them.\"  \"All that must be very amusing,\" said Mr. Holiday; \"but it would not be so comfortable for your mother to mount up there. Besides, I have engaged our places already in the coupé, and paid for them.\"  \"Why, father!\" said Rollo. \"When did you do it?\"  \"I sent last evening,\" said Mr. Holiday. \"It is necessary to engage the places beforehand at this season. There is so much travelling into Switzerland now that the diligences are all full. I had to send to three offices before I could get places.\"  \"Are there three offices?\" asked Rollo.  \"Yes,\" said his father; \"there are three different lines.  \"But I'll tell "]]]
