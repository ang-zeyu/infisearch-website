If he could have caught Mr. Crow there is no doubt that Grumpy would have made that black scamp sorry that he laughed. But old Mr. Crow was too wary to let anybody surprise him. \"Haw, haw!\" he laughed again. And Grumpy Weasel actually couldn't bear to hear him. Some of the onlookers claimed afterward that they saw Grumpy Weasel start down the tree. And that was as much as they could say. No one knew how he managed to slip out of sight. And the field people say that he was never seen again in that exact spot.     IV  HUNTING A HOLE   Usually Grumpy Weasel did not stray far from a certain corner of Farmer Green's wood lot. He preferred to hunt where he knew the lay of the land. And since he liked especially to hunt along old stone walls, he picked out a long stretch of old tumble-down wall that reached through the woods towards Blue Mountain.  He picked it out as his very own hunting ground and never asked permission of Farmer Green, either.  Now, near the lower end of this wall--the end toward the pasture--a fat person known as Mr. Meadow Mouse sometimes wandered. But he never visited that spot without first inquiring whether Grumpy Weasel had been there the day before. Mr. Meadow Mouse had learned somehow that Grumpy usually moved on each day to a different part of his hunting ground. He was surprised, therefore, to meet Grumpy Weasel face to face one time, when he felt sure that that surly rogue must be a good safe distance away.  Mr. Meadow Mouse cast a quick glance around. But he could see no place to hide. So there was nothing for him to do but to put on a bold front. He bowed pleasantly enough, though he was trembling a little, and remarked that it was a fine day and that he hoped Grumpy was feeling happy--all of which was quite true.  Grumpy Weasel glowered at Mr. Meadow Mouse, for that was his way of replying to a kindly greeting.  \"You've not come here to hunt, I hope,\" he growled. \"I'll have you know that this is my private hunting ground and I allow no poaching.\"  Mr. Meadow Mouse hastened to explain that he was merely out for a stroll.  \"I never hunt,\" he declared. \"Of course, if I happen to see a tiny seed I may stop to eat it. But that's all.\"  \"You'd better be careful what you say!\" Grumpy Weasel snapped. \"Unless I'm mistaken, you were hunting something the moment you saw me. You were hunting a hole.\"  Mr. Meadow Mouse gasped slightly. He hardly knew what to say.  \"Be very careful where you go around here!\" Grumpy Weasel warned him. \"The holes in this stone wall are all mine. I shouldn't want you to use a single one of them without my permission.\"  Mr. Meadow Mouse assured him that he wouldn't dream of trespassing.  \"And these holes among the roots of the trees--they are mine too,\" Grumpy Weasel snarled.  \"Oh, certainly! Certainly!\" Mr. Meadow Mouse cried. He was so quick to agree that for once Grumpy Weasel couldn't think of anything more to find fault about.  \"I'll let you crawl into a few of the smaller holes in the stone wall, if you'll be careful not to hurt them,\" he offered grudgingly.  Mr. Meadow Mouse made haste to thank him.  He said, however, that he thought he would wait till some other time.  \"There's no time like the present,\" Grumpy Weasel grumbled. \"To tell the truth, I want to see if you can squeeze through as small a hole as I can.\"     V  SOLOMON OWL INTERRUPTS   Plump little Mr. Meadow Mouse wished he had stayed away from Grumpy Weasel's hunting ground. He would have scampered off, had he not known that Grumpy could overtake him before he had made three leaps. So he saw no way out of his trouble, though he could think of nothing less agreeable than trying to slip through a small hole with Grumpy Weasel close at hand, watching him narrowly.  Then all at once Mr. Meadow Mouse had an idea. \"You go first!\" he said politely. \"Go through any hole you choose and then I'll try my luck.\"  But Grumpy Weasel was too crafty to do that.  \"You'd try your luck at running away,\" he snarled. \"You are the one to go first; and we'll have no words about it.\"  Well, Mr. Meadow Mouse began to shake more than ever.  \"Don't you think,\" he quavered, \"that we'd better wait a few days until I'm a bit smaller? I'm afraid I've been overeating lately and I might get stuck in a hole. And of course that would be awkward.\"  \"Ha, ha!\" Grumpy Weasel actually laughed. But it was not what any one could call a hearty, wholesome, cheerful sort of laugh. On the contrary, it sounded very cruel and gloating.  \"Hoo, hoo!\" Another laugh--this one weird and hollow--boomed out from the hemlock tree just above Mr. Meadow Mouse's head.  He jumped, in spite of himself--did Mr. Meadow Mouse. And so, too, did Grumpy Weasel. Both of them leaped for the old stone wall. And each flashed into a crevice between the stones, though Grumpy Weasel was ever so much the quicker of the two. They knew Solomon Owl's voice too well to mistake his odd laughter.  \"What's your hurry, gentlemen?\" Solomon called to them.  Mild Mr. Meadow Mouse made no reply. But from Grumpy Weasel's hiding place an angry hiss told Solomon Owl that one of them, at least, had heard his question.  \"Come out!\" said Solomon Owl. \"Don't be shy! I've dined already.\"  Well, that made the two in the wall feel somewhat bolder. And soon they ventured to peep out and gaze at Solomon, to see whether he looked like a person who had just enjoyed a good meal.  \"You're not as hollow as you sound, I hope,\" Grumpy Weasel remarked with some suspicion in his tone.  As for Mr. Meadow Mouse, he wouldn't dream of making so rude a remark.  \"It's a fine evening and I hope you're feeling happy,\" he piped.  \"Oh, very! Very!\" said Solomon Owl solemnly.  Mr. Meadow Mouse was a trusting sort of chap. He was all ready to leave his cranny. But Grumpy Weasel was not yet satisfied.  \"Which one of us are you answering?\" he demanded of Solomon.  \"Him!\" said Solomon.  \"Did you say, 'Ahem?'\" Grumpy Weasel wanted to know.  \"No, no!\" Solomon assured him. \"I said, 'him.' I was answering your friend.\"  Grumpy Weasel made a wry face, as if he did not care to have anybody speak of Mr. Meadow Mouse as a friend of his. And he did not quit the stone wall until he had seen Mr. Meadow Mouse venture forth in safety.  \"Just by accident I overheard your remarks a few minutes ago,\" Mr. Owl explained. \"I'd like to watch this hole-crawling contest. And I'll stay here and be the umpire--and see that there's fair play.\"     VI  MR. MEADOW MOUSE ESCAPES   Grumpy Weasel did not like Solomon Owl's offer to be umpire of the hole-crawling contest between Mr. Meadow Mouse and himself. He hissed a few times and glared at Solomon Owl, up in the hemlock tree.  Solomon Owl did not appear to mind that, but calmly outstared Grumpy Weasel without once blinking. \"Are you both ready?\" he asked presently.  \"Yes, thank you!\" Mr. Meadow Mouse answered. And Grumpy Weasel gave a sort of shrug, as if to say that he supposed he was.  \"First you may try that hole between those mossy stones,\" Mr. Owl announced, with a tilt of his head toward the wall.  \"Certainly!\" cried Mr. Meadow Mouse.  \"You go first and I'll follow,\" Grumpy Weasel told him.  And Mr. Meadow Mouse didn't dare disobey. He whisked through the hole spryly and was back again in no time.  Then Grumpy took his turn. He was certainly quicker than Mr. Meadow Mouse. Even the umpire, Solomon Owl, had to admit that.  \"But of course that's not the point,\" Solomon observed. \"It's the one that gets stuck in a hole that loses the contest.\"  Well, after Grumpy and Mr. Meadow Mouse had slipped through several holes, each one smaller than the one before, Mr. Meadow Mouse said that he thought it was only polite to let Grumpy go first. Secretly Mr. Meadow Mouse was afraid of what might happen if he should have the misfortune to get wedged in a hole, with Grumpy Weasel ready to follow him. He had had some trouble getting through the last one and he knew that he could never squeeze through one that was much smaller.  Grumpy Weasel lost his temper at once.  \"I'll do as I please on my stone wall!\" he snapped. And he was angrier than ever when Solomon Own said to him, \"It's your turn!\" Probably no other of the woods people--unless it was one of the Hawk family--could have made Grumpy Weasel obey. And now he insisted that if he \"went first\" he ought to be allowed to choose whatever hole he pleased.  Both Solomon Owl and Mr. Meadow Mouse agreed. So Grumpy Weasel popped through a hole of his own choosing, and he did not reappear, though he called to Mr. Meadow Mouse to \"come on.\"  Mr. Meadow Mouse hung back.  \"You'll have to excuse me,\" he stammered.  \"What's the matter?\" boomed Solomon Owl. \"Do you want to lose the contest?\"  \"No!\" said Mr. Meadow Mouse. \"But Grumpy Weasel is still inside that hole. There's no other way out.\"  \"How do you know?\" Solomon Owl asked him.  \"Oh, I've been here before, often,\" Mr. Meadow Mouse replied.  \"Are you sure?\" Mr. Owl inquired.  \"I'll go on the other side of the wall and look,\" Mr. Meadow Mouse offered. And thereupon he skipped over the wall.  Solomon Owl waited patiently. And so did Grumpy Weasel. But Mr. Meadow Mouse never came back. Once out of sight he scampered away. And he never trespassed on Grumpy Weasel's hunting ground again.     VII  PADDY MUSKRAT'S BLUNDER   Sometimes Grumpy Weasel found the hunting poor along the stretch of stone wall that he called his own--though of course it really belonged to Farmer Green. And though he disliked to wander much in strange neighborhoods, once in a while he visited other parts of Pleasant Valley.  It was on such an excursion to the bank of the mill pond that he caught sight, one day, of Paddy Muskrat--or to be more exact, that Paddy Muskrat caught sight of him.  Now it was seldom that anybody spoke to Grumpy Weasel. On the contrary, most of the forest-folk dodged out of sight whenever they saw him, and said nothing. So he wheeled like a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24881"],["title","The Tale of Grumpy Weasel (#2)"],["body"," and started to run when somebody called, \"Hullo, stranger!\"  One quick backward glance at a small wet head in the water told Grumpy that he had nothing to fear.  \"Hullo, yourself!\" he retorted \"And you'd better not call me 'stranger,' because I'm no stranger than you are.\"  Well, Paddy Muskrat--for it was he who had spied Grumpy Weasel on the bank of the pond--saw at once that whoever the slender and elegant person might be, he had the worst of manners. Though Paddy had lived in the mill pond a long time, he had never met any one that looked exactly like the newcomer. To be sure, there was Peter Mink, who was long-bodied and short-tempered, as the stranger appeared to be. But when Paddy inquired whether the visitor wasn't a distant connection of the Mink family (as indeed he was!), Grumpy Weasel said, \"What! Do you mean to insult me by asking whether I'm related to such a ragged, ruffianly crowd?\"  Somehow Paddy Muskrat rather liked that answer, for Peter Mink and all his family were fine swimmers and most unwelcome in the mill pond.  And perhaps--who knew?--perhaps the spic-and-span chap on the bank, with the sleek coat and black-tipped tail, was one of the kind that didn't like to get his feet wet.  Then Paddy Muskrat asked the stranger a silly question. He was not the wisest person, anyhow, in Pleasant Valley, as his wife often reminded him. \"You're not a distant relation of Tommy Fox, are you?\" he inquired.  Grumpy Weasel actually almost smiled.  \"Now, how did you happen to guess that?\" he asked.  \"Because you've got such a sharp nose,\" Paddy Muskrat replied. And he was quite pleased with himself, for he thought that he wasn't so stupid as some people thought.  \"Any other reason?\" Grumpy Weasel inquired, stepping to the edge of the overhanging bank.  \"You don't like to get your feet wet,\" Paddy Muskrat said. And feeling safe as anything, he swam nearer the spot where the stranger was crouching.  Paddy saw, almost too late, that he had made a bad blunder. For without the slightest warning Grumpy Weasel leaped at him. And had not Paddy been a wonderful swimmer and able to dive like a flash, he would never have dashed, panting, into his house a few moments later.  \"What on earth is the matter?\" his wife asked him.  \"I've been having a swimming race with a stranger,\" Paddy explained. \"I don't know his name. But I do know that he'd just as soon get his feet wet as I would.\"  \"Well, why not?\" Mrs. Muskrat inquired. \"That only shows he's sensible.\"  \"Does it show I'm sensible, too?\" Paddy asked her.  \"Certainly not!\" said Mrs. Muskrat.     VIII  THE DARE   If Grumpy Weasel had been a faster runner the forest people wouldn't have been so surprised when he dared Jimmy Rabbit to race him. Everybody knew that Jimmy was swift-footed--especially since he once beat old Mr. Turtle (but that is another story).  When Mr. Crow, who was a great bearer of news, told Jimmy Rabbit one day that Grumpy Weasel wanted a race with him, Jimmy Rabbit seemed more than willing to oblige. \"Where, when, and how far does Grumpy want to run against me?\" he asked.  Mr. Crow said that he didn't know, but that he would make it his business to find out. So off he hurried to find Grumpy Weasel, for if there was anything Mr. Crow liked it was busying himself with other people's affairs.  He did not have what you could call a pleasant talk with Grumpy Weasel. Once when Mr. Crow alighted too near the ground Grumpy jumped at him. And several times he called Mr. Crow a nest-robber and an egg-thief, though goodness knows Grumpy Weasel himself was as bad as the worst when it came to robbing birds' nests.  Although he felt as if he were about to burst with rage old Mr. Crow pretended to laugh. He had been having a rather dull time, waiting for Farmer Green to plant his corn, and he thought that a lively race might put him in better spirits.  [Illustration: Grumpy Nearly Catches Paddy Muskrat. (_Page 31_)]  \"Where do you want to race against Jimmy Rabbit?\" Mr. Crow asked.  \"We'll start from this wall,\" said Grumpy sulkily, \"because it's always better to start from where you are than where you aren't.\"  Mr. Crow said that that seemed reasonable.  \"When do you want to race?\" he added.  \"The sooner we start the quicker we'll finish,\" Grumpy Weasel snapped.  \"Quite true, quite true!\" Mr. Crow agreed. \"And now may I inquire how long a race you want to run?\"  \"No longer than I have to!\" Grumpy growled. \"Not more than a day or two, I hope!\"  Mr. Crow snickered slightly. \"I see you don't understand my question,\" he observed. \"Are you going to run a mile, or only a few rods?\"  \"How do I know?\" Grumpy cried, as if he had no patience with his questioner. \"How could anybody tell? I'll let Jimmy Rabbit start twenty jumps ahead of me and we'll run till I catch him.\"  Well, Mr. Crow laughed right out loud when he heard that. And he was about to tell Grumpy that he would have to run till the end of his days if he raced Jimmy Rabbit in any such fashion as that. But he saw all at once that such a race would be a great joke. And he said to himself with a chuckle that the laugh would be on Grumpy Weasel. For Jimmy Rabbit was so swift a runner that nobody who knew anything at all would ever consent to give him a start--much less propose such a thing.  \"Very well!\" said Mr. Crow with a smirk, \"I'll report to Jimmy Rabbit. I'll tell him where, when and how you want to race, and there's no doubt that your plan will please him.\"  \"I hope it won't!\" Grumpy Weasel snarled. \"I've never pleased anybody yet; and I don't mean to.\"  And that goes to show what an ill-natured scamp he was.     IX  SAVING HIS FEET   Old Mr. Crow and Jimmy Rabbit had a good laugh over Grumpy Weasel's plan for a race with Jimmy. They thought it a great joke.  \"He needn't give me a start,\" Jimmy said. \"I can beat Grumpy easily.\"  \"Never mind that!\" Mr. Crow advised. \"You might as well let him have his way. He'll look all the more foolish, trying to catch up with you.\"  So Jimmy Rabbit agreed to run the race as Grumpy Weasel wished, saying that he was ready to start at once.  But Mr. Crow told him he had better wait till the next day. \"That will give me time to tell everybody,\" he explained, \"and then there'll be a big turnout to see you win--and to jeer at Grumpy Weasel for losing.\" And one could tell from Mr. Crow's remark that he liked Jimmy Rabbit and that he despised Grumpy Weasel.  The next day proved to be a fine one for the race. It wasn't too hot nor too cold; and early in the morning the field- and forest-people began gathering at Grumpy Weasel's hunting ground, where the stone wall touched the clearing.  About the only persons that objected to the time set for the race were Benjamin Bat and Solomon Owl. Benjamin said that he could never keep awake to watch it; and Solomon complained that he couldn't see well in the daytime. But all the rest of the company were in the best of spirits, giggling slyly whenever they looked at Grumpy Weasel, who seemed to pay scant heed to his neighbors, though you may be sure his roving black eyes took in everything that was going on. He seemed more restless than ever as he waited for Jimmy Rabbit to arrive, walking to and fro on his front legs in a most peculiar fashion, while he kept his hind feet firmly planted on the ground in one spot. Of course he could never have moved about in this manner had his body not been so long and slender.  Noticing Grumpy's strange actions, old Mr. Crow looked worried and asked him what was the matter. \"I hope your hind feet aren't troubling you, just as the race is about to begin,\" he said.  Grumpy Weasel hissed at the old gentleman before he replied: \"Don't worry! You'll soon see that my hind feet can travel as fast as my front ones--when I want to use them.\"  \"Ah!\" Mr. Crow exclaimed knowingly. \"He's saving his hind feet for the race.\"  When Jimmy Rabbit reached the gathering place, coming up in a long lope, Mr. Crow hurried to meet him.  \"I advise you to save your hind feet,\" he whispered. \"Grumpy Weasel is saving his.\"  Jimmy Rabbit told Mr. Crow, with a smile, that he had saved his hind feet all his life--and his front ones, too.  \"I've brought them along to-day,\" he said, \"to help me win this race.\"     X  HA! AND HA, HA!   A great outcry rang through the woods the moment Jimmy Rabbit set out to race Grumpy Weasel and beat him. Shouts of \"Good luck!\" and \"Run hard!\" and \"Hurrah for James Rabbit!\" followed Jimmy. But old Mr. Crow squawked, \"You don't need to hurry!\" He thought that the race was already as good as won, for Grumpy Weasel had insisted on giving Jimmy Rabbit a start of twenty jumps.  Meanwhile Grumpy Weasel glowered. But he could not glower at Jimmy's friends, because he had to watch Jimmy himself in order to count the first twenty jumps he took. When Grumpy had counted nineteen and a half away he started. And old Mr. Crow, as he sat staring at the race, declared that Grumpy Weasel hadn't a chance to win.  The company seemed ready to take Mr. Crow's word for it--that is, all except Grumpy Weasel's cousin, Peter Mink. He spoke up and said that as for him, he would wait and see what happened. He didn't believe old Mr. Crow knew what he was talking about.  Mr. Crow grew almost a purplish black with rage.  \"We'll all wait,\" he said stiffly. \"We'll all wait. And when the race is over you will apologize to me.\"  Peter Mink merely grinned. He had no respect for his elders. And now he didn't appear to mind in the least when the entire company let him severely alone.  Mr. Crow shot a triumphant look at him about an hour later, when Jimmy Rabbit came bounding into sight, with no one following him. \"You may as well stop now,\" Mr. Crow told Jimmy. \"You've as good as won the race already.\"  Jimmy Rabbit said that he thought so, too, but he supposed he'd better keep running a while longer, till Grumpy Weasel gave up. So off he hopped again.  Everybody except Peter Mink laughed heartily when Grumpy Weasel came springing up the"]]]
