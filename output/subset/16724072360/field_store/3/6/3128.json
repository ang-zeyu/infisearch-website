We never shall be wise enough to work out such a problem as you have put to us.\"  \"It is not to be expected that we shall,\" replied his mother kindly. \"Such scientific treatment of silkworms takes both knowledge and experience. Many people raise a good crop of cocoons without knowing much more than we do--sometimes not as much. I was only telling you the possibilities of the industry if one were to pursue it on a large scale. If you and Marie and I keep our silkworms alive, clean, and well-fed, and reap a reasonable harvest of cocoons, we must be satisfied. I shall consider we have done well. Only let us not waste more leaves than we must. In time we shall learn to estimate about how many to gather at a picking. Fortunately here in France the mulberry trees yield more leaves than they do in most countries, so I am not worried lest we fall short. In some countries the number of leaves is very limited, and the gatherers are compelled to be exceedingly careful not to waste them. I remember hearing your father say that in Persia, where the climate is very hot, the natives gather small branches of leaves, that they may be fresher than they would be if picked one at a time.\"  \"Why don't we do that here?\" inquired Marie. \"I should think it would be a fine plan.\"  \"It isn't,\" responded her mother. \"In the first place it injures the trees to take off so many twigs and let so much sap escape; furthermore, it makes more waste to clear away. We should only be making ourselves work were we to follow such a method. The best way is to gather the single leaves just as we always have done. There will be four of us, for old Josef can help us. It is fortunate he did not go to the war, for while he helped your father he learned many things about silk-raising which will be useful to us, I am sure.\"  \"I wish the silkworms did not eat so much,\" grumbled Marie.  \"They must eat if they are to grow, dear,\" said Madame Bretton. \"Every creature eats more while growing--even children,\" she added mischievously. \"But a silkworm does all its growing in a very short space of time, and in proportion to its size grows faster than almost any other living thing. Remember, its whole life is over in a few short weeks. It must live very fast while it lives.\"  \"If only ours _do_ live,\" interpolated Marie dubiously.  \"I see no reason to fear they won't,\" Madame Bretton said once more. \"But we must neglect nothing. It is the trifling carelessnesses that bring bad results--the tiny things that it seems silly to take the trouble to do. If we lose our crop of cocoons because of slighting the little details it will be our own fault, and we shall deserve failure; if, on the other hand, we do the best we know, we shall have no regrets. We must take every precaution to keep the silk-house clean and well-ventilated, for silkworms demand spotless surroundings as well as plenty of fresh air. Then we must not allow withered leaves or other refuse to collect on the shelves where the worms are feeding, for any waste matter ferments and causes disease.\"  \"Aren't silkworms very likely to get sick anyway, Mother?\" queried Pierre.  \"They are susceptible to certain diseases,\" nodded Madame Bretton. \"For example, there are epidemics which sometimes sweep away the hatching of an entire season; sometimes, too, the eggs are diseased and hatch into diseased caterpillars, which in turn lay more diseased eggs. This was the tragedy that befell France in 1847. At that time the French people could get no healthy eggs anywhere in their own country, and were forced to send to Italy for them. Afterward the infection spread to Italy. Then those from the region of the Danube, where growers had been purchasing them, also became diseased. The plague spread even to China, until in 1865 the only good eggs to be had were those from India. You can imagine what a terrible experience that was for the peasants. Not only did they lose all the eggs that they had raised and stored, but as most of them were poor they could not afford to import perfect eggs from India. Hence many of them gave up silk-raising entirely and the price both of silkworms and of silk became enormous. Only the very rich could afford to buy either.\"  \"How did people ever get out of such a tangle, Mother?\" questioned Marie, much interested.  \"Little by little those fortunate persons who secured good eggs sold a few to those who had none, and the crop soon increased, for one silkworm-moth will lay as many as two or three hundred eggs. But even at this rate it took many years to get the industry up to where it was before. It was a terrible misfortune to the French and Italian peasants, and you may be pretty sure that as a result of the calamity every one set about being careful to prevent another such disaster. Now when silkworms are ill they are quickly isolated, just as people are who have contagious diseases. And if there is danger of wide-spread infection, and the growers think best not to take any risks, they will even kill many of the caterpillars outright. The sacrifice is sometimes great, but it is a necessary precaution. Furthermore, present day sericulturists have learned much about growing silkworms, and the importance of keeping the silk-houses clean and well aired; they have found that they must preserve an even temperature within the buildings; wash the walls down with lime to purify the atmosphere; sterilize the trays from which the worms feed; and hatch the eggs in large, airy places. The most up-to-date growers who work on a large scale use incubators. Of course, however, there are still some ignorant peasants who insist on hatching the caterpillars inside their clothing, where the warmth from their bodies will bring the eggs quickly to maturity. Fortunately there are not many who do this. They have learned better.\"  \"I should hope so!\" ejaculated both Marie and Pierre in a breath.  There was a moment of silence; then the boy looked up into his mother's face and said:  \"I understand now why Father was so particular.\"  \"Your father is an intelligent man, who believes that 'trifles make perfection and that perfection is no trifle,'\" answered Madame Bretton. \"He has raised some very fine silk and made a good profit by selling it. But every franc of the money was earned--it never came to him easily.\"  \"We'll try to do as well as he has, won't we, Mother?\" Marie said softly.  \"We must not expect to do anything as well as your father would have done it; he has been a very successful silk-grower. But we will do as well as we are able,\" returned Madame Bretton with a sad, far-away glance.  [Illustration]     CHAPTER III  PÈRE BENEDICT   When Madame Bretton and the children returned from their inspection of the silk-house they were surprised to find Monsieur le Curé, good Father Benedict, awaiting them. The priest was sitting contentedly in the sunshine, his walking-stick in his hand, and the gentle breeze stirring his white hair. Beside him stood Hector with nose on the Curé's knee and great brown eyes looking into the kindly face of the old man.  Madame Bretton hurried forward.  \"Why, Father!\" she exclaimed. \"Who would have thought of finding you here! Have you been waiting long?\"  \"But a few minutes, my dear,\" was the answer. \"I knew well you could not have strayed far, for the house was unlocked, and the kettle steaming on the hob.\"  \"So it was,\" laughed Madame Bretton. \"You must stay and share our porridge with us, Father. It is just supper time, and you have had a long walk from the village. You must be hungry. The children and I would be so glad if you would be our guest.\"  Marie and Pierre added their pleas.  \"Do stay, Father,\" they cried. \"Stay and tell us some stories.\"  Monsieur le Curé smiled into their eager faces.  \"I will gladly stay if you are sure the porridge----\"  \"There is enough, Father, and to spare,\" declared Madame Bretton. \"But had I known you were coming you should have had one of the hot tea cakes that you like so much.\"  \"Ah, a tea cake--how good it is! You are a rare cook, my daughter.\" He glanced into Madame Bretton's face with radiant smile. \"But is not hearty welcome better than a pyramid of tea cakes? If you are sure about the porridge----\"  He chuckled playfully.  \"There is plenty, Father--plenty,\" put in Marie. \"I saw Mother measure it. And if there weren't you should have mine,\" she added as she joyously seized his baretta and stick and hurried away with them.  \"You are a good child, Marie,\" the old priest called after her. \"Now make haste to put my things away, and then you and Pierre shall come here and tell me how your silk-raising is getting on. Have you begun to hatch out your silkworms yet?\"  The boy and girl nestled at his side. Had not Father Benedict brought them up; and was he not friend as well as teacher? In every home in Bellerivre his coming was hailed with delight, and his departure followed with regret. He possessed the rare attributes of sympathy and simplicity sometimes blended in great natures. None of his flock experienced a happiness too trivial for him to exult in, or a grief too personal for him to share.  Madame Bretton glanced for a second at the group on the door-step--at the white-haired man, the bright-faced children, the old dog; then she softly tiptoed into the house to make ready the evening meal.  \"We haven't hatched any of our silkworms yet, Father,\" answered Marie, \"but everything is prepared, and we shall begin in a day or two; perhaps to-morrow if there is warm sun.\"  \"That is right,\" nodded the priest. \"It is full time they were under way. That is one reason I came to see you. You live so far away that I feared you might not know that all through the valley the silk-raising is beginning. Already some of the peasants in the village have hatched their eggs; but I think they were a bit too hurried about it, for the trees are hardly leaved out"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25028"],["title","Heist Job on Thizar (#1)"],["body","robot bellhop whirred, a chute opened in the wall, and a bottle slid out. Drake poured, handed the tumbler to the girl, and said: \"This is your party; what do you have in mind?\"  The girl took a sip of her drink before she answered. Then she looked up at Drake with her deep brown eyes. \"Two things. One: I have no intention or desire to compete with Anson Drake for the Necklace of Algol. Both of us might end up in jail with nothing for our pains.  \"Two: I have a foolproof method for getting the necklace, but none for getting it off the planet. I think you probably have a way.\"  Drake nodded. \"I dare say I could swing it. How does it happen that you don't have an avenue of disposal planned?\"  She looked bleak for a moment. \"The man who was to help me decided to back out at the last minute. He didn't know what the job was, and I wouldn't tell him because I didn't trust him.\"  \"And you trust me?\"  Her eyes were very trustful. \"I've heard a lot about you, Drake, and I happen to know you never doublecross anyone unless they doublecross you first.\"  \"Trade about is fair play, to quote an ancient maxim,\" Drake said, grinning. \"And I am a firm believer in fair play.  \"But that's neither here nor there. The point is: what do you have to offer? Why shouldn't I just pinch the gems myself and do a quick flit across the Galaxy? That would give me all the loot.\"  She shook her head. \"Belgezad is on to you, you know. He knows you're here. His own private police and the Shan's own Guard will be at the Coronation to protect all that jewelry.\" She cocked her pretty head to one side and looked at him. \"What's between you and Belgezad, anyway?\"  \"I stole his toys when he was a child,\" said Drake, \"and he hasn't trusted me since. How do you propose to get the Necklace of Algol if I can't?\"  She smiled and shook her head slowly. \"That would be telling. You let me take care of my part, and I'll let you take care of yours.\"  Drake shook his head--not so slowly. \"Absolutely not. We either work together or we don't work at all.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The girl frowned in thought for a moment, and then reached into the belt pouch at her side and pulled out a square of electro-engraved plastic. She handed it to Drake.  Underneath all the flowery verbiage, it boiled down to an invitation to attend the post-Coronation reception. It was addressed to \"Miss Caroline Smith\" and was signed and sealed by the Shan of Thizar himself.  \"I'm 'Caroline Smith',\" she said. \"I've managed to get in good with the family of Belgezad, and he wangled the invitation.  \"Now, the plan is this: Right after the Invocation, while the new Shan is being prepared in his special Coronation Robes, the Nobles have to change their uniforms from red to green. Belgezad will go into his suite in the Palace to change. He'll be accompanied by two guards. One will stay on the outside, the other will help Belgezad dress. I've got the room next to his, and I've managed to get the key that unlocks the door between them. I'll use this--\" She pulled a small globe of metal from her belt pouch. \"It's a sleep-gas bomb. It'll knock them out for at least twenty minutes. No one will come in during that time, and I'll be able to get the necklace and get out of the palace before they wake up.\"  \"They'll know you did it,\" Drake pointed out. \"If you're still missing when they come to, the thief's identity will be obvious.\"  She nodded. \"That's where you come in. I'll simply go out into the garden and throw it over the wall to you. We'll meet here afterwards.\"  Drake thought it over and smiled devilishly. \"It sounds fine. Now let's co-ordinate everything.\"  They went over the whole plot again, this time with a chart of the palace to mark everything out and a time schedule was arranged. Then they toasted to success and the girl left.  When she was gone, Anson Drake smiled ruefully to himself and opened a secret compartment in his suitcase. From it, he removed a long strand of glittering jewels.  \"A perfect imitation,\" Drake said. \"And you're very pretty. It's a shame I won't be able to hang you around the neck of Belgezad in place of the real Necklace of Algol.\"  But his original plan had been more dangerous than the present one, and Anson Drake was always ready to desert a good plan for a better one.         *       *       *       *       *  Coronation Day dawned bright and clear, and the festivities began early. There were speeches and parades and dancing in the streets. A huge fleet of high-flying rockets rumbled high in the stratosphere, filling the sky with the white traceries of their exhausts. For all of Thizar, it was a holiday, a day of rejoicing and happiness. Cheers for the Shan filled the streets, and strains of music came from the speakers of the public communications system.  Anson Drake missed most of the fun; he was too busy making plans. The day passed as he worked.  Thizar's sun began to set as the hour for the actual Crowning of the Shan approached. At the proper time, Drake was waiting in the shadows outside the palace walls. There were eyes watching him, and he knew it, but he only smiled softly to himself and waited.  \"_Sssssst!_\"  It was the girl, on the other side of the wall.  \"I'm here,\" whispered Drake.  Something that glittered faintly in the soft light of the twin moons of Thizar arced over the wall. Drake caught it in his hands. The Necklace of Algol!  He slipped it into a small plastic box he was carrying and then glanced at the detector on his wrist. The screen showed a pale blue pip which indicated that someone was hidden in the shadows a few yards to his right.  Drake didn't even glance toward the spy. He put the plastic box containing the necklace into his belt pouch and strode away from the palace. He had, he figured, about twenty minutes.  He headed directly for the spaceship terminal. Never once did he look back, but the detector on his wrist told him that he was being closely followed. Excellent!  Inside the terminal, he went directly to the baggage lockers. He found one that was empty, inserted a coin, and opened it. From his pouch, he took a plastic box, put it in the locker, switched on the lock with his key, and strolled away.         *       *       *       *       *  He glanced again at his detector. He was no longer being followed by the same man; another had taken up the trail. It figured; it figured.  He went straight to the Hotel Gandyll, making sure that his tail didn't lose him. Not until they were in the lobby did he make any attempt to shake the man who was following him. He went into the bar, ordered a drink, and took a sip. He left his change and the drink on the bar and headed out the door in the direction of the men's room. Whoever was following him wouldn't realize for a minute or two that he was leaving for good. A man doesn't usually leave change and an unfinished drink in a bar.  Drake took the lift tube up to his room, attended to some unfinished business, and waited.         *       *       *       *       *  Less than three minutes later, the door was opened. In walked Viron Belgezad and his lieutenant, Jomis Dobigel. Both of them looked triumphant, and they were surrounded by a squad of Royal Police.  \"There he is,\" said Dobigel. \"Arrest him!\"  A police officer stepped forward. \"Anson Drake, I arrest you in the name of the Shan,\" he said.  Drake grinned. \"On what charge?\"  \"The theft of the Necklace of Algol.\"  Drake looked directly at Belgezad. \"Did old Fatface here say I took it?\"  \"You can't talk that way,\" Dobigel snarled, stepping forward.  \"Who says so, Ugly?\"  At that, Dobigel stepped forward and threw a hard punch from his shoulder--straight at Drake's face.  It never landed. Drake side-stepped it and brought a smashing uppercut up from his knees. It lifted Dobigel off his feet and sent him crashing back against old Belgezad, toppling them both to the floor.  The policemen had all drawn their guns, but Drake was standing placidly in the middle of the room, his hands high above his head regarding the scene calmly.  \"I'll go quietly,\" he said. \"I've got no quarrel with the police.\"  One of the officers led him out into the hall while the others searched his room. Belgezad was sputtering incoherently. Another policeman was trying to wake up Dobigel.  \"If you're looking for the Necklace of Algol,\" Drake said, \"you won't find it there.\"  The captain of the police squad said: \"We know that, Mr. Drake. We are merely looking for other evidence. We already have the necklace.\" He reached in his belt pouch and took out a small plastic box. He opened it, disclosing a glittering rope of jewels. \"You were seen depositing this in a baggage locker at the spaceship terminal. We have witnesses who saw you, and we had it removed under police supervision.\"  Viron Belgezad smiled nastily. \"This time you won't get away, Drake! Stealing anything from the palace of the Shan carries a minimum penalty of twenty years in Thizar Prison.\"  Drake said nothing as they took him off to the Royal Police Station and locked him in a cell.         *       *       *       *       *  It was late afternoon of the next day when the Prosecutor for the Shan visited Drake's cell. He was a tall, imposing man, and Drake knew him by reputation as an honest, energetic man.  \"Mr. Drake,\" he said as he sat down in a chair in the cell, \"you have refused to speak to anyone but me. I am, of course, perfectly willing to be of any assistance, but I am afraid I must warn you that any statement made to me will be used against you at the trial.\"  Drake leaned back in his own chair. One thing nice about Thizar, he reflected; they had comfortable jails.  \"My Lord Prosecutor,\" he said, \"I'd like to make a statement. As I understand it, Belgezad claims he was gassed, along with a police guard who was with him. When he woke up, the necklace was gone. He didn't see his assailant.\"  \"That is correct,\" said the Prosecutor.  Drake grinned. That was the way it had"]]]
