He tasted it with a quizzical expression.  \"They call this whisky nowadays!\" he observed absently, with quiet irony. I wanted to hear the rest of his account.  \"Go on with your story, sir,\" I begged him.  \"The rest is simple enough--but it's the meat of the narrative. You see, I had to revise the way I was going about my work, and I went at it at a new angle. By this time wireless telegraphy was being widely developed, and there were many features of it that appealed to me. With the knowledge I had gained during my first feverish years of experiment, however, I was able to go far beyond what has been done in recent times with radio.  \"I used a system differing in many respects from that of the commercial radio. We haven't time now to go into all that--I can tell you later, and it involves much that is highly technical and still secret. It is sufficient if I explain that my object was to evolve and fuse methods for doing with each of the senses what radio does with sound. Telephotography was the simplest problem--the others required an almost superhuman amount of labor.  \"But my biggest job was to combine them. And, to do that, I had to use knowledge I had gained not only in the laboratory but in my wanderings about the earth--not only in the colleges and salons of Europe and America, but in the bazaars and temples of India, Egypt, China. I had to unite the lore of ancient and modern civilizations, and I created a new factor in electrical science. I suppose the simplest and most intelligible name for it would be mental telepathy. But it is more than that, and basically it is as simple and material as your own motion pictures.\"  I think Melbourne would have gone on and told me more about his discoveries. At that moment, however, he paused to reflect, and we looked up to find the others leaving. The bottle of Scotch was empty.  \"Ready, Melbourne?\" Barclay called. We rose.  \"I didn't realize it was so late,\" Melbourne answered. \"Mr. Barrett and I have found each other most interesting.\"  We all found our hats and went out. Melbourne and Barclay, each apologizing for having neglected the other, said good-bye. Barclay was tired and wanted to go to bed. He went off with the others, but Melbourne turned my way.  \"If you're not too weary of my company,\" he said, \"I'll go with you a little way.\"  \"You know I'm not,\" I answered. \"I've never been so interested in anything before. It sounds like a chapter from Wells, or Jules Verne.\"  He smiled, with a little shake of his head, and we walked on for awhile in silence toward the lake....         *       *       *       *       *  All this came back to me swiftly and with an effect of incoherence, much as a dream moves, during the few moments when I was getting ready for my bath. I laid out my shaving things, and put a record on the Victrola. I have never quite conquered my need for music while I bathe and dress. I think the record was a Grieg nocturne--something cool and quiet, with a touch of acutely sweet pain and melancholy.  Then I happened to glance at a mirror for the first time. I stood amazed and transfixed. Overnight I had grown a beard such as wanderers bring back with them from the wilderness. Under the beard, my face seemed to have altered somehow, to have changed in some peculiar way. Physically it appeared younger, with an expression of calm and repose such as I had never before seen on a man's face. But the eyes were wise and old, as if--overnight!--the mind behind them had learned the knowledge of all time.  Or was it overnight? I could not lose that feeling that time had passed by since my last contact with ordinary life. It was as though, somewhere and somehow, I had lived for weeks or months in some new plane, and forgotten it. I felt richer and older than I had once felt, and the things I had been remembering seemed remote.  At that moment, a chance strain from the machine in my living room brought back a whole new group of vivid impressions, strange and yet in a sense more familiar than my memories of Melbourne. They opened up to me a different life in which I seemed to have participated by chance, and a life which had, at first sight, no point of contact with the reality to which I had returned....     A Chance Strain from Grieg   I recalled waking up in another place, on a long slope of green hill that overlooked a valley. It was dawn again. The sun was just rising over the crest of the hill behind me, and it threw long shadows across the grass from the tall, slender trees along the summit. Down in the valley a broad, clean river of clear water followed the curve of the hill until it disappeared from sight. There were other hills beyond the river, all with the same long, simple slope of grass; and, beyond the hills, there were the tops of blue mountains, swathed in white morning mist.  It was a strange place. Its strangeness consisted in a subtle appearance of order and care, as though a gardener or an army of gardeners had arranged and tended the whole vast sweep of landscape for years. It was uncultivated and deserted as waste land, but as well trimmed, in spite of its spaciousness, as a lawn.  The morning was very warm. I was not conscious of any chill in the air. I was clothed only in short trousers, such as athletes wear, and a short belted tunic without sleeves and loose--both of them indescribably soft and comfortable.  I was aware of the strangeness of my awakening, but I seemed to have no definite recollection of falling asleep. I felt that I had come there during my sleep under unusual circumstances and from a very different life, but the thought didn't disturb me or trouble my mind in any way. My chief emotion was a curious feeling of expectancy. I knew that I was about to have some new and curious experience, something not trivial, and I was eager to meet it.  I lay there for awhile, drinking in the beauty of the morning, and breathing an air of miraculous purity and freshness. Finally I stood up, light and conscious of a sudden grace, aware for the first time, in its departure, of the awkwardness and weight which ordinarily attend our movements on earth. It was as if some of the earth's gravity had been lost.  For a while I examined the valley, but I saw no sign of life there. Then I turned and went slowly up the hill, the sunlight falling warmly on my body, and my feet sinking sensuously in the deep grass.         *       *       *       *       *  When I came to the crest and looked over, I saw another valley before me, deeper than the first. The hill rolled away, down and down for miles, to a long, wide plain. More hills rose from the plain on every side, as simply as if they had been built there by the hand of some gigantic child playing in a wilderness of sand. And the river, coming around the base of the hill on which I was standing, but several miles away, swept out upon a great aqueduct of stone, hundreds of feet high, which crossed the plain through its very center, a straight line of breath-taking beauty, and disappeared far away into the pass between two mountains. The whole scene was too perfect to be wholly natural.  At the center of the plain stood a tall, white building. Even in the distance from which I viewed it, it looked massive--larger than any skyscraper I had ever seen. But it was delicately and intricately designed, terraced much as most modern office buildings in New York are terraced, but more elaborately. Its base stood about the aqueduct, which passed through it, and it swept up magnificently to a slender peak almost level with the crest of the hill where I was standing. It was the only building in sight.  I don't know how long I stood there, admiring the clean sweep and vastness of the scene, before I saw something rise sharply, with a flashing of bright wings, from some hidden courtyard or terrace of the building. It was followed closely by another and then another, like a flight of birds. They shot up swiftly, circled once or twice, and moved away in different directions, straight and purposeful. One of them came toward my hill.         *       *       *       *       *  It was only a few moments before the thing sped up to me and swooped down as I waved my arms. It was, of course, a machine, slender and long, with wide arching wings. It seemed almost light enough to float. It had a deck, shielded from the wind by a shimmering transparent thing like a thin wire screen, and under the deck a cabin made, it seemed, of glass. A man and a woman stood on the deck, the woman handling the controls. They were both dressed much like myself.  The machine came to rest on the hill near me. I stepped forward, and the man leaped down to meet me. His first greeting was curious.  \"So you _are_ here,\" he said. His voice was small but cool, penetrating and metallic. I thought of fine steel wires. And, when I replied, my own voice had something of the same quality.  \"Were you expecting me?\" I said. He nodded, shaking my hand briefly and quietly.  \"We know all about you,\" he answered. I was pleased--it made things simpler--but I wanted to ask him who I was. I didn't remember anything up to the moment of my awakening on the other side of the hill. Instead, I asked him:  \"Shall I go aboard?\" He nodded again, and waved his hand toward the ladder. I went aboard lithely, and he followed. The girl and I glanced at each other; I was surprised and rather disturbed by her beauty and cleanness of body. I turned to the man, a little embarrassed, as she manipulated some controls and set the ship in motion again.  \"You'll have to forgive me,\" I said. \"Something has happened, and I don't know things. I've completely lost my memory.\"  They understood at once.  \"Your name is Baret.\" He pronounced it oddly. \"I am Edvar, and this girl is Selda.\" We all looked at each other intently, and I went on hesitantly.  \"I don't know where I am. Can you tell me something about myself?\" Edvar shook his head.  \"Only"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25862"],["title","The Chamber of Life (#2)"],["body","s,\" he said, \"that we were notified of your presence and your name. This city is Richmond.\" I glanced about quickly.  \"Richmond!\" I exclaimed. \"Virginia?\" But he shook his head.  \"I don't understand you,\" he replied.  I went on, with a puzzled frown. \"It has changed....\" Both of them looked at me curiously.  \"How has it changed, Baret?\" the girl, Selda, asked me. I glanced at her absently and closed my eyes.  \"Why ... I don't know,\" I stammered, \"I don't remember.\" For a few moments there was silence, except for the shouting of the wind past our ship. Then Selda asked me another question.  \"Where are you from?\" I shook my head helplessly, and answered again, \"I don't know--I don't remember.\"         *       *       *       *       *  A moment later we dipped into the shadow of the building, which they called Richmond. We slipped by a succession of vast and intricate façades until we came to a court-like terrace, hundreds of feet above the ground and sheltered on three sides by walls that leaped up toward the sky for hundreds of feet more. The effect of height was dizzying and magnificent.  Selda brought the ship to a quick and graceful landing. I found that we were in a large paved court like a public square, facing the east and the sun, which bathed it in cool bright light. It was still early in the morning. Innumerable windows looked down upon us, and a number of doorways led into the building on all sides. From one of these a girl stepped forward. Edvar spoke to her, evidently reporting himself and Selda. The girl pushed several buttons on a small cabinet which hung from her shoulder. It rang, low and silvery, twice. Then she pointed to me.  \"Who is that?\" she asked.  \"His name is Baret,\" Edvar told her. \"I was sent to meet him.\"  \"But where is he from? He is not registered.\"  \"We don't know. It's an unusual circumstance,\" he explained, while the girl examined us all carefully. \"Very well,\" she said finally, \"you must attend him until he is registered. I'll notify Odom.\" Edvar nodded, and we turned away.  Glancing back as we crossed the court, I saw the ship descending noiselessly, on the square of pavement where it had landed, into the depths of the building, while the girl made other gestures with her little cabinet. Then we passed through a doorway into the subdued glow of artificial lighting.  \"Why was she so worried?\" I asked Edvar. \"I don't understand anything, you know.\"  \"You were not registered,\" he said. \"We are all registered, of course, in our own cities. The authorities know where to find us at any moment of the day during our routine. If we leave the city, or depart from our usual program, naturally we note down where we are going, registering ourselves upon our departure and upon our return. If we visit another city, our arrival there is expected and reported here, as well as our departure.\"  \"Is all that necessary?\" I asked him. \"Is there a war, perhaps?\"  \"No,\" he said, \"it's customary. It prevents confusion. Everything we do is recorded. This conversation, for instance, is being recorded in the telepathic laboratory at this moment--each of us has a record there. They are open to the public at any time. It makes dishonor impossible.\"  We paused at a doorway, and Edvar spoke a word. It opened noiselessly and we went into his apartment.  \"We are assigned to you this morning,\" Edvar said. \"We are at your service.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The apartment was hardly very different from what I had unconsciously expected. It seemed to have two rooms and a bath. The room we entered was a sort of study. It was hung with drapes closely woven from some light metal, with cold designs that were suggestive of mechanical, mathematic conceptions, but inspiring in much the way that the lines of the building were inspiring. There were no pictures and no mirrors. All the furniture was made in straight lines, of metal, and somewhat futuristic in design. The chairs, however, were deep and comfortable, although the yielding upholstery appeared at first sight hard and brittle as metal sheets. The room was perfectly bare, and the color scheme a dull silver and black. To me it seemed extremely somber, but it pleased Edvar and his companion.  The first thing I noted when we sat down was the absence of any small articles--books or papers or lamps--and I remarked on this, somewhat rudely perhaps, to Edvar.  \"Whatever you wish is accessible,\" he explained with a smile. He rose and went to the draped wall. Drawing back the folds of the curtains in several places, he showed the metal wall covered with dials and apparatus. I noted especially a small screen, like a motion picture screen. Later I was to find that it served not only for amusement, showing sound-pictures projected automatically from a central office, but also for news and for communication, like a telephone.  \"Would you care for breakfast?\" Edvar asked me. I accepted eagerly, and he manipulated some dials on the wall. A moment or two later a small section of the wall opened, and a tray appeared. Edvar placed it on the table by my chair.  \"We have had our breakfast,\" he explained, and I began to eat with a keener appetite than I thought I had. It was a simple meal with a slightly exotic flavor, but without any strange dishes. During the course of it, I asked Edvar questions.  \"Your life is amazingly centralized,\" I said. \"Apparently all the things you need are supplied at your rooms on a moment's notice.\"  \"Yes,\" he smiled, \"it makes life simpler. We have very few needs. Many of them are satisfied while we sleep, such as cleansing and, if we like, nourishment. We can study while we sleep, acquiring facts that we may want to use later from an instrument which acts upon the subconscious mind. These dials you see are mainly to give us pleasure. If we care to have our meals served in the old-fashioned way, as you are having yours, we can do so, but we reserve those meals for the occasions when we feel the need of eating as a pure sensation. We can have music at any time--\" He paused. \"Would you care for some music?\"  \"There's nothing I'd like better,\" I told him. He went to the wall and turned the dials again. In a moment the room was filled with the subdued sound of a cool, melancholy music--Grieg, or some other composer, with whom I was unfamiliar, exotic and reminiscent in mood, cool, and quiet with a touch of acutely sweet pain. I listened to it in silence for a while. It was so subtle and pervasive, however, that it seemed to play directly upon the subconscious mind, so that the listener could go on thinking and talking uninterruptedly without losing any of the feeling of the melody.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Have you no private possessions?\" I asked. \"Things that you share with no one? Your own books, your own music, your own jewelry, perhaps?\"  \"We have no need of them,\" he replied. After a moment's thought, he added, \"We have our own emotions, and our own work--that's all. We do not care for jewels, or for decoration for its own sake. The things we use and see daily are beautiful in themselves, through their perfect utility and their outward symbolism of utility and creation. Our tools and our furniture are beautiful according to our own conceptions of beauty--as you can see.\" He made a gesture about the room.  \"And who serves you with those meals, and the music, and the knowledge you learn in your sleep? Who does the work?\"  \"We all do the work. Each of us has his own work. Each of us is a craftsman and a creative artist. The real work is done by machine--our machines are the basic structure of our life. But we have men, highly trained and fitted temperamentally for their professions, who watch and direct the machines. It is a matter of a few hours a day, devoted to fine problems in mechanics or building or invention. The rest of our time is our own, and the machines go on moving automatically as we have directed them to move. If every man on earth should die this morning, it would be perhaps fifty years or a century before the last machine stopped turning.\"  \"And the rest of the time?\"  It was Selda who answered this time. \"We live. We devote ourselves to learning and creative thought. We study human relations, or we wander through the forests and the mountains, increasing the breadth and significance of our minds and emotions.\" Selda's voice, rising suddenly after her long silence, startled me, and I looked at her, disturbed again by some subtle attraction exercised over me by her body. We were silent a while, then I relapsed into my inner questionings, and turned to Edvar.  \"You must live under a sort of socialistic system,\" I said thoughtfully. \"Even a sort of communism?\"  \"In a sense. Rather it is an automatic life. The soul of the machine pervades us all, and the machines are beautiful. Our lives are logically and inevitably directed by environment and heredity just as the machines are inevitably directed by their functions and capabilities. When a child is born, we know already what he will do throughout his life, how long he will live, what sort of children he will have, the woman he will marry. The Bureau could tell you at this moment when my great-grandson will be born, when he will die, and what his life will do for the State. There are never any accidents in our lives.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"But how did you develop so highly technical a civilization?\" I asked.  \"We came to it gradually from the last government system. It was called the _phrenarchic system_--the rule of the mind. It was neither democracy nor monarchy nor dictatorship. We found that we could tell the temperament and characteristics of a child from his early years, and we trained certain children for government. They were given power according to the qualities of their minds and according to the tasks for which they were fitted. We even bred them for governing. Later, when the machine began to usurp the place of labor all "]]]
