You're exempt, of course. We don't bother with cripples, kids, old ladies nor natural criminals.\" This attempt to be witty trailed off weakly.  \"Well, my friend here is carrying glass and we can't tarry now. Any interference with him will result in my turning criminal instanter, and I'm keen to do so. Go on, Gus.\"  Gus went on, and Bill, with weapon still in hand, followed after. He turned to call back to the flabbergasted five:  \"You can find us in our room any time after to-day. Getting hazed is really great sport, and we won't pull any guns on you then!\"  Hardly half an hour elapsed before there came a knock at the door of the room occupied by Bill and Gus. A moment before, Gus had been down to get a pair of pliers that had dropped out of the window and two wide-eyed lads in the hallway had hailed him:  \"That crutch-thumper that rooms with you is in for the G. B.,\" one had said and the other had added:  \"Say, he must be a blamed fool to carry a gun and pull it here. 'Prex' won't stand for that.\"  Bill called a \"Come in\" in answer to the knock, and no less than President Field and Professor Whitcomb, both looking very stern, entered.  \"Brown and Grier, I have heard with real pain and very great surprise, after the letter from Professor Gray highly recommending you two lads, that you have so soon shown utter disregard for the rules, the standing, the decency of our institution by carrying and drawing a deadly weapon, a pistol, and on slight provocation. This is deserving of instant expul----\"  \"Sure is, Doctor Field, if it were so. But it isn't. And please, also, do not hold the idea that it was on slight provocation. They were going to haze us, or rather Gus here, Doctor. We had just seen something of this sort, with the result that Fleming, of Chicago, had a ruined suit and panama, a fine watch destroyed, and a lot of money and papers probably lost. We came here to study; our means are limited; if we met with such a disaster our finances wouldn't stand it and we'd have to go home; that's all there is to it. Now, I can't offer you a cigar, Doctor, because you don't and I don't smoke, but if I did I'd probably carry them in this case.\"  With that Bill drew forth the nickeled pistol again, snapped it open and disclosed a rather unique cigar case which he extended toward the men.  \"Oh, you mean that this thing was----\"  \"Just that, Doctor. I hope we have respect for the institution to which we have come for a much needed and wanted education. But I saw no harm in fooling those chaps who think they have the right to compel us to lose a lot of time and money. Am I right?\"  President Field was human; he tilted back his head and laughed most heartily, nudging the professor also, in quite a boyish way.  \"We are greatly relieved, and I wish you had scared those young rascals more than you did. Professor, we shall simply have to put a stop to this hazing--stop it under pain of dismissal. And this joke, now--it should be mentioned at chapel, eh? I really want to thank you, young gentlemen, for doing the school a distinct favor.\"  \"We hope to add to the joke somewhat by to-morrow, if you will kindly hold up that hazing ban for one day.\"  \"And how is that, may I ask?\"  \"Would you mind if we keep it a small secret until then? We can promise to refrain from anything dreadful.\"  \"But then we----\"  \"Please, Doctor. This, if you will trust us, will do more real good than anything the faculty can do in the way of _verboten_. Just twenty-four hours, Doctor.\"  \"Well, well, we shall see. From what Gray wrote, I think we may trust you. Good evening, boys.\"                                    CHAPTER III                                   HAZED?   At the long supper table in the spacious basement of the dormitory, many curious glances were aimed at Bill and Gus, and many a terse remark was shot at them respecting their departure from the honorable ways and the rules of the school. Most pronounced were the expressions of wonder over the fact that the carrier of concealed weapons had not been expelled, or suspended at once. Finally a sophomore whose influence seemed to count most gave voice to the prevailing sentiment:  \"Well, I must say if that gun had been pulled on me, I'd have made the cad use it.\"  \"I'll bet you would, too, Siebold!\" declared an admirer.  Bill got on his feet and there was an instant hush. There was something to expect from the daring and apparently successful gunman. He laughed, and that also charged the atmosphere. When he spoke he had undivided attention:  \"You would have run like any other scared puppy,\" Bill said to Siebold. \"We would have listened to you ki-yi-ing for about a mile. Say, look here, you hazers: You're a bunch of muts! Hear me? The whole lot of you couldn't haze anybody that puts up a fight, if you played anyway fair and gave a little notice. We'll give you a dare, Siebold, you and all your deputies, though I suppose you'll send them and hang back yourself. We'll be ready to take all the hazing you fellows can give to-morrow afternoon at about three o'clock; only there isn't one of you who will have the nerve to show up. Oh, 'no weapons?' That was only a cigar case I pulled on you to-day. It wouldn't shoot, but, by cracky, it worked!\" And Bill laughed, with Gus and a few others who admired the boy's nerve.  There was a sensation at once. Never before in the history of the school had a freshman dared the upper classmen to haze him, or had named the time and place. Would such a plan hold out?  It would, and it did. The very novelty of the thing had assured it, as Bill expected. Some little time before the hour given, a number of would-be spectators began to gather in the hallway, as Bill and Gus, studying in their room, could tell from the tramping of feet outside their door. Then there was the louder tramp of feet coming nearer and without a preliminary call or knock the door flew open. The chums looked up from their books with well simulated surprise. In the doorway and crowding behind stood several upper classmen and easy confidence was written all over their eager faces.  \"Come right in, gentlemen; we are at your service,\" said Bill.  \"Ho, men! What's this? Wire entanglements?\"  The question was opportune; flimsily stretched across in front of the attacking party and about shoulder high were some copper wires, and about equally spaced below were others. It could be seen that these offered no serious check, as anyone could spread them apart and push through. It was evidently with this intention that the hazers fairly struggled through the door in the effort of each to be first--at least half a dozen youths had their hands on the wires. Then Bill leaned back against the wall and his hand came in contact with a button.  Pandemonium! Cries of distress, yells of something more than discomfort, howls of dismay, calls for succor--the S O S in other than code signals. This was a very pretty chorus increased by some others who, hastily coming to the rescue, also became entangled. The rest, chiefly onlookers, refrained from too close acquaintance with the very apparent cause of all the trouble. But the truly crucial part of the crisis was due to the fact that those who suffered by contact with the wires found it impossible to get away from the source of distress.                                    CHAPTER IV                           GOOD WILL AND FIXTURES   Bill made another motion touching the wall button, and instantly, with a combined and very audible gasp, the seven youths relaxed, got away from the wires and stood up. There would probably have been a general retreat mixed with a volley of expletives hurled at Bill and Gus, had not Gus taken a hand in the prevention of this, as planned. A stream of water from a long syringe, aimed over the heads of the sufferers, had cleared the doorway of spectators. The jerk of a ceiling cord slammed the door shut and it was deadlatched, requiring a key to open it. The would-be hazers, thus trapped and fearful of attempting a further attack, turned, perforce, to face their captors.  But there was one fellow, Albert Shurtlief, who so deeply resented the electric shocking that his desire for instant retaliation robbed him of caution. He was coming right over the wires again and did get partly through before another touch of the wall button gave him a second siege of writhing. The others looked on in wonder, convinced that the best thing they could do was to remain quiescent. Gus said:  \"Let up on him, Bill, and if he wants to come through----\"  Again the button. The still furious sophomore did get past the wires and was going to make a rush at Bill when Gus stood in his way.  \"Now, please. You ought to go a little slow.\" That was a way Gus had in making a protest against what might end in a scrap. But without further ado, Shurtlief, who was commonly known as \"Scrapper Bert,\" let fly an angry fist right at Gus' exposed jaw.  If the electrically charged wires had surprised the mischief-making upper classmen, the sudden collapsing of their fistic champion shocked them even more. Scrapper Bert was rather noted for his prowess. No one cared to put on the gloves with him, nor to gain his displeasure. To see the new boy, a \"measly freshman,\" not as tall, as heavy nor as old as Bert, catch the assailant's hard-driven fist in the palm of an instantly extended hand and then let drive with his own right a neat, short-arm uppercut that got Bert just where he had meant to get Gus, was a needed lesson to the smug conceit that too often goes with added school years. Bert, from a seat on the floor, which he had taken without choice of the spot, regarded his opponent through half-closed eyes with a certain nonchalance, his anger fled. He slowly got to his feet, climbed back through the wires without further thought as to their being charged, and stood with his companions, quite submissive and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25753"],["title","Radio Boys Loyalty; Or, Bill Brown Listens In (#2)"],["body","ute.  As usual on all occasions demanding words, Bill's tongue was loosened:  \"Look here, fellows, we want to give you the right dope on this thing: You see we are here to study--to try and go through if our money holds out. Our people are not rich and, like Tom Edison when he was a boy, we've got to hustle on short allowance. And we really can't afford to be hazed, as you did that new chap yesterday. If we had to buy new clothes and watches and caps, we'd have to quit school--see? And we knew you never missed anybody much, so we naturally, asking your pardon, got up this nice little reception for you. Now to get right down to brass tacks, you see our position and respect it--everyone of you--and, putting yourselves in our position, you don't blame us, nor hold any grudges; isn't that so?\"  Siebold, spokesman, made reply, after thinking a little.  \"Oh, well, I suppose all is fair in war. You've had your innings now, of course, but we'll have ours later.\" And then he added: \"We'll get you.\"  From what Doctor Field said, Bill and Gus knew better. Hazing would be broken up on pain of expulsion, as it should be in all schools where the attendance is for business purposes, the getting of a technical education as a means of livelihood. The boys felt that perhaps in a college art course, where education becomes much play on the part of well-to-do lads, class fracases, bowl fights, initiations and the like may not be amiss, but they did not intend to let open brutality rob them of their chance to study. And, however sure they felt that Siebold's threat was idle, there would be a satisfaction in winning their own fight.  \"Now, that's just what we want to talk to you fellows about,\" Bill declared. \"You don't want to think about 'getting' us. We want you to call this all off and for good; we want you to give your word on it; see?\"  \"No; we can't--\" began Siebold.  \"Won't, eh?\" Bill's words came sharp and clear. \"Well, then, take a little more treatment for your blamed foolishness.\" And Bill touched another button.  The contortions, the writhings, the shrieks and cries that followed quite surpassed the former exhibitions. The well-worn woolen rug that fitted from wall to wall across the end of the room where stood the seven seemed to be charged with red hot needles. Suddenly these ceased to leap and jump and burn; the old rug and the hidden wires under it were again quiescent. But the strident voices of the afflicted prisoners were not silenced, though the late lamentings were given over to a medley of condemnations, appeals and pleadings.  \"Say, go a little slow on this!\"  \"Call it off, confound you!\"  \"Are you trying to electrocute us?\"  \"Say, Brown, please----\"  \"Let's call it quits, fellows!\"  \"We'll call it quits if you want. I suppose we've got to hand it to you two.\" This last from Siebold.  \"Going to call it all off, then? Give us your word! We can't believe that any fellows in Marshallton Tech would go back on their word.\" Bill was smiling genially.  \"That can't be called in question. All off. You're exempt.\" There was a general acquiescence to this. The door slowly and to the seven quite mysteriously swung open; the seven started to file out.  \"Good-by, fellows, and no hard feelings. We were only having a little fun with you as you were going to have with us. You can't----\"  \"Well, but you two have still got to remember,\" said Siebold, shaking his finger at Bill and Gus, \"that you are freshies and must keep in your places. You've got a little the better of us this time, but----\"  \"Golly, Dan,\" spoke up a fellow hazer, \"a _little_ the better? Strikes me we've all been good and licked and these chaps ought to get the credit for----\"  The voice died away along the hall and Bill turned to his chum.  \"We don't want any credit, do we, Gus? But we will get it just the same when this gets out. I sort o' think our little stock has gone up about one thousand percentum, even though we _are_ freshies.\"  This proved quite correct. In a few minutes a lot of freshmen had crowded into the room and there was a sprinkling of sophs also. Questioned eagerly, Bill explained quite freely the purpose of the encounter and its result. Whereupon a big, fat soph declared quite vehemently:  \"Huh! They were easily licked. No pluck. You're lucky to have run into a bunch of quitters.\"  \"You wouldn't have quit, eh, Jumbo?\" ventured another, grinning.  \"Huh! Nothing like this contraption--\" began the husky fellow, advancing and laying his hand on the top cross wire.  \"Not even for a little thing like this?\" queried Bill, reaching the wall button.  \"Ow! Blazes! Quit! Don't! Oh, darn! Stop! Turn--it--off! E-e-e-e-e-! Help!\" And the instant the stabbing current ceased, Fatty fell back from it and glared at Bill.  \"You really can't blame them for quitting, can you?\" asked Bill, and for answer the husky soph turned and fled from the room, followed by the jeering laughter of the crowd.  And that ended it. After Bill had asked the crowd if any or all of them wanted to test the \"convincer,\" as he called the electrical rigging, he bade the onlookers who filled the hallway a pleasant _au revoir_, and Gus again pulled the strings that closed the door.                                     CHAPTER V                              FAME AND FINANCES   Nothing could have taken place to put the lads from Freeport on the pedestal of fame more noticeably than this experiment. They had easily and modestly staged a complete breakdown of the hazing habit at Marshallton Tech. Strangely perhaps there was no blame nor suspicion put upon Bill and Gus for the subsequent edict from the faculty forbidding it. That seemed to be considered a natural aftermath to the news of the electrical reception of the hazers.  The stunt did more than earn the boys a large share of fame. It made them so deservedly popular, even with most of the upper classmen, that they soon counted a good many friends and a considerable number of patrons for radio construction. It is a rather odd fact that methods already mastered by those of their own age appeal to boys more than the teachings of their elders. So, although the students were getting, or had got, the theory of radio activity and the practice of wireless fully stuffed into them, they turned often to Bill and Gus for help. There were a number of the well-to-do, even among the seniors, who wanted radio receivers made, or coaching in making their own, and to this Bill and Gus responded out of school hours, with the consent of the president, thus earning a good many dollars.  So as not to interfere in any way with the school-shop program, and not to crowd those lads who were finding the room in the shop and the tools to their advantage, Bill and Gus rented an unused storeroom in the basement of the dormitory. They cleared it out, sent for their own tools at Freeport, purchased others--a foot-power lathe, a jigsaw and a hand wall-drill--and put up some benches. Besides working therein themselves, they charged also the modest price of twenty-five cents an hour to others mechanically inclined.  The liberal-minded school faculty found no fault with an arrangement which could only mean a more thorough learning and a finer comradeship among the students. The professors, who often visited and even worked in the little shop--some of them paying their quota also--came to refer familiarly to the place as the \"commercial and sales department.\"  Professor Grant, the very able teacher of physics, who possessed far more theoretical knowledge than practice, gave the boys many valuable ideas out of class, and got some himself, being also a deadhead. And Search, the manual-training teacher, who knew the use of tools as a bee knows honey, got a few ideas while imparting many, as he also was made welcome to tinker around the boys' shop.  These were truly strenuous days and weeks for Bill and Gus. They had little studying to do, for Bill grasped problems as a trout takes in minnows, and he needed but to coach Gus briefly. The latter spent only a quarter-hour each day in the gym, never indulging in contests, but content to work hard at the things that best kept him fit. He had elected not to put himself under the instructor, grudging the time. But one day when he went over and, with his bare, work-hardened fists, punched a lively rubber bag for several minutes, Professor LeRoy, who had been watching, came to Gus with almost a demand that he join the boxing class in view of the Marshallton Tech entering contests with other schools during the coming winter. But Gus declined.  \"No; I haven't the speed and I am weak with my left, as you may have noticed. Hurt it once on a lathe in my father's shop; never will be any good for quick work.\"  \"We will overcome that,\" said the instructor, \"develop it.\"  \"Also,\" declared the boy, \"I have neither the time nor the inclination. Must work and nothing much else. But I thank you, Professor.\"  \"Sorry, my boy; you've certainly got a wicked right and you can use the other.\"  \"I'd want to use both,\" asserted Gus, laughing.  As for Bill, the hours each day and all of Saturday spent in the shop sufficed for exercise; the rest was spent in study, brief eating and no more sleep than he needed. And nearly every moment that could be spared found both boys in their shop.  They had under way the construction of five radio receivers of the finer type, for each of which they would get sixty dollars, the materials costing about fifteen dollars. These receivers were equal to more than a thousand miles, with strong, durable batteries and very wide amplification. As with their first radio and the one for their good old friend, Mr. Hooper, they made nearly all the parts themselves, even to the switch arms, contacts, buzzer and binding posts, cutting all threads with a fine set of standard taps and dies.  They also had two crystal sets to make, for which they charged twenty dollars each, and made a profit of seventeen dollars over the cost of the"]]]
