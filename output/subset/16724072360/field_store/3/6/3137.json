So just drink that coffee, and then by and by we will take you to some people I know well, and you shall come and tell us in a day or two how sorry you are for being so foolish.”  The girl's dark hazel eyes looked steadily at them both; then she put out a thin white hand.  “You are very kind to me. I know it was very wicked to try and kill myself, but I was so lonely, and... and I had not eaten anything since Wednesday... and I wanted to die.” Then she covered her face and sobbed softly, whilst the doctor patted her on the shoulder and said--  “Don't worry, little girl; you are in good hands now. Never mind Mrs. Thornton and her un-kindness. You are better away from her--isn't she, Mr. Harrington?”  Mr. Harrington, knowing nothing about Mrs. Thornton, promptly said “Oh, most certainly,” and the girl's eyes met his for a second, and a faint smile flushed upon her pale lips. The tall, bearded, and brown-faced man's face seemed so full of pity.  “Now you must go to sleep for an hour or two,” said the doctor imperatively; “so now then, little girl, 'seepy-by, beddy-bo.' That's what _my_ mother used to say to me.”  Harrington followed the doctor out into the sergeant's room, where Inspector Walters, with his heels upon the table, was falling asleep.  “Sit down a moment, Mr. Harrington,” said Dr. Parsons, taking up a book which the sergeant had left upon the table; “this is a sad case. Here is a girl, Nellie Alleyne, age 19, nursery governess to Mrs. Lavery-Thornton, of Waverly, jumped into the water off the Quay; rescued by Water-police Constables Casey and Boyce.”  Harrington nodded.  “This girl has told me her story. She is alone and friendless in Sydney. She came out to Australia when she was seventeen, got a billet with this Mrs. Lavery-Thornton--who seems to be a perfect brute of a woman--suffered a two years' martyrdom, and then was dismissed from her situation with the large sum of twenty-two shillings in her pocket Tried to get another such position, but people wouldn't take her without a recommendation from her last place. The Thornton woman wouldn't give her one; said she was too independent. High-spirited girl with twenty-two shillings between her and starvation, wanders about from one registry office to another for a couple of weeks, living in a room in a Miller's Point slum; money all gone; pestered by brutes in the usual way, jumps into the water to end her miseries. Rough, isn't it?”  Harrington nodded. “Poor thing! I should like you, Dr. Parsons, to--to let her know that she _has_ friends. Will you let me help. Fifty pounds or a hundred pounds won't hurt me... and I've been stone-broke myself. But a man can always peg along in the bush; and it's an awful thing for a child like that to be adrift in a big city.”  The kind-hearted police doctor looked steadily into Harrington's face for a moment, then he said quietly--  “An awful thing indeed. But there are some good men in the world, Mr. Harrington, who are able and willing to save pure souls from destruction. You are one of them. Tom Walters and myself are both hard-up devils--we see a lot of misery, but can do nothing to alleviate it; a few shillings is all we can give.”  Harrington rose, and his sun-tanned face flushed as he drew out his cheque-book. “I never try to shove myself in, in such matters as these, doctor, but I should feel pleased if you will let me help.”  Then he wrote out a cheque for fifty pounds, pushed it over to the doctor, said he thought it was getting late, and that he had better get back to his hotel.  Dr. Parsons gave the sleeping inspector a shake, and in a few words told him what Harrington had done.  “You're a dashed fool, old man,” said Walters sleepily to Harrington; “most likely she'll blue your fifty quid, and then blackmail----”  The doctor's hand descended upon the inspector's shoulder. “Shut up, you beastly old wretch--do you think _all_ women are alike. Come, now, let us have another nip and get away. Mr. Harrington is tired. Sergeant!”  The sergeant came to the door.  “Thompson, take good care of that young _lady_. We happen to know her. If she awakes before eight o'clock in the morning, tell her that she is to stay with your wife till I come to see her at nine o'clock. Any effects, sergeant?”  “Yes, sir,” and the sergeant took out his note-book, “seven pawn tickets, five pennies, and a New Testament with 'Nellie Alleyne' written inside.”  “Here, give me those tickets, I'll take care of them; and Thompson, if the newspaper fellows come here to-night, say that the young lady fell over the wharf accidentally, and has gone home to her friends. See?”  “I see, sir,” said Thompson, as the good-hearted doctor slipped half a sovereign into his hand.  Then the three men stepped out into the street and strolled up to the Royal Hotel, and sat down in the smoking-room, which was filled with a noisy crowd, some of whom soon saw Walters and called him away, leaving the doctor and Harrington by themselves.  “Better take this back, Mr. Harrington,” and Dr. Parsons handed him his cheque. “Two or three pounds will be quite enough for the poor girl.”  “Not I,” said Harrington with a smile, “fifty pounds won't ruin me, as I said--and it may mean a lot to her, poor child. And I feel glad that I can help some one... some one who is all right, you know. Now I must be off. Good night, doctor.”  Parsons looked at the tall manly figure as he pushed his way through the noisy crowd in the smoking-room, and then at the cheque in his hand. “Well, there's a good fellow. Single man, I'll bet; else he wouldn't be so good to a poor little devil of a stranded girl. Didn't even ask her name. May the Lord send him a good wife.”  The Lord did not send Harrington a good wife; for the very next day he called upon Mrs. Lyndon, and Mrs. Lyndon took good care that he should be left alone with Myra; and Myra smiled so sweetly at him, when with outstretched hands she came into the drawing-room, that he fatuously believed she loved him. And she of course, when he asked her to be his wife, hid her face on his shoulder, and said she could not understand why he could love _her_. Why, she was quite an old maid! Amy and Gwen were ever so much prettier than she, and she was sure that both Gwen and Amy, even though they were now both married, would feel jealous when they knew that big, handsome Jack Harrington had asked her to be his wife; and so on and so forth, as only the skilled woman of thirty, whose hopes of marriage are slipping by, knows how to talk and lie to an “eligible” man unused to women's ways. And Harrington kissed Myra's somewhat thin lips, and said--and believed--that he was the happiest man in Australia. Then Mrs. Lyndon came in, and, in the manner of mothers who are bursting with joy at getting rid of a daughter whose matrimonial prospects are looking gloomy, metaphorically fell upon Harrington's neck and wept down his back, and said he was robbing her of her dearest treasure, &c., &c. Harrington, knowing nothing of conventional women's ways, believed her, and married, for him, the most unsuitable woman in the world.  A week or so after his marriage he received a letter from Dr. Parsons enclosing the cheque he had given him for Nellie Alleyne:--  “Dear Harrington,--Girl won't take the cheque. Has a billet--cashier in a restaurant. Says she is writing to you. She's true gold. You ought to marry her and take her away with you to your outlandish parts. Would ask her to marry me--if I could keep her; but she wouldn't have me whilst you are about. Always glad to see you at my diggings; whisky and soda and such, and a hearty welcome.”  And by the same post came a letter from the girl herself--a letter that, simply worded as it was, sent an honest glow through his heart:--       “Dear Mr. Harrington,--I shall never, never forget your      kindness to me; as long as I live I shall never forget Dr.      Parsons tells me that you live in Queensland--more than a      thousand miles from Sydney, and that you are going away      soon. Please will you let me call on you before you go away?      I shall be so unhappy if I do not see you again, because in      a letter I _cannot_ tell you how I thank you, how deeply      grateful I am to you for your goodness and generosity to me.      “Yours very sincerely,       “Helen Alleyne.”  Harrington showed the letter to Myra, who bubbled over with pretty expressions of sympathy and wrote and asked her to call. Nellie did call, and the result of her visit was that when Harrington took his newly married wife to Tinandra Downs, she went with her as companion. And from the day that she entered the door of his house, Helen Alleyne had proved herself to be, as Dr. Parsons had said, “true gold.” As the first bright years of prosperity vanished, and the drought and financial worries all but crushed Harrington under the weight of his misfortunes, and his complaining, irritable wife rendered his existence at home almost unbearable, her brave spirit kept his from sinking under the incessant strain of his anxieties. Mrs. Harrington, after her third child was born, had given up even the semblance of attending to the children, and left them to Nellie and the servants. She was doing quite enough, she once told her husband bitterly, in staying with him at such a horrible place in such a horrible country. But she nevertheless always went away to the sea-coast during the hottest months, and succeeded in having a considerable amount of enjoyment, leaving the children and Jack and Miss Alleyne to swelter through the summer at Tinandra Downs as best they could.     IV  It was nearly midnight as Harrington took down the slip-rails and led his horse through the paddock up to the house, which, except for a dimly burning lamp in the dining-room, was in darkness. The atmosphere was close and sultry, and the perspiration ran down his skin in streams as he gave his horse to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25061"],["title","The Penal Cluster (#1)"],["body","be, don't she?\"  \"Shut up,\" said Houston conversationally. \"And give me a cigarette,\" he added.  \"There's a package of Players in my shirt pocket,\" Arthmore said, keeping his hands on the wheel.         *       *       *       *       *  Houston fished out a cigarette, lit it, and returned the pack.  Apropos of nothing, Arthmore said: \"Reminds me of the time I was workin' for a printer, see? We 'ad to print up a bunch of 'andbills advertisin' a church charity bazaar. Down at the bottom was supposed to be printed 'Under the auspices of St. Bede's-on-Thames.' So I--\"  He went on with a long, rambling tale about making a mistake in printing the handbill. Houston paid little attention. He smoked in silence, keeping his eyes on the red glow of the taillight ahead of them.  Neither man mentioned the approaching climax of the chase. Even hardened veterans of the Psychodeviant Police don't look forward to the possibility of having their minds taken over, controlled by some outside force.  It had never happened to Houston, but he knew that Arthmore had been through the experience once. It evidently wasn't pleasant.  \"--and the boss was 'oppin' mad,\" Arthmore was saying, \"but, crikey, 'ow was I to know that _auspice_ was spelled A-U-S-P-I-C-E?\"  Houston grinned. \"Yeah, sure. How're we doing with Sir Lewis?\"  \"Seems to be headed in the right direction,\" Arthmore said, suddenly dropping the Cockney accent. \"This is the route I'd take if I were headed for Upper Berkeley Mews. He probably hasn't told the driver to change addresses--maybe he won't.\"  \"The victims never do,\" Houston said. \"He probably is actually headed toward Number 37 Upper Berkeley Mews.\"  \"Yeah. Nobody's perfect,\" said Arthmore.         *       *       *       *       *  Forty-five minutes of steady progress through the streets of Greater London brought Sir Lewis Huntley to Upper Berkeley and to the short dead-end street which constituted the Mews. By the time the dapper baronet stepped out of the machine and paid his driver, the whole area was surrounded by and filled with the well-armed, silent, and careful agents of the Psychodeviant Police.  Number 37 was an old concrete-and-steel structure of the George VI period, faced with a veneer of red brick. It had obviously been remodeled at least once to make the façade more modern and more fashionable; the red-violet anodized aluminum was relatively fresh and unstained. It wouldn't have taken vast wealth to rent a flat in the building, but neither would an average income have been quite enough.  Houston looked out of the window of Arthmore's cab and glanced at the tiers of windows in the building. Presumably, the man they were looking for was up there--somewhere.  _So you occupy a station in the upper middle-class_, thought Houston. It checked. Every bit of evidence that came his way seemed to check perfectly and fit neatly into the hypothesis which he had formed. Soon it would be time to test that theory--but the time had not yet come.  \"Stand by and wait for orders, Houston,\" said the speaker in Houston's ear. \"We've got men inside the building.\"  Sir Lewis Huntley opened the sparkling, translucent door of Number 37 Upper Berkeley Mews and went inside.  Arthmore pulled the cab over to the curb a few yards from the entrance and the two men waited in silence. All around them were other men, some in private cars, some walking slowly along the street. All of them were part of the net that had gathered to catch one man.  _Poor fish_, Houston thought wryly.  There was no noise, no excitement. Five minutes after Sir Lewis had entered the front door, it opened again. A man whom Houston had never seen before stepped out and gestured with one hand. At the same time, Houston's speaker said: \"They've got him. Hit him with a stun gun when he tried to get out through the fire exit.\"  An ambulance which had been waiting at the entrance of the Mews pulled up in front of Number 37, and a minute or so later a little clot of men came out bearing a stretcher, which was loaded into the ambulance. Immediately after them came another man who had a firm, but polite grip on the arm of Sir Lewis Huntley.  Houston sighed and leaned back in his seat. That was that. It was all over. Simple. Nothing to it.  Another Controller had been apprehended by the Psychodeviant Police. Another deviant, already tried and found guilty, was ready to be exiled from Earth and imprisoned on one of the Penal Asteroids. All in the day's work.  _There's just one thing I'd like to know_, Houston thought blackly. _What in the hell's going on?_         *       *       *       *       *  In his hotel room near Piccadilly Circus, several hours later, David Houston sat alone, drink in hand, and put that same question to himself again.  \"What's going on?\"  On the face of it, it was simple. On the face of it, the answer was right in front of him, printed in black and white on the front page of the evening _Times_.  Houston lifted the paper off the bed and looked at it. The banner line said: _Controller Captured in Lambeth!_  Beneath that, in smaller type, the headline added: Robert Harris Accused of Taking Control of Barrister Sir Lewis Huntley.  The column itself told the whole story. Mr. Robert Harris, of No. 37 Upper Berkeley Mews, had, by means of mental control, taken over the mind of Sir Lewis and compelled him to draw one thousand pounds out of his bank. While Sir Lewis was returning to Harris with the money, the United Nations Psychodeviant Police had laid a trap. Sir Lewis, upon recovering his senses when Harris was rendered unconscious by a stun gun, had given evidence to the PD Police and to officials at New Scotland Yard.  Houston looked at the full-color photo of Harris that was printed alongside the column. Nice-looking chap; late twenties or early thirties, Houston guessed. Blond-red hair, blue eyes. All-in-all, a very pleasant, but ordinary sort of man.  There had been evidence that a Controller had been at work in London for some weeks now. Twelve days before, several men, following an impulse, had mailed twenty pounds to a \"Richard Hempstead,\" General Delivery, Waterloo Station. By the time the matter had come to the authorities' attention, the envelopes had been called for and the Controller had escaped.  Robert Harris was not the first Controller to be captured, nor, Houston knew, would he be the last. The first one had shown up more than sixteen years before, in Dallas, Texas, USA.  Houston grinned as he thought of it. Projective telepathy had only been a crackpot's idea back then. In spite of the work of many intelligent, sane men, who had shown that mental powers above and beyond the ordinary did exist, the average man simply laughed off such nonsense. It was mysticism; it was magic; it was foolish superstition. It was anything but true.  But ever since \"Blackjack\" Donnely had practically taken control of the whole city of Dallas, the average man had changed his mind. It was still mysterious; it was still magic; but now the weird machinations of the supernormal mind were something to be feared.  In the sixteen years that had ensued since the discovery of the abnormal mental powers of \"Blackjack\" Donnely, rumors had spread all over the world. There were supposed to be men who could levitate--fly through the air at will. Others could walk through walls, and still others could make themselves invisible. The horrible monsters that were supposed to be walking the Earth were legion.         *       *       *       *       *  Actually, only one type of supernormal psychodeviant had been found--the telepath, the mindreader who could probe into the mental processes of others. Worse than that, the telepath could project his own thoughts into the mind of another, so that the victim supposed that the thoughts were his own. Actually, it was a high-powered form of hypnotism; the victim could be made to do anything the projective telepath wanted him to.  \"Blackjack\" Donnely had made that clear in his trial in Texas.  Donnely had been a big man--big physically, and important in city politics. He had also been as arrogant as the Devil himself.  It was the arrogance that had finally tripped up Donnely. He had thought himself impregnable. Haled into court on charges of misappropriation of public funds, he had just sat and smirked while several witnesses for the State admitted that they had aided Donnely, but they claimed he had \"hypnotized\" them. Donnely didn't try to interfere with the evidence--that's where he made his mistake. And that's where his arrogance tripped him up.         *       *       *       *       *  If he'd used telepathic projection to influence the State Attorney or the witnesses or the judge or the Grand Jury _before_ the trial, he might never have been discovered as the first of the Controllers. But that wasn't Donnely's style.  \"None of this namby-pamby stuff,\" he had once been quoted as saying; \"if you got enemies, don't tease 'em--show 'em who's running things. Blackjack 'em, if you have to.\"  And that's exactly what \"Blackjack\" Donnely had done. The trial was a farce from beginning to end; each witness gave his evidence from the stand, and then Donnely took control of their minds and made them refute every bit of it, publicly and tearfully apologizing to the \"wonderful Mr. Donnely\" for saying such unkind things about him.  The judge and the jury knew something funny was going on, but they had no evidence, one way or another. The case, even at that point, might have ended with an acquittal or a hung jury, but Donnely wasn't through using his blackjack.  He took over the mind of the foreman of the jury. The foreman claimed later that the jury had decided that they could reach no decision. Other jurors claimed that they had decided Donnely was guilty, but that was probably an _ex post facto_ switch. It didn't matter, anyway; when the foreman came out, he pronounced Donnely innocent. That should have ended it.  The other jurors began"]]]
