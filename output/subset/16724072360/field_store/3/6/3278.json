Armed Soviet moon-cats are, at this moment, moving toward the downed craft.  \"Base Commander Colonel A. V. Gryaznov is quoted as saying: 'There can be no doubt that we shall learn much from this craft, since it is apparently of extraterrestrial origin. We will certainly be able to overpower any resistance it may offer, since it has already proved vulnerable to our weapons. The missiles which were fired toward our base were easily destroyed by our own antimissile missiles, and the craft was unable to either destroy or avoid our own missiles.'  \"Further progress will be released by the Soviet Government as it occurs.\"  Senator Cannon dropped the sheet of paper to his side. \"That's it. Matt, come in the bedroom; I'd like to talk to you.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Matthew Fisher, candidate for Vice President of the United States, heaved his two-hundred-fifty-pound bulk out of the chair he had been sitting in and followed the senator into the other room. Behind them, the others suddenly broke out into a blather of conversation. Fisher's closing of the door cut the sound off abruptly.  Senator Cannon threw the newssheet on the nearest bed and swung around to face Matthew Fisher. He looked at the tall, thick, muscular man trying to detect the emotions behind the ugly-handsome face that had been battered up by football and boxing in college, trying to fathom the thoughts beneath the broad forehead and the receding hairline.  \"You got any idea what this _really_ means, Matt?\" he asked after a second.  Fisher's blue-gray eyes widened almost imperceptibly, and his gaze sharpened. \"Not until just this moment,\" he said.  Cannon looked suddenly puzzled. \"What do you mean?\"  \"Well,\" Fisher said thoughtfully, \"you wouldn't ask me unless it meant something more than appears on the surface.\" He grinned rather apologetically. \"I'm sorry, Jim; it takes a second or two to reconstruct exactly what _did_ go through my mind.\" His grin faded into a thoughtful frown. \"Anyway, you asked me, and since you're head of the Committee on SPACE Travel and Exploration--\" He spread his hands in a gesture that managed to convey both futility and apology. \"The mystery spacecraft is ours,\" he said decisively.  James Cannon wiped a palm over his forehead and sat down heavily on one of the beds. \"Right. Sit down. Fine. Now; listen: We--the United States--have a space drive that compares to the rocket in the same way that the jet engine compares to the horse. We've been keeping it under wraps that are comparable to those the Manhattan Project was kept under 'way back during World War II. Maybe more so. But--\" He stopped, watching Fisher's face. Then: \"Can you see it from there?\"  \"I think so,\" Fisher said. \"The Soviet Government knows that we have something ... in fact, they've known it for a long time. They don't know what, though.\" He found a heavy briar in his pocket, pulled it out, and began absently stuffing it with tobacco from a pouch he'd pulled out with the pipe. \"Our ship didn't shoot at their base. Couldn't, wouldn't have. Um. They shot it down to try to look it over. Purposely made a near-miss with an atomic warhead.\" He struck a match and puffed the pipe alight.  \"Hm-m-m. The Soviet Government,\" he went on, \"must have known that we had something 'way back when they signed the Greenston Agreement.\" Fisher blew out a cloud of smoke. \"They wanted to change the wording of that, as I remember.\"  \"That's right,\" Cannon said. \"We wanted it to read that 'any advances in _rocket engineering_ shall be shared equally among the Members of the United Nations', but the Soviet delegation wanted to change that to 'any advances in _space travel_'. We only beat them out by a verbal quibble; we insisted that the word 'space', as used, could apply equally to the space between continents or cities or, for that matter, between any two points. By the time we got through arguing, the UN had given up on the Soviet amendment, and the agreement was passed as was.\"  \"Yeah,\" said Fisher, \"I remember. So now we have a space drive that doesn't depend on rockets, and the USSR wants it.\" He stared at the bowl of his briar for a moment, then looked up at Cannon. \"The point is that they've brought down one of our ships, and we have to get it out of there before the Russians get to it. Even if we manage to keep them from finding out anything about the drive, they can raise a lot of fuss in the UN if they can prove that it's our ship.\"  \"Right. They'll ring in the Greenston Agreement even if the ship technically isn't a rocket,\" Cannon said. \"Typical Soviet tactics. They try to time these things to hit at the most embarrassing moments. Four years ago, our worthy opponent got into office because our administration was embarrassed by the Madagascar Crisis. They simply try to show the rest of the world that, no matter which party is in, the United states is run by a bunch of inept fools.\" He slapped his hand down on the newssheet that lay near him. \"This may win us the election,\" he said angrily, \"but it will do us more harm in the long run than if our worthy opponent stayed in the White House.\"  \"Of what avail to win an election and lose the whole Solar System,\" Fisher paraphrased. \"It looks as though the President has a hot potato.\"  \"'Hot' is the word. Pure californium-254.\" Cannon lit a cigarette and looked moodily at the glowing end. \"But this puts us in a hole, too. Do we, or don't we, mention it on the TV debate this evening? If we don't, the public will wonder why; if we do, we'll put the country on the spot.\"  Matt Fisher thought for a few seconds. Then he said, \"The ship must have already been having trouble. Otherwise it wouldn't have been hovering in plain sight of the Soviet radar. How many men does one of those ships hold?\"  \"Two,\" the senator told him.  \"We do have more than one of those ships, don't we?\" Fisher asked suddenly.  \"Four on Moon Base; six more building,\" said Senator Cannon.  \"The downed ship must have been in touch with--\" He stopped abruptly, paused for a second, then said: \"I have an idea, Senator, but you'll have to do the talking. We'll have to convince the President that what we're suggesting is for the good of the country and not just a political trick. And we don't have much time. Those moon-cats shouldn't take more than twelve or fifteen hours to reach the ship.\"  \"What's your idea?\"  \"Well, it's pretty rough right now; we can't fill in the details until we get more information, but--\" He knocked the dottle from his pipe and began outlining his scheme to the senator.         *       *       *       *       *  Major Valentin Udovichenko peered through the \"windshield\" of his moon-cat and slowed the vehicle down as he saw the glint of metal on the Earthlit plain ahead. \"Captain!\" he snapped. \"What does that look like to you?\" He pointed with a gloved hand.  The other officer looked. \"I should say,\" he said after a moment, \"that we have found what we have been looking for, major.\"  \"So would I. It's a little closer to our base than the radarmen calculated, but it certainly could have swerved after it dropped below the horizon. And we know there hasn't been another ship in this vicinity.\"  The captain was focusing a pair of powerful field glasses on the object. \"That's it!\" he said bridling his excitement. \"Egg-shaped, and no sign of rocket exhausts. Big dent in one side.\"  Major Udovichenko had his own binoculars out. \"It's as plain as day in this Earthlight. No sign of life, either. We shouldn't have any trouble.\" He lowered the binoculars and picked up a microphone to give the other nine moon-cats their instructions.  Eight of the vehicles stayed well back, ready to launch rockets directly at the fallen spacecraft if there were any sign of hostility, while two more crept carefully up on her.  They were less than a hundred and fifty yards away when the object they were heading for caught fire. The major braked his vehicle to a sudden halt and stared at the bright blaze that was growing and spreading over the metallic shape ahead. Bursts of flame sprayed out in every direction, the hot gases meeting no resistance from the near-vacuum into which they spread.  Major Udovichenko shouted orders into his microphone and gunned his own motor into life again. The caterpillar treads crunched against the lunar surface as both moon-cats wheeled about and fled. Four hundred yards from the blaze, they stopped again and watched.  By this time, the blaze had eaten away more than half of the hulk, and it was surrounded by a haze of smoke and hot gas that was spreading rapidly away from it. The flare of light far outshone the light reflected from the sun by the Earth overhead.  \"Get those cameras going!\" the major snapped. He knew that the eight moon-cats that formed the distant perimeter had been recording steadily, but he wanted close-ups, if possible.  None of the cameras got much of anything. The blaze didn't last long, fierce as it was. When it finally died, and the smoke particles settled slowly to the lunar surface, there was only a blackened spot where the bulk of a spaceship had been.  \"Well ... I ... will ... be--,\" said Major Valentin Udovichenko.         *       *       *       *       *  The TV debate was over. The senator and the President had gone at each other hot and heavy, hammer and tongs, with the senator clearly emerging as the victor. But no mention whatever had been made of the Soviet announcement from Luna.  At four thirty-five the next morning, the telephone rang in the senator's suite. Cannon had been waiting for it, and he was quick to answer.  The face that appeared on the screen was that of the President of the United States. \"Your scheme worked, senator,\" he said without preamble. There was an aloofness, a coolness in his voice. Which was only natural, considering the heat of the debate the previous evening.  \"I'm glad to hear it, Mr. "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26111"],["title","In A New World; or, Among The Gold Fields Of Australia (#1)"],["body"," a handsomely built and prosperous town of about five hundred thousand inhabitants. At the time of Harry's arrival it had less than half that number. The country bordering the river is not particularly inviting, but it was new, and the two boys regarded it with interest. The soil was barren and sandy, and the trees, which were numerous, were eucalyptus or gum trees, which do not require a rich soil, but grow with great rapidity on sterile soil.  \"What peculiar leaves?\" said Harry, \"they look like leather.\"  \"True,\" said the professor, \"and you notice that instead of having one surface toward the sky and the other toward the earth they are placed edgewise.\"  Soon they reached the mouth of the river, and there, just beyond the bar, rode the good ship _Arcturus_, on which the professor was to sail for Boston. His baggage was hoisted on board, and then the professor himself followed.  \"Will you come on board, boys?\" he asked.  \"No, sir; we will go back by the lighter.\"  \"Then good-by, and God bless you and bring you good luck.\"  Harry could not help feeling sober as he bade farewell to his good friend, the professor.  \"I have only you now, Jack,\" he said. \"I don't know what lies before us, but we must stick fast to each other in sunshine and in storm.\"  Jack's only answer was to seize Harry's hand and press it warmly. Nothing more was needed.     CHAPTER II.  PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE.  The two boys returned to the Crown Hotel in time for dinner, of which they partook with the zest to be expected of boys thoroughly healthy. When the meal was over they repaired to the public room.  \"Now, Jack,\" said Harry, \"it is necessary for us to settle on our plans.\"  \"All right,\" said Jack.  \"Have you anything to propose?\"  \"No, Harry, you are smarter than I am, and I leave it to you.\"  \"Thank you, Jack, for your confidence, but we are on a par here. Neither of us knows much about Australia. We have a great deal to learn.\"  \"Then you had better decide for us both.\"  \"Very well, I accept the responsibility, but I prefer to talk over my plans with you. First of all, then, shall we stay in Melbourne, or strike for the mines?\"  \"Just as you say, Harry, but I would prefer the mines.\"  \"I feel that way myself, and for that reason I have been making some inquiries. There are three principal localities, Ballarat, Bendigo, and Ovens. We might try one of the three, and if we don't have good luck make our-way to another.\"  \"Which shall we try first?\"  \"I have thought of Bendigo. I hear of one party that cleared two thousand pounds out of one hole.\"  \"How much is that?\" asked Jack, who was not very well acquainted with any but United States currency.  \"It is equal to ten thousand dollars,\" answered Harry.  \"That's a big pile of money,\" said Jack, his eyes sparkling.  \"True, but we mustn't expect to be so fortunate. It isn't everybody who succeeds as well as that.\"  \"I should be satisfied with a thousand, Harry.\"  \"And what would you do with it, Jack?\"  \"Convey it home to my mother, Harry. But I would fix it so that my step-father couldn't get hold of it.\"  \"You are a good boy, Jack, for thinking so much of your mother. I wish I had a mother to provide for,\" and Harry Vane looked sober.  \"Do you know how far off Bendigo is, Harry?\"  \"About a hundred miles. That is, it is seventy-five miles to Mount Alexander, and the mines are twenty-five miles to the north of that.\"  \"It won't take us long to travel a hundred miles,\" said Jack hopefully.  \"On the contrary, it will be a long and difficult journey, as far as I can find out. The country is full of bogs, swamps, and moist land.\"  \"Then we can't walk?\"  \"No; the custom is to charter a cart, drawn by oxen, which will give a chance to carry a stock of provisions. The roads are not very well marked, and are often impassable.\"  This description rather discouraged Jack, who was more used to the sea and its dangers than to land travel.  \"I wish we could go by water,\" he said.  \"So do I, Jack, but unfortunately Bendigo happens to be inland. However, you've got good stout legs, and can get along as well as the thousands that do go. Besides, it will give us a fine chance to see the country.\"  \"Ye-es,\" said Jack doubtfully, for he had very little of the traveller's curiosity that prompts so many to visit strange lands.  \"There's another difficulty besides the mud,\" continued Harry thoughtfully.  \"What's that?\"  \"The bushrangers.\"  \"Who are they?\"  \"Haven't you heard of them?\" asked Harry in surprise.  \"I heard two men speaking of them last night, but I didn't take much notice.\"  \"They are highwaymen--robbers, who wander about and attack parties of miners and travellers, and unless successfully resisted, strip them of all their property.\"  \"Are we likely to meet them?\" said Jack eagerly.  \"I hope not; but we stand a chance of doing so.\"  \"When are we going to start?\" asked Jack with alacrity.  \"Do you want to meet these gentlemen, Jack?\" inquired Harry with a smile.  \"There'll be some fun about it,\" responded Jack.  Harry shrugged his shoulders.  \"I don't think there'll be much fun about being robbed,\" he said. \"I would rather they would give us a wide berth, for my part.\"  Jack did not answer, but from that time he was eager to set out for the mines. The hint of danger invested the journey with a charm it had not hitherto possessed in his eyes.  While the boys were conversing, a tall man, with heavy black whiskers and wearing a rough suit and a slouch hat, appeared to listen attentively. At this point he rose from his seat, and lounged over to where Harry and Jack were seated.  \"Young gentlemen,\" he said, \"do I understand that you are thinking of going to the mines?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" answered Harry, surveying his inquirer with some attention.  \"And you talk of going to Bendigo?\"  \"Yes; do you know anything about the place?\"  \"I ought to. I only came from there last month.\"  \"What luck did you have there, may I ask?\"  \"Pretty fair. I brought back about a hundred and fifty pounds in gold dust:\"  \"And how long were you there?\"  \"Four weeks.\"  \"That is pretty good pay for the time.\"  \"That's so, especially as I made little or nothing the first three weeks. I struck it rich the last week.\"  \"What do you say to that, Jack?\" said Harry, turning to his companion; \"nearly eight hundred dollars in a month.\"  \"That pays better than being a sailor,\" answered Jack, smiling.  \"I should say it did.\"  \"When do you expect to start?\" asked the stranger.  \"As soon as we can get ready,\" Harry replied.  \"You are right there. Have you got money?\"  \"Why?\" asked Harry rather suspiciously.  \"It will cost something for an outfit.\"  \"Yes; we have a moderate sum with us.\"  \"That is well,\" said the stranger approvingly. \"Do you know,\" he continued meditatively, \"I have a great mind to go with you?\"  \"Then you are not satisfied with your pile?\" said Harry.  \"There's very little left of it,\" said their new acquaintance.  \"You haven't spent a hundred and fifty pounds in a month?\" said Harry in surprise.  \"Pretty much. I may have twenty pounds left.\"  \"You must have been living high, then.\"  \"No. I have lived plainly, but the faro table has taken most of it. I'm so near broke that I may as well go back to the mines for a fresh supply before my money is all gone.\"  \"We shall be glad of your company, sir. May I ask if you are an Australian?\"  \"I was born in England, but I have been out here half a dozen years.\"  \"And have not made your fortune yet?\"  \"It is my own fault. I have been unable to keep money after I got it.\"  \"We are from America.\"  \"I surmised it,\" said the stranger. \"That is a country I want to visit before I die. You have mines there, too.\"  \"Yes, but they are a long way from where we live.\"  \"My name is Fletcher--Dick Fletcher my friends call me.\"  \"I am Harry Vane, and my friend is Jack Pendleton.\"  \"We will drink to our better acquaintance. Here, John,\" addressing the barkeeper, \"three glasses of ale here.\"  \"If you won't mind, Jack and I will take sarsaparilla.\"  Fletcher stared at them in amazement.  \"You don't drink ale?\" he said.  \"We belong to the temperance society,\" said Harry, smiling.  \"You won't keep that up long at the mines,\" said Fletcher, shrugging his shoulders.  Harry did not reply, but quietly resolved that he would disprove that statement.     CHAPTER III.  FLETCHER ACTS SUSPICIOUSLY.  One circumstance led Harry to hurry his intended departure. He found to his dismay that the hotel charge for their very plain accommodations was a pound a day for each of them. The Crown inn was what would be called in an American city a one-horse hotel. There are plenty such to be found in the United States where the rate charged is but a dollar a day. But Melbourne was full of strangers, drawn thither by flaming accounts of the richness of the mines and the bright prospects of acquiring sudden fortunes, and war prices were prevalent everywhere.  \"Five dollars a day!\" exclaimed Jack in open-eyed amazement. \"Do they take us for millionaires?\"  \"I began to think they were imposing upon us,\" said Harry, \"till I made inquiries elsewhere. I find a pound a day is about the usual tariff for such accommodations as we have.\"  \"But we have only a small bedroom, and the meals are very common.\"  \"That is true, but it seems to make no difference.\"  \"Our money will soon be gone at that rate,\" said Jack soberly. \"Mine is already gone.\"  \"No, it isn't, Jack. We are going to share and share alike, you know.\"  \"But that is imposing on you, Harry,\" protested the young sailor earnestly.  \"Let me judge of that, Jack; I'd a good deal rather have your company and half of the money than be alone and have the whole.\"  \"Thank you, Harry. You are a true friend. I can't do much for you, but I'll do what I can.\"  \"If I had known of the high prices, I would have drawn more money from the professor,\" continued Harry. \"However, I can make this do. But I want to start to-morrow, if possible. We shall then be owing four days' board each, and that will make"]]]
