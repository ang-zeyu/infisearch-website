From the inside, Atronics City is even jollier. There's the top level, directly under the dome, which is mainly parking area for scooters and tuggers of various kinds, plus the office shacks of the Assayer's Office, the Entry Authority, the Industry Troopers and so on. The next three levels have all been burned into the bowels of the planetoid.  Level two is the Atronics plant, and a noisy plant it is. Level three is the shopping and entertainment area--grocery stores and clothing stores and movie theaters and bars--and level four is housing, two rooms and kitchen for the unmarried, four rooms and kitchen plus one room for each child for the married.  All of these levels have one thing in common. Square corners, painted olive drab. The total effect of the place is suffocating. You feel like you're stuck in the middle of a stack of packing crates.  Most of the people living in Atronics City work, of course, for International Atronics, Incorporated. The rest of them work in the service occupations--running the bars and grocery stores and so on--that keep the company employees alive and relatively happy.  Wages come high in the places like Atronics City. Why not, the raw materials come practically for free. And as for working conditions, well, take a for instance. How do you make a vacuum tube? You fiddle with the innards and surround it all with glass. And how do you get the air out? No problem, boy, there wasn't any air in there to begin with.  At any rate, there I was at Atronics City. That was as far as _Demeter_ would take me. Now, while the ship went on to Ludlum City and Chemisant City and the other asteroid business towns, my two suitcases and I dribbled down the elevator to my hostelry on level four.         *       *       *  Have you ever taken an elevator ride when the gravity is practically non-existent? Well, don't. You see, the elevator manages to sink faster than you do. It isn't being _lowered_ down to level four, it's being _pulled_ down.  What this means is that the suitcases have to be lashed down with the straps provided, and you and the operator have to hold on tight to the hand-grips placed here and there around the wall. Otherwise, you'd clonk your head on the ceiling.  But we got to level four at last, and off I went with my suitcases and the operator's directions. The suitcases weighed about half an ounce each out here, and I felt as though I weighed the same. Every time I raised a foot, I was sure I was about to go sailing into a wall. Local citizens eased by me, their feet occasionally touching the iron pavement as they soared along, and I gave them all dirty looks.  Level four was nothing but walls and windows. The iron floor went among these walls and windows in a straight straight line, bisecting other \"streets\" at perfect right angles, and the iron ceiling sixteen feet up was lined with a double row of fluorescent tubes. I was beginning to feel claustrophobic already.  The Chalmers Hotel--named for an Atronics vice-president--had received my advance registration, which was nice. I was shown to a second-floor room--nothing on level four had more than two stories--and was left to unpack my suitcases as best I may.  I had decided to spend a day or two at Atronics City before taking a scooter out to Ab Karpin's claim. Atronics City had been Karpin's and McCann's home base. All of McCann's premium payments had been mailed from here, and the normal mailing address for both of them was GPO Atronics City.  I wanted to know as much as possible about Ab Karpin before I went out to see him. And Atronics City seemed like the best place to get my information.  But not today. Today, my stomach was very unhappy, and my head was on sympathy strike. Today, I was going to spend my time exclusively in bed, trying not to float up to the ceiling.         *       *       *       *       *  The Mapping & Registry Office, it seemed to me the next day, was the best place to start. This was where prospectors filed their claims, but it was a lot more than that. The waiting room of M&R was the unofficial club of the asteroid prospectors. This is where they met with one another, talked together about the things that prospectors discuss, and made and dissolved their transient partnerships.  In this way, Karpin and McCann were unusual. They had maintained their partnership for fifteen years. That was about sixty times longer than most such arrangements lasted.  Searching the asteroid chunks for rare and valuable metals is basically pretty lonely work, and it's inevitable that the prospectors will every once in a while get hungry for human company and decide to try a team operation. But, at the same time, work like this attracts people who don't get along very well with human company. So the partnerships come and go, and the hatreds flare and are forgotten, and the normal prospecting team lasts an average of three months.  At any rate, it was to the Mapping & Registry Office that I went first. And, since that office was up on the first level, I went by elevator.  Riding _up_ in that elevator was a heck of a lot more fun than riding down. The elevator whipped up like mad, the floor pressed against the soles of my feet, and it felt almost like good old Earth for a second or two there. But then the elevator stopped, and I held on tight to the hand-grips to keep from shooting through the top of the blasted thing.  The operator--a phlegmatic sort--gave me directions to the M&R, and off I went, still trying to figure out how to sail along as gracefully as the locals.  The Mapping & Registry Office occupied a good-sized shack over near the dome wall, next to the entry lock. I pushed open the door and went on in.  The waiting room was cozy and surprisingly large, large enough to comfortably hold the six maroon leather sofas scattered here and there on the pale green carpet, flanked by bronze ashtray stands. There were only six prospectors here at the moment, chatting together in two groups of three, and they all looked alike. Grizzled, ageless, watery-eyed, their clothing clean but baggy. I passed them and went on to the desk at the far end, behind which sat a young man in official gray, slowly turning the crank of a microfilm reader.  He looked up at my approach. I flashed my company identification and asked to speak to the manager. He went away, came back, and ushered me into an office which managed to be Spartan and sumptuous at the same time. The walls had been plastic-painted in textured brown, the iron floor had been lushly carpeted in gray, and the desk had been covered with a simulated wood coating.  The manager--a man named Teaking--went well with the office. His face and hands were spare and lean, but his uniform was immaculate, covered with every curlicue the regulations allowed. He welcomed me politely, but curiously, and I said, \"I wonder if you know a prospector named Ab Karpin?\"  \"Karpin? Of course. He and old Jafe McCann--pity about McCann. I hear he got killed.\"  \"Yes, he did.\"  \"And that's what you're here for, eh?\" He nodded sagely. \"I didn't know the Belt boys could get insurance,\" he said.  \"It isn't exactly that,\" I said. \"This concerns a retirement plan, and--well, the details don't matter.\" Which, I hoped, would end his curiosity in that line. \"I was hoping you could give me some background on Karpin. And on McCann, too, for that matter.\"  He grinned a bit. \"You saw the men sitting outside?\"  I nodded.  \"Then you've seen Karpin and McCann. Exactly the same. It doesn't matter if a man's thirty or sixty or what. It doesn't matter what he was like before he came out here. If he's been here a few years, he looks exactly like the bunch you saw outside there.\"  \"That's appearance,\" I said. \"What I was looking for was personality.\"  \"Same thing,\" he said. \"All of them. Close-mouthed, anti-social, fiercely independent, incurably romantic, always convinced that the big strike is just a piece of rock away. McCann, now, he was a bit more realistic than most. He'd be the one I'd expect to take out a retirement policy. A real pence-pincher, that one, though I shouldn't say it as he's dead. But that's the way he was. Brighter than most Belt boys when it came to money matters. I've seen him haggle over a new piece of equipment for their scooter, or some repair work, or some such thing, and he was a wonder to watch.\"  \"And Karpin?\" I asked him.  \"A prospector,\" he said, as though that answered my question. \"Same as everybody else. Not as sharp as McCann when it came to money. That's why all the money stuff in the partnership was handled by McCann. But Karpin was one of the sharpest boys in the business when it came to mineralogy. He knew rocks you and I never heard of, and most times he knew them by sight. Almost all of the Belt boys are college grads--you've got to know what you're looking for out here and what it looks like when you've found it--but Karpin has practically all of them beat. He's _sharp_.\"         *       *       *  \"Sounds like a good team,\" I said.  \"I guess that's why they stayed together so long,\" he said. \"They complemented each other.\" He leaned forward, the inevitable prelude to a confidential remark. \"I'll tell you something off the record, Mister,\" he said. \"Those two were smarter than they knew. Their partnership was never legalized, it was never anything more than a piece of paper. And there's a bunch of fellas around here mighty unhappy about that today. Jafe McCann is the one who handled all the money matters, like I said. He's got IOU's all over town.\"  \"And they can't collect from Karpin?\"  He nodded. \"Jafe McCann died just a bit too soon. He was sharp and cheap, but he was honest. If he'd lived, he would have repaid all his debts, I'm sure of it. And if this strike they made is as good as I hear, he would"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27089"],["title","The Risk Profession (#2)"],["body","been able to repay them with no trouble at all.\"  I nodded, somewhat impatiently. I had the feeling by now that I was talking to a man who was one of those who had a Jafe McCann IOU in his pocket. \"How long has it been since you've seen Karpin?\" I asked him, wondering what Karpin's attitude and expression was now that his partner was dead.  \"Oh, Lord, not for a couple of months,\" he said. \"Not since they went out together the last time and made that strike.\"  \"Didn't Karpin come in to make his claim?\"  \"Not here. Over to Chemisant City. That was the nearest M&R to the strike.\"  \"Oh.\" That was a pity. I would have liked to have known if there had been a change of any kind in Karpin since his partner's death. \"I'll tell you what the situation is,\" I said, with a false air of truthfulness. \"We have some misgivings about McCann's death. Not suspicions, exactly, just misgivings. The timing is what bothers us.\"  \"You mean, because it happened just after the strike?\"  \"That's it,\" I answered frankly.  He shook his head. \"I wouldn't get too excited about that, if I were you,\" he said. \"It wouldn't be the first time it's happened. A man makes the big strike after all, and he gets so excited he forgets himself for a minute and gets careless. And you only have to be careless once out here.\"  \"That may be it,\" I said. I got to my feet, knowing I'd picked up all there was from this man. \"Thanks a lot for your cooperation,\" I said.  \"Any time,\" he said. He stood and shook hands with me.  I went back out through the chatting prospectors and crossed the echoing cavern that was level one, aiming to rent myself a scooter.         *       *       *       *       *  I don't like rockets. They're noisy as the dickens, they steer hard and drive erratically, and you can never carry what _I_ would consider a safe emergency excess of fuel. Nothing like the big steady-g interplanetary liners. On those I feel almost human.  The appearance of the scooter I was shown at the rental agency didn't do much to raise my opinion of this mode of transportation. The thing was a good ten years old, the paint scraped and scratched all over its egg-shaped, originally green-colored body, and the windshield--a silly term, really, for the front window of a craft that spends most of its time out where there isn't any wind--was scratched and pockmarked to the point of translucency by years of exposure to the asteroidal dust.  The rental agent was a sharp-nosed thin-faced type who displayed this refugee from a melting vat without a blush, and still didn't blush when he told me the charges. Twenty credits a day, plus fuel.  I paid without a murmur--it was the company's money, not mine--and paid an additional ten credits for the rental of a suit to go with it. I worked my way awkwardly into the suit, and clambered into the driver's seat of the relic. I attached the suit to the ship in all the necessary places, and the agent closed and spun the door.  Most of the black paint had worn off the handles of the controls, and insulation peeked through rips in the plastic siding here and there. I wondered if the thing had any slow leaks and supposed fatalistically that it had. The agent waved at me, stony-faced, the conveyor belt trundled me outside the dome, and I kicked the weary rocket into life.  The scooter had a tendency to roll to the right. If I hadn't kept fighting it back, it would have soon worked up a dandy little spin. I was spending so much time juggling with the controls that I practically missed a couple of my beacon rocks, and that would have been just too bad. If I'd gotten off the course I had carefully outlined for myself, I'd never have found my bearings again, and I would have just floated around amid the scenery until some passerby took pity and towed me back home.  But I managed to avoid getting lost, which surprised me, and after four nerve-wracking hours I finally spotted the yellow-painted X of a registered claim on a half-mile-thick chunk of rock dead ahead. As I got closer, I spied a scooter parked near the X, and beside it an inflated portable dome. The scooter was somewhat larger than mine, but no newer and probably even less safe. The dome was varicolored, from repeated patching.  This would be the claim, and this is where I would find Karpin, sitting on his property while waiting for the sale to go through. Prospectors like Karpin are free-lance men, working for no particular company. They register their claims in their own names, and then sell the rights to whichever company shows up first with the most attractive offer. There's a lot of paperwork to such a sale, and it's all handled by the company. While waiting, the smart prospector sits on his claim and makes sure nobody chips off a part of it for himself, a stunt that still happens now and again. It doesn't take too much concentrated explosive to make two rocks out of one rock, and a man's claim is only the rock with his X on it.  I set the scooter down next to the other one, and flicked the toggle for the air pumps, then put on the fishbowl and went about unattaching the suit from the ship. When the red light flashed on and off, I spun the door, opened it, and stepped out onto the rock, moving very cautiously. It isn't that I don't believe the magnets in the boot soles will work, it's just that I know for a fact that they won't work if I happen to raise both feet at the same time.  [Illustration]  I clumped across the crude X to Karpin's dome. The dome had no viewports at all, so I wasn't sure Karpin was aware of my presence. I rapped my metal glove on the metal outer door of the lock, and then I was sure.  But it took him long enough to open up. I had just about decided he'd joined his partner in the long sleep when the door cracked open an inch. I pushed it open and stepped into the lock, ducking my head. The door was only five feet high, and just as wide as the lock itself, three feet. The other dimensions of the lock were: height, six feet six; width, one foot. Not exactly room to dance in.         *       *       *  When the red light high on the left-hand wall clicked off, I rapped on the inner door. It promptly opened, I stepped through and removed the fishbowl.  Karpin stood in the middle of the room, a small revolver in his hand. \"Shut the door,\" he said.  I obeyed, moving slowly. I didn't want that gun to go off by mistake.  \"Who are you?\" Karpin demanded. The M&R man had been right. Ab Karpin was a dead ringer for all those other prospectors I'd seen back at Atronics City. Short and skinny and grizzled and ageless. He could have been forty, and he could have been ninety, but he was probably somewhere the other side of fifty. His hair was black and limp and thinning, ruffled in little wisps across his wrinkled pate. His forehead and cheeks were lined like a plowed field, and were much the same color. His eyes were wide apart and small, so deep-set beneath shaggy brows that they seemed black. His mouth was thin, almost lipless. The hand holding the revolver was nothing but bones and blue veins covered with taut skin.  He was wearing a dirty undershirt and an old pair of trousers that had been cut off raggedly just above his knobby knees. Faded slippers were on his feet. He had good reason for dressing that way, the temperature inside the dome must have been nearly ninety degrees. The dome wasn't reflecting away the sun's heat as well as it had when it was young.  I looked at Karpin, and despite the revolver and the tense expression on his face, he was the least dangerous-looking man I'd ever run across. All at once, the idea that this anti-social old geezer had the drive or the imagination to murder his partner seemed ridiculous.  Apparently, I spent too much time looking him over, because he said again, \"Who are you?\" And this time he motioned impatiently with the revolver.  \"Stanton,\" I told him. \"Ged Stanton, Tangiers Mutual Insurance. I have identification, but it's in my pants pocket, down inside this suit.\"  \"Get it,\" he said. \"And move slow.\"  \"Right you are.\"  I moved slow, as per directions, and peeled out of the suit, then reached into my trouser pocket and took out my ID clip. I flipped it open and showed him the card bearing my signature and picture and right thumb-print and the name of the company I represented, and he nodded, satisfied, and tossed the revolver over onto his bed. \"I got to be careful,\" he said. \"I got a big claim here.\"  \"I know that,\" I told him. \"Congratulations for it.\"  \"Thanks,\" he said, but he still looked peevish. \"You're here about Jafe's insurance, right?\"  \"That I am.\"  \"Don't want to pay up, I suppose. That doesn't surprise me.\"  Blunt old men irritate me. \"Well,\" I said, \"we do have to investigate.\"  \"Sure,\" he said. \"You want some coffee?\"  \"Thank you.\"  \"You can sit in that chair there. That was Jafe's.\"  I settled gingerly in the cloth-and-plastic foldaway chair he'd pointed at, and he went over to the kitchen area of the dome to start coffee. I took the opportunity to look the dome over. It was the first portable dome I'd ever been inside.         *       *       *  It was all one room, roughly circular, with a diameter of about fifteen feet. The sides went straight up for the first seven feet, then curved gradually inward to form the roof. At the center of the dome, the ceiling was about twelve feet high.  The floor of the room was simply the asteroidal rock surface, not completely level and smooth. There were two chairs and a table to the right of the entry lock, two foldaway cots around the wall beyond them, the kitchen area next and a cluttered storage area around on the other side. There was a heater standing alone in the center of the room, but it certainly wasn't needed now. Sweat was already trickling down the back of my neck and down my forehead into my eyebrows. I peeled off my shirt and used it to wipe sweat from my face. \"Warm in here,\" I said.  \"You get used to it,\" he muttered, which I found hard to"]]]
