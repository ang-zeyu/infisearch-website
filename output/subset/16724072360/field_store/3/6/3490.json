The calm before the storm sat brooding over everything.  The kilted platoons having gone on their way, we resumed our journey, dipping into the valley behind Sailly-au-Bois, and climbing the farther side, as I passed the officers' mess hut belonging to an anti-aircraft battery, which had taken up a position at the foot of the valley, and whence came a pleasant sound of clinking glass, a wild desire for permanent comfort affected me.  Bounding the outskirts of Sailly-au-Bois, we arrived in the midst of the battery positions nesting by the score in the level plain behind Hébuterne. The batteries soon let us know of their presence. Red flashes broke out in the gathering darkness, followed by quick reports.  To the right one could discern the dim outlines of platoons moving up steadily and at equal distances like ourselves. One could just catch the distant noise of spade clinking on rifle. When I turned my gaze to the front of these troops, I saw yellow-red flashes licking upon the horizon, where our shells were finding their mark. Straight in front, whither we were bound, the girdle of trees round Hébuterne shut out these flashes from view, but by the noise that came from beyond those trees one knew that the German trenches were receiving exactly the same intensity of fire there. Every now and then this belt of trees was being thrown into sharp relief by German star-shells, which rocketed into the sky one after the other like a display of fireworks, while at times a burst of hostile shrapnel would throw a weird, red light on the twinkling poplars which surrounded the cemetery.  As we marched on towards the village (I do not mind saying it) I experienced that unpleasant sensation of wondering whether I should be lying out this time to-morrow--stiff and cold in that land beyond the trees, where the red shrapnel burst and the star-shells flickered. I remember hoping that, if the fates so decreed, I should not leave too great a gap in my family, and, best hope of all, that I should instead be speeding home in an ambulance on the road that stretched along to our left. I do not think that I am far wrong when I say that those thoughts were occurring to every man in the silent platoon behind me. Not that we were downhearted. If you had asked the question, you would have been greeted by a cheery \"No!\" We were all full of determination to do our best next day, but one cannot help enduring rather an unusual \"party feeling\" before going into an attack.  Suddenly a German shell came screaming towards us. It hurtled overhead and fell behind us with muffled detonation in Sailly-au-Bois. Several more screamed over us as we went along, and it was peculiar to hear the shells of both sides echoing backwards and forwards in the sky at the same time.  We were about four hundred yards from the outskirts of Hébuterne, when I was made aware of the fact that the platoon in front of me had stopped. I immediately stopped my platoon. I sat the men down along a bank, and we waited--a wait which was whiled away by various incidents. I could hear a dog barking, and just see two gunner officers who were walking unconcernedly about the battery positions and whistling for it. The next thing that happened was a red flash in the air about two hundred yards away, and a pinging noise as bits of shrapnel shot into the ground round about. One of my men, S---- (the poor chap was killed next day), called to me: \"Look at that fire in Sailly, sir!\" I turned round and saw a great yellow flare illuminating the sky in the direction of Sailly, the fiery end of some barn or farm-building, where a high explosive had found its billet.  We remained in this spot for nearly a quarter of an hour, after which R----d's platoon began to move on, and I followed at a good distance with mine. We made our way to the clump of trees over which the shrapnel had burst a few minutes before. Suddenly we found ourselves floundering in a sunken road flooded with water knee-deep. This was not exactly pleasant, especially when my guide informed me that he was not quite certain as to our whereabouts. Luckily, we soon gained dry ground again, turned off into a bit of trench which brought us into the village, and made for the dump by the church, where we were to pick up our materials. When we reached the church--or, rather, its ruins--the road was so filled with parties and platoons, and it was becoming so dark, that it took us some time before we found the dump. Fortunately, the first person whom I spotted was the Regimental Sergeant-Major, and I handed over to him the carrying-party which I had to detail, also despatching the rum and soup parties--the latter to the company cooker.  Leaving the platoon in charge of Sergeant S----l, I went with my guide in search of the dump. In the general _mêlée_ I bumped into W----k. We found the rabbit wire, barbed wire, and other material in a shell-broken outhouse, and, grabbing hold of it, handed the stuff out to the platoon.  As we filed through the village the reflections of star-shells threw weird lights on half-ruined houses; an occasional shell screamed overhead, to burst with a dull, echoing sound within the shattered walls of former cottages; and one could hear the rat-tat-tat of machine-guns. These had a nasty habit of spraying the village with indirect fire, and it was, as always, a relief to enter the recesses of Wood Street without having any one hit. This communication trench dipped into the earth at right angles to the \"Boulevard\" Street. We clattered along the brick-floored trench, whose walls were overhung with the dewy grass and flowers of the orchard--that wonderful orchard whose aroma had survived the horror and desolation of a two years' warfare, and seemed now only to be intensified to a softer fragrance by the night air.  Arriving at the belt of trees and hedge which marked the confines of the orchard, we turned to the right into Cross Street, which cut along behind the belt of trees into Woman Street.  Turning to the left up Woman Street, and leaving the belt of trees behind, we wound into the slightly undulating ground between Hébuterne and Gommecourt Wood. \"Crumps\" were bursting round about the communication trench, but at a distance, judging by their report, of at least fifty yards. As we were passing Brigade Headquarters' Dug-out, the Brigade-Major appeared and asked me the number of my platoon. \"Number 5,\" I replied; and he answered \"Good,\" with a touch of relief in his voice--for we had been held up for some time on the way, and my platoon was the first or second platoon of the company to get into the line.  It was shortly after this that \"crumps\" began to burst dangerously near. There was suddenly a blinding flash and terrific report just to our left. We kept on, with heads aching intolerably. Winding round a curve, we came upon the effects of the shells. The sides of the trench had been blown in, while in the middle of the _débris_ lay a dead or unconscious man, and farther on a man groaning faintly upon a stretcher. We scrambled over them, passed a few more wounded and stretcher-bearers, and arrived at the Reserve Line.  Captain W----t was standing at the juncture of Woman Street and the Reserve Line, cool and calm as usual. I asked him if New Woman Street was blocked, but there was no need for a reply. A confused noise of groans and stertorous breathing, and of some one sobbing, came to my ears, and above it all, M---- W----'s voice saying to one of his men: \"It's all right, old chap. It's all over now.\" He told me afterwards that a shell had landed practically in the trench, killing two men in front of him and one behind, and wounding several others, but not touching himself.  It was quite obvious to me that it was impossible to proceed to the support trench via New Woman Street, and at any rate my Company Commander had given me orders to go over the top from the reserve to the support line, so, shells or no shells, and leaving Sergeant S----l to bring up the rear of the platoon, I scaled a ladder leaning on the side of the trench and walked over the open for about two hundred yards. My guide and I jumped into New Woman Street just before it touched the support line, and we were soon joined by several other men of the platoon. We had already suffered three casualties, and going over the top in the darkness, the men had lost touch. The ration party also had not arrived yet. I despatched the guide to bring up the remainder, and proceeded to my destination with about six men. About fifteen yards farther up the trench I found a series of shell-holes threading their way off to the left. By the light of some German star-shells I discerned an officer groping about these holes, and I stumbled over mounds and hollows towards him.  \"Is this the support line?\" I asked, rather foolishly.  \"Yes,\" he replied, \"but there isn't much room in it.\" I saw that he was an officer of the Royal Engineers.  \"I'm putting my smoke-bombers down here,\" he continued, \"but you'll find more room over towards the sunken road.\"  He showed me along the trench--or the remains of it--and went off to carry out his own plans. I stumbled along till I could just distinguish the outlines of the sunken road. The trench in this direction was blown in level with the ground. I returned to W----k, whose headquarters were at the juncture of New Woman Street and the support line, telling him that the trench by the sunken road was untenable, and that I proposed placing my platoon in a smaller length of trench, and spreading them out fanwise when we started to advance. To this he agreed, and putting his hand on my shoulder in his characteristic fashion, informed me in a whisper that the attack was to start at 7.30 A.M. As far as I can remember it was about one o'clock by now, and more of my men had come up. I ensconced them by sections.

President the result of the trial--with my opinion of their     Capacity to carry our passenger trains at the speed required     which was decidedly in favor of the ability of the Engines. He     accordingly agreed that the Engines should at once be forwarded     to the Road in compliance with the Resolution of your Board. I     immediately ordered the Engines shipped at the most favorable     rates. They came to our Road safely in the Condition in which     they were shipped. One of the Engines has been placed on the     Road and I believe performed in such a manner as to convince all     who are able to judge of this ability to perform--although the     maximum duty of the Engines was not performed on account of some     original defects which are now being remedied as I before     stated.      Within ten days the Engine will be able to run regularly with a     train on the Road where in shall be enabled to judge correctly     of their merits.      An accident occurred during the trial of the Small Engine at     Norwich which caused a damage of about $300 in which condition     the Engine came here and is now being repaired--the cost of     which will be presented to your Board hereafter. As to the     fault or blame of parties connected with the accident as also     the question of responsibility for Repairs are questions for     your disposal. I therefore leave the matter until further called     upon.      The Expenses necessarily incurred by the trial of the Engines     and also the Expenses of transporting the same are not included     in the Statement herewith presented, the whole amount of which     will not probably exceed $400.00.  These two locomotives became the Cumberland Valley Railroad's _Pioneer_ (number 13) and _Jenny Lind_ (number 14). While Smith notes that one of the engines was damaged during the inspection trials, Joseph Winters, an employee of the Cumberland Valley who claimed he was accompanying the engine enroute to Chambersburg at the time of their delivery, later recalled that both engines were damaged in transit.[4] According to Winters a train ran into the rear of the _Jenny Lind_, damaging both it and the _Pioneer_, the accident occurring near Middletown, Pennsylvania. The _Jenny Lind_ was repaired at Harrisburg but the _Pioneer_, less seriously damaged, was taken for repairs to the main shops of the Cumberland Valley road at Chambersburg.  [Illustration: Figure 3.--\"PIONEER,\" ABOUT 1901, showing the sandbox and large headlamp. Note the lamp on the cab roof, now used as the headlight. (Smithsonian photo 49272.)]  While there seems little question that these locomotives were not built as a direct order for the Cumberland Valley Railroad, an article[5] appearing in the _Railroad Advocate_ in 1855 credits their design to Smith. The article speaks of a 2--2--4 built for the Macon and Western Railroad and says in part:      This engine is designed and built very generally upon the ideas,     embodied in some small tank engines designed by A. F. Smith,     Esq., for the Cumberland Valley road. Mr. Smith is a strong     advocate of light engines, and his novel style and proportions     of engines, as built for him a few years since, by Seth     Wilmarth, at Boston, are known to some of our readers. Without     knowing all the circumstances under which these engines are     worked on the Cumberland Valley road, we should not venture to     repeat all that we have heard of their performances, it is     enough to say that they are said to do more, in proportion to     their weight, than any other engines now in use.  The author believes that the _Railroad Advocate's_ claim of Smith's design of the _Pioneer_ has been confused with his design of the _Utility_ (figs. 6, 7). Smith designed this compensating-lever engine to haul trains over the C.V.R.R. bridge at Harrisburg. It was built by Wilmarth in 1854.  [Illustration: Figure 4.--MAP OF THE CUMBERLAND VALLEY Railroad as it appeared in 1919.]  According to statements of Smith and the Board of Managers quoted on page 244, the _Pioneer_ and the _Jenny Lind_ were not new when purchased from their maker, Seth Wilmarth. Although of recent manufacture, previous to June 1851, they were apparently doing service on a road in Norwich, Connecticut. It should be mentioned that both Smith and Tyler were formerly associated with the Norwich and Worcester Railroad and they probably learned of these two engines through this former association. It is possible that the engines were purchased from Wilmarth by the Cumberland Valley road, which had bought several other locomotives from Wilmarth in previous years. It was the practice of at least one other New England engine builder, the Taunton Locomotive Works, to manufacture engines on the speculation that a buyer would be found; if no immediate buyers appeared the engine was leased to a local road until a sale was made.[6]  [Illustration: Figure 5.--AN EARLY BROADSIDE of the Cumberland Valley Railroad.]  Regarding the _Jenny Lind_ and _Pioneer_, Smith reported[7] to the Board of Managers at their meeting of March 17, 1852:      The small tank engines which were purchased last year ... and     which I spoke in a former report as undergoing at that time some     necessary improvements have since that time been fairly tested     as to their capacity to run our passenger trains and proved to     be equal to the duty.      The improvements proposed to be made have been completed only on     one engine [_Jenny Lind_] which is now running regularly with     passenger trains--the cost of repairs and improvements on this     engine (this being the one accidentally broken on the trial)     amounted to $476.51. The other engine is now in the shop, not     yet ready for service but will be at an early day.  [Illustration: Figure 6.--THE \"UTILITY\" AS REBUILT TO AN 8-WHEEL ENGINE, about 1863 or 1864. It was purchased by the Carlisle Manufacturing Co. in 1882 and was last used in 1896. (Smithsonian photo 36716F.)]  [Illustration: Figure 7.--THE \"UTILITY,\" DESIGNED BY SMITH A. F. and constructed by Seth Wilmarth in 1854, was built to haul trains across the bridge at Harrisburg, Pa.]  [Illustration: Figure 8.--THE EARLIEST KNOWN ILLUSTRATION of the _Pioneer_, drawn by A. S. Hull, master mechanic of the Cumberland Valley Railroad in 1876. It depicts the engine as it appeared in 1871. (_Courtesy of Paul Westhaeffer._)]  The _Pioneer_ and _Jenny Lind_ achieved such success in action that the president of the road, Frederick Watts, commented on their performance in the annual report of the Cumberland Valley Railroad for 1851. Watts stated that since their passenger trains were rarely more than a baggage car and two coaches, the light locomotives \"... have been found to be admirably adapted to our business.\" The Cumberland Valley Railroad, therefore, added two more locomotives of similar design in the next few years. These engines were the _Boston_ and the _Enterprise_, also built by Wilmarth in 1854-1855.  Watts reported the _Pioneer_ and _Jenny Lind_ cost $7,642. A standard 8-wheel engine cost about $6,500 to $8,000 each during this period. In recent years, the Pennsylvania Railroad has stated the _Pioneer_ cost $6,200 in gold, but is unable to give the source for this information. The author can discount this statement for it does not seem reasonable that a light, cheap engine of the pattern of the _Pioneer_ could cost as much as a machine nearly twice its size.  [Illustration: Figure 9.--ANNUAL PASS of the Cumberland Valley Railroad issued in 1863.]  [Illustration: Figure 10.--TIMETABLE OF THE Cumberland Valley Railroad for 1878.]   Service History of the _Pioneer_  After being put in service, the _Pioneer_ continued to perform well and was credited as able to move a 4-car passenger train along smartly at 40 mph.[8] This tranquility was shattered in October 1862 by a raiding party led by Confederate General J. E. B. Stuart which burned the Chambersburg shops of the Cumberland Valley Railroad. The _Pioneer_, _Jenny Lind_, and _Utility_ were partially destroyed. The Cumberland Valley Railroad in its report for 1862 stated:      The Wood-shop, Machine-shop, Black-smith-shop, Engine-house,     Wood-sheds, and Passenger Depot were totally consumed, and with     the Engine-house three second-class Engines were much injured by     the fire, but not so destroyed but that they may be restored to     usefulness.  However, no record can be found of the extent or exact nature of the damage. The shops and a number of cars were burned so it is reasonable to assume that the cab and other wooden parts of the locomotive were damaged. One unverified report in the files of the Pennsylvania Railroad states that part of the roof and brick wall fell on the _Pioneer_ during the fire causing considerable damage. In June 1864 the Chambersburg shops were again burned by the Confederates, but on this occasion the railroad managed to remove all its locomotives before the raid. During the Civil War, the Cumberland Valley Railroad was obliged to operate longer passenger trains to satisfy the enlarged traffic. The _Pioneer_ and "]]]
