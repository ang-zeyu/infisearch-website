There may be some passenger who could not get a place in the coupé, on account of my having taken them all, and who, consequently, took one on the banquette, and would now be glad to exchange, and pay the difference.\"  [Footnote B: Bureau is the French word meaning office; and English people, when travelling in France, fall into the habit of using the word in that sense.]  \"How much would the difference be?\" asked Rollo.  \"I don't know,\" said Mr. Holiday; \"five or six francs, probably. You would save that sum by riding on the banquette, and you could have it to buy something with in Geneva.\"  \"Well, sir,\" said Rollo, joyfully, \"I should like that plan very much.\"  \"But do you think,\" said Mrs. Holiday, \"that you know French enough to explain it at the bureau, and make the change?\"  \"O, yes, mother,\" said Rollo; \"I have no doubt I can.\"  So Rollo said he would finish his dinner as soon as he could, and go off at once to the bureau.  \"There is one other condition,\" said his father. \"If I let you ride on the banquette, and let you have all the money that you save for your own, you must write a full account of your night's journey, and send it to your cousin Lucy.\"  \"Well, sir,\" said Rollo, \"I will.\"  Rollo left the dinner table while his father and mother were taking their coffee. The table was one of a number of separate tables arranged along by the windows on the front side of a quaint and queer-looking dining room--or _salle à manger_, as they call it--in one of the Lyons inns. Indeed, the whole inn was very quaint and queer, with its old stone staircases, and long corridors leading to the various apartments, and its antique ceiling,--reminding one, as Mr. Holiday said, of the inns we read of in Don Quixote and other ancient romances.  Rollo left his father and mother at this table, taking their coffee, and sallied forth to find his way to the bureau of the diligence.  \"If you meet with any difficulty,\" said Mr. Holiday, as Rollo went away, \"engage the first cab you see, and the cabman will take you directly there for a franc or so.\"  \"Yes, sir,\" said Rollo, \"I will.\"  \"And if you don't find any cab readily,\" continued his father, \"engage a commissioner to go with you and show you the way.\"  \"Yes, sir,\" said Rollo.  A commissioner is a sort of porter who stands at the corners of the streets in the French towns, ready to do any thing for any body that calls upon him.  Rollo resolved not to employ either a cabman or a commissioner, if it could possibly be avoided. He took the address of the bureau from his father, and sallied forth.  He first went round the corner to a bookstore where he recollected to have seen a map of Lyons hanging in the window. He looked at this map, and found the street on it where he wished to go. He then studied out the course which he was to take. Lyons stands at, or rather near, the confluence of the two rivers Rhone and Saone. In coming to Lyons from Paris, the party had come down the valley of the Saone; but now they were to leave this valley, and follow up that of the Rhone to Geneva, which is situated, as has already been said, on the Rhone, at the point where that river issues from the Lake of Geneva.  The hotel where Rollo's father had taken lodgings was near the Saone; and Rollo found that the bureau was on the other side of the town, where it fronts on the Rhone.  So Rollo followed the course which he had marked out for himself on the map. In a short time he saw before him signs of bridges and a river.  \"Ah,\" says he to himself; \"I am right; I am coming to the Rhone.\"  He went on, drawing nearer and nearer. At length he came out upon the broad and beautiful quay, with large and elegant stone buildings on one side of it, and a broad but low parapet wall on the other, separating the quay from the water. There was a sidewalk along this wall, with many people walking on it; and here and there men were to be seen leaning upon the wall, and looking over at the boats on the river. The river was broad, and it flowed very rapidly, as almost all water does which has just come from Switzerland and the Alps. On looking up and down, Rollo saw a great number of bridges crossing this stream, with teams and diligences, and in one place a long troop of soldiers passing over. On the other side, the bank was lined with massive blocks of stone buildings. In a word, the whole scene presented a very bright and animated spectacle to view.  Nearly opposite to the place where Rollo came out upon the river, he saw, over the parapet wall that extended along on the outer side of the quay, a very large, square net suspended in the air. It was hung by means of ropes at the four corners, which met in a point above, whence a larger rope went up to a pulley which was attached to the end of a spar that projected from the stern of a boat. The net was slowly descending into the water when Rollo first caught a view of it; so he ran across, and looked over the parapet to see.  [Illustration: THE GREAT NET.]  The net descended slowly into the water. It was let down by men in the boat paying out the line that held it.  \"Ah,\" said Rollo to himself; \"that's a curious way to rig a net. I should like to stay and see them pull it up again, so as to see how many fish they take; but business first and pleasure afterwards is the rule.\"  So he left the parapet, and walked along the quay towards the place where the bureau was situated.  \"I'll come back here,\" said he to himself, \"when I have got my place on the banquette, and see them fish a little while, if I find there is time.\"  In a few minutes Rollo came to the place he was seeking. It was in a little square, called Concert Place, opening towards the river. Rollo knew the bureau by seeing the diligence standing before the door. It had been brought up there to be ready for the baggage, though the horses were not yet harnessed to it.  Rollo went into the office. He found himself in a small room, with trunks and baggage arranged along on one side of it, and a little enclosure of railings, with a desk behind it, on the other. There was a young man sitting at this desk, writing.  \"This must be a clerk, I suppose,\" said Rollo to himself.  Opposite to where the clerk was sitting there was a little opening in the railings, for people to pay their money and take their tickets; for people take tickets for places in the diligence, in Europe, just as they do for the railroad. Rollo advanced to this opening, and, looking through it, he stated his case to the clerk. He said that he had a place in the coupé that his father had taken for him, but that he would rather ride on the banquette, if there was room there, and if any body would take his place in the coupé.  The clerk said that there had been a great many persons after a place in the coupé since it had been taken, and that one lady had taken a place on the banquette, because all the other places in the coach had been engaged.  \"I think,\" said the clerk, \"that she will be very glad to exchange with you, and pay you the difference. She lives not far from here, and if you will wait a few minutes, I will send and see.\"  So the clerk called a commissioner who stood at the door, and after giving him his directions, sent him away. In a few minutes the commissioner returned, saying that the lady was very glad indeed to exchange. He brought in his hand a five franc piece and three francs, which was the difference in the price of the two places. The clerk gave this money to Rollo, and altered the entry on his books so as to put the lady in the coupé and Rollo on the banquette. Thus the affair was all arranged.  Rollo found that it was now six o'clock. The diligence was not to set out until half past seven; but by the rules of the service the passengers were all to be on the spot, with their baggage, half an hour before the time; so that Rollo knew that his father and mother would be there at seven.  \"That gives me just an hour,\" said he to himself; \"so I shall have plenty of time to go and see how they manage fishing with that big net.\"  He accordingly went to see the fishing, but was very careful to return some minutes before the appointed time.  Rollo had a very pleasant ride that night to Geneva. He wrote a long and full account of it afterwards, and sent it to his cousin Lucy. This letter I shall give in the next chapter.  The reason why Rollo wrote so long an account of his journey was this: that his father required him, when travelling, to spend one hour and a half every day in study of some kind; and writing letters, or any other intellectual occupation that was calculated to advance his education, was considered as study. In consequence of this arrangement, Rollo was never in a hurry to come to the end of his letters, for he liked the work of writing them better than writing French exercises, or working on arithmetic, or engaging in any of the other avocations which devolved upon him when he had no letters on hand.     CHAPTER III.  THE RIDE TO GENEVA.   \"DEAR LUCY:  \"I am going to give you an account of my night ride from Lyons to Geneva.  \"I got to the diligence office before father came, because I was going to ride up in the bellows-top. I call it the bellows-top so that you may understand it better. It is a place up in the second story of the diligence, where there are seats for four persons, and a great bellows-top over their heads. _I_ think it is the best place, though people have to pay more for the coupé, which is right under it. I got eight francs, which is more than a dollar and a half, for exchanging my seat in the coupé for one on the banquette. I exchanged with a lady. I suppose she did not like to climb up the ladder.

Susy's mocking-bird hung in a cage by one of the windows, and \"brother Zip\" was lounging in an arm-chair, catching flies.  After everybody was comfortably seated, and had said \"Good morning,\" then a \"silent blessing,\" according to the custom of the Friends, was asked upon the food. All sat with folded hands, and eyes reverently fixed upon their plates. Dotty knew very well they were asking to be made thankful for the excellent breakfast before them. She repeated to herself several times the sentence she had been taught; for, in spite of her intention to be naughty, she dared not omit it. When Mr. Parlin began to pass the butter, she was still looking at her plate, and startled the whole family by saying aloud, \"Amen!\"  Grandma looked at the little girl with surprise and disapproval. Dotty blushed painfully. She had not meant to be irreverent. Next moment she thought,--  \"Now they all s'pose I did that _to purpose_! I don't care if they do! I'll act worse'n that! I wonder what my father'd say if I should jump right up and down, and scream?\"  It certainly was not safe to try the experiment. Dotty contented herself by scowling at her dry toast.  But after her father had gone away to his business, and her mother had begun to make preserves in the kitchen, she went down cellar, into the wash-room, and began to tease Norah. Norah, who was fond of the child, and in general very good-natured, was not in a mood this morning to be trifled with.  \"Indeed, Miss Flippet,\" said she, indignantly, \"I shall put up with no more of your pranks! It's not your sister Prudy who would go to hidin' my soap, and me in a hurry!\"  \"She likes Prudy best. I always knew she did, and everybody else,\" thought Dotty, wrathfully,--\"everybody else but me!\"  And the temper which had been smouldering all the morning blazed up hotly.  \"Call me Miss Flippet again, if you dare!\" cried she, with battle-fires in her eyes. \"What you s'pose the mayor'll do to you, miss? He'll put you in the lockup--yes, he will!\"  At this foolish speech Norah's mouth assumed a mocking smile, which added live coals to Dotty's wrath.  \"You mizzable Cath'lic girl! You--you--you--\"  Words were choked in the smoke and flame of her anger. I mean to say that dreadful \"lion,\" which had not come out in his full strength for years, suddenly sprang up, and shook his mane. Dotty could not speak. She lost her reason. Her head was on fire. Her hands and feet began to fly out. She danced up and down. Her terrific screams brought her mother down in haste, to see what was the matter. Dotty's face was crimson; her eyes shining fiercely; her voice hoarse from screaming.  \"Indeed, ma'am,\" said Norah, really alarmed, \"I've no means of knowing what's put her in such a way, ma'am.\"  \"She called me everything!\" cried Dotty, getting her voice again. \"I was Miss Flippet! I was all the wicked girls in this town!\"  Norah looked a little mortified. She knew her mistress was very \"particular,\" and did not allow any one in her house to \"call names.\" But just now Mrs. Parlin had no time to give Norah a mild reproof, her whole attention being devoted to the half-insane Dotty, whose most unusual exhibition of temper filled her with dreadful apprehensions.  \"Alas,\" thought the good mother, \"is this child going to live over again those dreadful days of her babyhood? The Lord give me wisdom to know what to do with her!\"  Mrs. Parlin soon succeeded in quieting the turbulent Dotty; and deep silence fell upon the wash-room.  \"My dear little girl,\" said she, very gently, \"I desire you to spend the rest of the morning alone. You need not talk or play with either of your sisters. You may _think_. When the bell rings you may come to dinner; and after dinner I would like to see you in the nursery.\"  In half an hour Dotty had such a look of heartache in her face that Prudy longed to comfort her, only speech was forbidden. The little creature was out in the front yard, poking dirt with a stick, and secretly wondering if she could make a hole deep enough to lie down in and die.     CHAPTER II.  A SAD STORY.   After dinner, Mrs. Parlin was seated on the lounge in the nursery, looking very sad. Raising her eyes, she saw Dotty standing before her, twisting a corner of her apron. The child had entered as quietly as her own shadow, and her mother had not heard a footfall.  \"My dear little girl, I am going to tell you a story.\"  \"Yes, 'm.\"  Dotty looked steadily at her finger-nails.  \"A true story about a child who let her temper run away with her.\"  \"Yes, 'm,\" replied Dotty again, giving her mother a view of her rosy right ear.  Mrs. Parlin saw that Dotty was very much ashamed. Her face did not look as it had looked in the early morning. Then      \"There was a hardness in her eye,     There was a hardness in her cheek:\"  now she appeared as if she would be very much obliged to the nursery floor if it would open like a trap-door and let her fall through, out of everybody's sight.  \"The little girl I am going to tell you about, Dotty, lived in this state. Her name was Harriet Snow. Her father and mother were both dead. She had occasional fits of temper, which were very dreadful indeed. At such times she would hop up and down and scream.\"  Dotty tied the two corners of her apron into a hard knot. The story was rather too personal.  \"Was the little girl pretty?\" said she, trying to change the subject.  \"Not very pretty, I think. Her skin was dark; her eyes were black, and remarkably bright. When I saw her, she was thirteen years old; and you may know, Dotty, that by that time her face could not well be very pleasant: temper always leaves its marks.\"  Dotty looked at her little plump hands, as if she expected to see black spots on them.  \"Sometimes Harriet beat her head against the wall so violently that there seemed to be danger of her dashing her brains out.\"  Dotty looked up quite bravely. This dreadful little girl was worse than _she_ had ever been! O, yes!  \"Wasn't she crazy, mamma?\"  Mrs. Parlin shook her head.  \"No, I am afraid not, dear. Only, when she allowed anger to stay in her heart, it made her feel blind and dizzy. Perhaps she was crazy for the time.\"  Dotty hung her head again. She remembered how blind and dizzy she herself had felt while screaming at Norah that morning.  \"This little girl had no mother to warn her against indulging her temper. When she had the feeling of hate swelling at her heart, nobody told her what it was like. _You_ know what it is like, Dotty?\"  Dotty's chin drooped, and rested in the hollow of her neck.  \"I don't want to tell you, mamma.\"  \"Like _murder_, my child.\"  Dotty shuddered, though she had known this before. Her mother had often read to her from the Bible, that \"whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer.\"  \"Well, there was no one to love this poor Harriet; she was not lovable.\"  \"No, 'm, she was _hateable_!\" remarked Dotty, anxious to say something; for if she held her peace, she was afraid her mother would think she was applying the story to herself.  \"There was no one to love her; so a woman took her, and was paid for it by the town.\"  \"Town? Town, mamma? A _town_ is _houses_.\"  \"She was paid for it by men in the town. I don't know whether this woman tried to teach Harriet in the right way or not. It may be she had so much to do that she thought it less trouble to punish her when she was naughty than to instruct her how to be good.\"  \"O, yes; I s'pose she struck her with a stick,\" said Dotty, patting her forefingers together--\"just this way.\"  \"Harriet had the care of one of Mrs. Gray's children, a lively little boy about two years old.\"  \"Was he cunning? As cunning as Katie Clifford? Did he say, 'If you love me, you give me hunnerd dollars; and I go buy me 'tick o' canny'?\"  \"Very likely he was quite as cunning as Katie. You would hardly think any one could get out of patience with such a little creature--would you, my daughter?\"  \"No, indeed!\" cried Dotty, eagerly, and feeling that she was on safe ground, for she loved babies dearly, and was always patient with them.  \"I don't know but Harriet was envious of Mrs. Gray's little boy, because he had nicer things to eat than she had.\"  \"Well, it ought to have nicer things, mamma, 'cause it hadn't any teeth.\"  \"And she got tired of running after him.\"  \"No matter if she did get tired, mamma; the baby was tireder than she was!\"  \"And the parents think now it is very likely she was in the habit of striking him when nobody knew it.\"  \"What a naughty, wicked, awful girl!\" cried Dotty, her eyes flashing.  \"She had a fiery temper, my child, and had never learned to control it.\"  Dotty looked at her feet in silence.  \"The baby was afraid of his little nurse; but he could not speak to tell how he was abused; all he could do was to cry when he was left with Harriet. But one day Mrs. Gray was obliged to go away to see her sick mother. She charged Harriet to take good care of little Freddy, and give him some baked apples and milk if he was hungry.\"  \"With bread in?\" suggested Dotty.  \"Yes, I suppose so. Then she kissed her baby. He put his arms around her neck, and cried to go too; but she could not take him.\"  \"I s'pose he cried 'cause he 'xpected that awful girl was a-going to shake him,\" said Dotty, indignantly.  \"I cannot tell you precisely what Harriet did to him; but when the father and mother got home, that darling boy was moaning in great pain. They sent for the doctor, who said his spine was injured, and perhaps he would never walk again; and, indeed, he never did.\"  \"O, mamma! mamma Parlin!\"  \"Yes, my child; and it is supposed that Harriet must have hurt him in one of her fits of rage.\"  Dotty's face had grown very white.  \"O, mamma, what did the folks do with Harriet?\"  \"They took her to court, and tried her for abusing the little"]]]
