Whenever Wang thought of his grandfather's remarks about his ancestors, he always wondered, as a corollary, what those same ancestors would have thought about a forest growing up here, where no forest like this one had ever grown before.  They were called paper-trees because the bulk of their pulp was used to make paper (they were of no use whatever as lumber), but they weren't trees, really, and the organic chemicals that were leached from them during the pulping process were of far more value than the paper pulp.  They were mutations of a smaller plant that had been found in the temperate regions of Mars and purposely changed genetically to grow on the Siberian tundra, where the conditions were similar to, but superior to, their natural habitat. They looked as though someone had managed to cross breed the Joshua tree with the cypress and then persuaded the result to grow grass instead of leaves.  In the distance, Wang heard the whining of the wind and he automatically pulled his coat a little tighter, even though he noticed no increase in the wind velocity around him.  Then, as the whine became louder, he realized that it was not the wind.  He turned his head toward the noise and looked up. For a long minute, he watched the sky as the sound gained volume, but he could see nothing at first. Then he caught a glimpse of motion. A dot that was hard to distinguish against the cloud-mottled gray sky.  What was it? An air transport in trouble? There were two trans-polar routes that passed within a few hundred miles of here, but no air transport he had ever seen had made a noise like that. Normally, they were so high as to be both invisible and inaudible. Must be trouble of some sort.  He reached down to the saddle pack without taking his eyes off the moving speck and took out the radiophone. He held it to his ear and thumbed the call button insistently.  _Grandfather_, he thought with growing irritation as the seconds passed, _wake up! Come on, old dozer, rouse yourself from your dreams!_  At the same time, he checked his wrist compass and estimated the direction of flight of the dot and its direction from him. He'd at least be able to give the airline authorities some information if the ship fell. He wished there were some way to triangulate its height and so on, but he had no need for that kind of thing, so he hadn't the equipment.  \"Yes? Yes?\" came a testy, dry voice through the earphone.  Quickly, Wang gave his grandfather all the information he had on the flying thing. By now, the whine had become a shrill roar, and the thing in the air had become a silver-pink fish shape.  \"I think it's coming down very close to here,\" Wang concluded. \"You call the authorities and let them know that one of the aircraft is in trouble. I'll see if I can be of any help here. I'll call you back later.\"  \"As you say,\" the old man said hurriedly. He cut off.         *       *       *       *       *  Wang was beginning to realize that the thing was a spaceship, not an airship. By this time, he could see the thing more clearly. He had never actually seen a spacecraft, but he'd seen enough of them on television to know what they looked like. This one didn't look like a standard type at all, and it didn't behave like one, but it looked even less like an airship, and he knew enough to know that he didn't necessarily know every type of spaceship ever built.  In shape, it resembled the old rocket-propelled jobs that had been first used for space exploration a century before, rather than looking like the fat ovoids that he was used to. But there were no signs of rocket exhausts, and yet the ship was very obviously slowing, so it must have an inertia drive.  It was coming in much lower now, on a line north of him, headed almost due east. He urged the mare forward, in order to try to keep up with the craft, although it was obviously going several hundred miles per hour--hardly a horse's pace.  Still, it was slowing rapidly--very rapidly. Maybe--  He kept the mare moving.  The strange ship skimmed along the treetops in the distance and disappeared from sight. Then there was a thunderous crash, a tearing of wood and foliage, and a grinding, plowing sound.  For a few seconds afterward, there was silence. Then there came a soft rumble, as of water beginning to boil in some huge, but distant, samovar. It seemed to go on and on and on.  And there was a bluish, fluctuating glow on the horizon.  _Radioactivity?_ Wang wondered. Surely not an atomic-powered ship without safety cutoffs in this day and age.  He pulled out his radiophone and thumbed the call button again.  This time, there was no delay. \"Yes?\"  \"How are the radiation detectors behaving there, Grandfather?\"  \"One moment. I shall see.\" There was a silence. Then: \"No unusual activity, young Wang. Why?\"  Wang told him, then asked: \"Did you get hold of the air authorities?\"  \"Yes. They have no missing aircraft, but they're checking with the space fields. The way you describe it, the thing must be a spaceship of some kind.\"  \"I think so, too. I wish I had a radiation detector here, though. I'd like to know whether that thing is hot or not. It's only a couple of miles or so away. I think I'd better stay away. Meanwhile, you'd better put in a call to Central Headquarters Fire Control. There's going to be a holocaust if I'm any judge unless they get here fast with plenty of equipment.\"  \"I'll see to it,\" said his grandfather, cutting off.  The bluish glow in the sky had quite died away by now, and the distant rumbling was gone, too. And, oddly enough, there was not much smoke in the distance. There was a small cloud of gray that rose, streamerlike, from where the glow had been, but even that faded away fairly rapidly in the chill breeze. Quite obviously, there would be no fire. After several more minutes of watching, he was sure of it. There couldn't have been much heat produced in that explosion--if it could really be called an explosion.  Then he saw something moving in the trees between himself and the spot where the ship had come down. He couldn't quite see what it was, but it looked like someone crawling.  \"Halloo, there!\" he called out. \"Are you hurt?\"  There was no answer. Perhaps whoever it was didn't understand Russian. Wang's command of English wasn't too good, but he called out in that language.  Still there was no answer. Whoever it was had crawled out of sight.  Then he realized that it couldn't be anyone crawling. No one could even have run the distance between here and the ship in the time since it had hit, much less crawled.  He frowned. A wolf, then? Possibly. They weren't too common, but there were still plenty of them around.  He unholstered the heavy pistol at his side.  And, as he slid the barrel free, he became the first human being ever to see the Nipe.  For an instant, as the Nipe came out from behind a tree fifteen feet away, Wang Kulichenko froze as he saw those four baleful violet eyes glaring at him from the snouted head. He jerked up the pistol to fire.  He was much too late. His reflexes were too slow by far. The Nipe launched itself across the intervening space in a blur of speed that would have made a leopard seem slow. The alien's hands slapped aside the gun with a violence that broke the man's wrist, while other hands slammed at his skull.  Wang Kulichenko hardly had time to be surprised before he died.         *       *       *       *       *  The Nipe stood quietly for a moment, looking down at the thing he had killed. His stomach churned with disgust. He ignored the fading hoofbeats of the slave-animal from which he had knocked the thing that lay on the ground with a crushed skull. The slave-animal was unintelligent and unimportant.  This was the intelligent one.  But so slow! So incredibly slow! And so weak and soft!  It seemed impossible that such poorly-equipped beasts could have survived long enough on any world to evolve to become the dominant life form.  Perhaps it was not the dominant form. Perhaps it was merely a higher slave-animal. He would have to do more investigating.  He picked up the weapon the thing had drawn and examined it carefully. The mechanism was unfamiliar, but a glance at the muzzle told him that it was a projectile weapon of some sort. The twisted grooves in the barrel were obviously designed to impart a spin to the projectile, to give it gyroscopic stability while in flight.  The dead thing must have thought he was a wild animal, the Nipe decided. Surely no being would carry a weapon for use against members of its own or another intelligent species.  He examined the rest of the equipment on the thing. Not much information there. Too bad the slave-animal was gone; there had apparently been more equipment strapped to it.  The next question was, what should he do with the body?  Devour it properly, as one should with a validly slain foe?  It didn't seem that he could do anything else, and yet his stomachs wanted to rebel at the thought. After all, it wasn't as if the thing were really a proper being. It was astonishing to find another intelligent race; none had ever been found before. But he was determined to show them that he was civilized and intelligent, too.  On the other hand, they were obviously of a lower order than the Nipe, and that made the question even more puzzling.  In the end, he decided to leave the thing here, for others of its kind to find. They would doubtless consume it properly.  And--he glanced at the sky and listened--they would be here in time. There were aircraft coming.  He would have to leave quickly. He had to find one of their production or supply centers, and he would have to do it alone, with only the equipment he had on him. The utter destruction of his ship had left him seriously hampered.  He began moving, staying in the protection of the trees. His ethical sense still bothered him. It was not at all civilized to leave a body to the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30742"],["title","Anything You Can Do! (#2)"],["body"," of lesser animals or monocells like that. What kind of monster would they think he was?  Still, there was no help for it. If they caught him while feeding, they might have thought him a lower animal and shot him. He couldn't put an onus like that upon them.  He moved on.   III  Two-fifths of a second. That was all the time Bart Stanton had from the first moment his supersensitive ears heard the faint whisper of metal against leather.  He made good use of it.  The noise had come from behind and slightly to the left of him, so he drew his own gun with his left hand and spun to his left as he dropped to a crouch. He had turned almost completely around, drawn his gun, and fired three shots before the other man had even leveled his own weapon.  The bullets from Stanton's gun made three round spots on the man's jacket, almost touching each other and directly over the heart. The man blinked stupidly for a moment, looking down at the round spots.  \"My God,\" he said softly.  Then the man returned his weapon slowly to his holster.  [Illustration]  The big room was noisy. The three shots had merely added to the noise of the gunfire that rattled intermittently around the two men. And even that gunfire was only a part of the cacophony. The tortured molecules of the air in the room were so besieged by the beat of drums, the blare of trumpets, the crackle of lightning, the rumble of heavy machinery, the squawks and shrieks of horns and whistles, the rustle of autumn leaves, the machine-gun snap of popping popcorn, the clink and jingle of falling coins, and the yelps, bellows, howls, roars, snarls, grunts, bleats, moos, purrs, cackles, quacks, chirps, buzzes, and hisses of a myriad of animals, that each molecule would have thought that it was being shoved in a hundred thousand different directions at once if it had had a mind to think with.  The noise wasn't deafening, but it was certainly all-pervasive.  Bart Stanton had reholstered his own weapon and half opened his lips to speak when he heard another sound behind him.  Again he whirled his guns in hand--both of them this time--and his forefingers only fractions of a millimeter from the point that would fire the hair triggers.  But he did not fire.  The second man had merely shifted the weapons in his holsters and then dropped his hands away.  The noise, which had been flooding into the room over the speaker system, died instantly.  Stanton shoved his guns back into place and rose from his crouch. \"Real cute,\" he said, grinning. \"I wasn't expecting that one.\"  The man he was facing smiled back. \"Well, Bart, maybe we've proved our point. What do you think, Colonel?\" The last was addressed to the third man, who was still standing quietly, looking worried and surprised about the three spots on his jacket that had come from the special harmless projectiles in Stanton's gun.  Colonel Mannheim was four inches shorter than Stanton's five-ten, and was fifteen years older. But, in spite of the differences, he would have laughed at anyone who had told him, five minutes before, that he couldn't outdraw a man who was standing with his back turned.  His bright blue eyes, set deep beneath craggy brows in a tanned face, looked speculatively at the younger man. \"Incredible,\" he said gently. \"Absolutely incredible.\" Then he looked at the other man, a lean civilian with mild blue eyes a shade lighter than his own. \"All right, Dr. Farnsworth, I'm convinced. You and your staff have quite literally created a superman. Anyone who can stand in a noise-filled room and hear a man draw a gun twenty feet behind him is incredible enough. The fact that he could and did outdraw and outshoot me after I had started ... well, that's almost beyond comprehension.\"  He looked back at Bart Stanton. \"What's your opinion, Mr. Stanton? Think you can handle the Nipe?\"  Stanton paused imperceptibly before answering, while his ultrafast mind considered the problem and arrived at a decision. Just how much confidence should he show the colonel? Mannheim was a man with tremendous confidence in himself, but who was capable of recognizing that there were men who were his superiors, in one field or another.  \"If I can't dispose of the Nipe,\" Stanton said, \"no one can.\"  Colonel Mannheim nodded slowly. \"I believe you're right,\" he said at last. His voice was firm with inner conviction. He shot a glance at Farnsworth. \"How about the second man?\"  Farnsworth shook his head. \"He'll never make it. In another two years, we can put him into reasonable shape again, but his nervous system just couldn't stand the gaff.\"  \"Can we get another man ready in time?\"  \"Hardly. We can't just pick a man up off the street and turn him into a superman. Even if we could find another subject with Bart's genetic possibilities, it would take more time than we have to spare.\"  \"This isn't magic, Colonel. You don't change a nobody into a physical and mental giant by saying _abracadabra_ or by teaching him how to pronounce _shazam_ properly.\"  \"I'm aware of that,\" said Colonel Mannheim without rancor. \"Five years of work on Mr. Stanton must have taught you something, though. I should think you could repeat the process in less time.\"  Farnsworth repeated the headshaking. \"Human beings aren't machines, Colonel. They require time to heal, time to learn, time to integrate themselves. Remember that, in spite of all our increased knowledge of anesthesia, antibiotics, viricides, and obstetrics, it still takes nine months to produce a baby. We're in the same position, only more so.\"  \"I see,\" said Mannheim.  \"Besides,\" Dr. Farnsworth continued, \"Stanton's body and nervous system are now close to the theoretical limit for human tissue. I'm afraid you don't realize what kind of mental stability and organization are required to handle the equipment he now has.\"  \"I'm sure I don't,\" the colonel agreed. \"I doubt if anyone besides Stanton himself knows.\"  Dr. Farnsworth's manner softened a little. \"You're probably quite right. Suffice it to say that Bartholomew Stanton is the only answer we've found so far, and the only answer visible in the foreseeable future to the problem posed by the Nipe.\"  The colonel's face darkened. \"I keep hoping that our policy of handling the Nipe hasn't been a mistake. If it has, it's going to prove a fatal one--for the whole race.\"  \"Let's go into the lounge,\" Farnsworth said. \"Standing around in an empty chamber like this isn't the most comfortable way to discuss the fate of mankind.\" His voice brought hollow echoes from the walls.  Colonel Mannheim grinned at the touch of lightness the biophysicist had injected into the conversation. \"Very well. I could do with some coffee, if you have some.\"  \"All you want,\" said Dr. Farnsworth, leading the way toward the door of the chamber and opening it. \"Or, if you'd prefer something with a little more power to it--?\"  \"Thanks, no. Coffee will do fine,\" said Mannheim. \"How about you, Mr. Stanton?\"  Bart Stanton shook his head. \"I'd love to have some coffee, but I'll leave the alcohol alone. I'd just have the luck to be finishing a drink when our friend, the Nipe, popped in on us. And when I do meet him, I'm going to need every microsecond of reflex speed I can scrape up.\"         *       *       *       *       *  They walked down a soft-floored, warmly-lit corridor to an elevator which whisked them up to the main level of the Neurophysical Institute Building.  Another corridor led them to a room that might have been the common room of one of the more exclusive men's clubs. There were soft chairs and shelves of books and reading tables and smoking stands, all quietly luxurious. There was no one in the room when the three men entered.  \"We can have some privacy here,\" Dr. Farnsworth said. \"None of the rest of the staff will come in until we're through.\"  Colonel Mannheim looked at the biophysicist speculatively. \"You seem to think secrecy's important all of a sudden.\"  Bart Stanton grinned and kept silent.  Dr. Farnsworth went over to a table, where an urn of coffee radiated soft warmth. \"Cream and sugar over there on the tray,\" he said as he began to fill cups.  \"Frankly,\" Colonel Mannheim said, \"I was going to ask you to find us a place where we could talk privately. You seem to have anticipated me.\"  \"I thought you might have something like that in mind,\" said Dr. Farnsworth without looking up.  The cups were filled and the three men sat down in a triangle of chairs before any of them spoke again. Colonel Mannheim took a sip from his cup and then looked up.  \"All right, we'll begin this way. Mr. Stanton, granted that you've been through five years of hell--but how closely have you stayed in touch with the Nipe situation?\"  \"As best I could through news bulletins and information that your office has sent here.\"  \"Could you give me an oral summary?\"  Bart Stanton thought for a moment. It was true that he'd been out of touch with what had been going on outside the walls of the Neurophysical Institute for the past five years. In spite of the reading he'd done and the newscasts he'd watched and the TV tapes he'd seen, he still had no real feeling for the situation.  There were hazy periods during that five years. He had undergone extensive glandular and neural operations of great delicacy, many of which had resulted in what could have been agonizing pain without the use of suppressors. As a result, he possessed a biological engine that, for sheer driving power and nicety of control, surpassed any other known to exist or to have ever existed on Earth--with the possible exception of the Nipe. But those five years of rebuilding and retraining had left a gap in his life.  Several of the steps required to make the conversion from man to superman had resulted in temporary insanity; the wild, swinging imbalances of glandular secretions seeking a new balance, the erratic misfirings of neurons as they attempted to adjust to higher nerve-impulse velocities, and the sheer fatigue engendered by cells"]]]
