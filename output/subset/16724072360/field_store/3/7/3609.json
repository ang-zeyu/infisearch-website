It was one of them, one of the ruined race, the race that had perished.  For a long time they stared at the picture. At last Dorle replaced the board.  \"All these other crates,\" Nasha said. \"More pictures. And these drums. What are in the boxes?\"  \"This is their treasure,\" Tance said, almost to himself. \"Here are their pictures, their records. Probably all their literature is here, their stories, their myths, their ideas about the universe.\"  \"And their history,\" Nasha said. \"We'll be able to trace their development and find out what it was that made them become what they were.\"  Dorle was wandering around the vault. \"Odd,\" he murmured. \"Even at the end, even after they had begun to fight they still knew, someplace down inside them, that their real treasure was this, their books and pictures, their myths. Even after their big cities and buildings and industries were destroyed they probably hoped to come back and find this. After everything else was gone.\"  \"When we get back home we can agitate for a mission to come here,\" Tance said. \"All this can be loaded up and taken back. We'll be leaving about--\"  He stopped.  \"Yes,\" Dorle said dryly. \"We'll be leaving about three day-periods from now. We'll fix the ship, then take off. Soon we'll be home, that is, if nothing happens. Like being shot down by that--\"  \"Oh, stop it!\" Nasha said impatiently. \"Leave him alone. He's right: all this must be taken back home, sooner or later. We'll have to solve the problem of the gun. We have no choice.\"  Dorle nodded. \"What's your solution, then? As soon as we leave the ground we'll be shot down.\" His face twisted bitterly. \"They've guarded their treasure too well. Instead of being preserved it will lie here until it rots. It serves them right.\"  \"How?\"  \"Don't you see? This was the only way they knew, building a gun and setting it up to shoot anything that came along. They were so certain that everything was hostile, the enemy, coming to take their possessions away from them. Well, they can keep them.\"  Nasha was deep in thought, her mind far away. Suddenly she gasped. \"Dorle,\" she said. \"What's the matter with us? We have no problem. The gun is no menace at all.\"  The two men stared at her.  \"No menace?\" Dorle said. \"It's already shot us down once. And as soon as we take off again--\"  \"Don't you see?\" Nasha began to laugh. \"The poor foolish gun, it's completely harmless. Even I could deal with it alone.\"  \"You?\"  Her eyes were flashing. \"With a crowbar. With a hammer or a stick of wood. Let's go back to the ship and load up. Of course we're at its mercy in the air: that's the way it was made. It can fire into the sky, shoot down anything that flies. But that's all! Against something on the ground it has no defenses. Isn't that right?\"  Dorle nodded slowly. \"The soft underbelly of the dragon. In the legend, the dragon's armor doesn't cover its stomach.\" He began to laugh. \"That's right. That's perfectly right.\"  \"Let's go, then,\" Nasha said. \"Let's get back to the ship. We have work to do here.\"         *       *       *       *       *  It was early the next morning when they reached the ship. During the night the Captain had died, and the crew had ignited his body, according to custom. They had stood solemnly around it until the last ember died. As they were going back to their work the woman and the two men appeared, dirty and tired, still excited.  And presently, from the ship, a line of people came, each carrying something in his hands. The line marched across the gray slag, the eternal expanse of fused metal. When they reached the weapon they all fell on the gun at once, with crowbars, hammers, anything that was heavy and hard.  The telescopic sights shattered into bits. The wiring was pulled out, torn to shreds. The delicate gears were smashed, dented.  Finally the warheads themselves were carried off and the firing pins removed.  The gun was smashed, the great weapon destroyed. The people went down into the vault and examined the treasure. With its metal-armored guardian dead there was no danger any longer. They studied the pictures, the films, the crates of books, the jeweled crowns, the cups, the statues.  At last, as the sun was dipping into the gray mists that drifted across the planet they came back up the stairs again. For a moment they stood around the wrecked gun looking at the unmoving outline of it.  Then they started back to the ship. There was still much work to be done. The ship had been badly hurt, much had been damaged and lost. The important thing was to repair it as quickly as possible, to get it into the air.  With all of them working together it took just five more days to make it spaceworthy.         *       *       *       *       *  Nasha stood in the control room, watching the planet fall away behind them. She folded her arms, sitting down on the edge of the table.  \"What are you thinking?\" Dorle said.  \"I? Nothing.\"  \"Are you sure?\"  \"I was thinking that there must have been a time when this planet was quite different, when there was life on it.\"  \"I suppose there was. It's unfortunate that no ships from our system came this far, but then we had no reason to suspect intelligent life until we saw the fission glow in the sky.\"  \"And then it was too late.\"  \"Not quite too late. After all, their possessions, their music, books, their pictures, all of that will survive. We'll take them home and study them, and they'll change us. We won't be the same afterwards. Their sculpturing, especially. Did you see the one of the great winged creature, without a head or arms? Broken off, I suppose. But those wings-- It looked very old. It will change us a great deal.\"  \"When we come back we won't find the gun waiting for us,\" Nasha said. \"Next time it won't be there to shoot us down. We can land and take the treasure, as you call it.\" She smiled up at Dorle. \"You'll lead us back there, as a good captain should.\"  \"Captain?\" Dorle grinned. \"Then you've decided.\"  Nasha shrugged. \"Fomar argues with me too much. I think, all in all, I really prefer you.\"  \"Then let's go,\" Dorle said. \"Let's go back home.\"  The ship roared up, flying over the ruins of the city. It turned in a huge arc and then shot off beyond the horizon, heading into outer space.         *       *       *       *       *  Down below, in the center of the ruined city, a single half-broken detector vane moved slightly, catching the roar of the ship. The base of the great gun throbbed painfully, straining to turn. After a moment a red warning light flashed on down inside its destroyed works.  And a long way off, a hundred miles from the city, another warning light flashed on, far underground. Automatic relays flew into action. Gears turned, belts whined. On the ground above a section of metal slag slipped back. A ramp appeared.  A moment later a small cart rushed to the surface.  The cart turned toward the city. A second cart appeared behind it. It was loaded with wiring cables. Behind it a third cart came, loaded with telescopic tube sights. And behind came more carts, some with relays, some with firing controls, some with tools and parts, screws and bolts, pins and nuts. The final one contained atomic warheads.  The carts lined up behind the first one, the lead cart. The lead cart started off, across the frozen ground, bumping calmly along, followed by the others. Moving toward the city.  To the damaged gun.     Transcriber's Note:      This etext was produced from _Planet Stories_ September 1952.

Bristol and Cardiff Double Lights (those statelily inclined beams over Severnmouth) are dead ahead of us; for we keep the Southern Winter Route. Coventry Central, the pivot of the English system, stabs upward once in ten seconds its spear of diamond light to the north; and a point or two off our starboard bow The Leek, the great cloud-breaker of Saint David's Head, swings its unmistakable green beam twenty-five degrees each way. There must be half a mile of fluff over it in this weather, but it does not affect The Leek.  \"Our planet's overlighted if anything,\" says Captain Purnall at the wheel, as Cardiff-Bristol slides under. \"I remember the old days of common white verticals that 'ud show two or three thousand feet up in a mist, if you knew where to look for 'em. In really fluffy weather they might as well have been under your hat. One could get lost coming home then, an' have some fun. Now, it's like driving down Piccadilly.\"  He points to the pillars of light where the cloud-breakers bore through the cloud-floor. We see nothing of England's outlines: only a white pavement pierced in all directions by these manholes of variously coloured fire--Holy Island's white and red--St. Bee's interrupted white, and so on as far as the eye can reach. Blessed be Sargent, Ahrens, and the Dubois brothers, who invented the cloud-breakers of the world whereby we travel in security!  \"Are you going to lift for The Shamrock?\" asks Captain Hodgson. Cork Light (green, fixed) enlarges as we rush to it. Captain Purnall nods. There is heavy traffic hereabouts--the cloud-bank beneath us is streaked with running fissures of flame where the Atlantic boats are hurrying Londonward just clear of the fluff. Mail-packets are supposed, under the Conference rules, to have the five-thousand-foot lanes to themselves, but the foreigner in a hurry is apt to take liberties with English air. \"No. 162\" lifts to a long-drawn wail of the breeze in the fore-flange of the rudder and we make Valencia (white, green, white) at a safe 7,000 feet, dipping our beam to an incoming Washington packet.  There is no cloud on the Atlantic, and faint streaks of cream round Dingle Bay show where the driven seas hammer the coast. A big S. A. T. A. liner (_Société Anonyme des Transports Aëriens_) is diving and lifting half a mile below us in search of some break in the solid west wind. Lower still lies a disabled Dane: she is telling the liner all about it in International. Our General Communication dial has caught her talk and begins to eavesdrop. Captain Hodgson makes a motion to shut it off but checks himself. \"Perhaps you'd like to listen,\" he says.  \"'Argol' of St. Thomas,\" the Dane whimpers. \"Report owners three starboard shaft collar-bearings fused. Can make Flores as we are, but impossible further. Shall we buy spares at Fayal?\"  The liner acknowledges and recommends inverting the bearings. The \"Argol\" answers that she has already done so without effect, and begins to relieve her mind about cheap German enamels for collar-bearings. The Frenchman assents cordially, cries \"_Courage, mon ami_,\" and switches off.  Their lights sink under the curve of the ocean.  \"That's one of Lundt & Bleamers's boats,\" says Captain Hodgson. \"Serves 'em right for putting German compos in their thrust-blocks. _She_ won't be in Fayal to-night! By the way, wouldn't you like to look round the engine-room?\"  I have been waiting eagerly for this invitation and I follow Captain Hodgson from the control-platform, stooping low to avoid the bulge of the tanks. We know that Fleury's gas can lift anything, as the world-famous trials of '89 showed, but its almost indefinite powers of expansion necessitate vast tank room. Even in this thin air the lift-shunts are busy taking out one-third of its normal lift, and still \"162\" must be checked by an occasional downdraw of the rudder or our flight would become a climb to the stars. Captain Purnall prefers an overlifted to an underlifted ship; but no two captains trim ship alike. \"When _I_ take the bridge,\" says Captain Hodgson, \"you'll see me shunt forty per cent. of the lift out of the gas and run her on the upper rudder. With a swoop upwards instead of a swoop downwards, _as_ you say. Either way will do. It's only habit. Watch our dip-dial! Tim fetches her down once every thirty knots as regularly as breathing.\"  So is it shown on the dip-dial. For five or six minutes the arrow creeps from 6,700 to 7,300. There is the faint \"szgee\" of the rudder, and back slides the arrow to 6,500 on a falling slant of ten or fifteen knots.  \"In heavy weather you jockey her with the screws as well,\" says Captain Hodgson, and, unclipping the jointed bar which divides the engine-room from the bare deck, he leads me on to the floor.  Here we find Fleury's Paradox of the Bulkheaded Vacuum--which we accept now without thought--literally in full blast. The three engines are H. T. &. T. assisted-vacuo Fleury turbines running from 3,000 to the Limit--that is to say, up to the point when the blades make the air \"bell\"--cut out a vacuum for themselves precisely as over-driven marine propellers used to do. \"162's\" Limit is low on account of the small size of her nine screws, which, though handier than the old colloid Thelussons, \"bell\" sooner. The midships engine, generally used as a reinforce, is not running; so the port and starboard turbine vacuum-chambers draw direct into the return-mains.  The turbines whistle reflectively. From the low-arched expansion-tanks on either side the valves descend pillarwise to the turbine-chests, and thence the obedient gas whirls through the spirals of blades with a force that would whip the teeth out of a power-saw. Behind, is its own pressure held in leash or spurred on by the lift-shunts; before it, the vacuum where Fleury's Ray dances in violet-green bands and whirled turbillions of flame. The jointed U-tubes of the vacuum-chamber are pressure-tempered colloid (no glass would endure the strain for an instant) and a junior engineer with tinted spectacles watches the Ray intently. It is the very heart of the machine--a mystery to this day. Even Fleury who begat it and, unlike Magniac, died a multi-millionaire, could not explain how the restless little imp shuddering in the U-tube can, in the fractional fraction of a second, strike the furious blast of gas into a chill grayish-green liquid that drains (you can hear it trickle) from the far end of the vacuum through the eduction-pipes and the mains back to the bilges. Here it returns to its gaseous, one had almost written sagacious, state and climbs to work afresh. Bilge-tank, upper tank, dorsal-tank, expansion-chamber, vacuum, main-return (as a liquid), and bilge-tank once more is the ordained cycle. Fleury's Ray sees to that; and the engineer with the tinted spectacles sees to Fleury's Ray. If a speck of oil, if even the natural grease of the human finger touch the hooded terminals Fleury's Ray will wink and disappear and must be laboriously built up again. This means half a day's work for all hands and an expense of one hundred and seventy-odd pounds to the G. P. O. for radium-salts and such trifles.  \"Now look at our thrust-collars. You won't find much German compo there. Full-jewelled, you see,\" says Captain Hodgson as the engineer shunts open the top of a cap. Our shaft-bearings are C. M. C. (Commercial Minerals Company) stones, ground with as much care as the lens of a telescope. They cost £37 apiece. So far we have not arrived at their term of life. These bearings came from \"No. 97,\" which took them over from the old \"Dominion of Light,\" which had them out of the wreck of the \"Perseus\" aëroplane in the years when men still flew linen kites over thorium engines!  They are a shining reproof to all low-grade German \"ruby\" enamels, so-called \"boort\" facings, and the dangerous and unsatisfactory alumina compounds which please dividend-hunting owners and turn skippers crazy.  The rudder-gear and the gas lift-shunt, seated side by side under the engine-room dials, are the only machines in visible motion. The former sighs from time to time as the oil plunger rises and falls half an inch. The latter, cased and guarded like the U-tube aft, exhibits another Fleury Ray, but inverted and more green than violet. Its function is to shunt the lift out of the gas, and this it will do without watching. That is all! A tiny pump-rod wheezing and whining to itself beside a sputtering green lamp. A hundred and fifty feet aft down the flat-topped tunnel of the tanks a violet light, restless and irresolute. Between the two, three white-painted turbine-trunks, like eel-baskets laid on their side, accentuate the empty perspectives. You can hear the trickle of the liquefied gas flowing from the vacuum into the bilge-tanks and the soft _gluck-glock_ of gas-locks closing as Captain Purnall brings \"162\" down by the head. The hum of the turbines and the boom of the air on our skin is no more than a cotton-wool wrapping to the universal stillness. And we are running an eighteen-second mile.  I peer from the fore end of the engine-room over the hatch-coamings into the coach. The mail-clerks are sorting the Winnipeg, Calgary, and Medicine Hat bags: but there is a pack of cards ready on the table.  Suddenly a bell thrills; the engineers run to the turbine-valves and stand by; but the spectacled slave of the Ray in the U-tube never lifts his head. He must watch where he is. We are hard-braked and going astern; there is language from the control-platform.  \"Tim's sparking badly about something,\" says the unruffled Captain Hodgson. \"Let's look.\"  Captain Purnall is not the suave man we left half an hour since, but the embodied authority of the G. P. O. Ahead of us floats an ancient, aluminum-patched, twin-screw tramp of the dingiest, with no more right to the 5,000 foot lane"]]]
