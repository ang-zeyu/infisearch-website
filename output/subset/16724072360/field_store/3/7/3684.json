Gelsen was ready to admit that he had been wrong about the watchbirds. They _were_ doing a job that humans had been unable to accomplish.  The first hint of something wrong came that morning.  Macintyre came into his office. He stood silently in front of Gelsen's desk, looking annoyed and a little embarrassed.  \"What's the matter, Mac?\" Gelsen asked.  \"One of the watchbirds went to work on a slaughterhouse man. Knocked him out.\"  Gelsen thought about it for a moment. Yes, the watchbirds would do that. With their new learning circuits, they had probably defined the killing of animals as murder.  \"Tell the packers to mechanize their slaughtering,\" Gelsen said. \"I never liked that business myself.\"  \"All right,\" Macintyre said. He pursed his lips, then shrugged his shoulders and left.  Gelsen stood beside his desk, thinking. Couldn't the watchbirds differentiate between a murderer and a man engaged in a legitimate profession? No, evidently not. To them, murder was murder. No exceptions. He frowned. That might take a little ironing out in the circuits.  [Illustration]  But not too much, he decided hastily. Just make them a little more discriminating.  He sat down again and buried himself in paperwork, trying to avoid the edge of an old fear.         *       *       *       *       *  They strapped the prisoner into the chair and fitted the electrode to his leg.  \"Oh, oh,\" he moaned, only half-conscious now of what they were doing.  They fitted the helmet over his shaved head and tightened the last straps. He continued to moan softly.  And then the watchbird swept in. How he had come, no one knew. Prisons are large and strong, with many locked doors, but the watchbird was there--  To stop a murder.  \"Get that thing out of here!\" the warden shouted, and reached for the switch. The watchbird knocked him down.  \"Stop that!\" a guard screamed, and grabbed for the switch himself. He was knocked to the floor beside the warden.  \"This isn't murder, you idiot!\" another guard said. He drew his gun to shoot down the glittering, wheeling metal bird.  Anticipating, the watchbird smashed him back against the wall.  There was silence in the room. After a while, the man in the helmet started to giggle. Then he stopped.  The watchbird stood on guard, fluttering in mid-air--  Making sure no murder was done.  New data flashed along the watchbird network. Unmonitored, independent, the thousands of watchbirds received and acted upon it.  _The breaking, mangling or otherwise stopping the functions of a living organism by a living organism. New acts to stop._  \"Damn you, git going!\" Farmer Ollister shouted, and raised his whip again. The horse balked, and the wagon rattled and shook as he edged sideways.  \"You lousy hunk of pigmeal, git going!\" the farmer yelled and he raised the whip again.  It never fell. An alert watchbird, sensing violence, had knocked him out of his seat.  A living organism? What is a living organism? The watchbirds extended their definitions as they became aware of more facts. And, of course, this gave them more work.  The deer was just visible at the edge of the woods. The hunter raised his rifle, and took careful aim.  He didn't have time to shoot.         *       *       *       *       *  With his free hand, Gelsen mopped perspiration from his face. \"All right,\" he said into the telephone. He listened to the stream of vituperation from the other end, then placed the receiver gently in its cradle.  \"What was that one?\" Macintyre asked. He was unshaven, tie loose, shirt unbuttoned.  \"Another fisherman,\" Gelsen said. \"It seems the watchbirds won't let him fish even though his family is starving. What are we going to do about it, he wants to know.\"  \"How many hundred is that?\"  \"I don't know. I haven't opened the mail.\"  \"Well, I figured out where the trouble is,\" Macintyre said gloomily, with the air of a man who knows just how he blew up the Earth--after it was too late.  \"Let's hear it.\"  \"Everybody took it for granted that we wanted all murder stopped. We figured the watchbirds would think as we do. We ought to have qualified the conditions.\"  \"I've got an idea,\" Gelsen said, \"that we'd have to know just why and what murder is, before we could qualify the conditions properly. And if we knew that, we wouldn't need the watchbirds.\"  \"Oh, I don't know about that. They just have to be told that some things which look like murder are not murder.\"  \"But why should they stop fisherman?\" Gelsen asked.  \"Why shouldn't they? Fish and animals are living organisms. We just don't think that killing them is murder.\"  The telephone rang. Gelsen glared at it and punched the intercom. \"I told you no more calls, no matter what.\"  \"This is from Washington,\" his secretary said. \"I thought you'd--\"  \"Sorry.\" Gelsen picked up the telephone. \"Yes. Certainly is a mess ... Have they? All right, I certainly will.\" He put down the telephone.  \"Short and sweet,\" he told Macintyre. \"We're to shut down temporarily.\"  \"That won't be so easy,\" Macintyre said. \"The watchbirds operate independent of any central control, you know. They come back once a week for a repair checkup. We'll have to turn them off then, one by one.\"  \"Well, let's get to it. Monroe over on the Coast has shut down about a quarter of his birds.\"  \"I think I can dope out a restricting circuit,\" Macintyre said.  \"Fine,\" Gelsen replied bitterly. \"You make me very happy.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The watchbirds were learning rapidly, expanding and adding to their knowledge. Loosely defined abstractions were extended, acted upon and re-extended.  To stop murder ...  Metal and electrons reason well, but not in a human fashion.  _A_ living organism? _Any_ living organism!  The watchbirds set themselves the task of protecting all living things.  The fly buzzed around the room, lighting on a table top, pausing a moment, then darting to a window sill.  The old man stalked it, a rolled newspaper in his hand.  Murderer!  The watchbirds swept down and saved the fly in the nick of time.  The old man writhed on the floor a minute and then was silent. He had been given only a mild shock, but it had been enough for his fluttery, cranky heart.  His victim had been saved, though, and this was the important thing. Save the victim and give the aggressor his just desserts.         *       *       *       *       *  Gelsen demanded angrily, \"Why aren't they being turned off?\"  The assistant control engineer gestured. In a corner of the repair room lay the senior control engineer. He was just regaining consciousness.  \"He tried to turn one of them off,\" the assistant engineer said. Both his hands were knotted together. He was making a visible effort not to shake.  \"That's ridiculous. They haven't got any sense of self-preservation.\"  \"Then turn them off yourself. Besides, I don't think any more are going to come.\"  What could have happened? Gelsen began to piece it together. The watchbirds still hadn't decided on the limits of a living organism. When some of them were turned off in the Monroe plant, the rest must have correlated the data.  So they had been forced to assume that they were living organisms, as well.  No one had ever told them otherwise. Certainly they carried on most of the functions of living organisms.  Then the old fears hit him. Gelsen trembled and hurried out of the repair room. He wanted to find Macintyre in a hurry.         *       *       *       *       *  The nurse handed the surgeon the sponge.  \"Scalpel.\"  She placed it in his hand. He started to make the first incision. And then he was aware of a disturbance.  \"Who let that thing in?\"  \"I don't know,\" the nurse said, her voice muffled by the mask.  \"Get it out of here.\"  The nurse waved her arms at the bright winged thing, but it fluttered over her head.  The surgeon proceeded with the incision--as long as he was able.  The watchbird drove him away and stood guard.  \"Telephone the watchbird company!\" the surgeon ordered. \"Get them to turn the thing off.\"  The watchbird was preventing violence to a living organism.  The surgeon stood by helplessly while his patient died.         *       *       *       *       *  Fluttering high above the network of highways, the watchbird watched and waited. It had been constantly working for weeks now, without rest or repair. Rest and repair were impossible, because the watchbird couldn't allow itself--a living organism--to be murdered. And that was what happened when watchbirds returned to the factory.  There was a built-in order to return, after the lapse of a certain time period. But the watchbird had a stronger order to obey--preservation of life, including its own.  The definitions of murder were almost infinitely extended now, impossible to cope with. But the watchbird didn't consider that. It responded to its stimuli, whenever they came and whatever their source.  There was a new definition of living organism in its memory files. It had come as a result of the watchbird discovery that watchbirds were living organisms. And it had enormous ramifications.  The stimuli came! For the hundredth time that day, the bird wheeled and banked, dropping swiftly down to stop murder.  Jackson yawned and pulled his car to a shoulder of the road. He didn't notice the glittering dot in the sky. There was no reason for him to. Jackson wasn't contemplating murder, by any human definition.  This was a good spot for a nap, he decided. He had been driving for seven straight hours and his eyes were starting to fog. He reached out to turn off the ignition key--  And was knocked back against the side of the car.  \"What in hell's wrong with you?\" he asked indignantly. \"All I want to do is--\" He reached for the key again, and again he was smacked back.  Jackson knew better than to try a third time. He had been listening to the radio and he knew what the watchbirds did to stubborn violators.  \"You mechanical "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/296"],["title","The Cash Boy (#1)"],["body","n’t object to filling your place, I fancy.”  “He is welcome to the place as soon as the club feels like electing him,” said Frank. “Tell the boys I am sorry I can’t be on hand. They had better get you to fill my place.”  “I’ll mention it, but I don’t think they’ll see it in that light. They’re all jealous of my superior playing,” said Sam, humorously. “Well, good-bye, Frank. I hope your mother’ll be better soon.”  “Thank you, Sam,” answered Frank, soberly. “I hope so, too, but she is very sick.”  The next day Mrs. Fowler again called Frank to the bedside.  “Grace is gone out on an errand,” she said, “and I can find no better time for telling you what I know about you and the circumstances which led to my assuming the charge of you.”  “Are you strong enough, mother?”  “Yes, Frank. Thirteen years ago my husband and myself occupied a small tenement in that part of Brooklyn know as Gowanus, not far from Greenwood Cemetery. My husband was a carpenter, and though his wages were small he was generally employed. We had been married three years, but had no children of our own. Our expenses were small, and we got on comfortably, and should have continued to do so, but that Mr. Fowler met with an accident which partially disabled him. He fell from a high scaffold and broke his arm. This was set and he was soon able to work again, but he must also have met with some internal injury, for his full strength never returned. Half a day’s work tired him more than a whole day’s work formerly had done. Of course our income was very much diminished, and we were obliged to economize very closely. This preyed upon my husband’s mind and seeing his anxiety, I set about considering how I could help him, and earn my share of the expenses.  “One day in looking over the advertising columns of a New York paper I saw the following advertisement:  “‘For adoption--A healthy male infant. The parents are able to pay liberally for the child’s maintenance, but circumstances compel them to delegate the care to another. Address for interview A. M.’  “I had no sooner read this advertisement than I felt that it was just what I wanted. A liberal compensation was promised, and under our present circumstances would be welcome, as it was urgently needed. I mentioned the matter to my husband, and he was finally induced to give his consent.  “Accordingly, I replied to the advertisement.  “Three days passed in which I heard nothing from it. But as we were sitting at the supper table at six o’clock one afternoon, there came a knock at our front door. I opened it, and saw before me a tall stranger, a man of about thirty-five, of dark complexion, and dark whiskers. He was well dressed, and evidently a gentleman in station.  “‘Is this Mrs. Fowler?’ he asked.  “‘Yes, sir,’ I answered, in some surprise  “‘Then may I beg permission to enter your house for a few minutes? I have something to say to you.’  “Still wondering, I led the way into the sitting-room, where your father--where Mr. Fowler----”  “Call him my father--I know no other,” said Frank.  “Where your father was seated.  “‘You have answered an advertisement,’ said the stranger.  “‘Yes, sir,’ I replied.  “‘I am A. M.,’ was his next announcement. ‘Of course I have received many letters, but on the whole I was led to consider yours most favorably. I have made inquiries about you in the neighborhood, and the answers have been satisfactory. You have no children of your own?’  “‘No, sir.’  “‘All the better. You would be able to give more attention to this child.’  “‘Is it yours, sir?’ I asked  “‘Ye-es,’ he answered, with hesitation. ‘Circumstances,’ he continued, ‘circumstances which I need not state, compel me to separate from it. Five hundred dollars a year will be paid for its maintenance.’  “Five hundred dollars! I heard this with joy, for it was considerably more than my husband was able to earn since his accident. It would make us comfortable at once, and your father might work when he pleased, without feeling any anxiety about our coming to want.  “‘Will that sum be satisfactory?’ asked the stranger.  “‘It is very liberal,’ I answered.  “‘I intended it to be so,’ he said. ‘Since there is no difficulty on this score, I am inclined to trust you with the care of the child. But I must make two conditions.’  “‘What are they, sir?’  “‘In the first place, you must not try to find out the friends of the child. They do not desire to be known. Another thing, you must move from Brooklyn.’  “‘Move from Brooklyn?’ I repeated.  “‘Yes,’ he answered, firmly. ‘I do not think it necessary to give you a reason for this condition. Enough that it is imperative. If you decline, our negotiations are at an end.’  “I looked at my husband. He seemed as much surprised as I was.  “‘Perhaps you will wish to consult together,’ suggested our visitor. ‘If so, I can give you twenty minutes. I will remain in this room while you go out and talk it over.’  “We acted on this hint, and went into the kitchen. We decided that though we should prefer to live in Brooklyn, it would be worth our while to make the sacrifice for the sake of the addition to our income. We came in at the end of ten minutes, and announced our decision. Our visitor seemed to be very much pleased.  “‘Where would you wish us to move?’ asked your father.  “‘I do not care to designate any particular place. I should prefer some small country town, from fifty to a hundred miles distant. I suppose you will be able to move soon?’  “‘Yes, sir; we will make it a point to do so. How soon will the child be placed in our hands? Shall we send for it?’  “‘No, no,’ he said, hastily. ‘I cannot tell you exactly when, but it will be brought here probably in the course of a day or two. I myself shall bring it, and if at that time you wish to say anything additional you can do so.’  “He went away, leaving us surprised and somewhat excited at the change that was to take place in our lives. The next evening the sound of wheels was heard, and a hack stopped at our gate. The same gentleman descended hurriedly with a child in his arms--you were the child, Frank--and entered the house.  “‘This is the child,’ he said, placing it in my arms, ‘and here is the first quarterly installment of your pay. Three months hence you will receive the same sum from my agent in New York. Here is his address,’ and he placed a card in my hands. ‘Have you anything to ask?’  “‘Suppose I wish to communicate with you respecting the child? Suppose he is sick?’  “‘Then write to A. M., care of Giles Warner, No. ---- Nassau Street. By the way, it will be necessary for you to send him your postoffice address after your removal in order that he may send you your quarterly dues.’  “With this he left us, entered the hack, and drove off. I have never seen him since.”    CHAPTER III  LEFT ALONE  Frank listened to this revelation with wonder. For the first time in his life he asked himself, “Who am I?”  “How came I by my name, mother?” he asked.  “I must tell you. After the sudden departure of the gentleman who brought you, we happened to think that we had not asked your name. We accordingly wrote to the address which had been given us, making the inquiry. In return we received a slip of paper containing these words: ‘The name is immaterial; give him any name you please. A. M.’”  “You gave me the name of Frank.”  “It was Mr. Fowler’s name. We should have given it to you had you been our own boy; as the choice was left to us, we selected that.”  “It suits me as well as any other. How soon did you leave Brooklyn, mother?”  “In a week we had made all arrangements, and removed to this place. It is a small place, but it furnished as much work as my husband felt able to do. With the help of the allowance for your support, we not only got on comfortably, but saved up a hundred and fifty dollars annually, which we deposited in a savings bank. But after five years the money stopped coming. It was the year 1857, the year of the great panic, and among others who failed was Giles Warner’s agent, from whom we received our payments. Mr. Fowler went to New York to inquire about it, but only learned that Mr. Warner, weighed down by his troubles, had committed suicide, leaving no clew to the name of the man who left you with us.”  “How long ago was that, mother?”  “Seven years ago nearly eight.”  “And you continued to keep me, though the payments stopped.”  “Certainly; you were as dear to us as our own child--for we now had a child of our own--Grace. We should as soon have thought of casting off her as you.”  “But you must have been poor, mother.”  “We were economical, and we got along till your father died three years ago. Since then it has been hard work.”  “You have had a hard time, mother.”  “No harder on your account. You have been a great comfort to me, Frank. I am only anxious for the future. I fear you and Grace will suffer after I am gone.”  “Don’t fear, mother, I am young and strong; I am not afraid to face the world with God’s help.”  “What are you thinking of, Frank?” asked Mrs. Fowler, noticing the boy’s fixed look.  “Mother,” he said, earnestly, “I mean to seek for that man you have told me of. I want to find out who I am. Do you think he was my father?”  “He said he was, but I do not believe it. He spoke with hesitation, and said this to deceive us, probably.”  “I am glad you think so, I would not like to think him my father. From what you have told me of him I am sure I would not like him.”  “He must be nearly fifty now--dark complexion, with dark hair and whiskers. I am afraid that description will not help you any. There are many men who look like that. I should know him by his expression, but I cannot describe that to you.”  Here Mrs. Fowler was seized with a very severe fit of coughing, and Frank begged her to say no more.  Two days later, and Mrs. Fowler was no better. She was rapidly failing, and no hope was entertained that she would rally. She herself felt that death was near at hand and told Frank so, but he found it"]]]
