The overcoats were left for subsequent effort, for the first thing was to get some wood and water and cook breakfast.{31}  The morning was bitter cold and the sky overcast, but Si felt that this was a thousand times better than the cheerless rain, which seemed to soak his very life out of him.  He pounded most of the frozen mud off his shoes, picked up the camp-kettle, and started off for wood and water, broke the ice on the creek, took a good wash, and presently came back with a load of dry pine and a kettle full of water.  \"My joints feel like I think an old wagon does after it's gone about a year without greasing,\" he remarked to Shorty, who had a good fire going; \"but I think that after I get about a quart o' hot coffee, inside of me, with a few pounds o' pork and crackers, I'll be nearly as good as new again. My, how good that grub does smell! An' did you ever see such a nice fire?\"  He chopped his and Shorty's overcoats out while Shorty was cooking breakfast, and when at last he sat down on one end of his rail and ate enough toasted hard bread and crisp fried side-meat to feed a small family for a week, washing it down with something near a quart of black coffee sweetened with coarse brown sugar, life began again to have some charms for him.  \"You're sure that dumbed battery's gone that shot at us last night, are you, Shorty?\" he said, as he drained his cup, fastened it again to the strap of his haversack, and studied the top of the hill with a critical eye.  \"They say it is,\" said Shorty, between bites. \"While you was down at the crick a man come over from the camp o' the Oshkosh Terrors, and said two o' their{32} companies 'd been onto the hill, and the rebels had gone.\"  \"I wish them Oshkosh fellers'd mind their own business,\" said Si, irritably, as he picked up his gun and began rubbing the mud and rust off. \"They're entirely too fresh for a new regiment. That battery was none of theirs. It was ours, right in our front, an' if they'd let it alone till after breakfast we'd gone up and taken it. It was just the right size for the 200th Ind., and we wanted a chance at it. But now they've had to stick in and run it off.\"  \"Don't worry,\" said Shorty, fishing out another cracker; \"it hasn't gone too far. 'Taint lost. You'll have a chance at it some other time. Mebbe to-day yet.\"  The army began to move out very promptly, and soon the 200th Ind. was called to take its place in the long column that crawled over the hills and across the valleys toward Murfreesboro, like some gigantic blue serpent moving toward his prey.  Miles ahead of the 200th Ind.'s place in the column the rebels were offering annoying disputation of farther progress. Lines as brown as the dried leaves on the oak trees would form on the hilltops, batteries would gallop into position, and there would be sharp bangs by the cannon and a sputter of musketry-fire.  Then the long, blue serpent would wriggle out of the road into the fields, as if coiling to strike. Union batteries would rush on to hilltops and fire across valleys at the rebel cannon, and a sputter of musketry would answer that from the leaf-brown ranks on the hilltops, which would dissolve and march back{33} to the next hilltop, where the thing would be gone over again. The 200th Ind. would occasionally see one of these performances as it marched over and down one of the hills.  As the afternoon was wearing away the 200th{34} Ind. kept nearing the front, where this was going on. Finally, when the dull day was shading into dusk, and the brigade ahead of it was forming in the field at the foot of a hill to open a bickering fire against the dun line at the top, the 200th Ind. was taken off the road and marched away over to the left, where it was put into line in front of a dense grove of cedars.  \"Capt. McGillicuddy,\" commanded the Colonel to the Captain of Co. Q, \"advance your company as skirmishers to the edge of the cedars, and send a Corporal and five men into the thicket to see if there is anything there.\"  \"Corporal Klegg,\" said the Captain, \"take five men off the left of the company and go in and see what's in there.\"  Si was instantly fired with the importance of the duty assigned him. He sent two of his men to the left, two to the right, while he and Shorty, a little distance apart, struck for the heart of the thicket. They made their way with difficulty through the dense chaparral for some minute's, and then stopped, as they heard voices and the crashing of branches in front.  Si's heart thumped against his ribs. He looked over to his left, and saw Shorty standing there peering earnestly into the brush, with his gun cocked and ready to fire. He ran over to him and whispered:  \"What do you see, Shorty?\"  [Illustration: WHAT DO YOU SEE, SHORTY?' 33]  \"Nothin' yit, but I expect to every minute,\" replied Shorty, without turning his intent eyes. Si's gun was already cocked, and he bent his head {35}forward eagerly, to get a better view. But he could see nothing, except that the tops of the bushes were shaking.  \"Shall we skip back an' report?\" asked Si.  \"I ain't goin' till I see something,\" said Shorty, stoutly.  \"Nor me,\" echoed Si, rather ashamed that he had suggested it.  \"Steady, there; steady, on the right! Come for ward with that left company,\" called out a stern voice in front.  \"Must be a full regiment in there,\" whispered Si, craning his neck still farther. The tramping and crashing increased.  \"Steady, men, I tell you! Steady! Press on the center,\" commanded the unseen Colonel. \"Forward! Forward!\"  In spite of his perturbation, Si noticed that the sounds did not seem to be coming any nearer.  \"We must get a squint at 'em,\" he said, desperately, to Shorty. \"Let's git down an' crawl forward. There must be an openin' somewhere.\"  They got down on their hands and knees, so as to avoid as many as possible of the thickly-interlaced branches. Soon they came to a rift which led to an opening of some rods in circumference. Raising their heads cautiously above a moss-covered log, they saw in the opening a stalwart Sergeant with five or six men. The Sergeant was standing there with his eyes fixed on the tops of the trees, apparently thinking of the next series of commands he was to give, while the men were busy breaking limbs off the cedars.  Si and Shorty immediately grasped the situation.{36}  \"Forward, Co. Q!\" yelled Si at the top of his lungs. \"Surrender, you consarned rebels, or we'll blow your heads off,\" he added, as he and Shorty jumped forward into the opening and leveled their guns on the squad.  \"What'n thunder was you fellers makin' all that racket fur,\" Si asked the Sergeant as he was marching him back to the skirmish-line.  \"Ouah Cunnel,\" explained the Sergeant, \"wuz afeared you'ns 'd try to flank us through the thicket, and sent me down to make a rumpus and hold you back while he fit you in front. But whar's your company?\"  \"We'll come to it soon,\" said Si.    CHAPTER III. STILL ON THE MARCH  SI AND SHORTY STOP ON THE WAY LONG ENOUGH TO BAG SIX REBS.  SI CALLED out to the other boys by name to come up and join him.  The rebel Sergeant mentally tallied off each name as it was called. A flush of shame and anger mounted to his face as Si concluded.  \"Gol darn hit,\" he said, \"you'uns hain't got ez many ez we'uns; they hain't nigh ez good men ez we'uns, an' they'uns ain't heah. We'uns air Tennesseans, an' you'uns hain't.\"  \"We've got enough, an' they're good enough,\" said Si sententiously. \"Injianny turns out better men than Tennessee ever dreamed o' doing.\"  \"I don't believe hit a mite,\" said the Sergeant, stooping down and picking up a piece of cedar, which made a formidable club. \"We'uns is not a-gwine back with yo'uns nary a step. By rights, we'uns orter take yo'uns back with we'uns. But I'm willin' to call hit off, and let yo'uns go ef yo'uns 'll let we'uns go. Is hit a bargain?\"  \"Not by 40 rows o' apple trees it ain't,\" said Si, stepping back a little to get a better range, and fixing his bayonet. \"I've set my heart on takin' you back to Co. Q, an' back to Co. Q you'll go, if Si Klegg knows himself.\"{38}  \"And you'll go in a hurry, too,\" said Shorty. \"It's gettin' late, and I'm always afraid to be out after dark. Mosey, now!\"  The other rebels were picking up clubs similar to the Sergeant's and casting their eyes on him for the signal to attack.  \"See here,\" said Si desperately, cocking his gun. \"Don't waste no more time in words. This hain't a debatin' society. You're goin' back to Co. Q or going somewhere else thunderin' quick. Sergeant, if you make a move agin me I'll surely blow your head off en you, an' jab my bayonet through the next man. My partner, Shorty, is a worse man than I am, an' I can't tell how many of you he'll kill. He's awful quick-tempered, too, towards evening, an' liable to begin shooting any minute without warnin'. It'll save several lives if you start right off on the jump, straight toward the rear, an' keep it up, with out looking to the right or left, until you reach Co. Q. You'll find the trail we made comin' in. Take it this minute.\"  The rebel Sergeant's eyes looked directly into the dark muzzle of Si's gun. They glanced along the barrel, and met one eye looking directly through the sights, while the other was closed, in the act of taking deliberate aim. He decided with great promptness that there were many reasons why he should prefer to be a live rebel in a Yankee prison, rather than a badly-disfigured dead one in a lonely cedar thicket. He dropped his club, turned around, and made his way along the path over which Si had come. The rest followed, with Si and Shorty a few paces in the rear.  Palpitating with pride, Si marched his prisoners up to the company, who gave him three cheers. The Captain ordered him to report with his prisoners to the Colonel.  [Illustration: SI REPORTS TO THE COLONEL 38]  The Colonel praised him with"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31773"],["title","Si Klegg, Book 3 (#1)"],["body","that the rebels was there yet. Jim Jones, of the secret service, had agreed to come out this afternoon and wave a flag if it was all{22} right. I was waiting for his sign. But he is probably drunk. He always gets so when he reaches camp.\"  The Deacon joined them in the road, and gave a searching glance at the prisoner.  \"Ain't you a Jew?\" he inquired presently. \"Ain't your name Rosenbaum? Didn't you go through Posey County, Ind., a year or two ago, with a wagon, sellin' packs o' cloth to the farmers?\"  \"I'm an American citizen,\" said the man proudly, \"the same as the rest of you. My religion is Hebrew. I don't know and don't care what your religion is. Every man has the religion that suits him. My name is Rosenbaum. I did sell cloth in Posey County, unt all over Indianny. It was good cloth, too, unt I sold it at a bargain.\"  \"It certainly was good cloth, and cheap,\" admitted the Deacon. \"What in the world are you doin' down here in them clothes?\"  \"I'm doing just what these men are doing here in their cloze,\" answered Rosenbaum. \"I'm trying to serve the country. I'm doing it different from them, because I'm built different from them. I hope I'm doing it well. But I'm awfully hungry. Got anything to eat? Just a cup of coffee and a cracker? Don't care for any pork.\"  \"Yes, we'll give you something to eat,\" said Shorty. \"I think there's some of our chicken left. You'll find that good.\"  \"How did you cook that?\" said Rosenbaum, looking at the tempting morsel suspiciously.  Shorty explained.{23}  \"Thanks; I can't eat it,\" said Rosenbaum with a sigh. \"It ain't kosher.\"  \"What the devil's that?\" asked Shorty.  \"It's my religion. I can't explain. Send for the Officer of the Guard to take me to Headquarters,\" answered Rosenbaum, sipping his coffee.    CHAPTER II. ROSENBAUM, THE SPY  THE JEW TELLS THE THRILLING STORY OF HIS ADVENTURE.  THE Officer of the Guard was a long time in coming, and Mr. Rosenbaum grew quite chatty and communicative, as they sat around the bright fire of cedar logs and smoked.  \"Yes,\" he said, \"I have been in the secret service ever since the beginning of the war--in fact, before the war, for I began getting news for Frank Blair in the Winter before the war. They say Jews have no patriotism. That's a lie. Why should they have no patriotism for countries where they were treated like dogs? In Germany, where I was born, they treated us worse than dogs. They made us live in a little, nasty, pig-pen of an alley; we had to go in at sundown, unt stay there; we had to wear a different cloze from other folks, unt we didn't dare to say our souls were our own to any dirty loafer that insulted us.  \"Here we are treated like men, unt why shouldn't we help to keep the country from breaking up? Jews ought to do more than anybody else, unt I made up my mind from the very first that I was going to do all that I could. The Generals have told me that I could do much better for the country in the secret service than as a soldier; they could get plenty of soldiers unt but few spies.\"{25}  \"Now you're shoutin',\" said Shorty. \"They kin git me to soldier as long as the war lasts, for the askin', but I wouldn't be a spy 10 minutes for a corn-basket full o' greenbacks. I have too much regard for my neck. I need it in my business.\"  \"You a spy,\" said Si derisively. \"You couldn't spy for sour apples. Them big feet o' your'n 'd give you dead away to anybody that'd ever seen you before.\"  \"Spyin' isn't the business that any straightfor'rd man,\"--the Deacon began to say in tones of cold disapproval, and then he bethought him of courtesy to the stranger, and changed hastily--\"that I'd like to do. It's entirely too resky.\"  \"O, it's jest as honorable as anything else. Pap,\" said Si, divining his father's thought. \"All's fair in love and war. We couldn't git along without spies. They're as necessary as muskets and cannon.\"  \"Indeed they are,\" said Mr. Rosenbaum earnestly; \"you wouldn't know what to do with your muskets and cannon if the spies didn't tell you where the rebels were, unt how many there was of them. I go out unt get information that it would cost hundreds of lives to get, unt may save thousands of lives, unt all that it costs is one poor little Jew's neck, when they drop on to him some day, unt leave him swinging from a tree. But when that time comes, I shall make no more complaint than these other poor boys do, who get their heads knockt off in battle. I'm no better than they are. My life belongs to the country the same as theirs, unt this free Government is worth all our lives, unt more, too.\"  His simple, sincere patriotism touched the Deacon{26} deeply. \"I'd no idee that there was so much o' the man in a Jew,\" he said to himself. Then he asked the stranger:  \"How did you come to go into the spy business, Mr. Rosenbaum?\"  \"Well, I was in St. Louis in the Clothing pizniss, unt you know it was purty hot there. All the Germans were for the Union, unt most of the Americans unt Irish seemed to be Secessionists. I sided with the Germans, but as nobody seemed to think that a Jew had any principles or cared for anything but the almighty dollar, everybody talked right out before me, unt by keepin' my ears wide open I got hold of lots of news, which I took straight to General Lyon. I got well acquainted with him, and he used to send me here and there to find out things for him. I'd sell gray uniforms and other things to the Secessionists; they'd talk to one another right before me as to what was being done, and I'd keep my ears wide open all the time, though seemed to be only thinking about the fit and the buttons and the gold lace.  \"Then General Lyon wanted to find out just exactly how many men there was in Camp Jackson--no guesswork--no suppose. I took 2,000 of my business cards, printed on white, and 1,000 printed on gray paper. I went through the whole camp. To every man in uniform I give a white card; to every man without a uniform, who seemed to be there for earnest, I give a gray card. When I got back I counted my cards in General Lyon's office, unt found I'd give out 500 white cards unt 200 gray{27} ones. Then General Lyon took out about 3,000 men, unt brought the whole crowd back with him.\"  \"Then General Lyon,\" continued Rosenbaum, \"sent me out from Springfield, Mizzouri, to see how many men old Pap Price unt Ben McCullough had gathered up against him from Mizzouri, Arkansaw, Texas unt the plains. Holy Moses, I was scared when I saw the pile of them. The whole world seemed to be out there, yipping unt yelling for Jeff Davis, drinking raw sod-corn whisky, making secession speeches, unt shooting at marks.  \"I rode right into them, unt pretended that I was looking for Mexican silver dollars to take to Mexico to buy powder unt lead for the rebel army. I had a lot of new Confedrit notes that I'd got from my cousin, who was in the tobacco business in Memphis. They was great curiosities, unt every man who had a Mexican dollar wanted to trade it for a Confedrit dollar.  \"There was no use tryin' to count the men--might as well have tried to count the leaves on the trees, so I begun to count the regiments. I stuck a pin in my right lapel for every Mizzouri regiment, one in my left lapel for every Arkansaw regiment, one in my vest for every one from Texas. I had black pins for the cannons. I was getting along very well, when I run across Bob Smiles, a dirty loafer, who had been a customer in St. Louis. He wouldn't pay me, unt I had to get out a writ unt levy on his clothes just as he was dressing to go to a quadroon ball.  \"I left him with only a necktie, which was worth nothing to me, as it had been worn and soiled. He was very sore against me, unt I was not surprised.{28}  \"It made me sick at my stomach when I saw him come up.  \"'Hello, you damn Dutch Jew,' he said. 'What are you doing here?'  \"I tried to be very pleasant, unt I put out my hand unt said, with my best smile:  \"'Good gracious. Bob, how glad I am to see you. When did you get here? Are you well? How are the other boys? Who's here? Where are you stopping?'  \"But I might as well have tried to make friends with a bull dog in front of a farm house where all the people had gone away.  \"'Go to blazes,' he said. 'None of your bizniss how I am, how I got here, or how the other boys are. Better not let them find out you're here. They'll take it out of your Jew hide for the way you used to skin them in St. Louis. I want to know what the devil you are doing here?'  \"'Now, Mister Smiles,' I said, pleasant as a May morning, 'that's not the way to talk to me. You know I got up the stylishest clothes unt the best fits in St. Louis. We had a little trouble, it is true. It was nothing, though. Just a little business dispute. You know I always thought you one of the very nicest men in St. Louis, unt I said so, even to the Squire unt to the Constable.'  \"'Go to the devil, you Savior-killing Jew,' said he. 'Shut up your mouth, or I'll stuff a piece of pork in it. I want to know at once what you are doing here? Where did you come from?'  \"'I come from Memphis,' said I. 'I'm in the service of the Southern Confedrisy. General Pillow sent{29} me to gather up all the Mexican dollars I could find, to send to Mexico to buy ammunition.'  \"'It's a lie, of course,' said he. 'A Jew'd rather lie than eat, any day. Then you're one of them St. Louis Dutch--them imported Hessians. They're all dead against us. They all ought to be killed. I ought to kill you myself for being so cussed mean to me.'  \"He put his hand on his revolver in a way that made my breakfast sour in my stomach, but then I knew that Bob Smiles was a great blowhard, unt his bark was much worse than his bite. In St. Louis he was always going to fight somebody unt kill somebody, but he never done neither. Quite a crowd gathered around, unt Bob blew off to them, unt they yelled, 'Hang the Jew spy. Kill the damn rascal,' and other things that made me unhappy. But what made my flesh crawl was to see a man who wasn't saying"]]]
