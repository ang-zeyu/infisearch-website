Beyond, among the undulating hills, was a marvelous array of lakes. There must have been thirty or forty of them, from the pond of an acre to the wide sheet two or three miles across. The strangely elongated and rounded hills had the appearance of giants in bed, wrapped in many-colored blankets, while the lakes were their deep, blue eyes, lashed with dark evergreens, gazing steadfastly heavenward. Look long at these recumbent forms and you will see the heaving of their breasts.  The whole landscape was alert, expectant of glory. Around this great camp of prostrate Cyclops there stood an unbroken semicircle of mighty peaks in solemn grandeur, some hoary-headed, some with locks of brown, but all wearing white glacier collars. The taller peaks seemed almost sharp enough to be the helmets and spears of watchful sentinels. And the colors! Great stretches of crimson fireweed, acres and acres of them, smaller patches of dark blue lupins, and hills of shaded yellow, red, and brown, the many-shaded green of the woods, the amethyst and purple of the far horizon--who can tell it? We did not stand there more than two or three minutes, but the whole wonderful scene is deeply etched on the tablet of my memory, a photogravure never to be effaced.      THE RESCUE     THE MOUNTAIN'S FAITH    At eventide, upon a dreary sea,  I watched a mountain rear its hoary head  To look with steady gaze in the near heaven.  The earth was cold and still. No sound was heard  But the dream-voices of the sleeping sea.  The mountain drew its gray cloud-mantle close,  Like Roman senator, erect and old,  Raising aloft an earnest brow and calm,  With upward look intent of steadfast faith.  The sky was dim; no glory-light shone forth  To crown the mountain's faith; which faltered not,  But, ever hopeful, waited patiently.   At morn I looked again. Expectance sat  Of immanent glory on the mountain's brow.  And, in a moment, lo! the glory _came!_  An angel's hand rolled back a crimson cloud.  Deep, rose-red light of wondrous tone and power--  A crown of matchless splendor--graced its head,  Majestic, kingly, pure as Heaven, yet warm  With earthward love. A motion, like a heart  With rich blood beating, seemed to sway and pulse,  With might of ecstasy, the granite peak.  A poem grand it was of Love Divine--  An anthem, sweet and strong, of praise to God--  A victory-peal from barren fields of death.  Its gaze was heavenward still, but earthward too--  For Love seeks not her own, and joy is full,  Only when freest given. The sun shone forth,  And now the mountain doffed its ruby crown  For one of diamonds. Still the light streamed down;  No longer chill and bleak, the morning glowed  With warmth and light, and clouds of fiery hue  Mantled the crystal glacier's chilly stream,  And all the landscape throbbed with sudden joy.     II  THE RESCUE   Muir was the first to awake from his trance. Like Schiller's king in \"The Diver,\" \"Nothing could slake his wild thirst of desire.\"  \"The sunset,\" he cried; \"we must have the whole horizon.\"  Then he started running along the ledge like a mountain goat, working to get around the vertical cliff above us to find an ascent on the other side. He was soon out of sight, although I followed as fast as I could. I heard him shout something, but could not make out his words. I know now he was warning me of a dangerous place. Then I came to a sharp-cut fissure which lay across my path--a gash in the rock, as if one of the Cyclops had struck it with his axe. It sloped very steeply for some twelve feet below, opening on the face of the precipice above the glacier, and was filled to within about four feet of the surface with flat, slaty gravel. It was only four or five feet across, and I could easily have leaped it had I not been so tired. But a rock the size of my head projected from the slippery stream of gravel. In my haste to overtake Muir I did not stop to make sure this stone was part of the cliff, but stepped with springing force upon it to cross the fissure. Instantly the stone melted away beneath my feet, and I shot with it down towards the precipice. With my peril sharp upon me I cried out as I whirled on my face, and struck out both hands to grasp the rock on either side.  Falling forward hard, my hands struck the walls of the chasm, my arms were twisted behind me, and instantly both shoulders were dislocated. With my paralyzed arms flopping helplessly above my head, I slid swiftly down the narrow chasm. Instinctively I flattened down on the sliding gravel, digging my chin and toes into it to check my descent; but not until my feet hung out over the edge of the cliff did I feel that I had stopped. Even then I dared not breathe or stir, so precarious was my hold on that treacherous shale. Every moment I seemed to be slipping inch by inch to the point when all would give way and I would go whirling down to the glacier.  After the first wild moment of panic when I felt myself falling, I do not remember any sense of fear. But I know what it is to have a thousand thoughts flash through the brain in a single instant--an anguished thought of my young wife at Wrangell, with her immanent motherhood; an indignant thought of the insurance companies that refused me policies on my life; a thought of wonder as to what would become of my poor flocks of Indians among the islands; recollections of events far and near in time, important and trivial; but each thought printed upon my memory by the instantaneous photography of deadly peril. I had no hope of escape at all. The gravel was rattling past me and piling up against my head. The jar of a little rock, and all would be over. The situation was too desperate for actual fear. Dull wonder as to how long I would be in the air, and the hope that death would be instant--that was all. Then came the wish that Muir would come before I fell, and take a message to my wife.  [Illustration: ONE OF THE MARVELOUS ARRAY OF LAKES]  Suddenly I heard his voice right above me. \"My God!\" he cried. Then he added, \"Grab that rock, man, just by your right hand.\"  I gurgled from my throat, not daring to inflate my lungs, \"My arms are out.\"  There was a pause. Then his voice rang again, cheery, confident, unexcited, \"Hold fast; I'm going to get you out of this. I can't get to you on this side; the rock is sheer. I'll have to leave you now and cross the rift high up and come down to you on the other side by which we came. Keep cool.\"  Then I heard him going away, whistling \"The Blue Bells of Scotland,\" singing snatches of Scotch songs, calling to me, his voice now receding, as the rocks intervened, then sounding louder as he came out on the face of the cliff. But in me hope surged at full tide. I entertained no more thoughts of last messages. I did not see how he could possibly do it, but he was John Muir, and I had seen his wonderful rock-work. So I determined not to fall and made myself as flat and heavy as possible, not daring to twitch a muscle or wink an eyelid, for I still felt myself slipping, slipping down the greasy slate. And now a new peril threatened. A chill ran through me of cold and nervousness, and I slid an inch. I suppressed the growing shivers with all my will. I would keep perfectly quiet till Muir came back. The sickening pain in my shoulders increased till it was torture, and I could not ease it.  It seemed like hours, but it was really only about ten minutes before he got back to me. By that time I hung so far over the edge of the precipice that it seemed impossible that I could last another second. Now I heard Muir's voice, low and steady, close to me, and it seemed a little below.  \"Hold steady,\" he said. \"I'll have to swing you out over the cliff.\"  Then I felt a careful hand on my back, fumbling with the waistband of my pants, my vest and shirt, gathering all in a firm grip. I could see only with one eye and that looked upon but a foot or two of gravel on the other side.  \"Now!\" he said, and I slid out of the cleft with a rattling shower of stones and gravel. My head swung down, my impotent arms dangling, and I stared straight at the glacier, a thousand feet below. Then my feet came against the cliff.  \"Work downwards with your feet.\"  I obeyed. He drew me close to him by crooking his arm and as my head came up past his level he caught me by my collar with his teeth! My feet struck the little two-inch shelf on which he was standing, and I could see Muir, flattened against the face of the rock and facing it, his right hand stretched up and clasping a little spur, his left holding me with an iron grip, his head bent sideways, as my weight drew it. I felt as alert and cool as he.  \"I've got to let go of you,\" he hissed through his clenched teeth. \"I need both hands here. Climb upward with your feet.\"  How he did it, I know not. The miracle grows as I ponder it. The wall was almost perpendicular and smooth. My weight on his jaws dragged him outwards. And yet, holding me by his teeth as a panther her cub and clinging like a squirrel to a tree, he climbed with me straight up ten or twelve feet, with only the help of my iron-shod feet scrambling on the rock. It was utterly impossible, yet he did it!  When he landed me on the little shelf along which we had come, my nerve gave way and I trembled all over. I sank down exhausted, Muir only less tired, but supporting me.  The sun had set; the air was icy cold and we had no coats. We would soon chill through. Muir's task of rescue had only begun and no time was to be lost. In a minute he was up again, examining my shoulders. The right one had an upward dislocation, the ball of the humerus resting on the process of the scapula, the rim of the cup. I told him how, and he soon snapped the bone into its socket. But the left was a harder proposition. The luxation was downward and forward, and the strong, nervous reaction of "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/307"],["title","Three Elephant Power, and Other Stories (#1)"],["body","alongside in one jump. And then he keeps there just half a length ahead of him, tormentin' him like. And the owner of the French car he yells out to old John Bull, 'You're going a nice pace for an old 'un,' he says. Old John has a blink down at the indicator. 'We're doing twenty-five,' he yells out. 'Twenty-five grandmothers,' says the bloke; but Henery he put on his accelerator, and left him. It wouldn't do to let the old man get wise to it, you know.”  We topped a big hill, and Alfred cut off the engine and let the car swoop, as swiftly and noiselessly as an eagle, down to the flat country below.  “You're a long while coming to the elephant, Alfred,” I said.  “Well, now, I'll tell you about the elephant,” said Alfred, letting his clutch in again, and taking up the story to the accompaniment of the rhythmic throb of the engine.  “One day Henery and the old man were going out a long trip over the mountain, and down the Kangaroo Valley Road that's all cut out of the side of the 'ill. And after they's gone a mile or two, Henery sees a track in the road--the track of the biggest car he ever seen or 'eard of. An' the more he looks at it, the more he reckons he must ketch that car and see what she's made of. So he slows down passin' two yokels on the road, and he says, 'Did you see a big car along 'ere?'  “'Yes, we did,' they says.  “'How big is she?' says Henery.  “'Biggest car ever we see,' says the yokels, and they laughed that silly way these yokels always does.  “'How many horse-power do you think she was?' says Henery.  “'Horse-power,' they says; 'elephant-power, you mean! She was three elephant-power,' they says; and they goes 'Haw, haw!' and Henery drops his clutch in, and off he goes after that car.”  Alfred lit another cigarette as a preliminary to the climax.  “So they run for miles, and all the time there's the track ahead of 'em, and Henery keeps lettin' her out, thinkin' that he'll never ketch that car. They went through a town so fast, the old man he says, 'What house was that we just passed,' he says. At last they come to the top of the big 'ill, and there's the tracks of the big car goin' straight down ahead of 'em.  “D'you know that road? It's all cut out of the side of the mountain, and there's places where if she was to side-slip you'd go down 'undreds of thousands of feet. And there's sharp turns, too; but the surface is good, so Henery he lets her out, and down they go, whizzin' round the turns and skatin' out near the edge, and the old cove sittin' there enjoyin' it, never knowin' the danger. And comin' to one turn Henery gives a toot on the 'orn, and then he heard somethin' go 'toot, toot' right away down the mountain.  “'Bout a mile ahead it seemed to be, and Henery reckoned he'd go another four miles before he'd ketch it, so he chances them turns more than ever. And she was pretty hot, too; but he kept her at it, and he hadn't gone a full mile till he come round a turn about forty miles an hour, and before he could stop he run right into it, and wot do you think it was?”  I hadn't the faintest idea.  “A circus. One of them travellin' circuses, goin' down the coast; and one of the elephants had sore feet, so they put him in a big waggon, and another elephant pulled in front and one pushed behind. Three elephant-power it was, right enough. That was the waggon wot made the big track. Well, it was all done so sudden. Before Henery could stop, he runs the radiator--very near boiling she was--up against the elephant's tail, and prints the pattern of the latest honeycomb radiator on the elephant as clear as if you done it with a stencil.  “The elephant, he lets a roar out of him like one of them bulls bellerin', and he puts out his nose and ketches Henery round the neck, and yanks him out of the car, and chucks him right clean over the cliff, 'bout a thousand feet. But he never done nothin' to the old bloke.”  “Good gracious!”  “Well, it finished Henery, killed him stone dead, of course, and the old man he was terrible cut up over losin' such a steady, trustworthy man. 'Never get another like him,' he says.”  We were nearly at our journey's end, and we turned through a gate into the home paddocks. Some young stock, both horses and cattle, came frisking and cantering after the car, and the rough bush track took all Alfred's attention. We crossed a creek, the water swishing from the wheels, and began the long pull up to the homestead. Over the clamour of the little-used second speed, Alfred concluded his narrative.  “The old bloke advertised,” he said, “for another driver, a steady, reliable man to drive a twenty horse-power, four-cylinder touring car. Every driver in Sydney put in for it. Nothing like a fast car to fetch 'em, you know. And Scotty got it. Him wot used to drive the Napier I was tellin' you about.”  “And what did the old man say when he found he'd been running a racing car?”  “He don't know now. Scotty never told 'im. Why should he? He's drivin' about the country now, the boss of the roads, but he won't chance her near a circus. Thinks he might bump the same elephant. And that elephant, every time he smells a car passin' in the road, he goes near mad with fright. If he ever sees that car again, do you think he'd know it?”  Not being used to elephants, I could not offer an opinion.     THE ORACLE   No tram ever goes to Randwick races without him; he is always fat, hairy, and assertive; he is generally one of a party, and takes the centre of the stage all the time--collects and hands over the fares, adjusts the change, chaffs the conductor, crushes the thin, apologetic stranger next him into a pulp, and talks to the whole compartment as if they had asked for his opinion.  He knows all the trainers and owners, or takes care to give the impression that he does. He slowly and pompously hauls out his race book, and one of his satellites opens the ball by saying, in a deferential way:  “What do you like for the 'urdles, Charley?”  The Oracle looks at the book and breathes heavily; no one else ventures to speak.  “Well,” he says, at last, “of course there's only one in it--if he's wanted. But that's it--will they spin him? I don't think they will. They's only a lot o' cuddies, any'ow.”  No one likes to expose his own ignorance by asking which horse he refers to as the “only one in it”; and the Oracle goes on to deal out some more wisdom in a loud voice.  “Billy K---- told me” (he probably hardly knows Billy K---- by sight) “Billy K---- told me that that bay 'orse ran the best mile-an'-a-half ever done on Randwick yesterday; but I don't give him a chance, for all that; that's the worst of these trainers. They don't know when their horses are well--half of 'em.”  Then a voice comes from behind him. It is that of the thin man, who is crushed out of sight by the bulk of the Oracle.  “I think,” says the thin man, “that that horse of Flannery's ought to run well in the Handicap.”  The Oracle can't stand this sort of thing at all. He gives a snort, wheels half-round and looks at the speaker. Then he turns back to the compartment full of people, and says: “No 'ope.”  The thin man makes a last effort. “Well, they backed him last night, anyhow.”  “Who backed 'im?” says the Oracle.  “In Tattersall's,” says the thin man.  “I'm sure,” says the Oracle; and the thin man collapses.  On arrival at the course, the Oracle is in great form. Attended by his string of satellites, he plods from stall to stall staring at the horses. Their names are printed in big letters on the stalls, but the Oracle doesn't let that stop his display of knowledge.  “'Ere's Blue Fire,” he says, stopping at that animal's stall, and swinging his race book. “Good old Blue Fire!” he goes on loudly, as a little court collects. “Jimmy B----” (mentioning a popular jockey) “told me he couldn't have lost on Saturday week if he had only been ridden different. I had a good stake on him, too, that day. Lor', the races that has been chucked away on this horse. They will not ride him right.”  A trainer who is standing by, civilly interposes. “This isn't Blue Fire,” he says. “Blue Fire's out walking about. This is a two-year-old filly that's in the stall----”  “Well, I can see that, can't I,” says the Oracle, crushingly. “You don't suppose I thought Blue Fire was a mare, did you?” and he moves off hurriedly.  “Now, look here, you chaps,” he says to his followers at last. “You wait here. I want to go and see a few of the talent, and it don't do to have a crowd with you. There's Jimmy M---- over there now” (pointing to a leading trainer). “I'll get hold of him in a minute. He couldn't tell me anything with so many about. Just you wait here.”  He crushes into a crowd that has gathered round the favourite's stall, and overhears one hard-faced racing man say to another, “What do you like?” to which the other answers, “Well, either this or Royal Scot. I think I'll put a bit on Royal Scot.” This is enough for the Oracle. He doesn't know either of the men from Adam, or either of the horses from the great original pachyderm, but the information will do to go on with. He rejoins his followers, and looks very mysterious.  “Well, did you hear anything?” they say.  The Oracle talks low and confidentially.  “The crowd that have got the favourite tell me they're not afraid of anything but Royal Scot,” he says. “I think we'd better put a bit on both.”  “What did the Royal Scot crowd say?” asks an admirer deferentially.  “Oh, they're going to try and win. I saw the stable commissioner, and he told me they were going to put a hundred on him. Of course, you needn't say I told you, 'cause I promised him I wouldn't tell.” And the satellites beam with admiration of the Oracle, and think what a privilege it is to go to the races with such a knowing man.  They contribute their mites to the general fund, some putting in a pound, others half a sovereign, and the Oracle takes it into the ring to invest, half on the favourite and half on Royal Scot. He finds that the"]]]
