A little noisy, maybe, but--\"  \"Oh, Mr. Burckhardt!\" The blue eyes were wide and admiring. \"I knew you'd understand. It's just that--well, it's such a _wonderful_ freezer that some of the outside men get carried away, so to speak. As soon as the main office found out about what happened, they sent representatives around to every house on the block to apologize. Your wife told us where we could phone you--and I'm so very pleased that you were willing to let me have lunch with you, so that I could apologize, too. Because truly, Mr. Burckhardt, it is a _fine_ freezer.  \"I shouldn't tell you this, but--\" the blue eyes were shyly lowered--\"I'd do almost anything for Feckle Freezers. It's more than a job to me.\" She looked up. She was enchanting. \"I bet you think I'm silly, don't you?\"  Burckhardt coughed. \"Well, I--\"  \"Oh, you don't want to be unkind!\" She shook her head. \"No, don't pretend. You think it's silly. But really, Mr. Burckhardt, you wouldn't think so if you knew more about the Feckle. Let me show you this little booklet--\"  Burckhardt got back from lunch a full hour late. It wasn't only the girl who delayed him. There had been a curious interview with a little man named Swanson, whom he barely knew, who had stopped him with desperate urgency on the street--and then left him cold.  But it didn't matter much. Mr. Barth, for the first time since Burckhardt had worked there, was out for the day--leaving Burckhardt stuck with the quarterly tax returns.  What did matter, though, was that somehow he had signed a purchase order for a twelve-cubic-foot Feckle Freezer, upright model, self-defrosting, list price $625, with a ten per cent \"courtesy\" discount--\"Because of that _horrid_ affair this morning, Mr. Burckhardt,\" she had said.  And he wasn't sure how he could explain it to his wife.         *       *       *       *       *  He needn't have worried. As he walked in the front door, his wife said almost immediately, \"I wonder if we can't afford a new freezer, dear. There was a man here to apologize about that noise and--well, we got to talking and--\"  She had signed a purchase order, too.  It had been the damnedest day, Burckhardt thought later, on his way up to bed. But the day wasn't done with him yet. At the head of the stairs, the weakened spring in the electric light switch refused to click at all. He snapped it back and forth angrily and, of course, succeeded in jarring the tumbler out of its pins. The wires shorted and every light in the house went out.  \"Damn!\" said Guy Burckhardt.  \"Fuse?\" His wife shrugged sleepily. \"Let it go till the morning, dear.\"  Burckhardt shook his head. \"You go back to bed. I'll be right along.\"  It wasn't so much that he cared about fixing the fuse, but he was too restless for sleep. He disconnected the bad switch with a screwdriver, stumbled down into the black kitchen, found the flashlight and climbed gingerly down the cellar stairs. He located a spare fuse, pushed an empty trunk over to the fuse box to stand on and twisted out the old fuse.  When the new one was in, he heard the starting click and steady drone of the refrigerator in the kitchen overhead.  He headed back to the steps, and stopped.  Where the old trunk had been, the cellar floor gleamed oddly bright. He inspected it in the flashlight beam. It was metal!  \"Son of a gun,\" said Guy Burckhardt. He shook his head unbelievingly. He peered closer, rubbed the edges of the metallic patch with his thumb and acquired an annoying cut--the edges were _sharp_.  The stained cement floor of the cellar was a thin shell. He found a hammer and cracked it off in a dozen spots--everywhere was metal.  The whole cellar was a copper box. Even the cement-brick walls were false fronts over a metal sheath!         *       *       *       *       *  Baffled, he attacked one of the foundation beams. That, at least, was real wood. The glass in the cellar windows was real glass.  He sucked his bleeding thumb and tried the base of the cellar stairs. Real wood. He chipped at the bricks under the oil burner. Real bricks. The retaining walls, the floor--they were faked.  It was as though someone had shored up the house with a frame of metal and then laboriously concealed the evidence.  The biggest surprise was the upside-down boat hull that blocked the rear half of the cellar, relic of a brief home workshop period that Burckhardt had gone through a couple of years before. From above, it looked perfectly normal. Inside, though, where there should have been thwarts and seats and lockers, there was a mere tangle of braces, rough and unfinished.  \"But I _built_ that!\" Burckhardt exclaimed, forgetting his thumb. He leaned against the hull dizzily, trying to think this thing through. For reasons beyond his comprehension, someone had taken his boat and his cellar away, maybe his whole house, and replaced them with a clever mock-up of the real thing.  \"That's crazy,\" he said to the empty cellar. He stared around in the light of the flash. He whispered, \"What in the name of Heaven would anybody do that for?\"  Reason refused an answer; there wasn't any reasonable answer. For long minutes, Burckhardt contemplated the uncertain picture of his own sanity.  He peered under the boat again, hoping to reassure himself that it was a mistake, just his imagination. But the sloppy, unfinished bracing was unchanged. He crawled under for a better look, feeling the rough wood incredulously. Utterly impossible!  He switched off the flashlight and started to wriggle out. But he didn't make it. In the moment between the command to his legs to move and the crawling out, he felt a sudden draining weariness flooding through him.  Consciousness went--not easily, but as though it were being taken away, and Guy Burckhardt was asleep.   III  On the morning of June 16th, Guy Burckhardt woke up in a cramped position huddled under the hull of the boat in his basement--and raced upstairs to find it was June 15th.  The first thing he had done was to make a frantic, hasty inspection of the boat hull, the faked cellar floor, the imitation stone. They were all as he had remembered them--all completely unbelievable.  The kitchen was its placid, unexciting self. The electric clock was purring soberly around the dial. Almost six o'clock, it said. His wife would be waking at any moment.  Burckhardt flung open the front door and stared out into the quiet street. The morning paper was tossed carelessly against the steps--and as he retrieved it, he noticed that this was the 15th day of June.  But that was impossible. _Yesterday_ was the 15th of June. It was not a date one would forget--it was quarterly tax-return day.  He went back into the hall and picked up the telephone; he dialed for Weather Information, and got a well-modulated chant: \"--and cooler, some showers. Barometric pressure thirty point zero four, rising ... United States Weather Bureau forecast for June 15th. Warm and sunny, with high around--\"  He hung the phone up. June 15th.  \"Holy heaven!\" Burckhardt said prayerfully. Things were very odd indeed. He heard the ring of his wife's alarm and bounded up the stairs.  Mary Burckhardt was sitting upright in bed with the terrified, uncomprehending stare of someone just waking out of a nightmare.  \"Oh!\" she gasped, as her husband came in the room. \"Darling, I just had the most _terrible_ dream! It was like an explosion and--\"  \"Again?\" Burckhardt asked, not very sympathetically. \"Mary, something's funny! I _knew_ there was something wrong all day yesterday and--\"  He went on to tell her about the copper box that was the cellar, and the odd mock-up someone had made of his boat. Mary looked astonished, then alarmed, then placatory and uneasy.  She said, \"Dear, are you _sure_? Because I was cleaning that old trunk out just last week and I didn't notice anything.\"  \"Positive!\" said Guy Burckhardt. \"I dragged it over to the wall to step on it to put a new fuse in after we blew the lights out and--\"  \"After we what?\" Mary was looking more than merely alarmed.  \"After we blew the lights out. You know, when the switch at the head of the stairs stuck. I went down to the cellar and--\"  Mary sat up in bed. \"Guy, the switch didn't stick. I turned out the lights myself last night.\"  Burckhardt glared at his wife. \"Now I _know_ you didn't! Come here and take a look!\"  He stalked out to the landing and dramatically pointed to the bad switch, the one that he had unscrewed and left hanging the night before....  Only it wasn't. It was as it had always been. Unbelieving, Burckhardt pressed it and the lights sprang up in both halls.         *       *       *       *       *  Mary, looking pale and worried, left him to go down to the kitchen and start breakfast. Burckhardt stood staring at the switch for a long time. His mental processes were gone beyond the point of disbelief and shock; they simply were not functioning.  He shaved and dressed and ate his breakfast in a state of numb introspection. Mary didn't disturb him; she was apprehensive and soothing. She kissed him good-by as he hurried out to the bus without another word.  Miss Mitkin, at the reception desk, greeted him with a yawn. \"Morning,\" she said drowsily. \"Mr. Barth won't be in today.\"  Burckhardt started to say something, but checked himself. She would not know that Barth hadn't been in yesterday, either, because she was tearing a June 14th pad off her calendar to make way for the \"new\" June 15th sheet.  He staggered to his own desk and stared unseeingly at the morning's mail. It had not even been opened yet, but he knew that the Factory Distributors envelope contained an order for twenty thousand feet of the new acoustic tile, and the one from Finebeck & Sons was a complaint.  After a long while, he forced himself to open them. They were.  By lunchtime, driven by a desperate sense of urgency, Burckhardt made Miss Mitkin take her lunch hour first--the June-fifteenth-that-was-yesterday, _he_ had gone first. She went,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31982"],["title","Dressed Game and Poultry à la Mode (#1)"],["body","half a pound of salt pork cut into thin strips. Cover closely and let them heat very slowly. Then stew for over an hour, if the fowls _are tender_; if not they may take from three to four hours. They must be cooked _very slowly_. When tender, add a chopped onion, a shalot, parsley, and pepper. Cover closely again, and when it has heated to boiling, stir in a teacupful of milk, to which have been added two beaten eggs and two tablespoonfuls of flour. Boil up and add an ounce of butter. Arrange the chickens neatly in an entrée dish, pour the gravy over and serve.   Fritôt of Chicken aux Tomates.  Take the remains of a boiled fowl and cut into pieces the size of a small cutlet. Shake a little flour over them and put them aside. Prepare a batter made of half a pound of Vienna flour, the yolk of one egg, half a gill of salad oil, and a gill of light coloured ale. Mix all these together lightly till it will mask the tip of your finger, add half a pint of purée of tomato, and mix well together. Dip the chicken cutlets into this batter, masking them well, and then put them in good lard and fry, and place them on a wire sieve as they are cooked, keeping them near the fire to keep them hot and crisp. Dish piled in a pyramid with tomatoes whole and tomato sauce round.   Chicken Nouilles au Parmesan.  Take a large fowl, and when trussed put a lump of butter inside it, and cover the breast with fat bacon. Put it into a stewpan with an onion, a carrot, a piece of celery; cover with water and boil slowly for fifty minutes. Garnish the dish on which it is served with a pint of Nouilles boiled in a stewpan of boiling water for twenty minutes, drained, and then put into another saucepan with two ounces of butter. Sprinkle in two ounces of Parmesan cheese and warm up for five minutes, then garnish the fowl with them, and pour over it a pint of rich Béchamel sauce, in which two ounces of Parmesan cheese has been mixed. The Nouilles are made by mixing half a pound of butter with three eggs till it becomes a thick smooth paste, roll it out very thin, cut it into strips an inch wide, and place four or five of these on the top of each other, shred them in thin slices like Julienne vegetables, and drain them.   Chicken Pudding à la Reine.  Take the meat from a cold fowl and pound it in a mortar, after removing the skin and sinews. Boil in light stock a couple of good tablespoonfuls of rice. When it is done and has soaked up the rice, add the pounded chicken to it, with a gill of cream, pepper, and salt. If not moist enough, add a little more cream. Butter a plain mould, fill it with the rice and chicken, tie a pudding cloth closely over, and put the mould into a stewpan of hot water to boil for an hour. The water should only reach about three-quarters up the mould. When done, turn it out and serve a good white mushroom sauce round it.   Chicken and Rice.  Pollo con Arroz (Spanish Recipe).  Cut a fowl into joints, wipe quite dry, and trim neatly. Put a wineglass of the best olive oil in a stewpan, let it get hot. Put in the chicken, stir and turn the joints and sprinkle with salt. When the chicken is a golden brown add some chopped onions, one or two red chillies, and fry all together. Meanwhile have ready four tomatoes cut in quarters, and two teacupfuls of rice well washed. Mix these with the chicken and pour in a very small quantity of broth and stew till the rice is cooked and the broth dried up. Sprinkle a little chopped parsley and serve in a deep dish without a cover, as the steam must not be kept in.   Chicken in Savoury Jelly.  Take a large chicken and roast it. Boil a calf's foot to a strong jelly, take out the foot and skim off the fat; beat up the whites of two eggs and mix them with a quarter of a pint of white wine vinegar, the juice of one lemon, a little salt, a tablespoonful of tarragon vinegar, and a claret-glassful of sherry. Put these to the jelly, and when it has boiled five or six minutes strain it through a jelly bag till clear. Then put a little into an oblong baking tin (big enough for a half-quartern loaf), and when it is nearly set put in the chicken with its breast downwards; the chicken having been masked all over with white sauce, in which aspic has been well mixed, and ornamented with a device of truffles cut in stars and kite shapes. When the chicken is in, fill up the mould gradually with the remainder of the jelly. Let it stand for some hours, or place it on ice before turning it out.   Chicken with Spinach.  Poach nicely in the gravy five or six eggs. Dress them on flattened balls of spinach round the dish and serve the fowl in the centre, rubbing down the liver to thicken the gravy and liquor in which the fowl has been stewed, which pour over it for sauce, skimming it well. Mushrooms, oysters, and forcemeat balls should be put into the sauce.   Chicken Stewed Whole.  Fill the inside of a chicken with large oysters and mushrooms and fasten a tape round to keep them in. Put it in a tin pan with a cover, and put this into a large boiling pot with boiling water, which must not quite reach up to the top of the pan the chicken is in. Keep it boiling till the chicken is done, which would be in about an hour's time after it begins to simmer. Remove the scum occasionally, and replenish with water as it boils away; take all the gravy from it and put it into a small saucepan, keeping the chicken warm. Thicken the gravy with butter, flour, and add two tablespoonfuls of chopped oysters, the yolks of two eggs boiled hard and minced fine, some seasoning, and a gill of cream. Boil five minutes and dish the fowls.   Côtelettes à l'Ecarlate.  Make a stiff forcemeat from the breast of a fowl or pheasant, or the two breasts of partridge or grouse. Cut some slices of tongue into cutlet shapes. Take some more tongue, pound and pass it through a sieve and mix it with the forcemeat. Season with a little cayenne and mushroom flavour. Butter and fill up some cutlet moulds with the forcemeat, and steam them in the oven. Then turn out the cutlets and place them on a baking sheet. Glaze them and replace them in the oven for a few seconds. Dish up alternately a cutlet of tongue with a cutlet of forcemeat; sauce the whole with chaud-froid sauce, and garnish with chopped aspic and very small red tomatoes.   Forced Capon.  Cut the skin of a capon down the breast, carefully slip the knife down so as to take out all the meat, and mix it with a pound of beef suet cut small. Beat this together in a marble mortar, and take a pint of large oysters cut small, two anchovies, a shalot, a bouquet garni, a little mignonette pepper, and the yolks of four eggs. Mix all these well together, and lay it on the bones; then draw the skin over it, and sew up. Put the capon into a cloth, and boil it an hour and a quarter. Stew a dozen oysters in good gravy thickened with a piece of butter rolled in flour; take the capon out of the cloth, lay it in its dish, and pour the sauce over it.   Capon à la Nanterre.  Make a stuffing with the liver of the capon, a dozen roasted chestnuts, a piece of butter, parsley, green onions, very little garlic, two yolks of eggs, salt and pepper. Stuff the capon, and then roast it, covering it with buttered paper. When it is cooked, brush it over with the yolk of an egg diluted in a little lukewarm batter; sprinkle breadcrumbs over all, and let it brown, and serve with a sharp sauce.   Braised Ducks à la St. Michel.  Rub some flour and oil over a couple of ducks, and brown them in the oven for a short time. Mix together a cup of Chablis wine and a cup of broth, season with pepper and salt; braise the ducks till they are tender. Chop some mushrooms, chives, and parsley; mix these in the broth in which the ducks were braised. Put the ducks to keep warm before the fire whilst the sauce 'reduces.' Dredge in a very little flour, and send up the ducks with the sauce round them.   Duck à la Mode.  Divide two ducks into quarters, and put them in a stewpan, and sprinkle over them flour, pepper, and salt. Put into the stewpan several pieces of butter, and fry the ducks till a nice brown colour. Remove the frying fat, and pour in half a pint of gravy and half a pint of port wine, sprinkle in more flour, add a bouquet garni, three minced shalots, an anchovy, and a dust of cayenne. Let them stew for twenty minutes, then place them on a dish, remove the herbs, clear off the fat, and serve with the sauce over them.   Braised Duck à la Nivernaise.  Line a braisingpan with slices of bacon, add the duck, cover it with bacon, and season with a bouquet of parsley, carrots, thyme, and bay leaves; moisten with stock and the same quantity of claret; fix the lid very tightly on the pan, and simmer over a slow fire, with hot coals on the lid of the stewpan. Cut up some turnips into balls, cook them in butter till brown, drain and simmer in brown thickening, moistened with a little stock. When the duck is cooked, dish up, and garnish with the turnips.   Devilled Duck or Teal.  Indian Recipe.  Take a pound of onions, a piece of green ginger, and six chillies. Reduce them to a pulp, then add two teaspoonfuls of mustard, pepper, salt, cayenne, and chutney, two tablespoonfuls of ketchup, and half a bottle of claret. Cut up the duck or teal, and put it into the sauce, and let it simmer for a long time--the duck having been previously roasted.   Duck à la Provence.  Rub the duck over with lemon-juice, fry it in butter for a few minutes; sprinkle it with flour; then add sufficient stock to cover it, one tablespoonful of ketchup, one carrot; cut up two onions, two cloves, a bouquet garni, pepper, and salt. Let this stew for an hour; then take out the duck, strain the gravy, and remove all fat, and add plenty of mushrooms. Put in some stoned and scalded olives, which boil up for ten minutes and dish up with the duck. The olives should have been soaked three hours previously.   Duck.  Canard à Purée Perto.  Take a pint of freshly shelled peas, boil them"]]]
