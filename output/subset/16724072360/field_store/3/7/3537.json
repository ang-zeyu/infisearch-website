Then, as it would seem, he became as one             that hath a devil, for, rushing down the stairs into the             dining-hall, he sprang upon the great table, flagons and             trenchers flying before him, and he cried aloud before all             the company that he would that very night render his body             and soul to the Powers of Evil if he might but overtake the             wench.  And while the revellers stood aghast at the fury of             the man, one more wicked or, it may be, more drunken than             the rest, cried out that they should put the hounds upon             her.  Whereat Hugo ran from the house, crying to his grooms             that they should saddle his mare and unkennel the pack, and             giving the hounds a kerchief of the maid’s, he swung them             to the line, and so off full cry in the moonlight over the             moor.              “Now, for some space the revellers stood agape, unable to             understand all that had been done in such haste.  But anon             their bemused wits awoke to the nature of the deed which             was like to be done upon the moorlands.  Everything was now             in an uproar, some calling for their pistols, some for             their horses, and some for another flask of wine.  But at             length some sense came back to their crazed minds, and the             whole of them, thirteen in number, took horse and started             in pursuit.  The moon shone clear above them, and they rode             swiftly abreast, taking that course which the maid must             needs have taken if she were to reach her own home.              “They had gone a mile or two when they passed one of the             night shepherds upon the moorlands, and they cried to him             to know if he had seen the hunt.  And the man, as the story             goes, was so crazed with fear that he could scarce speak,             but at last he said that he had indeed seen the unhappy             maiden, with the hounds upon her track.  ‘But I have seen             more than that,’ said he, ‘for Hugo Baskerville passed me             upon his black mare, and there ran mute behind him such a             hound of hell as God forbid should ever be at my heels.’              So the drunken squires cursed the shepherd and rode onward.              But soon their skins turned cold, for there came a             galloping across the moor, and the black mare, dabbled with             white froth, went past with trailing bridle and empty             saddle.  Then the revellers rode close together, for a             great fear was on them, but they still followed over the             moor, though each, had he been alone, would have been right             glad to have turned his horse’s head.  Riding slowly in             this fashion they came at last upon the hounds.  These,             though known for their valour and their breed, were             whimpering in a cluster at the head of a deep dip or goyal,             as we call it, upon the moor, some slinking away and some,             with starting hackles and staring eyes, gazing down the             narrow valley before them.              “The company had come to a halt, more sober men, as you may             guess, than when they started.  The most of them would by             no means advance, but three of them, the boldest, or it may             be the most drunken, rode forward down the goyal. Now, it             opened into a broad space in which stood two of those great             stones, still to be seen there, which were set by certain             forgotten peoples in the days of old. The moon was shining             bright upon the clearing, and there in the centre lay the             unhappy maid where she had fallen, dead of fear and of             fatigue.  But it was not the sight of her body, nor yet was             it that of the body of Hugo Baskerville lying near her,             which raised the hair upon the heads of these three             dare-devil roysterers, but it was that, standing over Hugo,             and plucking at his throat, there stood a foul thing, a             great, black beast, shaped like a hound, yet larger than             any hound that ever mortal eye has rested upon.  And even             as they looked the thing tore the throat out of Hugo             Baskerville, on which, as it turned its blazing eyes and             dripping jaws upon them, the three shrieked with fear and             rode for dear life, still screaming, across the moor.  One,             it is said, died that very night of what he had seen, and             the other twain were but broken men for the rest of their             days.              “Such is the tale, my sons, of the coming of the hound             which is said to have plagued the family so sorely ever             since.  If I have set it down it is because that which is             clearly known hath less terror than that which is but             hinted at and guessed.  Nor can it be denied that many of             the family have been unhappy in their deaths, which have             been sudden, bloody, and mysterious.  Yet may we shelter             ourselves in the infinite goodness of Providence, which             would not forever punish the innocent beyond that third or             fourth generation which is threatened in Holy Writ.  To             that Providence, my sons, I hereby commend you, and I             counsel you by way of caution to forbear from crossing the             moor in those dark hours when the powers of evil are             exalted.              “[This from Hugo Baskerville to his sons Rodger and John,             with instructions that they say nothing thereof to their             sister Elizabeth.]”        When Dr. Mortimer had finished reading this singular narrative he       pushed his spectacles up on his forehead and stared across at Mr.       Sherlock Holmes. The latter yawned and tossed the end of his       cigarette into the fire.        “Well?” said he.        “Do you not find it interesting?”        “To a collector of fairy tales.”        Dr. Mortimer drew a folded newspaper out of his pocket.        “Now, Mr. Holmes, we will give you something a little more       recent. This is the _Devon County Chronicle_ of May 14th of this       year. It is a short account of the facts elicited at the death of       Sir Charles Baskerville which occurred a few days before that       date.”        My friend leaned a little forward and his expression became       intent. Our visitor readjusted his glasses and began:          “The recent sudden death of Sir Charles Baskerville, whose name         has been mentioned as the probable Liberal candidate for         Mid-Devon at the next election, has cast a gloom over the         county.  Though Sir Charles had resided at Baskerville Hall for         a comparatively short period his amiability of character and         extreme generosity had won the affection and respect of all who         had been brought into contact with him.  In these days of         _nouveaux riches_ it is refreshing to find a case where the         scion of an old county family which has fallen upon evil days         is able to make his own fortune and to bring it back with him         to restore the fallen grandeur of his line.  Sir Charles, as is         well known, made large sums of money in South African         speculation. More wise than those who go on until the wheel         turns against them, he realised his gains and returned to         England with them.  It is only two years since he took up his         residence at Baskerville Hall, and it is common talk how large         were those schemes of reconstruction and improvement which have         been interrupted by his death.  Being himself childless, it was         his openly expressed desire that the whole countryside should,         within his own lifetime, profit by his good fortune, and many         will have personal reasons for bewailing his untimely end.  His         generous donations to local and county charities have been         frequently chronicled in these columns.              “The circumstances connected with the death of Sir Charles             cannot be said to have been entirely cleared up by the             inquest, but at least enough has been done to dispose of             those rumours to which local superstition has given rise.             There is no reason whatever to suspect foul play, or to             imagine that death could be from any but natural causes.             Sir Charles was a widower, and a man who may be said to             have been in some ways of an eccentric habit of mind. In             spite of his considerable wealth he was simple in his             personal tastes, and his indoor servants at Baskerville             Hall consisted of a married couple named Barrymore, the             husband acting as butler and the wife as housekeeper. Their             evidence, corroborated by that of several friends, tends to             show that Sir Charles’s health has for some time been             impaired, and points especially to some affection of the             heart, manifesting itself in changes of colour,             breathlessness, and acute attacks of nervous depression.             Dr. James Mortimer, the friend and medical attendant of the             deceased, has given evidence to the same effect.

And it is just such a time now. Cæsar writes verses; hence all follow in his steps. Only it is not permitted to write better verses than Cæsar, and for that reason I fear a little for Lucan. But I write prose, with which, however, I do not honor myself or others. What the lector has to read are codicilli of that poor Fabricius Veiento.”  “Why ‘poor’?”  “Because it has been communicated to him that he must dwell in Odyssa and not return to his domestic hearth till he receives a new command. That Odyssey will be easier for him than for Ulysses, since his wife is no Penelope. I need not tell thee, for that matter, that he acted stupidly. But here no one takes things otherwise than superficially. His is rather a wretched and dull little book, which people have begun to read passionately only when the author is banished. Now one hears on every side, ‘Scandala! scandala!’ and it may be that Veiento invented some things; but I, who know the city, know our patres and our women, assure thee that it is all paler than reality. Meanwhile every man is searching in the book,--for himself with alarm, for his acquaintances with delight. At the book-shop of Avirnus a hundred copyists are writing at dictation, and its success is assured.”  “Are not thy affairs in it?”  “They are; but the author is mistaken, for I am at once worse and less flat than he represents me. Seest thou we have lost long since the feeling of what is worthy or unworthy,--and to me even it seems that in real truth there is no difference between them, though Seneca, Musonius, and Trasca pretend that they see it. To me it is all one! By Hercules, I say what I think! I have preserved loftiness, however, because I know what is deformed and what is beautiful; but our poet, Bronzebeard, for example, the charioteer, the singer, the actor, does not understand this.”  “I am sorry, however, for Fabricius! He is a good companion.”  “Vanity ruined the man. Every one suspected him, no one knew certainly; but he could not contain himself, and told the secret on all sides in confidence. Hast heard the history of Rufinus?”  “No.”  “Then come to the frigidarium to cool; there I will tell thee.”  They passed to the frigidarium, in the middle of which played a fountain of bright rose-color, emitting the odor of violets. There they sat in niches which were covered with velvet, and began to cool themselves. Silence reigned for a time. Vinicius looked awhile thoughtfully at a bronze faun which, bending over the arm of a nymph, was seeking her lips eagerly with his lips.  “He is right,” said the young man. “That is what is best in life.”  “More or less! But besides this thou lovest war, for which I have no liking, since under tents one’s finger-nails break and cease to be rosy. For that matter, every man has his preferences. Bronzebeard loves song, especially his own; and old Scaurus his Corinthian vase, which stands near his bed at night, and which he kisses when he cannot sleep. He has kissed the edge off already. Tell me, dost thou not write verses?”  “No; I have never composed a single hexameter.”  “And dost thou not play on the lute and sing?”  “No.”  “And dost thou drive a chariot?”  “I tried once in Antioch, but unsuccessfully.”  “Then I am at rest concerning thee. And to what party in the hippodrome dost thou belong?”  “To the Greens.”  “Now I am perfectly at rest, especially since thou hast a large property indeed, though thou art not so rich as Pallas or Seneca. For seest thou, with us at present it is well to write verses, to sing to a lute, to declaim, and to compete in the Circus; but better, and especially safer, not to write verses, not to play, not to sing, and not to compete in the Circus. Best of all, is it to know how to admire when Bronzebeard admires. Thou art a comely young man; hence Poppæa may fall in love with thee. This is thy only peril. But no, she is too experienced; she cares for something else. She has had enough of love with her two husbands; with the third she has other views. Dost thou know that that stupid Otho loves her yet to distraction? He walks on the cliffs of Spain, and sighs; he has so lost his former habits, and so ceased to care for his person, that three hours each day suffice him to dress his hair. Who could have expected this of Otho?”  “I understand him,” answered Vinicius; “but in his place I should have done something else.”  “What, namely?”  “I should have enrolled faithful legions of mountaineers of that country. They are good soldiers,--those Iberians.”  “Vinicius! Vinicius! I almost wish to tell thee that thou wouldst not have been capable of that. And knowest why? Such things are done, but they are not mentioned even conditionally. As to me, in his place, I should have laughed at Poppæa, laughed at Bronzebeard, and formed for myself legions, not of Iberian men, however, but Iberian women. And what is more, I should have written epigrams which I should not have read to any one,--not like that poor Rufinus.”  “Thou wert to tell me his history.”  “I will tell it in the unctorium.”  But in the unctorium the attention of Vinicius was turned to other objects; namely, to wonderful slave women who were waiting for the bathers. Two of them, Africans, resembling noble statues of ebony, began to anoint their bodies with delicate perfumes from Arabia; others, Phrygians, skilled in hairdressing, held in their hands, which were bending and flexible as serpents, combs and mirrors of polished steel; two Grecian maidens from Kos, who were simply like deities, waited as vestiplicæ, till the moment should come to put statuesque folds in the togas of the lords.  “By the cloud-scattering Zeus!” said Marcus Vinicius, “what a choice thou hast!”  “I prefer choice to numbers,” answered Petronius. “My whole ‘familia’ [household servants] in Rome does not exceed four hundred, and I judge that for personal attendance only upstarts need a greater number of people.”  “More beautiful bodies even Bronzebeard does not possess,” said Vinicius, distending his nostrils.  “Thou art my relative,” answered Petronius, with a certain friendly indifference, “and I am neither so misanthropic as Barsus nor such a pedant as Aulus Plautius.”  When Vinicius heard this last name, he forgot the maidens from Kos for a moment, and, raising his head vivaciously, inquired,--“Whence did Aulus Plautius come to thy mind? Dost thou know that after I had disjointed my arm outside the city, I passed a number of days in his house? It happened that Plautius came up at the moment when the accident happened, and, seeing that I was suffering greatly, he took me to his house; there a slave of his, the physician Merion, restored me to health. I wished to speak with thee touching this very matter.”  “Why? Is it because thou hast fallen in love with Pomponia perchance? In that case I pity thee; she is not young, and she is virtuous! I cannot imagine a worse combination. Brr!”  “Not with Pomponia--eheu!” answered Vinicius.  “With whom, then?”  “If I knew myself with whom? But I do not know to a certainty her name even,--Lygia or Callina? They call her Lygia in the house, for she comes of the Lygian nation; but she has her own barbarian name, Callina. It is a wonderful house,--that of those Plautiuses. There are many people in it; but it is quiet there as in the groves of Subiacum. For a number of days I did not know that a divinity dwelt in the house. Once about daybreak I saw her bathing in the garden fountain; and I swear to thee by that foam from which Aphrodite rose, that the rays of the dawn passed right through her body. I thought that when the sun rose she would vanish before me in the light, as the twilight of morning does. Since then, I have seen her twice; and since then, too, I know not what rest is, I know not what other desires are, I have no wish to know what the city can give me. I want neither women, nor gold, nor Corinthian bronze, nor amber, nor pearls, nor wine, nor feasts; I want only Lygia. I am yearning for her, in sincerity I tell thee, Petronius, as that Dream who is imaged on the Mosaic of thy tepidarium yearned for Paisythea,--whole days and night do I yearn.”  “If she is a slave, then purchase her.”  “She is not a slave.”  “What is she? A freed woman of Plautius?”  “Never having been a slave, she could not be a freed woman.”  “Who is she?”  “I know not,--a king’s daughter, or something of that sort.”  “Thou dost rouse my curiosity, Vinicius.”  “But if thou wish to listen, I will satisfy thy curiosity straightway. Her story is not a long one. Thou art acquainted, perhaps personally, with Vannius, king of the Suevi, who, expelled from his country, spent a long time here in Rome, and became even famous for his skilful play with dice, and his good driving of chariots. Drusus put him on the throne again. Vannius, who was really a strong man, ruled well at first, and warred with success; afterward, however, he began to skin not only his neighbors, but his own Suevi, too much. Thereupon Vangio and Sido, two sister’s sons of his, and the sons of Vibilius, king of the Hermunduri, determined to force him to Rome again--to try his luck there at dice.”  “I remember; that is of recent Claudian times.”  “Yes! War broke out. Vannius summoned to his aid the Yazygi; his dear nephews called in the Lygians, who, hearing of the riches of Vannius, and enticed by the hope of booty, came in such numbers that Cæsar himself, Claudius, began to fear for the safety of the boundary. Claudius did not wish to interfere in a war among barbarians, but he wrote to Atelius Hister, who commanded the legions of the Danube, to turn a watchful eye on the course of the war, and not permit them to disturb our peace. Hister required, then, of the Lygians a promise not to cross the boundary; to this they not only agreed, but gave hostages, among whom were the wife and daughter of their leader.
