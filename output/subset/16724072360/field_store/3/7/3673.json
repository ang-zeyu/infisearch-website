I was reconciled to living the rest of my life confined to one part of the country, the way the other crews always did. But this is much better. I appreciate it. I'm sure the others do, too.\"  \"Of course, boy. Of course.\" He took out a fountain pen and made a note on my chart; I couldn't see what it was, but he looked gratified. \"It's no more than you have coming to you, Byron,\" he said. \"I'm grateful that I could be the one to make it come to pass.\"  He glanced conspiratorially at the male nurses. \"You know how important this is to me. It's the triumph of a whole new approach to psychic rehabilitation. I mean to say our heroes of space travel are entitled to freedom when they come back home to Earth, aren't they?\"  \"Definitely,\" I said, scrubbing some of the sweat off my face onto my sleeve.  \"So we've got to end this system of designated areas. We can't avoid the tensions that accompany space travel, no. But if we can help you eliminate harmful tensions with a few run-throughs, why, it's not too high a price to pay, is it?\"  \"Not a bit.\"  \"I mean to say,\" he said, warming up, \"you can look forward to the time when you'll be able to mingle with your old friends from the rocket, free and easy, without any need for restraint. That's a lot to look forward to, isn't it?\"  \"It is,\" I said. \"I look forward to it very much,\" I said. \"And I know exactly what I'm going to do the first time I meet one--I mean without any restraints, as you say,\" I said. And it was true; I did. Only it wouldn't be a broken beer bottle that I would do it with.  I had much more elaborate ideas than that.                                                            --PAUL FLEHR     Transcriber's Note:      This etext was produced from _Galaxy Science Fiction_ January 1958.

His mouth curled sharply downward in a broad alien smile as he saw the Professor.  \"Good morning!\" the Martian said happily. \"I never slept better in my life, even in my own little wet bed back on Mars.\"  He looked around more closely and his mouth straightened. \"But where did you all sleep?\" he asked. \"Don't tell me you stayed dry all night! You _didn't_ give up your only bed to me?\"  His mouth curled upward in misery. \"Oh, dear,\" he said, \"I'm afraid I've made a mistake somehow. Yet I don't understand how. Before I studied you, I didn't know what your sleeping habits would be, but that question was answered for me--in fact, it looked so reassuringly homelike--when I saw those brief TV scenes of your females ready for sleep in their little tubs. Of course, on Mars, only the fortunate can always be sure of sleeping wet, but here, with your abundance of water, I thought there would be wet beds for all.\"  He paused. \"It's true I had some doubts last night, wondering if I'd used the right words and all, but then when you rapped 'Good night' to me, I splashed the sentiment back at you and went to sleep in a wink.
