He speaks of the advantages of some, noting that the horse whim has a power two and a half times that of the man windlass, and emphasizing the even greater power available in flowing water \"when a running stream can be diverted to a mine.\" The most powerful machine then in use for deep mines appears to have been the horse-powered rag and chain pump.  Such, then, were the important mining machines of this early period of deep mining, according to the leading authority. But did they continue, as has been claimed, to be the only important machines of the subsequent century? G. E. Lohneyss,[12] writing a little over a half century after the publication of _De re metallica_, declared:       The old miners [alten Bergleute] had Heintzen, Kerratt,      Bulgenkunst, Taschen-kunst, Pumpen, with which one lifted water      with cans on pulleys or with a treadmill; and they devised and      constructed these in which the poor people moved like cattle and      wore themselves out. At that time they had powerful machines      (Kunst) using swift water, although it cost much to erect and      maintain them, and was very dangerous since an iron chain of a      Bulgenkunst alone often weighed 200 centner [over 10 tons] and      more.       But today's artisan [jetzigen Künstler] far surpasses the old ...      since we have in the present time invented many other mining      machines; such as the _Stangenkunst mit dem krummen Zapffen_, which      raises water at small cost over 100 Lachter [562 feet].   [Illustration: Figure 6.--STANGENKUNST, SHOWING DRIVING WHEEL, FELDKUNST, AND KUNSTKREUZ. From H. Calvör (see footnote 15).]   The Stangenkunst, which can be roughly translated as \"rod work with crank,\" was a piston pump driven through a crank and rods by a prime mover located at a distant point. Agricola describes a crank-driven piston pump, calling it a new machine invented ten years earlier.[13] But it is not driven bya distant prime mover. Like his other water-powered hauling machines it can only be used \"when a running stream can be diverted to a mine.\" So far as we can determine from internal evidence, Agricola did not know the Stangenkunst.  Although the full development of the Stangenkunst came later, it was apparently introduced in Agricola's time. Its introduction to the Erzgebirge has been put as early as 1550.[14] According to another authority it was introduced to the Harz in 1565 by one Heinrich Eschenbach of Meissen.[15] Its significance is only made clear to us by later authorities. As shown in figure 3 it was adapted to the utilization of a distant stream, through the Feldstangen, an extended horizontal series of reciprocating rods, and the Kunstkreuz (fig. 6), a lever in the shape of a cross for changing at right angles the direction of power transmission. These improvements may have been almost contemporaneous with Agricola, as Calvör mentions the use of the Feldkunst, which term signified the extended rods, as having been known in 1565.  The disadvantage of moving the weight of a long extension of rods was obviated, during the 17th century, through the use of a double set of balanced rods, resembling a pantograph. At some later date the horse whim was fitted with a crank and adapted to the Stangenkunst,[16] thus permitting the establishment of a veritable power network, as suggested in figure 1.  The Freiberg mine director Martin Planer reported in 1570 the installation since 1557 of thirty-eight \"Kunsten und Zeugen\" in mines under his charge. That these were water-powered machines is clear from his remark that their cost was only 10 to 20 percent that of \"Pferden und Knechten.\"[17] It is likely that many if not most were Stangenkunsten, for mining treatises of the 17th and 18th centuries testify to the continuous extension of this mechanism.[18]  Perhaps the most striking evidence of its importance is its representation on the illustrated coinage of the 17th century. These multiple talers (figs. 1, 2, 3), happy products of the ingenious fiscal policies of the Dukes of Brunswick, picture mining activity in the 17th century no less elegantly than do the woodcuts of _De re metallica_ a century earlier. The Stangenkunst received its most spectacular application in France, in its application to the driving of the second- and third-stage pumps in the famous waterworks at Marly (1681-88), but its real importance is better illustrated in central Europe, by the many descriptions and drawings showing its use in the mines, driving machinery as distant as a mile[19] from the source of power.   [Illustration: Figure 7.--FELDGESTANGE (STANGENKUNST) NEAR LAUTENTAL. From C. Matschoss, _Technische Kulturdenkmal_, Munich, 1932.]   It seems, therefore, that Lohneyss' \"old miners\" were those described by Agricola, and that the mine-hauling machinery used in central European mines changed in the century after him far more than has been recognized.[20] This thesis may further cast some light on other technological questions. The connection between the urgency of the problem of mine drainage in England, and the invention of the steam engine, has often been suggested.[21] Perhaps the \"backwardness\" of Germany in steam-engine experimentation, and later in the introduction of the Newcomen engine, was to some extent due to the adequacy of existing machinery to meet the problem of mine flooding, for it is not clear that this problem existed on the continent.[22]   [Illustration: Figure 8.--THE WATERWORKS AT MARLY-LE-ROI, ON THE SEINE RIVER, BUILT IN 1684 TO SUPPLY THE FOUNTAINS AT THE ROYAL PALACE AT VERSAILLES. From a print by de Fer, 1705. (_Smithsonian photo 45593._)]   A comparison of the techniques described by Agricola with those of a century later suggests that this was a century of significant progress in that earlier industrial revolution described by Mumford as his \"Eotechnic phase,\" characterized by \"the diminished use of human beings as prime movers, and the separation of the production of energy from its application and immediate control.\"[23]     Footnotes:  [1] W.

[2] According to Parsons (_op. cit._, footnote 1, p. 629) the introduction of machinery worked by animals and falling water, \"radical improvements\" of the 15th century, fixed the development of the art \"until the eighteenth, and, in some respects, even well into the nineteenth century.\" Wolf in his _History of science ... in the eighteenth century_ (p. 629, see footnote 1) agrees, saying that \"apart from [the steam engine] mining methods remained [during the 18th century] essentially similar to those described in Agricola's _De re metallica_.\" Bromehead (_op. cit._, footnote 1, p. 22), in referring to the date 1673 also sees \"no appreciable change in methods of mining since Agricola.\"  [3] Parsons, _op. cit._ (footnote 1), p. 179.

Bechtel calls this one of the most revolutionary industrial developments of the middle ages.  [5] Rickard (_op. cit._, footnote 3, pp. 547-554, 561) also speaks of a decline through the exhaustion of surface deposits, but dates the revival 1480-1570. He supports this conclusion by statistics on the leading mine at Rammelsberg, which was unproductive from the Black Death (1347) to 1450, and only slightly active before 1518.  [6] According to F. M. Feldhaus (_Die Technik_, Leipzig and Berlin, 1914, p. 833.), a manuscript illustration of this type of pump, which he calls Schöpfkolbenkette, appears in the Mariano Codex latinus 197, B. 180, dated 1438, in the Munich Hofbibliothek.  [7] Based on a comparison of the following editions of Agricola, _De re metallica_: Froben, Basel, 1556 (in Latin; the first edition); _The Mining Magazine_, London, 1912 (English translation by H. C. and L. H. Hoover); VDI, Berlin, 1928 (German translation by Carl Schiffner).  [8] The emergence of the term Kunst in German mining terminology is connected with the application of water power, especially to pumping (see Heinrich Veith, _Deutsches Berg-wörterbuch_, Breslau, 1870, article \"Kunst\").  [9] According to Veith (_op. cit._, footnote 8, p. 306), B. Rössler, in his _Speculum metallurgiae politissimum_ (Dresden, 1700, p. 41) says that the Taschenkunst (pocket-work) was used with a pipe, like the rag and chain pump, and the translator of the German (1928) edition of _De re metallica_ also uses Heinzen and Taschen interchangeably. Calvör and others, however, seem to use Taschenkunst for the ordinary chain of dippers, which seems better suited to its literal meaning.  [10] Agricola, _op. cit._ (footnote 7), ed. Hoover, p. 199. His contemporary and fellow-townsman Mathesius equates the Kehrrad to the Bulgenkunst (_Sarepta_, p. 145, Nurnberg, 1571). According to Veith (_op. cit._, footnote 8, p. 286), Sebastian Münster in his _Cosmographei ..._ (p. 381, Basel, 1558), had previously mentioned its use in the mines of Meissen; and its introduction has been put as early as 1500 by Otto Vogel (\"Christopher Pohlem und seine Beziehungen zum Harzer Bergbäu,\" _Beiträge zur Geschichte der Technik und Industrie_, 1913, vol."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31024"],["title","Mine Pumping in Agricola's Time and Later (#2)"],["body",", p. 324.)  [11] Agricola, _op. cit._ (footnote 7), ed. Hoover, pp. 160-199.  [12] G. E. Lohneyss, _Bericht von Bergwerken_, 1619?, n. p., p. 3.  [13] Agricola, _op. cit._ (footnote 7), ed. Hoover, pp. 184-185. The crank was centuries old at this time, and had been applied to pumping earlier than the time mentioned by Agricola, although perhaps not in mining. A drawing dated 1405 shows an Archimedian screw turned by a crank (Feldhaus, _op. cit._, footnote 6, p. 834). The _Mittelalterliche Hausbuch_ (ed. H. T. Bossert and W. F. Storck, Leipzig, 1912, Tafel 32), a German description of technology that appeared in 1480, shows an arrangement very like that described by Agricola, although not in mining service.  [14] O. Fritsche and A. Wagenbreth, \"Die Wasserhaltungs-maschinen bei Agricola und sein Einfluss auf ihre weitere Entwicklung,\" in _Deutsche Akademie der Wissenschaft zu Berlin_, _Georgius Agricola_, (East) Berlin: Akademie Verlag, 1953, p. 112.  [15] Hennig Calvör, _Acta historico-chronologico-mechanica circa Metallurgiam ..._, Braunschweig, 1763, pp. 36-37.  [16] I have been unable to find an early reference to this innovation, which appears in a sketch of 1784-85 illustrating Conrad Matschoss', \"Die Maschinen des deutschen Berg- und Hüttenwesens vor 100 Jahren,\" _Beiträge zur Geschichte der Technik und Industrie_ (1909), Band I, p. 7. Its introduction may be connected with the appearance of the term Rosskunst for the horse windlass, known earlier as the Göpel.  [17] \"Bericht des Bergverwalters Martin Planer über den Stand des Freiberger Bergbaues im Jahre 1570,\" ed. R. Wengler, _Mittheilungen Freiberger Altertumsverein_, 1898, vol. 35, pp. 75-83.  [18] The description of the Stangenkunst in its various modifications is one of the chief topics of the previously cited work of Calvör (footnote 15), and from his and other references it is clear that the subject was also treated extensively by such earlier writers as Lohneyss (1617) and Rössler (1700).  [19] Fritsche and Wagenbreth, _op. cit._ (footnote 14), p. 112.  [20] The hauling of ores, as opposed to water, seems to have remained as shown by Agricola until the end of the 17th century. In 1694, however, the famous Swedish engineer Christopher Polhem built at Falun a water-powered conveyer system which brought the ore from the point of origin in the mine to the smelter in a single operation, terminating with the automatic unloading of the buckets (Vogel, _op. cit._, footnote 10, p. 306).  [21] Dickinson, H. W., _A short history of the steam engine_, New York, n. d., p. 3.  [22] In 1673 Edward Browne visited Hungary and the Erzgebirge. His report on the trip, _A brief account of some travels in diverse parts of Europe_ (2nd ed., London, 1685, p. 170), says little about machinery, but does not mention flooding as a serious problem. Of an 84-fathom mine called Auff der Halsbrucker, near Freiberg, he says \"they are not so much troubled with water, and have very good engines to draw water out.\" Yet the chain of dippers and rag and chain pump were evidently fallen into disuse, as they do not appear among the mining machines reported by Fritsche and Wagenbreth as having been described by Lohneyss (1617) or Rössler (1700); and Fritsche and Wagenbreth declare that German hydraulic machinery was able to compete with the steam engine in mine dewatering for some time into the 19th century (_op. cit._, footnote 14, pp. 111, 112).
