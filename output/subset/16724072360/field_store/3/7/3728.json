They lay from three to six eggs of a dingy white color which have the stained surface common to Grebes eggs. Size 2.35 × 1.25.

HORNED GREBE. Colymbus auritus.  Range.--The whole of North America, breeding in the interior from North Dakota northwest; winters along the Gulf Coast. This species is one of the most beautiful of the Grebes, having in the breeding season buffy ear tufts, black cheeks and throat, and chestnut neck, breast and sides. They breed abundantly in the marshy flats of North Dakota and the interior of Canada. They build a typical Grebe's nest, a floating mass of decayed matter which stains the naturally white eggs to a dirty brown. The number of eggs varies from three to seven. Size 1.70 × 1.15. Data.--Devils Lake, N. Dakota, June 20, 1900. 6 eggs much stained. Nest floating in 4 ft. of water, a large mass of rotten rushes and weeds. Collector. James Smalley.   4. EARED GREBE. _Colymbus nigricollis californicus._  Range.--North America west of the Mississippi, breeding from Texas to Manitoba and wintering along the Pacific Coast of the United States and from Texas southward.  Eared Grebes differ from the preceding in having the entire neck blackish. They nest very abundantly throughout the west, in favorable localities, from Texas to Minnesota and Dakota. Their nests are constructed in the same manner as the preceding varieties and are located in similar localities. As do all the Grebes when leaving the nest, they cover the eggs with the damp rushes from around the base of the nest. This is probably for the purpose of assisting incubation during their absence, by the action of the sun's rays on the wet mass. As they are nearly always thus covered upon the approach of anyone, this may be done also as a protection from discovery. They lay from three to eight bluish white eggs with the usual chalky and discolored appearance. The breeding season is at its height early in June, or earlier, in the southern portion of its range. Size 1.75 × 1.20. Data.--Artesian, S. Dakota, June 21, 1899. Nest of rushes, floating in three feet of water. Large colony in a small lake. Collector, F. A. Patton.  [Illustration 015: Horned Grebe.

MEXICAN GREBE. _Colymbus dominicus brachypterus._  Range.--Southern Texas and Lower California southward to South America, breeding throughout its range.  The Least Grebe is by far the smallest of the Grebes in this country, being but 10 in. in length; it can not be mistaken for any other, the Eared Grebe being the only species of this family found in the same localities during the summer. These little Grebes nest very abundantly along the Rio Grande Valley in Texas, the nesting season lasting from the latter part of May until well into December.  Their nests are floating piles of grass and weeds upon which they lay from three to five chalky white eggs, which are always discolored, sometimes to a deep chocolate hue. These eggs average a great deal darker in color than do any of the other Grebes. In a series of fifty sets fully half were a rich brown tint. Size 1.40 × .95.   6. PIED-BILLED GREBE. _Podilymbus podiceps._  Range.--From the British provinces southward to Argentine Republic, breeding locally throughout the northern portions of its range.  The Dabchick, as this bird is called, is the most evenly distributed bird of this family. It is nowhere especially abundant, nor is it, except in a very few localities, regarded as rare. Consequently it is the best known bird of the species. They do not congregate in such large numbers as the other Grebes during the nesting season, but one or more pairs may be found in almost any favorable locality. These birds render their floating nest a little more substantial than those of the preceding varieties by the addition of mud which they bring up from the bottom of the pond; this addition also tends to soil the eggs more, consequently the eggs of this bird are, as a general rule, browner than the other Grebes with the exception of the Least. The bird may always be known by the shape of its bill which is higher than it is broad, and in the summer is white with a black band across the middle. The throat is also black at this season. They lay from five to nine eggs commencing about the middle of May. Size 1.70 × 1.18.  [Illustration 017: Deep buff or rich brown.] [Illustration: Mexican Grebe. Pied-billed Grebe.] [Illustration: Deep buff.] [Illustration: right-hand margin.]  Page 16  [Illustration 018: PIED-BILLED GREBE.]  Page 17  LOONS. Family GAVIIDAE  Loons may be likened to gigantic Grebes from which they differ externally, chiefly in the full webbed foot instead of the individually webbed toes of the Grebe, and in the sharper, more pointed and spear-like bill. These birds are similar in their habits to the Grebes, except that their homes are generally more substantially built and are placed upon a solid foundation, generally upon an island in some inland lake.  Both Loons and Grebes are literally \"Water witches,\" being practically, and in the case of Grebes, actually, born in the water and living in it ever afterwards. Loons are strong fliers, but like the Grebes, because of their small wings they must get their first impetus from the water in order to rise; in case there is any wind blowing they also make use of this by starting their flight against it. They are very peculiar birds and the expression \"crazy as a loon\" is not a fanciful one, being formed from their early morning and evening antics when two or more of them will race over the top of the water, up and down the lake, all the while uttering their demoniacal laughter. They vie with the Grebes in diving and disappear at the flash of a gun.  [Illustration 019: EGG OF LOON. Dark greenish brown.] [Illustration: right hand margin.]  Page 18  7. LOON. _Gavia immer._  Range.--North America north of the Mexican boundary, breeding from the northern parts of the United States northward.  Unlike the Grebes, Loons do not build in colonies, generally not more than one, or at the most two pairs nesting on the same lake or pond; neither do they seek the marshy sloughs in which Grebes dwell, preferring the more open, clear bodies of water. The common Loon may be known in summer by the entirely black head and neck with the complete ribbon of black and white stripes encircling the lower neck and the narrower one which crosses the throat. The back is spotted with white. In some sections Loons build no nest, simply scooping a hollow out in the sand, while in other places they construct quite a large nest of sticks, moss and grasses. It is usually placed but a few feet from the waters edge, so that at the least suspicion the bird can slide off its eggs into the water, where it can cope with any enemy. The nests are nearly always concealed under the overhanging bushes that line the shore; the one shown in the full page illustration, however, was located upon the top of an old muskrat house. The two eggs which they lay are a very dark greenish brown in color, with black spots. Size 3.50 × 2.25. Data.--Lake Sunapee, N. H., June 28, 1895. Nest placed under the bushes at the waters edge. Made of rushes, weeds and grasses; a large structure nearly three feet in diameter. Collector, H. A. Collins.   8. YELLOW-BILLED LOON. _Gavia adamsi._  Range.--Northwestern North America, along the Arctic and northern Alaskan coasts.  The Yellow-billed Loon with the exception of its whitish or yellowish bill in place of the black, is practically otherwise indistinguishable from the common Loon. It averages somewhat larger in size. This is one of the most northerly breeding birds and it is only within a very few years that anything has been learned about the breeding habits. Their nesting habits and eggs are precisely like the preceding except that the latter average a little larger. Size 3.60 × 2.25.   9. BLACK-THROATED LOON. _Gavia arctica._.  Range.--From northern United States northward, breeding along the Arctic Coast.  This species can be easily separated from the Loon by the gray crown and white streaks down the back of the neck. Its size, too, is about five inches shorter. The nesting habits are the same as the Loons and the eggs have rather more of an olive tint besides having the majority of spots at the larger end. Size 3.10 × 2.00.  [Illustration 020: Loon. Black-throated Loon.] [Illustration: left-hand margin.]  Page 19  10. PACIFIC LOON. _Gavia pacifica._  Range.--Western North America along the coast chiefly, breeding from Alaska south to British Columbia. In winter, south along the coast to Mexico.  This species differs from the Black-throated only in the tint of the head reflections. The habits are the same as those of the other members of the family. They lay two eggs of a greenish brown or greenish gray hue with black spots. Size 3.10 × 1.90. Data.--Yukon River, Alaska, June 28, 1902. Nest of rubbish on an island; found by a miner.   11. RED-THROATED LOON. _Gavia stellata._  Range.--Northern parts of North America, breeding from southern Canada northward in the interior on both coasts. South to the middle portions of the United States in winter.  This is the smallest of the Loon family, being twenty-five inches in length. In plumage it is wholly unlike any of the other members at all seasons of the year. In summer the back, head and neck are gray, the latter being"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30000"],["title","The Bird Book (#2)"],["body"," with white. A large chestnut patch adorns the front of the lower part of the neck. In winter the back is spotted with white, whereas all the others are unspotted at this period. The nesting habits are identical with the other species; the ground color of the two eggs is also the same. Size 2.00 × 1.75.  [Illustration 021: Pacific Loon. Red-throated Loon.] [Illustration: PACIFIC LOON. Greenish brown or gray.] [Illustration: right-hand margin.]  Page 20  [Illustration 022: J. A. Munro. NEST AND EGGS OF LOON. This nest is built on top of a Muskrat house.]  Page 21  PUFFINS, AUKS and MURRES. Family ALCIDÆ  Puffins, Auks and Murres are all sea birds and are only found inland when blown there by some severe storm of winter. At this season numbers of them are apt to lose their bearings and may sometimes be found with their feet frozen in some of our inland ponds. Puffins are heavily built birds in appearance, but are very active both on the wing and in the water. Their wings are much larger comparatively than those of the other members of this family, so they are enabled to perform evolutions in the air, which are withheld from the others. They stand upright on the sole of the foot and are able to walk quite easily on land. Puffins have very heavy and deep but thin bills, which are entirely unlike those of any other bird and often give then the name of Parrot Auks. Puffins, Auks and Murres are otherwise recognized by the presence of but three toes which are webbed.  [Illustration 023: NEST AND EGGS OF PIED-BILLED GREBE.] [Illustration: right hand margin.]  Page 22  12. TUFTED PUFFIN. _Lunda cirrhata._  Range.--Pacific Coast from Alaska southward to southern California, breeding locally throughout their range.  Tufted Puffins are the largest of the Puffins. In the breeding plumage, they are a sooty brownish or black color; the cheeks are white, and a long tuft of straw colored feathers extends back from each eye; the bill is bright red and greenish yellow. They breed commonly on the Farallones, where two or three broods are raised by a bird in a single season, but much more abundantly on the islands in the north. Their single eggs are laid in burrows in the ground or else in natural crevices formed by the rocks. The eggs are pure white or pale buff and are without gloss. They very often have barely perceptible shell markings of dull purplish color. The eggs are laid about the middle of June. Size 2.80 × 1.90. Data.--Farallone Is., May 27, 1887. Single egg laid in crevice of rocks. Collector, W. O. Emerson.   13. PUFFIN. _Fratercula arctica arctica._  Range.--North Atlantic Coast, breeding from the Bay of Fundy northward. Winters from breeding range along the New England Coast.  The common Puffin has the cheeks, chin and underparts white; upper parts and a band across the throat, blackish. Bill deep and thin, and colored with red, orange and yellow. They breed in large numbers on Bird Rock in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The nest is either among the natural crevices of the  [Illustration 024: Tufted Puffin. Puffin.] [Illustration: White.] [Illustration: left hand margin.]  Page 23  rocks, or in burrows excavated in the ground by the birds. These burrows vary in length from two and a half to four or five feet. Except upon the positive knowledge of the absence of the bird, it is a hazardous thing to put the hand in one of these burrows for the bird can, and will nip the fingers, sometimes to the bone. They lay but a single egg, usually dull white and unmarked, but in some cases obscurely marked with reddish brown. Size 2.50 × 1.75. Data.--So. Labrador, June 23, 1884. Single egg laid at end of burrow in the ground. Collector, J. H. Jameson.   13a. LARGE-BILLED PUFFIN. _Fratercula arctica naumanni._  A more northerly subspecies of the last, inhabiting the Arctic region on the Atlantic side. The bird is somewhat larger but otherwise indistinguishable from the common species. The eggs are exactly the same or average a trifle larger. Size 2.55 × 1.80. Data.--Iceland, July 6, 1900. Single egg in hole under a rock. Collector, Chas. Jefferys.   14. HORNED PUFFIN. _Fratercula corniculata._  Range.--Pacific Coast from Alaska to British Columbia. The Horned Puffin differs from the common in that the blackish band across the throat extends upwards in a point to the bill. Their nesting habits are precisely the same as those of the preceding species. A single pure white egg is laid; the shell is slightly rougher than those of the others. Size 2.65 × 1.80. Data.--Round Is., Alaska, June 24, 1884. Single egg laid at end of burrow in ground; no nest. Collector, G. L. Kennedy.   15. RHINOCEROS AUKLET. _Cerorhinca monocerata._  Range.--Pacific Coast, breeding from British Columbia northward and wintering southward to Lower California.  The Rhinoceros Auklet or Horned Auk has a much smaller bill than the Puffins; in the summer this is adorned at the base by a horn from which it takes its name. There are also slender plumes from above and below the eyes. Unlike the Puffins, these birds sit upon their whole tarsus.  They nest on islands of the North Pacific Coast from Vancouver northward. A single egg is laid in crevices among the rocks or in burrows in the ground. It is similar both in size and shape to that of the Puffins, but is often quite heavily blotched with brown. Size 2.70 × 1.80. Data.--Unak Is., Alaska, June 30, 1900. Egg laid in a fissure of the rocks; no nest. Collector, F. Weston.  [Illustration 025: White.] [Illustration: right hand margin.]  Page 24  16. CASSIN AUKLET. _Ptychoramphus aleuticus._  Range.--Pacific Coast from Alaska to Lower California, breeding nearly throughout its range.  A plain appearing bird about 9 in. in length, with blackish upperparts relieved only by a white spot over the eye; breast and throat gray and belly white. This Auklet is fairly abundant on the Farallones, breeding on the lower portions of the island. The late Mr. C. Barlow says that it is found in deserted rabbit burrows and in all probability often excavates its own burrows. It also nests among the cliffs placing its eggs among the rocks in any crevice or tunnel which may offer a dark retreat during the day for they are nocturnal in their habits. The single egg which they lay is dull white in color, the inside of the shell being a pale green, which color can only be seen by holding the egg to the light. They are generally slightly nest stained. Size 1.80 × 1.30. Data.--Coronado Islands, Cal., March 23, 1897. Single egg laid on the bare ground at end of a burrow three and one-half feet long. Collector, E. A. Shives.  [Illustration 026: Horned Puffin. Rhinoceros Auklet. Cassin Auklet.] [Illustration: White.] [Illustration: left hand margin.] [Illustration: RHINOCEROS AUKLET. Color white, sometimes heavily blotched, as above, and again unspotted.]  Page 25  17. PAROQUET AUKLET.--_Phaleris psittacula._  Range.--The Alaskan Coast, casually farther south in winter.  This bird is about the same size as the preceding, and the plumage is similar, except that it has no white spot over the eye, and the breast is white. It also has a slender plume extending from back of the eye. The bill is very peculiar, being quite deep and rounded and having an upward tendency. It is orange red in color. They breed very commonly on the islands of Bering Strait. Their eggs are laid in the crevices of the cliff, often several feet in and by a crooked path so that it is impossible to reach them. The single chalky white egg is laid in May. Size 2.30 × 1.45. Data.--Rocky Islet in the Aleutians, June 22, 1890. Single egg laid on bare rock in a deep crevice. Collector, Capt. S. Wilson.   18. CRESTED AUKLET. _Aethia cristatella._  Range.--Alaska Coast, similar in form and plumage to the latter, except that the whole under parts are gray and it has a crest of recurved feathers. The nesting season begins in May, the birds nesting upon the same islands and in the same kinds of sites as the last species. The single egg is chalky white. Size 2.10 × 1.50. Data.--Unak Is., Alaska, July 1, 1900. Egg laid in a crevice among the rocks. Collector, F. Weston.   19. WHISKERED AUKLET. _Aethia pygmaea._  Range.--The Alaska Coast.  Much smaller than the preceding; but 7.5 in. in length. Breast gray, belly white; a small tuft of recurved feathers on the forehead and slender white plumes from base of bill over the eye and from under the eye, backwards. The bill in summer is a bright vermillion color. On some of the islands of the Aleutian chain they breed quite abundantly. The nests are placed back in the crevices of the rocks, where the single white eggs are laid. Size 2.00 × 1.25.  [Illustration 027: Paroquet Auklet. Crested Auklet.] [Illustration: White.] [Illustration: right hand margin.]  Page 26  20. LEAST AUKLET. _Aethia pusilla._  Range.--North Pacific on the islands and coast of Alaska. This is the smallest of the Auklets; length 6.5 in. This species has no crest, but has the slender white plumes extending back from the eye. The entire under parts are white sparsely spotted with dusky. This species is by far the most abundant of the water birds of the extreme Northwest, and thousands of them, accompanied by the two preceding species, nest on the rocky cliffs of the islands of Bering Sea. Their nesting habits are the same as those of the other Auklets, they placing their single white egg on the bare rocks, in crevices on the cliffs. Size 1.55 × 1.10. Data.--Pribilof Is., Alaska, June 8, 1897. Single egg laid in crevice. Thousands breeding on the island.   21. ANCIENT MURRELET. _Synthliboramphus antiquus._  Range.--Pacific Coast, breeding from the border of the United States, northward, and wintering south to southern California.  The Murrelets have no crests or plumes and the bills are more slender than the Auklets and are not highly colored. The ancient Murrelet or Black-throated Murrelet, as it is also called, has a gray back, white under parts and a black head and throat, with a"]]]
