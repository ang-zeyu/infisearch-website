You will need time to think to see all of them.  \"It does not permit time travel as we have thought of time travel, but it gives us immortality of a sort. Immortality of the kind I have temporarily given us.  \"_Is it good?_ Is it worth while to lose the memory of fifty years of one's life in order to return one's body to relative youth? The only way I can find out is to try, as soon as I have finished writing this and made my other preparations.  \"You will know the answer.  \"But before you decide, remember that there is another problem, more important than the psychological one. I mean overpopulation.  \"If our discovery is given to the world, if all who are old or dying can make themselves young again, the population will almost double every generation. Nor would the world--not even our own relatively enlightened country--be willing to accept compulsory birth control as a solution.  \"Give this to the world, as the world is today in 2004, and within a generation there will be famine, suffering, war. Perhaps a complete collapse of civilization.  \"Yes, we have reached other planets, but they are not suitable for colonizing. The stars may be our answer, but we are a long way from reaching them. When we do, someday, the billions of habitable planets that must be out there will be our answer ... our living room. But until then, what is the answer?  \"Destroy the machine? But think of the countless lives it can save, the suffering it can prevent. Think of what it would mean to a man dying of cancer. Think ...\"         *       *       *       *       *  Think. You finish the letter and put it down.  You think of Barbara dead for forty-five years. And of the fact that you were married to her for three years and that those years are lost to you.  Fifty years lost. You damn the old man of seventy-five whom you became and who has done this to you ... who has given you this decision to make.  Bitterly, you know what the decision must be. You think that _he_ knew, too, and realize that he could safely leave it in your hands. Damn him, he _should_ have known.  Too valuable to destroy, too dangerous to give.  The other answer is painfully obvious.  You must be custodian of this discovery and keep it secret until it is safe to give, until mankind has expanded to the stars and has new worlds to populate, or until, even without that, he has reached a state of civilization where he can avoid overpopulation by rationing births to the number of accidental--or voluntary--deaths.  If neither of those things has happened in another fifty years (and are they likely so soon?), then you, at seventy-five, will be writing another letter like this one. You will be undergoing another experience similar to the one you're going through now. And making the same decision, of course.  Why not? You'll be the same person again.  Time and again, to preserve this secret until Man is ready for it.  How often will you again sit at a desk like this one, thinking the thoughts you are thinking now, feeling the grief you now feel?  There is a click at the door and you know that the time lock has opened, that you are now free to leave this room, free to start a new life for yourself in place of the one you have already lived and lost.  But you are in no hurry now to walk directly through that door.  You sit there, staring straight ahead of you blindly, seeing in your mind's eye the vista of a set of facing mirrors, like those in an old-fashioned barber shop, reflecting the same thing over and over again, diminishing into far distance.                                                         --FREDRIC BROWN     Transcriber's Note:      This etext was produced from _Galaxy Science Fiction_ December 1953.

And why should fears for future years   Mix jolly ale with thoughts of tears     When in the horn 'tis poured?   And why should ghost of sorrow fright   The bold heart of an English wight     When beef is on the board?    De Thorold's guests are wiser than     The men of mopish lore;   For round they push the smiling can,     And slice the plattered store.    And round they thrust the ponderous cheese,     And the loaves of wheat and rye:   None stinteth him for lack of ease--   For each a stintless welcome sees,     In the Baron's blythesome eye.    The Baron joineth the joyous feast--     But not in pomp or pride;   He smileth on the humblest guest   So gladsomely--all feel that rest     Of heart which doth abide   Where deeds of generousness attest   The welcome by the tongue professed,     Is not within belied.    And the Baron's beauteous child is there,     In her maiden peerlessness,--   Her eyes diffusing heart-light rare,   And smiles so sweetly debonair,     That all her presence bless.--    But wherefore paleth, soon, her cheek?   And why, with trembling, doth she seek     To shun her father's gaze?   And who is he for whom the crowd   Make ready room, and \"Welcome\" loud     With gleeful voices raise?    \"Right welcome!\" though the revellers shout,     They hail the minstrel \"Stranger!\"   And in the Baron's eye dwells doubt,     And his daughter's look thrills \"danger!\"    Though he seemeth meek the youth is bold,     And his speech is firm and free;   He saith he will carol a legend old,   Of a Norman lord of Torksey told:     He learnt it o'er the sea;   And he will not sing for the Baron's gold,     But for love of minstrelsy.    \"Come, tune thy harp!\" the Baron saith,     \"And tell thy minstrel tale:   It is too late to harbour wrath     For the thieves in helm and mail:    \"Our fathers' home again is ours!--     Though Thorold is Saxon still,   To a song of thy foreign troubadours     He can list with right good will!\"    A shout of glee rings to the roof,     And the revellers form a ring;   Then silent wait to mark what proof     Of skill with voice and string   The youthful stranger will afford.    Full soon he tunes each quivering chord,   And, with preamble wildly sweet   He doth the wondering listeners greet;--   Then strikes into a changeful chaunt   That fits his fanciful romaunt.     The Daughter of Plantagenet.  THE STRANGER MINSTREL'S TALE.   FYTTE THE FYRSTE.      'Tis midnight, and the broad full moon     Pours on the earth her silver noon;     Sheeted in white, like spectres of fear,     Their ghostly forms the towers uprear;   And their long dark shadows behind them are cast,   Like the frown of the cloud when the lightning hath past.      The warder sleeps on the battlement,     And there is not a breeze to curl the Trent;     The leaf is at rest, and the owl is mute--     But list! awaked is the woodland lute:   The nightingale warbles her omen sweet   On the hour when the ladye her lover shall meet.      She waves her hand from the loophole high,     And watcheth, with many a struggling sigh,     And hearkeneth in doubt, and paleth with fear,--     Yet tremblingly trusts her true knight is near;--   And there skims o'er the river--or doth her heart doat?--   As with wing of the night-hawk--her lover's brave boat.      His noble form hath attained the strand,     And she waves again her small white hand;     And breathing to heaven, in haste, a prayer,     Softly glides down the lonely stair;   And there stands by the portal, all watchful and still,   Her own faithful damsel awaiting her will.      The midnight lamp gleams dull and pale,--     The maidens twain are weak and frail,--     But Love doth aid his votaries true,     While they the massive bolts undo,--   And a moment hath flown, and the warrior knight   Embraceth his love in the meek moonlight.    The knight his love-prayer, tenderly,     Thus breathed in his fair one's ear   \"Oh! wilt thou not, my Agnes, flee?--     And, quelling thy maiden fear,   Away in the fleeting skiff with me,     And, for aye, this lone heart cheer?\"    \"O let not bold Romara[7] seek\"--     Soft answered his ladye-love,--   \"A father's doating heart to break,   For should I disdainful prove   Of his high behests, his darling child   Will thenceforth be counted a thing defiled;   And the kindling eye of my martial sire   Be robbed of its pride, and be quenched its fire:   Nor long would true Romara deem   The heart of his Agnes beat for him,   And for him alone--if that heart, he knew,   To its holiest law could be thus untrue.\"    His plume-crowned helm the warrior bows     Low o'er her shoulder fair,   And bursting sighs the grief disclose     His lips can not declare;   And swiftly glide the tears of love     Adown the ladye's cheek;--   Their deep commingling sorrows prove     The love they cannot speak!      The moon shines on them, as on things       She loves to robe with gladness,--     But all her light no radiance brings       Unto their hearts' dark sadness:     Forlornly, 'neath her cheerless ray,--       Bosom to bosom beating,--     In speechless agony they stay,       With burning kisses greeting;--   Nor reck they with what speed doth haste   The present hour to join the past.      \"Ho! lady Agnes, lady dear!\"       Her fearful damsel cries;     \"You reckon not, I deeply fear,       How swift the moontide flies!     The surly warder will awake,       The morning dawn, anon,--     My heart beginneth sore to quake,--       I fear we are undone!\"    But Love is mightier than Fear:     The ladye hasteth not:   The magnet of her heart is near,     And peril is forgot!    She clingeth to her knight's brave breast     Like a lorn turtle-dove,   And 'mid the peril feeleth rest,--     The full, rapt rest of Love!    \"I charge thee, hie thee hence, sir knight!\"     The damsel shrilly cries;   \"If this should meet her father's sight,     By Heaven! my lady dies.\"    The warrior rouseth all his pride,     And looseth his love's caress,--   Yet slowness of heart doth his strength betide     As he looks on her loveliness:--   But again the damsel their love-dream breaks,--     And, self-reproachingly,   The knight his resolve of its fetters shakes,     And his spirit now standeth free.      Then, came the last, absorbing kiss,       True Love can ne'er forego,--     That dreamy plenitude of bliss       Or antepast of woe,--   That seeming child of Heaven, which at its birth   Briefly expires, and proves itself of earth.    The ladye hieth to her couch;--     And when the morn appears,   The changes of her cheek avouch,     Full virginly her fears;--   But her doating father can nought discern     In the hues of the rose and the lily that chase     Each other across her lovely face,--   Save a sweetness that softens his visage stern.   FYTTE THE SECONDE.    Romara's skiff is on the Trent,     And the stream is in its strength,--   For a surge, from its ocean-fountain sent,     Pervades its giant length:[8]   Roars the hoarse heygre[9] in its course,   Lashing the banks with its wrathful force;   And dolefully echoes the wild-fowl's scream,   As the sallows are swept by the whelming stream;   And her callow young are hurled for a meal,   To the gorge of the barbel, the pike, and the eel:   The porpoise[10] heaves 'mid the rolling tide,   And, snorting in mirth, doth merrily ride,--   For he hath forsaken his bed in the sea,   To sup on the salmon, right daintily!    In Romara's breast a tempest raves:   He heeds not the rage of the furrowy waves:   Supremely his hopes and fears are set   On the image of Agnes Plantagenet:[11]   And though from his vision fade Gainsburgh's towers,   And the moon is beclouded, and darkness lours,   Yet the eye of his passion oft pierceth the gloom,   And beholds his Beloved in her virgin bloom--     Kneeling before the holy Rood,--       All clasped her hands,--     Beseeching the saints and angels good       That their watchful bands   Her knight may preserve from a watery tomb!    What deathful scream rends Romara's heart?--     Is it the bittern that, flapping the air,   Doth shriek in madness, and downward dart,     As if from the bosom of Death she would tear   Her perished brood,--or a shroud would have   By their side, in the depths of their river-grave?    Hark! hark! again!--'tis a human cry,   Like the shriek of a man about to die!   And its desolateness doth fearfully pierce   The billowy boom of the torrent fierce;       And, swift as a thought       Glides the warrior's boat   Through the foaming surge to the river's bank,   Where, lo!--by a branch of the osiers dank,       Clingeth one in agony       Uttering that doleful cry!    His silvery head of age upborne     Appeared above the wave;   So nearly was his strength outworn,     That all too late to save   Had been the knight, if another billow     Its force on his fainting frame, had bent,--   Nay, his feeble grasp by the drooping willow     The beat of a pulse might have fatally spent.    With eager pounce did Romara take     From the yawning wave its prey,--   But nought to his deliverer spake     The man with the head of gray:   And the warrior stripped, with needful haste,   The helpless one of his drenchëd vest,   And wrapt his own warm mantle round   The chill one in his deathly swound.    The sea-born strength of the stream is spent,     And Romara's boat outstrips its speed,--   For his stalwart arm to the oar is bent,     And swiftly the ebbing waves recede.    Divinely streaketh the morning-star     With a wavy light the rippling waters;   And the moon looks on from the west, afar,     And palely smiles, with her waning daughters,   The thin-strown stars, which their vigil keep   Till the orient sun shall awake from sleep.    The sun hath awoke; and in"]]]
