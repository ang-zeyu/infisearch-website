When done, pass the same through a sieve, and add to it the purée of peas; reduce the whole to the consistency of thick cream. Serve the duck with the purée over it.   Salmi of Duck.  Take the giblets of a duck and the flesh off the carcase, and the bones, and stew them in equal quantities of claret and stock, salt, pepper, and three shalots. Reduce and simmer till it is thick, then pass through a sieve, and take it off the fire before it boils. Cut up the duck into neat pieces and lay it in the stewpan with the gravy. Squeeze juice of strained orange over it, and serve en pyramide.   Stewed Duck and Turnips.  Brown the duck in a stewpan with some butter, peel and cut some young turnips into equal sizes, and brown in the same butter; stir in a little powdered sugar, reduce some stock to a thin brown sauce, season with salt, pepper, a bouquet of parsley, chives, half a head of garlic, and a bayleaf. Stew the duck in this sauce, and when half cooked add the turnips, turn the duck from time to time, being careful not to break the turnips, cook slowly, and skim off all grease and serve.   Roast Goose Stuffed with Chestnuts.  Prepare a goose and stuff it with a mixture of minced bacon, the liver, salt, pepper, grated nutmeg, and chestnuts, which have been previously cooked and peeled. Baste the goose well whilst roasting. When cooked, serve with its own gravy, and sprinkle with salt, pepper, and the juice of a lemon.   Goose à la Royale.  Having boned the goose, stuff it with the following forcemeat:--Twelve sage leaves, two onions, and two apples, all shred very fine. Mix with four ounces grated bread, four ounces of beef suet, two glasses of port wine, a grate of nutmeg, pepper, and salt to taste, the grated peel of a lemon, and the beaten yolks of four eggs; sew up the goose and fry in butter till a light brown, and put it into two quarts of good stock and let it stew for two hours, and till the liquor is nearly consumed; then take up the goose, strain the liquor and take off the fat, add a spoonful of lemon pickle, the same of browning and port wine, a teaspoonful of essence of anchovy, a little cayenne and salt, boil it up and pour over the goose.   Game and Macaroni.  Put some ounces of macaroni into boiling stock, then add any game cut into small joints three parts cooked. Add some lean raw ham, chopped mushrooms, pepper, and salt.   Game Pie.  Take ten ounces of veal and the same of veal fat, and chop it very fine, season with pepper, salt, and cayenne. Arrange this as a lining round a china raised pie mould. Fill in with fillets of grouse, pheasant, partridge, and hare, strips of tongue, ham, hard-boiled yolks of eggs, button mushrooms, pistachio nuts, truffles, and pâté de foie gras; cover in with more of the mince, then put a paste on the top for cooking it in. Bake from two and a half to three hours. Remove the paste and fill the mould up with clarified meat jelly, partly cold; let this set. Ornament the top with chopped aspic and alternate slices of lemon and cucumber round. Croûtons of red and yellow aspic should be arranged at the base of the mould.   Game Rissoles au Poulet à la Carême.  Roll out very thin three-quarters of a pound of Brioche paste. Place upon it, two inches from the edge, minced fowl or game, prepared as for croquets, and rolled up between two teaspoons in balls the size of a nutmeg. Place these an inch from each other; egg the paste all round and fold the edge of it over the balls of mince. Press it firmly down, and with a paste stamp two inches wide cut the rissoles, keeping the mince balls exactly in the centre of each. Lay them on a hot tin that the paste may rise and fry them in lard not too hot, turning them with a skewer. They will become quite round. When of a good golden colour drain them and serve directly, and dish up in a pyramid.   Salad of Game à la Francatelli.  Boil eight eggs hard; shell them, and cut a thin slice off the bottom of each, cut each into four lengthwise. Make a very thin flat border of butter about one inch from the edge of the dish the salad is to be served on, fix the pieces of egg upright close to each other, the yolk outside, or alternately the white and yolk, lay in the centre a layer of fresh salad, and, having cut a freshly roasted young grouse into eight or ten pieces, prepare a sauce as follows: Put a spoonful of eschalots finely chopped in a basin, one ditto of castor sugar, the yolk of one egg, a teaspoonful of chopped parsley, tarragon, and chervil, and a little salt. Mix in by degrees four spoonfuls of oil and two of white vinegar. When well mixed put it on ice, and when ready to serve up whip a gill of cream, which lightly mix with it. Then lay the inferior parts of the grouse on the salad, sauce over so as to cover each piece, then lay over the salad and the remainder of the grouse, sauce over, and serve. The eggs can be ornamented with a little dot of radish or beetroot on the point. Anchovy and gherkin, cut into small diamonds, may be placed between.   Grouse in Aspic.  Roast a brace of grouse, and skin them, and mask them with brown sauce in which aspic has been mixed. Cut some pistachio kernels into pretty shapes and ornament the birds. Take a large square tin mould (a baking tin will do), pour in a layer of pale aspic, and when it is all but cold place the grouse on it breast downward, one turned one way and one the other, then gradually fill it up with the aspic, and put on ice. Turn out and decorate the base with chopped aspic, truffles, parsley, and tomatoes.   Croustades of Grouse à la Diable.  Cut some fillets of grouse into cutlet shapes, also some slices of fried bread; sprinkle the latter with grated Parmesan cheese. Put the fillets of grouse on the cheesed bread. Mask them with a purée of tomatoes and a tiny dust of cayenne, then add a little more grated Parmesan, a little parsley, some breadcrumbs, and little pieces of butter. Salamander over and serve hot.   Grouse à l'Ecossaise.  Take a brace of grouse; put three ounces of good dripping or butter inside each, but not in the crop. Put them down to roast, and baste till cooked. Have a slice of toast in the pan under them just before they are cooked. Parboil the liver, pound with butter, salt, and cayenne, and spread it on the toast.   Grouse à la Financière.  Take a brace of grouse; boil the livers for a few minutes, and pound them in a mortar with three ounces of butter, a little salt, pepper, a grate of nutmeg, one tablespoonful of breadcrumbs, and three or four mushrooms. Stuff the grouse with this, truss and roast them, and baste plentifully. Take some sauce espagnole, add a few mushrooms and a dust of cayenne. Let all boil up together and serve with the grouse.   Friantine of Grouse.  Cut with two cutters, one larger than the other, twelve thin flat pieces of pastry, put on the centre of the largest a tablespoonful of quenelle meat and spread it out; in the centre of this put a tablespoonful of the breast of a grouse, cut up with two ounces of lean ham. Mix well and put it into a stewpan with three-quarters of a pint of white cream sauce. Warm up and let it get cold. Cover this with the smaller sized pieces of pastry, having wetted the inside of each with yolk of egg to make them adhere to the lowest pastry, press down tightly with the smallest cutters, and cut the bottom pastry to the size of the smaller cutter. Egg and breadcrumb. Arrange them in a frying basket and fry in boiling lard a nice brown. Serve garnished with fried parsley.   Grouse Kromesquis.  Take the remains of cold grouse and mince it very fine. Mix with it a couple of tablespoonfuls of grated ham or tongue. Divide into small sausage shapes, dip each in batter, fry a pale golden colour and serve very hot, garnished with crisped parsley.   Grouse Marinaded.  German Recipe.  Hang the birds as long as possible, then pluck and draw them and wipe their insides with a soft cloth. Mince an onion; take about a dozen peppercorns, twenty juniper berries, three bayleaves, and put these into a gill of vinegar. Let the grouse soak in this for three days, turning them two or three times daily, and pouring the marinade over them. Stuff the birds with turkey forcemeat and lard the breasts. Place them in front of a clear fire, baste constantly, and serve with slices of lemon round the dish.   Grouse au Naturel.  Grouse should be wiped inside, but never washed. Have a brisk fire, and when the bird is trussed, place it before a brisk fire, and before it is taken down the breast should be basted with a little butter, and frothed and browned before it is sent up. A good sized grouse requires nearly three-quarters of an hour to cook it. Serve fried breadcrumbs and bread sauce with grouse.   Grouse Pie.  Take two or three grouse, cut off the wings and legs, and tuck the drumsticks in through a slit in the thigh; singe the birds; split them in halves; season them with pepper and salt. Place some pieces of very tender beefsteak at the bottom of a pie dish, add chopped mushrooms, parsley, shalot, and two teaspoonfuls of chutnee sauce, and sprinkle over the steak. Place the halves of the grouse neatly on the top; add a little more seasoning; moisten with sufficient gravy made from the necks, legs, and wings. Cover with puff paste, and bake for about an hour and a half.   Pressed Grouse.  Boil a brace of grouse till very tender; season, and then take away all the meat and pull it out very fine, removing all skin. Add to the liquor in which they were boiled a tablespoonful of gelatine for each three pounds of grouse, and keep stirring it in the boiling liquor till it is quite dissolved; place the grouse in a deep tin basin, and pour the liquor over it whilst hot; stir it well, so that the meat may become thoroughly saturated with the liquor,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31987"],["title","Territory in Bird Life (#1)"],["body","general grounds, to give some explanation of what the word is intended to represent and some account of the exact position that representation is supposed to occupy in the drama of bird life.  The word is capable of much expansion. There cannot be territories without boundaries of some description; there cannot well be boundaries without disputes arising as to those boundaries; nor, one would imagine, can there be disputes without consciousness as a factor entering into the situation; and so on, until by a simple mental process we conceive of a state in bird life analogous to that which we know to be customary amongst ourselves. Now, although the term \"breeding territory,\" when applied to the sexual life of birds, is not altogether a happy one, it is difficult to know how otherwise to give expression to the facts observed. Let it then be clearly understood that the expression \"securing a territory\" is used to denote a process, or rather part of a process, which, in order to insure success to the individual in the attainment of reproduction, has been gradually evolved to meet the exigencies of diverse circumstances. Regarded thus, we avoid the risk of conceiving of the act of securing a territory as a detached event in the life of a bird, and avoid, I hope, the risk of a conception based upon the meaning of the word when used to describe human as opposed to animal procedure.  Success in the attainment of reproduction is rightly considered to be the goal towards which many processes in nature are tending. But what is meant by success? Is it determined by the actual discharge of the sexual function? So many and so wonderful are the contrivances which have slowly been evolved to insure this discharge, that it is scarcely surprising to find attention focused upon this one aspect of the problem. Yet a moment's reflection will show that so limited a definition of the term \"success\" can only be held to apply to certain forms of life; for where the young have to be cared for, fostered, and protected from molestation for periods of varying lengths, the actual discharge of the sexual function marks but one stage in a process which can only succeed if all the contributory factors adequately meet the essential conditions of the continuance of the species.  Securing a territory is then part of a process which has for its goal the successful rearing of offspring. In this process the functioning of the primary impulse, the acquirement of a place suitable for breeding purposes, the advent of a female, the discharge of the sexual function, the construction of the nest, and the rearing of offspring follow one another in orderly sequence. But since we know so little of the organic changes which determine sexual behaviour, and have no means of ascertaining the nature of the impulse which is first aroused, we can only deal with the situation from the point at which the internal organic changes reflect themselves in the behaviour to a degree which is visible to an external observer. That point is reached when large numbers of species, forsaking the normal routine of existence to which they have been accustomed for some months, suddenly adopt a radical change in their mode of behaviour. How is this change made known to us? By vast numbers of individuals hurrying from one part of the globe to another, from one country to another, and even from mid-ocean to the coasts; by detachments travelling from one district to another; by isolated individuals deserting this place for that; by all those movements, in fact, which the term migration, widely applied, is held to denote. Now the impulse which prompts these travelling hosts must be similar in kind whether the journey be long or short; and it were better, one would think, to regard such movements as a whole than to fix the attention on some one particular journey which fills us with amazement on account of the magnitude of the distance traversed or the nature of the difficulties overcome. For, after all, what does each individual seek? There may be some immature birds which, though they have not reached the necessary stage of development, happen to fall in with others in whom the impulse is strong and are led by them--they know not where. But the majority seek neither continent nor country, neither district nor locality is their aim, but a place wherein the rearing of offspring can be safely accomplished; and the search for this place is the earliest visible manifestation in many species of the reawakening of the sexual instinct.  The movements of each individual are then directed towards a similar goal, namely, the occupation of a definite station; and this involves for many species a distinct change in the routine of behaviour to which previously they had been accustomed. Observe, for example, one of the numerous flocks of Finches that roam about the fields throughout the winter. Though it may be composed of large numbers of individuals of different kinds, yet the various units form an amicable society actuated by one motive--the procuring of food. And since it is to the advantage of all that the individual should be subordinated to the welfare of the community as a whole there is no dissension, apart from an occasional quarrel here and there.  In response, however, to some internal organic change, which occurs early in the season, individuality emerges as a factor in the developing situation, and one by one the males betake themselves to secluded positions, where each one, occupying a limited area, isolates itself from companions. Thereafter we no longer find that certain fields are tenanted by flocks of greater or less dimensions, while acres of land are uninhabited, but we observe that the hedgerows and thickets are divided up into so many territories, each one of which contains its owner. This procedure, with of course varying detail, is typical of that of many species that breed in Western Europe. And since such a radical departure from the normal routine of behaviour could scarcely appear generation after generation in so many widely divergent forms, and still be so uniform in occurrence each returning season, if it were not founded upon some congenital basis, it is probable that the journey, whether it be the extensive one of the Warbler or the short one of the Reed-Bunting, is undertaken in response to some inherited disposition, and probable also that the disposition bears some relation to the few acres in which the bird ultimately finds a resting place. Whilst for the purpose of the theory I shall give expression to this behaviour in terms of that theory, and speak of it as a disposition to secure a territory, using the word disposition, which has been rendered current in recent discussion, for that part of the inherited nature which has been organised to subserve a specific biological purpose--strict compliance with the rules of psychological analysis requires a simpler definition; let us therefore say \"disposition to remain in a particular place in a particular environment.\"  But even granting that this disposition forms part of the hereditary equipment of the bird, how is the process of reproduction furthered? The mere fact of remaining in or about a particular spot cannot render the attainment of reproduction any less arduous, and may indeed add to the difficulties, for any number of individuals might congregate together and mutually affect one another's interests. A second disposition comes, however, into functional activity at much the same stage of sexual development, and manifests itself in the male's intolerance of other individuals. And the two combined open up an avenue through which the individual can approach the goal of reproduction. In terms of the theory I shall refer to this second disposition as the one which is concerned with the defence of the territory.  Broadly speaking, these two dispositions may be regarded as the basis upon which the breeding territory is founded. Yet inasmuch as the survival value of the dispositions themselves must have depended upon the success of the process as a whole, it is manifest that peculiar significance must not be attached to just the area occupied, which happens to be so susceptible of observation; other contributory factors must also receive attention, for the process is but an order of relationships in which the various units have each had their share in determining the nature and course of subsequent process, so that, as Dr Stout says, when they were modified, it was modified.  Now the male inherits a disposition which leads it to remain in a restricted area, but the disposition cannot determine the extent of that area. How then are the boundaries fixed? That they are sometimes adhered to with remarkable precision, that they can only be encroached upon at the risk of a conflict--all of this can be observed with little difficulty. But if we regard them as so many lines definitely delimiting an area of which the bird is cognisant, we place the whole behaviour on a different level of mental development, and incidentally alter the complexion of the whole process. It would be a mistake, I think, to do this. Though conscious intention as a factor may enter the situation, there is no necessity for it to do so; there is no necessity, that is to say, for the bird to form a mental image of the area to be occupied and shape its course accordingly. The same result can be obtained without our having recourse to so complex a principle of explanation, and that by the law of habit formation. In common with other animals, birds are subject to this law in a marked degree. An acquired mode of activity becomes by repetition ingrained in the life of the individual, so that an action performed to-day is liable to be repeated to-morrow so long as it does not prejudice the existence or annul the fertility of the individual.  Let us see how this may have operated in determining the limits of the area acquired, and for this purpose let us"]]]
