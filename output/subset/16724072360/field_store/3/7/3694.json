On that fateful 4th August the British navy was concentrated in the North Sea, and the chance for a surprise attack by the German fleet, or an invasion of England by the Kaiser's armies, vanished for ever, and with this one chance went also all reasonable possibility of a crushing German victory.  Although during the years of bitter warfare which followed this silent _coup de main_ the German fleet many times showed signs of awakening ambition, it did not, after Jutland, dare to thrust even its vanguard far into the open sea. Behind its forts, mines and submarines it waited, growing weaker with the dry-rot of inaction, for the chance that fickle Fortune might place a single unit of the Allied fleet within easy reach of its whole mailed-fist.  With a great and modern fleet--the second strongest in the world--awaiting its chance less than twenty hours' steam from the coast of Great Britain, it quickly became evident that the old Mistress of the Seas would have to call upon her islanders to supply a \"new navy\" to scour the oceans while her main battle squadrons waited and watched for the second Trafalgar.  Faced, then, with the problem of a long blockade, a powerful fleet in readiness to strike at any weak or unduly exposed point of land or squadron, and with similar problems on a decreasing scale imposed by Austria in the Adriatic and by Turkey behind the Dardanelles, the work of the main battle fleets became well defined by the commonest laws of naval strategy.  All this without taking into account the widespread menace of submarines and mines, and, in the earlier stages of the war, the rounding-up of detached enemy squadrons, such as that under Von Spee in South American waters, and the protection of the transport and food ships from raiders like the _Wolfe_ and the _Moewe_.  The German High Command realised this as quickly as that of the Allies. Their oversea commerce was strangled within a few days of the Declaration of War with Great Britain, and their fleet was confined to harbour, with the exception of occasional operations against Russia in the Baltic. From the German standpoint the naval problem resolved itself into one of how best to strike at the lines of communication of the Allies, paying special attention, first, to the transport of troops, and, second, to England's food supply. As they alone knew to what extent they would violate the laws of war and of humanity, it became apparent that the submarine and the mine were the only possible weapons which could be used for this purpose in face of the superior fleets of the Allies. But the number of these weapons was strictly limited compared with the immense shipping resources at the command of the Western Powers, so one submarine must do the work of many, and an effort was made to accomplish this by a reign of sea terrorism and inhuman conduct unparalleled in the history of the world. It opened with the sinking of the _Lusitania_.  The Allies had secured and maintained the command of the sea, and _all that it implies_, but to do this with the certainty of correct strategy they had to dedicate almost their entire battle fleet to the purpose for which battle fleets have always been intended--the checkmating or annihilation of the opposing navy.  There came a second problem, however, one entirely new to sea warfare, and unconsidered or provided against in its strategic and tactical entirety because hitherto deemed too inhuman for modern war. This was the ruthless use of armed submarines against unarmed passenger and merchant ships, and the scattering broadcast over the seas, regardless of the lives and property of neutrals, of thousands of explosive mines.  The type of ship constructed exclusively for open sea warfare against surface adversaries was not the best answer to the submarine. The blockading of the hostile surface fleet did not prevent, or even greatly hinder, the free passage of submarine flotillas, and the building by Germany of under-water mine-layers enabled fields of these weapons to be laid anywhere within the carrier's radius of action.  In this way the second, or submarine, phase of the naval war opened, and it was to supplement the comparatively few fast destroyers and other suitable ships which could be spared from the main fleets that the \"new navy\" was formed.   THE SHIPS  The area of the North Sea alone exceeds 140,000 square miles, and when the whole vast stretch of water encompassed by what was known as the radius of action of hostile submarines, from their bases on the German, Belgian, Austrian, Turkish and Bulgarian coasts, had to be considered as a possible zone of operations for German and Austrian under-water flotillas, much of the water surface of the world was included. Likewise the network of sea communications on which the Allies depended for the maintenance of essential transport and communication comprised the pathways of the seven seas. To patrol all these routes adequately, and to guard the food and troop ships, hastening in large numbers to the aid of the Motherland from the most distant corners of the earth; to protect the 1500 miles sea frontier of the British Isles; to give timely aid to sinking or hard-pressed units of the mercantile fleet; to hound the submarine from the under-seas and to sweep clear, almost weekly, several thousand square miles of sea, from Belle Isle to Cape Town and the Orkneys to Colombo, required ships, not in tens, but in thousands. To find these in an incredibly short space of time became the primary naval need of the moment.  Who that lived through those days will forget the struggle to supply ships and guns? The searching of every harbour for craft, from motor boats to old-time sailing-ships, and from fishing craft to liners. The scouring of the Dominions and Colonies. How blessed was their aid! Help, generous and spontaneous, came from all quarters, including the most unexpected. Over five hundred fast patrol boats, or motor launches, in less than twelve months from Canada and America. Guns from Japan. Coasting steamers from India, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. Seaplanes from the Crown Colonies. Rifles from Canada. Machine guns from the United States. Ambulances from English and Colonial women's leagues. In fact, contributions to the \"new navy\" from all corners of the earth.  To patrol the coasts of Britain alone, and to keep its harbours and coastal trade routes clear of mines, needed over 3500 ships, with at least an equal number of guns, 30,000 rifles and revolvers, and millions of shells.  In addition to this huge fleet other smaller squadrons were required for the Mediterranean, the Suez Canal and Red Sea, the East and West Indies, the coasts of the Dominions and Colonies, and for the Russian lines of communication in the White Sea. For these oversea bases just under 1000 ships were required, exclusive of those locally supplied by the Dominions and Colonies themselves.  All this without considering the main battle fleets or, in fact, any portion of the regular navy, and the ships required for the transport of food, troops and munitions of war, together with their escorts. Some idea of the numbers engaged in keeping the Allies supplied with the diverse necessities of life and war may be gathered from the fact that the average sailings in and out of the harbours of the United Kingdom alone during the four years of war amounted to over 1200 a week.  The immense fleet forming the new navy was not homogeneous in design, power, appearance or, in fact, in anything except the spirit of the personnel and the flag beneath which they fought--and alas! nearly 4000 died. The squadrons, or units, as they were called, consisted of fine steam yachts, liners from the ocean trade routes, sturdy sea tramps, deep-sea trawlers, oilers, colliers, drifters, paddle steamers, and the more uniform and specially built fighting sloops, whalers, motor launches and coastal motor boats. The latter type of craft was aided by its great speed, nearly fifty miles an hour; but more about these ships and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29685"],["title","Submarine Warfare of To-day (#2)"],["body","curious armament later.   WAR BASES  The great auxiliary navy had to be built or obtained without depleting the ordinary mercantile fleets, and the shipbuilding and repairing yards, even in the smallest sea and river ports, worked day and night. The triumph was as wonderful as it was speedy. In less than fifteen months from August, 1914, the new navy was a gigantic force, and its operations extended from the Arctic Sea to the Equator. All units were armed, manned and linked up by wireless and a common cause.  Before this could be accomplished, however, the problem of maintaining this vast fleet and adequately controlling its operations had to be faced and overcome. The seas adjacent to the coasts of the United Kingdom, the Mediterranean Littoral and Colonial waters were divided into \"patrol areas\" on special secret charts, and each \"area\" had its own naval base, with harbour, stores, repairing and docking facilities, intelligence centre, wireless and signal stations, reserve of officers and men, social headquarters, workshops and medical department.  Each base was under the command of an admiral and staff, many of the former returning to duty, after several years of well-earned rest, as captains and commodores, with salaries commensurate with their reduced rank. Their staffs consisted of some six to twelve officers of the new navy, with possibly one or two from the \"pukka service,\" and their command often extended over many hundreds of square miles of submarine and mine infested sea.  Of these bases, which will be fully described in later chapters, there were about fifty, excluding the great dockyards and fleet headquarters, but inclusive of those situated overseas. When it is considered what a war base needs to make it an efficient rendezvous for some hundreds of ships and thousands of men, some idea of the gigantic task of organisation which their establishment, often in poorly equipped harbours and distant islands, required, not only in the first instance, but also with regard to maintenance and supplies, will be realised, perhaps, however, more fully when it is stated that the average ship needs a month spent in docking and overhauling at least once a year, and that the delicate and more speedy units of such a fleet need nearly four times that amount of attention.   HEADQUARTERS STAFF  One of the first requisites of the auxiliary navy was the creation of a headquarters staff at the Admiralty, London. This was formed from naval officers of experience both in the regular service and in the two reserves (R.N.R. and R.N.V.R.).  Forming an integral part of the great British or Allied armada, all operations were under the control of the Naval War Staff, but for purposes of more detailed organisation and administration additional departments were created which exercised direct jurisdiction over their respective fleets. The principal of these was known as the \"Auxiliary Patrol Office,\" under the Fourth Sea Lord and the Department of the Director of Minesweeping. These formed a part of the General Staff--if a military term is permissible--and both issued official publications periodically throughout the war, which served to keep the staffs of all the different war bases and the commanding officers of the thousands of ships informed as to current movements and ruses of the enemy.  It is unnecessary to detail more closely the work of these departments, especially as much has yet to be said before plunging into the maelstrom of war. A sufficient indication of the colossal nature of the work they were called upon to perform will be found in a moment's reflection of what the administration and control of such a large and nondescript fleet, spread over the world--from the White Sea to the East Indies--must have meant to the small staff allowed by the exigencies of an unparalleled war.   OFFICERS AND MEN  The greatest problem in modern naval war is, undoubtedly, the supply of trained men. For this reason it has been left to the last to describe how the difficulty was faced and overcome by England and her oversea Dominions in 1914.  Before doing so, however, it may be of interest to give here a few extracts from an excellent little official publication, showing how the British fleet was manned and expanded in bygone days of national peril[1]:            \"In time of war there has always been an intimate           connection between the Royal Navy and the Merchant           Service. Latterly, and more especially since the           Russian War of 1854 to 1856, this fact tended to           be forgotten, partly because men-of-war developed           on particular lines and became far more unlike           merchantmen than they had ever been before, and           also because, by the introduction of continuous           service, the personnel of the Navy seemed to have           developed into a separate caste, distinguished by           its associations, traditions and _esprit de           corps_, as much by its special training and           qualifications, from other seafaring men. This war           has proved once again, to such as needed proof,           that the two services cannot exist without each           other, and that the Sea Power of the Empire is not           its naval strength alone, but its maritime           strength. Even at the risk of insisting on the           obvious, it is necessary to repeat that, for an           Island Empire, a war at sea cannot be won merely           by the naval action which defeats the enemy; naval           successes are of value for the fruit they bear,           the chief of which is the power that they give to           the victor to maintain his own sea-borne trade and           to interrupt that of the enemy.            \"An elementary way of looking at the problems of           manning the Royal Navy and the Merchant Service           is to consider that there is in the country a           common stock of seamen, on which both can draw.           But this theory, like many others equally obvious           and tempting, has the disadvantage that it leaves           important factors out of account and, if worked           out, results in an absurdity. Thus, shortly before           war began there were in the country some 420,000           seamen, of whom one-third were in the Navy and           two-thirds engaged in merchant ships and fishing           vessels. There was no considerable body of           unemployed seamen. During the war the personnel of           the Navy was expanded to something like the           420,000 which represents the common stock of           seamen. Therefore, if the theory met the case,           there would have been no men left for the Merchant           Service. But the merchant ships, in spite of           difficulty and danger, continued to run, employing           great numbers of men. And we must not forget to           take into account the number of men, amounting to           48,000 killed and 4500 prisoners of war, who have           been lost in the two services during the war. So           it comes to this, that the common stock of seamen,           or at least of men fit to man ships, has expanded           during the war by more than 50 per cent. Whence           came these extra men? Clearly for the most part           from the non-seafaring classes.            \"The Navy in November, 1918, employed some 80,000           officers and men from the Merchant Service--viz.           20,000 R.N.R. ratings, 36,000 Trawler Reserve, and           20,000 mercantile seamen and firemen on Transport           agreements, plus the officers. If the supposition,           made in the absence of statistics, is correct           that at this time the number of men in the           Merchant Service itself had decreased           proportionately to the loss of tonnage, it would           seem that the Merchant Service needed no           considerable inflow of men during the war. In           other words, most of those added to the stock of           seamen during the war must have gone into the           Navy. This corresponds with known fact: the Navy           has, in addition to the Reserve men already           mentioned, nearly 200,000 men to demobilise in           order to put its personnel on the footing on which           it stood when war broke out.            \"It will be of interest to see how the personnel           of the Navy expanded in former wars, and how at           the peace it was invariably reduced to something           like its pre-war figures.
