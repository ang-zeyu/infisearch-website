If we carelessly cut or bruise our flesh, pain and soreness follow, to induce us to be more careful in the future; or, if we take improper food into the stomach, we are warned, perhaps immediately by a friendly pain, that we have violated an organic law.  16. Sometimes, however, the penalty does not directly follow the sin, and it requires great physiological knowledge to be able to trace the effect to its true cause. If we possess good constitutions, we are responsible for most of our sickness; and bad constitutions, or hereditary diseases, are but the results of the same great law,--the iniquities of the parents being visited on the children. In this view of the subject, how important is the study of physiology and hygiene! For how can we expect to obey laws which we do not understand?    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  15. What is said of disease? 16. Why is the study of physiology and hygiene important?    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=     CHAPTER II.  STRUCTURE OF MAN,   17. In the structure of the human body, there is a union of fluids and solids. These are essentially the same, for the one is readily changed into the other. There is no fluid that does not contain solid matter in solution, and no solid matter that is destitute of fluid.  18. In different individuals, and at different periods of life the proportion of fluids and solids varies. In youth, the fluids are more abundant than in advanced life. For this reason, the limbs in childhood are soft and round, while in old age they assume a hard and wrinkled appearance.  19. The fluids not only contain the materials from which every part of the body is formed, but they are the medium for conveying the waste, decayed particles of matter from the system. They have various names, according to their nature and function; as, the blood, and the bile.  20. The solids are formed from the fluids, and consequently they are reduced, by chemical analysis, to the same ultimate elements. The particles of matter in solids are arranged variously; sometimes in _fi´bres_, (threads,) sometimes in _lam´i-næ_, (plates,) sometimes homogeneously, as in basement membranes. (Appendix A.)  21. The parts of the body are arranged into _Fi´bres_, _Fas-cic´u-li_, _Tis´sues_, _Or´gans_, _Ap-pa-ra´tus-es_, and _Sys´tems_.    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  17. What substances enter into the structure of the human body? Are they essentially the same? 18. What is said of these substances at different periods of life? 19. What offices do the fluids of the system perform? 20. What is said of the solids? How are the particles of matter arranged in solids? 21. Give an arrangement of the parts of the body.    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  22. A FIBRE is a thread of exceeding fineness. It is either cylindriform or flattened.  23. A FASCICULUS is the term applied to several fibres united. Its general characteristics are the same as fibres.  24. A TISSUE is a term applied to several different solids of the body.  25. An ORGAN is composed of tissues so arranged as to form an instrument designed for action. The action of an organ is called its _function_, or use.  _Example._ The liver is an organ, and the secretion of the bile from the blood is one of its functions.[1]     [1] Where examples and observations are given or experiments        suggested, let the pupil mention other analogous ones.  26. An APPARATUS is an assemblage of organs designed to produce certain results.  _Example._ The digestive apparatus consists of the teeth, stomach, liver, &c., all of which aid in the digestion of food.  [Illustration: Fig. 2. Represents a portion of broken muscular fibre of animal life, (magnified about seven hundred diameters.)]  27. The term SYSTEM is applied to an assemblage of organs arranged according to some plan, or method; as the nervous system, the respiratory system.    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  22. Define a fibre. 23. Define a fasciculus. 24. Define a tissue. 25. Define an organ. What is the action of an organ called? Give examples. _Mention other examples._ 26. What is an apparatus? Give an example 27. How is the term system applied?    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  28. A TISSUE is a simple form of organized animal substance. It is flexible, and formed of fibres interwoven in various ways; as, the cellular tissue.  29. However various all organs may appear in their structure and composition, it is now supposed that they can be reduced to a few tissues; as, the _Cel´lu-lar_, _Os´se-ous_, _Mus´cu-lar_, _Mu´cous_, _Ner´vous_, &c. (Appendix B.)  30. The CELLULAR TISSUE,[2] now called the _areolar tissue_, consists of small fibres, or bands, interlaced in every direction, so as to form a net-work, with numerous interstices that communicate freely with each other. These interstices are filled, during life, with a fluid resembling the serum of blood. The use of the areolar tissue is to connect together organs and parts of organs, and to envelop, fix, and protect the vessels and nerves of organs.     [2] The _Cellular_, _Serous_, _Dermoid_, _Fibrous_, and _Mucous        tissues_ are very generally called _membranes_.  [Illustration: Fig. 3. Arrangement of fibres of the cellular tissue magnified one hundred and thirty diameters.]    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  28. What is a tissue? 29. What is said respecting the structure and composition of the various organs? Name the primary membranes. 30. Describe the cellular tissue. How are the cells imbedded in certain tissues? Give observation 1st, relative to the cellular tissue.    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  _Observations._ 1st. When this fluid becomes too great in quantity, in consequence of disease, the patient labors under general dropsy. The swelling of the feet when standing, and their return to a proper shape during the night, so often noticed in feeble persons, furnish a striking proof both of the existence and peculiarity of this tissue, which allows the fluid to flow from cell to cell, until it settles in the lower extremities.  2d. The free communication between the cells is still more remarkable in regard to air. Sometimes, when an accidental opening has been made from the air-cells of the lungs into the contiguous cellular tissue, the air in respiration has penetrated every part until the whole body is so inflated as to occasion suffocation. Butchers often avail themselves of the knowledge of this fact, and inflate their meat to give it a fat appearance.  31. \"Although this tissue enters into the composition of all organs, it never loses its own structure, nor participates in the functions of the organ of which it forms a part. Though present in the nerves, it does not share in their sensibility; and though it accompanies every muscle and every muscular fibre, it does not partake of the irritability which belongs to these organs.\"  32. Several varieties of tissue are formed from the cellular; as, the _Se´rous_, _Der´moid_, _Fi´brous_, and several others.  33. The SEROUS TISSUE lines all the closed, or sac-like cavities of the body; as, the chest, joints, and abdomen. It not only lines these cavities, but is reflected, and invests the organs contained in them. The liver and the lungs are thus invested. This membrane is of a whitish color, and smooth on its free surfaces. These surfaces are kept moist, and prevented from adhering by a _se´rous_ fluid, which is separated from the blood. The use of this membrane is to separate organs and also to facilitate the movement of one part upon another, by means of its moist, polished surfaces.    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  Give observation 2d. 31. What is said of the identity of this tissue? 32. Name the varieties of tissue formed from the cellular. 33. Where is the serous tissue found? What two offices does it perform? Give its structure. What is the use of this membrane?    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  34. The DERMOID TISSUE covers the outside of the body. It is called the _cu´tis_, (skin.) This membrane is continuous with the mucous at the various orifices of the body, and in these situations, from the similarity of their structure, it is difficult to distinguish between them.  _Observations._ 1st. In consequence of the continuity and similarity of structure, there is close sympathy between the mucous and dermoid membranes. If the functions of the skin are disturbed, as by a chill, it will frequently cause a catarrh, (cold,) or diarrhoea. Again, in consequence of this intimate sympathy, these complaints can be relieved by exciting a free action in the vessels of the skin.  2d. It is no uncommon occurrence that diseased or irritated conditions of the mucous membrane of the stomach or intestines produce diseases or irritations of the skin, as is seen in the rashes attendant on dyspepsia, and eating certain species of fish. These eruptions of the skin can be relieved by removing the diseased condition of the stomach.  35. The FIBROUS TISSUE consists of longitudinal, parallel fibres, which are closely united. These fibres, in some situations, form a thin, dense, strong membrane, like that which lines the internal surface of the skull, or invests the external surface of the bones. In other instances, they form strong, inelastic bands, called _lig´a-ments_, which bind one bone to another. This tissue also forms _ten´dons_, (white cords,) by which the muscles are attached to the bones.  _Observation._ In the disease called rheumatism, the fibrous tissue is the part principally affected; hence the joints, where this tissue is most abundant, suffer most from this affection.    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  34. Describe the dermoid tissue. What is said of the sympathy between the functions of the skin and mucous membrane? Give another instance of the sympathy between these membranes. 35. Of what does the fibrous tissue consist? How do these appear in some situations? How in others? What tissue is generally affected in rheumatism?    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  36.

Walter stood on the stern and beheld, yet more with the mind of him than with his eyes; for it all seemed but the double of what the other ship had done; and the thought of it as if the twain were as beads strung on one string and led away by it into the same place, and thence to go in the like order, and so on again and again, and never to draw nigher to each other.     CHAPTER III: WALTER HEARETH TIDINGS OF THE DEATH OF HIS FATHER   Fast sailed the Katherine over the seas, and nought befell to tell of, either to herself or her crew.  She came to one cheaping-town and then to another, and so on to a third and a fourth; and at each was buying and selling after the manner of chapmen; and Walter not only looked on the doings of his father's folk, but lent a hand, what he might, to help them in all matters, whether it were in seaman's craft, or in chaffer.  And the further he went and the longer the time wore, the more he was eased of his old trouble wherein his wife and her treason had to do.  But as for the other trouble, to wit his desire and longing to come up with those three, it yet flickered before him; and though he had not seen them again as one sees people in the streets, and as if he might touch them if he would, yet were their images often before his mind's eye; and yet, as time wore, not so often, nor so troublously; and forsooth both to those about him and to himself, he seemed as a man well healed of his melancholy mood.  Now they left that fourth stead, and sailed over the seas and came to a fifth, a very great and fair city, which they had made more than seven months from Langton on Holm; and by this time was Walter taking heed and joyance in such things as were toward in that fair city, so far from his kindred, and especially he looked on the fair women there, and desired them, and loved them; but lightly, as befalleth young men.  Now this was the last country whereto the Katherine was boun; so there they abode some ten months in daily chaffer, and in pleasuring them in beholding all that there was of rare and goodly, and making merry with the merchants and the towns-folk, and the country-folk beyond the gates, and Walter was grown as busy and gay as a strong young man is like to be, and was as one who would fain be of some account amongst his own folk.  But at the end of this while, it befell on a day, as he was leaving his hostel for his booth in the market, and had the door in his hand, there stood before him three mariners in the guise of his own country, and with them was one of clerkly aspect, whom he knew at once for his father's scrivener, Arnold Penstrong by name; and when Walter saw him his heart failed him and he cried out: \"Arnold, what tidings?  Is all well with the folk at Langton?\"  Said Arnold: \"Evil tidings are come with me; matters are ill with thy folk; for I may not hide that thy father, Bartholomew Golden, is dead, God rest his soul.\"  At that word it was to Walter as if all that trouble which but now had sat so light upon him, was once again fresh and heavy, and that his past life of the last few months had never been; and it was to him as if he saw his father lying dead on his bed, and heard the folk lamenting about the house.  He held his peace awhile, and then he said in a voice as of an angry man:  \"What, Arnold! and did he die in his bed, or how? for he was neither old nor ailing when we parted.\"  Said Arnold: \"Yea, in his bed he died: but first he was somewhat sword- bitten.\"  \"Yea, and how?\" quoth Walter.  Said Arnold: \"When thou wert gone, in a few days' wearing, thy father sent thy wife out of his house back to her kindred of the Reddings with no honour, and yet with no such shame as might have been, without blame to us of those who knew the tale of thee and her; which, God-a-mercy, will be pretty much the whole of the city.\"  \"Nevertheless, the Reddings took it amiss, and would have a mote with us Goldings to talk of booting.  By ill-luck we yea-said that for the saving of the city's peace.  But what betid?  We met in our Gild-hall, and there befell the talk between us; and in that talk certain words could not be hidden, though they were none too seemly nor too meek.  And the said words once spoken drew forth the whetted steel; and there then was the hewing and thrusting!  Two of ours were slain outright on the floor, and four of theirs, and many were hurt on either side.  Of these was thy father, for as thou mayst well deem, he was nought backward in the fray; but despite his hurts, two in the side and one on the arm, he went home on his own feet, and we deemed that we had come to our above.  But well-a- way! it was an evil victory, whereas in ten days he died of his hurts. God have his soul!  But now, my master, thou mayst well wot that I am not come to tell thee this only, but moreover to bear the word of the kindred, to wit that thou come back with me straightway in the swift cutter which hath borne me and the tidings; and thou mayst look to it, that though she be swift and light, she is a keel full weatherly.\"  Then said Walter: \"This is a bidding of war.  Come back will I, and the Reddings shall wot of my coming.  Are ye all-boun?\"  \"Yea,\" said Arnold, \"we may up anchor this very day, or to-morrow morn at latest.  But what aileth thee, master, that thou starest so wild over my shoulder?  I pray thee take it not so much to heart!  Ever it is the wont of fathers to depart this world before their sons.\"  But Walter's visage from wrathful red had become pale, and he pointed up street, and cried out: \"Look! dost thou see?\"  \"See what, master?\" quoth Arnold: \"what! here cometh an ape in gay raiment; belike the beast of some jongleur.  Nay, by God's wounds! 'tis a man, though he be exceeding mis-shapen like a very devil.  Yea and now there cometh a pretty maid going as if she were of his meney; and lo! here, a most goodly and noble lady!  Yea, I see; and doubtless she owneth both the two, and is of the greatest of the folk of this fair city; for on the maiden's ankle I saw an iron ring, which betokeneth thralldom amongst these aliens.  But this is strange! for notest thou not how the folk in the street heed not this quaint show; nay not even the stately lady, though she be as lovely as a goddess of the gentiles, and beareth on her gems that would buy Langton twice over; surely they must be over- wont to strange and gallant sights.  But now, master, but now!\"  \"Yea, what is it?\" said Walter.  \"Why, master, they should not yet be gone out of eye-shot, yet gone they are.  What is become of them, are they sunk into the earth?\"  \"Tush, man!\" said Walter, looking not on Arnold, but still staring down the street; \"they have gone into some house while thine eyes were turned from them a moment.\"  \"Nay, master, nay,\" said Arnold, \"mine eyes were not off them one instant of time.\"  \"Well,\" said Walter, somewhat snappishly, \"they are gone now, and what have we to do to heed such toys, we with all this grief and strife on our hands?  Now would I be alone to turn the matter of thine errand over in my mind.  Meantime do thou tell the shipmaster Geoffrey and our other folk of these tidings, and thereafter get thee all ready; and come hither to me before sunrise to-morrow, and I shall be ready for my part; and so sail we back to Langton.\"  Therewith he turned him back into the house, and the others went their ways; but Walter sat alone in his chamber a long while, and pondered these things in his mind.  And whiles he made up his mind that he would think no more of the vision of those three, but would fare back to Langton, and enter into the strife with the Reddings and quell them, or die else.  But lo, when he was quite steady in this doom, and his heart was lightened thereby, he found that he thought no more of the Reddings and their strife, but as matters that were passed and done with, and that now he was thinking and devising if by any means he might find out in what land dwelt those three.  And then again he strove to put that from him, saying that what he had seen was but meet for one brainsick, and a dreamer of dreams.  But furthermore he thought, Yea, and was Arnold, who this last time had seen the images of those three, a dreamer of waking dreams? for he was nought wonted in such wise; then thought he: At least I am well content that he spake to me of their likeness, not I to him; for so I may tell that there was at least something before my eyes which grew not out of mine own brain.  And yet again, why should I follow them; and what should I get by it; and indeed how shall I set about it?  Thus he turned the matter over and over; and at last, seeing that if he grew no foolisher over it, he grew no wiser, he became weary thereof, and bestirred him, and saw to the trussing up of his goods, and made all ready for his departure, and so wore the day and slept at nightfall; and at daybreak comes Arnold to lead him to their keel, which hight the Bartholomew.  He tarried nought, and with few farewells went aboard ship, and an hour after they were in the open sea with the ship's head turned toward Langton on Holm.     CHAPTER IV: STORM BEFALLS THE BARTHOLOMEW, AND SHE IS DRIVEN OFF HER COURSE   Now swift sailed the Bartholomew for four weeks toward the north-west with a fair wind, and all was well with ship and crew.  Then the wind died out on even of a day, so that the ship scarce made way at all, though she rolled in a great swell of the sea, so great, that it seemed to ridge all the main athwart.  Moreover"]]]
