How did you find out about the cubicles?\"  \"I took a chance and fed him a Moment of Truth.\"  \"With Fluel,\" Quillan said thoughtfully, \"that was taking a chance!\"  \"Believe me, I was aware of it! I've run into card-carrying sadists before, but the Duke's the only one who scares me silly. But it did work. He dropped in for a about a minute and a half, and came out without noticing a thing. Meanwhile, I'd got the answers to a few questions. The bomb with which they're planning to mop up behind them already has been planted up here in the normspace section. Fluel didn't know where; armaments experts took care of it. It's armed now. There's a firing switch on each of their ships, and both switches have to be tripped before the thing goes off. Part of what they're after is in those Pendrake rest cubicles--\"  \"Part of it?\" Quillan asked.  \"Uh-huh. An even hundred similar cubicles will be unloaded from the _Camelot_--the bulk of the haul; which is why Nome Lancion is supervising things on the liner. I started to ask what was in the cubicles, but I saw Fluel was beginning to lose that blank look they have under Truth, and switched back to light chitchat just before he woke up. Yaco's paying for the job--or rather, it _will_ pay for the stuff, on delivery, and no questions asked.\"  \"That's not very much help, is it?\" Quillan said after a moment. \"Something a big crooked industrial combine like Yaco thinks it can use--\"  \"It must expect to be able to use it to extremely good advantage,\" Reetal said. \"The Brotherhood will collect thirty million credits for their part of the operation. The commodore's group presumably won't do any worse.\" She glanced past Quillan toward the room portal. \"It's O.K., Heraga! Come in.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Sher Heraga was a lean, dark-skinned little man with a badly bent nose, black curly hair, and a nervous look. He regretted, he said, that he hadn't been able to uncover anything which might be a lead to the location of the bomb. Apparently, it wasn't even being guarded. And, of course, a bomb of the size required here would be quite easy to conceal.  \"If they haven't placed guards over it,\" Reetal agreed, \"it'll take blind luck to spot it! Unless we can get hold of one of the men who knows where it's planted--\"  There was silence for some seconds. Then Quillan said, \"Well, if we can't work out a good plan, we'd better see what we can do with one of the bad ones. Are the commodore's security men wearing uniforms?\"  Heraga shook his head, \"Not the ones I saw.\"  \"Then here's an idea,\" Quillan said. \"As things stand, barging into the Executive Block with a small armed group can't accomplish much. It might be more interesting than sitting around and waiting to be blown up, but it still would be suicide. However, if we could get things softened up and disorganized in there first--\"  \"Softened up and disorganized how?\" Reetal asked.  \"We can use that notion you had of having Heraga float in another diner. This time, I'm on board--in a steward's uniform, in case the guards check.\"  \"They didn't the first time,\" Heraga said.  \"Sloppy of them. Well, they're just gun hands. Anyway, once we're inside I shuck off the uniform and get out. Heraga delivers his goodies, and leaves again--\"  Reetal gave him a look. \"You'll get shot down the instant you're seen, dope!\"  \"I think not. There're two groups in there--around a hundred men in all--and they haven't had time to get well acquainted yet. I'll have my gun in sight, and anyone who sees me should figure I belong to the other group, until I run into one of the Brotherhood boys who knows me personally.\"  \"Then that's when you get shot down. I understand the last time you and the Duke of Fluel met, he woke up with lumps.\"  \"The Duke doesn't love me,\" Quillan admitted. \"But there's nothing personal between me and Movaine or Marras Cooms--and I'll have a message for Movaine.\"  \"What kind of a message?\"  \"I'll have to play that by ear a little. It depends on how things look in there. But I have a few ideas, based on what you've learned of the operation. Now, just what I can do when I get that far, I don't know yet. I'll simply try to louse the deal up as much as I can. That may take time, and, of course, it might turn out to be impossible to get word out to you.\"  \"So what do we do meanwhile?\" Reetal asked. \"If we start lining up our attack group immediately, and then there's no action for another five or six hours, there's always the chance of a leak, with around twenty people in the know.\"  \"And if there's a leak,\" Quillan agreed, \"we've probably had it. No, you'd better wait with that! If I'm not out, and you haven't heard from me before the _Camelot_'s actually due to dock, Heraga can still take the group--everyone but yourself--in as scheduled.\"  \"Why everyone but me?\" Reetal asked.  \"If nothing else works, you might find some way of getting a warning to the liner's security force after they've docked. It isn't much of a possibility, but we can't afford to throw it away.\"  \"Yes, I see.\" Reetal looked reflective. \"What do you think, Heraga?\"  The little man shrugged. \"You told me that Mr. Quillan is not inexperienced in dealing with, ah, his enemies. If he feels he might accomplish something in the Executive Block, I'm in favor of the plan. The situation certainly could hardly become worse.\"  \"That's the spirit!\" Quillan approved. \"The positive outlook--that's what a think like this mainly takes. Can you arrange for the diner and the uniform?\"  \"Oh, yes,\" Heraga said, \"I've had myself put in charge of that detail, naturally.\"  \"Then what can you tell me about the Executive Block's layout?\"  Reetal stood up. \"Come over to the desk,\" she said. \"We've got diagrams.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"The five levels, as you see,\" Heraga was explaining a few moments later, \"are built directly into the curve of the Star's shells. Level Five, on the top, is therefore quite small. The other levels are fairly extensive. Two, Three, and Four could each accommodate a hundred men comfortably. These levels contain mainly living quarters, private offices, and the like. The Brotherhood men appear to be occupying the fourth level, Velladon's group the second. The third may be reserved for meetings between representatives of the two groups. All three of these levels are connected by single-exit portals to the large entrance area on the ground level.  \"The portals stood open when I went in earlier today, and there were about twenty armed men lounging about the entrance hall. I recognized approximately half of them as being members of the Star's security force. The others were unfamiliar.\" Heraga cleared his throat. \"There is a possibility that the two groups do not entirely trust each other.\"  Quillan nodded. \"If they're playing around with something like sixty million CR, anybody would have to be crazy to trust the Brotherhood of Beldon. The transmitter room and the control officers are guarded, too?\"  \"Yes, but not heavily,\" Heraga said. \"There seem to be only a few men stationed at each of those points. Ostensibly, they're there as a safe-guard--in case the imaginary raiders attempt to break out of the subspace section.\"  \"What's the arrangement of the ordinary walk-in tube portals in the Executive Block?\"  \"There is one which interconnects the five levels. On each of the lower levels, there are, in addition, several portals which lead out to various points in the Seventh Star Hotel. On the fifth level, there is only one portal of this kind. Except for the portal which operates between the different levels in the Executive Block, all of them have been rendered unusable at present.\"  \"Unusable in what way?\"  \"They have been sealed off on the Executive Block side.\"  \"Can you get me a diagram of the entry and exit systems those outgoing portals connect with?\" Quillan asked. \"I might turn one of them usable again.\"  \"Yes, I can do that.\"  \"How about the communication possibilities?\"  \"The ComWeb system is functioning normally on the second, third, and fourth levels. It has been shut off on the first level--to avoid the spread of 'alarming rumors' by office personnel. There is no ComWeb on the fifth level.\"  Reetal said, \"We'll shift our operating headquarters back to my registered suite then. The ComWebs are turned off in these vacant sections. I'll stay in the other suite in case you find a chance to signal in.\"  Heraga left a few minutes later to make his arrangements. Reetal smiled at Quillan, a little dubiously.  \"Good luck, guy,\" she said. \"Anything else to settle before you start off?\"  Quillan nodded. \"Couple of details. If you're going to be in your regular suite, and Fluel finds himself with some idle time on hand, he might show up for the dalliance you mentioned.\"  Reetal's smile changed slightly. Her left hand fluffed the hair at the back of her head, flicked down again. There was a tiny click, and Quillan looked at a small jeweled hair-clasp in her palm, its needle beak pointing at him.  \"It hasn't got much range,\" Reetal said, \"but within ten feet it will scramble the Duke's brains just as thoroughly as they need to be scrambled.\"  \"Good enough,\" Quillan said. \"Just don't give that boy the ghost of a chance, doll. He has a rep for playing very unnice games with the ladies.\"  \"I know his reputation.\" Reetal replaced the tiny gun in her hair. \"Anything else?\"  \"Yes. Let's look in on the Kinmarten chick for a moment. If she's awake, she may have remembered something or other by now that she didn't think to tell you.\"  They found Solvey Kinmarten awake, and tearfully glad to see Reetal. Quillan was introduced as a member of the legal profession who would do what he could for Solvey and her husband. Solvey frowned prettily, trying very hard to remember anything that might be of use. But it appeared that she had told Reetal all she knew.         *       *       *       *       *  The blue"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30497"],["title","The Foreign Hand Tie (#1)"],["body","htened. \"Describe him!\"  Lenny, eyes still closed, said: \"Five feet ten, heavy set, gray hair, dark-rimmed glasses, brown suit, flashy necktie. By the cut of his clothes, I'd say he was either British or American, probably American. Fifty-five or fifty-six years old.\"  It was obvious to the Secretary of Defense and to Colonel Spaulding that the President was suppressing some inward excitement.  \"Very good, Mr. Poe!\" he said. \"Now, you will find a box of colored pencils and a sketch pad in that desk over there. Can you draw me a fairly accurate sketch of that man?\"  \"Yeah, sure.\" Lenny opened his eyes, moved over to the desk, took out the pencils and sketch pad, and went to work. He had to close his eyes occasionally, but his work was incredibly rapid and, at the same time, almost photographically accurate.  As the picture took form, the President's inward excitement increased perceptibly. When it was finally finished, Lenny handed the sketch to the President without a word.  The President took it eagerly and his face broke out in his famous grin. \"Excellent! Perfect!\" He looked at Lenny. \"Your brother hasn't attracted the man's attention in any way, has he?\"  \"Nope,\" said Lenny.  \"Fine. The experiment is over. Relay my thanks to your brother. He can go ahead with whatever he was doing now.\"  \"I don't quite understand,\" said the Secretary of State.  \"I felt it necessary to make one final experiment of my own devising,\" the President said. \"I wanted Raphael Poe to go to a particular place at a particular time, with no advance warning, to transmit a picture of something he had never seen before. I arranged this test myself, and I am positive that there could be no trickery.\"  \"Never seen before?\" the Secretary repeated bewilderedly. He gestured at the sketch. \"Why, that's obviously Bill Donovan, of the Moscow delegation. Poe could have seen a photograph of him somewhere before.\"  \"Even so,\" the President pointed out, \"there would be no way of knowing that he would be at that spot. But that's beside the point. Look at that necktie!\"  \"I had noticed it,\" the Defense Secretary admitted.  It was certainly an outstanding piece of neckwear. As drawn by Leonard Poe, it was a piece of brilliant chartreuse silk, fully three and a half inches wide at its broadest. Against that background, rose-pink nude girls were cavorting with pale mauve satyrs.  \"That tie,\" said the President, \"was sent to me fifteen years ago by on of my constituents, when I was in Congress. I never wore it, of course, but it would have been criminal to have thrown away such a magnificently obscene example of bad taste as that.  \"I sent it to Donovan in a sealed diplomatic pouch by special courier, with instructions to wear it at this time. He, of course, has no idea why he is standing there. He is merely obeying orders.  \"Gentlemen, this is completely convincing to me. Absolutely no one but myself knew what I had in mind. It would have required telepathy even to cheat.  \"Thank you very much, Mr. Poe. Colonel Spaulding, you may proceed with Operation Mapcase as planned.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"Dr. Malekrinova, will you initial these requisition forms, please.\"  Dr. Sonya Malekrinova, a dowdy-looking, middle-aged woman with unplucked eyebrows and a mole on her chin, adjusted her steel-rimmed glasses, took the proffered papers from the clerk, ran her eyes over them, and then put her initials on the bottom of each page.  \"Thank you, Comrade Doctor,\" said the clerk when she handed back the sheaf of papers.  \"Certainly, Comrade.\"  And the two of them went about their business.  Not far away, in the Cathedral of St. Basil, Vladimir Turenski, alias Raphael Poe, was also apparently going about his business. The cathedral had not seen nor heard the Liturgy of the Russian Orthodox Church or any other church, for a good many decades. The Bolsheviks, in their zeal to protect the citizens of the Soviet Unions from the pernicious influence of religion, had converted it into a museum as soon as possible.  It was the function of _Tovarishch_ Turenski to push a broom around the floors of the museum, and this he did with great determination and efficiency. He also cleaned windows and polished metalwork when the occasion demanded. He was only one of a large crew of similarly employed men, but he was a favorite with the Head Custodian, who not only felt sorry for the simple-minded deaf-mute, but appreciated the hard work he did. If, on occasion, Comrade Turenski would lean on his broom and fall into a short reverie, it was excusable because he still managed to get all his work done.  Behind Comrade Turenski, a guide was explaining a display to a group of tourists, but Turenski ignored the distraction and kept his mind focused on the thoughts of Dr. Sonya Malekrinova.  After nearly ten months of patient work, Raphael Poe had hit upon something that was, to his way of thinking, more important than all the information he had transmitted to Washington thus far.  Picking brains telepathically was not, even for him, an easy job. He had the knack and the training but, in addition, there was the necessity of establishing a rapport with the other mind. Since he was a physicist and not a politician, it was much easier to get information from the mind of Sonya Malekrinova than to get it from the Premier. The only person with whom he could keep in contact over any great distance was his brother, and that only because the two of them had grown up together.  He could pick up the strongest thoughts of any nearby person very easily. He did not need to hear the actual words, for instance, of a nearby conversation in order to follow it perfectly, because the words of verbal communication were strong in a person's mind.  But getting deeper than that required an increasing amount of understanding of the functioning of the other person's mind.  His ability to eavesdrop on conversations had been of immense benefit to Washington so far, but is was difficult for him to get close enough to the higher-ups in the Soviet government to get all the data that the President of the United States wanted.  But now that he had established a firm mental linkage with one of the greatest physicists in the Soviet Union, he could begin to send information that would be of tremendous value to the United States.  He brushed up a pile of trash, pushed it into a dust pan, and carried it off toward the disposal chute that led to the trash cans. In the room where the brooms were kept, he paused and closed his eyes.  _Lenny! Are picking this up?_  _Sure, Rafe. I'm ready with the drawing board anytime you are._  As Dr. Sonya Malekrinova stood in her laboratory looking over the apparatus she was perfecting for the glory of the Soviet State, she had no notion that someone halfway around the world was also looking at it over her shoulder--or rather, through her own eyes.         *       *       *       *       *  Lenny started with the fives first, and worked his way up to the larger denominations.  \"Five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five, thirty--forty, fifty, sixty....\" he muttered happily to himself. \"Two fifty, three, three-fifty, four, four-fifty.\"  It was all there, so he smiled benevolently at the man in the pay window. \"Thank you muchly.\" Then he stepped aside to let another lucky man cash a winning ticket.  His horse had come in at fifteen, six-ten, four-fifty for Straight, Place, and Show, and sixty bucks on the nose had paid off very nicely.  Lenny Poe took out his copy of the _Daily Racing Form_ and checked over the listing for the next race.  _Hm-m-m, ha. Purse, $7500. Four-year-olds and up: handicap. Seven furlongs. Turf course. Hm-m-m, ha._  Lenny Poe had a passion for throwing his money away on any unpredictable event that would offer him odds. He had, deep down, an artistic soul, but he didn't let that interfere with his desire to lay a bet at the drop of an old fedora.  He had already decided, several hours before, that Ducksoup, in the next race, would win handily and would pay off at something like twenty or twenty-five to one. But he felt it his duty to look one last time at the previous performance record, just to be absolutely positive.  Satisfied, he folded the _Racing Form_, shoved it back into his pocket, and walked over to the fifty-dollar window.  \"Gimmie nine tickets on Ducksoup in the seventh,\" he said, plonking the handful of bills down on the counter.  But before the man behind the window grating could take the money, a huge, hamlike, and rather hairy hand came down on top of his own hand, covering it and the money at the same time.  \"Hold it, Lenny,\" said a voice at the same time.  Lenny jerked his head around to his right and looked up to see a largish man who had \"cop\" written all over him. Another such individual crowded past Lenny on his left to flash a badge on the man in the betting window, so that he would know that this wasn't a holdup.  \"Hey!\" said Lenny. His mind was thinking fast. He decided to play his favorite role, that of the indignant Italian. \"Whatsa da matta with you, hah? Thisa no a free country? A man gotta no rights?\"  \"Come on, Mr. Poe,\" the big man said quietly, \"this is important.\"  \"Poe? You outta you mind? Thatsa name of a river----or a raven. I'm a forgetta which. My namesa Manelli!\"  \"_Scusi, signore_,\" the big man said with exaggerated politeness, \"_ma se lei è veramente italiano, non' è l'uomo che cerchiamo._\"  Lenny's Italian was limited to a handful of words. He know he was trapped, but he faced the situation with aplomb. \"Thatsa lie! I was inna Chicago that night!\"  \"_Ah! Cosè credero. Avanti, saccentone._\" He jerked his thumb toward the gate. \"Let's go.\"  Lenny muttered something that the big man didn't quite catch.  \"What'd you say?\"  \"Upper United States--the northern United States,\" Lenny said calmly shoving his four hundred fifty dollars into his pocket. \"That's where Chicago is. Never mind. Come in, boys; back to the drawing"]]]
