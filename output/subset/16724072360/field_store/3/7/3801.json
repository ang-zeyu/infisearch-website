We are empowered to use our judgment in all circumstances. And in this particular instance I believe I can convince you that the course I suggest is the more just one.\" He turned to Toolls. \"Just what stage of cultural development would you say this creature's race has attained?\"  \"It still retains more of an animal-like adaptation to its surroundings than an intellectual one,\" Toolls replied. \"Its civilization is divided into various sized units of cooperation which it calls governments. Each unit vies with the others for a greater share of its world's goods. That same rivalry is carried down to the individual within the unit. Each strives for acquisition against his neighbor.  \"Further they retain many of their tribal instincts, such as gregariousness, emotional rather than intellectual propagation, and worship of the mightiest fighter. This last, however, is manifested by reverence for individuals attaining position of authority, or acquiring large amounts of their medium of exchange, rather than by physical superiority.\"  \"That's what I mean,\" Macker said. \"Our policy in the past has been to avoid tampering, only because of the fear of bringing harm. If we created a super being among them, to act as a controlling and harmonizing force, we'd hasten their development by thousands of years. We'd be granting them the greatest possible boon!\"  \"I don't know,\" Remm said, obviously swayed by Macker's logic. \"I'm still hesitant about introducing a being into their midst whose thought processes would be so subtle and superior to their own. How do you feel about it, Toolls?\"  \"What would they have to lose?\" Toolls asked with his penchant for striking the core of an argument.  \"The right or wrong of such moral and philosophical considerations has always been a delicate thing to decide,\" Remm acquiesced reluctantly. \"Go ahead if you think it is the right thing to do.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"All finished?\" Macker asked.  \"That depends on how much you want me to do,\" Toolls replied. \"I've substituted our 'heavy' substances for his entire body structure, including the brain--at the same time transferring his former memory and habit impressions. That was necessary if he is to be able to care for himself. Also I brought his muscular reaction time up to our norm, and speeded his reflexes.\"  \"Have you implanted any techniques which he did not possess before, such as far-seeing, or mental insight?\" Macker asked.  \"No,\" Toolls said. \"That is what I want your advice about. Just how much should I reveal about ourselves and our background? Or should he be left without any knowledge of us?\"  \"Well ...\" Now that the others had deferred to Macker's arguments, he had lost much of his certainty. \"Perhaps we should at least let him know who we are, and what we have done. That would save him much alarm and perplexity when it comes time to reorient himself. On the other hand, perhaps we should go even farther and implant the knowledge of some of our sciences. Then he could do a better job of advancing his people. But maybe I'm wrong. What do you think about it, Remm?\"  \"My personal opinion,\" Remm said, \"is that we can't give him much of our science, because it would be like giving a baby a high explosive to play with. His race is much too primitive to handle it wisely. Either he, or someone to whom he imparts what we teach him, would be certain to bring catastrophe to his world. And if we let him learn less, but still remember his contact with us, in time his race would very likely come to regard us as gods. I would hesitate to drag in any metaphysical confusion to add to the uncertainties you are already engendering. My advice would be to wipe his mind of all memory of us. Let him explain his new found invincibility to himself in his own way.\"  Macker had no criticism to offer to this suggestion. \"Does he retain any of his immunity to this world's malignant germs?\" he asked.  \"They are too impotent to represent any hazard to his present body mechanism,\" Toolls replied. \"If and when he dies, it will not be from disease.\"  \"He will be subject to the deterioration of old age, the same as we are, won't he?\" Macker asked.  \"Of course,\" Toolls said, \"but that's the only thing that will be able to bring him down. He cannot be harmed by any force this 'light' world can produce; he is impervious to sickness; and he will live indefinitely.\"  \"Indefinitely?\"  \"As his world reckons time. Their normal life span is less than a hundred years. Ours is over five thousand. He will probably live approximately twice that long, because he will be subjected to less stress and strain, living as he does on a world of lighter elements.\"  \"Then we have truly made a superman,\" Macker's tones inflected satisfaction. \"I wish we were returning this way in a thousand years or so. I'd like to see the monumental changes he will effect.\"  \"We may at that,\" Remm said, \"or others of our people will. He will probably be a living legend by then. I'd like to hear what his race has to say about him. Do they have names with which to differentiate individuals?\"  \"Yes,\" Toolls said. \"This one has a family designation of Pollnow, and a member designation of Orville.\"  \"It will be necessary for us to leave in exactly ten minutes,\" Remm reminded them. \"Our next stopping place--the red star--will reach its nearest conjunction with this planet by the time we meet it out in space.\"  \"Then we will have time to do nothing more for him before we go,\" Macker said. \"But as far as I can see we've forgotten nothing, have we, Toolls?\"  \"Nothing,\" Toolls answered. \"No--we forgot nothing.\"         *       *       *       *       *  But Toolls was wrong. They had forgotten one thing. A minor detail, relatively....  On Toolls' world his race, in the course of its evolution, had adjusted itself to its own particular environment. Logically, the final result was that they evolved into beings best able to survive in that environment. As such their food--a \"heavy,\" highly concentrated food--was ideally suited to supply the needs of their \"heavy,\" tremendously avid organisms.  Orville Pollnow had no such food available. His body--no larger than before--had an Earth mass of one hundred and eighty thousand pounds. One hundred and eighty thousand pounds--the weight of twelve hundred average sized men--of fiercely burning, intense virility. Even continuous eating--of his own world's food--could not supply the demands of that body.  Twenty-four hours after the aliens left, Pollnow was dead--of starvation.

The guests who wanted to apply for outgoing berths were told there were none open, that they'd have to wait for the _Camelot_.\"  She went over to a desk, unlocked a drawer, took out a sheaf of papers, and handed one of them to Quillan. \"That's the layout of the Star,\" she said. \"This five-level building over by the shell is the Executive Block. The Brotherhood and the commodore's men moved in there this morning. The Block is the Star's defense center. It's raid-proofed, contains the control officers and the transmitter and armament rooms. About the standard arrangement. While they hold the Executive Block, they have absolute control of the Star.\"  \"If it's the defense center, it should be practically impossible to do anything about them there,\" Quillan agreed. \"They could close it up, and dump the air out of the rest of the Star in a minute, if they had to. But there must be ... well, what about the lifeboats in the subspace section--and our pals must have a getaway ship stashed away somewhere?\"  \"They have two ships,\" Reetal said. \"A souped-up armed freighter the Brotherhood came in on, and a large armed yacht which seems to be the commodore's personal property. Unfortunately, they're both in subspace locks.\"  \"Why unfortunately?\"  \"Because they've sealed off subspace. Try portaling down there, and you'll find yourself looking at a battle-plastic bulkhead. There's no way of getting either to those ships or to the lifeboats.\"  Quillan lifted his eyebrows. \"And _that_ hasn't caused any comment? What about the maintenance crews, the warehouse men, the--\"  \"All the work crews were hauled out of subspace this morning,\" Reetal said. \"On the quiet, the Star's employees have been told that a gang of raiders was spotted in the warehouse area, and is at present cornered there. Naturally, the matter isn't to be mentioned to the guests, to avoid arousing unnecessary concern. And that explains everything very neatly. The absence of the security men, and why subspace is sealed off. Why the Executive Block is under guard, and can't be entered--and why the technical and office personnel in there don't come out, and don't communicate out. They've been put on emergency status, officially.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"Yunk,\" Quillan said disgustedly after a moment. \"This begins to look like a hopeless situation, doll!\"  \"True.\"  \"Let's see now--\"  Reetal interrupted, \"There is one portal still open to subspace. That's in the Executive Block, of course, and Heraga reports it's heavily guarded.\"  \"How does he know?\"  \"The Block's getting its meals from Phalagon House. He floated a diner in there a few hours ago.\"  \"Well,\" Quillan said, brightening, \"perhaps a deft flavoring of poison--\"  Reetal shook her head. \"I checked over the hospital stocks. Not a thing there that wouldn't be spotted at once. Unless we can clobber them thoroughly, we can't afford to make them suspicious with a trick like that.\"  \"Poison would be a bit rough on the office help, too,\" Quillan conceded. \"They wouldn't be in on the deal.\"  \"No, they're not. They're working under guard.\"  \"Gas ... no, I suppose not. It would take too long to whip up something that could turn the trick.\" Quillan glanced at his watch. \"If the _Camelot_ docks at midnight, we've around six and a half hours left, doll! And I don't find myself coming up with any brilliant ideas. What have you thought of?\"  Reetal hesitated a moment. \"Nothing very brilliant either,\" she said then. \"But there are two things we might try as a last resort.\"  \"Let's hear them.\"  \"I know a number of people registered in the Star at present who'd be carrying personal weapons. If they were told the facts, I could probably line up around twenty who'd be willing to make a try to get into the Executive Block, and take over either the control offices or the transmitter room. If we got a warning out to the _Camelot_, that would break up the plot. Of course, it wouldn't necessarily save the Star.\"  \"No,\" Quillan said, \"but it's worth trying if we can't think of something better. How would you get them inside?\"  \"We could crowd twenty men into one of those diner trucks, and Heraga could take us in.\"  \"What kind of people are your pals?\"  \"A few smugglers and confidence men I've had connections with. Fairly good boys for this sort of thing. Then there's an old millionaire sportsman, with a party of six, waiting to transfer to the _Camelot_ for a safari on Jontarou. Old Philmarron isn't all there, in my opinion, but he's dead game and loves any kind of a ruckus. We can count on him and his friends, if they're not too drunk at the moment. Still ... that's not too many to set against something less than a hundred professional guns, even though some of them must be down on the two ships.\"  \"No, not enough.\" Quillan looked thoughtful. \"What's the other idea?\"  \"Let the cat out of the bag generally. Tell the guests and the employees out here what's going on, and see if somebody can think of something that might be done.\"  He shook his head. \"What you'd set off with that would be anywhere between a riot and a panic. The boys in the Executive Block would simply give us the breathless treatment. Apparently, they prefer to have everything looking quiet and normal when the _Camelot_ gets here--\"  \"But they don't have to play it that way,\" Reetal agreed. \"We might be dead for hours before the liner docks. If they keep the landing lock closed until what they want has been unloaded, nobody on the _Camelot_ would realize what had happened before it was too late.\"         *       *       *       *       *  There was a moment's silence. Then Quillan said, \"You mentioned you'd picked up a clue to what they're after. What was that?\"  \"Well, that's a curious thing,\" Reetal said. \"On the trip out here, a young girl name of Solvey Kinmarten attached herself to me. She didn't want to talk much, but I gathered she was newly married, and that her husband was on board and was neglecting her. She's an appealing little thing, and she seemed so forlorn and upset that I adopted her for the rest of the run. After we arrived, of course, I pretty well forgot about the Kinmartens and their troubles.  \"A few hours ago, Solvey suddenly came bursting into the suite where I'm registered. She was shaking all over. After I calmed her down a bit, she spilled out her story. She and her husband, Brock Kinmarten, are rest wardens. With another man named Eltak, whom Solvey describes as 'some sort of crazy old coot,' they're assigned to escort two deluxe private rest cubicles to a very exclusive sanatorium on Mezmiali. But Brock told Solvey at the beginning of the trip that this was a very unusual assignment, that he didn't want her even to come near the cubicles. That wouldn't have bothered her so much, she says, but on the way here Brock became increasingly irritable and absent-minded. She knew he was worrying about the cubicles, and she began to wonder whether they weren't involved in something illegal. The pay was very high; they're both getting almost twice the regular warden fee for the job. One day, she found an opportunity to do a little investigating.  \"The cubicles are registered respectively to a Lady Pendrake and a Major Pendrake. Lady Pendrake appears to be genuine; the cubicle is unusually large and constructed somewhat differently from the ones with which Solvey was familiar, but it was clear that it had an occupant. However, the life indicator on 'Major Pendrake's cubicle registered zero when she switched it on. If there was something inside it, it wasn't a living human being.  \"That was all she learned at the time, because she was afraid Brock might catch her in the cubicle room. Here in the Star, the cubicles were taken to a suite reserved for Lady Pendrake. The other man, Eltak, stayed in the suite with the cubicles, while the Kinmartens were given other quarters. However, Brock was still acting oddly and spending most of his time in the Pendrake suite. So this morning, Solvey swiped his key to the suite and slipped in when she knew the two men had left it.\"  [Illustration]  \"She'd barely got there when she heard Brock and Eltak at the door again. She ran into the next room, and hid in a closet. Suddenly there was a commotion in the front room, and Solvey realized that men from the Star's security force had arrived and were arresting Brock and Eltak. They hauled both of them away, then floated the cubicles out and on a carrier and took them off too, locking the suite behind them.  \"Solvey was in a complete panic, sure that she and Brock had become involved in some serious breach of the Warden Code. She waited a few minutes, then slipped out of the Pendrake suite, and looked me up to see if I couldn't help them. I had Heraga check, and he reported that the Kinmarten suite was under observation. Evidently, they wanted to pick up the girl, too. So I tucked her away in one of the suites in this section, and gave her something to put her to sleep. She's there now.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Quillan said, \"And where are the prisoners and the cubicles?\"  \"In the Executive Block.\"  \"How do you know?\"  Reetal smiled briefly. \"The Duke of Fluel told me.\"  \"Huh? The Brotherhood knows you're here?\"  \"Relax,\" Reetal said. \"Nobody but Heraga knows I'm working for the Mooleys. I told the Duke I had a big con deal set up when the _Camelot_ came in--I even suggested he might like to get in on it. He laughed, and said he had other plans. But he won't mention to anyone that I'm here.\"  \"Why not?\"  \"Because,\" Reetal said dryly, \"what the Duke is planning to get in on is an hour of tender dalliance. Before the _Camelot_ arrives, necessarily. The cold-blooded little skunk!\" She hesitated a moment; when she spoke again, her voice had turned harsh and nasal, wicked amusement sounding through it. \"Sort of busy at the moment, sweetheart, but we might find time for a drink or two later on in the evening, eh?\"  Quillan grunted. \"Y"]]]
