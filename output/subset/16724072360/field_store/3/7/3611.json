In detail, some cranial features diagnostic of _attenuatus,_ when compared with _bullatus,_ are: Anterolateral angle of zygoma less nearly a right angle; temporal ridges bowed outward at middle, instead of straight, and farther apart posteriorly than anteriorly instead of nearly parallel; sides of basioccipital nearly straight instead of concave.  From _Thomomys talpoides cheyennensis_ (holotype and Wyoming specimens from: Pine Bluff; 1 mi. W Pine Bluffs, 5000 ft.; 12 mi. N and 1/2 mi. W Pine Bluffs) to the eastward, _T. t. attenuatus_ differs in smaller size throughout and more slender skull. The two subspecies are indistinguishable in color.  From _Thomomys talpoides macrotis_ (topotypes) to the southward, _T. t. attenuatus_ differs in smaller size, slightly lighter (less brownish and more whitish) color, smaller and slenderer skull.  From _Thomomys talpoides rostralis_ (specimens from the type locality) to the westward, _T. t. attenuatus_ differs in smaller size; lighter (grayer, less brownish) color, smaller and less angular skull.  From _Thomomys talpoides clusius_ (topotypes) to the northwestward, _T. t. attenuatus_ differs in shorter body, slightly grayer color, less width across mastoid region of skull, smaller tympanic bullae, and more obtuse anterolateral angle on zygoma.  _Remarks._--This subspecies is of smaller size than any of the geographically adjoining subspecies. Intergradation with _T. t. cheyennensis_ is shown by specimens from two miles south and nine and one-half miles east of Cheyenne, Wyoming. Intergradation with _T. t. bullatus_ or _T. t. clusius_ or both is suggested by the larger size of the specimen from five miles southwest of Wheatland, Wyoming. Although large, this skull has the slender proportions of _attenuatus_ to which the specimen is tentatively referred. Although the specimens from Avalo, Colorado, are typical _attenuatus,_ the specimen from Pawnee Buttes, Colorado, is somewhat larger than typical _attenuatus_ and suggests intergradation with the subspecies to the southward, for example, at Flagler, Colorado.  _Specimens examined._--Total number, 44, and unless otherwise indicated in the Museum of Natural History of the University of Kansas.  =Wyoming.= _Niobrara County_: 10 mi.

I awakened _reasoning_--realizing that I existed.\"  \"I suppose it has to do with our emotional differences,\" the _Pat_ beside me or with me or within me communicated.  \"Do you recall where in space you came from?\" I asked. \"I must have been doubting my existence at first so intensely I did not observe. You seem to have taken your own being for granted, thus you were, perhaps, more observant.\"  \"I--I think so.\" The _Pat_ hesitated and I knew it was observing the stars around us. \"Yes. Come with me. I think I know where.\"  I stayed with the _Pat_, a part of it, and we lurched through space. Rather, we ceased to exist at one point in space and existed in another. How far? Distances meant nothing.  \"It was here,\" the _Pat_ informed me finally.         *       *       *       *       *  Something was wrong here. The interweaving waves of force were all wrong. There was a disorder, a great cancer in space. The waves interfered with the progress of each other all along a great barrier. It was not natural, not like it was elsewhere.  \"Something is wrong with the waves of force crossing this area. They interfere with each other. New forces are created. Do you detect it?\" I communicated.  \"I feel it,\" the _Pat_ answered. \"It is a sickness in space like--like our loneliness.\"  I knew the comparison was ridiculous but I let it pass. \"You said you came alive at great speed. I could have been traveling too. We must have plunged into this barrier. It seems to me that emotions must originate in a _physical_ being; perhaps reason could be free, but not emotion. I don't know. But I have a theory. I believe our _physical_ selves still exist somewhere in space. The barrier, perhaps, interfered with the normal functioning of our mental equipment. We exist at one point in space and we are thinking, experiencing emotions at another point. It's as if our minds are--are broadcasting our thoughts and emotions far away from our physical selves. Either that, or our rationales were torn free and only our emotions are broadcast. Does that sound logical?\"  \"Yes,\" the _Pat_ agreed, \"I believe that is the answer.\"  I felt that the _Pat_ was pleased with my theory, that it greatly admired my reasoning. I also perceived that it had no idea what I meant by the explanation. I did not mind.  \"You said you were moving at great speed,\" I continued. \"Can you remember the line, the direction you were traveling in?\"  The _Pat_ hesitated only a moment. \"Yes. You perceive the star cluster there, the triangular one? My heading was in that direction, but it was changing fast.\"  \"Then we could find nothing by traveling toward the triangular cluster?\"  \"No. I was moving in an arc in the direction of the distorted square cluster there. Do you see it?\"  \"Yes,\" I answered, knowing her use of the word _see_ was unconscious. \"That is Cetus.\"  \"Cetus?\" The _Pat_ was startled. \"How do you know that?\"  \"I don't know. The name came to me. It seemed right to call it that.\"  \"It--it's all so frightening!\"  I had no time for pampering our emotions, though I was at great peace with the _Pat_ so near me. Time might prove vital. \"Neither would it do any good to travel in the direction of Cetus,\" I said.  \"No. No,\" the _Pat_ communicated. \"If there is any object of matter or force I was a part of in that other existence traveling through space, it is in an arc. The best we can do is take an arbitrary direction between the triangular cluster and the one called Cetus and hope to intercept the object, the other part of me, whatever it is.\"  \"Come with me,\" I ordered.  I discovered the object of mass hurtling through space before the _Pat_ did. It was symmetrical and metallic. I tore myself away from my companion and darted to meet it. I discovered it was a shell, a hollow thing, and I passed inside. There was a room there. There were projections and circles of transparent matter. I experienced the symbol _dials_.  There were two other creatures seated close to the dials, things of matter, and their substance was protoplasm. But there was no rationale present in either of them. I examined the living matter of the smaller one swiftly. Organs seemed poised in a suspended state. The creature I observed, housed in a protective shell, seemed paralyzed or dead. I remembered the word _dead_.  Then the _Pat_ was with me again. \"I--I feel something, _Marl_. I am frightened. What are they, those things there?\"  \"They seem to be--\" I stopped communicating.  The _Pat_ had disappeared!  The thing of protoplasm nearest me was moving but I was no longer interested. I remember the _Pat_ had touched the upper extremity of the creature and had vanished, had ceased to be.  The old sickness was back. I was lonely. I wanted the other entity. I could not, did not wish to exist without the _Pat_.  I darted frantically about the metal shell, here and there, searching, searching. Where was the _Pat_? I _screamed_ for it. I thought _Pat_ as far away as I could reach, but there was no reaction, no response at all.  In my frenzy, I was back beside the creatures of protoplasm before I realized it, near the one I had not yet examined.  \"Perhaps they took her,\" I thought. It was not logical, but it was a hope. Hope is emotional; I was becoming more emotional than rational.  I touched the larger of the two creatures, experimentally; moved cautiously inside it, searching, searching.  Suddenly I was seized by a great force, an inexorable power that grasped me and wrenched me, tearing me from the point in space I had occupied a moment before. My perception blurred, but I was not frightened. Without the _Pat_ I did not care what happened. I was intensely curious. \"So this is how it is,\" I reasoned in a flash, \"to _cease to be_.\"  And I ceased to be....         *       *       *       *       *  Marlow shook his head. I must have dozed, he thought. He glanced at the chronometer on the console ahead. No, only a minute or two had elapsed since the last time he had checked.  \"Sleepy head! Wake up and live!\"  He looked to his right. Pat sat in the navigator's seat smiling at him.  \"I didn't sleep, honestly,\" he protested. \"We hit some sort of barrier back there. It knocked me out for a moment. I had the damnedest impression--\"  \"Remember what you promised!\" She swiveled the seat about to face him. \"No more scientific lectures on the mysteries of space or I'll return to earth. You know my poor brain can't absorb it.\"  \"You win,\" he grinned, running calloused fingers through his greying crew-cut. He leaned forward and kissed her briefly. \"How did an old space hermit like me ever win a flower-garden bride in the first place?\"  They laughed together, and he felt secure within the metallic shell surrounding them, no longer alone.
