Two menials hastened to the beach,     For signal none need they;   On the towers they kept a heedful watch     As the skiff glode on its way:    With silent step and breathless care   The rescued one they softly bear,   And bring him, at their lord's behest,   To a couch of silken pillowed rest.    The serfs could scarce avert their eye     From his manly form and mien,   As, with closëd lids, all reverendly,     He lay in peace, serene.    And Romara thought, as he gazing leant     O'er the slumberer's form, that so pure a trace   Of the spirit of Heaven with the earthly blent     Dwelt only there, and in Agnes' face.    The leech comes forth at the hour of noon,   And saith, that the sick from his deathly swoon   Will awake anon; and Romara's eye,   Uplit, betokens his heartfelt joy;   And again o'er the slumberer's couch he bows   Till, slowly, those peaceful lids unclose,--   When, long, with heavenward-fixëd gaze,   With lowly prayer and grateful praise,   The aged man, from death reprieved,   His bosom of its joy relieved.--    Then did Romara thus address   His gray guest, in his reverendness:    \"Now, man of prayer come tell to me   Some spell of thy holy mystery!   Some vision hast had of the Virgin bright,--   Or message, conveyed from the world of light,   By the angels of love who in purity stand   'Fore the throne of our Lord in the heavenly land?    \"I hope, when I die, to see them there:   For I love the angels so holy and fair:   And often, I trust, my prayer they greet   With smiles, when I kneel and kiss their feet   In the missal, my mother her weeping child gave,   But a day or two ere she was laid in the grave.    \"Sage man of prayer, come tell to me   What holy shapes in sleep they see   Who love the blest saints and serve them well!   I pray thee, sage man, to Romara tell,   For a guerdon, thy dreams,--sith, to me thou hast said   No thanks that I rescued thy soul from the dead.\"    But, when the aged man arose     And met Romara's wistful eye,--   What accents shall the change disclose     That marked his visage, fearfully?--   From joy to grief and deepest dole,     From radiant hope to dark presage   Of future ills beyond control--     Hath passed, the visage of the sage.    \"Son of an honoured line, I grieve,\"     Outspake the reverend seer,   \"That I no guerdon thee can give     But words of woe and fear!--   Thy sun is setting!--and thy race,     In thee, their goodly heir,   Shall perish, nor a feeble trace     Their fated name declare!--   Thy love is fatal: fatal, too,     This act of rescue brave--   For, him who from destruction drew     My life, no arm can save!\"    He said,--and took his lonely way     Far from Romara's towers.--   His fateful end from that sad day     O'er Torksey's chieftain lowers:--   Yet, vainly, in his heart a shrine     Hope builds for love,--with faith;--   Alas! for him with frown malign     Waiteth the grim king Death!   FYTTE THE THYRDE.    Plantagenet hath dungeons deep     Beneath his castled halls;--   Plantagenet awakes from sleep     To count his dungeoned thralls.    Alone, with the torch of blood-red flame,     The man of blood descends;   And the fettered captives curse his name,     As through the vaults he wends.--    His caverns are visited, all, save one,     The deepest, and direst in gloom,--   Where his father, doomed by a demon son,     Abode in a living tomb.--    \"I bring thee bread and water, sire!     Brave usury for thy gold!   I fear my filial zeal will tire     To visit, soon, thy hold!\"    Thus spake the fiendish-hearted lord,     And wildly laughed, in scorn:   Like thunder round the cell each word     By echoing fiends is borne,--   But not a human heart is there   The baron's scorn or hate to fear!    And the captives tell, as he passeth again,--     That tyrant, in his rage,--   How an angel hath led the aged man     To his heavenly heritage!    The wrathful baron little recked     That angel was his darling child;   Or knew his dark ambition checked     By her who oft his rage beguiled,--     By her on whom he ever smiled:--   This had he known, from that dread hour,   His darling's smile had lost its power,--   And his own hand, without remorse,   Had laid her at his feet a corse!--    Plantagenet's banners in pride are borne     To the sound of pipe and drum!   And his mailëd bands, with the dawn of morn,     To Romara's walls are come.   \"We come not as foes,\" the herald saith,--   \"But we bring Plantagenet's shriven faith   That thou, Romara, in thine arms   Shall soon enfold thy true love's charms:   Let no delay thy joy betide!--   Thy Agnes soon shall be thy bride!\"    The raven croaks as Torksey's lord     Attends that bannered host;   But the lover is deaf to the omen-bird--     The fatal moat is crossed!    \"Ride, ride;\" saith the baron,--\"thy ladye fain     And the priest--by the altar wait!\"--   And the spearmen seize his bridle-rein,     And hurry him to his fate.    \"A marriage by torchlight!\" the baron said;     \"This stair to the altar leads!   We patter our prayers, 'mong the mouldering dead,--     And there we tell our beads!\"    Along the caverned dungeon's gloom     The tyrant strides in haste;   And, powerless, to his dreadful doom     The victim followeth fast.   The dazëd captives quake and stare   At the sullen torch's blood-red glare,     And the lover starts aghast   At the deathlike forms they wear!    Too late, the truth upon him breaks!--     Romara's heart is faint!--   \"Behold thy bride!\" the baron shrieks--     \"Wilt hear the wedding chaunt?   This chain once bound my father here,     Who would have found his grave--     The cursed dotard!--'neath the wave,--   Had not thy hateful hand been near.--   Be this the bride thou now shalt wed!   This dungeon dank thy bridal bed!--   And when thy youthful blood shall freeze   In death,--may fiends thy spirit seize!\"--    Plantagenet hath minions fell   Who do their master's bidding well:--   Few days Romara pines in dread:--   His soul is with the sainted dead!--    Plantagenet hath reached his bourne!   What terrors meet his soul forlorn   And full of stain,--I may not say:--   Reveal them shall the Judgment Day!--    Her orisons at matin hour,     At noon, and eve, and midnight toll,   For him, doth tearful Agnes pour!--     Jesu Maria! sain his soul!       THE   BARON'S YULE FEAST.    A   Christmas Rhyme.  CANTO II.     Symphonious notes of dulcet plaint   Followed the stranger minstrel's chaunt;   And, when his sounding harp was dumb,   The crowd, with loud applausive hum,   Gave hearty guerdon for his strain;   While some with sighs expressed what pain   Had pierced their simple bosoms thorow   To hear his song of death and sorrow.    \"Come bear the mead-cup to our guest,\"     Said Thorold to his daughter;   \"We thought to hear, at our Yule feast,     A lay of mirth and laughter;   But, to thy harp, thou well hast sung     A song that may impart,   For future hours, to old and young,     Deep lessons to the heart.   Yet, should not life be all a sigh!   Good Snell, do thou a burthen try   Shall change our sadness into joy:   Such as thou trollest in blythe mood,   On days of sunshine in the wood.   Tell out thy heart withouten fear--   For none shall stifle free thoughts here!   But, bear the mead-cup, Edith sweet!   We crave our stranger guest will greet   All hearts, again, with minstrelsy,   When Snell hath trolled his mirth-notes free!\"    Fairer than fairest flower that blows,--   Sweeter than breath of sweetest rose,--   Still on her cheek, in lustre left,   The tear the minstrel's tale had reft   From its pearl-treasure in the brain--   The limbec where, by mystic vein,   From the heart's fountains are distilled   Those crystals, when 'tis overfilled,--   With downcast eye, and trembling hands,   Edith before the stranger stands--     Stranger to all but her!   Though well the baron notes his brow,   While the young minstrel kneeleth low--     Love's grateful worshipper!--   And doth with lips devout impress   The hand of his fair ministress!    Yet, was the deed so meekly done,--   His guerdon seemed so fairly won,--   The tribute he to beauty paid     So deeply all believed deserved,--   That nought of blame Sir Wilfrid said,     Though much his thoughts from meekness swerved.    Impatience, soon, their faces tell   To hear the song of woodman Snell,     Among the festive crew;   And, soon, their old and honest frere,   Elated by the good Yule cheer,   In untaught notes, but full and clear,     Thus told his heart-thoughts true:--   The Woodman's Song.    I would not be a crownëd king,     For all his gaudy gear;   I would not be that pampered thing,     His gew-gaw gold to wear:   But I would be where I can sing     Right merrily, all the year;         Where forest treen,         All gay and green,     Full blythely do me cheer.    I would not be a gentleman,     For all his hawks and hounds,--   For fear the hungry poor should ban     My halls and wide-parked grounds:   But I would be a merry man,     Among the wild wood sounds,--         Where free birds sing,         And echoes ring     While my axe from the oak rebounds.    I would not be a shaven priest,     For all his sloth-won tythe:   But while to me this breath is leased,     And these old limbs are lithe,--   Ere Death hath marked me for his feast,     And felled me with his scythe,--         I'll troll my song,         The leaves among,     All in the forest blythe.      *       *       *       *       *    \"Well done, well done!\" bold Thorold cried,     When the woodman ceased to sing;   \"By'r Lady! it warms the Saxon tide     In our veins to hear thee bring   These English thoughts so freely out!   Thy health, good Snell!\"--and a merry shout   For honest"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29730"],["title","Desserts and Salads (#1)"],["body","(with Cherries).+-- Make a hard sauce with the yolks of 2 eggs and put some nice, ripe cherries (without the pits) into it; stir the whole well together and serve with suet pudding or dumplings.
