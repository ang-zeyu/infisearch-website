I think it quite probable that we shall have to do considerable exploring before finding him.\"  \"Ah,\" the other murmured, shrewdly. \"It is a matter of police work, perhaps?\"  \"No--and yes. The man we seek is not wanted by the law, and yet he is. He has committed no crime, and so cannot be arrested. But the law wants him badly because the settlement of a certain big estate hinges upon the question of whether he is alive or dead. If alive, he is heir to more than a million. If not--the money goes elsewhere.\"  \"Ah,\" repeated the official, thoughtfully.  \"I might add,\" McKay broke in with a touch of stiffness, \"that neither I nor either of my companions would profit in any way by this man's death. Quite the contrary.\"  \"Ah,\" reiterated the other, his face clearing. \"You are commissioned, perhaps, to find and produce this man.\"  \"Exactly,\" Knowlton nodded. \"From our own financial standpoint he is worth much more alive than dead. On the other hand, any absolute proof of his death--proof which would stand in a court of law--is worth something also. Our task is to produce either the man himself or indisputable proof that he no longer lives.  \"The man's name is David Dawson Rand. If alive, he now is thirty-three years old. Height five feet nine. Weight about one hundred sixty. Hair dark, though not black. Eyes grayish green. Chief distinguishing marks are the green eyes, a broken nose--caused by being struck in the face by a baseball--and a patch of snow-white hair the size of a thumb ball, two inches above the left ear. Accustomed to having his own way, not at all considerate of others. Yet not a bad fellow as men go--merely a man spoiled by too much mothering in boyhood and by the fact that he never had to work. This is he.\"  From a breast pocket he drew a small grain-leather notebook, from which he extracted an unmounted photograph. The superintendent looked into the pictured face of a full-cheeked, wide-mouthed, square-jawed man with a slightly blasé expression and a half-cynical smile. After studying it a minute he nodded and handed it back.  \"As you say, senhor, a man who never has had to work.\"  \"Exactly. For five years this man has been regarded as dead. It was his habit to start off suddenly for any place where his whims drew him, notifying nobody of his departure. But a few days later he would always write, cable, or telegraph his relatives, so that his general whereabouts would soon become known. On his last trip he sent a radio message from a steamer, out at sea, saying he was bound for Rio Janeiro. That was the last ever heard from him.\"  \"Rio is far from here,\" suggested the Brazilian.  \"Just so. We look for Rand at the headwaters of the Amazon, instead of in Rio, because Rio yields no clew and because of one other thing which I shall speak of presently.  \"It has been learned that he reached Rio safely, but there his trail ended. As he had several thousand dollars on his person, it was concluded that he was murdered for his money and his body disposed of. This belief has been held until quite recently, when a new book of travel was published--_The Mother of Waters_, by Dwight Dexter, an explorer of considerable reputation.\"  The Brazilian's brows lifted.  \"Senhor Dexter? I remember Senhor Dexter. He stopped here for a short time, ill with fever. So he has published a book?\"  \"Yes. It deals mainly with his travels and observations in Peru, along the Marañon, Huallaga, and Ucayali. But it includes a short chapter regarding the Javary, and in that chapter occurs the following, which I have copied verbatim.\"  From the notebook he read:  \"'It falls to the lot of the explorer at times to meet not only hitherto unclassified species of fauna and flora, but also strange specimens of the _genus homo_. Such a creature came suddenly upon my camp one day just before a serious and well-nigh fatal attack of fever compelled me to relinquish my intention to proceed farther up the Javary.  \"'While my Indian cook was preparing the afternoon meal, out from the dense jungle strode a bearded, shaggy-haired, painted white man, totally nude save for a narrow breechclout and a quiver containing several long hunting arrows. In one hand he carried a strong bow of really excellent workmanship. This was his only weapon. He wore no ornament, unless streaks of brilliant red paint be considered ornaments. He was wild and savage in appearance and manner as any cannibal Indian. Yet he was indubitably white.  \"'To my somewhat startled greeting he made no response. Neither did he speak at any time during his unceremonious visit. Bolt upright, he stood beside my crude table until the Indian stolidly brought in my food. Then, without a by-your-leave, the wild man rapidly wolfed down the entire meal, feeding himself with one hand and holding his bow ready in the other. Though I questioned him and sought to draw him into conversation, he honored me with not so much as a grunt or a gesture. When the table was bare he stalked out again and vanished into the dim forest.  \"'After he had gone my Indian urged that we leave the place at once. The man, he said, was \"The Raposa\"--a word which denotes a species of wild dog sometimes found on the upper Amazon. He knew nothing of this \"Raposa\" except that he apparently belonged to a wild tribe living far back in the forest, perhaps allied with the cannibal Mayorunas, who were very fierce; and that he appeared sometimes at Indian settlements, where, without ever speaking, he would help himself to the best food and then leave. My man seemed to fear that now some great misfortune would come to us unless we shifted our base. When the fever came upon me soon afterward, the superstitious fellow was convinced that the illness was attributable directly to the visit of the human \"wild dog.\"  \"'Aside from the nudity and barbarism of the mysterious stranger, certain personal peculiarities struck me. One was that his eyes were green. Another was a streak of snow-white hair above one ear. Furthermore, the red paint on his body outlined his skeleton. His ribs, spine, arm- and leg-bones all were portrayed on his tanned skin by those brilliant red streaks. In this connection my Indian asserted that in the tribe to which \"The Raposa\" probably belonged it was the custom to preserve the bones of the dead and to paint them with this same red dye, after which the bones were hung up in the huts of the deceased instead of being given burial. Beyond this my informant knew nothing of the \"Red Bone\" people, except that to enter their country was death.'\"  Knowlton returned the book to his pocket and carefully buttoned the flap.  \"When that appeared,\" he continued, \"efforts were made to get hold of Dexter, with the idea of showing him the photograph of the missing man and learning any additional details. Unfortunately, by the time the book was published Dexter had gone to Africa to seek a race of dwarfs said to exist in the Igidi Desert, and thus was totally out of reach. Then we were called upon to follow up this clew and find the Raposa if possible. Men with green eyes and patches of white hair above one ear are not common. So, though our knowledge of this strange wild man is confined to those few words of Dexter's, we are here to learn more of him and to get him if we can.\"  He looked expectantly at the official. The latter, after staring out through the doorway for a time, shook his head slightly.  \"Something of this Raposa and of those red-streaked people has come to my ears, senhores, but only as rumors,\" he said, slowly. \"And one does not place great faith in rumors. Yet I have repeatedly been surprised to learn, after dismissing a story as an empty Indian tale, that the tale was true.  \"Of the Mayorunas more is known. They are eaters of human flesh, inhabiting both sides of the Javary, deadly when angered, and very easily angered. Their country is not many days distant from here, but as they never attack us we do not attack them. It is an armed neutrality, as you senhores would say. True, we have to be careful in drinking water, for they sometimes poison the streams against real or imaginary enemies, and the poisoned waters flow down to us, causing those who drink it to die of a fever like the typhoid. Yet,\" and he smiled, \"there is a saying, is there not, that water is made not to drink, but to bathe in?\"  Knowlton laughed. McKay's eyes twinkled.  \"I'm sorry to say that water's about all a fellow can get to drink in the States now,\" the blond man said, ruefully. \"That is, of course, unless a man knows where to go.\"  \"_Si._ It is a pity. But here in Brazil one need not drink water unless he wishes, and often it is better not to. Of the Mayorunas, senhor--you do not intend to go among them, seeking this wild man of the red bones? If you should do so it would be a matter of regret to me.\"  \"Meaning that we should not come out again? That's a risk we have to face. We go wherever it is necessary.\"  \"I am sorry. I regret also that I can give you no definite information. Yet I wish you all success, senhores, and a safe return. This much I can do and gladly will do: I can send word to another white man who now is in the town and who knows much of the upper river. He may be able to assist you, and without doubt will be eager to do so. He is staying at the hotel, just below here--Senhor Schwandorf.\"  The eyes of the two Americans narrowed. The official coughed.  \"Senhor McKay has been a soldier. And Senhor Knowlton--\"  \"I was a lieutenant.\"  \"Ah! But the war has passed, senhores. Senhor Schwandorf was not a soldier of Germany--he has been in Brazil for more than six years.\"  \"War's over. That's right,\" McKay agreed. \"But don't bother to send word. We'll find him if he's at the hotel. Going there ourselves. Glad to have met you, sir. Good luck!\"  \"And to you also luck, Capitao"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30324"],["title","The Pathless Trail (#2)"],["body"," Tenente,\" smiled the official. McKay and Knowlton strode out.  \"Guess this is the hotel,\" hazarded McKay, glancing at a house which rose slightly above the others. \"I'll go in and charter rooms. You get Tim and have somebody rustle our impedimenta up here.\"  He turned aside. Knowlton trudged on through the glare of sunset to the river bank where Tim and the army of Remate de Males still loafed up and down, the admired of all beholders.  \"All right, Tim. We're moving to the hotel. No more war, I see.\"  \"Lord love ye, no,\" grinned Tim. \"Me and this feller are gittin' on fine. He's Joey--I forgit the rest of his names; he's got about a dozen more and they sound like stones rattlin' around inside a can. But Joey's a right guy. After me tour o' duty ends he's goin' to buy me a drink and maybe introjuce me to a lady friend o' his. Want to join the party, Looey?\"  \"Not unless the ladies are better looking than these,\" laughed the ex-lieutenant, moving his head toward the pipe-smoking females.  \"Faith, I was thinkin' that same meself. Unless he can dig up somethin' fancier 'n what I see so far, I'd as soon have Mademoiselle.\"  \"Who?\"  \"Mademoiselle of Armentières. Sure, ye know that one, Looey. Goes to the tune o' 'Parley-Voo.'\"  Wherewith he lifted up a foghorn voice and, much to the edification of \"Joey\" (whose name really was Joao) and the rest of Remate de Males, burst into song:      \"Mademoiselle of Armenteers,         Pa-a-arley-voo!     She smoked our butts and bummed our beers,         Pa-a-arley-voo!     She had cockeyes and jackass ears     And she hadn't been kissed for forty years,         Rinkydinky-parley-voo!\"  As his musical effort ended, out from the dense jungle hemming in the town burst a hideous roaring howl. Again and again it sounded in a horrible crash of noise.  \"Holy Saint Pat!\" gasped Tim, throwing his rifle to port and bracing his feet. \"Now look what I went and done! Is that the echo, or a couple dozen jaggers all fightin' to oncet?\"  \"Guariba, Senhor Ree-ann,\" snickered Joao. \"Not jaguars--no. Only one little guariba monkey. The howler.\"  \"G'wan! Ye're kiddin'!\"  \"But no, _amigo_. It is as I tell you. One monkey. It is sunset, and the jungle awakes.\"  \"My gosh! I'll say it does. Sounds like a Sat'day night row in a Second Av'noo saloon, except there ain't no shootin'. Guess you boys have some night life, too, even if ye are away back in the bush.\"  \"Time for us to move, Tim,\" laughed Knowlton. \"It'll be dark in no time. Joao, will you have our baggage moved to the hotel?\"  \"_Si_, senhor. _Immediatamente._ Antonio--Jorge--Rosario! And you, too, Meldo--_vem cà_! Carry the bundles of the gentlemen to the hotel, presto! Proceed, senhores. I, Joao d'Almeida Magalhaes Nabuco Pestana da Fonseca, will remain here on guard until all your possessions have been transported. Proceed without fear.\"     CHAPTER III.  THE VOICE OF THE WILDS   McKay, eyes twinkling again, awaited them at the top of the hotel's street ladder.  \"Rooms any good, Rod?\" hailed Knowlton.  \"Best in the house, Merry.\"  \"See any insects in the beds?\"  \"Nary a bug--in the beds.\" The twinkle grew. \"Didn't look in the bureaus or behind the mirrors. Come look 'em over.\"  Entering a sizable room evidently used for dining--for its chief articles of furniture were two tables made from planed palm trunks--McKay waved a hand toward a row of four doorways on the right.  \"First three are ours,\" he explained. \"Only vacancies here. Eight rooms in this hotel--the other four over there.\" He pointed across the room, on the other side of which opened four similar doors. \"They're occupied by two sick men, one drunk--hear him snore?--and one she-goat which is kidding.\"  \"Huh?\" Tim snorted, suspiciously. \"I think ye're the one that's kiddin', Cap.\"  \"Not a bit. I looked. The last room on this side is the Dutchman's, and these are ours. Take your pick. They're all alike.\"  Knowlton stepped to the nearest and looked in. For a moment he said no word. Then he softly muttered:  \"Well, I'll be spread-eagled!\"  \"Me, too,\" seconded Tim, who had been craning his neck.  The room was absolutely empty. No bed, no chair, no bureau, no rug--nothing at all was in it except two iron hooks. Its floor consisted of split palm logs, round side up, between which opened inch-wide spaces. Its walls were rusty corrugated iron, guiltless of mirrors or pictures, which did not reach to the roof.  \"Observe the excellent ventilation,\" grinned McKay. \"Wind blows up through the floor--if there is any wind--and then loops over the partition into the next fellow's room.\"  \"Yeah. And I'll say any guy that drops his collar button is out o' luck. It goes plunk into the mud, seven foot down under the house. But say, Cap, how the heck do we sleep? Hang ourselves up on them hooks?\"  \"Exactly.\"  \"Kind o' rough on a feller's shirt, ain't it? And the shirt would likely pull off over yer head before mornin'.\"  \"Yes, probably would. But the secret is this--you're supposed to hang your hammock on those hooks. You provide the hammock. The hotel provides the hooks. What more can you ask of a modern hotel?\"  \"Huh! And if a guy wants a bath, there's the river, all full o' 'gators and cattawampuses and things. And if ye eat, I s'pose ye rustle yer own grub and pay for eatin' it off that slab table there. There's jest one thing ye can say for this dump--a feller can spit on the floor. But with all them cracks in it he might not hit it, at that. Mother of mine! To think Missus Ryan's li'l' boy should ever git caught stayin' in a hole like this, along o' drunks and skiddin' she-goats and--did ye say a Dutchman?\"  \"German. Chap named Schwandorf.\"  \"Yeah?\" Tim's tone was sinister. \"Say, Cap, gimme the room next that guy. And if ye hear anybody yowlin' before mornin' don't git worried. It won't be me.\"  \"None of that, Tim,\" warned Knowlton. \"The war's over--\"  \"Since when? There wasn't no peace treaty signed when we left the States.\"  \"Er--ahum! Well, technically you're right. But this fellow may be useful to us. He knows the upper river, they say.\"  \"Aw, well, if ye can use him I'll lay off him. Where is he?\"  \"Out somewhere,\" answered McKay. \"I haven't seen him yet. Want this first room, Merry?\"  \"Just to play safe, I'll take the one next the German. And if I hear any war in the night, Tim, I'm coming over the top with both hands going.\"  \"Grrrumph!\" growled Tim.  \"That goes, Tim,\" warned McKay. \"I'll take this room and you can have the one between us. Here comes the baggage train with our stuff. In here, men!\"  Puffing and grunting, Antonio and Jorge and Rosario and Meldo shuffled in with the boxes and bundles. Under the directions of McKay and Knowlton, these were stowed in the bare rooms. Then the four shuffled out again, grinning happily over a small roll of Brazilian paper reis which McKay had peeled from a much larger roll and handed to them. Immediately following their departure, in came a youth carrying three new hammocks.  \"Our beds,\" McKay explained. \"I sent this lad to a trader's store for them. He's the proprietor's son. Thank you, Thomaz. Tell your father to put these on our bill, and take for yourself this small token of our appreciation.\"  More reis changed hands. The young Brazilian, with a flash of teeth, informed them that the evening meal would soon be ready and disappeared through a rear door.  \"Do they really feed us at this here, now, hotel?\" Tim demanded. \"Then the goat's safe.\"  \"Meaning?\" puzzled Knowlton.  \"Meanin' I didn't know but we had to kill our supper, and I was goin' to git the cap'n's goat. That is, the goat the cap'n's kiddin'--I mean the goat that's kiddin' the cap--the skiddin' she-goat--Aw, rats! ye know what I'm drivin' at. Me tongue so dry it don't work right.\"  Wherewith Tim retreated in disorder to his room and began wrestling with his new hammock and the iron hooks.  Swift darkness filled the rooms. The sun had slid down below the bulge of the fast-rolling world. Thomaz re-entered, lit candles stuck in empty bottles, and, with a bow, placed one of these crude illuminants at the door of each of the strangers. By the flickering lights McKay and Knowlton disposed their effects according to their individual desires, bearing in mind Tim's observation that any small article dropped on the floor would land in the mud under the house, whence sounded the grunts of pigs. Their work was soon completed, and they sauntered together to the small piazza.  \"Nice quiet little place,\" commented Knowlton. \"Make a good sanitarium for nervous folks.\"  The comment was made in a tone which, in the daytime, would carry half a mile. McKay nodded to save a similar effort. The outbreak of the howling monkey which so startled Tim had been only the first note of the night concert of the jungle. Now that the sun was gone the chorus was in full swing.  Beasts of the village, the jungle, the river, all hurled their voices into the uproar. From the gloom around the houses rose the bellowing of cows and calves, the howls and yelps of dogs, the yowling of cats, the grunts and squeals of hogs. In the black river, flowing past within a stone's throw of the hotel door, sounded the loud snorts of dolphins and the hideous night call of the foul beast of the mud--the alligator. Out from the matted tangle of trees and brush and great snakelike vines behind the town rolled the appalling roars of guaribas, raucous bird calls, dismal hoots, sudden scattered screams. And over all, whelming all other sound by the sheer might of its penetrating power, throbbed the rapid-fire hammering of millions of frogs.  \"Frogs sound like a machine-gun barrage,\" the blond man added.  \"Or thousands of riveting hammers pounding steel.\"  \"Queer how much worse it is when you're right in it. We've heard it all the way up two thousand miles of Amazon, but--\"  \"But you're right beside the orchestra now. Position is everything in life.\"  The double-edged jest made Knowlton glance sidelong at his mate. Of the tall, eagle-faced"]]]
