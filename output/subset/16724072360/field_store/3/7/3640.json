Yeast    4 good sized potatoes   1 quart of boiling water   2 tablespoonfuls of sugar   1 tablespoonful of salt  Pare and grate the potatoes into the hot water, stir over the fire until it reaches boiling point, and simmer gently for five minutes. Take from the fire, add the sugar and salt, and when lukewarm add a cupful of yeast, or two dry yeast cakes that have been moistened in a little water, or one cake of compressed yeast. Turn the mixture into a jar and cover with a saucer. Stir it down as fast as it comes to the top of the jar. When it falls, or ceases to be very light, which will be five or six hours, pour it into a bottle, put the cork in very loosely and stand it in a cold place. Use one cupful of this to each two loaves of bread.   German Potato Bread  Boil one potato until tender; mash it through a sieve, add to it a half pint of warm water and a teaspoonful of sugar. Stir in one cupful of flour and one cupful of yeast; let this stand for two hours, or until very light. It is better to make this at seven o'clock, so the bread may be sponged at nine or ten. Scald a pint of milk, add to it a pint of water, beat in a quart and a pint of flour. The batter should be thick enough to drop, rather than pour from the spoon. Then stir in the potato starter, and stand in a place about 65° Fahr. over night. Next morning knead thoroughly, adding flour. Put this aside until very light, about two hours, then mold into loaves, put it into square greased pans, and when light bake in a moderately quick oven three-quarters of an hour.  This recipe will make two box loaves and a dozen rolls.   Nineteenth Century Bread  Scald a pint of milk, add a pint of water, a teaspoonful of salt, and when lukewarm, one compressed yeast cake moistened in a little warm water. Add sufficient whole wheat flour to make a batter, beat thoroughly, cover and stand aside two and a half hours; then stir, adding more whole wheat flour until you have a dough. Knead quickly, separate into loaves, put each in a square greased pan, cover and stand in a warm place about one hour, until very light. Slash the top with a sharp knife, brush with water and bake in a moderate oven three-quarters of an hour.   White Bread  Add a pint of water to a pint of scalded milk; when lukewarm add one compressed yeast cake, moistened, and a teaspoonful of salt. Add sufficient flour gradually, beating all the while, to make a dough. Knead this dough until it is soft and elastic, and free from stickiness. Put it into a greased bowl, stand it in a warm place three hours. Separate it into loaves, knead five minutes, put the loaves in square greased pans and stand aside until very light. Slash the top with a sharp knife, brush with water, and bake in a moderate oven three-quarters of an hour. This should make two loaves, or a dozen bread sticks and a dozen rolls.   Nut Bread     1 quart of flour    4 level teaspoonfuls of baking powder    1 teaspoonful of salt    1 cupful of chopped nuts   1½ cupfuls of milk  Add the baking powder and salt to the flour and sift them. Add the nuts, mix thoroughly and gradually add the milk. Knead this into a loaf, put it into a square pan, brush the top with melted butter, let it stand twenty minutes, and bake in a moderate oven three-quarters of an hour.   Anchovy Sandwiches  Beat a quarter of a pound of butter to a cream, adding gradually two tablespoonfuls of lemon juice, a saltspoonful of paprika, two tablespoonfuls of anchovy paste.

Caviar Sandwiches No. 2  Cut slices of bread in crescent-shaped pieces, butter one side and toast. Have ready two hard-boiled eggs, remove yolks, put them through sieve, chop whites very fine, and spread toast with layer of caviar; then sprinkle over first a little of whites, then a little of the yolks of the eggs. Put over in the form of a ring a piece of onion, the onion having first been cut into thin slices, and then separated.   Celery Sandwiches  Cut slices of bread, butter one side and toast. Cut the white part of celery into thin slices, cover it over the bread, then cover this with a layer of mayonnaise dressing, cover with another piece of toast, cut into squares and serve. All sandwiches of this kind must be used as soon as made.   Celery Salad Sandwiches  Put four eggs into warm water; bring to the boiling point, and keep there, without boiling, for fifteen minutes.

Butter the bread before you cut it from the loaf. After you have a sufficient quantity cut, put over each slice a layer of the mixed egg and celery; put right in the center of this a teaspoonful of mayonnaise dressing, and sort of smooth it all over. Put two pieces together and press them lightly. Trim off the crusts, and cut the sandwiches into pieces about two inches wide and the length of the slices.   Rolled Bread and Butter Sandwiches  Beat the butter to a cream. Remove the crusts from the loaf, butter each slice before you cut it off, and roll at once. These may be tied with narrow baby ribbon or wrapped at once in waxed paper, fringing and twisting the ends.   Rolled Chicken Sandwiches  Trim the crusts from the entire loaf, butter each slice and cut it off as thin as possible; spread it quickly with the mixture, roll and wrap it at once in waxed paper. If the bread is home-made and cracks in the rolling, put a colander over a kettle of boiling water, throw in it a few slices at a time, as soon as they have softened spread them with soft butter, then cover with the mixture, roll and wrap in waxed paper.  To make the mixture, chop sufficient cold boiled chicken to make a pint. Rub together two level tablespoonfuls of butter and two of flour, add slowly a half cupful of hot milk, stir over the fire for a minute, then add the chicken, a level teaspoonful of salt, a half teaspoonful of celery seed, a saltspoonful of white pepper, a dash of red pepper, a teaspoonful of onion juice and a grating of nutmeg; mix and cool.

Take the center from a head of lettuce; hold it together, and slice it down in sort of shreds; put this over the cucumber, and have ready some white meat of chicken, cut into the thinnest possible slices, and cover the lettuce with chicken; then sprinkle over more shredded lettuce and a little mayonnaise; put over another slice of buttered bread; press the two together, trim into shape and serve on a napkin in a pretty wicker basket.
