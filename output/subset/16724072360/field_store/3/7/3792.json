Except, of course, for a joke.\" He paused. \"Joke?\" he said, in a slightly uneasy tone.  \"Sure,\" Malone said. \"Joke.\"  Mitchell looked relieved. \"Very well, then,\" he began. \"Since--\"  \"Wait a minute,\" Malone said. \"The pig-Latin is a joke. That's right. But I'm not talking about the pig-Latin.\"  \"You're not?\" Mitchell asked, surprised.  \"No,\" Malone said.  Mitchell frowned. \"But you said--\" he began.  \"A joke,\" Malone said. \"You were perfectly right. The pig-Latin is a joke.\" He waited for Fred's expression to clear, and then added: \"But what I want to talk to you about isn't.\"  \"It sounds very confused,\" Fred said after a pause. \"Not at all the sort of thing that ... that usually goes on.\"  \"You have no idea,\" Malone said. \"It's about the political machines, all right, but it isn't anything as simple as pig-Latin.\" He explained, taking his time over it.  When he had finished, Fred was nodding his head slowly. \"I see,\" he said. \"I understand just what you want me to do.\"  \"Good,\" Malone said.  \"I'll take a team over to the Senate Office Building,\" Fred said, \"and check the computer-secretaries there. That way, you see, I'll be able to do a full running check on them without taking any one machine out of operation for too long.\"  \"Sure,\" Malone said.  \"And it shouldn't take long,\" Fred went on, \"to find out just what the trouble is.\" He looked very confident.  \"How long?\" Malone asked.  Fred shrugged. \"Oh,\" he said, \"five or six days.\"  Malone repressed an impulse to scream. \"Days?\" he said. \"I mean ... well, look, Fred, it's important. Very important. Can't you do the job any faster?\"  Fred gave a little sigh. \"Checking and repairing all those machines,\" he said, \"is an extremely complex job. Sometimes, Malone, I don't think you realize quite how complex, and how delicate a job it is to deal with such a high-order machine. Why--\"  \"Wait a minute,\" Malone said. \"Check and repair them?\"  \"Of course,\" Fred said.  \"But I don't want them repaired,\" Malone said. Seeing the look of horror on Fred's face, he added hastily: \"I only want a report from you on what's wrong, whether they are actually making errors or not. And if they are making errors, just what's making them do it. And just what kind of errors. See?\"  Fred nodded very slowly. \"But I can't just ... just leave them there,\" he said piteously. \"In ... pieces and everything. It isn't right, Malone. It just isn't right.\"  \"Well, then,\" Malone said with energy, \"you go right ahead and repair them, if you want to. Fix 'em all up. But you can do that _after_ you make the report to me, can't you?\"  \"I--\" Fred hesitated. \"I had planned to check and repair each machine on an individual basis--\"  \"The Congress can allow for a short suspension,\" Malone said. \"Anyhow, they can now--or as soon as I get the word to them. Suppose you check all the machines first, and then get around to the repair work.\"  \"It's not the best way,\" Fred demurred.  Malone discovered that it was his turn to sigh. \"Is it the fastest?\" he said.  Fred nodded.  \"Then it's the best,\" Malone said. \"How long?\"  Fred rolled his eyes to the ceiling and calculated silently for a second. \"Tomorrow morning,\" he announced, returning his gaze to Malone.  \"Fine,\" Malone said. \"Fine.\"  \"But--\"  \"Never mind the buts,\" Malone said hurriedly. \"I'll count on hearing from you tomorrow morning.\"  \"Oh--\" Fred said. \"All right.\"  \"And if it looks like sabotage,\" Malone added, \"if the errors aren't caused by normal wear and tear on the machines--you let me know right away. Phone me. Don't waste an instant.\"  [Illustration]  \"I'll ... I'll start right away,\" Fred said heavily. He looked sadly at the mechanism he had been working on, and put his screwdriver down next to it. It looked to Malone as if he were putting flowers on the grave of a dear departed. \"I'll get a team together,\" Fred added. He gave the mechanism and screwdriver one last fond parting look.  Malone looked after him for a second, thinking of nothing in particular, and then turned in the opposite direction and headed back toward the elevator. As he walked, he began to feel more and more pleased with himself. After all, he'd gotten the investigation started, hadn't he?  And now all he had to do was go back to his office and read some reports and listen to some interview tapes, and then he could go home.  The reports and the interview tapes didn't exactly sound like fun, Malone thought, but at the same time they seemed fairly innocent. He would work his way through them grimly, and maybe he would even indulge his most secret vice and smoke a cigar or two to make the work pass more pleasantly. Soon enough, he told himself, they would be finished with.  Sometimes, though, he regretted the reputation he'd gotten. It had been bad enough in the old days--the pre-1971 days when Malone had thought he was just lucky. Burris had called him a Boy Wonder then, when he'd cracked three difficult cases in a row. Being just lucky had made it a little tough to live with the Boy Wonder label--after all, Malone thought, it wasn't actually as if he'd done anything.  But since 1971 and the case of the Telepathic Spy, things had gotten worse. Much worse. Now Malone wasn't just lucky any more. Instead, he could teleport and he could even foretell the future a little, in a dim sort of way. He'd caught the Telepathic Spy that way, and when the case of the Teleporting Juvenile Delinquents had come up he'd been assigned to that one too, and he'd cracked it. Now Burris seemed to think of him as a kind of god, and gave him all the tough dirty jobs.  And if he wasn't just lucky any more, Malone couldn't think of himself as a Fearless, Heroic FBI Agent, either. He just wasn't the type. He was--well, talented. That was the word, he told himself: talented. He had all these talents and they made him look like something spectacular to Burris and the other FBI men. But he wasn't, really. He hadn't done anything really tough to get his talents; they'd just happened to him.  Nobody, though, seemed to believe that. He heaved a little sigh and stepped into the waiting elevator.  There were, after all, he thought, compensations. He'd had some good times, and the talents did come in handy. And he did have his pick of the vacation schedule lately. And he'd met some lovely girls--  And besides, he told himself savagely as the elevator shot upward, he wasn't going to do anything except return to his office and read some reports and listen to some tapes. And then he was going to go home and sleep all night, peacefully. And in the morning Mitchell was going to call him up and tell him that the computer-secretaries needed nothing more than a little repair. He'd say they were getting old, and he'd be a little pathetic about it; but it wouldn't be anything serious. Malone would send out orders to get the machines repaired, and that would be that. And then the next case would be something both normal and exciting, like a bank robbery or a kidnapping involving a gorgeous blonde who would be so grateful to Malone that--  He had stepped out of the elevator and gone down the corridor without noticing it. He pushed at his own office door and walked into the outer room. The train of thought he had been following was very nice, and sounded very attractive indeed, he told himself.  Unfortunately, he didn't believe it. His prescient ability, functioning with its usual efficient aplomb, told Malone that things would not be better, or simpler, in the morning. They would be worse, and more complicated.  They would be quite a lot worse.  And, as usual, that prescience was perfectly accurate.   II  The telephone, Malone realized belatedly, had had a particularly nasty-sounding ring. He might have known it would be bad news.  As a matter of fact, he told himself sadly, he had known.  \"Nothing at all wrong?\" he said into the mouthpiece. \"Not with any of the computers?\" He blinked. \"Not even one of them?\"  \"Not a thing,\" Mitchell said. \"I'll be sending a report up to you in a little while. You read it; we put them through every test, and it's all detailed there.\"  \"I'm sure you were very thorough,\" Malone said helplessly.  \"Of course we were,\" Mitchell said. \"Of course. And the machines passed every single test. Every one. Malone, it was beautiful.\"  \"Goody,\" Malone said at random. \"But there's got to be something--\"  \"There is, Malone,\" Fred said. \"There is. I think there's definitely something odd going on. Something funny. I mean peculiar, not humorous.\"  \"I thought so,\" Malone put in.  \"Right,\" Fred said. \"Malone, try and relax. This is a hard thing to say, and it must be even harder to hear. But--\"  \"Tell me,\" Malone said. \"Who's dead? Who's been killed?\"  \"I know it's tough, Malone,\" Fred went on.  \"Is everybody dead?\" Malone said. \"It can't be just one person, not from that tone in your voice. Has somebody assassinated the entire Senate? Or the President and his Cabinet? Or--\"  \"It's nothing like that, Malone,\" Fred said, in a tone that implied that such occurrences were really rather minor. \"It's the machines.\"  \"The machines?\"  \"That's right,\" Fred said grimly. \"After we checked them over and found they were in good shape, I asked for samples of both the input and the output of each machine. I wanted to do a thorough job.\"  \"Congratulations,\" Malone said. \"What happened?\"  Fred took a deep breath. \"They don't agree,\" he said.  \"They don't?\" Malone said. The phrase sounded as if it meant something momentous, but he couldn't quite figure out what. In a minute, he thought confusedly, it would come to him. But did he want it to?  \"They definitely do not agree,\" Fred was saying. \"The correlation is erratic; it makes no statistical sense. Malone, there are two possibilities.\"  \"Tell me about them,\" Malone said. He was beginning to feel relieved. To Fred, the malfunction of a machine was more serious than the murder of the entire Congress. But Malone couldn't"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30438"],["title","The Eyes Have It (#1)"],["body","a quarter of his glass.  The five glasses tipped and were returned to the table. Again there was silence as the men waited.  \"To get back,\" Heidel said, listening with excitement to his own voice. \"Dr. Kingly, in the process of an autopsy on a derelict Martian, made a rather startling discovery ...\"  \"I beg your pardon,\" Forbes said. \"Did you say autopsy?\"  \"Yes,\" said Heidel. \"We've done this frequently. Not according to base orders, you understand.\" He winked. \"But a little infraction now and then is necessary.\"  \"I see,\" said Forbes. \"I just didn't know about that.\"  \"No, you didn't, did you?\" said Heidel, looking at Forbes closely. \"At any rate, Dr. Kingly had developed in his work a preserving solution which he used in such instances, thereby prolonging the time for examination of the cadaver, without experiencing deterioration of the tissues. This solution was merely injected into the blood stream, and ...\"  \"Sorry again, sir,\" Forbes said. \"But you said blood stream?\"  \"Yes,\" Heidel nodded. \"This had to be done before the cadaver was a cadaver, you see?\"  \"I think so, yes,\" said Forbes, leaning back again. \"Murdered the bastard for an autopsy, what?\"  Heidel's fingers closed around the pistol. \"I don't like that, Forbes.\"  \"Terribly sorry, sir.\"  \"To get on,\" Heidel said finally, his voice a cutting sound. \"Dr. Kingly had injected his solution and then ... Well, at any rate, when he returned to his laboratory, it was night. His laboratory was black as pitch--I'm trying to paint the picture for you, gentlemen--and the cadaver was stretched out on a table, you see. And before Dr. Kingly switched on the lights, he saw the eyes of this dead Martian glowing in the dark like a pair of hot coals.\"  \"Weird,\" said Sadler, unblinking.  \"Ghostly,\" said Clarke.  \"The important thing,\" Heidel said curtly, \"is that Dr. Kingly discovered the difference, then, between the Martian and the Earthman. The difference is the eyes. The solution, you see, had reacted chemically to the membranes of the eyeballs, so that as it happened they lit up like electric lights. I won't go into what Dr. Kingly found further, when he dissected the eyeballs. Let it suffice to say, the Martian eyeball is a physical element entirely different from our own--at least from those of five of us, I should say.\"  His grin gleamed. He was working this precisely and carefully, and it was effective. \"Now, however,\" he continued, \"it is this _sixth_ man who is at issue right now. The fly in the soup, shall we say. And in just a few seconds I am going to exterminate that fly.\"  He picked up the pistol from the table. \"As I told you, gentlemen, I am quite versatile with this weapon. I am a dead shot, in other words. And I am going to demonstrate it to you.\" He glanced from face to face.  \"You will notice that since Mr. Meehan has moved, I have a clear field across the table. I don't believe a little lead in the woodwork will mar the room too much, would you say, Forbes?\"  Forbes sat very still. \"No, I shouldn't think so, sir.\"  \"Good. Because I am going to snuff out each of the four candles in the center of this table by shooting the wick away. You follow me, gentlemen? Locke? Meehan? Sadler?\"  Heads nodded.  \"Then perhaps you are already ahead of me. When the last candle is extinguished, we will have darkness, you see. And then I think we'll find our Martian rat. Because, as a matter of fact,\" Heidel lolled his words, \"I have taken the privilege of adding to the wine we have been drinking Dr. Kingly's preserving solution. Non-tasteful, non-harmful. Except, that is, to one man in this room.\"  Heidel motioned his gun. \"And God rest the bastard's soul, because if you will remember, I have five bullets in the chamber of this pistol. Four for the candles and one for the brain of the sonofabitch whose eyes light up when the last candle goes out.\"         *       *       *       *       *  There was a steady deadly silence while the flames of the candles licked at the still air.  \"I think, however,\" Heidel said, savoring the moment, \"that we should have one final toast before we proceed.\" He lifted his glass. \"May the receiver of the fifth bullet go straight to hell. I phrase that literally, gentlemen,\" he said, laughing. \"Drink up!\"  The glasses were drained and placed again on the table.  \"Watch carefully,\" Heidel said and lifted the pistol. He aimed at the first candle. The trigger was taut against his finger, the explosion loud in the room.  \"One,\" said Heidel.  He aimed again. The explosion.  \"Two,\" he said. \"Rather good, eh?\"  \"Oh, yes,\" Sadler said.  \"Quite,\" said Forbes.  \"Again,\" said Heidel. A third shot echoed.  \"Now,\" he said, pointing the muzzle at the last candle. \"I would say this is it, wouldn't you, gentlemen? And as soon as this one goes, I'm afraid one of us is going to find a bullet right between his goddam sparkling eyes. Are you ready?\"  He squinted one eye and looked down the sights. He squeezed the trigger, the room echoed and there was blackness. Heidel held his pistol poised over the table.  Silence.  \"Well,\" said Forbes finally. \"There you have it. Surprise, what?\"  Heidel balanced the pistol, feeling his palm go suddenly moist against the black grip, and he looked around at the five pairs of glowing eyes.  \"Bit of a shock, I should imagine,\" Forbes said. \"Discovering all of us, as it were.\"  Heidel licked his lips. \"How? _How_ could you do this?\"  Forbes remained motionless. \"Simple as one, you know. Put men on rockets going back to Earth in place of returning colonists. Study. Observe. Learn. Shift a record here and there. Forge, change pictures, all that sort of thing. Poor contact between here and Earth, you know. Not too difficult.\"  \"I'll get one of you,\" Heidel said, still balancing his pistol tightly.  \"Well, possibly,\" Forbes said. \"But no more than one. You have three guns pointed at you. We can see you perfectly, you know, as though it were broad daylight. One shiver of that pistol, and you're dead.\"  \"Why have you done this?\" Heidel said suddenly. \"_Why?_ Everything that was done was for the Martian. We tried to give you freedom and culture, the benefit of our knowledge....\"  \"We didn't like your wrestlers,\" Forbes said.  Heidel's nostrils twitched, and suddenly he swung the pistol. There was a crashing explosion and then silence.  \"Good,\" said Forbes. \"I don't think he got the last one fired.\"  \"You're all right then?\" asked Meehan, putting his gun on the table.  \"Oh, quite! Rather dramatic altogether, eh?\"  \"Nerve tingling,\" Locke agreed.  Forbes turned in his chair and called, \"Oh, Kessit!\"  The butler opened the door to the darkened room, hesitated, and reached for the light switch.  \"No, no,\" Forbes said, smiling. \"Never mind that. Come over here, will you please?\"  The butler crossed the room slowly.  \"It's all right,\" Forbes said. \"The president will notice nothing whatever, Kessit. Would you mind pouring us all another glass of wine? I'm frightfully crazy about that port, eh?\"  There was a murmur of agreeing voices. The butler lifted the silver decanter and filled glasses, moving easily and surely in the darkness.  \"Cheers,\" said Forbes.  \"Cheers,\" said the others, over the clink of glasses.
