Delayed circuit reactions kept it silent until it heard the elevator door close.         *       *       *       *       *  \"You were very warm in there,\" the voice within his head whispered, once he was on the street. \"But you still don't understand everything.\"  \"Tell me, then,\" Anders said, marveling a little at his equanimity. In an hour he had bridged the gap to a completely different viewpoint, yet it seemed perfectly natural.  \"I can't,\" the voice said. \"You must find it yourself.\"  \"Well, let's see now,\" Anders began. He looked around at the masses of masonry, the convention of streets cutting through the architectural piles. \"Human life,\" he said, \"is a series of conventions. When you look at a girl, you're supposed to see--a pattern, not the underlying formlessness.\"  \"That's true,\" the voice agreed, but with a shade of doubt.  \"Basically, there is no form. Man produces _gestalts_, and cuts form out of the plethora of nothingness. It's like looking at a set of lines and saying that they represent a figure. We look at a mass of material, extract it from the background and say it's a man. But in truth there is no such thing. There are only the humanizing features that we--myopically--attach to it. Matter is conjoined, a matter of viewpoint.\"  \"You're not seeing it now,\" said the voice.  \"Damn it,\" Anders said. He was certain that he was on the track of something big, perhaps something ultimate. \"Everyone's had the experience. At some time in his life, everyone looks at a familiar object and can't make any sense out of it. Momentarily, the _gestalt_ fails, but the true moment of sight passes. The mind reverts to the superimposed pattern. Normalcy continues.\"  The voice was silent. Anders walked on, through the _gestalt_ city.  \"There's something else, isn't there?\" Anders asked.  \"Yes.\"  What could that be, he asked himself. Through clearing eyes, Anders looked at the formality he had called his world.  He wondered momentarily if he would have come to this if the voice hadn't guided him. Yes, he decided after a few moments, it was inevitable.  But who was the voice? And what had he left out?  \"Let's see what a party looks like now,\" he said to the voice.         *       *       *       *       *  The party was a masquerade; the guests were all wearing their faces. To Anders, their motives, individually and collectively, were painfully apparent. Then his vision began to clear further.  He saw that the people weren't truly individual. They were discontinuous lumps of flesh sharing a common vocabulary, yet not even truly discontinuous.  The lumps of flesh were a part of the decoration of the room and almost indistinguishable from it. They were one with the lights, which lent their tiny vision. They were joined to the sounds they made, a few feeble tones out of the great possibility of sound. They blended into the walls.  The kaleidoscopic view came so fast that Anders had trouble sorting his new impressions. He knew now that these people existed only as patterns, on the same basis as the sounds they made and the things they thought they saw.  _Gestalts_, sifted out of the vast, unbearable real world.  \"Where's Judy?\" a discontinuous lump of flesh asked him. This particular lump possessed enough nervous mannerisms to convince the other lumps of his reality. He wore a loud tie as further evidence.  \"She's sick,\" Anders said. The flesh quivered into an instant sympathy. Lines of formal mirth shifted to formal woe.  \"Hope it isn't anything serious,\" the vocal flesh remarked.  \"You're warmer,\" the voice said to Anders.  Anders looked at the object in front of him.  \"She hasn't long to live,\" he stated.  The flesh quivered. Stomach and intestines contracted in sympathetic fear. Eyes distended, mouth quivered.  The loud tie remained the same.  \"My God! You don't mean it!\"  \"What are you?\" Anders asked quietly.  \"What do you mean?\" the indignant flesh attached to the tie demanded. Serene within its reality, it gaped at Anders. Its mouth twitched, undeniable proof that it was real and sufficient. \"You're drunk,\" it sneered.  Anders laughed and left the party.         *       *       *       *       *  \"There is still something you don't know,\" the voice said. \"But you were hot! I could feel you near me.\"  \"What are you?\" Anders asked again.  \"I don't know,\" the voice admitted. \"I am a person. I am I. I am trapped.\"  \"So are we all,\" Anders said. He walked on asphalt, surrounded by heaps of concrete, silicates, aluminum and iron alloys. Shapeless, meaningless heaps that made up the _gestalt_ city.  And then there were the imaginary lines of demarcation dividing city from city, the artificial boundaries of water and land.  All ridiculous.  \"Give me a dime for some coffee, mister?\" something asked, a thing indistinguishable from any other thing.  \"Old Bishop Berkeley would give a nonexistent dime to your nonexistent presence,\" Anders said gaily.  \"I'm really in a bad way,\" the voice whined, and Anders perceived that it was no more than a series of modulated vibrations.  \"Yes! Go on!\" the voice commanded.  \"If you could spare me a quarter--\" the vibrations said, with a deep pretense at meaning.  No, what was there behind the senseless patterns? Flesh, mass. What was that? All made up of atoms.  \"I'm really hungry,\" the intricately arranged atoms muttered.  All atoms. Conjoined. There were no true separations between atom and atom. Flesh was stone, stone was light. Anders looked at the masses of atoms that were pretending to solidity, meaning and reason.  \"Can't you help me?\" a clump of atoms asked. But the clump was identical with all the other atoms. Once you ignored the superimposed patterns, you could see the atoms were random, scattered.  \"I don't believe in you,\" Anders said.  The pile of atoms was gone.  \"Yes!\" the voice cried. \"Yes!\"  \"I don't believe in any of it,\" Anders said. After all, what was an atom?  \"Go on!\" the voice shouted. \"You're hot! Go on!\"  What was an atom? An empty space surrounded by an empty space.  Absurd!  \"Then it's all false!\" Anders said. And he was alone under the stars.  \"That's right!\" the voice within his head screamed. \"Nothing!\"  But stars, Anders thought. How can one believe--  The stars disappeared. Anders was in a gray nothingness, a void. There was nothing around him except shapeless gray.  Where was the voice?  Gone.  Anders perceived the delusion behind the grayness, and then there was nothing at all.  Complete nothingness, and himself within it.         *       *       *       *       *  Where was he? What did it mean? Anders' mind tried to add it up.  Impossible. _That_ couldn't be true.  Again the score was tabulated, but Anders' mind couldn't accept the total. In desperation, the overloaded mind erased the figures, eradicated the knowledge, erased itself.  \"Where am I?\"  In nothingness. Alone.  Trapped.  \"Who am I?\"  A voice.  The voice of Anders searched the nothingness, shouted, \"Is there anyone here?\"  No answer.  But there was someone. All directions were the same, yet moving along one he could make contact ... with someone. The voice of Anders reached back to someone who could save him, perhaps.  \"Save me,\" the voice said to Anders, lying fully dressed on his bed, except for his shoes and black bow tie.                                                       --ROBERT SHECKLEY     Transcriber's Note:      This etext was produced from _Galaxy Science Fiction_ June 1953.

It is invaluable, whether for making soup or gravy, or for strengthening or giving flavour to many dishes; and it is not only superior to, but far cheaper than, any similar preparation now before the public.  Now that clear soup is so constantly required, and a thing of every-day use, Nelson's Extract of Meat will be found a great boon. With the addition of a little vegetable flavouring, a packet of the Extract will make a pint of soup as good and as fine as that produced, at much labour and expense, from fresh meat. With a judicious use of the liquor derived from boiling fowls, rabbits, and fresh meat, an endless variety of soup may be made, by the addition of Nelson's Extract of Meat. Some recipes are given by which first-class soups can be prepared in a short time, at a very small cost, and with but little trouble. It may be as well to say that soaking for a few minutes in cold water facilitates the solution of the Extract of Meat.  NELSON'S SOUPS are deserving of the attention of every housekeeper, for they combine all the elements of good nourishment, have an excellent flavour, both of meat and vegetables, are prepared by merely boiling the contents of a packet for fifteen minutes, and are so cheap as to be within everybody's means. Penny packets of these soups, for charitable purposes, will be found most useful and nourishing.  Those who have to cater for a family know how often a little soup will make up a dinner that would otherwise be insufficient; yet because of the time and trouble required in the preparation, it is impossible to have it. In a case like this, or when a supplementary dish is unexpectedly required, Nelson's Soups are most useful. Although these Soups are all that can be desired, made with water according to the directions given with each packet, they can be utilised with great advantage for strengthening household stock.  For instance, the liquor in which a leg of mutton has been boiled, or of pork, if not too salt, can be at once, by using a packet or two of Nelson's Soup, converted into a delicious and nourishing soup, and at a cost surprisingly small. Or the bones of any joint can be made into stock, and, after all the fat has been skimmed off, have a packet of Nelson's Soup added, in the same manner as in the directions.  NELSON'S BEEF TEA will be found of the highest value, supplying a cup of unequalled nourishment, combining all the constituents of fresh beef. No other preparation now before the public contains that most important element, albumen, in a soluble form, as well as much of the fibrin of the meat. This Beef Tea is also generally relished by invalids, and merely requires to be dissolved in boiling water.  NEW ZEALAND MUTTON.--For information respecting this meat, and the great advantage as well as economy of its use, see page 119.  NELSON'S TINNED MEATS, known as the \"Tomoana Brand,\" are prepared at the works of NELSON BROS., LIMITED, Hawke's Bay, New Zealand, from the finest cattle of the country. Messrs. NELSON specially recommend their \"Pressed Mutton and Green Peas,\" \"Haricot Mutton,\" and \"Pressed Corned Mutton.\" The \"Stewed Kidneys\" will be found of a quality superior to any articles of the kind now in the market, while the price places them within the reach of all classes of consumers.  NELSON'S GELATINE having now been favourably known all over the world for more than half a century, it is unnecessary to do more than observe that our efforts are constantly directed to supplying a perfectly pure article, always of the same strength and quality. When Russian isinglass was first introduced into this country, the prejudices against its use on the part of our great-grandmothers were violent and extreme; for those worthy ladies would not believe that some unfamiliar substance, of the origin of which they were either ignorant or doubtful, could form an efficient substitute for the well-known calves' feet and cow-heels, from which they had always been in the habit of making their jellies and blanc-manges. By degrees, however, the Gelatine made its way, and at length superseded the old system entirely; and its popularity is demonstrated by the fact that the works at Emscote, near Warwick, cover nearly five acres.         *       *       *       *       *  N.B.--It is necessary to call attention to the fact that in all the following recipes in which Nelson's Gelatine and Specialities are used, the quantities are calculated for _their manufactures only_, the quality and strength of which may be relied upon for uniformity.     NELSON'S HOME COMFORTS.  ***  SOUPS.  ***   BEEF AND ONION SOUP.  A pint of very good soup can be made by following the directions which accompany each tin of Nelson's Beef and Onion Soup, viz. to soak the contents in a pint of cold water for fifteen minutes, then place over the fire, stir, and boil for fifteen minutes. It is delicious when combined with a tin of Nelson's Extract of Meat, thus producing a quart of nutritious and appetising soup.   NELSON'S MULLIGATAWNY SOUP.  Soaked in cold water for a quarter of an hour, and then boiled for fifteen minutes, Nelson's Mulligatawny Soup is very appetising and delicious. It should be eaten with boiled rice; and for those who like the soup even hotter than that in the above preparation, the accompanying rice may be curried. In either case the rice should be boiled so that each grain should be separate and distinct from the rest.   BEEF, LENTIL, AND VEGETABLE SOUP.  Pour one quart of boiling water upon the contents of a tin of Nelson's Soup of the above title, stirring briskly. The water must be boiling. A little seasoning of salt and pepper may be added for accustomed palates. This soup is perfectly delicious if prepared as follows: Cut two peeled onions into quarters, tie them in a muslin bag, and let the soup boil for twenty minutes with them. Take out the bag before serving the soup.   BEEF, PEA, AND VEGETABLE SOUP.  The directions printed on each packet of Nelson's Beef, Pea, and Vegetable Soup produce a satisfactory soup, but even this may be improved by the addition of the contents of a tin of Nelson's Extract of Meat and a handful of freshly-gathered peas. It is perhaps not generally known that pea-pods, usually thrown away as useless, impart a most delicious flavour to soup if boiled fast for two or three hours in a large saucepan, strained, and the liquor added to the soup, stock, or beef tea.   BEEF TEA AS A SOLID.  Soak the contents of a tin of Nelson's Beef Tea in a gill of water for ten minutes. Add to this the third of an ounce packet of Nelson's Gelatine, which has been soaked for two or three hours in half-a-pint of cold water. Put the mixture in a stewpan, and stir until it reaches boiling-point. Then put it into a mould which has been rinsed with cold water. When thoroughly cold, this will turn out a most inviting and extremely nutritious dish.   CLEAR VERMICELLI SOUP.  Boil two minced onions in a quart of the liquor in which a leg of mutton has been boiled, skim well, and when the vegetables are tender strain them out. Pass the soup through a napkin, boil up, skim thoroughly, and when clear add the contents of a tin of Nelson's Extract of Meat, stirring until dissolved.  Boil two ounces of vermicelli paste in a pint of water until tender. Most shapes take about ten minutes. Take care that the water boils when you throw in the paste, and that it continues to do so during all the time of cooking, as that will keep the paste from sticking together. When done, drain it in a strainer, put it in the tureen, and pour the soup on to it.   SOUP JULIENNE.  Wash and scrape a large carrot, cut away all the yellow parts from the middle, and slice the red outside of it an inch in length, and the eighth of an inch thick. Take an equal quantity of turnip and three small onions, cut in a similar manner. Put them in a stewpan with two ounces of butter and a pinch of powdered sugar; stir over the fire until a nice brown colour, then add a quart of water and a teaspoonful of salt, and let all simmer together gently for two hours. When done skim the fat off very carefully, and ten minutes before serving add the contents of a tin of Nelson's Extract of Meat, and a cabbage-lettuce cut in shreds and blanched for a minute in boiling water; simmer for five minutes and the soup will be ready. Many cooks, to save time and trouble, use the preserved vegetables, which are to be had in great perfection at all good Italian warehouses.   BROWN RABBIT SOUP CLEAR.  Fry a quarter of a pound of onions a light brown; mince a turnip and carrot and a little piece of celery; boil these until tender in three pints of the liquor in which a rabbit has been boiled, taking care to remove all scum as it rises; strain them out, and then pass the soup through a napkin. The soup should be clear, or nearly so, but if it is not, put it in a stewpan, boil and skim until bright; then throw in the contents of a tin of Nelson's Extract of Meat, soaked for a few minutes; stir until dissolved; add pepper and salt to taste.   HARE SOUP.  Half roast a hare, and, having cut away the meat in long slices from the backbone, put it aside to make an _entrée_. Fry four onions; take a carrot, turnip, celery, a small quantity of thyme and parsley, half-a-dozen peppercorns, a small blade of mace, some bacon-bones or a slice of lean ham, with the body of the hare cut up into small pieces; put all in two quarts of water with a little salt. When you have skimmed the pot, cover close and allow it to boil gently for three hours, then strain it; take off every particle of fat, and having allowed the soup to boil up, add the contents of a tin of Nelson's Extract of Meat, and thicken it with a dessertspoonful of potato-flour; stir in two lumps of sugar, a glass of port wine, and season if necessary.
