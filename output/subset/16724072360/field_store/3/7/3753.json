I suspect that he was ashamed of them, and if I had to guess, I'd put him in the Kentucky hill-country or the Ozarks. Modern concepts seemed to be pretty well too much for him, and his thinking would have been considerably more natural at the turn of the century.  \"I had to see him several times. The police chivvied him a little, but not much; he was so obviously innocent of everything that there was nothing for them in him. And the search for the old man didn't last long; no one had seen him after that last night at Bixby's, and, since everyone had already long since concluded that he was mentally a little off center, it was easy to conclude that he had wandered away somewhere, probably an amnesiac. That he might have anticipated that is indicated in the hasty preparation of his will, which came out of the blue, said Barnevall, who drew it up for him.  \"I felt sorry for him.\"  \"For whom?\"  \"The nephew. He seemed so lost, you know--like a man who wanted to remember something, but couldn't. I noticed that several times when I tried to talk to him; I had the feeling each time that there was something he wanted desperately to say, it hovered always on the rim of his awareness, but somehow there was no bridge to it, no clue to put it into words. He tried so hard for something he couldn't put his finger on.\"  \"What became of him?\"  \"Oh, he's still around. I think he found a job somewhere. As a matter of fact, I saw him just the other evening. He had apparently just come from work and he was standing in front of Bixby's with his face pressed to the window looking in. I came up nearby and watched him. Leopold and Alexander were sitting inside--a couple of lonely old men looking out. And a lonely young man looking in. There was something in McIlvaine's face--that same thing I had noticed so often before, a kind of expression that seemed to say there was something he ought to know, something he ought to remember, to do, to say, but there was no way in which he could reach back to it.\"  \"Or forward,\" I said with a wry smile.  \"As you like,\" said Harrigan. \"Pour me another, will you?\"  I did and he took it.  \"That poor devil!\" he muttered. \"He'd be happier if he could only go back where he came from.\"  \"Wouldn't we all?\" I asked. \"But nobody ever goes home again. Perhaps McIlvaine never had a home like that.\"  \"You'd have thought so if you could have seen his face looking in at Leopold and Alexander. Oh, it may have been a trick of the streetlight there, it may have been my imagination. But it sticks to my memory, and I keep thinking how alike the two were--old McIlvaine trying so desperately to find someone who could believe him, and his nephew now trying just as hard to find someone to accept him or a place he could accept on the only terms he knows.\"   THE END     Transcriber's Note:      This etext was produced from _If Worlds of Science Fiction_ July     1952.

He had always thought the entire globe was in that new, raw, marshy state. But he had worked only in one comparatively small area of the northern hemisphere; had never been within thirty thousand miles of the red spot. What might lie in that ominous crimson patch, he could not even guess. However, he reflected, he was soon to find out, though he might never live to tell about it.  Shrugging his shoulders, he turned into the fifty story building in which was his modest apartment. There he found, written by the automatic stylus on his radio pad, the message: \"Be with you at seven o'clock. Best regards, and I hope you strangle. Dex Harlow.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Dex Harlow was a six-foot Senior Lieutenant who had been on many an out-of-the-way exploratory trip. Like Brand he was just under thirty and perpetually thirsting for the bizarre in life. He was a walking document of planetary activity. He was still baked a brick red from a trip to Mercury a year before: he had a scar on his forehead, the result of jumping forty feet one day on the moon when he'd meant to jump only twenty; he was minus a finger which had been irreparably frost-bitten on Mars; and he had a crumpled nose that was the outcome of a brush with a ten-foot bandit on Venus who'd tried to kill him for his explosive gun and supply of glass, dyite-containing cartridges.  He clutched Brand's fingers in a bone-mangling grip, and threw his hat into a far corner.  \"You're a fine friend!\" he growled cheerfully. \"Here I'm having a first rate time for myself, swimming and planing along the Riviera, with two more weeks leave ahead of me--and I get a call from the Old Man to report to you. What excuse have you for your crime?\"  \"A junket to Jupiter,\" said Brand. \"Would you call that a good excuse?\"  \"Jupiter!\" exclaimed Dex. \"Wouldn't you know it? Of course you'd have to pick a spot four hundred million miles away from all that grand swimming I was having!\"  \"Would you like to go back on leave, and have me choose someone else?\" inquired Brand solemnly.  \"Well, no,\" said Dex hastily. \"Now that I'm here, I suppose I might as well go through with it.\"  Brand laughed. \"Try and get you out of it! I know your attitude toward a real jaunt. And it's a real jaunt we've got ahead of us, too, old boy. We're going to the red spot. Immediately.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Dex's sandy eyebrows shot up. \"The red spot! That's where Coblenz and Heiroy were lost!\"  \"And Journeyman,\" added Brand. \"He's the latest victim of whatever's in the hell-hole.\"  Dex whistled. \"Journeyman too! Well, all I've got to say is that whatever's there must be strong medicine. Journeyman was a damn fine man, and as brave as they come. Have you any idea what it's all about?\"  \"Not an idea. Nobody has. We're to go and find out--if we can. Are you all ready?\"  \"All ready,\" said Dex.  \"So am I. We'll start at eleven o'clock in one of the Old Man's best cruisers. Meanwhile, we might as well go and hunt up a dinner somewhere, to fortify us against the synthetic pork chops and bread we'll be swallowing for the next fortnight.\"  They went out; and at ten minutes of eleven reported at the great space ship hangars north of New York, with their luggage, a conspicuous item of which was a chess board to help while away the long, long days of spacial travel. Brand then paused a little while for a final check-up on directions.  They clambered into the tiny control room and shut the hermetically sealed trap-door. Brand threw the control switch and precisely at eleven o'clock the conical shell of metal shot heavenward, gathering such speed that it was soon invisible to human eyes. He set their course toward the blazing speck that was Jupiter, four hundred million miles away; and then reported their start by radio to Commander Stone's night operator.  The investigatory expedition to the ominous red spot of the giant of the solar system was on.     CHAPTER II  _The Pipe-like Men_   Brand began to slacken speed on the morning of the thirteenth day (morning, of course, being a technical term: there are no horizons in space for the sun to rise over). Jupiter was still an immense distance off; but it took a great while to slow the momentum of the space ship, which, in the frictionless emptiness of space, had been traveling faster and faster for nearly three hundred hours.  Behind them was the distant ball of sun, so far off that it looked no larger than a red-hot penny. Before them was the gigantic disk of Jupiter, given a white tinge by the perpetual fog blankets, its outlines softened by its thick layer of atmosphere and cloud banks. Two of its nine satellites were in sight at the moment, with a third edging over the western rim.  \"Makes you think you're drunk and seeing triple, doesn't it?\" commented Dex, who was staring out the thick glass panel beside Brand. \"Nine moons! Almost enough for one planet!\"  Brand nodded abstractly, and concentrated on the control board. Rapidly the ship rocketed down toward the surface. The disk became a whirling, gigantic plate; and then an endless plain, with cloud formations beginning to take on definite outline.  \"About to enter Jupiter's atmosphere.\" Brand spoke into the radio transmitter. Over the invisible thread of radio connection between the space ship and Earth, four hundred million miles behind, flashed the message.  \"All right. For God's sake, be careful,\" came the answer, minutes later. \"Say something at least every half hour, to let us know communication is unbroken. We will sound at ten second intervals.\"  The sounding began: _peep_, a shrill little piping noise like the fiddle of a cricket. Ten seconds later it came again: _peep_. Thereafter, intermittently, it keened through the control room--a homely, comforting sound to let them know that there was a distant thread between them and Earth.         *       *       *       *       *  Lower the shell rocketed. The endless plain slowly ceased its rushing underneath them as they entered the planet's atmosphere and began to be pulled around with it in its revolution. Far to the west a faint red glow illumined the sky.  The two men looked at each other, grimly, soberly.  \"We're here,\" said Dex, flexing the muscles of his powerful arms.  \"We are,\" said Brand, patting the gun in his holster.  The rapid dusk of the giant planet began to close in on them. The thin sunlight darkened; and with its lowering, the red spot of Jupiter glared more luridly ahead of them. Silently the two men gazed at it, and wondered what it held.  They shot the space ship toward it, and halted a few hundred miles away. Watery white light from the satellites, \"that jitter around in the sky like a bunch of damned waterbugs,\" as Dex put it, was now the sole illumination.  They hung motionless in their space shell, to wait through the five-hour Jovian night for the succeeding five hours of daylight to illumine a slow cruise over the red area that, in less than a year, had swallowed up three of Earth's space ships. And ever as they waited, dozing a little, speculating as to the nature of the danger they faced, the peep, peep of the radio shrilled in their ears to tell them that there was still a connection--though a very tenuous one--with their mother planet.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Red spot ten miles away,\" said Brand in the transmitter. \"We're approaching it slowly.\"  The tiny sun had leaped up over Jupiter's horizon; and with its appearance they had sent the ship planing toward their mysterious destination. Beneath them the fog banks were thinning, and ahead of them were no clouds. For some reason there was a clarity unusual to Jupiter's atmosphere in the air above the red section.  \"Red spot one mile ahead, altitude forty thousand feet,\" reported Brand.  He and Dex peered intently through the port glass panel. Ahead and far below, their eyes caught an odd metallic sheen. It was as though the ground there were carpeted with polished steel that reflected red firelight.  Tense, filled with an excitement that set their pulses pounding wildly, they angled slowly down, nearer to the edge of the vast crimson area, closer to the ground. The radio keened its monotonous signal.  Brand crawled to the transmitter, laboriously, for his body tipped the scales here at nearly four hundred pounds.  \"We can see the metallic glitter that Journeyman spoke of,\" he said. \"No sign of life of any kind, though. The red glow seems to flicker a little.\"  Closer the ship floated. Closer. To right and left of them for vast distances stretched the red area. Ahead of them for hundreds of miles they knew it extended.  \"We're right on it now,\" called Brand. \"Right on it--we're going over the edge--we're--\"  Next instant he was sprawling on the floor, with Dex rolling helplessly on top of him, while the space ship bounced up twenty thousand feet as though propelled by a giant sling.         *       *       *       *       *  The peep, peep of the radio signalling stopped. The space ship rolled helplessly for a moment, then resumed an even keel. Brand and Dex gazed at each other.  \"What the hell?\" said Dex.  He started to get to his feet, put all his strength into the task of moving his Jupiter-weighted body, and crashed against the top of the control room.  \"Say!\" he sputtered, rubbing his head. \"Say, what _is_ this?\"  Brand, profiting by his mistake, rose more cautiously, shut off the atomic motor, and approached a glass panel again. \"God knows what it is,\" he said with a shrug. \"Somehow, with our passing into the red area, the pull of gravity has been reduced by about ten, that's all.\"  \"Oh, so that's all, is it? Well, what's happened to old Jupe's gravity?\"  Again Brand shrugged. \"I haven't any idea. Your guess is as good as mine.\"  He peered down through the panel, and stiffened in surprise.  \"Dex!\" he cried. \"We're moving! And the motor is shut off!\"  \"We're drawing down closer to the ground,"]]]
