Drowsily his mind wandered from the hotel's android servants ... to the strictly utilitarian mechanical monstrosity at home, known affectionately as \"Old John\" ... to the android showroom where they had seen the one that Dad said looked like Mother....  He jolted suddenly, sickeningly awake. Suppose, his mind whispered treacherously, suppose that Dad _had_ ordered one to take Mom's place ... not on Mars, but _here_ while she returned to Mars with him. Suppose that instead of Mom he discovered one of those _Things_ ... or even worse, suppose he went on from day to day not even knowing....  It was a bad five minutes; he was wet with perspiration when he lay back on his pillows, a shaky smile tugging at the corners of his mouth. He had a secret defense against the Terror. He giggled a little at the thought of what Aunt Bee would say if she knew.  And what had brought him back from the edge of hysteria was the triumphant knowledge that with the abnormally acute hearing bred in the thin atmosphere of Mars, no robot ever created could hide from him the infinitesimal ticking of the electronic relays that gave it life. Secure at last, his overstrung nerves relaxed and he slid gratefully over the edge of sleep.  He woke abruptly, groping after some vaguely remembered sound. A soft clicking of heels down the hall.... Of course, his mother back from the Spaceport! Now she would be stopping at his door to see if he were asleep. He lay silently; through his eyelashes he could see her outlined in the soft light from the hall. She was coming in to see if he was tucked in. In a moment he would jump up and startle her with a hug, as she leaned over him. In a moment....  Screaming desperately, he was out of bed, backing heedlessly across the room. He was still screaming as the low sill of the open window caught him behind the knees and toppled him thirty stories to the street.  Alone in the silent room, Helen Benton stood dazed, staring blindly at the empty window.  Tommy's parting gift from his father slid from her hand and lay on the carpet, still ticking gently.  It was 9:23 on Mars.   The End     Transcriber's Note:      This etext was produced from _Imagination Stories of Science and     Fantasy_ July 1953.

Gary looked at the man. The newspapers fluttered to the parkway. The bicycle clattered in the street.  \"Howdy, partner!\" the tall man said. \"The rustlers are headin' for the plateau! We'll take the short gash and head 'em off at the canyon!\"  \"Ramrod Jones?\" Gary chirped.  \"Here's the truck I haul Quizz-kid, the I.Q. Horse, in! Let's get after the rustlers!\" Jones said.  \"Gee, I've seen all your pictures, Ramrod,\" Gary said. \"_Silver City Raiders_, _Rustlers of Silver City_, _Silver City Rustlers_--\"  The great cowboy lifted the newsboy into the _Honeychile_ truck.         *       *       *       *       *  Pink and rose clouds drifted through a brightening sky as the _Honeychile Bakery_ truck careened along a narrow road badly in need of rock and grading. From the road, the truck rattled into a rutted track through dewy woods and skidded swaying to a stop at the side of a long, low, grassy hill.  The tall creature dressed in black, red-spotted fur stepped from the cab. An opening appeared in the hillside. Four machines--dull metal eggs balancing on single tractor treads--rolled silently through the opening. Jointed steel arms darted from recesses in the eggs. One machine opened the truck doors.  The creature walked up a ramp inside the hill and entered a shimmering metallic compartment.  \"Greetings, Eo. I have returned.\"  Eo, who wore a suit of white fur, hummed, \"None too soon, Za. We miscalculated dawn. What success?\"  \"An excellent group,\" Za said. He stretched and reclined on a transparent slab. \"The servants are unloading the vehicle. I captured a young male, a mature male, an aged male, some sort of official or guardian male, a mature female, and an aged female.\"  \"Let's view them,\" Eo said. \"You can rest after we're away.\"  The tall creatures entered a second compartment furnished with a large table upon which the silent machines deposited inanimate bodies. \"Extraordinary!\" said Eo, staring at Miss Betsy Tapp. \"These things have reached a peak of mammalian development!\"  \"Her correct garments are in this bundle,\" Za explained. \"The servants are bringing the properties now. I secured a signaling device and a box used in an extremely primitive system of communication. Also, I brought the quaint muscle-powered vehicle ridden by the young male. The photographs should be sufficient for other details.\"  \"Any difficulty?\" Eo asked as the machines dumped Patrolman Whedbee on the table.  \"The language was the greatest obstacle,\" Za said. \"The same word has many different meanings, or many different words have the same meaning. Rather crude.\"  \"Did you use bait, or force?\"  \"Bait,\" Za said. \"It's much simpler. This is a completely selfish, egocentric breed. Most of them have one thing in mind which they want solely for themselves. Their sending power is weak, but that one selfish desire is powerful enough to be received. I merely dangled it before their minds, and they were hooked.\" He tapped the foot of Calvin C. Kear. \"I killed this one's female companion. She awoke and screamed. The males and females pair off and live together for years. Strange custom! Breeding seems to be only one reason for the mutual bondage.\"  Za pointed to Mrs. Jane Huprich. \"The old female may be an exception to the selfishness. I couldn't decide whether she most wanted to be relieved of cleaning floors by primitive methods, or wanted her male offspring to be released from some structure where he had been secured for reasons I couldn't determine.\"  The machines deposited the Reverend Enos Shackelford and then lined up in a precise row. \"This thing is dead!\" Eo buzzed.  Za shook his head. \"That was the only genuine exception. He confused me till I forgot his proper clothing, but some can be devised from the other samples. He seems to have been a witch-doctor. His mind was cluttered with myths and superstitions from an ancient text. I don't understand him, Eo, and wish I had time to study the phenomena. He was different from the others. He believed in something and considered himself lowly and humble. The minds of the others were in constant confusion. They believed, actually, in nothing. Somehow, he saw me, Eo. I was forced to kill him.\"  \"No harm done,\" Eo decided. He faced the machines and said, \"Destroy the vehicle, draw in the camouflage net, prepare for take-off.\" The machines rolled from the compartment, and the two creatures followed.  \"Seal it,\" Eo said. \"I'll plasticize them when we're in space. Fine work, Za. I can see the plaque now: 'Mounted by Eo, Collected by Za. Typical Street Corner on Planet _Earth_, Star _Sol_.' The directors will surely give the group a prominent place in the Galactic Museum of Natural History!\"  \"Yes,\" Za agreed, glancing back at the Reverend Enos Shackelford. \"This planet was a fortunate stopover.\"   _The End_     Transcriber's Note:      This etext was produced from _Imagination Stories of Science and     Fantasy_ August 1953.
