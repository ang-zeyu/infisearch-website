The space ship, as the rushing, reddish ground beneath indicated, continued to glide forward as though pulled by an invisible rope. He turned on full power. The ship's progress was checked a little. A very little! And the metallic red surface under them grew nearer as they steadily lost altitude.  \"Something seems to have got us by the nose,\" said Dex. \"We're on our way to the center of the red spot, I guess--to find whatever it was that Journeyman found. And the radio communication his been broken somehow....\"  Wordlessly, they stared out the panel, while the shell, quivering with the strain of the atomic motor's fight against whatever unseen force it was that relentlessly drew them forward, bore them swiftly toward the heart of the vast crimson area.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Look!\" cried Brand.  For over an hour the ship had been propelled swiftly, irresistibly toward the center of the red spot. It had been up about forty thousand feet. Now, with a jerk that sent both men reeling, it had been drawn down to within fifteen thousand feet of the surface; and the sight that was now becoming more and more visible was incredible.  Beneath was a vast, orderly checkerboard. Every alternate square was covered by what seemed a jointless metal plate. The open squares, plainly land under cultivation, were surrounded by gleaming fences that hooked each metal square with every other one of its kind as batteries are wired in series. Over these open squares progressed tiny, two legged figures, for the most part following gigantic shapeless animals like figures out of a dream. Ahead suddenly appeared the spires and towers of an enormous city!  Metropolis and cultivated land! It was as unbelievable, on that raw new planet, as such a sight would have been could a traveler in time have observed it in the midst of a dim Pleistocene panorama of young Earth.  It was instantly apparent that the city was their destination. Rapidly the little ship was rushed toward it; and, realizing at last the futility of its laboring, Brand cut off the atomic motor and let the shell drift.  Over a group of squat square buildings their ship passed, decreasing speed and drifting lower with every moment. The lofty structures that were the nucleus of the strange city loomed closer. Now they were soaring slowly down a wide thoroughfare; and now, at last, they hovered above a great open square that was thronged with figures.  Lower they dropped. Lower. And then they settled with a slight jar on a surface made of reddish metal; and the figures rushed to surround them.         *       *       *       *       *  Looking out the glass panel at these figures, both Brand and Dex exclaimed aloud and covered their eyes for a moment to shut out the hideous sight of them. Now they examined them closely.  Manlike they were: and yet like no human being conceivable to an Earth mind. They were tremendously tall--twelve feet at least--but as thin as so many animated poles. Their two legs were scarce four inches through, taper-less, boneless, like lengths of pipe; and like two flexible pipes they were joined to a slightly larger pipe of a torso that could not have been more than a foot in diameter. There were four arms, a pair on each side of the cylindrical body, that weaved feebly about like lengths of rubber hose.  Set directly on the pipe-like body, as a pumpkin might be balanced on a pole, was a perfectly round cranium in which were glassy, staring eyes, with dull pupils like those of a sick dog. The nose was but a tab of flesh. The mouth was a minute, circular thing, soft and flabby looking, which opened and shut regularly with the creature's breathing. It resembled the snout-like mouth of a fish, of the sucker variety; and fish-like, too, was the smooth and slimy skin that covered the beanpole body.         *       *       *       *       *  Hundreds of the repulsive things, there were. And all of them shoved and crowded, as a disorderly mob on Earth might do, to get close to the Earthmen's ship. Their big dull eyes peered in through the glass panels, and their hands--mere round blobs of gristle in the palms of which were set single sucker disks--pattered against the metal hull of the shell.  \"God!\" said Brand with a shudder. \"Fancy these things feeling over your body....\"  \"They're hostile, whatever they are,\" said Dex. \"Look out: that one's pointing something at you!\"  One of the slender, tottering creatures had raised an arm and leveled at Brand something that looked rather like an elongated, old-fashioned flashlight. Brand involuntarily ducked. The clear glass panel between them and the mob outside gave him a queasy feeling of being exposed to whatever missile might lurk in the thing's tube.  \"What do we do now?\" demanded Dex with a shaky laugh. \"You're chief of this expedition. I'm waiting for orders.\"  \"We wait right here,\" replied Brand. \"We're safe in the shell till we're starved out. At least they can't get in to attack us.\"  But it developed that, while the slimy looking things might not be able to get in, they had ways of reaching the Earthmen just the same!         *       *       *       *       *  The creature with the gun-like tube extended it somewhat further toward Brand.  Brand felt a sharp, unpleasant tingle shoot through his body, as though he had received an electric shock. He winced, and cried out at the sudden pain of it.  \"What's the matter--\" Dex began. But hardly had the words left his mouth when he, too, felt the shock. A couple of good, hearty Earth oaths exploded from his lips.  The repulsive creature outside made an authoritative gesture. He seemed to be beckoning to them, his huge dull eyes glaring threateningly at the same moment.  \"Our beanpole friend is suggesting that we get out of the shell and stay awhile,\" said Dex with grim humor. \"They seem anxious to entertain us--_ouch!_\"  As the two men made no move to obey the beckoning gesture, the creature had raised the tube again; and again the sharp, unpleasant shock shot through them.  \"What the devil are we going to do?\" exclaimed Brand. \"If we go out in that mob of nightmare things--it's going to be messy. As long as we stay in the shell we have some measure of protection.\"  \"Not much protection when they can sting us through metal and glass at will,\" growled Dex. \"Do you suppose they can turn the juice on harder? Or is that bee-sting their best effort?\"  As though in direct answer to his words, the blob-like face of the being who seemed in authority convulsed with anger and he raised the tube again. This time the shock that came from it was sufficient to throw the two men to the floor.  \"Well, we can't stay in the ship, that's certain,\" said Brand. \"I guess there's only one thing to do.\"  Dex nodded. \"Climb out of here and take as many of these skinny horrors with us into hell as we can,\" he agreed.  Once more the shock stung them, as a reminder not to keep their captors waiting. With their shoulders bunched for abrupt action, and their guns in hand, the two men walked to the trap-door of the ship. They threw the heavy bolts, drew a deep breath--and flung open the door to charge unexpectedly toward the thickest mass of creatures that surrounded the ship!         *       *       *       *       *  In a measure their charge was successful. Its very suddenness caught some of the tall monstrosities off guard. Half a dozen of them stopped the fragile glass bullets to writhe in horrible death on the red metal paving of the square. But that didn't last long.  In less than a minute, thin, clammy arms were winding around the Earthmen's wrists, and their guns were wrenched from them. And then started a hand-to-hand encounter that was all the more hideous for being so unlike any fighting that might have occurred on Earth.  With a furious growl Dex charged the nearest creature, whose huge round head swayed on its stalk of a body fully six feet above his own head. He gathered the long thin legs in a football grip, and sent the thing crashing full length on its back. The great head thumped resoundingly against the metal paving, and the creature lay motionless.  For an instant Dex could only stare at the thing. It had been so easy, like overcoming a child. But even as that thought crossed his mind, two of the tall thin figures closed in behind him. Four pairs of arms wound around him, feebly but tenaciously, like wet seaweed.  They began to constrict and wind tighter around him. He tore at them, dislodged all but two. His sturdy Earth leg went back to sweep the stalk-like legs of his attackers from under them. One of the things went down, to twist weakly in a laborious attempt to rise again. But the other, by sheer force of height and reach, began to bear Dex down.  Savagely he laced out with his fists, battering the pulpy face that was pressing down close to his. The big eyes blinked shut, but the four hose-like arms did not relax their clasp. Dex's hands sought fiercely for the thing's throat. But it had no throat: the head, set directly on the thin shoulders, defied all throttling attempts.         *       *       *       *       *  Then, just as Dex was feeling that the end had come, he felt the creature wrench from him, and saw it slide in a tangle of arms and legs over the smooth metal pavement. He got shakily to his feet, to see Brand standing over him and flailing out with his fists at an ever tightening circle of towering figures.  \"Thanks,\" panted Dex. And he began again, tripping the twelve-foot things in order to get them down within reach, battering at the great pulpy heads, fighting blindly in that expressed craving to take as many of the creatures into hell with him as he could manage. Beside him fought Brand, steadily, coolly, grim of jaw and unblinking of eye.

On the Continent it has, however, been the subject of considerable research, and in Italy, Germany, and France books have been published which either include it as part of the larger subject of furniture, or treat in considerable detail instances of specially-important undertakings. From these various sources I have endeavoured to gather as much information as possible without too wearying an insistence upon unimportant details, and now present the results of my selection for the consideration of that part of the public which is interested in the handicrafts which merge into art, and especially for the designer and craftsman, whose business it is or may be to produce such works in harmonious co-operation in the present day, as they often did in days gone by, and, it may be hoped, with a success akin to that attained in those periods to which we look back as the golden age of art.  The books from which I have drawn my information are principally the following:--  In Italian--Borghese and Banchi's \"Nuovi documenti per la storia dell' Arte Senese\"; Brandolese's \"Pitture, sculture, &c., di Padova\"; Caffi's \"Dei lavori d'intaglio in legname e d'intarsia nel Cattedrale di Ferrara\"; Calvi's \"Dei professori de belle arti che fiorirono in Milano ai tempi dei Visconti, &c.\"; Saba Castiglione's \"Ricordi\"; Erculei's paper in his \"Catalogue of the Exhibition of works of carving and inlay held at Rome in 1885\"; Finocchietti's \"Report on carving and inlaid work in the Jurors' report on the Exhibition of 1867 in Paris\"; Lanzi's \"History of Painting in Italy\"; Locatelli's \"Iconografia Italiana\"; Marchese's \"Lives of Dominican Artists\"; Milanesi's \"Documenti per la Storia dell' Arte Senese\"; Morelli's \"Notizie d'opere di disegno nella prima metà dell' Secolo XVI.\"; Tassi's \"Vite di pittori, architetti, &c., Bergamaschi\"; Temanza's \"Vite dei piu celebri architetti, &c., Dominicani\"; Tiraboschi's \"Biblioteca Modenese\"; Della Valle's \"Lettere Senesi sopra le belle Arti\"; Vasari's \"Lives,\" with Milanesi's notes and corrections, and papers in the \"Bullettino di Arti, Industrie e Curiosità Veneziane,\" the \"Atti e memorie della Società Savonese,\" the \"Archivio Storico dell' Arte and its continuation as L'Arte,\" and the \"Archivio Storico Lombardo,\" by such men as Michele Caffi, G.

My thanks are due to the officials of the British Museum Library and of the Art Library at the Victoria and Albert Museum for the great assistance which they have given me in many ways, the facilities afforded me, and their unfailing kindness and courtesy; and to the Director of the Victoria and Albert Museum for similar kindness and assistance.  I have also to thank my friend Mr. C. Bessant, whose experience in all kinds of cabinet work is so great, for very kindly looking over the section dealing with the processes of manufacture.    F. HAMILTON JACKSON.     INTARSIA AND MARQUETRY  HISTORICAL NOTES--ANTIQUITY   The word \"intarsia\" is derived from the Latin \"interserere,\" to insert, according to the best Italian authorities, though Scherer says there was a similar word, \"Tausia,\" which was applied to the inlaying of gold and silver in some other metal, an art practised in Damascus, and thence called damascening; and that at first the two words meant the same thing, but after a time one was applied to work in wood and the other to metal work. In the \"Museo Borbonico,\" xii., p. 4, xv., p. 6, the word \"Tausia\" is said to be of Arabic origin, and there is no doubt that the art is Oriental. It perhaps reached Europe either by way of Sicily or through the Spanish Moors. \"Marquetry,\" on the other hand, is a word of much later origin, and comes from the French \"marqueter,\" to spot, to mark; it seems, therefore, accurate to apply the former term to those inlays of wood in which a space is first sunk in the solid to be afterwards filled with a piece of wood (or sometimes some other material) cut to fit it, and to use the latter for the more modern practice of cutting several sheets of differently-coloured thin wood placed together to the same design, so that by one cutting eight or ten copies of different colours may be produced which will fit into each other, and only require subsequent arranging and glueing, as well as for the more artistic effects of the marquetry of the 17th and 18th centuries, which were produced with similar veneers. The process of inlaying is of the most remote antiquity, and the student may see in the cases of the British Museum, at the Louvre, and in other museums, examples of both Assyrian and Egyptian inlaid patterns of metal and ivory, or ebony or vitreous pastes, upon both wood and ivory, dating from the 8th and 10th centuries before the Christian Era, or earlier. The Greeks and Romans also made use of it for costly furniture and ornamental sculpture; in Book 23 of the \"Odyssey,\" Ulysses, describing to Penelope the bride-bed which he had made, says--\"Beginning from this head-post, I wrought at the bedstead till I had finished it, and made it fair with inlaid work of gold, and of silver, and of ivory\"; the statue and throne of Jupiter at Olympia had ivory, ebony, and many other materials used in its construction, and the chests in which clothes were kept, mentioned by Homer, were some of them ornamented with inlaid work in the precious metals and ivory. Pausanias describes the box of Kypselos, in the opisthodomos of the Temple of Hera, at Olympia, as elliptical in shape, made of cedar wood and adorned with mythological representations, partly carved in wood and partly inlaid with gold and ivory, in five strips which encircled the whole box, one above another. The Greek words for inlaying used by Homer and Pindar are \"[Greek: daidallô]\" and \"[Greek: kollaô],\" and their derivatives, the first being also used for embroidering; Homer and Hesiod also use \"[Greek: poikilos]\" for \"inlaid,\" which shows how closely at that time the arts were interwoven. These words have left no trace in the later terms, though [Greek: kollaô] means to fix together, or to glue, and it is tempting to connect the French word \"coller\" with it. Vitruvius and Pliny use the words \"cerostrata\" or \"celostrata,\" which means, strictly speaking, \"inlaid with horn,\" and \"xilostraton.\" The woods used by the Greeks were ebony, cypress, cedar, oak, \"sinila,\" yew, willow, lotus (celtis australis), and citron (thuyia cypressoides), a tree which grew on the slopes of the Atlas mountains. The value of large slabs of this last was enormous. Pliny says that Cicero, who was not very wealthy according to Roman notions, spent 500,000 sesterces (about £5400) for one table. Asinius Pollio spent £10,800, King Juba £13,050, and the family of the Cethegi £15,150 for a single slab. The value of this wood consisted chiefly in the beautiful lines of the veins and fibres; when they ran in wavy lines they were called \"tigrinæ,\" tiger tables; when they formed spirals like so many little whirlpools they were called \"pantherinæ,\" or panther tables, and when they had undulating, wavy marks like the filaments of a feather, especially if resembling the eyes on a peacock's tail, they were very highly esteemed. Next in value were those covered with dense masses of grain, "]]]
