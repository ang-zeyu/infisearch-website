Both of the second upper premolars (P3) are lacking, although the mandibular dentition is normal. This condition has been reported previously for this species by Frum (1946:176) in specimens from West Virginia.   ~Myotis subulatus subulatus~ (Say)  Small-footed Myotis       _Vespertilio subulatus_ Say, Long's Exped. to Rocky Mts.,      2:65 (footnote), 1823, type from the Arkansas River near La      Junta, Otero Co., Colorado.       _Myotis subulatus_, Warren, The Mammals of Colorado, G. P.      Putnam's Sons, New York, 1910. p. 275.       _Distribution in Nebraska._--Northern and western Nebraska.       _Records of occurrence._--Specimens examined, 9, as follows:      CHERRY CO.: Valentine, 1 (Univ. Nebr. Dept. Zool.). SHERIDAN      CO.: Rushville, 1; 15 mi. N Rushville, 2. SIOUX CO.: Agate,      1 (Univ. Kansas Mus. Nat. Hist.); Monroe Canyon, 5-1/2 mi.      N, 2-1/2 mi. W Harrison, 2 (Nebr. Game, Forestation and      Parks Comm.); Warbonnet Canyon, 2 (Univ. Nebr. State Mus.).       Additional records: DAKOTA CO.: Crystal Lake, 1 (Stephens,      1945:92). DAWES CO.: Chadron, 1 (Miller and Allen,      1928:169). SIOUX CO.: Antelope Township, 1 (Quay, 1948:181);      Sugarloaf Township, 1 (Quay, 1948:181).  _Remarks._--This bat is common along the Niobrara River in the northwestern part of the state. Stephens (_loc. cit._) reports taking a bat of this species in Dakota County in the northeastern corner of Nebraska. This specimen was sent to Swenk at the University of Nebraska for positive identification and was, according to Stephens, deposited in the Swenk collection. No trace of the specimen can be found at the present time. It is here assigned to _M. s. subulatus_.  _M. s. subulatus_ has been observed frequently in the Pine Ridge area, generally in association with _Eptesicus fuscus pallidus_. Two specimens were shot by us from many that were seen flying over a small clearing in the pines in northern Sioux County on August 2, 1949. Several _Eptesicus_ were also obtained there. One of us (Webb) took two of these bats from their daytime retreat in a barn north of Rushville, Sheridan County, on September 5, 1951, where _Eptesicus_ was also found. They are known to inhabit hay barns at the Ft. Niobrara Game Reserve, Cherry County, also in association with _Eptesicus_. Swenk (1908:137) reports finding two of these bats under a loose strip of pine bark in Sioux County.   ~Myotis volans interior~ Miller  Hairy-winged Myotis       _Myotis longricus interior_ Miller, Proc. Biol. Soc.      Washington, 27:211, October 31, 1914, type from Twining,      Taos Co., New Mexico.       _Myotis volans interior_, Miller and Allen, Bull. U. S. Nat.      Mus., 144:142, May 25, 1928.       _Distribution in Nebraska._--Badlands area of extreme      northwestern part of state.       _Records of occurrence._--Specimens examined, 2, as follows:      SIOUX CO.: Warbonnet Township, 8 mi. N Harrison, 2      (Cleveland Mus. Nat. Hist.).  _Remarks._--Quay (1948:181) reported finding a colony of approximately 180 of these bats in northern Sioux County in the summer of 1944. They were found in a crevice in a dry creek bed. He examined several dozen, all females, two of which were saved as specimens.  The authors, while engaged in field work in this approximate locality in the summers of 1948 and 1949, were unable to locate any of these bats.   ~Lasionycteris noctivagans~ (Le Conte)  Silver-haired Bat       _V[espertilio], noctivagans_ Le Conte, McMurtrie's Cuvier,      Animal Kingdom, 1:431, June, 1831, type from eastern United      States.       _Lasionycteris noctivagans_, Peters, Monatsber. k. preuss.

Paris, 1:17, 1832, type from eastern United States,      probably Georgia.       _Pipistrellus subflavus_, Miller, N. Amer. Fauna, 13:90,      October 16, 1897.       _Distribution in Nebraska._--Known from limestone quarries      in Cass and Sarpy counties; probably ranging throughout      eastern Nebraska.       _Records of occurrence._--Specimens examined, 34, as      follows: CASS CO.: 1 mi. NE Louisville, 4. SARPY CO.: 1/2      mi. W Meadow, 30 (some of these specimens have been      deposited in other collections as follows: Private      Collection of P. H. Krutzsch, 3; Private Collection of W. G.      Frum, 2; Univ. Kansas Mus. Nat. Hist., 4; Univ. Nebr. State      Mus., 4).  _Remarks._--This bat is the most common of the four species that are known to inhabit the quarries in Cass and Sarpy counties. Individuals have been found both in drill holes and clinging to the walls of the quarries. We have always found this bat to be solitary while in hibernation.   ~Eptesicus fuscus fuscus~ (Beauvois)  Big Brown Bat       _Vespertilio fuscus_ Beauvois, Catal. Raisonné Mus. Peale,      Philadelphia, p. 18, 1796, type from Philadelphia,      Philadelphia Co., Pennsylvania.       _Eptesicus fuscus_, Méhely, Magyarország denevéreinek      monographiája (Monographia Chiropterorum Hungariae), pp.      206, 338, 1900.       _Distribution in Nebraska._--Eastern part of state.       _Records of occurrence._--Specimens examined, 23, as      follows: ADAMS CO.: Hastings, 1 (Hastings Museum, Hastings,      Nebraska). CASS CO.: 1 mi. NE Louisville, 6; Plattsmouth, 1      (Univ. Nebr. State Mus.). SARPY CO.: 1/2 mi. W Meadow, 15      (Univ. Nebr. State Mus., 7).  _Remarks._--We have observed this bat hibernating in the limestone quarries of Cass and Sarpy counties, where it was commonly found in drill holes or clinging to the ceiling or walls. We have always found this bat to be solitary while in hibernation, with one exception. On January 31, 1949, a male and female were found in the same drill hole in the Cass County quarry. The jolt of being knocked from the hole separated the two bats, and upon examination the penis of the male was noted to be extended and erected, indicating that the pair might have been in the act of copulation.   ~Eptesicus fuscus pallidus~ Young  Big Brown Bat       _Eptesicus pallidus_ Young, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci.      Philadelphia, p. 408, October 2, 1908, type from Boulder,      Boulder Co., Colorado.       _Eptesicus fuscus pallidus_, Miller, Bull. U. S. Nat.

Niobrara Game Reserve, 19 (Nebr.      Game, Forestation and Parks Comm., 17); Valentine, 2 (Univ.      Nebr. Dept. Zool.). DAWES CO.: 10 mi. S Chadron, 1 (Univ.      Mich. Mus. Zool.).

Game, Forestation and Parks Comm.); Warbonnet Canyon,      7 (Univ. Nebr. State Mus.).  _Remarks._--A colony of approximately 100 of these bats was discovered in the unused portion of a barn loft at Ft. Niobrara Game Reserve on August 11, 1948. Although no temperature readings were taken, it was estimated that the temperature was more than 100° F. in the loft. The bats were congregated on rafters at the north end of the barn and when disturbed, only a few members of the colony dropped from the rafters to fly. Most of the bats crawled to new retreats between the rafters and the corrugated iron roof of the building.   ~Lasiurus borealis borealis~ (Müller)  Red Bat       _Vespertilio borealis_ Müller, Natursyst.

U. S. Nat. Mus., 128:86,      April 29, 1924.       _Distribution in Nebraska._--Known only from Lincoln,      Lancaster County.       _Records of occurrence._--Specimen examined, 1, as follows:      LANCASTER CO.: Lincoln, 1 (Univ. Nebr. State Mus.).       Additional record (Zimmer, 1913:665): LANCASTER CO.:      Lincoln.  _Remarks._--The Mexican free-tailed bat is probably rare in Nebraska. The single specimen examined by us was obtained on June 27, 1931, from a downtown business building in Lincoln. According to the label on the specimen, it died in captivity on June 29 after giving birth to one young on June 28. The bat reported by Zimmer (_loc. cit._) was also taken in the business district of Lincoln. It was obtained on August 15, 1913.  In addition to the bats named above, six other kinds possibly occur in Nebraska. These, along with an indication of the part of the state in which each is to be looked for, are as follows:       _Myotis grisescens_ Howell, southeastern part of state.       _Myotis sodalis_ Miller and Allen, southeastern part of      state.       _Myotis thysanodes thysanodes_ Miller, northwestern part of      state.       _Nycticeus humeralis humeralis_ (Rafinesque), southeastern      part of state.       _Corynorhinus rafinesquii pallescens_ (Miller), northwestern      part of state.       _Tadarida molossa_ (Pallas), any part of state.
