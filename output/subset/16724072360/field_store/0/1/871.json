There were no lights in the windows, nor any sound in the houses; all the city of Gloucester was fast asleep under the snow.  And still Simpkin wanted his mice, and he mewed as he stood beside the four-post bed.  [Illustration]  But it is in the old story that all the beasts can talk, in the night between Christmas Eve and Christmas Day in the morning (though there are very few folk that can hear them, or know what it is that they say).  When the Cathedral clock struck twelve there was an answer--like an echo of the chimes--and Simpkin heard it, and came out of the tailor's door, and wandered about in the snow.  From all the roofs and gables and old wooden houses in Gloucester came a thousand merry voices singing the old Christmas rhymes--all the old songs that ever I heard of, and some that I don't know, like Whittington's bells.  [Illustration]  First and loudest the cocks cried out: \"Dame, get up, and bake your pies!\"  \"Oh, dilly, dilly, dilly!\" sighed Simpkin.  And now in a garret there were lights and sounds of dancing, and cats came from over the way.  \"Hey, diddle, diddle, the cat and the fiddle! All the cats in Gloucester--except me,\" said Simpkin.  Under the wooden eaves the starlings and sparrows sang of Christmas pies; the jack-daws woke up in the Cathedral tower; and although it was the middle of the night the throstles and robins sang; the air was quite full of little twittering tunes.  [Illustration]  But it was all rather provoking to poor hungry Simpkin!  Particularly he was vexed with some little shrill voices from behind a wooden lattice. I think that they were bats, because they always have very small voices--especially in a black frost, when they talk in their sleep, like the Tailor of Gloucester.  They said something mysterious that sounded like--      \"Buz, quoth the blue fly, hum, quoth the bee,      Buz and hum they cry, and so do we!\"  and Simpkin went away shaking his ears as if he had a bee in his bonnet.  [Illustration]  From the tailor's shop in Westgate came a glow of light; and when Simpkin crept up to peep in at the window it was full of candles. There was a snippeting of scissors, and snappeting of thread; and little mouse voices sang loudly and gaily--              \"Four-and-twenty tailors              Went to catch a snail,              The best man amongst them              Durst not touch her tail,              She put out her horns              Like a little kyloe cow,     Run, tailors, run! or she'll have you all e'en now!\"  Then without a pause the little mouse voices went on again--      \"Sieve my lady's oatmeal,      Grind my lady's flour,      Put it in a chestnut,      Let it stand an hour----\"  [Illustration]  \"Mew! Mew!\" interrupted Simpkin, and he scratched at the door. But the key was under the tailor's pillow, he could not get in.  The little mice only laughed, and tried another tune--      \"Three little mice sat down to spin,      Pussy passed by and she peeped in.      What are you at, my fine little men?      Making coats for gentlemen.      Shall I come in and cut off your threads?      Oh, no, Miss Pussy, you'd bite off our heads!\"  \"Mew! Mew!\" cried Simpkin. \"Hey diddle dinketty?\" answered the little mice--      \"Hey diddle dinketty, poppetty pet!      The merchants of London they wear scarlet;      Silk in the collar, and gold in the hem,      So merrily march the merchantmen!\"  [Illustration]  They clicked their thimbles to mark the time, but none of the songs pleased Simpkin; he sniffed and mewed at the door of the shop.      \"And then I bought      A pipkin and a popkin,      A slipkin and a slopkin,      All for one farthing----  and upon the kitchen dresser!\" added the rude little mice.  \"Mew! scratch! scratch!\" scuffled Simpkin on the window-sill; while the little mice inside sprang to their feet, and all began to shout at once in little twittering voices: \"No more twist! No more twist!\" And they barred up the window shutters and shut out Simpkin.  But still through the nicks in the shutters he could hear the click of thimbles, and little mouse voices singing--  [Illustration]  \"No more twist! No more twist!\"  Simpkin came away from the shop and went home, considering in his mind. He found the poor old tailor without fever, sleeping peacefully.  Then Simpkin went on tip-toe and took a little parcel of silk out of the tea-pot, and looked at it in the moonlight; and he felt quite ashamed of his badness compared with those good little mice!  When the tailor awoke in the morning, the first thing which he saw upon the patchwork quilt, was a skein of cherry-coloured twisted silk, and beside his bed stood the repentant Simpkin!  [Illustration]  \"Alack, I am worn to a ravelling,\" said the Tailor of Gloucester, \"but I have my twist!\"  The sun was shining on the snow when the tailor got up and dressed, and came out into the street with Simpkin running before him.  The starlings whistled on the chimney stacks, and the throstles and robins sang--but they sang their own little noises, not the words they had sung in the night.  \"Alack,\" said the tailor, \"I have my twist; but no more strength--nor time--than will serve to make me one single button-hole; for this is Christmas Day in the Morning! The Mayor of Gloucester shall be married by noon--and where is his cherry-coloured coat?\"  He unlocked the door of the little shop in Westgate Street, and Simpkin ran in, like a cat that expects something.  But there was no one there! Not even one little brown mouse!  The boards were swept clean; the little ends of thread and the little silk snippets were all tidied away, and gone from off the floor.  But upon the table--oh joy! the tailor gave a shout--there, where he had left plain cuttings of silk--there lay the most beautifullest coat and embroidered satin waistcoat that ever were worn by a Mayor of Gloucester.  [Illustration]  There were roses and pansies upon the facings of the coat; and the waistcoat was worked with poppies and corn-flowers.  [Illustration]  Everything was finished except just one single cherry-coloured button-hole, and where that button-hole was wanting there was pinned a scrap of paper with these words--in little teeny weeny writing--                NO MORE TWIST  And from then began the luck of the Tailor of Gloucester; he grew quite stout, and he grew quite rich.  He made the most wonderful waistcoats for all the rich merchants of Gloucester, and for all the fine gentlemen of the country round.  [Illustration]  Never were seen such ruffles, or such embroidered cuffs and lappets! But his button-holes were the greatest triumph of it all.  The stitches of those button-holes were so neat--_so_ neat--I wonder how they could be stitched by an old man in spectacles, with crooked old fingers, and a tailor's thimble.  The stitches of those button-holes were so small--_so_ small--they looked as if they had been made by little mice!"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1487"],["title","The Perfect Wagnerite: A Commentary on the Niblung's Ring (#1)"],["body"," and now fear nothing at all, here is my book for you; and--in all sincerity--much good may it do you!  London, 23rd. October 1907.     PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION  The preparation of a Second Edition of this booklet is quite the most unexpected literary task that has ever been set me. When it first appeared I was ungrateful enough to remonstrate with its publisher for printing, as I thought, more copies than the most sanguine Wagnerite could ever hope to sell. But the result proved that exactly one person buys a copy on every day in the year, including Sundays; and so, in the process of the suns, a reprint has become necessary.  Save a few verbal slips of no importance, I have found nothing to alter in this edition. As usual, the only protests the book has elicited are protests, not against the opinions it expresses, but against the facts it records. There are people who cannot bear to be told that their hero was associated with a famous Anarchist in a rebellion; that he was proclaimed as \"wanted\" by the police; that he wrote revolutionary pamphlets; and that his picture of Niblunghome under the reign of Alberic is a poetic vision of unregulated industrial capitalism as it was made known in Germany in the middle of the nineteenth century by Engels's Condition of the Laboring classes in England. They frantically deny these facts, and then declare that I have connected them with Wagner in a paroxysm of senseless perversity. I am sorry I have hurt them; and I appeal to charitable publishers to bring out a new life of Wagner, which shall describe him as a court musician of unquestioned fashion and orthodoxy, and a pillar of the most exclusive Dresden circles. Such a work, would, I believe, have a large sale, and be read with satisfaction and reassurance by many lovers of Wagner's music.  As to my much demurred-to relegation of Night Falls On The Gods to the category of grand opera, I have nothing to add or withdraw. Such a classification is to me as much a matter of fact as the Dresden rising or the police proclamation; but I shall not pretend that it is a matter of such fact as everybody's judgment can grapple with. People who prefer grand opera to serious music-drama naturally resent my placing a very grand opera below a very serious music-drama. The ordinary lover of Shakespeare would equally demur to my placing his popular catchpenny plays, of which As You Like It is an avowed type, below true Shakespearean plays like Measure for Measure. I cannot help that. Popular dramas and operas may have overwhelming merits as enchanting make-believes; but a poet's sincerest vision of the world must always take precedence of his prettiest fool's paradise.  As many English Wagnerites seem to be still under the impression that Wagner composed Rienzi in his youth, Tannhauser and Lohengrin in his middle age, and The Ring in his later years, may I again remind them that The Ring was the result of a political convulsion which occurred when Wagner was only thirty-six, and that the poem was completed when he was forty, with thirty more years of work before him? It is as much a first essay in political philosophy as Die Feen is a first essay in romantic opera. The attempt to recover its spirit twenty years later, when the music of Night Falls On The Gods was added, was an attempt to revive the barricades of Dresden in the Temple of the Grail. Only those who have never had any political enthusiasms to survive can believe that such an attempt could succeed. G. B. S.        London, 1901     Preface to the First Edition  This book is a commentary on The Ring of the Niblungs, Wagner's chief work. I offer it to those enthusiastic admirers of Wagner who are unable to follow his ideas, and do not in the least understand the dilemma of Wotan, though they are filled with indignation at the irreverence of the Philistines who frankly avow that they find the remarks of the god too often tedious and nonsensical. Now to be devoted to Wagner merely as a dog is devoted to his master, sharing a few elementary ideas, appetites and emotions with him, and, for the rest, reverencing his superiority without understanding it, is no true Wagnerism. Yet nothing better is possible without a stock of ideas common to master and disciple. Unfortunately, the ideas of the revolutionary Wagner of 1848 are taught neither by the education nor the experience of English and American gentlemen-amateurs, who are almost always political mugwumps, and hardly ever associate with revolutionists. The earlier attempts to translate his numerous pamphlets and essays into English, resulted in ludicrous mixtures of pure nonsense with the absurdest distorsions of his ideas into the ideas of the translators. We now have a translation which is a masterpiece of interpretation and an eminent addition to our literature; but that is not because its author, Mr. Ashton Ellis, knows the German dictionary better than his predecessors. He is simply in possession of Wagner's ideas, which were to them inconceivable.  All I pretend to do in this book is to impart the ideas which are most likely to be lacking in the conventional Englishman's equipment. I came by them myself much as Wagner did, having learnt more about music than about anything else in my youth, and sown my political wild oats subsequently in the revolutionary school. This combination is not common in England; and as I seem, so far, to be the only publicly articulate result of it, I venture to add my commentary to what has already been written by musicians who are no revolutionists, and revolutionists who are no musicians. G. B. S.          Preliminary Encouragements      The Ring of the Niblungs      The Rhine Gold      Wagner as Revolutionist      The Valkyries      Siegfried      Siegfried as Protestant      Night Falls On The Gods      Why He Changed His Mind      Wagner's Own Explanation      The Music of The Ring      The Old and the New Music      The Nineteenth Century      The Music of the Future      Bayreuth     THE PERFECT WAGNERITE     PRELIMINARY ENCOURAGEMENTS  A few of these will be welcome to the ordinary citizen visiting the theatre to satisfy his curiosity, or his desire to be in the fashion, by witnessing a representation of Richard Wagner's famous Ring of the Niblungs.  First, The Ring, with all its gods and giants and dwarfs, its water-maidens and Valkyries, its wishing-cap, magic ring, enchanted sword, and miraculous treasure, is a drama of today, and not of a remote and fabulous antiquity. It could not have been written before the second half of the nineteenth century, because it deals with events which were only then consummating themselves. Unless the spectator recognizes in it an image of the life he is himself fighting his way through, it must needs appear to him a monstrous development of the Christmas pantomimes, spun out here and there into intolerable lengths of dull conversation by the principal baritone. Fortunately, even from this point of view, The Ring is full of extraordinarily attractive episodes, both orchestral and dramatic. The nature music alone--music of river and rainbow, fire and forest--is enough to bribe people with any love of the country in them to endure the passages of political philosophy in the sure hope of a prettier page to come. Everybody, too, can enjoy the love music, the hammer and anvil music, the clumping of the giants, the tune of the young woodsman's horn, the trilling of the bird, the dragon music and nightmare music and thunder and lightning music, the profusion of simple melody, the sensuous charm of the orchestration: in short, the vast extent of common ground between The Ring and the ordinary music we use for play and pleasure. Hence it is that the four separate music-plays of which it is built have become popular throughout Europe as operas. We shall presently see that one of them, Night Falls On The Gods, actually is an opera.  It is generally understood, however, that there is an inner ring of superior persons to whom the whole work has a most urgent and searching philosophic and social significance. I profess to be such a superior person; and I write this pamphlet for the assistance of those who wish to be introduced to the work on equal terms with that inner circle of adepts.  My second encouragement is addressed to modest citizens who may suppose themselves to be disqualified from enjoying The Ring by their technical ignorance of music. They may dismiss all such misgivings speedily and confidently. If the sound of music has any power to move them, they will find that Wagner exacts nothing further. There is not a single bar of \"classical music\" in The Ring--not a note in it that has any other point than the single direct point of giving musical expression to the drama. In classical music there are, as the analytical programs tell us, first subjects and second subjects, free fantasias, recapitulations, and codas; there are fugues, with counter-subjects, strettos, and pedal points; there are passacaglias on ground basses, canons ad hypodiapente, and other ingenuities, which have, after all, stood or fallen by their prettiness as much as the simplest folk-tune. Wagner is never driving at anything of this sort any more than Shakespeare in his plays is driving at such ingenuities of verse-making as sonnets, triolets, and the like. And this is why he is so easy for the natural musician who has had no academic teaching. The professors, when Wagner's music is played to them, exclaim at once \"What is this? Is it aria, or recitative? Is there no cabaletta to it--not even a full close? Why was that discord not prepared; and why does he not resolve it correctly? How dare he indulge in those scandalous and illicit transitions into a key that has not one note in common with the key he has just left? Listen to those false relations! What does he want with six drums and eight horns when Mozart worked miracles with two of each? The man is no musician.\" The layman"]]]
