[Illustration]  [Illustration]  \"No,\" said Samuel Whiskers, \"make it properly, Anna Maria, with breadcrumbs.\"  [Illustration]  \"Nonsense! Butter and dough,\" replied Anna Maria.  [Illustration]  The two rats consulted together for a few minutes and then went away.  Samuel Whiskers got through a hole in the wainscot, and went boldly down the front staircase to the dairy to get the butter. He did not meet anybody.  He made a second journey for the rolling-pin. He pushed it in front of him with his paws, like a brewer's man trundling a barrel.  He could hear Ribby and Tabitha talking, but they were busy lighting the candle to look into the chest.  They did not see him.  [Illustration]  Anna Maria went down by way of the skirting-board and a window shutter to the kitchen to steal the dough.  [Illustration]  She borrowed a small saucer, and scooped up the dough with her paws.  She did not observe Moppet.  While Tom Kitten was left alone under the floor of the attic, he wriggled about and tried to mew for help.  But his mouth was full of soot and cobwebs, and he was tied up in such very tight knots, he could not make anybody hear him.  Except a spider, which came out of a crack in the ceiling and examined the knots critically, from a safe distance.  It was a judge of knots because it had a habit of tying up unfortunate blue-bottles. It did not offer to assist him.  Tom Kitten wriggled and squirmed until he was quite exhausted.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  Presently the rats came back and set to work to make him into a dumpling. First they smeared him with butter, and then they rolled him in the dough.  \"Will not the string be very indigestible, Anna Maria?\" inquired Samuel Whiskers.  [Illustration]  Anna Maria said she thought that it was of no consequence; but she wished that Tom Kitten would hold his head still, as it disarranged the pastry. She laid hold of his ears.  [Illustration]  Tom Kitten bit and spat, and mewed and wriggled; and the rolling-pin went roly-poly, roly; roly, poly, roly. The rats each held an end.  \"His tail is sticking out! You did not fetch enough dough, Anna Maria.\"  \"I fetched as much as I could carry,\" replied Anna Maria.  \"I do not think\"--said Samuel Whiskers, pausing to take a look at Tom Kitten--\"I do _not_ think it will be a good pudding. It smells sooty.\"  Anna Maria was about to argue the point, when all at once there began to be other sounds up above--the rasping noise of a saw; and the noise of a little dog, scratching and yelping!  [Illustration]  The rats dropped the rolling-pin, and listened attentively.  \"We are discovered and interrupted, Anna Maria; let us collect our property--and other people's,--and depart at once.\"  \"I fear that we shall be obliged to leave this pudding.\"  [Illustration]  \"But I am persuaded that the knots would have proved indigestible, whatever you may urge to the contrary.\"  \"Come away at once and help me to tie up some mutton bones in a counterpane,\" said Anna Maria. \"I have got half a smoked ham hidden in the chimney.\"  [Illustration]  So it happened that by the time John Joiner had got the plank up--there was nobody under the floor except the rolling-pin and Tom Kitten in a very dirty dumpling!  [Illustration]  But there was a strong smell of rats; and John Joiner spent the rest of the morning sniffing and whining, and wagging his tail, and going round and round with his head in the hole like a gimlet.  [Illustration]  Then he nailed the plank down again and put his tools in his bag, and came downstairs.  The cat family had quite recovered. They invited him to stay to dinner.  The dumpling had been peeled off Tom Kitten, and made separately into a bag pudding, with currants in it to hide the smuts.  They had been obliged to put Tom Kitten into a hot bath to get the butter off.  John Joiner smelt the pudding; but he regretted that he had not time to stay to dinner, because he had just finished making a wheel-barrow for Miss Potter, and she had ordered two hen-coops.  And when I was going to the post late in the afternoon--I looked up the lane from the corner, and I saw Mr. Samuel Whiskers and his wife on the run, with big bundles on a little wheel-barrow, which looked very like mine.  They were just turning in at the gate to the barn of Farmer Potatoes.  Samuel Whiskers was puffing and out of breath. Anna Maria was still arguing in shrill tones.  She seemed to know her way, and she seemed to have a quantity of luggage.  I am sure _I_ never gave her leave to borrow my wheel-barrow!  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  They went into the barn, and hauled their parcels with a bit of string to the top of the hay mow.  [Illustration]  After that, there were no more rats for a long time at Tabitha Twitchit's.  [Illustration]  As for Farmer Potatoes, he has been driven nearly distracted. There are rats, and rats, and rats in his barn! They eat up the chicken food, and steal the oats and bran, and make holes in the meal bags.  And they are all descended from Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Whiskers--children and grand-children and great great grand-children.  There is no end to them!  Moppet and Mittens have grown up into very good rat-catchers.  They go out rat-catching in the village, and they find plenty of employment. They charge so much a dozen, and earn their living very comfortably.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  They hang up the rats' tails in a row on the barn door, to show how many they have caught--dozens and dozens of them.  [Illustration]  But Tom Kitten has always been afraid of a rat; he never durst face anything that is bigger than--  [Illustration]  A Mouse."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15577"],["title","A History of the McGuffey Readers (#1)"],["body","from the Bible; Croly's \"Conflagration of the Ampitheatre at Rome;\" \"How a Fly Walks on the Ceiling;\" \"The Child's Inquiry;\" \"How big was Alexander, Pa;\" Irving's \"Description of Pompey's Pillar;\" Woodworth's \"Old Oaken Bucket;\" Miss Gould's \"The Winter King;\" and Scott's \"Bonaparte Crossing the Alps,\" commencing \"'Is the route practicable?' said Bonaparte. 'It is barely possible to pass,' replied the engineer. 'Let us set forward, then,' said Napoleon.\" The rearing steed facing a precipitous slope in the picture gave emphasis to the words. There were also in this reader several pieces about Indians and bears, which indicate that Dr. McGuffey never forgot the stories told at the fireside by his father of his adventures as an Indian scout and hunter.  In the Fourth Reader there were seventeen selections from the Bible; William Wirt's \"Description of the Blind Preacher;\" Phillip's \"Character of Napoleon Bonaparte;\" Bacon's \"Essay on Studies;\" Nott's \"Speech on the Death of Alexander Hamilton;\" Addison's \"Westminster Abbey;\" Irving's \"Alhambra;\" Rogers's \"Genevra;\" Willis's \"Parrhasius;\" Montgomery's \"Make Way for Liberty;\" two extracts from Milton and two from Shakespeare, and no less than fourteen selections from the writings of the men and women who lectured before the College of Teachers in Cincinnati. The story of the widow of the Pine Cottage sharing her last smoked herring with a strange traveler who revealed himself as her long-lost son, returning rich from the Indies, was anonymous, but it will be remembered by those who read it.  These selections were the most noteworthy ones in the first editions of these readers.  The First and Second Readers of the McGuffey Series were substantially made new at each revision. A comparison of the original Third Reader with an edition copyrighted in 1847, shows that the latter book was increased about one-third in size. Of the sixty-six selections in the early edition only forty-seven were retained, while thirty new ones were inserted. Among the latter were \"Harry and his Dog Frisk\" that brought to him, punished by being sent to bed, a Windsor pear; \"Perseverance,\" a tale of kite-flying followed by the poem, \"Try, try again;\" the \"Little Philosopher,\" named Peter Hurdle, who caught Mr. Lenox's runaway horse and on examination seemed to lack nothing but an Eclectic spelling book, a reader and a Testament--which were promised him; \"The Colonists,\" in which men of various callings offered their services, and while even the dancing master was accepted as of some possible use, the gentleman was scornfully rejected; \"Things by Their Right Names,\" in which a battle was described as wholesale murder; \"Little Victories,\" in which Hugh's mother consoled him for the loss of a leg by telling him of the lives of men who became celebrated under even greater adversities; \"The Wonderful Instrument,\" which turned out to be the eye; \"Metaphysics,\" a ludicrous description of a colonial salt-box in affected terms of exactness designed to ridicule some forms of reasoning. Those who used this edition of the third reader will surely remember some of these selections.  [The Bible]  In the Fourth Reader printed in 1844 there were thirty new selections--less than one-third of the book; but some of these were such as will be remembered by those who read them in school. There was \"Respect for the Sabbath Rewarded,\" in which a barber of Bath had become so poor because he would not shave his customers on Sunday, that he borrowed a half-penny to buy a candle Saturday night to give light for a late customer, and was thus discovered to be the long-lost William Reed of Taunton, heir to many thousand pounds; \"The Just Judge,\" who disguised himself as a miller and, obtaining a place on the jury, received only five guineas as a bribe when the others got ten, and who revealed himself as Lord Chief Justice Hale and tried the case over in his miller's clothing; Hawthorne's \"The Town Pump;\" Mrs. Southey's \"April Day.\"    \"All day the low-hung clouds have dropped     Their garnered fullness down.   All day a soft gray mist hath wrapped     Hill, valley, grove and town.\"   Bryant's \"Death of the Flowers;\" Campbell's \"Lochiel's Warning;\" and the trial scene from Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice. All these became favorite reading exercises in later years.  As late as 1840 the Bible was read daily in all the schools of the West. Although sectarian or denominational teaching was not permitted, religious instruction was desired by the great majority of school patrons.  Even up to the opening of the Civil War, whatever the faith or the practice of the adult inhabitants of the country, the Bible story and the Bible diction were familiar to all. The speeches of the popular orators of that day were filled with distinct allusions to the Bible and these were quickly and clearly apprehended by the people. It may be questioned whether popular speeches of the present day would have equal force if based on the assumption that everybody knows the Biblical stories. Indeed it is a common remark made by professors of English in the higher institutions of learning that pupils know little of the Bible as a distinctly formative and conservative element in English literature. In the texts authorized for the study of English classics, Biblical allusions are very common. These have little meaning to pupils who have not read the Bible, unless the passage is pointed out and hunted up.  [Dr. Swing's Opinion]  From the pages of these readers the pupils learned to master the printed word and obtain the thought of the authors. Without conscious effort they received moral instruction and incentives toward right living. Without intent they treasured in their memories such extracts from the authors of the best English Literature as gave them a desire to read more.  [Books as Teachers]  In one of his sermons Dr. David Swing of Chicago said: \"Much as you may have studied the languages or the sciences, that which most affected you was the moral lessons in the series of McGuffey. And yet the reading class was filed out only once a day to read for a few moments, and then we were all sent to our seats to spend two hours in learning how to bound New Hampshire or Connecticut, or how long it would take a greyhound to overtake a fox or a hare if the spring of each was so and so, and the poor fugitive had such and such a start. That was perhaps well, but we have forgotten how to bound Connecticut, and how to solve the equation of the field and thicket; but up out of the far-off years come all the blessed lessons in virtue and righteousness which those reading books taught; and when we now remember, how even these moral memories have faded I cannot but wish the teachers had made us bound the States less, and solve fewer puzzles in 'position' and the 'cube root' and made us commit to memory the whole series of the McGuffey Eclectic Readers. The memory that comes from these far-away pages is full of the best wisdom of time or the timeless land. In these books we were indeed led by a schoolmaster, from beautiful maxims for children up to the best thoughts of a long line of sages, and poets, and naturalists. There we all first learned the awful weakness of the duel that took away a Hamilton; there we saw the grandeur of the Blind Preacher of William Wirt; there we saw the emptiness of the ambition of Alexander, and there we heard even the infidel say, 'Socrates died like a philosopher, but Jesus Christ like a God.'\"  This public recognition of the influence of these readers upon the mind and character of this great preacher is again noted in Rev. Joseph Fort Newton's biography of David Swing in which the books which influenced that life are named as \"The Bible, Calvin's Institutes, Fox's Book of Martyrs and the McGuffey Readers;\" and the author quotes David Swing as saying that \"The Institutes were rather large reading for a boy, but to the end of his life he held that McGuffey's Sixth Reader was a great book. For Swing, as for many a boy in the older West, its varied and wise selections from the best English authors were the very gates of literature ajar.\"  One of the most eminent political leaders of the present day attributes his power in the use of English largely to the study of McGuffey's Sixth Reader in the common schools of Ohio.  [How a Japanese Learned English]  At a dinner lately given in New York to Marquis Ito of Japan, the marquis responded to the toast of his health returning thanks in English. He then continued his remarks in Japanese for some eight minutes. At its close Mr. Tsudjuki, who was then the minister of Education in Japan, traveling with Marquis Ito as his friend and companion, and who had taken shorthand notes of the Japanese speech, rose and translated the speech readily and fluently into good English. One of the guests asked how he had learned to speak English so correctly. He replied that he had done so in the public schools of Japan and added, \"I learned my English from McGuffey's Readers, with which you are no doubt familiar.\"  [The Authorship]  It is not unusual to see in the literary columns of a daily newspaper inquiries as to where certain poems may be found of which a single stanza is faintly recalled. Many of these prove to be fragments of pieces that are found in the McGuffey Readers. Quite lately Theodore Roosevelt made the public statement that he did not propose to become a \"Meddlesome Matty.\" This allusion was perfectly clear to the millions of people who used the McGuffey Readers at any time after 1853.  When the Fourth Reader was issued in 1837 it contained a preface of three closely printed pages setting forth and defending the plan of McGuffey's books. In this he said: \"In conclusion, the author begs leave to state, that the whole series of Eclectic Readers is his own. In the preparation of the rules, etc., for the present volume he has had the assistance of a very distinguished Teacher, whose judgment"]]]
