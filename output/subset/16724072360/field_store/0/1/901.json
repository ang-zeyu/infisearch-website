CHAPTER I. LOOMINGS   Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen, and regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people’s hats off—then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.  There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs—commerce surrounds it with her surf. Right and left, the streets take you waterward. Its extreme down-town is the battery, where that noble mole is washed by waves, and cooled by breezes, which a few hours previous were out of sight of land. Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.  Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from Corlears Hook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall northward. What do you see?—Posted like silent sentinels all around the town, stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. Some leaning against the spiles; some seated upon the pier-heads; some looking over the bulwarks of ships from China; some high aloft in the rigging, as if striving to get a still better seaward peep. But these are all landsmen; of week days pent up in lath and plaster—tied to counters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks. How then is this? Are the green fields gone? What do they here?  But look! here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and seemingly bound for a dive. Strange! Nothing will content them but the extremest limit of the land; loitering under the shady lee of yonder warehouses will not suffice. No. They must get just as nigh the water as they possibly can without falling in. And there they stand—miles of them—leagues. Inlanders all, they come from lanes and alleys, streets and avenues,—north, east, south, and west. Yet here they all unite. Tell me, does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses of all those ships attract them thither?  Once more. Say, you are in the country; in some high land of lakes. Take almost any path you please, and ten to one it carries you down in a dale, and leaves you there by a pool in the stream. There is magic in it. Let the most absent-minded of men be plunged in his deepest reveries—stand that man on his legs, set his feet a-going, and he will infallibly lead you to water, if water there be in all that region. Should you ever be athirst in the great American desert, try this experiment, if your caravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysical professor. Yes, as every one knows, meditation and water are wedded for ever.  But here is an artist. He desires to paint you the dreamiest, shadiest, quietest, most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley of the Saco. What is the chief element he employs? There stand his trees, each with a hollow trunk, as if a hermit and a crucifix were within; and here sleeps his meadow, and there sleep his cattle; and up from yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke. Deep into distant woodlands winds a mazy way, reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in their hill-side blue. But though the picture lies thus tranced, and though this pine-tree shakes "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15002"],["title","All Aboard; or, Life on the Lake (#1)"],["body","of the club, in connection with the Butterfly, had been freely discussed for several weeks, and everything had been arranged for the opening of the \"summer campaign,\" as Charles Hardy rather facetiously called it.  \"There are two questions to be submitted for the action of the club at this meeting,\" continued Frank, with more than his usual gravity. \"They are questions of momentous consequence, and I have felt the need of counsel from our director; but my father declines giving me any advice, and says he prefers that we should discuss the questions independently; though, as you all know, if our final action is wrong, he will--he will--\"  \"Veto it,\" added Fred Harper.  \"Yes, he will not permit us to do a wrong, though he wants us to think for ourselves, and do the best we can.\"  \"Precisely so; he wants--\" Charles Hardy begun.  \"Order!\" said Frank, with gentle firmness. \"The first question is this: Tim Bunker, who has recently been discharged from the house of correction, has applied to be admitted as a member of the club, in place of Tony Weston, resigned. Shall he be admitted?\"  \"Mr. President, I move that he be not admitted,\" said Charles.  \"Is the motion seconded?\"  There was no response. The members all felt that it was a very delicate matter, and that it required careful deliberation.  \"The motion is not seconded, and, of course, cannot be entertained,\" continued the president.  \"I move that he be admitted,\" said Fred Harper.  \"Second the motion,\" added William Bright.  Charles Hardy felt a little nettled, and his first impulse was, to rise and express his astonishment, as Squire Flutter had done in the \"March meeting,\" at the motion of his friend on the other side of the table: but the impulsive youth had learned quite recently that a second thought is oftentimes much better than a first, and he reserved the expression of his surprise till a later stage of the debate.  As no one seemed disposed to open the discussion, Frank requested Fred Harper to take the chair, while he temporarily assumed the position of one of the disputants.  \"Mr. Chairman,\" said he, \"I rise to offer a few remarks in favor of the motion which is now before the club. Perhaps I cannot better introduce my own views upon the subject than by relating the substance of the conversation that occurred when Tim applied to me for admission to the club. He said that he had had a hard time of it in the house of correction; but he hoped his long confinement had done him good. He had firmly resolved to be a good boy. 'But,' said he, 'what can I do? If I go with the fellows I used to associate with, how can I keep my resolution? I know I have been a very bad boy, and I want to do what is right.' I told him that our rules were very strict; that no fellow was allowed to swear or to use bad language of any kind and that every member was required to keep straight himself, and help keep the others straight. He would agree to all this, would sign the constitution, and my father and the club would soon see that he meant all he said. I confess that I felt for him. What he said about keeping company with the 'Bunkers'--I suppose we must drop that name now--was true. He could not be a good fellow with such as they are. Now it won't do any harm to try him, and he may be saved from the error of his ways. As it is, he has got a hard name, and people will shun him: and, being discouraged, he may plunge deeper into vice than ever. This is about all I have to say.\"  Frank resumed the chair, and several of the members, perceiving the force of the president's reasoning, expressed themselves in favor of admitting Tim; when Charles Hardy rose and \"plumed himself for a speech.\"  \"Mr. President: I confess my surprise at the direction this debate has taken. There's a _destiny_ that shapes our ends--\"  \"A what?\" asked Fred Harper, with a roguish smile.  \"I beg the member on the other side will not interrupt me,\" replied Charles, with offended dignity. \"I quote the line as John Adams used it, in his celebrated speech, 'Sink or swim.'\"  \"Who?\"  \"John Adams.\"  \"I beg the member's pardon, but John Adams never made any such speech,\" answered Fred who, it must be confessed, was rather too fond of tantalizing the ambitious youth.  \"Really, Mr. President, I am surprised that the member should deny what we all know. Why, the piece is in our reading book.\"  \"Daniel Webster put the speech into the mouth of Adams,\" added Frank; \"and the patriot is only supposed to have made it.\"  \"It amounts to the same thing,\" continued Charles, with a slight blush.  \"But your quotation was not correct,\" said Fred.  \"Perhaps the member will give me the correct reading of the passage.\"  \"With pleasure; the lines are from Shakspeare:--    'There's a Divinity that shapes our ends,       Roughhew them as we will.'  I fancy the lines will not suit the member now,\" continued Fred, as he cast a mischievous glance at the discomfited speech-maker.  \"Go on, if you please,\" said Frank to Charles.  \"As I was saying, Mr. President, 'There's a Divinity that shapes our ends'--\"  \"You were not saying so,\" interposed Fred.  \"Order!\" said the chairman. \"Proceed.\"  But Charles Hardy could not proceed. Undoubtedly, when he rose to speak, he had an idea in his head; but it had fled, and he could not at once recall it. In vain he scratched his head, in vain he thrust his hands into his pockets, as if in search of the lost idea; it would not come.  \"You were speaking of Tim Bunker,\" said Frank, suggestively.  \"I was; and I was about to say that--that--\"  Some of the boys could no longer suppress their mirth, and, in spite of the vigorous pounding which the chairman bestowed upon the innocent table, in his attempts to preserve order, they had their laugh out. But the pleasantry of the members, and a sense of the awkwardness of his position, roused Charles to a more vigorous effort, and as he was about to speak of another topic, the lost idea came like a flood of sunshine.  \"'There's a Divinity that shapes our ends.' Tim Bunker has chosen the path he will tread, and does anybody suppose he will ever abandon it? He will certainly die in the State Prison or on the gallows--my father says so. We all know what his habits are, and it is as easy for an Ethiopian to change his _spots_--\"  \"Skin,\" said Fred.  \"To change his skin, as for such a fellow to be like us. He will lie, swear,--\"  \"The chair thinks the member's remarks are not strictly in order,\" interposed Frank, who was much pained to hear his friend use such violent language.  He saw that Charles was smarting under the effects of the ridicule which his companions had cast upon him, and that, in his struggle to make a speech, and thus redeem himself from the obloquy of a failure, he had permitted his impulses to override his judgment.  \"I forbear, then,\" continued the speaker. \"But I beg the club to consider the probable consequences of admitting such a fellow into the association. We have thus far enjoyed a good reputation, and we ought to be very careful how we tamper with our respectability.\"  \"Ahem!\" said Fred.  \"Order!\"  \"A good name is rather to be chosen than--than _purple and fine linen_.\"  \"Than what!\" exclaimed Fred.  \"Great riches,\" added Frank, with a smile, and even he was forced to admit \"that the member was singularly unfortunate in his quotations.\"  \"You have my opinion, gentlemen,\" said Charles, \"and I don't know that I have any thing more to say at present;\" and, much disconcerted, he sat down.  But though cast down, he was not destroyed; and in justice to his companions, it must be remarked that he had frequently annoyed the club by his attempts to make speeches more learned and ornate than his capacity would allow. Frank had reasoned with him on his propensity to \"show off,\" but without effect, so that he did not feel so much sympathy for him at the present time as he would have felt under other circumstances.  \"The question is still open for discussion,\" said the chairman.  No one, however, seemed disposed to speak.  \"Question!\" called Fred Harper.  \"Question!\" repeated several others.  \"Are you ready for the question?\" continued the chairman.  \"Question!\"  \"All those in favor of admitting Tim Bunker as a member of the club will signify it in the usual way.\"  Ten hands were raised.  \"Contrary minded.\"  Charles, feeling that he was on the wrong side, did not vote against the measure, and it was declared to be a unanimous vote.  \"The other matter, requiring the action of the club, relates to the proposed race between the Butterfly and the Zephyr. Several gentlemen of Rippleton feel a deep interest in the two boat clubs, and have proposed to put up a prize to be awarded to the successful club. I understand that fifty dollars have been subscribed for this purpose. The question is, Shall we pull for this prize?\"  \"When?\" asked Fred.  \"The clubs may choose their own time.\"  \"It wouldn't be fair till the Butterfly has had a chance to practise a while.\"  \"Of course not; the Butterfly may accept the proposition or not, and the club can select their own time.\"  \"I move you that the offer be accepted,\" said William Bright.  \"Second the motion,\" added James Vincent.  \"I make the motion, Mr. President, for the purpose of bringing the question properly before the club. I have not thought enough about the matter yet to decide whether I am in favor of it or not,\" continued William Bright.  \"It is generally supposed that the one who makes a motion is in favor of it; but we won't mind that now,\" said Frank, with a smile.  \"Mr. President, I must say, I think the proposition looks a little like gambling,\" suggested Charles Hardy.  \"So I was thinking,\" added a little fellow, near the foot of the table.  \"Suppose we take an informal vote,\" proposed Charles, who was determined to get on the right side this time, if possible.  So an informal vote _was_ taken, and every member voted against the proposition.  Frank Sedley was surprised at this result. Probably he was"]]]
