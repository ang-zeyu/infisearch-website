Hymn 1:7. The invitation of the gospel; or, Spiritual food and clothing, Isa. 55. 1 &c.  1 Let every mortal ear attend, And every heart rejoice, The trumpet of the gospel sounds With an inviting voice.  2 Ho, all ye hungry starving souls, That feed upon the wind, And vainly strive with earthly toys To fill an empty mind,  3 Eternal wisdom has prepar'd A soul reviving feast, And bids your longing appetites The rich provision taste.  4 Ho, ye that pant for living streams, And pine away and die, Here you may quench your raging thirst With springs that never dry.  5 Rivers of love and mercy here In a rich ocean join; Salvation in abundance flows, Like floods of milk and wine.  6 [Ye perishing and naked poor, Who work with mighty pain To weave a garment of your own That will not hide your sin,  7 Come naked, and adorn your souls In robes prepar'd by God, Wrought by the labours of his Son, And dy'd in his own blood.]  8 Dear God, the treasures of thy love Are everlasting mines, Deep as our helpless miseries are, And boundless as our sins.  9 The happy gates of gospel grace Stand open night and day, Lord, we are come to seek supplies, And drive our wants away.   Hymn 1:8. The safety and protection of the church, Isa. 26. 1-6.  1 How honourable is the place Where we adoring stand, Zion the glory of the earth, And beauty of the land!  2 Bulwarks of mighty grace defend The city where we dwell, The walls of strong salvation made, Defy th' assaults of hell.  3 Lift up the everlasting gates, The doors wide open fling, Enter, ye nations, that obey The statutes of our King.  4 Here you shall taste unmingled joys, And live in perfect peace, You that have known Jehovah's name, And ventur'd on his grace.  5 Trust in the Lord, for ever trust, And banish all your fears; Strength in the Lord Jehovah dwells, Eternal as his years.  6 [What tho' the rebels dwell on high, His arm shall bring them low, Low' as the caverns of the grave Their lofty heads shall bow.]  7 [On Babylon our feet shall tread In that rejoicing hour, The ruins of her walls shall spread A pavement for the poor.]   Hymn 1:9. The promises of the covenant of grace, Isa. 55. 1 2. Zech. 13. 1. Mich. 7. 19. Ezek. 36. 25 &c.  1 In vain we lavish out our lives To gather empty wind, The choicest blessings earth can yield Will starve a hungry mind.  2 Come and the Lord shall feed our souls With more substantial meat, With such as saints in glory love, With such as angels eat.  3 Our God will every want supply, And fill our hearts with peace; He gives by covenant and by oath The riches of his grace.  4 Come, and he'll cleanse our spotted souls, And wash away our stains, In the dear fountain that his Son Pour'd from his dying veins.  5 [Our guilt shall vanish all away Tho' black as hell before; Our sins shall sink beneath the sea, And shall be found no more.  6 And lest pollution should o'erspread Our inward powers again, His Spirit shall bedew our souls Like purifying rain.]  7 Our heart, that flinty stubborn thing, That terrors cannot move, That fears no threat'nings of his wrath, Shall be dissolv'd by love;  8 Or he can take the flint away That would not be refin'd, And from the treasures of his grace Bestow a softer mind.  9 There shall his sacred Spirit dwell, And deep engrave his law, And every motion of our souls To swift obedience draw.  10 Thus will he pour salvation down, And we shall render praise, We the dear people of his love, And he our God of grace.   Hymn 1:10. The blessedness of gospel times; or, The revelation of Christ to Jews and Gentiles, Isa. 5. 2 7-10. Matt. 13. 16 17.  1 How beauteous are their feet Who stand on Zion's hill! Who bring salvation on their tongues, And words of peace reveal!  2 How charming is their voice! How sweet the tidings are! \"Zion, behold thy Saviour King, He reigns and triumphs here.\"  3 How happy are our ears That hear this joyful sound, Which kings and prophets waited for, And sought, but never found!  4 How blessed are our eyes That see this heavenly light! Prophets and kings desir'd it long, But dy'd without the sight.  5 The watchmen join their voice, And tuneful notes employ; Jerusalem breaks forth in songs, And deserts leant the joy.  6 The Lord makes bare his arm Thro' all the earth abroad Let every nation now behold Their Saviour and their God.   Hymn 1:11. The humble enlightened, and carnal reason humbled; or, The sovereignty of grace, Luke 10. 21 22  1 There was an hour when Christ rejoic'd, And spoke his joy in words of praise; \"Father, I thank thee, mighty God, \"Lord of the earth, and heavens, and seas.  2 \"I thank thy sovereign power and love, \"That crowns my doctrine with success; \"And makes the babes in knowledge learn \"The heights, and breadths, and lengths of grace.  3 \"But all this glory lies conceal'd \"From men of prudence and of wit; \"The prince of darkness blinds their eyes, \"And their own pride resists the light.  4 \"Father, 'tis thus, because thy will \"Chose and ordain'd it should be so; \"T'is thy delight t' abase the proud, \"And lay the haughty scorner low.  5 \"There's none can know the Father right \"But those who learn it from the Son; \"Nor can the Son be well receiv'd, But where the Father makes him known.\"  6 Then let our souls adore our God That deals his graces as he please, Nor gives to mortals an account Or of his actions, or decrees.   Hymn 1:12. Free grace in revealing Christ, Luke 10. 21.  1 Jesus, the man of constant grief, A mourner all his days; His spirit once rejoic'd aloud, And tun'd his joy to praise.  2 \"Father, I thank thy wondrous love, \"That hath reveal'd thy Son \"To men unlearned; and to babes \"Has made thy gospel known.  3 \"The mysteries of redeeming grace \"Are hidden from the wise, \"While pride and carnal reasonings join \"To swell and blind their eyes.\"  4 Thus doth the Lord of heaven and earth His great decrees fulfil, And orders all his works of grace By his own sovereign will.   Hymn 1:13. The Son of God incarnate; or, The titles and the kingdom of Christ, Isa. 9. 2 6 7.  1 The lands that long in darkness lay Now have beheld a heavenly light; Nations that sat in death's cold shade Are bless'd with beams divinely bright.  2 The virgin's promis'd Son is born, Behold th' expected Child appear; What shall his names or titles be? The Wonderful, the Counsellor.  3 This infant is the mighty God Come to be suckled and ador'd Th' eternal Father, Prince of Peace, The son of David, and his Lord.  4 The government of earth and seas Upon his shoulders shall be laid His wide dominions still increase, And honours to his name be paid.  5 Jesus the holy child shall sit High on his father David's throne, Shall crush his foes beneath his feet, And reign to ages yet unknown.   Hymn 1:14. The triumph of faith; or, Christ's unchangeable love, Rom. 8. 33 &c.  1 Who shall the Lord's elect condemn? 'Tis God that justifies their souls, And mercy like a mighty stream O'er all their sins divinely rolls.   2 Who shall adjudge the saints to hell? 'Tis Christ that suffer'd in their stead, And the salvation to fulfil, Behold him rising from the dead.  3 He lives, he lives, and sits above, For ever interceding there: Who shall divide us from his love? Or what should tempt us to despair?  4 Shall persecution, or distress, Famine, or sword, or nakedness? He that hath lov'd us bears us thro', And makes us more than conquerors too.  5 Faith hath an overcoming power, It triumphs in the dying hour; Christ is our life, our joy, our hope, Nor can we sink with such a prop.  6 Not all that men on earth can do, Nor powers on high, nor powers below, Shall cause his mercy to remove, Or wean our hearts from Christ our love.   Hymn 1:15. Our own weakness, and Christ our strength, 2 Cor. 12. 7 9 10.  1 Let me but hear my Saviour say, \"Strength shall be equal to thy day,\" Then I rejoice in deep distress, Leaning on all-sufficient Grace.  2 I glory in infirmity, That Christ's own power may rest on me; When I am weak, then am I strong, Grace is my shield, and Christ my song.  3 I can do all things, or can bear All sufferings, if my Lord be there; Sweet pleasures mingle with the pains, While his left hand my head sustains.  4 But if the Lord be once withdrawn, And we attempt the work alone, When new temptations spring and rise We find how great our weakness is.  5 [So Samson, when his hair was lost, Met the Philistines to his cost; Shook his vain limbs with sad surprise, Made feeble fight, and lost his eyes.]   Hymn 1:16. Hosanna to Christ, Matt. 21. 9. Luke 19. 38 40.  1 Hosanna to the royal Son Of David's ancient line, His natures two, his person one, Mysterious and divine.  2 The root of David here we find, And offspring is the same; Eternity and time are join'd In our Immanuel's name.  3 Bless'd he that comes to wretched men With peaceful news from heaven; Hosannas of the highest strain To Christ the Lord be given.  4 Let mortals ne'er refuse to take Th' hosanna on their tongues, Lest rocks and stones should rise, and break Their silence into songs.   Hymn 1:17. Victory over death, 1 Cor. 15, 55 &c.  1 O for an overcoming faith To cheer my dying hours, To triumph o'er the monster Death, And all his frightful powers.  2 Joyful with all the strength I have My quivering lips should sing, \"Where is thy boasted victory, Grave? And where the monster's sting?\"  3 If sin be pardon'd I'm secure, Death hath no sting beside; The law gives sin its damning power, But Christ, my ransom, died.  4 Now to the God of victory Immortal thanks be paid, Who makes us conquerors while we die, Thro' Christ our living head.   Hymn 1:18. Blessed are the dead that die in the Lord, Rev. 14. 13.  1 Hear what the voice from heaven proclaims, For all the pious dead, Sweet is the savour of their names,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13341"],["title","Hymns and Spiritual Songs (#2)"],["body"," And soft their sleeping bed.  2 They die in Jesus, and are bless'd; How kind their slumbers are! From sufferings and from sins releas'd, And freed from every snare.  3 Far from this world of toil and strife, They're present with the Lord; The labours of their mortal life End in a large reward.   Hymn 1:19. The song of Simeon; or, Death made desirable, Luke 2. 27 &c.  1 Lord at thy temple we appear, As happy Simeon came, And hope to meet our Saviour here; O make our joys the same!  2 With what divine and vast delight The good old man was fill'd, When fondly in his wither'd arms He clasp'd the holy child!  3 \"Now I can leave this world,\" he cry'd, \"Behold thy servant dies, \"I've seen thy great salvation, Lord, \"And close my peaceful eyes.  4 \"This is the light prepar'd to shine \"Upon the Gentile lands, \"Thine Israel's glory, and their hope \"To break their slavish bands.\"  5 [Jesus, the vision of thy face Hath overpowering charms Scarce shall I feel death's cold embrace If Christ be in my arms.  6 Then while ye hear my heart-strings break, How sweet my minutes roll! A mortal paleness on my cheek, And glory in my soul.]   Hymn 1:20. Spiritual apparel; namely, the robe of righteousness, and garments of salvation, Isa. 61. 10.  1 Awake, my heart, arise, my tongue, Prepare a tuneful voice, In God the life of all my joys, Aloud will I rejoice.  2 'Tis he adorn'd my naked soul, And made salvation mine, Upon a poor polluted worm He makes his graces shine.  3 And lest the shadow of a spot Should on my soul be found, He took the robe the Saviour wrought, And cast it all around.  4 How far the heavenly robe exceeds What earthly princes wear! These ornaments, how bright they shine! How white the garments are!  5 The Spirit wrought my faith and love, And hope, and every grace; But Jesus spent his life to work The robe of righteousness.  6 Strangely, my soul, art thou array'd By the great sacred Three: In sweetest harmony of praise Let all thy powers agree.   Hymn 1:21. A vision of the kingdom of Christ among men, Rev. 21. 1-4.  1 Lo, what a glorious sight appears To our believing eyes! The earth and sea are pass'd away, And the old rolling skies.  2 From the third heaven where God resides, That holy happy place, The New Jerusalem comes down Adorn'd with shining grace.  3 Attending angels shout for joy, And the bright armies sing, \"Mortals, behold the sacred seat \"Of your descending King.  4 \"The God of glory down to men \"Removes his blest abode, \"Men the dear objects of his grace, \"And he the loving God.  5 \"His own soft hand shall wipe the tears \"From every weeping eye, \"And pains, and groans, and griefs, and fears, \"And death itself shall die.\"  6 How long, dear Saviour, O how long, Shall this bright hour delay! Fly swifter round, ye wheels of time, And bring the welcome day.   Hymn 1:22. [Supplement.] Flesh and Spirit. Rom. 8. 1.  1 What vain desires, and passions vain, Attend this mortal clay! Oft have they pierc'd my soul with pain, And drawn my heart astray.  2 How have I wander'd from my God, And following sin and shame In this vile world of flesh and blood Defil'd my nobler frame!  3 For ever blessed be thy grace That form'd my soul anew, And made it of an heaven-born race, Thy glory to pursue.  4 My spirit holds perpetual war, And wrestles and complains; But views the happy moment near That shall dissolve its chains.  5 Cheerful in death I close my eyes, To part with every lust; And charge my flesh whene'er it rise To leave them in the dust.  6 My purer spirit shall not fear To put this body on: Its tempting powers no more are there, Its lusts and passions gone.   Hymn 1:23. [Supplement.] A hopeful youth falling short of heaven, Mark 10. 21.  1 Must all the charms of nature then So hopeless to salvation prove? Can hell demand, can heaven condemn The man whom Jesus deigns to love?  2 The man who sought the ways of truth, Paid friends and neighbours all their due, (A modest, sober, lovely youth) And thought he wanted nothing now.  3 But mark the change! thus spake the Lord, \"Come, part with earth for heaven to-day,\" The youth astonish'd at the word, In silent sadness went his way.  4 Poor virtues that he boasted so, This test unable to endure; Let Christ, and grace, and glory go To make his land and money sure.  5 Ah foolish choice of treasures here! Ah fatal love of tempting gold! Must this base world be bought so dear? Are life and heaven so cheaply sold?  6 In vain the charms of nature shine, If this vile passion govern me: Transform my soul, O love divine, And make me part with all for thee.   Hymn 1:24. The rich sinner dying, Psalm 49. 6 9. Eccl. 8. 8. Job 3. 14 15.  1 In vain the wealthy mortals toil, And heap their shining dust in vain, Look down and scorn the humble poor, And boast their lofty hills of gain.  2 Their golden cordials cannot ease Their pained hearts or aching heads, Nor fright nor bribe approaching death From glittering roofs and downy beds.  3 The lingering, the unwilling soul The dismal summons must obey, And bid a long a sad farewell To the pale lump of lifeless clay.  4 Thence they are huddled to the grave, Where kings and slaves have equal thrones; Their bones without distinction lie Amongst the heap of meaner bones.  The rest referred to Psalm 49.   Hymn 1:25. A vision of the Lamb, Rev 5. 6-9.  1 All mortal vanities, be gone, Nor tempt my eyes, nor tire my ears, Behold amidst th' eternal throne A vision of the Lamb appears.  2[Glory his fleecy robe adorns, Mark'd with the bloody death he bore; Seven are his eyes, and seven his horns, To speak his wisdom and his power.  3 Lo, he receives a sealed book From him that sits upon the throne: Jesus, my Lord, prevails to look On dark decrees, and things unknown.]  4 All the assembling saints around Fall worshipping before the Lamb, And in new songs of gospel-sound Address their honours to his name,  5 The joy, the shout, the harmony Flies o'er the everlasting hills, \"Worthy art thou alone,\" they cry, \"To read the book, to loose the seals.\"]  6 Our voices join the heavenly strain, And with transporting pleasure sing, \"Worthy the Lamb that once was slain, \"To be our teacher and our king!\"  7 His words of prophecy reveal Eternal counsels, deep designs; His grace and vengeance shall fulfil The peaceful and the dreadful lines.  8 Thou hast redeem'd our souls from hell 'With thine invaluable blood; And wretches that did once rebel Are now made favourites of their Cod.  9 Worthy for ever is the Lord, That died for treasons not his own, By every tongue to be ador'd, And dwell upon his Father's throne.   Hymn 1:26. Hope of heaven by the resurrection of Christ, 1 Peter 1. 3-5.  1 Bless'd be the everlasting God, The Father of our Lord, Be his abounding mercy prais'd, His majesty ador'd.  2 When from the dead he rais'd his Son, And call'd him to the sky, He gave our souls a lively hope That they should never die.  3 What tho' our inbred sins require Our flesh to see the dust! Yet as the Lord our Saviour rose, So all his followers must.  4 There's an inheritance divine Reserv'd against that day, 'Tis uncorrupted, undefil'd, And cannot waste away.  5 Saints by the power of God are kept Till the salvation come; We walk by faith as strangers here Till Christ shall call us home.   Hymn 1:27. Assurance of heaven; or, A saint prepared to die, 2 Tim. 4. 6 7 8 18.  1 [Death may dissolve my body now, And bear my spirit home; Why do my minutes move so slow, Nor my salvation come?  2 With heavenly weapons I have fought The battles of the Lord, Finish'd my course, and kept the faith, And wait the sure reward.]  3 God has laid up in heaven for me A crown which cannot fade; The righteous Judge at that great day Shall place it on my head.  4 Nor hath the King of grace decreed This prize for me alone; But all that love and long to see Th' appearance of his Son.  5 Jesus the Lord shall guard me safe From every ill design; And to his heavenly kingdom keep This feeble soul of mine.  6 God is my everlasting aid And hell shall rage in vain; To him be highest glory paid, And endless praise.--Amen.   Hymn 1:28. The triumph of Christ over the enemies of his church, Isa. 63. 1 2 3 &c.  1 What mighty man, or mighty God, Comes travelling in state, Along the Idumean road, Away from Bozrah's gate?  2 The glory of his robes proclaim 'Tis some victorious king: \"'Tis I, the just, th' Almighty One, \"That your salvation bring.\"  3 \"Why, mighty Lord,\" thy saints enquire, \"Why thine apparel red? \"And all thy vesture stain'd like those \"Who in the wine-press tread?\"  4 \"I by myself have trod the press, \"And crush'd my foes alone, \"My wrath has struck the rebels dead, \"My fury stamp'd them down.  5 \"'Tis Edom's blood that dyes my robes \"With joyful scarlet stains, \"The triumph that my raiment wears \"Sprung from their bleeding veins.  6 \"Thus shall the nations be destroy'd \"That dare insult my saints, \"I have an arm t' avenge their wrongs, \"An ear for their complaints.\"   Hymn 1:29. The ruin of Antichrist, Isa. 63. 4-7.  1 \"I lift my banners,\" saith the Lord, \"Where Antichrist has stood, \"The city of my gospel-foes \"Shall be a field of blood.  2 \"My heart has study'd just revenge, \"And now the day appears, \"The day of my redeem'd is come \"To wipe away their tears.  3 \"Quite weary is my patience grown, \"And bids my fury go \"Swift as the lightning it shall move, \"And be as fatal too.  4 \"I call for helpers but in vain: \"Then has my gospel none? \"Well, mine own arm has might enough \"To crush my foes alone.  5 \"Slaughter and my devouring sword \"Shall walk the streets around, \"Babel shall reel beneath my stroke, \"And stagger to the ground.\"  6 Thy honours, O victorious King! Thine own right-hand shall raise, While we thy awful vengeance sing, And our deliverer praise.   Hymn 1:30. Prayer for deliverance answered, Isa. 26. 8-12 20 21.  1 In thine own ways, O God of love, We wait the visits of thy grace, Our souls desire is to thy Name, And the remembrance of thy face.  2 My thoughts are searching,"]]]
