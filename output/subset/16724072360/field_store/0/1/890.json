HYMN BEFORE MEAT     Blest Cross-bearer, Source of good,     Light-creating, Word-begot,   Gracious child of maidenhood,     Bosomed in the Fatherhood,   When earth, sea and stars were not.    With Thy cloudless, healing gaze     Shine upon me from above:   Let Thine all-enlightening rays     Bless this meal and quicken praise,   Praise unto Thy name of Love.    Lord, without Thee nought is sweet,     Nought my life can satisfy,   If Thy favour make not meet     What I drink and what I eat;   Let faith all things sanctify!    O'er this bread God's grace be poured,     Christ's sweet fragrance fill the bowl!   Rule my converse, Triune Lord,     Sober thought and sportive word,   All my acts and all my soul.    Spoils of rose-trees are not spent,     Nor rich unguents on my board:   But ambrosial sweets are sent,     Of faith's nectar redolent,   From the bosom of my Lord.    Scorn, my Muse, light ivy-leaves     Wherewith custom wreathed thy brow:   Love a mystic crown conceives     And a rhythmic garland weaves:   Bind on thee God's praises now.    What more worthy gift can I,     Child of light and aether, bring   Than for boons the Maker high     From His bounty doth supply   Lovingly my thanks to sing?    He hath set 'neath our command     All that ever rose to be,   All that sky and sea and land     Breed in air, in glebe and sand,   Made my slaves, His own made me.    Fowler's craft with gin and net     Feathered tribes of heaven ensnares:   Osier twigs with lime o'erset     That their airy flight may let   His relentless guile prepares.    Lo! with woven mesh the seine     Swimming shoals draws from the wave:   Nor do fish the bait disdain     Till they feel the barb's swift pain,   Captives of the food they crave.    Native wealth that knows no fail,     Golden wheat springs from the field:   Tendrils lush o'er vineyards trail,     Nursed of Peace the olives pale   Berries green unbidden yield.    Christ's grace fills His people's need     With these mercies ever fresh:   Far from us be that foul greed,     Gluttony that loves to feed   On slain oxen's bloodstained flesh.    Leave to the barbarian brood     Banquet of the slaughtered beast:   Ours the homely, garden food,     Greenstuff manifold and good   And the lentils' harmless feast.    Foaming milkpails bubble o'er     With the udders' snowy stream,   Which in thickening churns we pour     Or in wicker baskets store,   As the cheese is pressed from cream.    Honey's nectar for our use     From the new-made comb is shed:   Which the skilful bee imbues     With thyme's scent and airy dews,   Plying lonely toils unwed.    Orchard-groves now mellowed o'er     Bounteously their fruitage shed:   See! like rain on forest floor     Shaken trees their riches pour,   High-heaped apples, ripe and red.    What great trumpet voice or lyre     Famed of yore could fitly praise   Gifts of the Almighty Sire,     Blessings that His own require,   Richly lavished through their days?    When morn breaks upon our sight,     Hymns, O Lord, to Thee shall ring:   Thee, when streams the midday light,     Thee, when shadows of the night   Bid us sup, our voices sing.    For my body's vital heat,     For my heart-blood's pulsing vein,   For my tongue and speech complete     Unto Thee, Most High, 'tis meet   That I raise my grateful strain.    'Twas, O Holy One, Thy care     Wrought us from the plastic clay,   Made us Thine own image bear,     And for our perfection fair   Did Thy Breath to man convey.    On the twain Thou didst bestow     Leafy bowers in pleasaunce fair:   Where spring's scents for aye did blow,     And four stately streams did flow   O'er meads pied with blossoms rare.    \"All this realm ye now shall sway:\"     (Saidst Thou) \"use it at your will,   Yet 'tis death your hands to lay     On the Tree, whose verdant sway   Doth the midmost garden fill.\"    Then the Serpent's guileful hate     Would not innocency spare:"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14964"],["title","From Canal Boy to President; Or, the Boyhood and Manhood of James A. Garfield (#1)"],["body","a sore loss by Jimmy, who was in the habit of following him about, and watching him when he was at work. Sometimes his brother gave the little fellow a trifle to do, and Jimmy was always pleased to help, for he was fond of work, and when he grew older and stronger he was himself a sturdy and indefatigable worker in ways not dreamed of then.  The first fortnight was up, and Thomas was expected home. No one was more anxious to see him than his little brother, and that was why Jimmy had come out from his humble home, and was looking so earnestly across the clearing.  At last he saw him, and ran as fast as short legs could carry him to meet his brother.  \"Oh, Tommy, how I've missed you!\" he said.  \"Have you, Jimmy?\" asked Thomas, passing his arm around his little brother's neck. \"I have missed you too, and all the family. Are all well?\"  \"Oh, yes.\"  \"That is good.\"  As they neared the cabin Mrs. Garfield came out, and welcomed her oldest boy home.  \"We are all glad to see you, Thomas,\" she said. \"How have you got along?\"  \"Very well, mother.\"  \"Was the work hard?\"  \"The hours were pretty long. I had to work fourteen hours a day.\"  \"That is too long for a boy of your age to work,\" said his mother anxiously.  \"Oh, it hasn't hurt me, mother,\" said Thomas, laughing. \"Besides, you must remember I have been well paid. What do you say to that?\"  He drew from his pocket twelve silver half-dollars, and laid them on the table, a glittering heap.  \"Is it all yours, Tommy?\" asked his little brother wonderingly.  \"No, it belongs to mother. I give it to her.\"  \"Thank you, Thomas,\" said Mrs. Garfield, \"but at least you ought to be consulted about how it shall be spent. Is there anything you need for yourself?\"  \"Oh, never mind me! I want Jimmy to have a pair of shoes.\"  Jimmy looked with interest at his little bare feet, and thought he would like some shoes. In fact they would be his first, for thus far in life he had been a barefooted boy.  \"Jimmy shall have his shoes,\" said Mrs. Garfield; \"when you see the shoemaker ask him to come here as soon as he can make it convenient.\"  So, a few days later the shoemaker, who may possibly have had no shop of his own, called at the log-cabin, measured Jimmy for a pair of shoes, and made them on the spot, boarding out a part of his pay.  The first pair of shoes made an important epoch in Jimmy Garfield's life, for it was decided that he could now go to school.     CHAPTER II.  GROWING IN WISDOM AND STATURE.   The school was in the village a mile and a half away. It was a long walk for a little boy of four, but sometimes his sister Mehetabel, now thirteen years old, carried him on her back. When in winter the snow lay deep on the ground Jimmy's books were brought home, and he recited his lessons to his mother.  This may be a good time to say something of the family whose name in after years was to become a household word throughout the republic. They had been long in the country. They were literally one of the first families, for in 1636, only sixteen years after the Pilgrims landed on Plymouth rock, and the same year that Harvard College was founded, Edward Garfield, who had come from the edge of Wales, settled in Watertown, Massachusetts, less than four miles from the infant college, and there for more than a century was the family home, as several moss-grown headstones in the ancient graveyard still testify.  They did their part in the Revolutionary war, and it was not till the war was over that Solomon Garfield, the great grandfather of the future President, removed to the town of Worcester, Otsego County, N.Y. Here lived the Garfields for two generations. Then Abram Garfield, the father of James, moved to Northeastern Ohio, and bought a tract of eighty acres, on which stood the log-cabin, built by himself, in which our story opens. His wife belonged to a distinguished family of New England--the Ballous--and possessed the strong traits of her kindred.  But the little farm of eighty acres was smaller now. Abram Garfield died in debt, and his wife sold off fifty acres to pay his creditors, leaving thirty, which with her own industry and that of her oldest son served to maintain her little family.  The school-house was so far away that Mrs. Garfield, who appreciated the importance of education for her children, offered her neighbors a site for a new school-house on her own land, and one was built. Here winter after winter came teachers, some of limited qualifications, to instruct the children of the neighborhood, and here Jimmy enlarged his stock of book-learning by slow degrees.  The years passed, and still they lived in the humble log-cabin, till at the age of twenty-one Thomas came home from Michigan, where he had been engaged in clearing land for a farmer, bringing seventy-five dollars in gold.  \"Now, mother,\" he said, \"you shall have a framed house.\"  Seventy-five dollars would not pay for a framed house, but he cut timber himself, got out the boards, and added his own labor, and that of Jimmy, now fourteen years old, and so the house was built, and the log-cabin became a thing of the past. But it had been their home for a long time, and doubtless many happy days had been spent beneath its humble roof.  While the house was being built, Jimmy learned one thing--that he was handy with tools, and was well fitted to become a carpenter. When the joiner told him that he was born to be a carpenter, he thought with joy that this unexpected talent would enable him to help his mother, and earn something toward the family expenses. So, for the next two years he worked at this new business when opportunity offered, and if my reader should go to Chagrin Falls, Ohio, he could probably find upon inquiry several barns in the vicinity which Jimmy helped to build.  He still went to school, however, and obtained such knowledge of the mysteries of grammar, arithmetic, and geography as could be obtained in the common schools of that day.  But Jimmy Garfield was not born to be a carpenter, and I believe never got so far along as to assist in building a house.  He was employed to build a wood-shed for a black-salter, ten miles away from his mother's house, and when the job was finished his employer fell into conversation with him, and being a man of limited acquirements himself, was impressed by the boy's surprising stock of knowledge.  \"You kin read, you kin write, and you are death on figgers,\" he said to him one day. \"If you'll stay with me, keep my 'counts, and 'tend to the saltery, I'll find you, and give you fourteen dollars a month.\"  Jimmy was dazzled by this brilliant offer. He felt that to accept it would be to enter upon the high-road to riches, and he resolved to do so if his mother would consent. Ten miles he trudged through the woods to ask his mother's consent, which with some difficulty he obtained, for she did not know to what influences he might be subjected, and so he got started in a new business.  Whether he would have fulfilled his employer's prediction, and some day been at the head of a saltery of his own, we can not tell; but in time he became dissatisfied with his situation, and returning home, waited for Providence to indicate some new path on which to enter.  One thing, however, was certain: he would not be content to remain long without employment. He had an active temperament, and would have been happiest when busy, even if he had not known that his mother needed the fruits of his labor.  He had one source of enjoyment while employed by the black-salter, which he fully appreciated. Strange to say, his employer had a library, that is, he had a small collection of books, gathered by his daughter, prominent among which were Marryatt's novels, and \"Sinbad the Sailor.\" They opened a new world to his young accountant, and gave him an intense desire to see the world, and especially to cross the great sea, even in the capacity of a sailor. At home there was no library, not from the lack of literary taste, but because there was no money to spend for anything but necessaries.  He had not been long at home when a neighbor, entering one day, said, \"James, do you want a job?\"  \"Yes,\" answered James, eagerly.  \"There's a farmer in Newburg wants some wood chopped.\"  \"I can do it,\" said James, quietly.  \"Then you'd better go and see him.\"  Newburg is within the present limits of Cleveland, and thither James betook himself the next day.  He was a stout boy, with the broad shoulders and sturdy frame of his former ancestors, and he was sure he could give satisfaction.  The farmer, dressed in homespun, looked up as the boy approached.  \"Are you Mr. ----?\" asked James.  \"Yes.\"  \"I heard that you wanted some wood chopped.\"  \"Yes, but I am not sure if you can do it,\" answered the farmer, surveying the boy critically.  \"I can do it,\" said James, confidently.  \"Very well, you can try. I'll give you seven dollars for the job.\"  The price was probably satisfactory, for James engaged to do the work. There proved to be twenty-five cords, and no one, I think, will consider that he was overpaid for his labor.  He was fortunate, at least, in the scene of his labor, for it was on the shore of Lake Erie, and as he lifted his eyes from his work they rested on the broad bosom of the beautiful lake, almost broad enough as it appeared to be the ocean itself, which he had a strange desire to traverse in search of the unknown lands of which he had read or dreamed.  I suppose there are few boys who have not at some time fancied that they should like \"a life on the ocean wave, and a home on the rolling deep.\" I have in mind a friend, now a physician, who at the age of fifteen left a luxurious home, with the reluctant permission of his parents, for a voyage before the mast to Liverpool, beguiled by one of the fascinating narratives of Herman Melville. But the romance very soon wore off, and by the time the boy reached Halifax, where the ship put in, he was so seasick, and so sick of the sea, that he begged to be"]]]
