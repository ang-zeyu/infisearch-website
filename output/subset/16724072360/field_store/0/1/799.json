Any man but Weary would have ruined the horse with harshness, but Weary was really proud of his deviltry and would laugh till the tears came while he told of some new and undreamed bit of cussedness in his pet.  On this day, Glory was behaving beautifully.  True, he had nearly squeezed the life out of Weary that morning when he went to saddle him in the stall, and he had afterwards snatched Cal Emmet's hat off with his teeth, and had dropped it to the ground and had stood upon it; but on the whole, the Happy Family regarded those trifles as a good sign.  When Bert Rogers and Weary ambled away down the dusty trail to the starting point, accompanied by most of the Flying U boys and two or three from Bert's outfit, the crowd in the grand-stand (which was the top rail of the stockyard fence) hushed expectantly.  When a pistol cracked, far down the road, and a faint yell came shrilling through the quiet sunshine, they craned necks till their muscles ached.  Like a summer sand-storm they came, and behind them clattered their friends, the dust concealing horse and rider alike. Whooping encouraging words at random, they waited till a black nose shot out from the rushing cloud.  That was Flopper.  Beside it a white streak, a flying, silvery mane--Glory was running!  Happy Jack gave a raucous yell.  Lifting reluctantly, the dust gave hazy glimpses of a long, black body hugging jealously close to earth, its rider lying low upon the straining neck--that was Flopper and Bert.  Close beside, a sheeny glimmer of red, a tossing fringe of white, a leaning, wiry, exultant form above--that was Glory and Weary.  There were groans as well as shouting when the whirlwind had swept past and on down the hill toward town, and the reason thereof was plain. Glory had won by a good length of him.  Bert Rogers said something savage and set his weight upon the bit till Flopper, snorting and disgusted--for a horse knows when he is beaten--took shorter leaps, stiffened his front legs and stopped, digging furrows with his feet.  Glory sailed on down the trail, scattering Mrs. Jenson's chickens and jumping clean over a lumbering, protesting sow.  \"Come on--he's going to set up the drinks!\" yelled someone, and the crowd leaped from the fence and followed.  But Glory did not stop.  He whipped around the saloon, whirled past the blacksmith shop and was headed for the mouth of the lane before anyone understood.  Then Chip, suddenly grasping the situation, dug deep with his spurs and yelled.  \"He's broken the bit--it's a runaway!\"  Thus began the second race, a free-for-all dash up the lane.  At the very start they knew it was hopeless to attempt overtaking that red streak, but they galloped a mile for good manners' sake; Cal then pulled up.  \"No use,\" he said.  \"Glory's headed for home and we ain't got the papers to stop him.  He can't hurt Weary--and the dance opens up at six, and I've got a girl in town.\"  \"Same here,\" grinned Bert.  \"It's after four, now.\"  Chip, who at that time hadn't a girl--and didn't want one--let Silver out for another long gallop, seeing it was Weary.  Then he, too, gave up the chase and turned back.  Glory settled to a long lope and kept steadily on, gleefully rattling the broken bit which dangled beneath his jaws.  Weary, helpless and amused and triumphant because the race was his, sat unconcernedly in the saddle and laid imaginary bets with himself on the outcome. Without doubt, Glory was headed for home.  Weary figured that, barring accidents, he could catch up Blazes, in the little pasture, and ride back to Dry Lake by the time the dance was in full swing--for the dancing before dark would be desultory and without much spirit.  But the gate into the big field was closed and tied securely with a rope.  Glory comprehended the fact with one roll of his knowing eyes, turned away to the left and took the trail which wound like a snake into the foothills.  Clinging warily to the level where choice was given him, trotting where the way was rough, mile after mile he covered till even Weary's patience showed signs of weakening.  Just then Glory turned, where a wire gate lay flat upon the ground, crossed a pebbly creek and galloped stiffly up to the very steps of a squat, vine-covered ranch-house where, like the Discontented Pendulum in the fable, he suddenly stopped.  \"Damn you, Glory--I could kill yuh for this!\" gritted Weary, and slid reluctantly from the saddle.  For while the place seemed deserted, it was not.  There was a girl.  She lay in a hammock; sprawled would come nearer describing her position.  She had some magazines scattered around upon the porch, and her hair hung down to the floor in a thick, dark braid.  She was dressed in a dark skirt and what, to Weary's untrained, masculine eyes, looked like a pink gunny sack.  In reality it was a kimono.  She appeared to be asleep.  Weary saw a chance of leading Glory quietly to the corral before she woke.  There he could borrow a bridle and ride back whence he came, and he could explain about the bridle to Joe Meeker in town.  Joe was always good about lending things, anyway.  He gathered the fragments of the bit in one hand and clucked under his breath, in an agony lest his spurs should jingle.  Glory turned upon him his beautiful, brown eyes, reproachfully questioning.  Weary pulled steadily.  Glory stretched neck and nose obediently, but as to feet, they were down to stay.  Weary glanced anxiously toward the hammock and perspired, then stood back and whispered language it would be a sin to repeat.  Glory, listening with unruffled calm, stood perfectly still, like a red statue in the sunshine.  The face of the girl was hidden under one round, loose-sleeved arm. She did not move.  A faint breeze, freshening in spasmodic puffs, seized upon the hammock, and set it swaying gently.  \"Oh, damn you, Glory!\" whispered Weary through his teeth.  But Glory, accustomed to being damned since he was a yearling, displayed absolutely no interest.  Indeed, he seemed inclined to doze there in the sun.  Taking his hat--his best hat--from his head, he belabored Glory viciously over the jaws with it; silently except for the soft thud and slap of felt on flesh.  And the mood of him was as near murder as Weary could come.  Glory had been belabored with worse things than hats during his eventful career; he laid back his ears, shut his eyes tight and took it meekly.  There came a gasping gurgle from the hammock, and Weary's hand stopped in mid-air.  The girl's head was burrowed in a pillow and her slippers tapped the floor while she laughed and laughed.  Weary delivered a parting whack, put on his hat and looked at her uncertainly; grinned sheepishly when the humor of the thing came to him slowly, and finally sat down upon the porch steps and laughed with her.  \"Oh, gee!  It was too funny,\" gasped the girl, sitting up and wiping her eyes.  Weary gasped also, though it was a small matter--a common little word of three letters.  In all the messages sent him by the schoolma'am, it was the precise, school-grammar wording of them which had irritated him most and impressed him insensibly with the belief that she was too prim to be quite human.  The Happy Family had felt all along that they were artists in that line, and they knew that the precise sentences ever carried conviction of their truth.  Weary mopped his perspiring face upon a white silk handkerchief and meditated wonderingly.  \"You aren't a train-robber or a horsethief, or--anything, are you?\" she asked him presently.  \"You seemed quite upset at seeing the place wasn't deserted; but I'm sure, if you are a robber running away from a sheriff, I'd never dream of stopping you.  Please don't mind me; just make yourself at home.\"  Weary turned his head and looked straight up at her.  \"I'm afraid I'll have to disappoint yuh, Miss Satterly,\" he said blandly.  \"I'm just an ordinary human, and my name is Davidson--better known as Weary.  You don't appear to remember me.  We've met before.\"  She eyed him attentively.  \"Perhaps we have--it you say so.  I'm wretched about remembering strange names and faces.  Was it at a dance? I meet so many fellows at dances--\"  She waved a brown little hand and smiled deprecatingly.  \"Yes,\" said Weary laconically, still looking into her face.  \"It was.\"  She stared down at him, her brows puckered.  \"I know, now.  It was at the Saint Patrick's dance in Dry Lake!  How silly of me to forget.\"  Weary turned his gaze to the hill beyond the creek, and fanned his hot face with his hat.  \"It was not.  It wasn't at that dance, at all.\" Funny she didn't remember him!  He suspected her of trying to fool him, now that he was actually in her presence, and he refused absolutely to be fooled.  He could see that she threw out her hand helplessly.  \"Well, I may as well 'fess up.  I don't remember you at all.  It's horrid of me, when you rode up in that lovely, unconventional way.  But you see, at dances one doesn't think of the men as individuals; they're just good or bad partners.  It resolves itself, you see, into a question of feet.  If I should dance with you again,--_did_ I dance with you?\"  Weary shot a quick, eloquent glance in her direction.  He did not say anything.  Miss Satterly blushed.  \"I was going to say, if I danced with you again I should no doubt remember you perfectly.\"  Weary was betrayed into a smile.  \"If I could dance in these boots, I'd take off my spurs and try and identify myself.  But I guess I'll have to ask yuh to take my word for it that we're acquainted.\"  \"Oh, I will.  I meant to, all along.  Why aren't you in town, celebrating?  I thought I was the only unpatriotic person in the country.\"  \"I just came from town,\" Weary told her, choosing, his words carefully while yet striving to be truthful.  No man likes confessing to a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14542"],["title","The Lonesome Trail and Other Stories (#2)"],["body","that he has been run away with.  \"I--er--broke my bridle-bit, back a few miles\" (it was fifteen, if it were a rod) \"and so I rode in here to get one of Joe's.  I didn't want to bother anybody, but Glory seemed to think this was where the trail ended.\"  Miss Satterly laughed again.  \"It certainly was funny--you trying to get him away, and being so still about it.  I _heard_ you whispering swear-words, and I wanted to scream!  I just couldn't keep still any longer.  Is he balky?\"  \"I don't know what he is--now,\" said Weary plaintively.  \"He was, at that time.  He's generally what happens to be the most dev--mean under the circumstances.\"  \"Well, maybe he'll consent to being led to the stable; he looks as if he had a most unmerciful master!\"  (Weary, being perfectly innocent, blushed guiltily)  \"But I'll forgive you riding him like that, and make for you a pitcher of lemonade and give you some cake while he rests. You certainly must not ride back with him so tired.\"  Fresh lemonade sounded tempting, after that ride.  And being lectured was not at all what he had expected from the schoolma'am--and who can fathom the mind of a man?  Weary gave her one complex glance, laid his hand upon the bridle and discovered that Glory, having done what mischief he could, was disposed to be very meek.  At the corral gate Weary looked back.  \"At dances,\" he mused aloud, \"one doesn't consider men as individuals--it's merely a question of feet.  She took me for a train robber; and I danced with her about forty times, that night, and took her over to supper and we whacked up on our chicken salad because there was only one dish for the two of us--oh, mamma!\"  He pulled off the saddle with a preoccupied air and rubbed Glory down mechanically.  After that he went over and sat down on the oats' box and smoked two cigarettes while he pondered many things.  He stood up and thoughtfully surveyed himself, brushed sundry bright sorrel hairs from his coat sleeves, stooped and tried to pinch creases into the knees of his trousers, which showed symptoms of \"bagging.\"  He took off his hat and polished it with his sleeve he had just brushed so carefully, pinched four big dimples in the crown, turned it around three times for critical inspection, placed it upon his head at a studiously unstudied angle, felt anxiously at his neck-gear and slapped Glory affectionately upon the rump--and came near getting kicked into eternity.  Then he swung off up the path, softly whistling \"In the good, old summer-time.\"  An old hen, hovering her chicks in the shade of the hay-rack, eyed him distrustfully and cried \"k-r-_r-r-r_\" in a shocked tone that sent her chickens burrowing deeper under her feathers.  Miss Satterly had changed her pink kimono for a white shirt-waist and had fluffed her hair into a smooth coil on the top of her head.  Weary thought she looked very nice.  She could make excellent lemonade, he discovered, and she proved herself altogether different from what the messages she sent him had led him to expect.  Weary wondered, until he became too interested to think about it.  Presently, without quite knowing how it came about, he was telling her all about the race.  Miss Satterly helped him reckon his winnings--which was not easy to do, since he had been offered all sorts of odds and had accepted them all with a recklessness that was appalling.  While her dark head was bent above the piece of paper, and her pencil was setting down figures with precise little jabs, he watched her.  He quite forgot the messages he had received from her through the medium of the Happy Family, and he quite forgot that women could hurt a man.  \"Mr. Davidson,\" she announced severely, when the figures had all been dabbed upon the paper, \"You ought to have lost.  It would be a lesson to you.  I haven't quite figured all your winnings, these six-to-ones and ten-to-ones and--and all that, take time to unravel.  But you, yourself, stood to lose just three hundred and sixty-five dollars. Gee! but you cowboys are reckless.\"  There was more that she said, but Weary did not mind.  He had discovered that he liked to look at the schoolma'am.  After that, nothing else was of much importance.  He began to wish he might prolong his opportunity for looking.  \"Say,\" he said suddenly, \"Come on and let's go to the dance.\"  The schoolma'am bit at her pencil and looked at him.  \"It's late--\"  \"Oh, there's time enough,\" urged Weary.  \"Maybe--but--\"  \"Do yuh think we aren't well enough acquainted?\"  \"Well we're not exactly old friends,\" she laughed.  \"We're going to be, so it's all the same,\" Weary surprised himself by declaring with much emphasis.  \"You'd go, wouldn't you, if I was--well, say your brother?\"  Miss Satterly rested her chin in her palms and regarded him measuringly.  \"I don't know.  I never had one--except three or four that I--er--adopted, at one time or another.  I suppose one could go, though--with a brother.\"  Weary made a rapid, mental note for the benefit of the Happy Family--and particularly Cal Emmett.  \"Darling Brother\" was a myth, then; he ought to have known it, all along.  And if that were a myth, so probably were all those messages and things that he had hated.  She didn't care anything about him--and suddenly that struck him unpleasantly, instead of being a relief, as it consistently should have been.  \"I wish you'd adopt me, just for to-night, and go;\" he said, and his eyes backed the wish.  \"You see,\" he added artfully, \"it's a sin to waste all that good music--a real, honest-to-God stringed orchestra from Great Falls, and--\"  \"Meekers have taken both rigs,\" objected she, weakly.  \"I noticed a side saddle hanging in the stable,\" he wheedled, \"and I'll gamble I can rustle something to put it on.  I--\"  \"I should think you'd gambled enough for one day,\" she quelled.  \"But that chunky little gray in the pasture is the horse I always ride.  I expect,\" she sighed, \"my new dancing dress would be a sight to behold when I got there--and it won't wash.  But what does a mere man care--\"  \"Wrap it up in something, and I'll carry it for yuh,\" Weary advised eagerly.  \"You can change at the hotel.  It's dead easy.\"  He picked up his hat from the floor, rose and stood looking anxiously down at her. \"About how soon,\" he insinuated, \"can you be ready?\"  The schoolma'am looked up at him irresolutely, drew a long breath and then laughed.  \"Oh, ten minutes will do,\" she surrendered.  \"I shall put my new dress in a box, and go just as I am.  Do you _always_ get your own way, Mr. Davidson?\"  \"Always,\" he lied convincingly over his shoulder, and jumped off the porch without bothering to use the steps.  She was waiting when he led the little gray up to the house, and she came down the steps with a large, flat, pasteboard box in her arms.  \"Don't get off,\" she commanded.  \"I can mount alone--and you'll have to carry the box.  It's going to be awkward, but you _would_ have me go.\"  Weary took the box and prudently remained in the saddle.  Glory, having the man he did for master, was unused to the flutter of women's skirts so close, and rolled his eyes till the whites showed all round. Moreover, he was not satisfied with that big, white thing in Weary's arms.  He stood quite still, however, until the schoolma'am was settled to her liking in the saddle, and had tucked her skirt down over the toe of her right foot.  He watched the proceeding with much interest--as did Weary--and then walked sedately from the yard, through the pebbly creek and up the slope beyond.  He heard Weary give a sigh of relief at his docility, and straightway thrust his nose between his white front feet, and proceeded to carry out certain little plans of his own.  Weary, taken by surprise and encumbered by the box, could not argue the point; he could only, in range parlance, \"hang and rattle.\"  \"Oh,\" cried Miss Satterly, \"if he's going to act like that, give me the box.\"  Weary would like to have done so, but already he was half way to the gate, and his coat was standing straight out behind to prove the speed of his flight.  He could not even look back.  He just hung tight to the box and rode.  The little gray was no racer, but his wind was good; and with urging he kept the fleeing Glory in sight for a mile or so.  Then, horse and rider were briefly silhouetted against the sunset as they topped a distant hill, and after that the schoolma'am rode by faith.  At the gate which led into the big Flying U field she overtook them. Glory, placid as a sheep, was nibbling a frayed end of the rope which held the gate shut, and Weary, the big box balanced in front of him across the saddle, was smoking a cigarette.  \"Well,\" greeted Miss Satterly breathlessly, and rather tartly, \"only for you having my dress, I'd have gone straight back home.  Do brothers always act like this?\"  \"Search me,\" said Weary, shaking his head.  \"Anyway, yuh better talk to Glory about it.  He appears to be running this show.  When I rode out to your place, I didn't have any bit in his mouth at all.  Coming back, I've got one of Joe Meeker's teething rings, that wouldn't hold a pet turkey.  But we're going to the dance, Miss Satterly.  Don't you worry none about that.\"  Miss Satterly laughed and rode ahead of them.  \"I'm going,\" she announced firmly.  \"It's leap year, and I think I can rustle a partner if you decide to sit and look through that gate all night.\"  \"You'll need your pretty dress.  Glory ain't much used to escorting young ladies, but he's a gentleman; we're coming, all right.\"  It was strange, perhaps, that Glory should miss the chance of proving his master a liar, but he nevertheless ambled decorously to Dry Lake and did nothing more unseemly than nipping occasionally at the neck of the little gray.  That is how Weary learned that large, brown eyes do not look sidelong at a man after the manner of long, heavy-lidded blue ones; and that, also, is how he came to throw up his head and deny to himself and his world that he ever was shy of"]]]
