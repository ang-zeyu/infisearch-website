Bowser looked up to the top of the tall tree where Blacky sat, and in his great, soft eyes was such a look of friendliness that it gave Blacky a funny feeling. You know Blacky is not used to friendly looks. He is used to quite the other kind. Bowser came out of the old sugar house where he had spent the night and whined softly as he looked up at Blacky, and as he whined he wagged his tail ever so slightly. Blacky didn't know what to make of it. He had never been more surprised in his life. He didn't know which surprised him most, finding Bowser 'way over here where he had no business to be, or Bowser's friendliness.  As for Bowser, he had spent such a forlorn, miserable night, and he was so terribly lonesome, that the very sound of Blacky's voice had given him a queer thrill. Never had he thought of Blacky the Crow as a friend. In fact, he never thought much about Blacky at all. Sometimes he had chased Blacky out of Farmer Brown's corn-field early in the spring but that is all he ever had had to do with him. Now, however, lonesome and lost as he was, the sound of a familiar voice made him tingle all over with a friendly feeling. So he whined softly and wagged his tail feebly as he looked up at Blacky sitting in the top of a tall tree. Presently Bowser limped out to the middle of the little clearing and turned first this way and then that way. Then he sat down and howled dismally. In an instant Blacky the Crow understood; Bowser was lost.  \"So that's the trouble,\" muttered Blacky to himself. \"That silly dog has got himself lost. I never will be able to understand how anybody can get lost. I never in my life was lost, and never expect to be. But it is easy enough to see that Bowser is lost and badly lost. My goodness, how lame he is! I wonder what's happened to him. Serves him right for hunting other people, but I'm sorry for him just the same. What a helpless creature a lost dog is, anyway. I suppose if he doesn't find a house pretty soon he will starve to death. Old Man Coyote wouldn't. Reddy Fox wouldn't. They would catch something to eat, no matter where they were. I suppose they wouldn't thank me for doing it, but just the same I think I'll take pity on Bowser and help him out of his trouble.\"      CHAPTER VIII  HOW BLACKY THE CROW HELPED BOWSER      The blackest coat may cover the kindest heart.      _Bowser the Hound._   When Blacky the Crow said to himself that he guessed he would take pity on Bowser and help him out of his trouble, he knew that he could do it without very much trouble to himself. Perhaps if there had been very much trouble in it, Blacky would not have been quite so ready and willing. Then again, perhaps it isn't fair to Blacky to think that he might not have been willing. Even the most selfish people are sometimes kindly and unselfish.  Blacky knew just where the nearest house was. You can always trust Blacky to know not only where every house is within sight of the places he frequents, but all about the people who live in each house. Blacky makes it his business to know these things. He could, if he would, tell you which houses have terrible guns in them and which have not. It is by knowing such things that Blacky manages to avoid danger.  \"If that dog knows enough to follow me, I'll take him where he can at least get something to eat,\" muttered Blacky. \"It won't be far out of my way, anyway, because if he has any sense at all, I won't have to go all the way over there.\"  So Blacky spread his black wings and disappeared over the tree-tops in the direction of the nearest farmhouse.  Bowser watched him disappear and whined sadly, for somehow it made him feel more lonesome than before. But for one thing he would have gone back to his bed of hay in the corner of that sugar camp. That one thing was hunger. It seemed to Bowser that his stomach was so empty that the very sides of it had fallen in. He just _must_ get something to eat.  So, after waiting a moment or two, Bowser turned and limped away through the trees, and he limped in the direction which Blacky the Crow had taken. You see, he could still hear Blacky's voice calling \"Caw, caw, caw\", and somehow it made him feel better, less lonesome, you know, to be within hearing of a voice he knew.  Bowser had to go on three legs, for one leg had been so hurt in the fall over the bank that he could not put his foot to the ground. Then, too, he was very, very stiff from the cold and the wetting he had received the night before. So poor Bowser made slow work of it, and Blacky the Crow almost lost patience waiting for him to appear.  As soon as Bowser came in sight, Blacky gave what was intended for a cheery caw and then headed straight for the place he had started for that morning, giving no more thought to Bowser the Hound. You see, he knew that Bowser would shortly come to a road. \"If he doesn't know enough to follow that road, he deserves to starve,\" thought Blacky.  Bowser did know enough to follow that road. The instant he saw that road, he knew that if he kept on following it, it would lead him somewhere. So with new hope in his heart, Bowser limped along.     CHAPTER IX  OLD MAN COYOTE GIVES OUT DARK HINTS      A little hint dropped there or here,     Is like a seed in spring of year;     It sprouts and grows, and none may say     How big 'twill be some future day.      _Bowser the Hound._   After leading Bowser the Hound far, far away and getting him lost in strange country, Old Man Coyote trotted back to the Old Pasture, the Green Forest, and the Green Meadows near Farmer Brown's. He didn't have any trouble at all in finding his way back. You see, all the time he was leading Bowser away, he himself was using his eyes and taking note of where he was going. You can't lose Old Man Coyote. No, Sir, you can't lose Old Man Coyote, and it is of no use to try.  So, stopping two or three times to hunt a little by the way, Old Man Coyote trotted back. He managed to pick up a good meal on the way, and when at last he reached his home in the Old Pasture he was feeling very well satisfied with the Great World in general and himself in particular.  He grinned as only Old Man Coyote can grin. \"I don't think any of us will be bothered by that meddlesome Bowser very soon again,\" said he, as he crept into his house for a nap. \"If he had drowned in that river, I shouldn't have cried over it. But even as it is, I don't think he will get back here in a hurry. I must pass the word along.\"  So a day or so later, when Sammy Jay happened along, Old Man Coyote asked him, in quite a matter-of-fact way, if he had seen anything of Bowser the Hound for a day or two.  \"Why do you ask?\" said Sammy sharply.  Old Man Coyote grinned slyly. \"For no reason at all, Sammy. For no reason at all,\" he replied. \"It just popped into my head that I hadn't heard Bowser's voice for two or three days. It set me to wondering if he is sick, or if anything has happened to him.\"  That was enough to start Sammy Jay straight for Farmer Brown's dooryard. Of course Bowser wasn't to be seen. Sammy hung around and watched. Twice he saw Farmer Brown's boy come to the door with a worried look on his face and heard him whistle and call for Bowser. Then there wasn't the slightest doubt in Sammy's mind that something had happened to Bowser.  \"Old Man Coyote knows something about it, too,\" muttered Sammy, as he turned his head on one side and scratched his pointed cap thoughtfully. \"He can't fool me. That old rascal knows where Bowser is, or what has happened to him, and I wouldn't be a bit surprised if he had something to do with it. I almost know he did from the way he grinned.\"  The day was not half over before all through the Green Forest and over the Green Meadows had spread the report that Bowser the Hound was no more.     CHAPTER X  HOW REDDY FOX INVESTIGATED      In-vest-i-gate if you would know     That something is or isn't so.      _Bowser the Hound._   To in-vest-i-gate something means to try to find out about it. Reddy Fox had heard from so many different ones about the disappearance of Bowser that he finally made up his mind that he would in-vest-i-gate and find out for himself if it were true that Bowser was no longer at home in Farmer Brown's dooryard. If it were true,--well, Reddy had certain plans of his own in regard to Farmer Brown's henhouse.  Reddy had begun by doubting that story because it seemed to have come first from Old Man Coyote. Reddy would doubt anything with which Old Man Coyote was concerned. But Reddy had finally come to believe that something certainly had happened because half a dozen times during the day he had heard Farmer Brown's boy whistle and whistle and call and call.  Just as soon as the Black Shadows came creeping out from the Purple Hills, Reddy started up towards Farmer Brown's. He didn't go directly there, because he never goes directly anywhere if there is the least chance in the world that any one may be watching him. But as he slipped along in the blackest of the Black Shadows, he was all the time working nearer and nearer to Farmer Brown's dooryard. Although he was inclined to think it was true that Bowser was not there, he was far too wise to take any unnecessary risk. He approached Farmer Brown's dooryard just as carefully as if he knew Bowser to be in his little house as usual. He kept in the Black Shadows. He crouched so low that he seemed hardly more than a Black Shadow himself. Every two or three steps he stopped to look, listen, and test the air with his keen nose.  As he drew near Bowser's own little house, Reddy circled out around it until he could see the doorway. Then he sat down where he could peek around from behind a tree and watch. He had been there only a few moments when the back door of Farmer Brown's house opened and Farmer Brown's boy stepped out. Reddy didn't run. He knew that Farmer Brown's boy would never dream that"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15170"],["title","The Child's World: Third Reader (#1)"],["body","e. After many years, however, a traveler lying under the trees heard them whispering to each other.  \"Baucis,\" whispered the oak.  \"Philemon,\" replied the linden.  There the trees stood through sun and rain, always ready to spread their leafy shade over every tired stranger who passed that way.  --FLORA J. COOKE.     THE POPLAR TREE   Long ago the poplar used to hold out its branches like other trees. It tried to see how far it could spread them.  Once at sunset an old man came through the forest where the poplar trees lived. The trees were going to sleep, and it was growing dark.  The man held something under his cloak. It was a pot of gold--the very pot of gold that lies at the foot of the rainbow. He had stolen it and was looking for some place to hide it. A poplar tree stood by the path.  \"This is the very place to hide my treasure,\" the man said. \"The branches spread out straight, and the leaves are large and thick. How lucky that the trees are all asleep!\"  He placed the pot of gold in the thick branches, and then ran quickly away.  The gold belonged to Iris, the beautiful maiden who had a rainbow bridge to the earth. The next morning she missed her precious pot. It always lay at the foot of the rainbow, but it was not there now.  Iris hurried away to tell her father, the great Zeus, of her loss. He said that he would find the pot of gold for her.  He called a messenger, the swift-footed Mercury, and said, \"Go quickly, and do not return until you have found the treasure.\"  Mercury went as fast as the wind down to the earth. He soon came to the forest and awakened the trees.  \"Iris has lost her precious pot of gold that lies at the foot of the rainbow. Have any of you seen it?\" he asked.  The trees were very sleepy, but all shook their heads.  \"We have not seen it,\" they said.  \"Hold up your branches,\" said Mercury. \"I must see that the pot of gold is not hidden among them.\"  All of the trees held up their branches. The poplar that stood by the path was the first to hold up his. He was an honest tree and knew he had nothing to hide.  [Illustration: Mercury among the trees]  Down fell the pot of gold. How surprised the poplar tree was! He dropped his branches in shame. Then he held them high in the air.  \"Forgive me,\" he said. \"I do not know how it came to be there; but, hereafter, I shall always hold my branches up. Then every one can see that I have nothing hidden.\"  Since then the branches have always grown straight up; and every one knows that the poplar is an honest and upright tree.  --FLORA J. COOKE.     WHO LOVES THE TREES BEST?     Who loves the trees best?   \"I,\" said the Spring;   \"Their leaves so beautiful   To them I bring.\"    Who loves the trees best?   \"I,\" Summer said;   \"I give them blossoms,   White, yellow, red.\"    Who loves the trees best?   \"I,\" said the Fall;   \"I give luscious fruits,   Bright tints to all.\"    Who loves the trees best?   \"I love them best,\"   Harsh Winter answered;   \"I give them rest.\"  --ALICE MAY DOUGLAS.     LEAVES IN AUTUMN     Red and gold, and gold and red,   Autumn leaves burned overhead;     Hues so splendid     Softly blended,   Oh, the glory that they shed!   Red and gold, and gold and red.    Gold and brown, and brown and gold,   Of such fun the west wind told     That they listened,     And they glistened,   As they wrestled in the cold;   Gold and brown, and brown and gold.    Brown and gold, and red and brown,   How they hurried, scurried down     For a frolic,     For a rolic,   Through the country and the town,   Brown and gold, and red and brown.     [Illustration: A bird in a tree]  A STORY OF BIRD LIFE  I   Once there came to our fields a pair of birds. They had never built a nest nor seen a winter.  Oh, how beautiful was everything! The fields were full of flowers, the grass was growing tall, and the bees were humming everywhere.  One of the birds fell to singing, and the other bird said, \"Who told you to sing?\"  He answered, \"The flowers and the bees told me. The blue sky told me, and you told me.\"  \"When did I tell you to sing?\" asked his mate.  \"Every time you brought in tender grass for the nest,\" he replied. \"Every time your soft wings fluttered off again for hair and feathers to line it.\"  Then his mate asked, \"What are you singing about?\"  \"I am singing about everything,\" he answered. \"I sing because I am happy.\"  By and by five little speckled eggs were in the nest, and the mother bird asked, \"Is there anything in all the world as pretty as my eggs?\"  A week or two afterward, the mother said, \"Oh, what do you think has happened? One of my eggs has been peeping and moving.\"  Soon another egg moved, then another, and another, till five eggs were hatched.  The little birds were so hungry that it kept the parents busy feeding them. Away they both flew. The moment the little birds heard them coming back, five yellow mouths flew open wide.  \"Can anybody be happier?\" said the father bird to the mother bird. \"We will live in this tree always. It is a tree that bears joy.\"   II   The very next day one of the birds dropped out of the nest, and in a moment a cat ate it up. Only four remained, and the parent birds were very sad. There was no song all that day, nor the next.  Soon the little birds were big enough to fly. The first bird that tried his wings flew from one branch to another. His parents praised him, and the other baby birds wondered how he had done it.  The little one was so proud of it that he tried again. He flew and flew and couldn't stop flying. At last he fell plump! down by the kitchen door. A little boy caught him and carried him into the house.  Now only three birds were left. The sun no longer seemed bright to the birds, and they did not sing so often.  In a little time the other birds learned to use their wings, and they flew away and away. They found their own food and made their own nests.  Then the old birds sat silent and looked at each other a long while. At last the mother bird asked, \"Why don't you sing?\"  \"I can't sing,\" the father bird answered. \"I only think and think!\"  \"What are you thinking of?\"  \"I am thinking how everything changes. The leaves are falling, and soon there will be no roof over our heads. The flowers are all gone. Last night there was a frost. Almost all the birds have flown away, and I am restless. Something calls me, and I feel that I must fly away, too.\"  [Illustration: Two birds flying over a field]  \"Let us fly away together!\" the mother bird said.  Then they rose silently up in the air. They looked to the north; far away they saw the snow coming. They looked to the south; there they saw green leaves.  All day they flew. All night they flew and flew, till they found a land where there was no winter. There it was summer all the time; flowers always blossomed and birds always sang.  --HENRY WARD BEECHER     BOB WHITE     There's a plump little chap in a speckled coat,   And he sits on the zigzag rails remote,   Where he whistles at breezy, bracing morn,   When the buckwheat is ripe, and stacked is the corn:   \"Bob White! Bob White! Bob White!\"    Is he hailing some comrade as blithe as he?   Now I wonder where Robert White can be!   O'er the billows of gold and amber grain   There is no one in sight--but, hark again:   \"Bob White! Bob White! Bob White!\"    Ah! I see why he calls; in the stubble there   Hide his plump little wife and babies fair!   So contented is he, and so proud of the same,   That he wants all the world to know his name:   \"Bob White! Bob White! Bob White!\"  --GEORGE COOPER.     HOW MARY GOT A NEW DRESS   Mary lived a long time ago. She was a little girl when your great-great-grandmother was a little girl.  In those days all cloth had to be made at home. Aunt Dinah, Aunt Chloe, and Aunt Dilsey were kept busy spinning and weaving to make clothes for the whole plantation.  One day Mary's mother said, \"Aunt Dilsey, Mary needs a new dress, and I want you to weave some cloth at once. Can you weave some very fine cloth?\"  \"Yes, ma'am,\" said Aunt Dilsey. \"I have some cotton I've been saving to make her a dress.\"  Aunt Dilsey got out the cards and carded the cotton smooth and fine. Then she fastened a roll of this cotton to the spindle and sent the wheel whirling around with a \"Zum-m-m-m--Zum-m-m-m!\"  Mary stood and watched the old woman.  [Illustration: Mary watching Aunt Dilsey at spinning wheel]  \"Aunt Dilsey,\" she said, \"the spinning wheel sings a song, and I know what it says. Grandmother told me. It says,    'A hum and a whirl,   A twist and a twirl,   This is for the girl   With the golden curl!   Zum-m-m-m-m-m!   Zum-m-m-m-m-m!'\"  \"And that means you, honey,\" said Aunt Dilsey.  When the yarn was ready, Aunt Dilsey fastened it in the loom and began to weave. The threads went over and under, over and under. As Aunt Dilsey wove, she hummed. Mary stood by and sang this song,    \"Over and under and over we go,   Weaving the cotton as white as the snow,   Weaving the cloth for a dress, oh, ho!   As over and under and over we go.\"  After the cloth had been woven, Aunt Dilsey took it out of the loom. Then she bleached it until it was as white as snow. Now it was ready to be made into a dress.  \"Mother, do tell me how you are going to make the dress,\" said Mary. \"Will it have ruffles on it like Sue's? Will it have trimming on it? And how many buttons will you put on it? Sue's dress has twelve; I know, for I counted them.\"  Mother did not answer all these questions; she just smiled as the scissors went snip, snip into the cloth. But she did cut out ruffles, and Aunt Maria began to hem them.  [Illustration: Mary with her mother and grandmother]  By and by grandmother came into the room.  \"Mary,\" she said, \"here is some lace I got in England. Mother may put it on your dress.\"  How happy Mary was! She danced for joy.  Mother put on the lace, and grandmother worked the buttonholes. How many do you suppose she worked? Why, she worked twelve!  When the dress was finished, it was just like "]]]
