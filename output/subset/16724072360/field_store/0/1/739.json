John feeling warm and for the first time looking about him with interest began to notice the grandeur of the rigid snow-laden pines of an untouched forest which stood in what was now brilliant sunshine.  As Leila got into the sleigh, she said, \"Now, Billy, go slowly when you make the short turn at the house. If you upset us, I--I'll kill you.\"  \"Yes, miss. Guess I'll drive all right.\" But the ways of drivers are everywhere the same, and to come to the end of a drive swiftly with crack of whip was an unresisted temptation.  \"_Sang de Dieu!_\" cried John, \"we will be upset.\"  \"We are,\" shouted Leila. The horse was down, the sleigh on its side, and the cousins disappeared in a huge drift piled high when the road was cleared.     CHAPTER II   John was the first to return to the outer world. He stood still, seeing the horse on its legs, Billy unharnessing, Leila for an instant lost to sight. The boy was scared. In his ordered life it was an unequalled experience. Then he saw a merry face above the drift and lying around it a wide-spread glory of red hair on the white snow. In after years he would recall the beauty of the laughing young face in its setting of dark gold and sunlit silver snow.  \"Oh, my!\" she cried. \"That Billy! Don't stand there, John; pull me out, I'm stuck.\"  He gave her a hand and she bounded forth out of the drift, shaking off the dry snow as a wet dog shakes off water. \"What's the matter, John?\"  He was trying to empty neck, pocket and shoes of snow, and was past the limits of what small endurance he had been taught. \"I shall catch my death of cold. It's down my back--it's everywhere, and I--shall get--laryngitis.\"  The brave blue eyes of the girl stared at his dejected figure. She was at heart a gentle, little woman-child, endowed by nature with so much of tom-boy barbarism as was good for her. Just now a feeling of contemptuous surprise overcame her kindliness and her aunt's training. \"There's your bag on the snow, and Billy will find your cap. What does a boy want with a bag? A boy--and afraid of snow!\" she cried. \"Help him with that harness.\"  He made no reply, but looked about for his lost cane. Then the young despot turned upon the driver. \"Wait till Uncle James hears; he'll come down on you.\"  \"My lands!\" said Billy, unbuckling a trace, \"I'll just say, I'm sorry; and the Squire he'll say, don't let it happen again; and I'll say, yes, sir.\"  \"Yes, until Aunt Ann hears,\" said Leila, and turned to John. His attitude of utter helplessness touched her.  \"Come into the house; you must be cold.\" She was of a sudden all tenderness.  Through an outside winter doorway-shelter they entered a hall unusually large for an American's house and warmed by two great blazing hickory wood-fires. \"Come in,\" she cried, \"you'll be all right. Sit down by the fire; I'll be down in a minute, I want to see where Aunt Ann has put you.\"  \"I am much obliged,\" said John shivering. He was alone, but wet as he was the place captured an ever active imagination. He looked about him as he stood before the roaring fire. To the right was an open library, to the left a drawing-room rarely used, the hall being by choice the favoured sitting-room. The dining-room was built out from the back of the hall, whence up a broad stairway Leila had gone. The walls were hung with Indian painted robes, Sioux and Arapahoe weapons, old colonial rifles, and among them portraits of three generations of Penhallows. Many older people had found interesting the strange adornment of the walls, where amid antlered trophies of game, buffalo heads and war-worn Indian relics, could be read something of the owner's tastes and history. John stood by the fire fascinated. Like many timid boys, he liked books of adventure and to imagine himself heroic in situations of peril.  \"It's all right. Come up,\" cried Leila from the stair. \"Your trunk's there now. There's a fine fire.\"  Forgetful of the cold ride and of the snow down his back, he was standing before the feathered head-dress of a Sioux Chief and touching the tomahawk below it. He turned as she spoke. \"Those must be scalp-locks--three.\" He saw the prairie, the wild pursuit--saw them as she could not. He went after her upstairs, the girl talking, the boy rapt, lost in far-away battles on the plains.  \"This is your room. See what a nice fire. You can dry yourself. Your trunk is here already.\" She lighted two candles. \"We dine at half-past six.\"  \"Thank you; I am very much obliged,\" he said, thinking what a mannerless girl.  Leila closed the door and stood still a moment. Then she exclaimed, \"Well, I never! What will Uncle Jim say?\" She listened a moment. No one was in the hall. Then she laughed, and getting astride of the banister-rail made a wild, swift and perilous descent, alighting at the foot in the hall, and readjusting her short skirts as she heard her aunt and uncle on the porch. \"I was just in time,\" she exclaimed. \"Wouldn't I have caught it!\"  The Squire, as the village called him, would have applauded this form of coasting, but Aunt Ann had other views. \"Well!\" he said as they came in, \"what have you done with your young man?\"  Now he was for Leila anything but a man or manly, but she was a loyal little lady and unwilling to expose the guest to Uncle Jim's laughter. \"He's all right,\" she said, \"but Billy upset the sleigh.\" She was longing to tell about that ball in the stable, but refrained.  \"So Billy upset you; and John, where is he?\"  \"He's upstairs getting dried.\"  \"It is rather a rough welcome,\" remarked her aunt.  \"He lost his cap and his cane,\" said Leila.  \"His cane!\" exclaimed her uncle, \"his cane!\"  \"I must see him,\" said his wife.  \"Better let him alone, Ann.\" But as usual she took her own way and went upstairs. She came down in a few minutes, finding her husband standing before the fire--an erect, soldierly figure close to forty years of age.  \"Well, Ann?\" he queried.  \"A very nice lad, with such good manners, James.\"  \"Billy found his cap,\" said Leila, \"but he couldn't get the sleigh set up until the stable men came.\"  \"And that cane,\" laughed Penhallow. \"Was the boy amused or--or scared?\"  \"I don't know,\" which was hardly true, but the chivalry of childhood forbade tale-telling and he learned very little. \"He was rather tired and cold, so I made him go to his room and rest.\"  \"Poor child!\" said Aunt Ann.  James Penhallow looked at Leila. Some manner of signals were interchanged. \"I saw Billy digging in the big drift,\" he said. \"I trust he found the young gentleman's cane.\" Some pitying, dim comprehension of the delicately nurtured lad had brought to the social surface the kindliness of the girl and she said no more.  \"It is time to dress for dinner,\" said Ann. Away from the usages of the city she had wisely insisted on keeping up the social forms which the Squire would at times have been glad to disregard. For a moment Ann Penhallow lingered. \"We must try to make him feel at home, James.\"  \"Of course, my dear. I can imagine how Susan Penhallow would have educated a boy, and now I know quite too well what we shall have to undo--and--do.\"  \"You won't, oh! you will not be too hard on him.\"  \"I--no, my dear--but--I suspect his American education has begun already.\"  \"What do you mean?\"  \"Ask Leila--and Billy. But that can wait.\" They separated.  While his elders were thus briefly discussing this new addition to the responsibilities of their busy lives, the subject of their talk had been warmed into comfortable repossession of his self-esteem. He set in order his elaborate silver toilet things marked with the Penhallow crest, saw in the glass that his dress and unboylike length of curly hair were as he had been taught they should be; then he looked at his watch and went slowly downstairs.  \"Halloa! John,\" he heard as he reached the last turn of the stairs. \"Most glad to see you. You are very welcome to your new home.\" The man who hailed him was six feet two inches, deep-chested, erect--the West Point figure; the face clean-shaven, ruddy, hazel-eyed, was radiant with the honest feeling of desire to put this childlike boy at ease.  The little gentleman needed no aid and replied, \"My dear uncle, I cannot sufficiently thank you.\" A little bow went with his words, and he placidly accepted his aunt's embrace, while the hearty Miss Leila looked on in silence. The boy's black suit, the short jacket, the neat black tie, made the paleness of his thin large-featured face too obvious. Then Leila took note of the court shoes and silk socks, and looked at Uncle Jim to see what he thought. The Squire reserved what criticism he may have had and asked cheerfully about the journey, Aunt Ann aiding him with eager will to make the boy feel at home. He was quite enough at home. It was all agreeable, these handsome relations and the other Penhallows on the walls. He had been taught that which is good or ill as men use it, pride of race, and in his capacity to be impressed by his surroundings was years older than Leila. He felt sure that he would like it here at Grey Pine, but was surprised to see no butler and to be waited on at dinner by two neat little maids.  When Ann Penhallow asked him about his schools and his life in Europe, he became critical, and conversed about picture-galleries and foreign life with no lack of accuracy, while the Squire listened smiling and Leila sat dumb with astonishment as the dinner went on. He ate little and kept in mind the endless lessons in regard to what he should or should not eat. Meanwhile, he silently approved of the old silver and these well-bred kinsfolk, with a reserve of doubt concerning his silent cousin.  His uncle had at last his one glass of Madeira, and as they rose his aunt said, \"You may be tired, John; you ought to go to bed early.\"  \"It is not yet time,\" he said. \"I always retire at ten o'clock.\"  \"He 'retires,'\" murmured his uncle. \"Come, Ann, we will leave Leila to make friends"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14154"],["title","The Tale of Terror: A Study of the Gothic Romance (#1)"],["body","dogs, they cowered by the walls.\"[1]  Another episode in the same epic, when Nergal, the god of the dead, brings before Gilgamesh an apparition of his friend, Eabani, recalls the impressive scene, when the witch of Endor summons the spirit of Samuel before Saul.  When legends began to grow up round the names of traditional heroes, fierce encounters with giants and monsters were invented to glorify their strength and prowess. David, with a stone from his sling, slew Goliath. The crafty Ulysses put out the eye of Polyphemus. Grettir, according to the Icelandic saga, overcame Glam, the malevolent, death-dealing vampire who \"went riding the roofs.\" Beowulf fearlessly descended into the turbid mere to grapple with Grendel's mother. Folktales and ballads, in which incidents similar to those in myths and heroic legends occur, are often overshadowed by terror. Figures like the Demon Lover, who bears off his mistress in the fatal craft and sinks her in the sea, and the cannibal bridegroom, outwitted at last by the artfulness of one of his brides, appear in the folk-lore of many lands. Through every century there glide uneasy spirits, groaning for vengeance. Andrew Lang[2] mentions the existence of a papyrus fragment, found attached to a wooden statuette, in which an ancient Egyptian scribe addresses a letter to the Khou, or spirit, of his dead wife, beseeching her not to haunt him. One of the ancestors of the savage were-wolf, who figures in Marryat's _Phantom Ship_, may perhaps be discovered in Petronius' _Supper of Trimalchio_. The descent of Bram Stoker's infamous vampire Dracula may be traced back through centuries of legend. Hobgoblins, demons, and witches mingle grotesquely with the throng of beautiful princesses, queens in glittering raiment, fairies and elves. Without these ugly figures, folk-tales would soon lose their power to charm. All tale tellers know that fear is a potent spell. The curiosity which drove Bluebeard's wife to explore the hidden chamber lures us on to know the worst, and as we listen to horrid stories, we snatch a fearful joy. Human nature desires not only to be amused and entertained, but moved to pity and fear. All can sympathise with the youth, who could not shudder and who would fain acquire the gift.  From English literature we gain no more than brief, tantalising glimpses of the vast treasury of folk-tales and ballads that existed before literature became an art and that lived on side by side with it, vitalising and enriching it continually. Yet here and there we catch sudden gleams like the fragment in _King Lear_:    \"Childe Roland to the dark tower came.   His word was still Fie, Foh and Fum,   I smell the blood of a British man.\"  or Benedick's quotation from the _Robber Bridegroom_:    \"It is not so, it was not so, but, indeed, God forbid that   it should be so.\"  which hint at the existence of a hoard as precious and inexhaustible as that of the Nibelungs. The chord of terror is touched in the eerie visit of the three dead sailor sons \"in earthly flesh and blood\" to the wife of Usher's well, Sweet William's Ghost, the rescue of Tarn Lin on Halloween, when Fairyland pays a tiend to Hell, the return of clerk Saunders to his mistress, True Thomas's ride to Fairyland, when:    \"For forty days and forty nights,   He wade through red blood to the knee,   And he saw neither sun nor moon,   But heard the roaring of the sea.\"  The mediaeval romances of chivalry, which embody stories handed down by oral tradition, are set in an atmosphere of supernatural wonder and enchantment. In Malory's _Morte d'Arthur_, Sir Lancelot goes by night into the Chapel Perilous, wherein there is only a dim light burning, and steals from the corpse a sword and a piece of silk to heal the wounds of a dying knight. Sir Galahad sees a fiend leap out of a tomb amid a cloud of smoke; Gawaine's ghost, with those of the knights and ladies for whom he has done battle in life, appears to warn the king not to begin the fight against Modred on a certain day. In the romance of _Sir Amadas_, the ghost of a merchant, whose corpse the knight had duteously redeemed from the hands of creditors, succours him at need. The shadow of terror lurks even amid the beauty of Spenser's fairyland. In the windings of its forests we come upon dark caves, mysterious castles and huts, from which there start fearsome creatures like Despair or the giant Orgoglio, hideous hags like Occasion, wicked witches and enchanters or frightful beings like the ghostly Maleger, who wore as his helmet a dead man's skull and rode upon a tiger swift as the wind. The Elizabethan dramatists were fascinated by the terrors of the invisible world. Marlowe's Dr. Faustus, round whose name are clustered legends centuries old concerning bargains between man and the devil, the apparitions and witches in _Macbeth_, the dead hand, the corpse-like images, the masque of madmen, the tombmaker and the passing-bell in Webster's sombre tragedy, _The Duchess of Malfi_, prove triumphantly the dramatic possibilities of terror. As a foil to his _Masque of Queens_ (1609) Ben Jonson introduced twelve loathly witches with Até as their leader, and embellished his description of their profane rites, with details culled from James I.'s treatise on Demonology and from learned ancient authorities.  In _The Pilgrim's Progress_, Despair, who \"had as many lives as a cat,\" his wife Diffidence at Doubting Castle, and Maul and Slaygood are the ogres of popular story, whose acquaintance Bunyan had made in chapbooks during his ungodly youth. Hobgoblins, devils and fiends, \"sturdy rogues\" like the three brothers Faintheart, Mistrust and Guilt, who set upon Littlefaith in Dead Man's Lane, lend the excitement of terror to Christian's journey to the Celestial City. The widespread belief in witches and spirits to which Browne and Burton and many others bear witness in the seventeenth century, lived on in the eighteenth century, although the attitude of the \"polite\" in the age of reason was ostensibly incredulous and superior. A scene in one of the _Spectator_ essays illustrates pleasantly the state of popular opinion. Addison, lodging with a good-natured widow in London, returns home one day to find a group of girls sitting by candlelight, telling one another ghost-stories. At his entry they are abashed, but, on the widow's assuring them that it is only the \"gentleman,\" they resume, while Addison, pretending to be absorbed in his book at the far end of the table, covertly listens to their tales of       \"ghosts that, pale as ashes, had stood at the feet of      the bed or walked over a churchyard by moonlight; and      others, who had been conjured into the Red Sea for      disturbing people's rest.\"[3]  In another essay Addison shows that he is strongly inclined to believe in the existence of spirits, though he repudiates the ridiculous superstitions which prevailed in his day;[4] and Sir Roger de Coverley frankly confesses his belief in witches. Defoe, in the preface to his _Essay on the History and Reality of Apparitions_ (1727) states uncompromisingly:       \"I must tell you, good people, he that is not able to      see the devil, in whatever shape he is pleased to      appear in, he is not really qualified to live in this      world, no, not in the quality of a common inhabitant.\"  Epworth Rectory, the home of John Wesley's father, was haunted in 1716-17 by a persevering ghost called Old Jeffrey, whose exploits are recorded with a gravity and circumstantial exactitude that remind us of Defoe's narrative concerning the ghostly Mrs. Veal in her \"scoured\" silk. John Wesley declares stoutly that he is convinced of the literal truth of the story of one Elizabeth Hobson, who professed to have been visited on several occasions by supernatural beings. He upholds too the authenticity of the notorious Drummer of Tedworth, whose escapades are described in chapbooks and in Glanvill's _Sadducismus Triumphatus_ (1666), a book in which he was keenly interested. In his journal (May 25th, 1768) he remarks:       \"It is true that the English in general, and indeed      most of the men of learning in Europe, have given up      all accounts of witches and apparitions, as mere old      wives' fables. I am sorry for it; and I willingly take      this opportunity of entering my solemn protest against      this violent compliment which so many that believe the      Bible pay to those who do not believe it.\"  The Cock Lane ghost gained very general credit, and was considered by Mrs. Nickleby a personage of some importance, when she boasted to Miss La Creevy that her great-grandfather went to school with him--or her grandmother with the Thirsty Woman of Tutbury. The appearance of Lord Lyttleton's ghost in 1779 was described by Dr. Johnson, who was also disposed to believe in the Cock Lane ghost, as the most extraordinary thing that had happened in his day.[5] There is abundant evidence that the people of the eighteenth century were extremely credulous, yet, in literature, there is a tendency to look askance at the supernatural as at something wild and barbaric. Such ghosts as presume to steal into poetry are amazingly tame, and even elegant, in their speech and deportment. In Mallet's _William and Margaret_ (1759). which was founded on a scrap of an old ballad out of _The Knight of the Burning Pestle_, Margaret's wraith rebukes her false lover in a long and dignified oration. But spirits were shy of appearing in an age when they were more likely to be received with banter than with dread. Dr. Johnson expresses the attitude of his age when, in referring to Gray's poem, _The Bard_, he remarks:       \"To select a singular event and swell it to a giant's      bulk by fabulous appendages of spectres and predictions      has little difficulty, for he that forsakes the      probable may always find the marvellous. And it has      little use; we are affected only as we believe; we are      improved only as we find"]]]
