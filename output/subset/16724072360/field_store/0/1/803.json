And did not even the dumb beast profit more by your instruction than the man who rode him? And who was it,\" he continued, turning to Uriel, \"that was called the wisest of all men, having searched out and understood the many inventions that are found under the sun? Was not Solomon, prince of fools and philosophers, unable by much learning to escape weariness of the flesh and despair of the spirit? Knowledge also is vanity and vexation. This I know well, because I have dwelt among men and held converse with them since the day when I was sent to instruct the first man in Eden.\"  Then I looked more closely at him who was speaking and recognised the beauty of the archangel Raphael, as it was pictured long ago:    \"A seraph winged; six wings he wore to shade   His lineaments divine; the pair that clad   Each shoulder broad came mantling o'er his breast,   With regal ornament; the middle pair   Girt like a starry zone his waist, and round   Skirted his loins and thighs with downy gold   And colours dipped in Heav'n; the third his feet   Shadowed from either heel with feathered mail,   Sky-tinctured grain. Like Maia's son he stood   And shook his plumes, that Heavenly fragrance filled   The circuit wide.\"  \"Too well I know,\" he spoke on, while the smile on his face deepened into a look of pity and tenderness and desire, \"too well I know that power corrupts itself and that knowledge cannot save. There is no cure for the evil that is in the world but by the giving of more love to men. The laws that are ordained for earth are strange and unequal, and the ways where men must walk are full of pitfalls and dangers. Pestilence creeps along the ground and flows in the rivers; whirlwind and tempest shake the habitations of men and drive their ships to destruction; fire breaks forth from the mountains and the foundations of the world tremble. Frail is the flesh of man, and many are his pains and troubles. His children can never find peace until they learn to love one another and to help one another.  \"Wickedness is begotten by disease and misery. Violence comes from poverty and hunger. The cruelty of oppression is when the strong tread the weak under their feet; the bitterness of pride is when the wise and learned despise the simple; the crown of folly is when the rich think they are gods, and the poor think that God is not.  \"Hatred and envy and contempt are the curse of life. And for these there is no remedy save love--the will to give and to bless--the will of the King himself, who gives to all and is loving unto every man. But how shall the hearts of men be won to this will? How shall it enter into them and possess them? Even the gods that men fashion for themselves are cruel and proud and false and unjust. How shall the miracle be wrought in human nature to reveal the meaning of humanity? How shall men be made like God?\"  At this question a deep hush fell around the circle, and every listener was still, even as the rustling leaves hang motionless when the light breeze falls away in the hour of sunset. Then through the silence, like the song of a far-away thrush from its hermitage in the forest, a voice came ringing: \"I know it, I know it, I know it.\"  Clear and sweet--clear as a ray of light, sweeter than the smallest silver bell that rang the hour of rest--was that slender voice floating on the odorous and translucent air. Nearer and nearer it came, echoing down the valley, \"I know it, I know it, I know it!\"  Then from between the rounded hills, among which the brook of Brighthopes is born, appeared a young angel, a little child, with flying hair of gold, and green wreaths twined about his shoulders, and fluttering hands that played upon the air and seemed to lift him so lightly that he had no need of wings. As thistle-down, blown by the wind, dances across the water, so he came along the little stream, singing clear above the murmur of the brook.  All the angels rose and turned to look at him with wondering eyes. Multitudes of others came flying swiftly to the place from which the strange, new song was sounding. Rank within rank, like a garden of living flowers, they stood along the sloping banks of the brook while the child-angel floated into the midst of them, singing:  \"I know it, I know it, I know it! Man shall be made like God because the Son of God shall become a man.\"  At this all the angels looked at one another with amazement, and gathered more closely about the child-angel, as those who hear wonderful news.  \"How can this be?\" they asked. \"How is it possible that the Son of God should be a man?\"  \"I do not know,\" said the young angel. \"I only know that it is to be.\"  \"But if he becomes a man,\" said Raphael, \"he will be at the mercy of men; the cruel and the wicked will have power upon him; he will suffer.\"  \"I know it,\" answered the young angel, \"and by suffering he will understand the meaning of all sorrow and pain; and he will be able to comfort every one who cries; and his own tears will be for the healing of sad hearts; and those who are healed by him will learn for his sake to be kind to each other.\"  \"But if the Son of God is a true man,\" said Uriel, \"he must first be a child, simple, and lowly, and helpless. It may be that he will never gain the learning of the schools. The masters of earthly wisdom will despise him and speak scorn of him.\"  \"I know it,\" said the young angel, \"but in meekness will he answer them; and to those who become as little children he will give the heavenly wisdom that comes, without seeking, to the pure and gentle of heart.\"  \"But if he becomes a man,\" said Michael, \"evil men will hate and persecute him: they may even take his life, if they are stronger than he.\"  \"I know it,\" answered the young angel, \"they will nail him to a cross. But when he is lifted up, he will draw all men unto him, for he will still be the Son of God, and no heart that is open to love can help loving him, since his love for men is so great that he is willing to die for them.\"  \"But how do you know these things?\" cried the other angels. \"Who are you?\"  \"I am the Christmas angel,\" he said. \"At first I was sent as the dream of a little child, a holy child, blessed and wonderful, to dwell in the heart of a pure virgin, Mary of Nazareth. There I was hidden till the word came to call me back to the throne of the King, and tell me my name, and give me my new message. For this is Christmas day on Earth, and to-day the Son of God is born of a woman. So I must fly quickly, before the sun rises, to bring the good news to those happy men who have been chosen to receive them.\"  As he said this, the young angel rose, with arms outspread, from the green meadow of Peacefield and, passing over the bounds of Heaven, dropped swiftly as a shooting-star toward the night shadow of the Earth. The other angels followed him--a throng of dazzling forms, beautiful as a rain of jewels falling from the dark-blue sky. But the child-angel went more swiftly than the others, because of the certainty of gladness in his heart.  And as the others followed him they wondered who had been favoured and chosen to receive the glad tidings.  \"It must be the Emperor of the World and his counsellors,\" they thought. But the flight passed over Rome.  \"It may be the philosophers and the masters of learning,\" they thought. But the flight passed over Athens.  \"Can it be the High Priest of the Jews, and the elders and the scribes?\" they thought. But the flight passed over Jerusalem.  It floated out over the hill country of Bethlehem; the throng of silent angels holding close together, as if perplexed and doubtful; the child-angel darting on far in advance, as one who knew the way through the darkness.  The villages were all still: the very houses seemed asleep; but in one place there was a low sound of talking in a stable, near to an inn--a sound as of a mother soothing her baby to rest.  All over the pastures on the hillsides a light film of snow had fallen, delicate as the veil of a bride adorned for the marriage; and as the child-angel passed over them, alone in the swiftness of his flight, the pure fields sparkled round him, giving back his radiance.  And there were in that country shepherds abiding in the fields, keeping watch over their flocks by night. And lo! the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them, and they were sore afraid. And the angel said unto them: \"Fear not; for behold I bring you glad tidings of great joy which shall be to all nations. For unto you is born this day, in the city of David, a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord. And this shall be a sign unto you; ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.\"  And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host, praising God and saying: \"Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good-will toward men.\" And the shepherds said one to another: \"Let us now go, even to Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass.\"  So I said within myself that I also would go with the shepherds, even to Bethlehem. And I heard a great and sweet voice, as of a bell, which said, \"Come!\" And when the bell had sounded twelve times, I awoke; and it was Christmas morn; and I knew that I had been in a dream.  Yet it seemed to me that the things which I had heard were true.         *       *       *       *       *     A LITTLE ESSAY     CHRISTMAS-GIVING AND CHRISTMAS-LIVING  I   The custom of exchanging presents on a certain day in the year is very much older than Christmas, and means very much less. It has obtained in almost all ages of the world, and among many different nations. It is a fine thing or a foolish thing, as the case may be; an encouragement to friendliness, or a tribute to fashion; an expression of good nature, or a bid for favour; an outgoing of generosity, or a disguise of greed; a cheerful old custom, or a futile old farce, according to the spirit which animates it and the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14572"],["title","The Spirit of Christmas (#2)"],["body"," which it takes.  But when this ancient and variously interpreted tradition of a day of gifts was transferred to the Christmas season, it was brought into vital contact with an idea which must transform it, and with an example which must lift it up to a higher plane. The example is the life of Jesus. The idea is unselfish interest in the happiness of others.  The great gift of Jesus to the world was himself. He lived with and for men. He kept back nothing. In every particular and personal gift that he made to certain people there was something of himself that made it precious.  For example, at the wedding in Cana of Galilee, it was his thought for the feelings of the giver of the feast, and his wish that every guest should find due entertainment, that lent the flavour of a heavenly hospitality to the wine which he provided.  When he gave bread and fish to the hungry multitude who had followed him out among the hills by the Lake of Gennesaret, the people were refreshed and strengthened by the sense of the personal care of Jesus for their welfare, as much as by the food which he bestowed upon them. It was another illustration of the sweetness of \"a dinner of herbs, where love is.\"  The gifts of healing which he conferred upon many different kinds of sufferers were, in every case, evidences that Jesus was willing to give something of himself, his thought, his sympathy, his vital power, to the men and women among whom he lived. Once, when a paralytic was brought to Jesus on a bed, he surprised everybody, and offended many, by giving the poor wretch the pardon of his sins, before he gave new life to his body. That was just because Jesus thought before he gave; because he desired to satisfy the deepest need; because in fact he gave something of himself in every gift. All true Christmas-giving ought to be after this pattern.  Not that it must all be solemn and serious. For the most part it deals with little wants, little joys, little tokens of friendly feeling. But the feeling must be more than the token; else the gift does not really belong to Christmas.  It takes time and effort and unselfish expenditure of strength to make gifts in this way. But it is the only way that fits the season.  The finest Christmas gift is not the one that costs the most money, but the one that carries the most love.   II  But how seldom Christmas comes--only once a year; and how soon it is over--a night and a day! If that is the whole of it, it seems not much more durable than the little toys that one buys of a fakir on the street-corner. They run for an hour, and then the spring breaks, and the legs come off, and nothing remains but a contribution to the dust heap.  But surely that need not and ought not to be the whole of Christmas--only a single day of generosity, ransomed from the dull servitude of a selfish year,--only a single night of merry-making, celebrated in the slave-quarters of a selfish race! If every gift is the token of a personal thought, a friendly feeling, an unselfish interest in the joy of others, then the thought, the feeling, the interest, may remain after the gift is made.  The little present, or the rare and long-wished-for gift (it matters not whether the vessel be of gold, or silver, or iron, or wood, or clay, or just a small bit of birch bark folded into a cup), may carry a message something like this:  \"I am thinking of you to-day, because it is Christmas, and I wish you happiness. And to-morrow, because it will be the day after Christmas, I shall still wish you happiness; and so on, clear through the year. I may not be able to tell you about it every day, because I may be far away; or because both of us may be very busy; or perhaps because I cannot even afford to pay the postage on so many letters, or find the time to write them. But that makes no difference. The thought and the wish will be here just the same. In my work and in the business of life, I mean to try not to be unfair to you or injure you in any way. In my pleasure, if we can be together, I would like to share the fun with you. Whatever joy or success comes to you will make me glad. Without pretense, and in plain words, good-will to you is what I mean, in the Spirit of Christmas.\"  It is not necessary to put a message like this into high-flown language, to swear absolute devotion and deathless consecration. In love and friendship, small, steady payments on a gold basis are better than immense promissory notes. Nor, indeed, is it always necessary to put the message into words at all, nor even to convey it by a tangible token. To feel it and to act it out--that is the main thing.  There are a great many people in the world whom we know more or less, but to whom for various reasons we cannot very well send a Christmas gift. But there is hardly one, in all the circles of our acquaintance, with whom we may not exchange the touch of Christmas life.  In the outer circles, cheerful greetings, courtesy, consideration; in the inner circles, sympathetic interest, hearty congratulations, honest encouragement; in the inmost circle, comradeship, helpfulness, tenderness,--    \"_Beautiful friendship tried by sun and wind   Durable from the daily dust of life._\"  After all, Christmas-living is the best kind of Christmas-giving.         *       *       *       *       *     A SHORT CHRISTMAS SERMON     KEEPING CHRISTMAS      ROMANS, xiv, 6: _He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto     the Lord._  It is a good thing to observe Christmas day. The mere marking of times and seasons, when men agree to stop work and make merry together, is a wise and wholesome custom. It helps one to feel the supremacy of the common life over the individual life. It reminds a man to set his own little watch, now and then, by the great clock of humanity which runs on sun time.  But there is a better thing than the observance of Christmas day, and that is, keeping Christmas.  Are you willing to forget what you have done for other people, and to remember what other people have done for you; to ignore what the world owes you, and to think what you owe the world; to put your rights in the background, and your duties in the middle distance, and your chances to do a little more than your duty in the foreground; to see that your fellow-men are just as real as you are, and try to look behind their faces to their hearts, hungry for joy; to own that probably the only good reason for your existence is not what you are going to get out of life, but what you are going to give to life; to close your book of complaints against the management of the universe, and look around you for a place where you can sow a few seeds of happiness--are you willing to do these things even for a day? Then you can keep Christmas.  Are you willing to stoop down and consider the needs and the desires of little children; to remember the weakness and loneliness of people who are growing old; to stop asking how much your friends love you, and ask yourself whether you love them enough; to bear in mind the things that other people have to bear on their hearts; to try to understand what those who live in the same house with you really want, without waiting for them to tell you; to trim your lamp so that it will give more light and less smoke, and to carry it in front so that your shadow will fall behind you; to make a grave for your ugly thoughts, and a garden for your kindly feelings, with the gate open--are you willing to do these things even for a day? Then you can keep Christmas.  Are you willing to believe that love is the strongest thing in the world--stronger than hate, stronger than evil, stronger than death--and that the blessed life which began in Bethlehem nineteen hundred years ago is the image and brightness of the Eternal Love? Then you can keep Christmas.  And if you keep it for a day, why not always?  But you can never keep it alone.         *       *       *       *       *     TWO CHRISTMAS PRAYERS     A CHRISTMAS PRAYER FOR THE HOME     Father of all men, look upon our family,   Kneeling together before Thee,   And grant us a true Christmas.    With loving heart we bless Thee:     For the gift of Thy dear Son Jesus Christ,     For the peace He brings to human homes,     For the good-will He teaches to sinful men,     For the glory of Thy goodness shining in His face.    With joyful voice we praise Thee:     For His lowly birth and His rest in the manger,     For the pure tenderness of His mother Mary,     For the fatherly care that protected Him,     For the Providence that saved the Holy Child       To be the Saviour of the world.    With deep desire we beseech Thee:     Help us to keep His birthday truly,     Help us to offer, in His name, our Christmas prayer.    From the sickness of sin and the darkness of doubt,   From selfish pleasures and sullen pains,   From the frost of pride and the fever of envy,     God save us every one, through the blessing of Jesus.    In the health of purity and the calm of mutual trust,   In the sharing of joy and the bearing of trouble,   In the steady glow of love and the clear light of hope,     God keep us every one, by the blessing of Jesus.    In praying and praising, in giving and receiving,   In eating and drinking, in singing and making merry,   In parents' gladness and in children's mirth,   In dear memories of those who have departed,   In good comradeship with those who are here,   In kind wishes for those who are far away,   In patient waiting, sweet contentment, generous cheer,     God bless us every one, with the blessing of Jesus.    By remembering our kinship with all men,   By well-wishing, friendly speaking and kindly doing,   By cheering the downcast and adding sunshine to daylight,   By welcoming strangers (poor shepherds or wise men),   By keeping the music of the angels' song in this home,     God help us every one to share the blessing of Jesus:   In whose name we keep Christmas:   And in whose words we pray together:    _Our Father which art in "]]]
