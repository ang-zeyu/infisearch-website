Is that where you wear the Saviour's cross?  MEMORY VERSE, _I Corinthians_ 1: 18      \"For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish     foolishness; but unto them which are saved it is the power of     God.\"  MEMORY HYMN [143]      _\"In the cross of Christ I glory.\"_     EASTER LIGHT   This glad morning, when the world is so bright and beautiful, I want to talk to you about Easter Light.  One of the most interesting men in our city is a man who goes about our streets with two long sticks. He is the lamplighter. Here he comes down the street! See how he pauses at each lamp post. With one stick he pulls the little chain that turns on the gas; with the other he sets the light going. He walks into the dark, but he leaves behind him miles of lighted streets. I hope we shall have always many streets lighted with gas, for I love to see the lamplighter dot his way along the streets and avenues with lighted periods.  In the center of our city is the tall Electric Light Building. On the very tip of the tower is a high power electric light. It is lighted every evening from eight to eleven o'clock. Children, looking out of their windows as they go to bed, think that it is another star in the sky, it is so bright and steady.  More wonderful than any of these lights is the source of all light. It is the light that God provides for all of his children. The sun warms our fields, makes our gardens grow, and causes our harvests to prosper. The sun never fails us.  Now there is another light, a light that is above even the sun. That is the light of Easter day. The tomb of death is no longer dark, for the resurrection light brightens every corner and shines in radiance through the open doorway. The light of Easter also lights up the windows of our heavenly home. When you are out of an evening it is not pleasant to return to a dark house. There is a wondrous welcome in lighted windows. That welcome God gives us in the light of Easter day. Christ, and his resurrection, shine in the windows of heaven to greet us when we go home.  MEMORY VERSE, _Matthew_ 28: 1      \"In the end of the Sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first     day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the     sepulchre.\"  MEMORY HYMN [156]      _\"Christ the Lord is risen to-day.\"_     APRIL   I have in my hand a small branch from a big tree. This branch is from an apple tree. Here are seen the tiny buds, the promise of the blossom, and after that the fruit. Have you ever seen an apple orchard in blossom? People rave about the cherry blossoms of Japan, and the fire trees, flaming red, of the Philippines. I have been in both countries, but I think there is no more beautiful sight in any country than the blossoming apple orchards of America.  As you came to church this morning you saw all along the streets and avenues hundreds of trees like this branch, sending forth their first buds. What do these buds tell us?  First of all they tell us of God. I do not see how any one can live through the awakening spring season and not think daily thoughts of God. Most people remember the Creator. Only one person has ever denied God. \"The fool hath said in his heart, there is no God.\" He said it to himself, he did not dare speak it out loud.  In the second place, this branch tells us of God's Love. He, the loving Father of all people, makes blessed provision for the care and nurture of his children. He reminds us each year, in seedtime and harvest, of his boundless love. His love never fails. There have been many hundreds of years in the history of the world, yet each year has had its spring, its seedtime, and its Resurrection. Young people, let God's April speak to you.      \"When I am gone, somehow I hope that April     Will typify my life, my faith,     My hope of victory through the years,     My steadiness of step, my clear and visioned eye.     The early flowers, the birds     Singing in the rain,     The increasing light, the slowly opening buds,     The almond blooms, the trees in vernal dress     Are like the silver crown upon the head;     A prophecy of heaven's summer time.     Yes, even now it is the April     Of my great immortality.\"  MEMORY VERSE, _John_ 11: 25      \"Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life.\"  MEMORY HYMN [389]      _\"Sow in the morn thy seed.\"_     HELPING FINGERS   For three years I lived in Manila, Philippine Islands. Not far from my home was an orphanage for children who were deaf and dumb. Frequently these children were seen at different entertainments that were given about the city. One evening I went to attend a lecture in the Y.M.C.A. Right in front of me sat three children. They were very quiet and orderly. When the lecture began the boy who sat in the middle began to make his fingers go as fast as he could, the two children on either side watching him intently. That center boy could hear, the other two were deaf. So he heard the lecture for them and told it to them by the finger language.  One day a girl, coming out from school, got on a street car to go to her home. The car was crowded. She found a seat next to a woman who was heavily laden with bundles. She had all she could do to hold those bundles in her lap and keep them from falling and scattering their contents on the floor. Then a string about one of the packages became untied. She struggled to get that string fastened securely. She had so many packages, her fingers were numb with cold, and again and again the string slipped just at the crucial time. Finally this school girl, who was an attractive, well-dressed girl, reached over and placed her nicely gloved finger on the obstreperous knot. There was a grateful smile from the troubled woman and a hearty \"Thank you.\" The next stop was the girl's home. As she went to the end of the car she passed a school friend who had watched the little incident. She said to her, \"I see you belong to the helping hand society.\" \"No,\" replied the girl, \"not the helping hand, just the helping finger society.\" This is a great society, girls and boys. Admission to it requires no initiation fee, no dues, simply the desire and the will to be helpful wherever you are.  MEMORY VERSE, _Ecclesiastes_ 9: 10      \"Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might.\"  MEMORY HYMN [349]      _\"Saviour, thy dying love thou gavest me.\"_     TWO R'S AND AN A   Do you know what week this is? We have all sorts of weeks, don't we! There is Sunday School week, Go to Church week, Boy Scout week, Red Cross week, Social Welfare week, Hospital week, Y.W.C.A. and Y.M.C.A. week. Sometimes we wish we could have one week all to ourselves.  Well, this is a special week. It is called Good Literature week. I want to tell you about Good Literature week by the use of these three letters, two R's and an A.  The first R stands for Read. By all means read. There is no excuse for not reading, there is so much to read. Indeed I think that is the chief difficulty, we have too much, at least too much of that which is not good to read. Here's the bulky daily paper. When it is delivered there is a rush for it. The children want the comic supplement. So do some of the grownups.      \"A little nonsense now and then,     Is relished by the wisest men.\"  That is true, and all right, but read something beside the comics.  The second R is Remember. You cannot remember all that you read. You can remember much. You should train your mind to remember the best. John Ruskin, one of the most gifted of Englishmen, said, \"To this I owe all that I have of power, to the fact that when I was a boy my mother made me learn, every day, and remember, a verse of the Bible.\"  Now the A. The A stands for, can you guess? It means Action. Read, remember what you read, and then apply it, put it into action. It is a fine thing to read a story like Pollyanna and get all excited over it. It is much finer to read Pollyanna and then put her spirit into action in the daily life of the home.  MEMORY VERSE, _Psalm_ 119: 11      \"Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might; not sin against     thee.\"  MEMORY HYMN [201]      _\"How precious is the book divine!\"_     CANDLE CHILDREN   What is this I have here? It is a candle in a candlestick. There is something about a candle we all love. We have our clear gas lights and our still more brilliant electric bulbs, but when the birthday comes we want a cake with candles on it. Think of this as a birthday candle and let it speak to you.  First of all this candle speaks of Symmetry. How perfectly formed is this candle! It is smooth, there are no rough places that stand out like an ugly wart on one's face. Your life should have symmetry. God asks you to give heed to your physical, your mental and your spiritual duties that your life may be well rounded, a life of beautiful symmetry.  Second, this candle stands for Fragrance. This is a fragrant candle. It is what is known as a \"barberry\" candle. There are some children we do not like to have around, they are surly, sulky and mean. There are others we dear love to have with us at all times. They have what I call fragrance. They have the fragrance of thoughtfulness, the sweetness of unselfishness.  In the third place this candle means Erectness. How straight it stands in the candlestick! Stand up straight, girls and boys. Do not stoop. Do not hump yourself over your school desk. Walk erect. It means so much now, it will mean much more in later years. Some day, if you heed my word, you will be grateful that the preacher once said to you so emphatically that you could not forget, \"John, Mary, stand up straight.\"  Fourth, the candle stands for Light. It is useless until the wick is lighted. It burns for others. Your life is a light. Jesus wants all Christians to think of themselves as lights in the world. \"Let your light shine.\" Be a lighted candle for the Lord.

SUBSTANTIVE.  _Substantives_ in this language are declined without the use of articles.  2. Those which may be called _verbal_, from their origin in verbs, are much used: hiósguadauh, painting, or writing, is the passive (is painted) of the present active hiósguan, I paint. They have their times: hiósguadauh is in the present, expressing the picture I form now of the passive preterite hiósguacauh, the work I have executed, of which hiósguatzidaugh, the picture I will make, is the future passive: and when to these verbal substantives is added the particle gua, it denotes place, as, No hiósguadaubgua, the place where I paint, etc.  GUA.  3. But words signifying kindred, have their termination usually in gua also, for which see section 16.  SIVEN, RINA.  4, 5. _Other verbal substantives_, signifying instruments, are made from the future active: thus, the verb métecan, I chop, having métetze in the future, receives siven in lieu of the final syllable, and makes the substantive, métesiven, axe or tool with which to chop. Many of these words likewise terminate in rina, as bícusirina, flute, from bícudan, I whistle, and bíhirina, shovel, from bihán, I scrape.  RAGUA, SURA.  6, 7. Many _abstract nouns_ are formed by the addition of the particle ragua, as váde, joyously; váderagua, joy; déni, good; déniragua, goodness; dóhme, man, or people; dóhmeragua, humanity; and so diósragua, divinity. Others, substantive nouns, applied to certain places end in súra, as, omásúra, canebrake, from om, cane, and súra, in or among; huérigosúra, reedfield; húparosúra, mesquitscrub: and so a town is called Opósúra, because it is among some trees called opó, elm.  8. The _verbs are substantives_ likewise, and as such are declined as much so as the same words are conjugated when verbs: thus, nemútzan, I bewitch, is also wizard, and hiósguan, I write, is scrivener; but it is to be observed of these substantives, as well as of those which end in daugh, that they too have equally their times, as nemútzan, the wizard--that is now, in the present; nemútzari, the preterite that has; nemútzatze, the future that will, with the difference that these terminations are active, while those in daugh, etc., are passive.         *       *       *       *       *   ADJECTIVE NOUNS.  TERI, EI, RAVE, E, I, O, U.  9, 10, 11, 12. The many _adjective nouns_ ending in téri, and ei, signify quality, as, bavitéri, elegant; aresumetéri, different or distinct; tasúquei, narrow; asóquei, thick; sútei, white; and so of the rest signifying color. Some ending in ráve, denote plenitude; for example, sitoráve, full of honey; composed of sitóri, honey, and ráve, full; seborráve, full of flies; ateráve of até, louse, etc.; others, ending in e, i, o, u, signify possession, as, esé, she that has petticoats; cúne, she that has a husband; guásue, he that has land for planting; húvi, the married man, from hub, woman; nóno, he that has a father, from nónogua, father, and sutúu, he that has finger-nails, from sutú: and they, moreover, have their times like verbs, since, from esé is formed esei, preterite, she that had petticoats; cúnetze, future, she that will marry, etc.; and afterwards they are declined as nouns, as, _Nom._, eséi; _Gen._ eséigue. (For other form of the possessive, see section 19.)  CA, SARI, SCOR, SGUARI.  13, 14. It is usual for the want of many positive affirmatives in the language to express by the positive of the opposite signification, adding the negation ca, as, nucuatéri, perishable; canucuatéri, everlasting; cúne, married, f.; cacúne, not married; húbi, married, m.; cahúbi, not married, etc. Those ending in sári, and scor, mark a bad, or vicious quality, as, dedensári, tobacco-smoker, from déinan, I suck; and hibesári, gluttonous, from hibáan, I eat; nehrisári, talker, from néhren, I talk; capasári, old rags, from capát; baníscor, weeper, from báanan; cotzíscor, sleeper, from cotzom; dióscor, vagabond, from dion, I walk, or vacosári, which has the same signification, from vácon. The termination, sguari, is used in this sense: dotzi, old man; dotzísguari, very old man; hóit, female of middle age; hoísguari, very old woman.   DECLENSION.  Substantives of the First Declension form their genitive in _que_, and usually are such as terminate in a vowel.    _Nominative_, Siibì, hawk,   _Genitive_, Sìiibíque, of hawk,   _Dative_, Siibt, to hawk,   _Accusative_, Siibìe, hawk,   _Vocative_, Siibì, hawk,   _Ablative_, Sibítze, in     \\               Sibíde, by       > hawk.               Sibíquema, with /  The plural of substantives (requiring a special notice) will be treated of hereafter. Substantives of the Second Declension form their genitive in _te_ and _t_.    _N._ Mavirot, Lion.   _G._ Mavirote,   _D. and A._ Mavírota,   _V._ Mavírot,   _A._ Mavírotze, in,        Mavírode, by,        Mavírotema, with lion.    The verb-noun hiósguadauh, painting, is thus declined.    _N._ Hiósgnadauh,   _G._ Hiósguadauhte,   _D. and A._ Hiósguadauhta,   _Ab._ Hiósguadautze, in,         Hiósguadauhde, by,         Hiósguadauhtema, with painting.  And so likewise decline the preterite passive hiósguacauh, and the future passive hiósguatzidauh.  But verbs in the present time, when they serve as substantives, are thus declined    _N._ Nemútzan, wizard.   _G._ Nemútzante,   _D. and A._ Nemútzanta,   _V._ Nemútzan,   _A._ Nemútzantze, in,        Nemútzade, by,        Nemútzantema, with wizard.  Some ending in _t_ while they form the genitive in _te_, part with a vowel, as follows:    _N._ Arit, Ant.   _G._ Arte,   _D. and A._ Arta,   _V._ Arit;   _A._ Artze, in,        Arde, by,        Artema, with ant.  Nónoguat, father, belongs to this declension, and forms the genitive nónauhte; but when preceded by a possessive pronoun, it loses the final guat, as has been stated, and the termination is left in _o_, to form the genitive in the first declension, as, no, my, no nónoque, of my father, which rule applies equally to other names of kindred.  Sometimes an ablative is formed in _u_, as teópatu, in the church, from teópa, hecátu, in the shade, from hecát.  Substantives of the Third Declension end in _s_, _r_, _z_, and form the genitive by the addition of _e_, and the accusative by _i_.    _N._ Utzvor, Pitahaya.   _G._ Utzv[=o]re,   _D. and A._ Utzvori,   _V._ Utzvor,   _A._ Utzvortze, in,        Utzvorde, by,        Utzvorema, with pitahaya.  In this way decline tatas, crabapple,--gen. tatáse, dat. and acc. tatási, &c., also, porótz, wildcat, gen. porótze, dat. and acc. porótzi, &c.  To Adjective Nouns there has been an inclination to assign a separate place, but they terminate _in a vowel_, and there appears to be no reason why they should not go with substantives of the first declension.      _N._ Sóvei, obscure.     _G._ Sóveique,     _D. and A._ Sóvec,   _V._ Sóvei,     _A._ Sóvetze in,          Sóveide, by,          Sóveiquema, with obscure.  OF THE PLURAL.  15. Substantives, especially those animate of rational beings, usually form the plural by doubling the first syllable, as, dor, man, or male; dódor, men; hoit, woman, pl. hóhoit; déni, good, pl. dedéni.  Some other words form their plural irregularly, as, doritzi, boy, pl. vus, applied to both sexes, though when intended only for males dódorus is used; hoquis, large girls, pl. hórquir; temátzi, big boy, pl. tetemtzi; to which when the particle _te_ is added it marks the absence of any of the other sex, as dodórte, men only; hohóite, women only; hórquirte, girls only. The declension of these plurals is according to the rules before given.  OF KINDRED.  16. The language is remarkable for another peculiarity, which is, that the females in many instances employ different words from the males: the father says to his son, Nognàt, to his daughter, Mórqua; the mother to either says, Nótzgua; the son to the father says, Nonógua, and the daughter says, Mósgua. The elder brother likewise is called Vátzgua, pl. Vapàtz, the younger Vángua, pl. Vopon, the elder sister Cotzgua, pl. Cocátz, the younger Víngua, pl. Vipim, to which adding the possessive pronouns no, amo, and the like, the gua is omitted to such as have that termination. There is much to be learned about the names of the kindred, but the subject is one too wide for present explanation.  PRONOUNS.  17. The _Personal Pronoun_ nee, I, followed by another word becomes ne; nap, thou or you, becomes na, tamide becomes ta; emet or emíde becomes em, veride and iride become ver and ir; meride becomes mer.            SINGULAR.                        PLURAL.    _Nom._ Nee, I,                        Tamide, we,   _Gen._ No, of me,                     Tamo, of us,   _Dat. and Acc._ Netz, to me,          Tame, to us,   _Voc._ (if there be any,) Nee, O,     Tamide, O we,   _Abl._ Noma, with me,                 Tamóma, with us,   Node, by me;                           Tamóde, by us. the ma in this case being that of cause, manner and instrument.    _N._ Nap, thou,                       Emet, or Emíde, ye,   _G._ Amo, of thee,                    Emo, of you,   _D. and A._ Eme, to thee,             Emé, to you,   _V._ Nap, O thou,                     Emèt, O ye,   _Ab._ Amóma, with thee,               Emóma, with you,           Amóde, by thee,               Emóde, by you.    _N._ Veride, or Iride, this,          Meride, these,   _G._ Vére, of this,                   Mere, of these,   _D. and A._ Véra, to this,            Mera, to these,   _Ab._ Veréma, with this,              Meréma, with these,         Veréde, by this,                Merede, by these.    _N._ Véte, that,   _G._ Véte, of that.
