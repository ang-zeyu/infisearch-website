I guess milk'll be the right ticket considerin' th' size of 'im. How ole you make 'im? Not more'n three, I reckon?\"  \"Two. He ain't more'n two, that kid.\"  \"A nice little feller; you're a cute un, ain't ye, Shaver?\"  Shaver nodded his head solemnly. Having wearied of playing with the plate he gravely inspected the trio; found something amusing in Humpy's bizarre countenance and laughed merrily. Finding no response to his friendly overtures he appealed to Mary.  \"Me wants me's paw-widge,\" he announced.  \"Porridge,\" interpreted Humpy with the air of one whose superior breeding makes him the proper arbiter of the speech of children of high social station. Whereupon Shaver appreciatively poked his forefinger into Humpy's surviving optic.  \"I'll see what I got,\" muttered Mary. \"What ye used t' eatin' for supper, honey?\"  The \"honey\" was a concession, and The Hopper, who was giving Shaver his watch to play with, bent a commendatory glance upon his spouse.  \"Go on an' tell us what ye done,\" said Mary, doggedly busying herself about the stove.  The Hopper drew a chair to the table to be within reach of Shaver and related succinctly his day's adventures.  \"A dip!\" moaned Mary as he described the seizure of the purse in the subway.  \"You hadn't no right to do ut, Hop!\" bleated Humpy, who had tipped his chair against the wall and was sucking a cold pipe. And then, professional curiosity overmastering his shocked conscience, he added: \"What'd she measure, Hop?\"  The Hopper grinned.  \"Flubbed! Nothin' but papers,\" he confessed ruefully.  Mary and Humpy expressed their indignation and contempt in unequivocal terms, which they repeated after he told of the suspected \"bull\" whose presence on the local had so alarmed him. A frank description of his flight and of his seizure of the roadster only added to their bitterness.  Humpy rose and paced the floor with the quick, short stride of men habituated to narrow spaces. The Hopper watched the telltale step so disagreeably reminiscent of evil times and shrugged his shoulders impatiently.  \"Set down, Hump; ye make me nervous. I got thinkin' to do.\"  \"Ye'd better be quick about doin' ut!\" Humpy snorted with an oath.  \"Cut the cussin'!\" The Hopper admonished sharply. Since his retirement to private life he had sought diligently to free his speech of profanity and thieves' slang, as not only unbecoming in a respectable chicken farmer, but likely to arouse suspicions as to his origin and previous condition of servitude. \"Can't ye see Shaver ain't use to ut? Shaver's a little gent; he's a reg'ler little juke; that's wot Shaver is.\"  \"The more 'way up he is the worse fer us,\" whimpered Humpy. \"It's kidnapin', that's wot ut is!\"  \"That's wot it _ain't_,\" declared The Hopper, averting a calamity to his watch, which Shaver was swinging by its chain. \"He was took by accident I tell ye! I'm goin' to take Shaver back to his ma--ain't I, Shaver?\"  \"Take 'im back!\" echoed Mary.  Humpy crumpled up in his chair at this new evidence of The Hopper's insanity.  \"I'm goin' to make a Chris'mas present o' Shaver to his ma,\" reaffirmed The Hopper, pinching the nearer ruddy cheek of the merry, contented guest.  Shaver kicked The Hopper in the stomach and emitted a chortle expressive of unshakable confidence in The Hopper's ability to restore him to his lawful owners. This confidence was not, however, manifested toward Mary, who had prepared with care the only cereal her pantry afforded, and now approached Shaver, bowl and spoon in hand. Shaver, taken by surprise, inspected his supper with disdain and spurned it with a vigor that sent the spoon rattling across the floor.  \"Me wants me's paw-widge bowl! Me wants me's _own_ paw-widge bowl!\" he screamed.  Mary expostulated; Humpy offered advice as to the best manner of dealing with the refractory Shaver, who gave further expression to his resentment by throwing The Hopper's watch with violence against the wall. That the table-service of The Hopper's establishment was not to Shaver's liking was manifested in repeated rejections of the plain white bowl in which Mary offered the porridge. He demanded his very own porridge bowl with the increasing vehemence of one who is willing to starve rather than accept so palpable a substitute. He threw himself back on the table and lay there kicking and crying. Other needs now occurred to Shaver: he wanted his papa; he wanted his mamma; he wanted to go to his gwan'pa's. He clamored for Santa Claus and numerous Christmas trees which, it seemed, had been promised him at the houses of his kinsfolk. It was amazing and bewildering that the heart of one so young could desire so many things that were not immediately attainable. He had begun to suspect that he was among strangers who were not of his way of life, and this was fraught with the gravest danger.  \"They'll hear 'im hollerin' in China,\" wailed the pessimistic Humpy, running about the room and examining the fastenings of doors and windows. \"Folks goin' along the road'll hear 'im, an' it's terms fer the whole bunch!\"  The Hopper began pacing the floor with Shaver, while Humpy and Mary denounced the child for unreasonableness and lack of discipline, not overlooking the stupidity and criminal carelessness of The Hopper in projecting so lawless a youngster into their domestic circle.  \"Twenty years, that's wot ut is!\" mourned Humpy.  \"Ye kin get the chair fer kidnapin',\" Mary added dolefully. \"Ye gotta get 'im out o' here, Bill.\"  Pleasant predictions of a long prison term with capital punishment as the happy alternative failed to disturb The Hopper. To their surprise and somewhat to their shame he won the Shaver to a tractable humor. There was nothing in The Hopper's known past to justify any expectation that he could quiet a crying baby, and yet Shaver with a child's unerring instinct realized that The Hopper meant to be kind. He patted The Hopper's face with one fat little paw, chokingly declaring that he was hungry.  '\"Course Shaver's hungry; an' Shaver's goin' to eat nice porridge Aunt Mary made fer 'im. Shaver's goin' to have 'is own porridge bowl to-morry--yes, sir-ee, oo is, little Shaver!\"  Restored to the table, Shaver opened his mouth in obedience to The Hopper's patient pleading and swallowed a spoonful of the mush, Humpy holding the bowl out of sight in tactful deference to the child's delicate Ã¦sthetic sensibilities. A tumbler of milk was sipped with grateful gasps.  [Illustration: THE HOPPER GRINNED, PROUD OF HIS SUCCESS, WHICH MARY AND HUMPY VIEWED WITH GRUDGING ADMIRATION]  The Hopper grinned, proud of his success, while Mary and Humpy viewed his efforts with somewhat grudging admiration, and waited patiently until The Hopper took the wholly surfeited Shaver in his arms and began pacing the floor, humming softly. In normal circumstances The Hopper was not musical, and Humpy and Mary exchanged looks which, when interpreted, pointed to nothing less than a belief that the owner of Happy Hill Farm was bereft of his senses. There was some question as to whether Shaver should be undressed. Mary discouraged the idea and Humpy took a like view.  \"Ye gotta chuck 'im quick; that's what ye gotta do,\" said Mary hoarsely. \"We don't want 'im sleepin' here.\"  Whereupon The Hopper demonstrated his entire independence by carrying the Shaver to Humpy's bed and partially undressing him. While this was in progress, Shaver suddenly opened his eyes wide and raising one foot until it approximated the perpendicular, reached for it with his chubby hands.  \"Sant' Claus comin'; m'y Kwismus!\"  \"Jes' listen to Shaver!\" chuckled The Hopper. \"'Course Santy is comin,' an' we're goin' to hang up Shaver's stockin', ain't we, Shaver?\"  He pinned both stockings to the foot-board of Humpy's bed. By the time this was accomplished under the hostile eyes of Mary and Humpy, Shaver slept the sleep of the innocent.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]     IV   They watched the child in silence for a few minutes and then Mary detached a gold locket from his neck and bore it to the kitchen for examination.  \"Ye gotta move quick, Hop,\" Humpy urged. \"The white card's what we wuz all goin' to play. We wuz fixed nice here, an' things goin' easy; an' the yard full o' br'ilers. I don't want to do no more time. I'm an ole man, Hop.\"  \"Cut ut!\" ordered The Hopper, taking the locket from Mary and weighing it critically in his hand. They bent over him as he scrutinized the face on which was inscribed:--      _Roger Livingston Talbot_     _June 13, 1913_  \"Lemme see; he's two an' a harf. Ye purty nigh guessed 'im right, Mary.\"  The sight of the gold trinket, the probability that the Shaver belonged to a family of wealth, proved disturbing to Humpy's late protestations of virtue.  \"They'd be a heap o' kale in ut, Hop. His folks is rich, I reckon. Ef we wuzn't playin' the white card--\"  Ignoring this shocking evidence of Humpy's moral instability, The Hopper became lost in reverie, meditatively drawing at his pipe.  \"We ain't never goin' to quit playin' ut square,\" he announced, to Mary's manifest relief. \"I hadn't ought t' 'a' done th' dippin'. It were a mistake. My ole head wuzn't workin' right er I wouldn't 'a' slipped. But ye needn't jump on me no more.\"  \"Wot ye goin' to do with that kid? Ye tell me that!\" demanded Mary, unwilling too readily to accept The Hopper's repentance at face value.  \"I'm goin' to take 'im to 'is folks, that's wot I'm goin' to do with 'im,\" announced The Hopper.  \"Yer crazy--yer plum' crazy!\" cried Humpy, slapping his knees excitedly. \"Ye kin take 'im to an orphant asylum an' tell um ye found 'im in that machine ye lifted. And mebbe ye'll git by with ut an' mebbe ye won't, but ye gotta keep me out of ut!\"  \"I found the machine in th' road, right here by th' house; an' th' kid was in ut all by hisself.

Again he cut little chips from the trees as he passed, but never ceased his swift and silent journey to the south. The hours fled by, and a dark shade appeared in the east. It deepened into dusk, and spread steadily toward the zenith. The sun, a golden ball, sank behind a hill in the west, and then the shiftless one stopped.  He ascended a low hill again, and took a long scrutinizing look around the whole horizon. But his gaze was not apprehensive. On the contrary, it was expectant, and his face seemed to show a slight disappointment when the wilderness merely presented its wonted aspect. Then he built another fire, not choosing a secluded glade, but the top of the hill, the most exposed spot that he could find, and, after he had eaten his supper, he sat beside it, the expectant air still on his face.  Nothing came. But the shiftless one sat long. He raked up dead leaves of last year's winter and made a pillow, against which he reclined luxuriously. Shif'less Sol was one who drew mental and physical comfort from every favoring circumstance, and the leaves felt very soft to his head and shoulders. He was not in the least lonesome, although the night had fully come, and heavy darkness lay like a black robe over the forest. He stretched out his moccasined toes to the fire, closed his eyes for a moment or two, and a dreamy look of satisfaction rested on his face. It seemed to the shiftless one that he lay in the very lap of luxury, in the very best of worlds.  But when he opened his eyes again he continued to watch the forest, or rather he watched with his ears now, as he lay close to the earth, and his hearing, at all times, was so acute that it seemed to border upon instinct or divination. But no sound save the usual ones of the forest and the night came to him, and he remained quite still, thinking.  Shif'less Sol Hyde was in an exalted mood, and the flickering firelight showed a face refined and ennobled by a great purpose. Leading a life that made him think little of hardship and danger he thought nothing at all of them now, but he felt instead a great buoyancy, and a hope equally great.  He lay awake a full three hours after the dark had come, and he rose only twice from his reclining position, each time merely to replenish the fire which remained a red core in the circling blackness. Always he was listening and always he heard nothing but the usual sounds of the forest and the night. The darkness grew denser and heavier, but after a while it began to thin and lighten. The sky became clear, and the great stars swam in the dusky blue. Then Shif'less Sol fell asleep, head on the leaves, feet to the fire, and slept soundly all through the night.  He was up at dawn, cooked his breakfast, and then, after another long and searching examination of the surrounding forest, departed, leaving the coals of the fire to smoulder, and tell as they might that some one had passed. Shif'less Sol throughout that morning repeated the tactics of the preceding day, leaving footprints that would last, and cutting pieces of bark from the trees with his sharp hatchet. At the noon hour he stopped, according to custom, and, just when he had lighted his fire, he uttered a low cry of pleasure.  The shiftless one was gazing back upon his own trail, and the singular look of exaltation upon his face deepened. He rose to his feet and stood, very erect, in the attitude of one who welcomes. No undergrowth was here, and he could see far down the aisles of trunks.  A figure, so distant that only a keen eye would notice it, was approaching. It came on swiftly and silently, much after the manner of the shiftless one himself, elastic, and instinct with strength.  The figure was that of a boy in years, but of a man in size, surpassing Shif'less Sol himself in height, yellow haired, blue-eyed, and dressed, too, in the neatest of forest garb. His whole appearance was uncommon, likely anywhere to attract attention and admiration. The shiftless one drew a long breath of mingled welcome and approval.  \"I knew that he would be first,\" he murmured.  Then he sat down and began to broil a juicy deer steak on the end of a sharpened stick.  Henry Ware came into the little glade. He had seen the fire afar and he knew who waited. All was plain to him like the print of a book, and, without a word, he dropped down on the other side of the fire facing Shif'less Sol. The two nodded, but their eyes spoke far more. Sol held out the steak, now crisp and brown and full of savor, and Henry began to eat. Sol quickly broiled another for himself, and joined him in the pleasant task, over which they were silent for a little while.  \"I was on the Ohio,\" said Henry at last, \"when the trapper brought me your message, but I started at once.\"  \"O' course,\" said Shif'less Sol, \"I never doubted it for a minute. I reckon that you've come about seven hundred miles.\"  \"Nearer eight,\" said Henry, \"but I'm fresh and strong, and we need all our strength, Sol, because it's a great task that lies before us.\"  \"It shorely is,\" said Sol, \"an' that's why I sent the message. I don't want to brag, Henry, but we've done a big thing or two before, an' maybe we kin do a bigger now.\"  He spoke the dialect of the border, he was not a man of books, but that great look of exaltation came into his face again, and the boy on the other side of the fire shared it.  \"It seems to me, Sol,\" said Henry presently, \"that we've been selected for work of a certain kind. We finish one job, and then another on the same line begins.\"  \"Mebbe it's because we like to do it, an' are fit fur it,\" said Sol philosophically. \"I've noticed that a river gen'ally runs in a bed that suits it. I don't know whether the bed is thar because the river is, or the river is thar 'cause the bed is, but it's shore that they're both thar together, an' you can't git aroun' that.\"  \"There's something in what you say,\" said Henry.  Then they relapsed into silence, and, in a half hour, as if by mutual consent, they rose, left the fire burning, and departed, still walking steadily toward the south.  The country grew rougher. The hills were higher and closer together, and the undergrowth became thick. Neither took any precautions as they passed among the slender bushes, frequently trampling them down and leaving signs that the blindest could not fail to see. Now and then the two looked back, but they beheld only the forest and the forest people.  \"I don't think I ever saw the game so tame before,\" said Henry.  \"Which means,\" said Sol, \"that the warriors ain't hunted here fur a long time. I ain't seen a single sign o' them.\"  \"Nor I.\"  They fell silent and scarcely spoke until the sun was setting again, when they stopped for the night, choosing a conspicuous place, as Sol had done the evening before. After supper, they sought soft places on the turf, and lay in peace, gazing up at the great stars. Henry was the first to break the silence.  \"One is coming,\" he said. \"I can hear the footstep. Listen!\"  His ear was to the earth, and the shiftless one imitated him. At the end of a minute he spoke.  \"Yes,\" he said, \"I hear him, too. We'll make him welcome.\"  He rose, put a fresh piece of wood on the fire, and smiled, as he saw the flame leap up and crackle merrily.  \"Here he is,\" said Henry.  The figure that emerged from the bushes was thick-set and powerful, the strong face seamed and tanned by the wind, rain and sun of years. The man stepped into the circle of the firelight, and held out his hand. Each shook it with a firm and hearty clasp, and Tom Ross took his seat with them beside the fire. They handed him food first, and then he said:  \"I was away up in the Miami country, huntin' buffalo, when the word came to me, Sol, but I quit on the minute an' started.\"  \"I was shore you would,\" said the shiftless one quietly. \"Buffaloes are big game, but we're huntin' bigger now.\"  \"I was never in this part of the country before,\" said Tom Ross, looking around curiously at the ghostly tree trunks.  \"I've been through here,\" said Henry, \"and it runs on in the same way for hundreds of miles in every direction.\"  \"Bigger an' finer than any o' them old empires that Paul used to tell us about,\" said Shif'less Sol.  \"Yes,\" said Henry.  The three looked at one another significantly.  They wrapped themselves in their blankets by and by, and went to sleep on the soft turf. Henry was the first to awake, just when the dawn was turning from pink to red, and a single glance revealed to him an object on the horizon that had not been there the night before. A man stood on the crest of a low hill, and even at the distance, Henry recognized him. His comrades were awaking and he turned to them.  \"See!\" he said, pointing with a long forefinger.  Their eyes followed, and they too recognized the man.  \"He'll be here in a minute,\" said Shif'less Sol. \"He jest eats up space.\"  He spoke the truth, as it seemed scarcely a minute before Long Jim Hart entered the camp, showing no sign of fatigue. The three welcomed him and gave him a place at their breakfast fire.  \"I wuz at Marlowe,\" he said, \"when the word reached me, but I started just an hour later. I struck your trail, Sol, two days back, an' I traveled nearly all last night. I saw Henry join you an' then Tom.\"  Shif'less Sol laughed. He had a soft, mellow laugh that crinkled up the corners of his mouth, and made his eyes shine. There was no doubt that a man who laughed such a laugh was enjoying himself.  \"I reckon you didn't have much trouble follerin' that trail o' ourn,\" he said.  Jim Hart answered the laugh with a grin.  \"Not much,\" he replied. \"It was like a wagon road through the wilderness. The ashes uv your last camp fire weren't sca'cely cold when I passed by.\"  \"We're all here 'cept the fifth feller,\" said Tom Ross.  \"The fifth will come,\" said Henry emphatically.  \"Uv course,\" said Tom Ross with equal emphasis.  \"And when he comes,\" said Shif'less Sol, \"we"]]]
