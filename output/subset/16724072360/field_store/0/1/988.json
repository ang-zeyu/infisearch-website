In the first place, I am only eighteen years old, and my brief command was a very small one, as the world goes. It hardly entitles me to be called captain after I have ceased to be in command. In charge of the little Maud I was the happiest young fellow on the Eastern Continent; but I am just as happy now, for this morning I was formally appointed third officer of the Guardian-Mother, at the wages paid to Captain Sharp when he had the same position.\"  \"I congratulate you, Mr. Scott,\" said Louis, grasping the hand of the new officer, though he had been duly consulted in regard to the appointment the day before.  \"Permit me to congratulate you also, Mr. Scott,\" added Miss Blanche, as she extended to him her delicate little hand.  \"Thank you, Miss Woolridge,\" replied the new third officer, raising the uniform cap he had already donned, and bowing as gracefully as a dancing-master. \"Thank you with all my heart, Louis. I won't deny that I was considerably broken up when the Maud was sold; but now I am glad of it, for it has given me a position that I like better.\"  \"Now, Mr. Scott, what is the run for to-day?\" asked Louis, renewing his first question.  \"I don't know,\" replied the third officer with a mischievous smile.  \"You don't know!\" exclaimed Louis.  \"I do not, Louis.\"  \"I thought all the officers, including the commander, took the observation, and worked up the reckoning for the longitude. We got eight bells nearly an hour ago, and the bulletin must have been posted by this time.\"  \"It was posted some time ago. All the officers work up the reckoning; and I did so with the others. The commander and I agreed to a second.\"  \"What do you mean by saying you do not know the run?\" demanded Louis.  \"I do know the run; but that was not what you asked me,\" answered Scott with the same mischievous smile.  \"What did I ask you?\"  \"The first time you asked me all right, and I should have answered you if I had not felt obliged to switch off and inform you and Miss Woolridge of my new appointment. The second time you put it you changed the question.\"  \"I changed it?\" queried Louis.  \"You remember that when Mrs. Blossom asked Flix where under the sun he had been, he replied that he had not been anywhere, as it happened to be in the evening, when the sun was not overhead.\"  \"A quibble!\" exclaimed Louis, laughing.  \"Granted; but one which was intended to test your information in regard to a nautical problem. You asked me the second time for the run of to-day for the last twenty-four hours.\"  \"And that was what I asked you the first time,\" answered Louis.  \"I beg your pardon, but you asked me simply for the run to-day.\"  \"Isn't that the same thing?\"  \"Will you please to tell me how many hours there are in a sea-day?\" asked Scott, becoming more serious.  \"That depends,\" answered Louis, laughing. \"You have me on the run.\"  \"You will find that the bulletin signed by the first officer gives the run as 330 miles; but the answer to your second question is 337 miles, about,\" added the third officer. \"Just here the day is only twenty-three hours and forty minutes long as we are running; and the faster we go the shorter the day,\" continued the speaker, who was ciphering all the time on a card.  \"I don't see how that can be,\" interposed Miss Blanche, with one of her prettiest smiles.  \"There is the lunch-bell; but I shall be very happy to explain the matter more fully later in the day, Miss Woolridge, unless you prefer that Louis should do it,\" suggested Scott.  \"I doubt if I could do it, and I should be glad to listen to the explanation,\" replied Louis, as they descended to the main cabin; for the new third officer was permitted to retain his place at the table as well as his state-room.  The commander had suggested that there was likely to be some change of cabin arrangements; for it was not in accordance with his ideas of right that the third officer should be admitted to the table, while the first and second were excluded; and Louis was very desirous that his friend Scott should remain in the cabin. The repasts on board the steamer were social occasions, and the party often sat quite an hour at the table, as at the present luncheon. But as soon as the company left their places, Louis and Miss Blanche followed the third officer to the promenade deck, to hear the desired explanation of sea-time.  \"Of course you know how the longitude of the ship is obtained, Miss Woolridge?\" the young officer began.  \"Papa explained it to me once, but I could not understand it,\" replied the fair maiden.  \"Then we will explain that first. One of the great circles extending through the poles is called the prime meridian; and any one may be selected, though that of Greenwich has been almost universally adopted. This place is near London. From this prime meridian longitude is calculated, which means that any given locality is so many degrees east or west of it. Sandy Hook is in longitude 74°, or it is that number of degrees west of Greenwich. Aden is in 45° east longitude.\"  \"Then you find how many miles it is by multiplying the number of degrees by 69,\" suggested Miss Blanche.  \"You have forgotten about knots, or sea-miles,\" said Louis.  \"So I have! I should have said multiply by 60,\" added the young lady.  \"That would not do it any better,\" replied Scott.  \"Degrees of latitude are always the same for all practical purposes; but degrees of longitude are as--      'Variable as the shade   By the light quivering aspen made,'\"  continued the third officer, who was about to say \"as a woman's mind;\" but he concluded that it was not quite respectful to the lovely being before him.  \"What a poetical sea-monster you are, Mr. Scott!\" exclaimed Miss Blanche with a silvery laugh.  \"I won't do so any more,\" Scott protested, and then continued his explanation. \"Degrees of longitude vary from nothing at the poles, up to 69.07 statute, or 60 geographical or sea-miles, at the equator. We are now in about 15° north latitude; and a degree of longitude is 66.65 statute miles, or 57.9855 sea-miles, near enough to call it 58. By the way, Louis, multiply the number of statute miles by .87, and it gives you the sea-miles. Divide the knots by the same decimal, and it gives the statute miles.\"  \"I will try to remember that decimal as you have done,\" replied Louis. \"Now, Mr. Scott, don't open Bowditch's Navigator to us, or talk about projection,' 'logarithms,' 'Gunter,' and 'inspection;' for I am not capable of understanding them, for my trigonometry has gone to the weeping willows.\"  \"Talk to us in English, Mr. Scott,\" laughed Miss Blanche.  \"Let us go up to Conference Hall, where there is a table,\" said the third officer, as he produced a book he had brought up from his state-room. He led the way to the promenade, where he spread out a chart in the \"Orient Guide,\" which had twenty-six diagrams of a clock, one at the foot of every fifteen degrees of longitude. At this point the commander came upon the promenade.  \"Formerly the figures on a timepiece in Italy, and perhaps elsewhere, went up to twenty-four, instead of repeating the numbers up to twelve; and these diagrams are constructed on that plan,\" continued Scott.  \"An attempt has been made to re-establish this method in our own country. I learned once from a folder that a certain steamer would leave Detroit at half-past twenty-two; meaning half-past ten. But the plan was soon abandoned,\" interposed the captain.  \"Aden, from which we sailed the other day, is in longitude 45° east. Every degree by meridians is equal to four minutes of clock-time. Multiply the longitude by four, and the result in minutes is the difference of time between Greenwich and Aden, 180 minutes, or three hours. When it is noon at Greenwich, it is three o'clock at Aden, as you see in the diagram before you.\"  \"Three o'clock in the morning, Mr. Scott?\" queried the commander.  \"In the afternoon, I should have added. Going east the time is faster, and _vice versa_,\" continued the young officer. \"At our present speed our clocks must be put about twenty minutes ahead, for a third of an hour has gone to Davy Jones's locker.\"  \"I understand all that perfectly,\" said Miss Blanche with an air of triumph.  \"You will be a sea-monster before you get home. The sirens were beautiful, and sang very sweetly,\" added Scott jocosely.  \"They were wicked, and I don't want to be one. But I do not quite understand how you found out what time it was at noon to-day,\" added the young lady.  \"For every degree of longitude sailed there is four minutes' difference of clock-time,\" Scott proceeded. \"You know that a chronometer is a timepiece so nicely constructed and cared for, that it practically keeps perfect time. Meridians are imaginary great circles, and we are always on one of them. With our sextants we find when the centre of the sun is on the celestial meridian corresponding to the terrestrial one; and at that instant it is noon where we are. Then we know what time it is. We compare the time thus obtained with that indicated by the chronometer, and find a difference of four hours.\"  \"I see it all!\" exclaimed the fair maiden, as triumphantly as though she had herself reasoned out the problem. \"Four hours make 240 minutes, and four minutes to a degree gives 60° as the longitude.  \"Quite correct, Miss Woolridge,\" added Scott approvingly.  \"If I could only take the sun, I could work up the longitude myself,\" the little beauty declared.  \"You have already taken the son,\" replied Scott; but he meant the son of Mrs. Belgrave, and he checked himself before he had \"put his foot in it;\" for Louis would have resented such a remark.  \"I have seen them do it, but I never took the sun myself,\" protested the maiden.  The sea had suddenly begun to make itself felt a few hours before, and a flood of spray was cast over the promenade, which caused the party to evacuate it, and move farther"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15540"],["title","Across India; Or, Live Boys in the Far East (#2)"],["body","t. It was the time of year for the north-east monsoons to prevail, and the commander had declared that the voyage would probably be smooth and pleasant all the way to Bombay. It did not look much like it when the ship began to roll quite violently.                                      CHAPTER II                         THE WRECK IN THE ARABIAN SEA   It was a sharp squall that suddenly struck the Guardian-Mother, heeling her over so that everything movable on her decks or below went over to the lee side, and sending no small quantity of salt water over her pilot-house. It had begun to be what the ladies called rough some hours before; and with them Captain Ringgold's reputation as a prophet was in peril, for he had predicted a smooth sea all the way to Bombay.  The Blanche, the steam-yacht of General Noury, which was only a trifle larger than the Guardian-Mother, rolled even more. She was following the latter, and seemed to be of about equal speed, though no trial had been made between them. Miss Blanche and Louis had retreated to a dryer place than the promenade when the shower of spray broke over the pilot-house upon them, leaving the commander and Mr. Scott there.  Captain Ringgold frowned as he looked out on the uneasy waves, for the squall appeared to be a surprise to him; but it proved to be more than a white squall, which may come out of a clear sky, while with a black one the sky is wholly or partly covered with dark clouds. It continued to blow very fresh, and the commotion in the elements amounted to nothing less than a smart gale.  \"This is uncommon in the region of the north-east monsoons,\" said the commander, who was planking the promenade deck with Scott. \"During January and February the wind is set down as moderate in these waters. I have made two runs from Cape of Good Hope to Bombay, and we had quiet seas from the latitude of Cape Comorin to our destination both times; and I expected the same thing at this season of the year on this voyage.\"  The captain was evidently vexed and annoyed at the failure of his prediction, though squalls were liable to occur in any locality; but the present rough weather had begun to look like a gale which might continue for several days. The north-east monsoons were what he had a right to expect; but the gale came up from the south south-west. The commander appeared to be so much disturbed, that the young officer did not venture to say anything for the next half-hour, though he continued to walk at his side.  At the end of this time the commander descended to his cabin, inviting Scott to go with him. On the great table was spread out the large chart of the Indian Ocean. From Aden to Bombay he had drawn a red line, indicating the course, east by north a quarter north, which was the course on which the steamer was sailing.  \"Have you the blue book that comes with this chart, Captain Ringgold?\" asked Scott, rather timidly, as though he had something on his mind which he did not care to present too abruptly; for the commander was about the biggest man on earth to him.  \"This chart is an old one, as you may see by the looks of it and the courses marked on it from the Cape of Good Hope,\" replied the captain, looking at the young officer, to fathom his meaning. \"I put all my charts on board of the Guardian-Mother when we sailed for Bermuda the first time. If I ever had the blue book of which you speak, I haven't it now; and I forget all about it.\"  \"I bought that chart at Aden the first day we were there, when I expected to navigate the Maud to Bombay; and with it came the blue book, which treats mainly of winds, weather, and currents,\" added Scott. \"I studied it with reference to this voyage, and I found a paragraph which interested me. I will go to my state-room for the book, if you will permit me to read about ten lines from it to you.\"  The captain did not object, and Scott soon returned to the commander's cabin with the book. The autocrat of the ship was plainly dissatisfied with himself at the failure of his prediction for fine weather, and perhaps he feared that the ambitious young officer intended to instruct him in regard to the situation, though Scott had conducted himself in the most modest and inoffensive manner.  \"I don't wish to be intrusive, Captain Ringgold, but I thought it was possible that you had forgotten this paragraph,\" said the young officer, with abundant deference in his tone and manner.  \"Probably I never saw it; but read it, Mr. Scott,\" replied the commander.  \"The weather is generally fine, and the sky clear, with neither squall nor rain, except between Ras Seger and the island of Masira,'\" Scott began to read, when the commander interrupted him, and fixed his gaze on the chart, to find the localities mentioned.  \"Ras Sajer,\" said the captain, placing the point of his pencil on the cape whose name he read. \"That must be the one you mention.\"  \"No doubt of it, sir; and I have noticed that the spelling on the chart and in the books doesn't agree at all. The island is Massera on my chart.\"  \"They mean the same locality. Go on, Mr. Scott,\" added the captain.  \"'And the vicinity of the bay of Kuriyan Muriyan, where the winds and weather are more boisterous and variable than on any other part of the coast,'\" continued Scott.  \"Where is that bay?\" asked the commander.  \"It is between the two points mentioned before; but it is Kuria Muria on the chart;\" and the captain had the point of his pencil on it by this time.  \"We are within three hours' sail of the longitude of that bay, but a hundred and fifty miles south of it,\" said the commander. \"The information in the book is quite correct. Is there anything more about it?\"  \"Yes, sir; a few lines more, and I will read them: 'Respecting Kuriyan Muriyan Bay, Captain S.B. Haines, I.N., remarks that the sudden change of winds, termed by the Arabs _Belat_, and which blow with great violence for several days, are much dreaded; but what surprised me more than these land winds were the frequent and heavy gales from the S.S.W. during February and March, blowing for six days together.'\"  \"This gale, for such it appears to be, instead of a mere squall, as I supposed it was at first, has come before it was due by a few days; but it proves that what you have read is entirely correct,\" said the commander. \"My two voyages in the Arabian Sea took me twenty degrees east of this point, and therefore I had nothing but quiet water. But, Mr. Scott, you have put an old navigator into the shade, and I commend you for the care and skill with which you had prepared yourself for the voyage of the Maud to Bengal.\"  \"I protest that it was only an accident that I happened on that paragraph!\" exclaimed Scott, blushing under his browned face.  \"You found what you were looking for, and that was no accident. I feel that I have added an excellent young officer to the number of my officers,\" added Captain Ringgold.  \"I thank you, sir, with all my heart; but may I ask one favor of you?\" inquired the third officer.  \"Name it, and I will grant it if possible.\"  \"I earnestly request that you do not mention this little matter to any person on board of the ship.\"  The commander of the Guardian-Mother was an honest and just man, and he was disposed to give credit to any one who deserved it, even at his own expense, and he looked at the young officer in silence for some moments. Then they argued the question for a time; but the captain finally granted the new officer's request, praising him for his modesty, which was rather a newly developed virtue in his character.  The steamer continued to roll violently when Louis assisted Miss Blanche down the stairs to the main cabin. The dozen passengers who had not gone on deck after luncheon were in excellent humor, for all of them were experienced sailors by this time, and beyond the discomforts of seasickness. All of them held the commander in such high respect and regard, that not one of them mentioned the failure of his prediction of fine weather for the next five or six days. Perhaps all of them wondered, for the captain's predictions before had been almost invariably verified; but not one of them spoke of his missing it in this instance.  The gale continued the rest of the day and during the night. When the morning watch came on duty at four o'clock, Captain Ringgold was pacing the promenade deck, peering through the darkness, and observing the huge waves that occasionally washed the upper deck. He had not slept a wink during the night, though he had reclined an hour on the divan in the pilot-house. He was not alarmed for the safety of his ship, but he looked out for her very carefully in heavy weather.  He was particularly interested in the conduct of the Blanche. She had taken a position to windward of the Guardian-Mother, and appeared to be doing quite as well in the heavy sea as her consort. She had been built with all the strength and solidity that money could buy; and she was as handsome a craft as ever floated, not even excepting her present companion on the stormy sea, and she was proving herself to be an able sea-boat.  \"Good-morning, Mr. Scott,\" said the commander, as the young officer touched his cap to him.  Scott had been temporarily placed in the watch with the first officer, and his post of duty was at the after part of the ship.  \"Good-morning, Captain Ringgold,\" replied Scott, as he halted to ascertain if the commander had any orders for him. \"The gale does not appear to have moderated since I turned in, sir.\"  \"On the contrary, it blows fresher than ever. I did not expect such a nasty time as we are having of it,\" added the commander.  \"According to Captain Haines of the Indian navy, we may expect it to last five days longer, for we have had nearly one day of it.\"  \"Not quite so bad as that, Mr. Scott. If we had stayed in the vicinity of Kuria Muria Bay, we might have got five days more of it; but this is a local storm, and we shall doubtless run out of it in a day or two at"]]]
