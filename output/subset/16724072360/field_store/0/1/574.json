There was, indeed, not much to do, for the rendering is most exact. This in a translation of that date is not a little remarkable. We look for fine English and poetry in an Elizabethan; but we do not often get from him such loyalty to the original as is here displayed.  Of the author \"I.T.\" nothing is known. He may have been John Thorie, a Fleming born in London in 1568, and a B.A. of Christ Church, 1586. Thorie \"was a person well skilled in certain tongues, and a noted poet of his times\" (Wood, _Athenae Oxon._ ed. Bliss, i. 624), but his known translations are apparently all from the Spanish.[6]  Our translator dedicates his \"Five books of Philosophical Comfort\" to the Dowager Countess of Dorset, widow of Thomas Sackville, who was part author of _A Mirror for Magistrates_ and _Gorboduc_, and who, we learn from I.T.'s preface, meditated a similar work. I.T. does not unduly flatter his patroness, and he tells her plainly that she will not understand the philosophy of the book, though the theological and practical parts may be within her scope.  The _Opuscula Sacra_ have never before, to our knowledge, been translated. In reading and rendering them we have been greatly helped by two mediaeval commentaries: one by John the Scot (edited by E.K. Rand in Traube's _Quellen und Untersuchungen_, vol. i. pt. 2, Munich, 1906); the other by Gilbert de la Porrée (printed in Migne, _P.L._ lxiv.). We also desire to record our indebtedness in many points of scholarship and philosophy to Mr. E.J. Thomas of Emmanuel College.  Finally, thanks are due to Mr. Dolson for the suggestion in the footnote on the preceding page, and also to Professor Lane Cooper of Cornell University for many valuable corrections as this reprint was passing through the Press.

THE TRINITY IS ONE GOD NOT THREE GODS    A TREATISE BY ANICIUS MANLIUS SEVERINUS BOETHIUS MOST HONOURABLE, OF THE   ILLUSTRIOUS ORDER OF EX-CONSULS, PATRICIAN    TO HIS FATHER-IN-LAW, QUINTUS AURELIUS MEMMIUS SYMMACHUS   MOST HONOURABLE, OF THE ILLUSTRIOUS ORDER OF EX-CONSULS, PATRICIAN    I have long pondered this problem with such mind as I have and all the   light that God has lent me. Now, having set it forth in logical order   and cast it into literary form, I venture to submit it to your judgment,   for which I care as much as for the results of my own research. You will   readily understand what I feel whenever I try to write down what I think   if you consider the difficulty of the topic and the fact that I discuss   it only with the few--I may say with no one but yourself. It is indeed   no desire for fame or empty popular applause that prompts my pen; if   there be any external reward, we may not look for more warmth in the   verdict than the subject itself arouses. For, apart from yourself,   wherever I turn my eyes, they fall on either the apathy of the dullard   or the jealousy of the shrewd, and a man who casts his thoughts before   the common herd--I will not say to consider but to trample under foot,   would seem to bring discredit on the study of divinity. So I purposely   use brevity and wrap up the ideas I draw from the deep questionings of   philosophy in new and unaccustomed words which speak only to you and to   myself, that is, if you deign to look at them. The rest of the world I   simply disregard: they cannot understand, and therefore do not deserve   to read. We should not of course press our inquiry further than man's   wit and reason are allowed to climb the height of heavenly knowledge.[8]   In all the liberal arts we see the same limit set beyond which reason   may not reach. Medicine, for instance, does not always bring health to   the sick, though the doctor will not be to blame if he has left nothing   undone which he ought to do. So with the other arts. In the present case   the very difficulty of the quest claims a lenient judgment. You must   however examine whether the seeds sown in my mind by St. Augustine's   writings[9] have borne fruit. And now let us begin our inquiry.     [8] Cf. the discussion of human _ratio_ and divine _intellegentia_ in   _Cons. v._ pr. 4 and 5.    [9] e.g. Aug. _De Trin._     I.  Christianae religionis reuerentiam plures usurpant, sed ea fides pollet maxime ac solitarie quae cum propter uniuersalium praecepta regularum, quibus eiusdem religionis intellegatur auctoritas, tum propterea, quod eius cultus per omnes paene mundi terminos emanauit, catholica uel uniuersalis uocatur. Cuius haec de trinitatis unitate sententia est: \"Pater,\" inquiunt, \"deus filius deus spiritus sanctus deus.\" Igitur pater filius spiritus sanctus unus non tres dii. Cuius coniunctionis ratio est indifferentia. Eos enim differentia comitatur qui uel augent uel minuunt, ut Arriani qui gradibus meritorum trinitatem uariantes distrahunt atque in pluralitatem diducunt. Principium enim pluralitatis alteritas est; praeter alteritatem enim nec pluralitas quid sit intellegi potest. Trium namque rerum uel quotlibet tum genere tum specie tum numero diuersitas constat; quotiens enim idem dicitur, totiens diuersum etiam praedicatur. Idem uero dicitur tribus modis: aut genere ut idem"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13316"],["title","The Theological Tractates and The Consolation of Philosophy (#2)"],["body","quod equus, quia his idem genus ut animal; uel specie ut idem Cato quod Cicero, quia eadem species ut homo; uel numero ut Tullius et Cicero, quia unus est numero. Quare diuersum etiam uel genere uel specie uel numero dicitur. Sed numero differentiam accidentium uarietas facit. Nam tres homines neque genere neque specie sed suis accidentibus distant; nam uel si animo cuncta ab his accidentia separemus, tamen locus cunctis diuersus est quem unum fingere nullo modo possumus; duo enim corpora unum locum non obtinebunt, qui est accidens. Atque ideo sunt numero plures, quoniam accidentibus plures fiunt.       I.    There are many who claim as theirs the dignity of the Christian   religion; but that form of faith is valid and only valid which, both on   account of the universal character of the rules and doctrines affirming   its authority, and because the worship in which they are expressed has   spread throughout the world, is called catholic or universal. The belief   of this religion concerning the Unity of the Trinity is as follows: the   Father is God, the Son is God, the Holy Spirit is God. Therefore Father,   Son, and Holy Spirit are one God, not three Gods. The principle of this   union is absence of difference[10]: difference cannot be avoided by   those who add to or take from the Unity, as for instance the Arians,   who, by graduating the Trinity according to merit, break it up and   convert it to Plurality. For the essence of plurality is otherness;   apart from otherness plurality is unintelligible. In fact, the   difference between three or more things lies in genus or species or   number. Difference is the necessary correlative of sameness. Sameness is   predicated in three ways: By genus; e.g. a man and a horse, because of   their common genus, animal. By species; e.g. Cato and Cicero, because of   their common species, man. By number; e.g. Tully and Cicero, because   they are numerically one. Similarly difference is expressed by genus,   species, and number. Now numerical difference is caused by variety of   accidents; three men differ neither by genus nor species but by their   accidents, for if we mentally remove from them all other accidents,[11]   still each one occupies a different place which cannot possibly be   regarded as the same for each, since two bodies cannot occupy the same   place, and place is an accident. Wherefore it is because men are plural   by their accidents that they are plural in number.     [10] The terms _differentia, numerus, species,_ are used expertly, as   would be expected of the author of the _In Isag. Porph. Commenta._ See   S. Brandt's edition of that work (in the Vienna _Corpus_, 1906), s.v.   _differentia,_ etc.    [11] This method of mental abstraction is employed more elaborately in   _Tr._ iii. (_vide infra_, p. 44) and in _Cons._ v. pr. 4, where the   notion of divine foreknowledge is abstracted in imagination.     II.  Age igitur ingrediamur et unumquodque ut intellegi atque capi potest dispiciamus; nam, sicut optime dictum uidetur, eruditi est hominis unum quodque ut ipsum est ita de eo fidem capere temptare.  Nam cum tres sint speculatiuae partes, _naturalis_, in motu inabstracta [Greek: anupexairetos] (considerat enim corporum formas cum materia, quae a corporibus actu separari non possunt, quae corpora in motu sunt ut cum terra deorsum ignis sursum fertur, habetque motum forma materiae coniuncta), _mathematica_, sine motu inabstracta (haec enim formas corporum speculatur sine materia ac per hoc sine motu, quae formae cum in materia sint, ab his separari non possunt), _theologica_, sine motu abstracta atque separabilis (nam dei substantia et materia et motu caret), in naturalibus igitur rationabiliter, in mathematicis disciplinaliter, in diuinis intellectualiter uersari oportebit neque diduci ad imaginationes, sed potius ipsam inspicere formam quae uere forma neque imago est et quae esse ipsum est et ex qua esse est. Omne namque esse ex forma est. Statua enim non secundum aes quod est materia, sed secundum formam qua in eo insignita est effigies animalis dicitur, ipsumque aes non secundum terram quod est eius materia, sed dicitur secundum aeris figuram. Terra quoque ipsa non secundum [Greek: apoion hulaen] dicitur, sed secundum siccitatem grauitatemque quae sunt formae. Nihil igitur secundum materiam esse dicitur sed secundum propriam formam. Sed diuina substantia sine materia forma est atque ideo unum et est id quod est. Reliqua enim non sunt id quod sunt. Vnum quodque enim habet esse suum ex his ex quibus est, id est ex partibus suis, et est hoc atque hoc, id est partes suae coniunctae, sed non hoc uel hoc singulariter, ut cum homo terrenus constet ex anima corporeque, corpus et anima est, non uel corpus uel anima in partem; igitur non est id quod est. Quod uero non est ex hoc atque hoc, sed tantum est hoc, illud uere est id quod est; et est pulcherrimum fortissimumque quia nullo nititur. Quocirca hoc uere unum in quo nullus numerus, nullum in eo aliud praeterquam id quod est. Neque enim subiectum fieri potest; forma enim est, formae uero subiectae esse non possunt. Nam quod ceterae formae subiectae accidentibus sunt ut humanitas, non ita accidentia suscipit eo quod ipsa est, sed eo quod materia ei subiecta est; dum enim materia subiecta humanitati suscipit quodlibet accidens, ipsa hoc suscipere uidetur humanitas. Forma uero quae est sine materia non poterit esse subiectum nec uero inesse materiae, neque enim esset forma sed imago. Ex his enim formis quae praeter materiam sunt, istae formae uenerunt quae sunt in materia et corpus efficiunt. Nam ceteras quae in corporibus sunt abutimur formas uocantes, dum imagines sint. Adsimulantur enim formis his quae non sunt in materia constitutae. Nulla igitur in eo diuersitas, nulla ex diuersitate pluralitas, nulla ex accidentibus multitudo atque idcirco nec numerus.       II.    We will now begin a careful consideration of each several point, as far   as they can be grasped and understood; for it has been wisely said,[12]   in my opinion, that it is a scholar's duty to formulate his belief about   anything according to its real nature.    Speculative Science may be divided into three kinds[13]: Physics,   Mathematics, and Theology. Physics deals with motion and is not abstract   or separable (i.e. [Greek: anupexairetos]); for it is concerned with the   forms of bodies together with their constituent matter, which forms   cannot be separated in reality from their bodies.[14] As the bodies are   in motion--the earth, for instance, tending downwards, and fire tending   upwards, form takes on the movement of the particular thing to which it   is annexed.    Mathematics does not deal with motion and is not abstract, for it   investigates forms of bodies apart from matter, and therefore apart from   movement, which forms, however, being connected with matter cannot be   really separated from bodies.    Theology does not deal with motion and is abstract and separable, for   the Divine Substance is without either matter or motion. In Physics,   then, we are bound to use scientific, in Mathematics, systematical, in   Theology, intellectual concepts; and in Theology we will not let   ourselves be diverted to play with imaginations, but will simply   apprehend that Form which is pure form and no image, which is very Being   and the source of Being. For everything owes its being to Form. Thus a   statue is not a statue on account of the brass which is its matter, but   on account of the form whereby the likeness of a living thing is   impressed upon it: the brass itself is not brass because of the earth   which is its matter, but because of its form. Likewise earth is not   earth by reason of unqualified matter,[15] but by reason of dryness and   weight, which are forms. So nothing is said to be because it has matter,   but because it has a distinctive form. But the Divine Substance is Form   without matter, and is therefore One, and is its own essence. But other   things are not simply their own essences, for each thing has its being   from the things of which it is composed, that is, from its parts. It is   This _and_ That, i.e. it is the totality of its parts in   conjunction; it is not This _or_ That taken apart. Earthly man, for   instance, since he consists of soul and body, is soul _and_ body,   not soul _or_ body, separately; therefore he is not his own   essence. That on the other hand which does not consist of This and That,   but is only This, is really its own essence, and is altogether beautiful   and stable because it is not grounded in anything. Wherefore that is   truly One in which is no number, in which nothing is present except its   own essence. Nor can it become the substrate of anything, for it is pure   Form, and pure Forms cannot be substrates.[16] For if humanity, like   other forms, is a substrate for accidents, it does not receive accidents   through the fact that it exists, but through the fact that matter is   subjected to it. Humanity appears indeed to appropriate the accident   which in reality belongs to the matter underlying the conception   Humanity. But Form which is without matter cannot be a substrate, and   cannot have its essence in matter, else it would not be form but a   reflexion. For from those forms which are outside matter come the forms   which are in matter and produce bodies. We misname the entities that   reside in bodies when we call them forms; they are mere images; they   only resemble those forms which are not incorporate in matter. In Him,   then, is no difference, no plurality arising out of difference, no   multiplicity arising out of accidents, and accordingly no number.     [12] By Cicero (_Tusc_. v. 7. 19).
