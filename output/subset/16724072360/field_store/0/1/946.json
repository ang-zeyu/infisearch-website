How you startled me!\" exclaimed the red squirrel. \"But I'm glad it's you, Uncle Wiggily. I'm going to a surprise party soon, and I was just trying to make my tail as big as Johnnie or Billie Bushytail's, but I can't do it,\" she said sadly.  \"No, and you never can,\" said the rabbit. \"Their tails are a different kind than yours, for they are gray squirrels and you are a red one. But yours is very nice. Be content to have yours as it is.\"  \"I guess I will,\" said the red squirrel. \"But what are you doing out so late, Uncle Wiggily?\"  \"Looking for the end of the moon-beam to get my fortune.\"  \"Ha! The moon-beam ends right here,\" said the red squirrel-girl, pointing to her looking-glass, and, surely enough, there the bright shaft of light ended. \"But there is no fortune here, Uncle Wiggily, I am sorry to say,\" she added.  \"I see there isn't,\" answered the rabbit. \"Well, I must travel on again to-morrow, then. But now I will see that you get safely home, for it is getting late.\"  And, just as he said that, what should happen but that a black, savage, ugly bear stuck his nose out of the bushes and made a grab for the rabbit. But what do you think the red squirrel did?  She just took her hair brush and with the hard back of it she whacked the bear on the end of his tender-ender nose, and he howled, and turned around to run away, and the squirrel girl tickled him with the comb, and he ran faster than ever, and the bear didn't eat Uncle Wiggily that night.  Then the rabbit stayed at the red squirrel's mamma's house the rest of the evening, and the next day the squirrel went to the surprise party with her tail the regular size it ought to be, and not as big as the Bushytail brothers' tails, and everybody was happy.  Now in case the granddaddy longlegs doesn't tickle the baby with his long cow-pointing leg and make her laugh so she gets the hiccoughs, I'll tell you in the next story about Uncle Wiggily and the brown wren.     STORY II  UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE BROWN WREN   Well, just as I expected, the granddaddy longlegs did tickle the baby, but she only smiled in her sleep, and didn't awaken, so, as it's nice and quiet I can tell you another story. And it's going to be about how Uncle Wiggily, in his travels about the country, in search of his fortune, helped a little brown wren.  \"Well, where are you going this morning?\" asked the red squirrel's mother as Uncle Wiggily finished his breakfast, and shook out from his long ears the oatmeal crumbs that had fallen in them.  \"Oh, I suppose I will have to be traveling on,\" answered the rabbit. \"That fortune of mine seems to be a long distance off. I've tried rainbows and moon-beams and I didn't find any money at their ends. I guess I'll have to look under the water next, but I'll wait until I get back home, and then I'll have Jimmie Wibblewobble the duck boy put his head at the bottom of the pond and see if there is any gold down there.\"  So off the old gentleman rabbit started, limping on his crutch, for his rheumatism was troubling him again, and at his side swung his valise, with some crackers and cheese and bread and butter and jam in it--plenty of jam, too, let me tell you, for the red squirrel's mamma could make lovely preserves, and this was carrot jam, with turnip frosting on it.  Well, Uncle Wiggily traveled on and on, over the hills and through the deep woods, and pretty soon he came to a place where he saw a lot of little black ants trying to carry to their nest a nice big piece of meat that some one had dropped.  \"My, how hard those ants are working,\" thought the rabbit. \"But that meat is too heavy for them. I'll have to help carry it.\"  Now the piece of meat was only as big as a quarter of a small cocoanut, but, of course, that's too big for an ant to carry; or even for forty-'leven ants, so Uncle Wiggily kindly lifted it for them, and put it in their nest.  \"Thank you very much,\" said the biggest ant. \"If ever we can do you a favor, or any of your friends, we will.\"  The old gentleman rabbit said he was glad to hear that, and then, taking up his crutch and valise again, on he went.  Pretty soon he came to a place in the woods where the sun was shining down through the trees, and a little brook was making pretty music over the stones. And then, all at once, the old gentleman rabbit heard a different kind of music, and it was that of a little bird singing. And this is the song.  Now I did not make up this song. It is much prettier than I could write, even if I had my Sunday-go-to-meeting clothes on, and I don't know who did write it. But it used to be in my school reader when I was a little boy, and I liked it very much. I hope whoever did write it won't mind if you sing it. This is it:      \"There's a little brown bird sitting up in a tree,     He's singing to you--he's singing to me.     And what does he say, little girl--little boy?     Oh, the world's running over with joy!\"  Then the bird sang about how there were five eggs laid away up in a nest, and how, pretty soon, little birds would come out from them, and then, all of a sudden, the bird sang like this:      \"But don't meddle,--don't touch,     Little girl--little boy,     Or the world will lose some of its joy!\"  \"Ha! you seem quite happy this beautiful morning,\" said Uncle Wiggily, as he paused under the tree where the bird was singing. \"Why, I do declare,\" he exclaimed. \"If it isn't Mrs. Wren! Well, I never in all my born days! I didn't know you were back from the South yet.\"  \"Yes, Uncle Wiggily,\" said the little brown wren, \"I came up some time ago. But I'm real glad to see you. I'm going to take my little birdies out of the shell pretty soon. They are almost hatched.\"  \"Glad to hear it,\" said the rabbit, politely, and then he told about seeking his fortune, and all of a sudden a great big ugly crow-bird flew down out of a tall tree and made a dash for Mrs. Wren to eat her up. But Mrs. Wren got out of the way just in time, and didn't get caught.  But alack, and alas-a-day! The crow knocked down the wren's nest, and all the sticks and feathers of which it was made were scattered all about, and the eggs, with the little birdies inside, would have been all broken ker-smash, only that they happened to fall down on some soft moss.  \"Oh, dear!\" cried Mrs. Wren, sorrowfully. \"Now see what that crow has done! My home is broken up, and my birdies will be killed.\"  \"Caw! Caw! Caw!\" cried the crow as unkindly as he could, and it sounded just as if he laughed \"Haw! Haw! Haw!\"  \"Oh, whatever shall I do?\" asked Mrs. Wren. \"My birdies will have no nest, and I haven't time to make another and break up the little fine sticks that I need and gather the feathers that are scattered all over. Oh, what shall I do? Soon my birdies will be out of the shells.\"  \"Never fear!\" said Uncle Wiggily, bravely. \"I will help you. I'll gather the sticks for you.\"  \"Oh, but you haven't time; you must be off seeking your fortune,\" answered the wren.  \"Oh, I guess my fortune can wait. It has been waiting for me a long time, and it won't hurt to wait a bit longer. I'll get you the sticks,\" said the rabbit gentleman.  So while Mrs. Wren sat over the eggs to keep them warm with her fluffy feathers, Uncle Wiggily looked for sticks with which to make a new nest. He couldn't find any short and small enough, so what do you think he did?  Why, he took some big sticks and he jumped a jiggily dance up and down on them with his sharp paws, and broke them up as fine as toothpicks for the nest. Then he arranged them as well as he could in a sort of hollow, like a tea cup.  \"Oh, if we only had some feathers now, we would be all right,\" said Mrs. Wren. \"It's a very good nest for a rabbit to make.\"  \"Don't say a word!\" cried some small voices on the ground. \"We will gather up the feathers for you.\" And there came marching up a lot of the little ants that Uncle Wiggily had been kind to, and soon they had gathered up all the scattered feathers. And the nest was made on a mossy stump, and lined with the feathers, and the warm eggs were put in it by Mrs. Wren, who then hovered over them to hatch out the birdies. And she was very thankful to Uncle Wiggily for what he had done.  Now, in case the water in the lake doesn't get inside the milk pail and make lemonade of it, I'll tell you in the next story how the birdies were hatched out, and also about Uncle Wiggily and the sunfish.     STORY III  UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE SUNFISH   Uncle Wiggily slept that night--I mean the night after he had helped Mrs. Wren build her nest--he slept in an old under-ground house that another rabbit must have made some time before. It was nicely lined with leaves, and the fortune-hunting bunny slept very nice and warm there.  When the sun was up, shining very brightly, and most beautifully, Uncle Wiggily arose, shook his ears to get the dust out of them, and threw the dried-leaf blankets off him.  \"Ah, ha! I must be up and doing,\" he cried. \"Perhaps I shall find my fortune to-day.\"  Well, no sooner had he crawled out of the burrow than he heard a most beautiful song. It was one Mrs. Wren was singing, and it went \"tra-la-la tra-la-la! tum-tee-tee-tum-tum-tee-tee!\" too pretty for anything. And then, afterward, there was a sort of an echo like \"cheep-cheep cheep-cheep!\"  \"Why, you must be very happy this morning, Mrs. Wren!\" called Uncle Wiggily to her as she sat in her new nest which the rabbit had made for her on the mossy stump.  \"I am,\" she answered, \"very happy. What do you think happened in the night?\"  \"I can't guess,\" he answered. \"A burglar crow didn't come and steal your eggs, I hope!\"  \"Oh, nothing sad or bad like that,\" she answered. \"But something very nice. Just hop up here and look.\"  So Uncle Wiggily hopped up on the stump, and Mrs. Wren got off her nest, and there, on the bottom, in among some egg-shells, were a lot of tiny, weeny little birdies, about as big as a spool of silk thread "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15282"],["title","Uncle Wiggily's Travels (#2)"],["body","even smaller.  \"Why, where in the world did they come from?\" asked the old gentleman rabbit, rubbing his eyes.  \"Out of the eggs to be sure,\" answered Mrs. Wren. \"And I do declare, the last of my family is hatched now. There is little Wiggily out of the shell at last. I think I'll name him after you, as he never could keep still when he was being hatched. Now I must take out all the broken shells so the birdies won't cut themselves on them.\" And she began to throw them out with her bill, just as the mother hen does, and then one of the new little birdies called out:  \"Cheep-cheep-chip-chip!\"  \"Yes, I know you're hungry,\" answered their mamma, who understood their bird talk. \"Well, I'll fly away and get you something to eat just as soon as your papa comes home to stay in the house. You know Mr. Wren went away last night to see about getting a new position in a feather pillow factory,\" said Mrs. Wren to Uncle Wiggily, \"and he doesn't yet know about the birdies. I hope he'll come back soon, as they are very hungry, and I don't like to leave them alone to go shopping.\"  \"Oh, I'll stay and take care of them for you while you go to the store,\" said the old gentleman rabbit, kindly.  \"That will do very well,\" said Mrs. Wren. So she put on her bonnet and shawl and took her market basket and off she flew to the store, while Uncle Wiggily stayed with the new birdies, and they snuggled down under his warm fur, and were as cozy as in their own mother's feathers.  Well, Mrs. Wren was gone some time, as the store was crowded and she couldn't get waited on right away, and Uncle Wiggily stayed with the birdies. And they got hungrier and hungrier, and they cried real hard. Yes, indeed, as hard as some babies.  \"Hum! I don't know what to do,\" said the old gentleman rabbit. \"I can't feed them. I guess I'll sing to them.\" So he sang this song:      \"Hush, birdies, hush,       Please don't cry;     Mamma'll be back       By and by.      \"Nestle down close       Under my fur,     I'm not your mother, but       I'm helping her.\"  But this didn't seem to satisfy the birdies and they cried \"cheep-cheep\" harder than ever.  \"Oh, dear! I believe I must get them something to eat,\" said Uncle Wiggily. So he covered them all up warmly with the feathers that lined the nest, and then he hopped down and went limping around on his crutch to find them something to eat.  Pretty soon he came to a little brook, and as he looked down into it he saw something shining, all gold and red and green and blue and yellow.  \"Why, I do declare, if here isn't the end of the rainbow!\" exclaimed the old gentleman rabbit, as he saw all the pretty colors.  He rubbed his eyes with his paw, to make sure he wasn't dreaming, but the colors were surely enough there, down under water.  \"No wonder the giant couldn't find the pot of gold, it was down in the water,\" spoke the rabbit. \"But I'll get it, and then my fortune will be made. Oh, how glad I am!\"  Well, Uncle Wiggily reached his paw down and made a grab for the red and green and gold and yellow thing, but to his surprise, instead of lifting up a pot of gold, he lifted up a squirming, wiggling sunfish.  \"Oh, my!\" exclaimed the rabbit in surprise.  \"I should say yes! Two Oh mys and another one!\" gasped the fish. \"Oh, please put me back in the water again. The air out on land is too strong for me. I can't breathe. Please, Uncle Wiggily, put me back.\"  \"I thought you were a pot of gold,\" said the rabbit, sadly. \"I'm always getting fooled. But never mind. I'll put you in the water.\"  \"What are you doing here?\" asked the fish, as he slid into the water again and sneezed three times.  \"Just at present I am taking care of Mrs. Wren's new little birdies,\" said the rabbit. \"She has gone to the store for something for them to eat, but they are so hungry they can't wait.\"  \"Oh, that is easily fixed,\" said the sunfish. \"Since you were so kind to me I'll tell you what to do. Get them a few little worms, and some small flower seeds, and feed them. Then the birdies will go to sleep.\"  So Uncle Wiggily did this, and as soon as the birds had their hungry little mouths filled, sound to sleep they went. And in a little while Mrs. Wren came back from the store with her basket filled, and Mr. Wren flew home to say that he had a nice position in a feather factory, and how he did admire his birdies! He hugged and kissed them like anything.  Then the two wrens both thanked Uncle Wiggily for taking care of their children, and the rabbit said good-by and hopped on again to seek his fortune. And if the trolley car conductor gives me a red, white and blue transfer, for the pin cushion to go to sleep on, I'll tell you in the following story about Uncle Wiggily and the yellow bird.     STORY IV  UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE YELLOW BIRD   Once upon a time, when Johnnie Bushytail was going along the road to school, he met a fox--oh, just listen to me, would you! This story isn't about the squirrel boy at all. It's about Uncle Wiggily Longears to be sure, and the yellow bird, so I must begin all over again.  The day after the old gentleman rabbit had helped Mrs. Wren feed her little birdies he found himself traveling along a lonely road through a big forest of tall trees. Oh, it was a very lonesome place, and not even an automobile was to be seen, and there wasn't the smell of gasoline, and no \"honk-honks\" to waken the baby from her sleep.  \"Hum, I don't believe I'll find any fortune along here,\" thought Uncle Wiggily as he tramped on. \"I haven't met even so much as a red ant, or even a black one, or a grasshopper. I wonder if I can be lost?\"  So he looked all around to see if he might be lost in the woods. But you know how it is, sometimes you're lost when you least expect it, and again you think you are lost, but you're right near home all the while.  That's the way it was with Uncle Wiggily, he didn't know whether or not he was lost, so he thought he'd sit down on a flat stone and eat his lunch. The reason he sat on a flat stone instead of a round one was because he had some hard boiled eggs for his lunch, and you know if you put an egg on a round stone it's bound to roll off and crack right in the middle.  \"And I don't like cracked eggs,\" said the rabbit. So he laid the eggs he had on the flat stone, and put little sticks in front of them and behind them, so they couldn't even roll off the flat stone if they wanted to. Then he ate his lunch.  \"I guess it doesn't much matter if I am lost,\" said the traveling fortune-hunting rabbit a little later. \"I'll go on and perhaps I may meet with an adventure.\" So on he hopped, and pretty soon he came to a place where the leaves and the dirt were all torn up, just as if some boys had been playing a baseball game, or leap-frog, or something like that.  \"My, I must look out that I don't tumble down any holes here,\" thought Uncle Wiggily, \"for maybe some bad men have been setting traps to catch us rabbits.\"  Well, he turned to one side, to get out of the way of some sharp thorns, and, my goodness! if there weren't more sharp thorns on the ground on the other side of the path. \"I guess I'll have to keep straight ahead!\" thought our Uncle Wiggily. \"I never saw so many thorns before in all my life. I'll have to look out or I'll be stuck.\"  So he kept straight on, and all of a sudden he felt himself going down into a big hole.  \"Oh! Oh dear! Oh me! Oh my!\" cried Uncle Wiggily. \"I've fallen into a trap! That's what those thorns were for--so I would have to walk toward the trap instead of going to one side.\"  But, very luckily for Uncle Wiggily, his crutch happened to catch across the hole, and so he didn't go all the way down, but hung on. But his valise fell to the bottom. However, he managed to pull himself up on the ground, though his rheumatism hurt him, and soon he was safe once more.  \"Oh, my valise, with all my clothes in it!\" he cried, as he looked down into the hole, which had been covered over with loose leaves and dirt so he couldn't see it before falling in. \"I wonder how I can get my things back again?\" he went on.  Then he looked up, and in a tree, not far from him, he saw something bright and yellow, shining like gold.  \"Ah, ha!\" cried Uncle Wiggily. \"At last I have found the pot of gold, even if the rainbow isn't here. That is yellow, and yellow is the color of gold. Now my fortune is made. I will get that gold and go back home.\"  So, not worrying any more about his valise down the trap-hole, Uncle Wiggily hopped over to the tree to get what he thought was a big bunch of yellow gold. But as he came closer, he saw that the gold was moving about and fluttering, though not going very far away.  \"That is queer gold,\" thought the old gentleman rabbit. \"I never saw moving gold before. I wonder if it is a good kind.\"  Then he went a little closer and he heard a voice crying.  \"Why, that is crying gold, too,\" he said. \"This is very strange.\"  Then he heard some one calling:  \"Oh, help! Will some one please help me?\"  \"Why, this is most strange of all!\" the rabbit cried. \"It is talking gold. Perhaps there is a fairy about.\"  \"Oh, I only wish there was one!\" cried the yellow object in the tree. \"If I saw a fairy I'd ask her to set me free.\"  \"What's that? Who are you?\" asked the rabbit.  \"Oh, I'm a poor little yellow bird,\" was the answer, \"and I'm caught in a string-trap that some boys set in this tree. There is a string around my legs and I can't fly home to see my little ones. I got into the trap by mistake. Oh! can't you help me? Climb up into the tree, Uncle Wiggily, and help me!\"  \"How did you know my name was Uncle Wiggily?\" asked the rabbit.  \"I could tell it by your ears--your wiggling ears,\" was the answer. \"But please climb up and help me.\"  \"Rabbits can't climb trees,\" said Uncle Wiggily. \"But I will tell you what I'll do. I'll gnaw the tree down with my sharp teeth, for they are sharp, even if I am a little old. Then, when it falls, I can reach the string, untie it, and you will be free.\"  So"]]]
