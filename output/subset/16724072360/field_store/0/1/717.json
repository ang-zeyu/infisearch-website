So I came to my mother's place first of all, and full of joy and pleasant thoughts was I as we sailed into the well-remembered fiord to seek the little town at its head. And when we came there, nought but bitterest sorrow and wrath was ours; for the town was a black heap of ruin, and the few men who were left showed me where the kindly hands of the hill folk had laid my mother, the queen, in a little mound, after the Danish vikings, who had fallen suddenly on the place with fire and sword, had gone. They had grown thus bold because the great jarl was dead, and the king's sons had left the land without defence.  There I swore vengeance for this on every viking of Danish race that I might fall in with; for I was wild with grief and rage, as one might suppose. I set up a stone over the grave of my mother, graving runes thereon that should tell who she was and also who raised it; for I was skilled in the runic lore, having learned much from one of Einar's older men who had known my father.  Thereafter we cruised among the islands northwards until we learned that Harald was indeed upon us, and then I saw my last of Norway as we headed south again, and the last hilltop sank beneath the sea's rim astern of us. I did not know that so it would be at that time--it is well that one sees not far into things to come--but even now all my home seemed to be with Einar; and that also was not to last long, as things went. How that came about I must tell, for the end was that I came to Alfred the king.  When we came back to Kirkwall, I told the jarl all that I had done and learned; and grieved for me he was when he heard of my mother's death. Many things he said to me at that time which made him dearer to me. Then after a while he spoke of Harald, who, as it seemed, might come at any time.  \"We cannot fight Norway,\" he said, \"so we must even flit hence to the mainland and wait until Harald is tired of seeking us. It is in my mind that he seeks not so much for revenge as for payment of scatt from our islands. Now he has a reason for taking it by force. He will seek to fine us, and then make plans by which I shall hold the jarldom from him for yearly dues.\"  So he straightway called the Thing {ii} of all the Orkney folk, who loved him well, and put the matter before them; and they set to work and did his bidding, driving the cattle inland and scattering them, and making the town look as poor as they might.  Then in three days' time we sailed away laughing; for none but poor-looking traders were left, and no man would think that never had the Orkneys been so rich as in Einar's time. And he bade them make peace with the king when he came, and told them that so all would be well, for Harald would lay no heavy weregild on so poor a place for his son's slaying.  Southward we went to Caithness, and so westward along the Sutherland coast; for we had taken no scatt there for this year, and Einar would use this cruise to do so, seeing that we must put to sea. We were not the first who had laid these shores under rule from the Orkneys, for Jarl Sigurd had conquered them, meeting his death at last in a Sutherland firth, after victory, in a strange way.  He fought with a Scottish chief named Melbrigda of the Tusks, and slew him, and bore back his head to the ships at his saddle bow. Then the great teeth of the chief swung against the jarl's leg and wounded it, and of that he died, and so was laid in a great mound at the head of the firth where his ships lay. After that, the Orkneys were a nest of evil vikings till we came.  So it had happened that, from the time when it was made over him, Jarl Sigurd's mound had been untended, for we ourselves had never been so far south as this firth before. Indeed, it had been so laid waste by Sigurd's men after his death that there was nought to go there for. But at this time we had reason for getting into some quiet, unsought place where we should not be likely to be heard of, for the king had over-many ships and men for us to meet. So after a week's cruising we put into that firth, and anchored in the shelter of its hills.  There is no man of all our following who will forget that day, because of what happened almost as soon as the anchor held. It was very hot that morning, and what breeze had been out in the open sea was kept from us now by the hills, so that for some miles we had rowed the ships up the winding reaches of the firth; and then, as we laid in the oars and the anchorage was reached, there crept from inland a dim haze over the sun, dimming the light, and making all things look strange among the mountains. Then the sounds of the ships seemed to echo loudly over the still water and when all the bustle of anchoring was over, the stillness seemed yet greater, for the men went to their meals, and for a while spoke little.  Einar and I sat on his after deck under the awning, and spoke in low voices, as if afraid to raise our tones.  \"There is a thunderstorm about,\" I said.  \"Ay--listen,\" the jarl answered.  Then I heard among the hills, far up the firth beyond us, a strange sound that seemed to draw nearer, like and yet unlike thunder, roaring and jarring ever closer to us, till it was all around us and beneath us everywhere, and our very hearts seemed to stop beating in wonder.  Then of a sudden the ship was smitten from under the keel with a heavy, soundless blow, and the waters of the firth ebbed and flowed fiercely about us; and then the sound passed on and down the firth swiftly and strangely as it had come, and left us rocking on the troubled waters that plashed and broke along the rocks of the shore, while the still, thick air seemed full of the screams of the terrified eagles and sea birds that had left them.  \"Odin defend us!\" the jarl said; \"what is this?\"  I shook my head, looking at him, and wondering if my face was white and scared as his and that of every man whom I could see.  Now we waited breathless for more to come, but all was quiet again. The birds went back to their eyries, and the troubled water was still. Then presently our fears passed enough to let us speak with one another; and then there were voices enough, for every man wished to hear his own again, that courage might return.  Then a man from the Orkneys who had been with Jarl Sigurd came aft to us, and stood at the break of the deck to speak with Einar.  \"Jarl,\" he said, almost under his breath, \"it is in my mind that Sigurd, your brother, is wroth because his mound has been untended since we made it.\"  Then Einar said:  \"Was it so ill made that it needs tending?\"  \"It was well made, jarl; but rain and frost and sun on a new-made mound may have wrought harm to it. Or maybe he thinks that enough honour has not been paid him. He was a great warrior, jarl, and perhaps would have more sacrifice, and a remembrance cup drunk by his own brother at his grave.\"  Now this man's name was Thord, the same who taught me runes--a good seaman and leader of men, and one who was held to be wise in more matters than most folk. So his word was to be listened to.  \"You know more of these matters than I, Thord,\" Einar answered. \"Is it possible that Sigurd could work this?\"  \"Who knows what a dead chief of might cannot work?\" Thord said. \"I think it certain that Sigurd is angry for some reason; and little luck shall we have if we do not appease his spirit.\"  Then the jarl looked troubled, as well he might, for to go near the mound that held an angry ghost was no light matter. It lay far up the firth, Thord said, and the ships could not go so far. But Einar was very brave, and when he had thought for a little while he said:  \"Well, then, I will take boat and go to Sigurd's mound and see if he ails aught. Will any man come with me, however?\"  I liked not the errand, as may be supposed, but I could not leave my foster father to go alone.  \"I will be with you,\" I said. \"Will not Thord come also?\"  \"Ay,\" the grim Orkney man answered.  Now all our crew were listening to us, and I looked down the long gangways by chance, and when I did so no man would meet my eye. They feared lest they should be made to go to this haunted place, as it seemed--all but one man, who sat on the mast step swinging his feet. This was Kolgrim the Tall, the captain of the fore deck, a young man and of few words, but a terrible swordsman, and knowing much of sea craft. And when this man saw that I looked at him, he nodded a little and smiled, for he had been a friend of mine since I had first come to Einar.  \"Two men to row the boat will be enough, jarl,\" I said. \"Kolgrim yonder will come with us.\"  \"Well,\" the jarl answered, \"maybe four of us are enough. We shall not fright Sigurd with more, and maybe would find it hard to get them to come.\"  So he called Kolgrim, and he said that he would go with us, and went to get the boat alongside without more words.  Then the jarl and I and Thord armed ourselves--for a warrior should be met by warriors. The men were very silent, whispering among themselves, until the jarl was ready and spoke to them.  \"Have no fear for us,\" he said. \"Doubtless my brother needs somewhat, and calls me. I am going to find out what it is and return.\"  So we pushed off, Thord and Kolgrim rowing. It was strange to look back, as we went, on the ships, for not a soul stirred on board them, as it seemed, so intently were we watched; and the water was like a sheet of steel under them, so that they were doubled.  Presently they were hidden as we rounded a turn in the firth, and we were alone among the hills, and the lonesomeness was very great. There was no dwelling anywhere along the shores, nor in the deep glens that came down to them, each with its noisy burn falling along it. Once I saw deer feeding far up at the head of a valley that opened out, but they and the eagles were the only living things we could see beside the loons that swam and dived silently as we neared them.  The silence and the heat weighed on us, and we went for a mile or more"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14034"],["title","King Alfred's Viking: A Story of the First English Fleet (#2)"],["body","a word. Then we turned into the last reach of the water, and saw Sigurd's mound beside its edge at the very head of the firth, where the hills came round in a circle that was broken only by the narrow waters and the valley that went beyond them among the mountains. It was a fitting resting place for one who would sleep in loneliness; but I thought that I had rather lie where I could look out on the sea I loved, and see the long ships pass and the white waves break beneath me.  Now all seemed very peaceful here in the hot haze that brooded over the still mountains, and there seemed to be nought to fear. We drew swiftly up to the mound, with the plash of oars only to break the silence, and there was nought amiss that we could see. They had made it on a little flat tongue of land that jutted from the mountain's foot into the deep water, so that on two sides the mound was close to its edge. So we pulled on softly round the tongue of land, being maybe about fifty paces from the mound across the water. And when we saw the other side of Sigurd's resting place, the oars stayed suddenly, and the jarl, who held the tiller, swung the boat away from the shore, and I think I knew then what fear was.  The mound was open. There was a wide, brown scar, as of freshly-moved earth, across its base, reaching from the level to six or eight feet of its height, as though half the grass-grown side had been shorn away by a sword cut; and in the midst of that scar was a doorway, open to the grave's heart, low and stone built. Some of the earth that had fallen lay before it on the water's edge, but the rest was doubtless in the water, for there was but a narrow path between bank and mound.  At that sight we stared, thinking we should surely see the grim form of Sigurd loom gigantic and troll-like {iii} across the doorway; and the jarl half rose from his seat beside me, and cried out with a great voice:  \"Sigurd--my brother!\"  I think he knew not what or why he cried thus, for he sank back into his place and swayed against me, while his cry rang loud among the hills, and the eagles answered it.  And I grasped my sword hilt, as one does in some sudden terror, staring at the open mound; while old Thord muttered spells against I know not what, and Kolgrim looked at me, pale and motionless.  Then came the sharp, mocking cry of a diver, that rang strangely; and at once, without order. Thord dug his oar blade into the water and swung the boat round, and when once Kolgrim's back was towards that he feared, he held water strongly and then the boat was about, and we were flying from the place towards the ships, before we knew what was being done, panic stricken.  But Einar said never a word, and the two rowers slackened their pace only when the bend of the firth hid the mound from our sight.  Then said I, finding that Einar spoke not:  \"What are we flying from? there was nought to harm us.\"  For I began to be ashamed. Thereat Kolgrim stopped rowing, and Thord must needs do likewise, though he said:  \"It is ill for us to stay here. The dead jarl is very wroth.\"  \"I saw nought to fray us; the cry we heard was but that of a loon.\"  But Thord shook his head. The silence of the place had made all things seem strange, with the dull light that was over us, and the great heat among the towering hills.  \"The mound was freshly opened,\" he said. \"I saw earth crumbling even yet from the broken side. The blow we felt was that which Sigurd struck when he broke free.\"  Then at last Einar spoke, and his voice was strange:  \"I have left my brother unhonoured, and he is angry. What must be done?\"  Now I cannot tell what hardiness took hold of me, but it seemed that I must needs go back and see more of this. I was drawn to do so, as a thing they fear will make some men long to face it and know its worst, not as if they dared so much as when they must.  \"I think we should have waited to ask Sigurd that,\" I said; and Einar looked strangely at me.  \"Would you have us return?\" he asked.  \"Why not?\" said I. \"If the great jarl has called us as it seems, needs must that we know what he wills.\"  Then said Thord:  \"I helped to lay him in that place, and I mind how he looked at that time. Somewhat we left undone, doubtless. I dare not go back.\"  Einar looked at the hills, leaning his chin on his hand, and said slowly, when Thord had done:  \"That is the first time Thord has said 'I dare not.' Now I would that I had stayed to fight Harald and fall under his sword before. I too must say the same. I have left my brother unhonoured, and I dare not go back.\"  Pale and drawn the jarl's face was, and I knew he meant what he said. Nevertheless it seemed to me that some one must know what Sigurd willed.  \"Jarl Einar,\" I said, \"this is a strange business, and one cannot tell what it means. Now Sigurd was my father's close friend, and I have had nought to do with him. I will go back, therefore, and learn what I can of him. I think he will not harm me, for he has no reason to do so. Moreover if he does, none will learn what he needs.\"  \"I have heard,\" said Thord, \"that a good warrior may ask what he will of a dead hero, so that he shows no fear and is a friend. If his courage fails, however, then he will be surely destroyed.\"  Then I said:  \"I have no cause to fear Sigurd, save that he is a ghost. I do not know if I fear him as such; that is to be seen.\"  Now Einar laid his hand on mine and spoke gravely:  \"I think it is a hero's part to do what you say. If you go back and return in safety, the scalds will sing of you for many a long day. Go, therefore, boldly; this is not a matter from which you should be held back, as it has come into your mind.\"  Then said Thord:  \"It will be well to ask Sigurd for a token whereby we may know that he sends messages by you.\"  And Einar said on that:  \"In Sigurd's hand is his sword Helmbiter. I think he will give that to the man who dares speak to him, for he will know that it goes into brave hands. Ask him for it bravely.\"  \"Put me ashore, therefore, before my courage goes,\" I said; and they pulled the boat to the bank where I could step on a rock and so to shore. And when I was there, Kolgrim rose up and followed me without a word.  \"Bide here for two hours, jarl, and maybe I will return in that time,\" I said. \"Farewell.\"  So I turned away as they answered me, thinking that Kolgrim held the boat's painter. But he came after me, and I spoke to him:  \"Why, Kolgrim, will you come also?\"  \"You shall not go alone, Ranald the king's son; I will come with you as far as I dare.\"  \"That is well,\" I answered, and with that wasted no more words, but climbed the hillside a little, and then went steadily towards where the mound was, with Kolgrim close at my shoulder, and the jarl and Thord looking fixedly after us till we were out of sight.    Chapter II. The Gifts of Two Heroes.   I will not say that my steps did not falter when we came to whence we could see the mound. But it was lonely and still and silent; no shape of warrior waited our coming.  \"Almost do I fear to go nearer,\" said Kolgrim.  \"Put fear away, comrade,\" said I; \"we shall fare ill if we turn our backs now.\"  \"Where you go I go,\" he answered, \"though I am afraid.\"  \"The next best thing to not being afraid is to be afraid and not to show it,\" I said then, comforting myself also with a show of wisdom at least. \"Maybe fear is the worst thing we have to face.\"  So we went on more swiftly, and at last were on the tongue of land on the tip of which the mound stood. Still, since we could not see the open doorway, which was towards the water, the place seemed not so terrible. Yet I thought that by this time we should have seen Sigurd, or maybe heard his voice from the tomb. So now I dared to call softly:  \"Jarl Sigurd, here is one, a friend's son, who will learn what you will.\"  My voice seemed to fill all the ring of mountains with echoes, but there was no answer. All was still again when the last voice came back from the hillsides.  Then I went nearer yet, and passed to the waterside, where I could look slantwise across the doorway. And again I called, and waited for an answer that did not come.  \"It seems that I must go even to the door, and maybe into the mound,\" I said, whispering.  \"Not inside,\" said Kolgrim, taking hold of my arm.  But I had grown bolder with the thought that the hero seemed not angry, and now I had set my heart on winning the sword of which the jarl had told me, and I thought that I dared go even inside the tomb to speak with Sigurd.  \"Bide here, and I will go at least to the door,\" said I.  So I stepped boldly before it, standing on the heap of newly-fallen earth that had slipped from across it. The posts and lintel of the door were of stone slabs such as lay everywhere on the hillsides, and I stood so close that I could touch them. The doorway was not so high that I could see into it without stooping, for it was partly choked with the fallen earth, and I bent to look in. But I could only see for a few feet into the passage, as I looked from light to darkness.  \"Ho, Jarl Sigurd! what would you? Why have you opened your door thus?\"  Very hollow my voice sounded, and that was all.  \"Sigurd of Orkney--Sigurd, son of Rognvald--I am the son of Vemund your friend. Speak to me!\"  There was no answer. A bit of earth crumbled from the broken side of the mound and made me start, but I saw nothing. So I stepped away from the door and back to my comrade, who had edged nearer the place, though his face showed that he feared greatly.  \"I think that the mound has been rifled,\" I said. \"Sigurd would have us know it and take revenge.\"  \"No man has dared to go near that doorway till you came, Ranald Vemundsson,\" Kolgrim answered. \"Now I fear that he plans to lure you into the mound, and slay you there without light to help you. Go no further, maybe you will be closed up with the ghost.\"  That was not pleasant to think of, but I had seen nought to make me fear to go in. There was no such"]]]
