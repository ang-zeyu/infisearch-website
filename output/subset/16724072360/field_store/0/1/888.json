On Christmas Eve he put up the greens that decorated the parlour and dining-room--a ceremony that required large preparations with a step-ladder, a hammer, tacks, and string, the removal of his coat, and a lighted pipe in one corner of his mouth; and which proceeded with such painstaking slowness on account of his coming down from the ladder every other moment to view the artistic effect of the arrangements, that it was only by sticking the last branches up any old way at Clytie's wild appeal that he ever got it finished at all.  Then he helped her fill the stockings, his own fingers carefully giving the crowning effect of orange and cornucopia in each one, and arranging the large packages below, after tiptoeing down the stairs with them so as not to wake the officially sleeping children, who were patently stark awake, thrashing or coughing in their little beds. The sturdy George had never been known to sleep on Christmas Eve, always coming down the next day esthetically pale and with abnormally large eyes, to the feast of rapture.  On this Saturday--Christmas Eve's eve--when Langshaw finally reached home, laden with all the \"last things\" and the impossible packages of tortuous shapes left by fond relatives at his office for the children--one pocket of his overcoat weighted with the love-box of really good candy for Clytie--it was evident as soon as he opened the hall door that something unusual was going on upstairs. Wild shrieks of \"It's father! It's father!\" rent the air.  \"It's father!\"  \"Fardie! Fardie, don't come up!\"  \"Father, don't come up!\"  \"Father, it's your present!\"  There was hasty scurrying of feet, racing to and fro, and further shrieks. Langshaw waited, smiling.  It was evidently a \"boughten\" gift, then; the last had been a water pitcher, much needed in the household. He braced himself fondly for immense enthusiasm over this.  An expression of intense excitement was visible on each face when finally he was allowed to enter the upper room. Mary and Baby rushed at him to clasp his leg, while his wife leaned over to kiss him as he whispered:  \"I brought out a lot of truck; it's all in the closet in the hall.\"  George, standing with his hands in his pockets, proclaimed loudly, with sparkling eyes:  \"You nearly saw your present! It's from mother and us. Come here, Baby, and pull brother's leg. Say, father, do you like cut glass?\"  \"O-oh!\" came in ecstatic chorus from the other two, as at a delightful joke.  \"It's a secret!\" announced Baby, her yellow hair falling over one round, blue eye.  \"I believe it's a pony,\" said the father. \"I'm sure I heard a pony up here!\"  Shouts of renewed joy greeted the jest.  All the next day, Christmas Eve itself, whenever two or three of the family were gathered together there were secret whisperings, more scurryings, and frenzied warnings for the father not to come into the room. In spite of himself, Langshaw began to get a little curious as to the tobacco jar or the fire shovel, or whatever should be his portion. He not only felt resigned to not having the trout-rod, but a sort of wonder also rose in him that he had been bewitched--even momentarily--into thinking he could have it. What did it matter anyway?  \"It's worth it, old girl, isn't it?\" he said cryptically as he and Clytie met once unexpectedly in the hall, and he put his arm round her.  \"Yes!\" answered his wife, her dark eyes lustrous. Sometimes she didn't look much older than little Mary. \"One thing, though, I must say: I do hope, dear, that--the children have been thinking so much of our present to you and saving up so for it--I do hope, Joe, that if you are pleased you'll show it. So far as I'm concerned, it doesn't matter; but sometimes--when, of course, I know how pleased you really are--you don't show it at once to others. That's why I hope you'll show it to-morrow if--\"  \"Great Scott! Clytie, let up on it! What do you want me to do--jump up and down and make a fool of myself?\" asked her husband scornfully. \"You leave me alone!\"  It was Langshaw's firm rule, vainly protested even by his wife, that the household should have breakfast on Christmas Day before tackling the stockings--a hurried mockery of a meal, to be sure, yet to his masculine idea a reÃ«nforcement of food for the infant stomach before the long, hurtling joy of the day. The stockings and the piles under them were taken in order, according to age--the youngest first and the others waiting in rapt interest and admiration until their turn arrived--a pretty ceremony.  In the delicious revelry of Baby's joy, as her trembling, fat little fingers pulled forth dolls and their like, all else was forgotten until it was Mary's turn, and then George's, and then the mother's. And then, when he had forgotten all about it: \"Now father!\" There was seemingly a breathless moment while all eyes turned to him.  \"It's father's turn now; father's going to have his presents. Father, sit down here on the sofa--it's your turn now.\"  There were only a blue cornucopia and an orange and a bottle of olives in his stocking, a Christmas card from his sister Ella, a necktie from grandmamma, and nothing, as his quick eye had noted, under it on the floor; but now George importantly stooped down, drew a narrow package from under the sofa and laid it beside his father, pulling off the paper. Inside was a slim, longish, gray linen bag. Langshaw studied it for a moment before opening it.  \"Well, I'll be jiggered!\" he breathed, with a strange glance round at the waiting group and an odd, crooked smile. \"I'll be jiggered!\"  There in its neatly grooved sections lay the rod, ready to be put together--not a rod, but, as his eye almost unbelievingly reassured him, _the_ rod--the ticket of the shop adorning it--in all its beauty of golden shellac and delicate tip. His fingers touched the pieces reverently.  \"Well, will you look at that! How did you ever think of getting it?\"  \"How did I think of it? Because you talked about it all the time,\" said his wife scornfully, with her arms round his neck from behind, while the children flung themselves upon him. \"Oh, I know you thought you didn't; but you did just the same. George heard you, too. We got Mr. Wickersham to pick it out. He said it was the one you wanted. And the reel--you haven't noticed that box there--the reel is the right kind, he says; and the line is silk--the best. There's the book of flies too--six. Baby's crazy over them! Mr. Wickersham said it was all just what you ought to have. We've been saving up for the longest time; but we had to wait, you see, for George's deportment before the things could be bought. If it isn't right--\"  \"Right? Say, this is the finest present I ever had!\" said Langshaw with glittering eyes and that little crooked smile. \"It just beats everything!\"  He rose, scattering his adoring family, and, walking to the window, threw it open to the frosty December air and called across to a neighbour standing on the walk.  \"Want to come over here, Hendon? Got something to show you. Will you look at this! Present from my wife and the kids--been saving up for it. It's a peach, I'll tell you that! I'm going to take George off fishing this spring--What? Well, come over later, when you've got time to take a good look at it.\"  \"Do you like it, father?\" came from three different voices at once.  \"Do I like it? You can just bet I do,\" said Langshaw emphatically. He bent and kissed the three upturned faces, and leaned toward his wife afterward to press her sweet waiting lips with his; but his eyes, as if drawn by a magnet, were only on the rod--not the mere bundle of sticks he might have bought, but transformed into one blossoming with love.  \"And do you know, we hardly saw a thing of him all day!\" Clytie proudly recounted afterward to her sister. \"My dear, he would hardly take time to eat his dinner or speak to any one; he was out in the back yard with Henry Wickersham and Mr. Hendon until dark, flapping that rod in circles--the silliest thing! He nearly sent a hook into George's eye once. George acted as bewitched as he did. Joe kept telling every single person who came along that it was 'a present from his wife and the kids.' He certainly showed that he was pleased.\"  \"It's been a pretty nice day, hasn't it?\" Langshaw said to his wife that Christmas night when the children were at last in bed. \"Best Christmas I ever had! To think of you and the kids doing all this for me.\"  His hand rested lovingly on the rod, now once again swathed in the gray linen bag. He would have been the last to realize that, in his humble way, he typified a diviner Fatherhood to the little family who trusted in his care for them--for all things came of him, and of his own had they given him."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14958"],["title","Mother West Wind 'Why' Stories (#1)"],["body","Mother Nature's eyes twinkled as she said:  \"'There's a stripe for every tear made in your old coat by the claws of Mr. Bob Cat the day you saved Mr. Meadow Mouse. They are honor stripes, and hereafter you and your children and your children's children shall always wear stripes.'  \"And that is how it happens that Striped Chipmunk comes by his striped coat, and why he is so proud of it, and takes such good care of it,\" concluded Grandfather Frog.     II  WHY PETER RABBIT CANNOT FOLD HIS HANDS   Happy Jack Squirrel sat with his hands folded across his white waistcoat. He is very fond of sitting with his hands folded that way. A little way from him sat Peter Rabbit. Peter was sitting up very straight, but his hands dropped right down in front. Happy Jack noticed it.  \"Why don't you fold your hands the way I do, Peter Rabbit?\" shouted Happy Jack.  \"I--I--don't want to,\" stammered Peter.  \"You mean you can't!\" jeered Happy Jack.  Peter pretended not to hear, and a few minutes later he hopped away towards the dear Old Briar-patch, lipperty-lipperty-lip. Happy Jack watched him go, and there was a puzzled look in Happy Jack's eyes.  \"I really believe he can't fold his hands,\" said Happy Jack to himself, but speaking aloud.  \"He can't, and none of his family can,\" said a gruff voice.  Happy Jack turned to find Old Mr. Toad sitting in the Lone Little Path.  \"Why not?\" asked Happy Jack.  \"Ask Grandfather Frog; he knows,\" replied Old Mr. Toad, and started on about his business.  And this is how it happens that Grandfather Frog told this story to the little meadow and forest people gathered around him on the bank of the Smiling Pool.  \"Chug-a-rum!\" said Grandfather Frog. \"Old Mr. Rabbit, the grandfather a thousand times removed of Peter Rabbit, was always getting into trouble. Yes, Sir, old Mr. Rabbit was always getting into trouble. Seemed like he wouldn't be happy if he couldn't get into trouble. It was all because he was so dreadfully curious about other people's business, just as Peter Rabbit is now. It seemed that he was just born to be curious and so, of course, to get into trouble.  \"One day word came to the Green Forest and to the Green Meadows that Old Mother Nature was coming to see how all the little meadow and forest people were getting along, to settle all the little troubles and fusses between them, and to find out who were and who were not obeying the orders she had given them when she had visited them last. My, my, my, such a hurrying and scurrying and worrying as there was! You see, everybody wanted to look his best when Old Mother Nature arrived, Yes, Sir, everybody wanted to look his best.  \"There was the greatest changing of clothes you ever did see. Old King Bear put on his blackest coat. Mr. Coon and Mr. Mink and Mr. Otter sat up half the night brushing their suits and making them look as fine and handsome as they could. Even Old Mr. Toad put on a new suit under his old one, and planned to pull the old one off and throw it away as soon as Old Mother Nature should arrive. Then everybody began to fix up their homes and make them as neat and nice as they knew how--everybody but Mr. Rabbit.  \"Now Mr. Rabbit was lazy. He didn't like to work any more than Peter Rabbit does now. No, Sir, old Mr. Rabbit was afraid of work. The very sight of work scared old Mr. Rabbit. You see, he was so busy minding other people's business that he didn't have time to attend to his own. So his brown and gray coat always was rumpled and tumbled and dirty. His house was a tumble-down affair in which no one but Mr. Rabbit would ever have thought of living, and his garden--oh, dear me, such a garden you never did see! It was all weeds and brambles. They filled up the yard, and old Mr. Rabbit actually couldn't have gotten into his own house if he hadn't cut a path through the brambles.  \"Now when old Mr. Rabbit heard that Old Mother Nature was coming, his heart sank way, way down, for he knew just how angry she would be when she saw his house, his garden and his shabby suit.  \"'Oh, dear! Oh, dear! What shall I do?' wailed Mr. Rabbit, wringing his hands.  \"'Get busy and clean up,' advised Mr. Woodchuck, hurrying about his own work.  \"Now Mr. Woodchuck was a worker and very, very neat. He meant to have his home looking just as fine as he could make it. He brought up some clean yellow sand from deep down in the ground and sprinkled it smoothly over his doorstep.  \"'I'll help you, if I get through my own work in time,' shouted Mr. Woodchuck over his shoulder.  \"That gave Mr. Rabbit an idea. He would ask all his neighbors to help him, and perhaps then he could get his house and garden in order by the time Old Mother Nature arrived. So Mr. Rabbit called on Mr. Skunk and Mr. Coon and Mr. Mink and Mr. Squirrel and Mr. Chipmunk, and all the rest of his neighbors, telling them of his trouble and asking them to help. Now, in spite of the trouble Mr. Rabbit was forever making for other people by his dreadful curiosity and meddling with other people's affairs, all his neighbors had a warm place in their hearts for Mr. Rabbit, and they all promised that they would help him as soon as they had their own work finished.  \"Instead of hurrying home and getting to work himself, Mr. Rabbit stopped a while after each call and sat with his arms folded, watching the one he was calling on work. Mr. Rabbit was very fond of sitting with folded arms. It was very comfortable. But this was no time to be doing it, and Mr. Skunk told him so.  \"'If you want the rest of us to help you, you'd better get things started yourself,' said old Mr. Skunk, carefully combing out his big, plumy tail.  \"'That's right, Mr. Skunk! That's right!' said Mr. Rabbit, starting along briskly, just as if he was going to hurry right home and begin work that very instant.  \"But half an hour later, when Mr. Skunk happened to pass the home of Mr. Chipmunk, there sat Mr. Rabbit with his arms folded, watching Mr. Chipmunk hurrying about as only Mr. Chipmunk can.  \"Finally Mr. Rabbit had made the round of all his friends and neighbors, and he once more reached his tumble-down house. 'Oh, dear,' sighed Mr. Rabbit, as he looked at the tangle of brambles which almost hid the little old house, 'I never, never can clear away all this! It will be a lot easier to work when all my friends are here to help,' So he sighed once more and folded his arms, instead of beginning work as he should have done. And then, because the sun was bright and warm, and he was very, very comfortable, old Mr. Rabbit began to nod, and presently he was fast asleep.  \"Now Old Mother Nature likes to take people by surprise, and it happened that she chose this very day to make her promised visit. She was greatly pleased with all she saw as she went along, until she came to the home of Mr. Rabbit.  \"'Mercy me!' exclaimed Old Mother Nature, throwing up her hands as she saw the tumble-down house almost hidden by the brambles and weeds. 'Can it be possible that any one really lives here?'  Then, peering through the tangle of brambles, she spied old Mr. Rabbit sitting on his broken-down doorstep with his arms folded and fast asleep.  \"At first she was very indignant, oh, very indignant, indeed! She decided that Mr. Rabbit should be punished very severely. But as she watched him sitting there, dreaming in the warm sunshine, her anger began to melt away. The fact is, Old Mother Nature was like all the rest of Mr. Rabbit's neighbors--she just couldn't help loving happy-go-lucky Mr. Rabbit in spite of all his faults. With a long stick she reached in and tickled the end of his nose.  \"Mr. Rabbit sneezed, and this made him wake up. He yawned and blinked, and then his eyes suddenly flew wide open with fright. He had discovered Old Mother Nature frowning at him. She pointed a long forefinger at him and said:      'In every single blessed day      There's time for work and time for play.      Who folds his arms with work undone      Doth cheat himself and spoil his fun.'  \"'Hereafter, Mr. Rabbit, you and your children and your children's children will never again be able to sit with folded arms until you or they have learned to work.'  \"And that is why Peter Rabbit cannot fold his arms and still lives in a tumble-down house among the brambles,\" concluded Grandfather Frog.     III  WHY UNC' BILLY POSSUM PLAYS DEAD   One thing puzzled Peter Rabbit and Johnny Chuck and Striped Chipmunk a great deal after they had come to know Unc' Billy Possum and his funny ways. They had talked it over and wondered and wondered about it, and tried to understand it, and even had asked Unc' Billy about it. Unc' Billy had just grinned and said that they would have to ask his mammy. Of course they couldn't do that, and Unc' Billy knew they couldn't, for Unc' Billy's mammy had died long before he even thought of coming up from Ol' Virginny to the Green Forest and the Green Meadows where they lived. He said it just to tease them, and when he said it, he chuckled until they chuckled too, just as if it really were the best kind of a joke.  Now you know it always is the thing that you try and try to find out and can't find out that you most want to find out. It was just so with Peter Rabbit and Johnny Chuck and Striped Chipmunk. The more they talked about it, the more they wanted to know. Why was it that Unc' Billy Possum played dead instead of trying to run away when he was surprised by his enemies? They always tried to run away. So did everybody else of their acquaintance excepting Unc' Billy Possum.  \"There must be a reason\" said Peter gravely, as he pulled thoughtfully at one of his long ears.  \"Of course there is a reason,\" asserted Johnny Chuck, chewing the end of a blade of grass.  \"There's a reason for everything,\" added Striped Chipmunk, combing out the hair of his funny little tail.  \"Then of course Grandfather Frog knows it,\" said Peter.  \"Of course! Why didn't we think of him before?\" exclaimed the others.  \"I'll beat you to the Smiling Pool!\" shouted "]]]
