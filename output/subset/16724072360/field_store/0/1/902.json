Captain Sedley, who watched over the welfare of the club with paternal interest, had endeavored, during the winter that was now past, to render it effectual in developing the moral and mental capacities of the members. He had given such a direction to the exercises in Zephyr Hall as he thought would best attain this end. One of the greatest difficulties with which he had been obliged to contend was the want of individuality in the boys. Each was disposed to \"pin his faith\" upon others. They would not think for themselves, and exercise an independent judgment. Like thousands in the great world, they \"went with the crowd;\" thought, acted, voted, with the majority.  Frank saw the operation of this motive in the \"informal vote\" which had just been taken; and he was tolerably certain that he could bring them all over to the other side, by indicating his own preference.  Calling Fred Harper to the chair again, he opened the discussion by offering a simile, which, being a parallel case, certainly gave the question an entirely new aspect.  \"At the Rippleton Academy three gold medals and three silver medals are awarded, every year, for the best scholarship and deportment. Is that gambling?\"  \"No,\" replied half a dozen voices.  \"Well, we are to row, in like manner for a prize. We don't put up money as a stake; the party that gets beaten does not lose anything.\"  \"That makes a difference,\" added Charles.  \"But the prizes in the Academy are given to make the scholars get their lessons well--to stimulate them in doing their duty,\" said William Bright.  \"Very true;\" and Frank saw, in the faces of the members, that the current had again set in another direction. \"But we only want to prove that rowing for the prize is not gambling.\"  \"That's all,\" said Charles.  \"The Agricultural Society offers premiums for the best horses, cows, oxen.\"  \"That's to improve stock,\" answered William. \"Boat racing can only be for amusement.\"  \"The Horticultural Society gives premiums for the prettiest flowers,\" added Frank; \"and my father got one of them last summer.\"  The boys were staggered again.  \"Flowers are cultivated for amusement; at any rate, we don't eat them, or drink them, or sleep on them,\" continued Frank.    \"Your bed shall be roses, besprinkled with dew.\"  added Fred, who never missed his joke. \"Besides, we sleep on poppies. They are a sleepy plant, you know.\"  \"But the real question,\" said Frank, \"is, whether racing for a prize will not excite hard and envious feelings in the members of the two clubs. I hope we shall think well of it before we vote; and for that purpose, Mr. Chairman, I move a recess of half an hour.\"  The motion was carried, and the boys talked the matter over till the meeting was called to order again.  \"Question!\" called several voices.  The vote was immediately taken, and it stood nine in favor and two opposed to the proposition. And so, on the part of the Zephyr, the offer was accepted.  The club then adjourned for an excursion on the lake.     CHAPTER III.  ALL ABOARD!   The club had taken their seats in the boat, and were waiting the orders of the coxswain to haul her out of her berth, when Captain Sedley made his appearance.  \"You are short-handed, Frank,\" said he, as he observed Tony's vacant seat.  \"Yes, sir; but we have elected a member to fill that place,\" replied Frank, as he jumped out of the boat, and hastened to inform his father of what the club had done.  The members all felt a deep interest in the result of this conference; and though this was the first excursion of the season, they forgot for the time the pleasure before them in their desire to know whether the \"director\" would approve their action in relation to the new member and the prize.  Frank and his father entered the club-room together.  \"Now, my son, what have you done?\" asked Captain Sedley.  \"We have discussed both questions to the best of our ability,\" replied Frank, with some hesitation.  \"Well, what was the result?\"  \"We have elected Tim to fill Tony's place.\"  \"Indeed!\"  \"We have; and we await your sanction to our doings.\"  \"Did you think I would sanction such a choice as that?\"  \"I didn't know. We have fairly considered the matter; have faithfully examined both sides of the question. If we have done wrong, you know, father, that you have a veto upon our doings.\"  Captain Sedley smiled at the matter-of-fact, business-like earnestness of his son. He felt quite as much interest in the action of the boys as they did to learn his opinion of it.  \"Tim is a very bad boy,\" said he.  \"He _was_; but he has solemnly promised to amend, and become a good boy,\" answered Frank, warmly.  \"Not much dependence can be placed upon the promises of such boys as Tim.\"  \"But if no one encourages him to become better, he will not be likely to improve much, especially when everybody despises and shuns him.\"  \"There is danger that he may corrupt the rest of the club.\"  \"He must obey the requirements of the constitution, or he cannot long continue to be a member.\"  \"You are right, Frank; I approve your action in this matter, but I should like to know the grounds upon which you admitted him.\"  Frank gave him a brief synopsis of the debate, and the anxious father expressed himself well pleased with the liberal views of the club.  \"Men might be oftener reformed in the great world, if people would only give them a chance to be respectable, as you have done with Tim,\" said Captain Sedley. \"But what have you done about the prize?\"  \"We have voted to accept the offer of the gentlemen,\" answered Frank, rather doubtfully, as he looked earnestly into the face of his father, to discover the effect of his intelligence.  \"I hope you looked on both sides of this question, as well as the other.\"  \"We did, father.\"  Frank stated the different opinions that had been expressed by the members during the debate, and the fact that they had informally given a unanimous vote against it. Captain Sedley was much amused by the narration, in spite of the disappointment he felt at the ill success of his efforts to make the boys reason for themselves.  \"I think your view is correct, Frank; though I am aware that many mature minds would arrive at a different conclusion. As you say, the envy and ill will which the contest may excite are the evils most to be dreaded.\"  \"Then you approve our decision?\"  \"I do.\"  Frank felt as happy at that moment as though he had been a general of division, and had won a great victory. The consciousness of having arrived, unaided by mature minds, at a correct conclusion, was a triumph in itself. He had exercised his thought, and it had borne him to a right judgment. He was proud of his achievement, and hastened back to the boat with the intelligence of the approval.  \"What does he say?\" asked half a dozen of the members.  \"Let us get off first, and then we will talk about it,\" replied Frank. \"Bowman, let go the painter; cast off the stern lines, there. Now, back her--steady.\"  \"Tell us about it, Frank,\" said Charles Hardy, as the Zephyr glided clear of the boat-house, out upon the deep waters of the lake.  \"Ready--up!\" continued Frank, and the eleven oars were poised perpendicularly in the air.  \"Down!\"  The members had already begun to feel the inspiration of their favorite amusement, and there appeared to have been nothing lost by the season of inactivity which had passed away. They were as prompt and as perfect in the drill as though they had practised it every day during the winter. Although it was a moment of excitement, there was no undue haste; every member seemed to be perfectly cool.  \"Ready--pull!\"  And the broad blades dipped in the water, and bent before the vigorous arms of the youthful oarsmen.  \"Starboard oars, cease rowing--back!\" continued the coxswain, with admirable dignity and self-possession; and the Zephyr, acted upon by this maneuver, came about as though upon a pivot, without going either backward or forward.  \"Starboard oars, steady--pull!\" and the rowers indicated by this command caught the stroke, and the light bark shot ahead, with her wonted speed, in the direction of Rippleton village.  \"Zephyr, ahoy!\" shouted some one from the shore.  \"Tim Bunker--ain't it?\" asked Charles.  \"Yes.\"  \"Humph! he needn't hail us like that. I was sure your father would never permit him to join the club,\" continued Charles, who fancied that he read in Frank's expression the disapproval of his father.  \"You are in the wrong, Charley.\"  \"Am I?\"  \"You are; my father cordially approved our action. Now, Zephyrs, I am going up to Flat Rock to take him aboard; and I hope every fellow will treat him well--just as though he had never done anything out of the way. What do you say?\"  \"We will,\" they replied, with one voice.  \"And then, if he does not walk straight, it will not be our fault. Treat him as though he was the best fellow among us. Let nothing tempt us to forget it.\"  Frank headed the boat towards the rock in the grove, and in a moment the bow touched it.  Without waiting for an invitation, Tim jumped into the boat, and took the vacant seat. Frank did not much like this forwardness: it was a little too \"brazen\" to comport with his ideas of true penitence. But he did not care to humble the \"Bunker;\" so he said nothing that would wound his feelings.  \"We are glad to see you, Tim; the club has this day elected you a member, and our director has approved the vote,\" said Frank.  \"Has he?\" replied Tim, with a broad grin.  \"And, if you like, we will go up to the boat-house, where you may sign the constitution.\"  \"Yes, I'll sign it,\" answered Tim, more as though it would be conferring a favor on the club than as a duty he owed to his new friends.  Frank gave the necessary orders to get the boat under way again. Tim handled his oar with considerable skill, and before they reached the boat-house, he had learned to time his stroke with that of his"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15003"],["title","Draft of a Plan for Beginning Animal Sanctuaries in Labrador (#1)"],["body","Bay; MR. CLIVE-PHILLIPPS-WOLLEY, author of standard books on big game in the _Badminton Library_ and elsewhere; MR. THOMPSON SETON, whose _Life-history of Northern Mammals_ is the best work of its kind on the area to which the Labrador peninsula belongs; MAJOR STEVENSON HAMILTON, superintendent of the great Government Game Reserves in South Africa; and MR. ALFRED RUSSEL WALLACE, whose original and creative work on the theory of evolution inseparably connects him with his friend Darwin for all time to come, who is now the last of the giants of the Victorian age, and who is the founder and greatest exponent of the science of zoogeography, which has a special bearing on Labrador.  Among the experts on the public aspects of the question were:--MR. BRYCE, who has been an ardent lover of the wilds throughout his distinguished career on both sides of the Atlantic; LORD GREY, who paid special attention to the subject during his journey to Hudson Bay in 1910; MR. KIPLING, whose _Jungle Books_ revealed the soul of wild life to so many readers; and MR. ROOSEVELT, a sportsman-naturalist of world-wide fame, during whose Presidential terms more wild-life conservation was effected in the United States than during all other Presidential terms put together, before or since.  To this I am graciously permitted to add that HIS MAJESTY THE KING was pleased to manifest his interest in the subject by taking the _Address_ with him to read on his way to India; and that HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS THE DUKE OF CONNAUGHT, Governor-General, who has shown his own keen interest on several occasions, has marked his approval by writing the following letter for publication here:--        Dear Colonel Wood,       I have been reading with the greatest interest your      address on Animal Sanctuaries in Labrador and also the      draft of the Supplement which you were good enough to      send me for perusal. You have certainly been so far      rewarded for your trouble by having collected a great      weight of testimony and of valuable opinions, all      endorsing the useful cause to which you are devoting      yourself.       I know from reports that many varieties of game, which      were threatened with extinction in South Africa ten years      ago, have, by the timely establishment of game reserves,      been saved, and are now relatively numerous. I may add      that this end has not been obtained simply by the      establishment of the reserves and by the passing of      game-laws, but by enforcing those laws in the most rigid      manner and by appointing the right men to enforce them.       From personal experience I know what the game reserves      have done for East Africa. In these reserves the wild      animals are left to breed and live in peace, undisturbed      by any one but the game-warden. From them the overflow      drifts out into the surrounding districts and provides a      plentiful supply for the hunter and settler. What has      been done in Africa could be done in Canada and      elsewhere. You have so much land which is favourable to      birds and beasts, though unfavourable to the settler,      that it would seem to be no hardship to give up a      suitable area or areas for the purpose of a reserve.      This, with the infliction of heavy penalties for the      ruthless destruction of animal life, should secure a      fresh lease of existence for the various species whose      extermination now appears to be imminent.       Please accept my best wishes for the success of your      work, in which you may always count upon my greatest      sympathy.       Believe me,       Yours truly,       ARTHUR.     II. VERIFICATION.   In order to make quite sure about conditions up to date, I spent two months last summer examining some 1500 miles of coast line, from Nova Scotia, round by Newfoundland to the Straits, and thence inwards along the Canadian Labrador and North Shore of the St. Lawrence. On the whole, I found that I had rather under- than over-stated the dangers threatening the wild life there, and that I had nothing to retract from what I said in my _Address_ and _Supplement_.  As I spent one month among the fishermen of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland, who commit most of the depredations, and the other month among the people along the Canadian Labrador, on whom the depredations are committed, I enjoyed the advantage of hearing both sides of the story. It was very much what I had heard before and what I said it was. The argument is, that so long as there is no law, or no law put in force, every man will do what he likes--which is unanswerably true. I am also afraid that there is no practical answer to the logical deduction from this, that so long as bad men can do what they like good men must do the same or \"get left\". Good, bad and indifferent, all alike, are squandering the capital of the wild life as fast as they can, though the legitimate interest of it would soon yield far better returns if conservation was to replace the beggaring methods in vogue to-day.  I would urge the earliest possible extension of thoroughly well enforced wild-life conservation laws to the whole Labrador peninsula; and I would venture to remind the Commission again, as I did in my _Supplement_, that the wild life of Arctic Canada is even now in danger and ought to be efficiently protected before it is too late. But, for the present purpose, I shall revert to Labrador only; and, for a practical beginning, recommend the immediate adoption of conservation only in the \"Canadian Labrador\".  So far as I could judge from talking things over with the south coast trappers, most of the fur-bearing animals seem to be holding their own fairly well in the market. But it should be remembered that, with the recent great rise in prices, fewer skins may mean more money, and that even the establishment of fox farms, and the probable establishment of other fur farms, may not overtake the present increasing demand, which, in its turn, must tend to deplete the original source of supply still further, unless strict conservation is enforced. There was a wonderful supply of foxes a year ago, though nothing to the muskrats which swarmed down south last fall. But failure of food further north may have had more to do with those irruptions than any outburst of unusual fecundity. Caribou apparently remain much as they have been lately. But the hunger of wolves and the greed of men are two enemies that nothing but conservation can keep in check. Of course, genuinely \"necessary food\" is not at all in question. I know an old hunter, living at Pokkashoo in summer and St. Augustine in winter, who brought in sixteen caribou last season. But he gave fifteen away to really necessitous families and kept only one for himself.  The whale factories at Lark Harbour and Hawke Bay, on the west coast of Newfoundland, were both closed for want of whales. The only one in the Gulf that was working last year was at Seven Islands, on the North Shore, 300 miles below Quebec. I happened to be almost in at the death of the biggest finback ever taken. But, speaking generally, the season was not really prosperous. The station of Seven Islands is worked by Norwegians, who are the most exterminatingly efficient whalers in the world. They worked their own whaleries to exhaustion and raised so much feeling against them among the fishermen that the Norwegian government forbad every factory along the shore. They then invented floating factories, which may still be used in Canadian waters with deadly effect unless we put whaling under conservation. The feeling among the fishermen here is the same as elsewhere, strongly in favour of the whales and strongly against the exterminating kind of whaler, because whales are believed to drive the bait fish close inshore, which is very \"handy\" for the fishermen.  The spring sealing of 1912 was a failure on the Canadian Labrador, as the main \"harp\" herd was missed by just one day. The whole industry is carried on by Newfoundlanders and men whose vessels take their catch to Newfoundland, because the only working plant is concentrated there. The excessive spring kill greatly depletes the females and young, as it takes place in the whelping season, when the herds are moving north along the off-shore ice; and this depletion naturally spoils not only the Newfoundlanders' permanent industry itself but the much smaller inshore autumn catch by our own Canadian Labradorians, when the herds are moving south. The Canadians along the North Shore and Labrador look upon the invading Newfoundlanders, in this and other pursuits, very much as a farmer looks upon a gipsy whose horse comes grazing in his hayfield. And the analogy sometimes does hold good. When men under a different government, men who do not own a foot of land in Canada, men who do not pay specific taxes for Canadian rights, when these men slaughter seals on inshore ice, use land and inlets for cleaning fish and foul the water with their \"gurry\", and when they also \"egg\" on other peoples' islands in defiance of the law, then the analogy is perfect. It does not hold good, of course, in ordinary fishing, which is conducted under Dominion licence and vigilantly watched by Commander Wakeham. But whether Canada is not giving away too much for what she gets in licences is quite another question.  The excessive spring kill by the Newfoundlanders does not seem to be the only reason why the local seal hunt is not so good as it used to be. The whites complain that the Indians along the coast kill an undue number of seals on the one hand and of caribou on the other. But fishermen all the world over are against the harbour seals; and generally exaggerate their depredations, as they exaggerate the depredations of most kinds of seabirds. Whatever the fate of the harbour seals should be, there can be no doubt that the harps or Greenland seals, the bearded or square-flippers, the grey or horseheads, and the gigantic and magnificently"]]]
