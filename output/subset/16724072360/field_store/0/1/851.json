And the glossy brown cows were so gentle   That they moved at the touch of his hand O'er the wonderful, rosy-red meadow,   And they stood at the word of command.  6. So he led all his sheep to the pasture,   And his cows, by the side of the brook; Though it rained, yet the rain never pattered   O'er the beautiful way that they took.  7. And it was n't in Fairyland either,   But a house in the midst of the town, Where Roy, as he looked from the window,   Saw the silvery drops trickle down.     THIRD READER.  15  8. For his pasture was only a table,    With its cover so flowery fair, And his brooklet was just a green ribbon,    That his sister had lost from her hair.  9. And his cows were but glossy horse-chestnuts,    That had grown on his grandfather's tree; And his sheep only snowy-white pebbles,    He had brought from the shore of the sea.  10. And at length when the shepherd was weary,    And had taken his milk and his bread, And his mother had kissed him and tucked him,    And had bid him \"good night\" in his bed;  11. Then there entered his big brother Walter,    While the shepherd was soundly asleep, And he cut up the cows into baskets,    And to jackstones turned all of the sheep.  Emily S. Oakey.  LESSON II.   JOHNNY'S FIRST SNOWSTORM.  1. Johnny Reed was a little boy who never had seen a snowstorm till he was six years old. Before this, he had lived in a warm country, where the sun shines down on beautiful   16  ECLECTIC SERIES. orange groves, and fields always sweet with  flowers. 2. But now he had come to visit his grandmother, who lived where the snow falls in winter. Johnny was standing at the window when the snow came down.  3. \"O mamma!\" he cried, joyfully, \"do come quick, and see these little white birds flying down from heaven.\" 4. \"They are not birds, Johnny,\" said mamma, smiling. 5. \"Then maybe the little angels are losing their feathers! Oh! do tell me what it is; is it sugar? Let me taste it,\" said    THIRD READER.  17 Johnny. But when he tasted it, he gave a little jump--it was so cold. 6. \"That is only snow, Johnny,\" said his mother. 7.  \"What is snow, mother?\" 8. \"The snowflakes, Johnny, are little drops of water that fall from the clouds. But the air through which they pass is so cold it freezes them, and they come down turned into snow.\" 9. As she said this, she brought out an old black hat from the closet. \"See, Johnny! I have caught a snowflake on this hat. Look quick through this glass, and you will see how beautiful it is.\" 10. Johnny looked through the glass. There lay the pure, feathery snowflake like a lovely little star. 11. \"Twinkle, twinkle, little star!\" he cried in delight. \"Oh! please show me more snow-flakes, mother.\" 12. So his mother caught several more, and they were all beautiful. 13. The next day Johnny had a fine play in the snow, and when he carne in, he said, \"I love snow; and I think snowballs are a great deal prettier than oranges.\"   3,   18  ECLECTIC SERIES.  LESSON III.    LET IT RAIN.  Rose. See how it rains! Oh dear, dear, dear! how dull it is! Must I stay in doors all day? Father. Why, Rose, are you sorry that you had any bread and butter for breakfast, this morning? Rose. Why, father, what a question! I should be sorry, indeed, if I could not get any. Father. Are you sorry, my daughter, when you see the flowers and the trees growing in the garden? Rose. Sorry? No, indeed. Just now, I wished very much to go out and see them,--they look so pretty. Father. Well, are you sorry when you see the horses, cows, or sheep drinking at the brook to quench their thirst? Rose. Why, father, you must think I am a cruel girl, to wish that the poor horses that work so hard, the beautiful cows that    THIRD READER.  19 give so much nice milk, and the pretty lambs should always be thirsty. Father. Do you not think they would die, if they had no water to drink? Rose. Yes, sir, I am sure they would. How shocking to think of such a thing! Father. I thought little Rose was sorry it rained. Do you think the trees and flowers would grow, if they never had any water on them? Rose. No, indeed, father, they would be dried up by the sun. Then we should not have any pretty flowers to look at, and to make wreaths of for mother. Father. I thought you were sorry it rained. Rose, what is our bread made of? Rose. It is made of flour, and the flour is made from wheat, which is ground in the mill. Father. Yes, Rose, and it was rain that helped to make the wheat grow, and it was water that turned the mill to grind the wheat. I thought little Rose was sorry it rained. Rose. I did not think of all these things, father. I am truly very glad to see the rain falling.   20  ECLECTIC SERIES.  LESSON IV.   CASTLE-BUILDING.  1. \"O pussy!\" cried Herbert, in a voice of anger and dismay, as the blockhouse he was building fell in sudden ruin. The playful cat had rubbed against his mimic castle,    THIRD READER.  21 and tower and wall went rattling down upon the floor. 2. Herbert took up one of the blocks and threw it fiercely at pussy. Happily, it passed over her and did no harm. His hand was reaching for another block, when his little sister Hetty sprang toward the cat, and caught her up. 3. \"No, no, no!\" said she, \"you sha'n't hurt pussy! She did n't mean to do it!\" 4. Herbert's passion was over quickly, and, sitting down upon the floor, he covered his face with his hands, and began to cry. 5. \"What a baby!\" said Joe, his elder brother, who was reading on the sofa. \"Crying over spilled milk does no good. Build it up again.\" 6. \"No, I won't,\" said Herbert, and he went on crying. 7. \"What's all the trouble here?\" exclaimed papa, as he opened the door and came in. 8. \"Pussy just rubbed against Herbert's castle, and it fell down,\" answered Hetty. \"But she did n't mean to do it; she did n't know it would fall, did she, papa?\" 9. \"Why, no! And is that all the trouble?\"   22  ECLECTIC SERIES. 10. \"Herbert!\" his papa called, and held out his hands. \"Come.\" The little boy got up from the floor, and came slowly, his eyes full of tears, and stood by his father. 11. \"There is a better way than this, my boy,\" said papa. \"If you had taken that way, your heart would have been light already. I should have heard you singing over your blocks instead of crying. Shall I show you that way?\" 12. Herbert nodded his head, and papa sat down on the floor by the pile of blocks, with his little son by his side, and began to lay the foundation for a new castle.  LESSON V.    CASTLE-BUILDING. (CONCLUDED)  1. Soon, Herbert was as much interested in castle-building as he had been a little while before. He began to sing over his work. All his trouble was gone.    THIRD READER.  23 2. \"This is a great deal better than crying, is n't it?\" said papa. 3. \"Crying for what?\" asked Herbert, forgetting his grief of a few minutes before. 4. \"Because pussy knocked your castle over.\" 5. \"Oh!\" A shadow flitted across his face, but was gone in a moment, and he went on building as eagerly as ever. 6. \"I told him not to cry over spilled milk,\" said Joe, looking down from his place on the sofa. 7. \"I wonder if you did n't cry when your kite string broke,\" retorted Herbert. 8. \"Losing a kite is quite another thing,\" answered Joe, a little dashed. \"The kite was gone forever; but your blocks were as good as before, and you had only to build again.\" 9. \"I do n't see,\" said papa, \"that crying was of any more use in your case then in Herbert's. Sticks and paper are easily found, and you had only to go to work and make another kite.\" Joe looked down at his book, and went on reading. By this time the castle was finished. 10. \"It is ever so much nicer than the one   24  ECLECTIC SERIES. pussy knocked down,\" said Hetty. And so thought Herbert, as he looked at it proudly from all sides. 11. \"If pussy knocks that down, I'll-\" 12. \"Build it up again,\" said papa, finishing the sentence for his little boy.  13. \"But, papa, pussy must not knock my castles down. I can't have it,\" spoke out Herbert, knitting his forehead. 14. \"You must watch her, then. Little boys, as well as grown up people, have to be often on their guard. If you go into the street, you have to look out for the carriages, so as not to be run over, and you have to keep out of people's way. 15. \"In the house, if you go about heedlessly, you will be very apt to run against some one. I have seen a careless child dash suddenly into a room just as a servant was leaving it with a tray of dishes in her hands. A crash followed.\"    THIRD READER.  25 16.  \"It was I, was n't it?\" said Hetty. 17.  \"Yes, I believe it was, and I hope it will never happen again.\" 18. Papa now left the room, saying, \"I do n't want any more of this crying over spilled milk, as Joe says. If your castles get knocked down, build them up again.\"  LESSON VI.    LEND A HAND.         26  ECLECTIC SERIES.         THIRD READER.  27  LESSON VII.    THE TRUANT. 1. James Brown was ten years old when his parents sent him to school. It was not far from his home, and therefore they sent him by himself. 2. But, instead of going to school, he was in the habit of playing truant. He would go into the fields, or spend his time with idle boys. 3. But this was not all. When he went home, he would falsely tell his mother that he had been to school, and had said his lessons very well. 4. One fine morning, his mother told James to make haste home from school, for she wished, after he had come back, to take him to his aunt's. 5. But, instead of minding her, he went off to the water, where there were some boats. There he met plenty of idle boys. 6. Some of these boys found that James   28  ECLECTIC SERIES, had money, which his aunt had given him; and he was led by them to hire a boat, and to go with them upon the water. 7. Little did James think of the danger into which he was running. Soon the wind began to blow, and none of them knew how to manage the boat.  8. For some time, they struggled against the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14766"],["title","McGuffey's Third Eclectic Reader (#2)"],["body","and the tide. At last, they became so tired that they could row no longer. 9. A large wave upset the boat, and they were all thrown into the water. Think of James Brown, the truant, at this time! 10. He was far from home, known by no one. His parents were ignorant of his danger.   THIRD READER.  29 He was struggling in the water, on the point of being drowned. 11. Some men, however, saw the boys, and went out to them in a boat. They reached them just in time to save them from a watery grave. 12. They were taken into a house, where their clothes were dried. After a while, they were sent home to their parents. 13. James was very sorry for his conduct, and he was never known to be guilty of the same thing again. 14. He became regular at school, learned to attend to his books, and, above all, to obey his parents perfectly.  LESSON VIII.    THE WHITE KITTEN.  1.  My little white kitten's asleep on my knee; As white as the snow or the lilies is she;     She wakes up with a pur     When I stroke her soft fur: Was there ever another white kitten like her?   30  ECLECTIC SERIES.  2.  My little white kitten now wants to go out And frolic, with no one to watch her about;     \"Little kitten,\" I say,    \"Just an hour you may stay, And be careful in choosing your places to play.\"    3. But night has come down, when I hear a loud \"mew;\" I open the door, and my kitten comes through;     My white kitten! ah me!     Can it really be she-- This ill-looking, beggar-like cat that I see?  4. What ugly, gray streaks on her side and her back! Her nose, once as pink as a rosebud, is black!     Oh, I very well know,     Though she does not say so, She has been where white kittens ought never to go.    THIRD READER.  31  5. If little good children intend to do right, If little white kittens would keep themselves white,     It is needful that they     Should this counsel obey, And be careful in choosing their places to play.  LESSON IX.   THE BEAVER.  1. The beaver is found chiefly in North America. It is about three and a half feet long, including the flat, paddle- shaped tail, which is a foot in length. 2. The long, shining hair on the back is chestnut-colored, while the fine, soft fur that lies next the skin, is grayish brown. 3. Beavers build themselves most curious huts to live in, and quite frequently a great number of these huts are placed close together, like the buildings in a town. 4. They always build their huts on the banks of rivers or lakes, for they swim much   32  ECLECTIC SERIES. more easily than they walk, and prefer moving about in the water. 5. When they build on the bank of a running stream, they make a dam across the stream for the purpose of keeping the water at the height they wish. 6. These dams are made chiefly of mud, and stones, and the branches of trees. They are sometimes six or seven hundred feet in length, and are so constructed that they look more like the work of man than of little dumb beasts. 7. Their huts are made of the same material as the dams, and are round in shape. The walls are very thick, and the roofs are finished off with a thick layer of mud, sticks, and leaves. 8. They commence building their houses late in the summer, but do not get them finished before the early frosts. The freezing makes them tighter and stronger. 9. They obtain the wood for their dams and huts by gnawing through the branches of trees, and even through the trunks of small ones, with their sharp front teeth. They peel off the bark, and lay it up in store for winter food.   THIRD READER.  33 10. The fur of the beaver is highly prized. The men who hunt these animals are called trappers. 11. A gentleman once saw five young beavers playing. They would leap on the trunk of a tree that lay near a beaver dam, and would push one another off into the water.  12. He crept forward very cautiously, and was about to fire on the little creatures; but their amusing tricks reminded him so much of some little children he knew at home, that he thought it would be inhuman to kill them. So he left them without even disturbing their play.  3,3   34  ECLECTIC SERIES.  LESSON X.    THE YOUNG TEACHER.  1. Charles Rose lived in the country with his father, who taught him to read and to write. 2. Mr. Rose told his son that, when his morning lessons were over, he might amuse himself for one hour as he pleased. 3. There was a river near by. On its bank stood the hut of a poor fisherman, who lived by selling fish. 4. His careful wife kept her wheel going early and late. They both worked very hard to keep themselves above want. 5. But they were greatly troubled lest their only son should never learn to read and to write. They could not teach him themselves, and they were too poor to send him to school. 6. Charles called at the hut of this fisherman one day, to inquire about his dog, which was missing.    THIRD READER.  35 7. He found the little boy, whose name was Joe, sitting by the table, on which he was making marks with a piece of chalk. Charles asked him whether he was drawing pictures.  8. \"No, I am trying to write,\" said little Joe, \"but I know only two words. Those I saw upon a sign, and I am trying to write them.\" 9. \"If I could only learn to read and write,\" said he, \"I should be the happiest boy in the world.\"   36  ECLECTIC SERIES. 10. \"Then I will make you happy,\" said Charles. \"I am only a little boy, but I can teach you that. 11. \"My father gives me an hour every day for myself. Now, if you will try to learn, you shall soon know how to read and to write.\" 12. Both Joe and his mother were ready to fall on their knees to thank Charles. They told him it was what they wished above all things. 13. So, on the next day when the hour came, Charles put his book in his pocket, and went to teach Joe. Joe learned very fast, and Charles soon began to teach him how to write. 14. Some time after, a gentleman called on Mr. Rose, and asked him if he knew where Charles was. Mr. Rose said that he was taking a walk, he supposed. 15. \"I am afraid,\" said the gentleman, \"that he does not always amuse himself thus. I often see him go to the house of the fisherman. I fear he goes out in their boat.\" 16. Mr. Rose was much troubled. He had told Charles that he must never venture on the river, and he thought he could trust him.    THIRD READER.  37 17. The moment the gentleman left, Mr. Rose went in search of his son. He went to the river, and walked up and down, in hope of seeing the boat. 18. Not seeing it, he grew uneasy. He thought Charles must have gone a long way off. Unwilling to leave without learning something of him, he went to the hut. 19. He put his head in at the window, which was open. There a pleasant sight met his eyes. 20. Charles was at the table, ruling a copybook Joe was reading to him, while his mother was spinning in the corner. 21. Charles was a little confused. He feared his father might not be pleased; but he had no need to be uneasy, for his father was delighted. 22. The next day, his father took him to town, and gave him books for himself and Joe, with writing paper, pens, and ink. 23. Charles was the happiest boy in the world when he came home. He ran to Joe, his hands filled with parcels, and his heart beating with joy.   38  ECLECTIC SERIES.  LESSON XI.    THE BLACKSMITH.  1. Clink, clink, clinkerty clink! We begin to hammer at morning's blink, And hammer away Till the busy day, Like us, aweary, to rest shall sink.  2. Clink, clink, clinkerty clink! From labor and care we never will shrink; But our fires we'll blow Till our forges glow With light intense, while our eyelids wink.    THIRD READER.  39  3. Clink, clink, clinkerty clink; The chain we'll forge with many a link. We'll work each form While the iron is warm, With strokes as fast as we can think.  4. Clink, clink, clinkerty clink! Our faces may be as black as ink, But our hearts are true As man ever knew, And kindly of all we shall ever think.  LESSON XII.    A WALK IN THE GARDEN.  1. Frank was one day walking with his mother, when they came to a pretty garden. Frank looked in, and saw that it had clean gravel walks, and beds of beautiful flowers all in bloom. 2. He called to his mother, and said, \"Mother, come and look at this pretty garden. I wish I might open the gate, and walk in.\"   40  ECLECTIC SERIES. 3. The gardener, being near, heard what Frank said, and kindly invited him and his mother to come into the garden. 4. Frank's mother thanked the man. Turning to her son, she said, \"Frank, if I take you to walk in this garden, you must take care not to meddle with anything in it.\"  5. Frank walked along the neat gravel paths, and looked at everything, but touched nothing that he saw. 6. He did not tread on any of the borders, and was careful that his clothes should not brush the tops of the flowers, lest he might break them.    THIRD READER.  41 7. The gardener was much pleased with Frank, because he was so careful not to do mischief. He showed him the seeds, and told him the name of many of the flowers and plants. 8. While Frank was admiring the beauty of a flower, a boy came to the gate, and finding it locked, he shook it hard. But it would not open. Then he said, \"Let me in; let me in; will you not let me in this garden?\" 9. \"No, indeed,\" said the gardener, \"I will not let you in, I assure you; for when I let you in yesterday, you meddled with my flowers, and pulled some of my rare fruit. I do not choose to let a boy into my garden who meddles with the plants.\" 10. The boy looked ashamed, and when he found that the gardener would not let him in, he went slowly away. 11. Frank saw and felt how much happier a boy may be by not meddling with what does not belong to him. 12. He and his mother then continued their walk in the garden, and enjoyed the day very much. Before they left, the gardener gave each of them some pretty flowers.  42  ECLECTIC SERIES.  LESSON XIII.   THE WOLF. 1. A boy was once taking care of some sheep, not far from a forest.
