Wh has a sound accounted peculiar to the English, which the Saxons better expressed by hw, as, what, whence, whiting; in whore only, and sometimes in wholesome, wh is sounded like a simple h.  X.  X begins no English word: it has the sound of ks, as axle, extraneous.  Y.  Y, when it follows a consonant, is a vowel; when it precedes either a vowel or a diphthong, is a consonant, as ye, young. It is thought by some to be in all cases a vowel. But it may be observed of y as of w, that it follows a vowel without any hiatus, as rosy youth.      The chief argument by which w and y appear to be always vowels is, that     the sounds which they are supposed to have as consonants, cannot be     uttered after a vowel, like that of all other consonants; thus we say     tu, ut; do, odd; but in wed, dew; the two sounds of w have no     resemblance to each other.  Z.  Z begins no word originally English; it has the sound, as its name izzard or s hard expresses, of an s uttered with a closer compression of the palate by the tongue, as freeze, froze.      In orthography I have supposed orthoepy, or just utterance of words, to     be included; orthography being only the art of expressing certain     sounds by proper characters. I have therefore observed in what words     any of the letters are mute.      Most of the writers of English grammar have given long tables of words     pronounced otherwise than they are written, and seem not sufficiently     to have considered, that of English, as of all living tongues, there is     a double pronunciation, one cursory and colloquial, the other regular     and solemn. The cursory pronunciation is always vague and uncertain,     being made different in different mouths by negligence, unskilfulness,     or affectation. The solemn pronunciation, though by no means immutable     and permanent, is yet always less remote from the orthography, and less     liable to capricious innovation. They have however generally formed     their tables according to the cursory speech of those with whom they     happened to converse; and concluding that the whole nation combines to     vitiate language in one manner, have often established the jargon of     the lowest of the people as the model of speech.      For pronunciation the best general rule is, to consider those as the     most elegant speakers who deviate least from the written words.      There have been many schemes offered for the emendation and settlement     of our orthography, which, like that of other nations, being formed by     chance, or according to the fancy of the earliest writers in rude ages,     was at first very various and uncertain, and is yet sufficiently     irregular. Of these reformers some have endeavoured to accommodate     orthography better to the pronunciation, without considering that this     is to measure by a shadow, to take that for a model or standard which     is changing while they apply it. Others, less absurdly indeed, but with     equal unlikelihood of success, have endeavoured to proportion the     number of letters to that of sounds, that every sound may have its own     character, and every character a single sound. Such would be the     orthography of a new language, to be formed by a synod of grammarians     upon principles of science. But who can hope to prevail on nations to     change their practice, and make all their old books useless? or what     advantage would a new orthography procure equivalent to the confusion     and perplexity of such an alteration?      Some ingenious men, indeed, have endeavoured to deserve well of their     country, by writing honor and labor for honour and labour, red for read     in the preter-tense, sais for says, repete tor repeat, explane for     explain, or declame for declaim. Of these it may be said, that as they     have done no good they have done little harm; both because they have     innovated little, and because few have followed them.      The English language has properly no dialects; the style of writers has     no professed diversity in the use of words, or of their flexions and     terminations, nor differs but by different degrees of skill or care.     The oral diction is uniform in no spacious country, but has less     variation in England than in most other nations of equal extent. The     language of the northern counties retains many words now out of use,     but which are commonly of the genuine Teutonick race, and is uttered     with a pronunciation which now seems harsh and rough, but was probably     used by our ancestors. The northern speech is therefore not barbarous,     but obsolete. The speech in the western provinces seems to differ from     the general diction rather by a depraved pronunciation, than by any     real difference which letters would express.         *       *       *       *       *  ETYMOLOGY.  Etymology teaches the deduction of one word from another, and the various modifications by which the sense of the same word is diversified; as horse, horses; I love, I loved.  Of the ARTICLE.  The English have two articles, an or a, and the.  AN, A.  A has an indefinite signification, and means one, with some reference to more; as This is a good book; that is, one among the books that are good; He was killed by a sword; that is, some sword; This is a better book for a man than a boy; that is, for one of those that are men than one of those that are boys; An army might enter without resistance; that is, any army.  In the senses in which we use a or an in the singular, we speak in the plural without an article; as these are good books.      I have made an the original article, because it is only the Saxon an,     or æn, one, applied to a new use, as the German ein, and the French un;     the n being cut off before a consonant in the speed of utterance.  Grammarians of the last age direct, that an should be used before h; whence it appears that the English anciently asperated less. An is still used before the silent h; as an herb, an honest man; but otherwise a; as    A horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse.       Shakespeare.  An or a can only be joined with a singular: the correspondent plural is the noun without an article, as, I want a pen, I want pens; or with the pronominal adjective some, as, I want some pens.  THE.  The has a particular and definite signification.                    The fruit   Of that forbidden tree, whose mortal taste   Brought death into the world.       Milton.  That is, that particular fruit, and this world in which we live. So, He giveth fodder for the cattle, and green herbs for the use of man; that is, for those beings that are cattle, and his use that is man.  The is used in both numbers.    I am as free as Nature first made man,   Ere the base laws of servitude began,   When wild in woods the noble savage ran.       Dryden.  Many words are used without articles; as  1. Proper names, as John, Alexander, Longinus, Aristarchus, Jerusalem, Athens, Rome, London. GOD is used as a proper name.  2. Abstract names, as blackness, witch-craft, virtue, vice, beauty, ugliness, love, hatred, anger, good-nature, kindness.  3. Words in which nothing but the mere being of any thing is implied: This is not beer, but water; this is not brass, but steel.         *       *       *       *       *  Of NOUNS SUBSTANTIVE.  The relations of English nouns to words going before or following are not expressed by cases, or changes of termination, but, as in most of the other European languages, by prepositions, unless we may be said to have a genitive case.  Singular.  Nom. Magister,        a Master, the Master.  Gen. Magistri,        of a Master, of the Master,                       or Master's, the Master's.  Dat. Magistro,        to a Master, to the Master.  Acc. Magistrum,       a Master, the Master.  Voc. Magister,        Master, O Master.  Abl. Magistro,        from a Master, from the Master.  Plural.  Nom. Magistri,        Masters, the Masters.  Gen. Magistrorum,     of Masters, of the Masters.  Dat. Magistris,       to Masters, to the Masters.  Acc. Magistros,       Masters, the Masters.  Voc. Magistri,        Masters, O Masters.  Abl. Magistris,       from Masters, from the Masters.  Our nouns are therefore only declined thus:  Master,     Gen. Master's.        Plur. Masters.  Scholar,    Gen. Scholar's.       Plur. Scholars.      These genitives are always written with a mark of elision, master's,     scholar's, according to an opinion long received, that the 's is a     contraction of his, as the soldier's valour, for the soldier his     valour: but this cannot be the true original, because 's is put to     female nouns, Woman's beauty; the Virgin's delicacy; Haughty Juno's     unrelenting hate; and collective nouns, as Women's passions; the     rabble's insolence; the multitude's folly: in all these cases it is     apparent that his cannot be understood. We say likewise the     foundation's strength; the diamond's lustre; the winter's severity: but     in these cases his may be understood, he and his having formerly been     applied to neuters in the place now supplied by it and its.      The learned and sagacious Wallis, to whom every English grammarian owes     a tribute of reverence, calls this modification of the noun an     adjective possessive; I think with no more propriety than he might have     applied the same to the genitive in equitum decus, Trojæ oris, or any     other Latin genitive. Dr. Lowth, on the other part, supposes the     possessive pronouns mine and thine to be genitive cases.      This termination of the noun seems to constitute a real genitive     indicating possession. It is derived to us from the Saxon's who     declined smith, a smith; Gen. smither, of a smith; Plur. smither or     smithar,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15100"],["title","The Voyage of Governor Phillip to Botany Bay (#1)"],["body","rock amid the troubled air HOPE stood sublime, and wav'd her golden hair; Calm'd with her rosy smile the tossing deep, And with sweet accents charm'd the winds to sleep; To each wild plain she stretch'd her snowy hand, High-waving wood, and sea-encircled strand. \"Hear me,\" she cried, \"ye rising Realms! record \"Time's opening scenes, and Truth's unerring word.-- \"There shall broad streets their stately walls extend, \"The circus widen, and the crescent bend; \"There, ray'd from cities o'er the cultur'd land, \"Shall bright canals, and solid roads expand.-- \"There the proud arch, Colossus-like, bestride \"Yon glittering streams, and bound the chasing tide; \"Embellish'd villas crown the landscape-scene, \"Farms wave with gold, and orchards blush between.-- \"There shall tall spires, and dome-capt towers ascend, \"And piers and quays their massy structures blend; \"While with each breeze approaching vessels glide, \"And northern treasures dance on every tide!\"-- Then ceas'd the nymph--tumultuous echoes roar, And JOY's loud voice was heard from shore to shore-- Her graceful steps descending press'd the plain, And PEACE, and ART, and LABOUR, join'd her train.
