Behind them Brooklyn Bridge spanned the river, looking slender and graceful, like a thing hung in the air by delicate threads.  Close at hand were Governor's Island and the Statue of Liberty. The Frenchman was pointing it out.  \"Ze greatest work of art in all America,\"' he declared, enthusiastically; \"an' France give zat to America. Ze Americans nevare think to put eet zere themselves. France do more for America zan any ozare nation, but ze Americans forget. Zey forget Lafayette. Zey forget France make it possibul for zem to conquaire Engalande an' get ze freedom zey ware aftaire. An' now zey--zey--what you call eet?--toady to Engalande. Zey pretende to love ze Engaleesh. Bah! Uncale Sam an' John Bull both need to have some of ze conaceit taken out away from zem.\"  \"It would take more than France, Spain, Italy and all the rest of the dago nations to do the job!\" spluttered Harry Rattleton, who could not keep still longer.  \"Maurel,\" said the Frenchman, speaking to his companion, \"t'row ze insolent dog ovareboard!\"  \"Oui, monsieur!\"  Quick as thought the man sprang toward Harry, as if determined to execute the command of his master.  He did not put his hands on Rattleton, for Frank was equally swift in his movements, and blocked the fellows' way, coolly saying:  \"I wouldn't try it if I were you.\"  \"Out of ze way!\" snarled the man, who was an athlete in build. \"If you don't, I put you ovare, too!\"  \"I don't think you will.\"  \"Put him ovare, Maurel,\" ordered the Frenchman, with deadly coolness.  The athletic servant clutched Frank, but, with a twist and a turn, Merry broke the hold instantly, kicked the fellow's feet from beneath him, and dropped him heavily to the deck.  Bruce Browning stooped and picked the man up as if he were an infant. Every year seemed to add something to the big collegian's wonderful strength, and now the astounded Frenchman found himself unable to wiggle.  Browning held the man over the rail turning to Frank to ask:  \"Shall I give him a bath, Merriwell?\"  \"I think you hadn't better,\" laughed Frank. \"Perhaps he can't swim, and--\"  \"He can swim or sink,\" drawled Bruce. \"It won't make any difference if he sinks. Only another insolent Frenchman out of the way.\"  The master was astounded. Up to that moment he had regarded the young Americans as scarcely more than boys and he had fancied his athletic servant could easily frighten them. Instead of that, something quite unexpected by him had happened.  The astounded servant showed signs of terror, but in vain he struggled. He was helpless in the clutch of the giant collegian.  The master seemed about to interfere, but Frank Merriwell confronted him in a manner that spoke as plainly as words.  \"Out of ze way!\" snarled the man.  \"Speaking to me?\" inquired Merry, lifting his eyebrows.  \"Oui! oui!\"  \"I am sorry, but I can't accommodate you till my friend gets through with your servant, who was extremely fresh, like most Frenchmen.\"  \"Zis to me!\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Sare, I am M. Rouen Montfort, an' I--\"  \"It makes no difference to me if you are the high mogul of France. You are on the deck of an English vessel, and you are dealing with Americans.\"  The Frenchman flung his cigar aside and seemed to feel for a weapon.  Frank stood there quietly, his eyes watching every movement.  \"If you have what you are seeking about your person,\" he said, with perfect calmness, \"I advise you not to draw it. If you do, as sure as you are sailing down New York harbor, I'll fling you over the rail, weapon and all!\"  That was business, and it was not boasting. Frank actually meant to throw the man into the water if he drew a weapon.  M. Rouen Montfort paused and stared at Frank Merriwell, beginning to understand that he was not dealing with an ordinary youth.  \"Fool!\" he panted. \"You geeve me ze eensult I will haf your life!\"  \"You have already insulted me, my friends and everything American. It's your turn to take a little of the medicine.\"  \"Eef we were een France--\"  \"Which we are not. We are still in America, the land of the free. But I don't care to have a quarrel with you. Bruce put the fellow down. If he minds his business in the future, don't throw him overboard.\"  \"All right,\" grunted the big fellow; \"but I was just going to drop him in the wet.\"  He put the man down, and the fellow seemed undecided what to do.  Harry Rattleton laughed.  \"Now wake a talk--no, I mean take a walk,\" he cried. \"It will be a good thing for your health.\"  \"Come, Maurel,\" said the master, with an attempt at dignity; \"come away from ze fellows!\"  Maurel was glad enough to do so. He had thought to frighten the youths without the least trouble, but had been handled with such ease that even after it was all over he wondered how it could have happened.  M. Montfort walked away with great dignity, and Maurel followed, talking savagely and swiftly in French.  \"Well, it wasn't very hard to settle them,\" grinned Browning.  \"But we have not settled them,\" declared Frank. \"There will be further trouble with M. Rouen Montfort and his man Maurel.\"     CHAPTER III.  A FRESH YOUNG MAN.   Frank and his three friends bad a stateroom together. The tutor was given a room with other parties.  The weather for the first two days was fine, and the young collegians enjoyed every minute, not one of them having a touch of sea-sickness till the third day.  Then Rattleton was seized, and he lay in his bunk, groaning and dismal, even though he tried to be cheerful at times.  Browning enjoyed everything, even Rattleton's misery, for he could be lazy to his heart's content.  They had enlivened the times by singing songs, those of a nautical flavor, such as \"Larboard Watch\" and \"A Life on the Ocean Wave,\" having the preference.  Now it happened that the Frenchman occupied a room adjoining, and he was very much annoyed by their singing. He pounded on the partition, and expressed his feelings in very lurid language, but that amused them, and they sang the louder.  \"M. Montfort seems to get very agitated,\" said Frank, laughing.  \"But I hardly think there is any danger that he will do more than hammer on the partition,\" grunted Bruce. \"He's kept away from us since he found he could not frighten anybody.\"  \"He's a bluffer,\" was Diamond's opinion.  \"He's a great fellow to play cards,\" said Merry. \"But he seems to ply for something more than amusement.\"  \"How's that?\" asked Jack, interested.  \"I've noticed that he never cares for whist or any game where there are no stakes. He gets into a game only when there's something to be won.\"  \"Well, it seems to me that he's struck a poor crowd on this boat if he's looking for suckers. He should have shipped on an ocean liner. What does he play?\"  \"He seems to have taken a great fancy to draw poker. 'Pocaire' is what he calls it. He pretended at first that he didn't know much of anything about the game, but, if I am not mistaken, he's an old stager at it. I watched the party playing in the smoking-room last night.\"  \"Who played?\" asked Bruce.  \"The Frenchman, a rather sporty young fellow named Bloodgood, a small, bespectacled man, well fitted with the name of Slush, and an Englishman by the name of Hazleton.\"  \"That's the crowd that played in the Frenchman's stateroom to-day,\" groaned Rattleton from his berth.  \"Played in the stateroom?\" exclaimed Frank. \"I wonder why they didn't play in the smoking-room?\"  \"Don't know,\" said Harry; \"but I fancy there was a rather big game on, and you know the Frenchman has the biggest stateroom on the boat, so there was plenty of room for them. They could play there without interruption.\"  \"There seems to be something mysterious about that Frenchman,\" said Frank.  \"I think there's something mysterious about several passengers on this boat,\" grunted Browning. \"I haven't seen much of this young fellow Bloodgood, but he strikes me as a mystery.\"  \"Why?\"  \"Well he seems to have money to burn, and I don't understand why such a fellow did not take passage on a regular liner.\"  \"As far as that goes,\" smiled Merry, \"I presume some people might think it rather singular that we did not cross the pond in a regular liner; but then they might suppose it was a case of economy with us.\"  While they were talking there came a rap on their door which Frank threw open.  Just outside stood a young man with a flushed face and distressed appearance. He was dressed in a plaid suit, and wore a red four-in-hand necktie, in which blazed a huge diamond. There were two large solitaire rings on his left hand, and he wore a heavy gold chain strung across his vest.  \"Beg your pardon, dear boys,\" he drawled. \"Hope I'm not intruding.\"  Then he walked in and closed the door.  \"My name's Bloodgood,\" he said--\"Raymond Bloodgood. I've seen you fellows together, and you seem like a jolly lot. Heard you singing, you know. Great voices--good singing.\"  Then he stopped speaking, and they stared at him, wondering what he was driving at. For a moment there was an awkward pause, and then Bloodgood went on:  \"I was up pretty late last night, you know. Had a little game in the smoking-room. Plenty of booze, and all that, and I'm awfully rocky to-day. Got a splitting headache. Didn't know but some of you had a bromo seltzer, or something of the sort. You look like a crowd that finds such things handy occasionally.\"  At this Frank laughed quietly, but Diamond looked angry and indignant.  \"What do you take us for?\" exclaimed the Virginian, warmly. \"Do you think we are a lot of boozers?\"  Bloodgood turned on Jack, lifting his eyebrows.  \"My dear fellow--\" he began.  But Frank put in:  \"We have no use for bromo seltzer, as none of us are drinkers.\"  \"Oh, of course not,\" said the intruder, with something like a sneer. \"None of us are drinkers, but then we're all liable to get a little too much sometimes, especially when we sit up late and play poker.\"  Frank saw that Diamond had taken an instant dislike to the youth with the diamonds and the red necktie, and he felt like averting"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10904"],["title","Frank Merriwell's Nobility; Or, The Tragedy of the Ocean Tramp (#2)"],["body"," storm, even though he did not fancy the manner of the intruder.  \"We do not sit up late and play poker,\" he said.  \"Eh? Oh, come off! You're a jolly lot of fellows, and you must have a fling sometimes.\"  \"We can be jolly without drinking or gambling.\"  \"Why, I'm hanged if you don't talk as if you considered it a crime to take a drink or have a little social game!\"  Frank felt his blood warm up a bit, but he held himself in hand, as he quietly retorted:  \"Intemperance is a crime. I presume there are men who take a drink, as you call it, without being intemperate; but I prefer to let the stuff alone entirely, and then there is no danger of going over the limit.\"  \"And I took you for a sport! That shows how a fellow can be fooled. But you do play poker occasionally. I know that.\"  \"How do you know it, Mr. Bloodgood?\"  \"By your language. You just spoke of going over the limit. That is a poker term.\"  \"And one used by many people who never played a game of cards in their lives.\"  \"But you have played cards? You have played poker? Can you deny it?\"  \"If I could, I wouldn't take the trouble, Mr. Bloodgood. I think you have made a mistake in sizing up this crowd.\"  \"Guess I have,\" sneered the fellow. \"You must be members of the Y.M.C.A.\"  \"Say, Frank!\" panted Jack; \"open the door and let me----\"  But Frank checked the hot-headed youth again.  \"Steady, Jack! It is not necessary. He will go directly. Mr. Bloodgood, you speak as if it were a disgrace to belong to the Y.M.C.A. That shows your ignorance and narrowness. The Y.M.C.A. is a splendid organization, and it has proved the anchor that has kept many a young man from dashing onto the rocks of destruction. Those who sneer at it should be ashamed of themselves, but, as a rule, they are too bigoted, prejudiced, or narrow-minded to recognize the fact that some of the most manly young men to be found belong to the Y.M.C.A.\"  Bloodgood laughed.  \"And I took you for a sport!\" he cried. \"By Jove! Never made such a blunder before in all my life! Studying for the ministry, I'll wager! Ha! ha! ha!\"  Frank saw that Diamond could not be held in check much longer.  \"One last word to you, Mr. Bloodgood,\" he spoke. \"I am not studying for the ministry, and I do not even belong to the Y.M.C.A. If I were doing the one or belonged to the other, I should not be ashamed of it. I don't like you. I can stand a little freshness; in fact, it rather pleases me; but you are altogether too fresh. You are offensive.\"  Merry flung open the door.  \"Good-day, sir.\"  Bloodgood stepped out, turned round, laughed, and then walked away.  \"Hang it, Merriwell!\" grated Diamond, as Frank closed the door; \"why didn't you let me kick him out onto his neck!\"     CHAPTER IV.  WHO IS BLOODGOOD?   Diamond was thoroughly angry. So was Rattleton. In his excitement, Harry said something that caused Frank to turn quickly, and observe:  \"Don't use that kind of language, old man, no matter what the provocation. Vulgarity is even lower than profanity.\"  Harry's face flushed, and he looked intensely ashamed of himself.  \"I peg your bardon--I mean I beg your pardon!\" he spluttered. \"It slipped out. You know I don't say anything like that often.\"  \"I know it,\" nodded Frank, \"and that's why it sounded all the worse. I don't know that I ever heard you use such a word before.\"  Harry did not resent Frank's reproof, for he knew Frank was right, and he was ashamed.  Every young man who stoops to vulgarity should be ashamed. Profanity is coarse and degrading; vulgarity is positively low and filthy. The youth who is careful to keep his clothes and his body clean should be careful to keep his mouth clean. Let nothing go into it or come out of it that is in any way lowering.  Did you ever hear a loafer on a corner using profane and obscene language? I'll warrant most of you have, and I'll warrant that you were thoroughly disgusted. You looked on the fellow as low, coarse, cheap, unfit to associate with respectable persons. The next time you use a word that you should be ashamed to have your mother or sister hear just think that you are following the example of that loafer. You are lowering yourself in the eyes of somebody, even though you may not think so at the time. Perhaps one of your companions may be a person who uses such language freely, and yet he has never before heard it from you. He laughs, he calls you a jolly good fellow to your face; but he thinks to himself that you are no better than anybody else, and behind your back he tells somebody what he thinks. He is glad of the opportunity to show that you are no better than he is. Never tell a vulgar story. Better never listen to one, unless your position is such that you cannot escape without making yourself appear a positive cad. If you have to listen to such a story, forget it as soon as possible. Above all things, do not try to remember it.  Some young men boast of the stories they know. And all their stories are of the \"shady\" sort. It is better to know no stories than to know that kind. It is better not to be called a good fellow than to win a reputation by always having a new story of the low sort ready on your tongue.  There are other and better ways of winning a reputation as a good fellow. There are stories which are genuinely humorous and funny which are also clean. No matter how much of a laugh he may raise, any self-respecting person feels that he has lowered himself by telling a vulgar story. It is not so if he has told a clean story. He is satisfied with the laughter he has caused and with himself.  Frank Merriwell was called a good fellow. It was not often that he told a story, but when he did, it was a good one, and it was clean. He had an inimitable way of telling anything, and his stories were all the more effective because they came at rare intervals. He did not cheapen them by making them common.  And never had anybody heard him tell a story that could prove offensive to the ears of a lady.  Not that he had not been tempted to do so. Not that he had not heard such stories. He had been placed in positions where he could not help hearing them without making himself appear like a thorough cad.  Frank's first attempt to tell a vulgar story had been the lesson that he needed. He was with a rather gay crowd of boys at the time, and several had told \"shady\" yarns, and then they had called for one from Frank. He started to tell one, working up to the point with all the skill of which he was capable. He had them breathless, ready to shout with laughter when the point was reached. He drew them on and on with all the skill of which he was capable. And then, just as the climax was reached, he suddenly realized just what he was about to say. A thought came to him that made his heart give a great jump.  \"What if my mother were listening?\"  That was the thought. His mother was dead, but her influence was over him. A second thought followed. Many times he had seemed to feel her hovering near. Perhaps she was listening! Perhaps she was hearing all that he was saying!  Frank Merriwell stopped and stood quite still. At first he was very pale, and then came a rush of blood to his face. He turned crimson with shame and hung his head.  His companions looked at him in astonishment. They could not understand what had happened. Some of them cried, \"Go on! go on!\"  After some seconds he tried to speak. At first he choked and could say nothing articulate. After a little, he muttered:  \"I can't go on--I can't finish the story! You'll have to excuse me, fellows! I'm not feeling well!\"  And he withdrew from the jolly party as soon as possible.  From that day Frank Merriwell never attempted to tell a story that was in the slightest degree vulgar. He had learned his lesson, and he never forgot it.  Some boys swagger, chew tobacco, talk vulgar, and swear because they do not wish to be called \"sissies.\" They fancy such actions and language make them manly, but nothing could be a greater mistake.  Frank did nothing of the sort, and all who knew him regarded him as thoroughly manly. Better to be called a \"sissy\" than to win reputed manliness at the cost of self-respect.  Frank had forced those who would have regarded him with scorn to respect him. He could play baseball or football with the best of them; he could run, jump, swim, ride, and he excelled by sheer determination in almost everything he undertook. He would not be beaten. If defeated once, he did not rest, but prepared himself for another trial and went in to win or die. In this way he showed himself manly, and he commanded the respect of enemies as well as friends.  Rattleton was ashamed of the language he had used after the departure of Bloodgood, and he did not attempt to excuse himself further. He lay back in his berth, looking sicker than ever.  \"I'd give ten dollars for the privilege of helping Mr. Bloodgood out with my foot!\" hissed Jack Diamond. \"Never saw anybody so fresh!\"  \"Oh, I've seen lots of people just like him,\" grunted Browning, getting out a pipe and lighting it.  \"Don't smoke, Bruce!\" groaned Rattleton, as the steamer gave an unusually heavy roll. \"I'm sick enough now. That will make me worse.\"  \"Oh, we'll open the port.\"  \"Open the port!\" laughed Frank. \"And we just told Bloodgood we did not drink.\"  \"Port-hole, not port wine,\" said the big fellow, with a yawn. \"We'll let in some fresh air.\"  \"We can't let in anything fresher than just went out,\" declared the Virginian, as he flung open the round window that served to admit light and air.  \"There's something mighty queer about that fellow,\" said Frank. \"Did you notice the diamonds he was wearing, fellows?\"  \"Yes,\" said Bruce, beginning to puff away at his new briarwood. \"Regular eye-hitters they were.\"  \"Who knows they were genuine?\" asked Jack.  \"Nobody here,\" admitted Frank. \"It is impossible to distinguish some fake stones from real diamonds, unless you examine them closely. But, somehow, I have a fancy that those were genuine diamonds.\"  \"What makes"]]]
