I hope nothing'll come to you in the way of mischance.\"  \"Oh, it's nothing, nothing at all!\" I hastened to say. \"If you knew it all, you'd see it's a very ordinary business that this man can't do himself, being kept to his bed. But all the same, there's naught like taking precautions beforehand, and so I'll tell you what we'll do. I should be back in town soon after twelve, and I'll give a tap at your window as I pass it, and then you'll know all's right.\"  That would be an easy enough thing to manage, for Maisie's room, where she slept with a younger sister, was on the ground floor of her father's house in a wing that butted on to the street, and I could knock at the pane as I passed by. Yet still she seemed uneasy, and I hastened to say what--not even then knowing her quite as well as I did later--I thought would comfort her in any fears she had. \"It's a very easy job, Maisie,\" I said; \"and the ten pounds'll go a long way in buying that furniture we're always talking about.\"  She started worse than before when I said that and gripped the hand that I had round her waist.  \"Hughie!\" she exclaimed. \"He'll not be giving you ten pounds for a bit of a ride like that! Oh, now I'm sure there's danger in it! What would a man be paying ten pounds for to anybody just to take a message? Don't go, Hughie! What do you know of yon man except that he's a stranger that never speaks to a soul in the place, and wanders about like he was spying things? And I would liefer go without chair or table, pot or pan, than that you should be running risks in a lonesome place like that, and at that time, with nobody near if you should be needing help. Don't go!\"  \"You're misunderstanding,\" said I. \"It's a plain and easy thing--I've nothing to do but ride there and back. And as for the ten pounds, it's just this way: yon Mr. Gilverthwaite has more money than he knows what to do with. He carries sovereigns in his pockets like they were sixpenny pieces! Ten pounds is no more to him that ten pennies to us. And we've had the man in our house seven weeks now, and there's nobody could say an ill word of him.\"  \"It's not so much him,\" she answered. \"It's what you may meet--there! For you've got to meet--somebody. You're going, then?\"  \"I've given my word, Maisie,\" I said. \"And you'll see there'll be no harm, and I'll give you a tap at the window as I pass your house coming back. And we'll do grand things with that ten pounds, too.\"  \"I'll never close my eyes till I hear you, then,\" she replied. \"And I'll not be satisfied with any tap, neither. If you give one, I'll draw the blind an inch, and make sure it's yourself, Hughie.\"  We settled it at that, with a kiss that was meant on my part to be one of reassurance, and presently we parted, and I went off to get my bicycle in readiness for the ride.     CHAPTER III  THE RED STAIN   It was just half-past nine by the town clocks when I rode out across the old Border Bridge and turned up the first climb of the road that runs alongside the railway in the direction of Tillmouth Park, which was, of course, my first objective. A hot, close night it was--there had been thunder hanging about all day, and folk had expected it to break at any minute, but up to this it had not come, and the air was thick and oppressive. I was running with sweat before I had ridden two miles along the road, and my head ached with the heaviness of the air, that seemed to press on me till I was like to be stifled. Under ordinary circumstances nothing would have taken me out on such a night. But the circumstances were not ordinary, for it was the first time I had ever had the chance of earning ten pounds by doing what appeared to be a very simple errand; and though I was well enough inclined to be neighbourly to Mr. Gilverthwaite, it was certainly his money that was my chief inducement in going on his business at a time when all decent folk should be in their beds. And for this first part of my journey my thoughts ran on that money, and on what Maisie and I would do with it when it was safely in my pocket. We had already bought the beginnings of our furnishing, and had them stored in an unused warehouse at the back of her father's premises; with Mr. Gilverthwaite's bank-note, lying there snugly in waiting for me, we should be able to make considerable additions to our stock, and the wedding-day would come nearer.  But from these anticipations I presently began to think about the undertaking on which I was now fairly engaged. When I came to consider it, it seemed a queer affair. As I understood it, it amounted to this:--Here was Mr. Gilverthwaite, a man that was a stranger in Berwick, and who appeared to have plenty of money and no business, suddenly getting a letter which asked him to meet a man, near midnight, and in about as lonely a spot as you could select out of the whole district. Why at such a place, and at such an hour? And why was this meeting of so much importance that Mr. Gilverthwaite, being unable to keep the appointment himself, must pay as much as ten pounds to another person to keep it for him? What I had said to Maisie about Mr. Gilverthwaite having so much money that ten pounds was no more to him than ten pence to me was, of course, all nonsense, said just to quieten her fears and suspicions--I knew well enough, having seen a bit of the world in a solicitor's office for the past six years, that even millionaires don't throw their money about as if pounds were empty peascods. No! Mr. Gilverthwaite was giving me that money because he thought that I, as a lawyer's clerk, would see the thing in its right light as a secret and an important business, and hold my tongue about it. And see it as a secret business I did--for what else could it be that would make two men meet near an old ruin at midnight, when in a town where, at any rate, one of them was a stranger, and the other probably just as much so, they could have met by broad day at a more convenient trysting-place without anybody having the least concern in their doings? There was strange and subtle mystery in all this, and the thinking and pondering it over led me before long to wondering about its first natural consequence--who and what was the man I was now on my way to meet, and where on earth could he be coming from to keep a tryst at a place like that, and at that hour?  However, before I had covered three parts of that outward journey, I was to meet another man who, all unknown to me, was to come into this truly extraordinary series of events in which I, with no will of my own, was just beginning--all unawares--to be mixed up. Taking it roughly, and as the crow flies, it is a distance of some nine or ten miles from Berwick town to Twizel Bridge on the Till, whereat I was to turn off from the main road and take another, a by-lane, that would lead me down by the old ruin, close by which Till and Tweed meet. Hot as the night was, and unpleasant for riding, I had plenty and to spare of time in hand, and when I came to the cross-ways between Norham and Grindon, I got off my machine and sat down on the bank at the roadside to rest a bit before going further. It was a quiet and a very lonely spot that; for three miles or more I had not met a soul along the road, and there being next to nothing in the way of village or farmstead between me and Cornhill, I did not expect to meet one in the next stages of my journey. But as I sat there on the bank, under a thick hedge, my bicycle lying at my side, I heard steps coming along the road in the gloom--swift, sure steps, as of a man who walks fast, and puts his feet firmly down as with determination to get somewhere as soon as he may. And hearing that--and to this day I have often wondered what made me do it--I off with my cap, and laid it over the bicycle-lamp, and myself sat as still as any of the wee creatures that were doubtless lying behind me in the hedge.  The steps came from the direction in which I was bound. There was a bit of a dip in the road just there: they came steadily, strongly, up it. And presently--for this was the height of June, when the nights are never really dark--the figure of a man came over the ridge of the dip, and showed itself plain against a piece of grey sky that was framed by the fingers of the pines and firs on either side of the way. A strongly-built figure it was, and, as I said before, the man put his feet, evidently well shod, firmly and swiftly down, and with this alternate sound came the steady and equally swift tapping of an iron-shod stick. Whoever this night-traveller was, it was certain he was making his way somewhere without losing any time in the business.  The man came close by me and my cover, seeing nothing, and at a few yards' distance stopped dead. I knew why. He had come to the cross-roads, and it was evident from his movements that he was puzzled and uncertain. He went to the corners of each way: it seemed to me that he was seeking for a guide-post. But, as I knew very well, there was no guide-post at any corner, and presently he came to the middle of the roads again and stood, looking this way and that, as if still in a dubious mood. And then I heard a crackling"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12242"],["title","Poems (#1)"],["body","sense To a discerning eye; Much sense the starkest madness. 'T is the majority In this, as all, prevails. Assent, and you are sane; Demur, -- you're straightway dangerous, And handled with a chain. XII.  I asked no other thing, No other was denied. I offered Being for it; The mighty merchant smiled.  Brazil? He twirled a button, Without a glance my way: \"But, madam, is there nothing else That we can show to-day?\"      XIII.  EXCLUSION.  The soul selects her own society, Then shuts the door; On her divine majority Obtrude no more.  Unmoved, she notes the chariot's pausing At her low gate; Unmoved, an emperor is kneeling Upon her mat.  I've known her from an ample nation Choose one; Then close the valves of her attention Like stone.      XIV.  THE SECRET.  Some things that fly there be, -- Birds, hours, the bumble-bee: Of these no elegy.  Some things that stay there be, -- Grief, hills, eternity: Nor this behooveth me.  There are, that resting, rise. Can I expound the skies? How still the riddle lies!      XV.  THE LONELY HOUSE.  I know some lonely houses off the road A robber 'd like the look of, -- Wooden barred, And windows hanging low, Inviting to A portico, Where two could creep: One hand the tools, The other peep To make sure all's asleep. Old-fashioned eyes, Not easy to surprise!  How orderly the kitchen 'd look by night, With just a clock, -- But they could gag the tick, And mice won't bark; And so the walls don't tell, None will.  A pair of spectacles ajar just stir -- An almanac's aware. Was it the mat winked, Or a nervous star? The moon slides down the stair To see who's there.  There's plunder, -- where? Tankard, or spoon, Earring, or stone, A watch, some ancient brooch To match the grandmamma, Staid sleeping there.  Day rattles, too, Stealth's slow; The sun has got as far As the third sycamore. Screams chanticleer, \"Who's there?\" And echoes, trains away, Sneer -- \"Where?\" While the old couple, just astir, Fancy the sunrise left the door ajar!      XVI.  To fight aloud is very brave, But gallanter, I know, Who charge within the bosom, The cavalry of woe.  Who win, and nations do not see, Who fall, and none observe, Whose dying eyes no country Regards with patriot love.  We trust, in plumed procession, For such the angels go, Rank after rank, with even feet And uniforms of snow.      XVII.  DAWN.  When night is almost done, And sunrise grows so near That we can touch the spaces, It 's time to smooth the hair  And get the dimples ready, And wonder we could care For that old faded midnight That frightened but an hour.      XVIII.  THE BOOK OF MARTYRS.  Read, sweet, how others strove, Till we are stouter; What they renounced, Till we are less afraid; How many times they bore The faithful witness, Till we are helped, As if a kingdom cared!  Read then of faith That shone above the fagot; Clear strains of hymn The river could not drown; Brave names of men And celestial women, Passed out of record Into renown!      XIX.  THE MYSTERY OF PAIN.  Pain has an element of blank; It cannot recollect When it began, or if there were A day when it was not.  It has no future but itself, Its infinite realms contain Its past, enlightened to perceive New periods of pain.      XX.  I taste a liquor never brewed, From tankards scooped in pearl; Not all the vats upon the Rhine Yield such an alcohol!  Inebriate of air am I, And debauchee of dew, Reeling, through endless summer days, From inns of molten blue.  When landlords turn the drunken bee Out of the foxglove's door, When butterflies renounce their drams, I shall but drink the more!  Till seraphs swing their snowy hats, And saints to windows run, To see the little tippler Leaning against the sun!      XXI.  A BOOK.  He ate and drank the precious words, His spirit grew robust; He knew no more that he was poor, Nor that his frame was dust. He danced along the dingy days, And this bequest of wings Was but a book. What liberty A loosened spirit brings!      XXII.  I had no time to hate, because The grave would hinder me, And life was not so ample I Could finish enmity.  Nor had I time to love; but since Some industry must be, The little toil of love, I thought, Was large enough for me.      XXIII.  UNRETURNING.  'T was such a little, little boat That toddled down the bay! 'T was such a gallant, gallant sea That beckoned it away!  'T was such a greedy, greedy wave That licked it from the coast; Nor ever guessed the stately sails My little craft was lost!      XXIV.  Whether my bark went down at sea, Whether she met with gales, Whether to isles enchanted She bent her docile sails;  By what mystic mooring She is held to-day, -- This is the errand of the eye Out upon the bay.      XXV.  Belshazzar had a letter, -- He never had but one; Belshazzar's correspondent Concluded and begun In that immortal copy The conscience of us all Can read without its glasses On revelation's wall.      XXVI.  The brain within its groove Runs evenly and true; But let a splinter swerve, 'T were easier for you To put the water back When floods have slit the hills, And scooped a turnpike for themselves, And blotted out the mills!       II. LOVE.   I.  MINE.  Mine by the right of the white election! Mine by the royal seal! Mine by the sign in the scarlet prison Bars cannot conceal!  Mine, here in vision and in veto! Mine, by the grave's repeal Titled, confirmed, -- delirious charter! Mine, while the ages steal!      II.  BEQUEST.  You left me, sweet, two legacies, -- A legacy of love A Heavenly Father would content, Had He the offer of;  You left me boundaries of pain Capacious as the sea, Between eternity and time, Your consciousness and me.      III.  Alter? When the hills do. Falter? When the sun Question if his glory Be the perfect one.  Surfeit? When the daffodil Doth of the dew: Even as herself, O friend! I will of you!      IV.  SUSPENSE.  Elysium is as far as to The very nearest room, If in that room a friend await Felicity or doom.  What fortitude the soul contains, That it can so endure The accent of a coming foot, The opening of a door!      V.  SURRENDER.  Doubt me, my dim companion! Why, God would be content With but a fraction of the love Poured thee without a stint. The whole of me, forever, What more the woman can, -- Say quick, that I may dower thee With last delight I own!  It cannot be my spirit, For that was thine before; I ceded all of dust I knew, -- What opulence the more Had I, a humble maiden, Whose farthest of degree Was that she might, Some distant heaven, Dwell timidly with thee!      VI.  If you were coming in the fall, I'd brush the summer by With half a smile and half a spurn, As housewives do a fly.  If I could see you in a year, I'd wind the months in balls, And put them each in separate drawers, Until their time befalls.  If only centuries delayed, I'd count them on my hand, Subtracting till my fingers dropped Into Van Diemen's land.  If certain, when this life was out, That yours and mine should be, I'd toss it yonder like a rind, And taste eternity.  But now, all ignorant of the length Of time's uncertain wing, It goads me, like the goblin bee, That will not state its sting.      VII.  WITH A FLOWER.  I hide myself within my flower, That wearing on your breast, You, unsuspecting, wear me too -- And angels know the rest.  I hide myself within my flower, That, fading from your vase, You, unsuspecting, feel for me Almost a loneliness.      VIII.  PROOF.  That I did always love, I bring thee proof: That till I loved I did not love enough.  That I shall love alway, I offer thee That love is life, And life hath immortality.  This, dost thou doubt, sweet? Then have I Nothing to show But Calvary.      IX.  Have you got a brook in your little heart, Where bashful flowers blow, And blushing birds go down to drink, And shadows tremble so?  And nobody knows, so still it flows, That any brook is there; And yet your little draught of life Is daily drunken there.  Then look out for the little brook in March, When the rivers overflow, And the snows come hurrying from the hills, And the bridges often go.  And later, in August it may be, When the meadows parching lie, Beware, lest this little brook of life Some burning noon go dry!      X.  TRANSPLANTED.  As if some little Arctic flower, Upon the polar hem, Went wandering down the latitudes, Until it puzzled came To continents of summer, To firmaments of sun, To strange, bright crowds of flowers, And birds of foreign tongue! I say, as if this little flower To Eden wandered in -- What then? Why, nothing, only, Your inference therefrom!      XI.  THE OUTLET.  My river runs to thee: Blue sea, wilt welcome me?  My river waits reply. Oh sea, look graciously!  I'll fetch thee brooks From spotted nooks, --  Say, sea, Take me!      XII.  IN VAIN.  I cannot live with you, It would be life, And life is over there Behind the shelf  The sexton keeps the key to, Putting up Our life, his porcelain, Like a cup  Discarded of the housewife, Quaint or broken; A newer Sevres pleases, Old ones crack.  I could not die with you, For one must wait To shut the other's gaze down, -- You could not.  And I, could I stand by And see you freeze, Without my right of frost, Death's privilege?  Nor could I rise with you, Because your face Would put out Jesus', That new grace  Glow plain and foreign On my homesick eye, Except that you, than he Shone closer by.  They'd judge us -- how? For you served Heaven, you know, Or sought to; I could not,  Because you saturated sight, And I had no more eyes For sordid excellence As Paradise.  And were you lost, I would be, Though my name Rang loudest On the heavenly fame.  And were you saved, And I condemned to be Where you were not, That self were hell to me.  So we must keep apart, You there, I here, With just the door ajar That oceans are, And prayer, And that pale sustenance, Despair!      XIII.  RENUNCIATION.  There came a day at summer's full Entirely for me; I thought that such were for the saints, Where"]]]
