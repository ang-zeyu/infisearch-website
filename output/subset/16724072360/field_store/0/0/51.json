But the beautiful village of Vernondale is less than an hour from New York; no mosquitoes, no malaria; boating, bathing, and fishing. Miss Fairfield could, therefore, go to New York for her instructions in the various arts and sciences, and return again to her Vernondale home on a local train. Add to this the fact that here she has relatives, friends, and acquaintances, who already know and love her, while, in New York, she would have to acquire a whole new set, probably have to advertise for them. As to the commuting gentleman: before his first ticket was all punched up, he would be ready to vow that the commuter's life is the only ideal existence. Having thus offered unattackable arguments, I deem a decision in our favour a foregone conclusion, and I take pleasure in sitting down.\"  \"A very successful speech,\" said Patty, smiling at her uncle. \"We will now be pleased to hear from the next speaker on the affirmative side. Mrs. Charles Elliott, will you kindly speak what is on your mind?\"  \"I will,\" said Mrs. Elliott, with a nod of her head that betokened Fairfield decision of character. \"I will say exactly what is on my mind without regard to which side I am on.\"  \"Oh, that isn't fair!\" cried Patty. \"A debate is a debate, you know, and you must make up opinions for your own side, whether you think them or not.\"  \"Very well,\" said Aunt Alice, smiling a little, \"then it being thoroughly understood that I am not speaking the truth, I will say that I think it better for Patty to live in New York. As her father will be away all day at his business, she will enjoy the loneliness of a big brown-stone city house; she will enjoy the dark rooms and the entire absence of grass and flowers and trees, which she hates anyway; instead of picnics and boating parties, she can go to stiff and formal afternoon teas; and, instead of attending her young people's club here, she can become a member of the Society of Social Economics.\"  With an air of having accomplished her intention, Aunt Alice sat down amid great cheers and handclappings from the opposite side.  Patty looked a little sober as she began to think the Vernondale home would win; and, though for many reasons she wished it would be so, yet, at the same time, she realised very strongly the attractions of life in New York City.  However, she only said:  \"The meeting will please come to order, in order to listen to the opinions of Miss Elliott.\"  Marian rose with great dignity, and addressed the chair and the ladies and gentlemen with true parliamentary punctiliousness.  \"Though personally interested in this matter,\" she began, \"it is not my intention to allow my own wishes or prejudices to blind me to the best interests of our young friend who is now under discussion. Far be it from me to blight her career for the benefit of my own unworthy self, but I will say that if Patty Fairfield goes to live in New York, or anywhere except Vernondale, I think she's just the horridest, meanest old thing on the face of the earth! Why, I wouldn't _let_ her go! I'd lock her in her room, and poke bread and water to her through the keyhole, if she dared to think of such a thing! Go to New York, indeed! A nice time she'd have, hanging on straps in the trolley-cars, and getting run over by automobiles! The whole thing is so perfectly absurd that there's no earthly chance of its ever coming to pass. Why, she _wouldn't_ go, she couldn't be _hired_ to go; she wouldn't be happy there a minute; but if she _does_ go, I'll go, too!\"     CHAPTER II  THE DECISION   \"Hooray for our side!\" cried Frank, as Marian dropped into a chair after her outburst of enthusiasm.  \"Oh, I haven't finished yet,\" said Marian, jumping up again. \"I want to remark further that not only is Patty going to live in Vernondale, but she's going to have a house very near this one. I've picked it out,\" and Marian wagged her head with the air of a mysterious sibyl. \"I won't tell you where it is just yet, but it's a lovely house, and big enough to accommodate Uncle Fred and Patty, and a guest or two besides. I've selected the room that I prefer, and I hope you will furnish it in blue.\"  \"The speaker is a bit hasty,\" said Patty as Marian sat down again; \"we can't furnish any rooms before this debate is concluded; and, though we deeply regret it, Miss Elliott will be obliged to wait for her blue room until the other speakers have had their speak.\"  But Patty smiled at Marian understandingly, and began to have a very attractive mental picture of her cousin's blue room next her own.  \"The next speaker,\" announced the judge, \"will be Mrs. Elliott, Senior,--the Dowager Duchess. Your Grace, we would be pleased to hear from you.\"  \"I don't know,\" said Grandma Elliott, looking rather seriously into the smiling faces before her, \"that I am entirely in favour of the country home. I think our Patty would greatly enjoy the city atmosphere. She is a schoolgirl now, but in a year or two she will be a young woman, and one well deserving of the best that can be given to her. I am city-bred myself, and though at my age I prefer the quiet of the country, yet for a young girl I well know the charm of a city life. Of course, we would all regret the loss of our Patty, who has grown to be a part of our daily life, but, nevertheless, were I to vote on this matter, I should unhesitatingly cast my ballot in favour of New York.\"  \"Bravo for grandma!\" cried Frank. \"Give me a lady who fearlessly speaks her mind even in the face of overwhelming opposition. All the same, I haven't spoken my piece yet, and I believe it is now my turn.\"  \"It is,\" said Patty, \"and we eagerly await your sapient and authoritative remarks.\"  \"Ahem!\" said Frank pompously, as he arose. \"My remarks shall be brief, but very much to the point. Patty's home must be in Vernondale because we live here. If ever we go to live in New York, or Oshkosh, or Kalamazoo, Patty can pick up her things and go along. Just get that idea firmly fixed in your heads, my friends. Where we live, Patty lives; whither she goeth, we goeth. Therefore, if Patty should go to New York, the Elliotts will take up bag and baggage, sell the farm, and go likewise to New York. Now I'm sure our Patty, being of proper common-sense and sound judgment, wouldn't put the Elliott family to such inconvenience,--for moving is a large and fearsome proposition. Thus we see that as the Mountain insists on following Mahomet whithersoever she goest, the only decently polite thing for Mahomet to do is to settle in Vernondale. I regret exceedingly that I am forced to express an opinion so diametrically opposed to the advices of Her Grace, the Dowager Duchess, but I'm quite sure she didn't realise what a bother it would be for the Elliotts to move. And now, having convinced you all to my way of thinking, I will leave the case in the hands of our wise and competent judge.\"  \"Wait,\" said Uncle Charley; \"I believe the captains are usually allowed a sort of summing-up speech, are they not?\"  \"They are in this case, anyway,\" said Patty. \"Mr. Elliott will please go ahead with his summing-up.\"  \"Well,\" said Uncle Charley, \"the sum of the whole matter seems to be that we all want Fred and Patty to live here because we want them to; but, of course, it's only fair that they consult their own wishes in the matter, and if they conclude that they prefer New York, why,--we'll have another debate, that's all.\"  Uncle Charley sat down, and Mr. Fairfield rose. \"I have listened with great interest to the somewhat flattering remarks of my esteemed fellow members, and have come to the conclusion that, if agreeable to Her Judgeship, a compromise might be effected. It would seem to me that if a decision should be arrived at for the Vernondale home, the Fairfields could manage to reap some few of those mysterious advantages said to be found in city life, by going to New York and staying a few months every winter. This, too, would give them an opportunity to receive visits from the Elliott family, which would, I'm sure, be a pleasure and profit to all concerned. With this suggestion I am quite ready to hear a positive and final decision from Her Honour, the Judge.\"  \"And it won't take her long to make up her mind, either,\" cried Patty. \"I knew you'd fix it somehow, papa; you are the best and wisest man! Solomon wasn't in it with you, nor Solon, nor Socrates, nor anybody! That arrangement is exactly what I choose, and suits me perfectly, I do want to stay in New York sometimes, but I would much rather live in Vernondale; so the judge hereby announces that, on the merits of the case, the question is decided in the negative. The Fairfields will buy a house in Vernondale, and the judge hopes that they will buy it quick.\"  \"Three cheers for Patty and Uncle Fred,\" cried Frank, and while they were being given with a will, Marian flew to the telephone, and, when the cheers subsided, she was engaged in a conversation of which the debating club heard only one side.  \"Is this you, Elsie?\"  \"What do you think? Patty's going to stay in Vernondale!\"  \"Yes, indeed, perfectly gorgeous.\"  \"Just this evening; just now.\"  \"I guess I am! I'm so glad I don't know what to do!\"  \"Oh, yes, of course she'll keep on being president.\"  \"No, they haven't decided yet, but I want them to take the Bigelow house.\"  \"Yes; wouldn't it be fine!\"  \"Oh, it isn't very late.\"  \"Well, come over early to-morrow morning, then.\"  \"Good-by.\"  \"Elsie Morris is delighted,\" said Marian, as she hung up the receiver, \"and Polly Stevens will just dance jigs of joy when she hears about it. I'd call her up now, only I'm afraid she'd break the telephone trying to express her enthusiasm; she flutters so.\"  \""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10268"],["title","Patty at Home (#2)"],["body","can tell her about it to-morrow,\" said Frank, \"and now let's talk about where the house shall be. Would you rather buy or build, Uncle Fred?\"  \"Perhaps it would be better to rent,\" said Mr. Fairfield. \"Suppose my fickle daughter should change her mind, and after a visit in the city decide that she prefers it for her home.\"  \"I'm not fickle, papa,\" said Patty, \"and it's all arranged all right just as it is; but I don't want a rented house, they won't let you drive tacks in the walls, or anything like that. Let's buy a house, and then, if you turn fickle and want to move away, we can sell it again.\"  \"All right,\" said Mr. Fairfield obligingly, \"what house shall we buy?\"  \"I know just the one,\" cried Marian; \"guess where it is.\"  \"Would you, by any chance, refer to the Bigelow house?\" inquired Frank politely.  \"How did you know?\" exclaimed Marian. \"I only heard to-day that it is for sale, and I wanted to surprise you.\"  \"Well, next time you have a surprise in store for us,\" said Frank, \"don't announce it to Elsie Morris over the telephone.\"  \"Oh, did you hear that?\"  \"As a rule, sister dear, unless you are the matron of a deaf and dumb asylum, you must expect those present to hear your end of a telephone conversation.\"  \"Of course,\" said Marian; \"I didn't think. But, really, wouldn't the Bigelow house be fine? Only a few blocks away from here, and such a lovely house, with a barn and a conservatory, and a little arbour in the garden.\"  Patty began to look frightened.  \"Goodness, gracious me!\" she exclaimed; \"I don't believe I realise what I'm coming to. I could take care of the little arbour in the garden; but I wonder if I could manage a house, and a barn, and a conservatory!\"  \"And go to school every day, besides,\" said her father, laughing. \"I think, my child, that at least until your school days are over, we will engage the services of a responsible housekeeper.\"  \"Oh, papa!\" cried Patty, in dismay, \"you said I could keep house for you; and Aunt Alice has taught me lots about it; and she'll teach me lots more; and you know I can make good pumpkin pies; and, of course, I can dust and fly 'round; and that's about all there is to housekeeping, anyway.\"  \"Oh, Patty,\" said Aunt Alice, \"my lessons must have fallen on stony ground if you think that's all there is to housekeeping.\"  \"That's merely a figure of speech, Aunt Alice,\" replied Patty. \"You well know I am a thoroughly capable and experienced housekeeper; honest, steady, good-tempered, and with a fine reference from my last place.\"  \"You're certainly a clever little housekeeper for your age,\" said her aunt, \"but I'm not sure you could keep house successfully, and go to school, and practice your music, and attend to your club all at the same time.\"  \"But I wouldn't do them all at the same time, Aunt Alice. I'd have a time for everything, and everything in it place. I would go to school, and practise, and housekeep, and club; all in their proper proportions--\" Here Patty glanced at her father. \"You see, if I had the proportions right, all would go well.\"  \"Well, perhaps,\" said Mr. Fairfield, \"if we had a competent cook and a tidy little waitress, we could get along without a professional housekeeper. I admit I had hoped to have Patty keep house for me and preside at my table, and at any rate, it would do no harm to try it as an experiment; then, if it failed, we could make some other arrangement.\"  \"I guess I do want to sit at the head of our table, papa,\" said Patty; \"I'd just like to see a housekeeper there! A prim, sour-faced old lady with a black silk dress and dangling ear-rings! No, I thank you. If I have my way I will keep that house myself, and when I get into any trouble, I will fly to Aunt Alice for rest and refreshment.\"  \"We'll all help,\" said Marian; \"I'll make lovely sofa-pillows for you, and I'm sure grandma will knit you an afghan.\"  \"That isn't much towards housekeeping,\" said Frank. \"I'll come over next summer and swing your hammock for you, and put up your tennis-net.\"  \"And meantime,\" said Uncle Charley, \"until the house is bought and furnished, the Fairfield family will be the welcome guests of the Elliotts. It's almost the middle of December now, and I don't think, Miss Patty Fairfield, that you'll get your home settled in time to make a visit in New York _this_ winter; and now, you rattle-pated youngsters, run to bed, while I discuss some plans sensibly with my brother-in-law and fellow townsman.\"     CHAPTER III  THE TEA CLUB   \"Well I should think you'd better stay in Vernondale, Patty Fairfield, if you know what's good for yourself! Why, if you had attempted to leave this town, we would have mobbed you with tar and feathers, or whatever those dreadful things are that they do to the most awful criminals.\"  \"Oh, if I had gone, Polly, I should have taken this club with me, of course. I'm so used to it now, I'm sure I couldn't live a day, and know that we should meet no more, as the Arab remarked to his beautiful horse.\"  \"It would be rather fun to be transported bodily to New York as a club, but I'd want to be transported home again after the meeting,\" said Helen Preston.  \"Why shouldn't we do that?\" cried Florence Douglass. \"It would be lots of fun for the whole club to go to New York some day together.\"  \"I'm so glad Patty is going to stay with us, I don't care what we do,\" said Ethel Holmes, who was drawing pictures on Patty's white shirt-waist cuffs as a mark of affection.  \"I'm glad, too,\" said Patty; \"and, Ethel, your kittens are perfectly lovely, but this is my last clean shirt-waist, and those pencil-marks are awfully hard to wash out.\"  \"I don't mean them to be washed out,\" said Ethel, calmly going on with her art work; \"they're not wash drawings, they're permanent decorations for your cuffs, and are offered as a token of deep regard and esteem.\"  The Tea Club was holding a Saturday afternoon meeting at Polly Stevens's house, and the conversation, as yet, had not strayed far from the all-engrossing subject of Patty's future plans.  The Tea Club had begun its existence with lofty and noble aims in a literary direction, to be supplemented and assisted by an occasional social cup of tea. But if you have had any experience with merry, healthy young girls of about sixteen, you will not be surprised to learn that the literary element had softly and suddenly vanished away, much after the manner of a Boojum. Then, somehow, the social interest grew stronger, and the tea element held its own, and the result was a most satisfactory club, if not an instructive one.  \"But,\" as Polly Stevens had said, \"we are instructed all day long in school, and a good deal out of school, too, for that matter; and what we need most is absolutely foolish recreation; the foolisher the better.\"  And so the Saturday afternoon meetings had developed into merely merry frolics, with a cup of tea, which was often a figure of speech for chocolate or lemonade, at the close.  There were no rules, and the girls took pleasure in calling themselves unruly members. There were no dues, and consequently no occasion for a secretary or treasures. Patty continued to be called the president, but the title meant nothing more than the fact that she was really a chief favourite among the girls. No one was bound, or even expected to attend the meetings unless she chose; but, as a rule, a large majority of the club was present.  And so to-day, in the library at Polly Stevens's house, nine members of the Tea Club were chattering like nine large and enthusiastic magpies.  \"Now we can go on with the entertainment,\" said Lillian Desmond, as she sat on the arm of Patty's chair, curling wisps of the presidential hair over her fingers. \"If Patty had gone away, I should have resigned my part in the show and gone into a convent. Where are you going to live, Patty?\"  \"I don't know, I am sure; we haven't selected a house yet; and if we don't find one we like, papa may build one, though I believe Marian has one all picked out for us.\"  \"Yes, I have,\" said Marian. \"It's the Bigelow house on our street. I do want to keep Patty near us.\"  \"The Bigelow house? Why, that's too large for two people. Patty and Mr. Fairfield would get lost in it. Now, I know a much nicer one. There's a little house next-door to us, a lovely, little cottage that would suit you a lot better. Tell your father about it, Patty. It's for sale or rent, and it's just the dearest place.\"  \"Why, Laura Russell,\" cried Marian, \"that little snip of a house! It wouldn't hold Patty, let alone Uncle Fred. You only proposed it because you want Patty to live next-door to you.\"  \"Yes; that's it,\" said Laura, quite unabashed; \"I know it's too little, but you could add ells and bay-windows and wings and things, and then it would be big enough.\"  \"Would it hold the Tea Club?\" said Patty. \"I must have room for them, you know.\"  \"Oh, won't it be fun to have the Tea Club at Patty's house!\" cried Elsie. \"I hadn't thought of that.\"  \"What's a home without a Tea Club?\" said Patty. \"I shall select the house with an eye single to the glory and comfort of you girls.\"  \"Then I know of a lovely house,\" said Christine Converse. \"It's awfully big, and it's pretty old, but I guess it could be fixed up. I mean the old Warner place.\"  \"Good gracious!\" cried Ethel; \"'way out there! and it's nothing but a tumble-down old barn, anyhow.\"  \"Oh, I think it's lovely; and it's Colonial, or Revolutionary, or something historic; and they're going to put the trolley out there this spring,--my father said so.\"  \"It is a nice old house,\" said Patty; \"and it could be made awfully pretty and quaint. I can see it, now, in my mind's eye, with dimity curtains at the windows, and roses growing over the porch.\"  \"I hope you will never see those dimity curtains anywhere but in your mind's eye,\" said Marian. \"It's a heathenish old place, and, anyway, it's too far away from our house.\"  \"Papa says I can have a pony and cart,\" said Patty; \"and I could drive over every day.\"  \""]]]
