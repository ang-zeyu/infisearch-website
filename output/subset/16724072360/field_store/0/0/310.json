Mr. Berkley's key, with Mr. Berkley's compliments, sir.\" And he laid it upon the table by the box.  \"Thank you.  That will be all.\"  \"Thank _you_, sir.  Good night, sir.\"  \"Good night.\"  The Colonel picked up the evening paper and opened it mechanically:  \"By telegraph!\" he read, \"War inevitable.  Postscript!  Fort Sumter!  It is now certain that the Government has decided to reinforce Major Andersen's command at all hazards----\"  The lines in the _Evening Post_ blurred under his eyes; he passed one broad, bony hand across them, straightened his shoulders, and, setting the unlighted cigar firmly between his teeth, composed himself to read.  But after a few minutes he had read enough.  He dropped deeper into his arm-chair, groping for the miniature of Berkley's mother.   As for Berkley, he was at last alone with his letters and his keepsakes, in the lodgings which he inhabited--and now would inhabit no more.  The letters lay still unopened before him on his writing table; he stood looking at the miniatures and photographs, all portraits of his mother, from girlhood onward.  One by one he took them up, examined them--touched them to his lips, laid each away.  The letters he also laid away unopened; he could not bear to read them now.  The French clock in his bedroom struck eight.  He closed and locked his desk, stood looking at it blankly for a moment; then he squared his shoulders.  An envelope lay open on the desk beside him.  \"Oh--yes,\" he said aloud, but scarcely heard his own voice.  The envelope enclosed an invitation from one, Camilla Lent, to a theatre party for that evening, and a dance afterward.  He had a vague idea that he had accepted.  The play was \"The Seven Sisters\" at Laura, Keene's Theatre.  The dance was somewhere--probably at Delmonico's.  If he were going, it was time he was afoot.  His eyes wandered from one familiar object to another; he moved restlessly, and began to roam through the richly furnished rooms. But to Berkley nothing in the world seemed familiar any longer; and the strangeness of it, and the solitude were stupefying him.  When he became tired trying to think, he made the tour again in a stupid sort of way, then rang for his servant, Burgess, and started mechanically about his dressing.  Nothing any longer seemed real, not even pain.  He rang for Burgess again, but the fellow did not appear.  So he dressed without aid.  And at last he was ready; and went out, drunk with fatigue and the reaction from pain.  He did not afterward remember how he came to the theatre. Presently he found himself in a lower tier box, talking to a Mrs. Paige who, curiously, miraculously, resembled the girlish portraits of his mother--or he imagined so--until he noticed that her hair was yellow and her eyes blue.  And he laughed crazily to himself, inwardly convulsed; and then his own voice sounded again, low, humorous, caressingly modulated; and he listened to it, amused that he was able to speak at all.  \"And so you are the wonderful Ailsa Paige,\" he heard himself repeating.  \"Camilla wrote me that I must beware of my peace of mind the moment I first set eyes on you----\"  \"Camilla Lent is supremely silly, Mr. Berkley----\"  \"Camilla is a sibyl.  This night my peace of mind departed for ever.\"  \"May I offer you a little of mine?\"  \"I may ask more than that of you?\"  \"You mean a dance?\"  \"More than one.\"  \"How many?\"  \"All of them.  How many will you give me?\"  \"One.  Please look at the stage.  Isn't Laura Keene bewitching?\"  \"Your voice is.\"  \"Such nonsense.  Besides, I'd rather hear what Laura Keene is saying than listen to you.\"  \"Do you mean it?\"  \"Incredible as it may sound, Mr. Berkley, I really do.\"  He dropped back in the box.  Camilla laid her painted fan across his arm.  \"Isn't Ailsa Paige the most enchanting creature you ever saw?  I told you so!  _Isn't_ she?\"  \"Except one.  I was looking at some pictures of her a half an hour ago.\"  \"She must be very beautiful,\" sighed Camilla.  \"She was.\"  \"Oh. . . . Is she dead?\"  \"Murdered.\"  Camilla looked at the stage in horrified silence.  Later she touched him again on the arm, timidly.  \"Are you not well, Mr. Berkley?\"  \"Perfectly.  Why?\"  \"You are so pale.  Do look at Ailsa Paige.  I am completely enamoured of her.  Did you ever see such a lovely creature in all your life?  And she is very young but very wise.  She knows useful and charitable things--like nursing the sick, and dressing injuries, and her own hats.  And she actually served a whole year in the horrible city hospital!  Wasn't it brave of her!\"  Berkley swayed forward to look at Ailsa Paige.  He began to be tormented again by the feverish idea that she resembled the girl pictures of his mother.  Nor could he rid himself of the fantastic impression.  In the growing unreality of it all, in the distorted outlines of a world gone topsy-turvy, amid the deadly blurr of things material and mental, Ailsa Paige's face alone remained strangely clear.  And, scarcely knowing what he was saying, he leaned forward to her shoulder again.  \"There was only one other like you,\" he said.  Mrs. Paige turned slowly and looked at him, but the quiet rebuke in her eyes remained unuttered.  \"Be more genuine with me,\" she said gently.  \"I am worth it, Mr. Berkley.\"  Then, suddenly there seemed to run a pale flash through his brain,  \"Yes,\" he said in an altered voice, \"you are worth it. . . .  Don't drive me away from you just yet.\"  \"Drive you away?\" in soft concern.  \"I did not mean----\"  \"You will, some day.  But don't do it to-night.\" Then the quick, feverish smile broke out.  \"Do you need a servant?  I'm out of a place.  I can either cook, clean silver, open the door, wash sidewalks, or wait on the table; so you see I have every qualification.\"  Smilingly perplexed, she let her eyes rest on his pallid face for a moment, then turned toward the stage again.  The \"Seven Sisters\" pursued its spectacular course; Ione Burke, Polly Marshall, and Mrs. Vining were in the cast; tableau succeeded tableau; \"I wish I were in Dixie,\" was sung, and the popular burlesque ended in the celebrated scene, \"The Birth of the Butterfly in the Bower of Ferns,\" with the entire company kissing their finger-tips to a vociferous and satiated audience.  Then it was supper at Delmonico's, and a dance--and at last the waltz promised him by Ailsa Paige.  Through the fixed unreality of things he saw her clearly, standing, awaiting him, saw her sensitive face as she quietly laid her hand on his--saw it suddenly alter as the light contact startled both.  Flushed, she looked up at him like a hurt child, conscious yet only of the surprise.  Dazed, he stared back.  Neither spoke; his arm encircled her; both seemed aware of that; then only of the swaying rhythm of the dance, and of joined hands, and her waist imprisoned.  Only the fragrance of her hair seemed real to him; and the long lashes resting on curved cheeks, and the youth of her yielding to his embrace.  Neither spoke when it had ended.  She turned aside and stood motionless a moment, resting against the stair rail as though to steady herself.  Her small head was lowered.  He managed to say: \"You will give me the next?\"  \"No.\"  \"Then the next----\"  \"No,\" she said, not moving.  A young fellow came up eagerly, cocksure of her, but she shook her head--and shook her head to all--and Berkley remained standing beside her.  And at last her reluctant head turned slowly, and, slowly, her gaze searched his.  \"Shall we rest?\" he said.  \"Yes.  I am--tired.\"  Her dainty avalanche of skirts filled the stairs as she settled there in silence; he at her feet, turned sideways so that he could look up into the brooding, absent eyes.  And over them again--over the small space just then allotted them in the world--was settling once more the intangible, indefinable spell awakened by their first light contact.  Through its silence hurried their pulses; through its significance her dazed young eyes looked out into a haze where nothing stirred except a phantom heart, beating, beating the reveille.  And the spell lay heavy on them both.  \"I shall bear your image always.  You know it.\"  She seemed scarcely to have heard him.  \"There is no reason in what I say.  I know it.  Yet--I am destined never to forget you.\"  She made no sign.  \"Ailsa Paige,\" he said mechanically.  And after a long while, slowly, she looked down at him where he sat at her feet, his dark eyes fixed on space.     CHAPTER II  All the morning she had been busy in the Craig's backyard garden, clipping, training, loosening the earth around lilac, honeysuckle, and Rose of Sharon.  The little German florist on the corner had sent in two loads of richly fertilised soil and a barrel of forest mould.  These she sweetened with lime, mixed in her small pan, and applied judiciously to the peach-tree by the grape-arbour, to the thickets of pearl-gray iris, to the beloved roses, prairie climber, Baltimore bell, and General Jacqueminot.  A neighbour's cat, war-scarred and bold, traversing the fences in search of single combat, halted to watch her; an early bee, with no blossoms yet to rummage, passed and repassed, buzzing distractedly.  The Craig's next-door neighbour, Camilla Lent, came out on her back veranda and looked down with a sleepy nod of recognition and good-morning, stretching her pretty arms luxuriously in the sunshine.  \"You look very sweet down there, Ailsa, in your pink gingham apron and garden gloves.\"  \"And you look very sweet up there, Camilla, in your muslin frock and satin skin!  And every time you yawn you resemble a plump, white magnolia bud opening just enough to show the pink inside!\"  \"It's mean to call me plump!\" returned Camilla reproachfully. \"Anyway, anybody would yawn with the Captain keeping the entire household awake all night.  I vow, I haven't slept one wink since that wretched news from Charleston.

But nowhere did he catch a glimpse of his old friend. The longer he looked, the more excited he grew.  \"What's the matter with you?\" asked Jimmy Skunk, meeting Unc' Billy on the Crooked Little Path near the top of the hill.  \"Nuffin, nuffin, Sah! Ah'm just walking fo' mah health,\" replied Unc' Billy over his shoulder, as he hurried on. You see he didn't like to tell any one what he thought he had heard, for fear that it might not be true, and then they would laugh at him.  \"Didn't suppose Unc' Billy ever worried about his health,\" muttered Jimmy Skunk with a puzzled look, as he watched Unc' Billy disappear.  Just as jolly, round, red Mr. Sun dropped out of sight behind the Purple Hills, Unc' Billy gave it up and turned toward home. His neck ached from looking up in the tree-tops, and his feet were sore from walking. And just then Unc' Billy for the first time thought of that dinner that old Mrs. Possum had sent him to get. Unc' Billy sat down and mopped his brow in dismay.  \"Ah 'specks Ah'm in fo' it this time, sho' enough!\" he said.     IV   UNC' BILLY COMES HOME  Unc' Billy Possum crept along in the darkest shadows he could find as he drew near to the great hollow tree which is his home.  \"Ah 'specks Ah'm in fo' it. Ah 'specks Ah sho'ly am in fo' it this time,\" he kept muttering.  So Unc' Billy crept along in the black shadows until he got where he could look up and see his own doorway. Then he sat down and watched a while. All was still. There wasn't a sound in the great hollow tree.  \"Perhaps mah ol' woman am out calling, and Ah can slip in and go to bed before she gets back,\" said Unc' Billy hopefully to himself, as he started to climb the great hollow tree.  But at the first scratch of his toe-nails on the bark the sharp face of old Mrs. Possum appeared in the doorway.  \"Good evening, mah dear,\" said Unc' Billy, in the mildest kind of a voice.  Old Mrs. Possum said nothing, but Unc' Billy felt as if her sharp black eyes were looking right through him.  Unc' Billy grinned a sickly kind of grin as he said:  \"Ah hopes yo'alls are feeling good tonight.\"  \"Where's that dinner Ah sent yo' fo'?\" demanded old Mrs. Possum sharply.  Unc' Billy fidgeted uneasily. \"Ah done brought yo' two eggs from Farmer Brown's hen-house,\" he replied meekly.  \"Two eggs! Two eggs! How do yo' think Ah am going to feed eight hungry mouths on two eggs?\" snapped old Mrs. Possum.  Unc' Billy hung his head. He hadn't a word to say. He just couldn't tell her that he had spent the whole day tramping through the Green Forest looking for an old friend, whose voice he had thought he heard, when he ought to have been helping her find a dinner for the eight little Possums. No, Sir, Unc' Billy hadn't a word to say.  My, my, my, how old Mrs. Possum did scold, as she came down the great hollow tree to get the two eggs. Unc' Billy knew that he deserved every bit of it. He felt very miserable, and he was too tired to have a bit of spirit left. So he just sat at the foot of the great hollow tree and said nothing, while old Mrs. Possum bit a hole in the end of one egg and began to suck it. All the time she was looking at Unc' Billy with those sharp eyes of hers. When she had finished the egg, she pushed the other over to him.  \"Yo' eat that!\" she said shortly. \"Yo' look as if yo' hadn't had anything to eat to-day\" (which was true). \"Then yo' hustle up to bed; it's all ready fo' yo'.\"  Unc' Billy did as he was bid, and as he tucked himself into his snug, warm bed he murmured sleepily:    \"Ol' Mrs. Possum has a sharp, sharp tongue,     But her bark is worse than her bite.   For Ol' Mrs. Possum has a soft, soft heart     Though she hides it way out of sight.\"     V   SAMMY JAY IS INDIGNANT  Sammy Jay was indignant. Yes, Sir, Sammy Jay was very much put out. In fact, Sammy was just plain downright mad! It is bad enough to be found out and blamed for the things you really do, but to be blamed for things that you don't do and don't even know anything about is more than even Mr. Jaybird can stand. It had begun when he met Jimmy Skunk early in the morning.  \"Hello, Sammy Jay! What were you doing up so late last night?\" said Jimmy Skunk.  \"I wasn't up late; I went to bed at my usual hour, just after Mr. Sun went to bed behind the Purple Hills,\" replied Sammy Jay.  \"Oh, come, Sammy Jay, be honest for once in your life! It was a long, long, long time after Mr. Sun went to bed that I heard you screaming and making a great fuss over in the Green Forest. What was it all about?\"  Sammy Jay stamped one foot. He was beginning to lose his temper. You know he loses it very easily. \"I am honest!\" he screamed. \"I tell you I went to bed just as I always do, and I didn't wake up until this morning.\"  \"Then you must talk something dreadful in your sleep,\" said Jimmy Skunk, turning his back on Sammy Jay, who was so mad by this time that for a few minutes he couldn't find his tongue. When he did, he flew off screaming at the top of his lungs. He was still screaming when he flew over the Old Briar-patch where Peter Rabbit was just beginning to doze off.  Peter was sleepy. He didn't like to have his morning nap disturbed.  \"Hi, Sammy Jay! Didn't you make racket enough last night to give honest folks a little peace and quiet to-day?\" shouted Peter Rabbit.  Sammy Jay flew up into a young cherry tree on the edge of the Old Briar-patch, and his eyes were fairly red with anger as he glared down at Peter Rabbit.  \"What's the joke, Peter Rabbit? That's the second time this morning that I've been told that I was screaming last night, when all the time I was fast asleep,\" said Sammy Jay.  \"Then it's a funny way you have of sleeping,\" replied Peter Rabbit. \"Come, Sammy, be honest and tell me what you were yelling 'thief' for, over in the Green Forest?\"  \"Peter Rabbit, you and Jimmy Skunk are crazy, just as crazy as loons!\" sputtered Sammy Jay. \"I tell you I was asleep, and I guess I ought to know!\"  \"And I guess I know your voice when I hear it!\" replied Peter Rabbit. \"It's bad enough in daytime, but if I was you, I'd quit yelling in the night. Some one of these times Hooty the Owl will hear you, and that will be the end of you and your noise. Now go away; I want to sleep.\"  Sammy went. He was mad clear through, and yet he didn't know what to make of it. Were they just trying to make him mad, or had he really been screaming in his sleep? He flew over to the Smiling Pool. Jerry Muskrat looked up and saw him.  \"What were you yelling about in the night, Sammy Jay?\" asked Jerry.  This was too much. Sammy Jay let his wings and his tail droop dejectedly and hung his head.  \"I don't know. I really don't know anything about it,\" he said.     VI   SAMMY JAY THINKS HE'S GOING CRAZY    \"Sammy Jay screams all day long,     And now what do you think?   Why, Sammy sits and yells all night     And doesn't sleep a wink!\"  Everywhere he went Sammy Jay heard that shouted after him. Dozens and dozens of times a day he heard it. At first he lost his temper and was the very maddest Jaybird ever seen on the Green Meadows or in the Green Forest.  \"It isn't true! It isn't true! It isn't true!\" he would scream at the top of his lungs.  And then everybody within hearing would shout: \"It _is_ true!\"  Sammy would just dance up and down and scream and scream and scream, he was so angry. And then he was sure to hear some one pipe up:    \"Sammy's mad and we are glad,     And we know how to tease him!   But some dark night he'll get a fright,     For Hooty'll come and seize him!\"  That really began to worry him. At first he had thought that it was all a joke on the part of the little people of the Green Forest and the Green Meadows, and that they had made up the story about hearing him in the night. Then he began to think that it might be true that he did talk in his sleep, and this worried him a whole lot. If he did that, Hooty the Owl would surely find him sooner or later, and in the morning there wouldn't be anything left of him but a few feathers from his fine coat.  The more he thought about it, the more worried Sammy Jay became. He lost his appetite and began to grow thin. He kept out of sight whenever possible and no longer screamed \"Thief! thief!\" through the Green Forest. In fact his voice was rarely heard during the day. But it seemed that he must be talking just as much as ever in the night. At least everybody said that he was. Worse still, different ones said that they heard him in different places in the Green Forest and even down on the Green Meadows. Could it be that he was flying about as well as talking in his sleep? And nobody believed him when he said that he was asleep all night. They thought that he was awake and doing it purposely. They might have known that he couldn't see in the night, for his eyes are made for daylight and not for darkness, like the eyes of Boomer the Nighthawk and Hooty the Owl. But they didn't seem to think of this, and insisted that almost every night they heard him down in the alders along the Laughing Brook. Yet every morning when he awoke, Sammy would find himself just where he went to sleep the night before, safely hidden in the thickest part of a big pine-tree.  \"If they are not all crazy, then I must be,\" said. Sammy Jay to himself, as he turned away from the breakfast which he could not eat. Then he had a happy idea. \"Why didn't I think of it before? I'll sleep all day, and then I'll keep awake all night and see what happens then!\" he exclaimed.  So Sammy Jay hurried away to the darkest part of the Green Forest and tried to sleep through the day.     VII   SAMMY JAY SITS UP ALL NIGHT  Sammy Jay sat in the dark and shivered. Sammy was lonely, more lonely than he had ever supposed anybody could be. And to tell the truth Sammy Jay was scared. Yes, Sir, that was just the way Sammy Jay felt--scared. Every time a leaf rustled, Sammy jumped almost out of his skin. His heart went pit-a-pat, pit-a-pat, pit-a-pat. He could hear it himself, or at least he"]]]
