Thus she was in every respect more developed than her contemporary Lucy, who regarded her with wonder as well as affection, and she was the object of the boyish devotion of Charley, who often defended her from his cousin Sedley's endeavours to put down what he considered upstart airs in a little nobody from London.  Sedley teased and baited every weak thing in his way, and Lucy had been his chief butt till Anne Woodford's unconscious dignity and more cultivated manners excited his utmost spleen.  Lucy might be incredulous, but she was eager to tell that when her cousin Sedley Archfield was going back to 'chambers,' down from the Close gate came the imp on his shoulders in the twilight and twisted both legs round his neck, holding tight on in spite of plunges, pinches, and endeavours to scrape him off against the wall, which were frustrated or retaliated by hair pulling, choking, till just ere entering the college gateway, where Sedley looked to get his revenge among his fellows, he found his shoulders free, and heard \"Ho! ho! ho!\" from the top of a wall close at hand.  All the more was the young people's faith in the changeling story confirmed, and child-world was in those days even more impenetrable to their elders than at present.  Changeling or no, it was certain that Peregrine Oakshott was the plague of the Close, where his father, an ex-officer of the Parliamentary army, had unwillingly hired a house for the winter, for the sake of medical treatment for his wife, a sufferer from a complication of ailments.  Oakwood, his home, was about five miles from Dr. Woodford's living of Portchester, and as the families would thus be country neighbours, Mrs. Woodford thought it well to begin the acquaintance at Winchester.  While knocking at the door of the house on the opposite side of the Close, she was aware of an elfish visage peering from an upper window.  There was the queer mop of dark hair, the squinting light eyes, the contorted grin crooking the mouth, the odd sallow face, making her quite glad to get out of sight of the strange grimaces which grew every moment more hideous.  Mrs. Oakshott sat in an arm-chair beside a large fire in a wainscotted room, with a folding-screen shutting off the window. Her spinning-wheel was near, but it was only too plain that 'feeble was the hand, and silly the thread.'  She bent her head in its wadded black velvet hood, but excused herself from rising, as she was crippled by rheumatic pains.  She had evidently once been a pretty little person, innocent and inane, and her face had become like that of a withered baby, piteous in its expression of pain and weariness, but otherwise somewhat vacant.  At first, indeed, there was a look of alarm.  Perhaps she expected every visitor to come with a complaint of her unlucky Peregrine, but when Mrs. Woodford spoke cheerfully of being her neighbour in the country, she was evidently relieved and even gratified, prattling in a soft plaintive tone about her sufferings and the various remedies, ranging from woodlice rolled into natural pills, and grease off the church bells, to diamond dust and Goa stones, since, as she said, there was no cost to which Major Oakshott would not go for her benefit.  He had even procured for her a pound of the Queen's new Chinese herb, and it certainly was as nauseous as could be wished, when boiled in milk, but she was told that was not the way it was taken at my Lady Charnock's.  She was quite animated when Mrs. Woodford offered to show her how to prepare it.  Therewith the master of the house came in, and the aspect of affairs changed.  He was a tall, dark, grave man, plainly though handsomely dressed, and in a gentlemanly way making it evident that visits to his wife were not welcome.  He said that her health never permitted her to go abroad, and that his poor house contained nothing that could please a Court lady.  Mrs. Oakshott shrank into herself, and became shy and silent, and Mrs. Woodford felt constrained to take leave, courteously conducted to the door by her unwilling host.  She had not taken many steps before she was startled by a sharp shower from a squirt coming sidelong like a blow on her cheek and surprising her into a low cry, which was heard by the Major, so that he hastened out, exclaiming, \"Madam, I trust that you are not hurt.\"  \"Oh no, sir!  It is nothing--not a stone--only water!\" she said, wiping it with her handkerchief.  \"I am grieved and ashamed at the evil pranks of my unhappy son, but he shall suffer for it.\"  \"Nay, sir, I pray you.  It was only childish mischief.\"  He had not waited to hear her pleadings, and before she was half across the Close he had overtaken her, dragging the cowering struggling boy in his powerful grasp.  \"Now, Peregrine,\" he commanded, \"let me instantly hear you ask the lady's pardon for your dastardly trick.  Or--!\" and his other hand was raised for a blow.  \"I am sure he is sorry,\" said Mrs. Woodford, making a motion to ward off the stroke, and as the queer eyes glanced up at her in wondering inquiry, she laid her hand on the bony shoulder, saying, \"I know you did not mean to hurt me.  You are sorry, are you not?\"  \"Ay,\" the boy muttered, and she saw a look of surprise on his father's face.  \"There,\" she said, \"he has made his amends, and surely that may suffice.\"  \"Nay, madam, it would be a weak and ungodly tenderness that would spare to drive forth the evil spirit which possesses the child by the use of the rod.  I should fail in my duty alike to God and man,\" he added, in reply to a fresh gesture of intercession, \"did I not teach him what it is to insult a lady at mine own door.\"  Mrs. Woodford could only go away, heartily sorry for the boy.  From that time, however, both she and her little daughter were untouched by his tricks, though every one else had some complaint.  Peas were shot from unknown recesses at venerable canons, mice darted out before shrieking ladies, frogs' clammy forms descended on the nape of their necks, hedgehogs were curled up on their chairs, and though Peregrine Oakshott was not often caught in the act, no mischief ever took place that was not attributed to him; and it was popularly believed in the Close that his father flogged him every morning for what he was about to do, and his tutor repeated the castigation every evening for what he had done, besides interludes at each detection.  Perhaps frequent usage had toughened his skin, or he had become expert in wriggling from the full force of the blow, or else, as many believed, the elfish nature was impervious; for he was as ready as ever for a trick the moment he was released, like, as his brother said, the dog Keeper, who, with a slaughtered chick hung round his neck in penance, rushed murderously upon the rest of the brood.  Yet Mrs. Woodford, on her way through the Cathedral nave, was aware of something leaning against one of the great columns, crouching together so that the dark head, supported on the arms, rested against the pillar which fluted the pier.  The organ was pealing softly and plaintively, and the little gray coat seemed to heave as with a sob.  She stood, impelled to offer to take him with her into the choir, but a verger, spying him, began rating him in a tone fit for expelling a dog, \"Come, master, none of your pranks here!  Be not you ashamed of yourself to be lying in wait for godly folk on their way to prayers?  If I catch you here again the Dean shall hear of it, and you shall smart for it.\"  Mrs. Woodford began, \"He was only hearkening to the music,\" but she caught such a look of malignity cast upon the verger as perfectly appalled her, and in another moment the boy had dashed, head over heels, out at the nearest door.  The next report that reached her related how a cloud of lime had suddenly descended from a broken arch of the cloister on the solemn verger, on his way to escort the Dean to the Minster, powdering his wig, whitening his black gown from collar to hem, and not a little endangering his eyesight.  The culprit eluded all pursuit on this occasion; but Mrs. Woodford soon after was told that the Major had caught Peregrine listening at the little south door of the choir, had collared him, and flogged him worse than ever, for being seduced by the sounds of the popish and idolatrous worship, and had told all his sons that the like chastisement awaited them if they presumed to cross the threshold of the steeple house.  Nevertheless the Senior Prefect of the college boys, when about to come out of the Cathedral on Sunday morning, found his gown pinned with a skewer so fast to the seat that he was only set free at the expense of a rent.  Public opinion decided that the deed had been done by the imp of Oakshott, and accordingly the whole of the Wykeham scholars set on him with hue and cry the first time they saw him outside the Close, and hunted him as far as St. Cross, where he suddenly and utterly vanished from their sight.  Mrs. Woodford agreed with Anne that it was a very strange story. For how could he have been in the Cathedral at service time when it was well known that Major Oakshott had all his family together at his own form of worship in his house?  Anne, who had been in hopes that her mother would be thus convinced of his supernatural powers, looked disappointed, but she had afterwards to confess that Charles Archfield had found out that it was his cousin Sedley Archfield who had played the audacious trick, in revenge for a well-merited tunding from the Prefect.  \"And then saddled it on young Oakshott?\" asked her mother.  \"Charley says one such matter more or less makes no odds to the Whig ape; but I cannot endure Sedley Archfield, mamma.\"  \"If he lets another lad bear the blame of his malice he cannot indeed be a good lad.\"  \"So Charley and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12454"],["title","France at War: On the Frontier of Civilization (#1)"],["body","new voice which had lifted itself for the second or third time.  It appeared from the reply that if Belial talked too long he would be dealt with from another point miles away.  The troops we came down to see were at rest in a chain of caves which had begun life as quarries and had been fitted up by the army for its own uses.  There were underground corridors, ante-chambers, rotundas, and ventilating shafts with a bewildering play of cross lights, so that wherever you looked you saw Goya's pictures of men-at-arms.  Every soldier has some of the old maid in him, and rejoices in all the gadgets and devices of his own invention.  Death and wounding come by nature, but to lie dry, sleep soft, and keep yourself clean by forethought and contrivance is art, and in all things the Frenchman is gloriously an artist.  Moreover, the French officers seem as mother-keen on their men as their men are brother-fond of them.  Maybe the possessive form of address:  \"Mon general,\" \"mon capitaine,\" helps the idea, which our men cloke in other and curter phrases.  And those soldiers, like ours, had been welded for months in one furnace.  As an officer said:  \"Half our orders now need not be given.  Experience makes us think together.\"  I believe, too, that if a French private has an idea--and they are full of ideas--it reaches his C. 0. quicker than it does with us.  THE SENTINEL HOUNDS  The overwhelming impression was the brilliant health and vitality of these men and the quality of their breeding.  They bore themselves with swing and rampant delight in life, while their voices as they talked in the side-caverns among the stands of arms were the controlled voices of civilization. Yet, as the lights pierced the gloom they looked like bandits dividing the spoil.  One picture, though far from war, stays with me.  A perfectly built, dark-skinned young giant had peeled himself out of his blue coat and had brought it down with a swish upon the shoulder of a half-stripped comrade who was kneeling at his feet with some footgear.  They stood against a background of semi-luminous blue haze, through which glimmered a pile of coppery straw half covered by a red blanket.  By divine accident of light and pose it St. Martin giving his cloak to the beggar.  There were scores of pictures in these galleries--notably a rock-hewn chapel where the red of the cross on the rough canvas altar-cloth glowed like a ruby.  Further inside the caves we found a row of little rock-cut kennels, each inhabited by one wise, silent dog. Their duties begin in at night with the sentinels and listening-posts.  \"And believe me,\" a proud instructor, \"my fellow here knows the difference between the noise of our shells and the Boche shells.\"  When we came out into the open again there were good opportunities for this study.  Voices and wings met and passed in the air, and, perhaps, one strong young tree had not been bending quite so far across the picturesque park-drive when we first went that way.  \"Oh, yes,\" said an officer, \"shells have to fall somewhere, and,\" he added with fine toleration, \"it is, after all, against us that the Boche directs them.  But come you and look at my dug-out.  It's the most superior of all possible dug-outs.\"  \"No.  Come and look at our mess.  It's the Ritz of these parts.\"  And they joyously told how they had got, or procured, the various fittings and elegancies, while hands stretched out of the gloom to shake, and men nodded welcome and greeting all through that cheery brotherhood in the woods.  WORK IN THE FIELDS  The voices and the wings were still busy after lunch, when the car slipped past the tea-houses in the drive, and came into a country where women and children worked among the crops. There were large raw shell holes by the wayside or in the midst of fields, and often a cottage or a villa had been smashed as a bonnet-box is smashed by an umbrella.  That must be part of Belial's work when he bellows so truculently among the hills to the north.  We were looking for a town that lives under shell-fire.  The regular road to it was reported unhealthy--not that the women and children seemed to care.  We took byways of which certain exposed heights and corners were lightly blinded by wind-brakes of dried tree-tops.  Here the shell holes were rather thick on the ground.  But the women and the children and the old men went on with their work with the cattle and the crops; and where a house had been broken by shells the rubbish was collected in a neat pile, and where a room or two still remained usable, it was inhabited, and the tattered window-curtains fluttered as proudly as any flag.  And time was when I used to denounce young France because it tried to kill itself beneath my car wheels; and the fat old women who crossed roads without warning; and the specially deaf old men who slept in carts on the wrong side of the road!  Now, I could take off my hat to every single soul of them, but that one cannot traverse a whole land bareheaded.  The nearer we came to our town the fewer were the people, till at last we halted in a well-built suburb of paved streets where there was no life at all. . . .  A WRECKED TOWN  The stillness was as terrible as the spread of the quick busy weeds between the paving-stones; the air smelt of pounded mortar and crushed stone; the sound of a footfall echoed like the drop of a pebble in a well.  At first the horror of wrecked apartment-houses and big shops laid open makes one waste energy in anger.  It is not seemly that rooms should be torn out of the sides of buildings as one tears the soft heart out of English bread; that villa roofs should lie across iron gates of private garages, or that drawing-room doors should flap alone and disconnected between two emptinesses of twisted girders.  The eye wearies of the repeated pattern that burst shells make on stone walls, as the mouth sickens of the taste of mortar and charred timber.  One quarter of the place had been shelled nearly level; the facades of the houses stood doorless, roofless, and windowless like stage scenery.  This was near the cathedral, which is always a favourite mark for the heathen.  They had gashed and ripped the sides of the cathedral itself, so that the birds flew in and out at will; they had smashed holes in the roof; knocked huge cantles out of the buttresses, and pitted and starred the paved square outside.  They were at work, too, that very afternoon, though I do not think the cathedral was their objective for the moment.  We walked to and fro in the silence of the streets and beneath the whirring wings overhead.  Presently, a young woman, keeping to the wall, crossed a corner.  An old woman opened a shutter (how it jarred!), and spoke to her.  The silence closed again, but it seemed to me that I heard a sound of singing--the sort of chant one hears in nightmare-cities of voices crying from underground.  IN THE CATHEDRAL  \"Nonsense,\" said an officer.  \"Who should be singing here?\" We circled the cathedral again, and saw what pavement-stones can do against their own city, when the shell jerks them upward.  But there _was_ singing after all--on the other side of a little door in the flank of the cathedral.  We looked in, doubting, and saw at least a hundred folk, mostly women, who knelt before the altar of an unwrecked chapel.  We withdrew quietly from that holy ground, and it was not only the eyes of the French officers that filled with tears.  Then there came an old, old thing with a prayer-book in her hand, pattering across the square, evidently late for service.  \"And who are those women?\" I asked.  \"Some are caretakers; people who have still little shops here. (There is one quarter where you can buy things.)  There are many old people, too, who will not go away.  They are of the place, you see.\"  \"And this bombardment happens often?\" I said.  \"It happens always.  Would you like to look at the railway station?  Of course, it has not been so bombarded as the cathedral.\"  We went through the gross nakedness of streets without people, till we reached the railway station, which was very fairly knocked about, but, as my friends said, nothing like as much as the cathedral.  Then we had to cross the end of a long street down which the Boche could see clearly.  As one glanced up it, one perceived how the weeds, to whom men's war is the truce of God, had come back and were well established the whole length of it, watched by the long perspective of open, empty windows.    II  THE NATION'S SPIRIT AND A NEW INHERITANCE   We left that stricken but undefeated town, dodged a few miles down the roads beside which the women tended their cows, and dropped into a place on a hill where a Moroccan regiment of many experiences was in billets.  They were Mohammedans bafflingly like half a dozen of our Indian frontier types, though they spoke no accessible tongue. They had, of course, turned the farm buildings where they lay into a little bit of Africa in colour and smell.  They had been gassed in the north; shot over and shot down, and set up to be shelled again; and their officers talked of North African wars that we had never heard of--sultry days against long odds in the desert years ago.  \"Afterward--is it not so with you also?--we get our best recruits from the tribes we have fought.  These men are children.  They make no trouble. They only want to go where cartridges are burnt.  They are of the few races to whom fighting is a pleasure.\"  \"And how long have you dealt with them?\"  \"A long time--a long time.  I helped to organize the corps.  I am one of those whose heart is in Africa.\"  He spoke slowly, almost feeling for his French words, and gave some order.  I shall not forget his eyes as he turned to a huge, brown, Afreedee-like Mussulman hunkering down beside his accoutrements.  He had two sides to his head, that bearded, burned, slow-spoken officer, met and parted with in an hour.  The day closed--(after an amazing interlude in the chateau of a"]]]
