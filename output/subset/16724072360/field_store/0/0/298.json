Yes, of exalted people, and even of their near associates, life, because it aims more high than the aforementioned Aristotle, demands upon occasion a more great catharsis, which would purge any audience of unmanliness, through pity and through terror, because, by a quaint paradox, the players have been purged of humanity. For a moment Destiny has thrust her scepter into the hands of a human being and Chance has exalted a human being to decide the issue of many human lives. These two--with what immortal chucklings one may facilely imagine--have left the weakling thus enthroned, free to direct the heavy outcome, free to choose, and free to evoke much happiness or age-long weeping, but with no intermediate course unbarred. _Now prove thyself_! saith Destiny; and Chance appends: _Now prove thyself to be at bottom a god or else a beast, and now eternally abide that choice. And now_ (O crowning irony!) _we may not tell thee clearly by which choice thou mayst prove either_.  In this little book about the women who intermarried, not very enviably, with an unhuman race (a race predestinate to the red ending which I have chronicled elsewhere, in _The Red Cuckold_), it is of ten such moments that I treat.  You alone, I think, of all persons living, have learned, as you have settled by so many instances, to rise above mortality in such a testing, and unfailingly to merit by your conduct the plaudits and the adoration of our otherwise dissentient world. You have often spoken in the stead of Destiny, with nations to abide your verdict; and in so doing have both graced and hallowed your high vicarship. If I forbear to speak of this at greater length, it is because I dare not couple your well-known perfection with any imperfect encomium. Upon no plea, however, can any one forbear to acknowledge that he who seeks to write of noble ladies must necessarily implore at outset the patronage of her who is the light and mainstay of our age.  _Therefore to you, madame--most excellent and noble lady, to whom I love to owe both loyalty and love--I dedicate this little book._     I  _THE STORY OF THE SESTINA_     \"Armatz de fust e de fer e d'acier, Mos ostal seran bosc, fregz,   e semdier, E mas cansos sestinas e descortz, E mantenrai los frevols   contra 'ls fortz.\"  THE FIRST NOVEL.--ALIANORA OF PROVENCE, COMING IN DISGUISE AND IN ADVERSITY TO A CERTAIN CLERK, IS BY HIM CONDUCTED ACROSS A HOSTILE COUNTRY; AND IN THAT TROUBLED JOURNEY ARE MADE MANIFEST TO EACH THE SNARES WHICH HAD BEGUILED THEM AFORETIME.     The Story of the Sestina   In this place we have to do with the opening tale of the Dizain of Queens. I abridge, as afterward, at discretion; and an initial account of the Barons' War, among other superfluities, I amputate as more remarkable for veracity than interest. The result, we will agree at outset, is that to the Norman cleric appertains whatever these tales may have of merit, whereas what you find distasteful in them you must impute to my delinquencies in skill rather than in volition.  Within the half hour after de Giars' death (here one overtakes Nicolas mid-course in narrative) Dame Alianora thus stood alone in the corridor of a strange house. Beyond the arras the steward and his lord were at irritable converse.  First, \"If the woman be hungry,\" spoke a high and peevish voice, \"feed her. If she need money, give it to her. But do not annoy me.\"  \"This woman demands to see the master of the house,\" the steward then retorted.  \"O incredible Boeotian, inform her that the master of the house has no time to waste upon vagabonds who select the middle of the night as an eligible time to pop out of nowhere. Why did you not do so in the beginning, you dolt?\" The speaker got for answer only a deferential cough, and very shortly continued: \"This is remarkably vexatious. _Vox et praeterea nihil_--which signifies, Yeck, that to converse with women is always delightful. Admit her.\" This was done, and Dame Alianora came into an apartment littered with papers, where a neat and shriveled gentleman of fifty-odd sat at a desk and scowled.  He presently said, \"You may go, Yeck.\" He had risen, the magisterial attitude with which he had awaited her entrance cast aside. \"Oh, God!\" he said; \"you, madame!\" His thin hands, scholarly hands, were plucking at the air.  Dame Alianora had paused, greatly astonished, and there was an interval before she said, \"I do not recognize you, messire.\"  \"And yet, madame, I recall very clearly that some thirty years ago the King-Count Raymond BÃ©renger, then reigning in Provence, had about his court four daughters, each one of whom was afterward wedded to a king. First, Meregrett, the eldest, now regnant in France; then Alianora, the second and most beautiful of these daughters, whom troubadours hymned as the Unattainable Princess. She was married a long while ago, madame, to the King of England, Lord Henry, third of that name to reign in these islands.\"  Dame Alianora's eyes were narrowing. \"There is something in your voice,\" she said, \"which I recall.\"  He answered: \"Madame and Queen, that is very likely, for it is a voice which sang a deal in Provence when both of us were younger. I concede with the Roman that I have somewhat deteriorated since the reign of Cynara. Yet have you quite forgotten the Englishman who made so many songs of you? They called him Osmund Heleigh.\"  \"He made the Sestina of Spring which won the violet crown at my betrothal,\" the Queen said; and then, with eagerness: \"Messire, can it be that you are Osmund Heleigh?\" He shrugged assent. She looked at him for a long time, rather sadly, and demanded if he were the King's man or of the barons' party.  The nervous hands were raised in deprecation. \"I have no politics,\" Messire Heleigh began, and altered it, gallantly enough, to, \"I am the Queen's man, madame.\"  \"Then aid me, Osmund,\" she said.  He answered with a gravity which singularly became him, \"You have reason to understand that to my fullest power I will aid you.\"  \"You know that at Lewes these swine overcame us.\" He nodded assent. \"Now they hold the King, my husband, captive at Kenilworth. I am content that he remain there, for he is of all the King's enemies the most dangerous. But, at Wallingford, Leicester has imprisoned my son, Prince Edward. The Prince must be freed, my Osmund. Warren de Basingbourne commands what is left of the royal army, now entrenched at Bristol, and it is he who must liberate my son. Get me to Bristol, then. Afterward we will take Wallingford.\" The Queen issued these orders in cheery, practical fashion, and did not admit opposition into the account, for she was a capable woman.  \"But you, madame?\" he stammered. \"You came alone?\"  \"I come from France, where I have been entreating--and vainly entreating--succor from yet another monkish king, the holy Lewis of that realm. Eh, what is God about when He enthrones these whining pieties! Were I a king, were I even a man, I would drive these smug English out of their foggy isle in three days' space! I would leave alive not one of these curs that dare yelp at me! I would--\" She paused, anger veering into amusement. \"See how I enrage myself when I think of what your people have made me suffer,\" the Queen said, and shrugged her shoulders. \"In effect, I skulked back in disguise to this detestable island, accompanied by Avenel de Giars and Hubert Fitz-Herveis. To-night some half-dozen fellows--robbers, thorough knaves, like all you English,--attacked us on the common yonder and slew the men of our party. While they were cutting de Giars' throat I slipped away in the dark and tumbled through many ditches till I spied your light. There you have my story. Now get me an escort to Bristol.\"  It was a long while before Messire Heleigh spoke. Then, \"These men,\" he said--\"this de Giars and this Fitz-Herveis--they gave their lives for yours, as I understand it,--_pro caris amicis_. And yet you do not grieve for them.\"  \"I shall regret de Giars,\" the Queen acknowledged, \"for he made excellent songs. But Fitz-Herveis?--foh! the man had a face like a horse.\" Again her mood changed. \"Many persons have died for me, my friend. At first I wept for them, but now I am dry of tears.\"  He shook his head. \"Cato very wisely says, 'If thou hast need of help, ask it of thy friends.' But the sweet friend that I remember was a clean eyed girl, joyous and exceedingly beautiful. Now you appear to me one of those ladies of remoter times--Faustina, or Jael, or Artemis, the King's wife of Tauris,--they that slew men, laughing. I am somewhat afraid of you, madame.\"  She was angry at first; then her face softened. \"You English!\" she said, only half mirthful. \"Eh, my God! you remember me when I was a high hearted young sorceress. Now the powers of the Apsarasas have departed from me, and time has thrust that Alianora, who was once the Unattainable Princess, chin deep in misery. Yet even now I am your Queen, messire, and it is not yours to pass judgment upon me.\" \"I do not judge you,\" he returned. \"Rather I cry with him of old, _Omnia incerta ratione!_ and I cry with Salomon that he who meddles with the strife of another man is like to him that takes a hound by the ears. Yet listen, madame and Queen. I cannot afford you an escort to Bristol. This house, of which I am in temporary charge, is Longaville, my brother's manor. Lord Brudenel, as you doubtless know, is of the barons' party and--scant cause for grief!--is with Leicester at this moment. I can trust none of my brother's people, for I believe them to be of much the same opinion as those Londoners who not long ago stoned you and would have sunk your barge in Thames River. Oh, let us not blink the fact that you are not overbeloved in England. So an escort is out of the question. Yet I, madame, if you so elect, will see you safe to Bristol.\"  \"You? Singly?\" the Queen demanded.  \"My plan is this:"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11757"],["title","The Velveteen Rabbit (#1)"],["body","and bunchy, instead of always staying the same like he did. Their feet padded softly on the ground, and they crept quite close to him, twitching their noses, while the Rabbit stared hard to see which side the clockwork stuck out, for he knew that people who jump generally have something to wind them up. But he couldn't see it. They were evidently a new kind of rabbit altogether.                               Summer Days  They stared at him, and the little Rabbit stared back. And all the time their noses twitched.  \"Why don't you get up and play with us?\" one of them asked.  \"I don't feel like it,\" said the Rabbit, for he didn't want to explain that he had no clockwork.  \"Ho!\" said the furry rabbit. \"It's as easy as anything,\" And he gave a big hop sideways and stood on his hind legs.  \"I don't believe you can!\" he said.  \"I can!\" said the little Rabbit. \"I can jump higher than anything!\" He meant when the Boy threw him, but of course he didn't want to say so.  \"Can you hop on your hind legs?\" asked the furry rabbit.  That was a dreadful question, for the Velveteen Rabbit had no hind legs at all! The back of him was made all in one piece, like a pincushion. He sat still in the bracken, and hoped that the other rabbits wouldn't notice.  \"I don't want to!\" he said again.  But the wild rabbits have very sharp eyes. And this one stretched out his neck and looked.  \"He hasn't got any hind legs!\" he called out. \"Fancy a rabbit without any hind legs!\" And he began to laugh.  \"I have!\" cried the little Rabbit. \"I have got hind legs! I am sitting on them!\"  \"Then stretch them out and show me, like this!\" said the wild rabbit. And he began to whirl round and dance, till the little Rabbit got quite dizzy.  \"I don't like dancing,\" he said. \"I'd rather sit still!\"  But all the while he was longing to dance, for a funny new tickly feeling ran through him, and he felt he would give anything in the world to be able to jump about like these rabbits did.  The strange rabbit stopped dancing, and came quite close. He came so close this time that his long whiskers brushed the Velveteen Rabbit's ear, and then he wrinkled his nose suddenly and flattened his ears and jumped backwards.  \"He doesn't smell right!\" he exclaimed. \"He isn't a rabbit at all! He isn't real!\"  \"I am Real!\" said the little Rabbit. \"I am Real! The Boy said so!\" And he nearly began to cry.  Just then there was a sound of footsteps, and the Boy ran past near them, and with a stamp of feet and a flash of white tails the two strange rabbits disappeared.  \"Come back and play with me!\" called the little Rabbit. \"Oh, do come back! I know I am Real!\"  But there was no answer, only the little ants ran to and fro, and the bracken swayed gently where the two strangers had passed. The Velveteen Rabbit was all alone.  \"Oh, dear!\" he thought. \"Why did they run away like that? Why couldn't they stop and talk to me?\"  For a long time he lay very still, watching the bracken, and hoping that they would come back. But they never returned, and presently the sun sank lower and the little white moths fluttered out, and the Boy came and carried him home.   Weeks passed, and the little Rabbit grew very old and shabby, but the Boy loved him just as much. He loved him so hard that he loved all his whiskers off, and the pink lining to his ears turned grey, and his brown spots faded. He even began to lose his shape, and he scarcely looked like a rabbit any more, except to the Boy. To him he was always beautiful, and that was all that the little Rabbit cared about. He didn't mind how he looked to other people, because the nursery magic had made him Real, and when you are Real shabbiness doesn't matter.  And then, one day, the Boy was ill.  His face grew very flushed, and he talked in his sleep, and his little body was so hot that it burned the Rabbit when he held him close. Strange people came and went in the nursery, and a light burned all night and through it all the little Velveteen Rabbit lay there, hidden from sight under the bedclothes, and he never stirred, for he was afraid that if they found him some one might take him away, and he knew that the Boy needed him.  It was a long weary time, for the Boy was too ill to play, and the little Rabbit found it rather dull with nothing to do all day long. But he snuggled down patiently, and looked forward to the time when the Boy should be well again, and they would go out in the garden amongst the flowers and the butterflies and play splendid games in the raspberry thicket like they used to. All sorts of delightful things he planned, and while the Boy lay half asleep he crept up close to the pillow and whispered them in his ear. And presently the fever turned, and the Boy got better. He was able to sit up in bed and look at picture-books, while the little Rabbit cuddled close at his side. And one day, they let him get up and dress.  It was a bright, sunny morning, and the windows stood wide open. They had carried the Boy out on to the balcony, wrapped in a shawl, and the little Rabbit lay tangled up among the bedclothes, thinking.  The Boy was going to the seaside to-morrow. Everything was arranged, and now it only remained to carry out the doctor's orders. They talked about it all, while the little Rabbit lay under the bedclothes, with just his head peeping out, and listened. The room was to be disinfected, and all the books and toys that the Boy had played with in bed must be burnt.  \"Hurrah!\" thought the little Rabbit. \"To-morrow we shall go to the seaside!\" For the boy had often talked of the seaside, and he wanted very much to see the big waves coming in, and the tiny crabs, and the sand castles.  Just then Nana caught sight of him.  \"How about his old Bunny?\" she asked.  \"That?\" said the doctor. \"Why, it's a mass of scarlet fever germs!-Burn it at once. What? Nonsense! Get him a new one. He mustn't have that any more!\"                              Anxious Times  And so the little Rabbit was put into a sack with the old picture-books and a lot of rubbish, and carried out to the end of the garden behind the fowl-house. That was a fine place to make a bonfire, only the gardener was too busy just then to attend to it. He had the potatoes to dig and the green peas to gather, but next morning he promised to come quite early and burn the whole lot.  That night the Boy slept in a different bedroom, and he had a new bunny to sleep with him. It was a splendid bunny, all white plush with real glass eyes, but the Boy was too excited to care very much about it. For to-morrow he was going to the seaside, and that in itself was such a wonderful thing that he could think of nothing else.  And while the Boy was asleep, dreaming of the seaside, the little Rabbit lay among the old picture-books in the corner behind the fowl-house, and he felt very lonely. The sack had been left untied, and so by wriggling a bit he was able to get his head through the opening and look out. He was shivering a little, for he had always been used to sleeping in a proper bed, and by this time his coat had worn so thin and threadbare from hugging that it was no longer any protection to him. Near by he could see the thicket of raspberry canes, growing tall and close like a tropical jungle, in whose shadow he had played with the Boy on bygone mornings. He thought of those long sunlit hours in the garden-how happy they were-and a great sadness came over him. He seemed to see them all pass before him, each more beautiful than the other, the fairy huts in the flower-bed, the quiet evenings in the wood when he lay in the bracken and the little ants ran over his paws; the wonderful day when he first knew that he was Real. He thought of the Skin Horse, so wise and gentle, and all that he had told him. Of what use was it to be loved and lose one's beauty and become Real if it all ended like this? And a tear, a real tear, trickled down his little shabby velvet nose and fell to the ground.  And then a strange thing happened. For where the tear had fallen a flower grew out of the ground, a mysterious flower, not at all like any that grew in the garden. It had slender green leaves the colour of emeralds, and in the centre of the leaves a blossom like a golden cup. It was so beautiful that the little Rabbit forgot to cry, and just lay there watching it. And presently the blossom opened, and out of it there stepped a fairy.  She was quite the loveliest fairy in the whole world. Her dress was of pearl and dew-drops, and there were flowers round her neck and in her hair, and her face was like the most perfect flower of all. And she came close to the little Rabbit and gathered him up in her arms and kissed him on his velveteen nose that was all damp from crying.  \"Little Rabbit,\" she said, \"don't you know who I am?\"  The Rabbit looked up at her, and it seemed to him that he had seen her face before, but he couldn't think where.  \"I am the nursery magic Fairy,\" she said. \"I take care of all the playthings that the children have loved. When they are old and worn out and the children don't need them any more, then I come and take them away with me and turn them into Real.\"  \"Wasn't I Real before?\" asked the little Rabbit.  \"You were Real to the Boy,\" the Fairy said, \"because he loved you. Now you shall be Real to every one.\"                             The Fairy Flower  And she held the little Rabbit close in her arms and flew with him into the wood.  It was light now, for the moon had risen. All the forest was beautiful, and the fronds of the bracken shone like frosted silver. In the open glade between the tree-trunks the wild rabbits danced with their shadows on the velvet grass, but when they saw the Fairy they all stopped dancing and stood round in a ring to stare at her.  \"I've brought you a new playfellow,\" the Fairy said. \"You must be very kind to him and teach him all he needs to know in Rabbit-land, for he is going to live with you for ever and ever!\"  And she kissed the little"]]]
