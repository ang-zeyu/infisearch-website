A great cloak of brotherhood seemed to have enveloped everybody and everything, even differences in military rank not being so obvious at this time, for the officers made friends of their men, and in turn were worshipped by them.  My wife volunteered her services as Red Cross nurse, insisting upon being sent to the front, in order to be as near me as could be, but it developed later that no nurse was allowed to go farther than the large troop hospitals far in the rear of the actual operations. Upon my urgent appeal she desisted and remained in Vienna after I had left, nursing in the barracks, which are now used for hospital work.  In fact, almost every third or fourth house, both private and public, as well as schools, were given to the use of the government and converted into Red Cross stations.  The happy days in Leoben came to an abrupt end, my regiment receiving orders to start immediately for the front.  We proceeded to Graz, where we joined the other three battalions and were entrained for an unknown destination.  We traveled via Budapest to Galicia, and left the train at Strij, a very important railroad center south of Lemberg.  It must be understood that the only reports reaching us from the fighting line at that time were to the effect that the Russians had been driven back from our border, and that the Austrian armies actually stood on the enemy's soil.  Strij being hundreds of miles away from the Russian frontier, we could not but surmise that we were going to be stationed there some time for the purpose of training and maneuvering.  This belief was strengthened by the fact that our regiment belonged to the Landsturm, or second line of reserves, originally intended for home service.  We were, however, alarmed that very same night and marched out of Strij for a distance of about twenty miles, in conjunction with the entire Third Army Corps.  After a short pause for the purpose of eating and feeding the horses, we marched another twenty-two miles.  This first day's march constituted a very strong test of endurance in consequence of our comparative softness and lack of training, especially as, in addition to his heavy rifle, bayonet, ammunition, and spade, each soldier was burdened with a knapsack containing emergency provisions in the form of tinned meats, coffee extract, sugar, salt, rice, and biscuits, together with various tin cooking and eating utensils; furthermore a second pair of shoes, extra blouse, changes of underwear, etc.  On top of this heavy pack a winter overcoat and part of a tent were strapped, the entire weight of the equipment being in the neighborhood of fifty pounds.  The day wore on.  Signs of fatigue soon manifested themselves more and more strongly, and slowly the men dropped out one by one, from sheer exhaustion.  No murmur of complaint, however, would be heard.  Most of those who fell out of line, after taking a breathing space for a few minutes, staggered on again. The few that remained behind joined the regiment later on when camp was established.  We wondered then at the necessity of such a forced march, being unable to see a reason for it, unless it was to put us in training.  Night had fallen when we reached a small monastery in the midst of a forest, where the peaceful surroundings and the monastic life, entirely untouched by the war fever, seemed strange indeed.  Camp was established, tents erected, fires were lighted, and coffee made. Soon a life of bustling activity sprang up in the wilderness, in the midst of the forest which only a few hours before had been deserted.  It made a weird and impressive picture in the wonderful starlight night, these soldiers sitting around the camp fires softly singing in chorus; the fantastic outlines of the monastery half hidden in the woods; the dark figures of the monks moving silently back and forth amongst the shadows of the trees as they brought refreshments to the troops; the red glow of the camp fires illuminating the eager and enthusiastic faces of the young officers grouped around the colonel; the snorting and stamping of the horses nearby; an occasional melodic outcry of a sentinel out in the night; all these things merging into an unforgettable scene of great romanticism and beauty.  That night I lay for a long while stretched near the smoldering ashes of the camp fire, with my cape as a blanket, in a state of lassitude and somnolence, my soul filled with exaltation and happiness over the beauty around me.  The rest, however, was of very short duration, for at six o'clock in the morning we were aroused, camp was broken up and soon afterwards we started on a forced march of twenty-two miles without a halt, during which we twice had to wade knee-deep through rivers. By midday most of the men were so exhausted that they could hardly crawl along.  It was remarkable that the comparatively weaker and more refined city-bred people who had done little physical work in their lives, most of them being professional men, withstood hardships better than the sturdy and, to all appearances, stronger peasants; the only explanation for it being perhaps that the. city-bred people, in consequence of their better surroundings and by reason of their education, had more will power and nervous strength than the peasants.  At half-past two we reached a clearing in the midst of a wood through which a river flowed.  Here camp was again established and a half hour later all the hardships of the march were once more forgotten in the bustle of camp life.  This time we had a full rest until the next morning at four o'clock, when suddenly orders for marching were given.  After we had been under way for about three hours we heard far-away, repeated rumbling which sounded like distant thunder.  Not for a moment did we associate it with cannonading, being, as we supposed, hundreds of miles away from the nearest place where Russians could possibly be.  Suddenly a mounted ordnance officer came rushing with a message to our colonel.  We came to a halt and all officers were summoned to the colonel who, addressing us in his usual quiet, almost businesslike way, said: \"Gentlemen, accept my congratulations, I have good news for you, we may meet the enemy to-day and I sincerely hope to lead you to the fight before evening.\" We were thunderstruck at the sudden realization that the Russians had penetrated so deeply into Galicia. The despondency which followed this startling revelation, however, was quickly replaced by the intense excitement of meeting the enemy so soon.  We hurried back to our companies, imparting the news to the men, who broke forth into shouts of enthusiasm.  All the fatigue so plainly noticeable only a few minutes before, suddenly vanished as if by magic, and every one seemed alert, springy, and full of spirit.  We energetically resumed the march in the direction of the distant rumbling, which indicated that the artillery of our advance guard had engaged the enemy.  My regiment then was part of the main body of a division.  A second division advanced on the road parallel to ours, about a mile and a quarter to our left.  Both columns belonged to the Third Army Corps and kept up constant communication with each other through mounted dispatch bearers and motor cycles.  The cannonading had meanwhile come perceptibly nearer, and in the midst of the dense forest we again came to a short halt.  Orders were given to load rifles, and upon emerging from the woods we fell into open formation, the men marching abreast, the companies at a distance of three hundred yards, with the battalions at a distance of about a thousand yards.  We were slowly entering the range of the Russian artillery.  About a mile ahead we could see numbers of harmless looking round clouds, looking like ringlets of smoke from a huge cigar, indicating the places where shrapnel had exploded in mid-air.  Our men, not being familiar with the spectacle, took no notice of it, but we officers knew its significance, and I daresay many a heart beat as wildly as mine did.  We marched on until the command was given for us to deploy, and soon afterwards the first shrapnel whizzed over our heads.  It did no harm, nor did the second and third, but the fourth hit three men in the battalion in the rear of us.  Our forward movement, however, was not interrupted, and we did not see or hear anything beyond two or three startled cries.  The next shell burst right ahead of us, sending a shower of bullets and steel fragments around.  A man about twenty yards to the right of my company, but not of my platoon, leaped into the air with an agonizing cry and fell in a heap, mortally wounded.  As we were advancing very swiftly, I only saw it as in a dream, while running by.  Then came in rapid succession four or five terrific explosions right over our heads, and I felt a sudden gust of cold wind strike my cheek as a big shell fragment came howling through the air, ploughing the ground viciously as it struck and sending a spray of sand around.  We ran on perhaps a quarter of a mile, when from the rear came the sharp command, \"Down,\" and the next second we lay on the ground, panting and exhausted, my heart almost bursting with the exertion.  Simultaneously the whizzing of a motor above our heads could be heard and we knew why the enemy's shrapnel had so suddenly found us.  It was a Russian aeroplane which presumably had signaled our approach, together with the range, to the Russian gunners, and now was probably directing their fire and closely watching its effect, for a chain of hills was hiding us from the view of the enemy, who consequently had to fire indirectly.  The air craft hovered above our heads, but we were forbidden to fire at it, the extremely difficult, almost vertical aim promising little success, aside from the danger of our bullets falling back among us.  Our reserves in the rear had apparently sighted the air craft too, for soon we heard a volley "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10967"],["title","Four Weeks in the Trenches: The War Story of a Violinist (#2)"],["body","rifle fire from that direction and simultaneously the aeroplane arose and disappeared in the clouds.  Just then our own artillery came thundering up, occupied a little hill in the rear and opened fire on the enemy.  The moral effect of the thundering of one's own artillery is most extraordinary, and many of us thought that we had never heard any more welcome sound than the deep roaring and crashing that started in at our rear.  It quickly helped to disperse the nervousness caused by the first entering into battle and to restore self control and confidence.  Besides, by getting into action, our artillery was now focusing the attention and drawing the fire of the Russian guns, for most of the latter's shells whined harmlessly above us, being aimed at the batteries in our rear.  Considerably relieved by this diversion, we resumed our forward movement after about fifteen minutes of further rest, our goal being the little chain of hills which our advance guard had previously occupied pending our arrival.  Here we were ordered to take up positions and dig trenches, any further advance being out of the question, as the Russian artillery overlooked and commanded the entire plain stretching in front of us.  We started at once to dig our trenches, half of my platoon stepping forward abreast, the men being placed an arm's length apart.  After laying their rifles down, barrels pointing to the enemy, a line was drawn behind the row of rifles and parallel to it.  Then each man would dig up the ground, starting from his part of the line backwards, throwing forward the earth removed, until it formed a sort of breastwork.  The second half of the platoon was meanwhile resting in the rear, rifle in hand and ready for action.  After a half hour they took the place of the first division at work, and vice versa.  Within an hour work on the trenches was so far advanced that they could be deepened while standing in them.  Such an open trench affords sufficient shelter against rifle bullets striking from the front and can be made in a measure shell proof by being covered with boards, if at hand, and with sod.  In the western area of the theater of war, in France and Flanders, where whole armies were deadlocked, facing each other for weeks without shifting their position an inch, such trenches become an elaborate affair, with extensive underground working and wing connections of lines which almost constitute little fortresses and afford a certain measure of comfort.  But where we were in Galicia at the beginning of the war, with conditions utterly unsteady and positions shifting daily and hourly, only the most superficial trenches were used.  In fact, we thought ourselves fortunate if we could requisition enough straw to cover the bottom.  That afternoon we had about half finished our work when our friend the aeroplane appeared on the horizon again.  This time we immediately opened fire.  It disappeared, but apparently had seen enough, for very soon our position was shelled.  By this time, however, shrapnel had almost ceased to be a source of concern to us and we scarcely paid any attention to it.  Human nerves quickly get accustomed to the most unusual conditions and circumstances and I noticed that quite a number of men actually fell asleep from sheer exhaustion in the trenches, in spite of the roaring of the cannon about us and the whizzing of shrapnel over our heads.  I, too, soon got accustomed to the deadly missiles,--in fact, I had already started to make observations of their peculiarities.  My ear, accustomed to differentiate sounds of all kinds, had some time ago, while we still advanced, noted a remarkable discrepancy in the peculiar whine produced by the different shells in their rapid flight through the air as they passed over our heads, some sounding shrill, with a rising tendency, and the others rather dull, with a falling cadence.  A short observation revealed the fact that the passing of a dull-sounding shell was invariably preceded by a flash from one of our own cannon in the rear on the hill, which conclusively proved it to be an Austrian shell.  It must be understood that as we were advancing between the positions of the Austrian and Russian artillery, both kinds of shells were passing over our heads.  As we advanced the difference between shrill and dull shell grew less and less perceptible, until I could hardly tell them apart.  Upon nearing the hill the difference increased again more and more until on the hill itself it was very marked.  After our trench was finished I crawled to the top of the hill until I could make out the flash of the Russian guns on the opposite heights and by timing flash and actual passing of the shell, found to my astonishment that now the Russian missiles had become dull, while on the other hand, the shrill shell was invariably heralded by a flash from one of our guns, now far in the rear.  What had happened was this: Every shell describes in its course a parabolic line, with the first half of the curve ascending and the second one descending.  Apparently in the first half of its curve, that is, its course while ascending, the shell produced a dull whine accompanied by a falling cadence, which changes to a rising shrill as soon as the acme has been reached and the curve points downward again.  The acme for both kinds of shells naturally was exactly the half distance between the Russian and Austrian artillery and this was the point where I had noticed that the difference was the least marked.  A few days later, in talking over my observation with an artillery officer, I was told the fact was known that the shells sounded different going up than when coming down, but this knowledge was not used for practical purposes.  When I told him that I could actually determine by the sound the exact place where a shell coming from the opposing batteries was reaching its acme, he thought that this would be of great value in a case where the position of the opposing battery was hidden and thus could be located.  He apparently spoke to his commander about me, for a few days later I was sent on a reconnoitering tour, with the object of marking on the map the exact spot where I thought the hostile shells were reaching their acme, and it was later on reported to me that I had succeeded in giving to our batteries the almost exact range of the Russian guns.  I have gone into this matter at some length, because it is the only instance where my musical ear was of value during my service.  To return to my narrative, the losses which my battalion suffered that day seemed extraordinarily small when compared with the accuracy of the Russian artillery's aim and the number of missiles they fired.  I counted seventy-four shrapnel that burst in a circle of half a mile around us in about two hours, and yet we had no more than about eighteen casualties.  The most difficult part was to lie still and motionless while death was being dealt all about us and it was then and there that I had my first experience of seeing death next to me.  A soldier of my platoon, while digging in the trench, suddenly leaned back, began to cough like an old man, a little blood broke from his lips, and he crumpled together in a heap and lay quite still. I could not realize that this was the end, for his eyes were wide open and his face wore the stamp of complete serenity.  Apparently he had not suffered at all.  The man had been a favorite with all his fellows by reason of his good humor, and that he was now stretched out dead seemed unbelievable.  I saw a great many men die afterwards, some suffering horribly, but I do not recall any death that affected me quite so much as that of this first victim in my platoon.    II    The artillery duel died out with the coming of darkness and we settled down to rest, half of the men taking watch while the others slept.  At five o'clock in the morning our regiment suddenly received the order to fall in, and, together with two other regiments, was drawn out of the fighting line.  Our commanding general had received news that an isolated detachment on the extreme right wing of our army, about fifteen miles east of us, had been entirely surrounded by a strong Russian body, and we were ordered to relieve them.  It must not be forgotten that our men had been under a most incredible strain for the last three days with barely any rest during the nights and not more than one meal a day.  They had actually welcomed entering the firing line, as a relief from the fatigues of marching with their heavy burdens.  It is curious how indifferent one becomes to danger if one's organism is worn down and brain and faculty of perception numbed by physical exertion.  It was, therefore, with badly broken-down strength that we started on this relief expedition, and it was good to see how unflinchingly the soldiers undertook their unexpected new task.  All we had to say to our men was: \"Boys, your brothers are needing you.  They are cut off from all possible relief unless you bring it.  Their lives are at stake, and as they are defending one of the most strategically important points--the right wing of our army--you can turn the tide of the whole battle in our favor; so go on.\" And on they went, staggering and stumbling, and at the end of a few hours almost crawling, but ever forward.  Suddenly we came up with another regiment which had been called to the same task, and the colonel of the new regiment, being older in rank than our colonel, took command of the newly formed brigade of two regiments.  My company happened to march at the head of the regiment and the new brigadier rode for some time alongside of me.  I was deeply impressed by his firm military and yet unassuming bearing and his deep glowing enthusiasm for his army and his men. He told me with pride that two of his sons were serving in the army, too, one as an artillery officer and the other one as an officer with the sappers.  We were then approaching the point"]]]
