She was, however, of no undistinguished origin. Her father, the son of a professor at the University of Leipzig, had entered the Prussian Civil Service; there he had risen to the highest rank and had been Cabinet Secretary to both Frederick William II. and Frederick III. He was a man of high character and of considerable ability; as was not uncommon among the officials of those days, he was strongly affected by the liberal and even revolutionary doctrines of France.  Fräulein Mencken, who was married at the age of sixteen, was a clever and ambitious woman. From her her son inherited his intellect; from his father he derived what the Germans call _Gemüth_, geniality, kindliness, humour. By his two parents he was thus connected with the double foundation on which Prussia had been built: on his father's side he had sprung from the fighting nobles; on his mother's, from the scholars and officials. In later life we shall find that while his prejudices and affections are all enlisted on the side of the noble, the keen and critical intellect he had inherited from his mother enabled him to overcome the prejudices of his order.  The early life of the young pair was not altogether fortunate. Several children died at a very early age; the defeat of Prussia brought foreign occupation; Schoenhausen was seized by French troopers; the marks of their swords are still to be seen in a beam over one of the doors, and Rittmeister v. Bismarck had to take his wife away into the woods in order to escape their violence.  Of all the children of the marriage only three lived: Bernhard, who was born in 1810, Otto, and one sister, Malvina, born in 1827.  Otto did not live at Schoenhausen long; when he was only a year old, his father moved to Pomerania and settled on the estates Kniephof and Kulz, which had come into the family on his grandfather's marriage. Pomerania was at that time a favourite residence among the Prussian nobility; the country was better wooded than the Mark, and game more plentiful; the rich meadows, the wide heaths and forests were more attractive than the heavy corn-lands and the sandy wastes of the older province. Here, in the deep seclusion of country life, the boy passed his first years; it was far removed from the bustle and turmoil of civilisation. Naugard, the nearest town, was five miles distant; communication was bad, for it was not till after 1815 that the Prussian Government began to construct highroads. In this distant province, life went on as in the olden days, little altered by the changes which had transformed the State. The greater portion of the land belonged to large proprietors; the noble as in old days was still all-powerful on his own estate; in his hands was the administration of the law, and it was at his manorial court that men had to seek for justice, a court where justice was dealt not in the name of the King but of the Lord of the Manor. He lived among his people and generally he farmed his own lands. There was little of the luxury of an English country-house or the refinement of the French noblesse; he would be up at daybreak to superintend the work in the fields, his wife and daughters that of the household, talking to the peasants the pleasant _Platt Deutsch_ of the countryside. Then there would be long rides or drives to the neighbours' houses; shooting, for there was plenty of deer and hares; and occasionally in the winter a visit to Berlin; farther away, few of them went. Most of the country gentlemen had been to Paris, but only as conquerors at the end of the great war.  They were little disturbed by modern political theories, but were contented, as in old days, to be governed by the King. It was a religious society; among the peasants and the nobles, if not among the clergy, there still lingered something of the simple but profound faith of German Protestantism; they were scarcely touched by the rationalism of the eighteenth or by the liberalism of the nineteenth century; there was little pomp and ceremony of worship in the village church, but the natural periods of human life--birth, marriage, death--called for the blessing of the Church, and once or twice a year came the solemn confession and the sacrament. Religious belief and political faith were closely joined, for the Church was but a department of the State; the King was chief bishop, as he was general of the army, and the sanctity of the Church was transferred to the Crown; to the nobles and peasants, criticism of, or opposition to, the King had in it something of sacrilege; the words \"by the Grace of God\" added to the royal title were more than an empty phrase. Society was still organised on the old patriarchal basis: at the bottom was the peasant; above him was the _gnädiger Herr_; above him, _Unser allergnädigste Herr_, the King, who lived in Berlin; and above him, the _Herr Gott_ in Heaven.  To the inhabitants of South Germany, and the men of the towns, these nobles of Further Pomerania, the _Junker_ as they were called, with their feudal life, their medieval beliefs, their simple monarchism, were the incarnation of political folly; to them liberalism seemed another form of atheism, but in this solitude and fresh air of the great plain was reared a race of men who would always be ready, as their fathers had been, to draw their sword and go out to conquer new provinces for their King to govern.     CHAPTER II.  EARLY LIFE.  1821-1847.   Of the boy's early life we know little. His mother was ambitious for her sons; Otto from his early years she designed for the Diplomatic Service; she seems to have been one of those women who was willing to sacrifice the present happiness of her children for their future advancement. When only six years old the boy was sent away from home to a school in Berlin. He was not happy there; he pined for the free life of the country, the fields and woods and animals; when he saw a plough he would burst into tears, for it reminded him of his home. The discipline of the school was hard, not with the healthy and natural hardships of life in the open air, but with an artificial Spartanism, for it was the time when the Germans, who had suddenly awoke to feelings of patriotism and a love of war to which they had long been strangers, under the influence of a few writers, were throwing all their energies into the cultivation of physical endurance. It was probably at this time that there was laid the foundation of that dislike for the city of Berlin which Bismarck never quite overcame; and from his earliest years he was prejudiced against the exaggerated and affected Teutonism which was the fashion after the great war. A few years later his parents came to live altogether in the town; then the boy passed on to the Gymnasium, boarding in the house of one of the masters. The teaching in this school was supplemented by private tutors, and he learned at this time the facility in the use of the English and French languages which in after years was to be of great service to him. The education at school was of course chiefly in the classical languages; he acquired a sufficient mastery of Latin. There is no evidence that in later life he continued the study of classical literature. In his seventeenth year he passed the Abiturienten examination, which admitted him as a student to the university and entitled him to the privilege of serving in the army for one instead of three years. His leaving certificate tells us that his conduct and demeanour towards his comrades and teachers were admirable, his abilities considerable, and his diligence fair.  The next year he passed in the ordinary course to the university, entering at Göttingen; the choice was probably made because of the celebrity which that university had acquired in law and history. It is said that he desired to enter at Heidelberg, but his mother refused her permission, because she feared that he would learn those habits of beer-drinking in which the students of that ancient seat of learning have gained so great a proficiency; it was, however, an art which, as he found, was to be acquired with equal ease at Göttingen. The young Bismarck was at this time over six feet high, slim and well built, of great physical strength and agility, a good fencer, a bold rider, an admirable swimmer and runner, a very agreeable companion; frank, cheerful, and open-hearted, without fear either of his comrades or of his teachers. He devoted his time at Göttingen less to learning than to social life; in his second term he entered the Corps of the Hanoverians and was quickly noted for his power of drinking and fighting; he is reported to have fought twenty-six duels and was only wounded once, and that wound was caused by the breaking of his opponent's foil. He was full of wild escapades, for which he was often subjected to the ordinary punishments of the university.  To many Germans, their years at the university have been the turning-point of their life; but it was not so with Bismarck. To those who have been brought up in the narrow surroundings of civic life, student days form the single breath of freedom between the discipline of a school and the drudgery of an office. To a man who, like Bismarck, was accustomed to the truer freedom of the country, it was only a passing phase; as we shall see, it was not easy to tie him down to the drudgery of an office. He did not even form many friendships which he continued in later years; his associates in his corps must have been chiefly young Hanoverians; few of his comrades in Prussia were to be found at Göttingen; his knowledge of English enabled him to make the acquaintance of the Americans and English with whom Göttingen has always been a favourite university; among his fellow-students almost the only one"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12418"],["title","The Land of Deepening Shadow: Germany-at-War (#1)"],["body","relatives in a small Rhenish town.  Thus my first evening in Germany found me in a dark little town on the Rhine groping my way through crooked streets to a home, the threshold of which I no sooner crossed than I was made to feel that the arm of the police is long and that it stretches out into the remotest villages and hamlets.  The following incident, which was exactly typical of what would happen in nineteen German households out of twenty, may reveal one small aspect of German character to British and American people, who are as a rule completely unable to understand German psychology.  Although I had come far out of my way to bring what was for them a considerable sum of money, as well as some portraits of their long-absent relatives in the United States and interesting family news, my reception was as cold as the snow-blown air outside.  I was not allowed to finish explaining my business when I was at first petulantly and then violently and angrily interrupted with:--  \"Have you been to the police?\"  \"No,\" I said.  \"I did not think it was necessary to go to the police, as I am merely passing through here, and am not going to stay.\"  The lady of the house replied coldly, \"Go to the police,\" and shut the door in my face.  I mastered my temper by reminding myself that whereas such treatment at home would have been sufficiently insulting to break off further relations, it was not intended as such in Germany.  It was a long walk for a tired man to the _Polizeiamt_.  When I got there I was fortunate in encountering a lank, easy-going old fellow who had been commandeered for the job owing to the departure of all the local police for the war.  He was clearly more interested in trying to find out something of _his_ relations in some remote village in America, which he said was named after them, than in my business.  I returned to pay the 100 pounds and deliver the photographs, and now that I had been officially \"policed\" was received with great cordiality and pressed to spend the evening.  Father, mother, grown-up daughters and brother-in-law all assured me that it was not owing to my personal appearance that I had been so coldly received, but that war is war and law is law and that everything must be done as the authorities decree.  Cigars and cigarettes were showered upon me and my glass was never allowed to be empty of Rhine wine.  Good food was set before me and the stock generously replenished whenever necessary.  It will be remembered that I had come unexpectedly and that I was not being entertained in a wealthy home, and this at a time when the only counter-attack on Germany's success in the Balkans was an increased amount of stories that she was starving.  Evidently the Schultzs and the Schmidts were not taking all the credit for Germany's position to themselves.  They pointed with pride to a picture of the Emperor adorning one wall and then smiled with satisfaction as they indicated the portrait of von Hindenburg on the wall opposite.  One of the daughters wore a huge silver medallion of the same renowned general on her neck.  After nearly a year and a half of war these bard-working Germans were proud of their leaders and had absolute faith in them.  But this family had felt the war.  One son had just been wounded, they knew not how severely, in France.  If some unknown English, soldier on the Yser had raised his rifle just a hairbreadth higher the other son would be sleeping in the blood-soaked soil of Flanders instead of doing garrison duty in Hanover while recovering from a bullet which had passed through his head just under the eyes.     CHAPTER II  WHEN SKIES WERE BLUE  There was one more passenger, making three, in our first-class compartment in the all-day express train from Cologne to Berlin after it left Hanover.  He was a naval officer of about forty-five, clean-cut, alert, clearly an intelligent man.  His manner was proud, but not objectionably so.  The same might be said of the manner of the major who had sat opposite me since the train left Dusseldorf.  I had been in Germany less than thirty hours and was feeling my way carefully, so I made no attempt to enter into conversation.  Just before lunch the jolting of the train deposited the major's coat at my feet.  I picked it up and handed it to him.  He received it with thanks and a trace of a smile.  He was polite, but icily so.  I was an American, he was a German officer.  In his way of reasoning my country was unneutrally making ammunition to kill himself and his men.  But for my country the war would have been over long ago. Therefore he hated me, but his training made him polite in his hate.  That is the difference between the better class of army and naval officers and diplomats and the rest of the Germans.  When he left the compartment for the dining-car he saluted and bowed stiffly.  When we met in the narrow corridor after our return from lunch, each stepped aside to let the other pass in first.  I exchanged with him heel-click for heel-click, salute for salute, waist-bow for waist-bow, and after-you-my-dear-Alphonse sweep of the arm for you-go-first-my-dear-Gaston motion from him.  The result was that we both started at once, collided, backed away and indulged in all the protestations and gymnastics necessary to beg another's pardon, in military Germany.  At length we entered, erected a screen of ice between us, and alternately looked from one another to the scenery hour after hour.  The entrance of the naval officer relieved the strain, for the two branches of the Kaisers armed might were soon--after the usual gymnastics--engaged in conversation.  They were not men to discuss their business before a stranger.  Once I caught the word Amerikaner uttered in a low voice, but though their looks told that they regarded me as an intruder in their country they said nothing on that point.  At Stendal we got the Berlin evening papers, which had little of interest except a few lines about the _Ancona_ affair between Washington and Vienna.  \"Do you think Austria will grant the American demands?\" the man in grey asked the man in blue.  \"Austria will do what Germany thinks best.  Personally, I hope that we take a firm stand.  I do not believe in letting the United States tell us how to conduct the war.  We are quite capable of conducting it and completing it in a manner satisfactory to ourselves.\"  The man in grey agreed with the man in blue.  Past the blazing munition works at Spandau, across the Havel, through the Tiergarten, running slowly now, to the _Friedrichstrasse Bahnhof_.  A bewildering swirl of thoughts rushed through my head as I stepped out on the platform.  More than three months ago I had left London for my long, circuitous journey to Berlin.  I had planned and feared, planned and hoped.  The German spy system is the most elaborate in the world.  Only through a miracle could the Wilhelmstrasse be ignorant of the fact that I had travelled all over Europe during the war for the hated British Press.  I could only hope that the age of miracles had not passed.  The crowd was great, porters were as scarce as they used to be plentiful, I was waiting for somebody, so I stood still and took note of my surroundings.  Across the platform was a long train ready to start west, and from each window leaned officers and soldiers bidding good-bye to groups of friends.  The train was marked _Hannover_, _Koln_, _Lille_.  As though I had never known it before, I found myself saying, \"Lille is in France, and those men ride there straight from here.\"  The train on which I had arrived had pulled out and another had taken its place.  This was marked _Posen_, _Thorn_, _Insterburg_, _Stalluponen_, _Alexandrovo_, _Vilna_.  As I stood on that platform I felt Germany's power in a peculiar but convincing way.  I had been in Germany, in East Prussia, when the Russians were not only in possession of the last four places named, but about to threaten the first two.  Now the simple printed list of stations on the heavy train about to start from the capital of Germany to Vilna, deep in Russia, was an awe-inspiring tribute to the great military machine of the Fatherland.  For a moment I believed in von Bethmann-Holweg's talk about the \"map of Europe.\"  I was eager to see how much Berlin had changed, for I knew it at various stages of the war, but I cannot honestly say that the changes which I detected later, and which I shall deal with in subsequent chapters of this book--changes which are absorbingly interesting to study on the spot and vitally important in the progress and outcome of the war--were very apparent then.  In the dying days of 1915 I found the people of Berlin almost as supremely confident of victory, especially now since Bulgaria's entrance had made such sweeping changes in the Balkans, as they were on that day of cloudless blue, the first of August, 1914, when the dense mass swayed before the Royal Palace, to see William II come out upon the balcony to bid his people rise to arms.  Eyes sparkled, cheeks flushed, the buzz changed to cheering, the cheering swelled to a roar.  The army which had been brought to the highest perfection, the army which would sweep Europe--at last the German people could see what it would do, would show the world what it would do.  The anticipation intoxicated them.  An American friend told me of how he struggled toward the _Schloss_, but in the jam of humanity got only as far as the monument of Frederick the Great.  There a youth threw his hat in the air and cried: \"_Hock der Krieg, Hock der Krieg_!\" (Hurrah for the war).  That was the spirit that raged like a prairie fire.  An old man next to him looked him full in the eyes.  \"_Der Krieg ist eine ernste Sache, Junge_!\" (War is a serious matter, young man), he said and turned away.  He was in the crowd, but not of it. His note was discordant.  They snarled at him and pushed him roughly.  They gloried in the thought of war.  They were certain that they were invincible.  "]]]
