I am a blind man--I haven't seen my servant for twelve years--what idea can you give me of him? I asked you to notice.\"  \"I know you did, but your Parkinson is the sort of man who has very little about him to describe. He is the embodiment of the ordinary. His height is about average----\"  \"Five feet nine,\" murmured Carrados. \"Slightly above the mean.\"  \"Scarcely noticeably so. Clean-shaven. Medium brown hair. No particularly marked features. Dark eyes. Good teeth.\"  \"False,\" interposed Carrados. \"The teeth--not the statement.\"  \"Possibly,\" admitted Mr. Carlyle. \"I am not a dental expert and I had no opportunity of examining Mr. Parkinson's mouth in detail. But what is the drift of all this?\"  \"His clothes?\"  \"Oh, just the ordinary evening dress of a valet. There is not much room for variety in that.\"  \"You noticed, in fact, nothing special by which Parkinson could be identified?\"  \"Well, he wore an unusually broad gold ring on the little finger of the left hand.\"  \"But that is removable. And yet Parkinson has an ineradicable mole--a small one, I admit--on his chin. And you a human sleuth-hound. Oh, Louis!\"  \"At all events,\" retorted Carlyle, writhing a little under this good-humoured satire, although it was easy enough to see in it Carrados's affectionate intention--\"at all events, I dare say I can give as good a description of Parkinson as he can give of me.\"  \"That is what we are going to test. Ring the bell again.\"  \"Seriously?\"  \"Quite. I am trying my eyes against yours. If I can't give you fifty out of a hundred I'll renounce my private detectorial ambition for ever.\"  \"It isn't quite the same,\" objected Carlyle, but he rang the bell.  \"Come in and close the door, Parkinson,\" said Carrados when the man appeared. \"Don't look at Mr. Carlyle again--in fact, you had better stand with your back towards him, he won't mind. Now describe to me his appearance as you observed it.\"  Parkinson tendered his respectful apologies to Mr. Carlyle for the liberty he was compelled to take, by the deferential quality of his voice.  \"Mr. Carlyle, sir, wears patent leather boots of about size seven and very little used. There are five buttons, but on the left boot one button--the third up--is missing, leaving loose threads and not the more usual metal fastener. Mr. Carlyle's trousers, sir, are of a dark material, a dark grey line of about a quarter of an inch width on a darker ground. The bottoms are turned permanently up and are, just now, a little muddy, if I may say so.\"  \"Very muddy,\" interposed Mr. Carlyle generously. \"It is a wet night, Parkinson.\"  \"Yes, sir; very unpleasant weather. If you will allow me, sir, I will brush you in the hall. The mud is dry now, I notice. Then, sir,\" continued Parkinson, reverting to the business in hand, \"there are dark green cashmere hose. A curb-pattern key-chain passes into the left-hand trouser pocket.\"  From the visitor's nether garments the photographic-eyed Parkinson proceeded to higher ground, and with increasing wonder Mr. Carlyle listened to the faithful catalogue of his possessions. His fetter-and-link albert of gold and platinum was minutely described. His spotted blue ascot, with its gentlemanly pearl scarfpin, was set forth, and the fact that the buttonhole in the left lapel of his morning coat showed signs of use was duly noted. What Parkinson saw he recorded, but he made no deductions. A handkerchief carried in the cuff of the right sleeve was simply that to him and not an indication that Mr. Carlyle was, indeed, left-handed.  But a more delicate part of Parkinson's undertaking remained. He approached it with a double cough.  \"As regards Mr. Carlyle's personal appearance, sir--\"  \"No, enough!\" cried the gentleman concerned hastily. \"I am more than satisfied. You are a keen observer, Parkinson.\"  \"I have trained myself to suit my master's requirements, sir,\" replied the man. He looked towards Mr. Carrados, received a nod and withdrew.  Mr. Carlyle was the first to speak.  \"That man of yours would be worth five pounds a week to me, Max,\" he remarked thoughtfully. \"But, of course--\"  \"I don't think that he would take it,\" replied Carrados, in a voice of equally detached speculation. \"He suits me very well. But you have the chance of using his services--indirectly.\"  \"You still mean that--seriously?\"  \"I notice in you a chronic disinclination to take me seriously, Louis. It is really--to an Englishman--almost painful. Is there something inherently comic about me or the atmosphere of The Turrets?\"  \"No, my friend,\" replied Mr. Carlyle, \"but there is something essentially prosperous. That is what points to the improbable. Now what is it?\"  \"It might be merely a whim, but it is more than that,\" replied Carrados. \"It is, well, partly vanity, partly _ennui_, partly\"--certainly there was something more nearly tragic in his voice than comic now--\"partly hope.\"  Mr. Carlyle was too tactful to pursue the subject.  \"Those are three tolerable motives,\" he acquiesced. \"I'll do anything you want, Max, on one condition.\"  \"Agreed. And it is?\"  \"That you tell me how you knew so much of this affair.\" He tapped the silver coin which lay on the table near them. \"I am not easily flabbergasted,\" he added.  \"You won't believe that there is nothing to explain--that it was purely second-sight?\"  \"No,\" replied Carlyle tersely: \"I won't.\"  \"You are quite right. And yet the thing is very simple.\"  \"They always are--when you know,\" soliloquised the other. \"That's what makes them so confoundedly difficult when you don't.\"  \"Here is this one then. In Padua, which seems to be regaining its old reputation as the birthplace of spurious antiques, by the way, there lives an ingenious craftsman named Pietro Stelli. This simple soul, who possesses a talent not inferior to that of Cavino at his best, has for many years turned his hand to the not unprofitable occupation of forging rare Greek and Roman coins. As a collector and student of certain Greek colonials and a specialist in forgeries I have been familiar with Stelli's workmanship for years. Latterly he seems to have come under the influence of an international crook called--at the moment--Dompierre, who soon saw a way of utilizing Stelli's genius on a royal scale. Helene Brunesi, who in private life is--and really is, I believe--Madame Dompierre, readily lent her services to the enterprise.\"  \"Quite so,\" nodded Mr. Carlyle, as his host paused.  \"You see the whole sequence, of course?\"  \"Not exactly--not in detail,\" confessed Mr. Carlyle.  \"Dompierre's idea was to gain access to some of the most celebrated cabinets of Europe and substitute Stelli's fabrications for the genuine coins. The princely collection of rarities that he would thus amass might be difficult to dispose of safely, but I have no doubt that he had matured his plans. Helene, in the person of Nina Brun, an Anglicised French parlourmaid--a part which she fills to perfection--was to obtain wax impressions of the most valuable pieces and to make the exchange when the counterfeits reached her. In this way it was obviously hoped that the fraud would not come to light until long after the real coins had been sold, and I gather that she has already done her work successfully in general houses. Then, impressed by her excellent references and capable manner, my housekeeper engaged her, and for a few weeks she went about her duties here. It was fatal to this detail of the scheme, however, that I have the misfortune to be blind. I am told that Helene has so innocently angelic a face as to disarm suspicion, but I was incapable of being impressed and that good material was thrown away. But one morning my material fingers--which, of course, knew nothing of Helene's angelic face--discovered an unfamiliar touch about the surface of my favourite Euclideas, and, although there was doubtless nothing to be seen, my critical sense of smell reported that wax had been recently pressed against it. I began to make discreet inquiries and in the meantime my cabinets went to the local bank for safety. Helene countered by receiving a telegram from Angiers, calling her to the death-bed of her aged mother. The aged mother succumbed; duty compelled Helene to remain at the side of her stricken patriarchal father, and doubtless The Turrets was written off the syndicate's operations as a bad debt.\"  \"Very interesting,\" admitted Mr. Carlyle; \"but at the risk of seeming obtuse\"--his manner had become delicately chastened--\"I must say that I fail to trace the inevitable connexion between Nina Brun and this particular forgery--assuming that it is a forgery.\"  \"Set your mind at rest about that, Louis,\" replied Carrados. \"It is a forgery, and it is a forgery that none but Pietro Stelli could have achieved. That is the essential connexion. Of course, there are accessories. A private detective coming urgently to see me with a notable tetradrachm in his pocket, which he announces to be the clue to a remarkable fraud--well, really, Louis, one scarcely needs to be blind to see through that.\"  \"And Lord Seastoke? I suppose you happened to discover that Nina Brun had gone there?\"  \"No, I cannot claim to have discovered that, or I should certainly have warned him at once when I found out--only recently--about the gang. As a matter of fact, the last information I had of Lord Seastoke was a line in yesterday's _Morning Post_ to the effect that he was still at Cairo. But many of these pieces--\" He brushed his finger almost lovingly across the vivid chariot race that embellished the reverse of the coin, and broke off to remark: \"You really ought to take up the subject, Louis. You have no idea how useful it might prove to you some day.\"  \"I really think I must,\" replied Carlyle grimly. \"Two hundred and fifty pounds the original of this cost, I believe.\"  \"Cheap, too; it would make five hundred pounds in New York to-day.

I had no space for entering into any polemic, but it will be found that my interpretations of the systems are different in some cases from those offered by some European scholars who have worked on them and I leave it to those who are acquainted with the literature of the subject to decide which of us may be in the right. I have not dealt elaborately with the new school of Logic (Navya-Nyâya) of Bengal, for the simple reason that most of the contributions of this school consist in the invention of technical expressions and the emphasis put on the necessity of strict exactitude and absolute preciseness of logical definitions and discussions and these are almost untranslatable in intelligible English. I have however incorporated what important differences of philosophical points of view I could find in it. Discussions of a purely technical character could not be very fruitful in a work like this. The bibliography given of the different Indian systems in the last six chapters is not exhaustive but consists mostly of books which have been actually studied or consulted in the writing of those chapters. Exact references to the pages of the  xi  texts have generally been given in footnotes in those cases where a difference of interpretation was anticipated or where it was felt that a reference to the text would make the matter clearer, or where the opinions of modern writers have been incorporated.  It gives me the greatest pleasure to acknowledge my deepest gratefulness to the Hon'ble Maharaja Sir Manindrachandra Nundy, K.C.I.E. Kashimbazar, Bengal, who has kindly promised to bear the entire expense of the publication of both volumes of the present work.  The name of this noble man is almost a household word in Bengal for the magnanimous gifts that he has made to educational and other causes. Up till now he has made a total gift of about £300,000, of which those devoted to education come to about £200,000. But the man himself is far above the gifts he has made. His sterling character, universal sympathy and friendship, his kindness and amiability make him a veritable Bodhisattva--one of the noblest of men that I have ever seen. Like many other scholars of Bengal, I am deeply indebted to him for the encouragement that he has given me in the pursuit of my studies and researches, and my feelings of attachment and gratefulness for him are too deep for utterance.  I am much indebted to my esteemed friends Dr E.J. Thomas of the Cambridge University Library and Mr Douglas Ainslie for their kindly revising the proofs of this work, in the course of which they improved my English in many places. To the former I am also indebted for his attention to the transliteration of a large number of Sanskrit words, and also for the whole-hearted sympathy and great friendliness with which he assisted me with his advice on many points of detail, in particular the exposition of the Buddhist doctrine of the cause of rebirth owes something of its treatment to repeated discussions with him.  I also wish to express my gratefulness to my friend Mr N.K. Siddhanta, M.A., late of the Scottish Churches College, and Mademoiselle Paule Povie for the kind assistance they have rendered in preparing the index. My obligations are also due to the Syndics of the Cambridge University Press for the honour they have done me in publishing this work.  To scholars of Indian philosophy who may do me the honour of reading my book and who may be impressed with its inevitable  xii  shortcomings and defects, I can only pray in the words of Hemacandra:    Pramâ@nasiddhântaviruddham atra   Yatkiñciduktam matimândyado@sât   Mâtsaryyam utsâryya tadâryyacittâ@h   Prasâdam âdhâya vis'odhayantu.
