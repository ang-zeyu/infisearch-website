The sun, as common, went abroad, The flowers, accustomed, blew, As if no soul the solstice passed That maketh all things new.  The time was scarce profaned by speech; The symbol of a word Was needless, as at sacrament The wardrobe of our Lord.  Each was to each the sealed church, Permitted to commune this time, Lest we too awkward show At supper of the Lamb.  The hours slid fast, as hours will, Clutched tight by greedy hands; So faces on two decks look back, Bound to opposing lands.  And so, when all the time had failed, Without external sound, Each bound the other's crucifix, We gave no other bond.  Sufficient troth that we shall rise -- Deposed, at length, the grave -- To that new marriage, justified Through Calvaries of Love!      XIV.  LOVE'S BAPTISM.  I'm ceded, I've stopped being theirs; The name they dropped upon my face With water, in the country church, Is finished using now, And they can put it with my dolls, My childhood, and the string of spools I've finished threading too.  Baptized before without the choice, But this time consciously, of grace Unto supremest name, Called to my full, the crescent dropped, Existence's whole arc filled up With one small diadem.  My second rank, too small the first, Crowned, crowing on my father's breast, A half unconscious queen; But this time, adequate, erect, With will to choose or to reject. And I choose -- just a throne.      XV.  RESURRECTION.  'T was a long parting, but the time For interview had come; Before the judgment-seat of God, The last and second time  These fleshless lovers met, A heaven in a gaze, A heaven of heavens, the privilege Of one another's eyes.  No lifetime set on them, Apparelled as the new Unborn, except they had beheld, Born everlasting now.  Was bridal e'er like this? A paradise, the host, And cherubim and seraphim The most familiar guest.      XVI.  APOCALYPSE.  I'm wife; I've finished that, That other state; I'm Czar, I'm woman now: It's safer so.  How odd the girl's life looks Behind this soft eclipse! I think that earth seems so To those in heaven now.  This being comfort, then That other kind was pain; But why compare? I'm wife! stop there!      XVII.  THE WIFE.  She rose to his requirement, dropped The playthings of her life To take the honorable work Of woman and of wife.  If aught she missed in her new day Of amplitude, or awe, Or first prospective, or the gold In using wore away,  It lay unmentioned, as the sea Develops pearl and weed, But only to himself is known The fathoms they abide.      XVIII.  APOTHEOSIS.  Come slowly, Eden! Lips unused to thee, Bashful, sip thy jasmines, As the fainting bee,  Reaching late his flower, Round her chamber hums, Counts his nectars -- enters, And is lost in balms!            III. NATURE.  I.  New feet within my garden go, New fingers stir the sod; A troubadour upon the elm Betrays the solitude.  New children play upon the green, New weary sleep below; And still the pensive spring returns, And still the punctual snow!      II.  MAY-FLOWER.  Pink, small, and punctual, Aromatic, low, Covert in April, Candid in May,  Dear to the moss, Known by the knoll, Next to the robin In every human soul.  Bold little beauty, Bedecked with thee, Nature forswears Antiquity.      III.  WHY?  The murmur of a bee A witchcraft yieldeth me. If any ask me why, 'T were easier to die Than tell.  The red upon the hill Taketh away my will; If anybody sneer, Take care, for God is here, That's all.  The breaking of the day Addeth to my degree; If any ask me how, Artist, who drew me so, Must tell!      IV.  Perhaps you'd like to buy a flower? But I could never sell. If you would like to borrow Until the daffodil  Unties her yellow bonnet Beneath the village door, Until the bees, from clover rows Their hock and sherry draw,  Why, I will lend until just then, But not an hour more!      V.  The pedigree of honey Does not concern the bee; A clover, any time, to him Is aristocracy.      VI.  A SERVICE OF SONG.  Some keep the Sabbath going to church; I keep it staying at home, With a bobolink for a chorister, And an orchard for a dome.  Some keep the Sabbath in surplice; I just wear my wings, And instead of tolling the bell for church, Our little sexton sings.  God preaches, -- a noted clergyman, -- And the sermon is never long; So instead of getting to heaven at last, I'm going all along!      VII.  The bee is not afraid of me, I know the butterfly; The pretty people in the woods Receive me cordially.  The brooks laugh louder when I come, The breezes madder play. Wherefore, mine eyes, thy silver mists? Wherefore, O summer's day?      VIII.  SUMMER'S ARMIES.  Some rainbow coming from the fair! Some vision of the world Cashmere I confidently see! Or else a peacock's purple train, Feather by feather, on the plain Fritters itself away!  The dreamy butterflies bestir, Lethargic pools resume the whir Of last year's sundered tune. From some old fortress on the sun Baronial bees march, one by one, In murmuring platoon!  The robins stand as thick to-day As flakes of snow stood yesterday, On fence and roof and twig. The orchis binds her feather on For her old lover, Don the Sun, Revisiting the bog!  Without commander, countless, still, The regiment of wood and hill In bright detachment stand. Behold! Whose multitudes are these? The children of whose turbaned seas, Or what Circassian land?      IX.  THE GRASS.  The grass so little has to do, -- A sphere of simple green, With only butterflies to brood, And bees to entertain,  And stir all day to pretty tunes The breezes fetch along, And hold the sunshine in its lap And bow to everything;  And thread the dews all night, like pearls, And make itself so fine, -- A duchess were too common For such a noticing.  And even when it dies, to pass In odors so divine, As lowly spices gone to sleep, Or amulets of pine.  And then to dwell in sovereign barns, And dream the days away, -- The grass so little has to do, I wish I were the hay!      X.  A little road not made of man, Enabled of the eye, Accessible to thill of bee, Or cart of butterfly.  If town it have, beyond itself, 'T is that I cannot say; I only sigh, -- no vehicle Bears me along that way.      XI.  SUMMER SHOWER.  A drop fell on the apple tree, Another on the roof; A half a dozen kissed the eaves, And made the gables laugh.  A few went out to help the brook, That went to help the sea. Myself conjectured, Were they pearls, What necklaces could be!  The dust replaced in hoisted roads, The birds jocoser sung; The sunshine threw his hat away, The orchards spangles hung.  The breezes brought dejected lutes, And bathed them in the glee; The East put out a single flag, And signed the fete away.      XII.  PSALM OF THE DAY.  A something in a summer's day, As slow her flambeaux burn away, Which solemnizes me.  A something in a summer's noon, -- An azure depth, a wordless tune, Transcending ecstasy.  And still within a summer's night A something so transporting bright, I clap my hands to see;  Then veil my too inspecting face, Lest such a subtle, shimmering grace Flutter too far for me.  The wizard-fingers never rest, The purple brook within the breast Still chafes its narrow bed;  Still rears the East her amber flag, Guides still the sun along the crag His caravan of red,  Like flowers that heard the tale of dews, But never deemed the dripping prize Awaited their low brows;  Or bees, that thought the summer's name Some rumor of delirium No summer could for them;  Or Arctic creature, dimly stirred By tropic hint, -- some travelled bird Imported to the wood;  Or wind's bright signal to the ear, Making that homely and severe, Contented, known, before  The heaven unexpected came, To lives that thought their worshipping A too presumptuous psalm.      XIII.  THE SEA OF SUNSET.  This is the land the sunset washes, These are the banks of the Yellow Sea; Where it rose, or whither it rushes, These are the western mystery!  Night after night her purple traffic Strews the landing with opal bales; Merchantmen poise upon horizons, Dip, and vanish with fairy sails.      XIV.  PURPLE CLOVER.  There is a flower that bees prefer, And butterflies desire; To gain the purple democrat The humming-birds aspire.  And whatsoever insect pass, A honey bears away Proportioned to his several dearth And her capacity.  Her face is rounder than the moon, And ruddier than the gown Of orchis in the pasture, Or rhododendron worn.  She doth not wait for June; Before the world is green Her sturdy little countenance Against the wind is seen,  Contending with the grass, Near kinsman to herself, For privilege of sod and sun, Sweet litigants for life.  And when the hills are full, And newer fashions blow, Doth not retract a single spice For pang of jealousy.  Her public is the noon, Her providence the sun, Her progress by the bee proclaimed In sovereign, swerveless tune.  The bravest of the host, Surrendering the last, Nor even of defeat aware When cancelled by the frost.      XV.  THE BEE.  Like trains of cars on tracks of plush I hear the level bee: A jar across the flowers goes, Their velvet masonry  Withstands until the sweet assault Their chivalry consumes, While he, victorious, tilts away To vanquish other blooms.  His feet are shod with gauze, His helmet is of gold; His breast, a single onyx With chrysoprase, inlaid.  His labor is a chant, His idleness a tune; Oh, for a bee's experience Of clovers and of noon!      XVI.  Presentiment is that long shadow on the lawn Indicative that suns go down; The notice to the startled grass That darkness is about to pass.      XVII.  As children bid the guest good-night, And then reluctant turn, My flowers raise their pretty lips, Then put their nightgowns on.  As children caper when they wake, Merry that it is morn, My flowers from a hundred cribs Will peep, and prance again.      XVIII.  Angels in the early morning May be seen the dews among, Stooping, plucking, smiling, flying: Do the buds to them belong?  Angels when the sun is"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12252"],["title","The Prose Works of Jonathan Swift, D.D. — Volume 03 (#1)"],["body","went on to Leicester to visit his mother. He stayed with her until some time in December, but, by the middle of the same month, he was in London. During this absence from Ireland Swift corresponded somewhat freely with Archbishop King of Dublin, and with Archdeacon Walls--the letters to the former were first printed in Forster's \"Life of Swift.\" For these Forster was indebted to the Rev. Mr. Reeves (vicar of Lusk, co. Dublin), who discovered them in the record-room of the see of Armagh (see \"Life,\" p. 205 et seq. and note). One of Swift's intentions, while in the metropolis, was to push forward the claim of the Irish clergy for the remission of the First Fruits and Tenths, a grant which had already been conceded to the English clergy; and his letters to King often include requests for the necessary papers by means of which he could lay the matter before either Godolphin or Somers. Walls had written to Swift of the vacancy of the see of Waterford, and, from the reply to the archdeacon, we learn that even at so early a date Swift suffered a grievous disappointment; for in January, 1708, the bishopric, of which Swift had hopes, was presented to Dr. Thomas Milles. In his letter to Walls Swift confesses that he \"once had a glimpse that things would have gone otherwise.... But let us talk no further on this subject. I am stomach-sick of it already. ... Pray send me an account of some smaller vacancy in the Government's gift.\" It was to Somers, and through him to Lord Halifax, that Swift looked for recognition, either for services rendered, or because of their appreciation of his abilities. But, however much he may have been disappointed at their inaction, it may not be argued, as it has been, that Swift's so-called change in his political opinions was the outcome either of spleen or chagrin against the Whigs for their ingratitude towards him. It is, indeed, questionable whether Swift ever changed his political opinions, speaking of these as party opinions. From the day of his entrance, it may be said, into the orders of the Church, his first thought was for it; and on all political questions which touched Church matters Swift was neither Whig nor Tory, but churchman. It was because of the attitude of the Whigs towards the Church that Swift left them; and in his writings he does not spare the Tories even when he finds them taking up similar attitudes. On purely political questions Swift was too independent a thinker to be influenced by mere party views. That he wrote for the Tories must be put down to Harley's personal influence, and to his foresight which saw in Swift a man who must be treated as an equal with the highest in the land. Swift's intercourse with the leading men of his day only served to accentuate his consciousness of his superiority; and a party which would permit him the free play of his powers would be the party to which Swift would give his adhesion. Godolphin, Somers, and Walpole either did not recognize the genius of the man, or their own \"points of view\" did not permit them to give him the free play they felt he would obtain. Be that as it may, Harley gained not only a splendid party fighter, but a friend on whose affection he could ever rely.  In these tracts on Religion and the Church, which he wrote in the year 1708, Swift is not a party man, speaking for party purposes. He believed, and sincerely believed, that for such beings as were the men and women of this kingdom, the Church was, if not the highest and noblest instrument for good, yet the worthiest and ablest they had. Swift never lost himself in theories. He was, however, not blind to the dangers which an established religion might engender; but whatever its dangers, these would be inevitable to the most perfect system so long as human nature was as base as it was. The \"Argument\" is written in a vein of satirical banter; but the Swiftian cynicism permeates every line. It is the first of four tracts which form Swift's most important expression of his thoughts on Religion and the Church. Scott well describes it as \"one of the most felicitous efforts in our language, to engage wit and humour on the side of religion,\" and Forster speaks of it as \"having also that indefinable subtlety of style which conveys not the writer's knowledge of the subject only, but his power and superiority over it.\"  I have not been able to find a copy of the original edition of the \"Argument\" upon which to base the present text--for that I have gone to the first edition of the \"Miscellanies,\" published in 1711; but I have collated this with those given by the \"Miscellanies\" (1728), Faulkner, Hawkesworth, Scott, Morley, and Craik.  [T. S.]   AN ARGUMENT AGAINST ABOLISHING CHRISTIANITY.   I am very sensible what a weakness and presumption it is, to reason against the general humour and disposition of the world. I remember it was with great justice, and a due regard to the freedom both of the public and the press, forbidden upon several penalties to write,[1] or discourse, or lay wagers against the Union, even before it was confirmed by parliament, because that was looked upon as a design, to oppose the current of the people, which, besides the folly of it, is a manifest breach of the fundamental law that makes this majority of opinion the voice of God. In like manner, and for the very same reasons, it may perhaps be neither safe nor prudent to argue against the abolishing of Christianity, at a juncture when all parties appear[2] so unanimously determined upon the point, as we cannot but allow from their actions, their discourses, and their writings. However, I know not how, whether from the affectation of singularity, or the perverseness of human nature, but so it unhappily falls out, that I cannot be entirely of this opinion. Nay, though I were sure an order were issued for my immediate prosecution by the Attorney-General, I should still confess that in the present posture of our affairs at home or abroad, I do not yet see the absolute necessity of extirpating the Christian religion from among us.  [Footnote 1: This refers to the Jacobitism of the time, particularly among those who were opposed to the Union. A reference to Lord Mahon's \"Reign of Queen Anne\" will show how strong was the opposition in Scotland, and how severe were the measures taken to put down that opposition. [T.S.]]  [Footnote 2: Craik and Hawkesworth print the word \"seem,\" but the \"Miscellanies,\" Faulkner, and Scott give it as in the text. [T.S.]]  This perhaps may appear too great a paradox even for our wise and paradoxical age to endure; therefore I shall handle it with all tenderness, and with the utmost deference to that great and profound majority which is of another sentiment.  And yet the curious may please to observe, how much the genius of a nation is liable to alter in half an age. I have heard it affirmed for certain by some very old people, that the contrary opinion was even in their memories as much in vogue as the other is now; and, that a project for the abolishing of Christianity would then have appeared as singular, and been thought as absurd, as it would be at this time to write or discourse in its defence.  Therefore I freely own that all appearances are against me. The system of the Gospel, after the fate of other systems is generally antiquated and exploded, and the mass or body of the common people, among whom it seems to have had its latest credit, are now grown as much ashamed of it as their betters; opinions, like fashions, always descending from those of quality to the middle sort, and thence to the vulgar, where at length they are dropped and vanish.  But here I would not be mistaken, and must therefore be so bold as to borrow a distinction from the writers on the other side, when they make a difference between nominal and real Trinitarians. I hope no reader imagines me so weak to stand up in the defence of real Christianity, such as used in primitive times (if we may believe the authors of those ages) to have an influence upon men's belief and actions: To offer at the restoring of that would indeed be a wild project; it would be to dig up foundations; to destroy at one blow all the wit, and half the learning of the kingdom; to break the entire frame and constitution of things; to ruin trade, extinguish arts and sciences with the professors of them; in short, to turn our courts, exchanges, and shops into deserts; and would be full as absurd as the proposal of Horace,[3] where he advises the Romans all in a body to leave their city, and seek a new seat in some remote part of the world, by way of cure for the corruption of their manners.  [Footnote 3: This proposal is embodied in the 16th Epode, where, in an appeal \"to the Roman people,\" Horace advises them to fly the evils of tyranny and civil war by sailing away to \"the happy land, those islands of the blest:\"    \"Nos manet Oceanus circumvagus! arva, beata   Petamus arva, divites et insulas!\" [T.S.]]  Therefore I think this caution was in itself altogether unnecessary, (which I have inserted only to prevent all possibility of cavilling) since every candid reader will easily understand my discourse to be intended only in defence of nominal Christianity; the other having been for some time wholly laid aside by general consent, as utterly inconsistent with our present schemes of wealth and power.  But why we should therefore cast off the name and title of Christians, although the general opinion and resolution be so violent for it, I confess I cannot (with submission) apprehend the consequence necessary.[4] However, since the undertakers propose such wonderful advantages to the nation by this project, and advance many plausible objections against the system of Christianity, I shall briefly consider the strength of both, fairly allow them their greatest weight, and offer such answers as I think most reasonable. After which I will beg leave to shew what inconveniences may possibly happen by such an innovation, in the "]]]
