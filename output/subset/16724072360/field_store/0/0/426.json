Where do we see any signs of this poisonous cosmic disturbance?  Answer me that, sir! Answer me that!  Come, come, no evasion!  I pin you to an answer!\"  I felt more and more angry.  There was something very irritating and aggressive in Summerlee's demeanour.  \"I think that if you knew more about the facts you might be less positive in your opinion,\" said I.  Summerlee took his pipe from his mouth and fixed me with a stony stare.  \"Pray what do you mean, sir, by that somewhat impertinent observation?\"  \"I mean that when I was leaving the office the news editor told me that a telegram had come in confirming the general illness of the Sumatra natives, and adding that the lights had not been lit in the Straits of Sunda.\"  \"Really, there should be some limits to human folly!\" cried Summerlee in a positive fury.  \"Is it possible that you do not realize that ether, if for a moment we adopt Challenger's preposterous supposition, is a universal substance which is the same here as at the other side of the world?  Do you for an instant suppose that there is an English ether and a Sumatran ether?  Perhaps you imagine that the ether of Kent is in some way superior to the ether of Surrey, through which this train is now bearing us.  There really are no bounds to the credulity and ignorance of the average layman.  Is it conceivable that the ether in Sumatra should be so deadly as to cause total insensibility at the very time when the ether here has had no appreciable effect upon us whatever?  Personally, I can truly say that I never felt stronger in body or better balanced in mind in my life.\"  \"That may be.  I don't profess to be a scientific man,\" said I, \"though I have heard somewhere that the science of one generation is usually the fallacy of the next.  But it does not take much common sense to see that, as we seem to know so little about ether, it might be affected by some local conditions in various parts of the world and might show an effect over there which would only develop later with us.\"  \"With 'might' and 'may' you can prove anything,\" cried Summerlee furiously.  \"Pigs may fly.  Yes, sir, pigs _may_ fly--but they don't.  It is not worth arguing with you.  Challenger has filled you with his nonsense and you are both incapable of reason.  I had as soon lay arguments before those railway cushions.\"  \"I must say, Professor Summerlee, that your manners do not seem to have improved since I last had the pleasure of meeting you,\" said Lord John severely.  \"You lordlings are not accustomed to hear the truth,\" Summerlee answered with a bitter smile.  \"It comes as a bit of a shock, does it not, when someone makes you realize that your title leaves you none the less a very ignorant man?\"  \"Upon my word, sir,\" said Lord John, very stern and rigid, \"if you were a younger man you would not dare to speak to me in so offensive a fashion.\"  Summerlee thrust out his chin, with its little wagging tuft of goatee beard.  \"I would have you know, sir, that, young or old, there has never been a time in my life when I was afraid to speak my mind to an ignorant coxcomb--yes, sir, an ignorant coxcomb, if you had as many titles as slaves could invent and fools could adopt.\"  For a moment Lord John's eyes blazed, and then, with a tremendous effort, he mastered his anger and leaned back in his seat with arms folded and a bitter smile upon his face.  To me all this was dreadful and deplorable. Like a wave, the memory of the past swept over me, the good comradeship, the happy, adventurous days--all that we had suffered and worked for and won.  That it should have come to this--to insults and abuse!  Suddenly I was sobbing--sobbing in loud, gulping, uncontrollable sobs which refused to be concealed.  My companions looked at me in surprise.  I covered my face with my hands.  \"It's all right,\" said I.  \"Only--only it _is_ such a pity!\"  \"You're ill, young fellah, that's what's amiss with you,\" said Lord John. \"I thought you were queer from the first.\"  \"Your habits, sir, have not mended in these three years,\" said Summerlee, shaking his head.  \"I also did not fail to observe your strange manner the moment we met.  You need not waste your sympathy, Lord John.  These tears are purely alcoholic.  The man has been drinking.  By the way, Lord John, I called you a coxcomb just now, which was perhaps unduly severe. But the word reminds me of a small accomplishment, trivial but amusing, which I used to possess.  You know me as the austere man of science.  Can you believe that I once had a well-deserved reputation in several nurseries as a farmyard imitator?  Perhaps I can help you to pass the time in a pleasant way.  Would it amuse you to hear me crow like a cock?\"  \"No, sir,\" said Lord John, who was still greatly offended, \"it would _not_ amuse me.\"  \"My imitation of the clucking hen who had just laid an egg was also considered rather above the average.  Might I venture?\"  \"No, sir, no--certainly not.\"  But in spite of this earnest prohibition, Professor Summerlee laid down his pipe and for the rest of our journey he entertained--or failed to entertain--us by a succession of bird and animal cries which seemed so absurd that my tears were suddenly changed into boisterous laughter, which must have become quite hysterical as I sat opposite this grave Professor and saw him--or rather heard him--in the character of the uproarious rooster or the puppy whose tail had been trodden upon.  Once Lord John passed across his newspaper, upon the margin of which he had written in pencil, \"Poor devil!  Mad as a hatter.\"  No doubt it was very eccentric, and yet the performance struck me as extraordinarily clever and amusing.  Whilst this was going on, Lord John leaned forward and told me some interminable story about a buffalo and an Indian rajah which seemed to me to have neither beginning nor end.  Professor Summerlee had just begun to chirrup like a canary, and Lord John to get to the climax of his story, when the train drew up at Jarvis Brook, which had been given us as the station for Rotherfield.  And there was Challenger to meet us.  His appearance was glorious.  Not all the turkey-cocks in creation could match the slow, high-stepping dignity with which he paraded his own railway station and the benignant smile of condescending encouragement with which he regarded everybody around him.  If he had changed in anything since the days of old, it was that his points had become accentuated.  The huge head and broad sweep of forehead, with its plastered lock of black hair, seemed even greater than before.  His black beard poured forward in a more impressive cascade, and his clear grey eyes, with their insolent and sardonic eyelids, were even more masterful than of yore.  He gave me the amused hand-shake and encouraging smile which the head master bestows upon the small boy, and, having greeted the others and helped to collect their bags and their cylinders of oxygen, he stowed us and them away in a large motor-car which was driven by the same impassive Austin, the man of few words, whom I had seen in the character of butler upon the occasion of my first eventful visit to the Professor.  Our journey led us up a winding hill through beautiful country.  I sat in front with the chauffeur, but behind me my three comrades seemed to me to be all talking together.  Lord John was still struggling with his buffalo story, so far as I could make out, while once again I heard, as of old, the deep rumble of Challenger and the insistent accents of Summerlee as their brains locked in high and fierce scientific debate.  Suddenly Austin slanted his mahogany face toward me without taking his eyes from his steering-wheel.  \"I'm under notice,\" said he.  \"Dear me!\" said I.  Everything seemed strange to-day.  Everyone said queer, unexpected things.  It was like a dream.  \"It's forty-seven times,\" said Austin reflectively.  \"When do you go?\" I asked, for want of some better observation.  \"I don't go,\" said Austin.  The conversation seemed to have ended there, but presently he came back to it.  \"If I was to go, who would look after 'im?\"  He jerked his head toward his master.  \"Who would 'e get to serve 'im?\"  \"Someone else,\" I suggested lamely.  \"Not 'e.  No one would stay a week.  If I was to go, that 'ouse would run down like a watch with the mainspring out.  I'm telling you because you're 'is friend, and you ought to know.  If I was to take 'im at 'is word--but there, I wouldn't have the 'eart.  'E and the missus would be like two babes left out in a bundle.  I'm just everything.  And then 'e goes and gives me notice.\"  \"Why would no one stay?\" I asked.  \"Well, they wouldn't make allowances, same as I do.  'E's a very clever man, the master--so clever that 'e's clean balmy sometimes.  I've seen 'im right off 'is onion, and no error.  Well, look what 'e did this morning.\"  \"What did he do?\"  Austin bent over to me.  \"'E bit the 'ousekeeper,\" said he in a hoarse whisper.  \"Bit her?\"  \"Yes, sir.  Bit 'er on the leg.  I saw 'er with my own eyes startin' a marathon from the 'all-door.\"  \"Good gracious!\"  \"So you'd say, sir, if you could see some of the goings on.  'E don't make friends with the neighbors.  There's some of them thinks that when 'e was up among those monsters you wrote about, it was just ''Ome, Sweet 'Ome' for the master, and 'e was never in fitter company.  That's what _they_ say.  But I've served 'im ten years, and I'm fond of 'im, and, mind you, 'e's a great man, when all's said an' done, and it's an honor to serve 'im.  But 'e does try one cruel at times.

Ebenezer was fortunate in having such a wife and no pioneer could have been better blessed. She was not only a handsome woman, but one of remarkable force of character as well as kindness of heart. She was particularly noted for a rare skill in the treatment of illness, and her deftness in handling the surgeon's knife and extracting a poisoned bullet or arrow from a wound had restored to health many a settler when all had despaired.  The Zane brothers were best known on the border for their athletic prowess, and for their knowledge of Indian warfare and cunning. They were all powerful men, exceedingly active and as fleet as deer. In appearance they were singularly pleasing and bore a marked resemblance to one another, all having smooth faces, clear cut, regular features, dark eyes and long black hair.  When they were as yet boys they had been captured by Indians, soon after their arrival on the Virginia border, and had been taken far into the interior, and held as captives for two years. Ebenezer, Silas, and Jonathan Zane were then taken to Detroit and ransomed. While attempting to swim the Scioto river in an effort to escape, Andrew Zane had been shot and killed by his pursuers.  But the bonds that held Isaac Zane, the remaining and youngest brother, were stronger than those of interest or revenge such as had caused the captivity of his brothers. He was loved by an Indian princess, the daughter of Tarhe, the chief of the puissant Huron race. Isaac had escaped on various occasions, but had always been retaken, and at the time of the opening of our story nothing had been heard of him for several years, and it was believed he had been killed.  At the period of the settling of the little colony in the wilderness, Elizabeth Zane, the only sister, was living with an aunt in Philadelphia, where she was being educated.  Colonel Zane's house, a two story structure built of rough hewn logs, was the most comfortable one in the settlement, and occupied a prominent site on the hillside about one hundred yards from the fort. It was constructed of heavy timber and presented rather a forbidding appearance with its square corners, its ominous looking portholes, and strongly barred doors and windows. There were three rooms on the ground floor, a kitchen, a magazine room for military supplies, and a large room for general use. The several sleeping rooms were on the second floor, which was reached by a steep stairway.  The interior of a pioneer's rude dwelling did not reveal, as a rule, more than bare walls, a bed or two, a table and a few chairs--in fact, no more than the necessities of life. But Colonel Zane's house proved an exception to this. Most interesting was the large room. The chinks between the logs had been plastered up with clay and then the walls covered with white birch bark; trophies of the chase, Indian bows and arrows, pipes and tomahawks hung upon them; the wide spreading antlers of a noble buck adorned the space above the mantel piece; buffalo robes covered the couches; bearskin rugs lay scattered about on the hardwood floor. The wall on the western side had been built over a huge stone, into which had been cut an open fireplace.  This blackened recess, which had seen two houses burned over it, when full of blazing logs had cheered many noted men with its warmth. Lord Dunmore, General Clark, Simon Kenton, and Daniel Boone had sat beside that fire. There Cornplanter, the Seneca chief, had made his famous deal with Colonel Zane, trading the island in the river opposite the settlement for a barrel of whiskey. Logan, the Mingo chief and friend of the whites, had smoked many pipes of peace there with Colonel Zane. At a later period, when King Louis Phillippe, who had been exiled from France by Napoleon, had come to America, during the course of his melancholy wanderings he had stopped at Fort Henry a few days. His stay there was marked by a fierce blizzard and the royal guest passed most of his time at Colonel Zane's fireside. Musing by those roaring logs perhaps he saw the radiant star of the Man of Destiny rise to its magnificent zenith.  One cold, raw night in early spring the Colonel had just returned from one of his hunting trips and the tramping of horses mingled with the rough voices of the negro slaves sounded without. When Colonel Zane entered the house he was greeted affectionately by his wife and sister. The latter, at the death of her aunt in Philadelphia, had come west to live with her brother, and had been there since late in the preceding autumn. It was a welcome sight for the eyes of a tired and weary hunter. The tender kiss of his comely wife, the cries of the delighted children, and the crackling of the fire warmed his heart and made him feel how good it was to be home again after a three days' march in the woods. Placing his rifle in a corner and throwing aside his wet hunting coat, he turned and stood with his back to the bright blaze. Still young and vigorous, Colonel Zane was a handsome man. Tall, though not heavy, his frame denoted great strength and endurance. His face was smooth, his heavy eyebrows met in a straight line; his eyes were dark and now beamed with a kindly light; his jaw was square and massive; his mouth resolute; in fact, his whole face was strikingly expressive of courage and geniality. A great wolf dog had followed him in and, tired from travel, had stretched himself out before the fireplace, laying his noble head on the paws he had extended toward the warm blaze.  \"Well! Well! I am nearly starved and mighty glad to get back,\" said the Colonel, with a smile of satisfaction at the steaming dishes a negro servant was bringing from the kitchen.  \"We are glad you have returned,\" answered his wife, whose glowing face testified to the pleasure she felt. \"Supper is ready--Annie, bring in some cream--yes, indeed, I am happy that you are home. I never have a moment's peace when you are away, especially when you are accompanied by Lewis Wetzel.\"  \"Our hunt was a failure,\" said the Colonel, after he had helped himself to a plate full of roast wild turkey. \"The bears have just come out of their winter's sleep and are unusually wary at this time. We saw many signs of their work, tearing rotten logs to pieces in search of grubs and bees' nests. Wetzel killed a deer and we baited a likely place where we had discovered many bear tracks. We stayed up all night in a drizzling rain, hoping to get a shot. I am tired out. So is Tige. Wetzel did not mind the weather or the ill luck, and when we ran across some Indian sign he went off on one of his lonely tramps, leaving me to come home alone.\"  \"He is such a reckless man,\" remarked Mrs. Zane.  \"Wetzel is reckless, or rather, daring. His incomparable nerve carries him safely through many dangers, where an ordinary man would have no show whatever. Well, Betty, how are you?\"  \"Quite well,\" said the slender, dark-eyed girl who had just taken the seat opposite the Colonel.  \"Bessie, has my sister indulged in any shocking escapade in my absence? I think that last trick of hers, when she gave a bucket of hard cider to that poor tame bear, should last her a spell.\"  \"No, for a wonder Elizabeth has been very good. However, I do not attribute it to any unusual change of temperament; simply the cold, wet weather. I anticipate a catastrophe very shortly if she is kept indoors much longer.\"  \"I have not had much opportunity to be anything but well behaved. If it rains a few days more I shall become desperate. I want to ride my pony, roam the woods, paddle my canoe, and enjoy myself,\" said Elizabeth.  \"Well! Well! Betts, I knew it would be dull here for you, but you must not get discouraged. You know you got here late last fall, and have not had any pleasant weather yet. It is perfectly delightful in May and June. I can take you to fields of wild white honeysuckle and May flowers and wild roses. I know you love the woods, so be patient a little longer.\"  Elizabeth had been spoiled by her brothers--what girl would not have been by five great big worshippers?--and any trivial thing gone wrong with her was a serious matter to them. They were proud of her, and of her beauty and accomplishments were never tired of talking. She had the dark hair and eyes so characteristic of the Zanes; the same oval face and fine features: and added to this was a certain softness of contour and a sweetness of expression which made her face bewitching. But, in spite of that demure and innocent face, she possessed a decided will of her own, and one very apt to be asserted; she was mischievous; inclined to coquettishness, and more terrible than all she had a fiery temper which could be aroused with the most surprising ease.  Colonel Zane was wont to say that his sister's accomplishments were innumerable. After only a few months on the border she could prepare the flax and weave a linsey dresscloth with admirable skill. Sometimes to humor Betty the Colonel's wife would allow her to get the dinner, and she would do it in a manner that pleased her brothers, and called forth golden praises from the cook, old Sam's wife who had been with the family twenty years. Betty sang in the little church on Sundays; she organized and taught a Sunday school class; she often beat Colonel Zane and Major McColloch at their favorite game of checkers, which they had played together since they were knee high; in fact, Betty did nearly everything well, from baking pies to painting the birch bark walls of her room. But these things were insignificant in Colonel Zane's eyes. If the Colonel were ever guilty of bragging it was about his sister's ability in those acquirements demanding a true eye, a fleet foot, a strong arm and a daring spirit. He had told all the people in the settlement, to many of whom Betty was unknown, that she could ride like an Indian and shoot with undoubted skill; that she had a generous share of the Zanes' fleetness of foot, and that she would send a"]]]
