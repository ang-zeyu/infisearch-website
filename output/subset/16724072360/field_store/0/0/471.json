Now He would go the last step and give him the opportunity of using that power and so reaching the topmost levels. God led man to the hill of choice. The man must _climb_ the hill if he would reach its top.  Only the use of power gives actual possession of the power. What we do not use we lose. The pressure of the foot is always necessary to a clear title. To him that hath possible power shall be given actual power through use.  This opportunity was the last love-touch of God in opening up the way into the fulness of His image. With His ideal for man God went to His limit in _giving_ the power. He could give the power of choice. Man must _use_ the power given. Only so could he own what had been given. God could open the door. Man must step over the door-sill. Action realizes power.  The tree of knowledge of good and evil was the tree of choice. Obedience to God was the one thing involved. That simply meant, as it always means, keeping in warm touch with God. All good absolutely is bound up in this--_obeying God_, keeping in warm touch. To obey Him is the very heart of good. All evil is included in disobeying Him. To disobey, to fail to obey is the seeded core of all evil.  Whichever way he chose he would exercise his God-like power of choice. Whichever way he chose, the knowledge would come. If he chose to obey he would know good by choosing it, and evil by rejecting it. He knew neither good nor evil, for he had not yet had the contact of choice. Knowledge comes only through experience. In choosing not to obey, choosing to disobey, he would know evil with a bitter intimacy by choosing it. He would become acquainted with the good which he had shoved ruthlessly away.  With the opportunity came the temptation: God's opportunity; Satan's temptation. Satan is ever on the heels of God. Two inclined planes lead out of every man's path. Two doors open into them side by side. God's door up, the tempter's door down, and only a door-jamb between. Here the split hoof can be seen sticking from under the cloak's edge at the very start. Satan hates the truth. He is afraid of it. Yet he sneaks around the sheltering corner of what he fears and hates. The sugar coating of his gall pills he steals from God. The devil bare-faced, standing only on his own feet, would be instantly booted out at first approach. And right well he knows it.  A cunning half lie opens the way to a full-fledged lie, but still coupled with a half-truth. The suggestion that God was harshly prohibiting something that was needful leads to the further suggestion that He was arbitrarily, selfishly holding back the highest thing, the very thing He was supposed to be giving, that is, likeness to Himself. Eve was getting a course in suggestion. This was the first lesson. The school seems to be in session still. The whole purpose is to slander God, to misrepresent Him. That has been Satan's favorite method ever since. God is not good. He makes cruel prohibitions. He keeps from us what we should have. It is passing strange how every one of us has had that dust in his eyes. Some of us might leave the \"had\" out of that sentence.  See how cunningly the truth and the lie are interwoven by this old past-master in the sooty art of lying. \"Your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as God knowing good and evil.\" It was true because by the use of this highest power of choice he would become like God, and through choosing he would know. It is cunningly implied with a sticky, slimy cunning that, by not eating, that likeness and knowledge would not come. That was the lie. The choice either way would bring both this element of likeness to God in the sovereign power of choice, and the knowledge.  Then came the choice. The step up was a step down: up into the use of his highest power; down by the use of that power. In that wherein he was most like God in power, man became most unlike God in character. First the woman chose: then the man. Satan subtly begins his attack upon the woman. Because she was the weaker? Certainly not. Because she was the stronger. Not the leader in action, but the stronger in influence. He is the leader in action: she in influence. The greater includes the less. Satan is a master strategist, bold in his cunning. If the citadel can be gotten, all is won. If he _could_ get the woman he _would_ get the man. She includes him. She who was included in him now includes him. The last has become first.  She was deceived. He was not deceived. The woman chose unwarily for the supposed good. The man chose with open eyes for the woman's sake. Could the word gallantry be used? Was it supposed friendship? He would not abandon her? Yet he proved _not her friend_ that day, in stepping down to this new low level. Man's habit of giving smoothly spoken words to woman, while shying sharp-edged stones at her, should in all honesty be stopped. Man can throw no stones at woman. If the woman failed God that day, the man failed both God and the woman. If it be true that through her came the beginning of the world's sin, through her, too, be it gratefully and reverently remembered, came that which was far greater--the world's Saviour.  The choice was made. The act was done. Tremendous act! Bring your microscope and peer with awe into that single act. No fathoming line can sound its depth. No measuring rod its height nor breadth. No thought can pierce its intensity. That reaching arm went around a world. Millenniums in a moment. A million miles in a step. An ocean in a drop. Volumes in a word. A race in a woman. A hell of suffering in an act. The depths of woe in a glance. The first chapter of Romans in Genesis three, six. Sharpest pain in softest touch. God mistrusted--distrusted. Satan embraced. Sin's door open. Eden's gate shut.  Mark keenly the immediate result that came with that intense rapidity possible only to mental powers. At once they were both conscious of something that had not entered their thoughts before. To the pure all things are pure. To the imagination hurt by breaking away from God, the purest things can bring up suggestions directly opposite. Through the open door of disobedience came with lightning swiftness the suggestion of using a pure, holy function of the body in a way and for a purpose not intended. Making an end of that which was meant to be only a means to a highest end. Degrading to an animal pleasure that which held in its pure hallowed power the whole future of the race. There is absolutely no change save in the inner thought. But what a horrid heredity in that one flash of the imagination! Every sin lives first in the imagination. The imagination is sin's brooding and birth-place. An inner picture, a lingering glance, a wrong desire, an act--that is the story of every sin. The first step was disobedience. That opened the door. The first suggestion of wrong-doing that followed hot on the heels of that first step, through that open door, struck at the very vitals of the race--both its existence and its character. That first suggested unnatural action, with its whole brood, has become the commonest and slimiest sin of the race.  Here, in the beginning, the very thought _shocked_ them. In that lay their safety. Shame is the recoil of God's image from the touch of sin. Shame is sin's first checkmate. It is man's vantage for a fresh pull up. There are only two places where there is no shame: where there is no sin; where sin is steeped deepest in. The extremes are always jostling elbows. Instantly the sense of shame suggested a help. A simple bit of clothing was provided. It was so adjusted as to help most. Clothing is man's badge of shame. The first clothing was not for the body, but for the mind. Not for protection, but for concealment, that so the mind might be helped to forget its evil suggestions. It is one of sin's odd perversions that draws attention by color and cut to the race's badge of shame. It would seem strongly suggestive of moral degeneracy, or of bad taste, or, let us say in charity, of a lapse of historical memory.  Mark the sad soliloquy of God: \"Behold the man has become as one of us: He has exercised his power of choice.\" He tenderly refrains from saying, \"and has chosen wrong! so pitiably wrong!\" That was plain enough. He would not rub in the acid truth. He would not make the scar more hideous by pointing it out. \"And now _lest_ he put forth his hand and take of the tree of life.\" \"_Lest!_\" There is a further danger threatening. In his present condition he needs guarding for his own sake in the future. \"_Lest_\"--wrong choice limits future action. Sin narrows.  With man's act of sin came God's act of saving. Satan is ever on the heels of God to hurt man. But God is ever on the heels of Satan to cushion the hurt and save the man. It is a nip-and-tuck race with God a head and a heart in the lead. Something had to be done. Man had started sin in himself by his choice. The taint of disobedience, rebellion, had been breathed out into the air. He had gotten out of sorts with his surroundings. His presence would spoil his own heaven. The stain of his sin would have been upon his eternal life. The zero of selfishness would have been the atmosphere of his home. The touch of his unhallowed hand must be taken away for his own sake. That unhallowed touch _has_ been upon every function and relationship of life outside those gates. Nothing has escaped the slimy contact.  Sin _could_ not be allowed to stay _there_. Its presence stole heaven away from heaven. Yet sin had become a part of the man. The man and the wrong were interwoven. They were inseparable. Sin has such a tenacious, gluey, sticky touch! Each included the other. _It_ could not be put out without _his_ being put out. So man had to be driven out for his own sake to rid his home-spot of sin. The man was driven out that he might come back--_changed_. Love drove him out that later it might let him in.

He demands the utmost from every officer, non-com and private.  Are you prepared, and resolved, from this moment, to give the utmost that is in you at all times?\"  \"Yes, sir!\" replied Mock with great emphasis.  \"You mean what you are saying, Sergeant?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Very good, then,\" continued the young captain.  \"I am going to take your word for it this time.  But if I ever find you slacking or shirking again, I am going to go to the colonel immediately and ask him to 'break' you back to the ranks.\"  \"Yes, sir,\" assented Mock, saluting.  \"Are you fully familiar with all your drill work?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Then remember that our enemies, the German soldiers, are men who are drilled and drilled until they are perfect in their work, and that their discipline is amazing.  Keep the fact in mind that we can hardly hope to whip our enemies unless we are at least as good soldiers as they.  That is all.  Go back to your men, Sergeant.\"  Standing stiffly erect, Sergeant Mock brought up his right hand in a crisp salute, then wheeled and walked briskly back to join his men.  Greg turned as if to say that he did not feel the need of remaining to watch the rebuked sergeant.  \"By Jove!\" uttered Captain Cartwright.  \"I do wish, Holmes, you'd come over and dress down some of my non-coms.  I've been trying for three days to put 'pep' into some of them, and the K.O. frowned at me this morning.\"  \"Non-com\" is the Army abbreviation for \"non-commissioned officers\"---corporals and sergeants---while \"K.O.\" is Army slang for commanding officer.  Arrived at an unpainted wooden barracks, in size and appearance just like those of the enlisted men, the three captains entered and walked up a flight of stairs to the floor above.  Here they passed through a narrow corridor with doors on both sides that bore the cards of the officers who slept behind the respective doors.  Cartwright went to his own room, while Greg followed Dick into the latter's quarters.  Plain enough was the room, seven and a half feet wide and ten feet in length, with a single sliding window at the front.  Walls and ceiling, like the floor, were of pine boards.  There were shelves around two sides of the room, with clothing hooks underneath. Under the window was a desk, with a cot to one side; the rest of the furniture consisted of two folding camp chairs.  Entering, Dick hung up his campaign hat on one of the hooks, Greg doing the same.  On account of the heat of the day neither young captain wore a tunic.  Each unbuttoned the top button of his olive drab Army shirt before he dropped into a chair.  \"What do you think of the new K.O.?\" Dick asked, as he picked a newspaper up from the desk and started to fan himself.  \"He means business,\" Greg returned.  \"I am glad he does,\" Dick went on.  \"This is no time for slack soldiering.  Greg, I'll feel consoled for working eighteen hours a day if it results in making the Ninety-ninth the best infantry regiment of the line.\"  \"Can it be done?\" Greg inquired.  \"Yes.\"  \"But I've a hunch that every other regiment is striving for the same honor,\" Captain Holmes continued.  \"Ours isn't the only K.O. who covets the honor of commanding the best regiment of 'em all.\"  \"It can be done,\" Dick insisted, \"and I say it must be done.\"  \"Yet other regiments would be so close to us in excellence that it would be hard to name the one that is really best.\"  \"In that case we wouldn't have won the honor,\" Dick smilingly insisted.  \"Then consider that fellow Cartwright,\" Greg added, lowering his voice a bit.  \"He's a born shirker, and one weak company would make a regiment that much poorer.\"  \"If Cartwright shirks, then mark my word that he'll be dropped,\" Dick rejoined quickly.  \"But Greg, man, this is war-time, and the biggest and most serious war in which we were ever engaged. There must be no doubts---no ifs or buts.  We must have a regiment one hundred per cent. perfect.  I'm going to do my share with a company one hundred percent. good, even if I don't find time for any sleep.\"  Up the corridor there sounded a knock at a door.  Something was said in a low voice.  Then the knock was repeated on Prescott's door.  \"Come in!\" called Dick.  An orderly entered saluting.  \"Orders from the adjutant, sir,\" said the soldier, handing Prescott a folded paper.  He handed one like it to Greg, then saluted and left the room, knocking at the next door.  \"Company drill from one to two-thirty,\" summarized Prescott, glancing through the typewritten words on the unfolded sheet.  \"Practice march by battalions from two-forty-five to three-forty-five. Squad drill from four o'clock until retreat.  That looks brisk, Greg.\"  \"Doesn't it?\" asked Holmes, without too plain signs of enthusiasm. \"Company drill and the hike call for our presence, preferably, and yet I've paper work enough to keep me busy until evening mess.\"  \"Paper work,\" so-called, is the bane of life for the company commander. It consists of keeping, making and signing records, of the keeping and inspection of accounts; it deals with requisitions for supplies and an endless number of reports.  \"I have a barrelful of paper work, too,\" Dick admitted.  \"But I'm going to see everything going well on the drill ground before I go near company office.\"  \"All good things must end,\" grunted Greg, rising to his feet, \"even this rest.  Mess will be on in eight minutes.\"  The instant that the door had closed Dick drew off his olive drab shirt, drew out a lidded box from under the bed and deposited the shirt therein, next restoring the box to place bring out a basin from under the bed and placing it on a chair, he found towel and soap and busied himself with washing up.  His toilet completed, he took a clean shirt from a bundle on one of the neatly arranged shelves and donned the garment.  A few more touches, and, spick-and-span, clean and very soldierly looking, he descended to the ground floor. A glance into the mess-room showed him that the noon meal was not yet ready, so be sauntered to the doorway, remaining just inside out of the sun's rays.  Other officers gathered quickly.  A waiter from mess appeared at the inner doorway, speaking a quiet word that caused the regiment's officers, except the colonel and his staff, to file inside.  Plain pine tables, without cloths, long pine benches nailed to the floor---officers' mess was exactly like that of the enlisted men, save that officers' mess was provided with heavy crockery, while in the company mess-rooms the men ate from aluminum mess-kits.  Most of the food was already in place on the table.  The meal began with a lively hum of conversation.  Occasionally some merry officer called out jokingly to some officer at another table; there was no special effort at dignified silence.  \"The K.O. has our number!\" exclaimed an irrepressible lieutenant.  \"How so?\" demanded Noll Terry, Prescott's first lieutenant.  \"He knows us for a bunch of shirkers, and so he gave us the 'pep' talk this morning.\"  \"Is the 'pep' going to work with you?\" asked Noll laughingly.  \"Surely!  I wouldn't dare be slow, even in drawing my breath, after hearing the K.O. talk in that fashion.\"  \"Same here,\" Noll nodded.  \"I've been working sixteen hours a day ever since I hit camp,\" chimed in another lieutenant.  \"What's the new system going to be?  Eighteen hours a day?\"  \"Twenty, perhaps,\" said Greg's first lieutenant cheerfully.  The meal had been under way for fifteen minutes when Captain Cartwright entered leisurely.  \"I suppose you fellows have eaten all the best stuff,\" he called, as he looked about and found a vacant seat, though he paused as if in no great haste to occupy it.  \"Same old Cartwright,\" observed Greg, in an undertone to Dick. \"He's late, even at mess formation.\"  But Cartwright heard, and wheeled about, looking half-angrily at young Captain Holmes.  \"Say, Holmes, you're as free as ever with your tongue.\"  \"Yes,\" Greg answered unconcernedly.  \"Using it to taste my food, and I've been finding the taste uncommonly pleasant.\"  \"You use your tongue in more ways than that,\" snapped Captain Cartwright.  \"I happened to hear what you said about me in Prescott's room a few minutes ago.\"  \"Eavesdropping?\" queried Greg calmly.  \"What's that?\" snapped Cartwright, and his flush deepened.  \"See here, Holmes, I don't want any trouble with you.\"  \"That shows a lively sense of discretion,\" smiled Greg, turning to face the other.  \"But I want you to stop picking on me.  Talk about somebody else for a change!\"  \"With pleasure,\" nodded Greg, as he shrugged his shoulders and turned to drop a spoonful of sugar in his second cup of coffee. \"There are lots of agreeable subjects for conversation in Camp Berry.\"  \"Meaning---?\" demanded Cartwright, still standing, and scowling, for, out of the corners of his eyes, he saw that several of his brother officers were smiling.  \"Meaning almost anything that you wish,\" continued Captain Holmes, serenely, as he stirred his coffee.  \"Sit down, Cartwright,\" urged a low voice.  \"This is a gentleman's outfit,\" declared another voice, perhaps not intended to reach Cartwright's ears.  But he heard the words and his mounting rage caused him to take a step nearer to Greg, at the same time clenching his fists.  Greg, though he realized what was taking place, did not bother to turn, but coolly raised his cup to his lips.  \"Sit down,\" called another voice.  \"You're rocking the boat.\"  But Cartwright took a second step.  It is impossible to say what would have happened, but Dick Prescott, half turning in his seat, caught the angry captain's nearer wrist in a grip of steel and fairly swang Cartwright into a vacant seat at his left.  Greg was sitting at his right.  \"Don't be foolish, Cartwright, and don't let the day's heat go to your head,\" Prescott advised.  \"Don't do anything you'd regret.\"  Though Captain Cartwright's blood was boiling there was a sense of quiet mastery in Prescott's manner and voice, combined with a quality of leadership that restrained"]]]
