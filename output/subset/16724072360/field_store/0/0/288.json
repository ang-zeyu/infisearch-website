Because pockets have been used by men to carry tobacco, pipes, whiskey flasks, chewing gum and compromising letters. We see no reason to suppose that women would use them more wisely.     Fashion Notes: Past and Present   1880--Anti-suffrage arguments are being worn long, calm and flowing this year, with the dominant note that of woman's intellectual inferiority.  1890--Violence is very evident in this season's modes, and our more conservative thinkers are saying that woman suffrage threatens the home, the Church and the Republic.  1900--A complete change of style has taken place. Everything is being worn _a l'aristocrate_, with the repeated assertion that too many people are voting already.  1915--The best line of goods shown by the leading anti-suffrage houses this spring is the statement that woman suffrage is the same thing as free love. The effect is extremely piquant and surprising.     Why We Oppose Women Travelling in Railway Trains   1. Because travelling in trains is not a natural right.  2. Because our great-grandmothers never asked to travel in trains.  3. Because woman's place is the home, not the train.  4. Because it is unnecessary; there is no point reached by a train that cannot be reached on foot.  5. Because it will double the work of conductors, engineers and brakemen who are already overburdened.  6. Because men smoke and play cards in trains. Is there any reason to believe that women will behave better?     Why We Oppose Schools for Children   (_By the Children's Anti-School League_.)  1. Because education is a burden, not a right.  2. Because not one-tenth of one per cent. of the children of this country have demanded education.  3. Because if we are educated we should have to behave as if we were and we don't want to.  4. Because it is essentially against the nature of a child to be educated.  5. Because we can't see that it has done so much for grown-ups, and there is no reason for thinking it will make children perfect.  6. Because the time of children is already sufficiently occupied without going to school.  7. Because it would make dissension between parent and child. Imagine the home life of a parent who turned out to be more ignorant than his (or her) child?  8. Because we believe in the indirect education of the theatre, the baseball field and the moving picture. We believe that schools would in a great measure deprive us of this.  9. Because our parents went to school. They love us, they take care of us, they tell us what to do. We are content that they should be educated for us.     But Then Who Cares for Figures   An argument sometimes used against paying women as highly as men for the same work is that women are only temporarily in industry.  Forty-four per cent of the women teachers in the public schools of New York have been more than ten years in the service, while only twenty-six per cent of the men teachers have served as long.         *       *       *       *       *  The Bundesrath of Germany has decided to furnish medical and financial assistance to women at the time of childbirth, in order \"to alleviate the anxiety of husbands at the front.\"  How strange this would sound: \"The Bundesrath has decided to furnish medical assistance to the wounded at the front, in order to alleviate the anxiety of wives and mothers at home.\"  When a benefit is suggested for men, the question asked is: \"Will it benefit men?\"  When a benefit is suggested for women, the question is: \"Will it benefit men?\"     Why We Oppose Votes for Men   1. Because man's place is the armory.  2. Because no really manly man wants to settle any question otherwise than by fighting about it.  3. Because if men should adopt peaceable methods women will no longer look up to them.  4. Because men will lose their charm if they step out of their natural sphere and interest themselves in other matters than feats of arms, uniforms and drums.  5. Because men are too emotional to vote. Their conduct at baseball games and political conventions shows this, while their innate tendency to appeal to force renders them peculiarly unfit for the task of government.     The Logic of the Law   In 1875 the Supreme Court of Wisconsin in denying the petition of women to practise before it said:  \"It would be shocking to man's reverence for womanhood and faith in woman ... that woman should be permitted to mix professionally in all the nastiness which finds its way into courts of justice.\"  It then names thirteen subjects as unfit for the attention of women--three of them are crimes committed against women.     Consistency   (\"Vile insults, lewd talk and brutal conduct were used by the indicted men to frighten respectable women who went to the polls in Terre Haute at the last election, asserted District Attorney Dailey.\"--_Press Dispatch_.)  Are the polls unfit for decent women?  No, sir, they are perfectly orderly.  Tut, tut! Go there at once and swear and be brutal, or what will become of our anti-suffrage argument?     Sometimes We're Ivy, and Sometimes We're Oak   Is it true that the English government is calling on women to do work abandoned by men?  Yes, it is true.  Is not woman's place the home?  No, not when men need her services outside the home.  Will she never be told again that her place is the home?  Oh, yes, indeed.  When?  As soon as men want their jobs back again.     Do You Know   That in 1869 Miss Jex-Blake and four other women entered for a medical degree at the University of Edinburgh?  That the president of the College of Physicians refused to give the women the prizes they had won?  That the undergraduates insulted any professor who allowed women to compete for prizes?  That the women were stoned in the streets, and finally excluded from the medical school?  That in 1877 the British Medical Association declared women ineligible for membership?  That in 1881 the International Medical Congress excluded women from all but its \"social and ceremonial meetings\"?  That the Obstetrical Society refused to allow a woman's name to appear on the title page of a pamphlet which she had written with her husband?  That according to a recent dispatch from London, many hospitals, since the outbreak of hostilities, have asked women to become resident physicians, and public authorities are daily endeavoring to obtain women as assistant medical officers and as school doctors?     Interviews With Celebrated Anti-Suffragists   \"Woman's place is in my home.\"--Appius Claudius.  \"I have never felt the need of the ballot.\"--Cleopatra.  \"Magna Charta merely fashionable fad of ye Barons.\"--King John.  \"Boston Tea Party shows American colonists to be hysterical and utterly incapable of self-government.\"--George III.  \"Know of no really good slaves who desire emancipation.\"--President of the United Slaveholders' Protective Association.     Another of Those Curious Coincidences   On February 15, the House of Representatives passed a bill making it unlawful to ship in interstate commerce the products of a mill, cannery or factory which have been produced by the labor of children under fourteen years.  Forty-three gentlemen voted against it.  Forty-one of those forty-three had also voted against the woman suffrage bill.  Not one single vote was cast against it by a representative from any state where women vote for Congressmen.     The New Freedom   \"The Michigan commission on industrial relations has discovered,\" says \"The Detroit Journal,\" \"that thousands of wives support their husbands.\"  Woman's place is the home, but under a special privilege she is sometimes allowed to send her wages as a substitute.     To the Great Dining Out Majority   The New York State Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage is sending out leaflets to its members urging them to \"tell every man you meet, your tailor, your postman, your grocer, as well as your _dinner partner_, that you are opposed to woman suffrage.\"  We hope that the 90,000 sewing machine operatives, the 40,000 saleswomen, the 32,000 laundry operatives, the 20,000 knitting and silk mill girls, the 17,000 women janitors and cleaners, the 12,000 cigar-makers, to say nothing of the 700,000 other women and girls in industry in New York State, will remember when they have drawn off their long gloves and tasted their oysters to tell their dinner partners that they are opposed to woman suffrage because they fear it might take women out of the home.     WOMEN'S SPHERE     Many Men to Any Woman       If you have beauty, charm, refinement, tact,     If you can prove that should I set you free,     You would not contemplate the smallest act     That might annoy or interfere with me.     If you can show that women will abide     By the best standards of their womanhood--     (And I must be the person to decide     What in a woman is the highest good);     If you display efficiency supreme     In philanthropic work devoid of pay;     If you can show a clearly thought-out scheme     For bringing the millennium in a day:       Why, then, dear lady, at some time remote,     I might consider giving you the vote.     A Sex Difference       When men in Congress come to blows at something someone said,     I always notice that it shows their blood is quick and red;     But if two women disagree, with very little noise,     It proves, and this seems strange to me, that women have no poise.     Advice to Heroines   I      A heroine must shrink and cling       When heroes are about,     And thus the watching world will think:       \"How brave his heart and stout!\"     But if he chance to be away       When bright-faced dangers shine,     It will be best for her to play       The oak-tree, not the vine.     In fact the most important thing     Is knowing when it's time to cling.   II  _With apologies to R.L.S._      A heroine must be polite     And do what others say is right,     And think men wise and formidable--     At least as far as she is able.

You know it _might_ ...  \"Of course if you think _not_--\"  Redwood reflected with his eyes on the fire and made no objection.  \"You think it would do?\"  Redwood moved his head gravely.  \"It might be Titanophorbia, you know. Food of Titans.... You prefer the former?  \"You're quite sure you don't think it a little _too_--\"  \"No.\"  \"Ah! I'm glad.\"  And so they called it Herakleophorbia throughout their investigations, and in their report,--the report that was never published, because of the unexpected developments that upset all their arrangements,--it is invariably written in that way. There were three kindred substances prepared before they hit on the one their speculations had foretolds and these they spoke of as Herakleophorbia I, Herakleophorbia II, and Herakleophorbia III. It is Herakleophorbia IV. which I--insisting upon Bensington's original name--call here the Food of the Gods.   III.  The idea was Mr. Bensington's. But as it was suggested to him by one of Professor Redwood's contributions to the Philosophical Transactions, he very properly consulted that gentleman before he carried it further. Besides which it was, as a research, a physiological, quite as much as a chemical inquiry.  Professor Redwood was one of those scientific men who are addicted to tracings and curves. You are familiar--if you are at all the sort of reader I like--with the sort of scientific paper I mean. It is a paper you cannot make head nor tail of, and at the end come five or six long folded diagrams that open out and show peculiar zigzag tracings, flashes of lightning overdone, or sinuous inexplicable things called \"smoothed curves\" set up on ordinates and rooting in abscissae--and things like that. You puzzle over the thing for a long time and end with the suspicion that not only do you not understand it but that the author does not understand it either. But really you know many of these scientific people understand the meaning of their own papers quite well: it is simply a defect of expression that raises the obstacle between us.  I am inclined to think that Redwood thought in tracings and curves. And after his monumental work upon Reaction Times (the unscientific reader is exhorted to stick to it for a little bit longer and everything will be as clear as daylight) Redwood began to turn out smoothed curves and sphygmographeries upon Growth, and it was one of his papers upon Growth that really gave Mr. Bensington his idea.  Redwood, you know, had been measuring growing things of all sorts, kittens, puppies, sunflowers, mushrooms, bean plants, and (until his wife put a stop to it) his baby, and he showed that growth went out not at a regular pace, or, as he put it, so,                 /               /              /             /            /           /          /         /        /       /      /  but with bursts and intermissions of this sort,                         _____                       /                      /                _____/               /              /        _____/       /      /     /  and that apparently nothing grew regularly and steadily, and so far as he could make out nothing could grow regularly and steadily: it was as if every living thing had just to accumulate force to grow, grew with vigour only for a time, and then had to wait for a space before it could go on growing again. And in the muffled and highly technical language of the really careful \"scientist,\" Redwood suggested that the process of growth probably demanded the presence of a considerable quantity of some necessary substance in the blood that was only formed very slowly, and that when this substance was used up by growth, it was only very slowly replaced, and that meanwhile the organism had to mark time. He compared his unknown substance to oil in machinery. A growing animal was rather like an engine, he suggested, that can move a certain distance and must then be oiled before it can run again. (\"But why shouldn't one oil the engine from without?\" said Mr. Bensington, when he read the paper.) And all this, said Redwood, with the delightful nervous inconsecutiveness of his class, might very probably be found to throw a light upon the mystery of certain of the ductless glands. As though they had anything to do with it at all!  In a subsequent communication Redwood went further. He gave a perfect Brock's benefit of diagrams--exactly like rocket trajectories they were; and the gist of it--so far as it had any gist--was that the blood of puppies and kittens and the sap of sunflowers and the juice of mushrooms in what he called the \"growing phase\" differed in the proportion of certain elements from their blood and sap on the days when they were not particularly growing.  And when Mr. Bensington, after holding the diagrams sideways and upside down, began to see what this difference was, a great amazement came upon him. Because, you see, the difference might probably be due to the presence of just the very substance he had recently been trying to isolate in his researches upon such alkaloids as are most stimulating to the nervous system. He put down Redwood's paper on the patent reading-desk that swung inconveniently from his arm-chair, took off his gold-rimmed spectacles, breathed on them and wiped them very carefully.  \"By Jove!\" said Mr. Bensington.  Then replacing his spectacles again he turned to the patent reading-desk, which immediately, as his elbow came against its arm, gave a coquettish squeak and deposited the paper, with all its diagrams in a dispersed and crumpled state, on the floor. \"By Jove!\" said Mr. Bensington, straining his stomach over the arm-chair with a patient disregard of the habits of this convenience, and then, finding the pamphlet still out of reach, he went down on all fours in pursuit. It was on the floor that the idea of calling it the Food of the Gods came to him....  For you see, if he was right and Redwood was right, then by injecting or administering this new substance of his in food, he would do away with the \"resting phase,\" and instead of growth going on in this fashion,                         _____                       /                      /                _____/               /              /        _____/       /      /     /  it would (if you follow me) go thus--                 /               /              /             /            /           /          /         /        /       /      /   IV.  The night after his conversation with Redwood Mr. Bensington could scarcely sleep a wink. He did seem once to get into a sort of doze, but it was only for a moment, and then he dreamt he had dug a deep hole into the earth and poured in tons and tons of the Food of the Gods, and the earth was swelling and swelling, and all the boundaries of the countries were bursting, and the Royal Geographical Society was all at work like one great guild of tailors letting out the equator....  That of course was a ridiculous dream, but it shows the state of mental excitement into which Mr. Bensington got and the real value he attached to his idea, much better than any of the things he said or did when he was awake and on his guard. Or I should not have mentioned it, because as a general rule I do not think it is at all interesting for people to tell each other about their dreams.  By a singular coincidence Redwood also had a dream that night, and his dream was this:--          |         |         |         |         |         |         |         |         |         |  It was a diagram done in fire upon a long scroll of the abyss. And he (Redwood) was standing on a planet before a sort of black platform lecturing about the new sort of growth that was now possible, to the More than Royal Institution of Primordial Forces--forces which had always previously, even in the growth of races, empires, planetary systems, and worlds, gone so:--                       _____                     /               _____/              /        _____/       /      /  And even in some cases so:--                  ____              /    \\        _____/       /      /  And he was explaining to them quite lucidly and convincingly that these slow, these even retrogressive methods would be very speedily quite put out of fashion by his discovery.  Ridiculous of course! But that too shows--  That either dream is to be regarded as in any way significant or prophetic beyond what I have categorically said, I do not for one moment suggest.     CHAPTER THE SECOND.  THE EXPERIMENTAL FARM.   I.  Mr. Bensington proposed originally to try this stuff, so soon as he was really able to prepare it, upon tadpoles. One always does try this sort of thing upon tadpoles to begin with; this being what tadpoles are for. And it was agreed that he should conduct the experiments and not Redwood, because Redwood's laboratory was occupied with the ballistic apparatus and animals necessary for an investigation into the Diurnal Variation in the Butting Frequency of the Young Bull Calf, an investigation that was yielding curves of an abnormal and very perplexing sort, and the presence of glass globes of tadpoles was extremely undesirable while this particular research was in progress.  But when Mr. Bensington conveyed to his cousin Jane something of what he had in mind, she put a prompt veto upon the importation of any considerable number of tadpoles, or any such experimental creatures, into their flat. She had no objection whatever to his use of one of the rooms of the flat for the purposes of a non-explosive chemistry that, so far as she was concerned, came to nothing; she let him have a gas furnace and a sink and a dust-tight cupboard of refuge from the weekly storm of cleaning she would not forego. And having known people addicted to drink, she regarded his solicitude for distinction in learned societies as an excellent substitute for the coarser form of depravity. But any sort of living things in quantity, \"wriggly\" as they were bound to be alive and \"smell"]]]
