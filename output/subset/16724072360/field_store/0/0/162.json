Miraculous.  _Cle_.       This speech calls him _Spaniard_, being nothing but                 A large inventory of his own commendations.                                                  [_Enter_ Philaster.  _Di_.         I wonder what's his price? For certainly he'll tell                 himself he has so prais'd his shape: But here comes one                 more worthy those large speeches, than the large                 speaker of them? let me be swallowed quick, if I can                 find, in all the Anatomy of yon mans vertues, one sinew                 sound enough to promise for him, he shall be Constable.                 By this Sun, he'll ne're make King unless it be for trifles,                 in my poor judgment.  _Phi_.       Right Noble Sir, as low as my obedience,                 And with a heart as Loyal as my knee,                 I beg your favour.  _King_.    Rise, you have it Sir.  _Di_.        Mark but the King how pale he looks with fear.                 Oh! this same whorson Conscience, how it jades us!  _King_.     Speak your intents Sir.  _Phi_.       Shall I speak 'um freely?                 Be still my royal Soveraign.  _King_.    As a subject                 We give you freedom.  _Di_.        Now it heats.  _Phi_.       Then thus I turn                 My language to you Prince, you foreign man.                 Ne're stare nor put on wonder, for you must                 Indure me, and you shall. This earth you tread upon                 (A dowry as you hope with this fair Princess,                 Whose memory I bow to) was not left                 By my dead Father (Oh, I had a Father)                 To your inheritance, and I up and living,                 Having my self about me and my sword,                 The souls of all my name, and memories,                 These arms and some few friends, besides the gods,                 To part so calmly with it, and sit still,                 And say I might have been! I tell thee _Pharamond_,                 When thou art King, look I be dead and rotten,                 And my name ashes; For, hear me _Pharamond_,                 This very ground thou goest on, this fat earth,                 My Fathers friends made fertile with their faiths,                 Before that day of shame, shall gape and swallow                 Thee and thy Nation, like a hungry grave,                 Into her hidden bowels: Prince, it shall;                 By _Nemesis_ it shall.  _Pha_.      He's mad beyond cure, mad.  _Di_.        Here's a fellow has some fire in's veins:                 The outlandish Prince looks like a Tooth-drawer.  _Phi_.        Sir, Prince of Poppingjayes, I'le make it well appear                 To you I am not mad.  _King_.    You displease us.                 You are too bold.  _Phi_.      No Sir, I am too tame,                 Too much a Turtle, a thing born without passion,                 A faint shadow, that every drunken cloud sails over,                 And makes nothing.  _King_.     I do not fancy this,                 Call our Physicians: sure he is somewhat tainted.  _Thra_.     I do not think 'twill prove so.  _Di_.        H'as given him a general purge already, for all the                 right he has, and now he means to let him blood: Be                 constant Gentlemen; by these hilts I'le run his                 hazard, although I run my name out of the                 Kingdom.  _Cle_.      Peace, we are one soul.  _Pha_.     What you have seen in me, to stir offence,                 I cannot find, unless it be this Lady                 Offer'd into mine arms, with the succession,                 Which I must keep though it hath pleas'd your fury                 To mutiny within you; without disputing                 Your _Genealogies_, or taking knowledge                 Whose branch you are. The King will leave it me;                 And I dare make it mine; you have your answer.  _Phi_.       If thou wert sole inheritor to him,                 That made the world his; and couldst see no sun                 Shine upon any but thine: were _Pharamond_                 As truly valiant, as I feel him cold,                 And ring'd among the choicest of his friends,                 Such as would blush to talk such serious follies,                 Or back such bellied commendations,                 And from this present, spight of all these bugs,                 You should hear further from me.  _King_.    Sir, you wrong the Prince:                 I gave you not this freedom to brave our best friends,                 You deserve our frown: go to, be better temper'd.  _Phi_.       It must be Sir, when I am nobler us'd.  _Gal_.       Ladyes,                 This would have been a pattern of succession,                 Had he ne're met this mischief. By my life,                 He is the worthiest the true name of man                 This day within my knowledge.  _Meg_.      I cannot tell what you may call your knowledge,                 But the other is the man set in mine eye;                 Oh! 'tis a Prince of wax.  _Gal_.       A Dog it is.  _King_.     _Philaster_, tell me,                 The injuries you aim at in your riddles.  _Phi_.       If you had my eyes Sir, and sufferance,                 My griefs upon you and my broken fortunes,                 My want's great, and now nought but hopes and fears,                 My wrongs would make ill riddles to be laught at.                 Dare you be still my King and right me not?  _King_.    Give me your wrongs in private.                                                   [_They whisper_.  _Phi_.      Take them, and ease me of a load would bow strong Atlas.  _Di_.       He dares not stand the shock.  _Di_.        I cannot blame, him, there's danger in't. Every man                 in this age, has not a soul of Crystal for all men to                 read their actions through: mens hearts and faces are                 so far asunder, that they hold no intelligence. Do but                 view yon stranger well, and you shall see a Feaver                 through all his bravery, and feel him shake like a true                 Tenant; if he give not back his Crown again, upon the                 report of an Elder Gun, I have no augury.  _King_.    Go to:                 Be more your self, as you respect our favour:                 You'I stir us else: Sir, I must have you know                 That y'are and shall be at our pleasure, what fashion we                 Will put upon you: smooth your brow, or by the gods.  _Phi_.       I am dead Sir, y'are my fate: it was not I                 Said I was not wrong'd: I carry all about me,                 My weak stars led me to all my weak fortunes.                 Who dares in all this presence speak (that is                 But man of flesh and may be mortal) tell me                 I do not most intirely love this Prince,                 And honour his full vertues!  _King_.    Sure he's possest.  _Phi_.       Yes, with my Fathers spirit; It's here O King!                 A dangerous spirit; now he tells me King,                 I was a Kings heir, bids me be a King,                 And whispers to me, these be all my Subjects.                 'Tis strange, he will not let me sleep, but dives                 Into my fancy, and there gives me shapes                 That kneel, and do me service, cry me King:                 But I'le suppress him, he's a factious spirit,                 And will undo me: noble Sir, [your] hand, I am your                 servant.  _King_.    Away, I do not like this:                 I'le make you tamer, or I'le dispossess you                 Both of life and spirit: For this time                 I pardon your wild speech, without so much                 As your imprisonment.                                  [_Ex_. King, Pha. _and_ Are.  _Di_.         I thank you Sir, you dare not for the people.  _Gal_.       Ladies, what think you now of this brave fellow?  _Meg_.     A pretty talking fellow, hot at hand; but eye yon                 stranger, is not he a fine compleat Gentleman? O these                 strangers, I do affect them strangely: they do the rarest                 home things, and please the fullest! as I live, could                 love all the Nation over and over for his sake.  _Gal_.      Pride comfort your poor head-piece Lady: 'tis a                 weak one, and had need of a Night-cap.  _Di_.        See how his fancy labours, has he not spoke                 Home, and bravely? what a dangerous train                 Did he give fire to! How he shook the King,                 Made his soul melt within him, and his blood                 Run into whay! it stood upon his brow,                 Like a cold winter dew.  _Phi_.      Gentlemen,                 You have no suit to me? I am no minion:                 You stand (methinks) like men that would be Courtiers,                 If you could well be fiatter'd at a price,                 Not to undo your Children: y'are all honest:                 Go get you home again, and make your Country                 A vertuous Court, to which your great ones may,                 In their Diseased age, retire, and live recluse.  _Cle_.      How do you worthy Sir?  _Phi_.      Well, very well;                 And so well, that if the King please, I find                 I may live many years.  _Di_.        The King must please,                 Whilst we know what you are, and who you are,                 Your wrongs and [injuries]: shrink not, worthy Sir,                 But add your Father to you: in whose name,                 We'll waken all the gods, and conjure up                 The rods of vengeance, the abused people,                 Who like to raging torrents shall swell high,       "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10850"],["title","Philaster; Or, Love Lies a Bleeding (#2)"],["body","          And so begirt the dens of these Male-dragons,                 That through the strongest safety, they shall beg                 For mercy at your swords point.  _Phi_.       Friends, no more,                 Our years may he corrupted: 'Tis an age                 We dare not trust our wills to: do you love me?  _Thra_.     Do we love Heaven and honour?  _Phi_.       My Lord _Dion_, you had                 A vertuous Gentlewoman call'd you Father;                 Is she yet alive?  _Di_.        Most honour'd Sir, she is:                 And for the penance but of an idle dream,                 Has undertook a tedious Pilgrimage.                                                    [ _Enter a_ Lady.  _Phi_.       Is it to me, or any of these Gentlemen you come?  _La_.        To you, brave Lord; the Princess would intreat                 Your present company.  _Phi_.       The Princess send for me! y'are mistaken.  _La_.         If you be call'd _Philaster_, 'tis to you.  _Phi_.       Kiss her hand, and say I will attend her.  _Di_.         Do you know what you do?  _Phi_.        Yes, go to see a woman.  _Cle_.        But do you weigh the danger you are in?  _Phi_.        Danger in a sweet face?                  By _Jupiter_ I must not fear a woman.  _Thra_.     But are you sure it was the Princess sent?                 It may be some foul train to catch your life.  _Phi_.       I do not think it Gentlemen: she's noble,                 Her eye may shoot me dead, or those true red                 And white friends in her face may steal my soul out:                 There's all the danger in't: but be what may,                 Her single name hath arm'd me.

Go on:                 And be as truly happy as thou art fearless:                 Come Gentlemen, let's make our friends acquainted,                 Lest the King prove false.                                                 [_Ex. Gentlemen_.     _Enter_ Arethusa _and a_ Lady.  _Are_.       Comes he not?  _La_.        Madam?  _Are_.      Will _Philaster_ come?  _La_.        Dear Madam, you were wont                 To credit me at first.  _Are_.      But didst thou tell me so?                 I am forgetful, and my womans strength                 Is so o'recharg'd with danger like to grow                 About my Marriage that these under-things                 Dare not abide in such a troubled sea:                 How look't he, when he told thee he would come?  _La_.        Why, well.  _Are_.      And not a little fearful?  _La_.        Fear Madam? sure he knows not what it is.  _Are_.      You are all of his Faction; the whole Court                 Is bold in praise of him, whilst I                 May live neglected: and do noble things,                 As fools in strife throw gold into the Sea,                 Drown'd in the doing: but I know he fears.  _La_.        Fear? Madam (me thought) his looks hid more                 Of love than fear.  _Are_.      Of love? To whom? to you?                 Did you deliver those plain words I sent,                 With such a winning gesture, and quick look                 That you have caught him?  _La_.        Madam, I mean to you.  _Are_.      Of love to me? Alas! thy ignorance                 Lets thee not see the crosses of our births:                 Nature, that loves not to be questioned                 Why she did this, or that, but has her ends,                 And knows she does well; never gave the world                 Two things so opposite, so contrary,                 As he and I am: If a bowl of blood                 Drawn from this arm of mine, would poyson thee,                 A draught of his would cure thee. Of love to me?  _La_.        Madam, I think I hear him.  _Are_.       Bring him in:                 You gods that would not have your dooms withstood,                 Whose holy wisdoms at this time it is,                 To make the passion of a feeble maid                 The way unto your justice, I obey.                                                         [ _Enter_ Phil.  _La_.       Here is my Lord _Philaster_.  _Are_.     Oh! 'tis well:                 Withdraw your self.  _Phi_.       Madam, your messenger                 Made me believe, you wisht to speak with me.  _Are_.       'Tis true _Philaster,_ but the words are such,                 I have to say, and do so ill beseem                 The mouth of woman, that I wish them said,                 And yet am loth to speak them. Have you known                 That I have ought detracted from your worth?                 Have I in person wrong'd you? or have set                 My baser instruments to throw disgrace                 Upon your vertues?  _Phi_.       Never Madam you.  _Are_.       Why then should you in such a publick place,                 Injure a Princess and a scandal lay                 Upon my fortunes, fam'd to be so great:                 Calling a great part of my dowry in question.  _Phi_.      Madam, this truth which I shall speak, will be                 Foolish: but for your fair and vertuous self,                 I could afford my self to have no right                 To any thing you wish'd.  _Are.        Philaster,_ know                 I must enjoy these Kingdoms.  _Phi_.      Madam, both?  _Are_.      Both or I die: by Fate I die _Philaster,_                 If I not calmly may enjoy them both.  _Phi_.       I would do much to save that Noble life:                 Yet would be loth to have posterity                 Find in our stories, that _Philaster_ gave                 His right unto a Scepter, and a Crown,                 To save a Ladies longing.  _Are_.      Nay then hear:                 I must, and will have them, and more.  _Phi_.      What more?  _Are_.      Or lose that little life the gods prepared,                 To trouble this poor piece of earth withall.  _Phi_.      Madam, what more?  _Are_.      Turn then away thy face.  _Phi_.      No.  _Are_.      Do.  _Phi_.       I cannot endure it: turn away my face?                 I never yet saw enemy that lookt                 So dreadful, but that I thought my self                 As great a Basilisk as he; or spake                 So horribly, but that I thought my tongue                 Bore Thunder underneath, as much as his:                 Nor beast that I could turn from: shall I then                 Begin to fear sweet sounds? a Ladies voice,                 Whom I do love? Say you would have my life,                 Why, I will give it you; for it is of me                 A thing so loath'd, and unto you that ask                 Of so poor use, that I shall make no price                 If you intreat, I will unmov'dly hear.  _Are_.      Yet for my sake a little bend thy looks.  _Phi_.      I do.  _Are_.      Then know I must have them and thee.  _Phi_.      And me?                  _Are_. Thy love: without which, all the Land                 Discovered yet, will serve me for no use,                 But to be buried in.  _Phi_.       Is't possible?  _Are_.       With it, it were too little to bestow                 On thee: Now, though thy breath doth strike me dead                 (Which know it may) I have unript my breast.  _Phi_.       Madam, you are too full of noble thoughts,                 To lay a train for this contemned life,                 Which you may have for asking: to suspect                 Were base, where I deserve no ill: love you!                 By all my hopes I do, above my life:                 But how this passion should proceed from you                 So violently, would amaze a man, that would be jealous.  _Are_.      Another soul into my body shot,                 Could not have fill'd me with more strength and spirit,                 Than this thy breath: but spend not hasty time,                 In seeking how I came thus: 'tis the gods,                 The gods, that make me so; and sure our love                 Will be the nobler, and the better blest,                 In that the secret justice of the gods                 Is mingled with it.  Let us leave and kiss,                 Lest some unwelcome guest should fall betwixt us,                 And we should part without it.                 _Phi_. 'Twill be ill                 I should abide here long.  _Are_.       'Tis true, and worse                 You should come often: How shall we devise                 To hold intelligence? That our true lovers,                 On any new occasion may agree, what path is best to                 tread?  _Phi_.       I have a boy sent by the gods, I hope to this intent,                 Not yet seen in the Court; hunting the Buck,                 I found him sitting by a Fountain side,                 Of which he borrow'd some to quench his thirst,                 And paid the Nymph again as much in tears;                 A Garland lay him by, made by himself,                 Of many several flowers, bred in the bay,                 Stuck in that mystick order, that the rareness                 Delighted me: but ever when he turned                 His tender eyes upon 'um, he would weep,                 As if he meant to make 'um grow again.                 Seeing such pretty helpless innocence                 Dwell in his face, I ask'd him all his story;                 He told me that his Parents gentle dyed,                 Leaving him to the mercy of the fields,                 Which gave him roots; and of the Crystal springs,                 Which did not stop their courses: and the Sun,                 Which still, he thank'd him, yielded him his light,                 Then took he up his Garland and did shew,                 What every flower as Country people hold,                 Did signifie: and how all ordered thus,                 Exprest his grief: and to my thoughts did read                 The"]]]
