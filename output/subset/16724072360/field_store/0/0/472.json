Bring some hot meat for Captain Cartwright, and more vegetables.  Try some of this salad, Cartwright---it's good.\"  Instantly the officers, looking eagerly on, turned their glances away and began general conversation again, for they were quick to see that Dick's usual tact was at least postponing a quarrel.  \"It will be a hot afternoon for drill, won't it?\" Dick asked, in the next breath, and in a low tone.  \"Maybe,\" grunted Cartwright.  \"But perhaps I shall find still hotter work before the drill-call sounds.\"  \"Nonsense!\" said Dick quickly.  \"After the K.O.'s talk this morning, don't start anything that will take our mind off our work.\"  \"I've got to have a bit more than an explanation from Holmes,\" the sulky captain continued, though in a low voice.  \"Cartwright,\" said Dick, in an authoritative undertone, \"I don't want you to start anything in that direction until you've had a good talk with me!\"  There the matter ended for the moment.  Dick joined in the general conversation.  Presently Cartwright tried to, but the officers to whom he addressed his remarks replied either so briefly or so coolly that the captain realized that he was not popular at the present time.  \"Holmes will make trouble for any one who doesn't toady to him,\" thought Captain Cartwright moodily.  \"I can see that I've got to make it my business to take the conceit and arrogance out of him.\"  At almost the same moment, over in a company barracks, Sergeant Mock, as he chewed his food gloomily, was reflecting:  \"So Captain Holmes will call me down before a lot of officers, will he?  He'll order me to show more 'pep,' will he, the slave-driver?  And if I don't he'll break me, eh?\"  \"Breaking\" a non-commissioned officer is securing his reduction to the grade of private.  \"The captain is so lazy himself that he doesn't know a good man when he sees one,\" Mock told himself angrily.  Then he added, threateningly to himself:  \"He'd better not try it.  If he does, he'll sure wish he hadn't. Since this war began even the officers are only on probation, and I've brains enough to find a way to put him in bad with the regimental K.O.\"  \"What's the matter, Mock, don't you like your food?\" asked the sergeant seated at his left.  \"You're scowling something fierce.\"  \"It isn't the chow,\" Sergeant Mock retorted gruffly.  \"Must be the heat, then---or a call-down,\" observed his brother sergeant.  \"Never you mind!\" retorted Mock.  \"And I'm not talking much now; I want to think.\"  \"Must have been a real 'cussing-out' that you got,\" grinned the other sergeant unconcernedly.  Bending over a passing soldier murmured to Mock:  \"Top wants to see you in the company office when you're through eating.\"  The first sergeant of a company is also known, in Army parlance, as the \"top sergeant\" or the \"top cutter.\"  Though he dawdled with his meal Mock did not eat much more.  Finally he rose, stalking sulkily from the mess-room and across the central corridor.  Thrusting out a hand he turned the knob of the door of the company office and almost flung the door open, stepping haughtily inside.  \"Mock,\" said First Sergeant Lund, looking up, \"you're too old in the service to enter in that fashion.  You know, as well as I do, that there is a 'knock' sign painted on the door, and that only an officer is privileged to enter without knocking.  Suppose the captain had been in here when you flung in in that fashion?\"  \"He's no better than any one else!\" retorted Mock.  Facing about in his chair Sergeant Lund briefly rested one hand on his desk, then sprang to his feet.  \"Attention!\" he commanded sharply.  Mock obeyed, throwing his head up, his chest out and squaring his shoulders as he dropped his hands straight along either trousers seam, though he sneered:  \"Putting on officer's airs, are you, Lund?\"  \"No; I appear to be talking to a rookie (recruit) who happens to be wearing a sergeant chevrons,\" retorted the top sternly. \"Sergeant Mock, in this office, or anywhere in my presence, you will refrain from making disrespectful remarks about your officers And I'd advise you to adopt that as your standard at all times and in all places.  Do you get that?\"  \"I hear you,\" Mock rejoined, standing at ease again.  \"You wanted to see me?\"  \"Yes.  Shortly before recall sounded I looked out of the window and noticed that you were handling the second platoon in anything but a soldierly manner.  I was about to come out and speak to you when I observed the captain call you to him.  He corrected your method of handling the platoon, didn't he?\"  \"He thought he did,\" Sergeant Mock responded, his lips quivering \"But the tone he took, or rather the words he said to me, aren't the kind that make better soldiers of non-coms.\"  \"So?\" demanded Sergeant Lund, looking sharply into his subordinate's eyes.  \"No!\" Mock snapped sullenly.  \"When an officer wants me to do my best be's got to treat me like the gentleman that he's supposed to be.\"  For twenty seconds Sergeant Lund continued his staring at Mock. Then he rested a hand heavily on the other's shoulder as he said:  \"Sergeant Mock, this is a man's army, training to do a nation's share in the biggest war in history.  None but a man can do a man's work, and nothing but an army of real men can do the nation's work.  If you fit yourself into your place, work hard enough and forget all about yourself except your oath to serve the Flag and obey your officers, I believe that you can do a real man's work. If you do anything different from that I'll knock your block off without a second word on the subject.\"  A hotly angry reply leaped to Sergeant Mock's lips, but he was wise enough to choke it back.  For Sergeant Lund, a real man, a real soldier and a loyal American, stood before him regarding him with a look in which there was no faltering nor any doubt as to his intentions.  \"That's all, Sergeant Mock,\" said the top, an instant later. \"I'm going to keep an eye on you, and I want to be able to say a word of praise to you this evening.\"  \"Two of a kind---the top and the company commander,\" Mock growled under his breath as he went up the stairs to a squad room above.     CHAPTER II  GREG HAS TO BE STERN   A full minute before the bugler sounded the call Captain Dick Prescott was on hand, standing in the shadow of the end of the barracks of his company.  Among other reasons he was there to note the alacrity with which his men came out of the building.  Before the notes of the call had died away most of the men of his company were on hand, his lieutenants among the first.  Within saving time all the rest had appeared, except those who had been excused for one reason or another.  \"A company fall in!\" directed First Sergeant Kelly promptly.  As the men fell in in double rank there were a few cases of confusion, for some of the men were rookies who had joined only recently.  \"Sergeant Kelly, instruct the other sergeants to see to it that each man knows his exact place in company formation,\" Dick ordered.  \"Yes, sir,\" replied Kelly.  The corporals reported briskly the absentees, if any, in their squads.  The counting of fours sounded next after inspection of arms.  \"A little more snap in answering when fours are counted,\" Dick called, loudly enough for all the company to hear.  \"Let every man call his own number instantly and clearly.  For instance, when one man has called 'two' let the man at his left call 'three' without a second's delay.  In the way of good soldiering this is more important than most of you new men realize.  Lieutenant Terry!\"  \"Sir,\" the first lieutenant responded, stepping forward, saluting.  \"Take the company.  Drill in dressings, facings, the manual of arms, wheeling and marching by twos and fours.\"  Then, stepping to one side, Prescott let his gaze rove over the company, from one file or rank to another.  Everything that was done badly he noted.  Presently, when the men were standing at ease he related his observations to Lieutenant Noll Terry, who thereupon gave the company further instruction.  Finally, when the company started across the drill ground in column of fours, Dick walked briskly into the barracks building, going to the company office, whither Sergeant Kelly had preceded him. Kelly, and a corporal and private who were there on clerical duty, rose and stood at attention as the captain entered.  \"Rest,\" Dick commanded briefly, whereupon the corporal and the private returned to the desk at which they were working, while Dick crossed to the sergeant's desk.  Seating himself there he gave close attention to the papers that Sergeant Kelly handed him.  Such as required signature Captain Prescott signed.  Then, for fifteen minutes, he busied himself with requisitions for clothing and equipment.  After that other papers required close attention. Following that several matters of company administration had to be taken up.  Finally, Sergeant Kelly handed Dick a list on which names had been written.  \"These seven men have applied for pass from retreat this afternoon until reveille tomorrow morning,\" reported Dick's top.  \"I have approved them, subject to your action.\"  Reading quickly through the names, Prescott replied:  \"Give six of them pass, but refuse it to Private Hartley.  This forenoon I observed that he saluted officers very indifferently when passing them, and once Hartley had to be spoken to by an officer whom he did not see in time to salute him.  In whose squad is Hartley?\"  \"In Corporal Aspen's, sir.\"  \"Then direct Corporal Aspen to take Hartley aside, at any time suited to the corporal's convenience this evening.  Have the corporal drill Private Hartley at least twenty minutes in saluting, with, of course, proper intervals for arm rest.\"  \"Yes, sir.  May I offer the captain a suggestion?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Aspen will be corporal in charge of quarters to-night.  Hartley is sometimes a very slovenly soldier,\" Kelly reported.  \"May I"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12816"],["title","The Devil's Pool (#1)"],["body","I think of terrifying tales.  I allowed myself to be drawn into this digression apropos of a ploughman. It is the story of a ploughman that I set out to tell you, and will tell you forthwith.     II  THE PLOUGHING   I had been gazing for a long time and with profound sadness at Holbein's ploughman, and I was walking in the fields, musing upon country-life and the destiny of the husbandman. Doubtless it is a depressing thing to consume one's strength and one's life driving the plough through the bosom of the jealous earth, which yields the treasures of its fecundity only under duress, when a bit of the blackest and coarsest bread at the end of the day is the only reward and the only profit of such laborious toil. The wealth that covers the ground, the crops, the fruit, the proud cattle fattening on the long grass, are the property of a few, and the instruments of fatigue and slavery of the majority. As a general rule, the man of leisure does not love, for themselves, the fields, or the meadows, or the spectacle of nature, or the superb beasts that are to be converted into gold pieces for his use. The man of leisure comes to the country in search of a little air and health, then returns to the city to spend the fruit of his vassal's toil.  The man of toil, for his part, is too crushed, too wretched, and too frightened concerning the future, to enjoy the beauties of the landscape and the charms of rustic life. To him also the golden fields, the lovely meadows, the noble animals, represent bags of crowns, of which he will have only a paltry share, insufficient for his needs, and yet those cursed bags must be filled every year to satisfy the master and pay for the privilege of living sparingly and wretchedly on his domain.  And still nature is always young and beautiful and generous. She sheds poetry and beauty upon all living things, upon all the plants that are left to develop in their own way. Nature possesses the secret of happiness, and no one has ever succeeded in wresting it from her. He would be the most fortunate of men who, possessing the science of his craft and working with his hands, deriving happiness and liberty from the exercise of his intelligent strength, should have time to live in the heart and the brain, to understand his work, and to love the work of God. The artist has enjoyment of that sort in contemplating and reproducing the beauties of Nature; but, when he sees the suffering of the men who people this paradise called the earth, the just, kind-hearted artist is grieved in the midst of his enjoyment. Where the mind, heart, and arms work in concert under the eye of Providence, true happiness would be found, and a holy harmony would exist between the munificence of God and the delights of the human soul. Then, instead of piteous, ghastly Death walking in his furrow, whip in hand, the painter of allegories could place beside the ploughman a radiant angel, sowing the blessed grain in the smoking furrows with generous hand.  And the dream of a peaceful, free, poetical, laborious, simple existence for the husbandman is not so difficult of conception that it need be relegated to a place among chimeras. The gentle, melancholy words of Virgil: \"O how happy the life of the husbandman, if he but knew his happiness!\" is an expression of regret; but, like all regrets, it is also a prediction. A day will come when the ploughman may be an artist, if not to express,--which will then matter but little, perhaps,--at all events, to feel, the beautiful. Do you believe that this mysterious intuition of poesy does not already exist within him in the state of instinct and vague revery? In those who have a little hoard for their protection to-day, and in whom excess of misery does not stifle all moral and intellectual development, pure happiness, felt and appreciated, is at the elementary stage; and, furthermore, if poets' voices have already arisen from the bosom of sorrow and fatigue, why should it be said that the work of the hands excludes the exercise of the functions of the mind? That exclusion is probably the general result of excessive toil and profound misery; but let it not be said that when man shall work only moderately and profitably, then there will be none but bad workmen and bad poets. He who derives noble enjoyment from the inward sentiment of poesy is a true poet, though he has never written a line in his life.  My thoughts had taken this course, and I did not notice that this confidence in man's capacity for education was strengthened in my mind by external influences. I was walking along the edge of a field which the peasants were preparing for the approaching sowing. The field was an extensive one, like that in Holbein's picture. The landscape, too, was of great extent and framed in broad lines of verdure, slightly reddened by the approach of autumn, the lusty brown earth, where recent rains had left in some of the furrows lines of water which sparkled in the sun like slender silver threads. It was a blight, warm day, and the ground, freshly opened by the sharp ploughshares, exhaled a slight vapor. At the upper end of the field, an old man, whose broad back and stern face recalled the man in Holbein's picture, but whose clothing did not indicate poverty, gravely drove his old-fashioned _areau_, drawn by two placid oxen, with pale yellow hides, veritable patriarchs of the fields, tall, rather thin, with long, blunt horns, hard-working old beasts whom long companionship has made _brothers_, as they are called in our country districts, and who, when they are separated, refuse to work with new mates and die of grief. People who know nothing of the country call this alleged friendship of the ox for his yoke-fellow fabulous. Let them go to the stable and look at a poor, thin, emaciated animal, lashing his sunken sides with his restless tail, sniffing with terror and contempt at the fodder that is put before him, his eyes always turned toward the door, pawing the empty place beside him, smelling the yoke and chains his companion wore, and calling him incessantly with a pitiful bellow. The driver will say: \"There's a yoke of oxen lost; his brother's dead, and he won't work. We ought to fatten him for killing; but he won't eat, and he'll soon starve to death.\"  The old ploughman was working slowly, in silence, without useless expenditure of strength. His docile team seemed in no greater hurry than he; but as he kept constantly at work, never turning aside, and exerting always just the requisite amount of sustained power, his furrow was as quickly cut as his son's, who was driving four less powerful oxen on some harder and more stony land a short distance away.  But the spectacle that next attracted my attention was a fine one indeed, a noble subject for a painter. At the other end of the arable tract, a young man of attractive appearance was driving a superb team: four yoke of young beasts, black-coated with tawny spots that gleamed like fire, with the short, curly heads that suggest the wild bull, the great, wild eyes, the abrupt movements, the nervous, jerky way of doing their work, which shows that the yoke and goad still irritate them and that they shiver with wrath as they yield to the domination newly imposed upon them. They were what are called oxen _freshly yoked_. The man who was guiding them had to clear a field until recently used for pasturage, and filled with venerable stumps--an athlete's task which his energy, his youth, and his eight almost untamed beasts were hardly sufficient to accomplish.  A child of six or seven years, as beautiful as an angel, with a lamb's fleece covering his shoulders, over his blouse, so that he resembled the little Saint John the Baptist of the painters of the Renaissance, was trudging along in the furrow beside the plough and pricking the sides of the oxen with a long, light stick, the end of which was armed with a dull goad. The proud beasts quivered under the child's small hand, and made the yokes and the straps about their foreheads groan, jerking the plough violently forward. When the ploughshare struck a root, the driver shouted in a resonant voice, calling each beast by his name, but rather to soothe than to excite them; for the oxen, annoyed by the sudden resistance, started forward, digging their broad forked feet into the ground, and would have turned aside and dragged the plough across the field, had not the young man held the four leaders in check with voice and goad, while the child handled the other four. He, too, shouted, poor little fellow, in a voice which he tried to render terrible, but which remained as sweet as his angelic face. The whole picture was beautiful in strength and in grace: the landscape, the man, the child, the oxen under the yoke; and, despite the mighty struggle in which the earth was conquered, there was a feeling of peace and profound tranquillity hovering over everything. When the obstacle was surmounted and the team resumed its even, solemn progress, the ploughman, whose pretended violence was only to give his muscles a little practice and his vitality an outlet, suddenly resumed the serenity of simple souls and cast a contented glance upon his child, who turned to smile at him. Then the manly voice of the young _paterfamilias_ would strike up the solemn, melancholy tune which the ancient tradition of the province transmits, not to all ploughmen without distinction, but to those most expert in the art of arousing and sustaining the spirit of working-cattle. That song, whose origin was perhaps held sacred, and to which mysterious influences seem to have been attributed formerly, is reputed even to the present day to possess the virtue of keeping up the courage of those animals, of soothing their discontent, and of whiling away the tedium of their long task. It is not enough to have the art of driving them so as to cut the furrow in an absolutely straight line, to lighten their labor by raising the share or burying it "]]]
