Speed now, And by thy eloquent persuasive tongue, And by all means for his deliverance meet, Assist him. So to me will comfort spring. I who now bid thee on this errand forth Am Beatrice; from a place I come Revisited with joy. Love brought me thence, Who prompts my speech. When in my Master’s sight I stand, thy praise to him I oft will tell.”  (Note: Beatrice. I use this word, as it is pronounced in the Italian, as consisting of four syllables, of which the third is a long one.)   She then was silent, and I thus began: “O Lady! by whose influence alone, Mankind excels whatever is contain’d Within that heaven which hath the smallest orb, So thy command delights me, that to obey, If it were done already, would seem late. No need hast thou farther to speak thy will; Yet tell the reason, why thou art not loth To leave that ample space, where to return Thou burnest, for this centre here beneath.”  She then: “Since thou so deeply wouldst inquire, I will instruct thee briefly, why no dread Hinders my entrance here. Those things alone Are to be fear’d, whence evil may proceed, None else, for none are terrible beside. I am so fram’d by God, thanks to his grace! That any suff’rance of your misery Touches me not, nor flame of that fierce fire Assails me. In high heaven a blessed dame Besides, who mourns with such effectual grief That hindrance, which I send thee to remove, That God’s stern judgment to her will inclines. To Lucia calling, her she thus bespake: “Now doth thy faithful servant need thy aid And I commend him to thee.” At her word Sped Lucia, of all cruelty the foe, And coming to the place, where I abode Seated with Rachel, her of ancient days, She thus address’d me: “Thou true praise of God! Beatrice! why is not thy succour lent To him, who so much lov’d thee, as to leave For thy sake all the multitude admires? Dost thou not hear how pitiful his wail, Nor mark the death, which in the torrent flood, Swoln mightier than a sea, him struggling holds?” Ne’er among men did any with such speed Haste to their profit, flee from their annoy, As when these words were spoken, I came here, Down from my blessed seat, trusting the force Of thy pure eloquence, which thee, and all Who well have mark’d it, into honour brings.”  “When she had ended, her bright beaming eyes Tearful she turn’d aside; whereat I felt Redoubled zeal to serve thee. As she will’d, Thus am I come: I sav’d thee from the beast, Who thy near way across the goodly mount Prevented. What is this comes o’er thee then? Why, why dost thou hang back? why in thy breast Harbour vile fear? why hast not courage there And noble daring? Since three maids so blest Thy safety plan, e’en in the court of heaven; And so much certain good my words forebode.”  As florets, by the frosty air of night Bent down and clos’d, when day has blanch’d their leaves, Rise all unfolded on their spiry stems; So was my fainting vigour new restor’d, And to my heart such kindly courage ran, That I as one undaunted soon replied: “O full of pity she, who undertook My succour! and thou kind who didst perform So soon her true behest! With such desire Thou hast dispos’d me to renew my voyage, That my first purpose fully is resum’d. Lead on: one only will is in us both. Thou art my guide, my master thou, and lord.”  So spake I; and when he had onward mov’d, I enter’d on the deep and woody way.     CANTO III   “Through me you pass into the city of woe: Through me you pass into eternal pain: Through me among the people lost for aye. Justice the founder of my fabric mov’d: To rear me was the task of power divine, Supremest wisdom, and primeval love. Before me things create were none, save things Eternal, and eternal I endure. All hope abandon ye who enter here.”  Such characters in colour dim I mark’d Over a portal’s lofty arch inscrib’d: Whereat I thus: “Master, these words import Hard meaning.” He as one prepar’d replied: “Here thou must all distrust behind thee leave; Here be vile fear extinguish’d. We are come Where I have told thee we shall see the souls To misery doom’d, who intellectual good Have lost.” And when his hand he had stretch’d forth To mine, with pleasant looks, whence I was cheer’d, Into that secret place he led me on.  Here sighs with lamentations and loud moans Resounded through the air pierc’d by no star, That e’en I wept at entering. Various tongues, Horrible languages, outcries of woe, Accents of anger, voices deep and hoarse, With hands together smote that swell’d the sounds, Made up a tumult, that for ever whirls Round through that air with solid darkness stain’d, Like to the sand that in the whirlwind flies.  I then, with error yet encompass’d, cried: “O master! What is this I hear? What race Are these, who seem so overcome with woe?”  He thus to me: “This miserable fate Suffer the wretched souls of those, who liv’d Without or praise or blame, with that ill band Of angels mix’d, who nor rebellious prov’d Nor yet were true to God, but for themselves Were only. From his bounds Heaven drove them forth, Not to impair his lustre, nor the depth Of Hell receives them, lest th’ accursed tribe Should glory thence with exultation vain.”  I then: “Master! what doth aggrieve them thus, That they lament so loud?” He straight replied: “That will I tell thee briefly. These of death No hope may entertain: and their blind life So meanly passes, that all other lots They envy. Fame of them the world hath none, Nor suffers; mercy and justice scorn them both. Speak not of them, but look, and pass them by.”  And I, who straightway look’d, beheld a flag, Which whirling ran around so rapidly, That it no pause obtain’d: and following came Such a long train of spirits, I should ne’er Have thought, that death so many had despoil’d.  When some of these I recogniz’d, I saw And knew the shade of him, who to base fear Yielding, abjur’d his high estate. Forthwith I understood for certain this the tribe Of those ill spirits both to God displeasing And to his foes. These wretches, who ne’er lived, Went on in nakedness, and sorely stung By wasps and hornets, which bedew’d their cheeks With blood, that mix’d with tears dropp’d to their feet, And by disgustful worms was gather’d there.  Then looking farther onwards I beheld A throng upon the shore of a great stream: Whereat I thus: “Sir! grant me now to know Whom here we view, and whence impell’d they seem So eager to pass o’er, as I discern Through the blear light?” He thus to me in few: “This shalt thou know, soon as our steps arrive Beside the woeful tide of Acheron.”  Then with eyes downward cast and fill’d with shame, Fearing my words offensive to his ear, Till we had reach’d the river, I from speech Abstain’d. And lo! toward us in a bark Comes on an old man hoary white with eld, Crying, “Woe to you wicked spirits! hope not Ever to see the sky again. I come To take you to the other shore across, Into eternal darkness, there to dwell In fierce heat and in ice. And thou, who there Standest, live spirit! get thee hence, and leave These who are dead.” But soon as he beheld I left them not, “By other way,” said he, “By other haven shalt thou come to shore, Not by this passage; thee a nimbler boat Must carry.” Then to him thus spake my guide: “Charon! thyself torment not: so ’tis will’d, Where will and power are one: ask thou no more.”  Straightway in silence fell the shaggy cheeks Of him the boatman o’er the livid lake, Around whose eyes glar’d wheeling flames. Meanwhile Those spirits, faint and naked, color chang’d, And gnash’d their teeth, soon as the cruel words They heard. God and their parents they blasphem’d, The human kind, the place, the time, and seed That did engender them and give them birth.  Then all together sorely wailing drew To the curs’d strand, that every man must pass Who fears not God. Charon, demoniac form, With eyes of burning coal, collects them all, Beck’ning, and each, that lingers, with his oar Strikes. As fall off the light autumnal leaves, One still another following, till the bough Strews all its honours on the earth beneath; E’en in like manner Adam’s evil brood Cast themselves one by one down from the shore, Each at a beck, as falcon at his call.  Thus go they over through the umber’d wave, And ever they on the opposing bank Be landed, on this side another throng Still gathers. “Son,” thus spake the courteous guide, “Those, who die subject to the wrath of God, All here together come from every clime, And to o’erpass the river are not loth: For so heaven’s justice goads them on, that fear Is turn’d into desire. Hence ne’er hath past Good spirit. If of thee Charon complain, Now mayst thou know the import of his words.”  This said, the gloomy region trembling shook So terribly, that yet with clammy dews Fear chills my brow. The sad earth gave a blast, That, lightening, shot forth a vermilion flame, Which all my senses conquer’d quite, and I Down dropp’d, as one with sudden slumber seiz’d.     CANTO IV   Broke the deep slumber in my brain a crash Of heavy thunder, that I shook myself, As one by main force rous’d. Risen upright, My rested eyes I mov’d around, and search’d With fixed ken to know what place it was, Wherein I stood. For certain on the brink I found me of the lamentable vale, The dread abyss, that joins a thund’rous sound Of plaints innumerable. Dark and deep, And thick with clouds o’erspread, mine eye in vain Explor’d its bottom, nor could aught discern.  “Now let us to the blind world there beneath Descend;” the bard began all pale of look: “I go the first, and thou shalt follow next.”  Then I his alter’d hue perceiving, thus: “How may I speed, if thou yieldest to dread, Who still art wont to comfort me in doubt?”  He then: “The anguish of that race below With pity stains my cheek, which thou for fear Mistakest. Let us on. Our length of way Urges to haste.” Onward, this said, he mov’d; And ent’ring led me with him on the bounds Of the first circle, that surrounds th’ abyss. Here, as mine ear could note,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1008"],["title","Divine Comedy, Cary's Translation, Complete (#2)"],["body"," no plaint was heard Except of sighs, that made th’ eternal air Tremble, not caus’d by tortures, but from grief Felt by those multitudes, many and vast, Of men, women, and infants. Then to me The gentle guide: “Inquir’st thou not what spirits Are these, which thou beholdest? Ere thou pass Farther, I would thou know, that these of sin Were blameless; and if aught they merited, It profits not, since baptism was not theirs, The portal to thy faith. If they before The Gospel liv’d, they serv’d not God aright; And among such am I. For these defects, And for no other evil, we are lost; Only so far afflicted, that we live Desiring without hope.” So grief assail’d My heart at hearing this, for well I knew Suspended in that Limbo many a soul Of mighty worth. “O tell me, sire rever’d! Tell me, my master!” I began through wish Of full assurance in that holy faith, Which vanquishes all error; “say, did e’er Any, or through his own or other’s merit, Come forth from thence, whom afterward was blest?”  Piercing the secret purport of my speech, He answer’d: “I was new to that estate, When I beheld a puissant one arrive Amongst us, with victorious trophy crown’d. He forth the shade of our first parent drew, Abel his child, and Noah righteous man, Of Moses lawgiver for faith approv’d, Of patriarch Abraham, and David king, Israel with his sire and with his sons, Nor without Rachel whom so hard he won, And others many more, whom he to bliss Exalted. Before these, be thou assur’d, No spirit of human kind was ever sav’d.”  We, while he spake, ceas’d not our onward road, Still passing through the wood; for so I name Those spirits thick beset. We were not far On this side from the summit, when I kenn’d A flame, that o’er the darken’d hemisphere Prevailing shin’d. Yet we a little space Were distant, not so far but I in part Discover’d, that a tribe in honour high That place possess’d. “O thou, who every art And science valu’st! who are these, that boast Such honour, separate from all the rest?”  He answer’d: “The renown of their great names That echoes through your world above, acquires Favour in heaven, which holds them thus advanc’d.” Meantime a voice I heard: “Honour the bard Sublime! his shade returns that left us late!” No sooner ceas’d the sound, than I beheld Four mighty spirits toward us bend their steps, Of semblance neither sorrowful nor glad.  When thus my master kind began: “Mark him, Who in his right hand bears that falchion keen, The other three preceding, as their lord. This is that Homer, of all bards supreme: Flaccus the next in satire’s vein excelling; The third is Naso; Lucan is the last. Because they all that appellation own, With which the voice singly accosted me, Honouring they greet me thus, and well they judge.”  So I beheld united the bright school Of him the monarch of sublimest song, That o’er the others like an eagle soars. When they together short discourse had held, They turn’d to me, with salutation kind Beck’ning me; at the which my master smil’d: Nor was this all; but greater honour still They gave me, for they made me of their tribe; And I was sixth amid so learn’d a band.  Far as the luminous beacon on we pass’d Speaking of matters, then befitting well To speak, now fitter left untold. At foot Of a magnificent castle we arriv’d, Seven times with lofty walls begirt, and round Defended by a pleasant stream. O’er this As o’er dry land we pass’d. Next through seven gates I with those sages enter’d, and we came Into a mead with lively verdure fresh.  There dwelt a race, who slow their eyes around Majestically mov’d, and in their port Bore eminent authority; they spake Seldom, but all their words were tuneful sweet.  We to one side retir’d, into a place Open and bright and lofty, whence each one Stood manifest to view. Incontinent There on the green enamel of the plain Were shown me the great spirits, by whose sight I am exalted in my own esteem.  Electra there I saw accompanied By many, among whom Hector I knew, Anchises’ pious son, and with hawk’s eye Caesar all arm’d, and by Camilla there Penthesilea. On the other side Old King Latinus, seated by his child Lavinia, and that Brutus I beheld, Who Tarquin chas’d, Lucretia, Cato’s wife Marcia, with Julia and Cornelia there; And sole apart retir’d, the Soldan fierce.  Then when a little more I rais’d my brow, I spied the master of the sapient throng, Seated amid the philosophic train. Him all admire, all pay him rev’rence due. There Socrates and Plato both I mark’d, Nearest to him in rank; Democritus, Who sets the world at chance, Diogenes, With Heraclitus, and Empedocles, And Anaxagoras, and Thales sage, Zeno, and Dioscorides well read In nature’s secret lore. Orpheus I mark’d And Linus, Tully and moral Seneca, Euclid and Ptolemy, Hippocrates, Galenus, Avicen, and him who made That commentary vast, Averroes.  Of all to speak at full were vain attempt; For my wide theme so urges, that ofttimes My words fall short of what bechanc’d. In two The six associates part. Another way My sage guide leads me, from that air serene, Into a climate ever vex’d with storms: And to a part I come where no light shines.     CANTO V   From the first circle I descended thus Down to the second, which, a lesser space Embracing, so much more of grief contains Provoking bitter moans. There, Minos stands Grinning with ghastly feature: he, of all Who enter, strict examining the crimes, Gives sentence, and dismisses them beneath, According as he foldeth him around: For when before him comes th’ ill fated soul, It all confesses; and that judge severe Of sins, considering what place in hell Suits the transgression, with his tail so oft Himself encircles, as degrees beneath He dooms it to descend. Before him stand Always a num’rous throng; and in his turn Each one to judgment passing, speaks, and hears His fate, thence downward to his dwelling hurl’d.  “O thou! who to this residence of woe Approachest?” when he saw me coming, cried Minos, relinquishing his dread employ, “Look how thou enter here; beware in whom Thou place thy trust; let not the entrance broad Deceive thee to thy harm.” To him my guide: “Wherefore exclaimest? Hinder not his way By destiny appointed; so ’tis will’d Where will and power are one. Ask thou no more.”  Now ’gin the rueful wailings to be heard. Now am I come where many a plaining voice Smites on mine ear. Into a place I came Where light was silent all. Bellowing there groan’d A noise as of a sea in tempest torn By warring winds. The stormy blast of hell With restless fury drives the spirits on Whirl’d round and dash’d amain with sore annoy. When they arrive before the ruinous sweep, There shrieks are heard, there lamentations, moans, And blasphemies ’gainst the good Power in heaven.  I understood that to this torment sad The carnal sinners are condemn’d, in whom Reason by lust is sway’d. As in large troops And multitudinous, when winter reigns, The starlings on their wings are borne abroad; So bears the tyrannous gust those evil souls. On this side and on that, above, below, It drives them: hope of rest to solace them Is none, nor e’en of milder pang. As cranes, Chanting their dol’rous notes, traverse the sky, Stretch’d out in long array: so I beheld Spirits, who came loud wailing, hurried on By their dire doom. Then I: “Instructor! who Are these, by the black air so scourg’d?”—” The first ’Mong those, of whom thou question’st,” he replied, “O’er many tongues was empress. She in vice Of luxury was so shameless, that she made Liking be lawful by promulg’d decree, To clear the blame she had herself incurr’d. This is Semiramis, of whom ’tis writ, That she succeeded Ninus her espous’d; And held the land, which now the Soldan rules. The next in amorous fury slew herself, And to Sicheus’ ashes broke her faith: Then follows Cleopatra, lustful queen.”  There mark’d I Helen, for whose sake so long The time was fraught with evil; there the great Achilles, who with love fought to the end. Paris I saw, and Tristan; and beside A thousand more he show’d me, and by name Pointed them out, whom love bereav’d of life.  When I had heard my sage instructor name Those dames and knights of antique days, o’erpower’d By pity, well-nigh in amaze my mind Was lost; and I began: “Bard! willingly I would address those two together coming, Which seem so light before the wind.” He thus: “Note thou, when nearer they to us approach. Then by that love which carries them along, Entreat; and they will come.” Soon as the wind Sway’d them toward us, I thus fram’d my speech: “O wearied spirits! come, and hold discourse With us, if by none else restrain’d.” As doves By fond desire invited, on wide wings And firm, to their sweet nest returning home, Cleave the air, wafted by their will along; Thus issu’d from that troop, where Dido ranks, They through the ill air speeding; with such force My cry prevail’d by strong affection urg’d.  “O gracious creature and benign! who go’st Visiting, through this element obscure, Us, who the world with bloody stain imbru’d; If for a friend the King of all we own’d, Our pray’r to him should for thy peace arise, Since thou hast pity on our evil plight. ()f whatsoe’er to hear or to discourse It pleases thee, that will we hear, of that Freely with thee discourse, while e’er the wind, As now, is mute. The land, that gave me birth, Is situate on the coast, where Po descends To rest in ocean with his sequent streams.  “Love, that in gentle heart is quickly learnt, Entangled him by that fair form, from me Ta’en in such cruel sort, as grieves me still: Love, that denial takes from none belov’d, Caught me with pleasing him so passing well, That, as thou see’st, he yet deserts me not. Love brought us to one death: Caina waits The soul, who spilt our life.” Such were their words; At hearing which downward I bent my looks, And held them there so long, that the bard cried: “What art thou pond’ring?” I in answer thus: “Alas! by what sweet thoughts, what fond desire Must they at"]]]
