Many brought their families with them, and they came with the evident intention of settling in California.  The arrival of these two parties presented to the Mexican Government a problem that required immediate solution. Already in anticipation of such an event it had been provided that nobody who had not obtained a legal passport should be permitted to remain in the country; and that even old settlers, unless naturalized, should be required to depart unless they procured official permission to remain. Naturally none of the new arrivals had received notice of this law, and they were in consequence unprovided with the proper passports. Legally they should have been forced at once to turn about and return by the way they came. Actually it would have been inhuman, if not impossible, to have forced them at that season of the year to attempt the mountains. General Vallejo, always broad-minded in his policies, used discretion in the matter and provided those in his district with temporary permits to remain. He required only a bond signed by other Americans who had been longer in the country.  Alvarado and Vallejo at once notified the Mexican Government of the arrival of these strangers, and both expressed fear that other and larger parties would follow. These fears were very soon realized. Succeeding expeditions settled in the State with the evident intention of remaining. No serious effort was made by the California authorities to keep them out. From time to time, to be sure, formal objection was raised and regulations were passed. However, as a matter of plain practicability, it was manifestly impossible to prevent parties from starting across the plains, or to inform the people living in the Eastern States of the regulations adopted by California. It must be remembered that communication at that time was extraordinarily slow and broken. It would have been cruel and unwarranted to drive away those who had already arrived. And even were such a course to be contemplated, a garrison would have been necessary at every mountain pass on the East and North, and at every crossing of the Colorado River, as well as at every port along the coast. The government in California had not men sufficient to handle its own few antique guns in its few coastwise forts, let alone a surplus for the purpose just described. And to cap all, provided the garrisons had been available and could have been placed, it would have been physically impossible to have supplied them with provisions for even a single month.  Truth to tell, the newcomers of this last class were not personally objectionable to the Californians. The Spanish considered them no different from those of their own blood. Had it not been for an uneasiness lest the enterprise of the American settlers should in time overcome Californian interests, had it not been for repeated orders from Mexico itself, and had it not been for reports that ten thousand Mormons had recently left Illinois for California, it is doubtful if much attention would have been paid to the first immigrants.  Westward migration at this time was given an added impetus by the Oregon question. The status of Oregon had long been in doubt. Both England and the United States were inclined to claim priority of occupation. The boundary between Canada and the United States had not yet been decided upon between the two countries. Though they had agreed upon the compromise of joint occupation of the disputed land, this arrangement did not meet with public approval. The land-hungry took a particular interest in the question and joined their voices with those of men actuated by more patriotic motives. In public meetings which were held throughout the country this joint occupation convention was explained and discussed, and its abrogation was demanded. These meetings helped to form the patriotic desire. Senator Tappan once said that thirty thousand settlers with their thirty thousand rifles in the valley of the Columbia would quickly settle all questions of title to the country. This saying was adopted as the slogan for a campaign in the West. It had the same inspiring effect as the later famous \"54-40 or fight.\" People were aroused as in the olden times they had been aroused to the crusades. It became a form of mental contagion to talk of, and finally to accomplish, the journey to the Northwest. Though no accurate records were kept, it is estimated that in 1843 over 800 people crossed to Willamette Valley. By 1845 this immigration had increased to fully 3000 within the year.  Because of these conditions the Oregon Trail had become a national highway. Starting at Independence, which is a suburb of the present Kansas City, it set out over the rolling prairie. At that time the wide plains were bright with wild flowers and teeming with game. Elk, antelope, wild turkeys, buffalo, deer, and a great variety of smaller creatures supplied sport and food in plenty. Wood and water were in every ravine; the abundant grass was sufficient to maintain the swarming hordes of wild animals and to give rich pasture to horses and oxen. The journey across these prairies, while long and hard, could rarely have been tedious. Tremendous thunderstorms succeeded the sultry heat of the West, an occasional cyclone added excitement; the cattle were apt to stampede senselessly; and, while the Indian had not yet developed the hostility that later made a journey across the plains so dangerous, nevertheless the possibilities of theft were always near enough at hand to keep the traveler alert and interested. Then there was the sandy country of the Platte River with its buffalo--buffalo by the hundreds of thousands, as far as the eye could reach--a marvelous sight: and beyond that again the Rockies, by way of Fort Laramie and South Pass.  Beyond Fort Hall the Oregon Trail and the trail for California divided. And at this point there began the terrible part of the journey--the arid, alkaline, thirsty desert, short of game, horrible in its monotony, deadly with its thirst. It is no wonder that, weakened by their sufferings in this inferno, so many of the immigrants looked upon the towering walls of the Sierras with a sinking of the heart.  While at first most of the influx of settlers was by way of Oregon, later the stories of the new country that made their way eastward induced travelers to go direct to California itself. The immigration, both from Oregon in the North and by the route over the Sierras, increased so rapidly that in 1845 there were probably about 700 Americans in the district. Those coming over the Sierras by the Carson Sink and Salt Lake trails arrived first of all at the fort built by Captain Sutter at the junction of the American and Sacramento rivers.  Captain Sutter was a man of Swiss parentage who had arrived in San Francisco in 1839 without much capital and with only the assets of considerable ability and great driving force. From the Governor he obtained grant of a large tract of land \"somewhere in the interior\" for the purposes of colonization. His colonists consisted of one German, four other white men, and eight Kanakas. The then Governor, Alvarado, thought this rather a small beginning, but advised him to take out naturalization papers and to select a location. Sutter set out on his somewhat vague quest with a four-oared boat and two small schooners, loaded with provisions, implements, ammunition, and three small cannon. Besides his original party he took an Indian boy and a dog, the latter proving by no means the least useful member of the company. He found at the junction of the American and Sacramento rivers the location that appealed to him, and there he established himself. His knack with the Indians soon enlisted their services. He seems to have been able to keep his agreements with them and at the same time to maintain rigid discipline and control.  Within an incredibly short time he had established a feudal barony at his fort. He owned eleven square leagues of land, four thousand two hundred cattle, two thousand horses, and about as many sheep. His trade in beaver skins was most profitable. He maintained a force of trappers who were always welcome at his fort, and whom he generously kept without cost to themselves. He taught the Indians blanket-weaving, hat-making, and other trades, and he even organized them into military companies. The fort which he built was enclosed on four sides and of imposing dimensions and convenience. It mounted twelve pieces of artillery, supported a regular garrison of forty in uniform, and contained within its walls a blacksmith shop, a distillery, a flour mill, a cannery, and space for other necessary industries. Outside the walls of the fort Captain Sutter raised wheat, oats, and barley in quantity, and even established an excellent fruit and vegetable garden.  Indeed, in every way Captain Sutter's environment and the results of his enterprises were in significant contrast to the inactivity and backwardness of his neighbors. He showed what an energetic man could accomplish with exactly the same human powers and material tools as had always been available to the Californians. Sutter himself was a rather short, thick-set man, exquisitely neat, of military bearing, carrying himself with what is called the true old-fashioned courtesy. He was a man of great generosity and of high spirit. His defect was an excess of ambition which in the end o'erleaped itself. There is no doubt that his first expectation was to found an independent state within the borders of California. His loyalty to the Americans was, however, never questioned, and the fact that his lands were gradually taken from him, and that he died finally in comparative poverty, is a striking comment on human injustice.  The important point for us at present is that Sutter's Fort happened to be exactly on the line of the overland immigration.

So the two young men passed in and enjoyed their first sample of southern cookery.  At this hour there were only a half dozen other people in the dining room--none of them interesting, Darrin decided, after hastily surveying the other diners.  The meal over, the two young candidates sauntered again out into the hotel office.  \"Any midshipmen out around the town, sir?\" Darrin asked.  \"Hardly, sir,\" replied the clerk, with a smile.  \"At this hour the young gentlemen are in their rooms at Bancroft Hall.\"  \"What does a midshipman look like?\" ventured Dalzell.  \"Like a human being, of course,\" Dave laughed.  \"You mean the uniform?\" inquired the clerk. \"A midshipman, sir, wears a dark blue uniform, like an officer's, and a visored cap, Naval pattern.  He also wears the anchor insignia on each side of his coat collar.\"  Dave and Dan soon walked over to the open doorway and stood looking out upon the street, in which, at this time, few people were passing. Hearing a step in the office, Dan quickly turned.  He saw a young man coming through the office, holding himself very erect. This young man was in dark blue uniform, with visored cap, and on each side of his collar was the anchor insignia.  Past the anchor were two bars, but Dalzell didn't notice that at the moment.  \"There's a real midshipman,\" whispered Dan, plucking at Dave's sleeve.  \"I'm going to speak to him.\"  \"Don't you do it,\" warned Dave, in an undertone.  \"You may make a mistake.\"  \"Mistake?\" echoed Dan.  \"With that anchor on his collar?\"  Hastily Dan Dalzell slipped back into the office, going up to the young man in uniform, who had stopped before the desk.  \"Good evening,\" began Dan politely.  \"I'd like to introduce myself. 'Tomorrow I expect to be one of the crowd.  You're a midshipman, aren't you?\"  \"I'm an officer of the Navy,\" replied the uniformed stranger coldly, as he half turned to glance briefly at Dalzell.  \"You are a candidate, I suppose?  Then I fancy you will report at the superintendent's office in the morning.\"  With that the Naval officer turned away, leaving poor Dalzell feeling decidedly dumfounded.  \"Wasn't that a midshipman?\" gasped Dan, in a whisper.  \"That gentleman is a lieutenant in the Navy,\" replied the clerk, with a slight smile.  Crestfallen Dan hurried back to Darrin, brushing off his sleeves with his hands as he walked.  \"Served you right; you must get over being fresh,\" Dave Darrin rebuked his chum.  \"But what is the matter with your sleeves?\"  \"I'm brushing the frost off of them,\" murmured Dan dejectedly. \"Did you notice the ice-bath that fellow threw over me?\"  \"Come out for a walk,\" urged Dave.  \"But be careful where you step and what you say to others.\"  The two young men strolled down the street.  \"Well,\" smiled Darrin, \"I must say, Dan, that you appear to be getting all over your nervousness.\"  \"No; I'm still nervous,\" protested Dan.  \"Before, I was afraid I wouldn't get into the Naval Academy.  Now, I'm only afraid that I shall.\"  \"What nonsense are you talking now?\" demanded Darrin, giving his chum a sharp look.  \"Why, if they're all going to be as chesty as that near-officer I spoke to in the hotel,\" blinked Dan, \"I'm not so sure that I want to go in with the bunch.\"  \"That officer wasn't either chesty or snobbish,\" rejoined Darrin.  \"Then you will kindly explain what he tried to do to me?\"  \"That's easy enough.  That Naval officer recognized in you a rather common type--the too-chummy and rather fresh American boy.  Down here in the service, where different grades in rank exist, it is necessary to keep the fresh greenhorn in his place.\"  \"Oh!\" muttered Dan, blinking hard.  \"As to your not wanting to go into the service,\" Dave continued, \"if you should fail, tomorrow, in your physical examination, you would be as blue as indigo, and have the blue-light signal up all the way back home.\"  \"I don't know but that is so.  Yes; I guess it is,\" Dalzell assented.  \"Now, there are at least ninety-nine chances in a hundred that you're going to pass the Navy doctors all right, Dan,\" his chum went on.  \"If you do, you'll be sworn into the Naval service as a midshipman.  Then you'll have to keep in mind that you're not an admiral, but only a midshipman--on probation, at that, as our instructions from the Navy Department inform us.  Now, as a new midshipman, you're only the smallest, greenest little boy in the whole service.  Just remember that, and drop all your jolly, all your freshness and all your patronizing ways.  Just listen and learn, Dan, and study, all the time, how to avoid being fresh. If you don't do this, I'm mighty confident that you're up against a hard and tough time, and that you'll have most of the other midshipmen down on you from the start.\"  \"Any more 'roast' for me?\" asked Dalzell plaintively.  \"No; for, if you need any more, you'll get it from other midshipmen, who don't know you as well as I do, and who won't make any allowances for your greenness and freshness.\"  \"My!\" murmured Dan enthusiastically.  \"Won't I quiver with glee the first time I see you being called for twelve-inch freshness!\"  Yet, despite their wordy encounters, the two remained, as always, the best and most loyal of friends.  For an hour and a half the two youngsters roamed about Annapolis, taking many interested looks at quaint old buildings that had stood since long before the Revolutionary War.  At last they turned back to the hotel, for, as Dalzell suggested, they needed a long night's sleep as a good preparation for going before the Naval surgeons on the next day.  Five minutes after they had turned out the gas Dave Darrin was soundly, blissfully asleep.  In another bed in the same room Dan Dalzell tossed for fully half an hour ere sleep caught his eyelids and pinned them down. In his slumber, however, Dan dreamed that he was confronting the superintendent of the Naval Academy and a group of officers, to whom he was expounding the fact that he was right and they were wrong.  What the argument was about Dan didn't see clearly, in his dream, but he had the satisfaction of making the superintendent and most of the Naval officers with him feel like a lot of justly-rebuked landsmen.     CHAPTER II  THE FIRST DAY AT THE NAVAL ACADEMY   A few minutes before nine o'clock, the next morning, Dave and Dan were strolling through Lover's Lane, not far from the administration building at the United States Naval Academy.  Their instructions bade them report at 9.15.  Dan was for going in at once and \"calling on\" the aide to the superintendent.  But this Dave vetoed, holding that the best thing for them to do was to stick to the very letter of their orders.  So, as they waited, the young men got a glimpse of the imposing piles of buildings that compose the newer Naval Academy.  Especially did handsome, big, white Bancroft Hall enchain their admiration.  This structure is one of the noblest in the country.  In it are the midshipmen's mess, the midshipmen's barracks for a thousand young men, numerous offices and a huge recreation hall.  \"That's a swell hotel where they're going to put us up for four years, isn't it?\" demanded Dan.  \"I fancy that we'll find it something more--or less--than a hotel, before we're through it,\" was Dave's prophetic reply.  As, at this time in the morning, all of the enrolled midshipmen were away at one form or another of drill or instruction, the central grounds were so empty of human life that the onlooker could form no idea of the immense, throbbing activity that was going on here among the hundreds of midshipmen on duty.  \"Here's some of our kind,\" spoke Dan, at last, as he espied more than a dozen young men, in citizen's dress, strolling along under the trees.  \"I guess they're candidates, fast enough,\" nodded Darrin, after briefly looking at the approaching group.  \"Cheap-looking lot, most of them, aren't they?\" asked Dalzell cheerfully.  \"Probably they're saying the same thing about us,\" chuckled Dave dryly.  \"Let 'em, then.  Who cares?\" muttered Dalzell.  \"Dan, my boy, I reckon you'll need to put the soft pedal on your critical tendencies,\" warned Dave.  \"And, if you want my friendly opinion, I've a big idea that you're going to talk your way into a lot of trouble here.\"  \"Trouble?\" grinned Dalzell.  \"Well, I'm used to it.\"  In truth Dan had been victor in many a hard-fought schoolboy disagreement, as readers of the High School Boys Series are aware.  As the young men in question drew nearer they eyed Darrin and Dalzell with a disapproval that was not wholly concealed.  The truth was that Dave and Dan were recognized as not being boys who had studied at one of the Naval prep. schools in Annapolis. The assumption was, therefore, that Dave and Dan had not been able to afford such a luxury.  \"Good morning, gentlemen,\" was Dave's pleasant greeting.  \"You are candidates, like ourselves, I take it?\"  This fact being acknowledged, Dave introduced himself and his friend, and soon some pleasant new acquaintances were being formed, for Darrin had a way that always made him popular with strangers.  \"Have you two got to go up before the June exams. here?\" asked one of the young men, who had introduced himself as Grigsby.  \"Part of it,\" grinned Dan.  \"We've already gone through the primer tests and the catechism, and that sort of thing; but we still have to go before the barber and the toilet specialists and see whether our personal appearance suits.\"  \"You're lucky, then,\" replied Grigsby.  \"Our crowd all have to take the academic exams.\"  \"Cheer up,\" begged Dan.  \"Any baby can go past the academic exams. Arithmetic is the hardest part.  One funny chap on the Civil Service Commission nearly got me by asking me how much two and two are, but Darrin saved me, just in the nick of time, by holding up five fingers; so I knew the answer right off.\"  Some of the candidates were already surveying Dan with a good deal of amusement."]]]
