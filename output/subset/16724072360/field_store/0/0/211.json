Good-bye, good-bye. God bless you!'  Then Eliza went out again into the dark night with her little boy in her arms, and Aunt Chloe shut the door softly behind her.     CHAPTER III   THE MORNING AFTER   Next morning, when it was discovered that Eliza had run away with her little boy, there was great excitement and confusion all over the house.  Mrs. Shelby was very glad. 'Thank God!' she said. 'I hope Eliza will get right away. I could not bear to think of Harry being sold to that cruel man.'  Mr. Shelby was angry. 'Haley knew I didn't want to sell the child,' he said. 'He will blame me for this.'  One person only was quite silent, and that was Aunt Chloe. She went on, making the breakfast as if she heard and saw nothing of the excitement round her.  All the little black boys belonging to the house thought it was fine fun. Very soon, about a dozen young imps were roosting, like so many crows, on the railings, waiting for Haley to come. They wanted to see how angry he would be, when he heard the news.  And he was dreadfully angry. The little nigger boys thought it was grand. They shouted and laughed and made faces at him to their hearts' content.  At last Haley became so angry, that Mr. Shelby offered to give him two men to help him to find Eliza.  But these two men, Sam and Andy, knew quite well that Mrs. Shelby did not want Eliza to be caught, so they put off as much time as they could.  They let loose their horses and Haley's too. Then they frightened and chased them, till they raced like mad things all over the great lawns which surrounded the house.  Whenever it seemed likely that a horse would be caught, Sam ran up, waving his hat and shouting wildly, 'Now for it! Cotch him! Cotch him!' This frightened the horses so much that they galloped off faster than before.  Haley rushed up and down, shouting and using dreadful, naughty words, and stamping with rage all the time.  At last, about twelve o'clock, Sam came riding up with Haley's horse. 'He's cotched,' he said, seemingly very proud of himself. 'I cotched him!'  Of course, now it was too late to start before dinner. Besides, the horses were so tired with all their running about, that they had to have a rest.  When at last they did start, Sam led them by a wrong road. So the sun was almost setting before they arrived at the village where Haley hoped to find Eliza.     CHAPTER IV   THE CHASE   When Eliza left Uncle Tom's cabin, she felt very sad and lonely. She knew she was leaving all the friends she had ever had behind her.  At first Harry was frightened. Soon he grew sleepy. 'Mother, I don't need to keep awake, do I?' he said.  'No, my darling, sleep, if you want to.'  'But, mother, if I do get asleep, you won't let the bad man take me?'  'No!'  'You're sure, an't you, mother?'  'Yes, sure.'  [Illustration]  Harry dropped his little weary head upon her shoulder, and was soon fast asleep.  Eliza walked on and on, never resting, all through the night. When the sun rose, she was many miles away from her old home. Still she walked on, only stopping, in the middle of the day, to buy a little dinner for herself and Harry at a farm-house.  At last, when it was nearly dark, she arrived at a village, on the banks of the river Ohio. If she could only get across that river, Eliza felt she would be safe.  She went to a little inn on the bank, where a kind-looking woman was busy cooking supper.  'Is there a boat that takes people across the river now?' she asked.  'No, indeed,' replied the woman. 'The boats has stopped running. It isn't safe, there be too many blocks of ice floating about.'  Eliza looked so sad and disappointed when she heard this, that the good woman was sorry for her. Harry too was so tired, that he began to cry.  [Illustration]  'Here, take him into this room,' said the woman, opening the door into a small bed-room.  Eliza laid her tired little boy upon the bed, and he soon fell fast asleep. But for her there was no rest. She stood at the window, watching the river with its great floating blocks of ice, wondering how she could cross it.  As she stood there she heard a shout. Looking up she saw Sam. She drew back just in time, for Haley and Andy were riding only a yard or two behind him.  It was a dreadful moment for Eliza. Her room opened by a side door to the river. She seized her child and sprang down the steps towards it.  Haley caught sight of her as she disappeared down the bank. Throwing himself from his horse, and calling loudly to Sam and Andy, he was after her in a moment.  In that terrible moment her feet scarcely seemed to touch the ground. The next, she was at the water's edge.  On they came behind her. With one wild cry and flying leap, she jumped right over the water by the shore, on to the raft of ice beyond. It was a desperate leap. Haley, Sam, and Andy cried out, and lifted up their hands in astonishment.  The great piece of ice pitched and creaked as her weight came upon it. But she stayed there not a moment. With wild cries she leaped to another and still another--stumbling--leaping--slipping--springing up again!  Her shoes were gone, her stockings cut from her feet by the sharp edges of the ice. Blood marked every step. But she knew nothing, felt nothing, till dimly, as in a dream, she saw the Ohio side, and a man helping her up the bank.  'Yer a brave gal, now, whoever ye are!' said the man.  'Oh, save me--do save me--do hide me,' she cried.  'Why, what's the matter?' asked the man.  'My child! this boy--mas'r sold him. There's his new mas'r,' she said, pointing to the other shore. 'Oh, save me.'  'Yer a right brave gal,' said the man. 'Go there,' pointing to a big white house close by. 'They are kind folks; they'll help you.'  'Oh, thank you, thank you,' said Eliza, as she walked quickly away. The man stood and looked after her wonderingly.  On the other side of the river Haley was standing perfectly amazed at the scene. When Eliza disappeared over the bank he turned and looked at Sam and Andy, with terrible anger in his eyes.  But Sam and Andy were glad, oh, so glad, that Eliza had escaped. They were so glad that they laughed till the tears rolled down their cheeks.  'I'll make ye laugh,' said Haley, laying about their heads with his riding whip.  They ducked their heads, ran shouting up the bank, and were on their horses before he could reach them.  'Good evening, mas'r,' said Sam. 'I berry much 'spect missis be anxious 'bout us. Mas'r Haley won't want us no longer.' Then off they went as fast as their horses could gallop.  It was late at night before they reached home again, but Mrs. Shelby was waiting for them. As soon as she heard the horses galloping up she ran out to the balcony.  'Is that you, Sam?' she called. 'Where are they?'  'Mas'r Haley's a-restin' at the tavern. He's drefful fatigued, missis.'  'And Eliza, Sam?'  'Come up here, Sam,' called Mr. Shelby, who had followed his wife, 'and tell your mistress what she wants to know.'  So Sam went up and told the wonderful story of how Eliza had crossed the river on the floating ice. Mr. and Mrs. Shelby found it hard to believe that such a thing was possible.  Mrs. Shelby was very, very glad that Eliza had escaped. She told Aunt Chloe to give Sam and Andy a specially good supper. Then they went to bed quite pleased with their day's work.     CHAPTER V   ELIZA FINDS A REFUGE   A lady and gentleman were sitting talking happily together in the drawing-room of the white house to which Eliza had gone. Suddenly their old black man-of-all-work put his head in at the door and said, 'Will missis come into the kitchen?'  The lady went. Presently she called to her husband, 'I do wish you would come here a moment.'  He rose and went into the kitchen.  There lay Eliza on two kitchen chairs. Her poor feet were all cut and bleeding, and she had fainted quite away. The master of the house drew his breath short, and stood silent.  [Illustration]  His wife and the cook were trying to bring Eliza round. The old man had Harry on his knee, and was busy pulling off his shoes and stockings, to warm the little cold feet.  'Poor creature,' said the lady.  Suddenly Eliza opened her eyes. A dreadful look of pain came into her face. She sprang up saying, 'Oh, my Harry, have they got him?'  As soon as he heard her voice, Harry jumped from the old man's knee, and running to her side, put up his arms.  'Oh, he's here! he's here,' she said, kissing him. 'Oh, ma'am,' she went, on turning wildly to the lady of the house, 'do protect us, don't let them get him.'  'Nobody shall hurt you here, poor woman,' said the lady. 'You are safe; don't be afraid.'  'God bless you,' said Eliza, covering her face and sobbing, while Harry, seeing her crying, tried to get into her lap to comfort her.  'You needn't be afraid of anything; we are friends here, poor woman. Tell me where you come from and what you want,' said the lady.  'I came from the other side of the river,' said Eliza.  'When?' said the gentleman, very much astonished.  'To-night.'  'How did you come?'  'I crossed on the ice.'  'Crossed on the ice!' exclaimed every one.  'Yes,' said Eliza slowly, 'I did. God helped me, and I crossed on the ice. They were close behind me--right behind, and there was no other way.'  'Law, missis,' said the old servant, 'the ice is all in broken up blocks, a-swinging up and down in the water.'  'I know it is. I know it,' said Eliza wildly. 'But I did it. I would'nt have thought I could--I didn't think I could get over, but I didn't care. I could but die if I didn't. And God helped me.'  'Were you a slave?' said the gentleman.  'Yes, sir.'  'Was your master unkind to you?'  'No, sir.'  'Was your mistress unkind to you?'  'No, sir--no. My mistress was always good to me.'  'What could make you leave a good home, then, and run away, and go through such danger?'  'They wanted to take my boy away from me--to sell him--to sell him down south, ma'am"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11171"],["title","Uncle Tom's Cabin, Young Folks' Edition (#2)"],["body",". To go all alone--a baby that had never been away from his mother in his life. I couldn't bear it. I took him, and ran away in the night. They chased me, they were coming down close behind me, and I heard 'em. I jumped right on to the ice. How I got across I don't know. The first I knew, a man was helping me up the bank.'  It was such a sad story, that the tears came into the eyes of everyone who heard her tell it.  [Illustration]  'Where do you mean to go to, poor woman?' asked the lady.  'To Canada, if I only knew where that was. Is it very far off, is Canada'? said Eliza, looking up in a simple, trusting way, to the kind lady's face.  'Poor woman,' said she again.  'Is it a great way off?' asked Eliza.  'Yes,' said the lady of the house sadly, 'it is far away. But we will try to help you to get there.' Eliza wanted to go to Canada, because it belonged to the British. They did not allow any one to be made a slave there. George, too, was going to try to reach Canada.  'Wife,' said the gentleman, when they had gone back again into their own sitting-room, 'we must get that poor woman away to-night. She is not safe here. I know some good people, far in the country, who will take care of her.'  So this kind gentleman got the carriage ready, and drove Eliza and her boy a long, long way, through the dark night, to a cottage far in the country. There he left her with a good man and his wife, who promised to be kind to her, and help her to go to Canada. He gave some money to the good man too, and told him to use it for Eliza.     CHAPTER VI   UNCLE TOM SAYS GOOD-BYE   The day after the hunt for Eliza was a very sad one in Uncle Tom's cabin. It was the day on which Haley was going to take Uncle Tom away.  Aunt Chloe had been up very early. She had washed and ironed all Tom's clothes, and packed his trunk neatly. Now she was cooking the breakfast,--the last breakfast she would ever cook for her dear husband. Her eyes were quite red and swollen with crying, and the tears kept running down her cheeks all the time.  'It's the last time,' said Tom sadly.  Aunt Chloe could not answer. She sat down, buried her face in her hands, and sobbed aloud.  'S'pose we must be resigned. But, O Lord, how can I? If I knew anything where you was goin', or how they'd treat you! Missis says she'll try and buy you back again in a year or two. But, Lor', nobody never comes back that goes down there.'  'There'll be the same God there, Chloe, that there is here.'  'Well,' said Aunt Chloe, 's'pose dere will. But the Lord lets drefful things happen sometimes. I don't seem to get no comfort dat way.'  'Let's think on our mercies,' said Tom, in a shaking voice.  'Mercies!' said Aunt Chloe, 'don't see any mercies in 't. It isn't right! it isn't right it should be so! Mas'r never ought to have left it so that ye could be took for his debts. Mebbe he can't help himself now, but I feel it's wrong. Nothing can beat that out of me. Such a faithful crittur as ye've been, reckonin' on him more than your own wife and chil'en.'  'Chloe! now, if ye love me, you won't talk so, when it is perhaps jest the last time we'll ever have together,' said Tom.  'Wall, anyway, there's wrong about it somewhere,' said Aunt Chloe, 'I can't jest make out where 'tis. But there is wrong somewhere, I'm sure of that.'  Neither Tom nor Chloe could eat any breakfast; their hearts were too full of sorrow. But the little children, who hardly understood what was happening, enjoyed theirs. It was not often that they had such a fine one as Chloe had cooked for Tom's last morning at home.  [Illustration]  Breakfast was just finished, when Mrs. Shelby came. Chloe was not very pleased to see her. She was angry, and blamed her for letting Tom be sold.  But Mrs. Shelby did not seem to see Aunt Chloe's angry looks. 'Tom,' she said, turning to him, 'I come to--' she could say no more, she was crying so bitterly.  Then all Aunt Chloe's anger faded away.  'Lor', now missis, don't-don't,' she said. She too burst out crying again, and for a few minutes they all sobbed together.  'Tom,' said Mrs. Shelby at last, 'I can't do anything for you now. But I promise you, most solemnly, to save as much, money as I can. As soon as I have enough, I will buy you back again.'  Just then Haley arrived. Tom said a last sad good-bye to his wife and children, and got into the cart, which Haley had brought with him.  As soon as Tom was seated in the cart, Haley took a heavy chain, and fastened it round his ankles. Poor Tom had done nothing wrong, yet he was treated worse than a thief, just because he was a slave.  'You don't need to do that,' said Mrs. Shelby, 'Tom won't run away.'  'Don't know so much about that, ma'am; I've lost one already. I can't afford to run any more risks,' replied Haley.  'Please give my love to Mas'r George,' said Tom, looking round sadly. 'Tell him how sorry I am he is not at home to say good-bye.'  Master George was Mr. and Mrs. Shelby's son. He was very fond of Tom, and was teaching him to write. He often used to come and have tea in Uncle Tom's little cottage. Aunt Chloe used to make her very nicest cakes when Mas'r George came to tea. But he was not at home now, and did not know that Tom had been sold.  Haley whipped up the horse, and, with a last sad look at the old place, Tom was whirled away to a town called Washington.     CHAPTER VII   UNCLE TOM MEETS EVA   Haley stayed in Washington several days. He went to market each day and bought more slaves. He put heavy chains on their hands and feet, and sent them to prison along with Tom.  When he had bought all the slaves he wanted, and was ready to go, he drove them before him, like a herd of cattle, on to a boat which was going south.  It was a beautiful boat. The deck was gay with lovely ladies and fine gentlemen walking about enjoying the bright spring sunshine.  Down on the lower deck, in the dark, among the luggage, were crowded Tom and the other poor slaves.  Some of the ladies and gentlemen on board were very sorry for the poor niggers, and pitied them. Others never thought about them at all, or if they did, thought it was quite just and proper that they should be treated badly. 'They are only slaves,' they said.  Among the passengers was a pretty little girl, about six years old. She had beautiful golden hair, and big blue eyes. She ran about here, there, and everywhere, dancing and laughing like a little fairy. There were other children on board, but not one so pretty or so merry as she. She was always dressed in white, and Tom thought she looked like a little angel, as she danced and ran about.  Often and often she would come and walk sadly around the place where the poor slaves sat in their chains. She would look pityingly at them, and then go slowly away. Once or twice she came with her dress full of sweets, nuts, and oranges, and gave them all some.  Tom watched the little lady, and tried to make friends with her. His pockets were full of all kinds of things, with which he used to amuse his old master's children.  He could make whistles of every sort and size, cut baskets out of cherry-stones, faces out of nut-shells, jumping figures out of bits of wood. He brought these out one by one, and though the little girl was shy at first, they soon grew to be great friends.  'What is missy's name?' said Tom one day.  'Evangeline St. Clare,' said the little girl; 'though papa and everybody else call me Eva. Now, what's your name?'  'My name's Tom. The little chil'en at my old home used to call me Uncle Tom.'  'Then I mean to call you Uncle Tom, because, you see, I like you,' said Eva. 'So, Uncle Tom, where are you going?'  'I don't know, Miss Eva.'  'Don't know?' said Eva.  'No. I'm going to be sold to somebody. I don't know who.'  'My papa can buy you, said Eva quickly. 'If he buys you you will have good times. I mean to ask him to, this very day.'  'Thank you, my little lady,' said Tom.  Just at this moment, the boat stopped at a small landing-place to take in some wood. Eva heard her father's voice, and ran away to speak to him.  Tom too rose and walked to the side. He was allowed to go about now without chains. He was so good and gentle, that even a man like Haley could not help seeing that it could do no harm to let him go free.  Tom helped the sailors to carry the wood on the boat. He was so big and strong that they were very glad to have his help.  [Illustration]  Eva and her father were standing by the railings as the boat once more began to move. It had hardly left the landing-stage when, some how or other, Eva lost her balance. She fell right over the side of the boat into the water.  Tom was standing just under her, on the lower deck, as she fell. In one moment he sprang after her. The next he had caught her his arms, and was swimming with her to the boat-side, where eager hands were held out to take her.  The whole boat was in confusion. Every one ran to help Eva, while the poor slave went back to his place, unnoticed and uncared for.  But Mr. St. Clare did not forget.  The next day Tom sat on the lower deck, with folded arms, anxiously watching him as he talked to Haley.  Eva's father was a very handsome man. He was like Eva, with the same beautiful blue eyes and golden-brown hair. He was very fond of fun and laughter, and though he had quite made up his mind to buy Tom, he was now teasing Haley, and pretending to think that he was asking too much money for him.  [Illustration]  'Papa do buy him, it's no matter what you pay', whispered Eva softly, putting her arms around her father's neck. 'You have money enough, I know. I want him.'  'What for, pussy? Are you going to use him for a rattle-box, or a rocking-horse, or what?'  'I want to make him happy.'  Mr. St. Clare laughed; but after making a few more jokes about it, he gave Haley the money he asked for, and Tom had a new master.  'Come, Eva,' said Mr. St. Clare, and, taking her hand, went across the boat to Tom.  'Look up, Tom,' he said to him, 'and see how you "]]]
