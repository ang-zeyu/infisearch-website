(1) Fig. 3 affords an interesting practical demonstration of the truth of this theorem. If the reader will copy this figure, cut out the squares on the two shorter sides of the triangle and divide them along the lines AD, BE, EF, he will find that the five pieces so obtained can be made exactly to fit the square on the longest side as shown by the dotted lines. The size and shape of the triangle ABC, so long as it has a right angle at C, is immaterial. The lines AD, BE are obtained by continuing the sides of the square on the side AB, _i.e_. the side opposite the right angle, and EF is drawn at right angles to BE.  After absorbing what knowledge was to be gained in Egypt, PYTHAGORAS journeyed to Babylon, where he probably came into contact with even greater traditions and more potent influences and sources of knowledge than in Egypt, for there is reason for believing that the ancient Chaldeans were the builders of the Pyramids and in many ways the intellectual superiors of the Egyptians.  At last, after having travelled still further East, probably as far as India, PYTHAGORAS returned to his birthplace to teach the men of his native land the knowledge he had gained. But CROESUS was tyrant over Samos, and so oppressive was his rule that none had leisure in which to learn. Not a student came to PYTHAGORAS, until, in despair, so the story runs, he offered to pay an artisan if he would but learn geometry. The man accepted, and later, when PYTHAGORAS pretended inability any longer to continue the payments, he offered, so fascinating did he find the subject, to pay his teacher instead if the lessons might only be continued. PYTHAGORAS no doubt was much gratified at this; and the motto he adopted for his great Brotherhood, of which we shall make the acquaintance in a moment, was in all likelihood based on this event. It ran, \"Honour a figure and a step before a figure and a tribolus\"; or, as a freer translation renders it:--  \"A figure and a step onward Not a figure and a florin.\"   \"At all events,\" as Mr FRANKLAND remarks, \"the motto is a lasting witness to a very singular devotion to knowledge for its own sake.\"(1)   (1) W. B. FRANKLAND, M.A.: _The Story of Euclid_ (1902), p. 33  But PYTHAGORAS needed a greater audience than one man, however enthusiastic a pupil he might be, and he left Samos for Southern Italy, the rich inhabitants of whose cities had both the leisure and inclination to study. Delphi, far-famed for its Oracles, was visited _en route_, and PYTHAGORAS, after a sojourn at Tarentum, settled at Croton, where he gathered about him a great band of pupils, mainly young people of the aristocratic class. By consent of the Senate of Croton, he formed out of these a great philosophical brotherhood, whose members lived apart from the ordinary people, forming, as it were, a separate community. They were bound to PYTHAGORAS by the closest ties of admiration and reverence, and, for years after his death, discoveries made by Pythagoreans were invariably attributed to the Master, a fact which makes it very difficult exactly to gauge the extent of PYTHAGORAS' own knowledge and achievements. The regime of the Brotherhood, or Pythagorean Order, was a strict one, entailing \"high thinking and low living\" at all times. A restricted diet, the exact nature of which is in dispute, was observed by all members, and long periods of silence, as conducive to deep thinking, were imposed on novices. Women were admitted to the Order, and PYTHAGORAS' asceticism did not prohibit romance, for we read that one of his fair pupils won her way to his heart, and, declaring her affection for him, found it reciprocated and became his wife.  SCHURE writes: \"By his marriage with Theano, Pythagoras affixed _the seal of realization_ to his work. The union and fusion of the two lives was complete. One day when the master's wife was asked what length of time elapsed before a woman could become pure after intercourse with a man, she replied: 'If it is with her husband, she is pure all the time; if with another man, she is never pure.'\" \"Many women,\" adds the writer, \"would smilingly remark that to give such a reply one must be the wife of Pythagoras, and love him as Theano did. And they would be in the right, for it is not marriage that sanctifies love, it is love which justifies marriage.\"(1)   (1) EDOUARD SCHURE: _Pythagoras and the Delphic Mysteries_, trans. by F. ROTHWELL, B.A. (1906), pp. 164 and 165.   PYTHAGORAS was not merely a mathematician, he was first and foremost a philosopher, whose philosophy found in number the basis of all things, because number, for him, alone possessed stability of relationship. As I have remarked on a former occasion, \"The theory that the Cosmos has its origin and explanation in Number... is one for which it is not difficult to account if we take into consideration the nature of the times in which it was formulated. The Greek of the period, looking upon Nature, beheld no picture of harmony, uniformity and fundamental unity. The outer world appeared to him rather as a discordant chaos, the mere sport and plaything of the gods. The theory of the uniformity of Nature--that Nature is ever like to herself--the very essence of the modern scientific spirit, had yet to be born of years of unwearied labour and unceasing delving into Nature's innermost secrets. Only in Mathematics--in the properties of geometrical figures, and of numbers--was the reign of law, the principle of harmony, perceivable. Even at this present day when the marvellous has become commonplace, that property of right-angled triangles... already discussed... comes to the mind as a remarkable and notable fact: it must have seemed a stupendous marvel to its discoverer, to whom, it appears, the regular alternation of the odd and even numbers, a fact so obvious to us that we are inclined to attach no importance to it, seemed, itself, to be something wonderful. Here in Geometry and Arithmetic, here was order and harmony unsurpassed and unsurpassable. What wonder then that Pythagoras concluded that the solution of the mighty riddle of the Universe was contained in the mysteries of Geometry? What wonder that he read mystic meanings into the laws of Arithmetic, and believed Number to be the explanation and origin of all that is?\"(1)   (1) _A Mathematical Theory of Spirit_ (1912), pp. 64-65.   No doubt the Pythagorean theory suffers from a defect similar to that of the Kabalistic doctrine, which, starting from the fact that all words are composed of letters, representing the primary sounds of language, maintained that all the things represented by these words were created by God by means of the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet. But at the same time the Pythagorean theory certainly embodies a considerable element of truth. Modern science demonstrates nothing more clearly than the importance of numerical relationships. Indeed, \"the history of science shows us the gradual transformation of crude facts of experience into increasingly exact generalisations by the application to them of mathematics. The enormous advances that have been made in recent years in physics and chemistry are very largely due to mathematical methods of interpreting and co-ordinating facts experimentally revealed, whereby further experiments have been suggested, the results of which have themselves been mathematically interpreted. Both physics and chemistry, especially the former, are now highly mathematical. In the biological sciences and especially in psychology it is true that mathematical methods are, as yet, not so largely employed. But these sciences are far less highly developed, far less exact and systematic, that is to say, far less scientific, at present, than is either physics or chemistry. However, the application of statistical methods promises good results, and there are not wanting generalisations already arrived at which are expressible mathematically; Weber's Law in psychology, and the law concerning the arrangement of the leaves about the stems of plants in biology, may be instanced as cases in point.\"(1)   (1) Quoted from a lecture by the present writer on \"The Law of Correspondences Mathematically Considered,\" delivered before The Theological and Philosophical Society on 26th April 1912, and published in _Morning Light_, vol. xxxv (1912), p. 434 _et seq_.   The Pythagorean doctrine of the Cosmos, in its most reasonable form, however, is confronted with one great difficulty which it seems incapable of overcoming, namely, that of continuity. Modern science, with its atomic theories of matter and electricity, does, indeed, show us that the apparent continuity of material things is spurious, that all material things consist of discrete particles, and are hence measurable in numerical terms. But modern science is also obliged to postulate an ether behind these atoms, an ether which is wholly continuous, and hence transcends the domain of number.(1) It is true that, in quite recent times, a certain school of thought has argued that the ether is also atomic in constitution--that all things, indeed, have a grained structure, even forces being made up of a large number of quantums or indivisible units of force. But this view has not gained general acceptance, and it seems to necessitate the postulation of an ether beyond the ether, filling the interspaces between its atoms, to obviate the difficulty of conceiving of action at a distance.   (1) Cf. chap. iii., \"On Nature as the Embodiment of Number,\" of my _A Mathematical Theory of Spirit_, to which reference has already been made.   According to BERGSON, life--the reality that can only be lived, not understood--is absolutely continuous (_i.e_. not amenable to numerical treatment). It is because life is absolutely continuous that we cannot, he says, understand it; for reason acts discontinuously, grasping only, so to speak, a cinematographic"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12734"],["title","The Young Engineers in Colorado; Or, At Railroad Building in Earnest (#1)"],["body","to carry a civil tongue, and to be quiet when I ought to.\"  \"I suppose people who don't possess those virtues are the only people that have excuse for carrying a pistol around with their keys, loose change and toothbrushes,\" affirmed Reade.  \"Harry, the longer you stay west the more people you'll find who'll tell you that toting a pistol is a silly, trouble-breeding habit.\"  They drove along for another hour before a clattering sounded behind them.  \"I believe it's Bad Pete coming,\" declared Harry, as he made out, a quarter of a mile behind them, the form of a man mounted on a small, wiry mustang.  \"Yep; it is,\" nodded the Colorado boy, after a look back.  The trail being wider here Bad Pete whirled by them with a swift drumming of his pony's hoofs.  In a few moments more he was out of sight.  \"Tom, you may have your doubts about that fellow,\" Hazelton remarked, \"but there's one thing he can do---ride!\"  \"Humph!  Anyone can ride that knows enough to get into a saddle and stick there,\" observed the Colorado boy dryly.  Readers of the \"_Grammar School Boys Series_\" and of the \"_High School Boys Series_\", have already recognized in Tom Reade and Harry Hazelton two famous schoolboy athletes.  Back in old Gridley there had once been a schoolboy crowd of six, known as Dick & Co.  Under the leadership of Dick Prescott, these boys had made their start in athletics in the Central Grammar School, winning no small amount of fame as junior schoolboy athletes.  Then in their High School days Dick & Co. had gradually made themselves crack athletes.  Baseball and football were their especial sports, and in these they had reached a degree of skill that had made many a college trainer anxious to obtain them.  None of the six, however, had gone to college.  Dick Prescott and Greg Holmes had secured appointments as cadets at the United States Military Academy, at West Point.  Their adventures are told in the \"_West Point Series_.\"  Dave Darrin and Dan Dalzell, feeling the call to the Navy, had entered the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis.  Their further doings are all described in the \"_Annapolis Series_.\"  Tom Reade and Harry Hazelton, however, had found that their aspirations pointed to the great constructive work that is done by the big-minded, resourceful American civil engineer of today.  Bridge building, railroad building, the tunneling of mines---in a word, the building of any of the great works of industry possessed a huge fascination for them.  Tom was good-natured and practical, Harry at times full of mischief and at others dreamy, but both longed with all their souls to place themselves some day in the front ranks among civil engineers.  At high school they had given especial study to mathematics. At home they had studied engineering, through correspondence courses and otherwise.  During more than the last year of their home life our two boys had worked much in the offices of a local civil engineer, and had spent part of their school vacations afield with him.  Finally, after graduating from school both boys had gone to New York in order to look the world over.  By dint of sheer push, three-quarters of which Tom had supplied, the boys had secured their first chance in the New York offices of the S.B. & L.  Not much of a chance, to be sure, but it meant forty dollars a month and board in the field, with the added promise that, if they turned out to be \"no good,\" they would be promptly \"bounced.\"  \"If 'bounced' we are,\" Tom remarked dryly, \"we'll have to walk home, for our money will just barely take us to Colorado.\"  So here they were, having come by rail to a town some distance west of Pueblo.  From the last railway station they had been obliged to make thirty miles or more by wagon to the mountain field camp of the S.B. & L.  Since daybreak they had been on the way, eating breakfast and lunch from the paper parcels that they had brought with them.  \"How much farther is the camp, now that you know the way.\"  Reade inquired an hour after Bad Pete had vanished on horseback.  \"There it is, right down there,\" answered the Colorado youth, pointing with his whip as the raw-boned team hauled the wagon to the top of a rise in the trail.  Of the trail to the left, surrounded by natural walls of rock, was an irregularly shaped field about three or four acres in extent. Here and there wisps of grass grew, but the ground, for the most part, was covered by splinters of rock or of sand ground from the same.  At the farther end of the camp stood a small wooden building, with three tents near try.  At a greater distance were several other tents.  Three wagons stood at one side of the camp, though horses or mules for the same were not visible.  Outside, near the door of one tent, stood a transit partially concealed by the enveloping rubber cover.  Near another tent stood a plane table, used in field platting (drawing).  Signs of life about the camp there were none, save for the presence of the newcomers.  \"I wonder if there's anyone at home keeping house,\" mused Tom Reade, as he jumped down from the wagon.  \"There's only one wooden house in this town.  That must be where the boss lives,\" declared Harry.  \"Yes; that's where the boss lives,\" replied the Colorado youth, with a wry smile.  \"Let's go over and see whether he has time to talk to us,\" suggested Reade.  \"Just one minute, gentlemen,\" interposed the driver.  \"Where do you want your kit boxes placed?  Are you going to pay me now?\"  \"Drop the kit boxes on the ground anywhere,\" Tom answered.  \"We're strong enough to carry 'em when we find where they belong.\"  And---yes: we are going to pay you now.  Eighteen dollars, isn't it?\"  \"Yes,\" replied the young driver, with the brevity of the mountaineer.  Tom and Harry went into their pockets, each producing nine dollars as his share of the fare.  This was handed over to the Colorado youth.  \"'Bliged to you, gentlemen,\" nodded the Colorado boy pocketing the money.  \"Anything more to say to me?\"  \"Nothing remains to be said, except to thank you, and to wish you good luck on your way back,\" said Reade.  \"I wish you luck here, too, gentlemen.  Good day.\"  With that, the driver mounted his seat, turned the horses about and was off without once looking back.  \"Now let's go over to the house and see the boss,\" murmured Tom.  Together the chums skirted the camp, going up to the wooden building. As the door was open, Tom, with a sense of good manners, approached from the side that he might not appear to be peeping in on the occupants of the building.  Gaining the side of the doorway, with Harry just behind him, Reade knocked softly.  \"Quit yer kidding, whoever it is, and come in,\" called a rough voice.  Tom thereupon stepped inside.  What he saw filled him with surprise. Around the room were three or four tables.  There were many utensils hanging on the walls.  There were two stoves, with a man bending over one of them and stirring something in a pot.  \"Oh, I beg your pardon,\" said Tom.  \"I thought I'd find Mr. Timothy Thurston, the chief engineer, here.\"  \"Nope,\" replied a stout, red-faced man of forty, in flannel shirt and khaki trousers.  \"Mr. Thurston never eats between meals, and when he does eat he's served in his own mess tent.  Whatcher want here, pardner?\"  \"We're under orders to report to him,\" Tom answered politely.  \"New men in the chain gang?\" asked the cook, swinging around to look at the newcomers.  \"Maybe,\" Reade assented.  \"That will depend on the opinion that Mr. Thurston forms of us after he knows us a little while.  I believe the man in New York said we were to be assistant engineers.\"  \"There's only one assistant engineer here,\" announced the cook. \"The other engineers are Just plain surveyors or levelers.\"  \"Well, we won't quarrel about titles,\" Tom smilingly assured the cook.  \"Will you please tell us where Mr. Thurston is?\"  \"He's in his tent over yonder,\" said the cook, pointing through the open doorway.  \"Shall we step over there and announce ourselves?\" Tom inquired.  \"Why, ye could do it,\" rejoined the red-faced cook, with a grin. \"If Tim Thurston happens to be very busy he might use plain talk and tell you to git out of camp.\"  \"Then do you mind telling us just how we should approach the chief engineer?\"  \"Whatter yer names?\"  \"Reade and Hazelton.\"  \"Bob, trot over and tell Thurston there's two fellows here, named Reade and Hazelnut.  Ask him what he wants done with 'em.\"  The cook's helper, who, so far, had not favored the new arrivals with a glance, now turned and looked them over.  Then, with a nod, the helper stepped across the ground to the largest tent in camp.  In a few moments he came back.  \"Mr. Thurston says to stay around and he'll call you jest as soon as he's through with what he's doing,\" announced Bob, who, dark, thin and anemic, was a decrepit-looking man of fifty years or thereabouts.  \"Ye can stand about in the open,\" added the cook, pointing with his ladle.  \"There's better air out there.\"  \"Thank you,\" answered Tom briskly, but politely.  Once outside, and strolling slowly along, Reade confided to his chum:  \"Harry, you can see what big fellows we two youngsters are going to be in a Rocky Mountain railroad camp.  We haven't a blessed thing to do but play marbles until the chief can see us.\"  \"I can spare the time, if the chief can,\" laughed Harry.  \"Hello---look who's here!\"  Bad Pete, now on foot, had turned into the camp from the farther side.  Espying the boys he swaggered over toward them.  \"How do you do, sir?\" nodded Tom.  \"Can't you two tenderfeet mind your own business?\" snarled Pete, halting and scowling angrily at them.  \"Now, I come to think of it,\" admitted Tom, \"it _was_ meddlesome on my part to ask after your health.  I beg your pardon.\"  \"Say, are you two tenderfeet trying to git fresh with me?\" demanded Bad Pete, drawing himself up to his full height and gazing at them out of flashing eyes.  Almost unconsciously Tom Reade drew himself up, showing hints of his"]]]
