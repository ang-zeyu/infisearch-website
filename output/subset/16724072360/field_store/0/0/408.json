We came       together to the great ravine behind the Theatre. It is empty save       for trees and weeds. Beyond the ravine there is a plain, and       beyond the plain there lies the Uncharted Forest, about which men       must not think.        We were gathering the papers and the rags which the wind had       blown from the Theatre, when we saw an iron bar among the weeds.       It was old and rusted by many rains. We pulled with all our       strength, but we could not move it. So we called International       4-8818, and together we scraped the earth around the bar. Of a       sudden the earth fell in before us, and we saw an old iron grill       over a black hole.        International 4-8818 stepped back. But we pulled at the grill and       it gave way. And then we saw iron rings as steps leading down a       shaft into a darkness without bottom.        “We shall go down,” we said to International 4-8818.        “It is forbidden,” they answered.        We said: “The Council does not know of this hole, so it cannot be       forbidden.”        And they answered: “Since the Council does not know of this hole,       there can be no law permitting to enter it. And everything which       is not permitted by law is forbidden.”        But we said: “We shall go, none the less.”        They were frightened, but they stood by and watched us go.        We hung on the iron rings with our hands and our feet. We could       see nothing below us. And above us the hole open upon the sky       grew smaller and smaller, till it came to be the size of a       button. But still we went down. Then our foot touched the ground.       We rubbed our eyes, for we could not see. Then our eyes became       used to the darkness, but we could not believe what we saw.        No men known to us could have built this place, nor the men known       to our brothers who lived before us, and yet it was built by men.       It was a great tunnel. Its walls were hard and smooth to the       touch; it felt like stone, but it was not stone. On the ground       there were long thin tracks of iron, but it was not iron; it felt       smooth and cold as glass. We knelt, and we crawled forward, our       hand groping along the iron line to see where it would lead. But       there was an unbroken night ahead. Only the iron tracks glowed       through it, straight and white, calling us to follow. But we       could not follow, for we were losing the puddle of light behind       us. So we turned and we crawled back, our hand on the iron line.       And our heart beat in our fingertips, without reason. And then we       knew.        We knew suddenly that this place was left from the Unmentionable       Times. So it was true, and those Times had been, and all the       wonders of those Times. Hundreds upon hundreds of years ago men       knew secrets which we have lost. And we thought: “This is a foul       place. They are damned who touch the things of the Unmentionable       Times.” But our hand which followed the track, as we crawled,       clung to the iron as if it would not leave it, as if the skin of       our hand were thirsty and begging of the metal some secret fluid       beating in its coldness.        We returned to the earth. International 4-8818 looked upon us and       stepped back.        “Equality 7-2521,” they said, “your face is white.”        But we could not speak and we stood looking upon them.        They backed away, as if they dared not touch us. Then they       smiled, but it was not a gay smile; it was lost and pleading. But       still we could not speak. Then they said:        “We shall report our find to the City Council and both of us will       be rewarded.”        And then we spoke. Our voice was hard and there was no mercy in       our voice. We said:        “We shall not report our find to the City Council. We shall not       report it to any men.”        They raised their hands to their ears, for never had they heard       such words as these.        “International 4-8818,” we asked, “will you report us to the       Council and see us lashed to death before your eyes?”        They stood straight all of a sudden and they answered: “Rather       would we die.”        “Then,” we said, “keep silent. This place is ours. This place       belongs to us, Equality 7-2521, and to no other men on earth. And       if ever we surrender it, we shall surrender our life with it       also.”        Then we saw that the eyes of International 4-8818 were full to       the lids with tears they dared not drop. They whispered, and       their voice trembled, so that their words lost all shape:        “The will of the Council is above all things, for it is the will       of our brothers, which is holy. But if you wish it so, we shall       obey you. Rather shall we be evil with you than good with all our       brothers. May the Council have mercy upon both our hearts!”        Then we walked away together and back to the Home of the Street       Sweepers. And we walked in silence.        Thus did it come to pass that each night, when the stars are high       and the Street Sweepers sit in the City Theatre, we, Equality       7-2521, steal out and run through the darkness to our place. It       is easy to leave the Theatre; when the candles are blown out and       the Actors come onto the stage, no eyes can see us as we crawl       under our seat and under the cloth of the tent. Later, it is easy       to steal through the shadows and fall in line next to       International 4-8818, as the column leaves the Theatre. It is       dark in the streets and there are no men about, for no men may       walk through the City when they have no mission to walk there.       Each night, we run to the ravine, and we remove the stones which       we have piled upon the iron grill to hide it from the men. Each       night, for three hours, we are under the earth, alone.        We have stolen candles from the Home of the Street Sweepers, we       have stolen flints and knives and paper, and we have brought them       to this place. We have stolen glass vials and powders and acids       from the Home of the Scholars. Now we sit in the tunnel for three       hours each night and we study. We melt strange metals, and we mix       acids, and we cut open the bodies of the animals which we find in       the City Cesspool. We have built an oven of the bricks we       gathered in the streets. We burn the wood we find in the ravine.       The fire flickers in the oven and blue shadows dance upon the       walls, and there is no sound of men to disturb us.        We have stolen manuscripts. This is a great offense. Manuscripts       are precious, for our brothers in the Home of the Clerks spend       one year to copy one single script in their clear handwriting.       Manuscripts are rare and they are kept in the Home of the       Scholars. So we sit under the earth and we read the stolen       scripts. Two years have passed since we found this place. And in       these two years we have learned more than we had learned in the       ten years of the Home of the Students.        We have learned things which are not in the scripts. We have       solved secrets of which the Scholars have no knowledge. We have       come to see how great is the unexplored, and many lifetimes will       not bring us to the end of our quest. But we wish no end to our       quest. We wish nothing, save to be alone and to learn, and to       feel as if with each day our sight were growing sharper than the       hawk’s and clearer than rock crystal.        Strange are the ways of evil. We are false in the faces of our       brothers. We are defying the will of our Councils. We alone, of       the thousands who walk this earth, we alone in this hour are       doing a work which has no purpose save that we wish to do it. The       evil of our crime is not for the human mind to probe. The nature       of our punishment, if it be discovered, is not for the human       heart to ponder. Never, not in the memory of the Ancient Ones’       Ancients, never have men done that which we are doing.        And yet there is no shame in us and no regret. We say to       ourselves that we are a wretch and a traitor. But we feel no       burden upon our spirit and no fear in our heart. And it seems to       us that our spirit is clear as a lake troubled by no eyes save       those of the sun. And in our heart—strange are the ways of       evil!—in our heart there is the first peace we have known in       twenty years.          PART TWO        Liberty 5-3000... Liberty five-three thousand ... Liberty       5-3000....        We wish to write this name. We wish to speak it, but we dare not       speak it above a whisper. For men are forbidden to take notice of       women, and women are forbidden to take notice of men. But we       think of one among women, they whose name is Liberty 5-3000, and       we think of no others. The women who have been assigned to work       the soil live in the Homes of the Peasants beyond the City. Where       the City ends there is a great road winding off to the north, and       we Street Sweepers must keep this road clean to the first       milepost. There is a hedge along the road, and beyond the hedge       lie the fields. The fields are black and ploughed, and they lie       like a great fan before us, with their furrows gathered in some       hand beyond the sky, spreading forth from that hand, opening wide       apart as they come toward us, like black pleats that sparkle with       thin, green spangles. Women work in the fields, and their white       tunics in the wind are like the wings of sea-gulls beating over       the black soil.        And there it was that we saw Liberty 5-3000 walking along the       furrows. Their body was straight and thin as a blade of iron.       Their eyes were dark and hard and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12507"],["title","The History of the Rise, Progress and Accomplishment of the Abolition of the (#1)"],["body","in time that it was only by the most delicate management that I could get forward on these occasions. I resolved therefore for the future, except in particular cases, that, when I should be introduced to persons who had a competent knowledge of this trade, I would talk with them upon it as upon any ordinary subject, and then leave them without saying any thing about their becoming evidences. I would take care, however, to commit all their conversation to writing, when it was over, and I would then try to find out that person among their relations or friends, who could apply to them for this purpose with the least hazard of a refusal.  There were others also, who, though they were not so much impressed by the considerations mentioned, yet objected to give their public testimony. Those, whose livelihood, or promotion, or expectations, were dependent upon the government of the country, were generally backward on these occasions. Though they thought they discovered in the parliamentary conduct of Mr. Pitt, a bias in favour of the cause, they knew to a certainty that the Lord Chancellor Thurlow was against it. They conceived, therefore, that the administration was at least divided upon the question, and they were fearful of being called upon lest they should give offence, and thus injure their prospects in life. This objection was very prevalent in that part of the kingdom which I had selected for my tour.  The reader can hardly conceive how my mind was agitated and distressed on these different accounts. To have travelled more than two months, to have seen many who could have materially served our cause, and to have lost most of them, was very trying. And though it is true that I applied a remedy, I was not driven to the adoption of it till I had performed more than half my tour. Suffice it to say, that after having travelled upwards of sixteen hundred miles backwards and forwards, and having conversed with forty-seven persons, who were capable of promoting the cause by their evidence, I could only prevail upon nine, by all the interest I could make, to be examined.  On my return to London, whither I had been called up by the committee to take upon me the superintendence of the evidence, which the privy council was now ready again to hear, I found my brother: he was then a young officer in the navy; and as I knew he felt as warmly as I did in this great cause, I prevailed upon him to go to Havre de Grace, the great slave-port in France, where he might make his observations for two or three months, and then report what he had seen and heard; so that we might have some one to counteract any false statement of things which might be made relative to the subject in that quarter.  At length the examinations were resumed, and with them the contest, in which our own reputation and the fate of our cause were involved. The committee for the abolition had discovered one or two willing evidences during my absence, and Mr. Wilberforce, who was now recovered from his severe indisposition, had found one or two others. These added to my own made a respectable body: but we had sent no more than four or five of these to the council when the King's illness unfortunately stopped our career. For nearly five weeks between the middle of November and January the examinations were interrupted or put off so that at the latter period we began to fear that there would be scarcely time to hear the rest; for not only the privy council report was to be printed, but the contest itself was to be decided by the evidence contained in it, in the existing session.  The examinations, however, went on, but they went on only slowly, being still subject to interruption from the same unfortunate cause. Among others I offered my mite of information again. I wished the council to see more of my African productions and manufactures, that they might really know what Africa was capable of affording instead of the Slave-trade, and that they might make a proper estimate of the genius and talents of the natives. The samples which I had collected, had been obtained by great labour, and at no inconsiderable expense: for whenever I had notice that a vessel had arrived immediately from that continent, I never hesitated to go, unless under the most pressing engagements elsewhere, even as far as Bristol, if I could pick up but a single new article. The Lords having consented, I selected several things for their inspection out of my box, of the contents of which the following account may not be unacceptable to the reader.  The first division of the box consisted of woods of about four inches square, all polished. Among these were mahogany of five different sorts, tulip-wood, satin-wood, cam-wood, bar-wood, fustic, black and yellow ebony, palm-tree, mangrove, calabash, and date. There were seven woods of which the native names were remembered: three of these, Tumiah, Samain, and Jimlaké, were of a yellow colour; Acajoú was of a beautiful deep crimson; Bork and Quellé were apparently fit for cabinet work; and Benten was the wood of which the natives made their canoes. Of the various other woods the names had been forgotten, nor were they known in England at all. One of them was of a fine purple; and from two others, upon which the privy council had caused experiments to be made, a strong yellow, a deep orange, and a flesh-colour were extracted.  The second division included ivory and musk; four species of pepper, the long, the black, the Cayenne, and the Malaguetta: three species of gum; namely, Senegal, Copal, and ruber astringens; cinnamon, rice, tobacco, indigo, white and Nankin cotton, Guinea corn, and millet; three species of beans, of which two were used for food, and the other for dyeing orange; two species of tamarinds, one for food, and the other to give whiteness to the teeth; pulse, seeds, and fruits of various kinds, some of the latter of which Dr. Spaarman had pronounced, from a trial during his residence in Africa, to be peculiarly valuable as drugs.  The third division contained an African loom, and an African spindle with spun cotton round it; cloths of cotton of various kinds, made by the natives, some white, but others dyed by them of different colours, and others, in which they had interwoven European silk; cloths and bags made of grass, and fancifully coloured; ornaments made of the same materials; ropes made from a species of aloes, and others, remarkably strong, from grass and straw; fine string made from the fibres of the roots of trees; soap of two kinds, one of which was formed from an earthy substance; pipe-bowls made of clay, and of a brown red; one of these, which came from the village of Dakard, was beautifully ornamented by black devices burnt in, and was besides highly glazed; another, brought from Galàm was made of earth, which was richly impregnated with little particles of gold; trinkets made by the natives from their own gold; knives and daggers made by them from our bar-iron; and various other articles, such as bags, sandals, dagger-cases, quivers, grisgris, all made of leather of their own manufacture, and dyed of various colours, and ingeniously sewed together.  The fourth division consisted of the thumb-screw, speculum oris, and chains and shackles of different kinds, collected at Liverpool. To these were added, iron neck-collars, and other instruments of punishment and confinement, used in the West Indies, and collected at other places. The instrument, also, by which Charles Horseler was mentioned to have been killed, in the former volume, was to be seen among these.  We were now advanced far into February, when we were alarmed by the intelligence that the Lords of the Council were going to prepare their report. At this time we had sent but few persons to them to examine, in comparison with our opponents, and we had yet eighteen to introduce: for answers had come into my tables of questions from several places, and persons had been pointed out to us by our correspondents, who had increased our list of evidences to this number. I wrote therefore to them, at the desire of the committee for the abolition, and gave them the names of the eighteen, and requested that all of them might be examined. I requested also, that they would order, for their own inspection, certain muster-rolls of vessels from Poole and Dartmouth, that they might be convinced that the objection which the Earl of Sandwich had made in the House of Lords, against the abolition of the Slave-trade, had no solid foundation. In reply to my first request they informed me, that it was impossible, in the advanced state of the session (it being then the middle of March), that the examinations of so many could be taken; but I was at liberty, in conjunction with the Bishop of London, to select eight for this purpose. This occasioned me to address them again; and I then found, to my surprise and sorrow, that even this last number was to be diminished; for I was informed in writing, \"that the Bishop of London having laid my last letter before their Lordships, they had agreed to meet on the Saturday next, and on the Tuesday following, for the purpose of receiving the evidence of some of the gentlemen named in it. And it was their Lordships' desire that I would give notice to any three of them (whose information I might consider as the most material) of the above determination, that they might attend the committee accordingly.\"  This answer, considering the difficulties we had found in collecting a body of evidence, and the critical situation in which we then were, was peculiarly distressing; but we had no remedy left us, nor could we reasonably complain. Three therefore were selected, and they were sent to deliver their testimony on their arrival in town.  But before the last of these had left the council-room, who should come up to me but Mr. Arnold! He had but lately arrived at Bristol from Africa; and having heard from our friends there that we had been daily looking"]]]
