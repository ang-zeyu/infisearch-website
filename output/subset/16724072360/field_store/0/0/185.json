Let us think a little of all these brave men and be worthy of them.  There were no music-halls in Belgium and there were posters on the blank walla, even of little villages, reminding bands and hurdy-gurdy players and the proprietors of dance-halls that this was no time for unnecessary noise.  There were no soldiers going gayly off to war; the Belgians were coming back from war.  They had been asked to hold out for three days, and they had held for three weeks.  All their little country was a battle-field, and Belgium open to the invader.  It was too late to get to Brussels, but there was still a train to Antwerp.  At Puers soldiers were digging trenches and stringing approaches with barbed wire.  The dikes had been opened and part of the country flooded.  Farther on we passed the Antwerp forts, then comely suburbs where houses had been torn down and acres of trees and shrubs-- precious, as may be imagined, to a people who line their country roads with elms and lindens like avenues in parks, and build monuments to benevolent-looking old horticulturists--chopped down and burned.  And go, presently, into the old city itself, dull-flaming with the scarlet, gold, and black, of the Belgian flag, and with something that seemed to radiate from the life itself of this hearty, happy people, after all their centuries of trade and war, and good food, and good art--like their own Rubenses and Van Dycks.  There was no business, not a ship moving in the Scheldt.  All who worked at all were helping prepare for the possible siege; those who didn't crowded the sidewalk cafes, listening to tales from the front, guessing by the aid of maps whither, across the silent, screened southwest, the German avalanche was spreading.  \"Treason,\" \"betrayal,\" \"savagery,\" were on everybody's lips.  For Antwerp, you might say, had been \"half German\"; many of its rich and influential men were of German origin, although they had lived in Belgium for years.  And now the Belgians felt they had lived there as spies, and the seizure of Belgium was an act long and carefully planned. One was told of the finding of rifles in German cellars, marked \"Preserves,\" of German consuls authorized to give prizes for the most complete inventories of their neighborhoods turned in by amateur spies.   Speaking to one man about the Rubens \"Descent from the Cross\" still hanging in the cathedral, I suggested that such a place was safe from bombardment.  He looked up at the lace-like old tower, whose chimes, jangling down through leaping shafts and jets of Gothic stone, have so long been Antwerp's voice.  \"They wouldn't stop a minute,\" he said.  All eastern Belgium was cut off.  Brussels, to which people run over for dinner and the theatre, might have been in China.  Meanwhile Antwerp seemed safe for the time and I returned to Ghent, got a train next day as far south as Deynze, where the owner of a two-wheeled Belgian cart was induced to take me another thirty kilometres on down to Courtrai. It was rumored that there had been a battle at Courtrai--it was, at any rate, close to the border and the German right wing and in the general line of their advance.  We rattled along the hard highroad, paved with Belgian blocks, with a well-pounded dirt path at the side for bicycles, between almost uninterrupted rows of low houses and tiny fields in which men and women both were working.  Other carts like ours passed by, occasional heavy wagons drawn by one of the handsome Belgian draft-horses, and now and then a small loaded cart, owner perched on top, zipping along behind a jolly Belgian work dog--pulling as if his soul depended on it and apparently having the time of his life.  Every one was busy, not a foot of ground wasted; a more incongruous place into which to force the waste and lawlessness of war it would be hard to imagine.  Past an old chateau, with its lake and pheasant-preserve; along the River Lys, with its miles of flax, soaked in this peculiarly potent water, now drying in countless little cones, like the tents of some vast Lilliputian army, and so at last into Courtrai.  It was like hundreds of other quaint old towns along the French and Flemish border, not yet raked by war, but motionless, with workmen idle, young men gone to the front, and nothing for people to do but exchange rumors and wait for the clash to come.  I strolled round the old square and through some of the winding streets.  One window was filled with tricolor sashes carrying the phrase: \"Long live our dear Belgium! May God preserve her!\"  On blank walls was this proclamation in parallel columns of French and Flemish:   Ville De Courtrai Avis Important a la Population Courtraisienne Stad Kortrijk Belangrijk Bericht aan de Kortrijksche Bevolking  I am about to make an appeal to your reason and your sentiments of humanity.  If, in the course of the unjust war which we are now enduring, it happens that French or Belgian troops bring German prisoners to our city, I beseech you to maintain your calm and dignity.  These prisoners, wounded or not, I shall take under my protection, became I say that they are not really to blame for acts which they have been ordered to do under threat of cruel punishment.  Yes, I say I shall take them under my protection because my heart bleeds to think that they, too, have left behind those dear to them--an aged father, an old mother, a wife, children, sisters, or sweethearts whom separation has plunged into deepest anguish.  Do not forget when you see these prisoners passing by, I beg of you, and permit yourself to shout at and insult them.  Keep, on the contrary, the respectful silence appropriate to thinking men.  Fellow citizens, if, in these grave and painful circumstances, you will listen to my advice, if you will recall that it is now thirty years that I have been your burgomaster and during all that time of hard work I have never asked a favor of you, I feel sure that you will obey my request and, on your side, you may be sure that my gratitude will not be wanting.  A.  REYNAEKT, Burgomaster.   Although war had not touched Courtrai as yet, the rumor of it, more terrifying often than the thing itself, had swept through all Flanders. Along the level highways leading into Courtrai trooped whole families carrying babies and what few household things they could fling together in blankets.  Covered wagons overflowed with men, women, and children. The speed with which rumor spread was incredible.  In one village a group of half-drunken men, who insisted on jeering the Germans were put at the head of a column and compelled to march several miles before they were released.  The word at once ran the length of dozens of highroads that the Germans \"were taking with them every one between fifteen and fifty.\" I heard the same warning repeated on several of the roads about Courtrai by men and women, panting, red-faced, stumbling blindly on from they knew not what.  Later, I met the same people, straggling back to their villages, good-naturedly accepting the jibes of those who had stayed behind.  A linen manufacturer who lived in the village of Deerlyck, not far from Courtrai, where German scouts had been reported, kindly asked me to come out and spend the night.  For several miles we drove through the densely populated countryside, past rows of houses whose occupants all seemed to know him.  Women ran out to stop him and rattled away in Flemish; there were excited knots of people every few steps, and the heads kept turning this way and that, as if we were all likely to be shot any minute.  We drove into the courtyard of the solid old Flemish house--a house in which he and his father before him had lived, with tiny rooms full of old paintings, garden, stable, and hothouse packed close in the saving Belgian fashion, and all as spick and span and shining as if built yesterday--and then into the street again.  It was interesting to watch this square little man roll sturdily along, throwing out his stout arms impatiently and flinging at the nervous villagers--who treated him almost as a sort of feudal lord--guttural Flemish commands to keep cool and not make fools of themselves.  All at once, coming out of nowhere, a wave of panic swept down the street like a squall across a still pond.  \"Bing--Bang!\" went wooden shutters over windows, the stout housewives flinging the bars home and gathering up their children.  Doors slammed, windows closed--it was like something in a play--and almost as soon as it takes to tell it there was not a head, not a sound; the low houses were one blank wall, and we stood in the street alone.  Just such scenes as this people must have known in the days when Europe was a general battle-ground--when the French or the Spanish came into Flanders; just such villages, just such housewives slamming shutters close--you can see them now in old Flemish pictures.  Slowly doors and windows opened, heads poked out.  The little street filled, the knots of people gathered again.  We walked up and down, the linen merchant flinging out his arms and his reassurances more and more vigorously.  Half an hour passed, and then, all at once, it came again. And this time it was real.  The Germans were coming!  Down the straight, paved highway, a mile or so away, at the farther end of an avenue of elms which framed them like a tunnel, was a band of horsemen.  They were coming at an easy trot, half a dozen in single file on either side of the road.  We could see their lances, held rakishly upstanding across the saddle, then the tail of the near horse whisking to and fro.  One, crossing over, was outlined against the sky, and those who could see whispered: \"One is standing"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11008"],["title","Antwerp to Gallipoli: A Year of the War on Many Frontsâ€”and Behind Them (#2)"],["body","se!\" as if this were somehow important.  Tears rolled down the cheeks of the women huddled inside the door before which we stood.  Coming nearer and nearer up that long tunnel of trees, like one of those unescapable things seen in dreams, the little gray spot of moving figures grew to strange proportions--\"the Germans!\"--front of that frightful avalanche.  A few hundred yards away they pulled down to a walk, and slowly, peering sharply out from under their helmets, entered the silent street.  Another moment and the leader was alongside, and we found ourselves looking up at a boy, not more than twenty he seemed, with blue eyes and a clean-cut, gentle face.  He passed without a look or word, but behind him a young officer, soldier-like and smart in the Prussian fashion, with a half-opened map in his hand, asked the way to a near-by village.  He took the linen merchant's direction without pausing and the horses swung down the side street.  \"Do you speak English?\" he called back, as if, in happier times, we might have been friends, and, without waiting for an answer, trotted on into the growing dusk.  They were but one of hundreds of such squads of light cavalry--uhlans for the most part--ranging all over western Belgium as far as Ostend, a dozen or so men in hostile country, prepared to be cut to pieces if they found the enemy they were looking for, or to be caught from ambush at any time by some squad of civic guards.  But as one watched them disappear down their long road to France they grew into something more than that.  And in the twilight of the quiet countryside these stern shapes that rode on without turning, lances upstanding from tired shoulders, became strange, grotesque, pathetic--again the Germans, legions of the War Lord, come too late into a world which must crush them at last, Knights of the Frightful Adventure, riding to their death.     Chapter II  Paris At Bay    The Calais and Boulogne routes were already closed.  Dieppe and Havre might at any moment follow.  You must go now, people said in London, if you want to get there at all.  And yet the boat was crowded as it left Folkstone.  In bright afternoon sunshine we hurried over the Channel, empty of any sign of war, unless war showed in its very emptiness.  Next to me sat a young Frenchman, different from those we had met before hurrying home to fight. Good-looking, tall, and rather languid in manner, he spoke English with an English accent, and you would have taken him for an Englishman.  A big canvas bag full of golf-clubs leaned against the wall behind him, and he had been trying to play golf at one of the east-coast seaside places in England.  But one couldn't play in a time like this, and the young man sighed and waved his hands rather desperately--one couldn't settle down to anything.  So he was going home.  To fight ?--I suggested.  Possibly, he said--the army had refused him several years ago--maybe they would take him now.  Very politely, in his quiet manner, he asked me down to tea.  When he stood by the rail watching the tawny French cliffs draw nearer, one noticed a certain weary droop to his shoulders, in contrast to his well-tanned, rather athletic-looking, face--born a little tired, perhaps, like the young nobleman in Bernstein's \"Whirlwind.\" His baggage was addressed to a Norman chateau.  On the other side was a pink-cheeked boy of seventeen, all French, though he spoke English and divided his time between writing post-cards to the boys he had been visiting in England and reading General von Bernhardi.  \"The first chapter, 'The Right to Make War,'\" he said, \"I understand that--yes! But the second chapter--'The Duty to Make War'\" --he laughed and shook his head.  \"No--no--no!\" He was the son of an insurance agent who was already at the front, and, although under age, he hoped to enlist. We drew nearer Dieppe--tall French houses leaning inward with tricolors in the windows, a quay with the baggy red breeches of French soldiers showing here and there--just such a scene as they paint on theatre curtains at home.  A smoky tug whistled uproariously, there was a patter of wooden shoes as children clattered along the stone jetty, and from all over the crowd that had come down to greet us came brave shouts of \"Eep-eep Hoorah! Eep-eep Hoorah!\"  No news, or at least no reliable news.  A lot of wounded had been brought in, business was stopped, the great beach deserted; some thought the Germans would be in Dieppe in a day or two.  Our train was supposed to start as soon as the boat arrived and reach Paris before ten that night.  It was after dark before we got away and another day before we crawled into St. Lazare.  There was a wild rush for places as soon as the gates opened; one took what one could, and nine of us, including three little children, were glad enough to crowd into a third-class compartment.  Two ladies, with the three little children, were hurrying away from the battle that their husbands .thought was going to be fought near Dieppe within a day or two.  From Paris they hoped to get to the south of France.  Over and over again the husbands said good-by, then the guards whistled for the last time.  \"Albaire!\" ... and a boy of about six went to the door of the compartment to receive his father's embrace.  \"Don't let the Germans get you!\" cried the father, with a great air of gayety, and kissed the boy again and again. He returned to his corner, rubbed his fists into his eyes, and the tears rolled out under them.  Then the two little girls-- twins, it seemed, about four years old, in little mushroom hats--took their turns, and they put their fists into their eyes and cried, and then the two mothers began to cry, and the men, dabbing their eyes and puffing vigorously at their cigars, cried good-by over and over, and so at last we moved out of the station.  The long train crept, stopped, backed, crept on again.  Through the open windows one caught glimpses of rows of poplar-trees and the countryside lying cool and white in the moonlight.  Then came stations with sentries, stray soldiers hunting for a place to squeeze in, and now and then empty troop-trains jolted by, smelling of horses.  In the confusion at Dieppe we had had no time to get anything to eat, and several hours went by before, at a station lunchroom, already supposed to be closed, I got part of a loaf of bread.  One of the young mothers brought out a bit of chocolate, the other a bottle of wine, and so we had supper--a souper de luxe, as one of them laughed--all, by this time, old friends.  Eleven o'clock--midnight--the gas, intended for a short journey, grew dimmer and dimmer, presently flickered out.  We were in darkness--all the train was in darkness--we were alone in France, wrapped in war and moonlight, half real beings who had been adventuring together, not for hours, but for years.  The dim figure on the left sighed, tried one position and another uneasily, and suddenly said that if it would not derange monsieur too much, she would try to sleep on his shoulder.  It would not derange monsieur in the least.  On the contrary...  \"You must make yourself at home in France,\" laughed the mother of the two little girls.  But the other was even more polite.  \"Nous sommes en Amerique!\" she murmured.  The train jolted slowly on. An hour or two after midnight it stopped and a strange figure in turban and white robe peered in.  \"Complet! Complet!\" cried the lady with the little girls.  But the figure kept staring in, and, turning, chattered to others like him.  There was a crowd of them, men from France's African colonies, from Algeria or Morocco, who had been working in the French mines and were now going back to take the places of trained soldiers--the daredevil \"Turcos\"--sent north to fight the Germans.  They did not get into our compartment, but into the one next to it, and as there was no place to sit down, stood in patient Arab fashion, and after a time gradually edged into ours, where they squatted on the floor.  They talked broken French or Italian or their native speech and now and then broke into snatches of a wild sort of song.  In Paris girls ran into the street and threw their arms about the brave \"Marocs\" as they marched by, but the lady with the little girls felt that they were a trifle smelly, and, fishing out a bottle of scent, she wet a handkerchief with it and passed it round.  The young Frenchman lit a match--three-twenty.  The little boy, rousing from his corner, suddenly announced, apropos of nothing, that the Germans ought to be dropped into kettles of boiling water; at once came the voice of one of the little girls, sound asleep apparently before this, warning him that he must not talk like that or the Germans might hear and shoot them.  We jolted on, backed, and suddenly one became aware that the gray light was not that of the moon.  The lady at my left sat upright.  \"The day comes!\" she said briskly.  It grew lighter.  We passed sentries, rifles stacked on station platforms, woods--the forest of St. Germain.  These woods were misty blue in the cool autumn morning, there were bivouac fires, coffee-pots on the coals, and standing beside these fires soldiers in kepis and red trousers and heavy blue coats with the flaps pinned back.  Just such soldiers and scenes you have seen in the war pictures of Detaille and De Neuville.  Bridges, more houses, the rectangular grass-covered faces of forts at last; just as Paris was getting up for breakfast, into St. Lazare station, heaped with trunks and boiling with people, Parisians, belated American tourists, refugees from northeast villages, going somewhere, anywhere, to get away.  It was September 2.  There were miles of closed shops with placards on the shutters: \"Proprietor and personnel have been called to the colors\"; no buses or trams, the few 'cabs piled with the luggage of those trying to get away, almost no way to traverse the splendid distances but to walk.  Papers could not be cried aloud on the"]]]
