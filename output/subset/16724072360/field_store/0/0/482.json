But as the darkness made accurate shooting by the Germans impossible, so it made speed by the fugitives impossible also. They stumbled along as well as they could, now and then tripping over a fallen limb or tumbling into a hole. Tired and almost exhausted, they at length emerged into the open, and broke into a weary run.  \"We have got to get under cover of some kind before they reach the edge of the woods, or we are gone goslings,\" panted Hal.  Suddenly, in the darkness, they came upon another clump of trees, and as they stumbled into their shelter another volley rang out. One man groaned and stumbled. A comrade lent a supporting hand and dragged him into the woods.  \"We'll stop here a moment and pick off a few of 'em,\" said Hal grimly.  The Germans were now advancing across the open space. Lying upon the ground, the nine opened fire. They aimed carefully and not a shot was wasted, and so rapid was their fire that the Germans halted.  \"They don't know how many of us there are,\" said Hal, \"and they are afraid to take a chance. One more volley, men, and then up and run for it again.\"  A final volley was delivered with telling effect, and the English sprang to their feet and darted through the woods. The Germans gave them a parting shot, but there was no pursuit.  \"That was pretty close,\" said Chester.  \"It was, indeed,\" replied Hal, \"and there is one more of our men gone. Was anyone wounded?\" he asked, turning to the others.  \"Shot in the shoulder, sir,\" replied a man named Brown.  \"They got me in the arm,\" said another.  \"Anyone else?\" questioned Hal.  There was no reply, and Hal asked:  \"Are you two men able to go on without assistance?\"  \"Yes,\" was the reply.  \"Good! Then come on.\"  All night long the little party continued on their march, and it was not until the first gray streak of dawn showed them, in the distance, the first British line that the boys felt entirely safe.  Their report made, they were returning, later in the day, to their quarters to seek a much needed rest, when a well known voice exclaimed:  \"Well, boys, how are you?\"  The lads turned quickly about; then each gave a cry of delight and grabbed the man who had accosted them by the hand.  \"Captain Derevaux!\" they exclaimed in a single voice.  \"No,\" replied the gallant Frenchman, with a smile. \"Major Derevaux, if you please!\"     CHAPTER IV.  THE GERMAN RETREAT BEGUN.   Hal and Chester stood for some minutes grasping their friend by the hand.  \"Major, eh,\" ejaculated Hal. \"I'm glad to hear that!\"  \"So am I,\" declared Chester. \"I am sure no one deserved promotion more than you.\"  \"Thanks,\" laughed the major.  \"Tell us,\" said Hal, \"what are you doing here? I thought you were with the Southern army.\"  \"I am; but I carried dispatches to General French, and if I mistake not, they are important ones. I believe that plans have been brought to a head and that we shall take the offensive soon.\"  \"Good!\" cried Chester. \"We have been retreating long enough.\"  \"But,\" Hal protested, \"we can hardly advance in the face of such odds; we must have reinforcements.\"  \"Well,\" said Major Derevaux, \"strong reinforcements already are arriving, and I believe that the advance will be general along our whole line.\"  \"That will mean severe fighting,\" said Chester.  \"Indeed it will,\" replied the major. \"It will mean fighting such as the world has never heard of before. It will mean death for thousands upon thousands. But the Germans must be pushed back.\"  \"And the Kaiser will find that he is not to have things all his own way,\" said Hal.  \"Exactly,\" returned the major. \"But I must leave you now, boys. I must return to my own regiment at once. Good luck to you!\"  \"Good luck!\" exclaimed the boys as the major turned on his heel and strode rapidly away.  The two lads returned to their own quarters and gave themselves up to rest. So completely were they worn out that it was dark when they again opened their eyes; and they probably would not have done so then had not the clear notes of a bugle awakened them.  Rushing into the open, the lads saw that on all sides the troops were ready to move--whether forward or backward they could not tell as yet. It was evident, however, that something was afoot.  Hal and Chester made their way to the side of General French and joined the members of his staff. The gallant British commander was sitting his horse quietly, his staff grouped about him. Occasionally one went dashing away with some order, as the general gave a laconic command.  The boys had hardly taken their places when General French said quietly:  \"Order a general advance!\"  A moment later and the small though mighty host of Britain was in motion, and a loud cheer rang out on the still night air as the troops perceived that they were going forward--that the retreat had ended.  Swiftly and silently the army advanced. Ahead could be heard the crack, crack of rifle fire, indicating that the outposts were engaged with the enemy. Also, from the distance, could be heard the booming of the great German guns, and as the English advanced still further men began to fall before the deadly German artillery fire.  But the British did not falter; they plodded on as steadily as before. Then, after two hours of rapid marching, came the sudden command to halt. A moment later and a squadron of British cavalry came into view, retreating before a large force of Germans.  Just in front of the infantry the cavalry halted, and turned their faces toward the enemy. The advance of the British so far had not been discovered; but as the pursuing Germans came into view, the command to fire rang out.  There was a deafening crash as the British infantry hurled their messengers of death into the compact ranks of the foe; and under this deadly fire the British cavalry dashed forward. Before the Germans could recover from their surprise the English horsemen were upon them, striking, cutting, slashing.  It was deadly and terrible work and the English did not go unscathed. But struggling thus, hand to hand, the Germans were no match for the English. Now there came from behind the Germans a large force of infantry on the run, and before these reinforcements the British cavalry was forced to retire.  All this was happening right before the eyes of Hal and Chester, in the very center of the British line. On the right and left the engagement was of the same fierce kind, and the deafening crashes of rifles and artillery on either side gave conclusive evidence that the British were engaged with the enemy all along their entire front.  Still the German cavalry pursued the British cavalry in the center. Then General French turned suddenly to Hal:  \"Tell General Mayo to advance in force!\" he commanded.  The general turned to Chester:  \"Ask General Samson to bring his artillery into instant action!\"  The two lads dashed away on their respective missions; and almost immediately the results of these two commands were apparent.  As the German infantry advanced in the wake of their cavalry, the British came to sudden life. Flame burst out from all along the center and the Germans recoiled. Volley after volley was poured into the wavering ranks of the enemy, and they turned to flee.  A supporting column was rushed hurriedly to their assistance, and as they advanced the British artillery opened fire. Great holes were cut in the advancing German line, but their advance was unchecked. From their rear reinforcements were coming continually.  The fire of the British artillery and infantry was deadly. Men fell by the hundreds, were mowed down like chaff before the wind by the accuracy of the British fire. In the English ranks men also were dropping on all sides, but the gaps were filled up immediately and the British, singing and cheering, continued their advance.  The roar of battle could be heard for miles around, but the men engaged in the conflict were unconscious of it. They had but one sense left--that of sight--and their rifles continued to deal out death.  At length the German advance was checked, and then they began to fall back.  There was a rousing cheer from the English, and the advance was more rapid than before. The retreating Germans halted, turned to face the English, made a last desperate stand, then fled in disorder.  But as the English broke into a run to pursue their advantage still closer, they were met with a hail of bullets from a large force of the enemy's infantry which at that moment advanced, in support of their comrades, close enough to come into action.  The English reeled for a moment under this terrible fire, but they did not waver. Support was hurried to them. It was time for prompt action.  General French took in the situation at a glance and gave a quick command. A moment later the voices of the different officers rang out along the British line:  \"With the bayonet! Charge!\"     CHAPTER V.  THE CHARGE.   For the smallest fraction of a second there was an awesome silence, and then the British swept forward with a rush. Neither the bullets from the thousands of rifles nor the steady fire from the great guns of the German field batteries checked them.  The infantry covered the open space at a quick trot, and in almost less time than it takes to tell, it was at hand grips with the enemy, who stood braced to receive the shock of the charge.  The impact was terrific. The Germans stood gallantly to their work, encouraged by the shouts of their officers, but they were no match for the British troops in hand-to-hand fighting.  As the British closed upon them, the Germans poured in one fierce volley; but they had no time for more. Down went Teutons and English in struggling heaps, but the British poured over them and continued their deadly work.  All along the line the Germans gave ground slowly, their enemies pursuing them relentlessly and cutting them down as they retreated. The engagement became a slaughter.  Now Hal and Chester found themselves in the midst of the battle, in the fiercest of the "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12877"],["title","The First Hundred Thousand: Being the Unofficial Chronicle of a Unit of \"K(1)\" (#1)"],["body","square, without--  (1) Marching through another platoon.  (2) Losing any part or parts of itself.  (3) Adopting a formation which brings it face to face with a blank wall, or piles it up in a tidal wave upon the verandah, of the married quarters.  They could not have done that a week ago.  But stay, what is this disturbance on the extreme left? The command \"Right form\" has been given, but six files on the outside flank have ignored the suggestion, and are now advancing (in skirmishing order) straight for the ashbin outside the cookhouse door, looking piteously round over their shoulders for some responsible person to give them an order which will turn them about and bring them back to the fold. Finally they are rounded up by the platoon sergeant, and restored to the strength.  \"What went wrong, Sergeant?\" inquires Second Lieutenant Bobby Little. He is a fresh-faced youth, with an engaging smile. Three months ago he was keeping wicket for his school eleven.  The sergeant comes briskly to attention.  \"The order was not distinctly heard by the men, sir,\" he explains, \"owing to the corporal that passed it on wanting a tooth. Corporal Blain, three paces forward--march!\"  Corporal Blain steps forward, and after remembering to slap the small of his butt with his right hand, takes up his parable--  \"I was sittin' doon tae ma dinner on Sabbath, sir, when my front teeth met upon a small piece bone that was stickit' in--\"  Further details of this gastronomic tragedy are cut short by the blast of a whistle. The Colonel, at the other side of the square, has given the signal for the end of parade. Simultaneously a bugle rings out cheerfully from the direction of the orderly-room. Breakfast, blessed breakfast, is in sight. It is nearly eight, and we have been as busy as bees since six.  At a quarter to nine the battalion parades for a route-march. This, strange as it may appear, is a comparative rest. Once you have got your company safely decanted from column of platoons into column of route, your labours are at an end. All you have to do is to march; and that is no great hardship when you are as hard as nails, as we are fast becoming. On the march the mental gymnastics involved by the formation of an advanced guard or the disposition of a piquet line are removed to a safe distance. There is no need to wonder guiltily whether you have sent out a connecting-file between the vanguard and the main-guard, or if you remembered to instruct your sentry groups as to the position of the enemy and the extent of their own front.  Second Lieutenant Little heaves a contented sigh, and steps out manfully along the dusty road. Behind him tramp his men. We have no pipers as yet, but melody is supplied by \"Tipperary,\" sung in ragged chorus, varied by martial interludes upon the mouth-organ. Despise not the mouth-organ. Ours has been a constant boon. It has kept sixty men in step for miles on end.  Fortunately the weather is glorious. Day after day, after a sharp and frosty dawn, the sun swings up into a cloudless sky; and the hundred thousand troops that swarm like ants upon, the undulating plains of Hampshire can march, sit, lie, or sleep on hard, sun-baked earth. A wet autumn would have thrown our training back months. The men, as yet, possess nothing but the fatigue uniforms they stand up in, so it is imperative to keep them dry.  Tramp, tramp, tramp. \"Tipperary\" has died away. The owner of the mouth-organ is temporarily deflated. Here is an opportunity for individual enterprise. It is soon seized. A husky soloist breaks into one of the deathless ditties of the new Scottish Laureate; his comrades take up the air with ready response; and presently we are all swinging along to the strains of \"I Love a Lassie,\"--\"Roaming in the Gloaming\" and \"It's Just Like Being at Hame\" being rendered as encores.  Then presently come snatches of a humorously amorous nature--\"Hallo, Hallo, Who's Your Lady Friend?\"; \"You're my Baby\"; and the ungrammatical \"Who Were You With Last Night?\" Another great favourite is an involved composition which always appears to begin in the middle. It deals severely with the precocity of a youthful lover who has been detected wooing his lady in the Park. Each verse ends, with enormous gusto--    \"Hold your haand _oot_, you naughty boy!\"  Tramp, tramp, tramp. Now we are passing through a village. The inhabitants line the pavement and smile cheerfully upon us--they are always kindly disposed toward \"Scotchies\"--but the united gaze of the rank and file wanders instinctively from the pavement towards upper windows and kitchen entrances, where the domestic staff may be discerned, bunched together and giggling. Now we are out on the road again, silent and dusty. Suddenly, far in the rear, a voice of singular sweetness strikes up \"The Banks of Loch Lomond.\" Man after man joins in, until the swelling chorus runs from end to end of the long column. Half the battalion hail from the Loch Lomond district, and of the rest there is hardly a man who has not indulged, during some Trades' Holiday or other, in \"a pleesure trup\" upon its historic but inexpensive waters.    \"You'll tak' the high road and I'll tak' the low   road--\"  On we swing, full-throated. An English battalion, halted at a cross-road to let us go by, gazes curiously upon us. \"Tipperary\" they know, Harry Lauder they have heard of; but this song has no meaning for them. It is ours, ours, ours. So we march on. The feet of Bobby Little, as he tramps at the head of his platoon, hardly touch the ground. His head is in the air. One day, he feels instinctively, he will hear that song again, amid sterner surroundings. When that day comes, the song, please God, for all its sorrowful wording, will reflect no sorrow from the hearts of those who sing it--only courage, and the joy of battle, and the knowledge of victory.    \"--And I'll be in Scotland before ye.   But me and my true love will never meet again   On the bonny, bonny _baanks_--\"  A shrill whistle sounds far ahead. It means \"March at Attention.\" \"Loch Lomond\" dies away with uncanny suddenness--discipline is waxing stronger every day--and tunics are buttoned and rifles unslung. Three minutes later we swing demurely on to the barrack-square, across which a pleasant aroma of stewed onions is wafting, and deploy with creditable precision into the formation known as \"mass.\" Then comes much dressing of ranks and adjusting of distances. The Colonel is very particular about a clean finish to any piece of work.  Presently the four companies are aligned: the N.C.O.'s retire to the supernumerary ranks. The battalion stands rigid, facing a motionless figure upon horseback. The figure stirs.  \"Fall out, the officers!\"  They come trooping, stand fast, and salute--very smartly. We must set an example to the men. Besides, we are hungry too.  \"Battalion, slope _arms!_ Dis-_miss!_\"  Every man, with one or two incurable exceptions, turns sharply to his right and cheerfully smacks the butt of his rifle with his disengaged hand. The Colonel gravely returns the salute; and we stream away, all the thousand of us, in the direction of the savoury smell. Two o'clock will come round all too soon, and with it company drill and tiresome musketry exercises; but by that time we shall have _dined_, and Fate cannot touch us for another twenty-four hours.     III  GROWING PAINS   We have our little worries, of course.  Last week we were all vaccinated, and we did not like it. Most of us have \"taken\" very severely, which is a sign that we badly needed vaccinating, but makes the discomfort no easier to endure. It is no joke handling a rifle when your left arm is swelled to the full compass of your sleeve; and the personal contact of your neighbour in the ranks is sheer agony. However, officers are considerate, and the work is made as light as possible. The faint-hearted report themselves sick; but the Medical Officer, an unsentimental man of coarse mental fibre, who was on a panel before he heard his country calling, merely recommends them to get well as soon as possible, as they are going to be inoculated for enteric next week. So we grouse--and bear it.  There are other rifts within the military lute. At home we are persons of some consequence, with very definite notions about the dignity of labour. We have employers who tremble at our frown; we have Trades Union officials who are at constant pains to impress upon us our own omnipotence in the industrial world in which we live. We have at our beck and call a Radical M.P. who, in return for our vote and suffrage, informs us that we are the backbone of the nation, and that we must on no account permit ourselves to be trampled upon by the effete and tyrannical upper classes. Finally, we are Scotsmen, with all a Scotsman's curious reserve and contempt for social airs and graces.  But in the Army we appear to be nobody. We are expected to stand stiffly at attention when addressed by an officer; even to call him \"sir\"--an honour to which our previous employer has been a stranger. At home, if we happened to meet the head of the firm in the street, and none of our colleagues was looking, we touched a cap, furtively. Now, we have no option in the matter. We are expected to degrade ourselves by meaningless and humiliating gestures. The N.C.O.'s are almost as bad. If you answer a sergeant as you would a foreman, you are impertinent; if you argue with him, as all good Scotsmen must, you are insubordinate; if you endeavour to drive a collective bargain with him, you are mutinous; and you are reminded that upon active service mutiny is punishable by death. It is all very unusual and upsetting.  You may not spit; neither may you smoke a cigarette in the ranks, nor keep the residue thereof behind your ear. You may not take beer to bed with you. You may not postpone your shave till Saturday: you must shave every day. You must keep your buttons, accoutrements, and rifle speckless, and have your hair cut in a style which"]]]
