It was then about four o'clock of as pleasant an afternoon as I can ever remember. But the calmness of the sky, with its deep blue distance, seemed to shrivel me up into nothing. The world was so bright, and blue, and--uncaring!  I may have fallen asleep for a few minutes, for I thought I heard McKelvey saying, \"Dad always told me not to let this happen.\" Over and over again, I could hear this, but I don't know whether McKelvey had repeated it. My brain was like a phonograph that sticks at one word and says it over and over again until some one stops it.  I think it was Mudge, of Grand Forks, who came over to see how I was. His voice sounded thin and far away, and I didn't answer him. Then I felt him taking off my overcoat and finishing the bandaging that the German boy had begun.  Little Joe, the Italian boy, often told me afterwards how I looked at that time. \"All same dead chicken not killed right and kep' long time.\"  Here those who were not so badly wounded were marched on, but there were ten of us so badly hit we had to go very slowly. Percy Weller, one of the boys from Trail who enlisted when I did, was with us, and when we began the march I was behind him and noticed three holes in the back of his coat; the middle one was a horrible one made by shrapnel. He staggered painfully, poor chap, and his left eye was gone!  We passed a dead Canadian Highlander, whose kilt had pitched forward when he fell, and seemed to be covering his face.  In the first village we came to, they halted us, and we saw it was a dressing-station. The village was in ruins--even the town pump had had its head blown off!--and broken glass, pieces of brick, and plaster littered the one narrow street. The dressing was done in a two-room building which may have been a store. The walls were discolored and cracked, and the windows broken.  On a stretcher in the corner there lay a Canadian Highlander, from whose wounds the blood dripped horribly and gathered in a red pool on the dusty floor. His eyes were glazed and his face was drawn with pain. He talked unceasingly, but without meaning. The only thing I remember hearing him say was, \"It's no use, mother--it's no use!\"  Weller was attended to before I was, and marched on. While I sat there on an old tin pail which I had turned up for this purpose, two German officers came in, whistling. They looked for a minute at the dying Highlander in the corner, and one of them went over to him. He saw at once that his case was hopeless, and gave a short whistle as you do when blowing away a thistledown, indicating that he would soon be gone. I remember thinking that this was the German estimate of human life.  He came to me and said, \"Well, what have you got?\"  I thought he referred to my wound, and said, \"A shoulder wound.\" At which he laughed pleasantly and said, \"I am not interested in your wound; that's the doctor's business.\" Then I saw what he meant; it was souvenirs he was after. So I gave him my collar badge, and in return he gave me a German coin, and went over to the doctor and said something about me, for he flipped his finger toward me.  My turn came at last. The doctor examined my pay-book as well as my wound. I had forty-five francs in it, and when he took it out, I thought it was gone for sure. However, he carefully counted it before me, drawing my attention to the amount, and then returned it to me.  After my wound had been examined and a tag put on me stating what sort of treatment I was to have, I was taken away with half a dozen others and led down a narrow stone stair to a basement. Here on the cement floor were piles of straw, and the place was heated. The walls were dirty and discolored. One of the few pleasant recollections of my life in Germany has been the feeling of drowsy content that wrapped me about when I lay down on a pile of straw in that dirty, rat-infested basement. I forgot that I was a prisoner, that I was badly winged, that I was hungry, thirsty, dirty, and tired. I forgot all about my wounded companions and the Canadian Highlander, and all the suffering of the world, and drifted sweetly out into the wide ocean of sleep.  Some time during the night--for it was still dark--I felt some one kicking my feet and calling me to get up, and all my trouble and misery came back with a rush. My shoulder began to ache just where it left off, but I was so hungry that the thought of getting something to eat sustained me. Surely, I thought, they are going to feed us!  We were herded along the narrow street, out into a wide road, where we found an open car which ran on light rails in the centre of the road. It was like the picnic trolley cars which run in our cities in the warm weather. There were wounded German soldiers huddled together, and we sat down among them, wherever we could find the room, but not a word was spoken. I don't know whether they noticed who we were or not--they had enough to think about, not to be concerned with us, for most of them were terribly wounded. The one I sat beside leaned his head against my good shoulder and sobbed as he breathed. I could not help but think of the irony of war that had brought us together. For all I knew, he may have been the machine gunner who had been the means of ripping my shoulder to pieces--and it may have been a bullet from my rifle which had torn its way along his leg which now hung useless. Even so, there was no hard feeling between us, and he was welcome to the support of my good shoulder!  Some time through the night--my watch was broken and I couldn't tell the time exactly--we came to another village and got off the car. A guard came and carried off my companion, but as I could walk, I was left to unload myself. The step was high, and as my shoulder was very stiff and sore, I hesitated about jumping down. A big German soldier saw me, understood what was wrong, and lifted me gently down.  It was then nearly morning, for the dawn was beginning to show in the sky, and we were taken to an old church, where we were told to lie down and go to sleep. It was miserably cold in the church, and my shoulder ached fearfully. I tried hard to sleep, but couldn't manage it, and walked up and down to keep warm. I couldn't help but think of the strange use the church--which had been the scene of so many pleasant gatherings--was being put to, and as I leaned against the wall and looked out of the window, I seemed to see the gay and light-hearted Belgian people who so recently had gathered there. Right here, I thought, the bashful boys had stood, waiting to walk home with the girls... just the way we did in British Columbia, where one church I know well stands almost covered with the fragrant pines...  I fell into a pleasant reverie then of sunny afternoons and dewy moonlit nights, when the sun had gone over the mountains, and the stars came out in hundreds. My dream then began to have in it the brightest-eyed girl in the world, who gave me such a smile one Sunday when she came out of church... that I just naturally found myself walking beside her.... She had on a pink suit and white shoes, and wore a long string of black beads...  Then somebody spoke to me, and a sudden chill seized me and sent me into a spasm of coughing, and the pain of my shoulder shot up into my head like a knife... and I was back--all right--to the ruined church in Belgium, a prisoner of war in the hands of the Germans!  The person who spoke to me was a German cavalry officer, who quite politely bade me good-morning and asked me how I felt. I told him I felt rotten. I was both hungry and thirsty--and dirty and homesick. He laughed at that, as if it were funny, and asked me where I came from. When I told him, he said, \"You Canadians are terrible fools to fight with us when you don't have to. You'll be sick of it before you are through. Canada is a nice country, though,\" he went on; \"I've been in British Columbia, too, in the Government employ there--they treated me fine--and my brother is there now, engineer in the Dunsmuir Collieries at Ladysmith. Great people--the Canadians!\"  And he laughed again and said something in German to the officer who was with him.  When the sun came up and poured into the church, warming up its cold dreariness, I lay down and slept, for I had not nearly finished the sleep so comfortably begun in the basement the night before.  But in what seemed like three minutes, some one kicked my feet and called to me to get up. I got to my feet, still spurred by the hope of getting something to eat. Outside, all those who could walk were falling in, and I hastened to do the same. Our guards were mounted this time, and I noticed that their horses were small and in poor condition. We were soon out of the village and marching along a splendid road.  The day was bright and sunny, but a searching wind blew straight in our faces and made travelling difficult. It seemed to beat unmercifully on my sore shoulder, and I held my right wrist with my left hand, to keep the weight off my shoulder all I could.  I had not gone far when I began to grow weak and dizzy. The thirst was the worst; my tongue was dry and swollen, and it felt like a cocoa doormat. I could see rings of light wherever I looked, and the ground seemed to come up in waves. A guard who rode near me had a water-bottle beside him which dripped water. The cork was not in tight as it should have been, and the sight of these drops of water seemed to madden me. I begged him for a drink, and pointed to my parched tongue; but he refused, and rode ahead as if the sight of me annoyed him!  Ahead of us I could see the smoke of a large town, and I told myself over and over again that there would be lots of water there, and food and clean clothes, and in this way I kept myself alive until we reached Roulers.    CHAPTER III  INTO GERMANY   Roulers is a good-sized town in West Flanders, of about thirty thousand"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12881"],["title","Mrs. Budlong's Christmas Presents (#1)"],["body"," pathetic pictures of Oriental women who spent a year weaving a rug which would sell for a paltry hundred dollars and last a mere century or two.  Then she would cheerfully devote fifteen days of incessant stitching at something she carried round in a sort of drumhead.  At the end of that time she would have completed a more or less intolerable piece of colored fabric which she called a \"drape\" or a \"throw.\"  It could not be duplicated at a shop for less than $1.75, and it would wash perhaps three times.  Mr. Budlong once figured that if sweat-shop proprietors paid wages at the scale Mrs. Budlong established for herself, all the seamstresses and seamsters would curl up round their machines and die of starvation the first week.  But he never told Mrs. Budlong this. Fancy stitching did not earn much, but it did not cost much; and it kept her mysteriously contented.  She was stitching herself to her own home all the time.  The Christmas presents Mrs. Budlong made herself were not all a matter of needle and thread.  Not at all!  One year she turned her sewing room into a smithy.  She gave Mr. and Mrs. Doctor Tisnower the loveliest hand-hammered brass coal scuttle that ever was seen--and with a purple ribbon tied to its tail.  They kept flowers in it several summers, till one cruel winter a new servant put coal in it and completely scuttled it.  The same year she gave Mrs. ex-Mayor Cinnamon a hammered brass version of a C. D. Gibson drawing.  The lady and gentleman looked as if they had broken out with a combination of yellow fever and smallpox, or suffered from enlarged pores or something.  And the plum-colored plush frame didn't sit very well on the vermilion wall paper.  But Mrs. Cinnamon hung it over the sofa in the expectation of changing the paper some day.  It stayed there until the fateful evening when Mr. Nelson Chur called on Miss Editha Cinnamon and was just warming up a proposal that had held over almost as long as the wall paper, when bang! down came the overhanging brass drawing and bent itself hopelessly on Mr. Chur's skull.  Mr. Chur said something that may have been Damocles.  But he did not propose, and Mrs. Budlong was weeks wondering why Mrs. Cinnamon was so snippy to her.  The hammered brass era gave way to the opposite extreme of painted velvet.  They say it is a difficult art; and it may well be.  Mrs. Budlong's first landscape might as well have been painted on the side of her Scotch collie.  Her most finished roses had something of the look of shaggy tarantulas that had fallen into a paint pot and emerged in a towering rage.  It was in that velvetolene stratum that she painted for the church a tasseled pulpit cloth that hung down a yard below the Bible. Dr. Torpadie was a very soothing preacher, but no one slept o'sermons during the reign of that pulpit cloth.  Mrs. Budlong was so elated over the success of it, however, that she announced her intention of going in for stained glass.  She planned a series of the sweetest windows to replace those already in the church.  But she never got nearer to that than painted china.  The painted china era was a dire era.  The cups would break and the colors would run, and they never came out what she expected after they were fired.  Of course she knew that the pigments must suffer alteration in the furnace, but there was always a surprise beyond surprise.  She soon became accustomed to getting green roses with crimson leaves, and deep blue apple blossoms against a pure white sky, but when she finished one complete set of table china in fifty pieces, each cup and saucer with a flower on it, the result looked so startlingly like something from a medical museum, that she never dared give the set away.  She lent it to the cook to eat her meals on.  The set went fast.  During this epoch Master Ulysses Budlong Jr. was studying at school a physiology ornamented with a few pictures in color representing the stomachs of alcohol specialists.  They were intended, perhaps, to frighten little school children from frequenting saloons during recess, or to warn them not to put whisky on their porridge.  It was at this time that Mrs. Budlong spent two weeks' hard labor painting Easter lilies on an umbrella jug.  When it came home from the furnace, her husband stared at it and mumbled:  \"It's artistic, but what is it?\"  Little Ulysses shrieked: \"Oh, I know!\" and darting away, returned with his physiology opened at one of those gastric sunsets, and--well, it was this that impelled Mrs. Budlong to a solemn pledge never to paint china again--a pledge she has nobly kept.  From smeared china she went to that art in which a woman buys something at a store, pulls out half of it, and calls the remnant drawn work.  A season of this was succeeded by a mania for sofa cushions.  It fairly snowed sofa cushions all over Carthage that Christmas; and Yale, Harvard and Princeton pillows could be found in homes that had never known even a night school alumnus.  There ensued a sober period of burnt wood and a period of burnt leather, during which excited neighbors with a keen sense of smell called the fire department three times and the board of health once. And now Indian heads broke out all over town and the walls looked as if a shoemaker's apron had been chosen for the national pennant.  There were various other spasms of manufacture, each of them fashionable at its time and foolish at anytime.  As Mr. Detwiller said:  \"Somebody ought to write a history of Mrs. Budlong's Christmas presents.  It would tell the complete story of all the darned fool fads that American women have been up to for twenty years.\"  But foolish soever, Mrs. Budlong was fair.  A keen sense of sportsmanship led her to give full notice to such people as she planned to honor with her gifts.  She knew how embarrassing it is to receive presents from one to whom no present has been sent, and she made it a point of honor somehow to forewarn her prospective beneficiaries betimes.  Her favorite method was the classic device of pretending to let slip a secret.  For instance:  \"Yesterday morning, my dear, I had the Strangest exPerience.  It was just ten o'clock.  I remember the hour so exactly because for the last few days I have made it a rule to begin work on your Christmas present just at ten--Oh, but I didn't mean to tell you.  It was to be a surprise.  No, don't ask me, I won't give you an inkling, but I really think it will please you.  It's something you've been needing for Such a long time.\"  And she left the victim to writhe from then on to Christmas, trying alternately to imagine what gift was impending and what would be an appropriate counter-gift.     III  MISTRESS OF THE REVELS  In more ways than one Mrs. Budlong kept Carthage on the writhe. Christmas was merely the climax of a ceaseless activity.  All the year round she was at work like a yeast alert in a soggy dough.  She was forever getting up things.  She was one of those terrible women who return calls on time or a little ahead.  That made it necessary for you to return hers earlier.  If you didn't, she called you up on the telephone and asked you why you hadn't.  You had to promise to come over at once or she'd talk to you till your ear was welded to the telephone.  Then if you broke your promise she called you up about that.  She got in from fifty-two to a hundred and four calls a year, where one or two would have amply sufficed for all she had to say.  It was due to her that Carthage had such a lively social existence--for its size.  Once, when she fell ill, the people felt suddenly as passengers feel when a street car is suddenly braked back on its haunches.  All Carthage found itself wavering and poised on tiptoe and clinging to straps; and then it sogged back on its heels and waited till the car should resume progress.  Mrs. Budlong was the town's motorman--or \"motorneer,\" as they say in Carthage.  Before she was out of bed, she had invitations abroad for a convalescent tea, and everybody said, \"Here we go again!\"  If strangers visited Carthage, Mrs. Budlong counted them her clients the moment they arrived.  Of course, the merely commercial visitors she left to the hackmen at the station, but friends or relatives of prominent people could not escape Mrs. Budlong's well-meant attentions.  It was sometimes embarrassing when relatives appeared--for everybody has Concealed Relatives that he is perfectly willing to leave in concealment.  Mrs. Alex. (pronounced Ellick) Stubblebine never forgave Mrs. Budlong for dragging into the limelight some obscure cousins of her husband's who had drifted into Carthage to borrow money on their farm.  Mrs. Stubblebine was always bragging about her people, her own people that is.  Her husband's people, of course, were after all only Stubblebines, while her maiden name was Dilatush; and the Dilatushes, as everybody knew, were related by marriage to the Tatums.  But these were Stubblebines that came to town.  Mrs. Stubblebine could hardly slam the door in their faces, but she would fain have locked the doors after them.  She would not even invite them out on the front porch.  She told them the back porch was cosier and less conspicuous.  And then Mrs. Budlong had to call up on the telephone and sing out in her telephoniest tone:  \"Oh, my dear, I've just this minute heard you have guests--some of your dear husband's relatives.  Now they must come to me to dinner to-morrow.  Oh, it isn't the slightest trouble, I asSure you.  I'm giving a little party anyway.  I won't take no for an answer.\"  And she wouldn't.  Mrs. Stubblebine fairly perspired excuses, but Mrs. Budlong finally grew so suspicious that she had to accept; or leave the impression that the relatives were burglars or counterfeiters in hiding.  And they were not--they were pitifully honest.  The result was even worse than she feared.  Mr. Stubblebine's cousin was so shy that he never said a word except when it was pulled out of him, and then he said, \"Yes, ma'am\"!  "]]]
