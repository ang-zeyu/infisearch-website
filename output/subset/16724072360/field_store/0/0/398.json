Delirious days when military bands blared regiment after regiment through lines of cheering thousands; whole companies deluged with flowers, long military trains festooned with blossoms and greenery rolling with clock-like regularity from the stations amid thunderous cheers.  Sad partings were almost unknown, for, of course, no earthly power could withstand the onslaughts of the Kaiser's troops.  God was with them--even their belts and helmets showed that.  So, \"Good-bye for six weeks!\"  The 2nd of September is Sedan Day, and in 1914 it was celebrated as never before.  A great parade was scheduled, a parade which would show German prowess.  Though I arrived in \"Unter den Linden\" two hours before the procession was due, I could not get anywhere near the broad central avenue down which it would pass.  I chartered a taxi which had foundered in the throng, and perched on top.  The Government, always attentive to the patriotic education of the children, had given special orders for such occasions.  The little ones were brought to the front by the police, and boys were even permitted to climb the sacred Linden trees that they might better see what the Fatherland had done.  The triumphal column entered through the Kaiser Arch of the Brandenburger Tor, and bedlam broke loose during the passing of the captured cannon of Russia, France, and Belgium--these last cast by German workmen at Essen and fired by Belgian artillerists against German soldiers at Liege.  The gates of Paris!  Then the clear-cut German official reports became vague for a few days about the West, but had much of Hindenburg and victory in the East.  Democracies wash their dirty linen in public, while absolute governments tuck theirs out of sight, where it usually disappears, but sometimes unexpectedly develops spontaneous combustion.  Nobody--outside of the little circle--questioned the delay in entering Paris.  Everything was going according to plan, was the saying.  I suppose sheep entertain a somewhat similar attitude when their leader conducts them over a precipice.  Antwerp must be taken first--that was the key to Paris and London.  Such was the gossip when the scene was once more set in Belgium, and the great Skoda mortars pulverised forts which on paper were impregnable.  Many a time during the first days of October I left my glass of beer or cup of tea half finished and rushed from cafe and restaurant with the crowd to see if the newspaper criers of headlines were announcing the fall of the fortress on the Scheldt, How those people discussed the terms of the coming early peace, terms which were not by any means easy!  Berlin certainly had its thumbs turned down on the rest of Europe.  With two other Americans I sat with a group of prosperous Berliners in their luxurious club.  Waiters moved noiselessly over costly rugs and glasses clinked, while these men seriously discussed the probable terms Germany would soon impose on a conquered continent. Belgium would, of course, be incorporated into the German Empire, and Antwerp would be the chief outlet for Germany's commerce--and how that commerce would soon boom at the expense of Great Britain! France would now have an opportunity to develop her socialistic experiments, as she would be permitted to maintain only a very small army.  The mistake of 1870 must not be repeated.  This time there would be no paltry levy of five billion francs.  A great German Empire would rise on the ruins of the British.  Commercial gain was the theme.  I did not gather from the conversation that anybody but Germany would be a party to the peace.  A man in close touch with things military entered at midnight.  His eyes danced as he gave us new information about Antwerp.   Clearly the city was doomed.  I did not sleep that night.  I packed.  Next evening I was in Holland.  I saw a big story, hired a car, picked up a _Times_ courier, and, after \"fixing\" things with the Dutch guards, dashed for Antwerp.  The long story of a retreat with the rearguard of the Belgian Army has no place here.  But there were scenes which contrasted with the boasting, confident, joyous capital I had left. Belgian horses drawing dejected families, weeping on their household goods, other families with everything they had saved bundled in a tablecloth or a handkerchief.  Some had their belongings tied on a bicycle, others trundled wheel-barrows. Valuable draught dogs, harnessed, but drawing no cart, were led by their masters, while other dogs that nobody thought of just followed along.  And tear-drenched faces everywhere.  Back in Bergen-op-Zoom and Putten I had seen chalk writing on brick walls saying that members of certain families had gone that way and would wait in certain designated places for other members who chanced to pass.  On the road, now dark, and fringed with pines, I saw a faint light flicker.  A group passed, four very old women tottering after a very old man, he holding a candle before him to light the way.  As I jotted down these things and handed them to my courier I thought of the happy faces back in Berlin, of jubilant crowds dashing from restaurants and cafes as each newspaper edition was shouted out, and I knew that the men in the luxurious club were figuring out to what extent they could mulct Belgium.  I pressed on in the dark and joined the Belgian army and the British Naval Brigade falling back before the Germans.  I came upon an American, now captain of a Belgian company.  \"It's a damn shame, and I hate to admit it,\" he said, \"but the Allies are done for.\" That is the way it looked to us in the black hours of the retreat.  Soldiers were walking in their sleep.  Some sank, too exhausted to continue.  An English sailor, a tireless young giant, trudged on mile after mile with a Belgian soldier on his back.  Both the Belgian's feet had been shot off and tightly bound handkerchiefs failed to check the crimson trail.  London and Paris were gloomy, but Berlin was basking in the bright morning sunshine of the war.   Although the fronts were locked during the winter, the German authorities had good reason to feel optimistic about the coming spring campaign.  They knew that they had increased their munition output enormously, and their spies told them that Russia had practically run out of ammunition, while England had not yet awakened to the realisation that this is a war of shells.  The public saw the result in the spring.  The armies of the Tsar fell back all along the line, while in Germany the flags were waving and the bells of victory were pealing.  All through this there was unity in Germany, a unity that the Germans felt and gloried in.  \"No other nation acts as one man in this wonderful time as do we Germans,\" they told the stranger again and again.  Unity and Germany became synonymous in my mind.  Love of country and bitterness against the enemy are intensified in a nation going to war.  It is something more than this, however, which has imbued and sustained the flaming spirit of Germany during this war.  In July, 1914, the Government deliberately set out to overcome two great forces.  The first was the growing section of her anti-militaristic citizens, and the second was the combination of Great Powers which she made up her mind she must fight sooner or later if she would gain that place in the sun which had dazzled her so long.  Her success against the opposition within her was phenomenal. Germany was defending herself against treacherous attack--that was the watchword.  The Social Democrats climbed upon the band-waggon along with the rest for the joy-ride to victory, and they remained on the band-waggon for more than a year--then some of them dropped off.  The story of how all Germans were made to think as one man is a story of one of the greatest phenomena of history.  It is my purpose in the next few chapters to show how the German Government creates unity.  Then, in later chapters, I will describe the forces tending to disintegrate that wonderful unity.  Germany entered the war with the Government in control of all the forces affecting public opinion.  The only way in which newspaper editors, reporters, lecturers, professors, teachers, theatre managers, and pulpit preachers could hope to accomplish, anything in the world was to do something to please the Government.  To displease the Government meant to be silenced or to experience something worse.     CHAPTER III  THE CRIME AGAINST THE CHILDREN  The boys and girls of Germany play an important part in _die grosse Zeit_ (this great wartime).  Every atom of energy that can be dragged out of the children has been put to practical purpose.  Their little souls, cursed by \"incubated hate,\" have been so worked upon by the State schoolmasters that they have redoubled their energies in the tasks imposed upon them of collecting gold, copper, nickel, brass, paper, acorns, blackberries, blueberries, rubber, woollen and war loan money.  All this summer on release from school, which commences at seven and closes at three in most parts of Germany, the hours varying in some districts, the children, in organised squads, have been put to these important purposes of State.  They had much to do with the getting in of the harvest.  The schoolmaster has played his part in the training of the child to militarism, State worship, and enemy hatred as effectively as the professor and the clergyman.  Here are two German children's school songs, that are being sung daily.  Both of them are creations of the war: both written by schoolmasters.  The particularly offensive song about King Edward and England is principally sung by girls--the future mothers of Germany:--    O England, O England,   Wie gross sind Deine Lugen!   Ist Dein Verbrechen noch so gross,   Du schwindelst Dich vom Galgen los.

They are free certainly, but they are also degraded, rejected, the offscum and the offscouring of the very dregs of your society; they are free from the chain, the whip, the enforced task and unpaid toil of slavery; but they are not the less under a ban. Their kinship with slaves for ever bars them from a full share of the freeman's inheritance of equal rights, and equal consideration and respect. All hands are extended to thrust them out, all fingers point at their dusky skin, all tongues--the most vulgar, as well as the self-styled most refined--have learnt to turn the very name of their race into an insult and a reproach. How, in the name of all that is natural, probable, possible, should the spirit and energy of any human creature support itself under such an accumulation of injustice and obloquy? Where shall any mass of men be found with power of character and mind sufficient to bear up against such a weight of prejudice? Why, if one individual rarely gifted by heaven were to raise himself out of such a slough of despond, he would be a miracle; and what would be his reward? Would he be admitted to an equal share in your political rights?--would he ever be allowed to cross the threshold of your doors?--would any of you give your daughter to his son, or your son to his daughter?--would you, in any one particular, admit him to the footing of equality which any man with a white skin would claim, whose ability and worth had so raised him from the lower degrees of the social scale. You would turn from such propositions with abhorrence, and the servants in your kitchen and stable--the ignorant and boorish refuse of foreign populations, in whose countries no such prejudice exists, imbibing it with the very air they breathe here--would shrink from eating at the same table with such a man, or holding out the hand of common fellowship to him. Under the species of social proscription in which the blacks in your Northern cities exist, if they preserved energy of mind, enterprise of spirit, or any of the best attributes and powers of free men, they would prove themselves, instead of the lowest and least of human races, the highest and first, not only of all that do exist, but of all that ever have existed; for they alone would seek and cultivate knowledge, goodness, truth, science, art, refinement, and all improvement, purely for the sake of their own excellence, and without one of those incentives of honour, power, and fortune, which are found to be the chief, too often the only, inducements which lead white men to the pursuit of the same objects.  You know very well dear E----, that in speaking of the free blacks of the North I here state nothing but what is true and of daily experience. Only last week I heard, in this very town of Philadelphia, of a family of strict probity and honour, highly principled, intelligent, well-educated, and accomplished, and (to speak the world's language) respectable in every way--i.e. _rich_. Upon an English lady's stating it to be her intention to visit these persons when she came to Philadelphia, she was told that if she did nobody else would visit _her_; and she probably would excite a malevolent feeling, which might find vent in some violent demonstration against this family. All that I have now said of course bears only upon the condition of the free coloured population of the North, with which I am familiar enough to speak confidently of it. As for the slaves, and their capacity for progress, I can say nothing, for I have never been among them to judge what faculties their unhappy social position leaves to them unimpaired. But it seems to me, that no experiment on a sufficiently large scale can have been tried for a sufficient length of time to determine the question of their incurable inferiority. Physiologists say that three successive generations appear to be necessary to produce an effectual change of constitution (bodily and mental), be it for health or disease. There are positive physical defects which produce positive mental ones; the diseases of the muscular and nervous systems descend from father to son. Upon the agency of one corporal power how much that is not corporal depends; from generation to generation internal disease and external deformity, vices, virtues, talents, and deficiencies are transmitted, and by the action of the same law it must be long indeed before the offspring of slaves--creatures begotten of a race debased and degraded to the lowest degree, themselves born in slavery, and whose progenitors have eaten the bread and drawn the breath of slavery for years--can be measured, with any show of justice, by even the least favoured descendants of European nations, whose qualities have been for centuries developing themselves under the beneficent influence of freedom, and the progress it inspires.  I am rather surprised at the outbreak of violent disgust which Mr. ---- indulges in on the subject of amalgamation; as that formed no part of our discussion, and seems to me a curious subject for abstract argument. I should think the intermarrying between blacks and whites a matter to be as little insisted upon if repugnant, as prevented if agreeable to the majority of the two races. At the same time, I cannot help being astonished at the furious and ungoverned execration which all reference to the possibility of a fusion of the races draws down upon those who suggest it; because nobody pretends to deny that, throughout the South, a large proportion of the population is the offspring of white men and coloured women. In New Orleans, a class of unhappy females exists whose mingled blood does not prevent their being remarkable for their beauty, and with whom no man, no _gentleman_, in that city shrinks from associating; and while the slaveowners of the Southern States insist vehemently upon the mental and physical inferiority of the blacks, they are benevolently doing their best, in one way at least, to raise and improve the degraded race, and the bastard population which forms so ominous an element in the social safety of their cities certainly exhibit in their forms and features the benefit they derive from their white progenitors. It is hard to conceive that some mental improvement does not accompany this physical change. Already the finer forms of the European races are cast in these dusky moulds: the outward configuration can hardly thus improve without corresponding progress in the inward capacities. The white man's blood and bones have begotten this bronze race, and bequeathed to it in some degree qualities, tendencies, capabilities, such as are the inheritance of the highest order of human animals. Mr. ---- (and many others) speaks as if there were a natural repugnance in all whites to any alliance with the black race; and yet it is notorious, that almost every Southern planter has a family more or less numerous of illegitimate coloured children. Most certainly, few people would like to assert that such connections are formed because it is the _interest_ of these planters to increase the number of their human property, and that they add to their revenue by the closest intimacy with creatures that they loathe, in order to reckon among their wealth the children of their body. Surely that is a monstrous and unnatural supposition, and utterly unworthy of belief. That such connections exist commonly, is a sufficient proof that they are not abhorrent to nature; but it seems, indeed, as if marriage (and not concubinage) was the horrible enormity which cannot be tolerated, and against which, moreover, it has been deemed expedient to enact laws. Now it appears very evident that there is no law in the white man's nature which prevents him from making a coloured woman the mother of his children, but there _is_ a law on his statute books forbidding him to make her his wife; and if we are to admit the theory that the mixing of the races is a monstrosity, it seems almost as curious that laws should be enacted to prevent men marrying women towards whom they have an invincible natural repugnance, as that education should by law be prohibited to creatures incapable of receiving it. As for the exhortation with which Mr. ---- closes his letter, that I will not 'go down to my husband's plantation prejudiced against what I am to find there,' I know not well how to answer it. Assuredly I _am_ going prejudiced against slavery, for I am an Englishwoman, in whom the absence of such a prejudice would be disgraceful. Nevertheless, I go prepared to find many mitigations in the practice to the general injustice and cruelty of the system--much kindness on the part of the masters, much content on that of the slaves; and I feel very sure that you may rely upon the carefulness of my observation, and the accuracy of my report, of every detail of the working of the thing that comes under my notice; and certainly, on the plantation to which I am going, it will be more likely that I should some things extenuate, than set down aught in malice.  Yours ever faithfully.         *       *       *       *       *   Darien, Georgia.  Dear E----. Minuteness of detail, and fidelity in the account of my daily doings, will hardly, I fear, render my letters very interesting to you now; but cut off as I am here from all the usual resources and amusements of civilised existence, I shall find but little to communicate to you that is not furnished by my observations on the novel appearance of external nature, and the moral and physical condition of Mr. ----'s people. The latter subject is, I know, one sufficiently interesting in itself to you, and I shall not scruple to impart all the reflections which may occur to me relative to their state during my stay here, where enquiry into their mode of existence will form my chief occupation, and, necessarily also, the staple commodity of my letters.
