A magical entertainment may be a very common affair to my young readers in the city, but in a country village it is an event. Pentonville was too small to have any regular place of amusement, and its citizens were obliged to depend upon traveling performers, who, from time to time, engaged the Town Hall.  Some time had elapsed since there had been any such entertainment, and Prof. Harrington was the more likely to be well patronized.  Ben, who had the love of amusement common to boys of his age, had been regretting the necessity of remaining in the store till nine o'clock, and therefore losing his share of amusement when, as we have seen, an opportunity suddenly offered.  \"I am glad I met the tramp, after all,\" he said to himself.  \"He has brought me luck.\"  At supper he told is mother what had befallen him, but she tool a more serious view of it than he did.  \"He might have murdered you, Ben,\" she said with a shudder.  \"Oh, no; he wouldn't do that.  He might have stolen Mr. Crawford's money; that was the most that was likely to happen.\"  \"I didn't think there were highwaymen about here.  Now I shall be worrying about you.\"  \"Don't do that mother; I don't feel in any danger.  Still, if you think it best, I will carry a pistol.\"  \"No, no, Ben!  it might go off and kill you.  I would rather run the risk of a highwayman.  I wonder if the man is prowling about in the neighborhood yet?\"  \"I don't think my bogus dollar will carry him very far.  By the way, mother, I must tell yon one strange thing.  He asked me if I was John Barclay's son.\"  \"What!\" exclaimed Mrs. Barclay, in a tone of great surprise.  \"Did he know your name was Barclay?\"  \"Not till I told him.  Then it was he asked if I was the son of John Barclay.\"  \"Did he say he knew your father?\"  \"I asked him, but he answered evasively.\"  \"He might have seen some resemblance--that is, if he had ever met your father.  Ah!  it was a sad day for us all when your poor father died. We should have been in a very different position,\" the widow sighed.  \"Yes, mother,\" said Ben; \"but when I get older I will try to supply my father's place, and relieve you from care and trouble.\"  \"You are doing that in a measure now, my dear boy,\" said Mrs. Barclay affectionately.  \"You are a great comfort to me.\"  Ben's answer was to go up to his mother and kiss her.  Some boys of his age are ashamed to show their love for the mother who is devoted to them, but it a false shame, that does them no credit.  \"Still, mother, you work too hard,\" said Ben.  \"Wait till I am a man, and you shall not need to work at all.\"  Mrs. Barclay had been a widow for five years.  Her husband had been a commercial traveler, but had contracted a fever at Chicago, and died after a brief illness, without his wife having the satisfaction of ministering to him in his last days.  A small sum due him from his employers was paid over to his family, but no property was discovered, though his wife had been under the impression that her husband possessed some.  He had never been in the habit of confiding his business affairs to her, and so, if he had investments of any kind, she could not learn anything about them.  She found herself, therefore, with no property except a small cottage, worth, with its quarter acre of land, perhaps fifteen hundred dollars.  As Ben was too small to earn anything, she had been compelled to raise about seven hundred dollars on mortgage, which by this time had been expended for living.  Now, Ben was earning four dollars a week, and, with her own earnings, she was able to make both ends meet without further encroachments upon her scanty property; but the mortgage was a source of anxiety to her, especially as it was held by Squire Davenport, a lawyer of considerable means, who was not overscrupulous about the methods by which he strove to increase his hoards.  Should he at any time take it into his head to foreclose, there was no one to whom Mrs. Barclay could apply to assume the mortgage, and she was likely to be compelled to sacrifice her home.  He had more than once hinted that he might need the money but as yet had gone no further.  Mrs. Barclay had one comfort, however, and a great one.  This was a good son.  Ben was always kind to his mother--a bright, popular, promising boy--and though at present he was unable to earn much, in a few years he would be able to earn a good income, and then his mother knew that she would be well provided for.  So she did not allow herself to borrow trouble but looked forward hopefully, thanking God for what He had given her.  \"Won't you go up to the Town Hall with me, mother?\" asked Ben.  I am sure you would enjoy it.\"  \"Thank you, Ben, for wishing me to have a share in your amusements,\" his mother replied, \"but I have a little headache this evening, and I shall be better off at home.\"  \"It isn't on account of the expense you decline, mother, is it?  You know Mr. Crawford gave me a dollar, and the tickets are but twenty-five cents.\"  \"No, it isn't that, Ben.  If it were a concert I might be tempted to go in spite of my headache, but a magical entertainment would not amuse me as much as it will you.\"  \"Just as you think best, mother; but I should like to have you go. You won't feel lonely, will you?\"  \"I am used to being alone till nine o'clock, when you are at the store.\"  This conversation took place at the supper table.  Ben went directly from the store to the Town Hall, where he enjoyed himself as much as he anticipated.  If he could have foreseen how his mother was to pass that evening, it would have destroyed all is enjoyment.     CHAPTER III MRS. BARCLAY'S CALLERS   About half-past eight o'clock Mrs. Barclay sat with her work in her hand.  Her headache was better, but she did not regret not having accompanied Ben to the Town Hall.  \"I am glad Ben is enjoying himself,\" she thought, \"but I would rather stay quietly at home.  Poor boy!  he works hard enough, and needs recreation now and then.\"  Just then a knock was heard at the outside door.  \"I wonder who it can be?\" thought the widow.  \"I supposed everybody would be at the Town Hall.  It may be Mrs. Perkins come to borrow something.\"  Mrs. Perkins was a neighbor much addicted to borrowing, which was rather disagreeable, but might have been more easily tolerated but that she seldom returned the articles lent.  Mrs. Barclay went to the door and opened it, fully expecting to see her borrowing neighbor.  A very different person met her view.  The ragged hat, the ill-looking face, the neglected attire, led her to recognize the tramp whom Ben had described to her as having attempted to rob him in the afternoon.  Terrified, Mrs. Barclay's first impulse was to shut the door and bolt it.  But her unwelcome visitor was too quick for her.  Thrusting his foot into the doorway, he interposed an effectual obstacle in the way of shutting the door.  \"No, you don't, ma'am!\" he said, with as laugh.  \"I understand your little game.  You want to shut me out.\"  \"What do you want?\" asked the widow apprehensively.  \"What do I want?\" returned the tramp.  \"Well, to begin with, I want something to eat--and drink,\" he added, after a pause.  \"Why don't you go to the tavern?\" asked Mrs. Barclay, anxious for him to depart.  \"Well, I can't afford it.  All the money I've got is a bogus dollar your rogue of a son gave me this afternoon.\"  \"You stole it from him,\" said the widow indignantly.  \"What's the odds if I did.  It ain't of no value.  Come, haven't you anything to eat in the house?  I'm hungry as a wolf.\"  \"And you look like one!\" thought Mrs. Barclay, glancing at his unattractive features; but she did not dare to say it.  There seemed no way of refusing, and she was glad to comply with his request, if by so doing she could soon get rid of him.  \"Stay here,\" she said, \"and I'll bring you some bread and butter and cold meat.\"  \"Thank you, I'd rather come in,\" said the tramp, and he pushed his way through the partly open door.  She led the way uneasily into the kitchen just in the rear of the sitting room where she had been seated.  \"I wish Ben was here,\" she said to herself, with sinking heart.  The tramp seated himself at the kitchen table, while Mrs. Barclay, going to the pantry, brought out part of a loaf of bread, and butter, and a few slices of cold beef, which she set before him.  Without ceremony he attacked the viands and ate as if half famished.  When about half through, he turned to the widow, and asked:  \"Haven't you some whisky in the house?\"  \"I never keep any,\" answered Mrs. Barclay.  \"Rum or gin, then?\"  I ain't partic'lar.  I want something to warm me up.\"  \"I keep no liquor of any kind.  I don't approve of drink, or want Ben to touch it.\"  \"Oh, you belong to the cold water army, do you?\" said the tramp with a sneer.  \"Give me some coffee, then.\"  \"I have no fire, and cannot prepare any.\"  \"What have you got, then?\" demanded than unwelcome guest impatiently.  \"I can give you a glass of excellent well water.\"  \"[illegible] Do you want to choke me?\" returned the tramp in disgust.  \"Suppose I mix you some molasses and water,\" suggested the widow, anxious to propitiate her dangerous guest.  \"Humph!  Well, that will do, if you've got nothing better.  Be quick about it, for my throat is parched.\"  As soon as possible the drink was prepared and set beside his plate. He drained it at a draught, and called for a second glass, which was supplied him.  Presently, for all things must have an end, the tramp's appetite seemed to be satisfied.  He threw himself back in his chair, stretched his legs, and, with his hands in his pockets, fixed his eyes on the widow.  \"I feel better,\" he said.  \"I am glad to hear it,\" said Mrs. Barclay.  \"Now, if you'll be kind enough, leave the house, for I expect Ben back before long.\"  \"And you don't want him to get hurt,\" laughed the tramp.  \"Well, I do owe him a flogging for a trick he played on me.\"  \"Oh, pray, go away!\" said Mrs. Barclay, apprehensively.  \"I have given"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10724"],["title","The Store Boy (#2)"],["body"," some supper, and that ought to satisfy you.\"  \"I can't go away till I've talked to you a little on business.\"  \"Business!  What business can you have with me?\"  \"More than you think.  You are the widow of John Barclay, ain't you?\"  \"Yes; did you know my husband?\"  \"Yes; that is, I saw something of him just before he died.\"  \"Can you tell me anything about his last moments?\" asked the widow, forgetting the character of her visitor, and only thinking of her husband.  \"No, that isn't in my line.  I ain't a doctor nor yet a minister.  I say, did he leave any money?\"  \"Not that we have been able to find out.  He owned this hone, but left no other property.\"  \"That you know of,\" said the tramp, significantly.  \"Do you know of any?\" asked Mrs. Barclay eagerly.  \"How did you happen to know him?\"  \"I was the barkeeper in the hotel where he died.  It was a small house, not one of your first-class hotels.\"  \"My husband was always careful of his expenses.  He did not spend money unnecessarily.  With his prudence we all thought he must have some investments, but we could discover none.\"  \"Have you got any money in the house?\" asked the tramp, with seeming abruptness.  \"Why do you ask?\" returned the widow, alarmed.  \"Surely, you would not rob me?\"  \"No, I don't want to rob you.  I want to sell you something.\"  \"I don't care to buy.  It takes all our money for necessary expenses.\"  \"You don't ask what I have to sell.\"  \"No, because I cannot buy it, whatever it may be.\"  \"It is--a secret,\" said the tramp.  \"A secret!\" repeated Mrs. Barclay, bewildered.  \"Yes, and a secret worth buying.  Your husband wasn't so poor as you think.  He left stock and papers representing three thousand dollars, and I am the only man who can put you in the way of getting it.\"  Mrs. Barclay was about to express her surprise, when a loud knock was head at the outer door.  \"Who's that?\" demanded the tramp quickly.  \"Is it the boy?\"  \"No, he would not knock.\"  \"Then, let me get out of this,\" he said, leaping to his feet.  \"Isn't there a back door?\"  \"Yes, there it is.\"  He hurried to the door, unbolted it, and made his escape into the open beyond the house, just as the knock was repeated.  Confused by what she had heard, and the strange conduct of her visitor, the widow took the lamp and went to the door.  To her surprise she found on opening it, two visitors, in one of whom she recognized Squire Davenport, already referred to as holding a mortgage on her house.  The other was a short, dark-complexioned man, who looked like a mechanic.  \"Excuse me the lateness of my call, Mrs. Barclay,\" said the squire smoothly.  \"I come on important business.  This is Mr. Kirk, a cousin of my wife.\"  \"Walk in, gentlemen,\" said Mrs. Barclay.  \"This is night of surprises,\" she thought to herself.     CHAPTER IV UNPLEASANT BUSINESS   It was now nine o'clock, rather a late hour for callers in the country, and Mrs. Barclay waited not without curiosity to hear the nature of the business which had brought her two visitors at that time.  \"Take seats, gentlemen,\" she said, with the courtesy habitual to her.  Squire Davenport, who was disposed to consider that he had a right to the best of everything, seated himself in the rocking-chair, and signed his companion to a cane chair beside him.  \"Mr. Kirk,\" he commenced, \"is thinking of coming to Pentonville to live.\"  \"I am glad to hear it,\" said Mrs. Barclay politely.  Perhaps she would not have said this if she had known what was coming next.  \"He is a carpenter,\" continued the squire, \"and, as we have none in the village except old Mr. Wade, who is superannuated, I think he will find enough to do to keep him busy.\"  \"I should think so,\" assented the widow.  \"If he does not, I can employ him a part of the time on my land.\"  \"What has all this to do with me?\" thought Mrs. Barclay.  She soon learned.  \"Of course he will need a house,\" pursued the squire, \"and as his family is small, he thinks this house will just suit him.\"  \"But I don't wish to sell,\" said the widow hurriedly.  \"I need this house for Ben and myself.\"  \"You could doubtless find other accommodations.  I dare say you could hire a couple of rooms from Elnathan Perkins.\"  \"I wouldn't live in that old shell,\" said Mrs. Barclay rather indignantly, \"and I am sure Ben wouldn't.\"  \"I apprehend Benjamin will have no voice in the matter,\" said Squire Davenport stiffly.  \"He is only a boy.\"  \"He is my main support, and my main adviser,\" said Mrs. Barclay, with spirit, \"and I shall not take any step which is disagreeable to him.\"  Mr. Kirk looked disappointed, but the squire gave him an assuring look, as the widow could see.  \"Perhaps you may change your mind,\" said the squire significantly.  \"I am under the impression that I hold a mortgage on this property.\"  \"Yes, sir,\" assented Mrs. Barclay apprehensively.  \"For the sum of seven hundred dollars, if I am not mistaken.\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"I shall have need of this money for other purposes, and will trouble you to take it up.\"  \"I was to have three months' notice,\" said the widow, with a troubled look.  \"I will give you three months' notice to-night,\" said the squire.  \"I don't know where to raise the money,\" faltered Mrs. Barclay.  \"Then you had better sell to my friend here.  He will assume the mortgage and pay you three hundred dollars.\"  \"But that will be only a thousand dollars for the place.\"  \"A very fair price, in my opinion, Mrs. Barclay.\"  \"I have always considered it worth fifteen hundred dollars,\" said the widow, very much disturbed.  \"A fancy price, my dear madam; quite an absurd price, I assure you. What do you say, Kirk?\"  \"I quite agree with you, squire,\" said Kirk, in a strong, nasal tone. \"But then, women don't know anything of business.\"  \"I know that you and your cousin are trying to take advantage of my poverty,\" said Mrs. Barclay bitterly.  \"If you are a carpenter, why don't you build a house for yourself, instead of trying to deprive me of mine?\"  \"That's my business,\" said Kirk rudely.  \"Mr. Kirk cannot spare the time to build at present,\" said the squire.  \"Then why doesn't he hire rooms from Elnathan Perkins, as you just recommended to me?\"  \"They wouldn't suit him,\" said the squire curtly.  \"He has set his mind on this house.\"  \"Squire Davenport,\" said Mrs. Barclay, in a softened voice, \"I am sure you cannot understand what you ask of me when you seek to take my home and turn me adrift.  Here I lived with my poor husband; here my boy was born.  During my married life I have had no other home.  It is a humble dwelling, but it has associations and charms for me which it can never have for no one else.  Let Mr. Kirk see some other house and leave me undisturbed in mine.\"  \"Humph!\" said the squire, shrugging his shoulders; \"you look upon the matter from a sentimental point of view.  That is unwise.  It is simply a matter of business.  You speak of the house as yours.  In reality, it is more mine than yours, for I have a major interest in it.  Think over my proposal coolly, and you will see that you are unreasonable.  Mr. Kirk may be induced to give you a little more--say three hundred and fifty dollars--over and above the mortgage, which, as I said before, he is willing assume.\"  \"How does it happen that you are willing to let the mortgage remain, if he buys, when you want the money for other purposes?\" asked the widow keenly.  \"He is a near relative of my wife, and that makes the difference, I apprehend.\"  \"Well, madam, what do you say?\" asked Kirk briskly.  \"I say this, that I will keep the house if I can.\"  \"You needn't expect that I will relent,\" said the squire hastily.  \"I do not, for I see there is no consideration in your heart for a poor widow; but I cannot help thinking that Providence will raise up some kind friend who will buy the mortgage, or in some other way will enable me to save my home.\"  You are acting very foolishly, Mrs. Barclay, as you will realize in time.  I give you a week in which to change your mind.  Till then my friend Kirk's offer stands good.  After that I cannot promise.  If the property sold at auction I shouldn't he surprised if it did not fetch more than the amount of my lien upon it.\"  \"I will trust in Providence, Squire Davenport.\"  \"Providence won't pay off your mortgage, ma'am,\" said Kirk, with a coarse laugh.  Mrs. Barclay did not answer.  She saw that he was a man of coarse fiber and did not care to notice him.  \"Come along, Kirk,\" said the squire.  \"I apprehend she will be all right after a while.  Mrs. Barclay will see her own interest when she comes to reflect.\"  \"Good-evening, ma'am,\" said Kirk.  Mrs. Barclay inclined her head slowly, but did not reply.  When the two had left the house she sank into a chair and gave herself to painful thoughts.  She had known that Squire Davenport had the right to dispossess her, but had not supposed he would do so as long as she paid the interest regularly.  In order to do this, she and Ben had made earnest efforts, and denied themselves all but the barest necessities.  Thus far she had succeeded.  The interest on seven hundred dollars at six per cent. had amounted to forty-two dollars, and this was a large sum to pay, but thus far they had always had it ready.  That Squire Davenport, with his own handsome mansion, would fix covetous eyes on her little home, she had not anticipated, but it had come to pass.  As to raising seven hundred dollars to pay off the mortgage, or induce any capitalist to furnish it, she feared it would be quite impossible.  She anxiously waited for Ben's return from the Town Hall in order to consult with him.     CHAPTER V PROFESSOR HARRINGTON'S ENTERTAINMENT   Meanwhile Ben Barclay was enjoying himself at Professor Harrington's entertainment.  He was at the Town Hall fifteen minutes before the time, and secured a seat very near the stage, or, perhaps it will be more correct to say, the platform.  He had scarcely taken his seat when, to his gratification, Rose Gardiner entered the hall and sat down"]]]
