I do not inherit the politics of the aristocrats, but I have never lost their sense of personal dignity.  I gently pushed away his polluting hand, and I remarked that we were still a long way from the shore.  'Well, you can do as you please,' said he roughly; 'I'm going no nearer, so you can take your choice of getting into the dingey or of swimming for it.'  It was in vain that I pleaded that he had been paid his price.  I did not add that that price meant that the watch which had belonged to three generations of de Lavals was now lying in the shop of a Dover goldsmith.  'Little enough, too!' he cried harshly.  'Down sail, Jim, and bring her to!  Now, master, you can step over the side, or you can come back to Dover, but I don't take the Vixen a cable's length nearer to Ambleteuse Beef with this gale coming up from the sou'-west.'  'In that case I shall go,' said I.  'You can lay your life on that!' he answered, and laughed in so irritating a fashion that I half turned upon him with the intention of chastising him.  One is very helpless with these fellows, however, for a serious affair is of course out of the question, while if one uses a cane upon them they have a vile habit of striking with their hands, which gives them an advantage.  The Marquis de Chamfort told me that, when he first settled in Sutton at the time of the emigration, he lost a tooth when reproving an unruly peasant.  I made the best of a necessity, therefore, and, shrugging my shoulders, I passed over the side of the lugger into the little boat.  My bundle was dropped in after me--conceive to yourself the heir of all the de Lavals travelling with a single bundle for his baggage!--and two seamen pushed her off, pulling with long slow strokes towards the low-lying shore.  There was certainly every promise of a wild night, for the dark cloud which had rolled up over the setting sun was now frayed and ragged at the edges, extending a good third of the way across the heavens.  It had split low down near the horizon, and the crimson glare of the sunset beat through the gap, so that there was the appearance of fire with a monstrous reek of smoke.  A red dancing belt of light lay across the broad slate-coloured ocean, and in the centre of it the little black craft was wallowing and tumbling.  The two seamen kept looking up at the heavens, and then over their shoulders at the land, and I feared every moment that they would put back before the gale burst.  I was filled with apprehension every time when the end of their pull turned their faces skyward, and it was to draw their attention away from the storm-drift that I asked them what the lights were which had begun to twinkle through the dusk both to the right and to the left of us.  'That's Boulogne to the north, and Etaples upon the south,' said one of the seamen civilly.  Boulogne!  Etaples!  How the words came back to me!  It was to Boulogne that in my boyhood we had gone down for the summer bathing.  Could I not remember as a little lad trotting along by my father's side as he paced the beach, and wondering why every fisherman's cap flew off at our approach?  And as to Etaples, it was thence that we had fled for England, when the folks came raving to the pier-head as we passed, and I joined my thin voice to my father's as he shrieked back at them, for a stone had broken my mother's knee, and we were all frenzied with our fear and our hatred.  And here they were, these places of my childhood, twinkling to the north and south of me, while there, in the darkness between them, and only ten miles off at the furthest, lay my own castle, my own land of Grosbois, where the men of my blood had lived and died long before some of us had gone across with Duke William to conquer the proud island over the water.  How I strained my eager eyes through the darkness as I thought that the distant black keep of our fortalice might even now be visible!  'Yes, sir,' said the seaman, ''tis a fine stretch of lonesome coast, and many is the cock of your hackle that I have helped ashore there.'  'What do you take me for, then?' I asked.  'Well, 'tis no business of mine, sir,' he answered.  'There are some trades that had best not even be spoken about.'  'You think that I am a conspirator?'  'Well, master, since you have put a name to it.  Lor' love you, sir, we're used to it.'  'I give you my word that I am none.'  'An escaped prisoner, then?'  'No, nor that either.'  The man leaned upon his oar, and I could see in the gloom that his face was thrust forward, and that it was wrinkled with suspicion.  'If you're one of Boney's spies--' he cried.  'I! A spy!' The tone of my voice was enough to convince him.  'Well,' said he,' I'm darned if I know what you are.  But if you'd been a spy I'd ha' had no hand in landing you, whatever the skipper might say.'  'Mind you, I've no word to say against Boney,' said the other seaman, speaking in a very thick rumbling voice.  'He's been a rare good friend to the poor mariner.'  It surprised me to hear him speak so, for the virulence of feeling against the new French Emperor in England exceeded all belief, and high and low were united in their hatred of him; but the sailor soon gave me a clue to his politics.  'If the poor mariner can run in his little bit of coffee and sugar, and run out his silk and his brandy, he has Boney to thank for it,' said he. 'The merchants have had their spell, and now it's the turn of the poor mariner.'  I remembered then that Buonaparte was personally very popular amongst the smugglers, as well he might be, seeing that he had made over into their hands all the trade of the Channel.  The seaman continued to pull with his left hand, but he pointed with his right over the slate-coloured dancing waters.  'There's Boney himself,' said he.  You who live in a quieter age cannot conceive the thrill which these simple words sent through me.  It was but ten years since we had first heard of this man with the curious Italian name--think  of it, ten years, the time that it takes for a private to become a non-commissioned officer, or a clerk to win a fifty-pound advance in his salary.  He had sprung in an instant out of nothing into everything.  One month people were asking who he was, the next he had broken out in the north of Italy like the plague; Venice and Genoa withered at the touch of this swarthy ill-nourished boy.  He cowed the soldiers in the field, and he outwitted the statesmen in the council chamber.  With a frenzy of energy he rushed to the east, and then, while men were still marvelling at the way in which he had converted Egypt into a French department, he was back again in Italy and had beaten Austria for the second time to the earth.  He travelled as quickly as the rumour of his coming; and where he came there were new victories, new combinations, the crackling of old systems and the blurring of ancient lines of frontier.  Holland, Savoy, Switzerland--they were become mere names upon the map.  France was eating into Europe in every direction.  They had made him Emperor, this beardless artillery officer, and without an effort he had crushed down those Republicans before whom the oldest king and the proudest nobility of Europe had been helpless.  So it came about that we, who watched him dart from place to place like the shuttle of destiny, and who heard his name always in connection with some new achievement and some new success, had come at last to look upon him as something more than human, something monstrous, overshadowing France and menacing Europe.  His giant presence loomed over the continent, and so deep was the impression which his fame had made in my mind that, when the English sailor pointed confidently over the darkening waters, and cried 'There's Boney!' I looked up for the instant with a foolish expectation of seeing some gigantic figure, some elemental creature, dark, inchoate, and threatening, brooding over the waters of the Channel.  Even now, after the long gap of years and the knowledge of his downfall, that great man casts his spell upon you, but all that you read and all that you hear cannot give you an idea of what his name meant in the days when he was at the summit of his career.  What actually met my eye was very different from this childish expectation of mine.  To the north there was a long low cape, the name of which has now escaped me.  In the evening light it had been of the same greyish green tint as the other headlands; but now, as the darkness fell, it gradually  broke into a dull glow, like a cooling iron. On that wild night, seen and lost with the heave and sweep of the boat, this lurid streak carried with it a vague but sinister suggestion. The red line splitting the darkness might have been a giant half-forged sword-blade with its point towards England.  'What is it, then?' I asked.  'Just what I say, master,' said he.  'It's one of Boney's armies, with Boney himself in the middle of it as like as not.  Them is their camp fires, and you'll see a dozen such between this and Ostend. He's audacious enough to come across, is little Boney, if he could dowse Lord Nelson's other eye; but there's no chance for him until then, and well he knows it.'  'How can Lord Nelson know what he is doing?' I asked.  The man pointed out over my shoulder into the darkness, and far on the horizon I perceived three little twinkling lights.  'Watch dog,' said he, in his husky voice.  'Andromeda.  Forty-four,' added his companion.  I have often thought of them since, the long glow upon the land, and the three little lights upon the sea, standing for so much, for the two great rivals face to face, for the power of the land and the power of the water, for the centuries-old battle, which may last for centuries to come.  And yet, Frenchman as I am, do I not know that the struggle is already decided?--for it lies between the childless nation and that which has a lusty young brood springing up around her."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10581"],["title","Uncle Bernac: A Memory of the Empire (#2)"],["body","France falls she dies, but if England falls how many nations are there who will carry her speech, her traditions and her blood on into the history of the future?  The land had been looming darker, and the thudding of waves upon the sand sounded louder every instant upon my ears.  I could already see the quick dancing gleam of the surf in front of me.  Suddenly, as I peered through the deepening shadow, a long dark boat shot out from it, like a trout from under a stone, making straight in our direction.  'A guard boat!' cried one of the seamen.  'Bill, boy, we're done!' said the other, and began to stuff something into his sea boot.  But the boat swerved at the sight of us, like a shying horse, and was off in another direction as fast as eight frantic oars could drive her. The seamen stared after her and wiped their brows.  'Her conscience don't seem much easier than our own,' said one of them.  'I made sure it was the preventives.'  'Looks to me as if you weren't the only queer cargo on the coast to-night, mister,' remarked his comrade.  'What could she be?'  'Cursed if I know what she was.  I rammed a cake of good Trinidad tobacco into my boot when I saw her.  I've seen the inside of a French prison before now.  Give way, Bill, and have it over.'  A minute later, with a low grating sound, we ran aground upon a gravelly leach.  My bundle was thrown ashore, I stepped after it, and a seaman pushed the prow off again, springing in as his comrade backed her into deep water.  Already the glow in the west had vanished, the storm-cloud was half up the heavens, and a thick blackness had gathered over the ocean.  As I turned to watch the vanishing boat a keen wet blast flapped in my face, and the air was filled with the high piping of the wind and with the deep thunder of the sea.  And thus it was that, on a wild evening in the early spring of the year 1805, I, Louis de Laval, being in the twenty-first year of my age, returned, after an exile of thirteen years, to the country of which my family had for many centuries been the ornament and support.  She had treated us badly, this country; she had repaid our services by insult, exile, and confiscation.  But all that was forgotten as I, the only de Laval of the new generation, dropped upon my knees upon her sacred soil, and, with the strong smell of the seaweed in my nostrils, pressed my lips upon the wet and pringling gravel.    CHAPTER II   THE SALT-MARSH  When a man has reached his mature age he can rest at that point of vantage, and cast his eyes back at the long road along which he has travelled, lying with its gleams of sunshine and its stretches of shadow in the valley behind him.  He knows then its whence and its whither, and the twists and bends which were so full of promise or of menace as he approached them lie exposed and open to his gaze.  So plain is it all that he can scarce remember how dark it may have seemed to him, or how long he once hesitated at the cross roads.  Thus when he tries to recall each stage of the journey he does so with the knowledge of its end, and can no longer make it clear, even to himself, how it may have seemed to him at the time.  And yet, in spite of the strain of years, and the many passages which have befallen me since, there is no time of my life which comes back so very clearly as that gusty evening, and to this day I cannot feel the briny wholesome whiff of the seaweed without being carried back, with that intimate feeling of reality which only the sense of smell can confer, to the wet shingle of the French beach.  When I had risen from my knees, the first thing that I did was to put my purse into the inner pocket of my coat.  I had taken it out in order to give a gold piece to the sailor who had handed me ashore, though I have little doubt that the fellow was both wealthier and of more assured prospects than myself.  I had actually drawn out a silver half-crown, but I could not bring myself to offer it to him, and so ended by giving a tenth part of my whole fortune to a stranger.  The other nine sovereigns I put very carefully away, and then, sitting down upon a flat rock just above high water mark, I turned it all over in my mind and weighed what I should do.  Already I was cold and hungry, with the wind lashing my face and the spray smarting in my eyes, but at least I was no longer living upon the charity of the enemies of my country, and the thought set my heart dancing within me.  But the castle, as well as I could remember, was a good ten miles off.  To go there now was to arrive at an unseemly hour, unkempt and weather-stained, before this uncle whom I had never seen.  My sensitive pride conjured up a picture of the scornful faces of his servants as they looked out upon this bedraggled wanderer from England slinking back to the castle which should have been his own.  No, I must seek shelter for the night, and then at my leisure, with as fair a show of appearances as possible, I must present myself before my relative.  Where then could I find a refuge from the storm?  You will ask me, doubtless, why I did not make for Etaples or Boulogne. I answer that it was for the same reason which forced me to land secretly upon that forbidding coast.  The name of de Laval still headed the list of the proscribed, for my father had been a famous and energetic leader of the small but influential body of men who had remained true at all costs to the old order of things.  Do not think that, because I was of another way of thinking, I despised those who had given up so much for their principles.  There is a curious saint-like trait in our natures which draws us most strongly towards that which involves the greatest sacrifice, and I have sometimes thought that if the conditions had been less onerous the Bourbons might have had fewer, or at least less noble, followers.  The French nobles had been more faithful to them than the English to the Stuarts, for Cromwell had no luxurious court or rich appointments which he could hold out to those who would desert the royal cause.  No words can exaggerate the self-abnegation of those men.  I have seen a supper party under my father's roof where our guests were two fencing-masters, three professors of language, one ornamental gardener, and one translator of books, who held his hand in the front of his coat to conceal a rent in the lapel.  But these eight men were of the highest nobility of France, who might have had what they chose to ask if they would only consent to forget the past, and to throw themselves heartily into the new order of things.  But the humble, and what is sadder the incapable, monarch of Hartwell still held the allegiance of those old Montmorencies, Rohans, and Choiseuls, who, having shared the greatness of his family, were determined also to stand by it in its ruin.  The dark chambers of that exiled monarch were furnished with something better than the tapestry of Gobelins or the china of Sevres.  Across the gulf which separates my old age from theirs I can still see those ill-clad, grave-mannered men, and I raise my hat to the noblest group of nobles that our history can show.  To visit a coast-town, therefore, before I had seen my uncle, or learnt whether my return had been sanctioned, would be simply to deliver myself into the hands of the _gens d'armes_, who were ever on the look-out for strangers from England.  To go before the new Emperor was one thing and to be dragged before him another.  On the whole, it seemed to me that my best course was to wander inland, in the hope of finding some empty barn or out-house, where I could pass the night unseen and undisturbed.  Then in the morning I should consider how it was best for me to approach my uncle Bernac, and through him the new master of France.  The wind had freshened meanwhile into a gale, and it was so dark upon the seaward side that I could only catch the white flash of a leaping wave here and there in the blackness.  Of the lugger which had brought me from Dover I could see no sign.  On the land side of me there seemed, as far as I could make it out, to be a line of low hills, but when I came to traverse them I found that the dim light had exaggerated their size, and that they were mere scattered sand-dunes, mottled with patches of bramble.  Over these I toiled with my bundle slung over my shoulder, plodding heavily through the loose sand, and tripping over the creepers, but forgetting my wet clothes and my numb hands as I recalled the many hardships and adventures which my ancestors had undergone.  It amused me to think that the day might come when my own descendants might fortify themselves by the recollection of that which was happening to me, for in a great family like ours the individual is always subordinate to the race.  It seemed to me that I should never get to the end of the sand-dunes, but when at last I did come off them I heartily wished that I was back upon them again; for the sea in that part comes by some creek up the back of the beach, forming at low tide a great desolate salt-marsh, which must be a forlorn place even in the daytime, but upon such a night as that it was a most dreary wilderness.  At first it was but a softness of the ground, causing me to slip as I walked, but soon the mud was over my ankles and half-way up to my knees, so that each foot gave a loud flop as I raised it, and a dull splash as I set it down again.  I would willingly have made my way out, even if I had to return to the sand-dunes, but in trying to pick my path I had lost all my bearings, and the air was so full of the sounds of the storm that the sea seemed to be on every side of me.  I had heard of how one may steer oneself by observation of the stars, but my quiet English life had not taught me how such things were done, and had I known I could scarcely have profited by it, since the few stars which were visible peeped out here and there in the rifts of the flying storm-clouds.  I wandered on then, wet and weary,"]]]
