And had she looked up she might have seen a sleek body crouching almost directly over her and wicked yellow eyes glaring hungrily down upon her, but Teeka did not look up.  With his wound Taug had backed off growling horribly.  Tarzan had followed him, screaming insults at him, and menacing him with his brandishing blade.  Teeka moved from beneath the tree in an effort to keep close to the duelists.  The branch above Teeka bent and swayed a trifle with the movement of the body of the watcher stretched along it.  Taug had halted now and was preparing to make a new stand.  His lips were flecked with foam, and saliva drooled from his jowls.  He stood with head lowered and arms outstretched, preparing for a sudden charge to close quarters.  Could he but lay his mighty hands upon that soft, brown skin the battle would be his.  Taug considered Tarzan's manner of fighting unfair.  He would not close.  Instead, he leaped nimbly just beyond the reach of Taug's muscular fingers.  The ape-boy had as yet never come to a real trial of strength with a bull ape, other than in play, and so he was not at all sure that it would be safe to put his muscles to the test in a life and death struggle.  Not that he was afraid, for Tarzan knew nothing of fear. The instinct of self-preservation gave him caution--that was all.  He took risks only when it seemed necessary, and then he would hesitate at nothing.  His own method of fighting seemed best fitted to his build and to his armament.  His teeth, while strong and sharp, were, as weapons of offense, pitifully inadequate by comparison with the mighty fighting fangs of the anthropoids.  By dancing about, just out of reach of an antagonist, Tarzan could do infinite injury with his long, sharp hunting knife, and at the same time escape many of the painful and dangerous wounds which would be sure to follow his falling into the clutches of a bull ape.  And so Taug charged and bellowed like a bull, and Tarzan of the Apes danced lightly to this side and that, hurling jungle billingsgate at his foe, the while he nicked him now and again with his knife.  There were lulls in the fighting when the two would stand panting for breath, facing each other, mustering their wits and their forces for a new onslaught.  It was during a pause such as this that Taug chanced to let his eyes rove beyond his foeman.  Instantly the entire aspect of the ape altered.  Rage left his countenance to be supplanted by an expression of fear.  With a cry that every ape there recognized, Taug turned and fled.  No need to question him--his warning proclaimed the near presence of their ancient enemy.  Tarzan started to seek safety, as did the other members of the tribe, and as he did so he heard a panther's scream mingled with the frightened cry of a she-ape.  Taug heard, too; but he did not pause in his flight.  With the ape-boy, however, it was different.  He looked back to see if any member of the tribe was close pressed by the beast of prey, and the sight that met his eyes filled them with an expression of horror.  Teeka it was who cried out in terror as she fled across a little clearing toward the trees upon the opposite side, for after her leaped Sheeta, the panther, in easy, graceful bounds.  Sheeta appeared to be in no hurry.  His meat was assured, since even though the ape reached the trees ahead of him she could not climb beyond his clutches before he could be upon her.  Tarzan saw that Teeka must die.  He cried to Taug and the other bulls to hasten to Teeka's assistance, and at the same time he ran toward the pursuing beast, taking down his rope as he came.  Tarzan knew that once the great bulls were aroused none of the jungle, not even Numa, the lion, was anxious to measure fangs with them, and that if all those of the tribe who chanced to be present today would charge, Sheeta, the great cat, would doubtless turn tail and run for his life.  Taug heard, as did the others, but no one came to Tarzan's assistance or Teeka's rescue, and Sheeta was rapidly closing up the distance between himself and his prey.  The ape-boy, leaping after the panther, cried aloud to the beast in an effort to turn it from Teeka or otherwise distract its attention until the she-ape could gain the safety of the higher branches where Sheeta dared not go.  He called the panther every opprobrious name that fell to his tongue.  He dared him to stop and do battle with him; but Sheeta only loped on after the luscious titbit now almost within his reach.  Tarzan was not far behind and he was gaining, but the distance was so short that he scarce hoped to overhaul the carnivore before it had felled Teeka.  In his right hand the boy swung his grass rope above his head as he ran.  He hated to chance a miss, for the distance was much greater than he ever had cast before except in practice.  It was the full length of his grass rope which separated him from Sheeta, and yet there was no other thing to do.  He could not reach the brute's side before it overhauled Teeka.  He must chance a throw.  And just as Teeka sprang for the lower limb of a great tree, and Sheeta rose behind her in a long, sinuous leap, the coils of the ape-boy's grass rope shot swiftly through the air, straightening into a long thin line as the open noose hovered for an instant above the savage head and the snarling jaws.  Then it settled--clean and true about the tawny neck it settled, and Tarzan, with a quick twist of his rope-hand, drew the noose taut, bracing himself for the shock when Sheeta should have taken up the slack.  Just short of Teeka's glossy rump the cruel talons raked the air as the rope tightened and Sheeta was brought to a sudden stop--a stop that snapped the big beast over upon his back.  Instantly Sheeta was up--with glaring eyes, and lashing tail, and gaping jaws, from which issued hideous cries of rage and disappointment.  He saw the ape-boy, the cause of his discomfiture, scarce forty feet before him, and Sheeta charged.  Teeka was safe now; Tarzan saw to that by a quick glance into the tree whose safety she had gained not an instant too soon, and Sheeta was charging.  It was useless to risk his life in idle and unequal combat from which no good could come; but could he escape a battle with the enraged cat? And if he was forced to fight, what chance had he to survive? Tarzan was constrained to admit that his position was aught but a desirable one.  The trees were too far to hope to reach in time to elude the cat.  Tarzan could but stand facing that hideous charge. In his right hand he grasped his hunting knife--a puny, futile thing indeed by comparison with the great rows of mighty teeth which lined Sheeta's powerful jaws, and the sharp talons encased within his padded paws; yet the young Lord Greystoke faced it with the same courageous resignation with which some fearless ancestor went down to defeat and death on Senlac Hill by Hastings.  From safety points in the trees the great apes watched, screaming hatred at Sheeta and advice at Tarzan, for the progenitors of man have, naturally, many human traits.  Teeka was frightened.  She screamed at the bulls to hasten to Tarzan's assistance; but the bulls were otherwise engaged--principally in giving advice and making faces. Anyway, Tarzan was not a real Mangani, so why should they risk their lives in an effort to protect him?  And now Sheeta was almost upon the lithe, naked body, and--the body was not there.  Quick as was the great cat, the ape-boy was quicker.  He leaped to one side almost as the panther's talons were closing upon him, and as Sheeta went hurtling to the ground beyond, Tarzan was racing for the safety of the nearest tree.  The panther recovered himself almost immediately and, wheeling, tore after his prey, the ape-boy's rope dragging along the ground behind him.  In doubling back after Tarzan, Sheeta had passed around a low bush.  It was a mere nothing in the path of any jungle creature of the size and weight of Sheeta--provided it had no trailing rope dangling behind.  But Sheeta was handicapped by such a rope, and as he leaped once again after Tarzan of the Apes the rope encircled the small bush, became tangled in it and brought the panther to a sudden stop.  An instant later Tarzan was safe among the higher branches of a small tree into which Sheeta could not follow him.  Here he perched, hurling twigs and epithets at the raging feline beneath him.  The other members of the tribe now took up the bombardment, using such hard-shelled fruits and dead branches as came within their reach, until Sheeta, goaded to frenzy and snapping at the grass rope, finally succeeded in severing its strands.  For a moment the panther stood glaring first at one of his tormentors and then at another, until, with a final scream of rage, he turned and slunk off into the tangled mazes of the jungle.  A half hour later the tribe was again upon the ground, feeding as though naught had occurred to interrupt the somber dullness of their lives.  Tarzan had recovered the greater part of his rope and was busy fashioning a new noose, while Teeka squatted close behind him, in evident token that her choice was made.  Taug eyed them sullenly.  Once when he came close, Teeka bared her fangs and growled at him, and Tarzan showed his canines in an ugly snarl; but Taug did not provoke a quarrel.  He seemed to accept after the manner of his kind the decision of the she as an indication that he had been vanquished in his battle for her favors.  Later in the day, his rope repaired, Tarzan took to the trees in search of game.  More than his fellows he required meat, and so, while they were satisfied with fruits and herbs and beetles, which could be discovered without much effort upon their part, Tarzan spent considerable time hunting the game animals whose flesh alone satisfied the cravings of his stomach and furnished sustenance and strength to the mighty thews which, day by day, were building beneath the soft,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/106"],["title","Jungle Tales of Tarzan (#2)"],["body","texture of his brown hide.  Taug saw him depart, and then, quite casually, the big beast hunted closer and closer to Teeka in his search for food.  At last he was within a few feet of her, and when he shot a covert glance at her he saw that she was appraising him and that there was no evidence of anger upon her face.  Taug expanded his great chest and rolled about on his short legs, making strange growlings in his throat.  He raised his lips, baring his fangs.  My, but what great, beautiful fangs he had! Teeka could not but notice them.  She also let her eyes rest in admiration upon Taug's beetling brows and his short, powerful neck.  What a beautiful creature he was indeed!  Taug, flattered by the unconcealed admiration in her eyes, strutted about, as proud and as vain as a peacock.  Presently he began to inventory his assets, mentally, and shortly he found himself comparing them with those of his rival.  Taug grunted, for there was no comparison.  How could one compare his beautiful coat with the smooth and naked hideousness of Tarzan's bare hide? Who could see beauty in the stingy nose of the Tarmangani after looking at Taug's broad nostrils? And Tarzan's eyes! Hideous things, showing white about them, and entirely unrimmed with red.  Taug knew that his own blood-shot eyes were beautiful, for he had seen them reflected in the glassy surface of many a drinking pool.  The bull drew nearer to Teeka, finally squatting close against her. When Tarzan returned from his hunting a short time later it was to see Teeka contentedly scratching the back of his rival.  Tarzan was disgusted.  Neither Taug nor Teeka saw him as he swung through the trees into the glade.  He paused a moment, looking at them; then, with a sorrowful grimace, he turned and faded away into the labyrinth of leafy boughs and festooned moss out of which he had come.  Tarzan wished to be as far away from the cause of his heartache as he could.  He was suffering the first pangs of blighted love, and he didn't quite know what was the matter with him.  He thought that he was angry with Taug, and so he couldn't understand why it was that he had run away instead of rushing into mortal combat with the destroyer of his happiness.  He also thought that he was angry with Teeka, yet a vision of her many beauties persisted in haunting him, so that he could only see her in the light of love as the most desirable thing in the world.  The ape-boy craved affection.  From babyhood until the time of her death, when the poisoned arrow of Kulonga had pierced her savage heart, Kala had represented to the English boy the sole object of love which he had known.  In her wild, fierce way Kala had loved her adopted son, and Tarzan had returned that love, though the outward demonstrations of it were no greater than might have been expected from any other beast of the jungle.  It was not until he was bereft of her that the boy realized how deep had been his attachment for his mother, for as such he looked upon her.  In Teeka he had seen within the past few hours a substitute for Kala--someone to fight for and to hunt for--someone to caress; but now his dream was shattered.  Something hurt within his breast.  He placed his hand over his heart and wondered what had happened to him.  Vaguely he attributed his pain to Teeka.  The more he thought of Teeka as he had last seen her, caressing Taug, the more the thing within his breast hurt him.  Tarzan shook his head and growled; then on and on through the jungle he swung, and the farther he traveled and the more he thought upon his wrongs, the nearer he approached becoming an irreclaimable misogynist.  Two days later he was still hunting alone--very morose and very unhappy; but he was determined never to return to the tribe.  He could not bear the thought of seeing Taug and Teeka always together.  As he swung upon a great limb Numa, the lion, and Sabor, the lioness, passed beneath him, side by side, and Sabor leaned against the lion and bit playfully at his cheek.  It was a half-caress. Tarzan sighed and hurled a nut at them.  Later he came upon several of Mbonga's black warriors.  He was upon the point of dropping his noose about the neck of one of them, who was a little distance from his companions, when he became interested in the thing which occupied the savages.  They were building a cage in the trail and covering it with leafy branches.  When they had completed their work the structure was scarcely visible.  Tarzan wondered what the purpose of the thing might be, and why, when they had built it, they turned away and started back along the trail in the direction of their village.  It had been some time since Tarzan had visited the blacks and looked down from the shelter of the great trees which overhung their palisade upon the activities of his enemies, from among whom had come the slayer of Kala.  Although he hated them, Tarzan derived considerable entertainment in watching them at their daily life within the village, and especially at their dances, when the fires glared against their naked bodies as they leaped and turned and twisted in mimic warfare.  It was rather in the hope of witnessing something of the kind that he now followed the warriors back toward their village, but in this he was disappointed, for there was no dance that night.  Instead, from the safe concealment of his tree, Tarzan saw little groups seated about tiny fires discussing the events of the day, and in the darker corners of the village he descried isolated couples talking and laughing together, and always one of each couple was a young man and the other a young woman.  Tarzan cocked his head upon one side and thought, and before he went to sleep that night, curled in the crotch of the great tree above the village, Teeka filled his mind, and afterward she filled his dreams--she and the young black men laughing and talking with the young black women.  Taug, hunting alone, had wandered some distance from the balance of the tribe.  He was making his way slowly along an elephant path when he discovered that it was blocked with undergrowth.  Now Taug, come into maturity, was an evil-natured brute of an exceeding short temper.  When something thwarted him, his sole idea was to overcome it by brute strength and ferocity, and so now when he found his way blocked, he tore angrily into the leafy screen and an instant later found himself within a strange lair, his progress effectually blocked, notwithstanding his most violent efforts to forge ahead.  Biting and striking at the barrier, Taug finally worked himself into a frightful rage, but all to no avail; and at last he became convinced that he must turn back.  But when he would have done so, what was his chagrin to discover that another barrier had dropped behind him while he fought to break down the one before him! Taug was trapped.  Until exhaustion overcame him he fought frantically for his freedom; but all for naught.  In the morning a party of blacks set out from the village of Mbonga in the direction of the trap they had constructed the previous day, while among the branches of the trees above them hovered a naked young giant filled with the curiosity of the wild things.  Manu, the monkey, chattered and scolded as Tarzan passed, and though he was not afraid of the familiar figure of the ape-boy, he hugged closer to him the little brown body of his life's companion.  Tarzan laughed as he saw it; but the laugh was followed by a sudden clouding of his face and a deep sigh.  A little farther on, a gaily feathered bird strutted about before the admiring eyes of his somber-hued mate.  It seemed to Tarzan that everything in the jungle was combining to remind him that he had lost Teeka; yet every day of his life he had seen these same things and thought nothing of them.  When the blacks reached the trap, Taug set up a great commotion. Seizing the bars of his prison, he shook them frantically, and all the while he roared and growled terrifically.  The blacks were elated, for while they had not built their trap for this hairy tree man, they were delighted with their catch.  Tarzan pricked up his ears when he heard the voice of a great ape and, circling quickly until he was down wind from the trap, he sniffed at the air in search of the scent spoor of the prisoner.  Nor was it long before there came to those delicate nostrils the familiar odor that told Tarzan the identity of the captive as unerringly as though he had looked upon Taug with his eyes.  Yes, it was Taug, and he was alone.  Tarzan grinned as he approached to discover what the blacks would do to their prisoner.  Doubtless they would slay him at once.  Again Tarzan grinned.  Now he could have Teeka for his own, with none to dispute his right to her.  As he watched, he saw the black warriors strip the screen from about the cage, fasten ropes to it and drag it away along the trail in the direction of their village.  Tarzan watched until his rival passed out of sight, still beating upon the bars of his prison and growling out his anger and his threats. Then the ape-boy turned and swung rapidly off in search of the tribe, and Teeka.  Once, upon the journey, he surprised Sheeta and his family in a little overgrown clearing.  The great cat lay stretched upon the ground, while his mate, one paw across her lord's savage face, licked at the soft white fur at his throat.  Tarzan increased his speed then until he fairly flew through the forest, nor was it long before he came upon the tribe.  He saw them before they saw him, for of all the jungle creatures, none passed more quietly than Tarzan of the Apes.  He saw Kamma and her mate feeding side by side, their hairy bodies rubbing against each other.  And he saw Teeka feeding by herself.  Not for long would she feed thus in loneliness, thought Tarzan, as with a bound he landed amongst them.  There was a startled rush and a chorus of angry and frightened snarls, for Tarzan had surprised them; but there was more,"]]]
