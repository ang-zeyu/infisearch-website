And here she sat in a dingy little station, with telegraph wires moaning a lonely song in the wind.  A faint sound like the rattling of thin chains diverted Madeline's attention. At first she imagined it was made by the telegraph wires. Then she heard a step. The door swung wide; a tall man entered, and with him came the clinking rattle. She realized then that the sound came from his spurs. The man was a cowboy, and his entrance recalled vividly to her that of Dustin Farnum in the first act of “The Virginian.”  “Will you please direct me to a hotel?” asked Madeline, rising.  The cowboy removed his sombrero, and the sweep he made with it and the accompanying bow, despite their exaggeration, had a kind of rude grace. He took two long strides toward her.  “Lady, are you married?”  In the past Miss Hammond's sense of humor had often helped her to overlook critical exactions natural to her breeding. She kept silence, and she imagined it was just as well that her veil hid her face at the moment. She had been prepared to find cowboys rather striking, and she had been warned not to laugh at them.  This gentleman of the range deliberately reached down and took up her left hand. Before she recovered from her start of amaze he had stripped off her glove.  “Fine spark, but no wedding-ring,” he drawled. “Lady, I'm glad to see you're not married.”  He released her hand and returned the glove.  “You see, the only ho-tel in this here town is against boarding married women.”  “Indeed?” said Madeline, trying to adjust her wits to the situation.  “It sure is,” he went on. “Bad business for ho-tels to have married women. Keeps the boys away. You see, this isn't Reno.”  Then he laughed rather boyishly, and from that, and the way he slouched on his sombrero, Madeline realized he was half drunk. As she instinctively recoiled she not only gave him a keener glance, but stepped into a position where a better light shone on his face. It was like red bronze, bold, raw, sharp. He laughed again, as if good-naturedly amused with himself, and the laugh scarcely changed the hard set of his features. Like that of all women whose beauty and charm had brought them much before the world, Miss Hammond's intuition had been developed until she had a delicate and exquisitely sensitive perception of the nature of men and of her effect upon them. This crude cowboy, under the influence of drink, had affronted her; nevertheless, whatever was in his mind, he meant no insult.  “I shall be greatly obliged if you will show me to the hotel,” she said.  “Lady, you wait here,” he replied, slowly, as if his thought did not come swiftly. “I'll go fetch the porter.”  She thanked him, and as he went out, closing the door, she sat down in considerable relief. It occurred to her that she should have mentioned her brother's name. Then she fell to wondering what living with such uncouth cowboys had done to Alfred. He had been wild enough in college, and she doubted that any cowboy could have taught him much. She alone of her family had ever believed in any latent good in Alfred Hammond, and her faith had scarcely survived the two years of silence.  Waiting there, she again found herself listening to the moan of the wind through the wires. The horse outside began to pound with heavy hoofs, and once he whinnied. Then Madeline heard a rapid pattering, low at first and growing louder, which presently she recognized as the galloping of horses. She went to the window, thinking, hoping her brother had arrived. But as the clatter increased to a roar, shadows sped by--lean horses, flying manes and tails, sombreroed riders, all strange and wild in her sight. Recalling what the conductor had said, she was at some pains to quell her uneasiness. Dust-clouds shrouded the dim lights in the windows. Then out of the gloom two figures appeared, one tall, the other slight. The cowboy was returning with a porter.  Heavy footsteps sounded without, and lighter ones dragging along, and then suddenly the door rasped open, jarring the whole room. The cowboy entered, pulling a disheveled figure--that of a priest, a padre, whose mantle had manifestly been disarranged by the rude grasp of his captor. Plain it was that the padre was extremely terrified.  Madeline Hammond gazed in bewilderment at the little man, so pale and shaken, and a protest trembled upon her lips; but it was never uttered, for this half-drunken cowboy now appeared to be a cool, grim-smiling devil; and stretching out a long arm, he grasped her and swung her back to the bench.  “You stay there!” he ordered.  His voice, though neither brutal nor harsh nor cruel, had the unaccountable effect of making her feel powerless to move. No man had ever before addressed her in such a tone. It was the woman in her that obeyed--not the personality of proud Madeline Hammond.  The padre lifted his clasped hands as if supplicating for his life, and began to speak hurriedly in Spanish. Madeline did not understand the language. The cowboy pulled out a huge gun and brandished it in the priest's face. Then he lowered it, apparently to point it at the priest's feet. There was a red flash, and then a thundering report that stunned Madeline. The room filled with smoke and the smell of powder. Madeline did not faint or even shut her eyes, but she felt as if she were fast in a cold vise. When she could see distinctly through the smoke she experienced a sensation of immeasurable relief that the cowboy had not shot the padre. But he was still waving the gun, and now appeared to be dragging his victim toward her. What possibly could be the drunken fool's intention? This must be, this surely was a cowboy trick. She had a vague, swiftly flashing recollection of Alfred's first letters descriptive of the extravagant fun of cowboys. Then she vividly remembered a moving picture she had seen--cowboys playing a monstrous joke on a lone school-teacher. Madeline no sooner thought of it than she made certain her brother was introducing her to a little wild West amusement. She could scarcely believe it, yet it must be true. Alfred's old love of teasing her might have extended even to this outrage. Probably he stood just outside the door or window laughing at her embarrassment.  Anger checked her panic. She straightened up with what composure this surprise had left her and started for the door. But the cowboy barred her passage--grasped her arms. Then Madeline divined that her brother could not have any knowledge of this indignity. It was no trick. It was something that was happening, that was real, that threatened she knew not what. She tried to wrench free, feeling hot all over at being handled by this drunken brute. Poise, dignity, culture--all the acquired habits of character--fled before the instinct to fight. She was athletic. She fought. She struggled desperately. But he forced her back with hands of iron. She had never known a man could be so strong. And then it was the man's coolly smiling face, the paralyzing strangeness of his manner, more than his strength, that weakened Madeline until she sank trembling against the bench.  “What--do you--mean?” she panted.  “Dearie, ease up a little on the bridle,” he replied, gaily.  Madeline thought she must be dreaming. She could not think clearly. It had all been too swift, too terrible for her to grasp. Yet she not only saw this man, but also felt his powerful presence. And the shaking priest, the haze of blue smoke, the smell of powder--these were not unreal.  Then close before her eyes burst another blinding red flash, and close at her ears bellowed another report. Unable to stand, Madeline slipped down onto the bench. Her drifting faculties refused clearly to record what transpired during the next few moments; presently, however, as her mind steadied somewhat, she heard, though as in a dream, the voice of the padre hurrying over strange words. It ceased, and then the cowboy's voice stirred her.  “Lady, say Si--Si. Say it--quick! Say it--Si!”  From sheer suggestion, a force irresistible at this moment when her will was clamped by panic, she spoke the word.  “And now, lady--so we can finish this properly--what's your name?”  Still obeying mechanically, she told him.  He stared for a while, as if the name had awakened associations in a mind somewhat befogged. He leaned back unsteadily. Madeline heard the expulsion of his breath, a kind of hard puff, not unusual in drunken men.  “What name?” he demanded.  “Madeline Hammond. I am Alfred Hammond's sister.”  He put his hand up and brushed at an imaginary something before his eyes. Then he loomed over her, and that hand, now shaking a little, reached out for her veil. Before he could touch it, however, she swept it back, revealing her face.  “You're--not--Majesty Hammond?”  How strange--stranger than anything that had ever happened to her before--was it to hear that name on the lips of this cowboy! It was a name by which she was familiarly known, though only those nearest and dearest to her had the privilege of using it. And now it revived her dulled faculties, and by an effort she regained control of herself.  “You are Majesty Hammond,” he replied; and this time he affirmed wonderingly rather than questioned.  Madeline rose and faced him.  “Yes, I am.”  He slammed his gun back into its holster.  “Well, I reckon we won't go on with it, then.”  “With what, sir? And why did you force me to say Si to this priest?”  “I reckon that was a way I took to show him you'd be willing to get married.”  “Oh!... You--you!...” Words failed her.  This appeared to galvanize the cowboy into action. He grasped the padre and led him toward the door, cursing and threatening, no doubt enjoining secrecy. Then he pushed him across the threshold and stood there breathing hard and wrestling with himself.  “Here--wait--wait a minute, Miss--Miss Hammond,” he said, huskily. “You could fall into worse company than mine--though I reckon you sure think not. I'm pretty drunk, but I'm--all"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1095"],["title","The Light of the Western Stars (#2)"],["body","otherwise. Just wait--a minute.”  She stood quivering and blazing with wrath, and watched this savage fight his drunkenness. He acted like a man who had been suddenly shocked into a rational state of mind, and he was now battling with himself to hold on to it. Madeline saw the dark, damp hair lift from his brows as he held it up to the cool wind. Above him she saw the white stars in the deep-blue sky, and they seemed as unreal to her as any other thing in this strange night. They were cold, brilliant, aloof, distant; and looking at them, she felt her wrath lessen and die and leave her calm.  The cowboy turned and began to talk.  “You see--I was pretty drunk,” he labored. “There was a fiesta--and a wedding. I do fool things when I'm drunk. I made a fool bet I'd marry the first girl who came to town.... If you hadn't worn that veil--the fellows were joshing me--and Ed Linton was getting married--and everybody always wants to gamble.... I must have been pretty drunk.”  After the one look at her when she had first put aside her veil he had not raised his eyes to her face. The cool audacity had vanished in what was either excessive emotion or the maudlin condition peculiar to some men when drunk. He could not stand still; perspiration collected in beads upon his forehead; he kept wiping his face with his scarf, and he breathed like a man after violent exertions.  “You see--I was pretty--” he began.  “Explanations are not necessary,” she interrupted. “I am very tired--distressed. The hour is late. Have you the slightest idea what it means to be a gentleman?”  His bronzed face burned to a flaming crimson.  “Is my brother here--in town to-night?” Madeline went on.  “No. He's at his ranch.”  “But I wired him.”  “Like as not the message is over in his box at the P.O. He'll be in town to-morrow. He's shipping cattle for Stillwell.”  “Meanwhile I must go to a hotel. Will you please--”  If he heard her last words he showed no evidence of it. A noise outside had attracted his attention. Madeline listened. Low voices of men, the softer liquid tones of a woman, drifted in through the open door. They spoke in Spanish, and the voices grew louder. Evidently the speakers were approaching the station. Footsteps crunching on gravel attested to this, and quicker steps, coming with deep tones of men in anger, told of a quarrel. Then the woman's voice, hurried and broken, rising higher, was eloquent of vain appeal.  The cowboy's demeanor startled Madeline into anticipation of something dreadful. She was not deceived. From outside came the sound of a scuffle--a muffled shot, a groan, the thud of a falling body, a woman's low cry, and footsteps padding away in rapid retreat.  Madeline Hammond leaned weakly back in her seat, cold and sick, and for a moment her ears throbbed to the tramp of the dancers across the way and the rhythm of the cheap music. Then into the open door-place flashed a girl's tragic face, lighted by dark eyes and framed by dusky hair. The girl reached a slim brown hand round the side of the door and held on as if to support herself. A long black scarf accentuated her gaudy attire.  “Senor--Gene!” she exclaimed; and breathless glad recognition made a sudden break in her terror.  “Bonita!” The cowboy leaped to her. “Girl! Are you hurt?”  “No, Senor.”  He took hold of her. “I heard--somebody got shot. Was it Danny?”  “No, Senor.”  “Did Danny do the shooting? Tell me, girl.”  “No, Senor.”  “I'm sure glad. I thought Danny was mixed up in that. He had Stillwell's money for the boys--I was afraid.... Say, Bonita, but you'll get in trouble. Who was with you? What did you do?”  “Senor Gene--they Don Carlos vaqueros--they quarrel over me. I only dance a leetle, smile a leetle, and they quarrel. I beg they be good--watch out for Sheriff Hawe... and now Sheriff Hawe put me in jail. I so frighten; he try make leetle love to Bonita once, and now he hate me like he hate Senor Gene.”  “Pat Hawe won't put you in jail. Take my horse and hit the Peloncillo trail. Bonita, promise to stay away from El Cajon.”  “Si, Senor.”  He led her outside. Madeline heard the horse snort and champ his bit. The cowboy spoke low; only a few words were intelligible--“stirrups... wait... out of town... mountain... trail ... now ride!”  A moment's silence ensued, and was broken by a pounding of hoofs, a pattering of gravel. Then Madeline saw a big, dark horse run into the wide space. She caught a glimpse of wind-swept scarf and hair, a little form low down in the saddle. The horse was outlined in black against the line of dim lights. There was something wild and splendid in his flight.  Directly the cowboy appeared again in the doorway.  “Miss Hammond, I reckon we want to rustle out of here. Been bad goings-on. And there's a train due.”  She hurried into the open air, not daring to look back or to either side. Her guide strode swiftly. She had almost to run to keep up with him. Many conflicting emotions confused her. She had a strange sense of this stalking giant beside her, silent except for his jangling spurs. She had a strange feeling of the cool, sweet wind and the white stars. Was it only her disordered fancy, or did these wonderful stars open and shut? She had a queer, disembodied thought that somewhere in ages back, in another life, she had seen these stars. The night seemed dark, yet there was a pale, luminous light--a light from the stars--and she fancied it would always haunt her.  Suddenly aware that she had been led beyond the line of houses, she spoke:  “Where are you taking me?”  “To Florence Kingsley,” he replied.  “Who is she?”  “I reckon she's your brother's best friend out here.” Madeline kept pace with the cowboy for a few moments longer, and then she stopped. It was as much from necessity to catch her breath as it was from recurring fear. All at once she realized what little use her training had been for such an experience as this. The cowboy, missing her, came back the few intervening steps. Then he waited, still silent, looming beside her.  “It's so dark, so lonely,” she faltered. “How do I know... what warrant can you give me that you--that no harm will befall me if I go farther?”  “None, Miss Hammond, except that I've seen your face.”     II. A Secret Kept  Because of that singular reply Madeline found faith to go farther with the cowboy. But at the moment she really did not think about what he had said. Any answer to her would have served if it had been kind. His silence had augmented her nervousness, compelling her to voice her fear. Still, even if he had not replied at all she would have gone on with him. She shuddered at the idea of returning to the station, where she believed there had been murder; she could hardly have forced herself to go back to those dim lights in the street; she did not want to wander around alone in the dark.  And as she walked on into the windy darkness, much relieved that he had answered as he had, reflecting that he had yet to prove his words true, she began to grasp the deeper significance of them. There was a revival of pride that made her feel that she ought to scorn to think at all about such a man. But Madeline Hammond discovered that thought was involuntary, that there were feelings in her never dreamed of before this night.  Presently Madeline's guide turned off the walk and rapped at a door of a low-roofed house.  “Hullo--who's there?” a deep voice answered.  “Gene Stewart,” said the cowboy. “Call Florence--quick!”  Thump of footsteps followed, a tap on a door, and voices. Madeline heard a woman exclaim: “Gene! here when there's a dance in town! Something wrong out on the range.” A light flared up and shone bright through a window. In another moment there came a patter of soft steps, and the door opened to disclose a woman holding a lamp.  “Gene! Al's not--”  “Al is all right,” interrupted the cowboy.  Madeline had two sensations then--one of wonder at the note of alarm and love in the woman's voice, and the other of unutterable relief to be safe with a friend of her brother's.  “It's Al's sister--came on to-night's train,” the cowboy was saying. “I happened to be at the station, and I've fetched her up to you.”  Madeline came forward out of the shadow.  “Not--not really Majesty Hammond!” exclaimed Florence Kingsley. She nearly dropped the lamp, and she looked and looked, astounded beyond belief.  “Yes, I am really she,” replied Madeline. “My train was late, and for some reason Alfred did not meet me. Mr.--Mr. Stewart saw fit to bring me to you instead of taking me to a hotel.”  “Oh, I'm so glad to meet you,” replied Florence, warmly. “Do come in. I'm so surprised, I forget my manners. Why, Al never mentioned your coming.”  “He surely could not have received my messages,” said Madeline, as she entered.  The cowboy, who came in with her satchel, had to stoop to enter the door, and, once in, he seemed to fill the room. Florence set the lamp down upon the table. Madeline saw a young woman with a smiling, friendly face, and a profusion of fair hair hanging down over her dressing-gown.  “Oh, but Al will be glad!” cried Florence. “Why, you are white as a sheet. You must be tired. What a long wait you had at the station! I heard the train come in hours ago as I was going to bed. That station is lonely at night. If I had known you were coming! Indeed, you are very pale. Are you ill?”  “No. Only I am very tired. Traveling so far by rail is harder than I imagined. I did have rather a long wait after arriving at the station, but I can't say that it was lonely.”  Florence Kingsley searched Madeline's face with keen eyes, and then took a long, significant look at the silent Stewart. With that she deliberately and quietly closed a door leading into another room.  “Miss Hammond, what has happened?” She had lowered her voice.  “I do not wish to recall all that has happened,” replied Madeline. “I shall tell Alfred, however, that I would rather have met a hostile Apache than a cowboy.”  “Please don't tell"]]]
