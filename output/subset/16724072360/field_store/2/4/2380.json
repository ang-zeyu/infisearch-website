God has given them the power to shine, just as he has given us the power to walk or speak; and they do shine brightly, as you see; but _how_ they do it is more than I can tell.  I think, myself, it must be anger that makes them shine, for they generally do it when they are stirred up or knocked about by oars, or ships' keels, or tumbling waves.  But I am not sure that that's the reason either, because, you know, we often sail through them without seeing the light, though of course they must be there.\"  \"P'raps, sir,\" said Tom Lokins; \"p'raps, sir, they're sleepy sometimes, an' can't be bothered gettin' angry.\"  \"Perhaps!\" answered the captain, laughing.  \"But then again, at other times, I have seen them shining over the whole sea when it was quite calm, making it like an ocean of milk; and nothing was disturbing them at that time, d'ye see.\"  \"I don' know _that_,\" objected Tom; \"they might have bin a-fightin' among theirselves.\"  \"Or playing, may be,\" said I.  The captain laughed, and, looking up at the sky, said, \"I don't like the look of the weather, Tom Lokins.  You're a sharp fellow, and have been in these seas before, what say you?\"  \"We'll have a breeze,\" replied Tom, briefly.  \"More than a breeze,\" muttered the captain, while a look of grave anxiety overspread his countenance; \"I'll go below and take a squint at the glass.\"  \"What does he mean by that, Tom,\" said I, when the captain was gone, \"I never saw a calmer or a finer night.  Surely there is no chance of a storm just now.\"  \"Ay, that shows that you're a young feller, and han't got much experience o' them seas,\" replied my companion.  \"Why, boy, sometimes the fiercest storm is brewin' behind the greatest calm.  An' the worst o' the thing is that it comes so sudden at times, that the masts are torn out o' the ship before you can say Jack Robinson.\"  \"What! and without any warning?\" said I.  \"Ay, _almost_ without warnin'; but not _altogether_ without it.  You heer'd the captain say he'd go an' take a squint at the glass?\"  \"Yes; what is the glass?\"  \"It's not a glass o' grog, you may be sure; nor yet a lookin'-glass. It's the weather-glass, boy.  Shore-goin' chaps call it a barometer.\"  \"And what's the meaning of barometer?\"  I inquired earnestly.  Tom Lokins stared at me in stupid amazement.  \"Why, boy,\" said he, \"you're too inquisitive.  I once asked the doctor o' a ship that question, and says he to me, `Tom,' says he, `a barometer is a glass tube filled with quicksilver or mercury, which is a metal in a soft or fluid state, like water, you know, and it's meant for tellin' the state o' the weather.'  \"`Yes, sir,' I answers, `I know that, well enough.'  \"`Then why did you ask?' says he, gettin' into a passion.  \"`I asked what was the meanin' o' the _word_ barometer, sir,' said I.  \"The doctor he looked grave at that, and shook his head.  `Tom,' says he, `if I was to go for to explain that word, and all about the instrument, in a scientific sort o' way, d'ye see, I'd have to sit here an' speak to you right on end for six hours or more.'  \"`Oh, sir,' says I, `don't do it, then.  _Please_, don't do it.'  \"`No more I will,' says he; `but it'll serve your turn to know that a barometer is a glass for measurin' the weight o' the air, and, _somehow or other, that_ lets ye know wots a-coming.  If the mercury in the glass rises high, all's right.  If it falls uncommon low very sudden, look out for squalls; that's all.  No matter how smooth the sea may be, or how sweetly all natur' may smile, don't you believe it; take in every inch o' canvas at once.'\"  \"That was a queer explanation, Tom.\"  \"Ay, but it was a true one, as you shall see before long.\"  As I looked out upon the calm sea, which lay like a sheet of glass, without a ripple on its surface, I could scarcely believe what he had said.  But before many minutes had passed I was convinced of my error.  While I was standing talking to my messmate, the captain rushed on deck, and shouted--  \"All hands tumble up!  Shorten sail!  Take in every rag!  Look alive, boys, look alive.\"  I was quite stunned for a moment by this, and by the sudden tumult that followed.  The men, who seemed never to take thought about anything, and who had but one duty, namely, to _obey orders_, ran upon deck, and leaped up the rigging like cats; the sheets of nearly all the principal sails were clewed up, and, ere long, the canvas was made fast to the yards.  A few of the smaller sails only were left exposed, and even these were close reefed.  Before long a loud roar was heard, and in another minute the storm burst upon us with terrific violence.  The ship at first lay over so much that the masts were almost in the water, and it was as impossible for any one to walk the deck as to walk along the side of a wall.  At the same time, the sea was lashed into white foam, and the blinding spray flew over us in bitter fury.  \"Take in the topsails!\" roared the captain.  But his voice was drowned in the shriek of the gale.  The men were saved the risk of going out on the yards, however, for in a few moments more all the sails, except the storm-try-sail, were burst and blown to ribbons.  We now tried to put the ship's head to the wind and \"_lay to_,\" by which landsmen will understand that we tried to face the storm, and remain stationary.  But the gale was so fierce that this was impossible.  The last rag of sail was blown away, and then there was nothing left for us but to show our stern to the gale, and \"scud under bare poles.\"  The great danger now was that we might be \"pooped,\" which means that a huge wave might curl over our stern, fall with terrible fury on our deck, and sink us.  Many and many a good ship has gone down in this way; but we were mercifully spared.  As our safety depended very much on good steering, the captain himself took the wheel, and managed the ship so well, that we weathered the gale without damage, farther than the loss of a few sails and light spars.  For two days the storm howled furiously, the sky and sea were like ink, with sheets of rain and foam driving through the air, and raging billows tossing our ship about like a cork.  During all this time my shipmates were quiet and grave, but active and full of energy, so that every order was at once obeyed without noise or confusion.  Every man watched the slightest motion of the captain.  We all felt that everything depended on him.  As for me, I gave up all hope of being saved.  It seemed impossible to me that anything that man could build could withstand so terrible a storm.  I do not pretend to say that I was not afraid.  The near prospect of a violent death caused my heart to sink more than once; but my feelings did not unman me.  I did my duty quietly, but quickly, like the rest; and when I had no work to do, I stood holding on to the weather stanchions, looking at the raging sea, and thinking of my mother, and of the words of kindness and counsel she had so often bestowed upon me in vain.  The storm ceased almost as quickly as it began, and although the sea did not all at once stop the heavings of its angry bosom, the wind fell entirely in the course of a few hours, the dark clouds broke up into great masses that were piled up high into the sky, and out of the midst of these the glorious sun shone in bright rays down on the ocean, like comfort from heaven, gladdening our hearts as we busily repaired the damage that we had suffered from the storm.    CHAPTER THREE.  OUR FIRST BATTLE.  I shall never forget the surprise I got the first time I saw a whale.  It was in the forenoon of a most splendid day, about a week after we arrived at that part of the ocean where we might expect to find fish.  A light nor'-east breeze was blowing, but it scarcely ruffled the sea, as we crept slowly through the water with every stitch of canvas set.  As we had been looking out for fish for some time past, everything was in readiness for them.  The boats were hanging over the side ready to lower, tubs for coiling away the ropes, harpoons, lances, etcetera, all were ready to throw in, and start away at a moment's notice.  The man in the \"crow's nest,\" as they call the cask fixed up at the mast-head, was looking anxiously out for whales, and the crew were idling about the deck.  Tom Lokins was seated on the windlass smoking his pipe, and I was sitting beside him on an empty cask, sharpening a blubber-knife.  \"Tom,\" said I, \"what like is a whale?\"  \"Why, it's like nothin' but itself,\" replied Tom, looking puzzled. \"Why, wot a queer feller you are to ax questions.\"  \"I'm sure you've seen plenty of them.  You might be able to tell what a whale is like.\"  \"Wot it's like!  Well, it's like a tremendous big bolster with a head and a tail to it.\"  \"And how big is it?\"  \"They're of all sizes, lad.  I've seen one that was exactly equal to three hundred fat bulls, and its rate of goin' would take it round the whole world in twenty-three days.\"  \"I don't believe you,\" said I, laughing.  \"Don't you?\" cried Tom; \"it's a fact notwithstandin', for the captain himself said so, and that's how I came to know it.\"  Just as Tom finished speaking, the man in the crow's nest roared at the top of his voice, \"There she blows!\"  That was the signal that a whale was in sight, and as it was the first time we had heard it that season, every man in the ship was thrown into a state of tremendous excitement.  \"There she blows!\" roared the man again.  \"Where away?\" shouted the captain.  \"About two miles right ahead.\"  In another moment the utmost excitement prevailed on board.  Suddenly, while I was looking over the side, straining my eyes to catch a sight of the whale, which could not yet be seen by the men on deck, I saw a brown object appear in the sea, not twenty yards from the side of the ship; before I had time to ask what it was, a whale's head rose to the surface, and shot up"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21732"],["title","Fort Desolation: Red Indians and Fur Traders of Rupert's Land (#1)"],["body","the blues?\" remarked the hunter, regarding Jack with a peculiar smile through his first puff of smoke.  \"Rather!\" said Jack.  \"Grog?\" inquired Joe.  \"Haven't tasted a drop for months,\" replied Jack.  \"All square _here_?\" inquired the hunter, tapping his stomach.  \"Could digest gun-flints and screw nails!\"  The two smoked in silence for some time; then Joe drew forth a soiled letter, which he handed to his companion, saying--  \"It's bin lying at the post-office for some weeks, and as the postmaster know'd I was comin' here he asked me to take it.  I've a notion it may be an offer to buy your clearin', for I've heerd two or three fellows speakin' about it.  Now, as I want to buy it myself, if yer disposed to sell it, I hereby make you the first offer.\"  Jack Robinson continued to smoke in silence, gazing abstractedly at the letter.  Since his mother had died, a year before the date of which we write, he had not received a line from any one, insomuch that he had given up calling at the post-office on his occasional visits to the nearest settlement.  This letter, therefore, took him by surprise, all the more that it was addressed in the handwriting of his former partner, Murray.  Breaking the seal, he read as follows:    \"Fort Kamenistaquoia, April the somethingth:--    \"Dear Jack,--You'll be surprised to see my fist, but not more   surprised than I was to hear from an old hunter just arrived, that you   had taken to farming.  It's not your forte, Jack, my boy.  Be advised.   Sell off the farm for what it will fetch, and come and join me.  My   antecedents are not in my favour, I grant; but facts are stubborn   things, and it is a fact that I am making dollars here like stones.   I'm a fur-trader, my boy.  Have joined a small company, and up to this   time have made a good thing of it.  You know something of the fur   trade, if I mistake not.  Do come and join us; we want such a man as   you at a new post we have established on the coast of Labrador.   Shooting, fishing, hunting, _ad libitum_.  Eating, drinking, sleeping,   _ad infinitum_.  What would you more?  Come, like a good fellow, and   be happy!    \"Ever thine, J. MURRAY.\"  \"I'll sell the _farm_,\" said Jack Robinson, folding the letter.  \"You will?\" exclaimed Joe.  \"What's your price?\"  \"Come over it with me, and look at the fixings, before I tell you,\" said Jack.  They went over it together, and looked at every fence and stump and implement.  They visited the live stock, and estimated the value of the sprouting crop.  Then they returned to the house, where they struck a bargain off-hand.  That evening Jack bade adieu to the Mountain House, mounted his horse, with his worldly goods at the pommel of the saddle, and rode away, leaving Joe, the trapper, in possession.  In process of time our hero rode through the settlements to Montreal, where he sold his horse, purchased a few necessaries, and made his way down the Saint Lawrence to the frontier settlements of the bleak and almost uninhabited north shore of the gulf.  Here he found some difficulty in engaging a man to go with him, in a canoe, towards the coast of Labrador.  An Irishman, in a fit of despondency, at length agreed; but on reaching a saw-mill that had been established by a couple of adventurous Yankees, in a region that seemed to be the out-skirts of creation, Paddy repented, and vowed he'd go no farther for love or money.  Jack Robinson earnestly advised the faithless man to go home, and help his grandmother, thenceforth, to plant murphies; after which he embarked in his canoe alone, and paddled away into the dreary north.  Camping out in the woods at night, paddling all day, and living on biscuit and salt pork, with an occasional duck or gull, by way of variety; never seeing a human face from morn till night, nor hearing the sound of any voice except his own, Jack pursued his voyage for fourteen days.  At the end of that time he descried Fort Kamenistaquoia.  It consisted of four small log-houses, perched on a conspicuous promontory, with a flag-staff in the midst of them.  Here he was welcomed warmly by his friend John Murray and his colleagues, and was entertained for three days sumptuously on fresh salmon, salt pork, pancakes, and tea.  Intellectually, he was regaled with glowing accounts of the fur trade and the salmon fisheries of that region.  \"Now, Jack,\" said Murray, on the third day after his arrival, while they walked in front of the fort, smoking a morning pipe, \"it is time that you were off to the new fort.  One of our best men has built it, but he is not a suitable person to take charge, and as the salmon season has pretty well advanced we are anxious to have you there to look after the salting and sending of them to Quebec.\"  \"What do you call the new fort?\" inquired Jack.  \"Well, it has not yet got a name.  We've been so much in the habit of styling it the New Fort that the necessity of another name has not occurred to us.  Perhaps, as you are to be its first master, we may leave the naming of it to you.\"  \"Very good,\" said Jack; \"I am ready at a moment's notice.  Shall I set off this forenoon?\"  \"Not quite so sharp as that,\" replied Murray, laughing.  \"To-morrow morning, at day-break, will do.  There is a small sloop lying in a creek about twenty miles below this.  We beached her there last autumn. You'll go down in a boat with three men, and haul her into deep water. There will be spring tides in two days, so, with the help of tackle, you'll easily manage it.  Thence you will sail to the new fort, forty miles farther along the coast, and take charge.\"  \"The three men you mean to give me know their work, I presume?\" said Jack.  \"Of course they do.  None of them have been at the fort, however.\"  \"Oh!  How then shall we find it?\" inquired Jack.  \"By observation,\" replied the other.  \"Keep a sharp look out as you coast along, and you can't miss it.\"  The idea of mists and darkness and storms occurred to Jack Robinson, but he only answered, \"Very good.\"  \"Can any of the three men navigate the sloop?\" he inquired.  \"Not that I'm aware of,\" said Murray; \"but you know something of navigation, yourself, don't you?\"  \"No! nothing!\"  \"Pooh! nonsense.  Have you never sailed a boat?\"  \"Yes, occasionally.\"  \"Well, it's the same thing.  If a squall comes, keep a steady hand on the helm and a sharp eye to wind'ard, and you're safe as the Bank.  If it's too strong for you, loose the halyards, let the sheets fly, and down with the helm; the easiest thing in the world if you only look alive and don't get flurried.\"  \"Very good,\" said Jack, and as he said so his pipe went out; so he knocked out the ashes and refilled it.  Next morning our hero rowed away with his three men, and soon discovered the creek of which his friend had spoken.  Here he found the sloop, a clumsy \"tub\" of about twenty tons burden, and here Jack's troubles began.  The _Fairy_, as the sloop was named, happened to have been beached during a very high tide.  It now lay high and dry in what once had been mud, on the shore of a land-locked bay or pond, under the shadow of some towering pines.  The spot looked like an inland lakelet, on the margin of which one might have expected to find a bear or a moose-deer, but certainly not a sloop.  \"Oh! ye shall nevair git him off,\" said Francois Xavier, one of the three men--a French-Canadian--on beholding the stranded vessel.  \"We'll try,\" said Pierre, another of the three men, and a burly half-breed.  \"Try!\" exclaimed Rollo, the third of the three men--a tall, powerful, ill-favoured man, who was somewhat of a bully, who could not tell where he had been born, and did not know who his father and mother had been, having been forsaken by them in his infancy.  \"Try? you might as well try to lift a mountain!  I've a mind to go straight back to Kamenistaquoia and tell Mr Murray that to his face!\"  \"Have you?\" said Jack Robinson, in a quiet, peculiar tone, accompanied by a gaze that had the effect of causing Rollo to look a little confused.  \"Come along, lads, we'll begin at once,\" he continued, \"it will be full tide in an hour or so.  Get the tackle ready, Francois; the rest of you set to work, and clear away the stones and rubbish from under her sides.\"  Jack threw off his coat, and began to work like a hero--as he was.  The others followed his example; and the result was that when the tide rose to its full height the sloop was freed of all the rubbish that had collected round the hull; the block tackle was affixed to the mast; the rope attached to a tree on the opposite side of the creek; and the party were ready to haul.  But although they hauled until their sinews cracked, and the large veins of their necks and foreheads swelled almost to bursting, the sloop did not move an inch.  The tide began to fall, and in a few minutes that opportunity was gone.  There were not many such tides to count on, so Jack applied all his energies and ingenuity to the work.  By the time the next tide rose they had felled two large pines, and applied them to the side of the vessel.  Two of the party swung at the ends of these; the other two hauled on the block-tackle. This time the sloop moved a little at the full flood; but the moment of hope soon passed, and the end was not yet attained.  The next tide was the last high one.  They worked like desperate men during the interval.  The wedge was the mechanical power which prevailed at last.  Several wedges were inserted under the vessel's side, and driven home.  Thus the sloop was canted over a little towards the water. When the tide was at the full, one man hauled at the tackle, two men swung at the ends of the levers, and Jack hammered home the wedges at each heave and pull; thus securing every inch of movement.  The result was that the sloop slid slowly down the bank into deep water.  It is wonderful how small a matter will arouse human enthusiasm!  The cheer that was given on the successful floating of the _Fairy_ was certainly as full of fervour, if not "]]]
