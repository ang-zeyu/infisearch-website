There were three Earthwomen in the party. There was nothing peculiar about them. They were rather handsome, dissolute in appearance, all of them obviously befuddled by alcholite. There was a man who could have been Anglo-Saxon. A wastrel, probably, with more money than wit; he wore a black dinner suit edged with white.  Our attention focussed upon the other two. They were tall, as are all Martians. The young woman, _Setta_ Meka, seemed perhaps twenty or twenty-five years of age, by Earth reckoning, in stature perhaps very nearly my own height, which is six feet two. It is difficult to tell a Martian's age, but she was very handsome, even by Earth standards; and in Ferrok-Shahn she would be considered a beauty. Her gray-black hair was parted and tied at the back with a plaited metal rope. Her short dark cloak, so luminous a fabric that it caught and reflected the sheen of all the gaudy restaurant lights, was parted, its ends thrown back over her shoulders. Beneath it she wore the characteristic Martian leather jacket, and short, wide leather trousers ornamented with spun metal fringes and tassels. Most Martian women have an amazonian aspect, but I saw now that _Setta_ Meka was an exception.  Her brother, who sat beside her, was a full seven feet or more. A hulking sort of fellow, far less spindly than most of his race, he might have come from the polar outposts beyond the Martian Union. He was bare-headed, his gray-black hair clipped close upon a round bullet head, with the familiar Martian round eyes.  I gazed into the face of Molo, as momentarily he turned his head. It was a rough-hewn, strongly masculine face with a hawk-like nose, bushy black brows frowning above deepset round eyes. The face of a keen scoundrel, I could not doubt, though the smooth-plucked gray skin was flushed now with alcholite, and the wide, thin-lipped mouth was leering at the woman across the table from him.  Like his sister, he had thrown back his cloak, disclosing a brawny, powerful figure, leather clad, with a wide belt of dangling ornaments, some of which probably were weapons.  How long we gazed at this silent colored image of the restaurant table I do not know. I was aware of Halsey's quiet voice: \"Look him over, Miss Venza. It depends on you.\"  Another interval passed. It seemed, as we watched, that Molo's interest in his party was very slight. I got the impression, too, that though at first he had seemed to be intoxicated, actually he was not. Nor was his sister. Anxiety seemed upon her; the smile she had for jests seemed forced; and at intervals she would cast a swift, furtive glance across the gay restaurant scene.  More drinks arrived. The Earthpeople at the table here seemed upon the verge of stupor; and suddenly it appeared that Molo had completely lost interest in them. With a gesture to his sister, he abruptly rose from his seat. She joined him. They left the table, and a red-clad floor manager of the restaurant came at their call. Then in a moment they were moving across the room.  Halsey called sharply into his audiphone: \"Francis! Hold us to them if you can.\"  They were standing now by the opened door of one of the Red Spark's private insulated rooms. We caught a glimpse of its interior, a gaily set table with a bank of colored lights over it.  The figure of a man was in there. He was on his feet, as though he had just arrived to meet the Martians here, and a hooded long cloak enveloped him. It may have been a magnetic \"invisible\" cloak, with the current now off.  We caught only the fleetest of impressions before the insulated door closed and barred our vision. The glimpse was an accident. Molo, taken by surprise at this appearance of his visitor, could hardly have guarded against it. The waiting figure was very tall, some ten feet, and very thin. The hood shrouded his face and head. In his hand he held a large circular box of black shiny leather, of the sort in which women carry wide-brimmed hats. As Molo joined him he put the box gently on the floor. He handled it as though it were extraordinarily heavy; and as he took a step or two, he seemed weighted down. Just as the room door was hastily closing, Meka sliding it from the inside, we caught a fleeting glimpse of horror.  The lid of the hat box had lifted up. Inside was a great round thing of gray-white, a living thing; a distended ball of membrane, with a network of veins and blood-vessels showing beneath the transparent skin.  For the instant we gazed, stricken. The ball was palpitating, breathing! I saw convolutions of inner tissue under the transparent skin of membrane; a little tentacle, like an arm with a flat-webbed hand, was holding up the lid of the box. The lid rose a trifle higher; the colored lights overhead gave us a brief but clear view of it.  The thing in the box was a huge living brain. I saw goggling, protruding eyes; an orifice that could have been a nose, and a gash upended for a vertical mouth. It was a face. And the little tentacle arm holding up the box-lid was joined to where the ear should have been.  Was this something human? A huge distended human brain, with the body withered to that tiny arm?  The palpitating thing sank down in the box and the lid dropped. And upon our horrified gaze the insulated door of the room slid too.  \"By the gods!\" exclaimed Halsey. \"One of them dares come to the Red Spark. Here, almost in public.\"  So Halsey knew what this meant. His eyes were blazing now; his face was white, with an intensity of emotion that transfigured it.  \"Francis, tell Foley I'll be in the manager's office in five minutes.\"  He snapped off; our image connection with the Red Spark went dead.  \"We're going to the Red Spark,\" he announced. \"This changes everything, yet I don't know. Venza, I may need you more than ever, now.\"  Halsey herded us to the office door. From his desk he had snatched up a few portable instruments, and he flung on a cloak.  It was a brief trip to the Red Spark, on foot through the sub-cellar arcade to where, under Park Circle 29, we went up in a vertical lift to the roof. We were in the side entrance oval of the restaurant in five minutes.  In the dim metal room of Orentino, the Red Spark's manager, a barrage was up and Foley was waiting for us. We could hear it faintly humming. Now we could talk.  Halsey slammed the door down. He said swiftly, \"My men caught one of these things this morning. They have it now and I think Molo does not yet know we captured it. A brain; we're convinced it understands English and can talk, but no one has been able to make it talk yet. Foley, order that damned Orentino to de-insulate the room Molo is in. Now, by the gods, we may see and hear something.\"  The frightened manager of the Red Spark was in the control room. Halsey killed our barrage to let the outside connections get through to us. We all crowded around the mirror-grid which stood on Orentino's desk. Foley gave us connection with the control room. We saw Orentino's face, his eyes nearly popping with fright. \"Colonel Halsey, I will do whatever you tell me.\"  \"What room is that Martian occupying?\"  \"Insulated 39.\"  \"Break off the insulation. Do it slowly and he may not notice. Then give us connection, audio and vision.\"  \"But I have no image-finders in the insulated rooms.\"  \"Cut off the barrage. I'll get connection there.\"  Foley was already setting up his eavesdropper on the desk. The mirror blurred a little; then it clarified. We had the interior of the secret room, and voices were coming out of Foley's tiny receiver.  The image showed the box on the floor, with its lid down. The tall hooded shape of the stranger stood with Molo and his sister by the table. They were talking in swift, vehement undertones. The language was Martian, a dialect principally used in Ferrok-Shahn. Our equipment brought it in and I could understand it.  Molo was saying: \"But you are the fool to have dared to come here!\"  \"The master knows that there is danger. Something is wrong.\" The hooded stranger spoke like a foreigner, but not a Martian, nor an Earthman, and not like any person of Venus I had ever heard. It was a strange, indescribable intonation, a flat, hollow voice.  \"I say the master is concerned.\"  \"Let him be.\"  \"And he demanded I bring him here to find you. He is displeased that you are here.\"  What gruesome thing was this? Their glances seemed to go to the box on the floor at their feet, as though the master were in there. But the lid of the box did not rise.  \"Well, you have found me,\" Molo declared impatiently. \"When you know me better, always you will find I have my wits. The thing is for tomorrow night, not tonight.\"  \"But that, my master is not sure.\" The hollow voice was deferential but insistent. \"He fears danger; something has gone wrong. He is working on it now, striving to receive the message! There is a message. He knows that much. Perhaps from our world, Wandl, itself.\"  For a moment Molo had no answer. His sister had not spoken. I noticed that her gaze seemed roving the room.  \"What is it I should do?\" Molo asked at last.  \"Come with us to your home-room.\"  \"But I have everything ready there. The contact is ready for tomorrow night. Your world will control Earth.\"  \"But if it be tonight?\"  Again Molo was silent. My breath stopped. On our mirror I saw the stranger's hood part just a little. There seemed to be no face; just the blur of something brownish.  \"But if it be tonight?\" the voice insisted.  \"I will go,\" Molo said abruptly, \"but your coming here was dangerous. Suppose we cannot get out undetected? You know I will never go to where all our instruments are set up and have some damnable spy follow me. Is all going well on Venus and Mars?\"  \"Yes. My master feels so. He seems to get messages. The contacts will be made simultaneously.\" A gruesome chuckle. \"The capture of these three worlds.

(_See_ p. iv.)  It seems to be clear that the same lady wrote \"The Lion's Masquerade\" as \"The Peacock at Home,\" for in \"The Lioness's Ball\" (a companion to \"The Lion's Masquerade\") the dedication begins thus--    \"I do not, fair Dorset, I do not aspire,      With notes so unhallowed as mine,    To touch the sweet strings of thy beautiful lyre,      Or covet the praise that is thine.\"   I regret that I am unable to offer any conjecture here as to the \"W. B.\" who wrote \"The Elephant's Ball:\" the same initials appear to an appendix to an edition of \"Goody Two Shoes,\" published some time before 1780, but this may be a coincidence only.         *       *       *       *       *  Besides the interest and merit of these little books on literary grounds, these earlier editions are especially noteworthy because they were illustrated by the painter William Mulready, and the drawings he made for them are amongst the earliest efforts of his genius: they were executed before he had reached man's estate. It is not a little curious to observe in this connection how many artists who have risen to eminence have at the outset of their career been employed in illustrating books for children; it would indeed appear that until comparatively recent years the veriest tiro was considered capable of furnishing the necessary embellishments for books for the nursery--a state of things which, we need not say, happily does not obtain in the present day. Notwithstanding this, however, these and many other little books of a bygone time abound in instructive indications of the beginnings of genius which has subsequently delighted the world with its masterpieces.  In connection with Mulready and children's books it may be interesting to note that in 1806 a little book called \"The Looking Glass\" was published, said to be written by William Godwin under the name of \"Theophilus Markliffe.\" This work is the history and early adventures of a young artist, and it is known that it was compiled from a conversation with Mulready, who was then engaged in illustrating some juvenile books for the author, and the facts in it relate to the painter's early life. It contains illustrations of the talent of the subject done at three, five, and six years old, which are presumed to be imitations of Mulready's own drawings at the same ages.         *       *       *       *       *  I cannot more fitly close these few words of Introduction than by quoting the quaint and curious announcement with which Mr Harris was wont to commend these little books to the public. \"It is unnecessary,\" says he, \"for the publisher to say anything more of these little productions than that they have been purchased with avidity and read with satisfaction by persons in all ranks of life.\" No doubt the public of to-day will be curious to see what manner of book it was that was so eagerly sought after by the children of the early days of the present century, and interested in comparing it with the more finished but often showy and sensational productions of our own time.

The Trumpeter, _Gad-fly_, has summon'd the Crew,   And the Revels are now only waiting for you.    So said little Robert, and pacing along,   His merry Companions came forth in a Throng.   And on the smooth Grass, by the side of a Wood,   Beneath a broad Oak that for Ages had stood,  [Illustration: _\"Saw the children of earth & the tenants of air,\"_]    Saw the Children of Earth, and the Tenants of Air,   For an Evening's Amusement together repair.   And there came the _Beetle_, so blind and so black,   Who carried the _Emmet_, his Friend, on his Back.    And there was the _Gnat_ and the _Dragon-fly_ too,   With all their Relations, Green, Orange, and Blue.   And there came the _Moth_, with his Plumage of Down,   And the _Hornet_ in Jacket of Yellow and Brown;    Who with him the _Wasp_, his Companion, did bring,   But they promis'd, that Evening, to lay by their Sting.   And the sly little _Dormouse_ crept out of his Hole,   And brought to the Feast his blind Brother, the _Mole_.  [Illustration: _\"And the sly little dormouse crept out of his hole.\"_]    And the _Snail_, with his Horns peeping out of his Shell,   Came from a great Distance, the Length of an Ell.   A Mushroom their Table, and on it was laid   A Water-dock Leaf, which a Table-cloth made.  [Illustration: _\"And the Bee brought her honey,\" &c._]    The Viands were various, to each of their Taste,   And the _Bee_ brought her Honey to crown the Repast.   Then close on his Haunches, so solemn and wise,   The _Frog_ from a Corner, look'd up to the Skies.    And the _Squirrel_ well pleas'd such Diversions to see,   Mounted high over Head, and look'd down from a Tree.   Then out came the _Spider_, with Finger so fine,   To shew his Dexterity on the tight Line.    From one Branch to another, his Cobwebs he slung,   Then quick as an Arrow he darted along,   But just in the Middle,--Oh! shocking to tell,   From his Rope, in an Instant, poor Harlequin fell.  [Illustration: _\"Hung suspended in air,\" &c._]    Yet he touch'd not the Ground, but with Talons outspread,   Hung suspended in Air, at the End of a Thread.   Then the _Grasshopper_ came with a Jerk and a Spring,   Very long was his Leg, though but short was his Wing;    He took but three Leaps, and was soon out of Sight,   Then chirp'd his own Praises the rest of the Night.   With Step so majestic the _Snail_ did advance,   And promis'd the Gazers a Minuet to dance.  [Illustration: _\"With step so Majestic the snail did advance,\"_]    But they all laugh'd so loud that he pull'd in his Head,   And went in his own little Chamber to Bed.   Then, as Evening gave Way to the Shadows of Night,   Their Watchman, the _Glow-worm_, came out with a Light.  [Illustration: _\"So said little Robert, & pacing along,\" &c._]    Then Home let us hasten, while yet we can see,   For no Watchman is waiting for you and for me,   So said little Robert, and pacing along,   His merry Companions returned in a Throng.    END OF THE BUTTERFLY'S BALL."]]]
