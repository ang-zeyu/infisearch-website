Heavy fines were extorted from the rich abbeys; that on Crowland amounting to £64,000 of the present value of money. Elsinus died in 1055.  Arwinus was then elected abbot, but he resigned in 1067 to Leofric. He was nephew to Earl Leofric, of Mercia, whose Countess, according to the chroniclers, redeemed Coventry from toll by riding naked through the streets of that town.  During the third year of this abbot, William the Conqueror invaded England, and we are told that Leofric fought for some time in the English army, but in consequence of ill health, was obliged \"to return to his monastery, where he died on the third of the kalends of November, A.D. 1066.\" Braddo (or Brand) was the next successive abbot, but died after a rule of three years.  Thorold of Fescamp, who for some service rendered to the conqueror, had been appointed to an abbacy near Salisbury, was considered by William, on account of his soldier-like qualities, to be a fit person to transfer to the rebellious and disorderly neighbourhood of the Camp of Refuge, and he was accordingly appointed Abbot of Peterborough, in 1069.  Between the death of Braddo and the arrival of his successor, the second destruction of the monastery took place. A band of Danish soldiers, headed by Hereward de Wake, nephew of Braddo, attacked the monastery, and all the valuable treasures which it possessed were either taken away or destroyed. They then set fire to the building. The following is Gunton's account of the treasures which they captured; and, as it puts us in possession of much curious information concerning those times, we will give the extract entire:--\"They took the golden crown from the head of the crucifix, the cross with the precious stones, and the footstool under; _duo aurea feretra_ (two golden or gilded biers whereon they carried the saints' reliques, and other such like things, in procession), and nine silver ones; and twelve crosses, some of gold and some of silver. And, besides all this, they went up to the tower and took away the great table which the monks had hidden there, which was all of gold, and silver, and precious stones, and wont to be before the altar, with abundance of books, and other precious things, which were valuable, there being not the like in all England.\"  The monks were disconsolate at the loss of these valuable treasures, and the abbot solicited William the King to interfere for them, in order that they might be returned. It appears, however, that the conqueror did not pay much attention to their request; and it is probable that, as he had just after this depredation concluded a treaty of peace with the Danish sovereign, he was unwilling to do anything that should cause a breach of peace between them, especially as they were such troublesome and dangerous enemies. The greater part of the treasure was by some means once more restored to the monks,[5] and, according to the Saxon chronicler, they commenced from this time to build ramparts for their own protection, and for the security of the monastery. Tout Hill[6] in the vineyard field was raised at this time, and there is said to have been a subterraneous passage which ran thence to Croyland and Thorney. This hill was originally called Mount Thorold.  After the arrival of Thorold at Peterborough, being accompanied by 160 well-armed Frenchmen, he proceeded to turn his attention to the Camp of Refuge, situated near Ely; and, joining Ives of Taillebois in an assault upon it, was repulsed by Hereward de Wake, and taken prisoner, with many of the monks; nor was he liberated, according to Dean Patrick, until he had paid three thousand marks. After his liberation, he returned to the monastery, and made himself more odious to the monks than before. He was depraved and dissolute, and, to satisfy his licentious desires, he is said to have made free with the treasury. He introduced two monks likewise into the monastery, who were foreigners, and quite as unscrupulous as himself, in purloining the wealth of the abbey. He was afterwards made a bishop in France, but owing to his utter recklessness of conduct and morality, he was sent back to England four days after: was again admitted abbot of the monastery of _Peterburgh_, where he died in 1098, after an odious government of twenty-eight years.  During the reign of Henry I., the son of the Conqueror, Ernulphus became Abbot of _Peterburgh_. This event took place in the year 1107, and he made several important improvements in the monastery; built a new dormitory and refectory, and completed the chapter-house, which had been left in an unfinished state for several years. He likewise enriched the convent by making an arrangement with all who held in rent the abbey lands to pay tithes to him, and, when they died, that they should give the third part of their estates to be buried in the church. Thus it was that the monastery continued to grow in wealth, and when Ernulphus was made Bishop of Rochester, which happened in 1114, the abbey was entitled to a tithe of 40,800 acres of land.  During the rule of his successor, John de Sais, the monastery was burned down. The fire is said to have occurred accidentally, and such was the violence of the flames, that they reached the village and consumed most of the cottagers' houses. The additions which Ernulphus had made to the abbey, however, are said to have escaped the general ruin.         [1] The most probable etymology of this word is that which is       given by Britton in his History of Peterborough Cathedral,       viz.--\"_Mede_ or _Mead_, a meadow; _ham_, a sheltered habitation;       and _sted, stead_, or _stad_, a bank, station, or place of rest.\"        [2] In cleaning out the river, a little below the bridge, in       June, 1820, a dagger was found, which is supposed to have       belonged to these Danes. It is in the possession of the present       Bishop.        [3] At a meeting of the Archæological Society at Peterborough, in       1861, Mr. Bloxam read a paper in which he denied the authenticity       of this monument, which had previously been regarded as one of       the oldest monumental stones extant. Mr. Bloxam regards it as a       Norman, and not a Saxon work, and some centuries later in date       than the massacre of the monks. He considers that the figures are       not martyred monks with their abbot, but Christ and his eleven       disciples. It has been further conjectured by Canon Westcott       that it is part of the shrine erected over the relics of St.       Kyneburgha, which were removed from Castor to Peterborough during       the Abbacy of Elsinus, A.D. 1005-1055. A fragment of sculpture in       the same style is built into the west wall of the South Transept.        [4] A Saxon King of Northumbria and the second Christian monarch       of that province. An interesting account of this prince, and of       the extraordinary miracles said to have been performed by his       remains after death, will be found in a larger edition of the       Guide to the Cathedral, by Thos. Craddock, Esq. Price 2.6 & 15.        [5] Britton says, on the authority of Gunton, that they sent the       secretary of the monastery over to Denmark, on purpose to obtain       it. It is, however, more probable that Hereward, knowing the       disposition of the Norman abbot would lead him to enrich himself       at the expense of the monastery, took this means of removing       temptation out of the way of Thorold, and subsequently restored       the treasure to the monastery, when there was no longer any       danger of its being appropriated by the abbot.        [6] Toot is an old Saxon word, signifying to stand out, or be       prominent.     CHAPTER II.  _From the Foundation of the New Church, in 1117, to its dissolution as an Abbey by Henry the Eighth, in 1541;--embracing a period of 425 years._   In the first chapter of our history, we traced the rise and progress of the monastery of _Peterburgh_ through a period of 462 years, at the expiration of which time we saw it burned to the ground, with all the treasures which it had accumulated. We have now to witness its restoration, and to follow it until we come to the nineteenth century, through all the ravages which it has survived.  At the time of the eventful destruction which we have mentioned [1116], John de Sais was abbot of the monastery, and had regained for it several of the lands which had been forfeited by his predecessors. He was, according to Gunton, a very learned man, and possessed great strength of mind and decision of character. He showed his energy by the prompt measures which he took to rebuild the abbey after its destruction, and to get all those lands, manors, and fees confirmed to it which it had so long enjoyed, and which continued daily to increase. It was a very long time, however, before the new monastery was built. John de Sais superintended it during his abbacy, but he lived only nine years after he had laid the foundation-stone (which ceremony he performed in the month of March, 1117), and the building was not completed at his death; nor did he succeed in securing to the monastery all its former possessions, although he exerted himself very assiduously to obtain them.  John de Sais was succeeded by Henri de Angeli, in 1128, of whom nothing of moment is recorded. He was a man of no character, and tried to injure the monastery in the estimation of the king, by speaking falsely of the brotherhood. Some writers say that he was detected in his villany by the king, who obliged him to resign his chair, and leave the country; others assert that he quitted England on account of other crimes. All historians agree, however, that he was a very bad man.  The appointment of the next abbot devolved upon the king, and Martin de Vecti was chosen by him to govern the monastery, in 1133. The monks received him with every expression of respect, as he was reported to be a man of profound erudition and good moral character."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20967"],["title","A Guide to Peterborough Cathedral (#2)"],["body"," He began his rule by forwarding the erection of the new monastery, and it was during his abbacy that it was completed and re-dedicated--which latter ceremony was conducted with great pomp, and all the abbots of the neighbouring monasteries, with numbers of the barons and gentry, were present [1140]. It appears that De Vecti was very zealous in the work of improvement, and that he not only built a new gate to the monastery, but formed a new village on the western side of it; altered the place of wharfage, erected a new bridge, planted the present vineyard, and built many new houses near the abbey. He is also said to have re-built the parish church, then situate in St. John's close, in the precincts. The destruction of the castle, which stood near this church, is likewise attributed to this abbot. It is probable that it was situate upon Mount Thorold, or Tout Hill, as it is now called. This hill may yet be seen in a close on the north-western side of the cathedral.  De Vecti ruled twenty-two years, and died in 1155.  After the death of De Vecti, the monks resolved to maintain the right which they possessed of choosing their own abbot, and William de Waterville was elected by them to the government of the monastery: their choice was afterwards ratified by the king. Waterville was formerly a chaplain to Henry II., and having some influence with him, he regained for his abbey \"the eight hundreds of that part of the country which had formerly been granted by the king's predecessors;\" and, being firmly established in the monastery, he turned his attention to the improvement of the town. He founded a hospital for the sick in Spitalfield; built St. Martin's church and St. Michael's nunnery, at Stamford--besides settling a yearly sum upon the church of St. John Baptist,[7] _Peterburgh_--covering the monastery with lead, and founding the chapel of Thomas à Becket.  It is stated by Gunton, that this chapel is in \"the middle of the arch of the church porch,\" but this is an error which it will be well to correct. The present school-house near the minster gateway is found to be the chancel of the chapel; and it is thus described by Kennel--\"The chapel of the blessed Thomas the Martyr, near the outer gate of the abbey there.\"  After a government of 20 years, Waterville was deposed, at the instigation of the monks, by the Archbishop of Canterbury. No positive crime was alleged against him--at least the monks have not mentioned any in their accounts of the monastery.  The next abbot of whom we read is Benedict, a man of great learning, who was appointed to the rule of the monastery by the king in 1177, after he had held it in his possession two years. The abbot brought several relics to the monastery, and finished the chapel of Thomas à Becket. He was very zealous likewise in his endeavours to re-obtain the abbey lands which had been forfeited or seized during the rule of his predecessors; nor was he scrupulous of the means which he took to effect it: sometimes he took possession of them by force, and at others he tried to conciliate the usurpers by large sums of money and fair promises.  The monastery, during his government, underwent many important changes. He rebuilt the whole body of the church, \"from the lantern to the porch;\" and it is the opinion of Gunton, that the curiously painted ceiling which covers the middle of the building was of his workmanship. He likewise added several houses to those which were already within the precincts of the abbey, and built the present gate which leads to the west front of the cathedral, with a chapel over it, which was dedicated to St. Nicholas.[8]  Benedict likewise obtained a charter for holding a fair upon the feast of St. Peter, and a market to be held every Thursday. The fair was to continue eight days.  This abbot ruled seventeen years, and died in 1194.  Andreas succeeded Benedict, and rose gradually from a monk to a prior, and finally to an abbot. It is said that he was a good man, and secured the esteem of the monks by giving them the lands of Fletton and Alwalton to enrich their table. He ordered likewise six marks a year to be given out of the monastery funds to the infirmary. This donation was continued by his successors for a long time, but Abbot Walter, during his rule, directed that it should be employed in purchasing wine for the \"pitanciary.\"  During the reign of Andreas there were several lands given to the \"Eleemossynary,\" and the monastery was very flourishing. He governed seven years, and died in 1201. His body was entombed in the south aisle, with two of his brethren, under a Norman arch, beneath which is the following epitaph:--      Hos tres abbates quibus est prior abba Iohannes,     Alter Martinus, Andreas ultimus, unus     Hic claudit tumulus; pro clausis ergo rogemus.  Acharius succeeded Andreas in 1200. He was originally a prior of St. Albans, but was presented by King John to the abbacy of this monastery, on account of his many virtues and distinguished talents. He seems to have had the interest of the monastery at heart as greatly as any of his predecessors, and was engaged in several lawsuits with different landowners, in order to recover the lost possessions of the abbey. He gained the marsh of Singlesholt from the Abbot of Crowland \"for a yearly acknowledgement of four stones of wax,\" and increased the number of his monks. He endowed the church with many valuable articles--such as silver basins for the great altar, with a case of gold and silver, set with precious stones, for the arm of St. Oswald! He gave likewise two large silver cups to the refectory, with silver feet richly gilt, according to Gunton, and four table knives with ivory hafts. He paid money off the monastery debts, and purchased houses in London, which he added to the abbey possessions.  During the festival of St. Peter, a large wax candle, of five pounds weight,[9] was set before the altar, and burnt day and night, until the festival was completed. This custom was observed in all other feasts of the saints in the abbey; and during the rule of Acharius the festivals were remarkable for their pomp and splendour.  This abbot ruled ten years, died in 1214, and was succeeded by Robert of Lindsay, or Lyndesheye.  It was during the rule of this abbot that one of the most interesting changes was effected in the monastery: the windows until this time had been \"stuffed with straw,\" to keep out the cold and the rain; and, at an immense expense, he had thirty-nine of them adorned with glass, which enterprise gained for him a considerable amount of fame and esteem. Not content with this change in his own monastery, he extended his generosity to other parts, and built a chancel to the church at Oxney. He was confirmed by the king at Winchester, and received the benediction of the Bishop of Lincoln.  Being thus installed in his new office with so much honour, he directed his attention to the forest lands by which he was surrounded. By virtue of the forest laws, foresters let their cattle run at liberty to graze, and they frequently did much damage to the possessions of the monastery, and to the property of the town inhabitants. Lindsay therefore wrote to the king to try to \"disafforest\" the lands which were contiguous to the monastery, and he effected his object by payment of 1320 marks. Of his other improvements we read that \"he made in the south cloister a lavatory of marble, for the monks to wash their hands in when they went to meals--their hall being near on the other side of the wall, the door leading into it being yet standing; the lavatory continued entire until the year 1651, and then, with the whole cloister, it was also pulled down.\"  About this time, in the reign of King John, England was the scene of those civil contentions which terminated in favour of the barons, and the attainment of a charter of liberties. A large number of the monasteries in England were, however, despoiled by the king before the fate of the war was decided, and amongst them was Crowland Abbey. It is likely that of _Peterburgh_ escaped the fury of the king's soldiers, for we do not read of any outrage being committed upon it at that time in the monkish records. Lindsay wrote a history of the monastery, according to Pitseus, but he did not enrich the church library with any valuable additions. He ruled seven years, and died in 1222.  Alexander de Holderness was the successor of Lindsay, and was elected November 30, 1222. He was called Holderness from the place where he was born. This abbot made a number of improvements in his monastery, and enriched it with money and relics. He built, says Gunton, \"_the solarium magnum_ at the door of the abbot's chamber, and a _cellerarium_ under it, and furnished the church also with that precious crystal vessel wherein the blood of Thomas à Becket was kept.\" He likewise built halls at Oundle, Castor, Eyebury, and other places. He was much beloved by the monks, and died, after a government of four years, in 1226.  An interesting incident in connexion with this abbot may here be mentioned. On the 2nd of April, 1830, when the workmen were making a foundation in the cathedral church for the erection of a new choir, they discovered beneath one of the slabs a stone coffin, which their curiosity led them to open. They were surprised to find that it contained the body of a man, with a large coarse garment around it, equipped with boots, and having a crosier by its side. There were several very remarkable things connected with this discovery. The boots were what are called \"rights and lefts,\" and in a good state of preservation. The crosier was perfect, and a part of the body was hard, and of a copper-coloured hue, whilst the other part was decomposed. The body was headless, and a piece of lead was found lying in _place of the skull_, with this inscription upon it--      ABBAS: ALEXANDR:  These remains were gathered together, replaced in the shell, and buried in the south aisle, nearly "]]]
