Anyway, I left home before the mail carrier was due.\"  \"Guv'nor said that was likely to happen,\" continued Fred. \"So he told me, if I saw you fellows on the ice, to say that he wanted to see you.\"  \"All of us?\" Dave wanted to know.  \"I reckon so. And the guv'nor said it was important, too. You boobs had better crank up your skates and make fast time. Guv'nor won't be at his office late to-day.\"  \"What----\" began Dick.  \"The guv'nor gave me a message to you fellows, and I've delivered it,\" cut in Fred airily, as he started to skate away. \"That's all I've got to do in the matter. I don't care to stand here all day. Somebody that knew me might come along and catch me talking with you.\"  \"The snob!\" muttered Dave indignantly.  \"What on earth can the lawyer want of us?\" pondered Greg.  \"Generally, when a lawyer sends for you, it means trouble,\" guessed Dalzell.  \"Or else some relative has died and left you a lot of money,\" added Harry Hazelton.  \"Well, in any case,\" replied Dick, \"we six fellows haven't the same relative, anywhere, and Fred said his father wanted to see all of us.\"  \"We haven't been doing anything--nothing wrong, anyway,\" declared Dan virtuously.  \"We won't know the answer until we've seen Mr. Ripley,\" declared Dick. \"We'll have to go around there after dinner to-day.\"  \"Why not go now?\" proposed Tom Reade. \"We haven't anything special to do with our time.\"  \"You fellows haven't much imagination, have you?\" laughed Dave, his eyes twinkling mysteriously.  \"Have you guessed?\" demanded Dick Prescott.  \"Well, it's only a guess, of course, and it may be a wild one.\"  \"Out with it!\" ordered Tom Reade sharply.  \"You know, fellows,\" Dave continued, \"that we did some service for Mrs. Dexter last fall, and that she tried to reward us. Now that she's gone away to parts unknown, perhaps you also know that Lawyer Ripley is managing her money affairs these days.\"  \"Then----\" gasped Greg.  \"Why, fellows, now that Mrs. Dexter is away, and we can't stop her, and as to-morrow will be Christmas, why, perhaps----\"  Not one single member of Dick & Co. was at all lacking in imagination now!  \"Why, do you think----\"  \"I wonder if----\"  \"Fellows,\" hinted Dick Prescott dryly, and in a tone that hid the excitement going on within him, \"it won't take us long to skate back to Gridley!\"     CHAPTER II  DICK & CO. FIND CAUSE FOR GLEE   Lawyer Ripley was one of the important men of the little city of Gridley. His law practice, which he did not now follow on account of the need of an income, put him in touch with all the wealthier people of the place.  In manner the lawyer was rather severe and austere. He was a good deal of an aristocrat. While he did not seek to repel people, he had little of the knack of drawing people to him in democratic fashion.  \"Come in!\" he called, in answer to the knock that Dick gave on the door.  As the boys entered they saw the lawyer pausing beside his coat rack.  \"I am afraid we have gotten along a little too late, sir,\" apologized Dick Prescott.  \"I can spare you two or three minutes,\" said the lawyer, turning and going back to his desk.  \"Your son said you wished to see us,\" Prescott continued.  \"Yes,\" said the lawyer, pulling a drawer in his desk open and glancing inside. \"Late yesterday afternoon I received a letter from my client, Mrs. Dexter, who directed me to hand you each a new ten-dollar bill, with her best wishes for a Merry Christmas added.\"  \"I am afraid that Mrs. Dexter intends that as a reward for what we were able to do for her last fall,\" cried Dick, flushing. \"We tried to tell her, at the time, that we didn't want any reward and that we wouldn't feel comfortable in taking one.\"  \"Nothing was said in Mrs. Dexter's letter about a reward,\" replied the lawyer dryly. \"She directed me to hand you the banknotes in place of Christmas cards. I suppose you young gentlemen have no objection to receiving Christmas cards?\"  Lawyer Ripley took out several banknotes. One of these he now held out to Prescott.  Dick flushed again, looked embarrassed, then reached out his hand slowly and took the money.  \"Will you send Mrs. Dexter our thanks, sir, and tell her that we enjoyed the cards very much?\"  \"Especially the pictures on them,\" added Dan Dalzell, as he received his banknote.  \"I will send all your messages,\" nodded the lawyer, as he continued the distribution.  \"Say--whoop!\" suddenly exploded Greg Holmes.  \"What's the matter--yours counterfeit?\" laughed Dan.  \"Say, fellows,\" Greg went on, \"we were wishing we had the funds to build some sort of a camp. We can do it, now, can't we?\"  \"What kind of camp?\" inquired Lawyer Ripley, looking mildly interested. \"And for what would you use a camp?\"  \"Why, for camping, I suppose,\" confessed Greg.  \"You wouldn't live in a tent, at this time of the year, would you?\"  \"If we had to,\" assented young Holmes. \"What we were talking about was building some kind of a shack in the woods somewhere.\"  \"Rather a bad time of the year for building operations,\" smiled Lawyer Ripley dryly.  \"But this wouldn't be so very much of an operation, sir,\" urged Greg. \"Now that we've sixty dollars between us, we ought to be able to buy enough lumber to put up quite a shanty.\"  \"Yes; and probably have enough money left to pay for the teaming of the lumber a few miles,\" agreed the man of law. \"But there wouldn't be enough to pay the carpenters.\"  \"We might be able to build a small shack ourselves,\" proposed Tom Reade.  \"Why, so you might,\" admitted the lawyer, half smiling. \"However, any task that is worth doing is much better done by one used to that kind of work. When do you want to go camping?\"  \"Why, right after to-morrow, Christmas,\" replied Dick. \"We could stay in the woods, if our parents let us go, until about the end of the present vacation.\"  \"It would take you at least that length of time to build the shack, I should think,\" suggested the lawyer. \"Until you had it built you might have to wrap up in the snow at night for your sleep. And, then, when you had it all built, you would discover that the shack didn't belong to you, but to the owner of the land on which you built it. He could order you away from the shack if he were so disposed.\"  \"I hadn't thought of that,\" admitted Greg, looking crestfallen.  \"I'm afraid we won't camp,\" spoke up Harry Hazelton.  \"The greatest difficulty,\" suggested the lawyer, \"would be getting the consent of your parents to any such madcap scheme as going off into the woods to camp, day after day, in mid-winter.\"  \"There might be some difficulty about that, sir,\" replied Prescott. \"But now it looks as though the one really big problem would be to get a camp on the money that we now have, and to be ready to go into it in season during this school vacation.\"  \"That would really be but a very slight difficulty,\" rejoined the lawyer.  \"I wish I could see how you make that out, sir.\"  \"Why, as it happens, in the property that Mrs. Dexter's grandfather left her there's the strip called Hobson's woods, you know. The forest is a pretty big affair. In fact, it's what's generally called wild country. But there are a thousand acres of the woods, worth about four dollars an acre, that now belong to Mrs. Dexter. She authorized me to find a buyer for that bit of the forest, but it seems to be out of the question. Now, on Mrs. Dexter's land, in about the middle of it, and less than two hundred feet off the main trail, is one of the few real old log cabins left in this part of the United States. The cabin is in pretty good repair, too, I fancy, for Mrs. Dexter's grandfather used to do logging out that way. Later in his life, when he had amassed money, the old gentleman used to go out to that cabin to live for a while, two or three times in every year. The place was in excellent repair when he died. It is still, I imagine.\"  There was a breathless silence as the lawyer ceased speaking. How the thought of that log cabin, out in the deep forest, appealed to the imaginations of such Grammar School boys as these!  \"Well, sir?\" asked Greg breathlessly, at last.  \"Young men, if your parents should consent to your going on such a wild, madcap picnic in mid-winter, I would let you have the use of that cabin. But you may have the use of the cabin at any other time, as long as the cabin remains in Mrs. Dexter's name, so I would suggest your going in the spring or summer.\"  \"Oh, pshaw!\" leaped to Greg Holmes's lips, but he choked back the exclamation. What use would boys have for a log cabin in summer, when there was a chance to use it in mid-winter? Besides, the summer seemed a long way off.  \"Is there any water near the cabin, Mr. Ripley?\" asked Tom Reade, who possessed a practical head in such matters.  \"Yes; a spring, within perhaps twenty or thirty feet of the doorway,\" nodded the lawyer. \"Inside the cabin is one of the big, old-fashioned fire-places----\"  \"O-o-oh! A-a-ah!\" gasped the youngsters in chorus.  \"There are also eight bunks in the place, each with a straw or dry-leaf mattress,\" continued Mr. Ripley. \"There are table and chairs, hand made and of the crudest kind, and some few tools.\"  \"Say, wouldn't that make an ideal camp?\" demanded Dick Prescott, turning to his chums, his eyes glowing.  All their faces were flushed with the excitement of the thing. Now that it was so close, and practical, all the boys of Dick & Co. felt a wild desire to be up and away for camp at once.  \"And you say we may have the cabin, sir, and the right to cut some firewood in the forest?\" Dick asked.  \"I said you could, if you had your parents' full and free permission to go,\" replied Lawyer Ripley. \"That, I fancy, is a very different thing.\"  \"But if we get that permission, sir,\" urged Dick, \"and come back and tell"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2079"],["title","From the Memoirs of a Minister of France (#1)"],["body","from his horse and, throwing the reins to one of the pages, was bowing before her.  \"We were about to sound the horn, Mademoiselle,\" he said, smiling.  \"The horn, Monsieur?\"  she exclaimed, opening her eyes in wonder, and staring at him with the prettiest face of astonishment.  \"Yes, Mademoiselle; to awaken the sleeping princess,\" he rejoined. \"But I see that she is already awake.\"  Through the innocence of her eyes flashed a sudden gleam of archness. \"Monsieur flatters himself,\" she said, with a smile that just revealed the whiteness of her teeth.  It was such an answer as delighted the King; who loved, above all things, a combination of wit and beauty, and never for any long time wore the chains of a woman who did not unite sense to more showy attractions.  From the effect which the grace and freshness of the girl had on me, I could judge in a degree of the impression made on him; his next words showed not only its depth, but that he was determined to enjoy the adventure to the full. He presented me to her as M. de Sage, and inquiring affectionately after Perrot, learned in a trice that she was his niece, not long from a convent at Loches; finally, begging to be allowed to rest awhile, he dropped a gallant hint that a cup of wine from her hands would be acceptable.  All this, and her innocent doubt what she ought to do, thus brought face to face with two strange cavaliers, threw the girl into such a state of blushing confusion as redoubled her charms. It appeared that her uncle had been summoned unexpectedly to Marly, and had taken his son with him; and that the household had seized the occasion to go to a village FETE at Acheres.  Only an old servant remained in the house; who presently appeared and took her orders.  I saw from the man's start of consternation that he knew the King; but a glance from Henry's eyes bidding me keep up the illusion, I followed the fellow and charged him not to betray the King's incognito.  When I returned, I found that Mademoiselle had conducted her visitor to a grassy terrace which ran along the south side of the house, and was screened from the forest by an alley of apple trees, and from the east wind by a hedge of yew. Here, where the last rays of the sun threw sinuous shadows on the turf, and Paris seemed a million miles away, they were walking up and down, the sound of their laughter breaking the woodland silence. Mademoiselle had a fan, with which and an air of convent coquetry she occasionally shaded her eyes.  The King carried his hat in his hand. It was such an adventure as he loved, with all his heart; and I stood a little way off, smiling, and thinking grimly of M. de Perrot.  On a sudden, hearing a step behind me, I turned, and saw a young man in a riding-dress come quickly through an opening in the yew hedge.  As I turned, he stopped; his jaw fell, and he stood rooted to the ground, gazing at the two on the terrace, while his face, which a moment before had worn an air of pleased expectancy, grew on a sudden dark with passion, and put on such a look as made me move towards him.  Before I reached him, However, M. de Perrot himself appeared at his side.  The young man flashed round on him.  \"MON DIEU, sir!\"  he cried, in a voice choked with anger; \"I see it all now!  I understand why I was carried away to Marly!  I--but it shall not be!  I swear it shall not!\"  Between him and me--for, needless to say, I, too, understood all--M. de Perrot was awkwardly placed.  But he showed the presence of mind of the old courtier.  \"Silence, sir!\"  He exclaimed imperatively.  \"Do you not see M. de Rosny?  Go to him at once and pay your respects to him, and request him to honour you with his protection.  Or--I see that you are overcome by the honour which the King does us.  Go, first, and change your dress.  Go, boy!\"  The lad retired sullenly, and M. de Perrot, free to deal with me alone, approached me, smiling assiduously, and trying hard to hide some consciousness and a little shame under a mask of cordiality.  \"A thousand pardons, M. de Rosny,\" he cried with effusion, \"for an absence quite unpardonable.  But I so little expected to see his Majesty after what you said, and--\"  \"Are in no hurry to interrupt him now you are here,\" I replied bluntly, determined that, whoever he deceived, he should not flatter himself he deceived me.  \"Pooh, man!  I am not a fool,\" I continued.  \"What is this?\"  he cried, with a desperate attempt to keep up the farce.  \"I don't understand you!\"  \"No, the shoe is on the other foot--I understand you,\" I replied drily. \"Chut, man!\"  I continued, \"you don't make a cats-paw of me.  I see the game.  You are for sitting in Madame de Sourdis' seat, and giving your son a Hat, and your groom a Comptrollership, and your niece a--\"  \"Hush, hush, M. de Rosny,\" he muttered, turning white and red, and wiping his brow with his kerchief.  \"MON DIEU!  your words might--\"  \"If overheard, make things very unpleasant for M. de Perrot,\" I said.  \"And M. de Rosny?\"  I shrugged my shoulders contemptuously.  \"Tush, man!\"  I said. \"Do you think that I sit in no safer seat than that?\"  \"Ah!  But when Madame de Beaufort is Queen?\"  he said slily.  \"If she ever is,\" I replied, affecting greater confidence than I at that time felt.  \"Well, to be sure,\" he said slowly, \"if she ever is.\"  And he looked towards the King and his companion, who were still chatting gaily. Then he stole a crafty glance at me.  \"Do you wish her to be?\"  he muttered.  \"Queen?\"  I said, \"God forbid!\"  \"It would be a disgrace to France?\"  he whispered; and he laid his hand on my arm, and looked eagerly into my face.  \"Yes,\" I said.  \"A blot on his fame?\"  I nodded.  \"A--a slur on a score of noble families?\"  I could not deny it.  \"Then--is it not worth while to avoid all that?\"  he murmured, his face pale, and his small eyes glued to mine.  \"Is it not worth a little--sacrifice, M. de Rosny?\"  \"And risk?\"  I said.  \"Possibly.\"  While the words were still on my lips, something stirred close to us, behind the yew hedge beside which we were standing.  Perrot darted in a moment to the opening, and I after him.  We were just in time to catch a glimpse of a figure disappearing round the corner of the house. \"Well,\" I said grimly, \"what about being overheard now?\"  M. de Perrot wiped his face.  \"Thank Heaven!\"  he said, \"it was only my son.  Now let me explain to you--\"  But our hasty movement had caught the King's eye, and he came towards us, covering himself as he approached.  I had now an opportunity of learning whether the girl was, in fact, as innocent as she seemed, and as every particular of our reception had declared her; and I watched her closely when Perrot's mode of address betrayed the King's identity. Suffice it that the vivid blush which on the instant suffused her face, and the lively emotion which almost overcame her, left me in no doubt. With a charming air of bashfulness, and just so much timid awkwardness as rendered her doubly bewitching, she tried to kneel and kiss the King's hand.  He would not permit this, however, but saluted her cheek.  \"It seems that you were right, sire,\" she murmured, curtseying in a pretty confusion, \"The princess was not awake.\"  Henry laughed gaily.  \"Come now; tell me frankly, Mademoiselle,\" he said.  \"For whom did you take me?\"  \"Not for the King, sire,\" she answered, with a gleam of roguishness. \"You told me that the King was a good man, whose benevolent impulses were constantly checked--\"  \"Ah!\"  \"By M. de Rosny, his Minister.\"  The outburst of laughter which greeted this apprised her that she was again at fault; and Henry, who liked nothing better than such mystifications, introducing me by my proper name, we diverted ourselves for some minutes with her alarm and excuses.  After that it was time to take leave, if we would sup at home and the King would not be missed; and accordingly, but not without some further badinage, in which Mademoiselle de Brut displayed wit equal to her beauty, and an agreeable refinement not always found with either, we departed.  It should be clearly understood at this point, that, notwithstanding all I have set down, I was fully determined (in accordance with a rule I have constantly followed, and would enjoin on all who do not desire to find themselves one day saddled with an ugly name) to have no part in the affair; and this though the advantage of altering the King's intentions towards Madame de Beaufort was never more vividly present to my mind.  As we rode, indeed, he put several questions concerning the Baron, and his family, and connections; and, falling into a reverie, and smiling a good deal at his thoughts, left me in no doubt as to the impression made upon him.  But being engaged at the time with the Spanish treaty, and resolved, as I have said, to steer a course uninfluenced by such intrigues, I did not let my mind dwell upon the matter; nor gave it, indeed, a second thought until the next afternoon, when, sitting at an open window of my lodging, I heard a voice in the street ask where the Duchess de Beaufort had her apartment.  The voice struck a chord in my memory, and I looked out.  The man who had put the question, and who was now being directed on his way--by Maignan, my equerry, as it chanced had his back to me, and I could see only that he was young, shabbily dressed, and with the air of a workman carried a small frail of tools on his shoulder.  But presently, in the act of thanking Maignan, he turned so that I saw his face, and with that it flashed upon me in a moment who he was.  Accustomed to follow a train of thought quickly, and to act; on its conclusion with energy, I had Maignan called and furnished with his instructions before the man had gone twenty paces; and within the minute I had the satisfaction of seeing the two return together.  As they passed under the window I heard my servant explaining with the utmost naturalness that he had misunderstood the stranger, and that this was Madame de"]]]
