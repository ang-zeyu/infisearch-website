You will, of course, become squatters--by far the best business for young men of enterprise and activity.  What do you say to it?\"  \"We should like nothing better, sir,\" answered James.  \"But--I speak again for my brother as well as for myself--we cannot accept payment for performing a mere act of duty; your advice and assistance may be of the greatest value to us, and of that we will gladly avail ourselves.  The young man who helped us to stop the horses must, of course, speak for himself.\"  \"Well, well, I admire your independence and high feeling,\" answered Mr Prentiss.  \"I doubt, however, that you will find many in this country to consider that you are right; but perhaps I may be of service to you in the way you desire.  You, of course, will make my house your home while you remain in Sydney; when you wish to commence your life in the bush, I will send you up the country to my father and some brothers of mine, who will put you in the way of a fair start.  Your young shipmate fairly earned a portion of the reward; he also deserves my gratitude.  He looks as if there was work in him, and to such a person I can be permanently of use.  Unhappily, numbers of men come out here--they may be counted by hundreds or thousands--who will not work, or who cannot work; nothing suits them.  They come with pockets full of letters, expecting first-rate situations with nothing to do.  How can such people be assisted to any advantage?  Give them money, and they squander it; place them in situations of trust, and they are dismissed as incompetent, or they throw them up as uncongenial to their tastes.  All we want in this magnificent country are people who will try to work, and if they do not succeed in one thing, will turn their hands to something else.  There is ample room, I say, for persons of every possible description, provided always that they belong to the `try' school.\"  Mr Prentiss insisted on taking his guests round the town to visit its lions; and greatly surprised they were to see the wonderful progress it had already made.  \"Wool has done it all!  Well may the golden fleece be our emblem!\" he observed.  At the late dinner hour they were introduced to Mrs Prentiss and two daughters--the young lady they had before seen and a younger sister. All awkwardness soon wore off, and they felt themselves perfectly at home.  Mr Prentiss had a conversation with Sam, the result of which made him supremely happy; his satisfaction was not decreased either when, two days afterwards, Sykes brought him his bag of clothes.  \"Don't ask questions, young man,\" he observed, as he handed them; \"there are few of the old hands I don't know, and I guessed who had your property.\"  Pleasant as the two young Gilpins found their stay in Sydney, they did not disguise their anxiety to be off into the country; and their new friend accordingly made arrangements for their journey.    CHAPTER TWO.  A dray, similar in construction to that used by brewers in England, but drawn by oxen, and laden with all sorts of stores, such as are required on an Australian farm--tea, carpenters' tools and agricultural implements, groceries and casks of liquor, clothing and furniture--was making its way towards the north-east from Sydney.  There was the bullock-driver in charge, with his chum, a newly hired hand, and Sam Green, who walked or sat on the dray; while the two Gilpins rode alongside on horses, provided by Mr Prentiss.  They were dressed more in the Australian style than when they landed, and in a way much better suited to the climate.  The road had been excellent for a hundred miles or more, with numerous villages near it, and a large proportion of houses of entertainment, so that they had no want of accommodation when they halted.  They had now for some time left the high-road, and though there were inns, and occasionally villages, and farms, and stock stations, they had sometimes to depend on their own resources, and to bivouac in the bush.  This the young immigrants found by far the pleasantest part of their journey.  The oxen were turned loose to graze at leisure; sticks were collected, and a fire lighted for boiling the tea-kettle and cooking the damper.  The old hands troubled themselves very little about their night's lodging; they, like Sam Green, were satisfied with the bare ground under the dray if it threatened rain, or anywhere near it if the weather was fine.  A small tent had been provided by Mr Prentiss, which, with some ticking filled with dry grass, gave the Gilpins a luxurious lodging for the night.  They could scarcely go to sleep on turning in for their first real night in the bush, from the novelty of the scene and the prospects opening up to them.  Before dawn they both started up, awoke by the strangest and most discordant sounds.  \"What can it be?\" cried James.  \"An attack of the blacks,\" said Arthur, rubbing his eyes.  \"But no! Listen!  They are birds, I verily believe; but the strangest birds I ever heard.\"  He was right: there was the hideous, unearthly cry of the laughing-jackass, called often the bushman's clock; the screaming cry of thousands of parrots flying here and there through the forest; there was the cackle of the wattle-bird, the clear notes of the magpie, and the confused chattering of thousands of leather-heads; while many other birds added their notes to the discordant chorus, and speedily banished sleep from the eyes of their hearers.  The stockmen started to their feet, and hurried off to bring in the oxen and horses; a fire was lighted, tea boiled, breakfast discussed with considerable rapidity; and, before the sun was up, the party had recommenced their journey along the dusty dray-track--for as yet it deserved that name rather than a road.  The scenery was varied, and often very beautiful when viewed under a clear blue sky and bright sun.  The beds of streams were frequently passed, but they were either dry altogether, or occasional holes only with water in them could be seen here and there along the course, or, if nowhere dry, they were easily forded.  The Irish bullock-driver, Larry Killock, told Sam that, in the rainy season, these were often foaming torrents, rushing on with terrific noise, and sweeping away everything they meet.  \"Many a poor fellow has been drowned in trying to cross on horseback where, perhaps, he went over with dry feet a few days before,\" said Larry.  \"That's after the snow melts,\" observed Sam.  \"Snow! man alive!  It's a small matter of snow comes down from the sky in this beautiful country, except, now and then, on the top of the Blue Mountains out there; though, as for frosts, it's cold enough on the high ground in July and August, when the south wind blows, to make a fellow blow his fingers to keep them warm, and to think a blazing fire and a blanket pleasant companions.\"  Sam thought that Larry was quizzing him, but still he did not like to accuse him directly.  \"It's a strange country this, then, muster, I'm thinking,\" he remarked cautiously.  \"Strange!  It is a strange country, faith!\" answered Larry.  \"It is summer here when, by all dacent rules, it should be winter; the south wind is cold, and the north blazing hot.  There are creatures with four legs which have ducks' heads; and birds, with long legs and no wings, as tall as horses; while some of the animals stow their young away in a bag in front of them, instead of letting them follow properly at their heels, as pigs and ducks and hens do in the old country.  The trees shed their bark instead of their leaves; and it's only just surprising to me that the people walk on their feet instead of their heads, and that the sun thinks fit to rise in the east instead of the west; and it's often when I wake in the mornin' that I look out expecting to see that he's grown tired of his old ways, and changed to suit the other things in the land.\"  Sam, who could appreciate an English style of joke, was unable to make out whether or not the Irishman was in earnest; but he thought it wise to wait till he could learn the truth from his young friends, when they camped in the evening.  \"It's only just come out, ye are?\" asked Larry.  Sam told him all about himself, as he had told Sykes, expecting an equal amount of communicativeness in return.  \"You've been some time in the country, master, I'm thinking?  How did you come out?\"  Larry looked at him with a twinkle in his eye.  \"Faith, that's just a sacret between myself and them who knows all about it,\" he answered, with a laugh.  \"It's my belief that the big-wigs across the fish-pond had just an idea of the mighty great value I'd be to the country, and sent me out free of all charge to myself and family intirely.\"  The scenery improved as the travellers advanced, and contrasted favourably with the dusty, stony, and worn-out region through which they had passed nearer the capital.  \"Horrible farming!\" observed James; \"if such were practised in England universally, the whole country would become a desert in a few years.\"  Sometimes they passed through scenery like that of a park in England, with open green pastures sprinkled with clumps of trees; some deserving the names of woods, others consisting but of a few trees.  The greater number were _Eucalypti_ the evergreen gum, and stringy-bark trees; but on the banks of streams and on the hillsides, and sometimes in rich, alluvial valleys, such as are found in the northern hemisphere and in less sunny climes, were to be seen flowers, of great size and beauty, such as flourish only in greenhouses in England; while a great variety of the orchis tribe, and geraniums, both large and small, were found in great profusion.  The trees, the names of many of which were given by Larry, bore little or no resemblance to those of the same name at home. Among the most common were the box, wattle, and cherry; but undoubtedly the most prominent everywhere in the landscape were the old gum trees, and the huge iron stringy-bark trees, which, now with shattered"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2147"],["title","The Works of Edgar Allan Poe — Volume 1 (#1)"],["body","to his       duties, and occasionally a scene of violence and difficulty. Time       went on, however, and he was invariably punctual and industrious.       We saw but one presentiment of the man—a quiet, patient,       industrious and most gentlemanly person.        “We heard, from one who knew him well (what should be stated in       all mention of his lamentable irregularities), that with a single       glass of wine his whole nature was reversed, the demon became       uppermost, and, though none of the usual signs of intoxication       were visible, his will was palpably insane. In this reversed       character, we repeat, it was never our chance to meet him.”        On September 22, 1835, Poe married his cousin, Virginia Clemm, in       Baltimore. She had barely turned thirteen years, Poe himself was       but twenty-six. He then was a resident of Richmond and a regular       contributor to the “Southern Literary Messenger.” It was not       until a year later that the bride and her widowed mother followed       him thither.        Poe’s devotion to his child-wife was one of the most beautiful       features of his life. Many of his famous poetic productions were       inspired by her beauty and charm. Consumption had marked her for       its victim, and the constant efforts of husband and mother were       to secure for her all the comfort and happiness their slender       means permitted. Virginia died January 30, 1847, when but       twenty-five years of age. A friend of the family pictures the       death-bed scene—mother and husband trying to impart warmth to her       by chafing her hands and her feet, while her pet cat was suffered       to nestle upon her bosom for the sake of added warmth.        These verses from “Annabel Lee,” written by Poe in 1849, the last       year of his life, tell of his sorrow at the loss of his       child-wife:       _I_ was a child and _she_ was a child,     In a kingdom by the sea;      But we loved with a love that was more than love—     I and my Annabel Lee;      With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven     Coveted her and me.      And this was the reason that, long ago,     In this kingdom by the sea.      A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling     My beautiful Annabel Lee;      So that her high-born kinsmen came     And bore her away from me,      To shut her up in a sepulchre     In this kingdom by the sea.        Poe was connected at various times and in various capacities with       the “Southern Literary Messenger” in Richmond, Va.; “Graham’s       Magazine” and the “Gentleman’s Magazine” in Philadelphia; the       “Evening Mirror,” the “Broadway Journal,” and “Godey’s Lady’s       Book” in New York. Everywhere Poe’s life was one of unremitting       toil. No tales and poems were ever produced at a greater cost of       brain and spirit.        Poe’s initial salary with the “Southern Literary Messenger,” to       which he contributed the first drafts of a number of his       best-known tales, was $10 a week! Two years later his salary was       but $600 a year. Even in 1844, when his literary reputation was       established securely, he wrote to a friend expressing his       pleasure because a magazine to which he was to contribute had       agreed to pay him $20 monthly for two pages of criticism.        Those were discouraging times in American literature, but Poe       never lost faith. He was finally to triumph wherever pre-eminent       talents win admirers. His genius has had no better description       than in this stanza from William Winter’s poem, read at the       dedication exercises of the Actors’ Monument to Poe, May 4, 1885,       in New York:       He was the voice of beauty and of woe,      Passion and mystery and the dread unknown;      Pure as the mountains of perpetual snow,      Cold as the icy winds that round them moan,      Dark as the caves wherein earth’s thunders groan,      Wild as the tempests of the upper sky,      Sweet as the faint, far-off celestial tone of angel whispers,      fluttering from on high,      And tender as love’s tear when youth and beauty die.        In the two and a half score years that have elapsed since Poe’s       death he has come fully into his own. For a while Griswold’s       malignant misrepresentations colored the public estimate of Poe       as man and as writer. But, thanks to J. H. Ingram, W. F. Gill,       Eugene Didier, Sarah Helen Whitman and others these scandals have       been dispelled and Poe is seen as he actually was—not as a man       without failings, it is true, but as the finest and most original       genius in American letters. As the years go on his fame       increases. His works have been translated into many foreign       languages. His is a household name in France and England—in fact,       the latter nation has often uttered the reproach that Poe’s own       country has been slow to appreciate him. But that reproach, if it       ever was warranted, certainly is untrue.  W. H. R.     EDGAR ALLAN POE   By James Russell Lowell        The situation of American literature is anomalous. It has no       centre, or, if it have, it is like that of the sphere of Hermes.       It is divided into many systems, each revolving round its several       suns, and often presenting to the rest only the faint glimmer of       a milk-and-water way. Our capital city, unlike London or Paris,       is not a great central heart from which life and vigor radiate to       the extremities, but resembles more an isolated umbilicus stuck       down as near as may be to the centre of the land, and seeming       rather to tell a legend of former usefulness than to serve any       present need. Boston, New York, Philadelphia, each has its       literature almost more distinct than those of the different       dialects of Germany; and the Young Queen of the West has also one       of her own, of which some articulate rumor barely has reached us       dwellers by the Atlantic.        Perhaps there is no task more difficult than the just criticism       of contemporary literature. It is even more grateful to give       praise where it is needed than where it is deserved, and       friendship so often seduces the iron stylus of justice into a       vague flourish, that she writes what seems rather like an epitaph       than a criticism. Yet if praise be given as an alms, we could not       drop so poisonous a one into any man’s hat. The critic’s ink may       suffer equally from too large an infusion of nutgalls or of       sugar. But it is easier to be generous than to be just, and we       might readily put faith in that fabulous direction to the hiding       place of truth, did we judge from the amount of water which we       usually find mixed with it.        Remarkable experiences are usually confined to the inner life of       imaginative men, but Mr. Poe’s biography displays a vicissitude       and peculiarity of interest such as is rarely met with. The       offspring of a romantic marriage, and left an orphan at an early       age, he was adopted by Mr. Allan, a wealthy Virginian, whose       barren marriage-bed seemed the warranty of a large estate to the       young poet.        Having received a classical education in England, he returned       home and entered the University of Virginia, where, after an       extravagant course, followed by reformation at the last       extremity, he was graduated with the highest honors of his class.       Then came a boyish attempt to join the fortunes of the insurgent       Greeks, which ended at St. Petersburg, where he got into       difficulties through want of a passport, from which he was       rescued by the American consul and sent home. He now entered the       military academy at West Point, from which he obtained a       dismissal on hearing of the birth of a son to his adopted father,       by a second marriage, an event which cut off his expectations as       an heir. The death of Mr. Allan, in whose will his name was not       mentioned, soon after relieved him of all doubt in this regard,       and he committed himself at once to authorship for a support.       Previously to this, however, he had published (in 1827) a small       volume of poems, which soon ran through three editions, and       excited high expectations of its author’s future distinction in       the minds of many competent judges.        That no certain augury can be drawn from a poet’s earliest       lispings there are instances enough to prove. Shakespeare’s first       poems, though brimful of vigor and youth and picturesqueness,       give but a very faint promise of the directness, condensation and       overflowing moral of his maturer works. Perhaps, however,       Shakespeare is hardly a case in point, his “Venus and Adonis”       having been published, we believe, in his twenty-sixth year.       Milton’s Latin verses show tenderness, a fine eye for nature, and       a delicate appreciation of classic models, but give no hint of       the author of a new style in poetry. Pope’s youthful pieces have       all the sing-song, wholly unrelieved by the glittering malignity       and eloquent irreligion of his later productions. Collins’ callow       namby-pamby died and gave no sign of the vigorous and original       genius which he afterward displayed. We have never thought that       the world lost more in the “marvellous boy,” Chatterton, than a       very ingenious imitator of obscure and antiquated dulness. Where       he becomes original (as it is called), the interest of ingenuity       ceases and he becomes stupid. Kirke White’s promises were       indorsed by the respectable name of Mr. Southey, but surely with       no authority from Apollo. They have the merit of a traditional       piety, which to our mind, if uttered at all, had been less       objectionable in the retired closet of a diary, and in the sober       raiment of prose. They do not clutch"]]]
