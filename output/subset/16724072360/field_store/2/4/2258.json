During the present year he had been very industrious.  In order that his cattle should be provided for in the season of winter he had planted a large quantity of maize and buckwheat, and now the crops of both were in the most prosperous condition.  His garden, too, smiled, and promised a profusion of fruits, and melons, and kitchen vegetables.  In short, the little homestead where he had fixed himself for a time, was a miniature oasis; and he rejoiced day after day, as his eyes rested upon the ripening aspect around him.  Once more he began to dream of prosperity-- once more to hope that his evil fortunes had come to an end.  Alas!  It was a false hope.  A series of trials yet awaited him--a series of misfortunes that deprived him of almost everything he possessed, and completely changed his mode of existence.  Perhaps these occurrences could hardly be termed _misfortunes_, since in the end they led to a happy result.  But you may judge for yourself, boy reader, after you have heard the \"history and adventures\" of the \"trek-boor\" and his family.    CHAPTER TWO.  THE \"KRAAL.\"  The ex-field-cornet was seated in front of his _kraal_--for such is the name of a South African homestead.  From his lips protruded a large pipe, with its huge bowl of _meerschaum_.  Every boor is a smoker.  Notwithstanding the many losses and crosses of his past life, there was contentment in his eye.  He was gratified by the prosperous appearance of his crops.  The maize was now \"in the milk,\" and the ears, folded within the papyrus-like husks, looked full and large.  It was delightful to hear the rustling of the long green blades, and see the bright golden tassels waving in the breeze.  The heart of the farmer was glad as his eye glanced over his promising crop of \"mealies.\"  But there was another promising crop that still more gladdened his heart--his fine children. There they are--all around him.  Hans--the oldest--steady, sober Hans, at work in the well-stocked garden; while the diminutive but sprightly imp Jan, the youngest, is looking on, and occasionally helping his brother.  Hendrik--the dashing Hendrik, with bright face and light curling hair--is busy among the horses, in the \"horse-kraal;\" and Truey--the beautiful, cherry-cheeked, flaxen-haired Truey--is engaged with her pet--a fawn of the springbok gazelle--whose bright eyes rival her own in their expression of innocence and loveliness.  Yes, the heart of the field-cornet is glad as he glances from one to the other of these his children--and with reason.  They are all fair to look upon,--all give promise of goodness.  If their father feels an occasional pang, it is, as we have already said, when his eye rests upon the cherry-cheeked, flaxen-haired Gertrude.  But time has long since subdued that grief to a gentle melancholy.  Its pang is short-lived, and the face of the field-cornet soon lightens up again as he looks around upon his dear children, so full of hope and promise.  Hans and Hendrik are already strong enough to assist him in his occupations,--in fact, with the exception of \"Swartboy,\" they are the only help he has.  Who is Swartboy?  Look into the horse-kraal, and you will there see Swartboy engaged, along with his young master Hendrik, in saddling a pair of horses.  You may notice that Swartboy appears to be about thirty years old, and he is full that; but if you were to apply a measuring rule to him, you would find him not much over four feet in height!  He is stoutly built however, and would measure better in a horizontal direction.  You may notice that he is of a yellow complexion, although his name might lead you to fancy he was black--for \"Swartboy\" means \"black-boy.\"  You may observe that his nose is flat and sunk below the level of his cheeks; that his cheeks are prominent, his lips very thick, his nostrils wide, his face beardless, and his head almost hairless--for the small kinky wool-knots thinly-scattered over his skull can scarcely be designated hair.  You may notice, moreover, that his head is monstrously large, with ears in proportion, and that the eyes are set obliquely, and have a Chinese expression.  You may notice about Swartboy all those characteristics that distinguish the \"Hottentots\" of South Africa.  Yet Swartboy is _not_ a Hottentot--though he is of the same race.  He is a _Bushman_.  How came this wild Bushman into the service of the ex-field-cornet Von Bloom?  About that there is a little romantic history.  Thus:--  Among the savage tribes of Southern Africa there exists a very cruel custom,--that of abandoning their aged or infirm, and often their sick or wounded, to die in the desert.  Children leave their parents behind them, and the wounded are often forsaken by their comrades with no other provision made for them beyond a day's food and a cup of water!  The Bushman Swartboy had been the victim of this custom.  He had been upon a hunting excursion with some of his own kindred, and had been sadly mangled by a lion.  His comrades, not expecting him to live, left him on the plain to die; and most certainly would he have perished had it not been for our field-cornet.  The latter, as he was \"trekking\" over the plains, found the wounded Bushman, lifted him into his wagon, carried him on to his camp, dressed his wounds, and nursed him till he became well.  That is how Swartboy came to be in the service of the field-cornet.  Though gratitude is not a characteristic of his race, Swartboy was not ungrateful.  When all the other servants ran away, he remained faithful to his master; and since that time had been a most efficient and useful hand.  In fact, he was now the only one left, with the exception of the girl, Totty--who was, of course, a Hottentot; and much about the same height, size, and colour, as Swartboy himself.  We have said that Swartboy and the young Hendrik were saddling a pair of horses.  As soon as they had finished that job, they mounted them, and riding out of the kraal, took their way straight across the plain.  They were followed by a couple of strong, rough-looking dogs.  Their purpose was to drive home the oxen and the other horses that were feeding a good distance off.  This they were in the habit of doing every evening at the same hour,--for in South Africa it is necessary to shut up all kinds of live-stock at night, to protect them from beasts of prey.  For this purpose are built several enclosures with high walls,--\"kraals,\" as they are called,--a word of the same signification as the Spanish \"corral,\" and I fancy introduced into Africa by the Portuguese--since it is not a native term.  These kraals are important structures about the homestead of a boor, almost as much so as his own dwelling-house, which of itself also bears the name of \"kraal.\"  As young Hendrik and Swartboy rode off for the horses and cattle, Hans, leaving his work in the garden, proceeded to collect the sheep and drive them home.  These browsed in a different direction; but, as they were near, he went afoot, taking little Jan along with him.  Truey having tied her pet to a post, had gone inside the house to help Totty in preparing the supper.  Thus the field-cornet was left to himself and his pipe, which he still continued to smoke.  He sat in perfect silence, though he could scarce restrain from giving expression to the satisfaction he felt at seeing his family thus industriously employed.  Though pleased with all his children, it must be confessed he had some little partiality for the dashing Hendrik, who bore his own name, and who reminded him more of his own youth than any of the others.  He was proud of Hendrik's gallant horsemanship, and his eyes followed him over the plain until the riders were nearly a mile off, and already mixing among the cattle.  At this moment an object came under the eyes of Von Bloom, that at once arrested his attention.  It was a curious appearance along the lower part of the sky, in the direction in which Hendrik and Swartboy had gone, but apparently beyond them.  It resembled a dun-coloured mist or smoke, as if the plain at a great distance was on fire!  Could that be so?  Had some one fired the _karoo_ bushes?  Or was it a cloud of dust?  The wind was hardly strong enough to raise such a dust, and yet it had that appearance.  Was it caused by animals?  Might it not be the dust raised by a great herd of antelopes,--a migration of the springboks, for instance?  It extended for miles along the horizon, but Von Bloom knew that these creatures often travel in flocks of greater extent than miles.  Still he could not think it was that.  He continued to gaze at the strange phenomenon, endeavouring to account for it in various ways.  It seemed to be rising higher against the blue sky--now resembling dust, now like the smoke of a widely-spread conflagration, and now like a reddish cloud.  It was in the west, and already the setting sun was obscured by it.  It had passed over the sun's disc like a screen, and his light no longer fell upon the plain. Was it the forerunner of some terrible storm?--of an earthquake?  Such a thought crossed the mind of the field-cornet.  It was not like an ordinary cloud,--it was not like a cloud of dust,--it was not like smoke.  It was like nothing he had ever witnessed before.  No wonder that he became anxious and apprehensive.  All at once the dark-red mass seemed to envelope the cattle upon the plain, and these could be seen running to and fro as if affrighted. Then the two riders disappeared under its dun shadow!  Von Bloom rose to his feet, now seriously alarmed.  What could it mean?  The exclamation to which he gave utterance brought little Truey and Totty from the house; and Hans with Jan had now got back with the sheep and goats.  All saw the singular phenomenon, but none of them could tell what it was.  All were in a state of alarm.  As they stood gazing, with hearts full of fear, the two"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21237"],["title","The Bush Boys: History and Adventures of a Cape Farmer and his Family (#2)"],["body","appeared coming out of the cloud, and then they were seen to gallop forward over the plain in the direction of the house.  They came on at full speed, but long before they had got near, the voice of Swartboy could be heard crying out,--  \"Baas Von Bloom! _da springhaans are comin_!--_da springhaan_!--_da springhaan_!\"    CHAPTER THREE.  THE \"SPRINGHAAN.\"  \"Ah! the _springhaan_!\" cried Von Bloom, recognising the Dutch name for the far-famed migratory locust.  The mystery was explained.  The singular cloud that was spreading itself over the plain was neither more nor less than a flight of locusts!  It was a sight that none of them, except Swartboy, had ever witnessed before.  His master had often seen locusts in small quantities, and of several species,--for there are many kinds of these singular insects in South Africa.  But that which now appeared was a true migratory locust (_Gryllus devastatorius_); and upon one of its great migrations--an event of rarer occurrence than travellers would have you believe.  Swartboy knew them well; and, although he announced their approach in a state of great excitement, it was not the excitement of terror.  Quite the contrary.  His great thick lips were compressed athwart his face in a grotesque expression of joy.  The instincts of his wild race were busy within him.  To them a flight of locusts is not an object of dread, but a source of rejoicing--their coming as welcome as a _take_ of shrimps to a Leigh fisherman, or harvest to the husbandman.  The dogs, too, barked and howled with joy, and frisked about as if they were going out upon a hunt.  On perceiving the cloud, their instinct enabled them easily to recognise the locusts.  They regarded them with feelings similar to those that stirred Swartboy--for both dogs and Bushmen eat the insects with avidity!  At the announcement that it was only locusts, all at once recovered from their alarm.  Little Truey and Jan laughed, clapped their hands, and waited with curiosity until they should come nearer.  All had heard enough of locusts to know that they were only grasshoppers that neither bit nor stung any one, and therefore no one was afraid of them.  Even Von Bloom himself was at first very little concerned about them. After his feelings of apprehension, the announcement that it was a flight of locusts was a relief, and for a while he did not dwell upon the nature of such a phenomenon, but only regarded it with feelings of curiosity.  Of a sudden his thoughts took a new direction.  His eye rested upon his fields of maize and buckwheat, upon his garden of melons, and fruits, and vegetables: a new alarm seized upon him; the memory of many stories which he had heard in relation to these destructive creatures rushed into his mind, and as the whole truth developed itself, he turned pale, and uttered new exclamations of alarm.  The children changed countenance as well.  They saw that their father suffered; though they knew not why.  They gathered inquiringly around him.  \"Alas! alas!  Lost! lost!\" exclaimed he; \"yes, all our crop--our labour of the year--gone, gone!  O my dear children!\"  \"How lost, father?--how gone?\" exclaimed several of them in a breath.  \"See the springhaan! they will eat up our crop--all--all!\"  \"'Tis true, indeed,\" said Hans, who being a great student had often read accounts of the devastations committed by the locusts.  The joyous countenances of all once more wore a sad expression, and it was no longer with curiosity that they gazed upon the distant cloud, that so suddenly had clouded their joy.  Von Bloom had good cause for dread.  Should the swarm come on, and settle upon his fields, farewell to his prospects of a harvest.  They would strip the verdure from his whole farm in a twinkling.  They would leave neither seed, nor leaf, nor stalk, behind them.  All stood watching the flight with painful emotions.  The swarm was still a full half-mile distant.  They appeared to be coming no nearer,-- good!  A ray of hope entered the mind of the field-cornet.  He took off his broad felt hat, and held it up to the full stretch of his arm.  The wind was blowing _from the north_, and the swarm was directly _to the west_ of the kraal.  The cloud of locusts had approached from the north, as they almost invariably do in the southern parts of Africa.  \"Yes,\" said Hendrik, who having been in their midst could tell what way they were drifting, \"they came down upon us from a northerly direction. When we headed our horses homewards, we soon galloped out from them, and they did not appear to fly after us; I am sure they were passing southwards.\"  Von Bloom entertained hopes that as none appeared due north of the kraal, the swarm might pass on without extending to the borders of his farm.  He knew that they usually followed the direction of the wind. Unless the wind changed they would not swerve from their course.  He continued to observe them anxiously.  He saw that the selvedge of the cloud came no nearer.  His hopes rose.  His countenance grew brighter. The children noticed this and were glad, but said nothing.  All stood silently watching.  An odd sight it was.  There was not only the misty swarm of the insects to gaze upon.  The air above them was filled with birds--strange birds and of many kinds.  On slow, silent wing soared the brown \"oricou,\" the largest of Africa's vultures; and along with him the yellow \"chasse fiente,\" the vulture of Kolbe.  There swept the bearded \"lamvanger,\" on broad extended wings.  There shrieked the great \"Caffre eagle,\" and side by side with him the short-tailed and singular \"bateleur.\"  There, too, were hawks of different sizes and colours, and kites cutting through the air, and crows and ravens, and many species of _insectivora_.  But far more numerous than all the rest could be seen the little _springhaan-vogel_, a speckled bird of nearly the size and form of a swallow.  Myriads of these darkened the air above--hundreds of them continually shooting down among the insects, and soaring up again, each with a victim in its beak.  \"Locust-vultures\" are these creatures named, though not vultures in kind.  They feed exclusively on these insects, and are never seen where the locusts are not.  They follow them through all their migrations, building their nests, and rearing their young, in the midst of their prey!  It was, indeed, a curious sight to look upon, that swarm of winged insects, and their numerous and varied enemies; and all stood gazing upon it with feelings of wonder.  Still the living cloud approached no nearer, and the hopes of Von Bloom continued to rise.  The swarm kept extending to the south--in fact, it now stretched along the whole western horizon; and all noticed that it was gradually getting lower down--that is, its top edge was sinking in the heavens.  Were the locusts passing off to the west?  No.  \"Da am goin' roost for da nacht--now we'll get 'em in bagfull,\" said Swartboy, with a pleased look; for Swartboy was a regular locust-eater, as fond of them as either eagle or kite,--ay, as the \"springhaan-vogel\" itself.  It was as Swartboy had stated.  The swarm was actually settling down on the plain.  \"Can't fly without sun,\" continued the Bushman.  \"Too cold now.  Dey go dead till da mornin.\"  And so it was.  The sun had set.  The cool breeze weakened the wings of the insect travellers, and they were compelled to make halt for the night upon the trees, bushes, and grass.  In a few minutes the dark mist that had hid the blue rim of the sky, was seen no more; but the distant plain looked as if a fire had swept over it.  It was thickly covered with the bodies of the insects, that gave it a blackened appearance, as far as the eye could reach.  The attendant birds, perceiving the approach of night, screamed for awhile, and then scattered away through the heavens.  Some perched upon the rocks, while others went to roost among the low thickets of mimosa; and now for a short interval both earth and air were silent.  Von Bloom now bethought him of his cattle.  Their forms were seen afar off in the midst of the locust-covered plain.  \"Let 'em feed um little while, baas,\" suggested Swartboy.  \"On what?\" inquired his master.  \"Don't you see the grass is covered!\"  \"On de springhaan demself, baas,\" replied the Bushman; \"good for fatten big ox--better dan grass--ya, better dan _mealies_.\"  But it was too late to leave the cattle longer out upon the plain.  The lions would soon be abroad--the sooner because of the locusts, for the king of the beasts does not disdain to fill his royal stomach with these insects--when he can find them.  Von Bloom saw the necessity of bringing his cattle at once to their kraal.  A third horse was saddled, which the field-cornet himself mounted, and rode off, followed by Hendrik and Swartboy.  On approaching the locusts they beheld a singular sight.  The ground was covered with these reddish-brown creatures, in some spots to the depth of several inches.  What bushes there were were clustered with them,-- all over the leaves and branches, as if swarms of bees had settled upon them.  Not a leaf or blade of grass that was not covered with their bodies!  They moved not, but remained silent, as if torpid or asleep.  The cold of the evening had deprived them of the power of flight.  What was strangest of all to the eyes of Von Bloom and Hendrik, was the conduct of their own horses and cattle.  These were some distance out in the midst of the sleeping host; but instead of being alarmed at their odd situation, they were greedily gathering up the insects in mouthfuls, and crunching them as though they had been corn!  It was with some difficulty that they could be driven off; but the roar of a lion, that was just then heard over the plain, and the repeated application of Swartboy's _jambok_, rendered them more tractable, and at length they suffered themselves to be driven home, and lodged within their kraals.  Swartboy had provided himself with a bag, which he carried"]]]
