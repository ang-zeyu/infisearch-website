I know that well.  Good-bye.\"  They shook hands again, and were soon striding over the snow to their respective homes.    CHAPTER TWO.  CONFLICTING ELEMENTS AND A CATASTROPHE.  Hoary winter passed away, and genial spring returned to rejoice the land.  In a particularly amiable frame of mind, old Ravenshaw went out one morning to smoke.  Everything had gone well that morning.  Breakfast had been punctual; appetite good; rheumatics in abeyance; the girls lively; and Miss Trim less of a torrent than was her wont.  Mrs Ravenshaw's intellect had more than once almost risen to the ordinary human average, and Master Tony had been better--perhaps it were more correct to say less wicked-- than usual.  Old Ravenshaw was what his friends styled a heavy smoker, so was his kitchen chimney; but then the chimney had the excuse of being compelled to smoke, whereas its owner's insane act was voluntary.  Be not afraid, reader.  We have no intention of entering into an argument with smokers.  They are a pigheaded generation.  We address those who have not yet become monomaniacs as regards tobacco.  In order to the full enjoyment of his pipe, the old gentleman had built on a knoll what Elsie styled a summer-house.  Regardless of seasons, however--as he was of most things--her father used this temple at all seasons of the year, and preferred to call it a smoking box.  Now, as this smoking-box, with its surroundings, had much to do with the issues of our story, we bring it under particular notice.  It resembled a large sentry-box, and the willow-clad knoll on which it stood was close to the river.  Being elevated slightly above the rest of the country, a somewhat extended view of river and plain was obtainable therefrom. Samuel Ravenshaw loved to contemplate this view through the medium of smoke.  Thus seen it was hazy and in accord with his own idea of most things.  The sun shone warmly into the smoking-box.  It sparkled on the myriad dew-drops that hung on the willows, and swept in golden glory over the rolling plains.  The old gentleman sat down, puffed, and was happy.  The narcotic influence operated, and the irascible demon in his breast fell sound asleep.  How often do bright sunshine and profound calm precede a storm?  Is not that a truism--if not a newism.  The old gentleman had barely reduced himself to quiescence, and the demon had only just begun to snore, when a cloud, no bigger than a man's body, arose on the horizon.  Gradually it drew near, partially obscured the sky, and overshadowed the smoking-box in the form of Angus Macdonald, the father of Ian.  (The demon ceased snoring!)  \"Coot tay to you, sir,\" said Angus.  \"You will pe enchoyin' your pipe this fine mornin'.\"  \"Yes, Angus, I am,\" replied Ravenshaw, with as much urbanity as he could assume--and it wasn't much, for he suspected the cause of his neighbour's visit--\"you'd better sit down and light your own.\"  Angus accepted the invitation, and proceeded to load with much deliberation.  Now it must be known that the Highlander loved the view from that knoll as much as did his neighbour.  It reminded him of the old country where he had been born and bred on a hill-top.  He coveted that willow knoll intensely, desiring to build a house on it, and, being prosperous, was willing to give for it more than its value, for his present dwelling lay somewhat awkwardly in the creek, a little higher up the river, so that the willows on the knoll interfered vexatiously with his view.  \"It's a peautiful spote this!\" observed Angus, after a few preliminary puffs.  \"It is,\" answered the old trader curtly, (and the demon awoke).  Angus made no rejoinder for a few minutes, but continued to puff great clouds with considerable emphasis from his compressed lips.  Mr Ravenshaw returned the fire with interest.  \"It'll no pe for sellin' the knowl, ye are?\" said Angus.  The demon was fairly roused now.  \"No, Angus Macdonald,\" said the trader sternly, \"I'll _not_ sell it. I've told you already more than once, and it is worse than ill-judged, it is impertinent of you to come bothering me to part with my land.\"  \"Ho! inteed!\" exclaimed Angus, rising in wrath, and cramming his pipe into his vest pocket; \"it is herself that will pe pothering you no more spout your dirty land, Samyool Ruvnshaw.\"  He strode from the spot with a look of ineffable scorn, and the air of an offended chieftain.  Old Ravenshaw tried to resume his tranquillity, but the demon was self-willed, and tobacco had lost its power.  There were more clouds, however, in store for him that morning.  It so fell out that Ian Macdonald, unable to bear the suspense of uncertainty any longer, and all ignorant of his father's visit to the old trader, had made up his mind to bring things to a point that very morning by formally asking permission to pay his addresses to Elsie Ravenshaw.  Knowing the old man's habits, he went straight to the smoking-box.  If he had set out half an hour sooner he would have met his own father and saved himself trouble.  As it was, they missed each other.  Mr Ravenshaw had only begun to feel slightly calmed when Ian presented himself, with a humble, propitiatory air.  The old man hated humility in every form, even its name.  He regarded it as a synonym for hypocrisy. The demon actually leaped within him, but the old man had a powerful will.  He seized his spiritual enemy, throttled, and held him down.  \"Good-morning, Mr Ravenshaw.\"  \"Good-morning.\"  Nothing more was said by either for a few minutes.  Ian was embarrassed. He had got up a set speech and forgotten it.  He was shy, but he was also resolute.  Drawing himself up suddenly he said, with an earnest, honest look, \"Mr Ravenshaw, I love your daughter,\" (there was only one daughter in Ian's estimation!) \"and I come to ask leave to woo her.  If, by earnest devotion and--\"  \"Ian Macdonald,\" interrupted the old gentleman, in a voice of suppressed anger, \"you may save yourself and me the trouble of more talk on this subject.  Your father has just been here wanting me to sell him this knoll.  Now, look here,\" (he rose, and stepping out of the smoking-box, pointed to Angus Macdonald's house, which was full in view), \"you see that house, young man.  Mark what I say.  I will sell this knoll to your father, and give my daughter to you, when you take that house, and with your own unaided hands place it on the top of this knoll!\"  This was meant by the old trader as a bitterly facetious way of indicating the absolute hopelessness of the case.  Ian accepted it in that light, for he was well aware that Samuel Ravenshaw's firmness--or obstinacy--was insurmountable.  He did not despair, however; true love never does that; but he felt tremendously cast down.  Without a word or look of reproach he turned and walked slowly away.  Once again the old trader sought comfort in his pipe, but found none. Besides feeling extremely indignant; with the Macdonalds, father and son, for what he styled their presumption, he was now conscious of having treated both with undue severity.  Dashing his pipe on the ground, he thrust both hands into his coat pockets, and returned towards his dwelling.  On the way he unfortunately met Petawanaquat in one of his fields, leaning composedly over a gate.  That intelligent redskin had not yet finished his inquiries at the missionary village.  He had appeared more than once at Willow Creek, and seemed to hover round the old trader like a moth round a candle.  The man was innocent of any evil intent on this occasion, but Ravenshaw would have quarrelled with an angel just then.  \"What are you doing here?  Be off!\" he said sternly.  The Indian either did not or would not understand, and the old man, seizing him by the arm, thrust him violently through the gateway.  All the hot blood of the Petawanaquats, from Adam downwards, seemed to leap through the red man's veins and concentrate in his right hand as he turned fiercely on the trader and drew his scalping-knife.  Quick as lightning Ravenshaw hit out with his fist, and knocked the Indian down, then, turning on his heel, walked away.  For a moment Petawanaquat lay stunned.  Recovering, he arose, and his dark glittering eyes told of a purpose of deadly revenge.  The trader was still in sight.  The Indian picked up his gun, glided swiftly behind a tree, and took a long steady aim.  Just then little Tony rushed from the house and leaped into his father's arms, where he received an unusually warm embrace, for the trader wanted some sort of relief for his feelings.  The Indian's finger was pressing the trigger at the moment.  Death was very near Samuel Ravenshaw just then, but the finger relaxed and the gun was lowered.  A more terrible form of revenge had flashed into the mind of the savage.  Gliding quietly from his position, he entered the willows and disappeared.  Meanwhile Angus Macdonald returned in no very amiable mood to his own house.  It was a small house; had been built by its owner, and was, like most of the other houses of the colony at that time, a good solid log structure--a sort of Noah's ark on a small scale.  It stood on a flat piece of mother earth, without any special foundation except a massive oblong wooden frame to which all the superstructure was attached.  You might, if strong enough, have grasped it by the ridge-pole and carried it bodily away without tearing up any foundation or deranging the fabric.  It was kept in order and managed by an elderly sister of Angus, named Martha, for Angus was a widower.  His only son Ian dwelt in the school-house, a mile farther up the river."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21698"],["title","Rivers of Ice (#1)"],["body","step, of which he had been warned, but which he had totally forgotten; then a softer, but much heavier blow, was heard, accompanied by a savage growl--that was the seaman's nose and forehead against old Mrs Roby's portal.  At this, Gillie's expectations were realised, and his joy consummated. With mischievous glee sparkling in his eyes, he hastened down to the Court to exhibit his sixpence to his mother, and to announce to all whom it might concern, that \"the sea-capp'n had run his jib-boom slap through the old 'ooman's cabin-door.\"    CHAPTER TWO.  THE SEAMAN TAKES THE \"CABIN\" BY SURPRISE AND STORM.  Without having done precisely what Gillie had asserted of him, our seaman had in truth made his way into the presence of the little old woman who inhabited \"the cabin,\" and stood there gazing round him as if lost in wonder; and well he might be, for the woman and cabin, besides being extremely old, were exceedingly curious, quaint, and small.  The former was wrinkled to such an extent, that you could not have found a patch of smooth skin large enough for a pea to rest on.  Her teeth were all gone, back and front, and her nose, which was straight and well-formed, made almost successful attempts to meet a chin which had once been dimpled, but was now turned up.  The mouth between them wore a benignant and a slightly humorous expression; the eyes, which were bright, black, and twinkling, seemed to have defied the ravages of time. Her body was much bent as she sat in her chair, and a pair of crutches leaning against the chimney-piece suggested the idea that it would not be much straighter if she stood up.  She was wrapped in a large, warm shawl, and wore a high cap, which fitted so close round her little visage, that hair, if any, was undistinguishable.  The room in which she sat resembled the cabin of a ship in more respects than one.  It was particularly low in the root so low that the seaman's hair touched it as he stood there looking round him; and across this roof ran a great beam, from which hung a variety of curious ornaments, such as a Chinese lantern, a Turkish scimitar, a New Zealand club, an Eastern shield, and the model of a full-rigged ship.  Elsewhere on the walls were, an ornamented dagger, a worsted-work sampler, a framed sheet of the flags of all nations, a sou'-wester cap and oiled coat, a telescope, and a small staring portrait of a sea-captain in his \"go-to-meeting\" clothes, which looked very much out of keeping with his staring sunburnt face, and were a bad fit.  It might have been a good likeness, and was certainly the work of one who might have raised himself to the rank of a Royal Academician if he had possessed sufficient talent and who might have painted well if he had understood the principles of drawing and colour.  The windows of the apartment, of which there were two very small square ones, looked out upon the river, and, to some extent overhung it, so that a man of sanguine temperament might have enjoyed fishing from them, if he could have been content to catch live rats and dead cats.  The prospect from these windows was, however, the best of them, being a wide reach of the noble river, crowded with its stately craft, and cut up by its ever-bustling steamers.  But the most noteworthy part of this room, or \"cabin,\" was the space between the two windows immediately over the chimney-piece, which the eccentric old woman had covered with a large, and, in some cases, inappropriate assortment of objects, by way of ornament, each article being cleaned and polished to the highest possible condition of which it was susceptible.  A group of five photographs of children--three girls and two boys, looking amazed-- formed the centrepiece of the design; around these were five other photographs of three young ladies and two young gentlemen, looking conscious, but pleased.  The spaces between these, and every available space around them, were occupied by pot-lids of various sizes, old and battered, but shining like little suns; small looking-glasses, also of various sizes, some square and others round; little strings of beads; heads of meerschaums that had been much used in former days; pin-cushions, shell-baskets, one or two horse-shoes, and iron-heels of boots; several flat irons belonging to doll's houses, with a couple of dolls, much the worse for wear, mounting guard over them; besides a host of other nick-nacks, for which it were impossible to find names or imagine uses.  Everything--from the old woman's cap to the uncarpeted floor, and the little grate in which a little fire was making feeble efforts to warm a little tea-kettle with a defiant spout--was scrupulously neat, and fresh, and clean, very much the reverse of what one might have expected to find in connection with a poverty-stricken population, a dirty lane, a filthy court, a rickety stair, and a dark passage.  Possibly the cause might have been found in a large and much-worn family Bible, which lay on a small table in company with a pair of tortoiseshell spectacles, at the old woman's elbow.  On this scene the nautical man stood gazing, as we have said, with much interest; but he was too polite to gaze long.  \"Your servant, missis,\" he said with a somewhat clumsy bow.  \"Good morning, sir,\" said the little old woman, returning the bow with the air of one who had once seen better society than that of Grubb's Court.  \"Your name is Roby, I believe,\" continued the seaman, advancing, and looking so large in comparison with the little room that he seemed almost to fill it.  The little old woman admitted that that was her name.  \"My name,\" said the seaman, \"is Wopper, tho' I'm oftener called Skipper, also Capp'n, by those who know me.\"  Mrs Roby pointed to a chair and begged Captain Wopper to sit down, which he did after bestowing a somewhat pointed glance at the chair, as if to make sure that it could bear him.  \"You was a nuss once, I'm told,\" continued the seaman, looking steadily at Mrs Roby as he sat down.  \"I was,\" answered the old woman, glancing at the photographs over the chimney-piece, \"in the same family for many years.\"  \"You'll excuse me, ma'am,\" continued the seaman, \"if I appear something inquisitive, I want to make sure that I've boarded the right craft d'ee see--I mean, that you are the right 'ooman.\"  A look of surprise, not unmingled with humour, beamed from Mrs Roby's twinkling black eyes as she gazed steadily in the seaman's face, but she made no other acknowledgment of his speech than a slight inclination of her head, which caused her tall cap to quiver.  Captain Wopper, regarding this as a favourable sign, went on.  \"You was once, ma'am, I'm told, before bein' a nuss in the family of which you've made mention, a matron, or somethin' o' that sort, in a foundlin' hospital--in your young days, ma'am?\"  Again Mrs Roby admitted the charge, and demanded to know, \"what then?\"  \"Ah, jus' so--that's what I'm comin' to,\" said Captain Wopper, drawing his large hand over his beard.  \"You was present in that hospital, ma'am, was you not, one dark November morning, when a porter-cask was left at the door by some person unknown, who cut his cable and cleared off before the door was opened,--which cask, havin' on its head two X's, and bein' labelled, `This side up, with care,' contained two healthy little babby boys?\"  Mrs Roby, becoming suddenly grave and interested, again said, \"I was.\"  \"Jus' so,\" continued the captain, \"you seem to be the right craft--'ooman, I mean--that I'm in search of.  These two boys, who were supposed to be brothers, because of their each havin' a brown mole of exactly the same size and shape on their left arms, just below their elbows, were named `Stout,' after the thing in which they was headed up, the one bein' christened James, the other Willum?\"  \"Yes, yes,\" replied the little old woman eagerly, \"and a sweet lovely pair they was when the head of that barrel was took off, lookin' out of the straw in which they was packed like two little cheruphims, though they did smell strong of the double X, and was a little elevated because of the fumes that 'ung about the wood.  But how do you come to know all this, sir, and why do you ask?\"  \"Excuse me, ma'am,\" replied the sailor with a smile, which curled up his huge moustache expressively,--\"you shall know presently, but I must make quite sure that I'm aboard of--that is to say, that you _are_ the right 'ooman.  May I ask, ma'am, what became of these two cheruphims, as you've very properly named 'em?\"  \"Certainly,\" answered Mrs Roby, \"the elder boy--we considered him the elder, because he was the first took out of the barrel--was a stoodious lad, and clever.  He got into a railway company, I believe, and became a rich man--married a lady, I'm told,--and changed his name to Stoutley, so 'tis said, not thinkin' his right name suitable to his circumstances, which, to say truth, it wasn't, because he was very thin.  I've heard it said that his family was extravagant, and that he went to California to seek his brother, and look after some property, and died there, but I'm not rightly sure, for he was a close boy, and latterly I lost all knowledge of him and his family.\"  \"And the other cheruphim, Willum,\" said the sailor, \"what of him?\"  \"Ah!\" exclaimed Mrs Roby, a flush suffusing her wrinkled countenance, while her black eyes twinkled more than usual, \"he was a jewel, _he_ was.  They said in the hospital that he was a wild good-for-nothing boy, but _I_ never thought him so.  He was always fond of me--very fond of me, and I of him.  It is true he could never settle to anythink, and at last ran away to sea, when about twelve year old; but he didn't remain long at that either, for when he got to California, he left his ship, and was not heard of for a long time after that.  I thought he was dead or drowned, but at last I got a letter from him, enclosing money, an' saying he had been up at the noo gold-diggings, an' had been lucky, dear boy, and he wanted to share his "]]]
