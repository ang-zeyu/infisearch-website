But he had seen something else that took his fancy. When Fatty's paw scooped into the water Timothy Turtle just _had_ to grab it.  \"Let me go!\" Fatty Coon shrieked, for Mr. Turtle's cruel jaws hurt him terribly.  \"Why, this is fun!\" Timothy Turtle muttered thickly, as he took a firmer hold on Fatty's paw. \"Besides, I've been wanting to talk with you for a long time.\"  \"Then you'd better let me go,\" Fatty groaned, \"because you can't talk well with your mouth full.\"  \"I can say all I need to,\" Timothy Turtle grunted. \"And I know that if I dropped your paw you'd run off.\"  \"Hurry, then!\" Fatty Coon begged him piteously. \"Hurry and tell me what you have to say. And please talk fast!\"  Timothy Turtle almost smiled.  \"Am I hurting you?\" he inquired.  \"Yes, you are!\" cried Fatty Coon.  \"Good!\" Mr. Turtle snorted. \"I meant to, because I've a grudge against you.\"  Fatty Coon couldn't think what he meant.  \"I've never done a thing to you,\" he declared.  \"Perhaps not!\" Timothy Turtle admitted.  \"But you stole Mrs. Turtle's eggs--twenty-seven of them--and you can't deny it.\"  Now, it was true--what Timothy Turtle said. Hidden among the reeds one day, Fatty Coon had watched Mrs. Turtle bury her eggs in the sand, to hatch. And when she had gone he had crept out from his hiding-place, dug up her precious, round, white treasures, and eaten them, every one.  Well, Fatty Coon dropped his head in front of Mr. Turtle. He was somewhat ashamed, and frightened, too. And he did not like to look into Timothy Turtle's blinking eyes. \"How did you know?\" he asked Mr. Turtle.  \"Mrs. Turtle told me,\" said Timothy, shifting his hold slightly, for a better one.  \"How did the old lady know who took her eggs?\" Fatty persisted.  \"Mr. Crow saw everything that happened--and don't you call my wife an old lady!\" Timothy Turtle spluttered.  \"Very well! She's a _young_ one, of course,\" Fatty said hastily. \"But I don't know how I've harmed you.\"  \"You don't, eh?\" Timothy Turtle snarled. \"Then I'll explain. I meant to have those eggs myself, young man!\"     IV  A TIGHT SQUEEZE   Timothy Turtle's remark was most surprising. It almost took Fatty Coon's breath away. And for a moment or two he even forgot the pain in his paw.  \"Do you mean to say,\" he asked, \"that you like turtles' eggs!\"  \"Do I?\" said Timothy. \"There's no better treat, in my opinion, than a tender young egg, especially if it's well mixed with sand. And, of course, twenty-seven of them are twenty-seven times as good.\"  \"I'm sorry----\" Fatty told him--\"I'm sorry that I ever touched the old--I mean the _young_--lady's eggs. And now that you've almost bitten my paw in two, please--good Mr. Turtle--let me go!\"  But good Mr. Turtle had no notion of freeing his prisoner.  \"Not yet!\" he snapped. \"I'm going to bite you twenty-seven times as long, and twenty-seven times as hard--if I can.\"  \"But it was only a mistake!\" Fatty Coon moaned. \"I never knew you wanted those eggs yourself.\"  \"Take care----\" said Timothy Turtle sternly--\"take care that you never make such a mistake again.\"  \"Don't do that!\" Fatty Coon suddenly cried.  \"Don't do _what_?\" was Mr. Turtle's testy reply.  \"Don't pull on my leg!\" Fatty Coon pleaded. \"You'll have me in the water in another moment, and I'll get wet, and my mother won't like it a bit.\"  But Timothy Turtle paid no heed to Fatty Coon's objections.  \"Certainly I'll pull you into the creek,\" he declared. \"I'm going to take you out where the water's deep, and drag you down, down, down to the very bottom. We'll have lots of fun burying ourselves in the mud. And I venture to say that you'll like it so well down there that you'll never want to come up again.\"  If Fatty Coon was frightened before, now he was terrified almost out of his wits. And he began to claw frantically at Timothy Turtle's head.  Luckily he had three free paws. And of these he made good use. In the shallows near the bank he struggled with all his might and main. And soon the water was churned into a muddy pool.  [Illustration: \"Let Me In!\" said Timothy to Mr. Frog.]  Fatty never knew exactly how he succeeded in breaking loose from Mr. Turtle. Anyhow, he found himself free at last; and he lost no time in scrambling up the bank to safety.  Afterward Timothy Turtle always complained that Fatty Coon didn't \"fight fair.\"  \"He gouges,\" Timothy would explain. \"He'd just as soon stick one of his claws into your eye as not. And I claim that's something no real gentleman will do.\"  Now, Fatty did not leave Black Creek at once, after his adventure with Timothy Turtle. He paused for a time, to squat on the bank and nurse his injured paw.  While he lingered there he happened to glance up. And whom should he see, sitting motionless in a tree near-by, but that old rascal, Mr. Crow!  \"Oh! Naughty, naughty!\" Mr. Crow cawed in a mocking voice. \"You've been fighting.\"  \"It's all your fault,\" Fatty growled. \"If you'd minded your own affairs Timothy Turtle would never have known anything about those eggs.\"  \"Bless your heart!\" old Mr. Crow cried. \"Timothy Turtle would have seized you just the same, if you'd never touched his wife's eggs. You don't know him as well as I do.\"  \"Perhaps not!\" Fatty Coon replied. \"And what's more, I don't want to. I never want to see Timothy Turtle again.\"  Old Mr. Crow laughed merrily at that speech. But Fatty Coon only turned his back on him.  _He_ was in no mood for laughter.     V  MR. TURTLE'S MISTAKE   Mr. Crow was in no hurry to leave Black Creek. And after Fatty Coon had limped away the old gentleman still sat in the tree which hung over the water. He hoped that Timothy Turtle would crawl out upon the bank and growl about Fatty.  The old black rascal was not disappointed. Fatty Coon had not been gone long when Timothy Turtle dragged himself out of the creek and stretched himself upon the sand in the warm sunshine.  \"How's your eye?\" Mr. Crow asked him hoarsely.  \"It's feeling better; but it's a wonder that I can see with it at all,\" Timothy Turtle grumbled. \"If I ever get hold of that fat young fellow again I'll pull him under the water before he knows what's happened to him. He doesn't fight _fair_.\"  Old Mr. Crow chuckled.  \"You'll never have another chance to show him the right way,\" he remarked. \"He won't come near this creek, or my name's not--ahem--Mr. Crow.\"  \"What's your first name?\" Timothy Turtle inquired, as he stared unpleasantly at the speaker.  \"Never mind!\" said the other. \"Mr. Crow will do, if you want to attract my attention.\"  Timothy Turtle frowned.  \"I don't want to,\" he retorted. \"The fact is, I'd rather be alone. I don't care to have strangers peeping down at me when I'm enjoying a sun-bath.\"  \"But I like to look at you,\" old Mr. Crow assured him solemnly. \"You make me think of somebody I've known for a good many years.\"  \"Ah! An old friend!\" Timothy exclaimed.  \"Well--not a _friend_, exactly,\" Mr. Crow explained. \"He lives in the South, where I spend the winters. You look like him, in many ways.\"  \"And his name?\" Timothy Turtle said.  \"Mr. Alligator!\"  Timothy Turtle grunted.  \"Humph!\" he said. \"I've never heard of him.\"  \"That's not strange,\" old Mr. Crow told him. \"He stays all the time in the South and you stay all the time in the North. You couldn't very well meet, you see.\"  \"Your tail is a good deal like his,\" Mr. Crow continued. \"And when you walk you have a trick of raising yourself sometimes on your hind legs, with your head and tail stretched out--a trick that reminds me of him.\"  For once Timothy seemed pleased.  \"Anything else?\" he demanded, with something that was almost like a smile. Unfortunately, he had passed so many years with a constant frown on his face that smiling actually hurt him.  \"Why, yes! There is something else,\" old Mr. Crow went on. \"You and he have the same way of _snapping_ at things.\"  There was no doubt, now, that Timothy Turtle was gratified.  \"He must be a fine bird--this Mr. Alligator!\" he exclaimed.  Old Mr. Crow spluttered. And he had to hang on tight to save himself from tumbling off his perch.  A bird! Timothy Turtle thought that Mr. Alligator was a bird!  The mistake was so amusing that Mr. Crow wanted to laugh. But he knew that would never do--if he wanted any more fun with Timothy Turtle.  So he pretended to cough. And he wrapped his muffler more snugly about his neck, remarking that there was a cold wind that day, even though the sun _was_ warm.     VI  MR. CROW'S KIND OFFER   \"I suppose----\" Timothy Turtle said to his young friend, old Mr. Crow--\"I suppose Mr. Alligator is a fine flier.\"  \"He's a very powerful fellow,\" old Mr. Crow replied with a sly smile.  \"Did you ever try to follow him?\" Timothy wanted to know.  Mr. Crow shook his head.  \"No!\" he answered. \"I shouldn't want to do that, because one never could tell when he might take a notion to jump into the water.\"  \"Oh! Then he can swim, can he?\"  \"Certainly!\" Mr. Crow assured him.  \"Then that's another way in which he's like me!\" Timothy Turtle cried. \"And if I could only fly, I'd be still more like him.\"  \"Why don't you learn?\" Mr. Crow suggested wickedly.  \"I'm too old,\" Timothy sighed.  \"Not at all!\" Mr. Crow hastened to assure him. \"One can never be too old to _try_ a thing.\"  But Timothy Turtle replied that even if he was young enough to attempt such a feat as flying, he hadn't the least idea of the way to go about it.  Old Mr. Crow was most helpful.  \"I'll tell you what you ought to do,\" he advised. \"You swim down the creek as far as the big bluff. And it will be a simple matter for you to climb up to the top of the bluff and jump off the rock that hangs high up over the water.\"  Timothy Turtle looked far from happy at that suggestion.  \"I shouldn't care to do that,\" he said.  \"Why not?\" Mr. Crow asked him. \"You know there's only one way of flying, and that's through the air.\"  \"I might fall,\" Timothy objected.  \"What if you did?\" said Mr. Crow glibly. \"You'd only fall into the water. And everybody agrees that you're a"]]]
