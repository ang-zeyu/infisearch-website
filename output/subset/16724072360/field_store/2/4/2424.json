I want you to split every stick of wood you can find. Then knock on the door again and I'll bring you something to eat.\"  You ought to have seen Peter Mink scowl, as he walked away to the wood-pile with the axe on his shoulder. It was a lesson to anybody, never to frown!  \"She needn't think she can make _me_ work!\" Peter said to himself. \"I'll just break her old axe--that's what I'll do!\" And he swung the axe with all his might at a stick of wood.  But the axe didn't break. And as for the stick, it fell in two pieces; for Peter had split it perfectly.  He was so out of patience that he aimed a hard blow at another stick of wood. Again, he didn't hurt the axe at all. And again he split the wood exactly as Mrs. Rabbit wanted him to. But Peter never thought of that.  Peter Mink scowled even worse than ever. And he made up his mind that he would break Mrs. Rabbit's axe if he had to use up the whole wood-pile to do it.  Well, that is just what happened. Peter tried so hard to break the axe so he wouldn't have to work, that before he knew it he had split all the wood.  He was just about to look for a rock, then--on which to break the axe--when he happened to think that there was no longer any sense in trying to do that, because the work was all done!  [Illustration: PETER SPLIT THE STICK PERFECTLY!]  So he put the axe across his shoulder and went and knocked on Mrs. Rabbit's door.  \"Bring on your food!\" he said, when Mrs. Rabbit appeared.  \"Is the axe all right?\" she asked. \"It didn't break, did it?\"  \"No, indeed!\" he said--\"though I was rather expecting it would.\"  \"Is the wood all split?\" she inquired.  \"Every stick of it!\" answered Peter.  \"Then bring it here, near the back door,\" Mrs. Rabbit told him. \"That will help pay for the saw you broke here last week.\"  \"I'll do nothing of the kind!\" said Peter Mink. And he was so angry that he went back to the wood-pile and began throwing sticks of wood at Mrs. Rabbit's house, trying to break a window. And before he knew it he had thrown the whole wood-pile in almost the exact spot where Mrs. Rabbit wanted it. And he hadn't broken a single window, either.  But Peter Mink never once realized what he had done. He went off to take a swim in the brook, and maybe catch a trout.  Later when Mrs. Rabbit saw that in spite of what Peter had said, he had moved her wood-pile for her, she wondered why he had not asked for something to eat. But Peter Mink never knocked on her door again. He kept away from Mrs. Rabbit ever afterward, because she was the only person who had ever been able to make him work.  [Illustration]     THE LECTURE   Peter Mink was going to give a lecture. He had invited everybody.  \"It's something you all ought to hear,\" he said. \"And it will cost you nothing to come. Another time,\" he explained, \"whoever hears my lecture will have to pay. But this one is free.\"  Old Mr. Crow remarked that he supposed Peter Mink was going to tell people how to catch ducks. And since he never cared anything at all about ducks, he said he didn't expect to be present.  \"I'm glad you're not coming,\" Peter Mink answered, \"because I'm afraid there won't be room for all the people who intend to hear me. As for ducks--I'd no more think of giving a lecture about ducks than I would about _crows_.\"  Old Mr. Crow pretended not to hear what Peter said. He did not care even to be seen talking with such a worthless fellow.  But there were many other people living in Pleasant Valley and on Blue Mountain who decided to go to Peter Mink's lecture--when they learned that they might get in free.  And when the night of the lecture arrived even Peter himself was surprised to see how many were present.  To be sure, Peter noticed that some of the audience were smiling; and some of them were nudging one another, as if they thought the whole thing was nothing but a joke. And when the full moon climbed over the top of Blue Mountain, and Peter Mink climbed on top of an old stump and faced the gathering, a few rude persons laughed aloud.  \"What about ducks?\" somebody called from a tree above Peter's head. Everybody tittered at that, because everybody knew that Peter was very fond of ducks and spent much of his time at Farmer Green's duck pond.  It was old Mr. Crow who asked that question. He had come to the lecture, in spite of what he had said.  \"My lecture,\" Peter Mink began, when all was quiet, \"my lecture to-night is going to be about a poor boy who has no one to take care of him. He has no home. And very often he goes about in rags. Sometimes he begs for food and clothes. I think,\" Peter said, \"we all ought to be very sorry for him.\"  As soon as Peter said that, Mrs. Squirrel and Mrs. Woodchuck took out their pocket-handkerchiefs and wiped their eyes. And Mrs. Squirrel's husband was heard to remark that it was a shame, and that he thought something ought to be done.  Well, Peter Mink went on and told them as many as twenty-three different tales about that poor boy, to show them what a hard life he led. Every tale was sadder than the one just before it. And by the time Peter had finished the twenty-third, there were very few dry eyes in the place. And Mr. Squirrel spoke up loudly and said once more that _something_ ought to be done about it.  When he said that, Uncle Jerry Chuck rose hurriedly and hobbled away from the lecture. He had sat in one of the best seats, because it was free. And he had wept quite noisily, once or twice, because it cost no more to weep and he wanted all he could get for nothing. But when Mr. Squirrel said what he did, Uncle Jerry at once thought of a _collection_. And he decided that he had better leave before it was too late.  Peter Mink saw him go. And here and there he noticed other people who looked as if they would like to leave, too. And he knew that there was no time to lose.  \"I see one gentleman leaving,\" Peter Mink said in a loud voice. \"I hope no more will go--unless, of course, they're so stingy that they wouldn't care to give a little something to help this poor boy I've been telling you about.\"  After that, nobody wanted to leave, because nobody wanted to be thought stingy.  \"I appoint Mr. Rabbit and Mr. Woodchuck to take up a _collection_ for this poor boy,\" Peter Mink said. \"And I've no doubt that they will be glad to give all they can, themselves.\"  Mr. Rabbit and Mr. Woodchuck saw that everybody was looking at them. And they at once emptied their pocket-books into their hats.  \"What's his name? What's the poor boy's name?\" a hoarse voice called. It was Mr. Crow who asked the question.  \"That,\" said Peter Mink, \"is something I do not care to tell to everybody.\"  And many people clapped their hands. They were beginning to have a better opinion of Peter Mink.  But old Mr. Crow only laughed loudly from his perch in the tree.  [Illustration]     PASSING THE HAT   After giving all they happened to have in their pocket-books, Mr. Rabbit and Mr. Woodchuck began to pass their hats to take up the collection for the poor boy that Peter Mink had been telling them about. And all the people who had come to hear Peter's lecture began to dig down into their pockets.  \"That's right!\" Peter cried. \"Give what you can! Of course, I don't expect the poor people to give as much as the rich.\"  That made everybody decide that he would give all he had with him. And many people wished they had brought more. Besides, no one wanted to be thought stingy, like Uncle Jerry Chuck, who had hurried away as soon as he suspected that there was going to be a collection.  When Mr. Rabbit and Mr. Woodchuck had passed their hats to every person present, their hats were filled to the brim. And they marched proudly up to the stump where Peter Mink still stood.  Peter jumped down to the ground.  \"Keep your seats, everybody!\" he called. \"The next thing to be done is to count this money. And I will do that myself.\" So Peter picked up the two hats and started away.  \"Where are you going?\" Mr. Rabbit asked him.  \"Just a little way into the woods,\" said Peter. \"It's so noisy here, with all this talking, that I might make a mistake.\"  \"We'll go with you and help you,\" Mr. Rabbit told him.  \"Oh, you don't need to do that,\" said Peter Mink.  But Mr. Rabbit insisted.  \"One of those hats is mine,\" he remarked. \"And wherever _it_ goes, I go, too,\" And he beckoned to Mr. Woodchuck to follow.  Well, Peter Mink didn't like that very well. You see, he had planned to go into the woods alone with the money. And nobody likes to have his plans upset. But there was nothing he could say. So they all three went into a thicket of elderberry bushes and counted the money.  \"I thought there was more,\" Peter said. \"Maybe we dropped some of the money. You and Mr. Woodchuck had better go back and see if you can find any,\" he told Mr. Rabbit.  But Mr. Rabbit said that they could just as well all go back together and search along the ground as they went.  \"All right!\" said Peter Mink. \"Well leave these hatfuls right here for a while.\"  But Mr. Rabbit said he didn't think that would be a safe thing to do. So he picked up one hatful, and told Mr. Woodchuck to carry the other.  Peter Mink didn't like that at all. But there was nothing he could say. So they all went back together to the place where the rest of the people were still waiting. And they found no more money, either.  Mr. Rabbit jumped up on the stump where Peter had stood and talked.  \"The question is,\" he said, \"who is going to take charge of all this money?\"  \"I am!\" said Peter Mink.  But Mr. Rabbit said he didn't think that would be safe.  \"You have no home, you know,\" he told Peter. \"And you can't very well carry the money about with you. I must have my hat back; and no doubt Mr. Woodchuck will want his, too.\"  Mr. Woodchuck nodded his head. He certainly did want his hat. It was the best one he had.  \"I would suggest--\" said Mr. Rabbit then--\"I would suggest that I take one hatful home "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21845"],["title","The Tale of Peter Mink (#2)"],["body","me, and that Mr. Woodchuck take the other to his house. Then we'll each have our hats; and the money will be perfectly safe.\"  \"That's a good idea!\" Peter Mink said. \"The only trouble with it is that it won't do at all. For you and Mr. Woodchuck don't know the poor boy. So how could you ever give him the money?\"  Everybody said that was so.  \"This Peter Mink is certainly a bright young fellow,\" people told one another.  Mr. Rabbit looked puzzled.  \"What do _you_ suggest, then?\" he asked Peter.  Peter Mink smiled. He seemed pleased, for one reason or another.  \"This stump,\" he said, \"is hollow. As you can all see, there's a small hole in it. We can put the money in there and nobody can get it out. It will be the same as in a bank.\"  Mr. Rabbit looked at the hole in the stump.  \"I know _I_ can't get through that hole,\" he said. \"But what about you, young fellow?\" he asked Peter.  \"Oh, I can't squeeze through such a small hole as this,\" said Peter. \"See!\" He pushed his nose part way through the hole. And there his head seemed to stick. He could have squirmed through if he had really tried. But nobody else seemed to know it.  \"But how is the poor boy ever going to get his money?\" Mr. Rabbit inquired.  \"Oh, he's very slim,\" Peter Mink said. \"_He_ can get inside the stump. Don't you worry about _him_!\"  Everybody seemed satisfied. So they dropped the money through the hole.  And then Mr. Rabbit said:  \"When are you going to bring the poor boy to get the money?\"  \"To-morrow night would be a good time,\" Peter Mink said. \"Would you all like to come here to-morrow night at this same hour?\"  And everybody said, \"Yes!\"  [Illustration]     MR. RABBIT IS WORRIED   When Mr. Rabbit reached home, after Peter Mink's lecture, and told his wife about the money that had been collected for the poor boy whom Peter Mink knew, she asked:  \"Who has the money?\"  \"Oh, it's safe,\" said Mr. Rabbit. \"It's hidden in an old stump. And the hole in the stump is so small that even Peter himself can't crawl through it.\"  \"How do you know he can't?\"  \"He tried,\" said Mr. Rabbit.  \"How do you know he tried as hard as he could?\" Mrs. Rabbit asked.  That was what made Mr. Rabbit worry. So instead of going to bed, he hurried back to the place where Peter had given his famous lecture; and there he hid himself under a small pine.  Mr. Rabbit hadn't waited long before he saw some one come out of the elderberry bushes and hurry up to the stump.  It was Peter Mink! He had a bag in his hand. And while Mr. Rabbit was watching, he squeezed through the hole in the stump. Even for Peter Mink the hole was almost too small. But he managed to squirm through, though it cost him a few groans; and he said some words that made Mr. Rabbit shake his head.  Well, as soon as Peter was inside the hole he began to push the money through it. And then what do you suppose Mr. Rabbit did? He crept up to the stump, picked up the bag, which Peter had left on the ground, and as fast as the money rolled out of the hole, Mr. Rabbit put it inside the bag.  The bag was almost full when the money stopped rolling out of the hole. And Mr. Rabbit heard Peter Mink say to himself:  \"That seems to be all!\"  And as soon as he heard that, Mr. Rabbit hurried away, with the bag of money over his shoulder.  Peter Mink waited a bit, to see if he could find more money. But he had thrown it all out. So he squeezed through the hole again. Then he turned to pick up the bag. But it had vanished.  \"That's queer!\" said Peter Mink. \"I thought I left that bag right here.\" He looked all around, but he couldn't find it anywhere. So he took off his ragged coat and laid it on the ground. \"I'll put the money in this!\" Peter said.  But when he looked for the money he couldn't find a single piece.  \"That's queer!\" said Peter. \"It must have rolled away from the stump.\" And he began to search all about. But the money, too, had vanished completely. And Peter Mink couldn't understand it.  The following night, when everybody came back again, expecting that Peter Mink would bring the poor boy with him to get the money, Peter never appeared at all.  Finally Mr. Rabbit jumped on top of the stump and told his friends what had happened the night before.  \"And now,\" he said, \"everybody can come right up here and get his money back, for there's no doubt at all that Peter Mink was collecting it for himself. _He_ was the poor boy he told us about.\"  Everybody was surprised. But everybody was glad to get his money again. In fact, there was only one person who grumbled; and that was Uncle Jerry Chuck. He hurried up to the stump ahead of all the rest, to get some money. And he seemed more surprised than ever when Mr. Rabbit said there was no money there for _him_.  \"I was at the lecture last night,\" Uncle Jerry said.  \"But you left before the money was collected,\" Mr. Rabbit replied.  Uncle Jerry admitted that that was so. But he claimed that he had made _less trouble_ for everybody, because no one had been obliged to handle the money that he hadn't given.  But Mr. Rabbit told him he ought to be ashamed of himself. And every one will say that Peter Mink ought to have been ashamed of himself, too.     PETER'S BAD TEMPER   Peter Mink was always quarreling. And he seemed always ready to fight--to fight even people who were four times bigger than he was. And when he fought, Peter usually won. But there was one person Peter Mink was afraid of; and that was Fatty Coon. Fatty was almost too big for Peter Mink to whip. And his teeth were very sharp. And his claws were like thorns.  One day Peter and Fatty had a dispute. Fatty Coon had said that a hen made the finest meal in the world. But Peter Mink spoke up at once and said it wasn't so.  \"There's nothing quite like a duck,\" he said.  Fatty Coon sneered.  \"Ducks may be all right,\" he cried. \"In fact, in my opinion they are far too good for any member of the Mink family to eat. But for me--give me a plump hen!\" And just thinking about hens made him hungry. And being hungry made him think of green corn. \"Give me a plump hen and plenty of green corn!\" And he looked all around, as if he expected somebody would hurry up to him with a hen in one hand and a dozen ears of corn in the other.  But nobody came.  \"You're a big glutton!\" Peter Mink shouted. He was very angry. But he did not dare fight Fatty Coon.  \"I guess you wish I was smaller,\" said Fatty Coon, \"so you could fight me.\"  At that, Peter Mink looked very fierce. And he turned to Frisky Squirrel and Billy Woodchuck and Jimmy Rabbit and shouted:  \"Take hold of me, quick, you fellows--before I hurt him! For I can't keep my hands off him a second longer!\"  When they heard that, Fatty's friends were frightened. They were afraid Peter Mink would fly at him and hurt him terribly. So they all seized Peter and held him fast, while they begged Fatty to run away.  Now, Fatty Coon was not the least bit afraid of Peter. But talking of good things to eat had made him so hungry that he felt he must hurry down to Farmer Green's cornfield at once. So he said \"Good-bye!\" and left them.  After Fatty had disappeared, Peter Mink said it was safe to let him go again, but that it was lucky they had held him.  And Frisky Squirrel and Billy Woodchuck and Jimmy Rabbit agreed afterwards that Peter Mink was a dangerous fellow. They were glad that Fatty Coon had escaped.  The next day, almost the same thing happened again. Only this time Peter Mink remarked that there was nothing any tastier than a fine eel. Fatty Coon told him that eels might be good enough for the Mink family, but as for him, he preferred green peas.  \"Somebody hold me, quick!\" Peter Mink screamed. \"I don't want to hurt him--but I'm losing my temper fast.\"  Several of Fatty Coon's friends started to seize Peter Mink, so Fatty might run away. But there was one person present who had not been there the day before. This was Tommy Fox. And he only laughed when Peter Mink said what he did.  \"Don't touch him!\" Tommy Fox told the others. \"Let's see what he'll do. Fatty isn't afraid of him.\"  \"Why, certainly not!\" Fatty Coon said. And he smiled in such a way that he showed his sharp teeth.  \"Somebody stop me, before it's too late!\" Peter Mink cried.  But nobody laid a hand on him. And still Peter did not move.  \"Go ahead!\" Tommy Fox urged him. \"You said you were losing your temper, you know.\"  \"I'm waiting!\" Fatty Coon called. And he held up both his front paws. Peter saw how strong and sharp his claws were.  \"I declare,\" Peter Mink said, \"I haven't lost my temper, after all. I felt it going--for a moment. But it came back again.\"     AT THE GARDEN PARTY   Peter Mink was angry with Tommy Fox; for it was he who showed everybody that Peter was afraid of Fatty Coon. Peter Mink was so angry that he went about telling everyone he met how he was going to punish Tommy Fox. \"When I finish with him,\" he said, \"he'll know enough to keep his advice to himself.\"  \"What are you going to do to him?\" Jimmy Rabbit inquired.  \"Well, I'm going to bite his nose,\" Peter explained, \"because it was his nose that he stuck in my affairs.\" And Peter went away muttering even worse things to his cousin, who was with him. His cousin's name was Slim Mink. And he was spending the summer in Farmer Green's haystack near the duck pond.  Slim had heard somewhere that there was a place called the Reform School, where boys were sent who fought too much. And he began to be afraid that if Peter did to Tommy Fox half the things he said he was going to do, some one would come along and catch Peter and send him to the Reform School.  And the Reform School was an awful place! Why, boys who went there had to sleep in beds! They had to wash their faces every morning, and brush their hair, and have table manners! It was no wonder that Slim began to worry.  \"You'd better let that young fox alone!\" he told Peter. \"You fight too much. If you don't look out, something dreadful will happen to you, some day. You'll get sent to the Reform"]]]
