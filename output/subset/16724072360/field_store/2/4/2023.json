But come Christmas Time it seems like I craves to eat with More Humans.... I got a nephew less'n twenty miles away. He's got cider in his cellar. And plum puddings. His woman she raises guinea chickens. And mince pies there is. And tasty gravies.--But me I mixes dog bread and milk--dog bread and milk--till I can't see nothing--think nothing but mush. And him with cider in his cellar!... It ain't as though Mr. Delcote ever came himself to prove anything,\" he argued. \"Not he! Not Christmas Time! It's travelling he is.... He's had ... misfortunes,\" he confided darkly. \"He travels for 'em same as some folks travels for their healths. Most especially at Christmas Time he travels for his misfortunes! He ...\"  \"_Mr. Delcote_?\" quickened Flame. \"Mr. Delcote?\" (Now at last was the mysterious tenancy about to be divulged?)  \"All he says,\" persisted the old Butler. \"All he says is 'Now Barret,'--that's me, 'Now Barret I trust your honor to see that the dogs ain't neglected just because it's Christmas. There ain't no reason, Barret', he says, 'why innocent dogs should suffer Christmas just because everybody else does. They ain't done nothing.... It won't do now Barret', he says, 'for you to give 'em their dinner at dawn when they ain't accustomed to it, and a pail of water, and shut 'em up while you go off for the day with any barrel of cider. You know what dogs is, Barret', he says. 'And what they isn't. They've got to be fed regular', he says, 'and with discipline. Else there's deaths.--Some natural. Some unnatural. And some just plain spectacular from furniture falling on their arguments. So if there's any fatalities come this Christmas Time, Barret', he says, 'or any undue gains in weight or losses in weight, I shall infer, Barret', he says, 'that you was absent without leave.' ... It don't look like a very wholesome Christmas for me,\" sighed the old Butler. \"Not either way. Not what you'd call wholesome.\"  \"But this Mr. Delcote?\" puzzled Flame. \"What a perfectly horrid man he must be to give such heavenly dogs nothing but dog-bread and milk for their Christmas dinner!... Is he young? Is he old? Is he thin? Is he fat? However in the world did he happen to come to a queer, battered old place like the Rattle-Pane House? But once come why didn't he stay? And--And--And--?\"  \"Yes'm,\" sighed the old Butler.  In a ferment of curiosity, Flame edged jerkily forward, and subsided as jerkily again.  \"Oh, if this only was a Parish Call,\" she deprecated, \"I could ask questions right out loud. 'How? Where? Why? When?' ... But being just a social call--I suppose--I suppose...?\" Appealingly her eager eyes searched the old Butler's inscrutable face.  \"Yes'm,\" repeated the old Butler dully. Through the quavering fingers that he swept suddenly across his brow two very genuine tears glistened.  With characteristic precipitousness Flame jumped to her feet.  \"Oh, darn Mr. Delcote!\" she cried. \"I'll feed your dogs, Christmas Day! It won't take a minute after my own dinner or before! I'll run like the wind! No one need ever know!\"  So it was that when Flame arrived at her own home fifteen minutes later, and found her parents madly engaged in packing suit-cases, searching time-tables, and rushing generally to and fro from attic to cellar, no very mutual exchange of confidences ensued.  \"It's your Uncle Wally!\" panted her Mother.  \"Another shock!\" confided her Father.  \"Not such a bad one, either,\" explained her Mother. \"But of course we'll have to go! The very first thing in the morning! Christmas Day, too! And leave you all alone! It's a perfect shame! But I've planned it all out for everybody! Father's Lay Reader, of course, will take the Christmas service! We'll just have to omit the Christmas Tree surprise for the children!... It's lucky we didn't even unpack the trimmings! Or tell a soul about it.\" In a hectic effort to pack both a thick coat and a thin coat and a thick dress and a thin dress and thick boots and thin boots in the same suit-case she began very palpably to pant again. \"Yes! Every detail is all planned out!\" she asserted with a breathy sort of pride. \"You and your Father are both so flighty I don't know whatever in the world you'd do if I didn't plan out everything for you!\"  With more manners than efficiency Flame and her Father dropped at once every helpful thing they were doing and sat down in rocking chairs to listen to the plan.  \"Flame, of course, can't stay here all alone. Flame's Mother turned and confided _sotto voce_ to her husband. Young men might call. The Lay Reader is almost sure to call.... He's a dear delightful soul of course, but I'm afraid he has an amorous eye.\"  \"All Lay Readers have amorous eyes,\" reflected her husband. \"Taken all in all it is a great asset.\"  \"Don't be flippant!\" admonished Flame's Mother. \"There are reasons ... why I prefer that Flame's first offer of marriage should not be from a Lay Reader.\"  \"Why?\" brightened Flame.  \"S--sh--,\" cautioned her Father.  \"Very good reasons,\" repeated her Mother. From the conglomerate packing under her hand a puff of spilled tooth-powder whiffed fragrantly into the air.  \"Yes?\" prodded her husband's blandly impatient voice.  \"Flame shall go to her Aunt Minna's\" announced the dominant maternal voice. \"By driving with us to the station, she'll have only two hours to wait for her train, and that will save one bus fare! Aunt Minna is a vegetarian and doesn't believe in sweets either, so that will be quite a unique and profitable experience for Flame to add to her general culinary education! It's a wonderful house!... A bit dark of course! But if the day should prove at all bright,--not so bright of course that Aunt Minna wouldn't be willing to have the shades up, but--Oh and Flame,\" she admonished still breathlessly, \"I think you'd better be careful to wear one of your rather longish skirts! And oh do be sure to wipe your feet every time you come in! And don't chatter! Whatever you do, don't chatter! Your Aunt Minna, you know, is just a little bit peculiar! But such a worthy woman! So methodical! So....\"  To Flame's inner vision appeared quite suddenly the pale, inscrutable face of the old Butler who asked nothing,--answered nothing,--welcomed nothing,--evaded nothing.  \"... Yes'm,\" said Flame.  But it was a very frankly disconsolate little girl who stole late that night to her Father's study, and perched herself high on the arm of his chair with her cheek snuggled close to his.  \"Of Father-Funny,\" whispered Flame, \"I've got such a queer little pain.\"  \"A pain?\" jerked her Father. \"Oh dear me! Where is it? Go and find your Mother at once!\"  \"Mother?\" frowned Flame. \"Oh it isn't that kind of a pain.--It's in my Christmas. I've got such a sad little pain in my Christmas.\"  \"Oh dear me--dear me!\" sighed her Father. Like two people most precipitously smitten with shyness they sat for a moment staring blankly around the room at every conceivable object except each other. Then quite suddenly they looked back at each other and smiled.  \"Father,\" said Flame. \"You're not of course a very old man.... But still you are pretty old, aren't you? You've seen a whole lot of Christmasses, I mean?\"  \"Yes,\" conceded her Father.  From the great clumsy rolling collar of her blanket wrapper Flame's little face loomed suddenly very pink and earnest.  \"But Father,\" urged Flame. \"Did you ever in your whole life spend a Christmas just exactly the way you wanted to? Honest-to-Santa Claus now,--did you _ever_?\"  \"Why--Why, no,\" admitted her Father after a second's hesitation. \"Why no, I don't believe I ever did.\" Quite frankly between his brows there puckered a very black frown. \"Now take to-morrow, for instance,\" he complained. \"I had planned to go fishing through the ice.... After the morning service, of course,--after we'd had our Christmas dinner,--and gotten tired of our presents,--every intention in the world I had of going fishing through the ice.... And now your Uncle Wally has to go and have a shock! I don't believe it was necessary. He should have taken extra precautions. The least that delicate relatives can do is to take extra precautions at holiday time.... Oh, of course your Uncle Wally has books in his library,\" he brightened, \"very interesting old books that wouldn't be perfectly seemly for a minister of the Gospel to have in his own library.... But still it's very disappointing,\" he wilted again.  \"I agree with you ... utterly, Father-Funny!\" said Flame. \"But ... Father,\" she persisted, \"Of all the people you know in the world,--millions would it be?\"  \"No, call it thousands\" corrected her Father.  \"Well, thousands,\" accepted Flame. \"Old people, young people, fat people, skinnys, cross people, jolly people?... Did you ever in your life know _any one_ who had ever spent Christmas just the way he wanted to?\"  \"Why ... no, I don't know that I ever did,\" considered her Father. With his elbows on the arms of his chair, his slender fingers forked to a lovely Gothic arch above the bridge of his nose, he yielded himself instantly to the reflection. \"Why ... no, ... I don't know that I ever did,\" he repeated with an increasing air of conviction.... \"When you're young enough to enjoy the day as a 'holler' day there's usually some blighting person who prefers to have it observed as a holy day.... And by the time you reach an age where you really rather appreciate its being a holy day the chances are that you've got a houseful of racketty youngsters who fairly insist on reverting to the 'holler' day idea again.\"  \"U--m--m,\" encouraged Flame.  --\"When you're little, of course,\" mused her Father, \"you have to spend the day the way your elders want you to!... You crave a Christmas Tree but they prefer stockings! You yearn to skate but they consider the weather better for corn-popping! You ask for a bicycle but they had already found a very nice bargain in flannels!

Khaki, everywhere khaki; lifebelts, rain and storm, everything soaked. Destroyers, churning through the waves, played strange games all round us. Some old-time Tommies, taking everything for granted, smoked and laughed and told funny stories. Others had the look of dumb animals in pain, going to what they knew only too well. The new hands for France asked many questions, pretended to laugh, pretended not to care, but for the most part were in terror of the unknown.  It was strange to watch this huddled heap of humanity, study their faces and realise that perhaps half of them would meet a bloody end before a new moon was over, and wonder how they could do it, why they did it--Patriotism? Yes, and perhaps it was the chance of getting home again when the war was over. Think of the life they would have! The old song:--    \"We don't want to lose you,   But we think you ought to go,   For your King and your Country   Both need you so.    \"We shall-want you and miss you,                                    (p. 012)   But with all our might and main   We shall cheer you, thank you, kiss you,   When you come back again.\"  Did they think of that, and all the joys it seemed to promise them? I pray not.  What a change had come over the world for me since the day before! On that evening I had dined with friends who had laughed and talked small scandal about their friends. One, also, was rather upset because he had an appointment at 10.30 the next day--and there was I, a few hours later, being tossed about and soaked in company with men who knew they would run a big chance of never seeing England again, and were certainly going to suffer terrible hardships from cold, filth, discomfort and fatigue. There they stood, sat and lay--a mass of humanity which would be shortly bundled off the boat at Boulogne like so many animals, to wait in the rain, perhaps for hours, before being sent off again to whatever spot the unknown at G.H.Q. had allotted for them, to kill or to be killed; and there was I among them, going quietly to G.H.Q., everything arranged by the War Office, all in comfort. Yet my stomach was twitching about with nerves. What would I have been like had I been one of them?  At Boulogne we lunched at the \"Mony\" (my companion, Aikman, had been to France before during the war and knew a few things). It was an excellent lunch, and, as we were not to report at G.H.Q. till the next day, we walked about looking at lorries and trains, all going off to the unknown, filled with humanity in khaki weighed down with their packs.  [Illustration: II. _The Bapaume Road._]  The following morning at breakfast at the \"Folkestone Hotel\" we sat   (p. 013) at the next table to a Major with red tabs. He did not speak to us, but after breakfast he said: \"Is your name Orpen?\" \"Yes, sir,\" said I. \"Have you got your car ready?\" \"Yes, sir,\" said I. \"Well, you had better drive back with me. Pack all your things in your car.\" \"Yes, sir,\" said I. He explained to me that he had come to Boulogne to fetch General Smuts' luggage, otherwise he gave us no idea of who or what he was, and off we drove to the C.-in-C.'s house, where he went in with the General's luggage and left us in the car for about an hour. Then we went on to Hesdin, where he reported us to the Town Major, who said he had found billets for us. The Red Tab Major departed, as he said he was only just in time for his lunch, and told us to come to Rollencourt soon and report to the Colonel. The Town Major brought us round to our billet--the most filthy, disgusting house in all Hesdin, and the owner, an old woman, cursed us soundly, hating the idea of people being billeted with her. Anyway, there he left us and went off to his \"Mess.\"  This was all very depressing, so we talked together and went on a voyage of discovery and found an hotel; then we went back to the billet and said \"good-bye\" to Madame and moved our stuff there. But the hotel wasn't a dream--at least we had no chance of dreaming--bugs, lice and all sorts of little things were active all night. I had been told by the War Office to go slow and not try to hustle people, so we decided we would not go and report to the Colonel till the next day after lunch.  Looking into the yard from my window in the afternoon, I saw two men I knew, one an artist from Chelsea, the other a Dublin man, who     (p. 014) used to play lawn tennis. They were \"Graves.\" My Dublin friend was \"Adjutant, Graves,\" in fact he proudly told me that \"Adjutant, Graves, B.E.F., France,\" would always find him. We dined with them that night at H.Q. Graves. They were very friendly, and said we could travel all over the back of the line by going from one \"Graves\" to another \"Graves.\" All good chaps, I'm sure, and cheerful, but we did not do it.  The next day after lunch we drove to Rollencourt, and found the Major in his office (a hut on the lawn in front of the château). He left, and returned to say the Colonel could not see us then. Would we come back at 5 p.m.? So off we went and sat by the side of the road for two hours. Then again to the Major's at 5 p.m., when he informed us the Colonel had gone out. Would we come back at 7 p.m.? (No tea offered.) This we did and waited until 7.50, when the Major informed us that the Colonel would not see us that evening, but we were to report the next morning at 9 a.m. (No dinner offered.) We left thinking very hard--things did not seem so simple after all. We reported at 9 a.m. and waited, and got a message at 11 a.m. that the Colonel would see us, and we were shown in to a wizened, sour-faced little man, his breast ablaze with strange colours. I explained to him that I did not like the billets at Hesdin, that Hesdin was too far away from anything near the front, and that I intended to go to Amiens at once. To my surprise he did not seem to object, and just as we were leaving, he said: \"By the way, General Charteris wants you to go and see him this morning. You had better go at once.\" So that was it! If General Charteris had not sent that message I might not have been admitted to the presence of the Colonel for weeks. Off we went, full of hope,     (p. 015) packed our bags and on to G.H.Q. proper, and got in to see the General at once--a bluff, jovial fellow who said: \"You go anywhere you like, do anything you like, but don't ask me to get any Generals to sit to you; they're fed up with artists.\" I said: \"That's the last thing I want.\" \"Right,\" said he, \"off you go.\" So we \"offed\" it to Amiens, arriving there about 7 p.m. on a cold, black, wet night. We went to see the Allied Press \"Major,\" to find out some place to stop in, etc. Again we were rather depressed. The meeting was very chilly, the importance of the Major was great--the full weight and responsibility of the war seemed on him. \"The Importance of being Ernest\" wasn't in it with him. As I learnt afterwards, when he came in late for a meal all the other officers and Allied Press correspondents stood up. Many a time I got a black look for not doing so. However, he advised the worst and most expensive hotel in the town, and off we went (no dinner offered), rather depressed and sad.  [Illustration: III. _Men resting. La Boisselle._]     CHAPTER II                                                            (p. 016)  THE SOMME (APRIL 1917)   Amiens was the one big town that could be reached easily from the Somme front for dinner, so every night it was crowded with officers and men who had come back in cars, motor-bikes, lorries or any old thing in or on which they could get a lift. After dinner they would stand near the station and hail anything passing, till they found something that would drop them near their destination. As there was an endless stream of traffic going out over the Albert and Péronne Roads during that time (April 1917), it was easy.  Amiens is a dirty old town with its seven canals. The cathedral, belfry and the theatre are, of course, wonderful, but there is little else except the dirt.  I remember later lunching with John Sargent in Amiens, after which I asked him if he would like to see the front of the theatre. He said he would. When we were looking at it he said: \"Yes, I suppose it is one of the most perfect things in Europe. I've had a photograph of it hanging over my bed for the last thirty years.\"  But Amiens was a danger trap for the young officer from the line, also for the men. \"Charlie's Bar\" was always full of officers; mirth ran high, also the bills for drinks--and the drink the Tommies got in the little cafés was terrible stuff, and often doped.  Then, when darkness came on, strange women--the riff-raff from        (p. 017) Paris, the expelled from Rouen, in fact the badly diseased from all parts of France--hovered about in the blackness with their electric torches, and led the unknowing away to blackened side-streets and up dim stairways--to what? Anyway, for an hour or so they were out of the rain and mud, but afterwards? Often did I go with Freddie Fane, the A.P.M., to these dens of filth to drag fine men away from disease.  [Illustration: IV. _A Tank. Pozières._]  The wise ones dined well--if not too well--at the \"Godbert,\" with its Madeleine, or the \"Cathedral,\" with its Marguerite, who was the queen of the British Army in Picardy, or, not so expensively, at the \"Hôtel de la Paix.\" Some months later the club started, a well-run place. I remember a Major who used to have his bath there once a week at 4 p.m. It was prepared for him, with a large whisky-and-soda by its side. What more comfort could one wish? Then there were dinners at the Allied Press, after which the Major would give a discourse amid heavy silence; then music. The favourite song at that time was:--    \"Jackie Boy!   Master?   Singie well?   Very well.   Hey down,   Ho down,   Derry, Derry down,   All among the leaves so green, O.    \"With my Hey down, down,   With my "]]]
