And though grim as hell the worst is, can you round it off with curses?     Then hearken to the Wild -- it's wanting you.     Have you suffered, starved and triumphed,      groveled down, yet grasped at glory,     Grown bigger in the bigness of the whole?    \"Done things\" just for the doing, letting babblers tell the story,     Seeing through the nice veneer the naked soul?    Have you seen God in His splendors, heard the text that nature renders?     (You'll never hear it in the family pew.)    The simple things, the true things, the silent men who do things --     Then listen to the Wild -- it's calling you.     They have cradled you in custom, they have primed you with their preaching,     They have soaked you in convention through and through;    They have put you in a showcase; you're a credit to their teaching --     But can't you hear the Wild? -- it's calling you.    Let us probe the silent places, let us seek what luck betide us;     Let us journey to a lonely land I know.    There's a whisper on the night-wind, there's a star agleam to guide us,     And the Wild is calling, calling... let us go.     The Lone Trail            _Ye who know the Lone Trail fain would follow it,         Though it lead to glory or the darkness of the pit.         Ye who take the Lone Trail, bid your love good-by;         The Lone Trail, the Lone Trail follow till you die._     The trails of the world be countless, and most of the trails be tried;    You tread on the heels of the many, till you come where the ways divide;    And one lies safe in the sunlight, and the other is dreary and wan,    Yet you look aslant at the Lone Trail, and the Lone Trail lures you on.    And somehow you're sick of the highway, with its noise and its easy needs,    And you seek the risk of the by-way, and you reck not where it leads.    And sometimes it leads to the desert, and the tongue swells out of the mouth,    And you stagger blind to the mirage, to die in the mocking drouth.    And sometimes it leads to the mountain, to the light of the lone camp-fire,    And you gnaw your belt in the anguish of hunger-goaded desire.    And sometimes it leads to the Southland, to the swamp where the orchid glows,    And you rave to your grave with the fever,      and they rob the corpse for its clothes.    And sometimes it leads to the Northland, and the scurvy softens your bones,    And your flesh dints in like putty, and you spit out your teeth like stones.    And sometimes it leads to a coral reef in the wash of a weedy sea,    And you sit and stare at the empty glare where the gulls wait greedily.    And sometimes it leads to an Arctic trail,      and the snows where your torn feet freeze,    And you whittle away the useless clay, and crawl on your hands and knees.    Often it leads to the dead-pit; always it leads to pain;    By the bones of your brothers ye know it, but oh, to follow you're fain.    By your bones they will follow behind you,      till the ways of the world are made plain.          _Bid good-by to sweetheart, bid good-by to friend;         The Lone Trail, the Lone Trail follow to the end.         Tarry not, and fear not, chosen of the true;         Lover of the Lone Trail, the Lone Trail waits for you._     The Pines       We sleep in the sleep of ages, the bleak, barbarian pines;    The gray moss drapes us like sages, and closer we lock our lines,    And deeper we clutch through the gelid gloom where never a sunbeam shines.     On the flanks of the storm-gored ridges are our black battalions massed;    We surge in a host to the sullen coast, and we sing in the ocean blast;    From empire of sea to empire of snow we grip our empire fast.     To the niggard lands were we driven, 'twixt desert and floes are we penned;    To us was the Northland given, ours to stronghold and defend;    Ours till the world be riven in the crash of the utter end;     Ours from the bleak beginning, through the aeons of death-like sleep;    Ours from the shock when the naked rock was hurled from the hissing deep;    Ours through the twilight ages of weary glacier creep.     Wind of the East, Wind of the West, wandering to and fro,    Chant your songs in our topmost boughs, that the sons of men may know    The peerless pine was the first to come, and the pine will be last to go!     We pillar the halls of perfumed gloom; we plume where the eagles soar;    The North-wind swoops from the brooding Pole,      and our ancients crash and roar;    But where one falls from the crumbling walls shoots up a hardy score.     We spring from the gloom of the canyon's womb; in the valley's lap we lie;    From the white foam-fringe, where the breakers cringe      to the peaks that tusk the sky,    We climb, and we peer in the crag-locked mere that gleams like a golden eye.     Gain to the verge of the hog-back ridge where the vision ranges free:    Pines and pines and the shadow of pines as far as the eye can see;    A steadfast legion of stalwart knights in dominant empery.     Sun, moon and stars give answer; shall we not staunchly stand,    Even as now, forever, wards of the wilder strand,    Sentinels of the stillness, lords of the last, lone land?     The Lure of Little Voices       There's a cry from out the loneliness -- oh, listen, Honey, listen!     Do you hear it, do you fear it, you're a-holding of me so?    You're a-sobbing in your sleep, dear, and your lashes, how they glisten --     Do you hear the Little Voices all a-begging me to go?     All a-begging me to leave you.  Day and night they're pleading, praying,     On the North-wind, on the West-wind, from the peak and from the plain;    Night and day they never leave me -- do you know what they are saying?     \"He was ours before you got him, and we want him once again.\"     Yes, they're wanting me, they're haunting me, the awful lonely places;     They're whining and they're whimpering as if each had a soul;    They're calling from the wilderness, the vast and God-like spaces,     The stark and sullen solitudes that sentinel the Pole.     They miss my little camp-fires, ever brightly, bravely gleaming     In the womb of desolation, where was never man before;    As comradeless I sought them, lion-hearted, loving, dreaming,     And they hailed me as a comrade, and they loved me evermore.     And now they're all a-crying, and it's no use me denying;     The spell of them is on me and I'm helpless as a child;    My heart is aching, aching, but I hear them, sleeping, waking;     It's the Lure of Little Voices, it's the mandate of the Wild.     I'm afraid to tell you, Honey, I can take no bitter leaving;     But softly in the sleep-time from your love I'll steal away.    Oh, it's cruel, dearie, cruel, and it's God knows how I'm grieving;     But His loneliness is calling, and He knows I must obey.     The Song of the Wage-Slave       When the long, long day is over, and the Big Boss gives me my pay,    I hope that it won't be hell-fire, as some of the parsons say.    And I hope that it won't be heaven, with some of the parsons I've met --    All I want is just quiet, just to rest and forget.    Look at my face, toil-furrowed; look at my calloused hands;    Master, I've done Thy bidding, wrought in Thy many lands --    Wrought for the little masters, big-bellied they be, and rich;    I've done their desire for a daily hire, and I die like a dog in a ditch.    I have used the strength Thou hast given, Thou knowest I did not shirk;    Threescore years of labor -- Thine be the long day's work.    And now, Big Master, I'm broken and bent and twisted and scarred,    But I've held my job, and Thou knowest, and Thou will not judge me hard.    Thou knowest my sins are many, and often I've played the fool --    Whiskey and cards and women, they made me the devil's tool.    I was just like a child with money; I flung it away with a curse,    Feasting a fawning parasite, or glutting a harlot's purse;    Then back to the woods repentant, back to the mill or the mine,    I, the worker of workers, everything in my line.    Everything hard but headwork (I'd no more brains than a kid),    A brute with brute strength to labor, doing as I was bid;    Living in camps with men-folk, a lonely and loveless life;    Never knew kiss of sweetheart, never caress of wife.    A brute with brute strength to labor, and they were so far above --    Yet I'd gladly have gone to the gallows for one little look of Love.    I, with the strength of two men, savage and shy and wild --    Yet how I'd ha' treasured a woman, and the sweet, warm kiss of a child!    Well, 'tis Thy world, and Thou knowest.  I blaspheme and my ways be rude;    But I've lived my life as I found it, and I've done my best to be good;    I, the primitive toiler, half naked and grimed to the eyes,    Sweating it deep in their ditches, swining it stark in their styes;    Hurling down forests before me, spanning tumultuous streams;    Down in the ditch building o'er me palaces fairer than dreams;    Boring the rock to the ore-bed, driving the road through the fen,    Resolute, dumb, uncomplaining, a man in a world of men.    Master, I've filled my contract, wrought in Thy many lands;    Not by my sins wilt Thou judge me, but by the work of my hands.    Master, I've done Thy bidding, and the light is low in the west,    And the long, long shift is over... Master, I've earned it -- Rest.     Grin       If you're up against a bruiser and you're getting knocked about --                                            Grin.    If you're feeling pretty groggy, and you're licked beyond a doubt --                                            Grin.    Don't let him see you're funking, let him know with every clout,    Though your face is battered to a pulp, your blooming heart is stout;    Just stand upon your pins until the beggar knocks you out --                                            And grin.    This life's a bally battle, and the same advice holds true   "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2070"],["title","To the Last Man (#1)"],["body","you talk.  And last, son, dont let    anything keep you in Oregon.  Reckon you have a sweetheart, and    if so fetch her along.  With love from your dad,     GASTON ISBEL.   Jean pondered over this letter.  Judged by memory of his father, who had always been self-sufficient, it had been a surprise and somewhat of a shock.  Weeks of travel and reflection had not helped him to grasp the meaning between the lines.  \"Yes, dad's growin' old,\" mused Jean, feeling a warmth and a sadness stir in him.  \"He must be 'way over sixty.  But he never looked old.... So he's rich now an' losin' stock, an' goin' to be sheeped off his range.  Dad could stand a lot of rustlin', but not much from sheepmen.\"  The softness that stirred in Jean merged into a cold, thoughtful earnestness which had followed every perusal of his father's letter. A dark, full current seemed flowing in his veins, and at times he felt it swell and heat.  It troubled him, making him conscious of a deeper, stronger self, opposed to his careless, free, and dreamy nature.  No ties had bound him in Oregon, except love for the great, still forests and the thundering rivers; and this love came from his softer side.  It had cost him a wrench to leave.  And all the way by ship down the coast to San Diego and across the Sierra Madres by stage, and so on to this last overland travel by horseback, he had felt a retreating of the self that was tranquil and happy and a dominating of this unknown somber self, with its menacing possibilities.  Yet despite a nameless regret and a loyalty to Oregon, when he lay in his blankets he had to confess a keen interest in his adventurous future, a keen enjoyment of this stark, wild Arizona.  It appeared to be a different sky stretching in dark, star-spangled dome over him--closer, vaster, bluer.  The strong fragrance of sage and cedar floated over him with the camp-fire smoke, and all seemed drowsily to subdue his thoughts.  At dawn he rolled out of his blankets and, pulling on his boots, began the day with a zest for the work that must bring closer his calling future.  White, crackling frost and cold, nipping air were the same keen spurs to action that he had known in the uplands of Oregon, yet they were not wholly the same.  He sensed an exhilaration similar to the effect of a strong, sweet wine.  His horse and mule had fared well during the night, having been much refreshed by the grass and water of the little canyon.  Jean mounted and rode into the cedars with gladness that at last he had put the endless leagues of barren land behind him.  The trail he followed appeared to be seldom traveled.  It led, according to the meager information obtainable at the last settlement, directly to what was called the Rim, and from there Grass Valley could be seen down in the Basin.  The ascent of the ground was so gradual that only in long, open stretches could it be seen.  But the nature of the vegetation showed Jean how he was climbing.  Scant, low, scraggy cedars gave place to more numerous, darker, greener, bushier ones, and these to high, full-foliaged, green-berried trees.  Sage and grass in the open flats grew more luxuriously.  Then came the pinyons, and presently among them the checker-barked junipers.  Jean hailed the first pine tree with a hearty slap on the brown, rugged bark.  It was a small dwarf pine struggling to live.  The next one was larger, and after that came several, and beyond them pines stood up everywhere above the lower trees.  Odor of pine needles mingled with the other dry smells that made the wind pleasant to Jean.  In an hour from the first line of pines he had ridden beyond the cedars and pinyons into a slowly thickening and deepening forest.  Underbrush appeared scarce except in ravines, and the ground in open patches held a bleached grass. Jean's eye roved for sight of squirrels, birds, deer, or any moving creature. It appeared to be a dry, uninhabited forest.  About midday Jean halted at a pond of surface water, evidently melted snow, and gave his animals a drink.  He saw a few old deer tracks in the mud and several huge bird tracks new to him which he concluded must have been made by wild turkeys.  The trail divided at this pond.  Jean had no idea which branch he ought to take.  \"Reckon it doesn't matter,\" he muttered, as he was about to remount.  His horse was standing with ears up, looking back along the trail.  Then Jean heard a clip-clop of trotting hoofs, and presently espied a horseman.  Jean made a pretense of tightening his saddle girths while he peered over his horse at the approaching rider.  All men in this country were going to be of exceeding interest to Jean Isbel.  This man at a distance rode and looked like all the Arizonians Jean had seen, he had a superb seat in the saddle, and he was long and lean.  He wore a huge black sombrero and a soiled red scarf.  His vest was open and he was without a coat.  The rider came trotting up and halted several paces from Jean  \"Hullo, stranger!\" he said, gruffly.  \"Howdy yourself!\" replied Jean.  He felt an instinctive importance in the meeting with the man.  Never had sharper eyes flashed over Jean and his outfit.  He had a dust-colored, sun-burned face, long, lean, and hard, a huge sandy mustache that hid his mouth, and eyes of piercing light intensity.  Not very much hard Western experience had passed by this man, yet he was not old, measured by years. When he dismounted Jean saw he was tall, even for an Arizonian.  \"Seen your tracks back a ways,\" he said, as he slipped the bit to let his horse drink.  \"Where bound?\"  \"Reckon I'm lost, all right,\" replied Jean.  \"New country for me.\"  \"Shore.  I seen thet from your tracks an' your last camp.  Wal, where was you headin' for before you got lost?\"  The query was deliberately cool, with a dry, crisp ring.  Jean felt the lack of friendliness or kindliness in it.  \"Grass Valley.  My name's Isbel,\" he replied, shortly.  The rider attended to his drinking horse and presently rebridled him; then with long swing of leg he appeared to step into the saddle.  \"Shore I knowed you was Jean Isbel,\" he said.  \"Everybody in the Tonto has heerd old Gass Isbel sent fer his boy.\"  \"Well then, why did you ask?\" inquired Jean, bluntly.  \"Reckon I wanted to see what you'd say.\"  \"So?  All right.  But I'm not carin' very much for what YOU say.\"  Their glances locked steadily then and each measured the other by the intangible conflict of spirit.  \"Shore thet's natural,\" replied the rider.  His speech was slow, and the motions of his long, brown hands, as he took a cigarette from his vest, kept time with his words.  \"But seein' you're one of the Isbels, I'll hev my say whether you want it or not.  My name's Colter an' I'm one of the sheepmen Gass Isbel's riled with.\"  \"Colter.  Glad to meet you,\" replied Jean.  \"An' I reckon who riled my father is goin' to rile me.\"  \"Shore.  If thet wasn't so you'd not be an Isbel,\" returned Colter, with a grim little laugh.  \"It's easy to see you ain't run into any Tonto Basin fellers yet.  Wal, I'm goin' to tell you thet your old man gabbed like a woman down at Greaves's store.  Bragged aboot you an' how you could fight an' how you could shoot an' how you could track a hoss or a man!  Bragged how you'd chase every sheep herder back up on the Rim.... I'm tellin' you because we want you to git our stand right. We're goin' to run sheep down in Grass Valley.\"  \"Ahuh!  Well, who's we?\" queried Jean, curtly.  \"What-at? ... We--I mean the sheepmen rangin' this Rim from Black Butte to the Apache country.\"  \"Colter, I'm a stranger in Arizona,\" said Jean, slowly.  \"I know little about ranchers or sheepmen.  It's true my father sent for me.  It's true, I dare say, that he bragged, for he was given to bluster an' blow. An' he's old now.  I can't help it if he bragged about me.  But if he has, an' if he's justified in his stand against you sheepmen, I'm goin' to do my best to live up to his brag.\"  \"I get your hunch.  Shore we understand each other, an' thet's a powerful help.  You take my hunch to your old man,\" replied Colter, as he turned his horse away toward the left.  \"Thet trail leadin' south is yours.  When you come to the Rim you'll see a bare spot down in the Basin.  Thet 'll be Grass Valley.\"  He rode away out of sight into the woods.  Jean leaned against his horse and pondered.  It seemed difficult to be just to this Colter, not because of his claims, but because of a subtle hostility that emanated from him.  Colter had the hard face, the masked intent, the turn of speech that Jean had come to associate with dishonest men. Even if Jean had not been prejudiced, if he had known nothing of his father's trouble with these sheepmen, and if Colter had met him only to exchange glances and greetings, still Jean would never have had a favorable impression.  Colter grated upon him, roused an antagonism seldom felt.  \"Heigho!\" sighed the young man, \"Good-by to huntin' an' fishing'! Dad's given me a man's job.\"  With that he mounted his horse and started the pack mule into the right-hand trail.  Walking and trotting, he traveled all afternoon, toward sunset getting into heavy forest of pine.  More than one snow bank showed white through the green, sheltered on the north slopes of shady ravines.  And it was upon entering this zone of richer, deeper forestland that Jean sloughed off his gloomy forebodings.  These stately pines were not the giant firs of Oregon, but any lover of the woods could be happy under them.  Higher still he climbed until the forest spread before and around him like a level park, with thicketed ravines here and there on each side.  And presently that deceitful level led to a higher bench upon which the pines towered, and were matched by beautiful trees he took for spruce.  Heavily barked, with regular spreading branches, these conifers rose in symmetrical shape to spear the sky with silver plumes.  A graceful gray-green moss, waved like veils from the branches.
