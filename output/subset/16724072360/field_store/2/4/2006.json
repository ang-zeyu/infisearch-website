The way they dive at each other is something to see.\"  Rip grinned. \"I didn’t know I was going to _fleedle_ those officers. It isn’t the way I usually enter a cruiser.\" He hadn’t entered many. He added, \"I suppose I ought to report to someone.\"  Koa shook his head. \"No use, sir. You can’t walk around very well until the ship reaches brennschluss. Besides, you won’t find any space officers who’ll talk to you.\"  Rip stared. \"Why not?\"  \"Because we’re Planeteers. They’ll give us the treatment. They always do. When the commander of this bucket gets good and ready, he’ll send for you. Until then, we might as well take it easy.\" He pulled a bar of Venusian _chru_ from his pocket. \"Have some. It will make breathing easier.\"  The terrific acceleration made breathing a little uncomfortable, but it was not too bad. The chief effect was to make Rip feel as though a ton of invisible feathers were crushing him against the vertical brace. He accepted a bite of the bittersweet vegetable candy and munched thoughtfully. Koa seemed to take it for granted that the spacemen would give them a rough time.  He asked, \"Aren’t there any spacemen who get along with the Special Order Squadrons?\"  \"Never met one.\" Koa chewed _chru_. \"And I was on the _Icarus_ when the whole thing started.\"  Rip looked at him in surprise. Koa didn’t seem that old. The bad feeling between spacemen and the Special Order Squadrons had started about 18 years ago when the cruiser _Icarus_ had taken the first Planeteers to Mercury.  He reviewed the history of the expedition. The spacemen’s job had been to land the newly created Special Order Squadron on the hot planet. The job of the squadron was to explore it. Somehow, confusion developed and the spacemen, including the officers, later reported that the squadron had instructed them to land on the sun side of Mercury, which would have destroyed the spaceship and its crew, or so they believed at the time.  The commanding officer of the squadron denied issuing such an order. He said his instructions were to land as close to the sun side as possible, but not on it. Whatever the truth—and Rip believed the SOS version, of course—the crew of the _Icarus_ mutinied, or tried to. They made the landing on Mercury with squadron guns pointed at their heads. Of course, they found that a sun-side landing wouldn’t have hurt the ship. The whole affair was pretty well hushed up, but it produced bad feeling between the Special Order Squadrons and the spacemen. \"Trigger happy space bums,\" the spacemen called them, and much worse besides.  The men of the Special Order Squadrons, searching for a handy nickname, had called themselves Planeteers, because most of their work was on the planets. As Major Joe Barris had told the officers of Rip’s class, \"You might say that the spacemen own space, but we Planeteers own everything solid that’s found in it.\"  The Planeteers were the specialists—in science, exploration, colonization, and fighting. The spacemen carried them back and forth, kept them supplied, and handled their message traffic. The Planeteers did the hard work and the important work. Or so they believed.  To become a Planeteer, a recruit had to pass rigid intelligence, physical, aptitude, and psychological tests. Less than 15 out of each 100 who applied were chosen. Then there were two years of hard training on the space platform and the moon before a recruit was finally accepted as a Planeteer private. Out of each 15 who started training, an average of five fell by the wayside.  For Planeteer officers, the requirements were even tougher. Only one out of each 500 applicants finally received a commission. Six years of training made them proficient in the techniques of exploration, fighting, rocketeering, and both navigation and astrogation. In addition, each became a full-fledged specialist in one field of science. Rip’s specialty was astrophysics.  Sergeant-major Koa continued, \"That business on the _Icarus_ started the war, but both sides have been feeding it ever since. I have to admit that we Planeteers lord it over the spacemen like we were old man Cosmos himself. So they get back at us with dirty little tricks while we’re on their ships. We command on the planets, but they command in space. And they sure get a great big nuclear charge out of commanding us to do the dirty work!\"  \"We’ll take whatever they hand us,\" Rip assured him, \"and pretend we like it fine.\" He gestured at the other Planeteers. \"Tell me about the men, Koa.\"  \"They’re a fine bunch, sir. I hand-picked them myself. The one with the white hair is Corporal Nels Pederson. He’s a Swede. I served with him at Marsport, and he’s a real rough space spickaroo in a fight. The other corporal is little Paulo Santos. He’s a Filipino, and the best snapper-boat gunner you ever saw.\"  He pointed out the six privates. Kemp and Dowst were Americans. Bradshaw was an Englishman, Trudeau a Frenchman, Dominico an Italian, and Nunez a Brazilian.  Rip liked their looks. They were as relaxed as acceleration would allow, but you got the impression that they would leap into action in a microsecond if the word were given. He couldn’t imagine what kind of assignment was waiting, but he was satisfied with his Planeteers. They looked capable of anything.  He made himself as comfortable as possible, and encouraged Koa to talk about his service in the Special Order Squadrons. Koa had plenty to tell, and he talked interestingly. Rip learned that the big Hawaiian had been to every planet in the system, had fought the Venusians on the central desert, and had mined nuclite with SOS One on Mercury. He also found that Koa was one of the 17 pure-blooded Hawaiians left. During the three hours that acceleration kept them from moving around the ship, Rip got a new view of space and of service with the SOS—it was the view of a Planeteer who had spent years around the Solar System.  \"I’m glad they assigned you to me,\" Rip told Koa frankly. \"This is my first job, and I’ll be pretty green, no matter what it is. I’ll depend on you for a lot of things.\"  To his surprise, Koa thrust out his hand. \"Shake, Lieutenant.\" His grin showed strong white teeth. \"You’re the first junior officer I ever met who admitted he didn’t know everything about everything. You can depend on me, sir. I won’t steer you into any meteor swarms.\"  Koa had half turned to shake hands. Suddenly he spun on around, his head banging against the deck. Rip felt a surge of loosened muscles that had been braced against acceleration. At the same time, silence flooded in on them with an almost physical shock. He murmured, \"brennschluss,\" and the murmur was like a trumpet blast.  The _Scorpius_ had reached velocity and the nuclear drive had cut out. From terrific acceleration they had dropped to zero. The ship was making high speed, but velocity cannot be felt. For the moment, the men were weightless.  A near-by spaceman had heard Rip’s comment. He spoke in an undertone to the man nearest. His voice was pitched low enough so Rip couldn’t object officially, but loud enough to be heard.  \"Get this, gang. The Planeteer officer knows what brennschluss is. He doesn’t look old enough to know which end his bubble goes on.\"  Rip started to his feet, but Koa’s hand on his arm restrained him. With a violent kick the big sergeant-major shot through the air. His line of flight took him by the spaceman, and somehow their arms got linked. The spaceman was jerked from his post and the two came to a stop against the ceiling.  Koa’s voice echoed through the ship. \"Sorry. I’m not used to no-weight. Didn’t mean to grab you. Here, I’ll help you back to your post.\"  He whirled the helpless spaceman like a bag of feathers and slung him through the air. The force of the action only flattened Koa against the ceiling, but the hapless spaceman shot forward head first and landed with a clang against the bulkhead. He didn’t hit hard enough to break any bones, but he would carry a bump around on his head for a day or two.  Koa’s voice floated after him. \"Great Cosmos! I sure am sorry, spaceman. I guess I don’t know my own strength.\" He kicked away from the ceiling, landing accurately at Rip’s side. He added in a hard voice all could hear, \"They sure are a nice gang, these spacemen. They never say anything about Planeteers.\"  No spaceman answered, but Koa’s meaning was clear. No spaceman had better say anything about the Planeteers! Rip saw that the deputy commander and the safety officer had appeared not to notice the incident. Technically, there was no reason for an officer to take action. It had all been an \"accident.\" He smiled. There was a lot he had to learn about dealing with spacemen, a lot Koa evidently knew very well indeed.  Suddenly he began to feel weight. The ship was going into rotation. The feeling increased until he felt normally heavy again. There was no other sensation, even though the space cruiser now was spinning on its axis through space at unaltered speed. The centrifugal force produced by the spinning gave them an artificial gravity.  Now that he thought about it, brennschluss had come pretty early. The trip apparently was going to be a short one. Brennschluss ... funny, he thought, how words stay on in a language even after their original meaning is changed. Brennschluss was German for \"burn out.\" It was rocket talk, and it meant the moment when all the fuel in a rocket burned out. It had come into common use because the English \"burn out\" also could mean that the engine itself had burned out. The German word meant only the one thing. Now, in nuclear drive ships, the same word was used for the moment when power was cut off.  Words interested him. He started to mention it to Koa just as the telescreen lit up. An officer’s face appeared. \"Send that Planeteer officer to the commander,\" the face said. \"Tell him to show an exhaust.\"  Rip called instantly to the safety officer. \"Where’s his office?\"  The safety"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20154"],["title","Invaders from the Infinite (#1)"],["body","ned. But light, slow crawling thing, would take hours to cross the gulf of space, and radio travels no faster.  Half conscious, fighting for his faculties with all his will, the pilot turned to the screen. A ship! A strange, glistening thing streamlined to the nth degree, every spare corner rounded till the resistance was at the irreducible minimum. But, in the great pilotport of the stranger, the patrol pilot saw faces, and gasped in surprise as he saw them! Terrible faces, blotched, contorted. Patches of white skin, patches of brown, patches of black, blotched and twisted across the faces. Long, lean faces, great wide flat foreheads above, skulls strangely squared, more box-like than man's rounded skull. The ears were large, pointed tips at the top. Their hair was a silky mane that extended low over the forehead, and ran back, spreading above the ears, and down the neck.  Then, as that emotion of surprise and astonishment weakened his will momentarily, oblivion came, with what seemed a fleeting instant of memories. His life seemed to flash before his mind in serried rank, a file of events, his childhood, his life, his marriage, his wife, an image of smiling comfort, then the years, images of great and near great men, his knowledge of history, pictures of great war of 2074, pictures of the attackers of the Black Star--then calm oblivion, quiet blankness.  The long, silent ship that had hovered near him turned, and pointed toward the pinhead of matter that glowed brilliantly in the flaming jewel box of the heavens. It was gone in an instant, rushing toward Sun and Earth at a speed that outraced the flying radio message, leaving the ship of the Guard Patrol behind, and leaving the Pilot as he leaves our story.     Chapter II  CANINE PEOPLE   \"And that,\" said Arcot between puffs, \"will certainly be a great boon to the Rocket Patrol, you must admit. They don't like dueling with these space-pirates using the molecular rays, and since molecular rays have such a tremendous commercial value, we can't prohibit the sale of ray apparatus. Now, if you will come into the 'workshop,' Fuller, I'll give a demonstration with friend Morey's help.\"  The four friends rose, Morey, Wade and Fuller following Arcot into his laboratory on the thirty-seventh floor of the Arcot Research Building. As they went, Arcot explained to Fuller the results and principles of the latest product of the ingenuity of the \"Triumvirate,\" as Arcot, Morey and Wade had come to be called in the news dispatches.  \"As you know, the molecular rays make all the molecules of any piece of matter they are turned upon move in the desired direction. Since they supply no new energy, but make the body they are turned upon supply its own, using the energy of its own random molecular motion of heat, they are practically impossible to stop. The energy necessary for molecular rays to take effect is so small that the usual type of filter lets enough of it pass. A ship equipped with filters is no better off when attacked than one without. The rays simply drove the front end into the rear, or _vice versa_, or tore it to pieces as the pirates desired. The Rocket Patrol could kill off the pirates, but they lost so many men in the process, it was a Phyrric victory.  \"For some time Morey and I have been working on something to stop the rays. Obviously it can't be by means of any of the usual metallic energy absorption screens.  \"We finally found a combination of rays, better frequencies, that did what we wanted. I have such an apparatus here. What we want you to do, of course, is the usual job of rearranging the stuff so that the apparatus can be made from dies, and put into quantity production. As the Official Designer for the A.A.L. you ought to do that easily.\" Arcot grinned as Fuller looked in amazement at the apparatus Arcot had picked up from the bench in the \"workshop.\"  \"Don't get worried,\" laughed Morey, \"that's got a lifting unit combined--just a plain ordinary molecular lift such as you see by the hundreds out there.\" Morey pointed through the great window where thousands of those lift units were carrying men, women and children through the air, lifting them hundreds, thousands of feet above the streets and through the doors of buildings.  \"Here's an ordinary molecular pistol. I'm going to put the suit on, and rise about five feet off the floor. You can turn the pistol on me, and see what impression it makes on the suit.\"  Fuller took the molecular ray pistol, while Wade helped Arcot into the suit. He looked at the pistol dubiously, pointed it at a heavy casting of iron resting in one corner of the room, and turned the ray at low concentration, then pressed the trigger-button. The casting gave out a low, scrunching grind, and slid toward him with a lurch. Instantly he shut off the power. \"This isn't any ordinary pistol. It's got seven or eight times the ordinary power!\" he exclaimed.  \"Oh yes, I forgot,\" Morey said. \"Instead of the fuel battery that the early pistols used, this has a space-distortion power coil. This pistol has as much power as the usual A-39 power unit for commercial work.\"  By the time Morey had explained the changes to Fuller, Arcot had the suit on, and was floating five or six feet in the air, like a grotesque captive balloon. \"Ready, Fuller?\"  \"I guess so, but I certainly hope that suit is all it is claimed to be. If it isn't--well I'd rather not commit murder.\"  \"It'll work,\" said Arcot. \"I'll bet my neck on that!\" Suddenly he was surrounded by the faintest of auras, a strange, wavering blue light, like the hazy corona about a 400,000-volt power line. \"Now try it.\"  Fuller pointed the pistol at the floating man and pushed the trigger. The brilliant blue beam of the molecular ray, and the low hum of the air, rushing in the path of the director beam, stabbed out toward Arcot. The faint aura about him was suddenly intensified a million times till he floated in a ball of blue-white fire. Scarcely visible, the air about him blazed with bluish incandescence of ionization.  \"Increase the power,\" suggested Morey. Fuller turned on more power. The blue halo was shot through with tiny violet sparks, the sharp odor of ozone in the air was stifling; the heat of wasted energy was making the room hotter. The power increased further, and the tiny sparks were waving streamers, that laced across the surface of the blue fire. Little jets of electric flame reached out along the beam of the ray now. Finally, as full power of the molecular ray was reached, the entire halo was buried under a mass of writhing sparks that seemed to leap up into the air above the man's head, wavering up to extinction. The room was unbearably hot, despite the molecular ray coolers absorbing the heat of the air, and blowing cooled air into the room.  Fuller snapped off the ray, and put the pistol on the table beside him. The halo died, and went out a moment later, and Arcot settled to the floor.  \"This particular suit will stand up against anything the ordinary commercial sets will give. The system now: remember that the rays are short electrical waves. The easiest way to stop them is to interpose a wave of opposite phase, and cause interference. Fine, but try to get in tune with an unknown wave when it is moving in relation to your center of control. It is impossible to do it before you yourself have been rayed out of existence. We must use some system that will automatically, instantly be out of phase.  \"The Hall effect would naturally tend to make the frequency of a wave through a resisting medium change, and lengthen. If we can send out a spherical wave front, and have it lengthen rapidly as it proceeds, we will have a wave front that is, at all points, different. Any entering wave would, sooner or later, meet a wave that was half a phase out, no matter what the motion was, nor what the frequency, as long as it lies within the comparatively narrow molecular wave band. What this apparatus, or ray screen, consists of, is a machine generating a spherical wave front of the nature of a molecular wave, but of just too great a frequency to do anything. A second part generates a condition in space, which opposes that wave. After traveling a certain distance, the wave has lengthened to molecular wave type, but is now beyond the machine which generated it, and no longer affects it, or damages it. However, as it proceeds, it continues to lengthen, till eventually it reaches the length of infra-light, when the air quickly absorbs it, as it reaches one of the absorption bands for air molecular waves, and any molecular wave must find its half-wave complement somewhere in that wedge of waves. It does, and is at once choked off, its energy fighting the energy of the ray screen, of course. In the air, however, the screen is greatly helped by the fact that before the half-wave frequency is met in the ray-wedge, the molecular ray is buried in ions, leaving the ray screen little work to do.  \"Now your job is to design the apparatus in a form that machines can make automatically. We tried doing it ourselves for the fun of it, but we couldn't see how we could make a machine that didn't need at least two humans to supervise.\"  \"Well,\" grinned Fuller, \"you have it all over me as scientists, but as economic workers--two human supervisors to make one product!\"  \"All right--we agree. But no, let's see you--Lord! What was that?\" Morey started for the door on the run. The building was still trembling from the shock of a heavy blow, a blow that seemed much as though a machine had been wrecked on the armored roof, and a big machine at that. Arcot, a flying suit already on, was up in the air, and darting past Morey in an instant, streaking for the vertical shaft that would let him out to the roof. The molecular ray pistol was already in his hand, ready to pull any beams off unfortunate victims pinned under them.  In a moment he had flashed up through the seven stories, and out to the roof.
