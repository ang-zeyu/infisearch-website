Smiling a little at her manner, Prale lifted his hat, picked up the suit case, and turned away. Once more he tried to force a passage through the jostling crowd. He had not taken three steps when Kate Gilbert touched him on the arm.  \"Pardon me, Mr. Prale, but there is something sticking on the end of your suit case,\" she said.  Prale glanced down. On one end of the suit case was a bit of paper. It had been stuck there by a drop of mucilage, and the mucilage was still wet.  He thanked Kate Gilbert and picked the paper off, but he did not throw it over the rail into the water. He crumpled it in his hand and, when he was some distance away, he smoothed it out.  There was a single word written on it, in the same handwriting as that of the note he had found pinned to the pillow in the stateroom--\"Retribution.\"  Sidney Prale glanced around quickly. Nobody seemed to be paying particular attention to him. Kate Gilbert and her maid had passed him and were preparing to land. Prale put the piece of paper into his coat pocket and picked up his suit case again. That bit of paper, he knew well, had not been on the suit case when he had left the stateroom. It had been put there as he had made his way through the crowd of passengers along the rail. Who could have stuck it there--and why?  Now the passengers were streaming ashore, and Sidney Prale stepped to one side and watched them. Perhaps he had some business enemy on board, he told himself, some man he had not noticed, and who was trying to frighten him after a childish fashion. He searched the faces of the landing passengers, but saw nobody he had known in Central America, nobody who looked at all suspicious.  \"Either a joke--or a mistake,\" Prale told himself again.  He started ashore. He saw Kate Gilbert just ahead of him, the bulky maid at her heels. An elderly man met her, but did not greet her as a father would have been expected to do. Prale saw them hold a whispered conversation, and it seemed to him that the elderly man gave him a searching glance.  \"I must look like a swindler!\" Prale mused.  Finally, as he went out upon the street to engage a taxicab and start for a hotel, he saw Kate Gilbert and her maid and the elderly man again, getting into a limousine. The girl held a piece of paper in her hand, and was reading something from it to the elderly man. As she got into the car, she dropped the piece of paper to the curb.  The limousine was gone before Prale reached the curb. He put his suit case down and picked up the piece of paper. There was nothing on it except a couple of names that meant nothing to Sidney Prale. But his eyes bulged, nevertheless, as he read them.  For the paper was similar to that upon which had been written the note that he had found on the pillow in the stateroom--and the coarse handwriting was the same!  \"What the deuce----\" Prale caught himself saying.  Had Kate Gilbert written that message about retribution and had her maid leave it in the stateroom? Had Kate Gilbert written that single word and had her maid paste it on his suit case as he passed, or pasted it there herself?  Why had Kate Gilbert--whom he never had seen and of whom he never had heard until she appeared at the ball in Tegucigalpa--avoided him in such a peculiar manner? And why had the misnamed Marie glared at him, and expressed loathing and anger when her eyes met his?  \"What the deuce----\" Prale asked himself again.  Then a taxicab drew up at the curb, and he got in.     CHAPTER III  SOME DISCOURTESIES   Sidney Prale obtained accommodations in a prominent hostelry on Fifth Avenue, bathed, dressed, ate luncheon, and then went out upon the streets, walking briskly and swinging his stick, going about New York like a stranger who never had seen it before.  As a matter of fact, he never had seen this New York before. He had expected a multitude of changes, but nothing compared to what he found. He watched the crowds on the Avenue, cut over to Broadway and investigated the electric signs by daylight, observed the congestion of vehicles and the efforts of traffic policemen to straighten it out. He darted into the subway and rode far downtown and back again just for the sport of it. After that he got on an omnibus and rode up to Central Park, and acted as if every tree and twig were an old friend.  He made himself acquainted with the animals in the zoo there, and promised himself to go to the other zoo in the Bronx before the end of the week. He stood back at the curb and lifted his head to look at new buildings after the manner of the comic supplement farmer with a straw between his teeth.  \"Great--great!\" said Sidney Prale.  Then he hurried back to the hotel, dressed for dinner, and went down to the dining room, stopping on the way to obtain a ticket for a musical revue that was the talk of the town at the moment.  Prale ordered a dinner that made the waiter open his eyes. He made it a point to select things that were not on the menus of the hotels in Honduras. Then he sat back in his chair and listened to the orchestra, and watched well-dressed men and women come in and get their places at the tables.  But the dinner was a disappointment to Prale after all. It seemed to him that the waiter was a long time giving him service. He remonstrated, and the man asked pardon and said that he would do better, but he did not.  Prale found that his soup was lukewarm, his salad dressing prepared imperfectly, the salad itself a mere mess of vegetables. The fish and fowl he had ordered were not served properly, the dessert was without flavor, the cheese was stale. He sent for the head waiter.  \"I'm disgusted with the food and the service,\" he complained. \"I rarely find fault, but I am compelled to do so this time. The man who has been serving me seems to be a rank amateur, and twice he was almost insolent. This hotel has a reputation which it scarcely is maintaining this evening.\"  \"I'll see about it, sir,\" the head waiter said.  Prale saw him stop the waiter and speak to him, and the waiter glared at him when he brought the demi-tasse. Prale did not care. He glared back at the man, drank the coffee, and touched the match to a cigar. Then he signed the check and went from the dining room, an angry and disgusted man.  \"Another thing like that, and I look for the manager,\" he told himself.  He supposed that he was a victim of circumstances--that the waiter was a new man and that it happened that the portions he served were poor portions. His happiness at being home again prevented Sidney Prale from feeling anger for any length of time. He got his hat and coat and went out upon the street again.  He had an hour before time to go to the theater. He walked over to Broadway and went toward the north, looking at the bright lights and the crowds. He passed through two or three hotel lobbies, satisfied for the time merely to be in the midst of the throngs.  At the proper time, he hurried to the theater and claimed his seat. The performance was a mediocre one, but it pleased Sidney Prale. He had seen a better show in Honduras a month before, had seen better dancing and heard better singing and comedy, but this was New York!  The show at an end, Prale claimed his hat and coat at the check room and walked down the street toward a cabaret restaurant. He reached into his overcoat pocket for his gloves, and his hand encountered a slip of paper. He took it out.  There was the same rough handwriting on the same kind of paper, and evidently with the same blunt pencil.  \"Remember--retribution is sure!\"  \"This thing ceases to be a joke!\" Prale told himself.  His face flushed with anger, and he turned back toward the theater. But he had been among the last to leave, and already the lights of the playhouse were being turned out. The boy in charge of the check room would be gone, Prale knew.  He thought of Kate Gilbert again, and the bit of paper she had dropped as she got into the limousine down on the water front. Surely she could have no hand in this, he thought. What interest could Kate Gilbert, a casual acquaintance and reputed daughter of a wealthy house, have in him and his affairs?  \"Somebody is making a mistake,\" he declared to himself, \"or else it is some sort of a new advertising dodge. If I ever catch the jokesmith who is responsible for these dainty little messages, I'll tell him a thing or two.\"  Prale turned into the restaurant and found a seat at a little table at one side of the room. The after-theater crowd was filling the place. The orchestra was playing furiously, and the cabaret performance was beginning. Sidney Prale leaned back in his chair and watched the show. The waiter came to his side, and he ordered something to eat and drink.  Then he saw Kate Gilbert again, at a table not very far away from his. She was dressed in an evening gown, as if she had just come from the theater or opera. She was in the company of the elderly man who had met her at the wharf, and a young man and an older woman were at the same table.  Prale's eyes met hers for an instant, and he inclined his head a bit in a respectful manner. But Kate Gilbert looked through him as if he had not been present, and then turned her head and began talking to the elderly man.  Prale's face flushed. He hadn't done anything wrong, he told himself. He merely had bowed to her, as he would have bowed to any woman to whom he had been properly introduced. She had seen fit to cut him. Well, he could exist without Kate Gilbert, he told himself, but he wondered at her peculiar manner.  He left the place within the hour and went back to the hotel and to bed. In the morning he walked up the Avenue as far as the Circle, dropped into a restaurant for a good breakfast, and then engaged a taxicab and drove downtown to the financial district. He had remembered that he was a man with a million, and that he had to pay some attention to business.  He went into the establishment of a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21894"],["title","The Rover Boys at Colby Hall; or, The Struggles of the Young Cadets (#1)"],["body","anything like that, Dad,\" answered Fred Rover. \"We were going to have a little fight between ourselves, playing rival firemen. We aimed the water at the hedge, and we didn't see Ness and Aleck until they let out a yell.\"  \"But I saw two of you playing the water in that direction,\" cried Dick Rover. \"You were one of them, Jack.\"  \"Oh, well, Dad, what was the harm after they were all wet?\" pleaded his son. \"They'd have to change their clothing anyway.\"  \"That's just it,\" added Andy Rover quickly, with his eyes twinkling from merriment. \"A little more water won't hurt a person when he's already soaked. It's just like spoiling a rotten egg--it can't be done,\" and at this reply, both Dick Rover and his brother, the fun-loving Tom, had to turn away their faces to hide their amusement. Nevertheless, Dick sobered his face almost instantly as he answered:  \"Well, these pranks around the farm have got to stop. You'll have your grandfather and Uncle Randolph and Aunt Martha all upset, not to say anything about your sisters and your mothers. It's a fortunate thing that they went down to the town to do some shopping. Otherwise I think all of you would be in for quite some punishment.\"  \"Oh! Then you're not going to punish us, are you?\" broke in Randy Rover quickly. \"That's fine! I knew you wouldn't mind our having a little fun.\"  \"Don't be so fast, young man,\" returned his father. \"Your Uncle Dick may be too lenient. I am rather of the opinion that you and your brother, if not your cousins, have got to be taken in hand.\"  \"Oh, please, Massa Tom, don' go fo' to punish 'em,\" burst out old Aleck Pop. \"I--I don't s'pose dey meant any great ha'm, even do dey did t'row dat stream of wattah right in dis yere coon's mouf;\" and he smiled broadly, showing a row of ivories, rather the worse for wear.  \"I think all of you boys had better go into the house and get some dry clothing on before your mothers put in an appearance,\" suggested Dick Rover. \"If they see you like this, all dripping wet, they'll certainly be worried.\"  \"All right, Dad; I'll do it,\" answered Jack, quickly. And then he motioned to his cousins. \"Come on, let's see how fast we can make the change;\" and off into the big farmhouse rushed the boys, clattering up the back stairs one after the other, to the two big rooms which they occupied.  \"Some boys!\" was Sam Rover's comment, as he shook his head doubtfully.  \"They are certainly growing older--and wilder,\" returned Dick Rover.  \"We've got to take them in hand--that is dead certain!\" said Tom Rover, with conviction. \"Why! if I don't do something with Andy and Randy pretty soon, they'll be as--as----\"  \"As bad as you were, Tom, at their age,\" finished Dick Rover, with a smile.  \"Now you've said something, Dick,\" affirmed Sam Rover. \"Andy isn't quite so bad when it comes to playing tricks, although he certainly says some awfully funny things, but when it comes to doing things Randy continually puts me in mind of Tom.\"  \"Oh, say! To hear you fellows talk, you'd think that I was the worst boy that ever lived,\" grumbled Tom Rover. \"What did I ever do to raise such a rumpus as this?\"  \"Phew! What did he ever do to raise such a rumpus as this?\" mocked Sam Rover. \"Well, what didn't he do? When father went to Africa and disappeared and we came down here to good old Valley Brook Farm, wasn't he the constant torment of Uncle Randolph and Aunt Martha, and the hired girl, and all the rest of the community until, in sheer despair, uncle had to send us off to Putnam Hall? And when we went to the Hall, who was the first one to get into trouble--exploding a giant firecracker on the campus? Answer me that, will you?\"  \"Ancient history,\" murmured Tom Rover, dryly. But then, of a sudden his eyes began to twinkle. \"No use talking, though, we certainly did have some good times in those days, didn't we?\" he continued. \"Do you remember how we got the best of old Josiah Crabtree?\"  \"Yes. And how we got the best of a whole lot of our enemies,\" added Sam Rover.  \"Yes, and what gloriously good times we did have at Putnam Hall and at Brill College,\" came from Dick Rover, with a sigh. \"Sometimes I wish all those happy days could be lived over again.\"  \"When you think of those days, Dick, just think of what great times are in store for our boys,\" said Sam. \"I only trust they have as good times as we had.\"  \"I guess they'll know how to take care of themselves all right enough,\" was Tom Rover's comment. \"But, just the same, we can't permit them to become too wild. Sending them to that private school in New York City doesn't seem to have done them so very much good, although, of course, I admit they are well educated for their age.\"  \"I know where I'm going to send Jack when the proper time comes,\" answered Dick Rover.  \"Where?\" came from his brothers.  \"I'm going to send him to Colby Hall, the military academy which our old school chum, Larry Colby, has opened. Larry sent me some of his literature some time ago; and I have heard from several people that it's already a first-class institution of learning--every bit as good as Putnam Hall.\"  \"Well, if it's half as good as dear old Putnam Hall it must be some school,\" said Tom Rover. \"And there's no reason why Larry Colby shouldn't be able to run a first-class military academy. He was a good scholar and a first-class cadet when he was at Putnam Hall.\"  \"After Larry left Putnam Hall he went to travel in Europe,\" continued Dick. \"Then he went through college, and immediately after that he joined the militia of New York State and there worked his way up until he now sports the title of colonel.\"  \"Colonel Colby, eh? That's going some,\" was Tom's comment.  \"His school is patterned after West Point, as was Putnam Hall, and I understand he has a West Point officer there to instruct the cadets in military tactics.\"  \"Well, that's the sort of school our boys will need,\" answered Tom Rover. \"The stricter it is the better it will be for them.\"  \"I think it would be a good scheme to send them to Larry Colby's school,\" was Sam's comment. \"As Larry knows us so well he would probably take an especial interest in our boys.\"  \"Yes. But I wouldn't want him to show our lads any special favors,\" broke in Tom, quickly. \"If the boys went there, I should want them to stand on their own feet, just as we did when we went to Putnam Hall.\"  \"That's the talk, Tom! No favoritism!\" cried Dick. \"The only way to make a boy thoroughly self-reliant is to make him take his own part.\"  \"If we are going to send them off to boarding school, they might as well go this Fall as any other time,\" remarked Sam Rover. \"Have you any idea when the term at Colby Hall begins, Dick?\"  \"About the middle of September.\"  \"It's the middle of August now. That would give us a full month in which to make arrangements and for them in which to get ready.\"  \"Have you ever said anything to the twins about going to boarding school, Tom?\" questioned Sam.  \"Oh, yes. They understand that they are to go to some place sooner or later. Fred understands it, too, doesn't he?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"And I told Jack only a short while ago that he must get ready to think of leaving home,\" put in Dick Rover. \"Of course, it will be rather hard on the boys at first. They have never been away from us at all except the two weeks when they were out in that boys' camp.\"  \"They'll have to get used to it, just as we got used to it when father went off to Africa and Uncle Randy sent us to Putnam Hall. Perhaps we had better tell them----\"  Sam Rover broke off short as a series of shrieks in a high-pitched feminine voice issued from the pantry of the big farmhouse. An instant later a hired girl, followed by a middle-aged cook, came flying forth from the kitchen doorway.  \"Oh, save me! Save me!\" cried the hired girl, clutching her skirts tightly around her ankles, \"Save me!\"  \"Oh, Mr. Rover! Mr. Rover! It's those dreadful boys! I won't stay here another minute!\" screamed the cook, flourishing a big spoon in one hand and a dish-cloth in the other. \"It's outrageous! That's what it is! I'm going to pack my trunk and leave this house right away!\"  \"What's the matter?\" demanded Tom Rover, quickly.  \"Are you hurt?\" came anxiously from Dick.  \"What have the boys done now?\" questioned Sam.  \"What have they done?\" wailed the hired girl. \"I just went into the pantry and opened the closet door and out jumped about a thousand mice at me!\"  \"Yes! and they are running all over the house!\" broke in the cook savagely. \"One of 'em ran right over my foot and tried to bite me! I'm going to pack my trunk and leave! I won't stay here another minute!\"     CHAPTER II  SOMETHING OF THE PAST   At the announcement of the hired girl that their sons had let loose in the farmhouse a thousand mice--more or less--the three Rover brothers looked at each other enquiringly.  \"Another joke--and so soon!\" gasped Sam Rover.  \"That certainly is the limit!\" broke out Dick Rover, as he started for the house.  \"If I find Andy and Randy have been up to another trick right on top of this water-hose nonsense, I'll give them a tanning they won't forget in a hurry,\" added Tom Rover; and then he and Sam followed Dick up the back porch and into the kitchen.  To the readers of the former volumes in these two \"Rover Boys Series,\" Dick, Tom and Sam Rover will need no special introduction. For the benefit of others, however, let me state that the sober-minded and determined Dick was the oldest of the three, with the fun-loving Tom coming next and sturdy Sam being the youngest. They were the sons of one Anderson Rover, who, when not traveling, made his home at Valley Brook Farm, in New York State, living there with his brother Randolph Rover and wife Martha.  While Dick, Tom, and Sam were quite young, and while their father was off exploring in the interior of Africa, the three Rovers had been sent to Putnam Hall Military Academy, where they had made a few enemies and likewise a host of friends, including a manly and straight-forward cadet named"]]]
