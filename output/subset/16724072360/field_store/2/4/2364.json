In an old--a very old--easy-chair at one side of the fire sat a lady rather beyond middle age, with her hands clasped on her lap, and her eyes gazing dreamily at the fire.  Perhaps she was speculating on the question how long two small lumps of coal and a little dross would last. The grate in which that amount of fuel burned was a miniature specimen of simplicity,--a mere hollow in the wall with two bars across.  The fire itself was so small that nothing but constant solicitude saved it from extinction.  There was much of grey mingled with the fair tresses of the lady, and the remains of beauty were very distinct on a countenance, the lines of which suggested suffering, gentleness, submission, and humility. Perchance the little sigh that escaped her as she gazed at the preposterously small fire had reference to days gone by when health revelled in her veins; when wealth was lavished in her father's house; when food and fun were plentiful; when grief and care were scarce. Whatever her thoughts might have been, they were interrupted by the entrance of another lady, who sat down beside her, laid a penny on the table, and looked at the lady in the easy-chair with a peculiar, half-comical expression.  \"It is our _last_, Jessie,\" she said, and as she said it the expression intensified, yet it seemed a little forced.  There needed no magician to tell that these two were sisters.  The indescribable similarity was strong, yet the difference was great. Jessie was evidently, though not much, the elder.  \"It's almost absurd, Kate,\" she said, \"to think that we should actually have--come--at last--to--\"  She stopped, and Kate looked earnestly at her.  There was a tremulous motion about the corners of both their mouths.  Jessie laid her head on Kate's shoulder, and both wept--gently.  They did not \"burst into tears,\" for they were not by nature demonstrative.  Their position made it easy to slide down on their knees and bury their heads side by side in the great old easy-chair that had been carefully kept when all the rest was sold, because it had belonged to their father.  We may not record the scarce audible prayer.  Those who have suffered know what it was.  Those who have not suffered could not understand it. After the prayer they sat down in a somewhat tranquil mood to \"talk it over.\"  Poor things--they had often talked it over, without much result, except that blessed one of evolving mutual sympathy.  \"If I were only a little younger and stronger,\" said Kate, who had been, and still was of a lively disposition, \"I would offer myself as a housemaid, but that is out of the question now; besides, I could not leave you, Jessie, the invalid of the family--that once was.\"  \"Come, Kate, let us have no reference to the invalid of the family any more.  I am getting quite strong.  Do you know I do believe that poverty is doing my health good; my appetite is improving.  I really feel quite hungry now.\"  \"We will have tea, then,\" said Kate, getting up briskly; \"the things that we got will make one good meal, at all events, though the cost of them has reduced our funds to the low ebb of one penny; so, let us enjoy ourselves while it lasts!\"  Kate seized the poker as she spoke, and gave the fire a thrust that almost extinguished it.  Then she heaped on a few ounces of coal with reckless indifference to the future, and put on a little kettle to boil. Soon the small table was spread with a white cloth, a silver teapot, and two beautiful cups that had been allowed them out of the family wreck; a loaf of bread, a very small quantity of brown sugar, a smaller quantity of skim-milk, and the smallest conceivable pat of salt butter.  \"And this took all the money except one penny?\" asked Jessie, regarding the table with a look of mingled sadness and amazement.  \"All--every farthing,\" replied Kate, \"and I consider the result a triumph of domestic economy.\"  The sisters were about to sit down to enjoy their triumph when a bounding step was heard on the stair.  \"That's Ruth,\" exclaimed Kate, rising and hurrying to the door; \"quick, get out the other cup, Jessie.  Oh!  Ruth, darling, this is good of you. We were sure you would come this week, as--\"  She stopped abruptly, for a large presence loomed on the stair behind Ruth.  \"I have brought mamma to see you, Kate--the Misses Seaward, mamma; you have often heard me speak of them.\"  \"Yes, dear, and I have much pleasure in making the Misses Seaward's acquaintance.  My daughter is very fond of you, ladies, I know, and the little puss has brought me here by way of a surprise, I suppose, for we came out to pay a very different kind of visit.  She--\"  \"Oh! but mamma,\" hastily exclaimed Ruth, who saw that her mother, whom she had hitherto kept in ignorance of the circumstances of the poor ladies, was approaching dangerous ground, \"our visit here _has_ to do with--with the people we were speaking about.  I have come,\" she added, turning quickly to Miss Jessie, \"to transact a little business with you--about those poor people, you remember, whom you were so sorry for. Mamma will be glad to hear what we have to say about them.  Won't you, mamma?\"  \"Of course, of course, dear,\" replied Mrs Dotropy, who, however, experienced a slight feeling of annoyance at being thus dragged into a preliminary consideration of the affairs of poor people before paying a personal visit to them.  Being good-natured, however, and kind, she submitted gracefully and took note, while chairs were placed round the table for this amateur Board, that ladies with moderate means--obviously _very_ moderate--appeared to enjoy their afternoon tea quite as much as rich people.  You see, it never entered into Mrs Dotropy's mind--how could it?--that what she imagined to be \"afternoon tea\" was dinner, tea, and supper combined in one meal, beyond which there lay no prospective meal, except what one penny might purchase.  With a mysterious look, and a gleam of delight in her eyes, Ruth drew forth a well-filled purse, the contents of which, in shillings, sixpences, and coppers, she poured out upon the tea-table.  \"There,\" she said triumphantly, \"I have collected all that myself, and I've come to consult you how much of it should be given to each, and how we are to get them to take it.\"  \"How kind of you, Ruth!\" exclaimed Kate and Jessie Seaward, gazing on the coin with intense, almost miserly satisfaction.  \"Nonsense! it's not kind a bit,\" responded Ruth; \"if you knew the pleasure I've had in gathering it, and telling the sad story of the poor people; and then, the thought of the comfort it will bring to them, though it _is_ so little after all.\"  \"It won't appear little in their eyes, Ruth,\" said Kate, \"for you can't think how badly off some of them are.  I assure you when Jessie and I think of it, as we often do, it makes us quite miserable.\"  Poor Misses Seaward!  In their sympathy with the distress of others they had quite forgotten, for the moment, their own extreme poverty.  They had even failed to observe that their own last penny had been inadvertently but hopelessly mingled with the coin which Ruth had so triumphantly showered upon the table.  \"I've got a paper here with the name of each,\" continued the excited girl, \"so that we may divide the money in the proportions you think best.  That, however, will be easy, but I confess I have puzzled my brain in vain to hit on a way to get poor Bella Tilly to accept charity.\"  \"That will be no difficulty,\" said Jessie, \"because we won't offer her charity.  She has been knitting socks for sale lately, so we can buy these.\"  \"Oh! how stupid I am,\" cried Ruth, \"the idea of buying something from her never once occurred to me.  We'll buy all her socks--yes, and put our own price on them too; capital!\"  \"Who is Bella Tilly?\" asked Mrs Dotropy.  \"A young governess,\" replied Jessie, \"whose health has given way.  She is an orphan--has not, I believe, a relative in the whole world--and has been obliged to give up her last situation, not only because of her health, but because she was badly treated.\"  \"But how about poor Mr Garnet the musician?\" resumed Ruth, \"has _he_ anything to sell?\"  \"I think not,\" answered Kate; \"the sweet sounds in which he deals can now be no longer made since the paralytic stroke rendered his left arm powerless.  His flute was the last thing he had to sell, and he did not part with it until hunger compelled him; and even then only after the doctors had told him that recovery was impossible.  But I daresay we shall find some means of overcoming his scruples.  He has relatives, but they are all either poor or heartless, and between the two he is starving.\"  Thus, one by one, the cases of those poor ones were considered until all Ruth's money was apportioned, and Mrs Dotropy had become so much interested, that she added a sovereign to the fund, for the express benefit of Bella Tilly.  Thereafter, Ruth and her mother departed, leaving the list and the pile of money on the table, for the sisters had undertaken to distribute the fund.  Before leaving, however, Ruth placed a letter in Kate's hand, saying that it had reference to an institution which would interest them.  \"Now isn't that nice?\" said Kate, sitting down with a beaming smile, when their visitors had gone, \"so like Ruth.  Ah! if she only knew how much we need a little of that money.  Well, well, we--\"  \"The tea is quite cold,\" interrupted Jessie, \"and the fire has gone out!\"  \"Jessie!\" exclaimed Kate with a sudden look of solemnity--\"the _penny_!\"  Jessie looked blankly at the table, and said--\"Gone!\"  \"No, it is _there_,\" said Kate.  \"Yes, but Ruth, you know, didn't count the money till she came here, and so did not detect the extra penny, and we forgot it.  Every farthing there has been apportioned on that list and must be accounted for.

The child became instantly grave, and she looked up in her father's face with an expression of awe, while he dropped his eyes on the floor.  Poor Alice had never known a mother's love.  Her mother died when she was a few weeks old, and she had been confided to the care of two maiden aunts--excellent ladies, both of them; good beyond expression; correct almost to a fault; but prim, starched, and extremely self-possessed and judicious, so much so that they were injudicious enough to repress some of the best impulses of their natures, under the impression that a certain amount of dignified formality was essential to good breeding and good morals in every relation of life.  Dear, good, starched Misses Dunning! if they had had their way, boys would have played cricket and football with polite urbanity, and girls would have kissed their playmates with gentle solemnity.  They did their best to subdue little Alice, but that was impossible.  The child _would_ rush about the house at all unexpected and often inopportune seasons, like a furiously insane kitten and she _would_ disarrange their collars too violently every evening when she bade them good-night.  Alice was intensely sympathetic.  It was quite enough for her to see any one in tears, to cause her to open up the flood-gates of her eyes and weep--she knew not and she cared not why.  She threw her arms round her father's neck again, and hugged him, while bright tears trickled like diamonds from her eyes.  No diamonds are half so precious or so difficult to obtain as tears of genuine sympathy!  \"How would you like to go with me to the whale-fishery?\" inquired Captain Dunning, somewhat abruptly as he disengaged the child's arms and set her on his knee.  The tears stopped in an instant, as Alice leaped, with the happy facility of childhood, totally out of one idea and thoroughly into another.  \"Oh, I should like it _so_ much!\"  \"And how much is `so' much, Ailie?\" inquired the captain.  Ailie pursed her mouth, and looked at her father earnestly, while she seemed to struggle to give utterance to some fleeting idea.  \"Think,\" she said quickly, \"think something good _as much as ever you can_.  Have you thought?\"  \"Yes,\" answered the captain, smiling.  \"Then,\" continued Ailie, \"its twenty thousand million times as much as that, and a great deal more!\"  The laugh with which Captain Dunning received this curious explanation of how much his little daughter wished to go with him to the whale-fishery, was interrupted by the entrance of his sisters, whose sense of propriety induced them to keep all visitors waiting at least a quarter of an hour before they appeared, lest they should be charged with unbecoming precipitancy.  \"Here you are, lassies; how are ye?\" cried the captain as he rose and kissed each lady on the cheek heartily.  The sisters did not remonstrate.  They knew that their brother was past hope in this respect, and they loved him, so they suffered it meekly.  Having admitted that they were well--as well, at least, as could be expected, considering the cataract of \"trials\" that perpetually descended upon their devoted heads--they sat down as primly as if their visitor were a perfect stranger, and entered into a somewhat lengthened conversation as to the intended voyage, commencing, of course, with the weather.  \"And now,\" said the captain, rubbing the crown of his straw hat in a circular manner, as if it were a beaver, \"I'm coming to the point.\"  Both ladies exclaimed, \"What point, George?\" simultaneously, and regarded the captain with a look of anxious surprise.  \"_The_ point,\" replied the captain, \"about which I've come here to-day. It ain't a point o' the compass; nevertheless, I've been steerin' it in my mind's eye for a considerable time past.  The fact is\" (here the captain hesitated), \"I--I've made up my mind to take my little Alice along with me this voyage.\"  The Misses Dunning wore unusually tall caps, and their countenances were by nature uncommonly long, but the length to which they grew on hearing this announcement was something preternaturally awful.  \"Take Ailie to sea!\" exclaimed Miss Martha Dunning, in horror.  \"To fish for whales!\" added Miss Jane Dunning, in consternation.  \"Brother, you're mad!\" they exclaimed together, after a breathless pause; \"and you'll do nothing of the kind,\" they added firmly.  Now, the manner in which the Misses Dunning received this intelligence greatly relieved their eccentric brother.  He had fully anticipated, and very much dreaded, that they would at once burst into tears, and being a tender-hearted man he knew that he could not resist that without a hard struggle.  A flood of woman's tears, he was wont to say, was the only sort of salt water storm he hadn't the heart to face.  But abrupt opposition was a species of challenge which the captain always accepted at once--off-hand.  No human power could force him to any course of action.  In this latter quality Captain Dunning was neither eccentric nor singular.  \"I'm sorry you don't like my proposal, my dear sisters,\" said he; \"but I'm resolved.\"  \"You won't!\" said Martha.  \"You shan't!\" cried Jane.  \"I _will_!\" replied the captain.  There was a pause here of considerable length, during which the captain observed that Martha's nostrils began to twitch nervously.  Jane, observing the fact, became similarly affected.  To the captain's practised eye these symptoms were as good as a barometer.  He knew that the storm was coming, and took in all sail at once (mentally) to be ready for it.  It came!  Martha and Jane Dunning were for once driven from the shelter of their wonted propriety--they burst simultaneously into tears, and buried their respective faces in their respective pocket-handkerchiefs, which were immaculately clean and had to be hastily unfolded for the purpose.  \"Now, now, my dear girls,\" cried the captain, starting up and patting their shoulders, while poor little Ailie clasped her hands, sat down on a footstool, looked up in their faces--or, rather, at the backs of the hands which covered their faces--and wept quietly.  \"It's very cruel, George--indeed it is,\" sobbed Martha; \"you know how we love her.\"  \"Very true,\" remarked the obdurate captain; \"but you _don't_ know how _I_ love her, and how sad it makes me to see so little of her, and to think that she may be learning to forget me--or, at least,\" added the captain, correcting himself as Ailie looked at him reproachfully through her tears--\"at least to do without me.  I can't bear the thought.  She's all I have left to me, and--\"  \"Brother,\" interrupted Martha, looking hastily up, \"did you ever before hear of such a thing as taking a little girl on a voyage to the whale-fishing?\"  \"No, never,\" replied the captain; \"what has that got to do with it?\"  Both ladies held up their hands and looked aghast.  The idea of any man venturing to do what no one ever thought of doing before was so utterly subversive of all their ideas of propriety--such a desperate piece of profane originality--that they remained speechless.  \"George,\" said Martha, drying her eyes, and speaking in tones of deep solemnity, \"did you ever read _Robinson Crusoe_?\"  \"Yes, I did, when I was a boy; an' that wasn't yesterday.\"  \"And did you,\" continued the lady in the same sepulchral tone, \"did you note how that man--that beacon, if I may use the expression, set up as a warning to deter all wilful boys and men from reckless, and wicked, and wandering, and obstreperous courses--did you note, I say, how that man, that beacon, was shipwrecked, and spent a dreary existence on an uninhabited and dreadful island, in company with a low, dissolute, black, unclothed companion called Friday?\"  \"Yes,\" answered the captain, seeing that she paused for a reply.  \"And all,\" continued Martha, \"in consequence of his resolutely and obstinately, and wilfully and wickedly going to sea?\"  \"Well, it couldn't have happened if he hadn't gone to sea, no doubt.\"  \"Then,\" argued Martha, \"will you, can you, George, contemplate the possibility of your only daughter coming to the same dreadful end?\"  George, not exactly seeing the connection, rubbed his nose with his forefinger, and replied--\"Certainly not.\"  \"Then you are bound,\" continued Martha, in triumph, \"by all that is upright and honourable, by all the laws of humanity and _propriety_, to give up this wild intention--and you _must_!\"  \"There!\" cried Miss Jane emphatically, as if the argument were unanswerable--as indeed it was, being incomprehensible.  The last words were unfortunate.  They merely riveted the captain's determination.  \"You talk a great deal of nonsense, Martha,\" he said, rising to depart. \"I've fixed to take her, so the sooner you make up your minds to it the better.\"  The sisters knew their brother's character too well to waste more time in vain efforts; but Martha took him by the arm, and said earnestly--\"Will you promise me, my dear George, that when she comes back from this voyage, you will never take her on another?\"  \"Yes, dear sister,\" replied the captain, somewhat melted, \"I promise that.\"  Without another word Martha sat down and held out her arms to Ailie, who incontinently rushed into them.  Propriety fled for the nonce, discomfited.  Miss Martha's curls were disarranged beyond repair, and Miss Martha's collar was crushed to such an extent that the very laundress who had washed and starched and ironed it would have utterly failed to recognise it.  Miss Jane looked on at these improprieties in perfect indifference--nay, when, after her sister had had enough, the child was handed over to her, she submitted to the same violent treatment without a murmur.  For once Nature was allowed to have her way, and all three had a good hearty satisfactory cry; in the midst of which Captain Dunning left them, and, proceeding on board his ship, hastened the"]]]
