No, I am inclined to think that it is some inward-bound craft, becalmed like ourselves.  We caught the sound of some order spoken on board her when we first became aware of her presence, and Mr Fortescue here was of opinion that the words used were Spanish, although the distance was too great to enable us to distinguish just what was said.\"  \"Ay,\" responded the skipper; \"two out of every three slavers doing business on this coast are either Spaniards or Portuguese.  Now, the question is, What are we to do with regard to our unknown friend out yonder?  Either she is, or is not, the craft that we are on the look-out for.  If she _is_, we must take her, by hook or by crook, before the sea-breeze sets in and gives her the chance to run away from us; and that means a jaunt in the boats.  On the other hand, if she is not the craft that we are after, she is still in all probability a slaver, and in any case will doubtless pay for an overhaul, which again means a boat trip.  Therefore, Mr Perry, be good enough to have the hands called, and the boats got into the water as silently as possible.  If the men are quick we may be able to get away, and perhaps alongside her, before the dawn breaks.  I will take charge of this little pleasure-party myself, and you can stay here and keep house during my absence.\"  \"Ay, ay, sir,\" answered Perry, in tones which clearly betrayed his disappointment at the arrangement come to by the skipper.  \"I will put matters in hand.\"  \"Yes, do,\" returned the skipper; \"and meanwhile I will go and dress.  It shall be your turn next time, Perry,\" he chuckled, as he turned away to go below again.  \"Ay,\" grumbled the lieutenant to himself, but audibly enough for me to hear.  \"Same old yarn--`your turn next time, Perry.'  This will make the third time running that I have been left behind to `keep house,' but there's not going to be a fourth, I'll see to that; it is time that this child stood up for his rights.  Now, Mr Fortescue, have the goodness, if you please, to pass the word for all hands to arm and man boats; and to be quiet about it, too, and show no lights.\"  \"Ay, ay, sir,\" I briskly responded, as I turned to hurry away; \"I'll see that our lambs don't bleat too loudly.  And--I suppose--that I may take it for granted that--\"  \"That you will make one of the `pleasure-party'?\" interrupted the lieutenant, with a laugh, as he put his disappointment and ill-humour away from him.  \"Oh, yes, I suppose so.  At all events there will be no harm in making your preparations; the captain is pretty certain to take you.\"  Still on my bare feet, I hurried forward and found the boatswain.  \"That you, Mr Futtock?\"  I inquired, as I made out his burly form.  \"Ay, ay, Mr Fortescue, it's me, right enough,\" was the answer.  \"I presoom, sir, it's another boat job, eh?  You heard that bell?\"  \"We did, Mr Futtock; yes, we heard it distinctly, seeing that we don't `caulk' in our watch on deck,\" I retorted.  \"Yes, it's another boat affair; so be good enough to have all hands called at once, if you please.  And kindly make it your personal business to see that nobody raises his voice, lets anything fall, or otherwise creates row enough to wake the dead.  This is going to be a little surprise visit, you understand.\"  \"Ay, ay, Mr Fortescue, I understands,\" answered Futtock, as he moved toward the open hatchway; \"I'll see that the swabs don't make no noise. The man that raises his voice above a whisper won't go.  That's all.\"  \"Just one word more, Mr Futtock,\" I hastily interposed, as the boatswain stepped over the coaming to descend the hatchway.  \"You may do me a favour, if you will.  Kindly ask the armourer to pick me out a nice sharp cutlass, if you please.  You can bring it on deck with you when you come up.\"  To this request the boatswain readily enough assented; and matters being thus far satisfactorily arranged I descended to the cockroach-haunted den wherein we mids. ate and slept, to find that little Tom Copplestone--who shared my watch, and who was a special favourite of mine because of his gentle, genial disposition, and also perhaps because he hailed from the same county as myself--having overheard the conversation between Mr Perry and myself, had already come below and roused the occupants of the place, who, by the smoky rays of a flaring oil lamp that did its best to make the atmosphere quite unendurable, were hastily arraying themselves.  \"Murder!\"  I ejaculated, as I entered the pokey little place and got my first whiff of its close, reeking, smoke-laden atmosphere; \"put out that abominable lamp and light a candle or two, somebody, for pity's sake. How the dickens you fellows can manage to breathe down here I can't understand.  And, boy,\" to the messenger outside, \"pass the word for Cupid to bring us along some cocoa from the galley.\"  \"There's no need,\" remarked Nugent, the master's mate, as he struggled ineffectively to find the left sleeve of his jacket.  \"The word has already been passed; I passed it myself when Master Cock-robin there,\" pointing to Copplestone, \"came and roused us out.  And, as to candles, I'm afraid we haven't any; the rats appear to have eaten the last two we had in the locker.  However--ah, here comes the cocoa.  Put the pot down there, Cupid--never mind if it _does_ soil our beautiful damask table- cloth, we're going to have it washed next time we go into Sierra Leone. And just see if you can find us a biscuit or two and some butter, will ye, you black angel?  Here, avast there,\"--as the black was about to retire--\"produce our best china breakfast-set before you go, you swab, and pour out the cocoa.\"  The black, a herculean Krooboy, picked up when we first arrived on the Coast, and promptly christened \"Cupid\" by the master's mate, who, possibly because of sundry disappointments, had developed a somewhat sardonic turn of humour, grinned appreciatively at Nugent's sorry jest respecting \"our best china breakfast-set,\" and proceeded to rout out the heterogeneous assortment of delf and tin cups, basins, and plates that constituted the table-equipage of the midshipmen's berth, poured out a generous allowance of cocoa for each of us, and then departed, with the empty bread-barge, in quest of a supply of ship's biscuit.  By the time that Cupid returned with this, we had gulped down our cocoa and were ready to go on deck.  I therefore helped myself to a couple of biscuits which, breaking into pieces of convenient size by the simple process of dashing them against my elbow, I crammed into my jacket pocket, and then rushed up the ladder to the deck, leaving my companions to follow after they had snatched a hasty bite or two of food; for there was now no knowing when we might get breakfast.  Upon my arrival on deck I found the hands already mustering under the supervision of the first lieutenant, and a moment later I encountered the boatswain, who handed over to me a good serviceable ship's cutlass-- worth a dozen of the ridiculous little dirks which were considered suitable weapons for midshipmen--which I promptly girded about my waist. At this moment all was bustle and animation throughout the ship, yet so sedulously had we been trained to act in perfect silence that I am certain the stealthy footfalls of the men hurrying to their stations, and the whispered words of command, were quite inaudible at a distance of twenty yards from the ship.  Within a minute or two, however, even these faint sounds had subsided, the crew were all mustered, and the first lieutenant, assisted by a quartermaster who carried a carefully masked lantern, was carefully, yet rapidly, inspecting each man's weapons and equipment, scrutinising the flints in the locks of the pistols, and otherwise satisfying himself of the efficiency of our hurried preparations.  While the inspection was still in progress the captain came on deck, with his sword girded to his side and a brace of pistols thrust into his belt, and stood quietly looking on until the inspection was completed and Mr Perry had reported that everything was in order.  Then the skipper announced that he would personally lead the attack in his own gig, manned by eight oarsmen, a coxswain, and a midshipman-- myself; while the first cutter, manned by sixteen oarsmen, a coxswain, and a midshipman--Jack Keene--was to be commanded by Mr Purchase, the second lieutenant; and the second cutter, with twelve oarsmen, a coxswain, and Nugent, the master's mate, was to be under the command of the boatswain.  Thus the attacking party was to consist of forty-five persons, all told, which was as many, I suppose, as the skipper felt justified in taking out of the ship under the circumstances.  Then ensued a busy five minutes, during which the boats were being noiselessly lowered and manned, the oars muffled, and every possible precaution observed to enable us to take our unseen but doubtless vigilant enemy unawares.  This was just then regarded as of especial importance, for at the time of which I am now writing the traffic in slaves was regarded as piracy, and rendered its perpetrators liable to capital punishment, in consequence of which almost every slaver went heavily armed, and her crew, knowing that the halter was already about their necks, resisted capture by every means which their ingenuity could devise, whenever they had the chance, and often fought with desperate valour.  As I hurried aft to attend to the lowering of the gig, which hung from davits over the stern, a hand was suddenly laid upon my arm, and, turning, I found myself confronted by Cupid, the Krooboy servant who \"did for us\" in the midshipmen's berth.  His eyes were aglow with excitement, he carried a short-handled hatchet, with a head somewhat bigger and heavier than that of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21070"],["title","A Middy of the Slave Squadron: A West African Story (#2)"],["body"," ship's tomahawk, in his hand, and he was naked, save for a pair of dungaree trousers, the legs of which were rolled up above his knees.  \"Mr Fortescue, sar, I fit for go in dem boat wid you, sar,\" he whispered eagerly.  \"Yes, I quite believe it, Cupid,\" I replied.  \"But you know perfectly well that I cannot give you permission to join the gig's crew.  If the captain had been anxious to have the pleasure of your company I feel sure that he would have mentioned the fact.  Besides, if you should happen to be killed, what would become of us poor midshipmen?\"  A suppressed chuckle, and a gleam of white teeth through the darkness, betrayed Cupid's appreciation of the compliment subtly conveyed in the suggestion that the budding admirals inhabiting the midshipmen's berth aboard H.M.S.  _Psyche_ would suffer, should he unhappily be slain in the impending conflict, but he hastened to reassure me.  \"No fear, sar,\" he whispered.  \"Dem slaber no lib for kill me.  I, Cupid, too much plenty black for see in de dark; an' if dey no see me, dey no kill.  Savvey?  _Please_, Mr Fortescue, sar.  I no lib for fight too much plenty long time.\"  \"Look here, Cupid,\" I replied.  \"It is no use for you to ask me for permission to go in the gig, for I cannot give it you.  But,\"-- meaningly--\"if you were to stow yourself away in the eyes of the gig it is just possible that the captain might not notice you until we had got too far from the ship to turn back.  Only don't let me see you doing it, that's all.\"  \"Dat all right, sar,\" answered the black, with a sigh of extreme content.  \"If you no look for dem Cupid you no see um.\"  And he turned and ostentatiously walked away forward.  The boats having been gently and carefully lowered into the water without a splash, or so much as a single tell-tale squeak from the tackle-blocks--the pins and bushes of which were habitually overhauled at frequent intervals and kept well lubricated with a mixture of melted tallow and plumbago--the crews took their places, each man carefully depositing his drawn cutlass on the bottom-boards between his feet, and we shoved off with muffled oars, the three boats pulling abreast, with about a ship's length between each; so that if perchance we should happen to be seen, we should present as small a target as possible to aim at.  We pulled slowly and with the utmost caution, for the twofold reason that we had not yet caught sight of our quarry and only knew in a general sort of way that she was somewhere to seaward of us, and because we were anxious to avoid premature discovery from the splash of our oars.  It was of course perfectly right and proper that we should observe all the precautions that I have indicated; for if we could but contrive to creep up alongside the stranger without being detected, it would undoubtedly mean the prevention of much loss of life.  But, personally, I had very little hope of our being able to do so; for the night was so breathlessly still that, if any sort of look-out at all were being kept aboard the stranger--and slavers usually slept with one eye open--they must surely have caught some hint of our proximity, careful as we had been to maintain as complete silence as possible while making our preparations.  Besides, as ill-luck would have it, the water was in an unusually brilliant phosphorescent condition just then, the slightest disturbance of it caused a silvery glow that could be seen a mile away; and, be as silent as we might, the dip of our oars and the passage of the boats through the water set up such a blaze as could not fail to betray us, should a man happen to glance in our direction.  At length, when we had pulled about half a mile, as nearly as I could judge, I detected a slight suspicion of a softening in the velvety blackness of the sky in the eastern quarter.  It brightened, even as I looked, and a solitary star, low down in the sky, seemed to flicker, faintly and more faintly, for half a dozen seconds, and then disappear.  \"The dawn is coming, sir,\" I whispered to the skipper, by whose side I was sitting, \"and in another minute or two we ought to--ah! there she is.  Do you see her, sir?\"  And I pointed in the direction of a faint, ghostlike blotch that had suddenly appeared at a spot some three points on our port bow.  \"Where away?\" demanded the skipper, instinctively raising his hand to shade his eyes; but he had scarcely lifted it to the height of his shoulder when he too caught sight of the object.  \"Ay,\" he exclaimed, \"I see her.  And a big craft she is, too; a barque, apparently.  Surely that cannot be the craft that we are after?  Yet it looks very like her.  If so, she must have slipped out of the river with the last of the land-breeze last night, and lain becalmed all night where she is.  Now what are the other boats about that they have not seen her?  Parkinson,\" to the coxswain, \"show that lantern for a moment to the other boats, but take care to shield it with--ah! never mind, there are both their lights.  Give way, men.  Put me alongside under her mizen chains, my lad.  Either side; I don't care which.\"  While the captain had been speaking the faint, ghostly glimmer that I had detected had resolved itself into the spectral semblance of a large ship clothed from her trucks down with canvas upon which the rapidly growing light of the advancing dawn was falling and thus rendering it just barely visible against its dark background of sky.  In the tropics day comes and goes with a rush, and, even while the skipper had been speaking, the object which had first revealed itself to me, a minute earlier, as a mere wan, ghostly suggestion had assumed solidity and definiteness of form, and now stood out against the sky behind her as a full-rigged ship of some seven hundred and fifty tons burthen, her hull painted bright green, and coppered to the water-line. She was lying stern-on to us, and sat deep in the water, from which latter fact one inferred that she had her cargo of slaves on board and had doubtless, as the skipper conjectured, come out of the river with the last of the land-breeze during the previous night, and had remained becalmed near us, and, we hoped, quite unaware of our proximity all night.  She was now within a cable's length of the boats, but, lying as she was, dead stern-on to us, we in the gig were unable to see how many guns she carried, which was, however, an advantage to us, since, however many guns she might mount on her broadsides, she could bring none of them to bear upon us.  We saw, however, that she carried two stern- chasers--long nine's, apparently--and now, in the hope of dashing alongside before those two guns could be cast loose and brought to bear upon us, the captain stood up in the stern-sheets of the gig and waved his arm to the other boats as a signal to them to give way--for, with the coming of the daylight we could not possibly hope to remain undiscovered above a second or two longer.  Indeed the boats' crews had scarcely bent their backs in response to the signal when there arose a sudden startled outcry on board the ship, followed by a volley of hurried commands and the hasty trampling of feet upon her decks.  But we were so close to her, when discovered, and the surprise was so complete, that her crew had no time to do anything effective in the way of defence; and in little over a couple of minutes we had swept up alongside, clambered in over her lofty bulwarks, driven her crew below, and were in full possession of the _Dona Isabella_ of Havana, mounting twelve guns, with a crew of forty-six Spaniards, Portuguese, and half-castes, constituting as ruffianly a lot as I had ever met with.  She had a cargo of seven hundred and forty negroes on board, and was far and away the finest prize that had thus far fallen to the lot of the _Psyche_.  So valuable, indeed, was she that Captain Harrison decided not to trust her entirely to a prize crew, but to escort her to Sierra Leone in the corvette; and some two hours later, having meanwhile made all the necessary dispositions, the two craft trimmed sail with the first of the sea-breeze and hauled up for Sierra Leone, where we arrived a week later after an uneventful passage.    CHAPTER TWO.  IN THE FERNAN VAZ RIVER.  While we were awaiting the formal condemnation of the _Dona Isabella_ by the Mixed Commission, and the trial of her crew upon the charge of piracy, Captain Harrison, our skipper, busily employed himself, as was his wont, in hunting up information relative to the movements, present and prospective, of the slavers upon the coast.  And this was not quite so difficult to do as might at first be imagined; for, Sierra Leone being the headquarters, so to speak, of the British Slave Squadron, the persons actually engaged in the slave-trade found that it paid them well to maintain agents there for the sole purpose of picking up every possible item of information relative to the movements and doings of that squadron.  For it not unfrequently happened that, to those behind the scenes, an apparently trivial and seemingly quite worthless bit of information, an imprudent word dropped by an unwary officer respecting one of our vessels, enabled the acute ones to calculate so closely that they often succeeded in making a dash into some river, shipping a cargo of slaves, and getting clear away to sea again only a few hours before our cruisers put in an appearance on the spot.  And in the same way our own officers, by frequenting, in disguise, the haunts of the slavers and their agents, very often succeeded in catching a hint that, carefully followed up, led to most important captures being made.  It was, indeed, through a hint so acquired that we had been put upon the track of the _Dona Isabella_.  Now, our own skipper, Captain Harrison, was particularly keen upon this sort of work, and was exceptionally well qualified to achieve success in it.  For, in the first place, he was a West Indian by birth, being the son of a Trinidad sugar-pla"]]]
