Two days ago he investigated my razor,--it is now equal to a cross-cut saw; and as to my drawers and papers, excepting those which I lock up, there is but one word which fully describes the result of his investigations, and that is--chaos.\"  There was, in truth, some ground for that father's emotions, for Master Robin displayed investigative, not to say destructive, capacities far in advance of his years.  \"Never mind, George,\" said Mrs Wright soothingly, \"we must put up with his little ways as best we may, consoling ourselves with the reflection that Robin has genius and perseverance, with which qualities he is sure to make his way in the world.\"  \"He has at all events made his way up the telegraph-post,\" said Mr Wright, his smile expanding and the grimness of it departing; \"see! the rascal is actually stretching out his hand to grasp one of the wires. Ha! hallo!\"  The composed wife became suddenly discomposed, and gave vent to a scream, for at that moment the small black object which they had been watching with so much interest was seen to fall backward, make a wild grasp at nothing with both hands, and fall promptly to the ground.  His father threw up the window, leaped out, dashed across the four-feet-wide lawn, cleared the winding rivulet, and cut, like a hunted hare, over the smiling landscape towards the telegraph-post, at the foot of which he picked up his unconscious though not much injured son.  \"What made you climb the post, Robin?\" asked his cousin Madge that evening as she nursed the adventurous boy on her knee--and Madge was a very motherly nurse, although a full year younger than Robin.  \"I kimed it to see if I could hear the 'trissity,\" replied the injured one.  \"The lek-trissity,\" said Madge, correcting.  \"You must learn to p'onounce your words popperly, dear.  You'll never be a great man if you are so careless.\"  \"I don't want to be a g'eat man,\" retorted Robin.  \"I on'y want t'understand things whats puzzlesum.\"  \"Well, does the telegraph puzzle you?\"  \"Oh! mos' awfully,\" returned Robin, with a solemn gaze of his earnest eyes, one of which was rendered fantastic by a yellow-green ring round it and a swelling underneath.  \"I's kite sure I's stood for hours beside dat post listin' to it hummin' an hummin' like our olianarp--\"  \"Now, Robin, _do_ be careful.  You know mamma calls it an olian _harp_.\"  \"Yes, well, like our olian _h_arp, only a deal louder, an' far nicer. An' I's often said to myself, Is that the 'trissity--?\"  \"Lek, Robin, lek!\"  \"Well, yes, _lek_-trissity.  So I thought I'd kime up an' see, for, you know, papa says the 'trissity--lek, I mean--runs along the wires--\"  \"But papa also says,\" interrupted Madge, \"that the sounds you want to know about are made by the vi--the vi--\"  \"Bratin',\" suggested the invalid.  \"Yes, vibratin' of the wires.\"  \"I wonder what vi-bratin' means,\" murmured Robin, turning his lustrous though damaged eyes meditatively on the landscape.  \"Don'no for sure,\" said Madge, \"but I think it means tremblin'.\"  It will be seen from the above conversation that Robert Wright and his precocious cousin Marjory were of a decidedly philosophical turn of mind.    CHAPTER FOUR.  EXTRAORDINARY RESULT OF AN ATTEMPT AT AMATEUR CABLE-LAYING.  Time continued to roll additional years off his reel, and rolled out Robin and Madge in length and breadth, though we cannot say much for thickness.  Time also developed their minds, and Robin gradually began to understand a little more of the nature of that subtle fluid--if we may venture so to call it--under the influence of which he had been born.  \"Come, Madge,\" he said one day, throwing on his cap, \"let us go and play at cables.\"  Madge, ever ready to play at anything, put on her sun-bonnet and followed her ambitious leader.  \"Is it to be land-telegraphs to-day, or submarine cables?\" inquired Madge, with as much gravity and earnestness as if the world's welfare depended on the decision.  \"Cables, of course,\" answered Robin, \"why, Madge, I have done with land-telegraphs now.  There's nothing more to learn about them.  Cousin Sam has put me up to everything, you know.  Besides, there's no mystery about land-lines.  Why, you've only got to stick up a lot o' posts with insulators screwed to 'em, fix wires to the insulators, clap on an electric battery and a telegraph instrument, and fire away.\"  \"Robin, what _are_ insulators?\" asked Madge, with a puzzled look.  \"Madge,\" replied Robin, with a self-satisfied expression on his pert face, \"this is the three-hundred-thousandth time I have explained that to you.\"  \"Explain it the three-hundred-thousand-and-first time, then, dear Robin, and perhaps I'll take it in.\"  \"Well,\" began Robin, with a hypocritical sigh of despair, \"you must know that everything in nature is more or less a conductor of electricity, but some things conduct it so well--such as copper and iron--that they are called _conductors_, and some things--such as glass and earthenware--conduct it so _very_ badly that they scarcely conduct it at all, and are called _non-conductors_.  D'ee see?\"  \"Oh yes, I see, Robin; so does a bat, but he doesn't see well.  However, go on.\"  \"Well, if I were to run my wire through the posts that support it, my electricity would escape down these posts into the earth, especially if the posts were wet with rain, for water is a good conductor, and Mister Electricity has an irresistible desire to bolt into the earth, like a mole.\"  \"Naughty fellow!\" murmured Madge.  \"But,\" continued Robin impressively, \"if I fix little lumps of glass with a hole in them to the posts, and fix my wires to these, Electricity cannot bolt, because the glass lumps are non-conductors, and won't let him pass.\"  \"How good of them!\" said Madge.  \"Yes, isn't it?  So, you see,\" continued Robin, \"the glass lumps are insulators, for they cut the electricity off from the earth as an island is, or, at all events, appears to be, cut off from it by water; and Mister Electricity _must_ go along the wires and do what I tell him.  Of course, you know, I must make my electricity first in a battery, which, as I have often and often told you, is a trough containing a mixture of acid and water, with plates or slices of zinc and copper in it, placed one after the other, but not touching each other.  Now, if I fix a piece of wire to my first copper slice or plate, and the other end of it to my last zinc slice or plate, immediately electricity will begin to be made, and will fly from the copper to the zinc, and so round and round until the plates are worn out or the wire broken.  D'ee see?\"  \"No, Robin, I don't see; I'm blinder than the blindest mole.\"  \"Oh, Madge, what a wonderful mind you must have!\" said Robin, laughing. \"It is _so_ simple.\"  \"Of course,\" said Madge, \"I understand what you mean by troughs and plates and all that, but what I want to know is _why_ that arrangement is necessary.  Why would it not do just as well to tempt electricity out of its hiding-hole with plates or slices of cheese and bread, placed one after the other in a trough filled with a mixture of glue and melted butter?\"  \"What stuff you do talk, Madge!  As well might you ask why it would not do to make a plum-pudding out of nutmegs and coal-tar.  There are some things that no fellow can understand, and of course I don't know _everything_!\"  The astounding modesty of this latter remark seemed to have furnished Madge with food for reflection, for she did not reply to it.  After a few minutes' walk the amateur electricians reached the scene of their intended game--a sequestered dell in a plantation, through which brawled a rather turbulent stream.  At one part, where a willow overhung the water, there was a deep broad pool.  The stream entered the pool with a headlong plunge, and issued from it with a riotous upheaval of wavelets and foam among jagged rocks, as if rejoicing in, and rather boastful about, the previous leap.  The game was extremely simple.  The pool was to be the German Ocean, and a piece of stout cord was to serve as a submarine cable.  The boy and girl were well-matched playmates, for Madge was ignorant and receptive--in reference to science,--Robin learned and communicative, while both were intensely earnest.  \"Now, this is the battery,\" said Robin, when he had dug a deep hole close to the pool with a spade brought for the purpose.  \"Yes, and the muddy water in it will do for the mixture of acid and water,\" said Madge.  As she spoke, Robin's toe caught on a root, and he went headlong into the battery, out of which he emerged scarcely recognisable.  It was a severe, though not an electric, shock, and at first Robin seemed inclined to whimper, but his manhood triumphed, and he burst into a compound laugh and yell, to the intense relief of Madge, who thought at first that he had been seriously injured.  \"Never mind, Madge,\" said Robin, as he cleansed his muddy head; \"cousin Sam has often told me that nothing great was ever done except in the face of difficulties and dangers.  I wonder whether this should be counted a difficulty or a danger?\"  \"At first I thought it a danger,\" said Madge, with a laugh, \"but the trouble you now have with the mud in your hair looks like a difficulty, doesn't it?\"  \"Why, then, it's both,\" cried Robin.  \"Come, that's a good beginning. Now, Madge, you get away round to the opposite side of the pool, and mind you don't slip in, it's rather steep there.\"  \"This is England,\" cried Robin, preparing to throw the line over to his assistant, who stood eager to aid on the other side, \"and you are standing on--on--"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21717"],["title","Battles with the Sea (#1)"],["body","it would be far greater if we had no lifeboats and no life-saving rockets it will be our duty by-and-by to show.  The black spots on the Wreck Chart to which we have referred show at a single glance that the distribution of wrecks is very unequal--naturally so.  Near the great seaports we find them thickly strewn; at other places, where vessels pass in great numbers on their way to these ports, the spots are also very numerous, while on unfrequented parts they are found only here and there in little groups of two, three, or four.  Away on the nor'-west shores of Scotland, for instance, where the seal and the sea-mew have the ocean and rugged cliffs pretty much to themselves, the plague-spots are few and far between; but on the east coast we find a fair sprinkling of them, especially in the mouths of the Forth and Tay, whither a goodly portion of the world's shipping crowds, and to which the hardy Norseman now sends many a load of timber--both log and batten--instead of coming, as he did of old, to batten on the land.  It is much the same with Ireland, its more important seaports being on the east.  But there is a great and sudden increase of the spots when we come to England.  They commence at the border, on the west, where vessels from and to the busy Clyde enter or quit the Irish Sea.  Darkening the fringes of the land on both sides, and clustering round the Isle of Man, they multiply until the ports have no room to hold them, and, as at Liverpool, they are crowded out into the sea.  From the deadly shores of Anglesea, where the Royal Charter went down in the great and memorable storm of November, 1859, the signs of wreck and disaster thicken as we go south until we reach the Bristol Channel, which appears to be choked with them, and the dangerous cliffs of Cornwall, which receive the ill-fated vessels of the fleets that are perpetually leaving or entering the two great channels.  But it is on the east coast of England that the greatest damage is done.  From Berwick to the Thames the black spots cluster like bees.  On the coasts of Norfolk and Suffolk, off Great Yarmouth, where lie the dangerous Haisborough Sands, the spots are no longer in scattered groups, but range themselves in dense battalions; and further south, off the coast of Kent, round which the world's commerce flows unceasingly into the giant metropolis, where the famous Goodwin Sands play their deadly part in the great war, the dismal spots are seen to cluster densely, like gnats in a summer sky.  Now, just where the black spots are thickest on this wreck chart, lifeboats and rocket apparatus have been stationed in greatest numbers. As in ordinary warfare, so in battles with the sea, our \"Storm Warriors\" [See an admirable book, with this title, written by the Reverend John Gilmore, of Ramsgate.  (Macmillan and Company)] are thrown forward in force where the enemy's assaults are most frequent and dangerous.  Hence we find the eastern shores of England crowded at every point with life-saving apparatus, while most of the other dangerous parts of the coast are pretty well guarded.  Where and how do our coast heroes fight?  I answer--sometimes on the cliffs, sometimes on the sands, sometimes on the sea, and sometimes even on the pierheads.  Their operations are varied by circumstances.  Let us draw nearer and look at them while in action, and observe how the enemy assails them.  I shall confine myself at present to a skirmish.  When the storm-fiend is abroad; when dark clouds lower; when blinding rain or sleet drives before the angry gale, and muttering thunder comes rolling over the sea, men with hard hands and weather-beaten faces, clad in oilskin coats and sou'-westers, saunter down to our quays and headlands all round the kingdom.  These are the lifeboat crews and rocket brigades.  They are on the lookout.  The enemy is moving, and the sentinels are being posted for the night--or rather, they are posting themselves, for nearly all the fighting men in this war are volunteers!  They require no drilling to prepare them for the field; no bugle or drum to sound the charge.  Their drum is the rattling thunder; their trumpet the roaring storm.  They began to train for this warfare when they were not so tall as their fathers' boots, and there are no awkward squads among them now.  Their organisation is rough-and-ready, like themselves, and simple too.  The heavens call them to action; the coxswain grasps the helm, the oars are manned, the word is given, and the rest is straightforward fighting--over everything, through everything, in the teeth of everything, until the victory is gained, and rescued men, women, and children are landed in safety on the shore.  Of course they do not always succeed, but they seldom or never fail to do the very uttermost that it is in the power of strong and daring men to accomplish.  Frequently they can tell of defeat and victory on the same battlefield.  So it was on one fearful winter night at the mouth of the Tyne in the year 1867.  The gale that night was furious.  It suddenly chopped round to the South South East, and, as if the change had recruited its energies, it blew a perfect hurricane between midnight and two in the morning, accompanied by blinding showers of sleet and hail, which seemed to cut like a knife.  The sea was rising mountains high.  About midnight, when the storm was gathering force and the sentinels were scarcely able to keep a lookout, a preventive officer saw a vessel driving ashore to the south of the South Pier.  Instantly he burnt a blue light, at which signal three guns were fired from the Spanish Battery to call out the Life Brigade.  The men were on the alert.  About twenty members of the brigade assembled almost immediately on the pier, where they found that the preventive officer and pier-policeman had already got out the life-saving apparatus; but the gale was so fierce that they had been forced to crawl on their hands and knees to do so.  A few minutes more and the number of brigade men increased to between fifty and sixty.  Soon they saw, through the hurtling storm, that several vessels were driving on shore.  Before long, four ships, with their sails blown to ribbons, were grinding themselves to powder, and crashing against each other and the pier-sides in a most fearful manner. They were the Mary Mac, the Cora, and the Maghee, belonging to Whitstable, and the Lucern of Blyth.  Several lifeboats were stationed at that point.  They were all launched, manned, and promptly pulled into the Narrows, but the force of the hurricane and seas were such that they could not make headway against them.  The powers of man are limited.  When there is a will there is not always a way!  For two hours did these brave men strain at the tough oars in vain; then they unwillingly put about and returned, utterly exhausted, leaving it to the men with the life-lines on shore to do the fighting.  Thus, frequently, when one arm of the service is prevented from acting; the other arm comes into play.  The work of the men engaged on the pier was perilous and difficult, for the lines had to be fired against a head wind.  The piers were covered with ice, and the gale was so strong that the men could hardly stand, while the crews of the wrecks were so benumbed that they could make little effort to help themselves.  The men of the Mary Mac, however, made a vigorous effort to get their longboat out.  A boy jumped in to steady it.  Before the men could follow, the boat was stove in, the rope that held it broke, and it drove away with the poor lad in it.  He was quickly washed out, but held on to the gunwale until it drifted into broken water, when he was swallowed by the raging sea and the boat was dashed to pieces.  Meanwhile the crew of the Cora managed to swing themselves ashore, their vessel being close to the pier.  The crew of the Lucern, acting on the advice of the brigade men, succeeded in scrambling on board the Cora and were hauled ashore on the life-lines.  They had not been ten minutes out of their vessel when she turned over with her decks towards the terrible sea, which literally tore her asunder, and pitched her up, stem on end, as if she had been a toy.  The crew of the Maghee were in like manner hauled on to the pier, with the exception of one lad from Canterbury. It was the poor boy's first voyage.  Little did he think probably, while dreaming of the adventures of a sailor's career, what a terrible fate awaited him.  He was apparently paralysed with fear, and could not spring after his comrades to the pier, but took to the rigging.  He had scarcely done so when the vessel heeled over, and he was swung two or three times backwards and forwards with the motion of the masts.  It is impossible to imagine the feelings of the brave men on the pier, who would so gladly have risked their lives to save him--he was so near, and yet so hopelessly beyond the reach of human aid!  In a very brief space of time the waves did their work--ship and boy were swallowed up together.  While these events were enacting on the pier the Mary Mac had drifted over the sand about half a mile from where she had struck.  One of her crew threw a leadline towards a seaman on the shore.  The hero plunged into the surf and caught it.  The rest of the work was easy.  By means of the line the men of the Life Brigade sent off their hawser, and breeches-buoy or cradle (which apparatus I shall hereafter explain), and drew the crew in safety to the land.  That same morning a Whitby brig struck on the sands.  The lifeboat Pomfret, belonging to the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, put out and rescued her crew.  In the morning the shores were strewn with wreckage, and amongst it was found the body of the boy belonging to the Mary Mac.  All these disasters were caused by the masters of the vessels mistaking the south for the north pier, in consequence of having lost sight of Tynemouth light in the blinding showers.
