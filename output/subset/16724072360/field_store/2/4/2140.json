You aren't afraid of getting your feet wet, are you?\" And he laughed loudly at his own joke.  For some reason Timothy lost his temper. Perhaps he thought Mr. Crow was disrespectful to his elders.  \"Look here, young man!\" he snapped, glaring angrily at old Mr. Crow. \"If you're laughing at me, I'll invite you to drop down here and stand on the end of my nose.\"  Old Mr. Crow grew sober at once. The mere thought of perching himself in so dangerous a place was enough to put a quick end to his noisy _haw-haws_.  \"My dear sir!\" he cried. \"I wouldn't _dream_ of standing on the nose of a fine old gentleman like you. No indeedy! My manners are too good for that.\"  Timothy Turtle said bluntly that he had always been told that Mr. Crow was the rudest person in all Pleasant Valley--unless it was Mr. Crow's boisterous cousin, Jasper Jay.  When he heard that, Mr. Crow pretended to wipe a tear away from each of his eyes.  \"I've always been misunderstood,\" he declared mournfully. \"I'm really a kind-hearted soul. And just to prove to you that I want to be helpful, I'll meet you at the bluff any time you say, and tell you exactly what to do if you want to learn to fly.\"  Timothy Turtle seemed to think that the chance was too good a one to lose.  \"I accept your offer,\" he shouted. \"And I'll start downstream this very moment.\"     VII  LEARNING TO FLY   Timothy Turtle reached the overhanging bluff in a surprisingly short time. But it must be remembered that he did not walk there on land, but swam down Black Creek with the current. When he crawled out upon the bank he was glad to see that old Mr. Crow was waiting for him, on a pine stump that stood near the water.  He failed utterly to notice that Mr. Crow was not alone. Hidden in all sorts of places were as many as a dozen of Mr. Crow's friends. For the old gentleman had invited his cousin, Jasper Jay, to come to the bluff \"to enjoy the fun,\" as he expressed it.  \"But don't let Timothy Turtle see you!\" Mr. Crow had warned Jasper. \"At least, don't let him know you're there until after he has jumped off the big rock.\"  Jasper Jay had given his solemn promise.  \"And don't let him hear you, either,\" Mr. Crow had said. And Jasper had agreed to that, too, although he said that it might be a hard thing to do.  Well, Timothy Turtle crawled out upon the bank and took a long look at the high bluff above him, from which the great rock hung over the water of the creek.  \"I believe----\" he said to old Mr. Crow--\"I believe I'd better wait till to-morrow before I try to fly. I've just had a long swim, you know. And I want to feel fresh when I take my first lesson.\"  \"Nonsense!\" Mr. Crow exclaimed. \"Everything's all ready. You're not too tired, are you, to climb to the top of the bluff?\"  \"No,\" Timothy Turtle admitted.  \"Then you've no reason for waiting,\" Mr. Crow assured him. \"Coming down will be much easier than going up.\"  \"I dare say that's true,\" Timothy remarked. \"But I don't quite like to think about this business of flying.\"  \"Then you certainly ought not to wait any longer,\" Mr. Crow urged him. \"For the longer you wait the more time you'll have to think.\"  That appeared to Timothy Turtle to be a good bit of advice. And yet he still seemed uneasy.  \"There's just one thing that troubles me,\" he confessed. \"After I've jumped from the rock I might find that I couldn't fly. And I'd get a bad fall.\"  \"But you'd land in the water,\" Mr. Crow reminded him. \"And that would be much better than falling on the land.... I don't need to tell you,\" he added, \"that water is soft. And you're a fine swimmer.\"  So Timothy Turtle yielded. And thereupon he began to drag himself up the steep bluff.  It seemed to Mr. Crow that he had never known anybody to walk so slowly. But then, of course, he was in a hurry to see the fun. And it couldn't really begin until Mr. Turtle should reach the big rock and take the leap that Mr. Crow had suggested to him.  Jasper Jay and the rowdies he had brought with him stirred impatiently. And Jasper said aloud to one of them:  \"What an old slow-poke he is!\"  \"What's that!\" Timothy Turtle inquired, as he stopped and looked around at Mr. Crow.  \"I didn't speak,\" Mr. Crow told him.  Timothy glared at his teacher for a few moments. And Mr. Crow began to think that Jasper Jay had spoiled the fun. But at last Timothy Turtle plodded on. And when his back was turned old Mr. Crow flew over to the place where Jasper Jay was hidden and whispered to him that he had better keep still or there would be trouble for him.     VIII  TURNING TURTLE   So Timothy Turtle struggled up the steep face of the bluff. And as he neared the top Mr. Crow began to hop up and down upon the old pine stump. He was almost bursting with silent laughter. But he succeeded in keeping quiet. And now and then he made threatening motions toward Jasper Jay and his friends, who stuck their heads from behind limbs of trees and hummocks and bushes, lest they miss any of the fun.  Once on top of the great rock that capped the bluff and hung out over the creek, Timothy Turtle clung there and peered down at the gently flowing water below.  \"What a long way it is down there!\" he called to Mr. Crow.  \"Don't think about that!\" Mr. Crow cautioned him.  \"Is this the way Mr. Alligator learned to fly?\" Timothy Turtle demanded.  \"Don't think about him!\" Mr. Crow shouted. \"Just jump out as far as you can!\"  \"I believe I don't care to fly to-day,\" Timothy Turtle faltered, drawing back from the edge of the rock. \"I----I'll wait till some other time. You know, I'm older than you are.\"  \"Tut, tut!\" said Mr. Crow. \"When I'm your age I shall still be flying as well as I do now. It's nothing, when you know how. Nothing at all!\"  Urged by Mr. Crow, Timothy Turtle once more crept to the very edge of the cliff and stretched his neck out as far as he could, to gaze down at the black water. And at last, after making several false starts and drawing back to a place of safety, he stood up on his hind legs, shut his eyes, and hopped off into space.  Now, the moment Timothy Turtle leaped from the top of the bluff a deafening squawk broke the silence. Old Mr. Crow _cawed_ as loud as he knew how. But the racket he made was as nothing compared with the uproar of Jasper Jay and the noisy crew he had brought with him. They squalled with delight as Timothy Turtle plunged through the air like a stone. And when he landed upside down in the creek, striking the water with a great splash, the whole company shrieked louder than ever.  \"_Ha! ha! ha_!\" Mr. Crow cried, holding his sides and rocking backwards and forwards upon the old stump.  \"_Jay_! _jay_! _jay_!\" Jasper and his friends bawled, hopping up and down and cutting capers in the air.  As for Timothy Turtle, he made no sound at all. And neither did he make the slightest motion. The current of Black Creek caught him and bore him away down the stream. But at last he managed to paddle ashore. And he pulled himself slowly out of the water, and lay upon the sand and groaned.  Mr. Crow and his cronies gathered quickly about him.  \"What's the matter?\" Mr. Crow inquired. \"Don't you like flying?\"  It was some time before Timothy could answer.  \"I've had an awful fall,\" he moaned finally.  \"Where are you hurt?\" Mr. Crow asked him.  \"Everywhere!\" Timothy Turtle told him. \"I thought you said that water was soft to fall into.\"  \"Well, isn't it?\"  \"It certainly is _not,_\" Timothy Turtle declared. \"I believe there's nothing harder in the whole world.... I've heard, sir, that you are very wise. But for once, anyhow, you've made a great mistake.\"  Old Mr. Crow coughed--and winked at his friends. \"The trouble was\"--he explained--\"the trouble was, you lost your balance and landed in the creek upside down. And of course you couldn't fly in that position. It's what's called 'turning turtle,'\" he added, \"and I might have known--if I had stopped to think--that you'd be sure to do it.\"  \"Well,\" said Timothy Turtle, drawing a long breath, \"I'll tell you right now that I'll never, _never_, turn turtle again.\"     IX  A PLEASURE TRIP   Almost always the wild folk in Pleasant Valley knew that if they wanted to see Timothy Turtle they could find him somewhere in Black Creek. But once in a great while he liked to go on what he called \"an excursion.\" By that he meant a pleasure trip to some spot not too far away--never outside of Pleasant Valley.  Nobody meeting Timothy Turtle on one of those journeys would have suspected that he was bent on pleasure. Or at least, nobody would have supposed that Mr. Turtle had found what he was looking for. Certainly if he was hunting for fun, he never looked as if he had discovered any. For no smile showed itself upon his face. Instead, he met every one with a frown. And if a body gave him a cheery \"Good morning,\" just as likely as not Timothy would answer with a grunt, and pass on.  Naturally, when Timothy Turtle arrived anywhere and told people that he expected to spend a few days among them they did not feel any great joy at the news. On the contrary, they were quite likely to say to one another, \"I hope he won't stop long,\" or \"He looks more grumpy than ever.\" And some would even remark that they wished Timothy Turtle would go home and stay there.  So no one of the Beaver colony was glad when Timothy appeared in their pond one day and explained that he intended to be in the neighborhood at least a week. In the first place, the Beavers, as a whole, were a busy, cheerful family, who did not like disagreeable folk for company. And in the second place, they were spry workers; and they had little use for anybody as slow as Timothy Turtle, who never did any work at all.  It is no wonder, then, that as soon as the news of Timothy's coming spread up and down and across the pond, the busy Beavers stopped their work and said things about the crusty outsider who had forced himself upon them. And almost everybody went to call upon Grandaddy Beaver and asked him what he thought ought to be"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20721"],["title","A Little Girl in Old Detroit (#1)"],["body",",' which meant Jeanne Angelot, Father Rameau said. And oh, Mam'selle, _petite fille_, you slept in my arms all night and in the morning you were as hungry as some wild thing. At first you cried a little for _maman_ and then you laughed with the children. For Touchas' boys were not grown-up men then, and White Fawn had not met her brave who took her up to St. Ignace.\"  \"I might have dropped from the clouds,\" said the child mirthfully. \"The Great Manitou could have sent me to you.\"  \"But you talked French. Up in the above they will speak in Latin as the good fathers do. That is why they use it in their prayers.\"  Jeanne nodded with a curl of disbelief in her red-rose mouth.  \"So then Touchas and I took you to Father Rameau and I told him the story. He has the clothes and the paper and the locket, which has two faces in it--we all thought they were your parents. The letters on it are all mixed up and no one can seem to make them out. And the ring. He thought some one would come to inquire. A party went out scouting, but they could find no trace of any encampment or any skirmish where there was likely to be some one killed, and they never found any trace. The English Commandant was here then and Madame was interested in you. Madame Bellestre would have you baptized in the old church to make sure, and because you were French she bade me bring you there and care for you. But she had to die and M. Bellestre had large interests in that wonderful Southern town, New Orleans, where it is said oranges and figs and strange things grow all the year round. Mademoiselle Bellestre was jealous, too, she did not like her father to make much of you. So he gave me the little house where we have lived ever since and twice he has sent by some traders to inquire about you, and it is he who sees that we want for nothing. Only you know the good priest advises that you should go in a retreat and become a sister.\"  \"But I never shall, never!\" with emphasis, as she suddenly sprang up. \"To be praying all day in some dark little hole and sleep on a hard bed and count beads, and wear that ugly black gown! No, I told Father Rameau if anyone shut me up I should shout and cry and howl like a panther! And I would bang my head against the stones until it split open and let out my life.\"  \"O Jeanne! Jeanne!\" cried the horror-stricken woman. \"That is wicked, and the good God hears you.\"  The girl's cheeks were scarlet and her eyes flashed like points of flame. They were not black, but of the darkest blue, with strange, steely lights in them that flashed and sparkled when she was roused in temper, which was often.  \"I think I will be English, or else like these new colonists that are taking possession of everything. I like their religion. You don't have to go in a convent and pray continually and be shut out of all beautiful things!\"  \"You are very naughty, Mam'selle. These English have spoiled so many people. There is but one God. And the good French fathers know what is right.\"  \"We did well enough before the French people came, Pani,\" said a soft, rather guttural voice from the handsome half-breed stretched out lazily on the other side of the tree where the western sunshine could fall on him.  \"You were not here,\" replied the woman, shortly. \"And the French have been good to me. Their religion saves you from torment and teaches you to be brave. And it takes women to the happy grounds beyond the sky.\"  \"Ah, they learned much of their bravery from the Indian, who can suffer tortures without a groan or a line of pain in the face. Is there any better God than the great Manitou? Does he not speak in the thunder, in the roar of the mighty cataract, and is not his voice soft when he chants in the summer night wind? He gives a brave victory over his enemies, he makes the corn grow and fills the woods with game, the lakes with fish. He is good enough God for me.\"  \"Why then did he let the French take your lands?\"  The man rose up on his elbow.  \"Because we were cowards!\" he cried fiercely. \"Because the priests made us weak with their religion, made women of us, called us to their mumbling prayers instead of fighting our enemies! They and the English gave us their fire water to drink and stole away our senses! And now they are both going to be driven out by these pigs of Americans. It serves them right.\"  \"And what will _you_ do, Monsieur Marsac?\" asked Pani with innocent irony.  \"Oh, I do not care for their grounds nor their fights. I shall go up north again for furs, and now the way is open for a wider trade and a man can make more money. I take thrift from my French father, you see. But some day my people will rise again, and this time it will not be a Pontiac war. We have some great chiefs left. We will not be crowded out of everything. You will see.\"  Then he sprang up lithe and graceful. He was of medium size but so well proportioned that he might have been modeled from the old Greeks. His hair was black and straight but had a certain softness, and his skin was like fine bronze, while his features were clearly cut. Now and then some man of good birth had married an Indian woman by the rites of the Church, and this Hugh de Marsac had done. But of all their children only one remained, and now the elder De Marsac had a lucrative post at Michilimackinac, while his son went to and fro on business. Outside of the post in the country sections the mixed marriages were quite common, and the French made very good husbands.  \"Mam'selle Jeanne,\" he said with a low bow, \"I admire your courage and taste. What one can see to adore in those stuffy old fathers puzzles me! As for praying in a cell, the whole wide heavens and earth that God has made lifts up one's soul to finer thoughts than mumbling over beads or worshiping a Christ on the cross. And you will be much too handsome, my brier rose, to shut yourself up in any Recollet house. There will be lovers suing for your pretty hand and your rosy lips.\"  Jeanne hid her face on Pani's shoulder. The admiring look did not suit her just now though in a certain fashion this young fellow had been her playmate and devoted attendant.  \"Let us go back home,\" she exclaimed suddenly.  \"Why hurry, Mam'selle? Let us go down to King's wharf and see the boats come in.\"  Her eyes lighted eagerly. She gave a hop on one foot and held out her hand to the woman, who rose slowly, then put the long, lean arm about the child's neck, who smiled up with a face of bloom to the wrinkled and withered one above her.  Louis Marsac frowned a little. What ailed the child to-day? She was generally ready enough to demand his attentions.  \"Mam'selle, you brought your story to an abrupt termination. I thought you liked the accessories. The procession that marched up the aisle of St. Anne's, the shower of kisses bestowed upon you after possible evil had been exorcised by holy water; the being taken home in Madame Bellestre's carriage--\"  \"If I wanted to hear it Pani could tell me. Walk behind, Louis, the path is narrow.\"  \"I will go ahead and clear the way,\" he returned with dignified sarcasm, suiting his pace to the action.  \"That is hardly polite, Monsieur.\"  \"Why yes. If there was any danger, I would be here to face it. I am the advance guard.\"  \"There never is any danger. And Pani is tall and strong. I am not afraid.\"  \"Perhaps you would rather I would not go? Though I believe you accepted my invitation heartily.\"  Just then two half drunken men lurched into the path. Drunkenness was one of the vices of that early civilization. Marsac pushed them aside with such force that the nearer one toppling against the other, both went over.  \"Thank you, Monsieur; it was good to have you.\"  Jeanne stretched herself up to her tallest and Marsac suddenly realized how she had grown, and that she was prettier than a year ago with some charm quite indescribable. If she were only a few years, older--  \"A man is sometimes useful,\" he returned dryly, glancing at her with a half laugh.  After the English had possession of Detroit, partly from the spirit of the times, the push of the newcomers, and the many restrictions that were abolished, the Detroit river took on an aspect of business that amazed the inhabitants. Sailing vessels came up the river, merchantmen loaded with cargoes instead of the string of canoes. And here was one at the old King's wharf with busy hands, whites and Indians, running to and fro with bales and boxes, presenting a scene of activity not often witnessed. Others had come down to see it as well. Marsac found a little rise of ground occupied by some boys that he soon dispossessed and put the woman and child in their places, despite black looks and mutterings.  What a beautiful sight it all was, Jeanne thought. Up the Strait, as the river was often called, to the crystal clear lake of St. Clair and the opposite shore of Canada, with clumps of dense woods that seemed guarding the place, and irregular openings that gave vistas of the far away prospect. What was all that great outside world like? After St. Clair river, Lake Huron and Michilimackinac? There were a great mission station and some nuns, and a large store place for the fur trade. And then--Hudson Bay somewhere clear to the end of the world, she thought.  The men uttered a sort of caroling melody with their work. There were some strange faces she had never seen before, swarthy people with great gold hoops in their ears.  \"Are they Americans?\" she asked, her idea of Americans being that they were a sort of conglomerate.  \"No--Spaniards, Portuguese, from the other side of the world. There are many strange peoples.\"  Louis Marsac's knowledge was extremely limited, as education had not made much of an advance among ordinary people. But he was glad he knew this when he saw the look of awe that for an instant touched the rosy face.  There were some English uniforms on the scene. For though the boundaries had been determined the English Commandant made various excuses, and demanded every"]]]
