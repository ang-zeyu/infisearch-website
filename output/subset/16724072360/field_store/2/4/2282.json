Went the door, and little Mrs Wimble stood gazing at it angrily for a few moments before sitting down and having what she called \"a good cry,\" after which she rose, wiped her eyes, and put away the tea things without partaking of any herself.  \"Poor Jem!\" she said softly; \"I'm afraid I'm very unkind to him sometimes.\"  Just at that moment Jem was sitting on an empty cask, eating his bread and butter, and watching a boat manned by blue-jackets going off to the sloop of war lying out toward the channel, and flying her colours in the evening breeze.  \"Poor little Sally!\" he said to himself.  \"We don't seem to get on somehow, and I'm afraid I'm a bit rough to her; but knives and scissors! What a temper she have got.\"  Meanwhile, in anything but a pleasant frame of mind, Don had gone home to find that the tea was ready, and that he was being treated as a laggard.  \"Come, Lindon,\" said his uncle quietly, \"you have kept us waiting some time.\"  The lad glanced quickly round the well-furnished room, bright with curiosities brought in many a voyage from the west, and with the poison of Mike's words still at work, he wondered how much of what he saw rightfully belonged to him.  The next moment his eyes lit on the soft sweet troubled face of his mother, full of appeal and reproach, and it seemed to Don that his uncle had been upsetting her by an account of his delinquencies.  \"It's top bad, and I don't deserve it,\" he said to himself.  \"Everything seems to go wrong now.  Well, what are you looking at?\" he added, to himself, as he took his seat and stared across at his cousin, the playmate of many years, whose quiet little womanly face seemed to repeat her father's grave, reproachful look, but who, as it were, snatched her eyes away as soon as she met his gaze.  \"They all hate me,\" thought Don, who was in that unhappy stage of a boy's life when help is so much needed to keep him from turning down one of the dark side lanes of the great main route.  \"Been for a walk, Don?\" said his mother with a tender look.  \"No, mother, I only stopped back in the yard a little while.\"  His uncle set down his cup sharply.  \"You have not been keeping that scoundrel Bannock?\" he cried.  \"No, sir; I've been talking to Jem.\"  \"Ho!\" ejaculated the old merchant.  \"That's better.  But you might have come straight home.\"  Don's eyes encountered his Cousin Kitty's just then, as she gave her head a shake to throw back the brown curls which clustered about her white forehead.  She turned her gaze upon her plate, and he could see that she was frowning.  \"Yes,\" thought Don, \"they all dislike me, and I'm only a worry and trouble to my mother.  I wish I was far away--anywhere.\"  He went on with his tea moodily and in silence, paying no heed to the reproachful glances of his mother's eyes, which seemed to him to say, and with some reason, \"Don't be sulky, Don, my boy; try and behave as I could wish.\"  \"It's of no use to try,\" he said to himself; and the meal passed off very silently, and with a cold chill on every one present.  \"I'm very sorry, Laura,\" said her brother, as soon as Don had left the room; \"and I don't know what to do for the best.  I hate finding fault and scolding, but if the boy is in the wrong I must chide.\"  \"Try and be patient with him, Josiah,\" said Mrs Lavington pleadingly. \"He is very young yet.\"  \"Patient?  I'm afraid I have been too patient.  That scoundrel at the yard has unsettled him with his wild tales of the sea; and if I allowed it, Don would make him quite a companion.\"  \"But, Josiah--\"  \"There, don't look like that, my dear.  I promised you I would play a father's part to the boy, and I will; but you must not expect me to be a weak indulgent father, and spoil him with foolish lenity.  There, enough for one day.  I daresay we shall get all right in time.\"  \"Oh, yes,\" cried Mrs Lavington, earnestly.  \"He's a true-hearted, brave boy; don't try to crush him down.\"  \"Crush him, nonsense!\" cried the merchant, angrily.  \"You really are too bad, Laura, and--\"  He stopped, for just then Don re-entered the room to flush up angrily as he saw his mother in tears; and he had heard enough of his uncle's remark and its angry tone to make him writhe.  \"Ill using her now,\" he said to himself, as he set his teeth and walked to the window.  The closing of the door made him start round quickly, to find that his mother was close behind him, and his uncle gone.  \"What has Uncle Jos been saying to you, mother?\" he cried angrily.  \"Nothing--nothing particular, my boy,\" she faltered.  \"He has,\" cried Don fiercely; \"and I won't have it.  He may scold and abuse me as much as he likes, but I will not have him ill use you.\"  \"Ill use me, Don?\" cried Mrs Lavington.  \"Nonsense, my dear boy.  Your uncle is all that is kind and good; and he loves you very dearly, Don, if you could only try--try a little more, my dear boy, to do what he likes, and please him.\"  \"I do try, mother, but it's no good.\"  \"Don't say that, Don.  Try a little harder--for my sake, dear, as well as your own.\"  \"I have tried, I am always trying, and it's of no use.  Nothing pleases uncle, and the men in the yard know it.\"  \"Don, my boy, what foolish obstinate fit is this which has come over you?\" said Mrs Lavington tenderly.  \"I'm not obstinate,\" he said sullenly; \"only unhappy.\"  \"Is it not your own fault, my darling?\" she whispered; \"believe me, your uncle is one of the kindest and best of men.\"  Don shook his head.  \"Are you going to prefer the opinion of the men of the yard to mine, dear?\"  \"No, mother, but uncle is your brother, and you believe in him and defend him.  You know how harsh and unkind he is to me.\"  \"Not unkind, Don, only firm and for your good.  Now come, my boy, do, for my sake, try to drive away these clouds, and let us all be happy once more.\"  \"It's of no use to try, mother; I shall never be happy here, tied down to a desk.  It's like being uncle's slave.\"  \"What am I to say to you, Don, if you talk like this?\" said Mrs Lavington.  \"Believe me you are wrong, and some day you will own it. You will see what a mistaken view you have taken of your uncle's treatment.  There, I shall say no more now.\"  \"You always treat me as if I were a child,\" said Don, bitterly.  \"I'm seventeen now, mother, and I ought to know something.\"  \"Yes, my boy,\" said Mrs Lavington gently; \"at seventeen we think we know a good deal; and at forty we smile as we look back and see what a very little that `good deal' was.\"  Don shook his head.  \"There, we will have no more sad looks.  Uncle is eager to do all he can to make us happy.\"  \"I wish I could think so,\" cried Don, bitterly.  \"You may, my dear.  And now, come, try and throw aside all those fanciful notions about going abroad and meeting with adventures.  There is no place like home, Don, and you will find out some day that is true.\"  \"But I have no home till I make one,\" said the lad gloomily.  \"You have an excellent home here, Don, the gift of one who has kindly taken the place toward you of your father.  There, I will listen to no more from you, for this is all foolish fighting of your worse against your better self.\"  There was a quiet dignity in his mother's words which awed Don for the moment, but the gentle embrace given the next minute seemed to undo that which the firmness had achieved, and that night the cloud over the lad's life seemed darker than ever.  \"She takes uncle's side and thinks he is everything,\" he said gloomily, as he went to bed.  \"She means right, but she is wrong.  Oh, how I wish I could go right away somewhere and begin life all over again.\"  Then he lay down to sleep, but slumber did not come, so he went on thinking of many things, to fall into a state of unconsciousness at last, from which he awoke to the fact that it was day--a very eventful day for him, but he did not awaken to the fact that he was very blind.    CHAPTER THREE.  AN AWKWARD GUINEA.  It was a busy day at the yard, for a part of the lading of a sugar ship was being stored away in Uncle Josiah's warehouses; but from the very commencement matters seemed to go wrong, and the state of affairs about ten o'clock was pretty ably expressed by Jem Wimble, who came up to Don as he was busy with pencil and book, keeping account of the deliveries, and said in a loud voice,--  \"What did your uncle have for breakfast, Mas' Don?\"  \"Coffee--ham--I hardly know, Jem.\"  \"Ho!  Thought p'r'aps it had been cayenne pepper.\"  \"Nonsense!\"  \"Ah, you may say that, but see how he is going it.  'Tarn't my fault that the dock men work so badly, and 'tarn't my fault that Mike isn't here, and--\"  \"Don't stand talking to Wimble, Lindon,\" said a voice sharply, and Uncle Josiah came up to the pair.  \"No, don't go away, Wimble.  Did Bannock say he should stay away to-day?\"  \"Not to me, uncle.\"  \"Nor to me, sir.\"  \"It's very strange, just as we are so busy too.  He has not drawn any money.\"  \"P'r'aps press-gang's got him, sir,\" suggested Jem.  \"Humph!  Hardly likely!\" said Uncle Josiah; and he went on and entered the office, to come out at the end of a few minutes and beckon to Don.  \"Lindon,\" he said, as the lad joined him, \"I left nine guineas and a half in the little mahogany bowl in my desk yesterday.  Whom have you paid?\"  \"Paid?  No one, sir.\"  \"But eight guineas are gone--missing.\"  \"Eight guineas?  Missing, sir?\"  \"Yes, do you know anything about them?\"  \"No, sir.  I--that is--yes, I remember now: I picked up a guinea on the floor, and meant to give it to you.  Here it is: I forgot all about it.\"  Don took a piece of gold from his flap"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21321"],["title","Before the Dawn: A Story of the Fall of Richmond (#1)"],["body","of a possible purchaser, his eye caught Prescott.  \"This will just suit you,\" he said. \"A change of a strap or two and it will do for either captain or lieutenant. What a figure you will be in this uniform!\" Then he leaned over and said persuasively: \"Better buy it, my boy. Take the advice of a man of experience. Clothes are half the battle. They may not be so on the firing line, but they are here in Richmond.\"  Prescott looked longingly at the uniform which in colour and texture was all that the auctioneer claimed, and fingered a small package of gold in his pocket. At that moment some one bid fifty dollars, and Prescott surveyed him with interest.  The speaker was a man of his own age, but shorter and darker, with a hawk-like face softened by black eyes with a faintly humourous twinkle lurking in the corner of each. He seemed distinctly good-natured, but competition stirred Prescott and he offered sixty dollars. The other man hesitated, and the auctioneer, who seemed to know him, asked him to bid up.  \"This uniform is worth a hundred dollars if it's worth a cent, Mr. Talbot,\" he said.  \"I'll give you seventy-five dollars cash or five hundred on a credit,\" said Talbot; \"now which will you take?\"  \"If I had to take either I'd take the seventy-five dollars cash, and I'd be mighty quick about making a choice,\" replied the auctioneer.  Talbot turned to Prescott and regarded him attentively for a moment or two. Then he said:  \"You look like a good fellow, and we're about the same size. Now, I haven't a hundred dollars in gold, and I doubt whether you have. Suppose we buy this uniform together, and take turns in wearing it.\"  Prescott laughed, but he saw that the proposition was made in entire good faith, and he liked the face of the man whom the auctioneer had called Talbot.  \"I won't do that,\" he replied, \"because I have more money than you think. I'll buy this and I'll lend you enough to help you in buying another.\"  Friendships are quickly formed in war time, and the offer was accepted at once. The uniforms were purchased and the two young men strolled on together, each carrying a precious burden under his arm.  \"My name is Talbot, Thomas Talbot,\" said the stranger. \"I'm a lieutenant and I've had more than two years' service in the West. I was in that charge at Chickamauga when General Cheatham, leading us on, shouted: 'Boys, give 'em hell'; and General Polk, who had been a bishop and couldn't swear, looked at us and said: 'Boys, do as General Cheatham says!' Well, I got a bad wound in the shoulder there, and I've been invalided since in Richmond, but I'm soon going to join the Army of Northern Virginia.\"  Talbot talked on and Prescott found him entertaining, as he was a man who saw the humourous side of things, and his speech, being spontaneous, was interesting.  The day grew darker and colder. Heavy clouds shut out the sun and the rain began to fall. The people fled from the streets, and the two officers shivered in their uniforms. The wind rose and whipped the rain into their faces. Its touch was like ice.  \"Come in here and wait till the storm passes,\" said Talbot, taking his new friend by the arm and pulling him through an open door. Prescott now heard more distinctly than ever the light click of ivory chips, mingled with the sound of many voices in a high or low key, and the soft movement of feet on thick carpets. Without taking much thought, he followed his new friend down a short and narrow hall, at the end of which they entered a large, luxurious room, well lighted and filled with people.  \"Yes, it's a gambling room--The Nonpareil--and there are plenty more like it in Richmond, I can tell you,\" said Talbot. \"Those who follow war must have various kinds of excitement. Besides, nothing is so bad that it does not have its redeeming point, and these places, without pay, have cared for hundreds and hundreds of our wounded.\"  Prescott had another errand upon which his conscience bade him hasten, but casting one glance through the window he saw the soaking streets and the increasing rain, swept in wild gusts by the fierce wind. Then the warmth and light of the place, the hum of talk and perhaps the spirit of youth infolded him and he stayed.  There were thirty or forty men in the room, some civilians and others soldiers, two bearing upon their shoulders the stripes of a general. Four carried their arms in slings and three had crutches beside their chairs. One of the generals was not over twenty-three years of age, but this war furnished younger generals than he, men who won their rank by sheer hard service on great battlefields.  The majority of the men were playing faro, roulette or keno, and the others sat in softly upholstered chairs and talked. Liquors were served from a bar in the corner, where dozens of brightly polished glasses of all shapes and sizes glittered on marble and reflected the light of the gas in vivid colours.  Prescott's mind traveled back to long, lonely watches in the dark forest under snow and rain, in front of the enemy's outposts, and he admitted that while the present might be very wicked it was also very pleasant.  He gave himself up for a little while to the indulgence of his physical senses, and then began to examine those in the room, his eyes soon resting upon the one who was most striking in appearance. It was a time of young men, and this stranger was young like most of the others, perhaps under twenty-five. He was of middle height, very thick and broad, and his frame gave the impression of great muscular strength and endurance. A powerful neck supported a great head surmounted by a crop of hair like a lion's mane. His complexion was as delicate as a woman's, but his pale blue eyes were bent close to the table as he wagered his money with an almost painful intentness, and Prescott saw that the gaming madness was upon him.  Talbot's eyes followed Prescott's and he smiled.  \"I don't wonder that you are looking at Raymond,\" he said. \"He is sure to attract attention anywhere. You are beholding one of the most remarkable men the South has produced.\"  Prescott recognized the name as that of the editor of the _Patriot_, a little newspaper published on a press traveling in a wagon with the Western army until a month since, when it had come over to the Army of Northern Virginia. The _Patriot_ was \"little\" only in size. The wit, humour, terseness, spontaneous power of expression, and above all of phrase-making, which its youthful editor showed in its columns, already had made Raymond a power in the Confederacy, as they were destined in his maturity to win him fame in a reunited nation.  \"He's a great gamester and thinks that he's a master of chance,\" said Talbot, \"but as a matter of fact he always loses. See how fast his pile of money is diminishing. It will soon be gone, but he will find another resource. You watch him.\"  Prescott did not need the advice, as his attention was already concentrated on Raymond's broad, massive jaw and the aggressive curve of his strong face. His movements were quick and nervous; face and figure alike expressed the most absolute self-confidence. Prescott wondered if this self-confidence did not lie at the basis of all success, military, literary, mercantile or other, enabling one's triumphs to cover up his failures and make the people remember only the former.  Raymond continued to lose, and presently, all his money being gone, he began to feel in his pockets in an absent-minded way for more, but the hand came forth empty from each pocket. He did not hesitate.  A man only two or three years older was sitting next to Raymond, and he, too, was intent on the game. Beside him was a very respectable little heap of gold and notes, and Raymond, reaching over, took half of the money and without a word, putting it in front of himself, went on with his wagers. The second man looked up in surprise, but seeing who had robbed him, merely made a wry face and continued his game. Several who had noticed the action laughed.  \"It's Raymond's way,\" said Talbot. \"I knew that he would do it. That's why I told you to watch him. The other man is Winthrop. He's an editor, too--one of our Richmond papers. He isn't a genius like Raymond, but he's a slashing writer--loves to criticize anybody from the President down, and he often does it. He belongs to the F. F. V.'s himself, but he has no mercy on them--shows up all their faults. While you can say that gambling is Raymond's amusement, you may say with equal truth that dueling is Winthrop's.\"  \"Dueling!\" exclaimed Prescott in surprise. \"Why, I never saw a milder face!\"  \"Oh, he doesn't fight duels from choice,\" replied Talbot. \"It's because of his newspaper. He's always criticizing, and here when a man is criticized in print he challenges the editor. And the funny thing about it is, that although Winthrop can't shoot or fence at all, he's never been hurt. Providence protects him, I suppose.\"  \"Has he ever hit anybody?\" asked Prescott.  \"Only once,\" replied Talbot, \"and that was his eleventh duel since the war began. He shot his man in the shoulder and then jumped up and down in his pride. 'I hit him! I hit him!' he cried. 'Yes, Winthrop,' said his second, 'some one was bound to get in the way if you kept on shooting long enough.'\"  The place, with its rich colours, its lights shining from glasses and mirrors, its mellow odours of liquids and its softened sounds began to have a soporific effect upon Prescott, used so long to the open air and untold hardships. His senses were pleasantly lulled, and the voice of his friend, whom he seemed now to have known for a long time, came from far away. He could have closed his eyes and gone to sleep, but Talbot talked on.  \"Here you see the back door of the Confederacy,\" he said. \"You men at the front know nothing. You are merely fighting to defend the main entrance. But while you are getting yourselves shot to pieces without knowing any special reason why, all sorts of people slip in at "]]]
