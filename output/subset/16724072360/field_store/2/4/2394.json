The captain then called to him to go out to the end of the \"yardarm.\"  Yards are the huge cross beams fastened to the masts to which the sails are fixed.  The \"main-yard\" is the largest.  The mainsail is attached to it.  Davy soon crept out nearly to the end, but when he got there the yard became so small and the ropes upon it were so few and slack, that the poor boy's courage began to fail.  He looked down at the water, which seemed to be terribly far below him.  At that moment the ship made a lurch or plunge, Davy lost his hold, and with a loud cry fell headlong from the yard into the sea.  In a moment Ben Block, who had been watching him, jumped overboard; a boat was lowered, and in less than ten minutes Ben was picked up with Davy clinging to him.  Not long after this they drew near the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, and were beginning to think of the end of their voyage.  But one night while Davy lay sound asleep in his warm hammock, he was startled by a cry on deck, which was followed by a loud order for \"all hands\" to tumble up and shorten sail.  The sailors are usually called \"hands\" at sea.  In a moment Davy was on deck, with only his trousers and shirt on.  But he could not see anything, the night was so dark, and he could scarcely hear anything except the howling of the wind.  \"Take in all sail!\" roared the captain.  The men rushed to obey, and Davy was so well accustomed to the work that he too climbed to his usual place on the main topsail yard and began to haul in the sail.  He could barely see the man next to him, and it was with difficulty he kept his hold of the yard, while the ship tossed and plunged in the waves.  When nearly all sail was taken in the ship went easier, and the men assembled on the deck to await further orders.  The gale increased, and suddenly the small bit of the fore-topsail that was hoisted burst into shreds with a clap like thunder, and carried away the fore-topmast with all its yards and rigging, part of the bowsprit, and the top of the mainmast. \"Clear away the wreck!\" shouted the captain.  Some of the men ran for axes, and began to cut the ropes that fastened the broken masts to the ship, for there was a danger of the ship striking against them and knocking a hole in her side while she plunged.  Still the gale increased, and the mizzen topmast went overboard.  The \"mizzen\" is the mast nearest to the stern.  It is the smallest of the three.  The lightning now began to flash, and the thunder to roar, while the crew of the _Fair Nancy_ stood on her deck clinging to the bulwarks, lest they should be washed overboard!  Little Davy looked at the man next him, and saw that it was Ben Block.  \"Oh, Ben!\" said he, \"what an awful night it is!  Do you think we shall be lost?\"  Ben shook his head.  \"I don't know, lad; but the Lord can save us, if it be His will.  Pray to Him, boy.\"  \"My poor mother!\" murmured Davy, as the tears rose to his eyes, while he prayed to God in his heart that he might be spared to see her again.  At that moment there came a wave so big and black that Davy thought the sea was going to turn upside down.  It came on like a great dark mountain, high above the ship.  \"Hold on for your lives!\" cried some of the men, as the wave fell with a fearful crash and turned the ship over on her side--or on her \"beam-ends,\" as sailors call it.  They were in awful danger now, as the sea began to pour down into the cabins, and the masts and sails being in the water the ship could not \"right,\" or become straight again.  \"Cut away the masts!\" roared the captain.  The deck was now standing up like a wall, so that the men could not walk on it, but they managed with great difficulty to reach the mizzenmast, which a few strokes of the axe sent overboard.  Still the ship lay on her beam-ends. \"Cut away the mainmast!\" cried the captain.  The order was obeyed, and with a loud report, like a cannon shot, it went overboard too. Immediately after the fall of the mainmast there came another wave, from which they never expected to rise again.  It dashed down on the stern and drove in the cabin windows; but the worst of it was, that it swept away all the boats belonging to the ship.  They had been securely fastened to the deck; but this wave carried them all away, so that now, if the ship sank, their only chance of escape was gone.  The same wave snapped the foremast across near the deck.  This was fortunate, because it enabled the ship to \"right\" herself, and once more the men were able to stand on the deck.  The storm continued to rage still, however, and some of the men were sent to work the pumps, for there was a great deal of water in the ship now; so much, indeed, that she could hardly float. Another party were ordered to fit up a small mast, which they tied to the stump of the foremast.  This new one was called a \"jury-mast;\" and as they could not sail without a mast of some kind or other, they were very glad when they saw it up and a sail hoisted on it.  During the night, however, another heavy wave broke this mast away also; so they were again left to toss like a log on the stormy waters.  All this time the men were working hard at the pumps, but, although they worked for many hours without stopping, the water continued to increase in the hold, and they saw that the ship had sprung \"a leak;\" that is to say, some of the planks had started, or the seams had opened, and the water was pouring into it so fast that it was evident she would soon sink.  This was very awful indeed.  Some of the men began to cry to God for mercy, others tore their hair and ran about like madmen, while some sat down and silently prepared to die!  The morning light came at last.  But what a sad sight it rose upon.  The once noble ship now lay a wreck upon the water, with the masts and sails gone and her shattered hull ready to sink.  The captain, who seemed to have lost all hope when the jury-mast broke, was standing on the poop, looking anxiously round the horizon in hopes of seeing a sail--but in vain.  Davy stood beside him, and looking up in his face, said, \"Please, sir, could we not make a raft?\"  \"Right, boy, right,\" replied the captain; \"you're the best `man' amongst us.  We're no better than girls to be giving way to despair in this way. Hallo! lads, rouse up there; get all the spare yards and spars you can, and make a raft.  Look sharp now!\"  The captain said this in such a quick, commanding tone that all the sailors jumped to obey him, and in five minutes they were busily at work on the raft.  First, they collected all the broken yards and bits of masts that were still floating alongside, dragging by the ropes that fastened them to the sides of the ship.  These they arranged side by side, and tied them firmly together with ropes.  Then they collected all the spare timbers that were in the ship, and putting these above the others, fastened them with ropes too.  After that they tore off some of the planks from the decks and bulwarks, with which they made a kind of floor to the raft.  All this, although it takes a short time to tell, took a long, long time to do; for it was hard work moving such heavy timbers, and the poor men were very tired, having been up in the storm all night.  Besides this, although the wind had ceased, the waves were still high and would not let them work quietly.  However, they finished it at last, and after it was done, they put a number of barrels of biscuit and some casks of water and wine on board.  Then they put a few blankets and a compass--that useful little machine that points always to the north, and shows the sailor which way to go, so that he sails in the dark night as surely as in the broad day.  \"Now,\" said the captain, \"I think that there is a chance of escape yet. Get on board, lads, as fast as you can.  I fear the ship won't float long.\"  All the men now hastened on board.  The captain's wife, who was the only female in the ship, was the first to step on the raft, and it soon began to be crowded.  When about half of the sailors had left the ship the captain suddenly cried out, \"Ho!  Ben Block, we've forgot a mast and sail.  Run below with a couple of hands and fetch one as fast as you can.\"  Just at that moment the ship gave a heavy plunge, the ropes broke, and the raft floated slowly away, leaving the men who were yet in the ship in a state of despair.  One or two of them jumped into the sea and tried to swim to the raft; but the first man who did so was nearly drowned, and the others got back to the ship with great difficulty.  It was a terrible sight to witness the misery of the poor captain, as he beheld his wife, standing with her arms stretched out towards him, and the raft drifting slowly away, until at length it appeared like a small black spot far off upon the sea.  \"Oh, my poor wife!\" he cried, \"I shall never see you more.\"  The tears were rolling down Ben Block's weatherbeaten face as he went up to the captain and took him by the hand.  \"Never fear, sir,\" said he; \"the Almighty can save her.\"  \"Thank you, Ben, for saying that,\" replied the captain; \"but the ship won't float long.  My wife may indeed be saved, but we are sure to be lost.\"  \"I don't know that,\" cried Ben, trying to look cheerful.  \"When you sent me down below, sir, to look for a mast and sail, I observed that the water in the hold had ceased rising.  If we can only keep her afloat a little longer, we may manage to make another raft.\"  The captain smiled sadly and shook his head, and Davy, who had been standing beside him all the time, felt his heart sink again.  To add to the horror of the scene, night came on, and the water was so high in the cabin that the captain and men who had been left in the wreck had to try to sleep on the wet decks the best way they could. Next morning the wind was still blowing pretty hard, and they now saw that they were drawing near to a wild shore, where there seemed to be"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21746"],["title","The Lighthouse (#1)"],["body","with various articles more than once, while his comrade continued his rambles unsuccessfully.  At last, however, Big Swankie came to a gully or inlet where a large mass of the _debris_ of a wreck was piled up in indescribable confusion, in the midst of which lay the dead body of an old man.  Swankie's first impulse was to shout to his companion, but he checked himself, and proceeded to examine the pockets of the dead man.  Raising the corpse with some difficulty he placed it on the ledge of rock.  Observing a ring on the little finger of the right hand, he removed it and put it hastily in his pocket.  Then he drew a red morocco case from an inner breast pocket in the dead man's coat.  To his surprise and delight he found that it contained a gold watch and several gold rings and brooches, in some of which were beautiful stones. Swankie was no judge of jewellery, but he could not avoid the conviction that these things must needs be valuable.  He laid the case down on the rock beside him, and eagerly searched the other pockets.  In one he found a large clasp-knife and a pencil-case; in another a leather purse, which felt heavy as he drew it out.  His eyes sparkled at the first glance he got of the contents, for they were sovereigns!  Just as he made this discovery, Davy Spink climbed over the ledge at his back, and Swankie hastily thrust the purse underneath the body of the dead man.  \"Hallo! lad, what have ye there?  Hey! watches and rings--come, we're in luck this mornin'.\"  \"_We_!\" exclaimed Swankie, somewhat sternly, \"_you_ didn't find that case.\"  \"Na, lad, but we've aye divided, an' I dinna see what for we should change our plan noo.\"  \"We've nae paction to that effec'--the case o' kickshaws is mine,\" retorted Swankie.  \"Half o't,\" suggested Spink.  \"Weel, weel,\" cried the other with affected carelessness, \"I'd scorn to be sae graspin'.  For the matter o' that ye may hae it all to yersel', but I'll hae the next thing we git that's worth muckle a' to _mysel'_.\"  So saying Swankie stooped to continue his search of the body, and in a moment or two drew out the purse with an exclamation of surprise.  \"See, I'm in luck, Davy!  Virtue's aye rewarded, they say.  This is mine, and I doot not there'll be some siller intilt.\"  \"Goold!\" cried Davy, with dilated eyes, as his comrade emptied the contents into his large hand, and counted over thirty sovereigns.  \"Ay, lad, ye can keep the what-d'ye-ca'-ums, and I'll keep the siller.\"  \"I've seen that face before,\" observed Spink, looking intently at the body.  \"Like enough,\" said Swankie, with an air of indifference, as he put the gold into his pocket.  \"I think I've seed it mysel'.  It looks like auld Jamie Brand, but I didna ken him weel.\"  \"It's just him,\" said Spink, with a touch of sadness.  \"Ay, ay, that'll fa' heavy on the auld woman.  But, come, it'll no' do to stand haverin' this way.  Let's see what else is on him.\"  They found nothing more of any value; but a piece of paper was discovered, wrapped up in oilskin, and carefully fastened with red tape, in the vest pocket of the dead man.  It contained writing, and had been so securely wrapped up, that it was only a little damped.  Davy Spink, who found it, tried in vain to read the writing; Davy's education had been neglected, so he was fain to confess that he could not make it out.  \"Let _me_ see't,\" said Swankie.  \"What hae we here?  `The sloop is hard an--an--'\"  \"`Fast,' maybe,\" suggested Spink.  \"Ay, so 'tis.  I canna make out the next word, but here's something about the jewel-case.\"  The man paused and gazed earnestly at the paper for a few minutes, with a look of perplexity on his rugged visage.  \"Weel, man, what is't?\" enquired Davy.  \"Hoot!  I canna mak' it oot,\" said the other, testily, as if annoyed at being unable to read it.  He refolded the paper and thrust it into his bosom, saying, \"Come, we're wastin' time.  Let's get on wi' our wark.\"  \"Toss for the jewels and the siller,\" said Spink, suggestively.  \"Very weel,\" replied the other, producing a copper.  \"Heeds, you win the siller; tails, I win the box;--heeds it is, so the kickshaws is mine. Weel, I'm content,\" he added, as he handed the bag of gold to his comrade, and received the jewel-case in exchange.  In another hour the sea began to encroach on the rock, and the fishermen, having collected as much as time would permit of the wrecked materials, returned to their boat.  They had secured altogether above two hundredweight of old metal,-- namely, a large piece of a ship's caboose, a hinge, a lock of a door, a ship's marking-iron, a soldier's bayonet, a cannon ball, a shoebuckle, and a small anchor, besides part of the cordage of the wreck, and the money and jewels before mentioned.  Placing the heavier of these things in the bottom of the boat, they pushed off.  \"We better take the corp ashore,\" said Spink, suddenly.  \"What for?  They may ask what was in the pockets,\" objected Swankie.  \"Let them ask,\" rejoined the other, with a grin.  Swankie made no reply, but gave a stroke with his oar which sent the boat close up to the rocks.  They both relanded in silence, and, lifting the dead body of the old man, laid it in the stern-sheets of the boat. Once more they pushed off.  Too much delay had been already made.  The surf was breaking over the ledges in all directions, and it was with the utmost difficulty that they succeeded in getting clear out into deep water.  A breeze which had sprung up from the east, tended to raise the sea a little, but when they finally got away from the dangerous reef, the breeze befriended them. Hoisting the foresail, they quickly left the Bell Rock far behind them, and, in the course of a couple of hours, sailed into the harbour of Arbroath.    CHAPTER TWO.  THE LOVERS AND THE PRESS-GANG.  About a mile to the eastward of the ancient town of Arbroath the shore abruptly changes its character, from a flat beach to a range of, perhaps, the wildest and most picturesque cliffs on the east coast of Scotland.  Inland the country is rather flat, but elevated several hundred feet above the level of the sea, towards which it slopes gently until it reaches the shore, where it terminates in abrupt, perpendicular precipices, varying from a hundred to two hundred feet in height.  In many places the cliffs overhang the water, and all along the coast they have been perforated and torn up by the waves, so as to present singularly bold and picturesque outlines, with caverns, inlets, and sequestered \"coves\" of every form and size.  To the top of these cliffs, in the afternoon of the day on which our tale opens, a young girl wended her way,--slowly, as if she had no other object in view than a stroll, and sadly, as if her mind were more engaged with the thoughts within than with the magnificent prospect of land and sea without.  The girl was:    \"Fair, fair, with golden hair,\"  and apparently about twenty years of age.  She sought out a quiet nook among the rocks at the top of the cliffs; near to a circular chasm, with the name of which (at that time) we are not acquainted, but which was destined ere long to acquire a new name and celebrity from an incident which shall be related in another part of this story.  Curiously enough, just about the same hour, a young man was seen to wend his way to the same cliffs, and, from no reason whatever with which we happened to be acquainted, sought out the same nook!  We say \"he was seen,\" advisedly, for the maid with the golden hair saw him.  Any ordinary observer would have said that she had scarcely raised her eyes from the ground since sitting down on a niece of flower-studded turf near the edge of the cliff, and that she certainly had not turned her head in the direction of the town.  Yet she saw him,--however absurd the statement may appear, we affirm it confidently,--and knew that he was coming.  Other eyes there were that also saw youth--eyes that would have caused him some degree of annoyance had he known they were upon him-- eyes that he would have rejoiced to tinge with the colours black and blue!  There were thirteen pair of them, belonging to twelve men and a lieutenant of the navy.  In those days the barbarous custom of impressment into the Royal Navy was in full operation.  England was at war with France.  Men were wanted to fight our battles, and when there was any difficulty in getting men, press-gangs were sent out to force them into the service.  The youth whom we now introduce to the reader was a sailor, a strapping, handsome one, too; not, indeed, remarkable for height, being only a little above the average--five feet, ten inches or thereabouts--but noted for great depth of chest, breadth of shoulder, and development of muscle; conspicuous also for the quantity of close, clustering, light-brown curls down his head, and for the laughing glance of his dark-blue eye. Not a hero of romance, by any means.  No, he was very matter of fact, and rather given to meditation than mischief.  The officer in charge of the press-gang had set his heart on this youth (so had another individual, of whom more anon!) but the youth, whose name was Ruby Brand, happened to have an old mother who was at that time in very bad health, and she had also set her heart, poor body, on the youth, and entreated him to stay at home just for one half-year.  Ruby willingly consented, and from that time forward led the life of a dog in consequence of the press-gang.  Now, as we have said, he had been seen leaving the town by the lieutenant, who summoned his men and went after him--cautiously, however, in order to take him by surprise for Ruby, besides being strong and active as a lion, was slippery as an eel.  Going straight as an arrow to the spot where she of the golden hair was seated, the youth presented himself suddenly to her, sat down beside her, and exclaiming \"Minnie\", put his arm round her waist.  \"Oh, Ruby, don't,\" said Minnie, blushing.  Now, reader, the \"don't\" and the blush had no reference to the arm"]]]
