I merely say this by the way, good brother.    ORGON   You are the sole expounder of the doctrine;   Wisdom shall die with you, no doubt, good brother,   You are the only wise, the sole enlightened,   The oracle, the Cato, of our age.   All men, compared to you, are downright fools.    CLEANTE   I'm not the sole expounder of the doctrine,   And wisdom shall not die with me, good brother.   But this I know, though it be all my knowledge,   That there's a difference 'twixt false and true.   And as I find no kind of hero more   To be admired than men of true religion,   Nothing more noble or more beautiful   Than is the holy zeal of true devoutness;   Just so I think there's naught more odious   Than whited sepulchres of outward unction,   Those barefaced charlatans, those hireling zealots,   Whose sacrilegious, treacherous pretence   Deceives at will, and with impunity   Makes mockery of all that men hold sacred;   Men who, enslaved to selfish interests,   Make trade and merchandise of godliness,   And try to purchase influence and office   With false eye-rollings and affected raptures;   Those men, I say, who with uncommon zeal   Seek their own fortunes on the road to heaven;   Who, skilled in prayer, have always much to ask,   And live at court to preach retirement;   Who reconcile religion with their vices,   Are quick to anger, vengeful, faithless, tricky,   And, to destroy a man, will have the boldness   To call their private grudge the cause of heaven;   All the more dangerous, since in their anger   They use against us weapons men revere,   And since they make the world applaud their passion,   And seek to stab us with a sacred sword.   There are too many of this canting kind.   Still, the sincere are easy to distinguish;   And many splendid patterns may be found,   In our own time, before our very eyes   Look at Ariston, Periandre, Oronte,   Alcidamas, Clitandre, and Polydore;   No one denies their claim to true religion;   Yet they're no braggadocios of virtue,   They do not make insufferable display,   And their religion's human, tractable;   They are not always judging all our actions,   They'd think such judgment savoured of presumption;   And, leaving pride of words to other men,   'Tis by their deeds alone they censure ours.   Evil appearances find little credit   With them; they even incline to think the best   Of others. No caballers, no intriguers,   They mind the business of their own right living.   They don't attack a sinner tooth and nail,   For sin's the only object of their hatred;   Nor are they over-zealous to attempt   Far more in heaven's behalf than heaven would have 'em.   That is my kind of man, that is true living,   That is the pattern we should set ourselves.   Your fellow was not fashioned on this model;   You're quite sincere in boasting of his zeal;   But you're deceived, I think, by false pretences.    ORGON   My dear good brother-in-law, have you quite done?    CLEANTE   Yes.    ORGON   I'm your humble servant.    (Starts to go.)    CLEANTE   Just a word.   We'll drop that other subject. But you know   Valere has had the promise of your daughter.    ORGON   Yes.    CLEANTE   You had named the happy day.    ORGON   'Tis true.    CLEANTE   Then why put off the celebration of it?    ORGON   I can't say.    CLEANTE   Can you have some other plan   In mind?    ORGON   Perhaps.    CLEANTE   You mean to break your word?    ORGON   I don't say that.    CLEANTE   I hope no obstacle   Can keep you from performing what you've promised.    ORGON   Well, that depends.    CLEANTE   Why must you beat about?   Valere has sent me here to settle matters.    ORGON   Heaven be praised!    CLEANTE   What answer shall I take him?    ORGON   Why, anything you please.    CLEANTE   But we must know   Your plans. What are they?    ORGON   I shall do the will   Of Heaven.    CLEANTE   Come, be serious. You've given   Your promise to Valere. Now will you keep it?    ORGON   Good-bye.    CLEANTE (alone)   His love, methinks, has much to fear;   I must go let him know what's happening here.       ACT II      SCENE I    ORGON, MARIANE     ORGON   Now, Mariane.    MARIANE   Yes, father?    ORGON   Come; I'll tell you   A secret.    MARIANE   Yes ... What are you looking for?    ORGON (looking into a small closet-room)   To see there's no one there to spy upon us;   That little closet's mighty fit to hide in.   There! We're all right now. Mariane, in you   I've always found a daughter dutiful   And gentle. So I've always love you dearly.    MARIANE   I'm grateful for your fatherly affection.    ORGON   Well spoken, daughter. Now, prove you deserve it   By doing as I wish in all respects.    MARIANE   To do so is the height of my ambition.    ORGON   Excellent well. What say you of--Tartuffe?    MARIANE   Who? I?    ORGON   Yes, you. Look to it how you answer.    MARIANE   Why! I'll say of him--anything you please.      SCENE II    ORGON, MARIANE, DORINE (coming in quietly and standing behind   Orgon, so that he does not see her)     ORGON   Well spoken. A good girl. Say then, my daughter,   That all his person shines with noble merit,   That he has won your heart, and you would like   To have him, by my choice, become your husband.   Eh?    MARIANE   Eh?    ORGON   What say you?    MARIANE   Please, what did you say?    ORGON   What?    MARIANE   Surely I mistook you, sir?    ORGON   How now?    MARIANE   Who is it, father, you would have me say   Has won my heart, and I would like to have   Become my husband, by your choice?    ORGON   Tartuffe.    MARIANE   But, father, I protest it isn't true!   Why should you make me tell this dreadful lie?    ORGON   Because I mean to have it be the truth.   Let this suffice for you: I've settled it.    MARIANE   What, father, you would ... ?    ORGON   Yes, child, I'm resolved   To graft Tartuffe into my family.   So he must be your husband. That I've settled.   And since your duty ..    (Seeing Dorine)   What are you doing there?   Your curiosity is keen, my girl,   To make you come eavesdropping on us so.    DORINE   Upon my word, I don't know how the rumour   Got started--if 'twas guess-work or mere chance   But I had heard already of this match,   And treated it as utter stuff and nonsense.    ORGON   What! Is the thing incredible?    DORINE   So much so   I don't believe it even from yourself, sir.    ORGON   I know a way to make you credit it.    DORINE   No, no, you're telling us a fairly tale!    ORGON   I'm telling you just what will happen shortly.    DORINE   Stuff!    ORGON   Daughter, what I say is in good earnest.    DORINE   There, there, don't take your father seriously;   He's fooling.    ORGON   But I tell you ...    DORINE   No. No use.   They won't believe you.    ORGON   If I let my anger ...    DORINE   Well, then, we do believe you; and the worse   For you it is. What! Can a grown-up man   With that expanse of beard across his face   Be mad enough to want ...?    ORGON   You hark me:   You've taken on yourself here in this house   A sort of free familiarity   That I don't like, I tell you frankly, girl.    DORINE   There, there, let's not get angry, sir, I beg you.   But are you making game of everybody?   Your daughter's not cut out for bigot's meat;   And he has more important things to think of.   Besides, what can you gain by such a match?   How can a man of wealth, like you, go choose   A wretched vagabond for son-in-law?    ORGON   You hold your tongue. And know, the less he has,   The better cause have we to honour him.   His poverty is honest poverty;   It should exalt him more than worldly grandeur,   For he has let himself be robbed of all,   Through careless disregard of temporal things   And fixed attachment to the things eternal.   My help may set him on his feet again,   Win back his property--a fair estate   He has at home, so I'm informed--and prove him   For what he is, a true-born gentleman.    DORINE   Yes, so he says himself. Such vanity   But ill accords with pious living, sir.   The man who cares for holiness alone   Should not so loudly boast his name and birth;   The humble ways of genuine devoutness   Brook not so much display of earthly pride.   Why should he be so vain? ... But I offend you:   Let's leave his rank, then,--take the man himself:   Can you without compunction give a man   Like him possession of a girl like her?   Think what a scandal's sure to come of it!   Virtue is at the mercy of the fates,   When a girl's married to a man she hates;   The best intent to live an honest woman   Depends upon the husband's being human,   And men whose brows are pointed at afar   May thank themselves their wives are what they are.   For to be true is more than woman can,   With husbands built upon a certain plan;   And he who weds his child against her will   Owes heaven account for it, if she do ill.   Think then what perils wait on your design.    ORGON (to Mariane)   So! I must learn what's what from her, you see!    DORINE   You might do worse than follow my advice.    ORGON   Daughter, we can't waste time upon this nonsense;   I know what's good for you, and I'm your father.   True, I had promised you to young Valere;   But, first, they tell me he's inclined to gamble,   And then, I fear his faith is not quite sound.   I haven't noticed that he's regular   At church.    DORINE   You'd have him run there just when you do.   Like those who go on purpose to be seen?    ORGON   I don't ask your opinion on the matter.   In short, the other is in Heaven's best graces,   And that is riches quite beyond compare.   This match will bring you every joy you long for;   'Twill be all steeped in sweetness and delight.   You'll live together, in your faithful loves,   Like two sweet children, like two turtle-doves;   You'll never fail to quarrel, scold, or"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2028"],["title","The Yellow Claw (#1)"],["body","itor.  She dropped her arms and fell back upon the chesterfield, insensible.     II  MIDNIGHT AND MR. KING   Leroux clutched at the corner of the writing-table to steady himself and stood there looking at the deathly face. Under the most favorable circumstances, he was no man of action, although in common with the rest of his kind he prided himself upon the possession of that presence of mind which he lacked. It was a situation which could not have alarmed “Martin Zeda,” but it alarmed, immeasurably, nay, struck inert with horror, Martin Zeda's creator.  Then, in upon Leroux's mental turmoil, a sensible idea intruded itself.  “Dr. Cumberly!” he muttered. “I hope to God he is in!”  Without touching the recumbent form upon the chesterfield, without seeking to learn, without daring to learn, if she lived or had died, Leroux, the tempo of his life changed to a breathless gallop, rushed out of the study, across the entrance hail, and, throwing wide the flat door, leapt up the stair to the flat above--that of his old friend, Dr. Cumberly.  The patter of the slippered feet grew faint upon the stair; then, as Leroux reached the landing above, became inaudible altogether.  In Leroux's study, the table-clock ticked merrily on, seeming to hasten its ticking as the hand crept around closer and closer to midnight. The mosaic shade of the lamp mingled reds and blues and greens upon the white ceiling above and poured golden light upon the pages of manuscript strewn about beneath it. This was a typical work-room of a literary man having the ear of the public--typical in every respect, save for the fur-clad figure outstretched upon the settee.  And now the peeping light indiscreetly penetrated to the hem of a silken garment revealed by some disarrangement of the civet fur. To the eye of an experienced observer, had such an observer been present in Henry Leroux's study, this billow of silk and lace behind the sheltering fur must have proclaimed itself the edge of a night-robe, just as the ankle beneath had proclaimed itself to Henry Leroux's shocked susceptibilities to be innocent of stocking.  Thirty seconds were wanted to complete the cycle of the day, when one of the listless hands thrown across the back of the chesterfield opened and closed spasmodically. The fur at the bosom of the midnight visitor began rapidly to rise and fall.  Then, with a choking cry, the woman struggled upright; her hair, hastily dressed, burst free of its bindings and poured in gleaming cascade down about her shoulders.  Clutching with one hand at her cloak in order to keep it wrapped about her, and holding the other blindly before her, she rose, and with that same odd, groping movement, began to approach the writing-table. The pupils of her eyes were mere pin-points now; she shuddered convulsively, and her skin was dewed with perspiration. Her breath came in agonized gasps.  “God!--I... am dying... and I cannot--tell him!” she breathed.  Feverishly, weakly, she took up a pen, and upon a quarto page, already half filled with Leroux's small, neat, illegible writing, began to scrawl a message, bending down, one hand upon the table, and with her whole body shaking.  Some three or four wavering lines she had written, when intimately, for the flat of Henry Leroux in Palace Mansions lay within sight of the clock-face--Big Ben began to chime midnight.  The writer started back and dropped a great blot of ink upon the paper; then, realizing the cause of the disturbance, forced herself to continue her task.  The chime being completed: ONE! boomed the clock; TWO!... THREE! ... FOUR!...  The light in the entrance-hall went out!  FIVE! boomed Big Ben;--SIX!... SEVEN!...  A hand, of old ivory hue, a long, yellow, clawish hand, with part of a sinewy forearm, crept in from the black lobby through the study doorway and touched the electric switch!  EIGHT!...  The study was plunged in darkness!  Uttering a sob--a cry of agony and horror that came from her very soul--the woman stood upright and turned to face toward the door, clutching the sheet of paper in one rigid hand.  Through the leaded panes of the window above the writing-table swept a silvern beam of moonlight. It poured, searchingly, upon the fur-clad figure swaying by the table; cutting through the darkness of the room like some huge scimitar, to end in a pallid pool about the woman's shadow on the center of the Persian carpet.  Coincident with her sobbing cry--NINE! boomed Big Ben; TEN!...  Two hands--with outstretched, crooked, clutching fingers--leapt from the darkness into the light of the moonbeam.  “God! Oh, God!” came a frenzied, rasping shriek--“MR. KING!”  Straight at the bare throat leapt the yellow hands; a gurgling cry rose--fell--and died away.  Gently, noiselessly, the lady of the civet fur sank upon the carpet by the table; as she fell, a dim black figure bent over her. The tearing of paper told of the note being snatched from her frozen grip; but never for a moment did the face or the form of her assailant encroach upon the moonbeam.  Batlike, this second and terrible visitant avoided the light.  The deed had occupied so brief a time that but one note of the great bell had accompanied it.  TWELVE! rang out the final stroke from the clock-tower. A low, eerie whistle, minor, rising in three irregular notes and falling in weird, unusual cadence to silence again, came from somewhere outside the room.  Then darkness--stillness--with the moon a witness of one more ghastly crime.  Presently, confused and intermingled voices from above proclaimed the return of Leroux with the doctor. They were talking in an excited key, the voice of Leroux, especially, sounding almost hysterical. They created such a disturbance that they attracted the attention of Mr. John Exel, M. P., occupant of the flat below, who at that very moment had returned from the House and was about to insert the key in the lock of his door. He looked up the stairway, but, all being in darkness, was unable to detect anything. Therefore he called out:--  “Is that you, Leroux? Is anything the matter?”  “Matter, Exel!” cried Leroux; “there's a devil of a business! For mercy's sake, come up!”  His curiosity greatly excited, Mr. Exel mounted the stairs, entering the lobby of Leroux's flat immediately behind the owner and Dr. Cumberly--who, like Leroux, was arrayed in a dressing-gown; for he had been in bed when summoned by his friend.  “You are all in the dark, here,” muttered Dr. Cumberly, fumbling for the switch.  “Some one has turned the light out!” whispered Leroux, nervously; “I left it on.”  Dr. Cumberly pressed the switch, turning up the lobby light as Exel entered from the landing. Then Leroux, entering the study first of the three, switched on the light there, also.  One glance he threw about the room, then started back like a man physically stricken.  “Cumberly!” he gasped, “Cumberly”--and he pointed to the furry heap by the writing-table.  “You said she lay on the chesterfield,” muttered Cumberly.  “I left her there.”...  Dr. Cumberly crossed the room and dropped upon his knees. He turned the white face toward the light, gently parted the civet fur, and pressed his ear to the silken covering of the breast. He started slightly and looked into the glazing eyes.  Replacing the fur which he had disarranged, the physician stood up and fixed a keen gaze upon the face of Henry Leroux. The latter swallowed noisily, moistening his parched lips.  “Is she”... he muttered; “is she”...  “God's mercy, Leroux!” whispered Mr. Exel--“what does this mean?”  “The woman is dead,” said Dr. Cumberly.  In common with all medical men, Dr. Cumberly was a physiognomist; he was a great physician and a proportionately great physiognomist. Therefore, when he looked into Henry Leroux's eyes, he saw there, and recognized, horror and consternation. With no further evidence than that furnished by his own powers of perception, he knew that the mystery of this woman's death was as inexplicable to Henry Leroux as it was inexplicable to himself.  He was a masterful man, with the gray eyes of a diplomat, and he knew Leroux as did few men. He laid both hands upon the novelist's shoulders.  “Brace up, old chap!” he said; “you will want all your wits about you.”  “I left her,” began Leroux, hesitatingly--“I left”...  “We know all about where you left her, Leroux,” interrupted Cumberly; “but what we want to get at is this: what occurred between the time you left her, and the time of our return?”  Exel, who had walked across to the table, and with a horror-stricken face was gingerly examining the victim, now exclaimed:--  “Why! Leroux! she is--she is... UNDRESSED!”  Leroux clutched at his dishevelled hair with both hands.  “My dear Exel!” he cried--“my dear, good man! Why do you use that tone? You say 'she is undressed!' as though I were responsible for the poor soul's condition!”  “On the contrary, Leroux!” retorted Exel, standing very upright, and staring through his monocle; “on the contrary, YOU misconstrue ME! I did not intend to imply--to insinuate--”  “My dear Exel!” broke in Dr. Cumberly--“Leroux is perfectly well aware that you intended nothing unkindly. But the poor chap, quite naturally, is distraught at the moment. You MUST understand that, man!”  “I understand; and I am sorry,” said Exel, casting a sidelong glance at the body. “Of course, it is a delicate subject. No doubt Leroux can explain.”...  “Damn your explanation!” shrieked Leroux hysterically. “I CANNOT explain! If I could explain, I”...  “Leroux!” said Cumberly, placing his arm paternally about the shaking man--“you are such a nervous subject. DO make an effort, old fellow. Pull yourself together. Exel does not know the circumstances--”  “I am curious to learn them,” said the M. P. icily.  Leroux was about to launch some angry retort, but Cumberly forced him into the chesterfield, and crossing to a bureau, poured out a stiff peg of brandy from a decanter which stood there. Leroux sank upon the"]]]
