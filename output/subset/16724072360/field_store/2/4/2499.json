Ross picked up the terrier and heaved him into the boat. Rex gave a snort of satisfaction, shook himself so that he sent a trundling spray of water clear in his master's face and then took his post in the bow of the boat and set himself to barking with all his might and main. It seemed almost as though he really knew that he was at the head of a rescue expedition and wanted to convey the information. When at last Rex ceased barking, which was not for some minutes, Ross gave a shout.  Instantly, at one of the upper windows, something white appeared. In the darkness the boy could not tell what it might be, but he guessed, and rightly, that it was Anton's shirt, and he heard again, though faintly, the answering call across the river.  \"Keep up your nerve, Anton,\" he yelled, through the storm, \"I'll be over there in a minute.\"  Faintly, again, came the answering cry,  \"Hello, Ross! Is that you? I wondered who it was that was coming.\"  The slow progress made by shoving the boat along, however, was not at all to Rex's liking. He turned and looked at his master doubtfully, then barked again. To his disgust, in turn, the boy found that the slope of the hollow curved away from the house a great deal. He was tempted, time after time, to jump into the boat and pull straight across, but he knew that if the force of the current drifted him below the house, he could never hope to go upstream against it. His only chance was to make sure that he could reach the middle of the torrent above the house and drift right down upon it. A few yards' extra leeway would enable him to steer his cranky craft to the desired spot. So, though it seemed to him as if he were going away from Anton, and though, indeed, he was now so far away that the crippled boy's shouts no longer could be heard, Ross stuck to his intentions, and, still wading, pushed the little craft up-stream.  Rex protested vigorously. He ran back from the bow and looked into Ross's face with a reproachful and almost angry bark, as much as to say:  \"You silly! Can't you tell what I brought you here for?\"  The boy knew better than the dog.  \"Lie down!\" he ordered sharply.  Rex, understanding in a doggish way that he was in the wrong somewhere, went back to his post in the bow, where he stood dejectedly, his tail no longer at the jaunty angle than it had been before.  At last Ross felt that he had reached a point high enough up the flooded bank to justify him in the attempt to get across. He jumped into the home-made skiff, and, setting his strength to the clumsy oars, began to pull with all his might.  He had not over-estimated the force of the current. As the light craft got into the swirl, the black water caught it like a feather. Ross pulled with all his might, but the banks slipped by as though he were in tow of one of the river steamboats. Never had the boy tugged at a pair of oars as he did now, and never had he so wished for a good boat and for real oars. He was only two-thirds of the distance across to the house when it came into sight, only a little distance below him.  He would not reach it!  With the energy of despair, Ross tugged on his oars, every muscle of his body tense with the strain.  Rex, divining the struggle, stood silent, not looking forward over the bow as he had been doing, but watching his master as he toiled with his oars.  Then, out from the darkness, shot the long black menace of a floating tree trunk. Straight for the boat it sped.  From the window, now close at hand, came a cry:  \"Look out, Ross! Look out!\"  Ross saw the danger. He knew, if he backed water, or halted long enough to let the tree go by, he would infallibly be swept past the house and all hope of rescuing Anton would be gone. He saw, too, that if the tree struck the frail boat, it would sink it as a battleship's ram sinks a fishing-boat in a fog at sea. He might win through, but if it struck--  The oars creaked with the sudden strain thrown on them.  On came the tree, but, just as it was about to strike the boat, it checked and turned half over, as the projecting stump of a broken bough caught on the ground below. For an instant, only, the tree halted and began to swing.  The halt gave a moment's respite, one more chance for an extra pull with the oars. The big log, thus poised, made a backwater eddy on the surface of the river, checking the force of the current. Ross reached back for another stroke, with every ounce of his muscle behind it.  The tree turned over sullenly and charged down the river anew. Yet that brief pause, that second of delay, that back-water ripple as the log hung in suspension, had given Ross just the advantage that was needed. The branches of the upper part of the tree swept round, one of them catching the stern of the boat and almost pulling it under. Peril had been near, but victory was nearer. The bow of the boat touched the wall of the house.  The current, swirling around the rocking walls, carried the boat to the lee of the house, and, as it spun round, Ross leaped on to the porch, chest-deep in water, and took a quick turn with the boat's painter around the corner post of the porch.  The torrent took his feet from under him, and swept him down-stream, floating, but Ross held a firm grip on the rope and dragged himself back. There, clasping the post tightly, he got back his breath. After a moment's groping he found the railing of the porch. By standing on this and holding fast to the corner post, he was, for the moment, out of danger.  He had reached the house, but how was Anton to be rescued?  The crippled boy was on the second story and the upper window could not be reached from the boat, even if the boat could have been held in place directly under it. Fortunately, Ross knew the arrangements of his chum's house as well as he did those of his own. Stepping gingerly along the porch railing, he came close to the window of the sitting room. The glass was still in the window frame, but as the front door was swinging wide open, though partly choked with débris, Ross knew that the sitting room must be full of water. He kicked the glass out and then, with a heavier kick, broke away the middle part of the window-sash. The water did not come quite to the top of the window frame, sure evidence that there was room for air between the water and the ceiling.  Taking a long breath, but with his heart knocking against his ribs, Ross dived through the broken window. It is one thing to be able to swim and dive, it is another to plunge through a splintered window-frame into a dark house in the middle of the night, with a flood roaring on all sides.  Was the door into the hall open? On that, success depended.  The boy turned sharply to the left as he came up to the surface and took breath. His hand struck the top of the door jamb. The door was open, but the casing was only three inches above the water. Ross dived again through the door, and, under water, turned to the right. One swimming stroke brought him to the staircase and he rushed up the few steps at the top to the room above.  There, by the light of a single candle, he saw Anton, his eager eyes shining out of his pale face. The crippled boy hobbled across the room on his crutch and grasped his chum tightly by the shoulder. He was trembling like an aspen-leaf in the wind.  \"Scared, Anton?\" said Ross. \"I'm not surprised. You've a good right to be.\"  \"I wasn't so scared,\" the younger lad replied, with the characteristic desire of a boy not to be thought cowardly, \"I just got to wondering, that was all.\"  \"Wondering if any one was going to come for you?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"How did you get left behind, anyhow?\" queried Ross.  \"Oh, it was my own fault, all right,\" the crippled lad replied. \"It was all because of the dog. You know, Ross, Lassie had pups, last Monday.\"  \"No, I didn't know about it,\" responded the older boy. \"Why didn't you tell a fellow?\"  \"I haven't seen you since,\" Anton explained. \"Well, when the levee broke and the water commenced to come into the house, Dad and Uncle Jack went and got the two boats we always keep on the river. Dad picked me up and carried me down on to the porch. I heard him call to Uncle Jack:  \"'You go ahead and get Clara; I've got Anton safe with me.'\"  \"Then you were with him, weren't you?\" queried Ross.  \"Sure I was. Just as I was getting into the boat, though, I thought of Lassie and her puppies and I went back to get them. I called to Dad and said:  \"'I'm just going to fetch Lassie, Dad, and I'll go in Uncle Jack's boat.'  \"So, Dad, he called to Uncle, saying that I was to go with him. His boat was pretty well crowded up, too. Back I went to get Lassie. As soon as I'd picked up the pups, Lassie was willing enough to come along. The water was running over the floor and made it slippery. My crutch slithered on the wet wood and I tumbled down. It was pretty dark, and I had a job finding the four puppies again. When I did gather 'em up and started for the porch again, Uncle Jack was gone.\"  \"Without you?\"  \"He thought I was with Dad, and I suppose Dad was sure I was with Uncle Jack.\"  \"They ought to have found out and come back after you as soon as they got together.\"  \"I thought of that,\" the crippled lad answered, \"and that's what I expected would happen. I suppose, though, they didn't land at the same place, and so each bunch thinks I'm with the other and isn't doing any worrying.\"  \"It's a mighty awkward mix-up,\" declared Ross. \"There's no saying what might have happened to you if Rex hadn't been on the job.\"  \"Was it Rex who brought you here?\"  \"It sure was,\" Ross replied, and he described how the terrier had pulled him by the leg and insisted on his coming over to the house in the hollow.  \"Where's Rex now,\" queried Anton, \"down in our old boat?\"  \"Yes, he's down there, keeping watch, good old scout,\" answered Ross. \"He ought to be satisfied now, he certainly made fuss enough to bring me here.

Regarding the distances in the stellar system the astronomers have had a varying practice. German astronomers, SEELIGER and others, have long used a stellar unit of distance corresponding to an annual parallax of 0″.2, which has been called a “Siriusweite”. To this name it may be justly objected that it has no international use, a great desideratum in science. Against the theoretical definition of this unit it may also be said that a distance is suitably to be defined through another distance and not through an angle--an angle which corresponds moreover, in this case, to the _harmonic_ mean distance of the star and not to its arithmetic mean distance. The same objection may be made to the unit “parsec.” proposed in 1912 by TURNER.  For my part I have, since 1911, proposed a stellar unit which, both in name and definition, nearly coincides with the proposition of SEELIGER, and which will be exclusively used in these lectures. A _siriometer_ is put equal to 10^6 times the planetary unit of distance, corresponding to a parallax of 0″.206265 (in practice sufficiently exactly 0″.2).  In popular writings, another unit: a _light-year_, has for a very long time been employed. The relation between these units is      1 siriometer = 15.79   light-years,     1 light-year =  0.0633 siriometers.   5. In regard to _time_ also, the terrestrial units (second, day, year) are too small for stellar wants. As being consistent with the unit of distance, I have proposed for the stellar unit of time a _stellar year_ (st.), corresponding to 10^6 years. We thus obtain the same relation between the stellar and the planetary units of length and time, which has the advantage that a _velocity_ of a star expressed in siriometers per stellar year is expressed with the same numerals in planetary units of length per year.  Spectroscopic determinations of the velocities, through the DOPPLER-principle, are generally expressed in km. per second. The relation with the stellar unit is the following:      1 km./sec. = 0.2111 sir./st.,                = 0.2111 planetary units per year,     1 sir./st. = 4.7375 km./sec.  Thus the velocity of the sun is 20 km./sec. or 4.22 sir./st. (= 4.22 earth distances from the sun per year).  Of the numerical value of the stellar velocity we shall have opportunity to speak in the following. For the present it may suffice to mention that most stars have a velocity of the same degree as that of the sun (in the mean somewhat greater), and that the highest observed velocity of a star amounts to 72 sir./st. (= 340 km./sec.). In the next chapter I give a table containing the most speedy stars. The least value of the stellar velocity is evidently equal to zero.   6. _Intensity of the radiation._ This varies within wide limits. The faintest star which can give an impression on the photographic plates of the greatest instrument of the Mount Wilson observatory (100 inch reflector) is nearly 100 million times fainter than Sirius, a star which is itself more than 10000 million times fainter than the sun--speaking of apparent radiation.  The intensity is expressed in _magnitudes_ (_m_). The reason is partly that we should otherwise necessarily have to deal with very large numbers, if they were to be proportional to the intensity, and partly that it is proved that the human eye apprehends quantities of light as proportional to _m_.  This depends upon a general law in psycho-physics, known as FECHNER's _law_, which says that changes of the apparent impression of light are proportional not to the changes of the intensity but to these changes divided by the primitive intensity. A similar law is valid for all sensations. A conversation is inaudible in the vicinity of a waterfall. An increase of a load in the hand from nine to ten hectograms makes no great difference in the feeling, whereas an increase from one to two hectograms is easily appreciable. A match lighted in the day-time makes no increase in the illumination, and so on.  A mathematical analysis shows that from the law of FECHNER it follows that the impression increases in _arithmetical_ progression (1, 2, 3, 4, ...) simultaneously with an increase of the intensity in _geometrical_ progression (_I_, _I_^2, _I_^3, _I_^4, ...). It is with the sight the same as with the hearing. It is well known that the numbers of vibrations of the notes of a harmonic scale follow each other in a geometrical progression though, for the ear, the intervals between the notes are apprehended as equal. The magnitudes play the same rôle in relation to the quantities of light as do the logarithms to the corresponding numbers. If a star is considered to have a brightness intermediate between two other stars it is not the _difference_ but the _ratio_ of the quantities of light that is equal in each case.  The branch of astronomy (or physics) which deals with intensities of radiation is called _photometry_. In order to determine a certain scale for the magnitudes we must choose, in a certain manner, the _zero-point_ of the scale and the _scale-ratio_.  Both may be chosen arbitrarily. The _zero-point_ is now almost unanimously chosen by astronomers in accordance with that used by the Harvard Observatory. No rigorous definition of the Harvard zero-point, as far as I can see, has yet been given (compare however H. A. 50[3]), but considering that the Pole-star (α Ursæ Minoris) is used at Harvard as a fundamental star of comparison for the brighter stars, and that, according to the observations at Harvard and those of HERTZSPRUNG (A. N. 4518 [1911]), the light of the Pole-star is very nearly invariable, we may say that _the zero-point of the photometric scale is chosen in such a manner that for the Pole-star _m_ = 2.12_. If the magnitudes are given in another scale than the Harvard-scale (H. S.), it is necessary to apply the zero-point correction. This amounts, for the Potsdam catalogue, to -0m.16.  It is further necessary to determine the _scale-ratio_. Our magnitudes for the stars emanate from PTOLEMY. It was found that the scale-ratio--giving the ratio of the light-intensities of two consecutive classes of magnitudes--according to the older values of the magnitudes, was approximately equal to 2½. When exact photometry began (with instruments for measuring the magnitudes) in the middle of last century, the scale-ratio was therefore put equal to 2.5. Later it was found more convenient to choose it equal to 2.512, the logarithm of which number has the value 0.4. The magnitudes being themselves logarithms of a kind, it is evidently more convenient to use a simple value of the logarithm of the ratio of intensity than to use this ratio itself. This scale-ratio is often called the POGSON-scale (used by POGSON in his “Catalogue of 53 known variable stars”, Astr. Obs. of the Radcliffe Observatory, 1856), and is now exclusively used.  It follows from the definition of the scale-ratio that two stars for which the light intensities are in the ratio 100:1 differ by exactly 5 magnitudes. A star of the 6th magnitude is 100 times fainter than a star of the first magnitude, a star of the 11th magnitude 10000 times, of the 16th magnitude a million times, and a star of the 21st magnitude 100 million times fainter than a star of the first magnitude. The star magnitudes are now, with a certain reservation for systematic errors, determined with an accuracy of 0m.1, and closer. Evidently, however, there will correspond to an error of 0.1 in the magnitude a considerable uncertainty in the light ratios, when these differ considerably from each other.      Sun         -26m.60     Full moon   -11m.77     Venus       - 4m.28     Jupiter     - 2m.35     Mars        - 1m.79     Mercury     - 0m.90     Saturn      + 0m.88     Uranus      + 5m.86     Neptune     + 7m.66  A consequence of the definition of _m_ is that we also have to do with _negative_ magnitudes (as well as with negative logarithms). Thus, for example, for _Sirius_ _m_ = -1.58. The magnitudes of the greater planets, as well as those of the moon and the sun, are also negative, as will be seen from the adjoining table, where the values are taken from “Die Photometrie der Gestirne” by G. MÜLLER.  The apparent magnitude of the sun is given by ZÖLLNER (1864). The other values are all found in Potsdam, and allude generally to the maximum value of the apparent magnitude of the moon and the planets.  The brightest star is _Sirius_, which has the magnitude _m_ = -1.58. The magnitude of the faintest visible star evidently depends on the penetrating power of the instrument used. The telescope of WILLIAM HERSCHEL, used by him and his son in their star-gauges and other stellar researches, allowed of the discerning of stars down to the 14th magnitude. The large instruments of our time hardly reach much farther, for visual observations. When, however, photographic plates are used, it is easily possible to get impressions of fainter stars, even with rather modest instruments. The large 100-inch mirror of the Wilson Observatory renders possible the photographic observations of stars of the 20th apparent magnitude, and even fainter.  The observations of visual magnitudes are performed almost exclusively with the photometer of ZÖLLNER in a more or less improved form.   7. _Absolute magnitude._ The apparent magnitude of a star is changed as the star changes its distance from the observer, the intensity increasing indirectly as the square of the distance of the star. In order to make the magnitudes of the stars comparable with each other it is convenient to reduce them to their value at a certain unit of distance. As such we choose one siriometer. The corresponding magnitude will be called the _absolute_ magnitude and is denoted by _M_.[4] We easily find from the table given in the preceding paragraph that the absolute magnitude of the sun, according to ZÖLLNER's value of _m_, amounts to +3.4, of the moon to +31.2. For Jupiter we find "]]]
