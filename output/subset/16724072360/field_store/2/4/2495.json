This quaint old house had been purchased by Mrs Brown's grandmother, mother of the laird of Grandholm, and at the beginning of the century was inhabited by her maiden daughter Margaret, or, as she was oftener called, Peggy Paton. This lady lived to the age of ninety, and at her death left her house and fortune to her niece and name-daughter, Margaret Paton (Mrs Brown), who in her turn adopted a grand-niece, the daughter already mentioned of Dr Burton's eldest brother, William,--the same who, having nursed her aged aunt till her death, in the last year of his life so tenderly ministered to her uncle, the subject of this notice.  The second in the line of female owners of the old house, Peggy Paton, was, for the outer world, what George Eliot calls \"a charicter\"--one of those distinguishing features of country-town life which the march of improvement has swept away: a lady by birth, but owing little to schools or teachers, books or travel: a woman of strong natural understanding and some wit, who loved her nightly rubber at whist, could rap out an oath or a strong pleasantry, and whose quick estimates of men and things became proverbs with the younger generation.  For her inner circle Peggy Paton was a most motherly old maid. She it was who, when she found her niece Eliza _would_ marry Lieutenant Burton, mediated between father and daughter, and arranged matters as well as might be in an affair in which her good sense found much to disapprove, and her heart much to excuse. Not only to her niece Margaret, her adopted daughter, but also to her other nieces at Grandholm, motherless by death, and fatherless by desertion, did she fill a mother's part as far as these robust virgins would permit her. Sister Eliza's rough little children, or rougher great boys, always found kindness in the house in the Old Town, first in their grand-aunt's[4] time, and afterwards in that of her successor, Mrs Brown. David, Dr Burton's younger brother, was lovingly tended by them during part of the lingering illness of which he died, and the youngest of Eliza Paton's sons remained an inmate of Mrs Brown's house that he might continue his education in Aberdeen, when his mother removed to Edinburgh.  [Footnote 4: It may not be counted indelicate, as it refers to a period 120 years gone by, to mention that Peggy Paton once had a lover, and that this, her first lover, was no other than the son of that Moir of Stoneywood, whose correspondence is so frequently quoted in Dr Burton's 'History of Scotland.' The young man was Peggy's first cousin, the lairds of Grandholm and Stoneywood having married sisters--Mackenzie by name. The laird of Stoneywood is known to posterity by his ingenious achievement of ferrying the rebel army across the Dornoch Firth in small fishing-boats collected by Stoneywood all along the coast. On the defeat of the Pretender, and the suppression of the insurrection in 1746, Stoneywood's estate was confiscated, and he fled to the Continent. Family tradition adds that his escape was achieved by his disguising himself as a miller and swimming across the Don from Stoneywood to Grandholm, where the laird of Grandholm, who was of opposite politics, had removed the ferry-boat, and saw but did not denounce his kinsman. The houses of Grandholm and Stoneywood are exactly opposite each other on the two sides of the Don. Mrs Moir of Stoneywood did not immediately follow her husband, but remained with her friends to bring up her children, among them Miss Peggy's lover, who, soon after his engagement to her, joined his father on the Continent and there died.]  For those who do not know Aberdeen, it may be proper to say that _Old_ Aberdeen is as entirely distinct from New Aberdeen as Edinburgh is from Leith--in a different way. The distance between them is somewhat greater, about two miles; and whereas New Aberdeen is a highly prosperous commercial city, as entirely devoid of beauty or interest as any city under the sun, Old Aberdeen is a sweet, still, little place, hardly more than a village in size, in appearance utterly unlike any other place in Scotland, resembling a little English cathedral town,--the towers and spires of college and cathedral beautifully seen through ancient trees from the windows of Miss Peggy Paton's old house, to which that managing lady added a wing, and which possessed a good flower and fruit garden, wherein grew plenty of gooseberries, ever Dr Burton's favourite fruit. His birthday, 22d August, was, during his mother's life, always celebrated by a family feast of them.  Such were the scenes and circumstances of Dr Burton's childhood and early youth. As he grew old enough to begin those long walks which to the end were the great pleasure of his life, he made acquaintance with the beautiful scenery of the Upper Dee and Don. In holiday time his mother used to give him a small sum of money, at most one pound, and allow him to travel as far as the amount would take him. His legs were almost always his only conveyance; throughout his life he entertained an aversion to either riding or driving. His temper was too impatient, too energetic, to allow him to enjoy progress without exertion. After railways existed he sometimes used them in aid of his walking power; but all horse vehicles were odious to him, partly by reason of an excessive tenderness for animals. He could not bear to see a horse whipped, or any living creature subjected to bodily pain.  Wonderful are the accounts the writer has heard of the duration of that holiday pound: how Dr Burton and sometimes a chosen companion would subsist day after day on twopence-worth of oatmeal, that by so doing they might travel the farther; or how, having improvidently finished their supply, they would walk some incredible distance without any food at all, till they reached either their home or the house of some friend.  In these holiday rambles Dr Burton made the acquaintance of several families either more or less related to him through his Grandholm kindred, or willing, in the old Scotch fashion, to extend hospitality to any wayfarer who needed it. In this way Dr Burton has described himself as the guest of Mrs Gordon at Abergeldie, who, as he said, made a request that when he came to visit her he would if possible arrive before midnight. Invercauld, Glenkindie, Tough, and many other country-houses, were visited in the same unceremonious way.  The letter here given was written to his mother during one of these holiday rambles, when its writer was about twenty, and describes some of the scenes of the wonderful flood of '29, so graphically described by Sir Thomas Dick Lauder. The Colonel H. was the son of Dr Burton's godfather, and a man of mature years at the time the Highlander and Dr Burton describe him as having \"run away.\" The writer can offer no explanation of this rather amusing passage in the letter: it might either be a mere joke or refer to some family quarrel of the Colonel's.       \"LAKEFIELD, _8th September 1829_.       \"MY DEAR MOTHER,--I have just arrived at Lakefield in the midst of      determined and ceaseless rain. I expected of course to meet A.H.      here, but it seems he ran away the other day, and will by this time      be in Aberdeen. He wrote to Mrs Grant from Elgin, but she has not      yet heard of his arrival in Aberdeen.       \"In my way here I ran a risk of being violently used for his sake.      As I was perambulating slowly the border of Loch Ness I met a tall,      gaunt-looking man, who eyed me rather suspiciously, and stretched      forth his hands in the attitude of one interrupting a stray sheep.      I looked at the being in my turn, and began to be a little      suspicious of his purpose, and to think of my dirk. The man      approached nearer still in the attitude of making a spring. When he      had come so close that I could hardly escape him, he roared out:      'Is't you 'at's the laad Colonel H. 'at's been runnan' awa'?' 'No,'      said I, 'I am not.'       \"The man continued to eye me rather suspiciously, and then went      slowly away. I suppose he hoped to be rewarded for me. I have told      you that I got rain. When I was proceeding to Huntly, as you are      aware, in the coach, there came two or three heavy gusts of wind      from the hills, carrying along with it a sort of soft drizzle, but      nothing like rain, and the roads appeared dry. After I had passed      Keith, however, the whole country had a drenched and draggled      appearance, the burns were swollen, the corn was hanging like wet      hair, the trees were drooping and black, and the country people      themselves looked as if they had been held in water for the last      six months. A heavy and unceasing rain came on. The clouds grew      black and seemed to settle, everything had a ghastly and dismal      appearance. I met a man, and asked him if it always rained here.      'Ou ay, sir,' replied he, 'it's the parish o' _Rayne_.' I was      content with the answer, and asked nothing more. In a condition you      may easily imagine, I reached Elgin and dried myself. The rain      stopped, but the clouds did not clear. I went and visited the      cathedral, and wandered about the ruins for an hour or two. It is a      noble and beautiful building, but I will not begin to speak about      it, as the post leaves in a few minutes. On Saturday afternoon I      left Elgin for Forres, with the hope of better weather. During the      walk I could hardly persuade myself I was out of Aberdeenshire, the      country is so very like, but it is rather flatter. Next morning was      clear and cloudless, and the sun shone bright over a country      drenched and covered with water. I wished that day to reach      Inverness, but a new difficulty appeared. I was told that the      Findhorn was so swollen that no mortal man could get across.

In's Bett mit euch, ihr Zärtlinge!     Nun rollen Donner über die Gewölbe,       nun zittert, was Gebälk und Mauer ist,     nun zucken Blitze und schwefelgelbe Wahrheiten--       Zarathustra flucht ...!_  For the following faithful and graceful translation the present commentator is indebted to Mr. Louis Untermeyer:       I      How long brood you now     On thy disaster?     Give heed! You hatch me soon       An egg,       From your long lamentation out of.       II      Why prowls Zarathustra among the mountains?      III      Distrustful, ulcerated, dismal,       A long waiter--     But suddenly a flash,       Brilliant, fearful. A lightning stroke     Leaps to heaven from the abyss:     --The mountains shake themselves and     Their intestines....       IV      As hate and lightning-flash       Are united, a _curse_!     On the mountains rages now Zarathustra's wrath,     Like a thunder cloud rolls it on its way.       V      Crawl away, ye who have a roof remaining!       To bed with you, ye tenderlings!     Now thunder rolls over the great arches,       Now tremble the bastions and battlements,     Now flashes palpitate and sulphur-yellow truths--     Zarathustra swears ...!  The composition is scored for three flutes, one piccolo, one bass piccolo, seven oboes, one English horn, three clarinets in D flat, one clarinet in G flat, one corno de bassetto, three bassoons, one contra-bassoon, eleven horns, three trumpets, eight cornets in B, four trombones, two alto trombones, one viol da gamba, one mandolin, two guitars, one banjo, two tubas, glockenspiel, bell, triangle, fife, bass-drum, cymbals, timpani, celesta, four harps, piano, harmonium, pianola, phonograph, and the usual strings.  At the opening a long B flat is sounded by the cornets, clarinets and bassoons in unison, with soft strokes upon a kettle-drum tuned to G sharp. After eighteen measures of this, _singhiozzando_, the strings enter _pizzicato_ with a figure based upon one of the scales of the ancient Persians--B flat, C flat, D, E sharp, G and A flat--which starts high among the first violins, and then proceeds downward, through the second violins, violas and cellos, until it is lost in solemn and indistinct mutterings in the double-basses. Then, the atmosphere of doom having been established, and the conductor having found his place in the score, there is heard the motive of brooding, or as the German commentators call it, the _Quälerei Motiv_:  [Illustration: Musical Score]  The opening chord of the eleventh is sounded by six horns, and the chords of the ninth, which follow, are given to the woodwind. The rapid figure in the second measure is for solo violin, heard softly against the sustained interval of the diminished ninth, but the final G natural is snapped out by the whole orchestra _sforzando_. There follows a rapid and daring development of the theme, with the flutes and violoncellos leading, first harmonized with chords of the eleventh, then with chords of the thirteenth, and finally with chords of the fifteenth. Meanwhile, the tonality has moved into D minor, then into A flat major, and then into G sharp minor, and the little arpeggio for the solo violin has been augmented to seven, to eleven, and in the end to twenty-three notes. Here the influence of Claude Debussy shows itself; the chords of the ninth proceed by the same chromatic semitones that one finds in the _Chansons de Bilitis_. But Kraus goes much further than Debussy, for the tones of his chords are constantly altered in a strange and extremely beautiful manner, and, as has been noted, he adds the eleventh, thirteenth and fifteenth. At the end of this incomparable passage there is a sudden drop to C major, followed by the first statement of the _Missgeschick Motiv_, or motive of disaster (misfortune, evil destiny, untoward fate):  [Illustration: Musical Score]  This graceful and ingratiating theme will give no concern to the student of Ravel and Schoenberg. It is, in fact, a quite elemental succession of intervals of the second, all produced by adding the ninth to the common chord--thus: C, G, C, D, E--with certain enharmonic changes. Its simplicity gives it, at a first hearing, a placid, pastoral aspect, somewhat disconcerting to the literalist, but the discerning will not fail to note the mutterings beneath the surface. It is first sounded by two violas and the viol da gamba, and then drops without change to the bass, where it is repeated _fortissimo_ by two bassoons and the contra-bassoon. The tempo then quickens and the two themes so far heard are worked up into a brief but tempestuous fugue. A brief extract will suffice to show its enormously complex nature:  [Illustration: Musical Score]  A pedal point on B flat is heard at the end of this fugue, sounded _fortissimo_ by all the brass in unison, and then follows a grand pause, twelve and a half measures in length. Then, in the strings, is heard the motive of warning:  [Illustration: Musical Score]  Out of this motive comes the harmonic material for much of what remains of the composition. At each repetition of the theme, the chord in the fourth measure is augmented by the addition of another interval, until in the end it includes every tone of the chromatic scale save C sharp. This omission is significant of Kraus' artistry. If C sharp were included the tonality would at once become vague, but without it the dependence of the whole gorgeous edifice upon C major is kept plain. At the end, indeed, the tonic chord of C major is clearly sounded by the wood-wind, against curious triplets, made up of F sharp, A flat and B flat in various combinations, in the strings; and from it a sudden modulation is made to C minor, and then to A flat major. This opens the way for the entrance of the motive of lamentation, or, as the German commentators call it, the _Schreierei Motiv_:  [Illustration: Musical Score]  This simple and lovely theme is first sounded, not by any of the usual instruments of the grand orchestra, but by a phonograph in B flat, with the accompaniment of a solitary trombone. When the composition was first played at the Gewandhaus in Leipzig the innovation caused a sensation, and there were loud cries of sacrilege and even proposals of police action. One indignant classicist, in token of his ire, hung a wreath of _Knackwürste_ around the neck of the bust of Johann Sebastian Bach in the Thomaskirche, and appended to it a card bearing the legend, _Schweinehund_! But the exquisite beauty of the effect soon won acceptance for the means employed to attain it, and the phonograph has so far made its way with German composers that Prof. Ludwig Grossetrommel, of Göttingen, has even proposed its employment in opera in place of singers.  This motive of lamentation is worked out on a grand scale, and in intimate association with the motives of brooding and of warning. Kraus is not content with the ordinary materials of composition. His creative force is always impelling him to break through the fetters of the diatonic scale, and to find utterance for his ideas in archaic and extremely exotic tonalities. The pentatonic scale is a favorite with him; he employs it as boldly as Wagner did in _Das Rheingold_. But it is not enough, for he proceeds from it into the Dorian mode of the ancient Greeks, and then into the Phrygian, and then into two of the plagal modes. Moreover, he constantly combines both unrelated scales and antagonistic motives, and invests the combinations in astounding orchestral colors, so that the hearer, unaccustomed to such bold experimentations, is quite lost in the maze. Here, for example, is a characteristic passage for solo French horn and bass piccolo:  [Illustration: Musical Score]  The dotted half notes for the horn obviously come from the motive of brooding, in augmentation, but the bass piccolo part is new. It soon appears, however, in various fresh aspects, and in the end it enters into the famous quadruple motive of \"sulphur-yellow truth\"--_schwefelgelbe Wahrheit_, as we shall presently see. Its first combination is with a jaunty figure in A minor, and the two together form what most of the commentators agree upon denominating the Zarathustra motive:  [Illustration: Musical Score]  I call this the Zarathustra motive, following the weight of critical opinion, but various influential critics dissent. Thus, Dr. Ferdinand Bierfisch, of the Hochschule für Musik at Dresden, insists that it is the theme of \"the elevated mood produced by the spiritual isolation and low barometric pressure of the mountains,\" while Prof. B. Moll, of Frankfurt a/M., calls it the motive of prowling. Kraus himself, when asked by Dr. Fritz Bratsche, of the Berlin _Volkszeitung_, shrugged his shoulders and answered in his native Hamburg dialect, \"_So gehts im Leben! 'S giebt gar kein Use_\"--Such is life; it gives hardly any use (to inquire?). In much the same way Schubert made reply to one who asked the meaning of the opening subject of the slow movement of his C major symphony: \"_Halt's Maul, du verfluchter Narr!_\"--Don't ask such question, my dear sir!  But whatever the truth, the novelty and originality of the theme cannot be denied, for it is in two distinct keys, D major and A minor, and they preserve their identity whenever it appears.
