Cuffy, nestling into his breast, placed his chin on his neck, and heaved a deep, contented sigh.  This was the last sound the sailor recognised, as he sank into profound repose.    CHAPTER TWO.  ISLAND LIFE.  There are few of the minor sweets of life more agreeable than to awake refreshed, and to become gradually impressed with the conviction that you are a perfectly free agent,--that you may rise when you choose, or lie still if you please, or do what you like, without let or hindrance.  So thought our hero, John Jarwin, when he awoke, on the same spot where he had thrown himself down, after several hours of life-giving slumber. He was still weak, but his weakness did not now oppress him.  The slight meal, the long draught, and the deep sleep, had restored enough of vigour to his naturally robust frame to enable him, while lying on his back, to enjoy his existence once more.  He was, on first awaking, in that happy condition of mind and body in which the former does not care to think and the latter does not wish to move--yet both are pleased to be largely conscious of their own identity.  That he had not moved an inch since he lay down, became somewhat apparent to Jarwin from the fact that Cuffy's chin still rested immovable on his neck, but his mind was too indolent to pursue the thought.  He had not the most remote idea as to where he was, but he cared nothing for that.  He was in absolute ignorance of the time of day, but he cared, if possible, still less for that.  Food, he knew, was necessary to his existence, but the thought gave him no anxiety.  In short, John and his dog were in a state of quiescent felicity, and would probably have remained so for some hours to come, had not the setting sun shone forth at that moment with a farewell gleam so intense, that it appeared to set the world of clouds overhead on fire, converting them into hills and dales, and towering domes and walls and battlements of molten glass and gold.  Even to the wearied seaman's sleepy vision the splendour of the scene became so fascinating, that he shook off his lethargy, and raised himself on one elbow.  \"Why, Cuffy!\" he exclaimed, to the yawning dog, \"seems to me that the heavens is a-fire!  Hope it won't come on dirty weather before you an' I get up somethin' in the shape o' a hut.  That minds me, doggie,\" he added, glancing slowly round him, \"that we must look after prokoorin' of our supper.  I do believe we've bin an' slep away a whole day!  Well, well, it don't much matter, seein' that we hain't got no dooty for to do--no trick at the wheel, no greasin' the masts--wust of all, no splicin' the main brace, and no grub.\"  This latter remark appeared to reach the understanding of the dog, for it uttered a melancholy howl as it gazed into its master's eyes.  \"Ah, Cuffy!\" continued the sailor with a sigh, \"you've good reason to yowl, for the half of a rotten fish ain't enough for a dog o' your appetite.  Come, let's see if we can't find somethin' more to our tastes.\"  Saying this the man rose, stretched himself, yawned, looked helplessly round for a few seconds, and then, with a cheery \"Hallo!  Cuff, come along, my hearty,\" went down to the beach in quest of food.  In this search he was not unsuccessful, for the beach abounded with shell-fish of various kinds; but Jarwin ate sparingly of these, having been impressed, in former years, by some stories which he had heard of shipwrecked sailors having been poisoned by shell-fish.  For the same reason he administered a moderate supply to Cuffy, telling him that \"it warn't safe wittles, an' that if they was to be pisoned, it was as well to be pisoned in moderation.\"  The dog, however, did not appear to agree with its master on this point, for it went picking up little tit-bits here and there, and selfishly ignoring the \"share-and-share-alike\" compact, until it became stuffed alarmingly, and could scarcely follow its master back to the fountain.  Arrived there, the two slaked their thirst together, and then Jarwin sat down to enjoy a pipe, and Cuffy lay down to suffer the well-merited reward of gluttony.  We have said that Jarwin sat down to enjoy a pipe, but he did _not_ enjoy it that night, for he discovered that the much-loved little implement, which he had cherished tenderly while on the raft, was broken to atoms in his coat-pocket!  In his eagerness to drink on first landing, he had thrown himself down on it, and now smoking was an impossibility, at least for that night.  He reflected, however, that it would not be difficult to make a wooden pipe, and that cigarettes might perhaps be made by means of leaves, or bark, while his tobacco lasted; so he consoled himself in the meantime with hopeful anticipations, and a quid.  Being still weak and weary, he lay down again beside the fountain, and almost immediately fell into a sleep, which was not at all disturbed by the starts and groans and frequent yelps of Cuffy, whose sufferings could scarcely have been more severe if he had supped on turtle-soup and venison, washed down with port and claret.  Thus did those castaways spend the first night on their island.  It must not be supposed, however, that we are going to trace thus minutely every step and sensation in the career of our unfortunate friends.  We have too much to tell that is important to devote our \"valuable space\" to everyday incidents.  Nevertheless, as it is important that our readers should understand our hero thoroughly, and the circumstances in which we find him, it is necessary that we should draw attention to some incidents--trifling in themselves, but important in their effects--which occurred to John Jarwin soon after his landing on the island.  The first of these incidents was, that John one day slipped his foot on a tangle-covered rock, and fell into the sea.  A small matter this, you will say, to a man who could swim, and in a climate so warm that a dip, with or without clothes, was a positive luxury.  Most true; and had the wetting been all, Jarwin would have had nothing to annoy him; for at the time the accident occurred he had been a week on the island, had managed to pull and crack many cocoa-nuts, and had found various excellent wild-fruits, so that his strength, as well as Cuffy's, had been much restored.  In fact, when Jarwin's head emerged from the brine, after his tumble, he gave vent to a shout of laughter, and continued to indulge in hilarious demonstrations all the time he was wringing the water out of his garments, while the terrier barked wildly round him.  But suddenly, in the very midst of a laugh, he became grave and pale,-- so pale, that a more obtuse creature than Cuffy might have deemed him ill.  While his mouth and eyes slowly opened wider and wider, his hands slapped his pockets, first his trousers, then his vest, then his coat, after which they fell like pistol-shots on his thighs, and he exclaimed, in a voice of horror--\"Gone!\"  Ay, there could be no doubt about it; every particle of his tobacco was gone!  It had never been much, only three or four plugs; but it was strong, and he had calculated that, what with careful husbanding, and mixing it with other herbs, it would last him for a considerable length of time.  In a state bordering on frenzy, the sailor rushed back to the rock from which he had fallen.  The \"baccy\" was not there.  He glanced right and left--no sign of it floating on the sea.  In he went, head foremost, like a determined suicide; down, down to the bottom, for he was an expert diver, and rioted among the coral groves, and horrified the fish, until he well-nigh burst, and rose to the surface with a groan and splutter that might have roused envy in a porpoise.  Then down he went again, while Cuffy stood on the shore regarding him with mute amazement.  Never did pearl-diver grope for the treasures of the deep with more eager intensity than did John Jarwin search for that lost tobacco.  He remained under water until he became purple in the face, and, coming to the surface after each dive, stayed only long enough to recharge his lungs with air.  How deeply he regretted at that time the fact that man's life depended on so frequent and regular a supply of atmospheric air!  How enviously he glanced at the fish which, with open eyes and mouths, appeared to regard him with inexpressible astonishment--as well they might!  At last Jarwin's powers of endurance began to give way, and he was compelled to return to the shore, to the great relief of Cuffy, which miserable dog, if it had possessed the smallest amount of reasoning power, must have deemed its master hopelessly insane.  \"But why so much ado about a piece of tobacco?\" we hear some lady-reader or non-smoker exclaim.  Just because our hero was, and had been since his childhood, an inveterate smoker.  Of course we cannot prove our opinion to be correct, but we are inclined to believe that if all the smoke that had issued from Jarwin's lips, from the period of his commencing down to that terrible day when he lost his last plug, could have been collected in one vast cloud, it would have been sufficient to have kept a factory chimney going for a month or six weeks.  The poor man knew his weakness. He had several times tried to get rid of the habit which had enslaved him, and, by failing, had come to know the tyrannical power of his master.  He had once been compelled by circumstances to forego his favourite indulgence for three entire days, and retained so vivid a recollection of his sufferings that he made up his mind never more to strive for freedom, but to enjoy his pipe as long as he lived--to swim with the current, in fact, and take it easy.  It was of no use that several men, who objected to smoking from principle, and had themselves gone through the struggle and come off victorious, pointed out that if he went on at his present rate, it would cut short his life.

He did so now--on the old stool.  \"You may call me what you please, Jeff.  It was your child-fancy to accord to me that honourable relationship; so you may continue it if you will.  How you are grown, too!  I could not have known you had I met you--so big, and with that horrible black beard.\"  \"Horrible!  Miss Millet?\"  \"Well, terrible, if you prefer it.  It's so bushy and unnatural for one so young.\"  \"That can hardly be, auntie,\" rejoined the youth, with a smile that sent quite a ripple down the objectionable beard, \"because my beard was provided by Nature.\"  \"Well, Jeff,\" returned the spinster promptly, \"were not scissors and razors provided by--no, it was art that provided _them_,\" she continued with a little smile of confusion; \"but they _are_ provided all the same, and--But we won't pursue that subject, for you men are incorrigible! Now tell me, Jeff, where you have been, and why you didn't come to see me sooner, and why your letters have been so few--though I admit they were long.\"  We will not inflict on the reader all the conversation that ensued. When Jeff had exhausted his narrative, Miss Millet discovered that it was tea-time; and, while engaged in preparations for the evening meal, she enlarged upon some of her projects, being encouraged thereto by Jeff, whose heart was naturally sympathetic.  \"But some of my projects are impossible,\" she said, with a little sigh. \"Some small things, indeed, I have accomplished, with God's blessing; but there are others which are quite beyond me.\"  \"Indeed!  Tell me now, auntie, if you had Aladdin's wonderful lamp, what would you ask for?\"  \"I'd ask for--let me see (the old face became quite thoughtful here)-- I'd ask for a library.  You see, Cranby is _very_ badly off for books, and people cannot easily improve without reading, you know.  Then I would ask for a new church, and a school room, and a town-hall where we might have lectures and concerts, and for a whole street of model-houses for the poor, and a gymnasium, and a swimming-bath and--\"  \"A swimming-bath, auntie!\" exclaimed Jeff.  \"Isn't the sea big enough?\"  \"Yes, but children won't learn in the sea.  They're too fond of running about the edge, and of romping in the shallow water.  Besides, the bath could be used in winter, when the sea is too cold.  But I'm praying for all these things.  If God sees fit, He will give them.  If not, I am content with what He has already given.\"  A somewhat sceptical smile rested for a moment on the young man's lips. Happily his heavy moustache concealed it, and saved Miss Millet's feelings.  But she went on to vindicate the ways of God with man, and to impress upon Jeff the fact that in His good wisdom \"ills\" or \"wells,\" and things that seem to us only evil, work out gracious ends.  Jeff listened, but said little, and evidently his difficulties were not all removed.  Presently, observing that three cups were laid on the table, he asked, \"Do you expect company?\"  \"Yes, my brother the captain is coming to tea.  He is about to start for China, and I'm so glad you happen to be here; for I'd like you to know each other, and you're sure to like him.\"  Jeff did not feel quite so sure on that point, for he had counted on a long _tete-a-tete_ with his old friend.  He took care, however, to conceal his disappointment, and before he had time to reply, the door opened with a crash.  \"What cheer, old girl? what cheer?\" resounded in bo'sun's-mate tones through the house, and next moment a rugged sea-captain stood before them.    CHAPTER TWO.  A SEA-CAPTAIN RELATES HIS ADVENTURES, AND REFUSES TO DRAW MORALS.  Captain Richard Millet, like his sister, was rather eccentric.  Unlike her, however, he was large, broad, and powerful.  It would have taken considerably more than \"half a gale\" to blow _him_ away.  Even a gale and a half might have failed to do that.  \"Glad to meet you,\" he said, extending his solid-looking hand with a frank, hearty air, on being introduced to Jeff.  \"My sister Molly has often spoken of you.  Sorry to hear you've left the sea.  Great mistake, young man--great mistake.  There's no school like the sea for teaching a man his dependence on his Maker.\"  \"The school is not very successful, if one may judge from the character of most of its pupils,\" replied the youth.  \"Perhaps you misjudge their character,\" returned the captain, with a look of good-natured severity.  \"I'm _sure_ he does,\" cried Miss Millet, with enthusiasm. \"Noble-hearted, simple men, who would probably never go wrong at all if it were not for their unsuspecting trustfulness and bad companions! Come, sit down, Dick.  Tea is ready.\"  \"Yes, young man,\" continued Captain Millet \"you misjudge 'em.  You should not judge of a school by the shouting and mischief of the worst boys, who always flaunt their colours, while the good ones steer quietly on their course.  You'll understand that better when your beard is grey. Youth is fond o' lookin' at the surface, an' so is apt to misjudge the character of men as well as the ways of Providence.\"  Jeff took the rebuke in good part, readily admitted that youth was prone to err, and slily expressed a hope that in his case coming in contact with age might do him good.  \"If you mean that for a shot at me,\" cried the captain, with a loud guffaw, \"you've missed the mark; for I'm only forty-five, an' that isn't age; is it, Molly?\"  \"Of course not.  Why, you're little more than a baby yet,\" replied Miss Millet who greatly enjoyed even a small joke--indeed, she enjoyed almost everything, more or less, that was not wicked.  \"But now, Dick, I want you to tell Jeff some of your adventures in foreign parts--especially those that have a moral, you know.\"  \"Why, Molly, that's a hard job--you don't want me to _draw_ the moral, do you?  I never was good at that, though I've known fellows with that peculiar cast o' brain as could draw a moral out of a marline-spike if they were hard put to it.  Seems to me that it's best to let morals draw themselves.  For instance, that time when I was wrecked on the South American coast, I came to a shallow river, an' had to wade across, but was too lazy to pull off my boots, 'cause they were long fisherman's boots, right up to the hip an' rather tight; so in I went boots an' all. Just as I was gettin' to the other side, a most awful alligator seized hold o' my right foot.  It's wonderful how easy my boot came off just then!  Although I was used to tug, an' shove, and gasp, and pull, at that boot of a night, no sooner did the alligator lay hold on it than my leg came out like a cork out of a bottle, and I was out o' the water and up the bank like a squirrel.  Now, Molly, what would you say was the moral that should be drawn from that--Never use an alligator as a boot-jack--eh?\"  \"I should say, Never wade across a South American river without your boots on,\" suggested Jeff.  \"Well, now, _I_ should say, Never wade across a South American river at all,\" said Miss Millet; \"but, brother, that's not what I meant.  Before you arrived, Jeff and I had been talking about God's ways with man, and I was trying to show that disasters and what we call misfortunes are not necessarily evil, but are often the means of great blessing.  I don't think Jeff quite sees that.  I can't explain myself clearly, brother; but you know what I mean.\"  While the old lady was speaking, the captain had become thoughtful.  \"Yes, I know what you mean,\" he replied, \"and I agree with you heartily. Is it not written of our Saviour, `He hath done all things well?' and is He not unchangeable?  Of course it is not to be expected that we shall always see through and understand His ways though we can always trust Him; but sometimes He lifts a corner of the veil and lets us see. Very odd, Molly,\" continued the captain, extracting a large black pocket-book with some difficulty from a breast-pocket, \"very odd that you should have touched on this question, for I have somethin' to say to you that bears on it.  Look here.  What's that?\"  He handed an oblong piece of paper to his sister, who examined it slowly.  \"Why, Dick, it's a cheque for 500 pounds.\"  \"Just so, old girl, an' it's yours.\"  \"Mine!\"  \"Ay, I might have given it to you when I first came back, but I took a fancy to keep it as a little surprise for our last evenin' together, so that I might leave you with a good taste in your mouth.  Now, listen, an' I'll spin you an' Jeff a yarn.  But first fill up my cup.  I'm fond o' tea--nat'rally, bein' a teetotaler.  Up to the brim, Molly; I like a good bucketful.  Thankee--now, let me see.\"  The captain put his hand to his rugged brow, became thoughtful for a few moments, and then resumed.  \"Just before startin' on my last voyage to China I ran down to Folkestone to see Rosebud--that's my little daughter, Jeff.  Surely you must have seen her when knocking about here?\"  \"You forget, Captain, I have not been in these parts for six years. Nevertheless, I did see Rosebud some ten or twelve years ago with her nurse in this very room.\"  \"Yes, so you did,\" chimed in Miss Millet.  \"She was six at that time, and the dearest little angel I ever saw.\"  \"She was all that and a great deal more,\" said the enthusiastic father. \"It don't become me to have much of an opinion about the angels, but I wouldn't give my Rosebud for the whole lot o' them, an' all the cherubs throw'd into the bargain.  Well, as I was sayin', I ran down to Folkestone to the school where she is, and as we were partin' she made me promise when I got to Hong-Kong to run up the river to see an old schoolmate o' hers that had gone out there with her father.  I was to give Clara Rosebud's dear love, and her photograph, and get hers in exchange.  I would have done this, of course, for my darlin', anyhow, but I promised all the more readily because I had some business to do with old Nibsworth, the father.  \"Well, after I'd got to Hong-Kong an' seen the ship all snug, I thought of runnin' up the"]]]
