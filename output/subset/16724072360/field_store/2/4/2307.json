The pirates who had boarded us were of all nations, Spaniards, Portuguese, and French, and there were several Englishmen among them.  That their leader was one I could swear, for I heard him speaking English to several of the villains; and what is more, as he gave me a good opportunity of marking his features while I was bound to the mainmast, I should remember him were I ever to meet him again.\"  \"I hope that you may never fall in with him again under similar circumstances,\" remarked Mr Trunnion.  \"Should you do so, he will probably make you walk the plank before he begins discharging your cargo into his own craft.\"  While the mate was narrating his adventures I heard a strange race speaking in an authoritative tone in the outer office.  Suddenly the door was burst open, and a tall powerful man, dressed in riding-boots, his clothes bespattered with mud, yet having in other respects a nautical cut about him, entered the room.  Mr Trunnion gazed on him without speaking.  \"What, Tom! don't you know me?\" exclaimed the new-comer advancing and putting out his hand.  \"My beard has grown, and I have become somewhat sunburnt since we parted.\"  \"Bless my heart! is it you, Roderick?\" exclaimed Mr Trunnion.  \"I own that I did not recognise you, and was surprised at the intrusion of a stranger.\"  Roderick Trunnion, giving a laugh, threw himself into a chair opposite his brother, who reassumed his usual cold and dignified demeanour as he took his seat.  From my desk I could observe what was going forward.  I saw the mate start and narrowly scan the countenance of the new-comer with a look of extreme astonishment, while the latter, who did not appear to remark him, leaned forward and gazed at his brother, whose manner seemed to irritate him.  \"Where in the world have you come from, Roderick?\" asked Mr Trunnion.  \"From Falmouth last, where I left the `Vulture' to refit.  We met with a somewhat heavy gale, in which she was fearfully knocked about, and had we not kept the pumps going she would have foundered to a certainty.  As I wanted to see you and other friends; I took horse and rode night and day to get here.  The business I have got to speak of brooks of no delay, and is such as you and I can talk about best alone.\"  Turning round as he spoke, he cast a glance at Mr Magor.  For a moment, it seemed to me that his eye appeared to quail, but he quickly recovered himself.  \"Have you finished your business here?\" he asked in a bold tone, looking at the mate.  \"If so, you will leave me and your employer alone--for I presume that you are the master of one of his vessels.  And that youngster--you do not wish him to take down our conversation, I suppose,\" he added, first looking at me then round at his brother.  \"Really, Roderick, you have been so accustomed to command, that you forget that you are not on your own quarter-deck,\" observed Mr Trunnion, who was evidently annoyed at the authoritative tone assumed by his brother.  The mate rose and looked first at Mr Trunnion then at Captain Roderick.  \"I have met that man before,\" he said, \"and it is my duty to tell you when and how it was.  It was not long ago, on the high seas, when he boarded the `Arrow' at the head of--\"  Mr Trunnion, as the mate spoke, looked very much agitated, and I naturally fancied that something extraordinary was about to be said. Captain Roderick alone appeared perfectly cool.  Fixing his glance on the mate, he exclaimed in a loud tone, interrupting him--  \"You, my good fellow, may have met me half-a-dozen times for what I know to the contrary, or half-a-dozen men whom you may mistake for me, although I cannot say that I ever set eyes on you before.  However, go on and tell Mr Trunnion what I did when you fancy that you saw me, and I shall then know whether you are mistaken as to my identity.\"  The mate looked greatly confused.  \"I can only hope that I am mistaken, and unless Mr Trunnion desires me, I shall decline at present stating where, as I believe, I last saw you.\"  Mr Trunnion was silent for a minute, and seemed lost in thought. Suddenly looking up he said--  \"You have been suffering from fever, Mr Magor, and your recollection of events, very naturally, is somewhat clouded.  A few weeks' quiet and rest will restore your health.  I would advise you not to repeat what you have just said.  I'll send on board and relieve you of charge of the brig as soon as possible, and you can go to your friends in the country.\"  Mr Magor, making a nautical bow to Mr Trunnion, and giving another glance towards Captain Roderick, left the room.  \"Westerton,\" continued my employer, turning to me, \"you have heard all that has been said, and if it were repeated, although the poor man is under an hallucination, it might be the cause of disagreeable reports. You are discreet, I can trust you.  Let not a word on the subject escape your lips.  You can now go and finish those letters at your own desk.\"  I did as I was ordered, and gathering up the papers, followed the mate out of the room, leaving the two brothers together.  What followed, I of course cannot say.  For an hour or more they were closeted together.  At last Captain Roderick came out, and returned to the inn where he had put up his horse.  All I know is, that Mr Trunnion did not invite him to his house.  It seemed to me suspicious, and I could not help thinking about the matter, and wished that I could have consulted Harry Bracewell.  Two evenings afterwards we went to a party at the house of Mr Crank.  Shortly after we arrived, who should walk in but Captain Roderick.  By the way Mr Crank and Lucy received him, I felt convinced that Mr Trunnion had said nothing to prejudice the senior partner against him.  He made himself at home as usual, treating Miss Lucy with great deference, and it seemed to me that he was gaining ground in her good graces.  His appearance was greatly improved since the day I had seen him in the counting-house.  His face was carefully shaved, and his dress was such as to set off his well-made active figure.  His aim was evidently to play the agreeable, not only to the young lady of the house, but to all the ladies present, and with some--especially with the dowagers--he appeared to be as successful as he could desire.  He cast an indifferent glance now and then at me, as if he had never set eyes on me before, and appeared perfectly unconscious of the accusation--for such I considered it--brought against him by Mr Magor.  When I observed his apparent success with Lucy Crank, I felt a greater desire than ever to tell Harry what I had heard, and to advise him to warn her and her father of what I believed to be the real character of the man.  His brother, I supposed, from fraternal affection of family pride, had said nothing to his senior partner to warn him, and, of course, even to Harry I could not venture to say what I thought about Captain Trunnion.  I could only hope that Lucy would remain as indifferent to him as she had always before appeared to be, and that he would quickly again return to the \"Vulture.\" I was surprised, indeed, that he had ventured to be so long absent from his vessel, as his presence would be necessary while she was refitting. Perhaps, after all, his statements about her might not be true; she might not even be at Falmouth, although his mud-bespattered appearance on his arrival showed that he had ridden a long distance.    CHAPTER TWO.  CAPTAIN TRUNNION APPEARS OPENLY AT LIVERPOOL--HIS ATTENTIONS TO LUCY CRANK--HER AFFECTION FOR HARRY BRACEWELL--CAPTAIN TRUNNION EXHIBITS HIS JEALOUSY OF HARRY--SUSPECTING THE CAPTAIN'S EVIL INTENTIONS, I WATCH OVER HARRY--GODFREY MAGOR PLACED IN COMMAND OF THE \"ARROW\"--HARRY AND I APPOINTED SUPERCARGOES--ATTEND TO THE STOWAGE OF THE VESSEL--PREPARE FOR SAILING--FAREWELL TO LOVED ONES--VOYAGE COMMENCED.  Notwithstanding the very grave suspicion cast on him by the mate of the \"Arrow,\" Captain Roderick Trunnion did not immediately quit Liverpool, as I supposed he would have done.  He was, as far as I could judge, not on friendly terms with his brother, as he lived at an inn, although there was ample room for him at Mr Trunnion's house, where he seldom went, nor did he again appear at the office.  I met him, however, frequently walking about Liverpool, dressed in shoregoing clothes, booted and spurred, and carrying a riding-whip in his hand.  Notwithstanding, I should have known him at a glance to be a seaman.  I found also that he very frequently called at Mr Crank's residence at times when he well knew that the old gentleman would be at his counting-house.  I did not suppose, however, that he received any encouragement from Miss Lucy, but he always had some excuse for paying a visit, either to show some curiosity which he said he had brought from abroad, or to leave a book or other articles which he had obtained for her.  The fact was, that he had got into the good graces of Miss Deborah Crank, Mr Crank's maiden sister, who resided with him to look after Miss Lucy and keep his house in order.  I met the Captain there at two or three evening parties to which the Bracewells and I were invited, and on each occasion he was evidently paying court to the young lady.  When not with her, he was making himself agreeable to Miss Deborah.  Harry appeared to be in no way jealous or unhappy, which he would have been had he thought that Captain Roderick had the slightest chance of success.  \"We understand each other,\" he said, \"and she has assured me that she does not like him, though she cannot be rude to him while her father and aunt invite him to the house.\"  I did not like to make Harry unhappy by saying that I was not quite so certain about the matter as he was; at the same time I longed to be able to warn Miss Lucy of the character of the roan.  What surprised me was that Mr Trunnion should not have spoken to Mr Crank, or that the latter should not have thought it strange that Captain Roderick never came to the counting-house.

Common also are posters of Constantine as St. George, and the Venizelist administration as a three-headed dragon of which Venizelos is the chief and certainly most loathly head.  Venizelos has become violently distasteful to the people--though possibly he may return to power by as violent a reaction.  The chief reason for his fall was that he offended Greek national pride by being the puppet of the Allies. The revolution which he accomplished at the instigation of the French was highly resented.  And all the mortification of the French contempt for Greece was vented upon him.  Although Greece won such a goodly share of the booty of the war, she was treated throughout the war with a brutal nonchalance.  Venizelos had much respect, but Greece had none. A comparison is often made between the machinations of the Allies in Petrograd in 1917 for the deposing of the Tsar, and the intrigues which forced Constantine to flee.  Venizelos nevertheless was one of the cleverest statesmen of Europe--granted one can be clever and not wise at the same time--clever and even stupid, his chief weakness being a crude violence of temperament which breaks out in his speeches:  On vient de vous dire, s'écria-t-il, qu'il n'y avait pas de germanophiles an Grèce.  Cela est vrai pour le peuple, pour les homines politiques de tous les partis en grande majorité.  Moi-même je viens de l'attester à la conference de Londres.  Mais cela n'est vrai du roi, ni de son entourage.  Ceux-la ne sont pas seulement germanophiles.  Ils sont Boches de la tête aux pieds! . . .   The good order, the low cost of living, the high value of the drachma, the excellent condition of the army, the enhanced prestige of the Greek nation after the war, all testify to the ability of Venizelos. Venizelos won for Hellas territory which extends from Salonica all the way to the Black Sea, and brought her almost to the gates of Constantinople.  The role of neutrality which King Constantine affected would have left Greece without the coveted war-glory, and, of course, without the dangerous responsibility she has now.  Thanks to Venizelos, Greece is almost an empire.  And the Greeks are glad to have this extra sway.  No sentiment has stood in the way of Constantine's Government retaining what its arch-enemy had won.  \"We may fall out in politics, but where our material interests are concerned you will find complete solidarity,\" said an Athenian journalist.  And it seems true.  Not many signs of altruism are visible in Greece.  There are few Germanophiles.  \"Do not fear for us,\" said M. Kalogeropoulos, to the French.  \"Greece will not ally herself to a corpse\"--meaning Germany. In fact, there is among the Greeks only Graecophilism.  If superlative and clamorous love of country is a virtue--they have it.  For Greece, when you are down, you are down.  As for fallen Germany, so for Russia in her humiliation Greece has no extra thought or care.  Not a humanitarian and philanthropic nation!  One wonders how a Greek mind would interpret the \"big-brother-love\" of the Americans, which prompts the marvellous rescue-work now being done by the United States in all the stricken countries of Europe.  There, however, the indolence of the Greek mind and the half-closed eye intervene.  There is no curiosity about philanthropy.  But it is a Greek word by origin.  One longs to see some sort of love towards the neighbour.  There is a mortal enmity towards the Bulgar, a cool reciprocity of Italian dislike, a non-comprehension of the Serb, traditional hatred of the Turk--all these are intensified by egoism.  New Greece, with her hazardous northern frontier, needs to cultivate friendship, and will have to employ all her strategy to gain any.  Her mainstay is, of course, England.  For us Greece has the natural respect which a weak country pays to a strong friend, but she has also a curious covert regard for us as one nation of sailors for another, a petty maritime State for a great one.  Her weakness is in asking material favours at the same time as she pays compliments.  Greece is almost our ally in the Near East.  French rivalry has bound British and Greeks together. In our employ are Greeks; in the French employ, Turks.  There is no question but our employees are the cleverer and the more capable, but there is a continual clash on psychological grounds.  The Greeks make mistakes and the British are not ready to make allowances.  The Englishman demands that his friend shall be a \"sportsman\"--the Turk is, the Greek is not.  Therefore we cannot fit Greece into the jig-saw puzzle which we call the comity of nations.  The question is, can Greece cut herself to fit--ought she to?  It is strange to come into the martial display of Athens and find the old war still going on, see the numbers of worn soldiers weighed down with all the impedimenta of \"fighting order\" coming home on leave or returning to the front, to see the Turkish prisoners of war jobbing at the station and on the streets, to see the handsome Evzones, the soldiers of the King's bodyguard, strutting together in fine style along the cobbled roadway.  It is impressive, and shows Greece in a new light.  Then the Constituent Assembly with its new Turkish members in their fezes rather takes the eye as a novel synthesis of political interest in the Near East.  Athens is a great capital where much that is vital in the future of Europe is at stake.  It stands somewhat aside from the general misery of Europe, and for that reason more perhaps can be seen.  Not that Greece has not its poor--its appalling beggars, its miserable war-cripples, its refugees.  An extensive strike was in progress in February; it had to be settled by a threat of mobilization.  \"Any workman not in his place on Monday morning will be called up for the next draft to Asia Minor\" proved an effectual way of meeting demands for higher pay.  Of the refugees, pity is first awakened for the Russians.  Just outside the city of Athens, in old barracks, lie the survivors of the tuberculosis hospitals evacuated from the Crimea--pale and haggard as death--strange wisps of humanity, attended by devoted Russian doctors and nurses; but fed on the scantiest of dry army rations, short of medicine and comfort of all kinds.  One ward of dying women with staring eyes, an unforgettable impression!  Whilst in Greece, every Englishman should visit our cemeteries in Macedonia, and realize that we planted many thousands of our people like seeds of a kind in this Grecian soil--that a flower of freedom might grow.  On a wind-blown moor, in sight of Mt. Olympus and the sea, ranges one regular array of British crosses--now of wood, but presently to be of marble, with a stone of remembrance in their midst.  It will be done well, in the British way.  Even the dead might be pleased by what is being done.  But here is a strange phenomenon which seems to make a mockery of our sacrifice.  Around this wonderful burying ground are growing up a miscellany of alien crosses, of all shapes and sizes, stuck in ugly heaps of upturned earth.  Every day a pit is dug and the dead-cart arrives.  There is no service, no ceremony.  But forty or fifty nearly naked bodies of women and children are shot into the pit and covered over hastily and a cross put over them.  They are Russians, the so-called Russian Greeks evacuated from the Caucasus last year, now stricken with typhus and almost famished to death, some 12,000 of them in old army huts, living promiscuously together and attended by one desperate doctor and a few devoted sisters.  Europe is heaping her dead around us.  This truly is not near Athens, but above the ruined ramshackle port of Salonica, once a fair city, but now facing the sea with almost a mile of fire-devastated streets.  The refugees are confined to their huts, and are under a sort of military control.  All the people are proletariat, and ought never to have been taken on board ships and brought to Greece.  A few would have been killed by Bolsheviks, but not so many as will die here by disease.  They cannot help Russia outside of Russia, and it is beyond belief that little countries can look after them indefinitely.  It is pathetic to look into their huts, strung from wall to wall with crusts of bread, the floors multitudinous with people and especially with children; every serious person engaged in the hopeless task of destroying the lice.  Even if these people were at once put on transports and taken to Russia half of their number would be destined to death.  The Russian scenes and episodes in Greece foreshadow the immense tragedy to be witnessed in Constantinople and on Gallipoli and at Lemnos.  What touches the heart at Athens will ravage the whole being at Constantinople.  But of that anon.  An episode at Athens on the day of arrival had a spice of novelty in it which soon dulled on the palate in a rapidity of repetition:  It is Sunday afternoon, and on the pavement of a quiet street stands a mute and gloomy man with an armful of what appears to be paper-money. He is holding it out in his two hands.  Impossible that it should be money!  But it is.  He is holding about half a million roubles in his hands.  Yes, they are for sale.  This for so much, this other for so much.  \"I am sorry I have no Greek money, but please take five liras Italian and give it to your comrades.  You must be very poor.\"  A smile appeared on the man's face.  \"But you'll take some roubles,\" said he.  \"Well, if you like, just a small note for remembrance.  It doesn't matter what.\"  \"Here's ten thousand roubles!\"  And he handed out a handsome new note for that amount.  It fluttered from his hand to the pavement and was caught on the wind.  \"Pick it up quickly!  It's ten thousand roubles,\" one wished to cry anxiously to the passer-by.  Only ten thousand!  And for something less than sixpence!  \"Europe won't get right before the Russian business"]]]
