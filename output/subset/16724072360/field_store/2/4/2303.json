Burns having fortunately       been rescued by his humble station from the contaminating society       of the “Best models,” wrote well and naturally from the first.       Had he been unfortunate enough to have had an educated taste, we       should have had a series of poems from which, as from his       letters, we could sift here and there a kernel from the mass of       chaff. Coleridge’s youthful efforts give no promise whatever of       that poetical genius which produced at once the wildest,       tenderest, most original and most purely imaginative poems of       modern times. Byron’s “Hours of Idleness” would never find a       reader except from an intrepid and indefatigable curiosity. In       Wordsworth’s first preludings there is but a dim foreboding of       the creator of an era. From Southey’s early poems, a safer augury       might have been drawn. They show the patient investigator, the       close student of history, and the unwearied explorer of the       beauties of predecessors, but they give no assurances of a man       who should add aught to stock of household words, or to the rarer       and more sacred delights of the fireside or the arbor. The       earliest specimens of Shelley’s poetic mind already, also, give       tokens of that ethereal sublimation in which the spirit seems to       soar above the regions of words, but leaves its body, the verse,       to be entombed, without hope of resurrection, in a mass of them.       Cowley is generally instanced as a wonder of precocity. But his       early insipidities show only a capacity for rhyming and for the       metrical arrangement of certain conventional combinations of       words, a capacity wholly dependent on a delicate physical       organization, and an unhappy memory. An early poem is only       remarkable when it displays an effort of _reason,_ and the rudest       verses in which we can trace some conception of the ends of       poetry, are worth all the miracles of smooth juvenile       versification. A school-boy, one would say, might acquire the       regular see-saw of Pope merely by an association with the motion       of the play-ground tilt.        Mr. Poe’s early productions show that he could see through the       verse to the spirit beneath, and that he already had a feeling       that all the life and grace of the one must depend on and be       modulated by the will of the other. We call them the most       remarkable boyish poems that we have ever read. We know of none       that can compare with them for maturity of purpose, and a nice       understanding of the effects of language and metre. Such pieces       are only valuable when they display what we can only express by       the contradictory phrase of _innate experience._ We copy one of       the shorter poems, written when the author was only fourteen.       There is a little dimness in the filling up, but the grace and       symmetry of the outline are such as few poets ever attain. There       is a smack of ambrosia about it.       TO HELEN  Helen, thy beauty is to me     Like those Nicean barks of yore, That gently, o’er a perfumed sea,     The weary, way-worn wanderer bore To his own native shore.  On desperate seas long wont to roam,     Thy hyacinth hair, thy classic face, Thy Naiad airs have brought me home     To the glory that was Greece And the grandeur that was Rome.  Lo! in yon brilliant window-niche     How statue-like I see thee stand! The agate lamp within thy hand,     Ah! Psyche, from the regions which Are Holy Land!        It is the tendency of the young poet that impresses us. Here is       no “withering scorn,” no heart “blighted” ere it has safely got       into its teens, none of the drawing-room sansculottism which       Byron had brought into vogue. All is limpid and serene, with a       pleasant dash of the Greek Helicon in it. The melody of the       whole, too, is remarkable. It is not of that kind which can be       demonstrated arithmetically upon the tips of the fingers. It is       of that finer sort which the inner ear alone _can_ estimate. It       seems simple, like a Greek column, because of its perfection. In       a poem named “Ligeia,” under which title he intended to personify       the music of nature, our boy-poet gives us the following       exquisite picture:      Ligeia! Ligeia! My beautiful one,     Whose harshest idea Will to melody run,     Say, is it thy will, On the breezes to toss,     Or, capriciously still, Like the lone albatross,     Incumbent on night, As she on the air,     To keep watch with delight On the harmony there?        John Neal, himself a man of genius, and whose lyre has been too       long capriciously silent, appreciated the high merit of these and       similar passages, and drew a proud horoscope for their author.        Mr. Poe had that indescribable something which men have agreed to       call _genius_. No man could ever tell us precisely what it is,       and yet there is none who is not inevitably aware of its presence       and its power. Let talent writhe and contort itself as it may, it       has no such magnetism. Larger of bone and sinew it may be, but       the wings are wanting. Talent sticks fast to earth, and its most       perfect works have still one foot of clay. Genius claims kindred       with the very workings of Nature herself, so that a sunset shall       seem like a quotation from Dante, and if Shakespeare be read in       the very presence of the sea itself, his verses shall but seem       nobler for the sublime criticism of ocean. Talent may make       friends for itself, but only genius can give to its creations the       divine power of winning love and veneration. Enthusiasm cannot       cling to what itself is unenthusiastic, nor will he ever have       disciples who has not himself impulsive zeal enough to be a       disciple. Great wits are allied to madness only inasmuch as they       are possessed and carried away by their demon, while talent keeps       him, as Paracelsus did, securely prisoned in the pommel of his       sword. To the eye of genius, the veil of the spiritual world is       ever rent asunder that it may perceive the ministers of good and       evil who throng continually around it. No man of mere talent ever       flung his inkstand at the devil.        When we say that Mr. Poe had genius, we do not mean to say that       he has produced evidence of the highest. But to say that he       possesses it at all is to say that he needs only zeal, industry,       and a reverence for the trust reposed in him, to achieve the       proudest triumphs and the greenest laurels. If we may believe the       Longinuses and Aristotles of our newspapers, we have quite too       many geniuses of the loftiest order to render a place among them       at all desirable, whether for its hardness of attainment or its       seclusion. The highest peak of our Parnassus is, according to       these gentlemen, by far the most thickly settled portion of the       country, a circumstance which must make it an uncomfortable       residence for individuals of a poetical temperament, if love of       solitude be, as immemorial tradition asserts, a necessary part of       their idiosyncrasy.        Mr. Poe has two of the prime qualities of genius, a faculty of       vigorous yet minute analysis, and a wonderful fecundity of       imagination. The first of these faculties is as needful to the       artist in words, as a knowledge of anatomy is to the artist in       colors or in stone. This enables him to conceive truly, to       maintain a proper relation of parts, and to draw a correct       outline, while the second groups, fills up and colors. Both of       these Mr. Poe has displayed with singular distinctness in his       prose works, the last predominating in his earlier tales, and the       first in his later ones. In judging of the merit of an author,       and assigning him his niche among our household gods, we have a       right to regard him from our own point of view, and to measure       him by our own standard. But, in estimating the amount of power       displayed in his works, we must be governed by his own design,       and placing them by the side of his own ideal, find how much is       wanting. We differ from Mr. Poe in his opinions of the objects of       art. He esteems that object to be the creation of Beauty, and       perhaps it is only in the definition of that word that we       disagree with him. But in what we shall say of his writings, we       shall take his own standard as our guide. The temple of the god       of song is equally accessible from every side, and there is room       enough in it for all who bring offerings, or seek in oracle.        In his tales, Mr. Poe has chosen to exhibit his power chiefly in       that dim region which stretches from the very utmost limits of       the probable into the weird confines of superstition and       unreality. He combines in a very remarkable manner two faculties       which are seldom found united; a power of influencing the mind of       the reader by the impalpable shadows of mystery, and a minuteness       of detail which does not leave a pin or a button unnoticed. Both       are, in truth, the natural results of the predominating quality       of his mind, to which we have before alluded, analysis. It is       this which distinguishes the artist. His mind at once reaches       forward to the effect to be produced. Having resolved to bring       about certain emotions in the reader, he makes all subordinate       parts tend strictly to the common centre. Even his mystery is       mathematical to his own mind. To him X is a known quantity all       along. In any picture that he paints he understands the chemical       properties of all his"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21472"],["title","Ned Garth; Or, Made Prisoner in Africa: A Tale of the Slave Trade (#1)"],["body","the lieutenant or Ned had time to speak another word, the black had plunged into the foaming seas, dragging out the rope which the lieutenant quickly uncoiled.  His dark head and back could be distinguished amid the surging foam, as he made his way through the breakers for some distance, when a huge wave rolling in beat him back almost to the beach.  The lieutenant hauled in the rope, fearing that Tom's legs might be entangled, but the brave black again sprang forward. He had, however, another danger besides the sea to encounter.  Already broken spars, planks, and masses of timber, with bales of all sorts, were being hurled on shore, and a blow from some heavy piece of wreck might in an instant disable him.  It seemed useless indeed to proceed further; not a human being was likely to have remained alive on the shattered wreck.  Probably the larger number were drowned when the boat was upset.  Another sea, still fiercer than the former, rushing on with a loud roar, again drove Tom back.  \"We must haul in the rope,\" cried the lieutenant.  \"I cannot let the brave fellow further risk his life.\"  But once more it was found that Tom was dragging out the rope.  \"I heard a cry, and I fancy I see some one not far from.  Tom,\" exclaimed Edward.  \"Yes, yes! he is making towards the man.  Ah, I fear he has missed him; no, he has hold of him.  Haul away, uncle, haul away; let me go and help him, there's rope enough to spare,\" and Ned, securing the slack end of the rope under his arms and seizing the spare oar, dashed forward in time to grasp the man just as the black, exhausted by his exertions, was on the point of letting him go.  Another wave breaking at the moment, and hissing as it rushed back in a sheet of foam over the beach, would have swept away the almost rescued man, but Edward, planting his oar deep in the sand, held on while the lieutenant was engaged in hauling Tom out of danger, hastening, the moment he had done so, to assist his nephew in landing the stranger.  The latter still breathed, and attempted to raise himself from the sand, though unable to speak.  \"You attend to him, Ned, while I look after Tom,\" said the lieutenant.  The black, however, required no assistance.  He proposed, indeed, to again swim off on the chance of finding some other human being struggling for life; but this the lieutenant would not allow.  Already the breakers were covered with masses of wreck, amid which not a single person could be seen, though they looked out eagerly, Tom pressing into the seething foam as far as he dared venture, while the lieutenant held up the lantern as a signal to any strong swimmer who might successfully have buffeted with the waves; but he did so with little hope of success. Every now and then he looked round, uttering an exclamation of regret at the non-appearance of the coast-guard, though, had they arrived, it was evident that they would be too late to be of use.  The sea continued to cast up fragments of wreck and cargo on the beach, but the lieutenant and Tom searched in vain for any of their fellow-creatures to whom they might render assistance.  \"No use waiting longer, I fear,\" shouted the lieutenant.  \"I'll go and look after the man we have saved; the sooner we get him under shelter the better, or he'll be perishing of cold.\"  \"Me stop just a little longer,\" answered the black.  \"Take care though that the sea doesn't carry you off, Tom,\" cried the lieutenant, even now trusting that someone else might be rescued.  On returning to the spot where Edward was tending the stranger, he bent down by the side of the latter and felt his heart.  \"He is still evidently in a very exhausted condition,\" he observed, holding up his lantern so that the light fell on the man's countenance.  \"Poor fellow, he does not look as if he were accustomed to a seaman's life.\"  \"I have been rubbing his hands and chest, uncle, and trying what I could do to revive him,\" said Edward.  \"We should get him home at once, I am sure.\"  \"Just what I was saying; we must not risk his life on the chance of saving that of others,\" replied the lieutenant.  \"Come, Tom,\" he shouted, \"it is of no use, we must carry home this poor fellow; and may be before we get far the coast-guard will be down here and take our places.\"  At that instant a hail was heard.  The lieutenant shouted in return.  In a few minutes a party of coast-guard men appeared, headed by their lieutenant, who had heard the guns, and had been searching for the spot where the vessel had struck.  The man to whom Edward had given the message had, however, not appeared, having, as was afterwards discovered, fallen over the cliff and nearly lost his life.  Lieutenant Hanson said that he would remain on the spot, though his rockets would be useless, as not a man could be clinging to the wreck.  \"Let me have one of your people to assist in carrying this poor fellow to my cottage then,\" said Lieutenant Pack; \"it is more than Tom and I can accomplish, seeing that my timber toe is apt to stick in the soft sand as I trudge along.\"  \"With all my heart,\" was the answer.  \"You shall have two, only send them back without delay.\"  No further time was lost.  The coast-guard men, wrapping the stranger in their dry coats, lifted him on their shoulders, Ned and Tom taking his feet, while the lieutenant led the way, lantern in hand, towards his home.  Although a bright light beaming forth from the sitting-room of the lieutenant's abode could alone be distinguished as the party approached, it may be as well to describe it at once.  Triton Cottage, as he called it, from the name of the ship on board which he first went to sea, stood on the side of a broad gap or opening in the cliff, some little distance up from the beach, the ground around it being sufficiently level to allow of a fair-sized garden and shrubbery.  It was a building of somewhat curious appearance, having no pretentions to what is considered architectural beauty.  The lieutenant, notwithstanding, was proud of it, as the larger portion had been erected by his own hands from time to time as he considered it necessary to increase its size, in order to afford sufficient accommodation to its inmates, and to obtain a spare room in which he could put up an old shipmate, or any other visitor to whom his hospitable feelings might prompt him to give an invitation. The original building had been a fisherman's cottage, to which he had added another story, with a broad verandah in front, while on either side wings had been attached, the upper portions composed of wood obtained from wrecks, the bulkheads serving as wainscoting to the rooms. Both from their size and the fittings they resembled the cabins of a small vessel, being warmed also by ship's stoves, with high flues, curiously topped, rising above the roof, exhibiting a variety of contrivances to prevent the smoke from beating down.  The tar-bucket and paint-pot had been brought largely into requisition, the wood-work of the lower story being covered with a shining coat of black, while various colours adorned the walls both inside and out.  The old lieutenant might frequently have been seen, brush in hand, adorning his mansion, and stopping up every crevice, so as to defy damp, or rain driven against it by the fiercest of south-westerly gales.  It was substantially roofed with thick slabs of slate, obtained from a neighbouring quarry, calculated to withstand the storms of winter or the thickest downfall of snow.  The building had, however, so slight an appearance that it looked as if it might be carried by a strong wind into the sea; but a closer inspection showed that the materials of which it was composed were well seasoned and firmly put together, and though gaily bedecked, fire was the only element it had to fear, and against that the owner had taken all necessary precautions.  \"Sally, sister Sally!\" he shouted, as he neared the door, \"I have brought a guest who requires careful looking after, or he'll slip through our fingers, for he's pretty well gone already.\"  As he spoke, the door opened, and a female appeared holding a shaded lamp in her hand, which the wind threatened every instant to extinguish. Her figure was short and slight, her dress a grey silk gown, a plain lace cap confining her once dark hair, already sprinkled with grey, drawn back from her forehead, on which not a wrinkle could be seen.  A kind expression beamed from her countenance, which, if it had never possessed much beauty, must always have been pleasant to look upon.  \"Thank Heaven you've come back at last, John!  Tom frightened me by the intelligence that a wreck was on shore, and I knew that you would be exposing yourself to danger.  Have many of the poor fellows been saved?\"  \"Only one, I fear,\" answered the lieutenant, pointing to the men who now approached.  \"Take him into my room, Tom; the sooner he is in bed the better, and mine is ready for him.  Get some warm broth or a cup of tea made in the meantime.  He is terribly exhausted, and probably has not tasted food for many hours.\"  The lieutenant made these remarks as Ned and Tom, with the coast-guard men, conveyed the stranger into the room, when, speedily taking off his wet garments, they placed him in bed.  \"By his dress I suspect he is a gentleman,\" observed the lieutenant to his nephew, as Tom gathered up his wet clothes.  \"Hand me his watch and purse--it is a heavy one--and that pocket-book.  Here is a small case too, something of value probably.  He will be glad to know that his property is safe when he comes to.  Run and see if the tea is ready.  I will get him, if I can, to take a little hot liquid.  Tell your aunt and Jane to stir up the fire and get the broth boiling; that will soon set him on his legs I hope.\"  The lieutenant now managed to pour the warm tea down the throat of the stranger, who opened his eyes, and looking about with an astonished gaze murmured, \"Thank you, thank you!  Where am I?\"  \"All right and safe on shore, though you"]]]
