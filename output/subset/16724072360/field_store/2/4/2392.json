It so happened that I got a letter that very day from Nibsworth himself, who had heard of my arrival, askin' me to come without delay, as there was a grand chance of doin' a bit of business that might turn in some thousands of pounds.  But it would have to be settled next day, or the chance would be lost.  You may be sure I didn't waste time after readin' this, but when I got to the river-side, I found that the steamer had started, and there wasn't another till next mornin'.\"  \"_What_ a pity!\" exclaimed the sympathetic sister and Jeff in the same breath.  \"Yes, wasn't it?  Of course it wasn't a personal loss, but it was the loss of a splendid out-o'-the-way chance to do a good turn to the owners.  It was an ill wind--Jeff, almost a disaster.  Hows'ever, I had to grin an' bear it.  But I couldn't rest till next day; so I hired a native boat, determined to do my best in the circumstances, and you may be sure I wasn't in the best of humours, as we went creepin' slowly up that river, when I knew that the hours of opportunity were slippin' away.  \"It was not till the evenin' o' the next day that I reached old Nibsworth's house.  Just before we rounded the bend of the river that brought it into view, I noticed smoke risin' pretty thick above the trees.  Of course I thought nothin' of it till I found that it was the old man's house was a-fire!  Didn't we bend to the oars then with a will!  \"As we drew near, we found that all the servants and work-people about the place were runnin' here and there, shoutin' and yellin' for ropes and ladders.  Most people seem to lose their heads in a fire.  Anyhow those people had; for nobody could find a ladder long enough to reach a top window, where I could see that someone was waving his arms for help. The moment we touched the beach, I jumped out o' the boat and ran up to the house.  It was blazin' fiercely in the lower rooms, and I soon found that old Nibsworth and his daughter were inside--driven to the attics by the fire and smoke.  They soon left the window where I had first seen the arms waving, and threw open another that was further from the fire.  \"I saw that the old man was frail.  The girl, they told me, was delicate.  `Get straw, hay, branches--anything soft,' I shouted, `an' pile 'em under the window.'  \"`Him's too weak for jump,' gasped a native servant.  \"`Do as I bid ye,' said I, with a glare that sent 'em all off double-quick.  Happily I found a rope handy in a storehouse hard by.  I made a coil of it.  You know a seaman can usually heave a coil of rope pretty well.  I made a splendid heave, an' sent it right in at the window.  The old man caught it.  \"`Make fast to a bed-post,' I roared, `or a table, or chest o' drawers-- anything big.'  \"He understood me, I could see, and presently he looked over the window an' shook his head.  Then I could see the face of a dark-haired, beautiful girl.  Even through the increasing smoke I could tell that she was deadly pale, and drew back with a shudder.  By this time a big pile of straw lay under the window.  I saw there was no hope of such an old man lettin' himself or his girl down by a rope, so up I went hand over hand.  Many a time had I done the sort o' thing for a lark when I was a youngster; but bein' out o' practice, and a good deal heavier than in old days, I found it hard work, I can tell you.  Hows'ever, I managed it and got in at the window, an' didn't my heart give a jump when I saw that the old chap had only made the rope fast to a light bedroom chair. If I'd bin a stone heavier, I'd have pulled that chair right over the window!  \"`God bless you!' cried the tremblin' old man; `save my Clara!'  \"There was no time for pretty speeches.  I made fast the end of the rope to the leg of a table, made a loop on the other end, threw it over the girl, caught her round the waist an' swung her over the window.  I was in such a hurry that the rope nearly took the skin off my hands; but I landed her safe on the straw below.  The old man was heavier, and not so easy to manage; but I got him lowered safe, and then, slipping over myself, began to descend.  The flames had by that time got headway, and were dartin' like fiery serpents' tongues out o' the windows below.  One o' them gave me a wipe in passin', an' cleared eyelashes, eyebrows, and half the hair o' my head away.  Another twined round the rope and singed it; so that when I was half-way down, it snapped, and I came to the ground with a thud that damaged my canvas ducks, though they were by no means delicate.  Hows'ever, the pile of straw broke the fall, and I was none the worse.  \"The gratitude o' that poor old man and his daughter knew no bounds, specially when he found I was the father of his Clara's favourite schoolmate.  \"`Now, Captain Millet,' says he at partin', `nothin' in this world can repay what we owe you.  I know it would be insultin' to offer you money for such service, but sometimes men like you like to help a good cause. Will you accept of five hundred pounds for such a purpose?'  \"`No sir,' says I, `I won't!  But I've a sister at home who spends all her time in tryin' to do good.  If you'll be kind enough to send it to her, she'll consider it a blessed windfall, and will lay it out to the best possible advantage.'  \"`Good,' said he, seizin' his pen an' writin' out the cheque.  `Is your sister well off?'  \"`She might be better off,' said I.  \"`Then pray beg her in my name to accept of a few shares in an Australian tin-mine which came to me a few days ago.  They are not worth much, but I don't want to be troubled with them; indeed, will consider it a favour if she will take them off my hands.'  \"The old fellow said this with a laugh--so there you are, Molly, 500 pounds to the credit of your charity account an' I don't know how much tin transferred to your own.\"  \"O brother, how good--how kind!\"  Miss Millet paused here, and gazed in silence at the cheque, for she had already begun to calculate how far that sum would go towards the library, and the church, and the town-hall, and the model-houses, and the gymnasium, and the swimming-bath.  \"And now, young man,\" said the captain, turning to our coastguardsman, \"the missin' of that steamer, at which I growled so much that day, turned out to be a great blessin' after all, although it seemed such a misfortune.  For it caused me to arrive just in the nick of time to save two human lives--besides givin' the old girl here somethin' to think about and work upon for the next twelvemonth to come--whereas, if I had arrived the day before, I would have bin sleepin' in the house, and mayhap have bin burnt alive wi' old Nibsworth and his daughter.  Seems to me as if that little story had some sort o' bearin' on the subject you was discussin' wi' Molly.  But I'm not good at drawin' morals, so I'll leave you to draw it for yourself.\"    CHAPTER THREE.  OUR COASTGUARDSMAN MEETS WITH A SERIOUS BUT VERY COMMON FALL.  Whether Jeff Benson drew the moral of Captain Millet's story for himself or not, we cannot tell; but it is certain that his mates found him after that date a man who was prone to solitary meditations, with occasional fits of absence of mind.  They also found him a pleasant companion and a most active comrade in all the duties of his station.  Sometimes these duties involved great hardship, and frequent risk to life and limb; for, as is well known, our coastguardsmen not only perambulate our shores in all weathers, but often work the rocket apparatus for saving life from shipwreck, and are frequently called upon to assist the lifeboat-men by putting off to the rescue in their own boats when others are not available.  In all these duties Jeffrey Benson did his work with tremendous energy, as might have been expected of one so strong, and with reckless disregard to personal safety, which was appropriate in a hero.  One evening, about a year after the period of which we have been writing, Jeff was returning along shore with a party in charge of the rocket-cart, after having rescued the crew of a small coasting vessel-- four men and a boy, with the skipper's wife.  The service had been prolonged and pretty severe, but feelings of exhaustion were, for the time at least, banished from the coastguardsmen's breasts by the joy resulting from success in their heroic work.  On the way, the party had to pass close to Miss Millet's cottage--her \"cottage by the sea,\" as the romantic old lady was fond of calling it.  Jeff--although fatigued and hungry, besides being drenched, dishevelled about the hair, bespattered with mud, and bruised, as well as lacerated somewhat about the hands--determined to pay a short visit to the cottage, being anxious to \"have it out\" with his confidante about that matter of good being made to come out of evil.  \"O Jeff!\" exclaimed the horrified old lady when he entered, \"wounded? perhaps fatally!\"  \"Not quite so bad as that, auntie,\" replied Jeff, with a hearty laugh, for Miss Millet's power to express alarm was wonderful.  \"I'll soon put myself to rights when I get back to the station.  I ought to apologise for calling in such a plight, but I've been thinking much since I last saw you, and I want to have a talk.\"  \"Not till I have bound up all your wounds,\" said Miss Millet firmly.  Knowing that he would gain his end more quickly by giving in, Jeff submitted to have several fingers of both hands done up with pieces of white rag, and a slight cut across the bridge of his handsome nose ornamented with black sticking-plaster.  He not only enjoyed the operation with a sort of reckless joviality, but sought to gratify his friend by encouraging her to use her appliances to the utmost, intending to remove them all when he quitted the cottage.  The earnest little woman availed herself fully of the encouragement, but could scarcely refrain from laughing when she surveyed him after the operation was completed.  \"Now, auntie, have you finished?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Well then,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21744"],["title","The Lifeboat (#1)"],["body"," the men aboard of her our lives.  I strongly advise you to strike her off the books, and get a new one.\"  \"Mr Bax,\" said Denham, pompously, \"you are too young a man to offer your advice unless it is asked.  I believe the engineer employed by me to examine into the condition of my vessels is quite competent to judge in these matters, and I have unbounded confidence in him.  When I placed you in command of the `Nancy,' I meant you to navigate, not to criticise her; but if you are afraid to venture--\"  \"Afraid!\" cried the young sailor, reddening.  \"Is anxiety about the lives of your men and the safety of your property to be called fear? _I_ am willing to sail in the `Nancy' as long as a plank of her will hold to her ribs, but--\"  Bax paused and bit his lip, as if to keep back words which had better not be spoken.  \"Well, then,\" rejoined Mr Denham, affecting to disregard the pause, \"let me hear no more about repairs.  When these require to be done, they _shall_ be done.  Meanwhile, go and make preparation to sail by the morning tides which serves about--what hour, think you?\"  \"Flood at half after six,\" said Bax, curtly.  \"Very well, come up here at half-past five, one of the clerks will see you.  You will have to run down to Dover in the first place, and when there my agent will give you further instructions.  Good afternoon!\"  Bax rose and quitted the room with a stern \"Good day, sir.\"  As he passed through the outer office he was arrested by one of the clerks laying a hand on his shoulder.  \"Well, Mr Foster,\" said Bax, a bright smile chasing the frown from his face, \"it seems we're to swim if we can, or sink if we can't this winter;--but what want ye with me?\"  \"You are to call me Guy, not _Mister_ Foster,\" said the lad, gaily.  \"I want to know where you are to be found after six this evening.\"  \"At the `Three Jolly Tars,'\" answered Bax, clapping on his glazed hat.  \"All right, I'll look you up.  Good-day.\"  \"Guy Foster,\" shouted Mr Denham from the inner room.  \"Yes, uncle,\" and in another moment the youth was standing, pen in hand, in the august presence of his relative, who regarded him with a cold stare of displeasure.  There could scarcely have been conceived a stronger contrast in nature than that which existed between the starched, proud, and portly uncle, and the tall, handsome, and hearty young nephew, whose age was scarcely twenty years.  \"How often am I to tell you, sir,\" said Mr Denham, \"that `yes, uncle,' is much too familiar and unbusinesslike a phrase to be used in this office in the hearing of your fellow-clerks?\"  \"I beg pardon, uncle, I'm sure I had no intention of--\"  \"There, that will do, I want no apology, I want obedience and attention to my expressed wishes.  I suppose that you expect to get away for a few days' holiday?\"  \"Well, unc--, sir, I mean, if it is quite convenient I should--\"  \"It is _not_ quite convenient,\" interrupted the uncle.  \"It cannot possibly, at any time, be convenient to dispense with the services of a clerk in a house where no supernumeraries are kept to talk slang and read the newspapers.  I see no reason whatever in young men in ordinary health expecting as a right, two or three weeks' leave each year without deduction of salary.  _I_ never go to the country or to the sea-side from one year's end to the other.\"  \"You'd be much the better for it if you did, uncle,\" interposed Guy.  \"That, _sir_,\" retorted Denham with emphasis, \"is _your_ opinion, and you will allow me to say that it is erroneous, as most of your opinions, I am sorry to find, are.  _I_ find that no change is necessary for my health.  I am in better condition than many who go to Margate every summer.  I thrive on town air, sir, and on city life.\"  There was much truth in these observations.  The worthy merchant did indeed seem to enjoy robust health, and there could be no question that, as far as physical appearances went, he did thrive on high living, foul air, and coining money.  Tallow and tar sent forth delicious odours to him, and thick smoke was pleasant to his nostrils, for he dealt largely in coal, and all of these, with many kindred substances, were productive of the one great end and object of his life--gold.  \"However,\" pursued Mr Denham, leaning back on the mantle-piece, \"as the tyrannical customs of society cannot be altogether set at nought, I suppose I must let you go.\"  \"Thank you, unc--sir,\" said Guy, who, having been chained to the desk in the office of Redwharf Lane for the last eleven months, felt his young heart bounding wildly within him at the prospect of visiting, even for a brief period, his mother's cottage on the coast of Kent.  \"You have no occasion to thank _me_,\" retorted Mr Denham; \"you are indebted entirely to the tyrannical customs and expectations of society for the permission.  Good-bye, you may convey my respects to your mother.\"  \"I will, sir.\"  \"Have you anything further to say?\" asked Mr Denham, observing that the youth stood looking perplexedly at the ground, and twirling his watch-key.  \"Yes, uncle, I have,\" answered Guy, plucking up courage.  \"The fact is-- that, is to say--you know that wrecks are very common off the coast of Kent.\"  \"Certainly, I do,\" said Denham with a frown.  \"I have bitter cause to know that.  The loss occasioned by the wreck of the `Sea-gull' last winter was very severe indeed.  The subject is not a pleasant one; have you any good reason for alluding to it?\"  \"I have, uncle; as you say, the loss of the `Sea-gull' was severe, for, besides the loss of a fine vessel and a rich cargo, there was the infinitely more terrible loss of the lives of twenty-two human beings.\"  As Mr Denham had not happened to think of the loss of life that occurred on the occasion, and had referred solely to the loss of ship and cargo, which, by a flagrant oversight on the part of one of his clerks, had not been insured; he made no rejoinder, and Guy, after a moment's pause, went on--  \"The effect of this calamity was so powerful on the minds of the people of Deal and Walmer, near which the wreck took place, that a public meeting was called, and a proposal made that a lifeboat should be established there.\"  \"Well?\" said Mr Denham.  \"Well,\" continued the youth, \"my mother gave a subscription; but being poor she could not give much.\"  \"Well, well,\" said Mr Denham impatiently.  \"And--and _I_ gave a little, a very little, towards it too,\" said Guy.  \"Your salary is not large; it was very foolish of you to waste your money in this way.\"  \"Waste it, uncle!\"  \"Come, sir, what does all this tend to?\" said Denham, sternly.  \"I thought--I hoped--indeed I felt assured,\" said Guy earnestly, \"that _you_ would give something towards this good object--\"  \"Oh, did you?\" said the merchant, cutting him short; \"then, sir, allow me to say that you were never more mistaken in your life.  I never give money in charity.  I believe it to be a false principle, which tends to the increase of beggars and criminals.  You can go now.\"  \"But consider, uncle,\" entreated Guy, \"this is no ordinary charity.  A lifeboat there might be the means of saving hundreds of lives; and oh! if you could have seen, as I did, the despairing faces of these poor people as they clung to the rigging scarcely a stone's-cast from the shore, on which the waves beat so furiously that no boat except a lifeboat could have lived for a moment; if you could have heard, as I did, the wild shriek of despair as the masts went by the board, and plunged every living soul into the raging sea, I am certain that you would gladly give a hundred pounds or more towards this philanthropic object.\"  \"Nephew,\" said Denham, \"I will not give a sixpence.  Your inexperience and enthusiasm lead you astray, sir, in this matter.  Lifeboats are capable of being upset as well as ordinary boats, and there are cases on record in which the crews of them have been drowned as well as the people whom they recklessly went out to save.  My opinion is, that persons who devote themselves to a sea-faring life must make up their minds to the chances and risks attending such a life.  Now you have my answer--good-bye, and give my best regards to your sister.  I will expect you back next Saturday week.\"  \"I have still another favour to ask, sir,\" said Guy, after some hesitation.  \"Has it anything to do with what you are pleased to term a philanthropic object?\"  \"It has.\"  \"Then,\" said Mr Denham, \"save me the trouble of refusing, and yourself the pain of a refusal, by holding your tongue,--and retiring.\"  Guy coloured, and was about to turn away in disgust, but, repressing his indignation by a powerful effort, he advanced with a cheerful countenance, and held out his hand.  \"Well, good-bye, uncle.  If ever you go to the coast, and happen to see a storm and a shipwreck, you'll change your mind, I think, in regard to this matter.\"  Mr Denham did go to the coast, and, did see a storm and a shipwreck, but whether this prediction ever came true is a point that shall not be revealed at this part of our narrative.    CHAPTER TWO.  IN WHICH MORE IMPORTANT PERSONAGES ARE INTRODUCED, AND DISPLAY THEIR CHARACTERS BY THEIR ACTIONS MORE OR LESS.  The \"Three Jolly Tars\" was one of those low taverns where seamen were wont to congregate--not _because_ it was a low tavern, but because there was no other sort of tavern--high or low--in that neighbourhood.  The world (that is to say, the delicately-nurtured and carefully-tended world) is apt to form erroneous opinions in regard to low taverns, and degradation, and sin in general,--arising from partial ignorance and absolute inexperience, which it is important that we should correct in order that the characters of our story may not be falsely judged.  God forbid that it should be for a moment supposed that we have a word to say in favour of low taverns.  Our aim just now is, not to consider these, but, to convince the reader, if possible, that every man who enters one of them is not necessarily a lost or utterly depraved"]]]
