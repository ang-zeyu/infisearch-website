Ha! just so--there he goes!\"  And truly the reckless driver did \"go\" just at that moment.  He came up to the corner of the new fence, where the road took a rather abrupt turn, in a style that ensured a capsize.  In another second the spirited horse turned sharp round, the sleigh turned sharp over, and the occupant was pitched out at full length, while a black object, that might have been mistaken for his hat, rose from his side like a rocket, and, flying over him, landed on the snow several yards beyond.  A faint shout was heard to float on the breeze as this catastrophe occurred, and the driver was seen to jump up and readjust himself in the cariole; while the other black object proved itself not to be a hat by getting hastily up on a pair of legs, and scrambling back to the seat from which it had been so unceremoniously ejected.  In a few minutes more the cheerful tinkling of the merry sleigh-bells was heard, and Frank Kennedy, accompanied by his hopeful son Charles, dashed up to the gate, and pulled up with a jerk.  \"Ha!  Grant, my fine fellow, how are you?\" exclaimed Mr Kennedy, senior, as he disengaged himself from the heavy folds of the buffalo robe and shook the snow from his greatcoat.  \"Why on earth, man, don't you put up a sign-post and a board to warn travellers that you've been running out new fences and changing the road, eh?\"  \"Why, my good friend,\" said Mr Grant, smiling, \"the fence and the road are of themselves pretty conclusive proof to most men that the road is changed; and, besides, we don't often have people driving round corners at full gallop; but--\"  \"Hollo!  Charley, you rascal,\" interrupted Mr Kennedy--\"here, take the mare to the stable, and don't drive her too fast.  Mind, now, no going off upon the wrong road for the sake of a drive, you understand.\"  \"All right, father,\" exclaimed the boy, while a bright smile lit up his features and displayed two rows of white teeth: \"I'll be particularly careful,\" and he sprang into the light vehicle, seized the reins, and with a sharp crack of the whip dashed down the road at a hard gallop.  \"He's a fine fellow that son of yours,\" said Mr Grant, \"and will make a first-rate fur-trader.\"  \"Fur-trader!\" exclaimed Mr Kennedy.  \"Just look at him!  I'll be shot if he isn't thrashing the mare as if she were made of leather.\"  The old man's ire was rising rapidly as he heard the whip crack every now and then, and saw the mare bound madly over the snow.  \"And see!\" he continued, \"I declare he _has_ taken the wrong turn after all.\"  \"True,\" said Mr Grant: \"he'll never reach the stable by that road; he's much more likely to visit the White-horse Plains.  But come, friend, it's of no use fretting.  Charley will soon tire of his ride; so come with me to my room and have a pipe before dinner.\"  Old Mr Kennedy gave a short groan of despair, shook his fist at the form of his retreating son, and accompanied his friend to the house.  It must not be supposed that Frank Kennedy was very deeply offended with his son, although he did shower on him a considerable amount of abuse. On the contrary, he loved him very much.  But it was the old man's nature to give way to little bursts of passion on almost every occasion in which his feelings were at all excited.  These bursts, however, were like the little puffs that ripple the surface of the sea on a calm summer's day.  They were over in a second, and left his good-humoured, rough, candid countenance in unruffled serenity.  Charley knew this well, and loved his father tenderly, so that his conscience frequently smote him for raising his anger so often; and he over and over again promised his sister Kate to do his best to refrain from doing anything that was likely to annoy the old man in future.  But, alas!  Charley's resolves, like those of many other boys, were soon forgotten, and his father's equanimity was upset generally two or three times a day; but after the gust was over, the fur-trader would kiss his son, call him a \"rascal,\" and send him off to fill and fetch his pipe.  Mr Grant, who was in charge of Fort Garry, led the way to his smoking apartment, where the two were soon seated in front of a roaring log-fire, emulating each other in the manufacture of smoke.  \"Well, Kennedy,\" said Mr Grant, throwing himself back in his chair, elevating his chin, and emitting a long thin stream of white vapour from his lips, through which he gazed at his friend complacently--\"well, Kennedy, to what fortunate chance am I indebted for this visit?  It is not often that we have the pleasure of seeing you here.\"  Mr Kennedy created two large volumes of smoke, which, by means of a vigorous puff, he sent rolling over towards his friend, and said, \"Charley.\"  \"And what of Charley?\" said Mr Grant, with a smile, for he was well aware of the boy's propensity to fun, and of the father's desire to curb it.  \"The fact is,\" replied Kennedy, \"that Charley must be broke.  He's the wildest colt I ever had to tame, but I'll do it--I will--that's a fact.\"  If Charley's subjugation had depended on the rapidity with which the little white clouds proceeded from his sire's mouth, there is no doubt that it would have been a \"fact\" in a very short time, for they rushed from him with the violence of a high wind.  Long habit had made the old trader and his pipe not only inseparable companions, but part and parcel of each other--so intimately connected that a change in the one was sure to produce a sympathetic change in the other.  In the present instance, the little clouds rapidly increased in size and number as the old gentleman thought on the obstinacy of his \"colt.\"  \"Yes,\" he continued, after a moment's silence, \"I've made up my mind to tame him, and I want _you_, Mr Grant, to help me.\"  Mr Grant looked as if he would rather not undertake to lend his aid in a work that was evidently difficult; but being a good-natured man, he said, \"And how, friend, can I assist in the operation?\"  \"Well, you see, Charley's a good fellow at bottom, and a clever fellow too--at least so says the schoolmaster; though I must confess that, so far as my experience goes, he's only clever at finding out excuses for not doing what I want him to.  But still I'm told he's clever, and can use his pen well; and I know for certain that he can use his tongue well.  So I want to get him into the service, and have him placed in a situation where he shall have to stick to his desk all day.  In fact, I want to have him broken in to work; for you've no notion, sir, how that boy talks about bears and buffaloes and badgers, and life in the woods among the Indians.  I do believe,\" continued the old gentleman, waxing warm, \"that he would willingly go into the woods to-morrow, if I would let him, and never show his nose in the settlement again.  He's quite incorrigible.  But I'll tame him yet--I will!\"  Mr Kennedy followed this up with an indignant grunt, and a puff of smoke, so thick, and propelled with such vigour, that it rolled and curled in fantastic evolutions towards the ceiling, as if it were unable to control itself with delight at the absolute certainty of Charley being tamed at last.  Mr Grant, however, shook his head, and remained for five minutes in profound silence, during which time the two friends puffed in concert, until they began to grow quite indistinct and ghostlike in the thick atmosphere.  At last he broke silence.  \"My opinion is that you're wrong, Mr Kennedy.  No doubt you know the disposition of your son better than I do; but even judging of it from what you have said, I'm quite sure that a sedentary life will ruin him.\"  \"Ruin him!  Humbug!\" said Kennedy, who never failed to express his opinion at the shortest notice and in the plainest language--a fact so well known by his friends that they had got into the habit of taking no notice of it.  \"Humbug!\" he repeated, \"perfect humbug!  You don't mean to tell me that the way to break him in is to let him run loose and wild whenever and wherever he pleases?\"  \"By no means.  But you may rest assured that tying him down won't do it.\"  \"Nonsense!\" said Mr Kennedy testily; \"don't tell me.  Have I not broken in young colts by the score? and don't I know that the way to fix their flints is to clap on a good strong curb?\"  \"If you had travelled farther south, friend,\" replied Mr Grant, \"you would have seen the Spaniards of Mexico break in their wild horses in a very different way; for after catching one with a lasso, a fellow gets on his back, and gives it the rein and the whip--ay, and the spur too; and before that race is over, there is no need for a curb.\"  \"What!\" exclaimed Kennedy, \"and do you mean to argue from that, that I should let Charley run--and _help_ him too?  Send him off to the woods with gun and blanket, canoe and tent, all complete?\"  The old gentleman puffed a furious puff, and broke into a loud, sarcastic laugh.  \"No, no,\" interrupted Mr Grant; \"I don't exactly mean that, but I think that you might give him his way for a year or so.  He's a fine, active, generous fellow; and after the novelty wore off, he would be in a much better frame of mind to listen to your proposals.  Besides\" (and Mr Grant smiled expressively), \"Charley is somewhat like his father.  He has got a will of his own; and if you do not give him his way, I very much fear that he'll--\"  \"What?\" inquired Mr Kennedy abruptly.  \"Take it,\" said Mr Grant.  The puff that burst from Mr Kennedy's lips on hearing this would have done credit to a thirty-six pounder.  \"Take it!\" said he; \"he'd _better_ not.\"  The latter part of this speech was not in itself of a nature calculated to convey much; but the tone of the old trader's voice, the contraction of his eyebrows, and above all the overwhelming flow of cloudlets that followed, imparted to it a significance that induced the belief that Charley's taking his own way would be productive of more terrific consequences than it was in the power "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21713"],["title","The Young Trawler (#1)"],["body","been for some time in his father's service.  \"Kin you do cookin'?\" asked Zulu with a grin that revealed an unusually large cavern full of glistening teeth, mingled with more than an average allowance of tongue and gums.  \"Oh!  I say,\" remonstrated Billy, \"it's growed bigger than ever!\"  Zulu expanded his mouth to its utmost, and shut his eyes in enjoyment of the complimentary joke.  \"Oh course it hab,\" he said on recovering; \"I's 'bliged to eat so much at sea dat de mout gits wider ebery trip.  Dat leetle hole what you've got in your face 'll git so big as mine fore long, Billy.  Den you be like some ob de leetle fishes we catch--all mout and no body worth mentioning.  But you no tell me yit: Kin you do cookin'?\"  \"Oh yes, I can manage a Yarmouth bloater,\" replied Billy.  \"But,\" said Zulu, \"kin you cook a 'tater widout makin' him's outside all of a mush, an' him's inside same so as a stone?\"  Instead of answering, Billy sat down on the settle which ran round the cabin and looked up at his dark friend very solemnly.  \"Hallo!\" exclaimed Zulu.  \"There--there's something wrong wi' me,\" said Billy, with a faint attempt to smile as he became rather pale.  Seeing this, his friend quietly put a bucket beside him.  \"I say, Zulu,\" observed the poor boy with a desperate attempt at pleasantry, \"I wonder what's up.\"  \"Des nuffin' up yit but he won't be long,\" replied the young cook with a look full of sympathy.  It would be unjust to our little hero to proceed further.  This being, as we have said, his first trip to sea, he naturally found himself, after an hour or two, stretched out in one of the bunks which surrounded the little cabin.  There he was permitted to lie and think longingly of his mother, surrounded by dense tobacco smoke, hot vapours, and greasy fumes, until he blushed to find himself wishing, with all his heart, that he had never left home!  There we will leave him to meditate and form useless resolves, which he never carried out, while we introduce to the reader some of the other actors in our tale.    CHAPTER TWO.  A CONTRAST TO CHAPTER I.  From that heaving grey wilderness of water called the North Sea we pass now to that lively wilderness of bricks and mortar called London.  West-end mansions are not naturally picturesque or interesting subjects either for the brush or the pen, and we would not willingly drag our readers into one of them, did not circumstances--over which we have not a shadow of control--compel us to do so.  The particular mansion to which we now direct attention belonged to a certain Mrs Dotropy, whose husband's ancestors, by the way, were said to have come over with the Conqueror--whether in his own ship or in one of the bumboats that followed is not certain.  They were De Tropys at that time, but, having sunk in the social scale in the course of centuries, and then risen again in succeeding centuries through the medium of trade, they reappeared on the surface with their patronymic transformed as now presented.  \"Mother,\" said Ruth Dotropy to a magnificent duchess-like woman, \"I've come to ask you about the poor--\"  \"Ruth, dear,\" interrupted the mother, \"I wish you would not worry me about the poor!  They're a troublesome, ill-doing set; always grumbling, dirty, ill-natured, suspicious, and envious of the rich--as if it was our fault that we are rich!  I don't want to hear anything more about the poor.\"  Ruth, who was a soft-cheeked, soft-handed, and soft-hearted girl of eighteen, stood, hat in hand, before her mother with a slight smile on her rosy lips.  \"You are not quite just to the poor, mother,\" returned Ruth, scarce able to restrain a laugh at her parent's vehemence.  \"Some of them are all that you say, no doubt, but there are many, even among the poorest of the poor, who are good-natured, well-doing, unsuspicious, and respectful, not only to the rich but also to each other and to everybody.  There is Mrs Wolsey, for instance, she--\"  \"Oh! but she's an exception, you know,\" said Mrs Dotropy, \"there are not many like Mrs Wolsey.\"  \"And there is Mrs Gladman,\" continued Ruth.  \"Yes, but she's another exception.\"  \"And Mrs Robbie.\"  \"Why, Ruth, what's the use of picking out all the exceptions to prove your point?  Of course the exception proves the rule--at least so the proverb says--but a great many exceptions prove nothing that I know of, except--that is--but what's the use of arguing, child, you'll never be convinced.  Come, how much do you want me to give?\"  Easy-going Mrs Dotropy's mind, we need scarcely point out, was of a confused type, and she \"hated argument.\"  Perhaps, on the whole, it was to the advantage of her friends and kindred that she did so.  \"I only want you to give a little time, mother,\" replied Ruth, swinging her hat to and fro, while she looked archly into Mrs Dotropy's large, dignified, and sternly-kind countenance, if we may venture on such an expression,--\"I want you to go with me and see--\"  \"Yes, yes, I know what you're going to say, child, you want me to go and `see for myself,' which means that I'm to soil my boots in filthy places, subject my ears to profanity, my eyes to horrible sights, and my nose to intolerable smells.  No, Ruth, I cannot oblige you.  Of what use would it be?  If my doing this would relieve the miseries of the poor, you might reasonably ask me to go among them, but it would not.  I give them as much money as I can afford to give, and, as far as I can see, it does them no good.  They never seem better off, and they always want more.  They are not even grateful for it.  Just look at Lady Openhand. What good does she accomplish by her liberality, and her tearful eyes, and sympathetic heart, even though her feelings are undoubtedly genuine? Only the other day I chanced to walk behind her along several streets and saw her stop and give money to seven or eight beggars who accosted her.  She never _can_ refuse any one who asks with a pitiful look and a pathetic cock-and-bull story.  Several of them were young and strong, and quite undeserving of charity.  Three, I observed, went straight to a public-house with what she had given them, and the last, a small street boy, went into fits of suppressed laughter after she had passed, and made faces at her--finishing off by putting the thumb of his left hand to his nose, and spreading out his fingers as wide as possible.  I do not understand the exact significance of that action, but there is something in it so intensely insolent that it is quite incompatible with the idea of gratitude.\"  \"Yes, mother, I saw him too,\" said Ruth, with a demure look; \"it curiously enough happened that I was following you at the time.  You afterwards passed the same boy with a refusal, I suppose?\"  \"Yes, child, of course--and a reproof.\"  \"I thought so.  Well, after you had passed, he not only applied his left thumb to his nose and spread his fingers, but also put the thumb of his right hand against the little finger of his left, and spread out the other five fingers at _you_.  So, whatever he meant Lady Openhand to receive, he meant you to have twice as much.  But Lady Openhand makes a mistake, I think, she does not _consider_ the poor; she only feels deeply for them and gives to them.\"  \"_Only_ feels and gives!\" repeated Mrs Dotropy, with a look of solemn amazement.  Being quite incapable of disentangling or expressing the flood of ideas that overwhelmed her, the good lady relieved herself after a few broken sentences, with the assertion that it was of no use arguing with Ruth, for Ruth would never be convinced.  She was so far right, in that her daughter could not change her mind on the strength of mere dogmatic assertion, even although she was a pliant and teachable little creature.  So, at least, Mr Lewis, her pastor, had found her when he tried to impress on her a few important lessons--such as, that it is better to give than to receive; that man _is_ his brother's keeper; that we are commanded to walk in the footsteps of Jesus, who came to save the lost, to rescue the perishing, and who fed the hungry.  \"But, mother,\" resumed Ruth, \"I want you to go with me to-day to visit some poor people who are _not_ troublesome, who are perfectly clean, are never ill-natured, suspect nothing, and envy nobody.\"  \"They must indeed be wonderful people,\" said Mrs Dotropy, with a laugh at Ruth's enthusiasm, \"quite angelic.\"  \"They are as nearly so as mortals ever become, I think,\" returned Ruth, putting on her hat; \"won't you come, mother?\"  Now, Mrs Dotropy had the faculty of giving in gracefully, although she could not argue.  Rising with an amused smile, she kissed Ruth's forehead and went to prepare for a visit to the poor.  Let us now turn to a small street scarcely ten minutes' walk from the mansion where the above conversation took place.  It was what may be styled a Lilliputian street.  Almost everything in it was small.  The houses were small; the shops were small; the rents-- well, they were certainly not so small as they should have been, the doors and windows were small; and the very children that played in the gutter, with an exceedingly small amount of clothing on them, were rather diminutive.  Some of the doors stood open, revealing the fact that it had been thought wise by the builders of the houses to waste no space in lobbies or entrance halls.  One or two, however, displayed entries, or passages--dark and narrow--the doors to which were blistered and severely battered, because, being the public property of several families, they had no particular owner to protect them.  There was a small flat over a green-grocer's shop to which one of the cleanest of those entries led.  It consisted of two rooms, a light-closet and a kitchen, and was low-ceilinged and poorly furnished, but there was a distinct air of cleanliness about it, with a consequent tendency to comfort.  The carpet of the chief room was very old, but it had been miraculously darned and patched.  The table was little larger than that of a gigantic "]]]
