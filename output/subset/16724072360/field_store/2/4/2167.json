As for him, an admiral of the fleet after a victory could not have been prouder and happier.  As any other man would have done, he embraced or improved the opportunity afforded him by their journey up the hill, to urge the old commonplace that he would so assist her up the hill of life!  And so on.  The iterations of love never grow stale to a lover, and the saying was not so trite to her that it failed to give her the little thrill of loving joy which seemed, for the moment at least, to tame her restless spirit, that spirit of subtle yet merry mockery which charmed yet drove him mad.  She was so unwontedly quiet and subdued that he stopped at the brow of the hill, and said, half in alarm, \"Katharine, why so silent?\"  She looked at him gravely; a new light, not of laughter, in her brown eyes, saying in answer to his unspoken thought: \"I was thinking of what you said about your orders.  Oh, if they should come to-day, and you should go away on your ship and be shot at again and perhaps wounded, what should I do?\"  \"Nonsense, Katharine dear, I am not going to be wounded any more.  I 've something to live for now, you see,\" he replied, smiling, taking both of her hands in his own.  \"You always had something to live for, even before--you had me.\"  \"And what was that, pray?\"  \"Your country.\"  \"Yes,\" he replied proudly, taking off his laced hat, \"and liberty; but you go together in my heart now, Kate,--you and country.\"  \"Don't say that, John--well, Seymour, then--say 'country and you.'  I would give you up for that, but only for that.\"  \"You would do well, Katharine; our country first.  Since we have engaged in this war, we must succeed.  I fancy that more depends, and I only agree with your father there, upon the issue of this war than men dream of, and that the battle of liberty for the future man is being fought right here and now.  Unless our people are willing to sacrifice everything, we cannot maintain that glorious independence which has been so brilliantly declared.\"  He said this with all the boldness of the Declaration itself; but she, being yet a woman, asked him wistfully,--  \"Would you give me up, sacrifice me for country, then?\"  \"Not for the whole wide--\"  She laid a finger upon his lips.  \"Hush, hush!  Do not even speak treason to the creed.  I am a daughter of Virginia.  My father, my brother, my friends, my people, and, yes, I will say it, my lover are perilling their lives and have engaged their honor in this contest for the independence of these colonies, for the cause of this people, and the safeguarding of their liberties; and if I stood in the pathway of liberty for a single instant, I should despise the man who would not sweep me aside without a moment's hesitation.\" She spoke with a pride and spirit which equalled his own, her head high in the air, and her eyes flashing.  She had released her hands and had suited the gesture to the word, throwing out her hand and arm with a movement of splendid freedom and defiance.  She was a woman of many moods and \"infinite variety.\"  Each moment showed him something new to love.  He caught the outstretched hand,--the loose sleeve had fallen back from the wrist,--he pressed his lips to the white arm, and said with all his soul in his voice,--  \"May God prevent me from ever facing the necessity of a choice like that, Katharine!  But indeed it is spirit like yours which makes men believe the cause is not wholly desperate.  When our women can so speak and feel, we may confidently expect the blessing of God upon our efforts.\"  \"Father says that it is because General Washington knows the spirit of the people, because he feels that even the youths and maidens, the little children, cherish this feeling, he takes heart, and is confident of ultimate success.  I heard him say that no king could stand against a united people.\"  \"Would that you could have been in Paris with your father when he pleaded with King Louis and his ministers for aid and recognition!  We might have returned with a better answer than paltry money and a few thousand stand of arms, which are only promised, after all.\"  \"Would that I were a man instead of being a weak, feeble woman!\" she exclaimed vehemently.  \"Ah, but I very much prefer you as you are, Katharine, and 't is not little that you can do.  You can inspire men with your own patriotism, if you will.  There, for instance, is your friend Talbot.  If you could persuade him, with his wealth and position and influence in this country, to join the army in New Jersey--\"  As she shook her head, he continued:  \"I am sure if he thought as I do of you, you could persuade him to anything but treachery or dishonor.\"  His calm smile of superiority vanished in an expression of dismay at her reply,--  \"Talbot!  Hilary Talbot!  Why, John, do you know that he is--well, they say that he is in love with me.  Everybody expects that we shall marry some day.  Do you see?  These old estates join, and--\"  \"Kate, it is n't true, is it?  You don't care for him, do you?\" he interrupted in sudden alarm.  \"Care for him?  Why, of course I care for him.  I have known him ever since I was a child; but I don't love him.  Besides, he stays at home while others are in the field.  Silly boy, would I have let you kiss me in the summer-house if it were so?  No, sir!  We are not such fine ladies as your friends in the city of Philadelphia, perhaps, we Virginia country girls upon whom your misses look with scorn, but no man kisses us, and no man kisses me, upon the lips except the one I--that I must--let me see--is the word 'obey'?  Shall you make me obey you all the time, John?\"  \"Pshaw, Katharine, you never obey anybody,--so your father says, at least,--and if you will only love me, that will be sufficient.\"  \"Love you!\"--the night had fallen and no one was near--\"love you, John!\"  She kissed him bravely upon the lips.  \"Once, that's for me, my own; twice, that's for my country; there is all my heart.  Come, sir, we must go in.  There are lights in the house.\"  \"Ah, Katharine, and there is light in my heart too.\"  As they came up the steps of the high pillared porch which completely covered the face of the building, they were met, at the great door which gave entrance to the spacious hallway extending through the house, by a stately and gracious, if somewhat elderly gentleman.  There was a striking similarity, if not in facial appearance, at least in the erect carriage and free air, between him and the young girl who, disregarding his outstretched hand and totally disorganizing his ceremonious bow, threw her arms about his neck and kissed him with unwonted warmth, much to his dismay and yet not altogether to his displeasure.  Perhaps he suspected something from the bright and happy faces of the two young people; but if so, he made no comment, merely telling them that supper had been waiting this long time, and bidding them hasten their preparation for the meal.  Katharine, followed by Chloe, her black maid, who had been waiting for her, hastily ran up the stairs to her own apartments, upon this signal, but turned upon the topmost stair and waved a kiss to the two gentlemen who were watching her,--one with the dim eyes of an old father, the other with the bright eyes of a young lover.  \"Colonel Wilton,\" exclaimed Seymour, impulsively, \"I have something to say to you,--something I must say.\"  \"Not now, my young friend,\" replied the colonel, genially.  \"Supper will be served, nay, is served already, and only awaits you and Katharine; afterward we shall have the whole evening, and you may say what you will.\"  \"Oh, but, colonel--\"  \"Nay, sir, do not lay upon me the unpleasant duty of commanding a guest, when it is my privilege as host to entreat.  Go, Mr. Seymour, and make you ready.  Katharine will return in a moment, and it does not beseem gentlemen, much less officers, to keep a lady waiting, you know. Philip and Bentley have gone fishing, and I am informed they will not return until late.  We will not wait for them.\"  \"As you wish, sir, but I must have some private conversation with you as soon as possible.\"  \"After supper, my boy, after supper.\"     CHAPTER III  _Colonel Wilton._  Left to himself for a moment, the colonel heaved a deep sigh; he had a premonition of what was coming, and then paced slowly up and down the long hall.  He was attired, with all the splendor of an age in which the subject of dress engrossed the attention of the wisest and best, in the height of the prevailing mode, which his recent arrival from Paris, then as now the mould of fashion, permitted him to determine.  The soft light from the wax candles in their sconces in the hall fell upon his thickly powdered wig, ran in little ripples up and down the length of his polished dress-sword, and sparkled in the brilliants in the buckles of his shoes.  His face was the grave face of a man accustomed from of old not only to command, but to assume the responsibility of his orders; when they were carried out, his manner was a happy mixture of the haughty sternness of a soldier and the complacent suavity of the courtier, tempered both by the spirit of frankness and geniality born of the free life of a Virginia planter in colonial times.  In his early youth he had been a soldier under Admiral Vernon, with his old and long-deceased friend Lawrence Washington at Cartagena; later on, he had served under Wolfe at Quebec.  A visitor, and a welcome one too, at half the courts of Europe, he looked the man of affairs he was; in spite of his advanced age, he held himself as erect, and carried himself as proudly as he had done on the Heights of Abraham or in the court of St. Germain.  Too old to incur the hardships of the field, Colonel Wilton had yet offered his services, with the ardor of the youngest patriot, to his country, and pledged his fortune, by no means inconsiderable, in its support.  The Congress, glad to avail themselves of the services of so distinguished a man, had sent him, in company with"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20795"],["title","The Cricket on the Hearth (#1)"],["body","sentiments, it threw off all moroseness, all reserve, and burst into a stream of song so cosy and hilarious as never maudlin nightingale yet formed the least idea of.  So plain, too! Bless you, you might have understood it like a book--better than some books you and I could name, perhaps. With its warm breath gushing forth in a light cloud which merrily and gracefully ascended a few feet, then hung about the chimney-corner as its own domestic Heaven, it trolled its song with that strong energy of cheerfulness, that its iron body hummed and stirred upon the fire; and the lid itself, the recently rebellious lid--such is the influence of a bright example--performed a sort of jig, and clattered like a deaf and dumb young cymbal that had never known the use of its twin brother.  That this song of the kettle's was a song of invitation and welcome to somebody out of doors: to somebody at that moment coming on towards the snug small home and the crisp fire: there is no doubt whatever. Mrs. Peerybingle knew it perfectly, as she sat musing before the hearth. It's a dark night, sang the kettle, and the rotten leaves are lying by the way; and, above, all is mist and darkness, and, below, all is mire and clay; and there's only one relief in all the sad and murky air; and I don't know that it is one, for it's nothing but a glare; of deep and angry crimson, where the sun and wind together; set a brand upon the clouds for being guilty of such weather; and the widest open country is a long dull streak of black; and there's hoar frost on the finger-post, and thaw upon the track; and the ice it isn't water, and the water isn't free; and you couldn't say that anything is what it ought to be; but he's coming, coming, coming!--  And here, if you like, the Cricket DID chime in! with a Chirrup, Chirrup, Chirrup of such magnitude, by way of chorus; with a voice so astoundingly disproportionate to its size, as compared with the kettle; (size! you couldn't see it!) that, if it had then and there burst itself like an overcharged gun, if it had fallen a victim on the spot, and chirruped its little body into fifty pieces, it would have seemed a natural and inevitable consequence, for which it had expressly laboured.  The kettle had had the last of its solo performance. It persevered with undiminished ardour; but the Cricket took first fiddle, and kept it. Good Heaven, how it chirped! Its shrill, sharp, piercing voice resounded through the house, and seemed to twinkle in the outer darkness like a star. There was an indescribable little trill and tremble in it at its loudest, which suggested its being carried off its legs, and made to leap again, by its own intense enthusiasm. Yet they went very well together, the Cricket and the kettle. The burden of the song was still the same; and louder, louder, louder still, they sang it in their emulation.  The fair little listener--for fair she was, and young; though something of what is called the dumpling shape; but I don't myself object to that--lighted a candle, glanced at the Hay-maker on the top of the clock, who was getting in a pretty average crop of minutes; and looked out of the window, where she saw nothing, owing to the darkness, but her own face imaged in the glass. And my opinion is (and so would yours have been) that she might have looked a long way and seen nothing half so agreeable. When she came back, and sat down in her former seat, the Cricket and the kettle were still keeping it up, with a perfect fury of competition. The kettle's weak side clearly being that he didn't know when he was beat.  There was all the excitement of a race about it. Chirp, chirp, chirp! Cricket a mile ahead. Hum, hum, hum--m--m! Kettle making play in the distance, like a great top. Chirp, chirp, chirp! Cricket round the corner. Hum, hum, hum--m--m! Kettle sticking to him in his own way; no idea of giving in. Chirp, chirp, chirp! Cricket fresher than ever. Hum, hum, hum--m--m! Kettle slow and steady. Chirp, chirp, chirp! Cricket going in to finish him. Hum, hum, hum--m--m! Kettle not to be finished. Until at last they got so jumbled together, in the hurry-skurry, helter-skelter, of the match, that whether the kettle chirped and the Cricket hummed, or the Cricket chirped and the kettle hummed, or they both chirped and both hummed, it would have taken a clearer head than yours or mine to have decided with anything like certainty. But of this there is no doubt: that, the kettle and the Cricket, at one and the same moment, and by some power of amalgamation best known to themselves, sent, each, his fireside song of comfort streaming into a ray of the candle that shone out through the window, and a long way down the lane. And this light, bursting on a certain person who, on the instant, approached towards it through the gloom, expressed the whole thing to him, literally in a twinkling, and cried, \"Welcome home, old fellow! Welcome home, my boy!\"  This end attained, the kettle, being dead beat, boiled over, and was taken off the fire. Mrs. Peerybingle then went running to the door, where, what with the wheels of a cart, the tramp of a horse, the voice of a man, the tearing in and out of an excited dog, and the surprising and mysterious appearance of a baby, there was soon the very What's-his-name to play.  Where the baby came from, or how Mrs. Peerybingle got hold of it in that flash of time, _I_ don't know. But a live baby there was in Mrs. Peerybingle's arms; and a pretty tolerable amount of pride she seemed to have in it, when she was drawn gently to the fire, by a sturdy figure of a man, much taller and much older than herself, who had to stoop a long way down to kiss her. But she was worth the trouble. Six foot six, with the lumbago, might have done it.  \"Oh goodness, John!\" said Mrs. P. \"What a state you're in with the weather!\"  [Illustration: _\"A dot and\"--here he glanced at the baby--\"a dot and carry--I won't say it, for fear I should spoil it; but I was very near a joke.\"_]  He was something the worse for it undeniably. The thick mist hung in clots upon his eyelashes like candied thaw; and, between the fog and fire together, there were rainbows in his very whiskers.  \"Why, you see, Dot,\" John made answer slowly, as he unrolled a shawl from about his throat, and warmed his hands; \"it--it an't exactly summer weather. So no wonder.\"  \"I wish you wouldn't call me Dot, John. I don't like it,\" said Mrs. Peerybingle: pouting in a way that clearly showed she _did_ like it very much.  \"Why, what else are you?\" returned John, looking down upon her with a smile, and giving her waist as light a squeeze as his huge hand and arm could give. \"A dot and\"--here he glanced at the baby--\"a dot and carry--I won't say it, for fear I should spoil it; but I was very near a joke. I don't know as ever I was nearer.\"  He was often near to something or other very clever, by his own account: this lumbering, slow, honest John; this John so heavy, but so light of spirit; so rough upon the surface, but so gentle at the core; so dull without, so quick within; so stolid, but so good! Oh, Mother Nature, give thy children the true poetry of heart that hid itself in this poor Carrier's breast--he was but a Carrier, by the way--and we can bear to have them talking prose, and leading lives of prose; and bear to bless thee for their company!  It was pleasant to see Dot, with her little figure and her baby in her arms: a very doll of a baby: glancing with a coquettish thoughtfulness at the fire, and inclining her delicate little head just enough on one side to let it rest in an odd, half-natural, half-affected, wholly nestling and agreeable manner, on the great rugged figure of the Carrier. It was pleasant to see him, with his tender awkwardness, endeavouring to adapt his rude support to her slight need, and make his burly middle age a leaning-staff not inappropriate to her blooming youth. It was pleasant to observe how Tilly Slowboy, waiting in the background for the baby, took special cognizance (though in her earliest teens) of this grouping; and stood with her mouth and eyes wide open, and her head thrust forward, taking it in as if it were air. Nor was it less agreeable to observe how John the Carrier, reference being made by Dot to the aforesaid baby, checked his hand when on the point of touching the infant, as if he thought he might crack it; and, bending down, surveyed it from a safe distance, with a kind of puzzled pride, such as an amiable mastiff might be supposed to show if he found himself, one day, the father of a young canary.  \"An't he beautiful, John? Don't he look precious in his sleep?\"  \"Very precious,\" said John. \"Very much so. He generally _is_ asleep, an't he?\"  \"Lor, John! Good gracious, no!\"  \"Oh!\" said John, pondering. \"I thought his eyes was generally shut. Halloa!\"  \"Goodness, John, how you startle one!\"  \"It an't right for him to turn 'em up in that way,\" said the astonished Carrier, \"is it? See how he's winking with both of 'em at once! and look at his mouth! Why, he's gasping like a gold and silver fish!\"  \"You don't deserve to be a father, you don't,\" said Dot, with all the dignity of an experienced matron. \"But how should you know what little complaints children are troubled with, John? You wouldn't so much as know their names, you stupid fellow.\" And when she had turned the baby over on her left arm, and had slapped its back as a restorative, she pinched her husband's ear, laughing.  \"No,\" said John, pulling off his outer coat. \"It's very true, Dot. I don't know much about it. I only know that I've been fighting pretty stiffly with the wind to-night. It's been blowing north-east, straight into the cart, the whole way home.\"  \"Poor old man, so it has!\" cried Mrs. Peerybingle, instantly becoming very active. \"Here, take the precious darling, Tilly, while I make myself of some use. Bless it, I could smother it with kissing it, I could! Hie then, good dog! Hie, Boxer, boy! Only let me make the tea first,"]]]
