After that the line ran steadily for a few seconds, and no signals came. Then it ceased to run, and poor Oliver's fears began to rush in upon him again, but he was speedily relieved by feeling three distinct and vigorous pulls.  \"Thank God, he's safe,\" cried the boy.  \"Now then, pass along the hawser--quick!\"  This was done, the light line was attached to a three-inch rope, and the party on the wreck waited anxiously.  \"Give it a pull, Olly, by way of signal,\" suggested Master Trench.  \"He did not tell me to do that, father,\" returned the boy, hesitating.  \"No doubt he forgot it in the hurry--try it, anyhow.\"  A hearty pull on the line was accordingly given, and they soon had the satisfaction of seeing the hawser move over the side and run towards the shore.  When it ceased to run out they knew that Paul must have got hold of the end of it, so, making their end fast to the heel of the bowsprit, they waited, for as yet the rope lay deep in the heaving waters, and quite useless as a means of escape.  Presently the rope began to jerk, then it tightened, soon the bight of it rose out of the sea and remained there--rigid.  \"Well done, Paul,\" exclaimed the skipper, when this was accomplished. \"Now, Olly, you go first, you're light.\"  But the boy hesitated.  \"No, father, you first,\" he said.  \"Obey orders, Olly,\" returned the skipper sternly.  Without another word Oliver got upon the rope and proceeded to clamber along it.  The operation was by no means easy, but the boy was strong and active, and the water not very cold.  It leaped up and drenched him, however, as he passed the lowest point of the bight, and thereafter the weight of his wet garments delayed him, so that on nearing the shore he was pretty well exhausted.  There, however, he found Paul up to the waist in the sea waiting for him, and the last few yards of the journey were traversed in his friend's arms.  By means of this rope was every man of the _Water Wagtail's_ crew saved from a watery grave.  They found that the island on which they had been cast was sufficiently large to afford them shelter, and a brief survey of it proved that there was both wood and water enough to serve them, but nothing of animal or vegetable life was to be found.  This was serious, because all their provisions were lost with the wrecked portion of the ship, so that starvation stared them in the face.  \"If only the rum-kegs had been saved,\" said one of the men, when they assembled, after searching the island, to discuss their prospects, \"we might, at least, have led a merry life while it lasted.\"  \"Humph!  Much good that would do you when you came to think over it in the next world,\" said Grummidge contemptuously.  \"I don't believe in the next world,\" returned the first speaker gruffly.  \"A blind man says he doesn't see the sun, and don't believe in it,\" rejoined Grummidge: \"does that prove that there's no sun?\"  Here Master Trench interposed.  \"My lads,\" he said, \"don't you think that instead of talking rubbish it would be wise to scatter yourselves along the coast and see what you can pick up from the wreck?  Depend on't some of the provisions have been stranded among the rocks, and, as they will be smashed to pieces before long, the sooner we go about it the better.  The truth is, that while you have been wastin' your time running about the island, Master Burns and I have been doin' this, an' we've saved some things already--among them a barrel of pork.  Come, rouse up and go to work--some to the shore, others to make a camp in the bush.\"  This advice seemed so good that the men acted on it at once, with the result that before dark they had rescued two more barrels of pork and a barrel of flour from the grasp of the sea, besides some cases of goods which they had not taken time to examine.  Returning from the shore together, laden with various rescued articles, Paul and Oliver halted and sat down on a rock to rest for a few minutes.  \"Olly,\" said the former, \"what was that I saw you wrapping up in a bit of tarred canvas, and stuffing so carefully under the breast of your coat, soon after the ship struck?\"  \"Mother's last letter to me,\" said the boy, with a flush of pleasure as he tapped his breast.  \"I have it safe here, and scarcely damaged at all.\"  \"Strange,\" remarked Paul, as he pulled a well-covered packet from his own breast-pocket; \"strange that your mind and mine should have been running on the same subject.  See here, this is _my_ mother's last gift to me before she died--a letter, too, but it is God's letter to fallen man.\"  With great care the young man unrolled the packet and displayed a well-worn manuscript copy of a portion of the Gospel of John.  \"This is copied,\" he said, \"from the translation of God's Word by the great Wycliffe.  It was given to my mother by an old friend, and was, as I have said, her parting gift to me.\"  The friends were interrupted in their examination of this interesting M.S. by the arrival of one of the sailors, with whom they returned to the encampment in the bush.    CHAPTER THREE.  FIRST EXPERIENCES ON THE ISLAND.  A wonderfully picturesque appearance did these shipwrecked mariners present that night when, under the shelter of the shrubbery that crowned their small island, they kindled several camp-fires, and busied themselves in preparing supper.  As there was no law in the island--and our skipper, having lost his ship, forbore to assert any right to command--every one naturally did what seemed right in his own eyes.  As yet there had arisen no bone of contention among them.  Of food they had secured enough for at least a few days.  Fire they had procured by means of flint, steel, and tinder.  A clear spring furnished them with water, and ships' buckets washed ashore enabled them to convey the same to their encampment.  Fortunately, no rum-kegs had been found, so that evil passions were not stirred up, and, on the whole, the first night on the island was spent in a fair degree of harmony--considering the character of the men.  Those who had been kindred souls on board ship naturally drew together on shore, and kindled their several fires apart.  Thus it came to pass that the skipper and his son, the two mates, and Paul Burns found themselves assembled round the same fire.  But the two mates, it is right to add, were only sympathetic in a small degree, because of their former position as officers, and their recent imprisonment together.  In reality they were men of no principle and of weak character, whose tendency was always to throw in their lot with the winning side.  Being a little uncertain as to which was the winning side that night, they had the wisdom to keep their own counsel.  Oliver presided over the culinary department.  \"You see, I'm rather fond of cookin',\" he said, apologetically, \"that's why I take it in hand.\"  \"Ah, that comes of his bein' a good boy to his mother,\" said Master Trench in explanation, and with a nod of approval.  \"Olly was always ready to lend her a helpin' hand in the house at anything that had to be done, which has made him a Jack-of-all-trades--cookin' among the rest, as you see.\"  \"A pity that the means of displaying his powers are so limited,\" said Paul, who busied himself in levelling the ground beside the fire for their beds.  \"Limited!\" exclaimed Trench, \"you are hard to please, Master Paul; I have lived on worse food than salt pork and pancakes.\"  \"If so, father,\" said Oliver, as he deftly tossed one of the cakes into the air and neatly caught it on its other side in the pan, \"you must either have had the pork without the pancakes or the pancakes without the pork.\"  \"Nay, Master Shallowpate, I had neither.\"  \"What! did you live on nothing?\"  \"On nothing better than boiled sheepskin--and it was uncommon tough as well as tasteless; but it is wonderful what men will eat when they're starving.\"  \"I think, father,\" returned the boy, as he tossed and deftly caught the cake again, \"that it is more wonderful what men will eat when they're _not_ starving!  Of all the abominations that mortal man ever put between his grinders, I think the worst is that vile stuff--\"  He was interrupted by a sudden outbreak of wrath at the fire next to theirs, where Big Swinton, Grummidge, and several others were engaged, like themselves, in preparing supper.  \"There will be trouble in the camp before long, I see plainly enough,\" remarked Paul, looking in the direction of the disputants.  \"These two men, Swinton and Grummidge, are too well-matched in body and mind and self-will to live at peace, and I foresee that they will dispute your right to command.\"  \"They won't do that, Paul,\" returned Trench quietly, \"for I have already given up a right which I no longer possess.  When the _Water Wagtail_ went on the rocks, my reign came to an end.  For the future we have no need to concern ourselves.  The man with the most powerful will and the strongest mind will naturally come to the top--and that's how it _should_ be.  I think that all the troubles of mankind arise from our interfering with the laws of Nature.\"  \"Agreed, heartily,\" replied Paul, \"only I would prefer to call them the laws of God.  By the way, Master Trench, I have not yet told you that I have in my possession some of these same laws in a book.\"  \"Have you, indeed?--in a book!  That's a rare and not altogether a safe possession now-a-days.\"  \"You speak the sober truth, Master Trench,\" returned Paul, putting his hand into a breast-pocket and drawing forth the packet which contained the fragment of the Gospel of John.  \"Persecution because of our beliefs is waxing hotter and hotter just now in unfortunate England.  However, we run no risk of being roasted alive in Newfoundland for reading God's blessed Word--see, there it is.  A portion of the Gospel of John in manuscript, copied from the English translation of good Master Wycliffe.\"  \"A good and true man, I've heard say,\" responded"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21711"],["title","The World of Ice (#1)"],["body","had spread through the ship, and the crew, consisting of upwards of thirty men, were conversing earnestly in knots of four or five while they sharpened and buckled on cutlasses, or loaded pistols and carbines.  \"Send the men aft, Mr Thompson,\" said the captain, as he paced the deck to and fro, casting his eyes occasionally on the schooner, which was rapidly nearing the vessel.  \"Take another pull at these main-topsail-halyards, and send the steward down below for my sword and pistols.  Let the men look sharp; we've no time to lose, and hot work is before us.\"  \"I will go for your sword, Father,\" cried Fred, who had just come on deck.  \"Boy, boy, you must go below; you can be of no use here.\"  \"But, Father, you know that I'm not _afraid_.\"  \"I know that, boy; I know it well; but you're too young to fight; you're not strong enough; besides, you must comfort and cheer your mother, she may want you.\"  \"I am old enough and strong enough to load and fire a pistol, Father; and I heard one of the men say we would need all the hands on board, and more if we had them; besides, it was my mother who told me what was going on, and sent me on deck to _help you to fight_.\"  A momentary gleam of pride lit up the countenance of the captain as he said hastily: \"You may stay, then,\" and turned towards the men, who now stood assembled on the quarterdeck.  Addressing the crew in his own blunt, vigorous style, he said: \"Lads, yon rascally schooner is a pirate, as you all know well enough.  I need not ask you if you are ready to fight--I see by your looks you are.  But that's not enough--you must make up your minds to fight _well_.  You know that pirates give no quarter.  I see the decks are swarming with men.  If you don't go at them like bull-dogs you'll walk the plank before sunset, every man of you.  Now, go forward, and double-shot your muskets and pistols, and stick as many of the latter into your belts as they will hold.  Mr Thompson, let the gunner double-shot the four big guns, and load the little carronade with musket balls to the muzzle.  If they do try to board us, they'll get a warm reception.\"  \"There goes a shot, sir,\" said Buzzby, pointing towards the piratical schooner, from the side of which a white cloud burst and a round shot ricochetted over the sea, passing close ahead of the ship.  \"Ay, that's a request for us to lay-to,\" said the captain bitterly, \"but we won't.  Keep her away a point.\"  \"Ay, ay, sir,\" sung out the man at the wheel.  A second and third shot were fired, but passed unheeded, and the captain, fully expecting that the next would be fired into them, ordered the men below.  \"We can't afford to lose a man, Mr Thompson; send them all down.\"  \"Please, sir, may I remain?\" said Buzzby, touching his hat.  \"Obey orders,\" answered the captain sternly.  The sailor went below with a sulky fling.  For nearly an hour the two vessels cut through the water before a steady breeze, during which time the fast-sailing schooner gradually overhauled the heavy West-Indiaman, until she approached within speaking distance. Still Captain Ellice paid no attention to her, but stood with compressed lips beside the man at the wheel, gazing alternately at the sails of his vessel, and at the windward horizon, where he fancied he saw indications that led him to hope the breeze would fail ere long.  As the schooner drew nearer, a man leaped on the hammock-nettings, and, putting a trumpet to his mouth, sang out lustily: \"Ship ahoy, where are you from and what's your cargo?\"  Captain Ellice made no reply, but ordered four of his men on deck to point one of the stern-chasers.  Again the voice came harshly across the waves, as if in passion: \"Heave to, or I'll sink you.\"  At the same moment the black flag was run up to the peak, and a shot passed between the main and fore-mast.  \"Stand by to point this gun,\" said the captain in a subdued voice.  \"Ay, ay, sir!\"  \"Fetch a red-hot iron; luff, luff a little--a little more--steady, so.\" At the last word there was a puff and a roar, and an iron messenger flew towards the schooner.  The gun had been fired more as a reply of defiance to the pirate, than with the hope of doing him any damage, but the shot had been well aimed--it cut the schooner's main-sail-yard in two, and brought it rattling down on deck.  Instantly the pirate yawed and delivered a broadside, but in the confusion on deck the guns were badly aimed, and none took effect.  The time lost in this manoeuvre, added to the crippled condition of the schooner, enabled the West-Indiaman to gain considerably on her antagonist, but the pirate kept up a well-directed fire with his bow-chasers, and many of the shots struck the hull, and cut the rigging seriously.  As the sun descended towards the horizon the wind fell gradually, and ceased at length altogether, so that both vessels lay rolling on the swell with their sails flapping idly against the masts.  \"They're a gittin' out the boats, sir,\" remarked John Buzzby, who, unable to restrain himself any longer, had crept upon deck at the risk of another reprimand; \"and, if my eyes be'nt deceiving me, there's a sail on the horizon to wind'ard--leastways, the direction which _wos_ wind'ard afore it fell calm.\"  \"She's bringing a breeze along with her,\" remarked the captain, \"but I fear the boats will come up before it reaches us.  There are three in the water, and manned already.  There they come.  Now, then, call up all hands.\"  In a few seconds the crew of the West-Indiaman were at their stations, ready for action, and Captain Ellice, with Fred at his elbow, stood beside one of the stern-chasers.  Meanwhile, the boats of the pirate-- five in number--pulled away in different directions, evidently with the intention of attacking the ship at different points.  They were full of men armed to the teeth.  While they rowed towards the ship the schooner resumed its fire, and one ball cut away the spanker boom, and slightly wounded two of the men with splinters.  The guns of the ship were now brought to bear on the boats, but without effect, although the shot plunged into the water all round them.  As they drew nearer, a brisk fire of musketry was opened on them, and the occasional falling of an oar and confusion on board showed that the shots told.  The pirates replied vigorously, but without effect, as the men of the ship were sheltered by the bulwarks.  \"Pass the word to load and reserve fire,\" said the captain, \"and hand me a musket, Fred.  Load again as fast as I fire.\"  So saying, the captain took aim, and fired at the steersman of the largest boat, which pulled towards the stern.  \"Another, Fred--\"  At this moment a withering volley was poured upon the boat, and a savage yell of agony followed, while the rowers--who remained unhurt--paused for an instant as if paralysed.  Next instant they recovered, and another stroke would have brought them almost alongside, when Captain Ellice pointed the little carronade and fired.  There was a terrific crash, the gun recoiled violently to the other side of the deck, and the pirate boat sank, leaving the sea covered with dead and wounded men.  A number, however, who seemed to bear charmed lives, seized their cutlasses with their teeth, and swam boldly for the ship.  This incident, unfortunately, attracted too much of the attention of the crew, and, ere they could prevent it, another boat reached the bow of the ship, the crew of which sprang up the side like cats, formed on the forecastle, and poured a volley upon the men.  \"Follow me, lads,\" shouted the captain, as he sprang forward like a tiger.  The first man he reached fell by a ball from his pistol; in another moment the opposing parties met in a hand-to-hand conflict. Meanwhile Fred, having been deeply impressed with the effect of the shot from the little carronade, succeeded in raising and reloading it.  He had scarcely accomplished this when one of the boats reached the larboard quarter, and two of the men sprang up the side.  Fred observed them, and felled the first with a handspike before he reached the deck, but the pirate who instantly followed, would have killed him, had he not been observed by the second mate, who had prevented several of the men from joining in the melee on the forecastle, in order to meet such an emergency as this.  Rushing to the rescue with his party, he drove the pirates back into the boat, which was immediately pulled towards the bow, where the other two boats were now grappling and discharging their crews on the forecastle.  Although the men of the West-Indiaman fought with desperate courage, they could not stand before the increasing numbers of pirates, who now crowded the forepart of the ship in a dense mass.  Gradually they were beaten back, and at length were brought to bay on the quarter-deck.  \"Help, Father!\" cried Fred, pushing through the struggling crowd, \"here's the carronade ready loaded.\"  \"Ha! boy, well done!\" cried the captain, seizing the gun, and, with the help of Buzzby, who never left his side, dragging it forward.  \"Clear the way, lads!\"  In a moment the little cannon was pointed to the centre of the mass of men, and fired.  One awful shriek of agony rose above the din of the fight, as a wide gap was cut through the crowd; but this only seemed to render the survivors more furious.  With a savage yell they charged the quarter-deck, but were hurled back again and again by the captain, and a few chosen men who stood around him.  At length one of the pirates, who had been all along conspicuous for his strength and daring, stepped deliberately up, and, pointing a pistol at the captain's breast, fired. Captain Ellice fell, and at the same moment a ball laid the pirate low; another charge was made; Fred rushed forward to protect his father, but was thrown down and trodden under foot in the rush, and in two minutes more the ship was in possession of the pirates.  Being filled with rage at the opposition they had met with, these villains proceeded, as"]]]
