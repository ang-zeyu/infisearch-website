THE TEA-PARTY--ACCIDENTS AND INCIDENTS OF A MINOR KIND--GLYNN PROCTOR GETS INTO TROUBLE.  On the evening of the day in which the foregoing scenes were enacted, the Misses Dunning prepared a repast for their brother and one or two of his officers, who were to spend the last evening in port there, and discuss various important and unimportant matters in a sort of semi-convivio-business way.  An event of this kind was always of the deepest interest and productive of the most intense anxiety to the amiable though starched sisters; first, because it was of rare occurrence; and second, because they were never quite certain that it would pass without some unhappy accident, such as the upsetting of a tea-cup or a kettle, or the scalding of the cat, not to mention visitors' legs.  They seemed to regard a tea-party in the light of a firearm--a species of blunderbuss--a thing which, it was to be hoped, would \"go off well\"; and, certainly, if loading the table until it groaned had anything to do with the manner of its \"going off,\" there was every prospect of its doing so with pre-eminent success upon that occasion.  But besides the anxieties inseparable from the details of the pending festivities, the Misses Dunning were overwhelmed and weighed down with additional duties consequent upon their brother's sudden and unexpected determination.  Little Ailie had to be got ready for sea by the following morning!  It was absolute and utter insanity!  No one save a madman or a sea-captain could have conceived such a thing, much less have carried it into effect tyrannically.  The Misses Dunning could not attempt any piece of duty or work separately.  They always acted together, when possible; and might, in fact, without much inconvenience, have been born Siamese twins. Whatever Martha did, Jane attempted to do or to mend; wherever Jane went, Martha followed.  Not, by any means, that one thought she could improve upon the work of the other; their conduct was simply the result of a desire to assist each other mutually.  When Martha spoke, Jane echoed or corroborated; and when Jane spoke, Martha repeated her sentences word for word in a scarcely audible whisper--not after the other had finished, but during the course of the remarks.  With such dispositions and propensities, it is not a matter to be wondered at that the good ladies, while arranging the tea-table, should suddenly remember some forgotten article of Ailie's wardrobe, and rush simultaneously into the child's bedroom to rectify the omission; or, when thus engaged, be filled with horror at the thought of having left the buttered toast too near the fire in the parlour.  \"It is really quite perplexing,\" said Martha, sitting down with a sigh, and regarding the tea-table with a critical gaze; \"quite perplexing. I'm sure I don't know how I shall bear it.  It is too bad of George-- darling Ailie--(dear me, Jane, how crookedly you have placed the urn)-- it is really too bad.\"  \"Too bad, indeed; yes, isn't it?\" echoed Jane, in reference to the captain's conduct, while she assisted Martha, who had risen to readjust the urn.  \"Oh!\" exclaimed Martha, with a look of horror.  \"What?\" cried Jane, who looked and felt equally horrified, although she knew not yet the cause.  \"The eggs!\"  \"The eggs?\"  \"Yes, the eggs.  You know every one of the last dozen we got was bad, and we've forgot to send for more,\" said Martha.  \"For more; so we have!\" cried Jane; and both ladies rushed into the kitchen, gave simultaneous and hurried orders to the servant-girl, and sent her out of the house impressed with an undefined feeling that life or death depended on the instant procuring of two dozen fresh eggs.  It may be as well to remark here, that the Misses Dunning, although stiff, and starched, and formal, had the power of speeding nimbly from room to room, when alone and when occasion required, without in the least degree losing any of their stiffness or formality, so that we do not use the terms \"rush,\" \"rushed,\" or \"rushing\" inappropriately. Nevertheless, it may also be remarked that they never acted in a rapid or impulsive way in company, however small in numbers or unceremonious in character the company might be--always excepting the servant-girl and the cat, to whose company, from long habit, they had become used, and therefore indifferent.  The sisters were on their knees, stuffing various articles into a large trunk, and Ailie was looking on, by way of helping, with very red and swollen eyes, and the girl was still absent in quest of eggs, when a succession of sounding blows were administered to the green door, and a number of gruff voices were heard conversing without.  \"_There_!\" cried Martha and Jane, with bitter emphasis, looking in each other's faces as if to say, \"We knew it.  Before that girl was sent away for these eggs, we each separately and privately prophesied that they would arrive, and that we should have to open the door.  And you see, so it has happened, and we are not ready!\"  But there was no time for remark.  The case was desperate.  Both sisters felt it to be so, and acted accordingly, while Ailie, having been forbidden to open the door, sat down on her trunk, and looked on in surprise.  They sprang up, washed their hands simultaneously in the same basin, with the same piece of soap broken in two; dried them with the same towel, darted to the mirror, put on two identically similar clean tall caps, leaped down-stairs, opened the door with slow dignity of demeanour, and received their visitors in the hall with a calmness and urbanity of manner that contrasted rather strangely with their flushed countenances and heaving bosoms.  \"Hallo!  Ailie!\" exclaimed the captain, as his daughter pulled down his head to be kissed.  \"Why, you take a fellow all aback, like a white squall.  Are you ready, my pet?  Kit stowed and anchor tripped?  Come this way, and let us talk about it.  Dear me, Martha, you and Jane--look as if you had been running a race, eh?  Here are my messmates come to talk a bit with you.  My sisters, Martha and Jane--Dr Hopley.\"  (Dr Hopley bowed politely.) \"My first mate, Mr Millons\" (Mr Millons also bowed, somewhat loosely); \"and Rokens--Tim Rokens, my chief harpooner.\" (Mr Rokens pulled his forelock, and threw back his left leg, apparently to counterbalance the bend in his body.) \"He didn't want to come; said he warn't accustomed to ladies' society; but I told him you warn't ladies--a--I don't mean that--not ladies o' the high-flyin' fashionable sort, that give themselves airs, you know.  Come along, Ailie.\"  While the captain ran on in this strain, hung up his hat, kissed Ailie, and ran his fingers through his shaggy locks, the Misses Dunning performed a mingled bow and courtsey to each guest as his name was mentioned, and shook hands with him, after which the whole party entered the parlour, where the cat was discovered enjoying a preliminary meal of its own at one of the pats of butter.  A united shriek from Martha and Jane, a nautical howl from the guests, and a rolled-up pocket-handkerchief from Rokens sent that animal from the table as if it had received a galvanic shock.  \"I ax yer parding, ladies,\" said Mr Rokens, whose aim had been so perfect that his handkerchief not only accelerated the flight of the cat, but carried away the violated pat of butter along with it.  \"I ax yer parding, but them brutes is sich thieves--I could roast 'em alive, so I could.\"  The harpooner unrolled his handkerchief, and picking the pat of butter from its folds with his fingers, threw it into the fire.  Thereafter he smoothed down his hair, and seated himself on the extreme edge of a chair, as near the door as possible.  Not that he had any intention whatever of taking to flight, but he deemed that position to be more suited to his condition than any other.  In a few minutes the servant-girl returned with the eggs.  While she is engaged in boiling them, we shall introduce Captain Dunning's friends and messmates to the reader.  Dr Hopley was a surgeon, and a particular friend of the captain's.  He was an American by birth, but had travelled so much about the world that he had ceased to \"guess\" and \"calculate,\" and to speak through his nose. He was a man about forty, tall, big-boned, and muscular, though not fat; and besides being a gentlemanly man, was a good-natured, quiet creature, and a clever enough fellow besides, but he preferred to laugh at and enjoy the jokes and witticisms of others rather than to perpetrate any himself.  Dr Hopley was intensely fond of travelling, and being possessed of a small independence, he indulged his passion to the utmost.  He had agreed to go with Captain Dunning as the ship's doctor, simply for the sake of seeing the whale-fishery of the South Seas, having already, in a similar capacity, encountered the dangers of the North.  Dr Hopley had few weaknesses.  His chief one was an extravagant belief in phrenology.  We would not be understood to imply that phrenology is extravagant; but we assert that the doctor's belief in it was extravagant, assigning, as he did, to every real and ideal facility of the human mind \"a local habitation and a name\" in the cranium, with a corresponding depression or elevation of the surface to mark its whereabouts.  In other respects he was a commonplace sort of a man.  Mr Millons, the first mate, was a short, hale, thick-set man, without any particularly strong points of character.  He was about thirty-five, and possessed a superabundance of fair hair and whiskers, with a large, broad chin, a firm mouth, rather fierce-looking eyes, and a hasty, but by no means a bad temper.  He was a trustworthy, matter-of-fact seaman, and a good officer, but not bright intellectually.  Like most men of his class, his look implied that he did not under-estimate his own importance, and his tones were those of a man accustomed to command.  Tim Rokens was an old salt; a bluff, strong,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21715"],["title","Away in the Wilderness (#1)"],["body","connected with a life in the woods, and he could neither use a paddle nor a gun.  But Heywood's father had done him some service at a time when he was ill and in difficulties, so, as the youth was very anxious to go, he resolved to repay this good turn of the father by doing a kindness to the son.  Heywood turned out but a poor backwoodsman, but he proved to be a pleasant, amusing companion, and as Jasper and the Indian were quite sufficient for the management of the light canoe, and the good gun of the former was more than sufficient to feed the party, it mattered nothing to Jasper that Heywood spent most of his time seated in the middle of the canoe, sketching the scenery as they went along.  Still less did it matter that Heywood missed everything he fired at, whether it was close at hand or far away.  At first Jasper was disposed to look upon his young companion as a poor useless creature; and the Indian regarded him with undisguised contempt. But after they had been some time in his company, the opinions of these two men of the woods changed; for they found that the artist was wise, and well informed on many subjects of which they were extremely ignorant; and they beheld with deep admiration the beautiful and life-like drawings and paintings which he produced in rapid succession.  Such was the romantic youth who had, for the sake of seeing and painting the wilderness, joined himself to these rough sons of the forest, and who now sat in the centre of the canoe swaying his arms about and shouting with excitement as they quickly drew near to the swimming herd of deer.  \"Keep yourself still,\" said Jasper, looking over his shoulder, \"ye'll upset the canoe if ye go on like that.\"  \"Give me the axe, give me the axe, I'll kill him!\" cried Heywood.  \"Take your pencil and draw him,\" observed the hunter, with a quiet laugh.  \"Now, Arrowhead, two good strokes of the paddle will do--there-- so.\"  As he spoke the canoe glanced up alongside of an affrighted deer, and in the twinkling of an eye Jasper's long knife was in its heart, and the water was dyed with blood.  This happened quite near to the opposite shore of the lake, so that in little more than half an hour after it was killed the animal was cut up and packed, and the canoe was again speeding towards the upper end of the lake, where the party arrived just as night began to fling its dark mantle over the wilderness.    CHAPTER THREE.  THE ENCAMPMENT.  Camping out in the woods at night is truly a delightful thing, and the pleasantest part of it, perhaps, is the lighting of the fire.  Light is agreeable to human eyes and cheering to the human heart.  Solomon knew and felt that when he penned the words, \"A pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun.\"  And the rising of the sun is scarcely more grateful to the feelings than the lighting of a fire on a dark night. So our friends thought and felt, when the fire blazed up, but they were too busy and too hungry at the time to think about the state of their feelings.  The Indian was hungry.  A good fire had to be made before the venison could be roasted, so he gave his whole attention to the felling of dry trees and cutting them up into logs for the fire.  Jasper was also hungry, and a slight shower had wetted all the moss and withered grass, so he had enough to do to strike fire with flint and steel, catch a spark on a little piece of tinder, and then blow and coax the spark into a flame.  The artist was indeed free to indulge in a little meditation; but he had stumbled in the dark on landing, and bruised his shins, so he could only sit down on a rock and rub them and feel miserable.  But the fire soon caught; branches were heaped up, great logs were piled on, forked tongues of flame began to leap up and lick the branches of the overhanging trees.  The green leaves looked rich and warm; the thick stems looked red and hot; the faces and clothes of the men seemed as if about to catch fire as they moved about the encampment preparing supper. In short, the whole scene was so extremely comfortable, in reality as well as in appearance, that Heywood forgot his bruised shins and began to rub his hands with delight.  In a very short time three juicy venison-steaks were steaming before the three travellers, and in a much shorter time they had disappeared altogether and were replaced by three new ones.  The mode of cooking was very simple.  Each steak was fixed on a piece of stick and set up before the fire to roast.  When one side was ready, the artist, who seemed to have very little patience, began to cut off pieces and eat them while the other side was cooking.  To say truth, men out in those regions have usually such good appetites that they are not particular as to the cooking of their food.  Quantity, not quality, is what they desire.  They generally feel very much like the Russian, of whom it is said, that he would be content to eat sawdust if only he _got_ _plenty_ _of_ _it_!  The steaks were washed down with tea.  There is no other drink in Rupert's Land.  The Hudson's Bay Company found that spirits were so hurtful to the Indians that they refused to send them into the country; and at the present day there is no strong drink to be had for love or money over the length and breadth of their territories, except at those places where other fur-traders oppose them, and oblige them, in self-defence, to sell fire-water, as the Indians call it.  Tea is the great--the only--drink in Rupert's Land!  Yes, laugh as ye will, ye lovers of gin and beer and whisky, one who has tried it, and has seen it tried by hundreds of stout stalwart men, tells you that the teetotaller is the best man for real hard work.  The three travellers drank their tea and smacked their lips, and grinned at each other with great satisfaction.  They could not have done more if it had been the best of brandy and they the jolliest of topers!  But the height of their enjoyment was not reached until the pipes were lighted.  It was quite a sight to see them smoke!  Jasper lay with his huge frame extended in front of the blaze, puffing clouds of smoke thick enough to have shamed a small cannon.  Arrowhead rested his back on the stump of a tree, stretched his feet towards the fire, and allowed the smoke to roll slowly through his nostrils as well as out at his mouth, so that it kept curling quietly round his nose, and up his cheeks, and into his eyes, and through his hair in a most delightful manner; at least so it would seem, for his reddish-brown face beamed with happy contentment.  Young Heywood did not smoke, but he drew forth his sketch-book and sketched his two companions; and in the practice of his beloved art, I have no doubt, he was happier than either.  \"I wonder how many trading-posts the Hudson's Bay Company has got?\" said Heywood, as he went on with his work.  \"Hundreds of 'em,\" said Jasper, pressing the red-hot tobacco into the bowl of his pipe with the end of his little finger, as slowly and coolly as if his flesh were fire-proof.  \"I don't know, exactly, how many they've got.  I doubt if anybody does, but they have them all over the country.  You've seen a little of the country now, Heywood; well, what you have seen is very much like what you will see as long as you choose to travel hereaway.  You come to a small clearing in the forest, with five or six log houses in it, a stockade round it, and a flagstaff in the middle of it; five, ten, or fifteen men, and a gentleman in charge. That's a Hudson's Bay Company's trading-post.  All round it lie the wild woods.  Go through the woods for two or three hundred miles and you'll come to another such post, or fort, as we sometimes call 'em.  That's how it is all the country over.  Although there are many of them, the country is so uncommon big that they may be said to be few and far between.  Some are bigger and some are less.  There's scarcely a settlement in the country worthy o' the name of a village except Red River.\"  \"Ah!  Red River,\" exclaimed Heywood, \"I've heard much of that settlement--hold steady--I'm drawing your _nose_ just now--have you been there, Jasper?\"  \"That have I, lad, and a fine place it is, extendin' fifty miles or more along the river, with fine fields, and handsome houses, and churches, and missionaries and schools, and what not; but the rest of Rupert's Land is just what you have seen; no roads, no houses, no cultivated fields--nothing but lakes, and rivers, and woods, and plains without end, and a few Indians here and there, with plenty of wild beasts everywhere.  These trading-posts are scattered here and there, from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and from Canada to the Frozen Sea, standin' solitary-like in the midst of the wilderness, as if they had dropped down from the clouds by mistake and didn't know exactly what to do with themselves.\"  \"How long have de Company lived?\" inquired Arrowhead, turning suddenly to Jasper.  The stout hunter felt a little put out.  \"Ahem!  I don't exactly know; but it must have been a long time, no doubt.\"  \"Oh, I can tell you that,\" cried Heywood.  \"You?\" said Jasper in surprise.  \"Ay; the Company was started nearly two hundred years ago by Prince Rupert, who was the first Governor, and that's the reason the country came to be called Rupert's Land.  You know its common name is `the Hudson's Bay Territory,' because it surrounds Hudson's Bay.\"  \"Why, where did you learn that?\" said Jasper, \"I thought I knowed a-most everything about the Company; but I must confess I never knew that about Prince Rupert before.\"  \"I learned it from books,\" said the artist.  \"Books!\" exclaimed Jasper, \"I never learned nothin' from books--more's the pity.  I git along well enough in the trappin' and shootin' way without 'em; but I'm sorry I never learned to read.  Ah!  I've a great opinion of books--so I have.\"  The worthy hunter shook his head solemnly as he said this in a low voice, more to himself than to his companions, and he continued to mutter and shake "]]]
