Night soon after descended on the sea, the wind fell almost to a calm, the moon shone round and full in a cloudless sky, and the vessel glided quietly along, while the rascally crew lay conversing and smoking on her deck, many of them bearing marks of the recent conflict, and some sleeping as peacefully as though their hands were guiltless of shedding human blood, and legitimate trade their occupation.    CHAPTER THREE.  REVEALS SOMETHING SURPRISING IN REGARD TO EUROPEAN FORBEARANCE AND PIRATIC IMPUDENCE.  Seated on a gun-carriage, apart from his comrades in sorrow, Francisco Rimini gazed in stern silence upon the moonlit sea, and thought, perchance, of the little old lady with the rippling mouth, and the dark-eyed daughter of his adoption.  \"Your fate is a sad one,\" said a deep voice close to his side.  Francisco started, and looked round with indignant surprise at Bacri.  \"None the less sad that a friend has proved false, Jew,\" he said sternly.  \"It has never been my custom to call any of your race `dog,' as too many of my creed have done in time past, but I am tempted to change my custom this night.\"  \"To misname me would do you no good and me no harm,\" replied the Jew gravely.  \"My race is an accursed one as far as man is concerned, but man's curse is of no more value than his blessing.\"  \"If these arms were free, Bacri,\" retorted Francisco hotly, \"I would teach thee that which would prove anything but a blessing to thy carcase, thou huge caitiff!  I had thought better of thee than thou didst deserve.--Go, thy bulky presence is distasteful.\"  \"Wherein have I wronged you?\" asked the Jew.  \"Wronged me!\" exclaimed Francisco, with rising wrath, \"art thou not hand and glove with the chief pirate?  Thinkest thou that my eyes have lost their power of vision?\"  \"Truly I am acquainted with the corsair, though the acquaintance was none of my seeking,\" returned the Jew, \"for, as I said before, traders have dealings with many sorts of men; but I did not advise him to attack you, and I could not hinder him.\"  \"Scoundrel!\" exclaimed the padrone, \"couldst thou not restrain thine hand when it knocked the senses out of my boy Mariano?  Wouldst have me believe that thy huge fists are not subject to thy villainous will, or that they acted as they did by mere accident, instead of aiding to repel the pirates?\"  \"I did it to save his life,\" replied Bacri, \"and not only his, but your own and the lives of all your men.  I saw that Mariano was about to prevail, and if he had slain the corsair chief, not one of you would have been alive at this moment.\"  Francisco's wrath when roused was not readily appeased, nevertheless this statement puzzled him so much that he remained silently gazing at the Jew, from sheer inability to express his feelings.  \"Listen,\" continued Bacri, drawing nearer, and speaking in a lower tone, \"the man into whose hands you have fallen is Sidi Hassan, one of the most noted and daring of the pirates on the Barbary coast.  Escape from him is impossible.  I know him well, and can assure you that your only hope of receiving anything that deserves the title of good treatment depends on your quiet and absolute subjection to his will.  Rebellious or even independent bearing will insure your speedy and severe humiliation.  We `dogs of Jews,'\" continued Bacri, with a sad smile, \"may seem to you to hang our heads rather low sometimes, but I have seen Christian men, as bold as you are, crawl upon the very dust before these Turks of Algiers.\"  \"Our fate, then,\" said Francisco, \"is, I suppose, and as I half suspected, to be slavery in that pirates' nest, Algiers?\"  \"I fear it is,\" replied the Jew, \"unless Providence permits a storm to set you free; but let me correct your notion of Algiers.  A pirates' nest it undoubtedly is, but there are others than pirates in the nest, and some of these are even honest men.\"  \"Ha!\" exclaimed the padrone, quickly and with bitterness; \"is one of these said honest men a Jew of stalwart frame, and does his connexion with the piratical nest free him from the bonds to which I and my sons are doomed?\"  \"To both questions I answer yes,\" replied the Jew.  \"Then a fig for your honesty, Master Bacri!\" said Francisco, with a toss of his head, in lieu of a snap of his fingers, which in the circumstances was impossible, \"for I now believe that you knocked Mariano down simply to save the life of your comrade Sidi Hassan, and that you will pocket your own share of my ship and cargo.\"  \"I have not the power to alter your belief,\" said the Jew quietly, as he turned away and left the unfortunate captive to his meditations.  As the night advanced the wind continued to abate, and when morning broke, the broad breast of the Mediterranean undulated like a sheet of clear glass, on which was gradually revealed the form of a strange vessel becalmed not far from the prize.  As soon as it was sufficiently light to permit of objects being clearly seen, Sidi Hassan fired a gun and showed the Algerine flag.  \"Our luck has changed,\" he said to his first officer, with an air of satisfaction.  \"Get the boats ready; we will board at once.\"  \"She shows British colours,\" said the mate, regarding the vessel in question intently through his glass.  \"So she does,\" returned the captain, \"but that device won't go down with me.  Board her at once, while I bring our broadside to bear.\"  The mate, with two boats full of armed men, soon pulled alongside the strange sail, and the pirate-vessel was brought round with her broadside to bear by means of long oars or sweeps.  In a short time the boats returned with the mortifying intelligence that the papers were all right, and that the vessel, being in truth a British merchantman, was not a legitimate prize.  The corsair therefore sailed away under the influence of a light breeze which had arisen.  At the time of which we write, (about sixty years ago), Algiers was under the dominion of Turkey, but exercised all the rights of an independent state.  It may be described as a monstrous blot of barbarism hanging on the skirts of civilisation.  It was an anomaly too, for it claimed to be an orthodox power, and was recognised as such by the nations of Europe, while in reality its chief power consisted in consummate impudence, founded on pride and ignorance of the strength of other powers, coupled with the peculiarity of its position and with the fact that the great nations were too much engaged fighting with each other to be at leisure to pay attention to it.  Its rulers or Deys were most of them ignorant men, who had risen, in many cases, from the ranks of the janissaries or common Turkish soldiery, and its sole occupation was piracy--piracy pure and simple.  It did not, like other powers, find a pretext for war in the righting of a supposed or real wrong.  The birds of the Pirates' Nest were much too simple in their grandeur thus to beat about the bush.  They went straight to the point.  Without any pretext at all they declared war with a nation when they had a mind to plunder it, and straightway set about making prizes of the merchantmen of that nation; at the same time keeping carefully clear of its cruisers.  If there had been a tangible grievance, diplomacy might have set it right--but there never was any grievance, either real or imaginary.  If there had been a worthy fleet that would come out and face a foe, courage and power might have settled the question--but there was no such fleet.  The nest possessed only a few small frigates and a considerable number of boats, large and small, which crept along the northern shores of Africa, and pounced upon unwary traders, or made bold dashes at small villages on the southern shores of Europe and in the isles of the Mediterranean.  Trade was horribly hampered by them, though they had no ostensible trade of their own; their influence on southern Europe being comparable only to that of a wasps' nest under one's window, with this difference, that even wasps, as a rule, mind their own business, whereas the Algerine pirates minded the business of everybody else, and called _that_ their own special vocation!  Like other powers, they took prisoners, but instead of exchanging these in times of war and freeing them on return of peace, they made galley-slaves of them all, and held them to ransom.  At all times there were hundreds of Christian slaves held in bondage.  Even in this present century, so late as 1816, the Algerine Turks held in captivity thousands of Christian slaves of all grades and classes, from all parts of Europe, and these were in many cases treated with a degree of cruelty which is perhaps equalled, but not surpassed, by the deeds recorded of negro slavery; and so hopeless were people as to the power or intention of governments to mend this state of things, that societies were formed in some of the chief countries in the world, including England, France, and America, for the express purpose of ransoming Christian slaves from those dreaded shores of Barbary.  Having said this, the reader will doubtless be prepared to hear that the civilised world, howling with indignation, assailed, burned, and exterminated this pirates' nest.  Not at all.  The thing was tolerated; more than that, it was recognised!  Consuls were actually sent to the nest to represent Great Britain, France, Spain, Portugal, Holland, Sweden, Denmark, America; disgraceful treaties were entered into; and annual tribute was paid by each of these, in the form of a costly \"present\" to the Dey, for the purpose of securing immunity to their trading vessels!  Whatever nation kept a consul at this nest and paid \"black-mail\" passed scot free.  The nation that failed in these respects was ruthlessly and systematically plundered--and this at the time when Lord Nelson was scouring the ocean with mighty armaments; when our songs lauded the wooden walls of old England to the skies; and when"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21693"],["title","Post Haste (#1)"],["body","o, sur, I thank ye,\" said Mike, when a similar glass was offered to him.  \"What! ye haven't taken the pledge, have ye?\" said Grady.  \"No, sur; but I've had three glasses already on me walk, an' that's as much as I can rightly carry.\"  \"Nonsense, Mike.  You've a stiff climb before you--here, take it off.\"  The facile postman did take it off without further remonstrance.  \"Have a dhrop, Phil?\"  \"No, thank ee,\" said Phil, firmly, but without giving a reason for declining.  Being a boy, he was not pressed to drink, and the party left the house. A short distance farther on the road forked, and here the post-runner turned off to the right, taking the path which led towards the hill whose rugged shoulder he had yet to scale.  Mike Kenny breasted it not only with the energy of youth and strength, but with the additional and artificial energy infused by the spirits, so that, much to his own surprise, his powers began to fail prematurely. Just then a storm of wind and sleet came down from the heights above, and broke with bitter fury in his face.  He struggled against it vigorously for a time till he gained a point whence he saw the dark blue sea lashing on the cliffs below.  He looked up at the pass which was almost hid by the driving sleet.  A feeling of regret and self-condemnation at having so readily given in to Grady was mingled with a strong sense of the duty that he had to discharge as he once more breasted the steep.  The bitter cold began to tell on his exhausted frame.  In such circumstances a small matter causes a man to stumble. Kenny's foot caught on something--a root it might be--and he fell headlong into a ditch and was stunned.  The cold did its work, and from that ditch he never rose again.  Meanwhile Mr Grady looked out from the window of his cottage upon the gathering storm, expressed some satisfaction that it did not fall to his lot to climb hills on such a day, and comforted himself--though he did not appear to stand in need of special comfort--with another glass of whisky.  George Aspel and Philip Maylands, with their backs to the storm, hurried homewards; the former exulting in the grand--though somewhat disconnected--thoughts infused into his fiery soul by the fire-water he had imbibed, and dreaming of what he would have dared and done had he only been a sea-king of the olden time; the latter meditating somewhat anxiously on the probable nature of his sister's telegram.    CHAPTER TWO.  TELLS OF WOMAN'S WORK AND SOME OF WOMAN'S WAYS.  Many, and varied, and strange, are the duties which woman has to perform in this life--especially in that wonderful and gigantic phase of this life which is comprehended in the word London.  One chill December afternoon there sat in front of a strange-looking instrument a woman--at least she was as nearly a woman as is compatible with the age of seventeen.  She was also pretty--not beautiful, observe, but pretty--sparklingly pretty; dark, dimpled, demure and delightful in every way; with a turn-up nose, a laughing eye, and a kindly look.  Her chief duty, from morning to night, consisted in playing with her pretty little fingers on three white pianoforte keys.  There were no other keys--black or white--in connection with these three.  They stood alone and had no music whatever in them--nothing but a click. Nevertheless this young woman, whose name was May Maylands, played on them with a constancy and a deft rapidity worthy of a great, if not a musical, cause.  From dawn to dusk, and day by day, did she keep those three keys clicking and clittering, as if her life depended on the result; and so in truth it did, to some extent, for her bread and butter depended on her performances on that very meagre piano.  Although an artless and innocent young girl, fresh from the western shores of Erin, May had a peculiar, and, in one of her age and sex, almost pert way of putting questions, to which she often received quaint and curious replies.  For instance one afternoon she addressed to a learned doctor the following query:--  \"Can you send copy last prescription?  Lost it.  Face red as a carrot. In agonies!  What shall I do?  Help!\"  To which the learned doctor gave the matter-of-fact but inelegant reply:--  \"Stick your feet in hot water.  Go to bed at once.  Prescription sent by post.  Take it every hour.\"  But May Maylands did not stick her feet in hot water; neither did she go to bed, or take any physic.  Indeed there was no occasion to do so, for a clear complexion and pink cheeks told of robust health.  On another occasion she asked an Irish farmer if he could send her twenty casks of finest butter to cost not more than 6 pence per pound.  To which the farmer was rude enough to answer--\"Not by no manner of means.\"  In short May's conduct was such that we must hasten to free her from premature condemnation by explaining that she was a female telegraphist in what we may call the literary lungs of London--the General Post-Office at St. Martin's-le-Grand.  On that chill December afternoon, during a brief lull in her portion of the telegraphic communication of the kingdom, May leaned her little head on her hand, and sent her mind to the little cottage by the sea, already described as lying on the west coast of Ireland, with greater speed than ever she flashed those electric sparks which it was her business to scatter broadcast over the land.  The hamlet, near which the cottage stood, nestled under the shelter of a cliff as if in expectation and dread of being riven from its foundations by the howling winds, or whelmed in the surging waves.  The cottage itself was on the outskirts of the hamlet, farther to the south.  The mind of May entered through its closed door,--for mind, like electricity, laughs at bolts and bars.  There was a buzz of subdued sound from more than twelve hundred telegraphists, male and female, in that mighty telegraph-hall of Saint Martin's-le-Grand, but May heard it not.  Dozens upon dozens of tables, each with its busy occupants--tables to right of her, tables to left of her, tables in rear of her, tables in front of her,--swept away from her in bewildering perspective, but May saw them not.  The clicking of six or seven hundred instruments broke upon her ear as they flashed the news of the world over the length and breadth of the land, pulsating joy and sorrow, surprise, fear, hope, despair, and gladness to thousands of anxious hearts, but May regarded it not.  She heard only the booming of the great sea, and saw her mother seated by the fire darning socks, with Madge engaged in household work, and Phil tumbling with baby-brother on the floor, making new holes and rents for fresh darns and patches.  Mrs Maylands was a student and lover of the Bible.  Her children, though a good deal wilder, were sweet-tempered like herself.  It is needless to add that in spite of adverse circumstances they were all moderately happy.  The fair telegraphist smiled, almost laughed, as her mind hovered over the home circle.  From the contemplation of this pleasant and romantic picture she was roused by a familiar rustle at her elbow.  Recalling her mind from the west of Ireland, she fixed it on a mass of telegrams which had just arrived from various parts of the city.  They had been sucked through several pneumatic tubes--varying from a few yards to two miles in length--had been checked, assorted, registered, and distributed by boys to the various telegraphists to whose lot they fell.  May Maylands chanced, by a strange coincidence, to command the instrument in direct connection with Cork.  The telegrams just laid beside her were those destined for that city, and the regions to which it was a centre of redistribution.  Among others her own village was in connection with it, and many a time had she yearned to touch her keys with a message of love to her mother, but the rules of the office sternly forbade this.  The communicative touch which she dispensed so freely to others was forbidden to herself.  If she, or any other telegraphist in St. Martin's-le-Grand, wished to send a private message, it became necessary to step out of the office, go to the appointed place, pay her shilling, and become one of the public for the occasion. Every one can see the necessity for such a rule in the circumstances.  May's three-keyed machine, by the way, did not actually send forth the electricity.  It only punched holes in a long tape of white paper, which holes, according to their relative arrangement, represented the alphabet.  Having punched a message by playing on the keys, she transferred her tape to the electric machine at her elbow and passed it through.  This transmitting machine was automatic or self acting.  It required only to be fed with perforated tapes.  In Ireland the receiving-machine presented its messages in the form of dots and dashes, which, according to arrangement, became alphabetic.  You don't understand this, reader, eh?  It would be surprising if you did!  A treatise on electric telegraphy would be required to make it clear-- supposing you to have a mechanical turn of mind.  Suffice it to say that the Wheatstone telegraph instrument tapes off its messages at the rate of 100 words a minute.  But to return--  With a sigh May Maylands cast her eyes on the uppermost telegram.  It ran thus:--  \"Buy the horse at any price.  He's a spanker.  Let the pigs go for what they'll fetch.\"  This was enough.  Romance, domesticity, and home disappeared, probably with the message along the wire, and the spirit of business descended on the little woman as she applied herself once more to the matter-of-fact manipulation of the keys.  That evening as May left the Post-Office and turned sharply into the dark street she came into collision with a letter-carrier.  \"Oh!  Miss,\" he exclaimed with polite anxiety, \"I beg your pardon.  The sleet drivin' in my face prevented my seeing you.  You're not hurt I hope.\"  \"No, Mr Flint, you haven't hurt me,\" said May, laughing, as she recognised the "]]]
