On my word, Ol,\"--he turned quite away from his sister-in-law's critical gaze and faced his brother with something like indignation in his frank young eyes--\"don't we owe the old home anything but a present tied up in tissue paper once a year?\"  Marian began to speak. She thought Guy was exceeding his rights in talking as if they had been at fault. It was not often that elderly people had so many children within call--loyal children who would do anything within reason. But certainly a man owed something to his own family. And at Christmas! Why not carry out this plan at some other--  Her husband abruptly interrupted her. He took his pipe quite out of his mouth and spoke decidedly.  \"Guy, I believe you're right. I'll be sorry to desert my own kids, of course, but I rather think they can stand it for once. If the others fall into line, you may count on me.\"  Guy got away, feeling that the worst of his troubles was over. In his younger sister, Nan, he hoped to find an ardent ally and he was not disappointed. Carolyn--Mrs. Charles Wetmore--also fell in heartily with the plan. Ralph, from somewhere in the far West, wrote that he would get home or break a leg. Edson thought the idea rather a foolish one, but was persuaded by Jessica, his wife--whom Guy privately declared a trump--that he must go by all means. And so they all fell into line, and there remained for Guy only the working out of the details.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Mis' Fernald\"--Marietta Cooley strove with all the decision of which she was capable to keep her high-pitched, middle-aged voice in order--\"'fore you get to bed I'm most forgettin' what I was to ask you. I s'pose you'll laugh, but Guy--he wrote me partic'lar he wanted you and his father to\"--Marietta's rather stern, thin face took on a curious expression--\"to hang up your stockin's.\"  Mrs. Fernald paused in the door-way of the bedroom opening from the sitting-room downstairs. She looked back at Marietta with her gentle smile.  \"Guy wrote that?\" she asked. \"Then--it almost looks as if he might be coming himself, doesn't it, Marietta?\"  \"Well, I don't know's I'd really expect him,\" Marietta replied, turning her face away and busying herself about the hearth. \"I guess what he meant was more in the way of a surprise for a Christmas present--something that'll go into a stockin', maybe.\"  \"It's rather odd he should have written you to ask me,\" mused Mrs. Fernald, as she looked out the stockings.  Marietta considered rapidly. \"Well, I s'pose he intended for me to get 'em on the sly without mentionin' it to you, an' put in what he sent, but I sort of guessed you might like to fall in with his idee by hangin' 'em up yourself, here by the chimbley, where the children all used to do it. Here's the nails, same as they always was.\"  Mrs. Fernald found the stockings, and touched her husband on the shoulder, as he sat unlacing his shoes. \"Father, Guy wrote he wanted us to hang up our stockings,\" she said, raising her voice a little and speaking very distinctly. The elderly man beside her looked up, smiling.  \"Well, well,\" he said, \"anything to please the boy. It doesn't seem more than a year since he was a little fellow hanging up his own stocking, does it, mother?\"  The stockings were hung in silence. They looked thin and lonely as they dangled beside the dying fire. Marietta hastened to make them less lonely. \"Well,\" she said, in a shame-faced way, \"the silly boy said I was to hang mine, too. Goodness knows what he'll find to put into it that'll fit, 'less it's a poker.\"  They smiled kindly at her, wished her good night, and went back into their own room. The little episode had aroused no suspicions. It was very like Guy's affectionate boyishness.  \"I presume he'll be down,\" said Mrs. Fernald, as she limped quietly about the room, making ready for bed. \"Don't you remember how he surprised us last year? I'm sorry the others can't come. Of course, I sent them all the invitation, just as usual--I shall always do that--but it _is_ pretty snowy weather, and I suppose they don't quite like to risk it.\"  Presently, as she was putting out the light, she heard Marietta at the door.  \"Mis' Fernald, Peter Piper's got back in this part o' the house, somehow, and I can't lay hands on him. Beats all how cute that cat is. Seem's if he knows when I'm goin' to put him out in the wood-shed. I don't think likely he'll do no harm, but I thought I'd tell you, so 'f you heard any queer noises in the night you'd know it was Peter.\"  \"Very well, Marietta\"--the soft voice came back to the schemer on the other side of the door. \"Peter will be all right, wherever he is. I shan't be alarmed if I hear him.\"  \"All right, Mis' Fernald; I just thought I'd let you know,\" and the guileful one went grinning away.         *       *       *       *       *  _There was a long silence in the quiet sleeping-room. Then, out of the darkness, came this little colloquy:_  _\"Emeline, you aren't getting to sleep.\"_  _\"I--know I'm not, John. I--Christmas Eve keeps one awake, somehow. It always did.\"_  _\"Yes.... I don't suppose the children realise at all, do they?\"_  _\"Oh, no--oh, no! They don't realise--they never will, till--they're here themselves. It's all right. I think--I think at least Guy will be down to-morrow, don't you?\"_  _\"I guess maybe he will.\" Then, after a short silence. \"Mother--you've got me, you know. You know--you've always got me, dear.\"_  _\"Yes.\" She would not let him hear the sob in her voice. She crept close, and spoke cheerfully in his best ear. \"And you've got me, Johnny Boy!\"_  _\"Thank the Lord, I have!\"_  _So, counting their blessings, they fell asleep at last. But, even in sleep, one set of lashes was strangely wet._         *       *       *       *       *  \"Christopher Jinks, what a drift!\"  \"Lucky we weren't two hours later.\"  \"_Sh-h_--they might hear us.\"  \"Nan, stop laughing, or I'll drop a snowball down your neck!\"  \"Here, Carol, give me your hand. I'll plough you through. Large bodies move slowly, of course, but go elbows first and you'll get there.\"  \"Gee _whiz_! Can't you get that door open? I'll bet it's frozen fast.\"  A light showed inside the kitchen. The storm-door swung open, propelled by force from inside. A cautious voice said low: \"That the Fernald family?\"  A chorus of whispers came back at Miss Marietta Cooley:  \"Yes, yes--let us in, we're freezing.\"  \"You bet we're the Fernald family--every man-Jack of us--not one missing.\"  \"Oh, Marietta--you dear old thing!\"  \"Hurry up--this is their side of the house.\"  \"_Sh-h-h_--\"  \"Carol, your _sh-h-ishes_ would wake the dead!\"  [Illustration: \"STUMBLING OVER THEIR OWN FEET AND BUNDLES ... THE CREW POURED INTO THE WARM KITCHEN\"]  Stumbling over their own feet and bundles in the endeavour to be preternaturally quiet, the crew poured into the warm kitchen. Bearded Oliver, oldest of the clan; stout Edson, big Ralph, tall and slender Guy--and the two daughters of the house, Carolyn, growing plump and rosy at thirty; Nan, slim and girlish at twenty-four--they were all there. Marietta heaved a sigh of content as she looked them over.  \"Well, I didn't really think you'd get here--all of you. Thank the Lord, you have. I s'pose you're tearin' hungry, bein' past 'leven. If you think you can eat quiet as cats, I'll feed you up, but if you're goin' to make as much rumpus as you did comin' round the corner o' the wood-shed I'll have to pack you straight off to bed up the back stairs.\"  They pleaded for mercy and hot food. They got it--everything that could be had that would diffuse no odour of cookery through the house. Smoking clam-broth, a great pot of baked beans, cold meats, and jellies--they had no reason to complain of their reception. They ate hungrily with the appetites of winter travel.  \"Say, but this is great,\" exulted Ralph, the stalwart, consuming a huge wedge of mince pie with a fine disregard for any consequences that might overtake him. \"This alone is worth it. I haven't eaten such pie in a century. What a jolly place this old kitchen is! Let's have a candy-pull to-morrow. I haven't been home Christmas in--let me see--by Jove, I believe it's six--seven--yes, seven years. Look here: there's been some excuse for me, but what about you people that live near?\"  He looked accusingly about. Carolyn got up and came around to him. \"Don't talk about it to-night,\" she whispered. \"We haven't any of us realised how long it's been.\"  \"We'll get off to bed now,\" Guy declared, rising. \"I can't get over the feeling that they may catch us down here. If either of them should want some hot water or anything--\"  \"The dining-room door's bolted,\" Marietta assured him, \"but it might need explainin' if I had to bring 'em hot water by way of the parlour. Now, go awful careful up them stairs. They're pretty near over your ma's head, but I don't dare have you tramp through the settin'-room to the front ones. Now, remember that seventh stair creaks like Ned--you've got to step right on the outside edge of it to keep it quiet. I don't know but what you boys better step right up over that seventh stair without touchin' foot to it.\"  \"All right--we'll step!\"  \"Who's going to fix the bundles?\" Carolyn paused to ask as she started up the stairs.  \"Marietta,\" Guy answered. \"I've labeled every one, so it'll be easy. If they hear paper rattle, they'll think it's the usual presents we've sent on, and if they come out they'll see Marietta, so it's all right. Quiet, now. Remember the seventh stair!\"  They crept up, one by one, each to his or her old room. There needed to be no \"doubling up,\" for the house was large, and each room had been left precisely as its owner had left it. It was rather ghostly, this stealing silently about with candles, and in the necessity for the suppression of speech the animation of the party rather suffered eclipse. It was late, and they were beginning to be sleepy, so they were soon in bed. But, somehow, once"]]]
