Her whole being rebelled against the crime, and she vowed to herself a solemn vow to join the ranks of the revolutionary proletariat and to devote all her energy and strength to their emancipation from wage slavery.  With the glowing enthusiasm so characteristic of her nature, she now began to familiarize herself with the literature of Socialism and Anarchism.  She attended public meetings and became acquainted with socialistically and anarchistically inclined workingmen.  Johanna Greie, the well-known German lecturer, was the first Socialist speaker heard by Emma Goldman.  In New Haven, Conn., where she was employed in a corset factory, she met Anarchists actively participating in the movement. Here she read the FREIHEIT, edited by John Most.  The Haymarket tragedy developed her inherent Anarchist tendencies: the reading of the FREIHEIT made her a conscious Anarchist.  Subsequently she was to learn that the idea of Anarchism found its highest expression through the best intellects of America: theoretically by Josiah Warren, Stephen Pearl Andrews, Lysander Spooner; philosophically by Emerson, Thoreau, and Walt Whitman.  Made ill by the excessive strain of factory work, Emma Goldman returned to Rochester where she remained till August, 1889, at which time she removed to New York, the scene of the most important phase of her life.  She was now twenty years old.  Features pallid with suffering, eyes large and full of compassion, greet one in her pictured likeness of those days.  Her hair is, as customary with Russian student girls, worn short, giving free play to the strong forehead.   It is the heroic epoch of militant Anarchism.  By leaps and bounds the movement had grown in every country.  In spite of the most severe governmental persecution new converts swell the ranks.  The propaganda is almost exclusively of a secret character.  The repressive measures of the government drive the disciples of the new philosophy to conspirative methods.  Thousands of victims fall into the hands of the authorities and languish in prisons.  But nothing can stem the rising tide of enthusiasm, of self-sacrifice and devotion to the Cause.  The efforts of teachers like Peter Kropotkin, Louise Michel, Elisee Reclus, and others, inspire the devotees with ever greater energy.  Disruption is imminent with the Socialists, who have sacrificed the idea of liberty and embraced the State and politics.  The struggle is bitter, the factions irreconcilable.  This struggle is not merely between Anarchists and Socialists; it also finds its echo within the Anarchist groups.  Theoretic differences and personal controversies lead to strife and acrimonious enmities.  The anti-Socialist legislation of Germany and Austria had driven thousands of Socialists and Anarchists across the seas to seek refuge in America.  John Most, having lost his seat in the Reichstag, finally had to flee his native land, and went to London.  There, having advanced toward Anarchism, he entirely withdrew from the Social Democratic Party.  Later, coming to America, he continued the publication of the FREIHEIT in New York, and developed great activity among the German workingmen.  When Emma Goldman arrived in New York in 1889, she experienced little difficulty in associating herself with active Anarchists.  Anarchist meetings were an almost daily occurrence.  The first lecturer she heard on the Anarchist platform was Dr. A. Solotaroff.  Of great importance to her future development was her acquaintance with John Most, who exerted a tremendous influence over the younger elements. His impassioned eloquence, untiring energy, and the persecution he had endured for the Cause, all combined to enthuse the comrades.  It was also at this period that she met Alexander Berkman, whose friendship played an important part throughout her life.  Her talents as a speaker could not long remain in obscurity.  The fire of enthusiasm swept her toward the public platform.  Encouraged by her friends, she began to participate as a German and Yiddish speaker at Anarchist meetings.  Soon followed a brief tour of agitation taking her as far as Cleveland.  With the whole strength and earnestness of her soul she now threw herself into the propaganda of Anarchist ideas.  The passionate period of her life had begun.  Through constantly toiling in sweat shops, the fiery young orator was at the same time very active as an agitator and participated in various labor struggles, notably in the great cloakmakers' strike, in 1889, led by Professor Garsyde and Joseph Barondess.  A year later Emma Goldman was a delegate to an Anarchist conference in New York.  She was elected to the Executive Committee, but later withdrew because of differences of opinion regarding tactical matters.  The ideas of the German-speaking Anarchists had at that time not yet become clarified.  Some still believed in parliamentary methods, the great majority being adherents of strong centralism. These differences of opinion in regard to tactics led in 1891 to a breach with John Most.  Emma Goldman, Alexander Berkman, and other comrades joined the group AUTONOMY, in which Joseph Peukert, Otto Rinke, and Claus Timmermann played an active part.  The bitter controversies which followed this secession terminated only with the death of Most, in 1906.  A great source of inspiration to Emma Goldman proved the Russian revolutionists who were associated in the group ZNAMYA.  Goldenberg, Solotaroff, Zametkin, Miller, Cahan, the poet Edelstadt, Ivan von Schewitsch, husband of Helene von Racowitza and editor of the VOLKSZEITUNG, and numerous other Russian exiles, some of whom are still living, were members of this group.  It was also at this time that Emma Goldman met Robert Reitzel, the German-American Heine, who exerted a great influence on her development.  Through him she became acquainted with the best writers of modern literature, and the friendship thus begun lasted till Reitzel's death, in 1898.   The labor movement of America had not been drowned in the Chicago massacre; the murder of the Anarchists had failed to bring peace to the profit-greedy capitalist.  The struggle for the eight-hour day continued.  In 1892 broke out the great strike in Pittsburg.  The Homestead fight, the defeat of the Pinkertons, the appearance of the militia, the suppression of the strikers, and the complete triumph of the reaction are matters of comparatively recent history.  Stirred to the very depths by the terrible events at the seat of war, Alexander Berkman resolved to sacrifice his life to the Cause and thus give an object lesson to the wage slaves of America of active Anarchist solidarity with labor.  His attack upon Frick, the Gessler of Pittsburg, failed, and the twenty-two-year-old youth was doomed to a living death of twenty-two years in the penitentiary.  The bourgeoisie, which for decades had exalted and eulogized tyrannicide, now was filled with terrible rage.  The capitalist press organized a systematic campaign of calumny and misrepresentation against Anarchists.  The police exerted every effort to involve Emma Goldman in the act of Alexander Berkman.  The feared agitator was to be silenced by all means.  It was only due to the circumstance of her presence in New York that she escaped the clutches of the law.  It was a similar circumstance which, nine years later, during the McKinley incident, was instrumental in preserving her liberty.  It is almost incredible with what amount of stupidity, baseness, and vileness the journalists of the period sought to overwhelm the Anarchist.  One must peruse the newspaper files to realize the enormity of incrimination and slander.  It would be difficult to portray the agony of soul Emma Goldman experienced in those days. The persecutions of the capitalist press were to be borne by an Anarchist with comparative equanimity; but the attacks from one's own ranks were far more painful and unbearable.  The act of Berkman was severely criticized by Most and some of his followers among the German and Jewish Anarchists.  Bitter accusations and recriminations at public meetings and private gatherings followed.  Persecuted on all sides, both because she championed Berkman and his act, and on account of her revolutionary activity, Emma Goldman was harassed even to the extent of inability to secure shelter.  Too proud to seek safety in the denial of her identity, she chose to pass the nights in the public parks rather than expose her friends to danger or vexation by her visits.  The already bitter cup was filled to overflowing by the attempted suicide of a young comrade who had shared living quarters with Emma Goldman, Alexander Berkman, and a mutual artist friend.   Many changes have since taken place.  Alexander Berkman has survived the Pennsylvania Inferno, and is back again in the ranks of the militant Anarchists, his spirit unbroken, his soul full of enthusiasm for the ideals of his youth.  The artist comrade is now among the well-known illustrators of New York.  The suicide candidate left America shortly after his unfortunate attempt to die, and was subsequently arrested and condemned to eight years of hard labor for smuggling Anarchist literature into Germany.  He, too, has withstood the terrors of prison life, and has returned to the revolutionary movement, since earning the well deserved reputation of a talented writer in Germany.   To avoid indefinite camping in the parks Emma Goldman finally was forced to move into a house on Third Street, occupied exclusively by prostitutes.  There, among the outcasts of our good Christian society, she could at least rent a bit of a room, and find rest and work at her sewing machine.  The women of the street showed more refinement of feeling and sincere sympathy than the priests of the Church.  But human endurance had been exhausted by overmuch suffering and privation.  There was a complete physical breakdown, and the renowned agitator was removed to the \"Bohemian Republic\"--a "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21626"],["title","Adrift in the Wilds; Or, The Adventures of Two Shipwrecked Boys (#1)"],["body","the call until he was addressed the second time in a louder tone than before, when he suddenly raised his head.  \"Whisht! what is it?\"  \"What are you thinking about?\"  \"Nothin', I was dreaming.\"  \"Dreaming! what about?\"  \"Begorrah but that was a qua'r dream, was that same one.\"  \"Let's hear it.\"  \"But it's onplaiasnt.\"  \"Never mind, out with it.\"  \"Well, thin, if I must tell yees, I was thinking that this owld staamer was all on fire, and all of us passengers was jumping around in the wather, pulling each other down, away miles into the sea, till we was gone so long there wasn't a chance iver to git up agin.\"  A strange fear thrilled both of the boys at the mention of this, and they looked at each other a moment in silence.  \"What put that into your head, Tim?\"  \"And it's just the question I was axing meself, for I never draamed of such a thing in my life before, and it's mighty qua'r that I should take a notion to do it now.\"  \"It ain't worth talking about,\" said Elwood, showing an anxiety to change the subject.  \"Be yees going to bed to-night?\"  \"I don't feel a bit sleepy,\" replied Elwood. \"I'd just as soon sit up half the night as not.\"  \"And so would I; it must be after eleven o'clock, isn't it?\"  \"It's near 'levin,\" replied Tim. \"I'm not able to examine me watch; and if I was, I couldn't tell very well, as it hasn't run for a few months.\"  Howard took out his watch, but the moonlight was too faint for him to distinguish the hands, and the three were content to let the precise time remain a matter of conjecture.  \"Tim, how close are we to land?\" asked Elwood.  \"I should say about the same distance that the land is from us, and begorrah that's the best information I can give yees.\"  \"I could see the mountains very plainly when the sun was setting,\" said Howard, \"and it cannot be many miles away.\"  \"What sort of a country is it off here?\" pursued Elwood, pointing in the direction of the land.  \"It is wild and rocky, and there are plenty of Indians and wild animals there.\"  \"How do you know?\" asked Elwood, in some amazement.  \"I have taken the trouble to learn all about California that I could before coming.\"  \"I believe they have _gold_ there?\" said Elwood, in rather a bantering vein.  \"Tim can tell you more about that than I can, as he came to California to hunt gold.\"  \"How is that, Tim?\"  \"Begorrah, but he shpakes the truth. I wint up among the mountains to hunt gowld.\"  \"And what luck had you?\"  \"Luck, is it?\" repeated the Irishman, with an expression of ludicrous disgust. \"Luck, does ye call it, to have your head cracked and your shins smashed by the copper-skins, chawed up by the b'ars, froze to death in the mountains, drowned in the rivers--that run into the top of yer shanty when yer sound asleep--your feet gnawed off by wolverines, as they call--and--but whisht! don't talk to me of luck, and all the time ye never gets a sight of a particle of gowld.\"  The boys laughed, Howard said:  \"But your luck is not every one's, Tim; there have been plenty who have made fortunes at the business.\"  \"Yis, but they wasn't Tim O'Rooneys. He's not the man that was born to be rich!\"  \"You're better satisfied where you are.\"  \"Yis, thank God, that I've such a good home, and an ongrateful dog would I baa if I should ask more.\"  \"But, Elwood, it's getting late, and this night air begins to feel chilly. It can't be far from midnight.\"  \"I am willing; where's Terror? Ah! here he is; old fellow, come along and keep faithful watch over your friends.\"  \"Boys,\" said Tim O'Rooney, with a strange, husky intonation, \"you remember my dream about this steamer burning?\"  \"Yes; what of it?\"  \"It is coming thrue!\"  _He spoke the truth!_     CHAPTER III.  AFLOAT.   As Tim O'Rooney spoke, he pointed to the bow of the steamer, where, in the bright moonlight, some smoke could be seen rising--where, too, the next instant, they caught sight of a gleam of fire.  \"Oh, heaven! what shall we do?\" exclaimed Elwood, struck with a panic.  \"Wait and trust to Providence.\"  \"Let us jump overboard; I'd rather be drowned than burned to death. Come, Howard, let's jump over this minute!\"  He made a move toward the stern of the steamer, near which they had been seated, as if he intended to spring overboard, when his arm was sternly caught by the Irishman, who said in an indignant tone:  \"Kaap cool! kaap cool! don't make a fool of yoursilf. Can ye swim?\"  \"Yes,\" answered Howard, \"we can both swim very well. Can you?\"  \"Indaad, I can--swim like a stone.\"  \"But good heavens!\" exclaimed Elwood, who had not entirely recovered from his excitement, \"the land is miles off, and we can't swim there, not taking into account the heavy sea.\"  \"What does that mean?\"  As Howard spoke, the bow of the steamer made a sweeping bend to the right.  \"They've headed toward shore,\" said Elwood.  This snatch of conversation had occupied the shortest possible space of time. The fire had been discovered by the officials on board fully as soon as by our friends, and the men could be seen running hurriedly to and fro, all quiet and still, for they knew too well what the result would be if the alarm was communicated to the sleeping passengers. The pilot had headed the vast craft toward land, and by the furious throbbing of the engines it could be seen that the doomed vessel was straining to the utmost, like some affrighted, faithful horse striving to carry his master as nearly as possible to the port of safely ere he dropped down and died.  It was fully midnight, and, as a matter of course, very nearly all the passengers were in their berths. There were a few, however, who were lingering on the promenade deck, some smoking--here and there a couple of lovers all unconscious of everything else--one or two avaricious speculators; and but a few minutes could elapse before the startling danger should become known.  The last words, which we have given as spoken by our friends, had scarcely been said, when a man, who apparently had been stretched out sound asleep, suddenly sprung up, wild with terror. \"The boat is on fire! _fire! fire_!\"  He darted hither and thither like some wild animal compassed on every hand by death, and then suddenly made a leap overboard, and was swallowed up in the sea.  The alarm spread with fearful rapidity, and was soon ringing through every part of the steamer, and now began that fearful confusion and panic which no pen can clearly picture, and which, once seen, can never be forgotten to the dying day.  Our three friends were gathered at the stern of the steamer, earnestly and anxiously discussing the best course to pursue.  \"Let's stay here,\" said Howard, \"for every second is taking us nearer land.\"  \"That is what nearly all will do,\" said Elwood, \"but we can never reach the shore, and when the time comes we shall all be in the sea together, struggling and sinking, and we shall then be sure to go down.\"  \"Yez are right,\" said Tim, addressing the last speaker. \"Our only chance is to jump overboard this very minute, before the sea is full of the poor fellows. They'll begin to go over the ship's side and will kaap it up until the thing is burned up.\"  \"It's time then that we hunted our life-preservers,\" said Howard.  \"Git out wid yer life-presarvers!\" impatiently exclaimed Tim. \"Didn't me uncle wear one of 'em for six months, and then die with the faver! I'll heave over one of these settaas, and that'll kaap up afloat.\"  \"Be quick about it, Tim,\" urged Elwood, who was beginning to get nervous. \"See, the fire is spreading, and everybody seems to have found out what the matter is.\"  There was indeed no time to be lost. The steamer was doomed beyond all possibility of salvation, and must soon become unmanageable, when everything would be turned into a pandemonium. One of the large settees was wrenched loose and lifted over the stern of the steamer.  \"Now,\" said Tim, \"the minute it goes over yez must follow. The owld staamer is going like a straak of lightning, and if aither of yez wait, he'll be lift behind.\"  \"All right, no danger, go ahead!\"  They now clambered up, and sat poised on the stern. In this fearful position Tim O'Rooney held the settee balanced for a few minutes.  \"Be yez riddy?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Do yez jump a little to the right, Elwood, and yez a little to the left, Howard, so as not to hit the owld thing. All riddy; here we go!\"  The next moment the three were spinning down through the air, and struck the water. They went below the surface, the boys sinking quite a distance; but almost instantly they arose and struck bravely out.  \"Tim, where are you?\" called out Elwood, not seeing his friend.  \"Here, to the left,\" responded the Irishman, as he rose on a huge swell. \"Can ye swim to me?\"  \"I hope so, but my clothes bother me like creation.\"  Strange! that not one of the three had once thought of removing their superfluous clothing before jumping into the ocean. But Elwood was a fine swimmer, and he struggled bravely, although at a great disadvantage, until his outstretched hand was seized by the Irishman, and he then caught hold of the settee and rested himself.  \"Where is Howard?\" he asked, panting from his exertions.  \"Here he is,\" responded Howard himself. \"I struck the water so close that when I came up my hand hit the settee.\"  \"I tell you what it is,\" said Elwood. \"We ought to have brought something else with us beside this. We have got to keep all of our bodies underwater for this to bear us.\"  \"And what of it?\"  \"Suppose some poor fellow claims a part. Gracious! here comes a man this minute!\"  \"We can't turn him off,\" said Tim, \"but this owld horse has all the grist he can carry.\"  A dark body could be seen struggling and rapidly approaching them.  \"Whoever he is, he is a good swimmer,\" remarked Howard, watching the stranger.  \"Of course he is, for it comes natural; don't you see it isn't a man, but old Terror.\"  \"Thank heaven for that! we never thought about him. I am glad he is with us.\"  The next moment the Newfoundland placed his paw on the"]]]
