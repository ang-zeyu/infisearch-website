Setting sail down the gulf they ran before a fair breeze which speedily increased to a favouring gale.  Before night a small bay was descried, with three log-huts on the shore.  This was the new fort.  They ran into the bay, grazing a smooth rock in their passage, which caused the _Fairy_ to tremble from stem to stern, and cast anchor close to a wooden jetty.  On the end of this a solitary individual, (apparently a maniac), was seen capering and yelling wildly.  \"What fort is this?\" shouted Jack.  \"Sorrow wan o' me knows,\" cried the maniac; \"it's niver been christened yet.  Faix, if it's a fort at all, I'd call it Fort Disolation.  Och! but it's lonesome I've been these three days--niver a wan here but meself an' the ghosts.  Come ashore, darlints, and comfort me!\"  \"Fort Desolation, indeed!\" muttered Jack Robinson, as he looked round him sadly; \"not a bad name.  I'll adopt it.  Lower the boat, lads.\"  Thus Jack took possession of his new home.    CHAPTER THREE.  DOMESTIC AND PERSONAL MATTERS.  Jack Robinson's first proceeding on entering the new fort and assuming the command, was to summon the man, (supposed to be a maniac), named Teddy O'Donel, to his presence in the \"Hall.\"  \"Your name is Teddy O'Donel?\" said Jack.  \"The same, sir, at your sarvice,\" said Teddy, with a respectful pull at his forelock.  \"They was used to call me _Mister_ O'Donel when I was in the army, but I've guv that up long ago an' dropped the title wid the commission.\"  \"Indeed: then you were a commissioned officer?\" inquired Jack, with a smile.  \"Be no manes.  It was a slight longer title than that I had.  They called me a non-commissioned officer.  I niver could find in me heart to consociate wid them consaited commissioners--though there was wan or two of 'em as was desarvin' o' the three stripes.  But I niver took kindly to sodgerin'.  It was in the Howth militia I was.  Good enough boys they was in their way, but I couldn't pull wid them no how.  They made me a corp'ral for good conduct, but, faix, the great review finished me; for I got into that state of warlike feeling that I loaded me muskit five times widout firin', an' there was such a row round about that I didn't know the dirty thing had niver wint off till the fifth time, when she bursted into smithereens an' wint off intirely.  No wan iver seed a scrag of her after that.  An' the worst was, she carried away the small finger of Bob Riley's left hand.  Bob threw down his muskit an' ran off the ground howlin', so I picked the wipon up an' blazed away at the inimy; but, bad luck to him, Bob had left his ramrod in, and I sint it right through the flank of an owld donkey as was pullin' an apple and orange cart.  Oh! how that baste did kick up its heels, to be sure! and the apples and oranges they was flyin' like--Well, well--the long and the short was, that I wint an' towld the colonel I couldn't stop no longer in such a regiment.  So I guv it up an' comed out here.\"  \"And became a fur-trader,\" said Jack Robinson, with a smile.  \"Just so, sur, an' fort-builder to boot; for, being a jiner to trade and handy wid the tools, Mr Murray sent me down here to build the place and take command, but I s'pose I'm suppersheeded now!\"  \"Well, I believe you are, Teddy; but I hope that you will yet do good service as my lieutenant.\"  The beaming smile on Teddy's face showed that he was well pleased to be relieved from the responsibilities of office.  \"Sure,\" said he, \"the throuble I have had wid the min an' the salvages for the last six weeks--it's past belavin'!  An' thin, whin I sint the men down to the river to fush--more nor twinty miles off--an' whin the salvages wint away and left me alone wid only wan old salvage woman!-- och!  I'd not wish my worst inimy in me sitivation.\"  \"Then the savages have been giving you trouble, have they?\"  \"They have, sur, but not so much as the min.\"  \"Well, Teddy,\" said Jack, \"go and fetch me something to eat, and then you shall sit down and give me an account of things in general.  But first give my men food.\"  \"Sure they've got it,\" replied Teddy, with a broad grin.  \"That spalpeen they calls Rollo axed for meat the first thing, in a voice that made me think he'd ait me up alive av he didn't git it.  So I guv 'em the run o' the pantry.  What'll yer plaze to dhrink, sur?\"  \"What have you got?\"  \"Tay and coffee, sur, not to mintion wather.  There's only flour an' salt pork to ait, for this is a bad place for game.  I've not seed a bird or a bear for three weeks, an' the seals is too cute for me.  But I'll bring ye the best that we've got.\"  Teddy O'Donel hastened to the kitchen, a small log-hut in rear of the dwelling-house, and left Jack Robinson alone in the \"Hall.\"  Jack rose, thrust his hands deep into his pockets, and walked to the window.  It was glazed with parchment, with the exception of the centre square, which was of glass.  \"Pleasant, uncommonly pleasant,\" he muttered, as he surveyed the landscape.  In front lay a flat beach of sand with the gulf beyond, the horizon being veiled in mist.  Up the river there was a flat beach with a hill beyond.  It was a black iron-looking hill, devoid of all visible verdure, and it plunged abruptly down into the sea as if it were trying fiercely to drown itself.  Down the river there was a continuation of flat beach, with, apparently, nothing whatever beyond.  The only objects that enlivened the dreary expanse were, the sloop at the end of the wooden jetty and a small flagstaff in front of the house, from which a flag was flying in honour of the arrival of the new governor.  At the foot of this flagstaff there stood an old iron cannon, which looked pugnacious and cross, as if it longed to burst itself and blow down all visible creation.  Jack Robinson's countenance became a simple blank as he took the first survey of his new dominions.  Suddenly a gleam of hope flitted across the blank.  \"Perhaps the back is better,\" he muttered, opening the door that led to the rear of the premises.  In order to get out he had to pass through the kitchen, where he found his men busy with fried pork and flour cakes, and his lieutenant, Teddy, preparing coffee.  \"What is that?\" inquired Jack, pointing to a small heap of brown substance which Teddy was roasting in a frying-pan.  \"Sure it's coffee,\" said the man.  \"Eh?\" inquired Jack.  \"Coffee, sur,\" repeated Teddy with emphasis.  \"What is it made of?\" inquired Jack.  \"Bread-crumbs, sur.  I'm used to make it of pais, but it takes longer, d'ye see, for I've got to pound 'em in a cloth after they're roasted. The crumbs is a'most as good as the pais, an' quicker made whin yer in a hurry.\"  Jack's first impulse was to countermand the crumbs and order tea, but he refrained, and went out to survey the back regions of his new home.  He found that the point selected for the establishment of the fort was a plain of sand, on which little herbage of any kind grew.  In rear of the house there was a belt of stunted bushes, which, as he went onward into the interior, became a wood of stunted firs.  This seemed to grow a little more dense farther inland, and finally terminated at the base of the distant and rugged mountains of the interior.  In fact, he found that he was established on a sandbank which had either been thrown up by the sea, or at no very remote period had formed part of its bed. Returning home so as to enter by the front door, he observed an enclosed space a few hundred yards distant from the fort.  Curious to know what it was, he walked up to it, and, looking over the stockade, beheld numerous little mounds of sand with wooden crosses at the head of them. It was the burial-ground of the establishment.  Trade had been carried on here by a few adventurous white men before the fort was built.  Some of their number having died, a space had been enclosed as a burying-ground.  The Roman Catholic Indians afterwards used it, and it was eventually consecrated with much ceremony by a priest.  With a face from which every vestige of intelligence was removed, Jack Robinson returned to the fort and sat down in solitary state in the hall.  In the act of sitting down he discovered that the only arm-chair in the room was unsteady on its legs, these being of unequal length. There were two other chairs without arms, and equally unsteady on their legs.  These, as well as everything in the room, were made of fir-wood-- as yet unpainted.  In the empty fire-place Jack observed a piece of charcoal, which he took up and began, in an absent way, to sketch on the white wall.  He portrayed a raving maniac as large as life, and then, sitting down, began insensibly to hum--    \"I dreamt that I dwelt in marble halls.\"  In the midst of which he was interrupted by the entrance of his lieutenant with a tray of viands.  \"Ah, yer a purty creatur,\" exclaimed Teddy, pausing with a look of admiration before the maniac.  \"Come, Teddy, sit down and let's have the news.  What have we here?\" said Jack, looking at three covered plates which were placed before him.  \"Salt pork fried,\" said Teddy removing the cover.  \"And here?\"  \"Salt pork biled,\" said the man, removing the second cover; \"an' salt pork cold,\" he added, removing the third.  \"You see, sur, I wasn't sure which way ye'd like it, an' ye was out whin I come to ax; so I just did it up in three fashions.  Here's loaf bread, an' it's not bad, though I say it that made it.\"  As Jack cut down into the loaf, he naturally remembered those lines of a well-known writer:    \"Who has not tasted home-made bread,   A heavy compound of putty and   lead!\"  \"Are these cakes?\" he said, as Teddy presented another plate with something hot in it.  \"Ay, pancakes they is, made of flour an' wather fried in grease, an' the best of aitin', as ye'll find;--but, musha! they've all stuck together from some raison I han't yet diskivered: but they'll be none the worse for that, and there's plenty of good thick"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21733"],["title","The Giant of the North: Pokings Round the Pole (#1)"],["body","rendered equality impossible.  It was this: our young giant was unselfish and modest.  Eemerk was selfish and vain-glorious.  When the latter killed a seal he always kept the tit-bits for himself.  Chingatok gave them to his mother, or to any one else who had a mind to have them.  And so in regard to everything.  Chingatok was not a native of the region in which we introduce him to the reader.  He and the tribe, or rather part of the tribe, to which he belonged, had travelled from the far north; so far north that nobody knew the name of the land from which they had come.  Even Chingatok himself did not know it.  Being unacquainted with geography, he knew no more about his position on the face of this globe than a field-mouse or a sparrow.  But the young giant had heard a strange rumour, while in his far-off country, which had caused his strong intellect to ponder, and his huge heart to beat high.  Tribes who dwelt far to the south of his northern home had told him that other tribes, still further south, had declared that the people who dwelt to the south of them had met with a race of men who came to them over the sea on floating islands; that these islands had something like trees growing out of them, and wings which moved about, which folded and expanded somewhat like the wings of the sea-gull; that these men's faces were whiter than Eskimo faces; that they wore skins of a much more curious kind than sealskins, and that they were amazingly clever with their hands, talked a language that no one could understand, and did many wonderful things that nobody could comprehend.  A longing, wistful expression used to steal over Chingatok's face as he gazed at the southern horizon while listening to these strange rumours, and a very slight smile of incredulity had glimmered on his visage, when it was told him that one of the floating islands of these Kablunets, or white men, had been seen with a burning mountain in the middle of it, which vomited forth smoke and fire, and sometimes uttered a furious hissing or shrieking sound, not unlike his own voice when he was a Skreekinbroot.  The giant said little about these and other subjects, but thought deeply.  His mind, as we have said, was far ahead of his time and condition.  Let us listen to some of the disjointed thoughts that perplexed this man.  \"Who made me?\" he asked in a low tone, when floating alone one day in his kayak, or skin canoe, \"whence came I? whither go I?  What is this great sea on which I float? that land on which I tread?  No sledge, no spear, no kayak, no snow-hut makes itself!  Who made all that which I behold?\"  Chingatok looked around him, but no audible answer came from Nature.  He looked up, but the glorious sun only dazzled his eyes.  \"There _must_ be One,\" he continued in a lower tone, \"who made all things; but who made _Him_?  No one?  It is impossible!  The Maker must have ever been.  _Ever been_!\"  He repeated this once or twice with a look of perplexed gravity.  The northern savage had grasped the grand mystery, and, like all true philosophers savage or civilised who have gone before him, relapsed into silence.  At last he resolved to travel south, until he should arrive at the coasts where these strange sights before described were said to have been seen.  Having made up his mind, Chingatok began his arrangements without delay; persuaded a few families of his tribe to accompany him, and reached the north-western shores of Greenland after a long and trying journey by water and ice.  Here he spent the winter.  When spring came, he continued his journey south, and at last began to look out, with sanguine expectation, for the floating islands with wings, and the larger island with the burning mountain on it, about which he had heard.  Of course, on his way south, our giant fell in with some members of the tribes through whom the rumours that puzzled him had been transmitted to the far north; and, as he advanced, these rumours took a more definite, also a more correct, form.  In time he came to understand that the floating islands were gigantic kayaks, or canoes, with masts and sails, instead of trees and wings.  The burning mountain, however, remained an unmodified mystery, which he was still inclined to disbelieve.  But these more correct views did not in the least abate Chingatok's eager desire to behold, with his own eyes, the strange men from the unknown south.  Eemerk formed one of the party who had volunteered to join Chingatok on this journey.  Not that Eemerk was influenced by large-minded views or a thirst for knowledge, but he could not bear the thought that his rival should have all the honour of going forth on a long journey of exploration to the mysterious south, a journey which was sure to be full of adventure, and the successful accomplishment of which would unquestionably raise him very much in the estimation of his tribe.  Eemerk had volunteered to go, not as second in command, but as an independent member of the party--a sort of free-lance.  Chingatok did not quite relish having Eemerk for a companion, but, being a good-humoured, easy-going fellow, he made no objection to his going. Eemerk took his wife with him.  Chingatok took his mother and little sister; also a young woman named Tekkona, who was his wife's sister. These were the only females of the exploring party.  Chingatok had left his wife behind him, because she was not robust at that time; besides, she was very small--as is usually the case with giants' wives--and he was remarkably fond of her, and feared to expose her to severe fatigue and danger.  The completed party of explorers numbered twenty souls, with their respective bodies, some of which latter were large, some small, but all strong and healthy.  Four of the men were friends of Eemerk, whom he had induced to join because he knew them to be kindred spirits who would support him.  \"I go to the ice-cliff to look upon the sea,\" said Chingatok one morning, drawing himself up to his full height, and unconsciously brushing some of the lamp-black off the roof of his hut with the hood of his sealskin coat.  At this point it may be well to explain, once for all, that our giant did not speak English, and as it is highly improbable that the reader understands the Eskimo tongue, we will translate as literally as possible--merely remarking that Chingatok's language, like his mind, was of a superior cast.  \"Why goes my son to the ice-cliff?\" asked Toolooha in a slightly reproachful tone.  \"Are not the floes nearer?  Can he not look on the great salt lake from the hummocks?  The sun has been hot a long time now.  The ice-cliffs are dangerous.  Their edges split off every day. If my son goes often to them, he will one day come tumbling down upon the floes and be crushed flat, and men will carry him to his mother's feet like a mass of shapeless blubber.\"  It is interesting to note how strong a resemblance there is in sentiment and modes of thought between different members of the human family. This untutored savage, this Polar giant, replied, in the Eskimo tongue, words which may be freely translated--\"Never fear, mother, I know how to take care of myself.\"  Had he been an Englishman, he could not have expressed himself more naturally.  He smiled as he looked down at his stout and genial mother, while she stooped and drew forth a choice morsel of walrus flesh from one of her boots.  Eskimo ladies wear enormous sealskin boots the whole length of their legs.  The tops of these boots are made extremely wide, for the purpose of stowing away blubber, or babies, or other odd articles that might encumber their hands.  Chingatok seemed the personification of savage dignity as he stood there, leaning on a short walrus spear.  Evidently his little mother doted on him.  So did Oblooria, a pretty little girl of about sixteen, who was his only sister, and the counterpart of her mother, hairy coat and tail included, only a few sizes smaller.  But Chingatok's dignity was marred somewhat when he went down on his hands and knees, in order to crawl through the low snow-tunnel which was the only mode of egress from the snow-hut.  Emerging at the outer end of the tunnel, he stood up, drew the hood of his sealskin coat over his head, shouldered his spear, and went off with huge and rapid strides over the frozen billows of the Arctic Sea.  Spring was far advanced at the time of which we write, and the sun shone not only with dazzling brilliancy, but with intense power on the fields of ice which still held the ocean in their cold unyielding embrace.  The previous winter had been unusually severe, and the ice showed little or no sign of breaking up, except at a great distance from land, where the heaving of the waves had cracked it up into large fields.  These were gradually parting from the main body, and drifting away with surface-currents to southern waters, there to be liquefied and re-united to their parent sea.  The particular part of the Greenland coast to which the giant went in his ramble is marked by tremendous cliffs descending perpendicularly into the water.  These, at one part, are divided by a valley tilled with a great glacier, which flows from the mountains of the interior with a steep declivity to the sea, into which it thrusts its tongue, or extreme end.  This mighty river of ice completely fills the valley from side to side, being more than two miles in width and many hundred feet thick. It seems as solid and motionless as the rocks that hem it in, nevertheless the markings on the surface resemble the currents and eddies of a stream which has been suddenly frozen in the act of flowing, and if you were to watch it narrowly, day by day, and week by week, you would perceive, by the changed position of objects on its surface, that it does actually advance or flow towards the sea.  A further proof of this advance is, that although the tongue is constantly shedding off large icebergs, it is never much decreased in extent, being"]]]
