These were men of various nations; Californians, Chinamen, Malays, Americans, Scotch, and English, and many of them looked not only rough but savage.  In truth, they were as diverse in their characters as in their appearance, some of them being men who had evidently moved in good society, while others were as evidently of the lowest--probably the convict--class. They had all, however, been thrown together by the force of a common interest.  All were bound for the gold-mines, and it was necessary that they should travel in company for mutual protection and assistance.  There were two guides, who had charge of ten pack-mules loaded with provisions for the storekeepers at some remote diggings.  These guides were stern, powerful, bronzed fellows, who had to make their way among rough men in difficult circumstances, and they seemed to be quite prepared to do so, being fearless, resolute, and armed to the teeth.  Joe Graddy had obtained permission, on promise of payment, to place his little fortune on the backs of the mules, so that he and Frank had nothing to carry save their weapons and blankets, besides a tin cup each at their girdles, and a water-bag.  \"Come, I like this sort of thing,\" said one of the party, an Englishman, when the order was given to start.  \"If it is all like this it will be uncommonly jolly.\"  \"I guess it ain't all like this, stranger,\" said one of the Americans with a good-humoured grin.  One of the guides laughed, and the other ejaculated \"humph!\" as they set forward.  There was indeed some ground for the remark of the Englishman, for the country through which they passed was most beautiful, and the weather delicious.  Their track lay over an undulating region of park-like land covered with short grass; clumps of bushes were scattered here and there about the plain, and high above these towered some magnificent specimens of the oak, sycamore, and Californian cypress, while in the extreme distance rose the ranges of the \"golden\" mountains--the Sierra Nevada-- in the midst of which lay the treasures of which they were in search.  All the members of the party were on foot, and, being fresh, full of hope, and eager to reach their destination.  They chatted gaily as they marched over the prairie.  On the way the good-humoured American seemed to take a fancy to Frank, with whom he had a great deal of animated conversation.  After asking our hero every possible question in regard to himself and intentions, he told him that he was Yankee,--a piece of superfluous information, by the way;--that his name was Jeffson, that he was a store-keeper at one of the farthest off diggings, that the chief part of the loading of one of the mules belonged to him, and that he was driving a considerable business in gold-dust without the trouble of digging for it.  Towards evening they came to a very small hole in the plain, which was dignified with the name of a well.  Here they stopped to replenish their water-casks.  \"Take as much as you can carry, men,\" said the principal guide, \"we've a long march to the next well, over sandy ground, and sometimes there ain't much water in it.\"  They all followed this advice with the exception of one man, a coarse savage-looking fellow, with a huge black beard and matted locks, who called himself Bradling, though there was ground for doubting whether that was the name by which he had been at first known in the world. This man pulled out an enormous brandy-flask, and with a scoffing laugh said:--  \"This is the water for me, mister guide, pure and unmixed, there's nothin' like it.\"  He nodded as he spoke, and put the flask to his lips, while the guide, who made no rejoinder, eyed him with a grave, stern expression of countenance.  That night they all encamped under the shade of a small clump of trees, kindled several large fires, and, heartily glad to be relieved of their back-burdens, sat down to enjoy supper.  After it was over pipes were smoked and stories told, until it was time to retire to rest.  Then each man lay down under his blanket, the sky being his canopy, and the howling of the wolves his lullaby.  It seemed to each sleeper, when awakened next morning, that he had only just closed his eyes, so sound had been his repose, and there was a great deal of violent yawning, stretching, grumbling, and winking before the whole party was finally aroused and ready to set forth.  However, they got under way at last, and early in the forenoon came to the edge of a sandy plain, which appeared to be interminable, with scarcely a blade of grass on it.  Here they halted for a few minutes.  \"How wide is the plain, guide?\" inquired Frank.  \"Forty miles,\" replied the man, \"and there's not a drop of water to be had till the end of the first twenty.  We'll get there about sundown, and replenish our kegs, if it's not all gone dry.  Let me warn you, however, to use the water you have sparingly.\"  \"Do we encamp at the end o' the first twenty?\" asked Jeffson.  \"Yes, you'll find it a long enough day's march.\"  No one made any reply, but by their looks they appeared to think nothing of a twenty-mile walk.  They found, however, that such a distance, traversed over loose sand ankle-deep, and under a burning sun, was not what any of them had been accustomed to.  On entering the plain they observed that the heat had opened cracks and fissures in the earth, which omitted a fiery heat.  At intervals pyramids of sand arose, which were borne with great velocity through the air, sometimes appearing in the shape of columns sixty feet high, which moved majestically over the plain.  Ere long some of these clouds of sand enveloped them, and they were accompanied by hot winds, which seemed to shrivel up, not only the skin, but the very vitals of the travellers.  The pores of their skin closed, producing feverish heat in the blood and terrible thirst, while their eyes became inflamed by the dazzling glare of the sun on the white sand.  Of course most of the party applied pretty frequently to their water-kegs and bottles.  Even Bradling gave up his brandy, and was content to refresh himself with the little of the pure element which chanced to remain in his formerly despised, but now cherished, water-bottle.  The guides carried skins of water for themselves and the mules, but these they opened very seldom, knowing full well the torments that would ensue if they should run short before getting across the scorching desert.  Thus they went on hour after hour, becoming more and more oppressed at every step.  The improvident among them drank up the precious water too fast, and towards evening began to sigh for relief, and to regard with longing eyes the supplies of their more self-denying companions.  They consoled themselves, however, to some extent, with thoughts of the deep draughts they hoped to obtain at night.  Our hero and Joe were among those who reserved their supplies.  As night approached the thirst of the travellers increased to a terrible extent, insomuch that they appeared to forget their fatigue, and hurried forward at a smart pace, in the eager hope of coming to the promised water-hole.  Great, therefore, was their dismay when the guides told them that it was impossible to reach the place that night, that the mules were too much knocked up, but that they would get to it early on the following day.  They said little, however, seeming to be too much depressed to express their disappointment in words, but their haggard looks were fearfully eloquent.  Some of those who had wasted their supplies earnestly implored their more prudent comrades to give them a little, a \"very little,\" of the precious element, and two or three were generous enough to give away a few drops of the little that still remained to them.  The place where they had halted was without a scrap of vegetation, and as there was no wood wherewith to kindle a fire, they were compelled to encamp without one.  To most of the travellers, however, this was a matter of little importance, because they were too much exhausted to eat.  Those who had water drank a mouthful sparingly, and then lay down to sleep.  Those who had none also lay down in gloomy silence.  They did not even indulge in the usual solace of a pipe, for fear of adding to the burning thirst with which they were consumed.  At day-break they were aroused by the guides, and rose with alacrity, feeling a little refreshed, and being anxious to push on to the water-hole, but when the sun rose and sent its dazzling rays over the dreary waste, giving promise of another dreadful day, their spirits sank again.  Seeing this the principal guide encouraged them by saying that the water-hole was not more than three miles distant.  Onward they pushed with renewed energy and hope.  At last they reached the place, and found that the hole was dry!  With consternation depicted on their haggard countenances the men looked at the guide.  \"Dig, men, dig,\" he said, with a troubled look on his bronzed face, \"there may be a little below the surface.\"  They did dig with shovels, spades, knives, sticks, hands, anything, and they dug as never men did for gold.  All the gold in California would they have given at that time for a cupful of cold water, but all the gold in the world could not have purchased one drop from the parched sand.  Never was despair more awfully pictured on men's faces as they gazed at one another after finding that their efforts were unavailing. Their case was truly pitiable, and they turned to the guide as if they expected commiseration; but the case had become too desperate for him to think of others.  In a stern, hard voice he cried--  \"Onwards, men! onwards!  The nearest stream is forty miles off.  None of those who have water can spare a drop, and death lies in delay.  Every man for himself now.  Onward, men, for your lives!\"  Saying this he applied the whip to the poor mules, which, with glazed eyes and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21728"],["title","The Dog Crusoe and his Master (#1)"],["body","where his fancy led him, as grave and silent as an Indian warrior.  After all, there was nothing mysterious in this.  The boy followed implicitly the dictates of nature within him.  He was amiable, straightforward, sanguine, and intensely _earnest_.  When he laughed he let it out, as sailors have it, \"with a will.\"  When there was good cause to be grave, no power on earth could make him smile.  We have called him boy, but in truth he was about that uncertain period of life when a youth is said to be neither a man nor a boy.  His face was good-looking (_every_ earnest, candid face is) and masculine; his hair was reddish-brown, and his eye bright blue.  He was costumed in the deerskin cap, leggings, moccasins, and leathern shirt common to the western hunter.  \"You seem tickled wi' the Injuns, Dick Varley,\" said a man who at that moment issued from the block-house.  \"That's just what I am, Joe Blunt,\" replied the youth, turning with a broad grin to his companion.  \"Have a care, lad; do not laugh at 'em too much.  They soon take offence; an' them Red-skins never forgive.\"  \"But I'm only laughing at the baby,\" returned the youth, pointing to the child, which, with a mixture of boldness and timidity, was playing with a pup, wrinkling up its fat visage into a smile when its playmate rushed away in sport, and opening wide its jet-black eyes in grave anxiety as the pup returned at full gallop.  \"It 'ud make an owl laugh,\" continued young Varley, \"to see such a queer pictur' o' itself.\"  He paused suddenly, and a dark frown covered his face as he saw the Indian woman stoop quickly down, catch the pup by its hind-leg with one hand, seize a heavy piece of wood with the other, and strike it several violent blows on the throat.  Without taking the trouble to kill the poor animal outright, the savage then held its still writhing body over the fire in order to singe off the hair before putting it into the pot to be cooked.  The cruel act drew young Varley's attention more closely to the pup, and it flashed across his mind that this could be no other than young Crusoe, which neither he nor his companion had before seen, although they had often heard others speak of and describe it.  Had the little creature been one of the unfortunate Indian curs, the two hunters would probably have turned from the sickening sight with disgust, feeling that, however much they might dislike such cruelty, it would be of no use attempting to interfere with Indian usages.  But the instant the idea that it was Crusoe occurred to Varley he uttered a yell of anger, and sprang towards the woman with a bound that caused the three Indians to leap to their feet and grasp their tomahawks.  Blunt did not move from the gate, but threw forward his rifle with a careless motion, but an expressive glance, that caused the Indians to resume their seats and pipes with an emphatic \"Wah!\" of disgust at having been startled out of their propriety by a trifle, while Dick Varley snatched poor Crusoe from his dangerous and painful position, scowled angrily in the woman's face, and, turning on his heel, walked up to the house, holding the pup tenderly in his arms.  Joe Blunt gazed after his friend with a grave, solemn expression of countenance till he disappeared; then he looked at the ground and shook his head.  Joe was one of the regular out-and-out backwoods hunters, both in appearance and in fact--broad, tall, massive, lion-like,--gifted with the hunting, stalking, running, and trail--following powers of the savage, and with a superabundance of the shooting and fighting powers, the daring and dash of the Anglo-Saxon.  He was grave, too seldom smiled, and rarely laughed.  His expression almost at all times was a compound of seriousness and good-humour.  With the rifle he was a good, steady shot; but by no means a \"crack\" one.  _His_ ball never failed to _hit_, but it often failed to kill.  After meditating a few seconds, Joe Blunt again shook his head, and muttered to himself; \"The boy's bold enough, but he's too reckless for a hunter.  There was no need for that yell, now--none at all.\"  Having uttered this sagacious remark, he threw his rifle into the hollow of his left arm, turned round, and strode off with a long, slow step towards his own cottage.  Blunt was an American by birth, but of Irish extraction, and to an attentive ear there was a faint echo of the _brogue_ in his tone, which seemed to have been handed down to him as a threadbare and almost worn-out heirloom.  Poor Crusoe was singed almost naked.  His wretched tail seemed little better than a piece of wire filed off to a point, and he vented his misery in piteous squeaks as the sympathetic Varley confided him tenderly to the care of his mother.  How Fan managed to cure him no one can tell, but cure him she did, for, in the course of a few weeks, Crusoe was as well, and sleek, and fat as ever.    CHAPTER TWO.  A SHOOTING MATCH AND ITS CONSEQUENCES--NEW FRIENDS INTRODUCED TO THE READER--CRUSOE AND HIS MOTHER CHANGE MASTERS.  Shortly after the incident narrated in the last chapter, the squatters of the Mustang Valley lost their leader.  Major Hope suddenly announced his intention of quitting the settlement, and returning to the civilised world.  Private matters, he said, required his presence there--matters which he did not choose to speak of but which would prevent his returning again to reside among them.  Go he must, and, being a man of determination, go he did; but before going he distributed all his goods and chattels among the settlers.  He even gave away his rifle, and Fan, and Crusoe.  These last, however, he resolved should go together; and as they were well worth having, he announced that he would give them to the best shot in the valley.  He stipulated that the winner should escort him to the nearest settlement eastward, after which he might return with the rifle on his shoulder.  Accordingly, a long level piece of ground on the river's bank, with a perpendicular cliff at the end of it, was selected as the shooting ground, and, on the appointed day, at the appointed hour, the competitors began to assemble.  \"Well, lad, first as usual,\" exclaimed Joe Blunt, as he reached the ground and found Dick Varley there before him.  \"I've bin here more than an hour lookin' for a new kind o' flower that Jack Morgan told me he'd seen.  And I've found it too.  Look here; did you ever see one like it before?\"  Blunt leaned his rifle against a tree, and carefully examined the flower.  \"Why, yes, I've seed a-many o' them up about the Rocky Mountains, but never one here-away.  It seems to have gone lost itself.  The last I seed, if I remimber rightly, wos near the head-waters o' the Yellowstone River, it wos--jest where I shot a grizzly bar.\"  \"Was that the bar that gave you the wipe on the cheek?\" asked Varley, forgetting the flower in his interest about the bear.  \"It was.  I put six balls in that bar's carcase, and stuck my knife into its heart ten times afore it gave out; an' it nearly ripped the shirt off my back afore I was done with it.\"  \"I would give my rifle to get a chance at a grizzly!\" exclaimed Varley, with a sudden burst of enthusiasm.  \"Whoever got it wouldn't have much to brag of,\" remarked a burly young backwoodsman, as he joined them.  His remark was true, for poor Dick's weapon was but a sorry affair.  It missed fire, and it hung fire, and even when it did fire it remained a matter of doubt in its owner's mind whether the slight deviations from the direct line made by his bullets were the result of _his_ or _its_ bad shooting.  Further comment upon it was checked by the arrival of a dozen or more hunters on the scene of action.  They were a sturdy set of bronzed, bold, fearless men, and one felt, on looking at them, that they would prove more than a match for several hundreds of Indians in open fight. A few minutes after, the major himself came on the ground with the prize rifle on his shoulder, and Fan and Crusoe at his heels--the latter tumbling, scrambling, and yelping after its mother, fat and clumsy, and happy as possible, having evidently quite forgotten that it had been nearly roasted alive only a few weeks before.  Immediately all eyes were on the rifle, and its merits were discussed with animation.  And well did it deserve discussion, for such a piece had never before been seen on the western frontier.  It was shorter in the barrel and larger in the bore than the weapons chiefly in vogue at that time, and, besides being of beautiful workmanship, was silver-mounted.  But the grand peculiarity about it, and that which afterwards rendered it the mystery of mysteries to the savages, was, that it had two sets of locks--one percussion, the other flint--so that, when caps failed, by taking off the one set of locks and affixing the others, it was converted into a flint-rifle.  The major, however, took care never to run short of caps, so that the flint locks were merely held as a reserve in case of need.  \"Now, lads,\" cried Major Hope, stepping up to the point whence they were to shoot, \"remember the terms.  He who first drives the nail obtains the rifle, Fan, and her pup, and accompanies me to the nearest settlements. Each man shoots with his own gun, and draws lots for the chance.\"  \"Agreed,\" cried the men.  \"Well, then, wipe your guns and draw lots.  Henri will fix the nail. Here it is.\"  The individual who stepped, or rather plunged forward to receive the nail was a rare and remarkable specimen of mankind.  Like his comrades, he was half a farmer and half a hunter.  Like them, too, he was clad in deerskin, and was tall and strong--nay, more, he was gigantic.  But, unlike them, he was clumsy, awkward, loose-jointed, and a bad shot. Nevertheless Henri was an immense favourite in the settlement, for his good-humour knew no bounds.  No one ever saw him frown.  Even when fighting with the savages, as he was sometimes compelled to do in self-defence, he went at them with a sort of jovial"]]]
