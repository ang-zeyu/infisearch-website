He calls Himself \"The Son of Man\"; there is no boasting, \"I am the Son of God.\"  III.  _Obstinacy_.  That is the third source of discord.  Each man follows his own will, his dogged, headlong will, regardless of the wishes and advice of others.  In the Book of Judges we read that Samson caught three hundred foxes and tied them together by their tails, and put burning brands between them, where their tails were tied.  What was the consequence?  The wretched creatures dashed in opposite directions, each wanted to get away from the brand that scorched his tail, and so each wanted to go exactly in a different direction from the fox to which he was tied, and so the whole lot went dashing in a mad, disorderly manner among the standing corn, and destroyed a whole harvest.  That is something like a great number of people I know.  They will tear off in their own direction, and drag others after them who wish to go in another direction, and the fire of discord is between them.  Look at the Blessed Trinity.  Christ said, \"I came not to do mine own will, but the will of Him that sent me.\"  \"Let us make man,\" was said at the Creation.  God the Father did not say \"I will make man,\" nor God the Son \"I will make man in My image,\" nor God the Holy Ghost \"I will make man, and breathe My spirit into him,\" but all united in one work, and that work was very good.  CONCLUSION.--When Julian the Apostate was Emperor, three Christian soldiers were brought before him.  Their names were Emmanuel, Sabael, and Ismael.  He ordered them to be examined apart, lest they should encourage one another in their faith and endurance under torture.  Emmanuel, seeing his object, said, \"Tyrant! we Three are one in one Trinity.\"  Now, listen to our Lord's prayer, \"I pray not for these alone, but for those also which shall believe on Me through their word, that they all may be one; as Thou, Father, art in me, and I in Thee.\"     XXXVIII.  _GREAT SURPRISES._  1st Sunday after Trinity.  S. Luke xvi. 23.  \"In hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments.\"   INTRODUCTION.--What a great surprise for Dives!  So utterly unawaited! Dives, who had lived so comfortably, clothed in purple and fine linen, and had had such a good coat, and such excellent dinners, and such a cellar of wine, and such good friends at his dinners, goes to sleep one night after a banquet, and wakes up, and lo!--he is in hell.  Surprise number one.  He feels the flames, he perceives himself surrounded by demons, his tongue is burning with thirst, and he lifts up his eyes and sees!--surprise number two!--Lazarus, the poor dirty wretch who had lain full of sores at his door.  He did not know that the fellow was dead.  And--surprise number three!--this wretched fellow is in Paradise.  There is another story of a great surprise in the Gospels.  That is of the man who laid up for himself great possessions, and said to himself, \"Soul! thou hast much goods laid up for many years,--I will pull down my barns and build greater--take thy ease, eat, drink and be merry.\" That night he died, and when his soul came to realise the fact that he had nothing left of all he had laid by--that was a great surprise, and a very unpleasant one.  SUBJECT.--Let us take care that we do not have some such a great and unpleasant surprise ourselves.  \"Take heed,\" says our Lord, \"to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares.\"  I.  Now I am going to tell you a story of another great surprise.  The king of Syria was engaged in war with the king of Israel, and one of the servants of the king of Syria told him that Elisha the Prophet saw and knew all that was planned by him against the king of Israel, and that he told the king of Israel, so that the Syrians were never able to catch him at a disadvantage, and defeat him.  Then the king of Syria enquired where this prophet lived, and was told that he was then at Dothan.  \"Therefore sent he thither horses and chariots, and a great host: and they came by night and compassed the city about.\"  Then Elisha prayed to God to deceive and blind the eyes of the soldiers, and he went out of the gates of Dothan to them, and said, \"This is not the way, neither is this the city; follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom you seek.\"  So he went before, and led them along the road to Samaria, the capital of the king of Israel.  Then he brought them all in through the gates, and they followed, as docile as lambs, and when they were in the market-place, he said, \"Lord, open the eyes of these men, that they may see.\"  And the Lord opened their eyes, and lo! they were in the market-place in the midst of Samaria, and all around them were the soldiers of their enemy, the king of Israel, with swords drawn, and in the windows were others armed with stones and javelins and molten lead to hurl down on them.  Here was an unpleasant surprise!  The king of Israel and all his soldiers were eager to be at them and cut them to pieces, but Elisha was too good-hearted for that, he persuaded the king to be generous, to give them their breakfast and send them home.  So \"He prepared great provisions for them; and when they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master.\"  They were lucky to be let off so easily, and they owed their lives to there being a Saint of God there to intercede for them.  But you may be assured to their dying day they carried with them a lively recollection of the very unpleasant surprise it was to them when their eyes were opened, and they found themselves in the midst of their enemies, when they fondly supposed themselves in the humble and undefended little town of Dothan.  II.  Now for you!--Whither are you going?  Whither are you being led? Are you at all aware?  I very much fear that a great many of you are as blind and as ignorant of the road you are treading as were those soldiers of the king of Syria.  You are going on headlong, chattering with one another, laughing and singing, in open order, very little discipline, and perfectly confident that you will come to no harm. Take care!  Some day your eyes will be opened, and you will experience an unpleasant surprise.  Then, when your eyes are opened you will see yourselves surrounded by the enemies of your souls, ready to drag you to destruction, and no help near.  Very unexpected was this case of the Syrians, that the prophet prayed for them, and that instead of being put to death they were fed and sent away in peace.  That is not what you must expect.  Dives, when his eyes were opened, cried to Abraham, but got no help, no, not even a drop of water to cool his tongue.  III.  No man need go blindly to destruction, for God has given him guidance, and power of seeing whither he goes.  The prophet led these soldiers of Syria into the midst of their enemies, but God's good Spirit, which is our guide, will lead us into the Land of Righteousness if we will listen to His voice, and go where he points the way.  We have no right to plead blindness and ignorance, if hereafter we find that we have gone astray, and our eyes are opened when we are in the midst of our enemies, for blindness can not come upon us unless we wilfully shut our eyes to the light, and with the teaching of Christ and His Church ever sounding in our ears, we have no right to plead ignorance.  Moreover, God is so merciful, that He never allows any to go to destruction unwarned of their danger.  As He sent His angel to stand in the way of Balaam, so will He send some check, and throw some obstacle in the road you are treading, to bring you to your senses in time, and will not allow you to perish, unless you wilfully and deliberately persist in the road of evil, knowing the consequences, and knowing whither you are going.  CONCLUSION.--Lastly.  It was a great surprise to Lazarus when he found himself in Paradise.  He had no doubt hoped and prayed to be admitted there, but when he found himself there, he was amazed to see how far its happiness and its peace surpassed his expectations.  So with those of us who are found meet to enter Heaven.  However great our anticipations, they will be surpassed.  Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither hath it entered into the heart of man, to conceive those good things which God hath prepared for those who love Him.  May He bring us all to that glad surprise.     XXXIX.  _THE HOLY COMMUNION._  2nd Sunday after Trinity.  S. Luke xiv. 16.  \"A certain man made a great supper.\"   INTRODUCTION.--When the fulness of time was come, God the Eternal Father said: \"In burnt-offerings and sacrifices for sin, I have no pleasure.\"  Then said the Son, \"Lo, I come.\"  He came that He might take away the valueless sacrifice, and establish the one full and perfect propitiation for the sins of the world.  And indeed it was time.  All creation was groaning and travailing in pain, and waiting for redemption, then said He--\"Lo, I come.\"  The souls of the faithful were in Hades, prophets, patriarchs, and kings, desirous to see His Day, prisoners of Hope, desirous to be released by His Blood of the Covenant,--then said He--\"Lo, I come.\"  Men wandered in darkness, desiring light, the whole head was sick, and the whole heart faint, and in their error, darkly, and in their sickness, faintly, they sought the Lord, if haply they might feel after Him; then said He--\"Lo, I come.\"  They knew not the way of God how they might walk, and they needed a guide; then said He--\"Lo, I come.\"  They were sunk in sin, and found that the old bloody sacrifices and burnt offerings could not take away guilt, they needed a more perfect sacrifice; then said He--\"Lo, I come.\"  They knew not what the nature of God was, and they formed to themselves gods, in the likeness of men. How should they know without a teacher?  Then said He--\"Lo, I come.\"  Nor is this all.  At this day, still His answer is, promptly, when He is needed--\"Lo, I come.\"  Does"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21987"],["title","The Village Pulpit, Volume II. Trinity to Advent (#2)"],["body","father desire his dear little one to be taken into the arms of Christ and blessed, still His answer is--\"Lo, I come.\"  Does any man need direction, guidance, help in the way of life?  He says, \"Lo, I come; I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.\"  Does any desire sustaining food by the way?  He says--\"Lo, I come, and the Bread I give is My flesh, which I give for the life of the world.\"  Is any burdened with the weight of sin, and desires pardon and reconciliation, He says--\"Lo, I come, though thy sins be as scarlet, they shall be made as white as wool.\"  Is any in sorrow, and heart sore?  He says, \"Lo, I come to bind up the broken-hearted.\"  Is any dying?--He is still ready with His answer, \"Lo, I come, when thou goest through the waters I am with thee.\"  You see how striking is the readiness of Our Blessed Lord.  Now look at to-day's Gospel, and see how this is met by man.  Christ is represented as having made a great supper, the Holy Eucharist, and to that he invites all Christians, and He sends forth His messengers to bid them come, then they all with one consent begin to make excuse.  The messengers go to the man who has bought oxen, and invite him to the supper of his lord, and his answer is, \"I pray thee, have me excused.\" They go to a man who has bought a farm, and his answer is, \"I pray thee, have me excused.\"  They go to a man who has married a wife, and his answer is, \"I cannot come.\"  \"Lo, I come!\" says Christ.  \"I cannot come,\" says man.  \"Lo, I come to man,\" says Christ.  \"I cannot come to Christ,\" says man.  I.  It was the rule among the early Christians to communicate every Lord's Day.  The rule of the Church, as laid down in the service-books, then ordered that all those who were open and scandalous livers, all those who had committed some deadly sin, and had not been reconciled to God, should leave church before the Consecration, after the reading of the Gospel.  Now suppose some good old bishop of that day were to rise from the dead, and come into this church, what would he see?--Directly the sermon is over,--a rush of almost all in the church, men, women, and children, running out of the door, and only three or four, or at most a dozen, remaining to partake of the Lord's Body.  That is what he would see.  Now, what would he say?--He would lift up his hands in horror, and say, \"What is this?  All these notorious sinners!  All these open profligates!  All these burdened with mortal sin, cutting them off from the grace of God!  Take me back to my grave, I do not want to see any more of such horrible days.\"  But if I happened to be present, I would say to him.  \"You are jumping to conclusions too rashly.  Times are altered.  It is not the criminals and profligates who go out of church before the Consecration of the Blessed Sacrament, and are unworthy to eat of the Lord's Body, it is those who cannot make up their minds to do exactly what the Lord commanded; it is those who are half-hearted, who wish to serve God, but do not want to serve Him very much.\"  Then, I doubt not, the old bishop would turn upon me with a wrathful face, and say, \"Let me go back to my grave!  This is worse!  A thousand times worse!  The whole Christian world has grown cold of heart, and dead of faith, if all with one consent begin to make excuse, and say, 'I cannot come.'  I had rather they were either hot or cold, but because they are neither hot nor cold--away!  I cannot bear to look at their faces!  Let me go back to my grave.\"  III.  I know what is passing in your minds as well as if you had got glass skulls.  And this is what I see that not a few of you are thinking.  \"Ha! there is the Parson at it again! always hammering away at Communion.  Can he not leave us alone?  Let him talk to us of other matters; let him preach to us some real stinging gospel truth, and make us wince.  Anything but this eternal preaching about coming to Communion.\"  Now I will tell you why I preach about this, and hammer, hammer, at it.  Because it is good stinging gospel truth, and the grumbling that is going on is because your consciences really are wincing at what I say.  Listen:--other folks talked like you in olden times.  When the children of Israel came out of Egypt, God in mercy sent them Bread from Heaven, the manna, to feed them on their way through the wilderness.  What said the people in return for the blessing?  Were they very grateful?  Were they very eager to gather up the Angels' food?  By no means, they sat grumbling in their tents and said, \"Our soul is dried away; there is nothing beside this manna before our eyes.\"  Put into modern language that is, \"Our souls have dried up for want of preaching of free justification, and no good at all in keeping the law; we don't want any of your Sacramental teaching, no Communion for us, we can do very well without that, our soul abhorreth this light food, as for this Holy Communion, there is nothing but that preached to us, year in, year out.\"  Well!  If this Sacramental teaching be not God's own blessed Gospel, there is no meaning in words.  Listen to this!  I never said anything so strong, and this is what Christ Himself spake:--\"I am the Bread of Life.  Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead.  I am the living bread which came down from heaven, if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is My flesh, which I give for the life of the world.\"  \"Verily, verily, I say unto you, except ye eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.  Whoso eateth My flesh, and drinketh My blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.  For My flesh is meat indeed, and My blood is drink indeed.\"  Now--mark you.  When Jesus said this, many of His disciples said, \"This is a hard saying\"--and, from that time they went back, and walked no more with Him.  It is so still, it will be so always.  Just as many of the old Israelites loathed the manna and said, \"Our souls are dried away; there is nothing but this manna before our eyes,\" so there always will be faithless disciples who when they hear the invitation to partake of the Body of Christ, the true Manna, will say, \"This is a hard saying,\" and will thenceforth no more walk with Him.     XL.  _RECEIVING AND REJECTING._  3rd Sunday after Trinity.  S. Luke, xv. 2.  \"This Man receiveth sinners.\"   INTRODUCTION.--In to-day's Gospel our Lord represents Himself as a Good Shepherd seeking His lost sheep, going out into the wilderness after them, to bring them back into the fold.  The fold is that place where He keeps His flock shut behind the hurdles of the Ten Commandments.  Every now and then a sheep leaps one of these hurdles, or pushes his way between them, and runs away into forbidden pastures.  Then the Good Shepherd goes after the erring sheep, and brings it back.  \"And when he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost.\"  SUBJECT.--Christ is not always to be regarded as the Saviour receiving sinners.  The time will come when He will be the Judge, rejecting them. He is a shepherd now, bringing back the straying sheep, and replacing them in the fold, but one day He will do just the contrary, He will go to His fold, and pick out the incorrigibly bad sheep, and cast them out.  I.  We will consider Him now as the Good Shepherd.  What is His purpose in bringing back the straying sheep?  That they may remain within bounds for the future.  Christ has come to save sinners, that is to say, He brings them to repentance, and pardons their transgressions, in order that, for the future, they may walk in newness of life, and not commit the sins of which they were guilty before.  Thus if He brings back one who has been a liar, it is to truth that he returns, and Christ expects him to speak the truth ever after.  If He brings back a drunkard, it is to temperance, and He expects him to be sober for the future.  If He brings back one who has sinned through impurity, it is to chastity and modesty.  This is what S. Paul means when he says, \"Put off concerning the former conversation, the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts; and be renewed in the spirit of your mind.  Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbour.  Let him that stole steal no more, let no corrupt conversation proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying.  Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice.  And be ye kind one to another, tender hearted, forgiving one another.\"  II.  We will consider Christ as the Judge.  The time will come when He will separate the bad from the good, when He will go over His fold, and pick out all those diseased sheep which are good for nothing, and which taint and infect the others, and will cast them outside.  That is to say, the time will come, when Christ will no more call sinners to Him, and bring them to His Church, but will examine those who are in His Church, and unless they have mended their ways, unless they have become better for being there, He will throw them out, and have nothing further to do with them.  When Joshua was leading the people of God into the Promised Land, God said to Joshua, \"Up!  Sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against to-morrow.\"  In what did this sanctification consist?  \"Joshua rose early in the morning, and brought Israel by their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken: and he brought the family of Judah; and took the family of the Zarhites: and he brought the family of the Zarhites man by man; and Zabdi was taken: and he brought his household man by man; and Achan, the son of Carmi was taken.\"  Then Joshua learned how this man had sinned and incurred the anger of God, and he and all Israel carried him and his family outside the camp unto the valley of Achor, \"and all Israel stoned "]]]
