To find the factor of evaporation for a given set of conditions, locate the gage pressure at the top of the table and follow down that column to the horizontal line on which the feed-water temperature is located. The value in this column and on the horizontal line thus found is the factor of evaporation required. If the feed water has a temperature greater than 212° F., obtain the proper factor of evaporation from the Marks and Davis steam tables.  Take the data of the test, for example. The average steam pressure is 100 pounds, gage. The average feed-water temperature is 180° F. So, in the table locate the column headed 100 and follow down this column to the line having 180 at the ends, and the value where the column and the line cross is 1.0727, which is the factor of evaporation for a feed-water temperature of 180° F. and a steam pressure of 100 pounds, gage.  This factor, 1.0727, indicates that to change a pound of water at 180° F. to steam at 100 pounds requires 1.0727 times as much heat as to change a pound of water at 212° F. to steam at atmospheric pressure. In other words, the heat used in producing an actual evaporation of 7 pounds under the test conditions would have evaporated 7 × 1.0727 = 7.5 pounds from and at 212° F. Hence, 7.5 pounds is called the \"equivalent evaporation from and at 212° F.\" per pound of coal used.  As already stated, it takes 970.4 B. t. u. to make a pound of steam from and at 212° F. Then to make 7.5 pounds there would be required 7.5 × 970.4 = 7,278 B. t. u. This is the amount of heat required to change 7.5 pounds of water at 212° F. to steam at zero gage pressure, but it is also the heat required to change 7 pounds of water at 180° F. to steam at 100 pounds gage pressure, because 7.5 pounds from and at 212° F. is equivalent to 7 pounds from 180° F. to steam at 100 pounds. Therefore, the 7,278 B. t. u. is the amount of heat usefully employed in making steam per pound of coal fired, and so it is the _output_. Accordingly, the efficiency of the boiler is--                            Output    7,278           ~ Efficiency =  ------ = ------ = 0.54, nearly.                           Input    13,500  In other words, the efficiency of the boiler is 0.54, or 54 per cent, which means that only a little more than half of the heat in the coal is usefully employed in making steam.  The chart shown in figure 3 is given to save the work of figuring the efficiency. If the equivalent evaporation per pound of coal is calculated and the heating value of the coal is known, the boiler efficiency may be found directly from the chart. At the left-hand side locate the point corresponding to the equivalent evaporation and at the bottom locate the point corresponding to the heating value of the coal. Follow the horizontal and vertical lines from these two points until they cross, and note the diagonal line that is nearest to the crossing point. The figures marked on the diagonal line indicate the boiler efficiency.  Take the case just worked out, for example. The equivalent evaporation is 7.5 pounds and the heating value of the fuel is 13,500 B. t. u. At the left of the chart locate the point 7.5 midway between 7 and 8 and at the bottom locate the point 13,500 midway between 13,000 and 14,000. Then follow the horizontal and vertical lines from these two points until they cross, as indicated by the dotted lines. The crossing point lies on the diagonal corresponding to 54, and so the efficiency is 54 per cent.   BOILER HORSEPOWER OR CAPACITY.  The capacity of a boiler is usually stated in boiler horsepower. A boiler horsepower means the evaporation of 34.5 pounds of water per hour from and at 212° F. Therefore, to find the boiler horsepower developed during a test, calculate the evaporation from and at 212° F. per hour and divide it by 34.5.  Take the test previously mentioned, for example. The evaporation from and at 212° F. or the equivalent evaporation, was 7.5 pounds of water per pound of coal. The weight of coal burned per hour was 5,000 ÷ 10 = 500 pounds. Then the equivalent evaporation was 7.5 × 500 = 3,750 pounds per hour. According to the foregoing definition of a boiler horsepower, then--                                     3,750                Boiler horsepower = ----- = 109.                                     34.5   The \"rated horsepower\" of a boiler, or the \"builders' rating,\" is the number of square feet of heating surface in the boiler divided by a number. In the case of stationary boilers this number is 10 or 12, but 10 is very commonly taken as the amount of heating surface per horsepower. Assuming this value and assuming further that the boiler tested had 1,500 square feet of heating surface, its rated horsepower would be 1,500 ÷ 10 = 150 boiler horsepower.  It is often desirable to know what per cent of the rated capacity is developed in a test. This is found by dividing the horsepower developed during the test by the builders' rating. In the case of the boiler tested, 109 horsepower was developed. The percentage of rated capacity developed, therefore, was 109 ÷ 150 = 0.73, or 73 per cent.   HEATING SURFACE.  The heating surface of a boiler is the surface of metal exposed to the fire or hot gases on one side and to water on the other side. Thus, the internal surface of the tubes of a fire-tube boiler is the heating surface of the tubes, but the outside surface of the tubes of a water-tube boiler is the heating surface of those tubes. In addition to the tubes, all other surfaces which have hot gases on one side and water on the other must be taken into account. For instance, in a fire-tube boiler from one-half to two-thirds of the shell (depending on how the boiler is set) acts as heating surface. In addition to this, the surface presented by both heads, below the water level, has to be computed. The heating surface of each head is equal to two-thirds its area minus the total area of the holes cut away to receive the tubes.   COST OF EVAPORATION.  The cost of evaporation is usually stated as the cost of fuel required to evaporate 1,000 pounds of water from and at 212° F. To find it, multiply the price of coal per ton by 1,000 and divide the result by the product of the equivalent evaporation per pound of coal and the number of pounds in a ton.  Suppose that the cost of the coal used in the foregoing test was $3.60 per ton of 2,000 pounds. The equivalent evaporation per pound of coal was 7.5 pounds. Therefore the cost of evaporating 1,000 pounds of water from 180° F. to steam at 100-pound gage, is--                 $3.60 × 1,000                ------------- = $0.24, or 24 cents.                 7.5  × 2,000   TABLE OF TEST RESULTS.  After the test has been made and properly worked up, as heretofore described, collect all the results of the test on one sheet, so that they can be kept in convenient form for reference and for comparison with later tests. A brief form of arranging the results is as follows:    1. Date of test                                        May 20, 1918   2. Duration of test                             hours            10   3.

The object of working up a test is to obtain a clear idea as to the efficiency of operation of the boiler or its operating cost. Consequently, after the calculations have been made, they should be used as a basis for study with the idea of improving the boiler performance.  Take the matter of boiler efficiency, for example, as found from the test mentioned. Its value was 54 per cent. This is altogether too low and indicates wasteful operation. The efficiency of a hand-fired boiler ought not to be less than 65 per cent, and it can be increased to 70 per cent by careful management under good conditions.  The chart in figure 3 can be used to indicate the evaporation that should be obtained in order to reach a desired efficiency. Suppose, for example, that it is desired to know how much water per pound of coal must be evaporated to produce a boiler efficiency of 65 per cent with coal having a heating value of 13,500 B. t. u. per pound.  Locate 13,500 at the bottom of the chart, follow the vertical line until it meets the diagonal marked 65 per cent, and then from this point follow the horizontal line to the left-hand edge, where the figure 9 is found. This means that the equivalent evaporation from and by 212° F. per pound of coal must be 9 pounds of water. If the steam pressure is 100 pounds gauge, and the feed-water temperature is 180° F. the factor of evaporation is 1.0727, then the actual evaporation must be 9 ÷ 1.0727 = 8.36 pounds per pound of coal. In other words, to increase the efficiency from 54 per cent to 65 per cent under the same conditions of pressure and feed-water temperature, it would be necessary to increase the actual evaporation from 7 pounds to 8.36"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20147"],["title","Rip Foster Rides the Gray Planet (#1)"],["body","to see him. But the horn had called \"show an exhaust,\" which meant to get there in a hurry.  He jumped off the track at the main crossrun and hurried toward the center of the platform. In a moment he stood before the platform commander’s door, waiting to be identified.  The door swung open and a junior officer in the blue tunic and trousers of a spaceman motioned him to the inner room. \"Go in, Lieutenant.\"  \"Thank you.\" He hurried into the commander’s room and stood at attention.  Commander Jennsen, the Norwegian spaceman who had commanded the platform since before Rip’s arrival as a raw cadet, was dictating into his command relay circuit. As he spoke, printed copies were being received in the platform personnel office, Special Order Squadron headquarters on earth, aboard the cruiser _Bolide_ in high space, and aboard the newly landed cruiser _Scorpius_.  Rip listened, spellbound.  \"Foster, R.I.P., Lieutenant, SOS. Serial seven-nine-four-three. Assigned SOS Four. Change orders, effective this date-time. Cancel earth-leave. Subject officer will report to commander, SCN _Scorpius_ with detachment of nine men. Senior non-commissioned officer and second in command, Koa, A.P., Sergeant-major, SOS. Serial two-nine-four-one. Commander _Scorpius_ will transport detachment to coordinates given in basic cruiser astrocourse, delivering orders to detachment enroute. Take full steps for maximum security. This is Federation priority A, Space Council security procedures.\"  Rip swallowed hard. The highest possible priority, given by the Federation itself, had cancelled his leave. Not only that, but the cruiser to which he was assigned was instructed to follow Space Council security procedures, which meant the job, whatever it was, was rated even more urgent than secret!  Commander Jennsen looked up and saw Rip. He snapped, \"Did you get all of that?\"  \"Y-Yessir.\"  \"You’ll get written copies on the cruiser. Now flame out of here. Collect your men and get aboard. The _Scorpius_ leaves in five minutes.\"  Rip ran. The realization hit him that the big nuclear cruiser had stopped at the platform for the sole purpose of collecting him and nine enlisted Planeteers.  The low gravity helped him cover the hundred yards to the personnel office in five leaps. He swung to a stop by grabbing the push bar of the office door. He yelled at the enlisted spaceman on duty, \"Where do I find nine men?\"  The spaceman looked at him vacantly. \"What for? You got a requisition, Lieutenant?\"  \"Never mind requisitions,\" Rip snapped. \"I’ve got to find nine Planeteers and get them on the _Scorpius_ before it flames off.\"  The spaceman’s face cleared. \"Oh. You mean Koa’s detachment. They left a few minutes ago.\"  \"Where? Where did they go?\"  The spaceman shrugged. The doings of Planeteers were no concern of his. His shrug said so.  Rip realized there was no use talking further. He ran down the long corridor toward the outer edge of the platform. The enlisted men’s squadrooms were near Valve Ten. So was the supply department. His gear had departed on the Terra rocket, and he couldn’t go to space with only the tunic on his back. He swung to the high speed track and braced himself as it sped him along the platform’s rim.  There was no moving track inward to the enlisted Planeteers’ squadrooms. He legged it down the corridor in long leaps, muttering apologies as blue-clad spacemen and cadets moved to the wall to let him pass.  The squadrooms were on two levels. He looked in the upper ones and found them deserted. The squads were on duty somewhere. He ran for the ladder to the lower level, took the wrong one, and ended up in a snapper-boat port. He had trained in the deadly little fighting rockets, and they never failed to interest him. But there wasn’t time to admire them now. He went back up the ladder with two strong heaves, found the right ladder, and dropped down without touching. His knees flexed to take up the shock. He came out of the crouch facing a black-clad Planeteer sergeant who snapped to rigid attention.  \"Koa,\" Rip barked. \"Where can I find him?\"  \"He’s not here, sir. He and eight men left fifteen minutes ago. I don’t know where they went, sir.\"  Rip shot a worried glance at his wrist chronometer. He had two minutes left, before the cruiser departed. No more time now to search for his men. He hoped the sergeant-major had sense enough to be waiting at some sensible place. He went up the ladder hand over hand and sped down the corridor to the supply room.  The spaceman first class in charge of supplies was turning an audio-mag through a hand viewer, chuckling at the cartoons. At the sight of Rip’s flushed, anxious face he dropped the machine. \"Yessir?\"  \"I need a spack. Full gear including bubble.\"  \"Yessir.\" The spaceman looked him over with a practiced eye. \"One full space pack. That would be medium-large, right, sir?\"  \"Correct.\" Rip took the counter stylus and inscribed his name, serial number, and signature on the blank plastic sheet. Gears whirred as the data was recorded.  The spaceman vanished into an inner room and reappeared in a moment lugging a plastic case called a space pack, or \"spack\" for short. It contained complete personal equipment for space travel. Rip grabbed it. \"Fast service. Thanks, Rocky.\" All spacemen were called \"Rocky\" if you didn’t know their names. It was an abbreviation for rocketeer, a title all of them had once carried.  Valve Eight was some distance away. Rip decided a cross ramp would be faster than the moving track. He swung the spack to his shoulder and made his legs go. Seconds were ticking off, and he had an idea the _Scorpius_ would make space on time, whether or not he arrived. He lengthened his stride and rounded a turn by going right up on the wall, using a powerful leg thrust against a ventilator tube for momentum.  He passed an observation port as he reached the platform rim and caught a glimpse of ruddy rocket exhaust flames outlined against the dark curve of earth. That would be the Terra rocket making its controlled fall to home with Flip aboard. Without slowing, he leaped across the high speed track, narrowly missing a senior space officer. He shouted his apologies, and gained the entrance to Valve Eight just as the high buzz of the radiation warning sounded, signaling a nuclear drive cruiser preparing to take off.  Nine faces of assorted colors and expressions turned to him. He had a quick impression of black tunics and trousers. He had found his detachment! Without slowing, he called, \"Follow me!\"  The cruiser’s safety officer had been keeping an eye on the clock, his forehead creased in a frown as he saw that only a few seconds remained to departure time. He walked to the valve opening and looked out. If his passengers were not in sight, he would have to reset the clock.  Rip went through the valve opening at top speed. He crashed head-on into the safety officer.  The safety officer was driven across the deck, his arms pumping for balance. He grabbed at the nearest thing, which happened to be the deputy cruiser commander.  The pre-set control clock reached firing time. The valve slid shut and the take-off bell reverberated through the ship.  And so it happened that the spacemen of the SCN _Scorpius_ turned their valves, threw their controls and disengaged their boron control rods, and the great cruiser flashed into space, while the deputy commander and the safety officer were completely tangled with a very flustered and unhappy new Planeteer lieutenant.  Sergeant-major Koa and his men had made it before the valve closed. Koa, a seven-foot Hawaiian, took in the situation and said crisply in a voice all could hear, \"I’ll bust the bubble of any son of a space sausage who laughs!\"      CHAPTER TWO - RAKE THAT RADIATION!   The deputy commander and the safety officer got untangled and hurried to their posts with no more than black looks at Rip. He got to his feet, his face crimson with embarrassment. A fine entrance for a Planeteer officer, especially one on his first orders!  Around him, the spacemen were settling in their acceleration seats or snapping belts to safety hooks. From the direction of the stern came a rising roar as liquid methane dropped into the blast tubes, flaming into pure carbon and hydrogen under the terrible heat of the atomic drive.  Rip had to lean against the acceleration. Fighting for balance, he picked up his spack and made his way to the nine enlisted Planeteers. They had braced against the ship’s drive by sitting with backs against bulkheads, or by lying flat on the magnesium deck. Sergeant-major Koa was seated against a vertical brace, his brown face wreathed in a grin as he waited for his new officer.  Rip looked him over carefully. There was a saying among the Planeteers that an officer was only as good as his senior sergeant. Koa’s looks were reassuring. His face was good-humored, but he had a solid jaw and a mouth that could get tough when necessary. Rip wondered a little at his size. Big men usually didn’t go to space; they were too subject to space sickness. Koa must be a special case.  Rip slid to the floor next to the sergeant-major and stuck out his hand. He sensed the strength in Koa’s big fist as it closed over his.  Koa said, \"Sir, that was the best _fleedle_ I’ve ever seen an earthling make. You been on Venus?\"  Rip eyed him suspiciously, wondering if the big Planeteer was laughing at him. Koa was grinning, but it was a friendly grin. \"What is a _fleedle_?\" Rip demanded. \"I’ve never been on Venus.\"  \"It’s the way the water-hole people fight,\" Koa explained. \"They’re like a bunch of rubber balls when they get to fighting. They ram each other with their heads.\"  Rip searched his memory for data on Venus. He couldn’t recall any mention of _fleedling_. Venusians, if his memory was right, had a sort of blowgun as a main weapon. He told Koa so.  The sergeant-major nodded. \"That’s when they mean business, Lieutenant. _Fleedling_ is more like us fighting with our "]]]
