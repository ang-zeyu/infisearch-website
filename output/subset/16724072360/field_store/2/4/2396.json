He had forfeited the regard of all on board, though there were undoubtedly men there whose detestation of mutiny and whose sense of honour would have inclined them to aid him if they had not been overawed by the numbers and resolution of the mutineers.  The master, indeed, had already made an attempt to rally some of the men round him, but had failed, and been sent to his cabin.  He, with the others, was now in the boat.  Poor young Peter Heywood the middy looked on bewildered as if in a dream.  He could not be said in any sense, either by look or act, to have taken part with the mutineers.  At last he went below for some things, intending to go in the boat, but was ordered to remain below.  So also, it is thought, was Edward Young, another midshipman, who did not make his appearance on deck at all during the progress of the mutiny.  It was afterwards said that the leading seamen among the mutineers had purposely ordered these officers below, and detained them with a view to their working the ship in the event of anything happening to Christian.  Bligh now made a last appeal.  \"I'll give you my honour, Mr Christian,\" he said, \"never to think of what has passed this day if you will desist.  To cast us adrift here in an open boat is to consign us to destruction.  Think of my wife and family!\"  \"No, Captain Bligh,\" replied Christian, sternly; \"if you had any honour things had not come to this; and if you had any regard for your wife and family, you should have thought of them before and not behaved so much like a villain.  It is too late.  You have treated me like a dog all the voyage.  Come, sir, your officers and men are now in the boat, and you must go with them.  If you attempt resistance you shall be put to death.\"  Seeing that further appeal would be useless, Bligh allowed himself to be forced over the side.  When in the boat his hands were untied.  \"You will at least allow us arms, to defend ourselves from the savages,\" he said.  Fire-arms were refused, but four cutlasses were ultimately allowed him.  At this point Isaac Martin quietly descended into the boat, but Quintal, pointing a musket at him, threatened to shoot him if he did not return to the ship.  He obeyed the order with reluctance, and soon after the boat was cast adrift.  The crew of the _Bounty_ at the time consisted of forty-four souls, all told.  Eighteen of these went adrift with the Captain.  The remaining twenty-five steered back to the sunny isles of the Pacific.    CHAPTER TWO.  RECORDS THE DUTIES AND TROUBLES OF THE MUTINEERS.  It is not our purpose to follow the fortunes of Captain Bligh.  The mutineers in the _Bounty_ claim our undivided attention.  As regards Bligh, it is sufficient to say that he performed one of the most remarkable boat-voyages on record.  In an overloaded and open boat, on the shortest allowance of provision compatible with existence, through calm and tempest, heat and cold, exposed to the attacks of cannibals and to the reproaches of worn-out and mutinous men, he traversed 3618 miles of ocean in forty-one days, and brought himself and his followers to land, with the exception of one man who was killed by the natives.  In this achievement he displayed those qualities of indomitable resolution and unflagging courage which ultimately raised him to high rank in the navy.  But we leave him now to trace those incidents which result from the display of his other qualities-- ungovernable passion, overbearing impetuosity, and incomprehensible meanness.  The first act of Fletcher Christian, after taking command of the ship, was to serve out a glass of grog all round.  He then called a council of war, in which the mutineers discussed the question what they should do.  \"You see, lads,\" said Christian, \"it is absolutely certain that we shan't be left among these islands in peace.  Whether Bligh manages to get home or not, the British Government is sure to send out to see what has become of us.  My notion is that we should bear away to the south'ard, far out of the usual track of ships, find out some uninhabited and suitable island, and establish ourselves thereon?\"  \"What! without wives, or sisters, or mothers, or grandmothers, to say nothin' o' mothers-in-law, to cook our victuals an' look after our shirt-buttons?\" said Isaac Martin, who, having been detained against his will, had become lugubriously, or recklessly, facetious, and was stimulated to a sort of fierce hilarity by his glass of rum.  \"You're right, Martin,\" said Brown, the assistant botanist, \"we couldn't get along without wives, so I vote that we go back to Otaheite, get married, every man of us, an' ho! for the South Pole.  The British cruisers would never find us there.\"  There was a general laugh at this sally, but gravity returned almost instantly to every face, for they were in no humour just then for jesting.  It is probable that each man began to realise the dreadful nature of his position as an outlaw whose life was forfeited to his country, and who could never more hope to tread the shores of Old England, or look upon the faces of kindred or friends.  In such circumstances men sometimes try to hide their true feelings under a veil of recklessness or forced mirth, but seldom succeed in the attempt.  \"No man in his senses would go back to Otaheite--at least not to stay there,\" said John Adams, gravely; \"it's the first place they will send to look for us.\"  \"What's the odds?\" growled one of the seamen.  \"They won't look there for us for a long time to come, unless Cap'n Bligh borrows a pair of wings from an albatross, an' goes home as the crow flies.\"  At this point John Mills, the gunner's mate, a man of about forty, cleared his throat and gave it as his opinion that they should not go back to Otaheite, but should leave the matter of their future destination in the hands of Mr Christian, who was well able to guide them.  This proposal was heartily backed by Edward Young, midshipman, a stout young fellow of twenty-two, who was fond of Christian; but there were one or two dissentient voices, among which were the little middy Peter Heywood, his brother-officer George Stewart, and James Morrison the boatswain's mate.  These wished to return to Otaheite, but the counsel of the majority prevailed, and Christian ultimately steered for the island of Toubouai, which lay some five hundred miles to the south of Otaheite.  There he expected to be safe from pursuit, and there it was resolved that the mutineers should take up their abode if the natives proved friendly.  That night, while the _Bounty_ was skimming gently over the starlit sea before a light breeze, the three officers, Heywood, Stewart, and Young, leaned over the weather side of the quarter-deck, and held a whispered conversation.  \"Why did you vote for going back to Otaheite, Heywood?\" asked Young.  \"Because it is to Otaheite that they will send to look after us, and I should like to be there to give myself up, the instant a man-of-war arrives, and declare my innocence of the crime of mutiny.\"  \"You are right, Heywood,\" said Stewart; \"I, too, would like to give myself up the moment I get the chance.  Captain Bligh knows that you and I had no hand in the mutiny, and if he reaches England will clear us of so foul a stain.  It's a pity that those who voted for Otaheite were not in the majority.\"  \"That's all very well for you, who were seen to go below to fetch your clothes, and were detained against your will,\" said Young, \"but it was not so with me.  I was forcibly detained below.  They would not allow me to go on deck at all until the launch had left, so that it would go hard with me before a court-martial.  But the die is now cast, and there's no help for it.  Although I took no part in the mutiny, I won't risk falling into the hands of justice, with such an unprincipled scoundrel as Bligh to witness against me.  My future fortunes now lie with Fletcher Christian.  I cannot avoid my fate.\"  Young spoke sadly, yet with some bitterness of tone, like one who has made up his mind to face and endure the worst.  On reaching the remote island of Toubouai the mutineers were much impressed with its beauty.  It seemed exceedingly fertile, was wooded to the water's edge, and surrounded by a coral reef, with one opening through which a ship might enter.  Altogether it seemed a most suitable refuge, but here they met with an insurmountable difficulty.  On drawing near to the shore they saw hundreds of natives, who, armed with clubs and spears, lined the beach, blew their shell-horns, and resolutely opposed the landing of the strangers.  As all efforts to conciliate them were fruitless, resort was had to cannon and musketry.  Of course the terrible thunder of the white man's artillery had its usual effect on the savages.  They fled inland, and the mutineers gained a footing on the island.  But the natives continued their opposition so vigorously, that this refuge proved to be the reverse of a place of rest.  Christian therefore changed his plan, and, re-embarking in the _Bounty_, set sail for Otaheite.  On the way thither the mutineers disagreed among themselves.  Some of those who had been forcibly detained even began to plot the retaking of the ship, but their intentions were discovered and prevented.  On the 6th of June they reached their former anchorage in Otaheite, where the natives received them with much joy and some surprise, but a story was trumped up to account for this sudden re-appearance of the mutineers.  Christian, however, had not yet given up his intention of settling on the island of Toubouai.  He foresaw the doom that awaited him if he should remain at Otaheite, and resolved to return to the former island with a quantity of livestock.  He began to barter with the friendly Otaheitans, and soon had as many hogs, goats, fowls, cats, and dogs as he required, besides a bull and a cow which had been left there by Captain Cook.  With these and several natives he sailed again for Toubouai."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21748"],["title","Black Ivory (#1)"],["body","hain't got too many minits to spare in confabilation.\"  \"Well, what do you suggest?\"  \"Arter you, sir,\" said Disco, pulling his forelock; \"you are capting now, an' ought to give orders.\"  \"Then I think the best thing we can do,\" rejoined Harold, \"is to make straight for the shore, search for an opening in the reef, run through, and beach the vessel on the sand.  What say you?\"  \"As there's nothin' else left for us to do,\" replied Disco, \"that's 'zactly wot I think too, an' the sooner we does it the better.\"  \"Down with the helm, then,\" cried Harold, springing forward, \"and I'll ease off the sheets.\"  In a few minutes the `Aurora' was surging before a stiff breeze towards the line of foam which indicated the outlying reef, and inside of which all was comparatively calm.  \"If we only manage to get inside,\" said Harold, \"we shall do well.\"  Disco made no reply.  His whole attention was given to steering the brig, and running his eyes anxiously along the breakers, the sound of which increased to a thunderous roar as they drew near.  \"There seems something like a channel yonder,\" said Harold, pointing anxiously to a particular spot in the reef.  \"I see it, sir,\" was the curt reply.  A few minutes more of suspense, and the brig drove into the supposed channel, and struck with such violence that the foremast snapped off near the deck, and went over the side.  \"God help us, we're lost!\" exclaimed Harold, as a towering wave lifted the vessel up and hurled her like a plaything on the rocks.  \"Stand by to jump, sir,\" cried Disco.  Another breaker came roaring in at the moment, overwhelmed the brig, rolled her over on her beam-ends, and swept the two men out of her.  They struggled gallantly to free themselves from the wreck, and, succeeding with difficulty, swam across the sheltered water to the shore, on which they finally landed.  Harold's first exclamation was one of thankfulness for their deliverance, to which Disco replied with a hearty \"Amen!\" and then turning round and surveying the coast, while he slowly thrust his hands into his wet trouser-pockets, wondered whereabouts in the world they had got to.  \"To the east coast of Africa, to be sure,\" observed the young supercargo, with a slight smile, as he wrung the water out of the foot of his trousers, \"the place we were bound for, you know.\"  \"Werry good; so here we are--come to an anchor!  Well, I only wish,\" he added, sitting down on a piece of driftwood, and rummaging in the pockets before referred to, as if in search of something--\"I only wish I'd kep' on my weskit, 'cause all my 'baccy's there, and it would be a rael comfort to have a quid in the circumstances.\"  It was fortunate for the wrecked voyagers that the set of the current had carried portions of their vessel to the shore, at a considerable distance from the spot where they had landed, because a band of natives, armed with spears and bows and arrows, had watched the wreck from the neighbouring heights, and had hastened to that part of the coast on which they knew from experience the cargo would be likely to drift.  The heads of the swimmers being but small specks in the distance, had escaped observation.  Thus they had landed unseen.  The spot was near the entrance to a small river or creek, which was partially concealed by the formation of the land and by mangrove trees.  Harold was the first to observe that they had not been cast on an uninhabited shore.  While gazing round him, and casting about in his mind what was best to be done, he heard shouts, and hastening to a rocky point that hid part of the coast from his view looked cautiously over it and saw the natives.  He beckoned to Disco, who joined him.  \"They haven't a friendly look about 'em,\" observed the seaman, \"and they're summat scant in the matter of clothin'.\"  \"Appearances are often deceptive,\" returned his companion, \"but I so far agree with you that I think our wisest course will be to retire into the woods, and there consult as to our future proceedings, for it is quite certain that as we cannot live on sand and salt water, neither can we safely sleep in wet clothes or on the bare ground in a climate like this.\"  Hastening towards the entrance to the creek, the unfortunate pair entered the bushes, through which they pushed with some difficulty, until they gained a spot sufficiently secluded for their purpose, when they observed that they had passed through a belt of underwood, beyond which there appeared to be an open space.  A few steps further and they came out on a sort of natural basin formed by the creek, in which floated a large boat of a peculiar construction, with very piratical-looking lateen sails.  Their astonishment at this unexpected sight was increased by the fact that on the opposite bank of the creek there stood several men armed with muskets, which latter were immediately pointed at their breasts.  The first impulse of the shipwrecked friends was to spring back into the bushes--the second to advance and hold up their empty hands to show that they were unarmed.  \"Hold on,\" exclaimed Disco, in a free and easy confidential tone; \"we're friends, we are; shipwrecked mariners we is, so ground arms, my lads, an' make your minds easy.\"  One of the men made some remark to another, who, from his Oriental dress, was easily recognised by Harold as one of the Arab traders of the coast.  His men appeared to be half-castes.  The Arab nodded gravely, and said something which induced his men to lower their muskets.  Then with a wave of his hand he invited the strangers to come over the creek to him.  This was rendered possible by the breadth of the boat already mentioned being so great that, while one side touched the right bank of the creek, the other was within four or five feet of the left.  Without hesitation Harold Seadrift bounded lightly from the bank to the half-deck of the boat, and, stepping ashore, walked up to the Arab, closely followed by his companion.  \"Do you speak English?\" asked Harold.  The Arab shook his head and said, \"Arabic, Portuguese.\"  Harold therefore shook _his_ head;--then, with a hopeful look, said \"French?\" interrogatively.  The Arab repeated the shake of his head, but after a moments' thought said, \"I know littil Engleesh; speak, where comes you?\"  \"We have been wrecked,\" began Harold (the Arab glanced gravely at his dripping clothes, as if to say, I had guessed as much), \"and this man and I are the only survivors of the crew of our ship--at least the only two who swam on shore, the others went off in a boat.\"  \"Come you from man-of-war?\" asked the Arab, with a keen glance at the candid countenance of the youth.  \"No, our vessel was a trader bound for Zanzibar.  She now lies in fragments on the shore, and we have escaped with nothing but the clothes on our backs.  Can you tell us whether there is a town or a village in the neighbourhood? for, as you see, we stand sadly in need of clothing, food, and shelter.  We have no money, but we have good muscles and stout hearts, and could work our way well enough, I doubt not.\"  Young Seadrift said this modestly, but the remark was unnecessary, for it would have been quite obvious to a man of much less intelligence than the Arab that a youth who, although just entering on the age of manhood, was six feet high, deep-chested, broad-shouldered, and as lithe as a kitten, could not find any difficulty in working his way, while his companion, though a little older, was evidently quite as capable.  \"There be no town, no village, for fifty miles from where you stand,\" replied the Arab.  \"Indeed!\" exclaimed Harold in surprise, for he had always supposed the East African coast to be rather populous.  \"That's a blue look-out anyhow,\" observed Disco, \"for it necessitates starvation, unless this good gentleman will hire us to work his craft. It ain't very ship-shape to be sure, but anything of a seagoin' craft comes more or less handy to an old salt.\"  The trader listened with the politeness and profound gravity that seems to be characteristic of Orientals, but by no sign or expression showed whether he understood what was said.  \"_I_ go to Zanzibar,\" said he, turning to Harold, \"and will take you,-- so you wish.\"  There was something sinister in the man's manner which Harold did not like, but as he was destitute, besides being in the Arab's power, and utterly ignorant of the country, he thought it best to put a good face on matters, and therefore thanked him for his kind offer, and assured him that on reaching Zanzibar he would be in a position to pay for his passage as well as that of his friend.  \"May I ask,\" continued Harold, \"what your occupation is?\"  \"I am trader.\"  Harold thought he would venture another question:--  \"In what sort of goods do you trade?\"  \"Ivory.  Some be white, an' some be what your contrymans do call black.\"  \"Black!\" exclaimed Harold, in surprise.  \"Yees, black,\" replied the trader.  \"White ivory do come from the elephant--hims tusk; Black Ivory do come,\"--he smiled slightly at this point--\"from the land everywheres.  It bees our chef artikil of trade.\"  \"Indeed!  I never heard of it before.\"  \"No?\" replied the trader; \"you shall see it much here.  But I go talk with my mans.  Wait.\"  Saying this, in a tone which savoured somewhat unpleasantly of command, the Arab went towards a small hut near to which his men were standing, and entered into conversation with them.  It was evident that they were ill pleased with what he said at first for there was a good deal of remonstrance in their tones, while they pointed frequently in a certain direction which seemed to indicate the coast-line; but by degrees their tones changed, and they laughed and chuckled a good deal, as if greatly tickled by the speech of the Arab, who, however, maintained a look of dignified gravity all the time.  \"I don't like the looks o' them fellers,\" remarked Disco, after observing them in silence for some time.  \"They're a cut-throat set, I'm quite sure, an' if you'll take my"]]]
