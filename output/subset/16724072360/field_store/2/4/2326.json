What good could come of them? It cannot be denied that there were crimes perpetrated by men aspiring to a state of holy sanctity; there are instances to be met with of priests violating the rules of decorum and morality; of monks revelling in the dissipating pleasures of sensual enjoyments, and of nuns whose frail humanity could not maintain the purity of their virgin vows. But these instances are too rare to warrant the slanders and scurrility that historians have heaped upon them. And when we talk of the sensuality of the monks, of their gross indulgences and corporeal ease, we surely do so without discrimination; for when we speak of the middle ages thus, our thoughts are dwelling on the sixteenth century, its mocking piety and superstitious absurdity; but in the olden time of monastic rule, before monachism had burst its ancient boundaries, there was surely nothing physically attractive in the austere and dull monotony of a cloistered life. Look at the monk; mark his hard, dry studies, and his midnight prayers, his painful fasting and mortifying of the flesh; what can we find in this to tempt the epicure or the lover of indolence and sloth? They were fanatics, blind and credulous--I grant it. They read gross legends, and put faith in traditionary lies--I grant it; but do not say, for history will not prove it, that in the middle ages the monks were wine bibbers and slothful gluttons. But let not the Protestant reader be too hastily shocked. I am not defending the monastic system, or the corruption of the cloister--far from it. I would see the usefulness of man made manifest to the world; but the measure of my faith teaches charity and forgiveness, and I can find in the functions of the monk much that must have been useful in those dark days of feudal tyranny and lordly despotism. We much mistake the influence of the monks by mistaking their position; we regard them as a class, but forget from whence they sprang; there was nothing aristocratic about them, as their constituent parts sufficiently testify; they were, perhaps, the best representatives of the people that could be named, being derived from all classes of society. Thus Offa, the Saxon king, and CÃ¦dman, the rustic herdsman, were both monks. These are examples by no means rare, and could easily be multiplied. Such being the case, could not the monks more readily feel and sympathize with all, and more clearly discern the frailties of their brother man, and by kind admonition or stern reproof, mellow down the ferocity of a Saxon nature, or the proud heart of a Norman tyrant? But our object is not to analyze the social influence of Monachism in the middle ages: much might be said against it, and many evils traced to the sad workings of its evil spirit, but still withal something may be said in favor of it, and those who regard its influence in _those days alone_ may find more to admire and defend than they expected, or their Protestant prejudices like to own.  But, leaving these things, I have only to deal with such remains as relate to the love of books in those times. I would show the means then in existence of acquiring knowledge, the scarcity or plentitude of books, the extent of their libraries, and the rules regulating them; and bring forward those facts which tend to display the general routine of a literary monk, or the prevalence of Bibliomania in those days.  It is well known that the great national and private libraries of Europe possess immense collections of manuscripts, which were produced and transcribed in the monasteries, during the middle ages, thousands there are in the rich alcoves of the Vatican at Rome, unknown save to a choice and favored few; thousands there are in the royal library of France, and thousands too reposing on the dusty shelves of the Bodleian and Cottonian libraries in England; and yet, these numbers are but a small portion--a mere relic--of the intellectual productions of a past and obscure age.[7] The barbarians, who so frequently convulsed the more civilized portions of Europe, found a morbid pleasure in destroying those works which bore evidence to the mental superiority of their enemies. In England, the Saxons, the Danes, and the Normans were each successively the destroyers of literary productions. The Saxon Chronicle, that invaluable repository of the events of so many years, bears ample testimony to numerous instances of the loss of libraries and works of art, from fire, or by the malice of designing foes. At some periods, so general was this destruction, so unquenchable the rapacity of those who caused it, that instead of feeling surprised at the manuscripts of those ages being so few and scanty, we have cause rather to wonder that so many have been preserved. For even the numbers which escaped the hands of the early and unlettered barbarians met with an equally ignominious fate from those for whom it would be impossible to hold up the darkness of their age as a plausible excuse for the commission of this egregious folly. These men over whose sad deeds the bibliophile sighs with mournful regret, were those who carried out the Reformation, so glorious in its results; but the righteousness of the means by which those results were effected are very equivocal indeed. When men form themselves into a faction and strive for the accomplishment of one purpose, criminal deeds are perpetrated with impunity, which, individually they would blush and scorn to do; they feel no direct responsibility, no personal restraint; and, such as possess fierce passions, under the cloak of an organized body, give them vent and gratification; and those whose better feelings lead them to contemplate upon these things content themselves with the conclusion, that out of evil cometh good.  The noble art of printing was unable, with all its rapid movements, to rescue from destruction the treasures of the monkish age; the advocates of the Reformation eagerly sought for and as eagerly destroyed those old popish volumes, doubtless there was much folly, much exaggerated superstition pervading them; but there was also some truth, a few facts worth knowing, and perhaps a little true piety also, and it would have been no difficult matter to have discriminated between the good and the bad. But the careless grants of a licentious monarch conferred a monastery on a court favorite or political partizan without one thought for the preservation of its contents. It is true a few years after the dissolution of these houses, the industrious Leland was appointed to search and rummage over their libraries and to preserve any relic worthy of such an honor; but it was too late, less learned hands had rifled those parchment collections long ago, mutilated their finest volumes by cutting out with childish pleasure the illuminations with which they were adorned; tearing off the bindings for the gold claps which protected the treasures within,[8] and chopping up huge folios as fuel for their blazing hearths, and immense collections were sold as waste paper. Bale, a strenuous opponent of the monks, thus deplores the loss of their books: \"Never had we bene offended for the losse of our lybraryes beynge so many in nombre and in so desolate places for the moste parte, yf the chief monuments and moste notable workes of our excellent wryters had bene reserved, yf there had bene in every shyre of Englande but one solemyne library to the preservacyon of those noble workers, and preferrement of good learnynges in oure posteryte it had bene yet somewhat. But to destroye all without consyderacion, is and wyll be unto Englande for ever a most horryble infamy amonge the grave senyours of other nations. A grete nombre of them whych purchased those superstycyose mansyons reserved of those lybrarye bokes, some to serve theyr jakes, some to scoure theyr candelstyckes, and some to rubbe theyr bootes; some they solde to the grossers and sope sellers, and some they sent over see to the bokebynders,[9] not in small nombre, but at tymes _whole shippes ful_. I know a merchant man, whyche shall at thys tyme be nameless, that boughte the contents of two noble lybraryes for xl shyllyngs pryce, a shame is it to be spoken. Thys stuffe hathe he occupyed in the stide of graye paper for the space of more than these ten years, and yet hath store ynough for as many years to come. A prodyguose example is this, and to be abhorred of all men who love theyr natyon as they shoulde do.\"[10]  However pernicious the Roman religion might have been in its practice, it argues little to the honor of the reformers to have used such means as this to effect its cure; had they merely destroyed those productions connected with the controversies of the day, we might perhaps have excused it, on the score of party feeling; but those who were commissioned to visit the public libraries of the kingdom were often men of prejudiced intellects and shortsighted wisdom, and it frequently happened that an ignorant and excited mob became the executioners of whole collections.[11] It would be impossible now to estimate the loss. Manuscripts of ancient and classic date would in their hands receive no more respect than some dry husky folio on ecclesiastical policy; indeed, they often destroyed the works of their own party through sheer ignorance. In a letter sent by Dr. Cox to William Paget, Secretary, he writes that the proclamation for burning books had been the occasion of much hurt. \"For New Testaments and Bibles (not condemned by proclamation) have been burned, and that, out of parish churches and good men's houses. They have burned innumerable of the king's majesties books concerning our religion lately set forth.\"[12] The ignorant thus delighted to destroy that which they did not understand, and the factional spirit of the more enlightened would not allow them to make one effort for"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21632"],["title","Fame and Fortune; or, The Progress of Richard Hunter (#1)"],["body","I'm sure.\"  \"Because you haven't got any trunk except what you carry round with you.\"  \"We'll have to get trunks, or perhaps carpet-bags would do.\"  \"No,\" said Dick, decisively, \"it aint 'spectable to be without a trunk, and we're going to be 'spectable now.\"  \"_Re_spectable, Dick.\"  \"All right,--respectable, then. Let's go and buy each a trunk.\"  This advice seemed reasonable, and Fosdick made no objection. The boys succeeded in getting two decent trunks at three dollars apiece, and ordered them sent to their room in Mott Street. It must be remembered by my readers, who may regard the prices given as too low, that the events here recorded took place several years before the war, when one dollar was equal to two at the present day.  At the close of the afternoon Fosdick got away from the store an hour earlier, and the boys, preceded by an expressman bearing their trunks, went to their new home. They had just time to wash and comb their hair, when the bell rang for dinner, and they went down to the dining-room.  Nearly all the boarders were assembled, and were sitting around a long table spread with a variety of dishes. Mrs. Browning was a good manager, and was wise enough to set a table to which her boarders could not object.  \"This way, if you please, young gentlemen,\" she said, pointing to two adjoining seats on the opposite side of the table.  Our hero, it must be confessed, felt a little awkward, not being used to the formality of a boarding-house, and feeling that the eyes of twenty boarders were upon him. His confusion was increased, when, after taking his seat, he saw sitting opposite him, a young man whose boots he remembered to have blacked only a week before. Observing Dick's look, Mrs. Browning proceeded to introduce him to the other.  \"Mr. Clifton,\" she said, \"let me introduce Mr. Hunter and his friend, Mr. Fosdick,--two new members of our family.\"  Dick bowed rather awkwardly, and the young man said, \"Glad to make your acquaintance, Mr. Hunter. Your face looks quite familiar. I think I must have seen you before.\"  \"I think I've seen _you_ before,\" said Dick.  \"It's strange I can't think where,\" said the young man, who had not the least idea that the well-dressed boy before him was the boot-black who had brushed his boots near the Park railings the Monday previous. Dick did not think proper to enlighten him. He was not ashamed of his past occupation; but it was past, and he wanted to be valued for what he might become, not for what he had been.  \"Are you in business, Mr. Hunter?\" inquired Mr. Clifton.  It sounded strange to our hero to be called Mr. Hunter; but he rather liked it. He felt that it sounded respectable.  \"I am at Rockwell & Cooper's, on Pearl Street,\" said Dick.  \"I know the place. It is a large firm.\"  Dick was glad to hear it, but did not say that he knew nothing about it.  The dinner was a good one, much better than the two boys were accustomed to get at the eating-houses which in times past they had frequented. Dick noticed carefully how the others did, and acquitted himself quite creditably, so that no one probably suspected that he had not always been used to as good a table.  When the boys rose from the table, Mrs. Browning said, \"Won't you walk into the parlor, young gentlemen? We generally have a little music after dinner. Some of the young ladies are musical. Do either of you play?\"  Dick said he sometimes played marbles; at which a young lady laughed, and Dick, catching the infection, laughed too.  \"Miss Peyton, Mr. Hunter,\" introduced Mrs. Browning.  Miss Peyton made a sweeping courtesy, to which Dick responded by a bow, turning red with embarrassment.  \"Don't you sing, Mr. Hunter?\" asked the young lady.  \"I aint much on warblin',\" said Dick, forgetting for the moment where he was.  This droll answer, which Miss Peyton supposed to be intentionally funny, convulsed the young lady with merriment.  \"Perhaps your friend sings?\" she said.  Thereupon Fosdick was also introduced. To Dick's astonishment, he answered that he did a little. It was accordingly proposed that they should enter the next room, where there was a piano. The young lady played some well-known melodies, and Fosdick accompanied her with his voice, which proved to be quite sweet and melodious.  \"You are quite an acquisition to our circle,\" said Miss Peyton, graciously. \"Have you boarded in this neighborhood before?\"  \"No,\" said Fosdick; \"at another part of the city.\"  He was afraid she would ask him in what street, but fortunately she forbore.  In about half an hour the boys went up to their own room, where they lighted the gas, and, opening their trunks, placed the contents in the bureau-drawers.  \"Blessed if it don't seem strange,\" said Dick, \"for a feller brought up as I have been to live in this style. I wonder what Miss Peyton would have said if she had known what I had been.\"  \"You haven't any cause to be ashamed of it, Dick. It wasn't a very desirable business, but it was honest. Now you can do something better. You must adapt yourself to your new circumstances.\"  \"So I mean to,\" said Dick. \"I'm going in for respectability. When I get to be sixty years old, I'm goin' to wear gold spectacles and walk round this way, like the old gentlemen I see most every day on Wall Street.\"  Dick threw his head back, and began to walk round the room with a pompous step and an air of great importance.  \"I hope we'll both rise, Dick; we've got well started now, and there've been other boys, worse off than we are, who have worked hard, and risen to FAME AND FORTUNE.\"  \"We can try,\" said Dick. \"Now let us go out and have a walk.\"  \"All right,\" said Fosdick.  They went downstairs, and out into the street. Accustomed to the lower part of the city, there was a novelty in the evening aspect of Broadway, with its shops and theatres glittering with light. They sauntered carelessly along, looking in at the shop-windows, feeling more and more pleased with their change of location. All at once Dick's attention was drawn to a gentleman accompanied by a boy of about his own size, who was walking a little in advance.  \"Stop a minute,\" he said to Fosdick, and hurrying forward placed his hand on the boy's arm.  \"How are you, Frank?\" he said.  Frank Whitney, for it was he, turned in some surprise and looked at Dick, but did not at first recognize in the neat, well-dressed boy of fifteen the ragged boot-black he had encountered a year before.  \"I don't think I remember you,\" he said, surveying Dick with a puzzled expression.  \"Perhaps you'd remember me better if I had on my Washington coat and Napoleon pants,\" said our hero, with a smile. He felt rather pleased to find he was not recognized, since it was a compliment to his improved appearance.  \"What!\" exclaimed Frank, his face lighting up with pleasure, \"is it possible that you are--\"  \"Richard Hunter, at your service,\" said our hero; \"but when you knew me I was Ragged Dick.\"     CHAPTER II.  INTRODUCTION TO MERCANTILE LIFE.   Frank Whitney was indeed surprised to find the ragged boot-black of a year before so wonderfully changed. He grasped Dick's hand, and shook it heartily.  \"Uncle,\" he said, \"this is Dick. Isn't he changed?\"  \"It is a change I am glad to see,\" said Mr. Whitney, also extending his hand; \"for it appears to be a change for the better. And who is this other young man?\"  \"This is my private tutor,\" said Dick, presenting Fosdick,--\"Professor Fosdick. He's been teachin' me every evenin' for most a year. His terms is very reasonable. If it hadn't been for him, I never should have reached my present high position in literature and science.\"  \"I am glad to make your acquaintance, _Professor_ Fosdick,\" said Frank, laughing. \"May I inquire whether my friend Dick owes his elegant system of pronunciation to your instructions?\"  \"Dick can speak more correctly when he pleases,\" said Fosdick; \"but sometimes he falls back into his old way. He understands the common English branches very well.\"  \"Then he must have worked hard; for when I first met him a year ago, he was--\"  \"As ignorant as a horse,\" interrupted Dick. \"It was you that first made me ambitious, Frank. I wanted to be like you, and grow up 'spectable.\"  \"_Re_spectable, Dick,\" suggested Fosdick.  \"Yes, that's what I mean. I didn't always want to be a boot-black, so I worked hard, and with the help of Professor Fosdick, I've got up a little way. But I'm goin' to climb higher.\"  \"I am very glad to hear it, my young friend,\" said Mr. Whitney. \"It is always pleasant to see a young man fighting his way upward. In this free country there is every inducement for effort, however unpromising may be the early circumstances in which one is placed. But, young gentlemen, as my nephew would be glad to speak further with you, I propose that we adjourn from the sidewalk to the St. Nicholas Hotel, where I am at present stopping.\"  \"Yes, Dick,\" said Frank, \"you and Professor Fosdick must spend the evening with me. I was intending to visit some place of amusement, but would much prefer a visit from you.\"  Dick and Fosdick readily accepted this invitation, and turned in the direction of the St. Nicholas, which is situated on Broadway, below Bleecker Street.  \"By the way, Dick, where are your Washington coat and Napoleon pants now?\"  \"They were stolen from my room,\" said Dick, \"by somebody that wanted to appear on Broadway dressed in tip-top style, and hadn't got money enough to pay for a suit.\"  \"Perhaps it was some agent of Barnum who desired to secure the valuable relics,\" suggested Frank.  \"By gracious!\" said Dick, suddenly, \"there they are now. It's the first time I've seen 'em since they was stolen.\"  He pointed to a boy, of about his own size, who was coming up Broadway. He was attired in the well-remembered coat and pants; but, alas! time had not spared them. The solitary remaining coat-tail was torn in many places; of one sleeve but a fragment remained; grease and dirt nearly obliterated the original color; and it was a melancholy"]]]
