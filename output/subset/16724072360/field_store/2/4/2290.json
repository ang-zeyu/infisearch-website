Ah, then our hearts were bolder,   And if Dame Fortune frowned  Our swags we'd lightly shoulder   And tramp to other ground.  But golden days are vanished,   And altered is the scene;  The diggings are deserted,   The camping-grounds are green;  The flaunting flag of progress   Is in the West unfurled,  The mighty bush with iron rails   Is tethered to the world.     'For'ard'     It is stuffy in the steerage where the second-classers sleep,  For there's near a hundred for'ard, and they're stowed away like sheep, --  They are trav'lers for the most part in a straight 'n' honest path;  But their linen's rather scanty, an' there isn't any bath --  Stowed away like ewes and wethers that is shore 'n' marked 'n' draft.  But the shearers of the shearers always seem to travel aft;      In the cushioned cabins, aft,      With saloons 'n' smoke-rooms, aft --  There is sheets 'n' best of tucker for the first-salooners, aft.   Our beef is just like scrapin's from the inside of a hide,  And the spuds were pulled too early, for they're mostly green inside;  But from somewhere back amidships there's a smell o' cookin' waft,  An' I'd give my earthly prospects for a real good tuck-out aft --      Ham an' eggs 'n' coffee, aft,      Say, cold fowl for luncheon, aft,  Juicy grills an' toast 'n' cutlets -- tucker a-lor-frongsy, aft.   They feed our women sep'rate, an' they make a blessed fuss,  Just as if they couldn't trust 'em for to eat along with us!  Just because our hands are horny an' our hearts are rough with graft --  But the gentlemen and ladies always DINE together, aft --      With their ferns an' mirrors, aft,      With their flow'rs an' napkins, aft --  'I'll assist you to an orange' -- 'Kindly pass the sugar', aft.   We are shabby, rough, 'n' dirty, an' our feelin's out of tune,  An' it's hard on fellers for'ard that was used to go saloon;  There's a broken swell among us -- he is barracked, he is chaffed,  An' I wish at times, poor devil, for his own sake he was aft;      For they'd understand him, aft,      (He will miss the bath-rooms aft),  Spite of all there's no denyin' that there's finer feelin's aft.   Last night we watched the moonlight as it spread across the sea --  'It is hard to make a livin',' said the broken swell to me.  'There is ups an' downs,' I answered, an' a bitter laugh he laughed --  There were brighter days an' better when he always travelled aft --      With his rug an' gladstone, aft,      With his cap an' spyglass, aft --  A careless, rovin', gay young spark as always travelled aft.   There's a notice by the gangway, an' it seems to come amiss,  For it says that second-classers 'ain't allowed abaft o' this';  An' there ought to be a notice for the fellows from abaft --  But the smell an' dirt's a warnin' to the first-salooners, aft;      With their tooth and nail-brush, aft,      With their cuffs 'n' collars, aft --  Their cigars an' books an' papers, an' their cap-peaks fore-'n'-aft.   I want to breathe the mornin' breeze that blows against the boat,  For there's a swellin' in my heart -- a tightness in my throat --  We are for'ard when there's trouble!  We are for'ard when there's graft!  But the men who never battle always seem to travel aft;      With their dressin'-cases, aft,      With their swell pyjamas, aft --  Yes! the idle and the careless, they have ease an' comfort, aft.   I feel so low an' wretched, as I mooch about the deck,  That I'm ripe for jumpin' over -- an' I wish there was a wreck!  We are driven to New Zealand to be shot out over there --  Scarce a shillin' in our pockets, nor a decent rag to wear,  With the everlastin' worry lest we don't get into graft --  There is little left to land for if you cannot travel aft;      No anxiety abaft,      They have stuff to land with, aft --  Oh, there's little left to land for if you cannot travel aft;   But it's grand at sea this mornin', an' Creation almost speaks,  Sailin' past the Bay of Islands with its pinnacles an' peaks,  With the sunny haze all round us an' the white-caps on the blue,  An' the orphan rocks an' breakers -- Oh, it's glorious sailin' through!  To the south a distant steamer, to the west a coastin' craft,  An' we see the beauty for'ard, better than if we were aft;      Spite of op'ra-glasses, aft;      But, ah well, they're brothers aft --  Nature seems to draw us closer -- bring us nearer fore-'n'-aft.   What's the use of bein' bitter?  What's the use of gettin' mad?  What's the use of bein' narrer just because yer luck is bad?  What's the blessed use of frettin' like a child that wants the moon?  There is broken hearts an' trouble in the gilded first saloon!  We are used to bein' shabby -- we have got no overdraft --  We can laugh at troubles for'ard that they couldn't laugh at aft;      Spite o' pride an' tone abaft      (Keepin' up appearance, aft)  There's anxiety an' worry in the breezy cabins aft.   But the curse o' class distinctions from our shoulders shall be hurled,  An' the influence of woman revolutionize the world;  There'll be higher education for the toilin' starvin' clown,  An' the rich an' educated shall be educated down;  An' we all will meet amidships on this stout old earthly craft,  An' there won't be any friction 'twixt the classes fore-'n'-aft.      We'll be brothers, fore-'n'-aft!      Yes, an' sisters, fore-'n'-aft!  When the people work together, and there ain't no fore-'n'-aft.     The Drover's Sweetheart     An hour before the sun goes down   Behind the ragged boughs,  I go across the little run   And bring the dusty cows;  And once I used to sit and rest   Beneath the fading dome,  For there was one that I loved best   Who'd bring the cattle home.   Our yard is fixed with double bails,   Round one the grass is green,  The bush is growing through the rails,   The spike is rusted in;  And 'twas from there his freckled face   Would turn and smile at me --  He'd milk a dozen in the race   While I was milking three.   I milk eleven cows myself   Where once I milked but four;  I set the dishes on the shelf   And close the dairy door;  And when the glaring sunlight fails   And the fire shines through the cracks,  I climb the broken stockyard rails   And watch the bridle-tracks.   He kissed me twice and once again   And rode across the hill,  The pint-pots and the hobble-chain   I hear them jingling still;  He'll come at night or not at all --   He left in dust and heat,  And when the soft, cool shadows fall   Is the best time to meet.   And he is coming back again,   He wrote to let me know,  The floods were in the Darling then --   It seems so long ago;  He'd come through miles of slush and mud,   And it was weary work,  The creeks were bankers, and the flood   Was forty miles round Bourke.   He said the floods had formed a block,   The plains could not be crossed,  And there was foot-rot in the flock   And hundreds had been lost;  The sheep were falling thick and fast   A hundred miles from town,  And when he reached the line at last   He trucked the remnant down.   And so he'll have to stand the cost;   His luck was always bad,  Instead of making more, he lost   The money that he had;  And how he'll manage, heaven knows   (My eyes are getting dim),  He says -- he says -- he don't -- suppose   I'll want -- to -- marry -- him.   As if I wouldn't take his hand   Without a golden glove --  Oh! Jack, you men won't understand   How much a girl can love.  I long to see his face once more --   Jack's dog! thank God, it's Jack! --  (I never thought I'd faint before)   He's coming -- up -- the track.     Out Back     The old year went, and the new returned, in the withering weeks of drought,  The cheque was spent that the shearer earned,    and the sheds were all cut out;  The publican's words were short and few,    and the publican's looks were black --  And the time had come, as the shearer knew, to carry his swag Out Back.        For time means tucker, and tramp you must,         where the scrubs and plains are wide,       With seldom a track that a man can trust, or a mountain peak to guide;       All day long in the dust and heat -- when summer is on the track --       With stinted stomachs and blistered feet,         they carry their swags Out Back.   He tramped away from the shanty there, when the days were long and hot,  With never a soul to know or care if he died on the track or not.  The poor of the city have friends in woe, no matter how much they lack,  But only God and the swagmen know how a poor man fares Out Back.   He begged his way on the parched Paroo and the Warrego tracks once more,  And lived like a dog, as the swagmen do, till the Western stations shore;  But men were many, and sheds were full, for work in the town was slack --  The traveller never got hands in wool,    though he tramped for a year Out Back.   In stifling noons when his back was wrung    by its load, and the air seemed dead,  And the water warmed in the bag that hung to his aching arm like lead,  Or in times of flood, when plains were seas,    and the scrubs were cold and black,  He ploughed in mud to his trembling knees, and paid for his sins Out Back.   He blamed himself in the year 'Too Late' --    in the heaviest hours of life --  'Twas little he dreamed that a shearing-mate had care of his home and wife;  There are times when wrongs from your kindred come,    and treacherous tongues attack --  When a man is better away from home, and dead to the world, Out Back.   And dirty and careless and old he wore, as his lamp of hope grew dim;  He tramped for years till the swag he bore seemed part of himself to him.  As a bullock drags in the sandy ruts, he followed the dreary track,  With never a thought but to reach the huts when the sun went down Out Back.   It chanced one day, when the north wind blew    in his face like a furnace-breath,  He left the track for a tank he knew -- 'twas a short-cut to his death;"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21411"],["title","Holborn and Bloomsbury (#1)"],["body","about the site of the church. A few more buildings run along the north side of the present Broad Street. There are one or two at the north end of Drury Lane, and Drury House is at the south end. Southampton House, in the fields to the north, is marked, but the parish is otherwise open ground. In spite of many edicts to restrain the increase of houses, early in the reign of James I. the meadows began to be built upon, and, though a little checked during the Commonwealth, after the Restoration the building proceeded rapidly, stimulated by the new square at Lincoln's Inn Fields then being carried out by Inigo Jones. To St. Giles's may be attributed the distinction of having originated the Great Plague, which broke out in an alley at the north end of Drury Lane. Several times before this there had been smaller outbreaks, which had resulted in the building of a pest-house. Even after this check the parish continued to increase rapidly, and by the early part of the last century was a byword for all that was squalid and filthy. Its rookeries and slums are thus described in a newspaper cutting of 1845: \"All around are poverty and wretchedness; the streets and alleys are rank with the filth of half a century; the windows are half of them broken, or patched with rags and paper, and when whole are begrimed with dirt and smoke; little brokers' shops abound, filled with lumber, the odour of which taints even that tainted atmosphere; the pavement and carriage-way swarm with pigs, poultry, and ragged children.... But in the space called the Dials itself the scene is far different. There at least rise splendid buildings with stuccoed fronts and richly-ornamented balustrades.... These are the gin-palaces.\" Naturally, among so much poverty gin-palaces and public-houses abounded. It is curious to note how many of Hogarth's pictures of misery and vice were drawn from St. Giles's. \"Noon\" has St. Giles's Church in the background, while his \"Gin Lane\" shows the neighbouring church of St. George, Bloomsbury; the scene of his \"Harlot's Progress\" is Drury Lane, and the idle apprentice is caught when wanted for murder in a cellar in St. Giles's.  The gallows were in this parish from about 1413 until they were removed to Tyburn, and then the terrible Tyburn procession passed through St. Giles's, and halted at the great gate of the hospital, and later at the public-house called The Bowl, described more fully hereafter. From very early times St. Giles's was notorious for its taverns. The Croche Hose (Crossed Stockings), another tavern, was situated at the corner of the marshlands, and in Edward I.'s reign belonged to the cook of the hospital; the crossed stockings, red and white, were adopted as the sign of the hosiers. Besides these, there were numerous other taverns dating from many years back, including the Swan on the Hop, Holborn; White Hart, north-east of Drury Lane; the Rose, already mentioned. In the parish also were various houses of entertainment, of which the most notorious was the Hare and Hounds, formerly Beggar in the Bush, which was kept by one Joe Banks in 1844, and was the resort of all classes. This was in Buckridge Street, over which New Oxford Street now runs. In the last sixty years the face of the parish has been greatly changed. The first demolition of a rookery of vice and squalor took place in 1840, when New Oxford Street was driven through Slumland. Dyott (once George) Street, Church Lane, Buckridge and Bainbridge, Charlotte and Plumtree, were among the most notorious streets thus wholly or partially removed.  In 1844 many wretched houses were demolished, and in 1855 Shaftesbury Avenue drove another wedge into the slums to let in light and air. There are poor and wretched courts in St. Giles's yet, but civilization is making its softening influence felt even here, and though cases of Hooliganism in broad daylight still occur, they are less and less frequent.  So much for a brief history of the parish. Its soil was from very early times damp and marshy. To the south of the hospital was a stretch of ground called Marshlands, probably at one time a pond. Great ditches and fosses cut up the ground. The most important of these was Blemund's Ditch, which divided the parish from that of Bloomsbury. This is supposed to have been an ancient line of fortification. Besides this, a ditch traversed the marshlands above mentioned, another encompassed the croft lying by the north gate of the hospital, and there were several others of less importance.  The Hospital of St. Giles was the earliest foundation of its kind in London, if we except St. James's Hospital. Stow sums it up thus: \"St. Giles-in-the-Fields was an hospital for leprous people out of the City of London and shire of Middlesex, founded by Matilde the Queen, wife to Henry I., and suppressed by King Henry VIII.\" The date of foundation is given by Leland and Malcolm as 1101, though Stow and others give 1117, which was the year before the foundress died. Before this time this part of London had apparently been included in the great estate of Rugmere, which belonged to St. Paul's.  Matilda gave the ground, and endowed the hospital with the magnificent sum of £3 per annum! Her foundation provided for forty lepers, one chaplain, one clerk, and one servant. Henry II. confirmed all privileges and gifts which had accrued to the hospital, and added to them himself. Parton says, \"His liberality ranks him as a second founder.\" During succeeding reigns the hospital grew in wealth and importance. In Henry III.'s reign Pope Alexander issued a confirmatory Bull, but the charity had become a refuge for decayed hangers-on at Court who were not lepers. This abuse was prohibited by the King's decree. In Edward III.'s reign the first downward step was taken, for he made the hospital a cell to Burton St. Lazar. The brethren apparently rebelled, refusing to admit the visitation of the Archbishop of Canterbury, and destroying many valuable documents and records belonging to the hospital. Two centuries later King Henry VIII. desired the lands and possessions of St. Giles's, and with him to desire was to acquire.  The hospital was thus shorn of the greater part of its wealth, retaining only the church (not the manor) at Feltham (one of its earliest gifts), the hospital estates at Edmonton, in the City of London, and in the various parishes in the suburbs; and in St. Giles's parish the actual ground it stood on, the Pittance Croft, and a few minor places. But even this remnant came into the possession of the rapacious King two years later, at the dissolution of the monasteries, when Burton St. Lazar itself fell into the tyrant's hands. Henry held these for six years, then granted both to John Dudley, Viscount Lisle, Lord High Admiral. From the time of the dissolution the hospital became a manor.  In the earliest charters the head of the hospital is styled Chaplain, but not Master. The first Master mentioned is in 1212, and after this the title was regularly used. The government was vested in the Master or Warden and other officers, together with a certain number of sound brethren and sisters--and in certain cases lepers themselves--who formed a chapter. \"They assembled in chapter, had a common seal, held courts as lords of the manor.\"[1] There were also guardians or custodians, who did not reside in the precincts of the hospital, and these seem to have been chosen from the most eminent citizens; they formed no part of the original scheme.  [1] \"Some Account of the Hospital and Parish of St. Giles-in-the-Fields,\" 1822, by John Parton.  [Illustration: SEAL OF ST. GILES'S HOSPITAL.]  The sisters appear to have been nurses, for there is no mention made of any leprous sister. The chapel of the hospital appears from King Henry II.'s charter to have been built on the site of some older parochial church. The Bull of Pope Alexander mentions that the hospital wall enclosed eight acres. Within this triangular space, which is at present roughly bounded by the High Street, Charing Cross Road, and Shaftesbury Avenue, was one central building or mansion for the lepers, several subordinate buildings, the chapel, and the gate-house. Whether the number of lepers was reduced when the hospital possessions were curtailed we are not told. After the hospital buildings fell into the hands of Lord Dudley they underwent many changes. The principal building he converted into a mansion for his own use; this was the manor-house. It stood between the present Denmark Street and Lloyd's Court, and its site is occupied by a manufactory. After two years Lord Dudley obtained from the King license to transfer all his newly-gained estates to Sir Wymonde Carew, but there seems reason to suppose that Lord Dudley remained in possession of the manor-house until his attainder in the reign of Queen Mary, because the manor then reverted to the Crown, and was regranted. Clinch gets out of this difficulty by supposing Lord Dudley to have parted with his estates and retained the manor, but in the deed of license for exchange all his \"mansion place and capital house, late the house of the dissolved hospital of St. Giles in the Fields,\" is especially mentioned. It is possible that Sir Wymonde leased it again to the Dudley family.  Among the many subsequent holders of the manor we find the name of Sir Walter Cope, who bought the Manor of Kensington in 1612, and through whose only child, Isabel, it passed by marriage to Sir Henry Rich, created Earl of Holland. The Manor of St. Giles was in the possession of the Crown again in Charles II.'s reign, when Alice Leigh, created by him Duchess of Dudley, lived in the manor-house. This Duchess made many gifts to the church, among which was a rectory-house.  The Church of St. Giles at present standing is certainly the third, if not the fourth, which has been upon the same site. As mentioned above, there is reason to believe from Henry II.'s charter that a sacred building of some sort stood here"]]]
