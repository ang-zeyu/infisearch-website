He has continued to send me a little every year since then;--ah! it's many, many years now,--ay, ay, many years.\"  She sighed, and looked wistfully at the spark of fire in the grate that was making ineffectual attempts to boil the little tea-kettle with the defiant spout; \"but why,\" she continued, looking up suddenly, \"why do you ask about him?\"  \"Because I knew him,\" replied Captain Wopper, searching for something which appeared to be lost in the depths of one of his capacious pockets. \"Willum Stout was a chum of mine.  We worked together at the Californy gold-mines for many a year as partners, and, when at last we'd made what we thought enough, we gave it up an' came down to San Francisco together, an' set up a hotel, under the name of the `Jolly Tars,' by Stout and Company.  I was the Company, ma'am; an', for the matter o' that I may say I was the Stout too, for both of us answered to the Stout or the Company, accordin' as we was addressed, d'ee see?  When Company thought he'd made enough money to entitle him to a holiday, he came home, as you see; but before leavin', Willum said to him, `Company, my lad, w'en you get home, you'll go and see that old 'oom of the name of Roby, whom I've often told you about.  She lives in Lunun, somewheres down by the river in a place called Grubb's Court.  She was very good to me, that old 'oom was, when she was young, as I've told you before.  You go an' give her my blessin'--Willum's blessin'--and this here bag and that there letter.'  `Yes,' says I, `Willum, I'll do it, my boy, as soon as ever I set futt on British soil.'  I did set futt on British soil this morning, and there's the letter; also the bag; so, you see, old lady, I've kep' my promise.\"  Captain Wopper concluded by placing a small but heavy canvas bag, and a much-soiled letter, in Mrs Roby's lap.  To say that the little old woman seized the letter with eager delight, would convey but a faint idea of her feelings as she opened it with trembling hands, and read it with her bright black eyes.  She read it half aloud, mingled with commentary, as she proceeded, and once or twice came to a pause over an illegible word, on which occasions her visitor helped her to the word without looking at the letter.  This circumstance struck her at last as somewhat singular, for she looked up suddenly, and said, \"You appear, sir, to be familiar with the contents of my letter.\"  \"That's true, ma'am,\" replied Captain Wopper, who had been regarding the old woman with a benignant smile; \"Willum read it to me before I left, a-purpose to enable me to translate the ill-made pot-hooks and hangers, because, d'ee see, we were more used to handlin' the pick and shovel out there than the pen, an' Willum used to say he never was much of a dab at a letter.  He never wrote you very long ones, ma'am, I believe?\"  Mrs Roby looked at the fire pensively, and said, in a low voice, as if to herself rather than her visitor, \"No, they were not long--never very long--but always kind and sweet to me--very sweet--ay, ay, it's a long, long time now, a long time, since he came to me here and asked for a night's lodging.\"  \"Did you give it him, ma'am?\" asked the captain.  \"Give it him!\" exclaimed Mrs Roby, with sudden energy, \"of course I did.  The poor boy was nigh starving.  How could I refuse him?  It is true I had not much to give, for the family I was with as nuss had failed and left me in great distress, through my savings bein' in their hands; and that's what brought me to this little room long, long ago--ay, ay.  But no blame to the family, sir, no blame at all.  They couldn't help failin', an' the young ones, when they grew up, did not forget their old nuss, though they ain't rich, far from it; and it's what they give me that enables me to pay my rent and stay on here--God bless 'em.\"  She looked affectionately at the daguerreotypes which hung, in the midst of the sheen and glory of pot-lids, beads, and looking-glasses, above the chimney-piece.  \"You gave him, meanin' Willum, nothing else, I suppose?\" asked the captain, with a knowing look; \"such, for instance, as a noo suit of clothes, because of his bein' so uncommon ragged that he looked as if he had bin captured in a clumsy sort of net that it would not have been difficult to break through and escape from naked; also a few shillin's, bein' your last, to pay his way down to Gravesend, where the ship was lyin', that you had, through interest with the owners, got him a berth aboard?\"  \"Ah!\" returned Mrs Roby, shaking her head and smiling gently, \"I see that William has told you all about it.\"  \"He has, ma'am,\" replied Captain Wopper, with a decisive nod.  \"You see, out in the gold-fields of Californy, we had long nights together in our tent, with nothin' to do but smoke our pipes, eat our grub, and spin yarns, for we had no books nor papers, nothin' to read except a noo Testament, and we wouldn't have had even that, ma'am, but for yourself. It was the Testament you gave to Willum at partin', an' very fond of it he was, bein' your gift.  You see, at the time we went to Californy, there warn't many of us as cared for the Word of God.  Most of us was idolaters that had run away from home, our chief gods--for we had many of 'em--bein' named Adventure, Excitement and Gold; though there was some noble exceptions, too.  But, as I was saying, we had so much time on our hands that we recalled all our past adventures together over and over again, and, you may be sure, ma'am, that your name and kindness was not forgotten.  There was another name,\" continued Captain Wopper, drawing his chair nearer the fire, crossing his legs and stroking his beard as he looked up at the dingy ceiling, \"that Willum often thought about and spoke of.  It was the name of a gentleman, a clerk in the Customs, I believe, who saved his life one day when he fell into the river just below the bridge.\"  \"Mr Lawrence,\" said the old woman, promptly.  \"Ah!  Mr Lawrence; yes, that's the name,\" continued the Captain. \"Willum was very grateful to him, and bid me try to find him out and tell him so.  Is he alive?\"  \"Dead,\" said Mrs Roby, shaking her head sadly.  The seaman appeared much concerned on hearing this.  For some time he did not speak, and then said that he had been greatly interested in that gentleman through Willum's account of him.  \"Had he left any children?\"  \"Yes,\" Mrs Roby told him; \"one son, who had been educated as a doctor, and had become a sort of a city missionary, and was as pleasant a young gentleman as she ever knew.\"  \"So, then, you know him?\" said the Captain.  \"Know him!  I should think so.  Why, this is the district where he visits, and a kind friend he is to the poor, though he _is_ bashful a bit, an' seems to shrink from pushin' himself where he's not wanted.\"  \"Not the less a friend to the poor on that account,\" thought Captain Wopper; but he said nothing, and Mrs Roby went on:--  \"You see, his father before him did a great deal for the poor in a quiet way here, as I have reason to know, this district lying near his office, and handy, as it were.  Long after the time when he saved Willum's life, he married a sweet young creeter, who helped him in visitin' the poor, but she caught fever among 'em and died, when their only son George was about ten year old.  George had been goin' about with his mother on her visits, and seemed very fond of her and of the people, dear child; and after she died, he used to continue coming with his father.  Then he went to school and college and became a young doctor, and only last year he came back to us, so changed for the better that none of us would have known him but for his kindly voice and fine manly-looking manner.  His shyness, too, has stuck to him a little, but it does not seem to hinder him now as it once did.  Ah!\" continued Mrs Roby, in a sympathetic tone, \"it's a great misfortune to be shy.\"  She looked pensively at the little fire and shook her tall cap at it, as if it or the defiant tea-kettle were answerable for something in reference to shyness.  \"Yes, it's a great misfortune to be shy,\" she repeated.  \"Were you ever troubled with that complaint, Captain Wopper?\"  The Captain's moustache curled at the corners as he stroked his beard, and said that really, on consideration, he was free to confess that he never had been convicted of that sin.  Mrs Roby bestowed on him a look of admiration, and continued, \"Well, as I have said--\"  She was interrupted at this point by the entrance of an active little girl, with the dirtiest face and sweetest expression imaginable, with garments excessively ragged, blue eyes that sparkled as they looked at you, a mouth that seemed made for kissing, if only it had been clean, and golden hair that would have fallen in clustering curls on her neck, if it had not been allowed to twist itself into something like a yellow door-mat which rendered a bonnet unnecessary.  Bestowing a glance of surprise on the seaman, but without uttering a word, she went smartly to a corner and drew into the middle of the room a round table with one leg and three feet, whose accommodating top having been previously flat against the wall, fell down horizontal and fixed itself with a snap.  On this the earnest little woman, quickly and neatly, spread a fairish linen cloth, and proceeded to arrange thereon a small tea-pot and cup and saucer, with other materials, for an early tea.  \"Two cups, Netta, my dear,\" said Mrs Roby.  \"Yes, grannie,\" replied Netta, in a soft quick, little voice.  \"Your grandchild?\" asked the Captain.  \"No; a neighbour's child, who is very kind to me.  She calls me grannie, because I like it.  But, as I was saying,\" continued Mrs Roby, \"young Dr Lawrence came back last year and began to visit us in the old way, intending to continue, he said, until he got a situation of some sort in the colonies, I believe; but I do hope he'll not be obliged "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21699"],["title","The Rover of the Andes: A Tale of Adventure on South America (#1)"],["body","Indian girl, who, during the foregoing conversation, had remained motionless on her mule with her eyes looking pensively at the ground, like a beautiful statue in bronze.  \"My home is close at hand,\" said the Englishman, when the question had been repeated; \"unless memory plays me false, two more turns in the road will reveal it.\"  The earnest look of the Peruvian deepened as he asked if the Estate of Passamanka was his home.  \"Yes, you know it, then?\" exclaimed the youth eagerly; \"and perhaps you knew my father too?\"  \"Yes, indeed; there are few people within a hundred miles of the place who did not know the famous sugar-mill and its hospitable owner, Senhor Armstrong.  But excuse me,\" added the Peruvian, with some hesitation, \"you are aware, I suppose, that your father is dead?\"  \"Ay, well do I know that,\" returned the other in a deeper tone.  \"It is to take my father's place at the mills that I have been hastily summoned from England.  Alas!  I know nothing of the work, and it will be sorely against the grain to attempt the carrying on of the old business in the desolate old home.\"  \"Of course you also know,\" continued the Peruvian, \"that the country is disturbed just now--that the old smouldering enmity between Chili and Peru has broken forth again in open war.\"  \"I could not have passed through the low country without finding that out.  Indeed,\" said the youth, glancing at his belt with a half-apologetic smile, \"these weapons, which are so unfamiliar to my hand, and so distasteful to my spirit, are proof that I, at least, do not look for a time of peace.  I accoutred myself thus on landing, at the urgent advice of a friend, though my good cudgel--which has sufficed for all my needs hitherto--is more to my mind, besides being useful as a mountain staff.  But why do you ask?  Is there much probability of the belligerents coming so far among the hills?\"  \"Wherever carrion is to be found, there you may be sure the vultures will congregate.  There is booty to be got here among the hills; and whether the soldiers belong to the well-trained battalions of Chili, or the wretched levies of Peru, they are always prepared, for plunder-- ready to make hay while the sun shines.  I only hope, Senhor Armstrong, that--but come, let us advance and see before the sun sets.\"  Turning abruptly as he spoke, the man mounted his mule and rode briskly up the winding road, followed by the Indian girl and our Englishman.  At the second turning of the road they reached a spot where an opening in the hills revealed the level country below, stretching away into illimitable distance.  As had been anticipated, they here came upon the mills they were in quest of.  The Peruvian reined up abruptly and looked back.  \"I feared as much,\" he said in a low tone as the Englishman rode forward.  Rendered anxious by the man's manner, Lawrence Armstrong sprang from his mule and pushed forward, but suddenly stopped and stood with clasped hands and a gaze of agony.  For there stood the ruins of his early home--where his mother had died while he was yet a child, where his father had made a fortune, which, in his desolation, he had failed to enjoy, and where he finally died, leaving his possessions to his only child.  The troops had visited the spot, fired no doubt with patriotic fervour and knowing its owner to be wealthy.  They had sacked the place, feasted on the provisions, drunk the wines, smashed up, by way of pleasantry, all the valuables that were too heavy to carry away, and, finally, setting fire to the place, had marched off to other fields of \"glory.\"  It was a tremendous blow to poor Lawrence, coming as he did fresh from college in a peaceful land, and full of the reminiscences of childhood.  Sitting down on a broken wall, he bowed his head and wept bitterly-- though silently--while the Peruvian, quietly retiring with the Indian girl, left him alone.  The first paroxysm of grief over, young Armstrong rose, and began sadly to wander about the ruins.  It had been an extensive structure, fitted with all the most approved appliances of mechanism which wealth could purchase.  These now helped to enhance the wild aspect of the wreck, for iron girders had been twisted by the action of fire into snake-like convolutions in some places, while, in others, their ends stuck out fantastically from the blackened walls.  Beautiful furniture had been smashed up to furnish firewood for the cooking of the meal with which the heroic troops had refreshed themselves before leaving, while a number of broken wine-bottles at the side of a rosewood writing-desk with an empty bottle on the top of it and heaps of stones and pebbles around, suggested the idea that the warriors had mingled light amusement with sterner business.  The roofs of most of the buildings had fallen in; the window-frames, where spared by the fire, had been torn out; and a pianoforte, which lay on its back on the grass, showed evidence of having undergone an examination of its internal arrangements, with the aid of the butt-ends of muskets.  \"And this is the result of war!\" muttered the young man, at last breaking silence.  \"Only one phase of it,\" replied a voice at his side, in tones of exceeding bitterness; \"you must imagine a few corpses of slaughtered men and women and children, if you would have a perfect picture of war.\"  The speaker was the Peruvian, who had quietly approached to say that if they wished to reach the next resting-place before dark it was necessary to proceed without delay.  \"But perhaps,\" he added, \"you do not intend to go further.  No doubt this was to have been the end of your journey had all been well.  It can scarcely, I fear, be the end of it now.  I do not wish to intrude upon your sorrows, Mr Armstrong, but my business will not admit of delay.  I must push on, yet I would not do so without expressing my profound sympathy, and offering to aid you if it lies in my power.\"  There was a tone and look about the man which awoke a feeling of gratitude and confidence in the forlorn youth's heart.  \"You are very kind,\" he said, \"but it is not in the power of man to help me.  As your business is urgent you had better go and leave me.  I thank you for the sympathy you express--yet stay.  You cannot advance much further to-night, why not encamp here?  There used to be a small hut or out-house not far-off, in which my father spent much of his leisure. Perhaps the--the--\"  \"Patriots!\" suggested the Peruvian.  \"The scoundrels,\" said Lawrence, \"may have spared or overlooked it.  The hut would furnish shelter enough, and we have provisions with us.\"  After a moment's reflection the Peruvian assented to this proposal, and, leaving the ruins together, they returned to the road, where they found the Indian girl holding the youth's mule as well as that of her companion.  Hastening forward, Lawrence apologised for having in the agitation of the moment allowed his mule to run loose.  \"But I forgot,\" he added, \"of course you do not understand English.\"  \"Try Spanish,\" suggested the Peruvian, \"she knows a little of that.\"  \"Unfortunately I have forgotten the little that I had picked up here when a boy,\" returned Lawrence, as he mounted, \"if I can manage to ask for food and lodging in that tongue, it is all that I can do.\"  They soon reached an opening in the bushes at the roadside, and, at the further end of a natural glade or track, observed a small wooden hut thatched with rushes.  Towards this young Armstrong led the way.  He was evidently much affected, for his lips were compressed, and he gave no heed to a remark made by his companion.  Entering the hut, he stood for some time looking silently round.  It was but a poor place with bare walls; a carpenter's bench in one corner, near to it a smith's forge, one or two chairs, and a few tools;--not much to interest a stranger but to Lawrence full of tender associations.  \"It was here,\" he said in tones of deepest pathos, \"that my father showed me how to handle tools, and my mother taught me to read from the Word of God.\"  Looking at his companions he observed that the large dark eyes of the Indian girl were fixed on him with an expression of unmistakable sympathy.  He felt grateful at the moment, for to most men sympathy is sweet when unobtrusively offered whether it come from rich or poor-- civilised or savage.  \"Come, this will do,\" said the Peruvian, looking round, \"if you will kindle a fire on the forge, Senhor Armstrong, Manuela will arrange a sleeping chamber for herself in the closet I see there, while I look after the beasts.\"  He spoke in cheering tones, which had the effect of rousing the poor youth somewhat from his despondency.  \"Well, then,\" he replied, \"let us to work, and it is but just, as we are to sup together, and you know my name, that I should be put on an equal footing with yourself--\"  \"Impossible!\" interrupted the other, with a slight curl of his moustache, \"for as I am only six feet one, and you are at least six feet four, we can never be on an equal footing.\"  \"Nay, but I referred to names, not to inches.  Pray, by what name shall I call you?\"  \"Pedro,\" returned the Spaniard.  \"I am known by several names in these parts--some of them complimentary, others the reverse, according as I am referred to by friends or foes.  Men often speak of me as a confirmed rover because of my wandering tendencies, but I'm not particular and will answer to any name you choose, so long as it is politely uttered. The one I prefer is Pedro.\"  He went out as he spoke to look after the mules, while Lawrence set about kindling a small fire and otherwise making preparations for supper.  The Indian girl, Manuela, with that prompt and humble obedience characteristic of the race to which she belonged, had gone at once into the little closet which her companion had pointed out, and was by that time busily arranging it as a sleeping chamber for the night.
