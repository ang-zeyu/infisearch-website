But he's old -- and his eyes are grown hollow;      Like me, with my thatch of the snow;    When he dies, then I hope I may follow,     And go where the racehorses go.    I don't want no harping nor singing --     Such things with my style don't agree;    Where the hoofs of the horses are ringing     There's music sufficient for me.     And surely the thoroughbred horses     Will rise up again and begin    Fresh races on far-away courses,     And p'raps they might let me slip in.    It would look rather well the race-card on     'Mongst Cherubs and Seraphs and things,    'Angel Harrison's black gelding Pardon,     Blue halo, white body and wings.'     And if they have racing hereafter,     (And who is to say they will not?)    When the cheers and the shouting and laughter     Proclaim that the battle grows hot;    As they come down the racecourse a-steering,     He'll rush to the front, I believe;    And you'll hear the great multitude cheering     For Pardon, the son of Reprieve.     Clancy of the Overflow       I had written him a letter which I had, for want of better     Knowledge, sent to where I met him down the Lachlan, years ago,    He was shearing when I knew him, so I sent the letter to him,     Just 'on spec', addressed as follows, 'Clancy, of The Overflow'.     And an answer came directed in a writing unexpected,     (And I think the same was written with a thumb-nail dipped in tar)    'Twas his shearing mate who wrote it, and verbatim I will quote it:     'Clancy's gone to Queensland droving, and we don't know where he are.'         .   .   .   .   .     In my wild erratic fancy visions come to me of Clancy     Gone a-droving 'down the Cooper' where the Western drovers go;    As the stock are slowly stringing, Clancy rides behind them singing,     For the drover's life has pleasures that the townsfolk never know.     And the bush hath friends to meet him, and their kindly voices greet him     In the murmur of the breezes and the river on its bars,    And he sees the vision splendid of the sunlit plains extended,     And at night the wond'rous glory of the everlasting stars.         .   .   .   .   .     I am sitting in my dingy little office, where a stingy     Ray of sunlight struggles feebly down between the houses tall,    And the foetid air and gritty of the dusty, dirty city     Through the open window floating, spreads its foulness over all     And in place of lowing cattle, I can hear the fiendish rattle     Of the tramways and the 'buses making hurry down the street,    And the language uninviting of the gutter children fighting,     Comes fitfully and faintly through the ceaseless tramp of feet.     And the hurrying people daunt me, and their pallid faces haunt me     As they shoulder one another in their rush and nervous haste,    With their eager eyes and greedy, and their stunted forms and weedy,     For townsfolk have no time to grow, they have no time to waste.     And I somehow rather fancy that I'd like to change with Clancy,     Like to take a turn at droving where the seasons come and go,    While he faced the round eternal of the cash-book and the journal --     But I doubt he'd suit the office, Clancy, of 'The Overflow'.     Conroy's Gap       This was the way of it, don't you know --     Ryan was 'wanted' for stealing sheep,    And never a trooper, high or low,     Could find him -- catch a weasel asleep!    Till Trooper Scott, from the Stockman's Ford --     A bushman, too, as I've heard them tell --    Chanced to find him drunk as a lord     Round at the Shadow of Death Hotel.     D'you know the place?  It's a wayside inn,     A low grog-shanty -- a bushman trap,    Hiding away in its shame and sin     Under the shelter of Conroy's Gap --    Under the shade of that frowning range,     The roughest crowd that ever drew breath --    Thieves and rowdies, uncouth and strange,     Were mustered round at the Shadow of Death.     The trooper knew that his man would slide     Like a dingo pup, if he saw the chance;    And with half a start on the mountain side     Ryan would lead him a merry dance.    Drunk as he was when the trooper came,     To him that did not matter a rap --    Drunk or sober, he was the same,     The boldest rider in Conroy's Gap.     'I want you, Ryan,' the trooper said,     'And listen to me, if you dare resist,    So help me heaven, I'll shoot you dead!'     He snapped the steel on his prisoner's wrist,    And Ryan, hearing the handcuffs click,     Recovered his wits as they turned to go,    For fright will sober a man as quick     As all the drugs that the doctors know.     There was a girl in that rough bar     Went by the name of Kate Carew,    Quiet and shy as the bush girls are,     But ready-witted and plucky, too.    She loved this Ryan, or so they say,     And passing by, while her eyes were dim    With tears, she said in a careless way,     'The Swagman's round in the stable, Jim.'     Spoken too low for the trooper's ear,     Why should she care if he heard or not?    Plenty of swagmen far and near,     And yet to Ryan it meant a lot.    That was the name of the grandest horse     In all the district from east to west    In every show ring, on every course     They always counted the Swagman best.     He was a wonder, a raking bay --     One of the grand old Snowdon strain --    One of the sort that could race and stay     With his mighty limbs and his length of rein.    Born and bred on the mountain side,     He could race through scrub like a kangaroo,    The girl herself on his back might ride,     And the Swagman would carry her safely through.     He would travel gaily from daylight's flush     Till after the stars hung out their lamps,    There was never his like in the open bush,     And never his match on the cattle-camps.    For faster horses might well be found     On racing tracks, or a plain's extent,    But few, if any, on broken ground     Could see the way that the Swagman went.     When this girl's father, old Jim Carew,     Was droving out on the Castlereagh    With Conroy's cattle, a wire came through     To say that his wife couldn't live the day.    And he was a hundred miles from home,     As flies the crow, with never a track,    Through plains as pathless as ocean's foam,     He mounted straight on the Swagman's back.     He left the camp by the sundown light,     And the settlers out on the Marthaguy    Awoke and heard, in the dead of night,     A single horseman hurrying by.    He crossed the Bogan at Dandaloo,     And many a mile of the silent plain    That lonely rider behind him threw     Before they settled to sleep again.     He rode all night and he steered his course     By the shining stars with a bushman's skill,    And every time that he pressed his horse     The Swagman answered him gamely still.    He neared his home as the east was bright,     The doctor met him outside the town:    'Carew!  How far did you come last night?'     'A hundred miles since the sun went down.'     And his wife got round, and an oath he passed,     So long as he or one of his breed    Could raise a coin, though it took their last     The Swagman never should want a feed.    And Kate Carew, when her father died,     She kept the horse and she kept him well:    The pride of the district far and wide,     He lived in style at the bush hotel.     Such was the Swagman; and Ryan knew     Nothing about could pace the crack;    Little he'd care for the man in blue     If once he got on the Swagman's back.    But how to do it?  A word let fall     Gave him the hint as the girl passed by;    Nothing but 'Swagman -- stable-wall;     'Go to the stable and mind your eye.'     He caught her meaning, and quickly turned     To the trooper:  'Reckon you'll gain a stripe    By arresting me, and it's easily earned;     Let's go to the stable and get my pipe,    The Swagman has it.'  So off they went,     And soon as ever they turned their backs    The girl slipped down, on some errand bent     Behind the stable, and seized an axe.     The trooper stood at the stable door     While Ryan went in quite cool and slow,    And then (the trick had been played before)     The girl outside gave the wall a blow.    Three slabs fell out of the stable wall --     'Twas done 'fore ever the trooper knew --    And Ryan, as soon as he saw them fall,     Mounted the Swagman and rushed him through.     The trooper heard the hoof-beats ring     In the stable yard, and he slammed the gate,    But the Swagman rose with a mighty spring     At the fence, and the trooper fired too late,    As they raced away and his shots flew wide     And Ryan no longer need care a rap,    For never a horse that was lapped in hide     Could catch the Swagman in Conroy's Gap.     And that's the story.  You want to know     If Ryan came back to his Kate Carew;    Of course he should have, as stories go,     But the worst of it is, this story's true:    And in real life it's a certain rule,     Whatever poets and authors say    Of high-toned robbers and all their school,     These horsethief fellows aren't built that way.     Come back!  Don't hope it -- the slinking hound,     He sloped across to the Queensland side,    And sold the Swagman for fifty pound,     And stole the money, and more beside.    And took to drink, and by some good chance     Was killed -- thrown out of a stolen trap.    And that was the end of this small romance,     The end of the story of Conroy's Gap.     Our New Horse       The boys had come back from the races     All silent and down on their luck;    They'd backed 'em, straight out and for places,     But never a winner they struck.    They lost their good money on Slogan,     And fell, most uncommonly flat,    When Partner, the pride of the Bogan,     Was beaten by Aristocrat.     And one said, 'I move that"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2130"],["title","Utopia (#1)"],["body"," perfect a friend: he is extraordinarily modest, there is no artifice in him, and yet no man has more of a prudent simplicity. His conversation was so pleasant and so innocently cheerful, that his company in a great measure lessened any longings to go back to my country, and to my wife and children, which an absence of four months had quickened very much. One day, as I was returning home from mass at St. Mary’s, which is the chief church, and the most frequented of any in Antwerp, I saw him, by accident, talking with a stranger, who seemed past the flower of his age; his face was tanned, he had a long beard, and his cloak was hanging carelessly about him, so that, by his looks and habit, I concluded he was a seaman. As soon as Peter saw me, he came and saluted me, and as I was returning his civility, he took me aside, and pointing to him with whom he had been discoursing, he said, “Do you see that man? I was just thinking to bring him to you.” I answered, “He should have been very welcome on your account.” “And on his own too,” replied he, “if you knew the man, for there is none alive that can give so copious an account of unknown nations and countries as he can do, which I know you very much desire.” “Then,” said I, “I did not guess amiss, for at first sight I took him for a seaman.” “But you are much mistaken,” said he, “for he has not sailed as a seaman, but as a traveller, or rather a philosopher. This Raphael, who from his family carries the name of Hythloday, is not ignorant of the Latin tongue, but is eminently learned in the Greek, having applied himself more particularly to that than to the former, because he had given himself much to philosophy, in which he knew that the Romans have left us nothing that is valuable, except what is to be found in Seneca and Cicero. He is a Portuguese by birth, and was so desirous of seeing the world, that he divided his estate among his brothers, ran the same hazard as Americus Vesputius, and bore a share in three of his four voyages that are now published; only he did not return with him in his last, but obtained leave of him, almost by force, that he might be one of those twenty-four who were left at the farthest place at which they touched in their last voyage to New Castile. The leaving him thus did not a little gratify one that was more fond of travelling than of returning home to be buried in his own country; for he used often to say, that the way to heaven was the same from all places, and he that had no grave had the heavens still over him. Yet this disposition of mind had cost him dear, if God had not been very gracious to him; for after he, with five Castalians, had travelled over many countries, at last, by strange good fortune, he got to Ceylon, and from thence to Calicut, where he, very happily, found some Portuguese ships; and, beyond all men’s expectations, returned to his native country.” When Peter had said this to me, I thanked him for his kindness in intending to give me the acquaintance of a man whose conversation he knew would be so acceptable; and upon that Raphael and I embraced each other. After those civilities were past which are usual with strangers upon their first meeting, we all went to my house, and entering into the garden, sat down on a green bank and entertained one another in discourse. He told us that when Vesputius had sailed away, he, and his companions that stayed behind in New Castile, by degrees insinuated themselves into the affections of the people of the country, meeting often with them and treating them gently; and at last they not only lived among them without danger, but conversed familiarly with them, and got so far into the heart of a prince, whose name and country I have forgot, that he both furnished them plentifully with all things necessary, and also with the conveniences of travelling, both boats when they went by water, and waggons when they travelled over land: he sent with them a very faithful guide, who was to introduce and recommend them to such other princes as they had a mind to see: and after many days’ journey, they came to towns, and cities, and to commonwealths, that were both happily governed and well peopled. Under the equator, and as far on both sides of it as the sun moves, there lay vast deserts that were parched with the perpetual heat of the sun; the soil was withered, all things looked dismally, and all places were either quite uninhabited, or abounded with wild beasts and serpents, and some few men, that were neither less wild nor less cruel than the beasts themselves. But, as they went farther, a new scene opened, all things grew milder, the air less burning, the soil more verdant, and even the beasts were less wild: and, at last, there were nations, towns, and cities, that had not only mutual commerce among themselves and with their neighbours, but traded, both by sea and land, to very remote countries. There they found the conveniencies of seeing many countries on all hands, for no ship went any voyage into which he and his companions were not very welcome. The first vessels that they saw were flat-bottomed, their sails were made of reeds and wicker, woven close together, only some were of leather; but, afterwards, they found ships made with round keels and canvas sails, and in all respects like our ships, and the seamen understood both astronomy and navigation. He got wonderfully into their favour by showing them the use of the needle, of which till then they were utterly ignorant. They sailed before with great caution, and only in summer time; but now they count all seasons alike, trusting wholly to the loadstone, in which they are, perhaps, more secure than safe; so that there is reason to fear that this discovery, which was thought would prove so much to their advantage, may, by their imprudence, become an occasion of much mischief to them. But it were too long to dwell on all that he told us he had observed in every place, it would be too great a digression from our present purpose: whatever is necessary to be told concerning those wise and prudent institutions which he observed among civilised nations, may perhaps be related by us on a more proper occasion. We asked him many questions concerning all these things, to which he answered very willingly; we made no inquiries after monsters, than which nothing is more common; for everywhere one may hear of ravenous dogs and wolves, and cruel men-eaters, but it is not so easy to find states that are well and wisely governed.  As he told us of many things that were amiss in those new-discovered countries, so he reckoned up not a few things, from which patterns might be taken for correcting the errors of these nations among whom we live; of which an account may be given, as I have already promised, at some other time; for, at present, I intend only to relate those particulars that he told us, of the manners and laws of the Utopians: but I will begin with the occasion that led us to speak of that commonwealth. After Raphael had discoursed with great judgment on the many errors that were both among us and these nations, had treated of the wise institutions both here and there, and had spoken as distinctly of the customs and government of every nation through which he had past, as if he had spent his whole life in it, Peter, being struck with admiration, said, “I wonder, Raphael, how it comes that you enter into no king’s service, for I am sure there are none to whom you would not be very acceptable; for your learning and knowledge, both of men and things, is such, that you would not only entertain them very pleasantly, but be of great use to them, by the examples you could set before them, and the advices you could give them; and by this means you would both serve your own interest, and be of great use to all your friends.” “As for my friends,” answered he, “I need not be much concerned, having already done for them all that was incumbent on me; for when I was not only in good health, but fresh and young, I distributed that among my kindred and friends which other people do not part with till they are old and sick: when they then unwillingly give that which they can enjoy no longer themselves. I think my friends ought to rest contented with this, and not to expect that for their sakes I should enslave myself to any king whatsoever.” “Soft and fair!” said Peter; “I do not mean that you should be a slave to any king, but only that you should assist them and be useful to them.” “The change of the word,” said he, “does not alter the matter.” “But term it as you will,” replied Peter, “I do not see any other way in which you can be so useful, both in private to your friends and to the public, and by which you can make your own condition happier.” “Happier?” answered Raphael, “is that to be compassed in a way so abhorrent to my genius? Now I live as I will, to which I believe, few courtiers can pretend; and there are so many that court the favour of great men, that there will be no great loss if they are not troubled either with me or with others of my temper.” Upon this, said I, “I perceive, Raphael, that you neither desire wealth nor greatness; and, indeed, I value and admire such a man much more than I do any of the great men in the world. Yet I think you would do what would well become so generous and philosophical a soul as yours is, if you would apply your time and thoughts to public affairs, even though you may happen to find it a little uneasy to yourself; and this you can never do with so much advantage as by being taken into the council of some great prince and putting him on noble and worthy actions, which I know you would do if you were in such a post; for the springs both of good and evil flow from the prince over a whole nation, as from a lasting fountain. So much learning as you have, even without practice in affairs, or so great a practice as you have had, without any other learning, would render you a very fit counsellor to any king"]]]
