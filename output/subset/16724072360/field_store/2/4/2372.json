When the boat was tossed into the sea it fortunately did not upset, although it shipped a good deal of water, and all the men managed to scramble into it; but before they could get the oars out, the gale carried them past the point and away to leeward of the island. After we landed I saw them endeavouring to pull towards us; but as they had only one pair of oars out of the eight that belonged to the boat, and as the wind was blowing right in their teeth, they gradually lost ground.  Then I saw them put about and hoist some sort of sail--a blanket, I fancy, for it was too small for the boat--and in half-an-hour they were out of sight.\"  \"Poor fellows!\"  I murmured sorrowfully.  \"But the more I think about it I've better hope of them,\" continued Jack in a more cheerful tone.  \"You see, Ralph, I've read a great deal about these South Sea Islands, and I know that in many places they are scattered about in thousands over the sea, so they're almost sure to fall in with one of them before long.\"  \"I'm sure I hope so,\" said Peterkin earnestly.  \"But what has become of the wreck, Jack?  I saw you clambering up the rocks there while I was watching Ralph.  Did you say she had gone to pieces?\"  \"No, she has not gone to pieces; but she has gone to the bottom,\" replied Jack.  \"As I said before, she struck on the tail of the island and stove in her bow; but the next breaker swung her clear, and she floated away to leeward.  The poor fellows in the boat made a hard struggle to reach her, but long before they came near her she filled and went down.  It was after she had foundered that I saw them trying to pull to the island.\"  There was a long silence after Jack had ceased speaking, and I have no doubt that each was revolving in his mind our extraordinary position. For my part, I cannot say that my reflections were very agreeable.  I knew that we were on an island, for Jack had said so; but whether it was inhabited or not, I did not know.  If it should be inhabited, I felt certain, from all I had heard of South Sea Islanders, that we should be roasted alive and eaten.  If it should turn out to be uninhabited, I fancied that we should be starved to death.  \"Oh,\" thought I, \"if the ship had only struck on the rocks we might have done pretty well, for we could have obtained provisions from her, and tools to enable us to build a shelter; but now--alas! alas! we are lost!\"  These last words I uttered aloud in my distress.  \"Lost, Ralph!\" exclaimed Jack, while a smile overspread his hearty countenance.  \"Saved, you should have said.  Your cogitations seem to have taken a wrong road, and led you to a wrong conclusion.\"  \"Do you know what conclusion I have come to?\" said Peterkin.  \"I have made up my mind that it's capital--first-rate--the best thing that ever happened to us, and the most splendid prospect that ever lay before three jolly young tars.  We've got an island all to ourselves.  We'll take possession in the name of the king.  We'll go and enter the service of its black inhabitants.  Of course we'll rise, naturally, to the top of affairs: white men always do in savage countries.  You shall be king, Jack; Ralph, prime minister; and I shall be--\"  \"The court-jester,\" interrupted Jack.  \"No,\" retorted Peterkin; \"I'll have no title at all.  I shall merely accept a highly responsible situation under government; for you see, Jack, I'm fond of having an enormous salary and nothing to do.\"  \"But suppose there are no natives?\"  \"Then we'll build a charming villa, and plant a lovely garden round it, stuck all full of the most splendiferous tropical flowers; and we'll farm the land, plant, sow, reap, eat, sleep, and be merry.\"  \"But to be serious,\" said Jack, assuming a grave expression of countenance--which, I observed, always had the effect of checking Peterkin's disposition to make fun of everything--\"we are really in rather an uncomfortable position.  If this is a desert island, we shall have to live very much like the wild beasts; for we have not a tool of any kind--not even a knife.\"  \"Yes, we have _that_,\" said Peterkin, fumbling in his trousers pocket, from which he drew forth a small penknife with only one blade, and that was broken.  \"Well, that's better than nothing.--But come,\" said Jack, rising; \"we are wasting our time in _talking_ instead of _doing_.--You seem well enough to walk now, Ralph.--Let us see what we have got in our pockets; and then let us climb some hill and ascertain what sort of island we have been cast upon, for, whether good or bad, it seems likely to be our home for some time to come.\"    CHAPTER FOUR.  WE EXAMINE INTO OUR PERSONAL PROPERTY, AND MAKE A HAPPY DISCOVERY--OUR ISLAND DESCRIBED--JACK PROVES HIMSELF TO BE LEARNED AND SAGACIOUS ABOVE HIS FELLOWS--CURIOUS DISCOVERIES--NATURAL LEMONADE!  We now seated ourselves upon a rock, and began to examine into our personal property.  When we reached the shore after being wrecked, my companions had taken off part of their clothes and spread them out in the sun to dry; for although the gale was raging fiercely, there was not a single cloud in the bright sky.  They had also stripped off most part of my wet clothes and spread them also on the rocks.  Having resumed our garments, we now searched all our pockets with the utmost care, and laid their contents out on a flat stone before us; and now that our minds were fully alive to our condition, it was with no little anxiety that we turned our several pockets inside out in order that nothing might escape us.  When all was collected together, we found that our worldly goods consisted of the following articles:  First, a small penknife with a single blade, broken off about the middle and very rusty, besides having two or three notches on its edge. (Peterkin said of this, with his usual pleasantry, that it would do for a saw as well as a knife, which was a great advantage.)  Second, an old German-silver pencil-case without any lead in it.  Third, a piece of whip-cord about six yards long.  Fourth, a sailmaker's needle of a small size.  Fifth, a ship's telescope, which I happened to have in my hand at the time the ship struck, and which I had clung to firmly all the time I was in the water; indeed, it was with difficulty that Jack got it out of my grasp when I was lying insensible on the shore.  I cannot understand why I kept such a firm hold of this telescope.  They say that a drowning man will clutch at a straw.  Perhaps it may have been some such feeling in me, for I did not know that it was in my hand at the time we were wrecked.  However, we felt some pleasure in having it with us now-- although we did not see that it could be of much use to us, as the glass at the small end was broken to pieces.  Our sixth article was a brass ring which Jack always wore on his little finger.  I never understood why he wore it; for Jack was not vain of his appearance, and did not seem to care for ornaments of any kind.  Peterkin said, \"it was in memory of the girl he left behind him!\"  But as he never spoke of this girl to either of us, I am inclined to think that Peterkin was either jesting or mistaken.  In addition to these articles, we had a little bit of tinder and the clothes on our backs.  These last were as follows:  Each of us had on a pair of stout canvas trousers and a pair of sailors' thick shoes.  Jack wore a red flannel shirt, a blue jacket, and a red Kilmarnock bonnet or nightcap, besides a pair of worsted socks, and a cotton pocket-handkerchief with sixteen portraits of Lord Nelson printed on it and a union-jack in the middle.  Peterkin had on a striped flannel shirt--which he wore outside his trousers and belted round his waist, after the manner of a tunic--and a round black straw hat.  He had no jacket, having thrown it off just before we were cast into the sea; but this was not of much consequence, as the climate of the island proved to be extremely mild--so much so, indeed, that Jack and I often preferred to go about without our jackets.  Peterkin had also a pair of white cotton socks and a blue handkerchief with white spots all over it.  My own costume consisted of a blue flannel shirt, a blue jacket, a black cap, and a pair of worsted socks, besides the shoes and canvas trousers already mentioned.  This was all we had, and besides these things we had nothing else; but when we thought of the danger from which we had escaped, and how much worse off we might have been had the ship struck on the reef during the night, we felt very thankful that we were possessed of so much, although, I must confess, we sometimes wished that we had had a little more.  While we were examining these things and talking about them, Jack suddenly started and exclaimed:  \"The oar!  We have forgotten the oar!\"  \"What good will that do us?\" said Peterkin.  \"There's wood enough on the island to make a thousand oars.\"  \"Ay, lad,\" replied Jack; \"but there's a bit of hoop-iron at the end of it, and that may be of much use to us.\"  \"Very true,\" said I; \"let us go fetch it.\"  And with that we all three rose and hastened down to the beach.  I still felt a little weak from loss of blood, so that my companions soon began to leave me behind; but Jack perceived this, and, with his usual considerate good-nature, turned back to help me.  This was now the first time that I had looked well about me since landing, as the spot where I had been laid was covered with thick bushes, which almost hid the country from our view.  As we now emerged from among these and walked down the sandy beach together, I cast my eyes about, and truly my heart glowed within me and my spirits rose at the beautiful prospect which I beheld on every side.  The gale had suddenly died away, just as if it had blown furiously till it dashed our ship upon the rocks, and had nothing more to do after accomplishing that.  The island on which we stood was hilly, and covered almost everywhere with the most beautiful and richly coloured trees, bushes, and shrubs, none of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21722"],["title","A Practical Discourse on Some Principles of Hymn-Singing (#1)"],["body","to the root of the matter.    'It is so right and beneficial to devotion, has so much effect upon our   hearts, that it may be insisted on as a common rule for all persons;   ... for singing is as much the proper use of a psalm as devout   supplication is the proper use of a form of prayer: and a psalm only   read is very much like a prayer that is only looked over.... If you   were to tell a person that has such a song, that he need not sing it,   that it was sufficient to peruse it, he would wonder what you meant,   ... as if you were to tell him that he should only look at his food, to   see whether it was good, but need not eat it.... You will perhaps say   that singing is a particular talent, that belongs only to particular   people, and that you have neither voice nor ear for music.    'If you had said that singing is a general talent, and that people   differ in that as they do in all other things, you had said something   much truer.    'For how vastly people differ in the talent of thinking, which is not   only common to all men, but seems to be the very essence of human   nature: ... yet no one desires to be excused from thought because he   has not this talent in any fine degree....    'If a person were to forbear praying because he had an odd tone in his   voice, he would have as good an excuse as he that forbears from singing   psalms because he has but little management of his voice....    'These songs make a sense (of) delight in God they awaken holy   devotion: they teach how to ask: they kindle a holy flame....    'Singing is the natural effect of JOY in the heart, ... and it is also   the natural means of raising EMOTIONS OF JOY in the mind: such JOY AND   THANKFULNESS to God as is the highest perfection of a divine and holy   life.'  Now though I cannot feel the force of all Law's arguments nor easily bring myself to believe that a person who dislikes singing, and has no ear for music, will readily find any comfortable assistance to his private devotion from making efforts to hit off the notes of the scale; yet I feel that Law's position is in the main sound, and that he has correctly specified the emotion most proper to that kind of uncultured singing which he describes: and though congregational psalm-singing necessarily involves a greater musical capacity than that assumed in Law's extreme case, and may therefore have a wider field, yet we may begin by laying down that JOY, PRAISE, and THANKSGIVING give us the first main head of what is proper to be expressed, and we may extend this head by adding ADORATION and perhaps the involved emotions of AWE and PEACE and even the attitude of CONTEMPLATION.  In such a subject as the classification of emotions as they may be expressed by music of one kind or another, it is plainly impossible to make any definite tabulation with which all would agree. The very names of the emotions will, to different minds, call up different associations of feeling. If any agreement could be arrived at, it would be at the expense of distinction; and all that I can expect is to have my distinctions understood, and in the main agreed with. And as I am most ready to grant to the reader his right to a different opinion on any detail, I beg of him the same toleration, and that he will rather try to follow my meaning than dwell on discrepancies which may be due to a fault of expression, or to a difference of meaning which he and I may attach to the same word.  With this apology in preamble, I will attempt to make some classification of emotions as they seem to me to be the possible basis for musical expression in congregational singing.  We have already one class: I would add a second, to include all the hymns which exhibit the simple attitude of PRAYER.  A third class I would put under the head of FAITH. Examples of this class will no doubt often cross with those of the first class, but they will specify themselves as CELEBRATIONS of events of various COMMEMORATION, introducing a distinct form, namely NARRATION, which is a very proper and effective form for general praise.  Also this section will include all the hymns of BROTHERHOOD and FELLOWSHIP, and of SPIRITUAL CONFLICT, with the correlative _invitatory_ and _exhortatory_ songs, as modified by what will be said later.  Also, lastly, under this same head of Faith, the DOCTRINAL hymns, and professions of creed whether sectarian or otherwise, which, if the definition be taken widely, make a large and popular class, well exemplified by the German hymns of the Reformation, or by those of our Wesleyan revival; strong with the united feeling of a small body, asserting itself in the face of opposition: concerning which we will not speak further, except to recall the fact that this kind of enthusiasm was not absent from the causes which first introduced hymns into the Western Church.  I believe that this is a pretty full list of all the attitudes of mind that can be properly expressed by congregational singing; and if we turn to other emotions which are made the subject of church hymns, we shall, I think, see that they are all of them liable to suffer damage by being entrusted to the rough handling of general vociferation.  Such will be all hymns of DIVINE AFFECTION and YEARNING; all LAMENTS and CONSOLATIONS; all descriptions of spiritual conditions which imply personal experience and feeling, as ABASEMENT, HUMILIATION, CONTRITION, REPENTANCE, RESIGNATION, SELF-DEVOTION, CONVICTION, and SATISFACTION.  Here I feel that many readers will be inclined to dissent from what I say, and as I shall not again recur to Law, I should like, in order to show my meaning, to call up his extreme example of an unmusical person singing in private devotion. If one pictures such a case as he supposes, is it not clear, whether one imagines oneself the actor or the unwilling auditor, that while such an exhibition of joy might perhaps pass, yet a similar incompetent attempt to express any of the last-named emotions would be only ridiculous? But between this single worshipper and the congregation the incompetence seems to me only a question of degree; while in the far more considerable respect of the sincerity of the feeling in the hearts of those expressing it, Law's singer has every advantage; indeed no objection on this score can be raised to him. But now suppose for a moment that he has _not_ the emotion at heart corresponding to his attempt at song, and I think the differentiation of motives for congregational singing will seem justifiable.  All these last-named emotions,--which I have taken from congregational hymn-books,--and I suppose there may be more of them,--call for delicacy of treatment. A Lamentation, for instance, which might seem at first sight as if it would gain force by volume, will, if it is realistic or clumsy, become unmanly, almost so as to be ridiculous, and certainly depressing to the spirit rather than purifying. In fact while many of the subjects require beautiful expression, they are also more properly used when offered as inspiring ideals; and to assume them to be of common attainment or experience is to degrade them from their supreme sanctity. But in thus ruling them unfit for general singing one must distinguish large miscellaneous congregations from small united bodies, in which a more intimate emotion may be natural: and as there is no exact line of distinction here, so there is no objection to the occasional and partial intrusion of some of these more intimate subjects into congregational hymns.  To this first question then, as to what emotions are fit to be expressed by congregational music, the answer appears to be that the more general the singing, the more general and simple should be the emotion and that the universally fitting themes are those of simple praise, prayer, or faith: and we might inquire whether one fault of our modern hymn-books may not be their attempt to supply congregational music to unfitting themes.  To the next question, _Whose emotion_ is this congregational music to excite or heighten? the answer is plain: It is the average man, or one rather below the average, the uneducated, as St. Augustin says the weaker, mind and that in England is, at least artistically, a narrow mind and a vulgar being. And it may of course be alleged that the music in our hymn-books which is intolerable to the more sensitive minds was not put there for them, but would justify itself in its supposed fitness for the lower classes. 'What use,' the pastor would say to one who, on the ground of tradition advocated the employment of the old plain-song and the Ambrosian melodies, 'What use to seek to attract such people as those in my cure with the ancient outlandish and stiff melodies that pleased folk a thousand years ago, and which I cannot pretend to like myself?' Or if his friend is a modern musician, who is urging him to have nothing in his church but what would satisfy the highest artistic sense of the day, his answer is the same: he will tell you that it would be casting pearls before swine; and that unless the music is 'tuney' and 'catchy' the people will not take to it. And we cannot hastily dismiss these practical objections. The very Ambrosian music which is now so strange to modern ears was doubtless, when St. Ambrose introduced it, much akin to the secular music of the day, if it was not directly borrowed from it: and the history of hymn-music is a history of the adaptations of profane successes in the art to the uses of the Church. Nor do I see that it can ever be otherwise, for the highest music demands a supernatural material; so that it would seem an equal folly for musicians to neglect the unique opportunity which religion offers them, and for religion to refuse the best productions of human art. And we must also remember that the art of the time, whether it be bad or good, has a much more living relation to the generation which is producing it, and exerts a more powerful influence upon it, than the"]]]
