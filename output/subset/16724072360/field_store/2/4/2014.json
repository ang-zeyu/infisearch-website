Guy, lying staring at a patch of wintry moonlight on the odd striped paper of his wall--it had stopped snowing since they had come into the house, and the clouds had broken away, leaving a brilliant sky--discovered his door to be softly opening. The glimmer of a candle filtered through the crack, a voice whispered his name.  \"Who is it?\" he answered under his breath.  \"It's Nan. May I come in?\"  \"Of course. What's up?\"  \"Nothing. I wanted to talk a minute.\" She came noiselessly in, wrapped in a woolly scarlet kimono, scarlet slippers on her feet, her brown braids hanging down her back. The frost-bloom lately on her cheeks had melted into a ruddy glow, her eyes were stars. She set her candle on the little stand, and sat down on the edge of Guy's bed. He raised himself on his elbow and lay looking appreciatively at her.  \"This is like old times,\" he said. \"But won't you be cold?\"  \"Not a bit. I'm only going to stay a minute. Anyhow, this thing is warm as toast.... Yes, isn't it like old times?\"  \"Got your lessons for to-morrow?\"  She laughed. \"All but my CçŠ˜ar. You'll help me with that, in the morning, won't you?\"  \"Sure--if you'll make some cushions for my bobs.\"  \"I will. Guy--how's Lucy Harper?\"  \"She's all right. How's Bob Fields?\"  \"Oh, I don't care for him, now!\" She tossed her head.  He kept up the play. \"Like Dave Strong better, huh? He's a softy.\"  \"He isn't. Oh, Guy--I heard you had a new girl.\"  \"New girl nothing. Don't care for girls.\"  \"Yes, you do. At least I think you do. Her name's--Margaret.\"  The play ceased abruptly. Guy's face changed. \"Perhaps I do,\" he murmured, while his sister watched him in the candle-light.  \"She won't answer yet?\" she asked very gently.  \"Not a word.\"  \"You've cared a good while, haven't you, dear?\"  \"Seems like ages. Suppose it isn't.\"  \"No--only two years, really caring hard. Plenty of time left.\"  He moved his head impatiently. \"Yes, if I didn't mind seeing her smile on Tommy Gower--de'il take him--just as sweetly as she smiles on me. If she ever held out the tip of her finger to me, I'd seize it and hold on to it for fair. But she doesn't. She won't. And she's going South next week for the rest of the winter, and there's a fellow down there in South Carolina where she goes--oh, he--he's red-headed after her, like the rest of us. And, well--I'm up against it good and hard, Nan, and that's the truth.\"  \"Poor boy. And you gave up going to see her on Christmas Day, and came down here into the country just to--\"  \"Just to get even with myself for the way I've neglected 'em these two years while my head's been so full of--her. It isn't fair. After last year I'd have come home to-day if it had meant I had to lose--well--Margaret knows I'm here. I don't know what she thinks.\"  \"I don't believe, Guy, boy, she thinks the less of you. Yes--I must go. It will all come right in the end, dear--I'm sure of it. No, I don't know how Margaret feels--Good night--good night!\"         *       *       *       *       *  Christmas morning, breaking upon a wintry world--the Star in the East long set. Outside the house a great silence of drift-wrapped hill and plain;--inside, a crackling fire upon a wide hearth, and a pair of elderly people waking to a lonely holiday.  [Illustration: \"'THE CHILDREN!' SHE WAS SAYING. 'THEY--THEY--JOHN--THEY MUST BE HERE!'\"]  Mrs. Fernald crept to the door of her room--the injured knee always made walking difficult after a night's quiet. She meant to sit down by the fire which she had lately heard Marietta stirring and feeding into activity, and warm herself at its flame. She remembered with a sad little smile that she and John had hung their stockings there, and looked to see what miracle had been wrought in the night.  \"_Father_!\"--Her voice caught in her throat.... What was all this?... By some mysterious influence her husband learned that she was calling him, though he had not really heard. He came to the door and looked at her, then at the chimneypiece where the stockings hung--a long row of them, as they had not hung since the children grew up--stockings of quality: one of brown silk, Nan's; a fine gray sock with scarlet clocks, Ralph's,--all stuffed to the top, with bundles overflowing upon the chimneypiece and even to the floor below.  \"What's this--what's this?\" John Fernald's voice was puzzled. \"Whose are these?\" He limped closer. He put on his spectacles and stared hard at a parcel protruding from the sock with the scarlet clocks.  \"'_Merry Christmas to Ralph from Nan_,'\" he read. \"'To Ralph from Nan,'\" he repeated vaguely. His gaze turned to his wife. His eyes were wide like a child's. But she was getting to her feet, from the chair into which she had dropped.  \"The children!\" she was saying. \"They--they--John--they must be _here_!\"  He followed her through the chilly hall to the front staircase, seldom used now, and up--as rapidly as those slow, stiff joints would allow. Trembling, Mrs. Fernald pushed open the first door at the top.  A rumpled brown head raised itself from among the pillows, a pair of sleepy but affectionate brown eyes smiled back at the two faces peering in, and a voice brimful of mirth cried softly: \"Merry Christmas, mammy and daddy!\" They stared at her, their eyes growing misty. _It was their little daughter Nan, not yet grown up!_  They could not believe it. Even when they had been to every room;--had seen their big son Ralph, still sleeping, his yet youthful face, full of healthy colour, pillowed on his brawny arm, and his mother had gently kissed him awake to be half-strangled in his hug;--when they had met Edson's hearty laugh as he fired a pillow at them--carefully, so that his father could catch it;--when they had seen plump pretty Carol pulling on her stockings as she sat on the floor smiling up at them;--Oliver, advancing to meet them in his bath-robe and slippers;--Guy, holding out both arms from above his blankets, and shouting \"Merry Christmas!--and how do you like your children?\"--even then it was difficult to realise that not one was missing--and that no one else was there. Unconsciously Mrs. Fernald found herself looking about for the sons' wives and daughters' husbands and children. She loved them all;--yet--to have her own, and no others, just for this one day--it was happiness indeed.  When they were all downstairs, about the fire, there was great rejoicing. They had Marietta in; indeed, she had been hovering continuously in the background, to the apparently frightful jeopardy of the breakfast in preparation, upon which, nevertheless, she had managed to keep a practised eye.  \"And you were in it, Marietta?\" Mr. Fernald said to her in astonishment, when he first saw her. \"How in the world did you get all these people into the house and to bed without waking us?\"  \"It was pretty consid'able of a resk,\" Marietta replied, with modest pride, \"'seein' as how they was inclined to be middlin' lively. But I kep' a-hushin' 'em up, and I filled 'em up so full of victuals they couldn't talk. I didn't know's there'd be any eatables left for to-day,\" she added--which last remark, since she had been slyly baking for a week, Guy thought might be considered pure bluff.  At the breakfast table, while the eight heads were bent, this thanksgiving arose, as the master of the house, in a voice not quite steady, offered it to One Unseen:  _Thou who camest to us on that first Christmas Day, we bless Thee for this good and perfect gift Thou sendest us to-day, that Thou forgettest us not in these later years, but givest us the greatest joy of our lives in these our loyal children._  Nan's hand clutched Guy's under the table. \"Doesn't that make it worth it?\" his grasp said to her, and hers replied with a frantic pressure, \"Indeed it does, but we don't deserve it.\"  ... It was late in the afternoon, a tremendous Christmas dinner well over, and the group scattered, when Guy and his mother sat alone by the fire. The \"boys\" had gone out to the great stock barn with their father to talk over with him every detail of the prosperous business he, with the help of an invaluable assistant, was yet able to manage. Carolyn and Nan had ostensibly gone with them, but in reality the former was calling upon an old friend of her childhood, and the latter had begged a horse and sleigh and driven merrily away alone upon an errand she would tell no one but her mother.  [Illustration: \"'MERRY CHRISTMAS, MAMMY AND DADDY!'\"]  Mrs. Fernald sat in her low chair at the side of the hearth, her son upon a cushion at her feet, his head resting against her knee. Her slender fingers were gently threading the thick locks of his hair, as she listened while he talked to her of everything in his life, and, at last, of the one thing he cared most about.  \"Sometimes I get desperate and think I may as well give her up for good and all,\" he was saying. \"She's so--so--_elusive_--I don't know any other word for it. I never can tell how I stand with her. She's going South next week. I've asked her to answer me before she goes. Somehow I've clung to the hope that I'd get my answer to-day. You'll laugh, but I left word with my office-boy to wire me if a note or anything from her came. It's four o'clock, and I haven't heard. She--you see, I can't help thinking it's because she's going to--turn me down--and--hates to do it--Christmas Day!\"  He turned suddenly and buried his face in his mother's lap; his shoulders heaved a little in spite of himself. His mother's hand caressed his head more tenderly than ever, but, if he could have seen, her eyes were very bright.  They were silent for a long time. Then suddenly a jingle of sleigh bells approached through the falling winter twilight, drew near, and stopped at the door. Guy's mother laid her hands upon his shoulders. \"Son,\" she said, \"there's some one stopping now. Perhaps it's the boy with a message from the station.\"  He was on his feet in an instant.

The remaining English residents were few in number, and kept, to all appearance, \"strictly neutral,\" until the morning of June 5th, 1900, when the British troops poured into the capital.  The two people chiefly concerned in this story, mother and daughter, lived in Sunnyside, a south-eastern suburb of Pretoria, on a large and beautiful old property, appropriately called Harmony, one of the oldest estates in the capital.  This historical place consisted of a simple, comfortable farm-house, with a rambling garden--a romantic spot, and an ideal setting for the adventures and enterprises here recorded.  At the time our story opens, the owner, Mrs. van Warmelo, was living alone on it with her daughter, Hansie, a girl of twenty-two, the diarist referred to in the Introduction.  The other members of the family, though they took no part in those events of the war which took place within the capital, were so closely connected with the principal figures in this book that their introduction will be necessary here.  The family consisted of five, two daughters and three sons. The elder daughter was married and was living at Wynberg near Cape Town, the younger, as we have seen, was with her mother in Pretoria during the war, while of the sons, two, the eldest and the youngest, Dietlof and Fritz, were on commando, having left the capital with the first contingent of volunteers on September 28th.  The third brother, Willem, who had been studying in Holland when the war broke out, had, with his mother's knowledge and permission, given up his nearly completed studies and had come to South Africa, to take part in the deadly struggle in which his fellow-countrymen were engaged.  In order to achieve his purpose, he had taken the only route open to him, the eastern route through Delagoa Bay, and had joined his brothers in the field, after a brief sojourn with his mother and sister at Harmony.  Considering the circumstances under which he had joined the Boer forces and the sacrifice he had made for love of fatherland, it was particularly sad that he should have been made a prisoner at the last great fight at the Tugela, the battle of Pieter's Height in Natal, on February 27th, after a very short experience of commando life.  He was lodged in the Maritzburg jail at this time, where things would have gone hard with him, but for the loving-kindness of his cousin, Miss Berning, now Lady Bale, who frequently visited him with her sister, and provided him with baskets of fruit and other delicacies, which helped greatly to brighten the long months of his imprisonment.  Later on, through the influence of his brother-in-law, Mr. Henry Cloete, of \"Alphen,\" Wynberg, he was released on parole, and allowed to return to Holland to complete his studies. His name therefore will no more appear in these pages.  He was \"out of action\" once and for all, and could not be made use of, even when, later on, through the development of the events with which this book deals, his services were most required by his mother and sister.  The other two brothers, as we have said, had left Pretoria with the first volunteers.  It is strange that the first blood shed in that terrible war should have been that of a young Boer accidentally shot by a comrade.  As a train, laden with its burden of brave and hopeful burghers, steamed slowly through the cutting on the south-eastern side of Pretoria, volleys of farewell shots were fired.  It is customary to extract the bullets from the cartridges on such occasions, but one of the burghers must have omitted to do this, with the result that the bullet, rebounding from the rocks, penetrated a carriage window, and seriously wounded one of the occupants.  Was this event prophetic of a later development of the war, when, as we shall see, Boer shed the blood of brother Boer in the formation of the National Scouts Corps?  Mrs. van Warmelo was a \"voor-trekker,\" a pioneer, in every sense of the word. As a girl of fourteen she had left Natal with her parents and had \"trekked,\" with other families, through the wild waste of country, into the unknown and barbaric regions in which she was destined to spend her youth.  She had watched the growth of a new country, the building up of a new race. She had known all the hardships and dangers of life in an unsettled and uncivilised land, had been through a number of Kaffir wars and could speak, through personal experience, of many adventures with savage foes and wild beasts. Her children knew her stories by heart, and it is not to be wondered at that they grew up with the love of adventure strong in them. And above all things, they grew up with a strong love for the strange, rich, wild country for which their forefathers had fought and suffered.  Mrs. van Warmelo was the eldest daughter of a family of sixteen. Her father, Dietlof Siegfried MarÃ©, for many years Landdrost of Zoutpansberg, that northern territory of the Transvaal, was a direct descendant of the Huguenot fugitives, and was a typical Frenchman, short of stature, dark, vivacious, and exceedingly humorous, a man remembered by all who knew him for his great hospitality and for the shrewd, quaint humour of his sayings.      [Illustration: MRS. VAN WARMELO.]  Some years after their arrival in Zoutpansberg, Mrs. van Warmelo had married a Hollander, a young minister of the Dutch Reformed Church. Of him it is not necessary to speak in this book.  He had taken his part in the first Anglo-Boer war and had passed away in Heidelberg, Transvaal, leaving to the people of his adopted fatherland and to his children a rich inheritance in the memory of a life spent in doing noble deeds--a life of rare self-sacrifice.  His family had left Heidelberg a few years after his death, and had taken up their abode in the capital in order to be near Mrs. van Warmelo's married daughter, Mrs. Cloete, who then lived close to Harmony, in Sunnyside.  It was a wild, romantic suburb in those days, being still almost entirely in its natural state. Grass-covered hills, clumps of mimosa, and other wild trees, with here and there an old homestead picturesquely situated in isolated spots, were all there was to be seen.  Of all the private properties in this suburb, Harmony was the most overgrown and neglected when Mrs. van Warmelo first took possession of it.  It was bounded at the lower, the western end, by the Aapies River, a harmless rivulet in its normal state--almost dry, in fact, during the winter season--but in flood a most dangerous and destructive element, overflowing its banks and sweeping away every obstruction in its wild course.  The property was overgrown with rank vegetation and reminded one of the impenetrable forest abode of the \"Sleeping Beauty\" of fairy-tale fame.  Friends wondered that Mrs. van Warmelo had the courage to live alone with her daughter Hansie in such a wild and desolate spot, and they wondered still more when they heard of the alarming experience the two ladies had the very first night they spent in their new home.  On their arrival, there were still workmen busy repairing the house, and Mrs. van Warmelo pointed out to one of them that the skylight above the bathroom door had not yet been put in. The man nailed a piece of canvas over it, with the remark that that would do for the night, and that he would put in the skylight on his return the next day. Mrs. van Warmelo was only half satisfied, but left the matter there.  During the night one of her own servants, a sullen, treacherous-looking native, recently in her employment, entered the bathroom by putting a ladder against the door and tearing away the canvas from the skylight.  He must then have unlocked the door on the inside, striking about a dozen matches while he was in the room, and carried various portmanteaux out into the garden, where he slashed them open at the sides and overhauled their contents for money and valuables.  Early the next morning Mrs. van Warmelo was roused by old Anne Merriman, the only woman servant on the place, who came in from the garden with articles of wearing apparel which she had picked up under the trees, and which she held up to the astonished gaze of her mistress. On investigating further, they found the garden littered with articles of clothing, valuable documents, and title-deeds, which the thief had thrown aside as worthless, in his search for money.  The only things of value which he had taken with him were a set of pearl ear-rings and brooch, and a beautiful lined \"kaross,\" or rug, made of the skins of wild South African animals. Nothing was seen of him again, but Mrs. van Warmelo immediately got a revolver and kept watch for him, hoping, yet fearing, that he would return for more plunder.  This was a sad beginning, and old Anne added to their fears by predicting every imaginable calamity to the inhabitants of Harmony. She was gifted with second-sight, so she said, and often saw a man in grey about the place; his presence \"boded no good,\" and old"]]]
