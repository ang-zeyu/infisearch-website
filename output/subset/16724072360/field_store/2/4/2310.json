There he sat in the belfry upon the belfry-man, who was       lying flat upon his back. In his teeth the villain held the       bell-rope, which he kept jerking about with his head, raising       such a clatter that my ears ring again even to think of it. On       his lap lay the big fiddle, at which he was scraping, out of all       time and tune, with both hands, making a great show, the       nincompoop! of playing “Judy O’Flannagan and Paddy O’Rafferty.”        Affairs being thus miserably situated, I left the place in       disgust, and now appeal for aid to all lovers of correct time and       fine kraut. Let us proceed in a body to the borough, and restore       the ancient order of things in Vondervotteimittiss by ejecting       that little fellow from the steeple.     LIONIZING        —— all people went      Upon their ten toes in wild wonderment.                     —_Bishop Hall’s Satires_.        I am—that is to say I was—a great man; but I am neither the       author of Junius nor the man in the mask; for my name, I believe,       is Robert Jones, and I was born somewhere in the city of       Fum-Fudge.        The first action of my life was the taking hold of my nose with       both hands. My mother saw this and called me a genius—my father       wept for joy and presented me with a treatise on Nosology. This I       mastered before I was breeched.        I now began to feel my way in the science, and soon came to       understand that, provided a man had a nose sufficiently       conspicuous, he might, by merely following it, arrive at a       Lionship. But my attention was not confined to theories alone.       Every morning I gave my proboscis a couple of pulls and swallowed       a half dozen of drams.        When I came of age my father asked me, one day, if I would step       with him into his study.        “My son,” said he, when we were seated, “what is the chief end of       your existence?”        “My father,” I answered, “it is the study of Nosology.”        “And what, Robert,” he inquired, “is Nosology?”        “Sir,” I said, “it is the science of Noses.”        “And can you tell me,” he demanded, “what is the meaning of a       nose?”        “A nose, my father;” I replied, greatly softened, “has been       variously defined by about a thousand different authors.” [Here I       pulled out my watch.] “It is now noon or thereabouts—we shall       have time enough to get through with them all before midnight. To       commence then:—The nose, according to Bartholinus, is that       protuberance—that bump—that excrescence—that—”        “Will do, Robert,” interrupted the good old gentleman. “I am       thunderstruck at the extent of your information—I am       positively—upon my soul.” [Here he closed his eyes and placed his       hand upon his heart.] “Come here!” [Here he took me by the arm.]       “Your education may now be considered as finished—it is high time       you should scuffle for yourself—and you cannot do a better thing       than merely follow your nose—so—so—so—” [Here he kicked me       downstairs and out of the door.]—“so get out of my house, and God       bless you!”        As I felt within me the divine afflatus, I considered this       accident rather fortunate than otherwise. I resolved to be guided       by the paternal advice. I determined to follow my nose. I gave it       a pull or two upon the spot, and wrote a pamphlet on Nosology       forthwith.        All Fum-Fudge was in an uproar.        “Wonderful genius!” said the Quarterly.        “Superb physiologist!” said the Westminster.        “Clever fellow!” said the Foreign.        “Fine writer!” said the Edinburgh.        “Profound thinker!” said the Dublin.        “Great man!” said Bentley.        “Divine soul!” said Fraser.        “One of us!” said Blackwood.        “Who can he be?” said Mrs. Bas-Bleu.        “What can he be?” said big Miss Bas-Bleu.        “Where can he be?” said little Miss Bas-Bleu.—But I paid these       people no attention whatever—I just stepped into the shop of an       artist.        The Duchess of Bless-my-Soul was sitting for her portrait; the       Marquis of So-and-So was holding the Duchess’ poodle; the Earl of       This-and-That was flirting with her salts; and his Royal Highness       of Touch-me-Not was leaning upon the back of her chair.        I approached the artist and turned up my nose.        “Oh, beautiful!” sighed her Grace.        “Oh my!” lisped the Marquis.        “Oh, shocking!” groaned the Earl.        “Oh, abominable!” growled his Royal Highness.        “What will you take for it?” asked the artist.        “For his nose!” shouted her Grace.        “A thousand pounds,” said I, sitting down.        “A thousand pounds?” inquired the artist, musingly.        “A thousand pounds,” said I.        “Beautiful!” said he, entranced.        “A thousand pounds,” said I.        “Do you warrant it?” he asked, turning the nose to the light.        “I do,” said I, blowing it well.        “Is it quite original?” he inquired; touching it with reverence.        “Humph!” said I, twisting it to one side.        “Has no copy been taken?” he demanded, surveying it through a       microscope.        “None,” said I, turning it up.        “Admirable!” he ejaculated, thrown quite off his guard by the       beauty of the manœuvre.        “A thousand pounds,” said I.        “A thousand pounds?” said he.        “Precisely,” said I.        “A thousand pounds?” said he.        “Just so,” said I.        “You shall have them,” said he. “What a piece of virtu!” So he       drew me a check upon the spot, and took a sketch of my nose. I       engaged rooms in Jermyn street, and sent her Majesty the       ninety-ninth edition of the “Nosology,” with a portrait of the       proboscis.—That sad little rake, the Prince of Wales, invited me       to dinner.        We were all lions and _recherchés_.        There was a modern Platonist. He quoted Porphyry, Iamblicus,       Plotinus, Proclus, Hierocles, Maximus Tyrius, and Syrianus.        There was a human-perfectibility man. He quoted Turgôt, Price,       Priestly, Condorcêt, De Staël, and the “Ambitious Student in Ill       Health.”        There was Sir Positive Paradox. He observed that all fools were       philosophers, and that all philosophers were fools.        There was Æstheticus Ethix. He spoke of fire, unity, and atoms;       bi-part and pre-existent soul; affinity and discord; primitive       intelligence and homoömeria.        There was Theologos Theology. He talked of Eusebius and Arianus;       heresy and the Council of Nice; Puseyism and consubstantialism;       Homousios and Homouioisios.        There was Fricassée from the Rocher de Cancale. He mentioned       Muriton of red tongue; cauliflowers with _velouté_ sauce; veal _à       la St_. Menehoult; marinade _à la_ St. Florentin; and orange       jellies _en mosaïques_.        There was Bibulus O’Bumper. He touched upon Latour and       Markbrünnen; upon Mousseux and Chambertin; upon Richbourg and St.       George; upon Haubrion, Leonville, and Medoc; upon Barac and       Preignac; upon Grâve, upon Sauterne, upon Lafitte, and upon St.       Peray. He shook his head at Clos de Vougeot, and told, with his       eyes shut, the difference between Sherry and Amontillado.        There was Signor Tintontintino from Florence. He discoursed of       Cimabué, Arpino, Carpaccio, and Argostino—of the gloom of       Caravaggio, of the amenity of Albano, of the colors of Titian, of       the frows of Rubens, and of the waggeries of Jan Steen.        There was the President of the Fum-Fudge University. He was of       opinion that the moon was called Bendis in Thrace, Bubastis in       Egypt, Dian in Rome, and Artemis in Greece.        There was a Grand Turk from Stamboul. He could not help thinking       that the angels were horses, cocks, and bulls; that somebody in       the sixth heaven had seventy thousand heads; and that the earth       was supported by a sky-blue cow with an incalculable number of       green horns.        There was Delphinus Polyglott. He told us what had become of the       eighty-three lost tragedies of Æschylus; of the fifty-four       orations of Isæus; of the three hundred and ninety-one speeches       of Lysias; of the hundred and eighty treatises of Theophrastus;       of the eighth book of the conic sections of Apollonius; of       Pindar’s hymns and dithyrambics; and of the five and forty       tragedies of Homer Junior.        There was Ferdinand Fitz-Fossillus Feltspar. He informed us all       about internal fires and tertiary formations; about aëriforms,       fluidiforms, and solidiforms; about quartz and marl; about schist       and schorl; about gypsum and trap; about talc and calc; about       blende and horn-blende; about mica-slate and pudding-stone; about       cyanite and lepidolite; about hematite and tremolite; about       antimony and calcedony; about manganese and whatever you please.        There was myself. I spoke of myself;—of myself, of myself, of       myself;—of Nosology, of my pamphlet, and of myself. I turned up       my nose, and I spoke of myself.        “Marvellous clever man!” said the Prince.        “Superb!” said his guests;—and next morning her Grace of       Bless-my-Soul paid me a visit.        “Will you go to Almack’s, pretty creature?” she said, tapping me       under the chin.        “Upon honor,” said I.        “Nose and all?” she asked.        “As I live,” I replied.        “Here then is a card, my life. Shall I say you will be there?”        “Dear Duchess, with all my heart.”        “Pshaw, no!—but with all your nose?”        “Every bit of it, my love,” said I:—so I gave it a twist or two,       and found myself at Almack’s. The rooms were crowded to       suffocation.        “He is coming!” said somebody on the staircase.        “He is coming!” said somebody farther up.

Helicon and Mount Parnassus appeared on one side; St. Anne, and Mary the wife of Cleophas with her children, were represented on the other. Here the three Graces presented the queen with a golden apple by the hands of their orator Mercury; there the four cardinal Virtues promised, in set speeches, that they would always be aiding and comforting to her.  On the Sunday after her public entry, a day not at this period regarded as improper for the performance of such a ceremonial, Henry caused his queen to be crowned at Westminster with great solemnity; an honor which he never thought proper to confer on any of her successors.  In the sex of the child born to them a few months afterwards, the hopes of the royal pair must doubtless have sustained a severe disappointment: but of this sentiment nothing was suffered to appear in the treatment of the infant, whom her father was anxious to mark out as his only legitimate offspring and undoubted heir to the crown.  She was destined to bear the auspicious name of Elizabeth, in memory of her grandmother, that heiress of the house of York whose marriage with the earl of Richmond, then Henry VII., had united the roses, and given lasting peace to a country so long rent by civil discord. The unfortunate Mary, now in her sixteenth year, was stripped of the title of princess of Wales, which she had borne from her childhood, that it might adorn a younger sister; one too whose birth her interest, her religion, and her filial affection for an injured mother, alike taught her to regard as base and infamous.  A public and princely christening served still further to attest the importance attached to this new member of the royal family.  By the king's special command, Cranmer archbishop of Canterbury stood godfather to the princess; and Shakespeare, by a fiction equally poetical and courtly, has represented him as breaking forth on this memorable occasion into an animated vaticination of the glories of the \"maiden reign.\" Happy was it for the peace of mind of the noble personages there assembled, that no prophet was empowered at the same time to declare how few of them should live to share its splendors; how awfully large a proportion of their number should fall, or behold their nearest connexions falling, untimely victims of the jealous tyranny of Henry himself, or of the convulsions and persecutions of the two troubled reigns destined to intervene before those halcyon days which they were taught to anticipate!  For the purpose of illustrating the truth of this remark, and at the same time of introducing to the reader the most distinguished personages of Henry's court, several of whom will afterwards be found exerting different degrees of influence on the character or fortunes of the illustrious subject of this work, it may be worth while to enumerate in regular order the performers in this august ceremonial. The circumstantial Holinshed, to whom we are indebted for their names and offices, will at the same time furnish some of those minute particulars which serve to bring the whole pompous scene before the eye of fancy.  Early in the afternoon, the lord-mayor and corporation of London, who had been summoned to attend, took boat for Greenwich, where they found many lords, knights, and gentlemen assembled. The whole way from the palace to the friery was strown with green rushes, and the walls were hung with tapestry, as was the Friers' church in which the ceremony was performed.  A silver font with a crimson canopy was placed in the middle of the church; and the child being brought into the hall, the long procession set forward. It began with citizens walking two-and-two, and ended with barons, bishops, and earls. Then came, bearing the gilt basins, Henry earl of Essex, the last of the ancient name of Bourchier who bore the title. He was a splendid nobleman, distinguished in the martial games and gorgeous pageantries which then amused the court: he also boasted of a royal lineage, being sprung from Thomas of Woodstock, youngest son of Edward III.; and perhaps he was apprehensive lest this distinction might hereafter become as fatal to himself as it had lately proved to the unfortunate duke of Buckingham. But he perished a few years after by a fall from his horse; and leaving no male issue, the king, to the disgust of this great family, conferred the title on the low-bred Cromwel, then his favorite minister.  The salt was borne by Henry marquis of Dorset, the unfortunate father of lady Jane Grey; who, after receiving the royal pardon for his share in the criminal plot for setting the crown on the head of his daughter, again took up arms in the rebellion of Wyat, and was brought to expiate this treason on the scaffold.  William Courtney marquis of Exeter followed with the taper of virgin wax; a nobleman who had the misfortune to be very nearly allied to the English throne; his mother being a daughter of Edward IV. He was at this time in high favor with the king his cousin, who, after setting aside his daughter Mary, had even declared him heir-apparent, to the prejudice of his own sisters: but three years after he fell a victim to the jealousy of the king, on a charge of corresponding with his proscribed kinsman cardinal Pole: his honors and estates were forfeited; and his son, though still a child, was detained in close custody.  The chrism was borne by lady Mary Howard, the beautiful daughter of the duke of Norfolk; who lived not only to behold, but, by the evidence which she gave on his trial, to assist in the most unmerited condemnation of her brother, the gallant and accomplished earl of Surry. The king, by a trait of royal arrogance, selected this lady, descended from our Saxon monarchs and allied to all the first nobility, for the wife of his base-born son created duke of Richmond; but it does not appear that the spirit of the Howards was high enough in this reign to feel the insult as it deserved.  The royal infant, wrapped in a mantle of purple velvet, having a long train furred with ermine, was carried by one of her godmothers, the dowager-duchess of Norfolk. Anne Boleyn was this lady's step-grand-daughter: but in this alliance with royalty she had little cause to exult; still less in the closer one which was afterwards formed for her by the elevation of her own grand-daughter Catherine Howard. On discovery of the ill conduct of this queen, the aged duchess was overwhelmed with disgrace; she was even declared guilty of misprision of treason, and committed to custody, but was released by the king after the blood of Catherine and her paramours had quenched his fury.  The dowager-marchioness of Dorset was the other godmother at the font:--of the four sons of this lady, three perished on the scaffold; her grand-daughter lady Jane Grey shared the same fate; and the surviving son died a prisoner during the reign of Elizabeth, for the offence of distributing a pamphlet asserting the title of the Suffolk line to the crown.  The marchioness of Exeter was the godmother at the confirmation, who had not only the affliction to see her husband brought to an untimely end, and her only son wasting his youth in captivity, but, being herself attainted of high treason some time afterwards, underwent a long and arbitrary imprisonment.  On either hand of the duchess of Norfolk walked the dukes of Norfolk and Suffolk, the only nobles of that rank then existing in England.  Their names occur in conjunction on every public occasion, and in almost every important transaction, civil and military, of the reign of Henry VIII., but the termination of their respective careers was strongly contrasted. The duke of Suffolk had the extraordinary good fortune never to lose that favor with his master which he had gained as Charles Brandon, the partner of his youthful pleasures. What was a still more extraordinary instance of felicity, his marriage with the king's sister brought to him neither misfortunes nor perils, and he did not live to witness those which overtook his grand-daughters. He died in peace, lamented by a sovereign who knew his worth.  The duke of Norfolk, on the contrary, was powerful enough by birth and connexions to impress Henry with fears for the tranquillity of his son's reign. The memory of former services was sacrificed to present alarm. Almost with his last breath he ordered his old and faithful servant to the scaffold; but even Henry was no longer absolute on his death-bed. For once he was disobeyed, and Norfolk survived him; but the long years of his succeeding captivity were poorly compensated by a brief and tardy restoration to liberty and honors under Mary.  One of the child's train-bearers was the countess of Kent. This was probably the widow of the second earl of that title and of the name of Grey: she must therefore have been the daughter of the earl of Pembroke, a zealous Yorkist who was slain fighting in the cause of Edward IV. Henry VIII. was doubtless aware that his best hereditary title to the crown was derived from his mother, and during his reign the Yorkist families enjoyed at least an equal share of favor with the Lancastrians, whom his father had almost exclusively countenanced.  Thomas Boleyn earl of Wiltshire, the proud and happy grandfather of the princely infant, supported the train on one side. It is not true that he afterwards, in his capacity of a privy councillor, pronounced sentence of death on his own son and daughter; even Henry was not inhuman enough to exact this of him; but he lived to witness their cruel and disgraceful end, and died long before the prosperous days of his illustrious grandchild.  On the other side the train was borne by Edward Stanley third earl of Derby. This young nobleman had been a ward of Wolsey, and was carefully"]]]
