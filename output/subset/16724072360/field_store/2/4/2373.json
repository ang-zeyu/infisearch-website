It is the same in all aspects of life: it is the book of the day, the hero or statesman of the hour, the newest hope, the latest flash of scientific light, which attracts the people. And it must be, on the face of it, true that any artist who becomes widely popular must have hit off, 'I know not by what secret familiarity,' the exact fashion or caprice of the current taste of his own generation.  And this is so true that it must be admitted that it is not always the uneducated man only whose taste is hit off. In the obituary notices of such men as Gladstone and Tennyson the gossip will inform us, rightly or wrongly, that their 'favourite hymn[7]' was, not one of the great masterpieces of the world,--which, alas, it is only too likely that in their long lives they never heard,--but some tune of the day: as if in the minds of men whose lives appealed strongly to their age there must be something delicately responsive to the exact ripple of the common taste and fashion of their generation.  All this makes a strong case: and it would seem, since our hymn-music is to stir the emotions of the vulgar, that it must itself be both vulgar and modern; and that, in the interest of the weaker mind, we must renounce all ancient tradition and the maxims of art, in order to be in touch with the music-halls.  This is impossibly absurd; and unless there is some flaw in our argument, the fault must lie in the premisses; we have omitted some necessary qualification.  The qualification which we neglected is this, that _the music must be dignified_, and suitable to the meaning; and we should only have wasted words in ignoring what we knew all along, if we had not, by so doing, brought this qualification into its vital prominence, and at the same time exposed the position of those who neglect it, and the real reason of the mean condition of our church music.  The use of undignified music for sacred purposes may perhaps be justified in exceptional cases, which must be left to the judgement of those who consider all things lawful that they may save some. But if from the mission service this licence should creep into the special service, and then invade every act of public worship, it must be met with an edict of unscrupulous exclusion. Not that it can be truly described as thus having crept in in our time. It is always creeping, it has flourished in special habitats for four or five hundred years, and before then there is the history of Palestrina's great reform of like abuses. If in our time in England we differ in any respect for the worse, it is rather in the universal prevalence of a mild form of the degradation, which is perhaps more degrading than the occasional exceptional abuses of a more flagrant kind, which cannot hide their scandal but bring their own condemnation.  There is indeed no extreme from which this abuse has shrunk; perhaps the worst form of it is the setting of sacred hymns to popular airs, which are associated in the minds of the singers with secular, or even comic and amatory words[8]: of which it is impossible to give examples, because the extreme instances are blasphemies unfit to be quoted; and it is only these which could convey an adequate idea of the licence[9] The essence of the practice appears to be the production of a familiar excitement, with the intention of diverting it into a religious channel.  But, even in the absence of secular or profane association, congregational singing, when provoked by undignified music, such as may be found in plenty in our modern hymn-books, may be maintained without the presence of religious feeling, out of mere high spirits, or as we say, 'in fun,' and may easily give rise to mockery. I have witnessed examples enough in proof of this, but if I gave them it might be thought that I wished to amuse profane readers[10]. And though such extreme disasters may be exceptional outbursts, yet they are always but just beneath the surface, and are the inevitable outcome of the use of unworthy means. The cause of such a choice of means must be either an artistic incapacity to distinguish, or a want of faith in the power of religious emotion when unaided by profane adjuncts. What would St. Augustin have ruled here, or thought of the confusion of ideas, which, being satisfied with any expression, mistakes one emotion for another?  The practical question now arises. We know the need; how is it to be supplied? We require music which will reach the emotions of uneducated people, and in which they will delight to join, and in which it shall be easy to join: and it must be dignified and not secular. If we condemn and reject the music which the professional church-musicians have supplied with some popular success to meet the need, what is there to take its place? Of what music is our hymn-book to be constructed, which shall be at once dignified, sacred, and popular?  The answer is very simple: it is this, _Dignified Melody_. Good melody is never out of fashion; and as it is by all confession the seal of high musical genius, so it is that form of music which is universally intelligible and in the best sense popular; and we have a rich legacy of it. What we want is that our hymn-books should contain a collection of the best ecclesiastical and sacred hymn-melodies, and _nothing but these_, instead of having but a modicum of these, for the most part mauled and illset, among a crowd of contributions of an altogether inferior kind; the whole collection being often such that if an ill-natured critic were to assert that the compilers had degraded and limited the old music in order to set off their own, it would be difficult to meet him with a logical refutation.  The shortest and most practical way of treating this subject will be to give some account of the sources from which the music of such a hymn-book as I propose would be drawn. I will take these in their chronological order. First in order of time are the Plain-song melodies.  I have already stated the ordinary objection to these tunes, that they are stiff and out of date. Now it may be likely enough that they will never be so universally popular in our country as the fine melodies invented on the modern harmonic system, yet the idea that they are not popular in character, and that modern people will not sing them, is a mistake; there is plenty of evidence on this point. Nor must we judge them by the incompetent, and I confess somewhat revolting aspect in which they were offered to us by the Anglo-gregorianists of thirty years ago, a presentment which has gone far to ruin their reputation; they are better understood now, and may be heard here and there sung as they should be. They are of great artistic merit and beauty; and instead of considering them _a priori_ as uncongenial on the ground of antiquity, we should rather be thinking of them that they were invented at a time when unison singing was cultivated in the highest perfection, so much so that a large number of these tunes are, on account of their elaborate and advanced rhythm, not only far above the most intelligent taste of the minds with which we have to deal, but are also so difficult of execution that there are few trained choirs in the country that could render them well. To the simpler tunes, however, these objections do not apply: in fact there are only two objections that can be urged against them, and both of these will be found on examination to be advantages.  The first objection is that they are not in the modern scale. Now as this objection is only felt by persons who have cramped their musical intelligence by an insufficient technical education, and cannot believe that music is music unless they are modulating in and out of some key by means of a sharp seventh;--and as the nature of the ecclesiastical modes is too long a subject, and too abstruse for a paper of this sort, even if I were competent to discuss it;--I shall therefore content myself by stating that the ecclesiastical modes have, for melodic purposes (which is all that we are considering), advantages over the modern scale, by which they are so surpassed in harmonic opportunities. Even such a thoroughgoing admirer of the modern system as Sir Hubert Parry writes on this subject, that it 'is now quite obvious that for melodic purposes such modes as the Doric and Phrygian were infinitely (_sic_) preferable to the Ionic,' i.e. to our modern major keys[11]. And it will be evident to every one how much music has of late years sought its charm in modal forms, under the guise of national character.  The second objection is their free rhythm. They are not written in barred time, and cannot without injury be reduced to it.  As this question affects also other classes of hymns, I will here say all that I have to say, or have space to say, about the rhythm of hymn-tunes; confining my remarks generally to the proper dignified rhythms.  In all modern musical grammars it is stated that there are virtually only two kinds of time. The time-beat goes either by twos or some multiple of two, or by threes or some multiple of three, and the accent recurs at regular intervals of time, and is marked by dividing off the music into bars of equal length. Nothing is more important for a beginner to learn, and yet from the point of view of rhythm nothing could be more inadequate. _Rhythm is infinite._ These regular times are no doubt the most important fundamental entities of it, and may even lie undiscoverably at the root of all varieties of rhythm whatsoever, and further they may be the only possible or permissible rhythms for a modern composer to use, but yet the absolute dominion which they now enjoy over all music lies rather in their practical necessity and convenience (since it is only by attending to them that the elaboration of modern harmonic music is possible), than in the undesirability (in itself) or unmusical character of melody which ignores them.

As the tide fell the wreck ceased to heave.  Then it became possible for the seamen to move about without clinging to shrouds and stanchions for very life.  \"Fetch a rocket, Jim,\" said the captain to one of the men.  Jim obeyed, and soon a whizzing line of light was seen athwart the black sky.  \"They'll never see it,\" muttered the first mate, as he got ready another rocket.  \"Weather's too thick.\"  Several rockets were fired, and then, to make more sure of attracting the lifeboat men, a tar-barrel, fastened to the end of a spar, was thrust out ahead and set on fire.  By the grand lurid flare of this giant torch the surrounding desolation was made more apparent, and at the fearful sight hearts which had hitherto held up began to sink in despair.  The mate's fears seemed to be well grounded, for no answering signal was seen to rise from the land, towards which every eye was anxiously strained.  One hour passed, then another, and another, but still no help came.  Then the tide began to rise, and with it, of course, the danger to increase.  All this time rockets had been sent up at intervals, and tar-barrels had been kept burning.  \"We had better make the women and children fast, sir,\" suggested the mate, as a heavy mass of spray burst over the bulwarks and drenched them.  \"Do so,\" replied the captain, gathering up a coil of rope to assist in the work.  \"Is this necessary?\" asked the widow, as the captain approached her.  \"I fear it is,\" he replied.  \"The tide is rising fast.  In a short time the waves will be breaking over us again, and you will run a chance of bein' swept away if we don't make you fast.  But don't despair, they must have seen our signals by this time, an' we shall soon have the lifeboat out.\"  \"God grant it,\" murmured the widow, fervently, as she strained poor little trembling Lizzie to her breast.  But as the moments flew by and no succour came, some gave way altogether and moaned piteously, while others appeared to be bereft of all capacity of thought or action.  Many began to pray in frantic incoherence, and several gave vent to their feelings in curses.  Only a few maintained absolute self-possession and silence.  Among these were the widow and one or two of the other women.  They were in this condition when one of the crew who had been noted as a first-rate singer of sea songs, and the \"life of the fo'c's'l,\" had occasion to pass the spot where the passengers were huddled under the lee of the starboard bulwarks.  \"Is there never a one of ye,\" he asked, almost sternly, \"who can pray like a Christian without screechin'?  You don't suppose the Almighty's deaf, do you?\"  This unexpected speech quieted the noisy ones, and one of the women, turning to a man beside her, said, \"You pray for us, Joe.\"  Joe was one of those who had remained, from the first, perfectly still, except when required to move, or when those near him needed assistance. He was a grave elderly man, whose quiet demeanour, dress, and general appearance, suggested the idea of a city missionary--an idea which was strengthened when, in obedience to the woman's request, he promptly prayed, in measured sentences, yet with intense earnestness, for deliverance--first from sin and then from impending death--in the name of Jesus.  His petition was very short, and it was barely finished when a wave of unusual size struck the vessel with tremendous violence, burst over the side and almost swept every one into the sea.  Indeed, it was evident that some of the weaker of the party would have perished then if they had not been secured to the vessel with ropes.  It seemed like a stern refusal of the prayer, and was regarded as such by some of the despairing ones, when a sudden cheer was heard and a light resembling a great star was seen to burst from the darkness to windward.  \"The lifeboat!\" shouted the captain, and they cheered with as much hearty joy as if they were already safe.  A few minutes more and the familiar blue and white boat of mercy leaped out of darkness into the midst of the foaming waters like a living creature.  It was the boat from the neighbouring port of Brentley.  Either the storm-drift had not been so thick in that direction as in the neighbourhood of Greyton, or the Brentley men had kept a better look-out.  She had run down to the wreck under sail.  On reaching it--a short distant to windward--the sail was lowered, the anchor dropped, the cable payed out, and the boat eased down until it was under the lee of the wreck.  But the first joy at her appearance quickly died out of the hearts of some, who were ignorant of the powers of lifeboats and lifeboat men, when the little craft was seen at one moment tossed on the leaping foam till on a level with the ship's bulwarks, at the next moment far down in the swirling waters under the mizzen chains; now sheering off as if about to forsake them altogether; anon rushing at their sides with a violence that threatened swift destruction to the boat; never for one instant still; always tugging and plunging like a mad thing.  \"How can we ever get into that?\" was the thought that naturally sprang into the minds of some, with chilling power.  Those, however, who understood the situation better, had more legitimate ground for anxiety, for they knew that the lifeboat, if loaded to its utmost capacity, could not carry more than half the souls that had to be saved.  On becoming aware of this the men soon began to reveal their true characters.  The unselfish and gentle made way for the women and children.  The coarse and brutal, casting shame and every manly feeling aside, struggled to the front with oaths and curses, some of them even using that false familiar motto, \"Every man for himself, and God for us all!\"  But these received a check at the gangway, for there stood the captain, revolver in hand.  He spoke but one word--\"back,\" and the cravens slunk away.  The mild man who had offered prayer sat on the ship's bulwarks calmly looking on.  He understood the limited capacity of the boat, and had made up his mind to die.  \"Now, madam, make haste,\" cried the mate, pushing his way towards the widow.  \"Come, father,\" she said, holding out her hand; but the old man did not move.  \"There are more women and little ones,\" he said, \"than the boat can hold.  Good-bye, darling.  We shall meet again--up yonder.  Go.\"  \"Never!\" exclaimed the widow, springing to his side.  \"I will die with you, father!  But here, boatman, save, oh, save my child!\"  No one attended to her.  At such terrible moments men cannot afford to wait on indecision.  Other women were ready and only too glad to go. With a sense almost of relief at the thought that separation was now impossible, the widow strained the child to her bosom and clung to her old father.  At that moment the report of a pistol was heard, and a man fell dead upon the deck.  At the last moment he had resolved to risk all and rushed to the side, intending to jump into the boat.  \"Shove off,\" was shouted.  The boat shot from the vessel's side.  The bowman hauled on the cable.  In a few seconds the oars were shipped, the anchor was got in, and the overloaded but insubmergible craft disappeared into the darkness out of which it had come.  The wretched people thus left on the wreck knew well that the boat could not make her port, land the rescued party, and return for them under some hours.  They also knew that the waves were increasing in power and volume with the rising water, and that their vessel could not survive another tide.  Can we wonder that most of them again gave way to despair--forgetting that with God \"all things are possible?\"  They were not yet forsaken, however.  On the pier-head at Greyton their signals had indeed been observed, but while the Brentley boat, owing to its position, could run down to the wreck with all sail set, it was impossible for that of Greyton to reach it, except by pulling slowly against wind and tide.  The instant that Bob Massey saw the flare of the first tar-barrel he had called out his men.  One after another they came leaping over the rocks--eager for the God-like work of saving life.  It is one of the grand characteristics of our lifeboatmen that on being summoned to the fight there are often far more volunteers than are required.  Joe Slag, as in duty bound, was first to answer the call. Then several of the younger men came running down.  Last of all--almost too late--Tom Riley appeared, buckling on his lifebelt as he ran.  His gait was not quite steady, and his face was flushed.  The coxswain was quick to note these facts.  \"Take that lifebelt off!\" he said, sternly, when Riley came up.  No need to ask why.  The tippler knew the reason why only too well, and he also knew that it was useless, as well as dangerous, to disobey the coxswain.  He took off the belt at once, flung it down, and staggered away back to his grog-shop.  A powerful young fisherman--who had felt almost heart-broken by being refused permission to go for want of room--gladly put on the belt and took Riley's place.  Another minute and they were out of the harbour, battling with the billows and fighting their way inch by inch against the howling blast.  At last they got out so far that they could hoist sail and run with a slant for the wreck.    STORY ONE, CHAPTER 2.  It was daylight by the time the Greyton lifeboat arrived at the scene of action, but the thick, spray-charged atmosphere was almost as bad to see through as the blackness of night.  \"I'm afeared she's gone,\" shouted Slag to the coxswain, putting his hand to his mouth to prevent the words being blown bodily away.  \"No--I see her bearing sou'-west,\" was the brief reply, as Bob Massey plied his steering oar.  A few minutes later, and the despairing people on the wreck, catching sight of the boat, greeted her with a long, wild cheer of reviving hope.  \"What is it?\" asked the widow, faintly, for she had been growing gradually weaker from prolonged exposure.  \"The"]]]
