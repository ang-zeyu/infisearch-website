Day and night the ship throbbed to the tireless pulse of the propeller, and though one day was very like another, it was apparent to Buck that the weather was steadily growing colder. At last, one morning, the propeller was quiet, and the _Narwhal_ was pervaded with an atmosphere of excitement. He felt it, as did the other dogs, and knew that a change was at hand. François leashed them and brought them on deck. At the first step upon the cold surface, Buck’s feet sank into a white mushy something very like mud. He sprang back with a snort. More of this white stuff was falling through the air. He shook himself, but more of it fell upon him. He sniffed it curiously, then licked some up on his tongue. It bit like fire, and the next instant was gone. This puzzled him. He tried it again, with the same result. The onlookers laughed uproariously, and he felt ashamed, he knew not why, for it was his first snow.    Chapter II. The Law of Club and Fang  Buck’s first day on the Dyea beach was like a nightmare. Every hour was filled with shock and surprise. He had been suddenly jerked from the heart of civilization and flung into the heart of things primordial. No lazy, sun-kissed life was this, with nothing to do but loaf and be bored. Here was neither peace, nor rest, nor a moment’s safety. All was confusion and action, and every moment life and limb were in peril. There was imperative need to be constantly alert; for these dogs and men were not town dogs and men. They were savages, all of them, who knew no law but the law of club and fang.  He had never seen dogs fight as these wolfish creatures fought, and his first experience taught him an unforgetable lesson. It is true, it was a vicarious experience, else he would not have lived to profit by it. Curly was the victim. They were camped near the log store, where she, in her friendly way, made advances to a husky dog the size of a full-grown wolf, though not half so large as she. There was no warning, only a leap in like a flash, a metallic clip of teeth, a leap out equally swift, and Curly’s face was ripped open from eye to jaw.  It was the wolf manner of fighting, to strike and leap away; but there was more to it than this. Thirty or forty huskies ran to the spot and surrounded the combatants in an intent and silent circle. Buck did not comprehend that silent intentness, nor the eager way with which they were licking their chops. Curly rushed her antagonist, who struck again and leaped aside. He met her next rush with his chest, in a peculiar fashion that tumbled her off her feet. She never regained them, This was what the onlooking huskies had waited for. They closed in upon her, snarling and yelping, and she was buried, screaming with agony, beneath the bristling mass of bodies.  So sudden was it, and so unexpected, that Buck was taken aback. He saw Spitz run out his scarlet tongue in a way he had of laughing; and he saw François, swinging an axe, spring into the mess of dogs. Three men with clubs were helping him to scatter them. It did not take long. Two minutes from the time Curly went down, the last of her assailants were clubbed off. But she lay there limp and lifeless in the bloody, trampled snow, almost literally torn to pieces, the swart half-breed standing over her and cursing horribly. The scene often came back to Buck to trouble him in his sleep. So that was the way. No fair play. Once down, that was the end of you. Well, he would see to it that he never went down. Spitz ran out his tongue and laughed again, and from that moment Buck hated him with a bitter and deathless hatred.  Before he had recovered from the shock caused by the tragic passing of Curly, he received another shock. François fastened upon him an arrangement of straps and buckles. It was a harness, such as he had seen the grooms put on the horses at home. And as he had seen horses work, so he was set to work, hauling François on a sled to the forest that fringed the valley, and returning with a load of firewood. Though his dignity was sorely hurt by thus being made a draught animal, he was too wise to rebel. He buckled down with a will and did his best, though it was all new and strange. François was stern, demanding instant obedience, and by virtue of his whip receiving instant obedience; while Dave, who was an experienced wheeler, nipped Buck’s hind quarters whenever he was in error. Spitz was the leader, likewise experienced, and while he could not always get at Buck, he growled sharp reproof now and again, or cunningly threw his weight in the traces to jerk Buck into the way he should go. Buck learned easily, and under the combined tuition of his two mates and François made remarkable progress. Ere they returned to camp he knew enough to stop at “ho,” to go ahead at “mush,” to swing wide on the bends, and to keep clear of the wheeler when the loaded sled shot downhill at their heels.  “T’ree vair’ good dogs,” François told Perrault. “Dat Buck, heem pool lak hell. I tich heem queek as anyt’ing.”  By afternoon, Perrault, who was in a hurry to be on the trail with his despatches, returned with two more dogs. “Billee” and “Joe” he called them, two brothers, and true huskies both. Sons of the one mother though they were, they were as different as day and night. Billee’s one fault was his excessive good nature, while Joe was the very opposite, sour and introspective, with a perpetual snarl and a malignant eye. Buck received them in comradely fashion, Dave ignored them, while Spitz proceeded to thrash first one and then the other. Billee wagged his tail appeasingly, turned to run when he saw that appeasement was of no avail, and cried (still appeasingly) when Spitz’s sharp teeth scored his flank. But no matter how Spitz circled, Joe whirled around on his heels to face him, mane bristling, ears laid back, lips writhing and snarling, jaws clipping together as fast as he could snap, and eyes diabolically gleaming—the incarnation of belligerent fear. So terrible was his appearance that Spitz was forced to forego disciplining him; but to cover his own discomfiture he turned upon the inoffensive and wailing Billee and drove him to the confines of the camp.  By evening Perrault secured another dog, an old husky, long and lean and gaunt, with a battle-scarred face and a single eye which flashed a warning of prowess that commanded respect. He was called Sol-leks, which means the Angry One. Like Dave, he asked nothing, gave nothing, expected nothing; and when he marched slowly and deliberately into their midst, even Spitz left him alone. He had one peculiarity which Buck was unlucky enough to discover. He did not like to be approached on his blind side. Of this offence Buck was unwittingly guilty, and the first knowledge he had of his indiscretion was when Sol-leks whirled upon him and slashed his shoulder to the bone for three inches up and down. Forever after Buck avoided his blind side, and to the last of their comradeship had no more trouble. His only apparent ambition, like Dave’s, was to be left alone; though, as Buck was afterward to learn, each of them possessed one other and even more vital ambition.  That night Buck faced the great problem of sleeping. The tent, illumined by a candle, glowed warmly in the midst of the white plain; and when he, as a matter of course, entered it, both Perrault and François bombarded him with curses and cooking utensils, till he recovered from his consternation and fled ignominiously into the outer cold. A chill wind was blowing that nipped him sharply and bit with especial venom into his wounded shoulder. He lay down on the snow and attempted to sleep, but the frost soon drove him shivering to his feet. Miserable and disconsolate, he wandered about among the many tents, only to find that one place was as cold as another. Here and there savage dogs rushed upon him, but he bristled his neck-hair and snarled (for he was learning fast), and they let him go his way unmolested.  Finally an idea came to him. He would return and see how his own team-mates were making out. To his astonishment, they had disappeared. Again he wandered about through the great camp, looking for them, and again he returned. Were they in the tent? No, that could not be, else he would not have been driven out. Then where could they possibly be? With drooping tail and shivering body, very forlorn indeed, he aimlessly circled the tent. Suddenly the snow gave way beneath his fore legs and he sank down. Something wriggled under his feet. He sprang back, bristling and snarling, fearful of the unseen and unknown. But a friendly little yelp reassured him, and he went back to investigate. A whiff of warm air ascended to his nostrils, and there, curled up under the snow in a snug ball, lay Billee. He whined placatingly, squirmed and wriggled to show his good will and intentions, and even ventured, as a bribe for peace, to lick Buck’s face with his warm wet tongue.  Another lesson. So that was the way they did it, eh? Buck confidently selected a spot, and with much fuss and waste effort proceeded to dig a hole for himself. In a trice the heat from his body filled the confined space and he was asleep. The day had been long and arduous, and he slept soundly and comfortably, though he growled and barked and wrestled with bad dreams.  Nor did he open his eyes till roused by the noises of the waking camp. At first he did not know where he was. It had snowed during the night and he was completely buried. The snow walls pressed him on every side, and a great surge of fear swept through him—the fear of the wild thing for the trap. It was a token that he was harking back through his own life to the lives of his forebears; for he was a civilized dog, an unduly civilized dog, and of his own experience knew no trap and so could not of himself fear it. The muscles of his whole body contracted spasmodically and instinctively, the hair on his neck and shoulders stood on end, and with a ferocious"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2150"],["title","The Works of Edgar Allan Poe — Volume 4 (#1)"],["body","old course of things:”        “That there is nothing tolerable out of Vondervotteimittiss:”       and—        “That we will stick by our clocks and our cabbages.”        Above the session-room of the Council is the steeple, and in the       steeple is the belfry, where exists, and has existed time out of       mind, the pride and wonder of the village—the great clock of the       borough of Vondervotteimittiss. And this is the object to which       the eyes of the old gentlemen are turned who sit in the       leather-bottomed arm-chairs.        The great clock has seven faces—one in each of the seven sides of       the steeple—so that it can be readily seen from all quarters. Its       faces are large and white, and its hands heavy and black. There       is a belfry-man whose sole duty is to attend to it; but this duty       is the most perfect of sinecures—for the clock of       Vondervotteimittis was never yet known to have anything the       matter with it. Until lately, the bare supposition of such a       thing was considered heretical. From the remotest period of       antiquity to which the archives have reference, the hours have       been regularly struck by the big bell. And, indeed the case was       just the same with all the other clocks and watches in the       borough. Never was such a place for keeping the true time. When       the large clapper thought proper to say “Twelve o’clock!” all its       obedient followers opened their throats simultaneously, and       responded like a very echo. In short, the good burghers were fond       of their sauer-kraut, but then they were proud of their clocks.        All people who hold sinecure offices are held in more or less       respect, and as the belfry—man of Vondervotteimittiss has the       most perfect of sinecures, he is the most perfectly respected of       any man in the world. He is the chief dignitary of the borough,       and the very pigs look up to him with a sentiment of reverence.       His coat-tail is very far longer—his pipe, his shoe-buckles, his       eyes, and his stomach, very far bigger—than those of any other       old gentleman in the village; and as to his chin, it is not only       double, but triple.        I have thus painted the happy estate of Vondervotteimittiss:       alas, that so fair a picture should ever experience a reverse!        There has been long a saying among the wisest inhabitants, that       “no good can come from over the hills”; and it really seemed that       the words had in them something of the spirit of prophecy. It       wanted five minutes of noon, on the day before yesterday, when       there appeared a very odd-looking object on the summit of the       ridge of the eastward. Such an occurrence, of course, attracted       universal attention, and every little old gentleman who sat in a       leather-bottomed arm-chair turned one of his eyes with a stare of       dismay upon the phenomenon, still keeping the other upon the       clock in the steeple.        By the time that it wanted only three minutes to noon, the droll       object in question was perceived to be a very diminutive       foreign-looking young man. He descended the hills at a great       rate, so that every body had soon a good look at him. He was       really the most finicky little personage that had ever been seen       in Vondervotteimittiss. His countenance was of a dark       snuff-color, and he had a long hooked nose, pea eyes, a wide       mouth, and an excellent set of teeth, which latter he seemed       anxious of displaying, as he was grinning from ear to ear. What       with mustachios and whiskers, there was none of the rest of his       face to be seen. His head was uncovered, and his hair neatly done       up in papillotes. His dress was a tight-fitting swallow-tailed       black coat (from one of whose pockets dangled a vast length of       white handkerchief), black kerseymere knee-breeches, black       stockings, and stumpy-looking pumps, with huge bunches of black       satin ribbon for bows. Under one arm he carried a huge       _chapeau-de-bras_, and under the other a fiddle nearly five times       as big as himself. In his left hand was a gold snuff-box, from       which, as he capered down the hill, cutting all manner of       fantastic steps, he took snuff incessantly with an air of the       greatest possible self-satisfaction. God bless me!—here was a       sight for the honest burghers of Vondervotteimittiss!        To speak plainly, the fellow had, in spite of his grinning, an       audacious and sinister kind of face; and as he curvetted right       into the village, the old stumpy appearance of his pumps excited       no little suspicion; and many a burgher who beheld him that day       would have given a trifle for a peep beneath the white cambric       handkerchief which hung so obtrusively from the pocket of his       swallow-tailed coat. But what mainly occasioned a righteous       indignation was, that the scoundrelly popinjay, while he cut a       fandango here, and a whirligig there, did not seem to have the       remotest idea in the world of such a thing as keeping time in his       steps.        The good people of the borough had scarcely a chance, however, to       get their eyes thoroughly open, when, just as it wanted half a       minute of noon, the rascal bounced, as I say, right into the       midst of them; gave a _chassez_ here, and a _balancez_ there; and       then, after a _pirouette_ and a _pas-de-zephyr_, pigeon-winged       himself right up into the belfry of the House of the Town       Council, where the wonder-stricken belfry-man sat smoking in a       state of dignity and dismay. But the little chap seized him at       once by the nose; gave it a swing and a pull; clapped the big       _chapeau-de-bras_ upon his head; knocked it down over his eyes       and mouth; and then, lifting up the big fiddle, beat him with it       so long and so soundly, that what with the belfry-man being so       fat, and the fiddle being so hollow, you would have sworn that       there was a regiment of double-bass drummers all beating the       devil’s tattoo up in the belfry of the steeple of       Vondervotteimittiss.        There is no knowing to what desperate act of vengeance this       unprincipled attack might have aroused the inhabitants, but for       the important fact that it now wanted only half a second of noon.       The bell was about to strike, and it was a matter of absolute and       pre-eminent necessity that every body should look well at his       watch. It was evident, however, that just at this moment the       fellow in the steeple was doing something that he had no business       to do with the clock. But as it now began to strike, nobody had       any time to attend to his manœuvres, for they had all to count       the strokes of the bell as it sounded.        “One!” said the clock.        “Von!” echoed every little old gentleman in every       leather-bottomed arm-chair in Vondervotteimittiss. “Von!” said       his watch also; “von!” said the watch of his vrow; and “von!”       said the watches of the boys, and the little gilt repeaters on       the tails of the cat and pig.        “Two!” continued the big bell; and        “Doo!” repeated all the repeaters.        “Three! Four! Five! Six! Seven! Eight! Nine! Ten!” said the bell.        “Dree! Vour! Fibe! Sax! Seben! Aight! Noin! Den!” answered the       others.        “Eleven!” said the big one.        “Eleben!” assented the little ones.        “Twelve!” said the bell.        “Dvelf!” they replied perfectly satisfied, and dropping their       voices.        “Und dvelf it is!” said all the little old gentlemen, putting up       their watches. But the big bell had not done with them yet.        “Thirteen!” said he.        “Der Teufel!” gasped the little old gentlemen, turning pale,       dropping their pipes, and putting down all their right legs from       over their left knees.        “Der Teufel!” groaned they, “Dirteen! Dirteen!!—Mein Gott, it is       Dirteen o’clock!!”        Why attempt to describe the terrible scene which ensued? All       Vondervotteimittiss flew at once into a lamentable state of       uproar.        “Vot is cum’d to mein pelly?” roared all the boys—“I’ve been       ongry for dis hour!”        “Vot is com’d to mein kraut?” screamed all the vrows, “It has       been done to rags for this hour!”        “Vot is cum’d to mein pipe?” swore all the little old gentlemen,       “Donder and Blitzen; it has been smoked out for dis hour!”—and       they filled them up again in a great rage, and sinking back in       their arm-chairs, puffed away so fast and so fiercely that the       whole valley was immediately filled with impenetrable smoke.        Meantime the cabbages all turned very red in the face, and it       seemed as if old Nick himself had taken possession of every thing       in the shape of a timepiece. The clocks carved upon the furniture       took to dancing as if bewitched, while those upon the       mantel-pieces could scarcely contain themselves for fury, and       kept such a continual striking of thirteen, and such a frisking       and wriggling of their pendulums as was really horrible to see.       But, worse than all, neither the cats nor the pigs could put up       any longer with the behavior of the little repeaters tied to       their tails, and resented it by scampering all over the place,       scratching and poking, and squeaking and screeching, and       caterwauling and squalling, and flying into the faces, and       running under the petticoats of the people, and creating       altogether the most abominable din and confusion which it is       possible for a reasonable person to conceive. And to make matters       still more distressing, the rascally little scape-grace in the       steeple was evidently exerting himself to the utmost. Every now       and then one"]]]
