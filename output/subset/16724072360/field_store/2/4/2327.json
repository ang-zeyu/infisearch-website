As for the pantaloons, they were a complete wreck. When Dick had possessed them they were well ventilated; but they were now ventilated so much more thoroughly that, as Dick said afterwards, \"a feller would be warmer without any.\"  \"That's Micky Maguire,\" said Dick; \"a partic'lar friend of mine, that had such a great 'fection for me that he stole my clothes to remember me by.\"  \"Perhaps,\" said Fosdick, \"it was on account of his great respect for General Washington and the Emperor Napoleon.\"  \"What would the great Washington say if he could see his coat now?\" said Frank.  \"When I wore it,\" said Dick, \"I was sorry he was so great, 'cause it prevented his clothes fitting me.\"  It may be necessary to explain to those who are unacquainted with Dick's earlier adventures, that the clothes in which he was originally introduced were jocosely referred to by him as gifts from the illustrious personages whose names have been mentioned.  Micky Maguire did not at first recognize Dick. When he did so, he suddenly shambled down Prince Street, fearful, perhaps, that the stolen clothes would be reclaimed.  They had now reached the St. Nicholas, and entered. Mr. Whitney led the way up to his apartment, and then, having a business engagement with a gentleman below, he descended to the reading-room, leaving the boys alone. Left to themselves, they talked freely. Dick related fully the different steps in his education, with which some of our readers are already familiar, and received hearty congratulations from Frank, and earnest encouragement to persevere.  \"I wish you were going to be in the city, Frank,\" said Dick.  \"So I shall be soon,\" said Frank.  Dick's face lighted up with pleasure.  \"That's bully,\" said he, enthusiastically. \"How soon are you comin'?\"  \"I am hoping to enter Columbia College next commencement. I suppose my time will be a good deal taken up with study, but I shall always find time for you and Fosdick. I hope you both will call upon me.\"  Both boys readily accepted the invitation in advance, and Dick promised to write to Frank at his boarding-school in Connecticut. At about half past ten, the two boys left the St. Nicholas, and went back to their boarding-house.  After a comfortable night's sleep, they got up punctually to the seven o'clock breakfast. It consisted of beefsteak, hot biscuit, potatoes, and very good coffee. Dick and Fosdick did justice to the separate viands, and congratulated themselves upon the superiority of their present fare to that which they had been accustomed to obtain at the restaurants.  Breakfast over, Fosdick set out for the hat and cap store in which he was employed, and Dick for Rockwell & Cooper's on Pearl Street. It must be confessed that he felt a little bashful as he stood in front of the large warehouse, and surveyed the sign. He began to feel some apprehensions that he would not be found competent for his post. It seemed such a rise from the streets to be employed in such an imposing building. But Dick did not long permit timidity to stand in his way. He entered the large apartment on the first floor, which he found chiefly used for storing large boxes and cases of goods. There was a counting-room and office, occupying one corner, partitioned off from the rest of the department. Dick could see a young man through the glass partition sitting at a desk; and, opening the door, he entered. He wished it had been Mr. Rockwell, for it would have saved him from introducing himself; but of course it was too early for that gentleman to appear.  \"What is your business?\" inquired the book-keeper, for it was he.  \"I've come to work,\" said Dick, shortly, for somehow he did not take much of a fancy to the book-keeper, whose tone was rather supercilious.  \"Oh, you've come to work, have you?\"  \"Yes, I have,\" said Dick, independently.  \"I don't think we shall need your valuable services,\" said the book-keeper, with something of a sneer. The truth was, that Mr. Rockwell had neglected to mention that he had engaged Dick.  Dick, though a little inclined to be bashful when he entered, had quite got over that feeling now. He didn't intend to be intimidated or driven away by the man before him. There was only one doubt in his mind. This might be Mr. Cooper, the second member of the firm, although he did not think it at all probable. So he ventured this question, \"Is Mr. Rockwell or Mr. Cooper in?\"  \"They're never here at this hour.\"  \"So I supposed,\" said Dick, coolly.  He sat down in an arm-chair, and took up the morning paper.  The book-keeper was decidedly provoked by his coolness. He felt that he had not impressed Dick with his dignity or authority, and this made him angry.  \"Bring that paper to me, young man,\" he said; \"I want to consult it.\"  \"Very good,\" said Dick; \"you can come and get it.\"  \"I can't compliment you on your good manners,\" said the other.  \"Good manners don't seem to be fashionable here,\" said Dick, composedly.  Apparently the book-keeper did not want the paper very particularly, as he did not take the trouble to get up for it. Dick therefore resumed his reading, and the other dug his pen spitefully into the paper, wishing, but not quite daring, to order Dick out of the counting-room, as it might be possible that he had come by appointment.  \"Did you come to see Mr. Rockwell?\" he asked, at length, looking up from his writing.  \"Yes,\" said Dick.  \"Did he tell you to come?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"What was that you said about coming to work?\"  \"I said I had come here to work.\"  \"Who engaged you?\"  \"Mr. Rockwell.\"  \"Oh, indeed! And how much are you to receive for your valuable services?\"  \"You are very polite to call my services valuable,\" said Dick. \"I hope they will be.\"  \"You haven't answered my question.\"  \"I have no objection, I'm sure. I'm to get ten dollars a week.\"  \"Ten dollars a week!\" echoed the book-keeper, with a scornful laugh. \"Do you expect you will earn that?\"  \"No, I don't,\" said Dick, frankly.  \"You don't!\" returned the other, doubtfully. \"Well, you're more modest than I thought for. Then why are you to get so much?\"  \"Perhaps Mr. Rockwell will tell you,\" said Dick, \"if you tell him you're very particular to know, and will lose a night's rest if you don't find out.\"  \"I wouldn't give you a dollar a week.\"  \"Then I'm glad I aint goin' to work for you.\"  \"I don't believe your story at all. I don't think Mr. Rockwell would be such a fool as to overpay you so much.\"  \"P'r'aps I shouldn't be the only one in the establishment that is overpaid,\" observed Dick.  \"Do you mean me, you young rascal?\" demanded the book-keeper, now very angry.  \"Don't call names. It isn't polite.\"  \"I demand an answer. Do you mean to say that I am overpaid?\"  \"Well,\" said Dick, deliberately, \"if you're paid anything for bein' polite, I should think you was overpaid considerable.\"  There is no knowing how long this skirmishing would have continued, if Mr. Rockwell himself had not just then entered the counting-room. Dick rose respectfully at his entrance, and the merchant, recognizing him at once, advanced smiling and gave him a cordial welcome.  \"I am glad to see you, my boy,\" he said. \"So you didn't forget the appointment. How long have you been here?\"  \"Half an hour, sir.\"  \"I am here unusually early this morning. I came purposely to see you, and introduce you to those with whom you will labor. Mr. Gilbert, this is a young man who is going to enter our establishment. His name is Richard Hunter. Mr. Gilbert, Richard, is our book-keeper.\"  Mr. Gilbert nodded slightly, not a little surprised at his employer's cordiality to the new boy.  \"So the fellow was right, after all,\" he thought. \"But it can't be possible he is to receive ten dollars a week.\"  \"Come out into the ware-room, and I will show you about,\" continued Mr. Rockwell. \"How do you think you shall like business, Richard?\"  Dick was on the point of saying \"Bully,\" but checked himself just in time, and said instead, \"Very much indeed, sir.\"  \"I hope you will. If you do well you may depend upon promotion. I shall not forget under what a heavy obligation I am to you, my brave boy.\"  What would the book-keeper have said, if he had heard this?  \"How is the little boy, sir?\" asked Dick.  \"Very well, indeed. He does not appear even to have taken cold, as might have been expected from his exposure, and remaining in wet clothes for some time.\"  \"I am glad to hear that he is well, sir.\"  \"You must come up and see him for yourself, Richard,\" said Mr. Rockwell, in a friendly manner. \"I have no doubt you will become good friends very soon. Besides, my wife is anxious to see and thank the preserver of her boy.\"  \"I shall be very glad indeed to come, sir.\"  \"I live at No. ---- Madison Avenue. Come to-morrow evening, if you have no engagement.\"  \"Thank you, sir.\"  Mr. Rockwell now introduced Dick to his head clerk with a few words, stating that he was a lad in whose welfare he took a deep interest, and he would be glad to have him induct him into his duties, and regard with indulgence any mistakes which he might at first make through ignorance.  The head clerk was a pleasant-looking man, of middle age, named Murdock; very different in his manners and bearing from Mr. Gilbert, the book-keeper.  \"Yes, sir,\" he said, \"I will take the young man under my charge; he looks bright and sharp enough, and I hope we may make a business man of him in course of time.\"  That was what Dick liked. His heart always opened to kindness, but harshness always made him defiant.  \"I'll try to make you as little trouble as possible, sir,\" he said. \"I may make mistakes at first, but I'm willin' to work, and I want to work my way up.\"  \"That's right, my boy,\" said Mr. Murdock. \"Let that be your determination, and I am sure you will succeed.\"  \"Before Mr. Murdock begins to instruct you in your duties,\" said Mr. Rockwell, \"you may go to the post-office, and see if there are any letters for us. Our box is No. 5,670.\"  \"All right, sir,\" said Dick; and he took"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21638"],["title","Tarrano the Conqueror (#1)"],["body","mail. Don't overlook it ... By the code, man, your hands are shaking! You're white as a ghost!\"  The Venus mail; I had forgotten it completely.  \"Greys, I wonder if it'll get in.\"  He stared at me strangely. \"You're thinking that, too. I told the British National Announcer it was a Venus plot. He laughed at me. Those Great Londoners can't see their fingers before them. He said, 'That's your lurid sense of newscasting.'\"  Venus plot! I remembered my impressions of the Venus man who was beside me when our President fell.  Greys was back at his work. I swept the south shore of Eastern Island[3] with my finder, and picked up the image of the inter-planetary landing stage, at which the Venus mail was due to arrive. I could see the blaze of lights plainly; and with another, closer focus I caught the huge landing platform itself. It was empty.  [Footnote 3: Now Long Island.]  The station-master there answered my call. He had no word of the mail.  \"Try the lookout at Table Mountain,\" he advised me. \"They may be coming down that way.... Sure I'll let you know.... What a night! They say that in Mediterrania--\"  But I cut off; it was no time to chat with him. Table Mountain, Capetown, had no word of the mail. Then I caught the Yukon Station. The mail flyer had come down on the North Polar side--was already crossing Hudson Bay.  At 8:26 it landed on Eastern Island. A deluge of Venus despatches overwhelmed me. But the mail news, before I could even begin to handle my section of it, was far overshadowed. Venus, now at 8:44 was calling us by helio. The message came in the inter-planetary code, was decoded at National Headquarters, and from there flashed to us.  The ruler of the Venus Central State was murdered! An almost incoherent message. The murder of the ruler, at a time co-incident with 6:30 in Greater New York. Then the words:  _\"City being attacked ... Tarrano, beware Tarrano ... You are in danger of ...\"_  In danger of what? The message broke off. The observers, behind their huge telescopes at the Potomac Headquarters, saw the helio-lights of the Venus Central State go dark suddenly. Our own station flashed its call, but there was no answer. Venus--evening star on that date--was sinking to the horizon. But our Observatory in Texas could see the planet clearly; and gave the same report.  Communication was broken. The authorities of the Venus Central State--friendly to us in spite of the recent immigration controversy--had tried to warn us.  Of what?     CHAPTER II  _Warning_   It must have been nearly nine o'clock when a personal message came for me. Not through the ordinary open airways, but in the National Length, and coded. It came to my desk by official messenger, decoded, printed and sealed.       _Jac Hallen, Inter-Allied News_. Come to me, North-east Island at      once, if they can spare you. Important. Answer.       Dr. Brende.  Our Division Manager scanned the message curiously and told me I could go. I got off my answer. I did not dare call Dr. Brende openly, since he had used the code, but sent it the same way. I would be up at once.  With a word of good-bye to Greys, I shoved aside my work, caught up a heavy jacket and cap and left the office. The levels outside our building were still jammed with an excited throng. I pushed my way through it, up to the entrance to the Staten Bridge. The waters of the harbor beneath me had a broad band of moonlight upon them, dim in the glare of the city lights. I glanced upward with satisfaction. A good night for air-traveling.  My small personal air-car was on the stage near the bridge entrance. The attendant was there, staring at me as I dashed up in such haste. He handed me my key from the rack.  \"Going far, Jac? What a night! They'll be ordering them off if many more go up.... Going north?\"  \"No,\" I said shortly.  I was away, rising with my helicopters until the city was a yellow haze beneath me. I _was_ going north--to Dr. Brende's little private island off the coast of Maine. The lower lanes were pretty well crowded. I tried one of the north-bound at 8,000 feet; but the going was awkward. Then I went to 16,000.  But Grille, the attendant back at the bridge, evidently had his finder on me, out of plain curiosity. He called me.  \"They'll chase you out of there,\" came his voice. \"Nothing doing up there tonight. That's reserved. Didn't you know it?\"  I grinned at him. In the glow of my pitlight I hoped he could see my face and the grin.  \"They'll never catch me,\" I said. \"I'm traveling fast tonight.\"  \"Chase you out,\" he persisted. \"The patrol's keeping them low. General Orders, an hour ago. Didn't you know it?\"  \"No.\"  \"Well, you ought to. You ought to know everything in your business. Besides, the lights are up.\"  They were indeed; I could see them in all the towers underneath me. I was flying north-east; and at the moment, with a following wind, I was doing something over three-fifty.  \"But they'll shut off your power,\" Grille warned. \"You'll come down soon enough then.\"  Which was also true enough. The evening local-express for Boston and beyond was overhauling me. And when the green beam of a traffic tower came up and picked me out, I decided I had better obey. Dutifully I descended until the beam, satisfied, swung away from me.  At 8,000 feet, I went on. There was too much traffic for decent speed and the directors in every pilot bag and tower I passed seemed watching me closely. At the latitude of Boston, I swung out to sea, off the main arteries of travel. The early night mail for Eurasia,[4] with Great London its first stop, went by me far overhead. I could make out its green and purple lights, and the spreading silver beam that preceded it.  [Footnote 4: Now Europe and Asia.]  Alone in my pit, with the dull whir of my propellers alone breaking the silence of the night, I pondered the startling events of the past few hours. Above me the stars and planets gleamed in the deep purple of an almost cloudless sky. Venus had long since dropped below the horizon. But Mars was up there--approaching the zenith. I wondered what the Martian helio might be saying. I could have asked Greys back at the office. But Greys, I knew, would be too busy to bother with me.  What could Dr. Brende want of me? I was glad he had sent for me--there was nowhere I would rather have gone this particular evening. And it would give me a chance to see Elza again.  I could tell by the light-numerals below, that I was now over Maine. I did not need to consult my charts; I had been up this way many times, for, the Brendes--the doctor, his daughter Elza, and her twin brother Georg--I counted my best friends.  I was over the sea, with the coast of Maine to my left. The traffic, since I left the line of Boston, had been far less. The patrols flashed by me at intervals, but they did not molest me.  I descended presently, and located the small two-mile island which Dr. Brende owned and upon which he lived.  It was 10:20 when I came down to find them waiting for me on the runway.  The doctor held out both his hands. \"Good enough, Jac. I got your code--we've been waiting for you.\"  \"It's crowded,\" I said. \"Heavy up to Boston. And they wouldn't let me go high.\"  He nodded. And then Elza put her cool little hand in mine.  \"We're glad to see you, Jac. Very glad.\"  They took me to the house. Dr. Brende was a small, dark man of sixty-odd, smooth-shaven, a thin face, with a mop of iron-grey hair above it, and keen dark eyes beneath bushy white brows. He was usually kindly and gentle of manner--at times a little abstracted; at other times he could be more forceful and direct than anyone with whom I had ever had contact.  At the house we were joined by the doctor's son, Georg. My best friend, I should say; certainly, for my part, I treasured his friendship very highly. He and Elza were twins--twenty-three years old at this time. I am two years older; and I had been a room-mate with Georg at the Common University of the Potomac.  Our friendship had, if anything, grown closer since my promotion into the business world. Yet we were as unlike as two individuals could possibly be. I am dark-haired, slim, and of comparatively slight muscular strength. Restless--full of nervous energy--and, they tell me, somewhat short of temper. Georg was a blond, powerful young giant. A head taller than I--blue-eyed, from his mother, now dead--square-jawed, and a complexion pink and white. He was slow to anger. He seldom spoke impulsively; and usually with a slow, quiet drawl. Always he seemed looking at life and people with a half-humorous smile--looking at the human pageant with its foibles, follies and frailties--tolerantly. Yet there was nothing conceited about him. Quite the reverse. He was generally wholly deprecating in manner, as though he himself were of least importance. Until aroused. In our days of learning, I saw Georg once--just once--thoroughly angered.  \"... Came up promptly, didn't you?\" Georg was saying. He was leading me to the house doorway, but I stopped him.  \"Let's go to the grove,\" I suggested. We turned down from the small viaduct, passed the house, and went into the heavy grove of trees nearby.  \"He's hungry,\" Elza declared. \"Jac, did you eat at the office tonight?\"  \"Yes,\" I said.  \"Did you really?\"  \"Some,\" I admitted. In truth the run up here had brought me a thoroughly hearty appetite, which I just realized.  \"I was pretty busy, you know,\" I added. \"Such a night--but don't you bother.\"  But she had already scurried away toward the house. Dear little Elza! I wished then, for the hundredth time, that I was a man of wealth--or at least, not as poor as a tower timekeeper. True, I made fair money--but the urge to spend it recklessly dominated me. I decided in that moment, to reform for good; and lay by enough to justify asking a woman to be my wife.  We reclined on a mossy bank in the grove of trees, so thick a grove that it hid the house from our sight.  The doctor extinguished the glowing lights with"]]]
