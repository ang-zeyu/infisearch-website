Assuredly, I am not presumptuous enough to suppose that this difficulty of fixing the precise scale between history and biography has been successfully overcome by me. It may be that Hercules himself would have succeeded little better.  Some may think in this connection that I have made the preponderance of politics excessive in the story of a genius of signal versatility, to whom politics were only one interest among many. No doubt speeches, debates, bills, divisions, motions, and manoeuvres of party, like the manna that fed the children of Israel in the wilderness, lose their savour and power of nutriment on the second day. Yet after all it was to his thoughts, his purposes, his ideals, his performances as statesman, in all the widest significance of that lofty and honourable designation, that Mr. Gladstone owes the lasting substance of his fame. His life was ever '_greatly absorbed_,' he said, '_in working the institutions of his country_.' Here we mark a signal trait. Not for two centuries, since the historic strife of anglican and puritan, had our island produced a ruler in whom the religious motive was paramount in the like degree. He was not only a political force but a moral force. He strove to use all the powers of his own genius and the powers of the state for moral purposes and religious. Nevertheless his mission in all its forms was action. He had none of that detachment, often found among superior minds, which we honour for its disinterestedness, even while we lament its impotence in result. The track in which he moved, the instruments that he employed, were the track and the instruments, the sword and the trowel, of political action; and what is called the Gladstonian era was distinctively a political era.  On this I will permit myself a few words more. The detailed history of Mr. Gladstone as theologian and churchman will not be found in these pages, and nobody is more sensible than their writer of the gap. Mr. Gladstone cared as much for the church as he cared for the state; he thought of the church as the soul of the state; he believed the attainment by the magistrate of the ends of government to depend upon religion; and he was sure that the strength of a state corresponds to the religious strength and soundness of the community of which the state is the civil organ. I should have been wholly wanting in biographical fidelity, not to make this clear and superabundantly clear. Still a writer inside Mr. Gladstone's church and in full and active sympathy with him on this side of mundane and supramundane things, would undoubtedly have treated the subject differently from any writer outside. No amount of candour or good faith--and in these essentials I believe that I have not fallen short--can be a substitute for the confidence and ardour of an adherent, in the heart of those to whom the church stands first. Here is one of the difficulties of this complex case. Yet here, too, there may be some trace of compensation. If the reader has been drawn into the whirlpools of the political Charybdis, he might not even in far worthier hands than mine have escaped the rocky headlands of the ecclesiastic Scylla. For churches also have their parties.  Lord Salisbury, the distinguished man who followed Mr. Gladstone in a longer tenure of power than his, called him 'a great Christian'; and nothing could be more true or better worth saying. He not only accepted the doctrines of that faith as he believed them to be held by his own communion; he sedulously strove to apply the noblest moralities of it to the affairs both of his own nation and of the commonwealth of nations. It was a supreme experiment. People will perhaps some day wonder that many of those who derided the experiment and reproached its author, failed to see that they were making manifest in this a wholesale scepticism as to truths that they professed to prize, far deeper and more destructive than the doubts and disbeliefs of the gentiles in the outer courts.  The epoch, as the reader knows, was what Mr. Gladstone called 'an agitated and expectant age.' Some stages of his career mark stages of the first importance in the history of English party, on which so much in the working of our constitution hangs. His name is associated with a record of arduous and fruitful legislative work and administrative improvement, equalled by none of the great men who have grasped the helm of the British state. The intensity of his mind, and the length of years through which he held presiding office, enabled him to impress for good in all the departments of government his own severe standard of public duty and personal exactitude. He was the chief force, propelling, restraining, guiding his country at many decisive moments. Then how many surprises and what seeming paradox. Devotedly attached to the church, he was the agent in the overthrow of establishment in one of the three kingdoms, and in an attempt to overthrow it in the Principality. Entering public life with vehement aversion to the recent dislodgment of the landed aristocracy as the mainspring of parliamentary power, he lent himself to two further enormously extensive changes in the constitutional centre of gravity. With a lifelong belief in parliamentary deliberation as the grand security for judicious laws and national control over executive act, he yet at a certain stage betook himself with magical result to direct and individual appeal to the great masses of his countrymen, and the world beheld the astonishing spectacle of a politician with the microscopic subtlety of a thirteenth century schoolman wielding at will the new democracy in what has been called 'the country of plain men.' A firm and trained economist, and no friend to socialism, yet by his legislation upon land in 1870 and 1881 he wrote the opening chapter in a volume on which many an unexpected page in the history of Property is destined to be inscribed. Statesmen do far less than they suppose, far less than is implied in their resounding fame, to augment the material prosperity of nations, but in this province Mr. Gladstone's name stands at the topmost height. Yet no ruler that ever lived felt more deeply the truth--for which I know no better words than Channing's--that to improve man's outward condition is not to improve man himself; this must come from each man's endeavour within his own breast; without that there can be little ground for social hope. Well was it said to him, 'You have so lived and wrought that you have kept the soul alive in England.' Not in England only was this felt. He was sometimes charged with lowering the sentiment, the lofty and fortifying sentiment, of national pride. At least it is a ground for national pride that he, the son of English training, practised through long years in the habit and tradition of English public life, standing for long years foremost in accepted authority and renown before the eye of England, so conquered imagination and attachment in other lands, that when the end came it was thought no extravagance for one not an Englishman to say, 'On the day that Mr. Gladstone died, the world has lost its greatest citizen.' The reader who revolves all this will know why I began by speaking of temerity.  That my book should be a biography without trace of bias, no reader will expect. There is at least no bias against the truth; but indifferent neutrality in a work produced, as this is, in the spirit of loyal and affectionate remembrance, would be distasteful, discordant, and impossible. I should be heartily sorry if there were no signs of partiality and no evidence of prepossession. On the other hand there is, I trust, no importunate advocacy or tedious assentation. He was great man enough to stand in need of neither. Still less has it been needed, in order to exalt him, to disparage others with whom he came into strong collision. His own funeral orations from time to time on some who were in one degree or another his antagonists, prove that this petty and ungenerous method would have been to him of all men most repugnant. Then to pretend that for sixty years, with all 'the varying weather of the mind,' he traversed in every zone the restless ocean of a great nation's shifting and complex politics, without many a faulty tack and many a wrong reckoning, would indeed be idle. No such claim is set up by rational men for Pym, Cromwell, Walpole, Washington, or either Pitt. It is not set up for any of the three contemporaries of Mr. Gladstone whose names live with the three most momentous transactions of his age--Cavour, Lincoln, Bismarck. To suppose, again, that in every one of the many subjects touched by him, besides exhibiting the range of his powers and the diversity of his interests, he made abiding contributions to thought and knowledge, is to ignore the jealous conditions under which such contributions come. To say so much as this is to make but a small deduction from the total of a grand account.  I have not reproduced the full text of Letters in the proportion customary in English biography. The existing mass of his letters is enormous. But then an enormous proportion of them touch on affairs of public business, on which they shed little new light. Even when he writes in his kindest and most cordial vein to friends to whom he is most warmly attached, it is usually a letter of business. He deals freely and genially with the points in hand, and then without play of gossip, salutation, or compliment, he passes on his way. He has in his letters little of that spirit in which his talk often abounded, of disengagement, pleasant colloquy, happy raillery, and all the other undefined things that make the correspondence of so many men whose business was literature, such delightful reading for the idler hour of an industrious day.

CHAPTER I                                CHILDHOOD                              (_1809-1821_)       I know not why commerce in England should not have its old      families, rejoicing to be connected with commerce from generation      to generation. It has been so in other countries; I trust it will      be so in this country.--GLADSTONE.   The dawn of the life of the great and famous man who is our subject in these memoirs has been depicted with homely simplicity by his own hand. With this fragment of a record it is perhaps best for me to begin our journey. 'I was born,' he says, 'on December 29, 1809,' at 62 Rodney Street, Liverpool. 'I was baptized, I believe, in the parish church of St. Peter. My godmother was my elder sister Anne, then just seven years old, who died a perfect saint in the beginning of the year 1829. In her later years she lived in close relations with me, and I must have been much worse but for her. Of my godfathers, one was a Scotch episcopalian, Mr. Fraser of ----, whom I hardly ever saw or heard of; the other a presbyterian, Mr. G. Grant, a junior partner of my father's.' The child was named William Ewart, after his father's friend, an immigrant Scot and a merchant like himself, and father of a younger William Ewart, who became member for Liverpool, and did good public service in parliament.       Before proceeding to the period of my childhood, properly      so-called, I will here insert a few words about my family. My      maternal grandfather was known as Provost Robertson of Dingwall, a      man held, I believe, in the highest respect. His wife was a      Mackenzie of [Coul]. His circumstances must have been good.       Of his three sons, one went into the army, and I recollect him as      Captain Robertson (I have a seal which he gave me, a three-sided      cairngorm. Cost him 7½ guineas). The other two took mercantile      positions. When my parents made a Scotch tour in 1820-21 with, I      think, their four sons, the freedom of Dingwall was presented to us      all,[1] with my father; and there was large visiting at the houses      of the Ross-shire gentry. I think the line of my grandmother was      stoutly episcopalian and Jacobite; but, coming outside the western      highlands, the first at least was soon rubbed down. The provost, I      think, came from a younger branch of the Robertsons of Struan.       On my father's side the matter is more complex. The history of the      family has been traced at the desire of my eldest brother and my      own, by Sir William Fraser, the highest living authority.[2] He has      carried us up to a rather remote period, I think before Elizabeth,      but has not yet been able to connect us with the earliest known      holders of the name, which with the aid of charter-chests he hopes      to do. Some things are plain and not without interest. They were a      race of borderers. There is still an old Gledstanes or Gladstone      castle. They formed a family in Sweden in the seventeenth century.      The explanation of this may have been that, when the union of the      crowns led to the extinction of border fighting they took service      like Sir Dugald Dalgetty under Gustavus Adolphus, and in this case      passed from service to settlement. I have never heard of them in      Scotland until after the Restoration, otherwise than as persons of      family. At that period there are traces of their having been fined      by public authority, but not for any ordinary criminal offence.      From this time forward I find no trace of their gentility. During      the eighteenth century they are, I think, principally traced by a      line of maltsters (no doubt a small business then) in Lanarkshire.      Their names are recorded on tombstones in the churchyard of Biggar.      I remember going as a child or boy to see the representative of      that branch, either in 1820 or some years earlier, who was a small      watchmaker in that town. He was of the same generation as my      father, but came, I understood, from a senior brother of the      family. I do not know whether his line is extinct. There also seem      to be some stray Gladstones who are found at Yarmouth and in      Yorkshire.[3]                                    ANCESTRY       My father's father seems from his letters to have been an excellent      man and a wise parent: his wife a woman of energy. There are      pictures of them at Fasque, by Raeburn. He was a merchant, in      Scotch phrase; that is to say, a shopkeeper dealing in corn and      stores, and my father as a lad served in his shop. But he also sent      a ship or ships to the Baltic; and I believe that my father, whose      energy soon began to outtop that of all the very large family, went      in one of these ships at a very early age as a supercargo, an      appointment then, I think, common. But he soon quitted a nest too      small to hold him. He was born in December 1764: and I have (at      Hawarden) a reprint of the _Liverpool Directory_ for 178-, in which      his name appears as a partner in the firm of Messrs. Corrie, corn      merchants.       Here his force soon began to be felt as a prominent and then a      foremost member of the community. A liberal in the early period of      the century, he drew to Mr. Canning, and brought that statesman as      candidate to Liverpool in 1812, by personally offering to guarantee      his expenses at a time when, though prosperous, he could hardly      have been a rich man. His services to the town were testified by      gifts of plate, now in the possession of the elder lines of his      descendants, and by a remarkable subscription of six thousand      pounds raised to enable him to contest the borough of Lancaster,      for which he sat in the parliament of 1818.       At his demise, in December 1851, the value of his estate was, I      think, near £600,000. My father was a successful merchant, but      considering his long life and means of accumulation, the result      represents a success secondary in comparison with that of others      whom in native talent and energy he much surpassed. It was a large      and strong nature, simple though hasty, profoundly affectionate and      capable of the highest devotion in the lines of duty and of love. I      think that his intellect was a little intemperate, though not his      character. In his old age, spent mainly in retirement, he was our      constant [centre of] social and domestic life. My mother, a      beautiful and admirable woman, failed in health and left him a      widower in 1835, when she was 62.  He then turns to the records of his own childhood, a period that he regarded as closing in September 1821, when he was sent to Eton. He begins with one or two juvenile performances, in no way differing from those of any other infant,--_navita projectus humi_, the mariner flung by force of the waves naked and helpless ashore. He believes that he was strong and healthy, and came well through his childish ailments.       My next recollection belongs to the period of Mr. Canning's first      election for Liverpool, in the month of October of the year 1812.      Much entertaining went on in my father's house, where Mr. Canning      himself was a guest; and on a day of a great dinner I was taken      down to the dining room. I was set upon one of the chairs,      standing, and directed to say to the company 'Ladies and      gentlemen.'       I have, thirdly, a group of recollections which refer to Scotland.      Thither my father and mother took me on a journey which they made,      I think, in a post-chaise to Edinburgh and Glasgow as its principal      points. At Edinburgh our sojourn was in the Royal Hotel, Princes      Street. I well remember the rattling of the windows when the castle      guns were fired on some great occasion, probably the abdication of      Napoleon, for the date of the journey was, I think, the spring of      1814.                              EARLY RECOLLECTIONS       In this journey the situation of Sanquhar, in a close Dumfriesshire      valley, impressed itself on my recollection. I never saw Sanquhar      again until in the autumn of 1863 (as I believe). As I was whirled      along the Glasgow and South-Western railway I witnessed just      beneath me lines of building in just such a valley, and said that      must be Sanquhar, which it was. My local memory has always been      good and very impressible by scenery. I seem to myself never to      have forgotten a scene.       I have one other early recollection to record. It must, I think,      have been in the year 1815 that my father and mother took me with      them on either one or two more journeys. The objective points were      Cambridge and London respectively. My father had built, under the      very niggard and discouraging laws which repressed rather than      encouraged the erection of new churches at that period, the church      of St. Thomas at Seaforth, and he wanted a clergyman for it.[4]      Guided in these matters very much by the deeply religious temper of      my mother, he went with her to Cambridge to obtain a recommendation      of a suitable person from Mr. Simeon, whom I saw at the time.[5] I      remember his appearance distinctly. He was a venerable man, and      although only a fellow of a college, was more ecclesiastically got      up than many a dean, or even here and there, perhaps, a bishop of      the present less costumed if more ritualistic period. Mr. Simeon, I      believe,"]]]
