The latter examined it carefully and       deposited it in his pocket-book; then, unlocking an escritoire,       took thence a letter and gave it to the Prefect. This functionary       grasped it in a perfect agony of joy, opened it with a trembling       hand, cast a rapid glance at its contents, and then, scrambling       and struggling to the door, rushed at length unceremoniously from       the room and from the house, without having uttered a syllable       since Dupin had requested him to fill up the check.        When he had gone, my friend entered into some explanations.        “The Parisian police,” he said, “are exceedingly able in their       way. They are persevering, ingenious, cunning, and thoroughly       versed in the knowledge which their duties seem chiefly to       demand. Thus, when G—— detailed to us his mode of searching the       premises at the Hotel D——, I felt entire confidence in his having       made a satisfactory investigation—so far as his labors extended.”        “So far as his labors extended?” said I.        “Yes,” said Dupin. “The measures adopted were not only the best       of their kind, but carried out to absolute perfection. Had the       letter been deposited within the range of their search, these       fellows would, beyond a question, have found it.”        I merely laughed—but he seemed quite serious in all that he said.        “The measures, then,” he continued, “were good in their kind, and       well executed; their defect lay in their being inapplicable to       the case, and to the man. A certain set of highly ingenious       resources are, with the Prefect, a sort of Procrustean bed, to       which he forcibly adapts his designs. But he perpetually errs by       being too deep or too shallow for the matter in hand; and many a       schoolboy is a better reasoner than he. I knew one about eight       years of age, whose success at guessing in the game of ‘even and       odd’ attracted universal admiration. This game is simple, and is       played with marbles. One player holds in his hand a number of       these toys, and demands of another whether that number is even or       odd. If the guess is right, the guesser wins one; if wrong, he       loses one. The boy to whom I allude won all the marbles of the       school. Of course he had some principle of guessing; and this lay       in mere observation and admeasurement of the astuteness of his       opponents. For example, an arrant simpleton is his opponent, and,       holding up his closed hand, asks, ‘are they even or odd?’ Our       schoolboy replies, ‘odd,’ and loses; but upon the second trial he       wins, for he then says to himself, ‘the simpleton had them even       upon the first trial, and his amount of cunning is just       sufficient to make him have them odd upon the second; I will       therefore guess odd;’—he guesses odd, and wins. Now, with a       simpleton a degree above the first, he would have reasoned thus:       ‘This fellow finds that in the first instance I guessed odd, and,       in the second, he will propose to himself, upon the first       impulse, a simple variation from even to odd, as did the first       simpleton; but then a second thought will suggest that this is       too simple a variation, and finally he will decide upon putting       it even as before. I will therefore guess even;’—he guesses even,       and wins. Now this mode of reasoning in the schoolboy, whom his       fellows termed ‘lucky,’—what, in its last analysis, is it?”        “It is merely,” I said, “an identification of the reasoner’s       intellect with that of his opponent.”        “It is,” said Dupin; “and, upon inquiring of the boy by what       means he effected the thorough identification in which his       success consisted, I received answer as follows: ‘When I wish to       find out how wise, or how stupid, or how good, or how wicked is       any one, or what are his thoughts at the moment, I fashion the       expression of my face, as accurately as possible, in accordance       with the expression of his, and then wait to see what thoughts or       sentiments arise in my mind or heart, as if to match or       correspond with the expression.’ This response of the schoolboy       lies at the bottom of all the spurious profundity which has been       attributed to Rochefoucault, to La Bougive, to Machiavelli, and       to Campanella.”        “And the identification,” I said, “of the reasoner’s intellect       with that of his opponent, depends, if I understand you aright,       upon the accuracy with which the opponent’s intellect is       admeasured.”        “For its practical value it depends upon this,” replied Dupin;       “and the Prefect and his cohort fail so frequently, first, by       default of this identification, and, secondly, by       ill-admeasurement, or rather through non-admeasurement, of the       intellect with which they are engaged. They consider only their       own ideas of ingenuity; and, in searching for anything hidden,       advert only to the modes in which they would have hidden it. They       are right in this much—that their own ingenuity is a faithful       representative of that of the mass; but when the cunning of the       individual felon is diverse in character from their own, the       felon foils them, of course. This always happens when it is above       their own, and very usually when it is below. They have no       variation of principle in their investigations; at best, when       urged by some unusual emergency—by some extraordinary reward—they       extend or exaggerate their old modes of practice, without       touching their principles. What, for example, in this case of       D——, has been done to vary the principle of action? What is all       this boring, and probing, and sounding, and scrutinizing with the       microscope and dividing the surface of the building into       registered square inches—what is it all but an exaggeration of       the application of the one principle or set of principles of       search, which are based upon the one set of notions regarding       human ingenuity, to which the Prefect, in the long routine of his       duty, has been accustomed? Do you not see he has taken it for       granted that all men proceed to conceal a letter,—not exactly in       a gimlet hole bored in a chair-leg—but, at least, in some       out-of-the-way hole or corner suggested by the same tenor of       thought which would urge a man to secrete a letter in a       gimlet-hole bored in a chair-leg? And do you not see also, that       such recherchés nooks for concealment are adapted only for       ordinary occasions, and would be adopted only by ordinary       intellects; for, in all cases of concealment, a disposal of the       article concealed—a disposal of it in this recherché manner,—is,       in the very first instance, presumable and presumed; and thus its       discovery depends, not at all upon the acumen, but altogether       upon the mere care, patience, and determination of the seekers;       and where the case is of importance—or, what amounts to the same       thing in the political eyes, when the reward is of magnitude,—the       qualities in question have never been known to fail. You will now       understand what I meant in suggesting that, had the purloined       letter been hidden any where within the limits of the Prefect’s       examination—in other words, had the principle of its concealment       been comprehended within the principles of the Prefect—its       discovery would have been a matter altogether beyond question.       This functionary, however, has been thoroughly mystified; and the       remote source of his defeat lies in the supposition that the       Minister is a fool, because he has acquired renown as a poet. All       fools are poets; this the Prefect feels; and he is merely guilty       of a non distributio medii in thence inferring that all poets are       fools.”        “But is this really the poet?” I asked. “There are two brothers,       I know; and both have attained reputation in letters. The       Minister I believe has written learnedly on the Differential       Calculus. He is a mathematician, and no poet.”        “You are mistaken; I know him well; he is both. As poet and       mathematician, he would reason well; as mere mathematician, he       could not have reasoned at all, and thus would have been at the       mercy of the Prefect.”        “You surprise me,” I said, “by these opinions, which have been       contradicted by the voice of the world. You do not mean to set at       naught the well-digested idea of centuries. The mathematical       reason has long been regarded as the reason par excellence.”        “‘Il y a à parièr,’” replied Dupin, quoting from Chamfort, “‘que       toute idée publique, toute convention reçue est une sottise, car       elle a convenue au plus grand nombre.’ The mathematicians, I       grant you, have done their best to promulgate the popular error       to which you allude, and which is none the less an error for its       promulgation as truth. With an art worthy a better cause, for       example, they have insinuated the term ‘analysis’ into       application to algebra. The French are the originators of this       particular deception; but if a term is of any importance—if words       derive any value from applicability—then ‘analysis’ conveys       ‘algebra’ about as much as, in Latin, ‘ambitus’ implies       ‘ambition,’ ‘_religio_’ ‘religion,’ or ‘_homines honesti_’ a set       of _honorable_ men.”        “You have a quarrel on hand, I see,” said I, “with some of the       algebraists of Paris; but proceed.”        “I dispute the availability, and thus the value, of that reason       which is cultivated in any especial form other than the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2149"],["title","The Works of Edgar Allan Poe — Volume 3 (#1)"],["body","  night was very clear and cold. Augustus had taken the helm, and I       stationed myself by the mast, on the deck of the cuddy. We flew       along at a great rate—neither of us having said a word since       casting loose from the wharf. I now asked my companion what       course he intended to steer, and what time he thought it probable       we should get back. He whistled for a few minutes, and then said       crustily: “_I_ am going to sea—_you_ may go home if you think       proper.” Turning my eyes upon him, I perceived at once that, in       spite of his assumed _nonchalance_, he was greatly agitated. I       could see him distinctly by the light of the moon—his face was       paler than any marble, and his hand shook so excessively that he       could scarcely retain hold of the tiller. I found that something       had gone wrong, and became seriously alarmed. At this period I       knew little about the management of a boat, and was now depending       entirely upon the nautical skill of my friend. The wind, too, had       suddenly increased, as we were fast getting out of the lee of the       land—still I was ashamed to betray any trepidation, and for       almost half an hour maintained a resolute silence. I could stand       it no longer, however, and spoke to Augustus about the propriety       of turning back. As before, it was nearly a minute before he made       answer, or took any notice of my suggestion. “By-and-by,” said he       at length—“time enough—home by-and-by.” I had expected a similar       reply, but there was something in the tone of these words which       filled me with an indescribable feeling of dread. I again looked       at the speaker attentively. His lips were perfectly livid, and       his knees shook so violently together that he seemed scarcely       able to stand. “For God’s sake, Augustus,” I screamed, now       heartily frightened, “what ails you?—what is the matter?—what       _are_ you going to do?” “Matter!” he stammered, in the greatest       apparent surprise, letting go the tiller at the same moment, and       falling forward into the bottom of the boat—“matter—why, nothing       is the—matter—going home—d—d—don’t you see?” The whole truth now       flashed upon me. I flew to him and raised him up. He was       drunk—beastly drunk—he could no longer either stand, speak, or       see. His eyes were perfectly glazed; and as I let him go in the       extremity of my despair, he rolled like a mere log into the       bilge-water, from which I had lifted him. It was evident that,       during the evening, he had drunk far more than I suspected, and       that his conduct in bed had been the result of a       highly-concentrated state of intoxication—a state which, like       madness, frequently enables the victim to imitate the outward       demeanour of one in perfect possession of his senses. The       coolness of the night air, however, had had its usual effect—the       mental energy began to yield before its influence—and the       confused perception which he no doubt then had of his perilous       situation had assisted in hastening the catastrophe. He was now       thoroughly insensible, and there was no probability that he would       be otherwise for many hours.        It is hardly possible to conceive the extremity of my terror. The       fumes of the wine lately taken had evaporated, leaving me doubly       timid and irresolute. I knew that I was altogether incapable of       managing the boat, and that a fierce wind and strong ebb tide       were hurrying us to destruction. A storm was evidently gathering       behind us; we had neither compass nor provisions; and it was       clear that, if we held our present course, we should be out of       sight of land before daybreak. These thoughts, with a crowd of       others equally fearful, flashed through my mind with a       bewildering rapidity, and for some moments paralyzed me beyond       the possibility of making any exertion. The boat was going       through the water at a terrible rate—full before the wind—no reef       in either jib or mainsail—running her bows completely under the       foam. It was a thousand wonders she did not broach to—Augustus       having let go the tiller, as I said before, and I being too much       agitated to think of taking it myself. By good luck, however, she       kept steady, and gradually I recovered some degree of presence of       mind. Still the wind was increasing fearfully, and whenever we       rose from a plunge forward, the sea behind fell combing over our       counter, and deluged us with water. I was so utterly benumbed,       too, in every limb, as to be nearly unconscious of sensation. At       length I summoned up the resolution of despair, and rushing to       the mainsail let it go by the run. As might have been expected,       it flew over the bows, and, getting drenched with water, carried       away the mast short off by the board. This latter accident alone       saved me from instant destruction. Under the jib only, I now       boomed along before the wind, shipping heavy seas occasionally       over the counter, but relieved from the terror of immediate       death. I took the helm, and breathed with greater freedom as I       found that there yet remained to us a chance of ultimate escape.       Augustus still lay senseless in the bottom of the boat; and as       there was imminent danger of his drowning (the water being nearly       a foot deep just where he fell), I contrived to raise him       partially up, and keep him in a sitting position, by passing a       rope round his waist, and lashing it to a ringbolt in the deck of       the cuddy. Having thus arranged every thing as well as I could in       my chilled and agitated condition, I recommended myself to God,       and made up my mind to bear whatever might happen with all the       fortitude in my power.        Hardly had I come to this resolution, when, suddenly, a loud and       long scream or yell, as if from the throats of a thousand demons,       seemed to pervade the whole atmosphere around and above the boat.       Never while I live shall I forget the intense agony of terror I       experienced at that moment. My hair stood erect on my head—I felt       the blood congealing in my veins—my heart ceased utterly to beat,       and without having once raised my eyes to learn the source of my       alarm, I tumbled headlong and insensible upon the body of my       fallen companion.        I found myself, upon reviving, in the cabin of a large       whaling-ship (the Penguin) bound to Nantucket. Several persons       were standing over me, and Augustus, paler than death, was busily       occupied in chafing my hands. Upon seeing me open my eyes, his       exclamations of gratitude and joy excited alternate laughter and       tears from the rough-looking personages who were present. The       mystery of our being in existence was now soon explained. We had       been run down by the whaling-ship, which was close-hauled,       beating up to Nantucket with every sail she could venture to set,       and consequently running almost at right angles to our own       course. Several men were on the look-out forward, but did not       perceive our boat until it was an impossibility to avoid coming       in contact—their shouts of warning upon seeing us were what so       terribly alarmed me. The huge ship, I was told, rode immediately       over us with as much ease as our own little vessel would have       passed over a feather, and without the least perceptible       impediment to her progress. Not a scream arose from the deck of       the victim—there was a slight grating sound to be heard mingling       with the roar of wind and water, as the frail bark which was       swallowed up rubbed for a moment along the keel of her       destroyer—but this was all. Thinking our boat (which it will be       remembered was dismasted) some mere shell cut adrift as useless,       the captain (Captain E. T. V. Block, of New London) was for       proceeding on his course without troubling himself further about       the matter. Luckily, there were two of the look-out who swore       positively to having seen some person at our helm, and       represented the possibility of yet saving him. A discussion       ensued, when Block grew angry, and, after a while, said that “it       was no business of his to be eternally watching for egg-shells;       that the ship should not put about for any such nonsense; and if       there was a man run down, it was nobody’s fault but his own, he       might drown and be dammed” or some language to that effect.       Henderson, the first mate, now took the matter up, being justly       indignant, as well as the whole ship’s crew, at a speech evincing       so base a degree of heartless atrocity. He spoke plainly, seeing       himself upheld by the men, told the captain he considered him a       fit subject for the gallows, and that he would disobey his orders       if he were hanged for it the moment he set his foot on shore. He       strode aft, jostling Block (who turned pale and made no answer)       on one side, and seizing the helm, gave the word, in a firm       voice, Hard-a-lee! The men flew to their posts, and the ship went       cleverly about. All this had occupied nearly five minutes, and it       was supposed to be hardly within the bounds of possibility that       any individual could be saved—allowing any to have been on board       the boat. Yet, as the reader has seen, both Augustus and myself       were rescued; and our deliverance seemed to have been brought       about by two of those almost inconceivable pieces of good fortune       which are attributed by the wise and pious to the special       interference of Providence.        While the ship was yet in stays, the mate lowered the jolly-boat       and jumped into her with the very two men, I"]]]
