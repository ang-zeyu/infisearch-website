What an adorable cup, dear Miss Heredith! I love Chinese egg-shell porcelain, but this is simply beyond anything! It's----\"  \"Whatever induced Dolly Weyne to bury herself in the country?\" abruptly exclaimed a young woman with cropped hair and khaki uniform. \"She loathed the country before she was married.\"  \"Mrs. Weyne is a wife, and it is her duty to like her husband's home,\" said Miss Heredith a little primly. She disapproved of the speaker, whose khaki uniform, close-cropped hair, crossed legs, and arms a-kimbo struck her as everything that was modern and unwomanly.  \"Then what induced Teddy Weyne to bury himself alive in the wilds? I'm sure it must be terrible living up there alone, with nothing but earwigs and owls for company.\"  \"Mr. Weyne is a writer,\" rejoined Miss Heredith. \"He needs seclusion.\"  \"My husband doesn't,\" said a little fair-haired woman. \"He says newspaper men can write anywhere. And we know another writer, a Mr. Harland, I think his name is, who writes long articles in the Sunday newspapers----\"  \"I don't think his name is Harland, dear,\" interrupted another lady. \"Something like it, but not Harland. Dear me, what is it?\"  \"Oh, the name doesn't matter,\" retorted her friend. \"The point is that he writes long articles in his London office. Why can't Mr. Weyne do the same?\"  \"Mr. Weyne is a novelist--not a journalist. It's quite a different thing.\"  \"Is it?\" responded the other doubtfully. \"All writing is the same, isn't it? Harry says Mr. Harland's articles are dreadfully clever. He sometimes reads bits of them to me.\"  \"Mrs. Weyne feels a little lonely sometimes,\" said Miss Heredith. \"She has been looking forward to meeting Violet again. It will be pleasant for both of them to renew their acquaintance.\"  \"I should think she and Violet would get on well together,\" remarked the young lady with the short hair. \"They both have a good many tastes in common. Neither likes the country, for one thing.\" The other ladies looked at one another, and the speaker, realizing that she had been tactless, stopped abruptly. \"How is Violet?\" she added lamely. \"Do you think she will be well enough to go to-night?\"  \"I still hope she may be well enough to go,\" replied Miss Heredith. \"I will ask her presently. Will anyone have another cup of tea?\"  Nobody wanted any more tea. The meal was finished; but the groups of ladies at the little tables sat placidly talking, enjoying the peaceful surroundings and the afternoon sun. Some of the girls produced cigarette-cases, and lit cigarettes.  There was a sound of footsteps on the gravel walk. A tall, good-looking young officer was seen walking across the garden from the house. As he neared the tea-tables he smilingly raised a finger to his forehead in salute.  \"I've come to say good-bye,\" he announced.  The ladies clustered around him. It was evident from their manner that he was a popular figure among them. Several of the younger girls addressed him as \"Dick,\" and asked him to send them trophies from the front. The young officer held his own amongst them with laughing self-possession. When he had taken his farewell of them he approached Miss Heredith, and held out his hand with a deferential politeness which contrasted rather noticeably with the easy familiarity of his previous leave-taking.  \"I am sorry you are compelled to leave us, Captain Nepcote,\" said Miss Heredith, rising with dignity to accept his outstretched hand. \"Do you return immediately to the front?\"  \"To-night, I expect.\"  \"I trust you will return safely to your native land before long, crowned with victory and glory.\"  Captain Nepcote bowed in some embarrassment. Like the rest of his generation, he was easily discomposed by fine words or any display of the finer feelings. He was about twenty-eight, of medium height, clean-shaven, with clear-cut features, brown hair, and blue eyes. At the first glance he conveyed nothing more than an impression of a handsome young English officer of the familiar type turned out in thousands during the war; but as he stood there talking, a sudden ray of sunlight falling on his bared head revealed vague lines in the face and a suspicion of silver in the closely cropped hair, suggesting something not altogether in keeping with his debonair appearance--secret trouble or dissipation, it was impossible to say which.  \"Will you say good-bye to Mrs. Heredith for me?\" he said, after a slight pause. \"I hope she will soon be better. I have said good-bye to Sir Philip and Phil. Sir Philip wanted to drive me to the station, but I know something of the difficulties of getting petrol just now, and I wouldn't allow him. Awfully kind of him! Phil suggested walking down with me, but I thought it would be too much for him.\"  They had walked away from the tea-tables towards the bridge which spanned the entrance to the moat-house. Miss Heredith paused by two brass cannon, which stood on the lawn in a clump of ornamental foliage, with an inscription stating that they had been taken from the _Passe-partout_, a French vessel captured by Admiral Heredith in the Indian Seas in 1804.  \"It is hard for Phil, a Heredith, to remain behind when all young Englishmen are fighting for their beloved land,\" she said softly, her eyes fixed upon these obsolete pieces of ordnance. \"He comes of a line of great warriors. However,\" she went on, in a more resolute tone, \"Phil has his duties to fulfil, in spite of his infirmity. We all have our duties, thank God. Good-bye, Captain Nepcote. I am keeping you, and you may miss your train.\"  \"Good-bye, Miss Heredith. Thank you so much for your kindness during a very pleasant visit. I've enjoyed myself awfully.\"  \"I am glad that you have enjoyed your stay. I hope you will come and see us again when your military duties permit.\"  \"Er--yes. Thank you awfully. Thank you once more for your kindness.\"  The young officer uttered these polite platitudes of a guest's farewell with some abruptness, bowed once more, and turned away across the old stone bridge which spanned the moat.     CHAPTER II   Miss Heredith turned her steps towards the house. The guests had dispersed while she was saying farewell to Captain Nepcote, and nothing further was expected of her as a hostess until dinner-time. It was her daily custom to devote a portion of the time between tea and dinner to superintending the arrangements for the latter meal. The moat-house possessed a competent housekeeper and an excellent staff of servants, but Miss Heredith believed in seeing to things herself.  On her way to the house she caught sight of an under gardener clipping one of the ornamental terrace hedges on the south side of the house, and she crossed over to him. The man suspended his work as the great lady approached, and respectfully waited for her to speak.  \"Thomas,\" said Miss Heredith, \"go and tell Linton to have both motors and the carriage at the door by half-past seven this evening. And tell him, Thomas, that Platt had better drive the carriage.\"  The under gardener touched his cap and hastened away on his errand. Miss Heredith leisurely resumed her walk to the house, stopping occasionally to pluck up any weed which had the temerity to show its head in the trim flower-beds which dotted the wide expanse of lawn between the moat and the house. She entered the house through the porch door, and proceeded to the housekeeper's apartments.  Her knock at the door was answered by a very pretty girl, tall and dark, who flushed at the sight of Miss Heredith, and stood aside for her to enter. A middle-aged woman, with a careworn face and large grey eyes, dressed in black silk, was seated by the window sewing. She rose and came forward when she saw her visitor. She was Mrs. Rath, the housekeeper, and the pretty girl was her daughter.  \"How are you, Hazel?\" said Miss Heredith, offering her hand to the girl. \"It is a long time since I saw you. Why have you not been to see us lately?\"  The girl appeared embarrassed by the question. She hesitated, and then, as if reassured by Miss Heredith's gracious smile, murmured that she had been so busy that she had very little time to herself.  \"I thought they gave you an afternoon off every week at your place of employment,\" pursued Miss Heredith, seating herself in a chair which the housekeeper placed for her.  \"Not always,\" replied Hazel. \"At least, not lately. We have had such a lot of orders in.\"  \"Do you like the millinery business, Hazel?\"  \"Very much indeed, Miss Heredith.\"  \"Hazel is getting on nicely now,\" said her mother.  \"I am very glad to hear it,\" responded Miss Heredith, in the same gracious manner. \"You must come and see us oftener. I take a great interest in your welfare, Hazel. Now, Mrs. Rath.\"  There are faces which attract attention by the expression of the eyes, and the housekeeper's was one of them. Her face was thin, almost meagre, with sunken temples on which her greying hair was braided, but her large eyes were unnaturally bright, and had a strange look, at once timid and watchful. She now turned them on Miss Heredith as though she feared a rebuke.  \"Mrs. Rath,\" said Miss Heredith, \"I hope dinner will be served punctually at a quarter to seven this evening, as I arranged. And did you speak to cook about the poultry? She certainly should get more variety into her cooking.\"  \"It is rather difficult for her just now, with the food controller allowing such a small quantity of butcher's meat,\" observed Mrs. Rath. \"She really does her best.\"  \"She manages very well on the whole, but she has many resources, such as poultry and game, which are denied to most households.\"  When Miss Heredith emerged from the housekeeper's room a little later she was quite satisfied that the dinner was likely to be as good"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20546"],["title","The Hand in the Dark (#2)"],["body"," an arbitrary food controller would permit, and she ascended to her room to dress. In less than half an hour she reappeared, a rustling and dignified figure in black silk. She walked slowly along the passage from her room, and knocked at Mrs. Heredith's door.  \"Come in!\" cried a faint feminine voice within.  Miss Heredith opened the door gently, and entered the room. It was a spacious and ancient bedroom, with panelled walls and moulded ceiling. The Jacobean furniture, antique mirrors, and bedstead with silken drapings were in keeping with the room.  A girl of delicate outline and slender frame was lying on the bed. She was wearing a fashionable rest gown of soft silk trimmed with gold embroidery, her fair hair partly covered by a silk boudoir cap. By her side stood a small table, on which were bottles of eau-de-Cologne and lavender water, smelling salts in cut glass and silver, a gold cigarette case, and an open novel.  The girl sat up as Miss Heredith entered, and put her hands mechanically to her hair. Her fingers were loaded with jewels, too numerous for good taste, and amongst the masses of rings on her left hand the dull gold of the wedding ring gleamed in sober contrast. Her face was pretty, but too insignificant to be beautiful. She had large blue eyes under arching dark brows, small, regular features, and a small mouth with a petulant droop of the under lip. Her face was of the type which instantly attracts masculine attention. There was the lure of sex in the depths of the blue eyes, and provocativeness in the drooping lines of the petulant, slightly parted lips. There was a suggestion of meretriciousness in the tinted lips and the pretence of colour on the charming face. The close air of the room was drenched with the heavy atmosphere of perfumes, mingled with the pungent smell of cigarette smoke.  Miss Heredith took a seat by the bedside. The two women formed a striking contrast in types: the strong, rugged, practical country lady, and the fragile feminine devotee of beauty and personal adornment, who, in the course of time, was to succeed the other as the mistress of the moat-house. The difference went far beyond externals; there was a wide psychological gulf between them--the difference between a woman of healthy mind and calm, equable temperament, who had probably never bothered her head about the opposite sex, and a woman who was the neurotic product of a modern, nerve-ridden city; sexual in type, a prey to morbid introspection and restless desires.  The younger woman regarded Miss Heredith with a rather peevish glance of her large eyes. It was plain from the expression of her face that she disliked Miss Heredith and resented her intrusion, but it would have needed a shrewd observer to have deduced from Miss Heredith's face that her feeling towards her nephew's wife was one of dislike. There was nothing but constrained politeness in her voice as she spoke.  \"How is your head now, Violet? Are you feeling any better?\"  \"No. My head is perfectly rotten.\" As she spoke, the girl pushed off her boudoir cap, and smoothed back the thick, fair hair from her forehead, with an impatient gesture, as though she found the weight intolerable.  \"I am sorry you are still suffering. Will you be well enough to go to the Weynes' to-night?\"  \"I wouldn't dream of it. I wonder you can suggest it. It would only make me worse.\"  \"Of course I shall explain to Mrs. Weyne. That is, unless you would like me to stay and sit with you. I do not like you to be left alone.\"  \"There is not the slightest necessity for that,\" said Mrs. Heredith decisively. \"Do go. I can ring for Lisette to sit with me if I feel lonely.\"  \"Perhaps you would like Phil to remain with you?\" suggested Miss Heredith.  \"Oh, no! It would be foolish of him to stay away on my account. I want you all to go and enjoy yourselves, and not to fuss about me. At present I desire nothing so much as to be left alone.\"  \"Very well, then.\" Miss Heredith rose at this hint. \"Shall I send you up some dinner?\"  \"No, thank you. The housekeeper has just sent me some strong tea and dry toast. If I feel hungry later on I'll ring. But I shall try and sleep now.\"  \"Then I will leave you. I have ordered dinner a little earlier than usual.\"  \"What time is it now?\" Violet listlessly looked at her jewelled wrist-watch as she spoke. \"A quarter-past six--is that the right time?\"  Miss Heredith consulted her own watch, suspended round her neck by a long thin chain.  \"Yes, that is right.\"  \"What time are you having dinner?\"  \"A quarter to seven.\"  \"What's the idea of having it earlier?\" asked the girl, propping herself up on her pillow with a bare white arm, and looking curiously at Miss Heredith.  \"I have arranged for us to leave for the Weynes' at half-past seven. It is a long drive.\"  \"I see.\" The girl nodded indifferently, as though her curiosity on the subject had subsided as quickly as it had arisen. \"Well, I hope you will all have a good time.\" She yawned, and let her fair head fall back on the pillow. \"Now I shall try and have a sleep. Please tell Phil not to disturb me. Tell him I've got one of my worst headaches. You are sure to be back late, and I don't want to be awakened.\"  She closed her eyes, and Miss Heredith turned to leave the room. As she passed the dressing-table her eyes fell upon a handsome jewel-case. As if struck by a sudden thought, she turned back to the bedside again.  \"Violet,\" she said.  The girl half opened her eyes, and looked up at the elder woman from veiled lids. \"Yes?\" she murmured.  \"Your necklace--I had almost forgotten. Mr. Musard goes back to town early in the morning, and he wishes to take it with him.\"  \"Oh, it will have to wait until the morning. I don't know where the keys are, and I can't be bothered looking for them now.\" The girl turned her face determinedly away, and buried her head in the pillow, like a spoilt child.  Miss Heredith flushed slightly at the deliberate rudeness of the action, but did not press the request. She left the room, softly closing the door behind her. She walked slowly along the wide passage, hung with bugle tapestry, and paused for a while at a narrow window at the end of the gallery, looking out on the terrace gardens and soft green landscape beyond. The interview with her nephew's wife had tried her, and her reflections were rather bitter. For the twentieth time she asked herself why her nephew had fallen in love with this unknown girl from London, who loathed the country. From Miss Heredith's point of view, a girl who smoked and talked slang lacked all sense of the dignity of the high position to which she had been called, and was in every way unfitted to become the mother of the next male Heredith, if, indeed, she consented to bear an heir at all. It was Miss Heredith's constant regret that Phil had not married some nice girl of the county, in his own station of life, instead of a London girl.  Miss Heredith terminated her reflections with a sigh, and turned away from the window. She was above all things practical, and fully realized the folly of brooding over the inevitable, but the marriage of her nephew was a sore point with her. She proceeded in her stately way down the broad and shallow steps of the old staircase, hung with armour and trophies and family portraits. At the bottom of the stairs she encountered a manservant bearing a tray with sherry decanters and biscuits across the hall.  \"Where is Mr. Philip?\" she asked.  \"I think he is in the billiard room, ma'am,\" the man replied.  Miss Heredith proceeded with rustling dignity to the billiard room. The click of billiard balls was audible before she reached it. The door was open, and inside the room several young men, mostly in khaki, were watching a game between a dark-haired man of middle age and a young officer. One or two of the men looked up as Miss Heredith entered, but the young officer went on stringing his break together with the mechanical skill of a billiard marker. Miss Heredith mentally characterized his action as another instance of the modern decay of manners. In her young days gentlemen always ceased playing when a lady entered the billiard room. The middle-aged player came forward, cue in hand, and asked her if she wanted anything.  \"I am looking for Phil,\" she said. \"I thought he was here.\"  \"He was, but he has just gone to the library. He said he had some letters to write before dinner.\"  \"Thank you.\" Miss Heredith turned away and walked to the library which, like the billiard room, was on the ground floor. She opened the door, and stepped into a large room with an interior which belonged to the middle ages. There was no intrusion of the twentieth-century in the great gloomy apartment with its faded arabesques and friezes, bronze candelabras, mediæval fittings, and heavy time-worn furniture.  The young man who sat writing at an ancient writing-table in the room was not out of harmony with the ancient setting. His face was of antique type--long, and narrow, and his long straight dark hair, brushed back from his brow, was in curious contrast to the close crop of a military generation of young men. His eyes were dark, and set rather deeply beneath a narrow high white forehead. He had the Heredith eyebrows and high-bridged nose; but, apart from those traditional features of his line, his rather intellectual face and slight frame had little in common with the portraits of the massive war-like Herediths which hung on the walls around him. He ceased writing and looked up as his aunt entered.  \"I have just been to see Violet,\" Miss Heredith explained. \"She says she is no better, and will not be able to accompany us to the Weynes' to-night. I suggested remaining with her, but she would not hear of it. She says she prefers to be alone. Do you think it is right to leave her? I should like to have your opinion. You understand her best, of course.\"  \"I think if Violet desires to be alone we cannot do better than study her wishes,\" replied Phil. \"I "]]]
