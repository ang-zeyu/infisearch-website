XL.--SOUND AND FURY.  A LADY, after performing, with the most brilliant execution, a sonato on the pianoforte, in the presence of Dr. Johnson, turning to the philosopher, took the liberty of asking him if he was fond of music? \"No, madam,\" replied the doctor; \"but of all _noises_, I think music is the least disagreeable.\"           XLI.--COME OF AGE.  A YOUNG man met a rival who was somewhat advanced in years, and, wishing to annoy him, inquired how old he was? \"I can't exactly tell,\" replied the other; \"but I can inform you that _an ass_ is older at twenty than a man at sixty!\"           XLII.--A STRIKING NOTICE.  THE following admonition was addressed by a Quaker to a man who was pouring forth a volley of ill language against him: \"Have a care, friend, thou mayest run _thy face_ against _my fist_.\"           XLIII.--UP IN THE WORLD.  A FELLOW boasting in company of his family, declared even his own father died in an exalted situation. Some of the company looking incredulous, another observed, \"I can bear testimony to the gentleman's veracity, as my father was sheriff for the county when his was _hanged_ for horse-stealing.\"           XLIV.--REVERSE OF CIRCUMSTANCES.  WHEN General V---- was quartered in a small town in Ireland, he and his lady were regularly besieged as they got into their carriage by an old beggar-woman, who kept her post at the door, assailing them daily with fresh importunities. One morning, as Mrs. V. stepped into the carriage, the woman began: \"Oh, my lady! success to your ladyship, and success to your honor's honor: for sure I did not _dream_ last night that her ladyship gave me a pound of tea, and your honor gave me a pound of tobacco.\"--\"My good woman,\" said the general, \"dreams go by the rule of contrary.\"--\"Do they so?\" rejoined the old woman; \"then it must mean, that your honor will give me _the tea_, and her ladyship _the tobacco_.\"           XLV.--A DOGGED ANSWER.  BOSWELL, dining one day with Dr. Johnson, asked him if he did not think that a good cook was more essential to the community than a good poet. \"I don't suppose,\" said the doctor, \"that there's a _dog_ in the town but what thinks so.\"           XLVI.--VISIBLE DARKNESS.  A GENTLEMAN at an inn, seeing that the lights were so dim as only to render the darkness visible, called out, \"Here, waiter, let me have a couple of _decent_ candles to _see_ how these others _burn_.\"           XLVII.--HIC-CUPPING.  A GENTLEMAN, at whose house Swift was dining in Ireland, after dinner introduced remarkably small hock-glasses, and at length turning to Swift addressed him: \"Mr. Dean, I shall be happy to take a glass of hic, h√¶c, hoc, with you.\"--\"Sir,\" rejoined the doctor, \"I shall be happy to comply, but it must be out of a _hujus_ glass.\"           XLVIII.--WORDS THAT BURN.  DR. ROBERTSON observed, that Johnson's jokes were the rebukes of the righteous, described in Scripture as being like excellent oil. \"Yes,\" exclaimed Burke, \"_oil of vitriol_!\"           XLIX.--PASSING THE BOTTLE.  FOOTE being in company, and the wine producing more riot than concord, he observed one gentleman so far gone in debate as to throw the bottle at his antagonist's head; upon which, catching the missile in his hand, he restored the harmony of the company by observing, that \"if _the bottle was passed so quickly_, not one of them would be able to stand out the evening.\"           L.--\"JUNIUS\" DISCOVERED.  MR. ROGERS was requested by Lady Holland to ask Sir Philip Francis whether he was the author of Junius. The poet approached the knight, \"Will you, Sir Philip,--will your kindness excuse my addressing to you a single question?\"--\"At your peril, sir!\" was the harsh and the laconic answer. The intimidated bard retreated to his friends, who eagerly asked him the result of his application. \"I don't know,\" he answered, \"whether he is _Junius_; but, if he be, he is certainly _Junius Brutus_.\"           LI.--A WEAK WOMAN.  A LOVING husband once waited on a physician to request him to prescribe for his wife's eyes, which were very sore. \"Let her wash them,\" said the doctor, \"every morning with a small glass of brandy.\" A few weeks after, the doctor chanced to meet the husband. \"Well, my friend, has your wife followed my advice?\"--\"She has done everything in her power to do it, doctor\"; said the spouse, \"but she never could get the glass _higher than her mouth_.\"           LII.--TOO MANY COOKS.  ELWES, the noted miser, used to say, \"If you keep one servant, your work is done; if you keep two, it is half done; and if you keep three, you may _do it yourself_.\"           LIII.--LOOK IN HIS FACE.  ADMIRAL LORD HOWE, when a captain, was once hastily awakened in the middle of the night by the lieutenant of the watch, who informed him with great agitation that the ship was on fire near the magazine. \"If that be the case,\" said he, rising leisurely to put on his clothes, \"we shall soon know it.\" The lieutenant flew back to the scene of danger, and almost instantly returning, exclaimed, \"You need not, sir, be afraid, the fire is extinguished.\"--\"Afraid!\" exclaimed Howe, \"what do you mean by that, sir? I never was afraid in my life\"; and looking the lieutenant full in the face, he added, \"Pray, how does a man feel, sir, when he is afraid? _I need not ask how he looks_.\"           LIV.--NOTHING BUT THE \"BILL.\"  JOHN HORNE TOOKE'S opinion upon the subject of law was admirable. \"Law,\" he said, \"ought to be, not a luxury for the rich, but a remedy, to be easily, cheaply, and speedily obtained by the poor.\" A person observed to him, how excellent are the English laws, because they are impartial, and our courts of justice are open to all persons without distinction. \"And so,\" said Tooke, \"is the _London Tavern_, to such as can afford to _pay for their entertainment_.\"           LV.--AN EXTINGUISHER.  WHILE Commodore Anson's ship, the Centurion, was engaged in close fight, with the rich Spanish galleon, which he afterwards took, a sailor came running to him, and cried out, \"Sir, our ship is on fire very near the powder magazine.\"--\"Then pray, friend,\" said the commodore, not in the least degree discomposed, \"_run back and assist in putting it out_.\"           LVI.--A BAD SHOT.  A COCKNEY being out one day amusing himself with shooting, happened to fire through a hedge, on the other side of which was a man standing. The shot passed through the man's hat, but missed the bird. \"Did you fire at me, sir?\" he hastily asked. \"O! no, sir,\" said the shrewd sportsman, \"I _never hit_ what I fire at.\"           LVII.--WISE PRECAUTION.  IT is related of the great Dr. Clarke, that when in one of his leisure hours he was unbending himself with a few friends in the most playful and frolicsome manner, he observed Beau Nash approaching; upon which he suddenly stopped: \"My boys,\" said he, \"let us be _grave_: here comes a _fool_.\"           LVIII.--A TRUMP CARD.  AT one of the Holland-house Sunday dinner-parties, a year or two ago, Crockford's Club, then forming, was talked of; and the noble hostess observed, that the female passion for diamonds was surely less ruinous than the rage for play among men. \"In short, you think,\" said Mr. Rogers, \"that _clubs_ are worse than _diamonds_.\" This joke excited a laugh; and when it had subsided, Sydney Smith wrote the following _impromptu_ sermonet--most appropriately _on a card_:--      Thoughtless that \"all that's brightest fades,\"     Unmindful of that _Knave of Spades_,       The Sexton and his Subs:     How foolishly we play our parts!     Our _wives_ on _diamonds_ set their _hearts_,       _We_ set our _hearts_ on _clubs_!           LIX.--MISTAKEN IDENTITY.  A PHYSICIAN attending a lady several times, had received a couple of guineas each visit; at last, when he was going away, she gave him but one; at which he was surprised, and looking on the floor, \"I believe, madam,\" said he, \"I have _dropt a guinea_.\"--\"No, sir,\" replied the lady, \"it is I that have _dropt it_.\"           LX.--ALONE IN HIS GLORY.  A FACETIOUS fellow having unwittingly offended a conceited puppy, the latter told him he was no \"gentleman.\"--\"Are _you_ a gentleman?\" asked the droll one. \"Yes, sir,\" bounced the fop. \"Then, I am very glad _I am not_,\" replied the other.           LXI.--A CAPITAL LETTER.  DR. LLOYD, Bishop of Worcester, so eminent for his prophecies, when by his solicitations and compliance at court he got removed from a poor Welsh bishopric to a rich English one, a reverend dean of the Church said, that he found his brother Lloyd spelt _Prophet_ with an F.           LXII.--A GOOD PARSON.  DR. HICKRINGAL, who was one of King Charles the Second's chaplains, whenever he preached before his Majesty, was sure to tell him of his faults from the pulpit. One day his Majesty met the doctor in the Mall, and said to him, \"Doctor, what have I done to you that you are always quarrelling with me?\"--\"I hope your Majesty is not angry with me,\" quoth the doctor, \"for telling the truth.\"--\"No, no,\" says the king, \"but I would have us for the future be friends.\"--\"Well, well,\" quoth the doctor, \"I will make it up with your Majesty on these terms,--as _you mend I'll mend_.\"           LXIII.--SUBTRACTION AND ADDITION.  A CHIMNEY-SWEEPER'S boy went into a baker's shop for a twopenny loaf, and conceiving it to be diminutive in size, remarked to the baker that he did not believe it was weight. \"Never mind that,\" said the man of dough, \"you will have _the less to carry_.\"--\"True,\" replied the lad, and throwing three half-pence on the counter"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20366"],["title","Wonderwings and other Fairy Stories (#1)"],["body","est. A third picture was of weavers making cloth. A cottage home came next, and a lordly mansion of the rich, and a homeless child seeking shelter under a city bridge. So scene followed scene, beautiful, or sad, or sordid, sometimes wild and violent, and sometimes gay and peaceful, showing in the main a people happy and content.  \"What is it?\" asked the amazed Queen-mother at last. \"How come these pictures here?\"  \"They are the life of my state reflected on this magic mirror for my help,\" replied the Queen. \"Long ago, when the first queen came to rule the new kingdom of Westroyal, the fairies brought this mirror and set it in the wall as here you see it. Faithfully ever since it has reflected the daily happenings through-out the land, the people's toil and pleasures, their dangers and their comforts and rewards. So each queen has known her country. Your son, looking in his mirror, sees but himself; I see the sufferings of my people and know what things they need, and so plainly are these pictures set before me that I cannot rest till I have used my power to give relief.\"  \"Oh!\" cried the Queen-mother, \"now I see why you are loved. How can I get such a mirror for my son?\"  \"That I know not,\" replied the Queen.  Then the Queen-mother returned sad at heart to the kingdom of her son, pondering on what she had seen.  Once again she walked in her garden alone. \"How shall I get such a mirror?\" she wondered. \"What should I do?\"  As once before, a voice replied \"I know! I know!\"  The Queen-mother looked over the garden wall. Hobbling along the road was the old woman who had bade her go to Westroyal. \"You who helped me before, help me again!\" cried the Queen-mother. \"I have obeyed you. How now shall I get a magic mirror for my son?\"  The old woman looked up at her. \"Go to the Deeps,\" she said, and she hobbled off.  Now this was a dreadful command to the Queen-mother, for the Deeps was a horrible black pool in the roughest and most dangerous part of the country. It was said to be formed of the country's tears and to be also bottomless, and to be haunted by beings of strange shape. There were stories of their mysterious power and evil ways. Yet go she must, if going meant the gaining of a magic mirror for her son. And she must go alone, for only so could any seeker find the pathway to the pool, so it was said.  \"I will go at once, before my courage fails,\" she said, and she left her sheltered garden and set off across the land.  She had many weary miles to travel, past villages and towns and fields, and she was footsore and faint when at last she reached the winding track that led between the darkening hills. Yet on she went, following the murmur of a tiny stream that dropped through thick-set bushes into a shadowed valley. On she went still, and now the darkness came, and she had lost her way. She stumbled over fallen logs, pushed with bleeding hands and torn clothes through bramble wildernesses, and found at last her way again to the narrow track beside the little stream that murmured in the dark.  On she went, and down. The stream suddenly widened into a round blackness open to the sky, but walled in by jagged rocks. It was the pool. Utterly spent through weariness and fear, she sank down among the rocks to rest, and waited there for what might come to her.  Strange rustlings sounded round the rocks, strange forms loomed close beside her, strange voices asked her: \"What are you? Why come you to our haunts?\" Though her heart was sick with dread she answered boldly in a firm clear voice. \"Give me a magic mirror for my son, that he may learn to rule.\"  There was a flash, and the pool and all the rocks were lit by a light brighter and softer than that of moon or stars. All round her stood the beings who had loomed so strangely in the darkness. They were fairies, exquisite in shape and fineness, robed in flowing gossamer of many colours. They smiled at her, and touched her with their gentle hands, and immediately she was well. \"Your love has brought you nobly through much fear and hurt,\" they said. \"You shall have your due reward. Look into the Deeps.\"  [Illustration: She rose into the air a shining queen of fairies, holding in her hands a tiny gleaming mirror.]  One took her hand and led her to the edge, and the Queen-mother, fearless and smiling now, looked down into the fathomless water of the pool. As she gazed, ripples came upon its surface. They broke away into shining cascades of diamonds and pearls, and between them appeared the face and shoulders of the old woman of the road. \"I have your magic mirror,\" she cried. \"It is formed of the lowest teardrops of the Deeps.\"  She sprang out and trod the water to the shore, and as she went her rags fell from her and she rose into the air a shining queen of fairies, more beautiful than any other there, holding in her hand a tiny gleaming mirror. \"Come,\" she said, \"let us set it in its place.\"  She touched the Queen-mother's hand, and in a flash they were all at the palace, within the young king's sleeping chamber of turquoise and gold. There as he lay asleep the fairies set the mirror in its place with magic words, and as it touched the wall it lengthened out and widened till it stood as large as that of the young queen across the border line. Over the polished glass began to float the pictures of the country's life. \"How can I show my gratitude?\" the Queen-mother asked; but the fairies were gone.  Next morning when the little king awoke he ran to see the fine new mirror in his room. He gazed and gazed upon the strange entrancing pictures that came on it, and every day he spent long hours at the mirror. And as he learned to recognise the hardships and the sufferings of his people his heart grew hot to give relief, and he was no more haughty, but used his power to ease their woes. So in Eastroyal as in Westroyal there was content, and the people loved their king and praised him through all his days until the end. And all the kings who followed after him ruled wisely and were loved.  [Illustration]  [Illustration: \"Look closely at my flowers,\" she said, \"and tell me which you think most beautiful.\"]     Fairy Tenderheart.   Little Fairy Tenderheart was weeping. She sat on a ledge that overlooked the world, and her tears fell fast. In twos and threes her sisters flew from Fairyland to put their arms about her, but none could comfort her. \"Come, dance and sing with us and forget your grief,\" they said. She shook her head. \"The terrible fighting!\" she said. \"See where far below men rage, killing each other. Rivers run red with blood, and the sorrow of weeping women rises through the air to where I sit. How can I dance and sing?\"  \"It is the world at war,\" said an older fairy sadly. \"I too have wept in earlier days when men have fought. But our tears are wasted, little sister. Come away.\"  Fairy Tenderheart looked eagerly at her. \"You who have watched the world so many years,\" she said, \"tell me why such dreadful deeds are done down there.\"  The older fairy bent her eyes on the blackened plains of earth. \"I cannot tell you that,\" she slowly said. \"We watch and pity, but we cannot know what works in the hearts of men that they should gather in their millions to destroy their brothers and themselves. No other creature turns on its own kind and kills so terribly as man.\"  [Illustration: In twos and threes her sisters flew from Fairyland to put their arms about her, but none could comfort her.]  \"What can we do? It must be stopped. What can we do?\"  \"We can do nothing, little sister. See where the women of the world stretch out their hands, imploring men to live in peace. They beg the lives of fathers, husbands, sons; they point to ruined homes and desolated lands. 'War wrecks our lives!' they cry. Yet even for those they love men will not give up battle. What, then, can fairies do? Tears are useless. Come away.\"  \"I must stay here. I must think of something I can do,\" said Fairy Tenderheart; and she would not go.  Her tears had stopped. She searched with anxious eyes across the world to find some means of helping men to better things, but no way could she find. And still the fighters shot and stabbed, and the dying and the dead lay piled upon the fields.  Another fairy flew to her. \"Come away, little sister!\" she said. \"I cannot bear to see you sorrowing. Come, or you will forget the merry ways of Fairyland and grow like the Oldest Fairy of All, who spends her life brooding over this dreary earth.\"  Fairy Tenderheart sprang up. \"Where is she? Tell me where to find her. Why did I not know of her before? I will go to her that we may be companions in our sorrow. Perhaps together we may find a way to help.\"  \"Ah, do not go. Listen! She is so old that she has watched the world since the beginning of wars, yet, as you see, she has found no way of stopping them. How then can you?\"  \"I must go.\"  \"She left our joyful Fairyland for a Magic Garden, and whoever enters that Garden can never come back to us. There she dwells for ever alone, at work or in thought, or preparing for her mysterious journeys to the earth. Do not go, or you too will be cut off from our life of dance and song, never to return.\"  \"I will go. Tell me the way.\"  The fairy flew off. \"I will not tell you,\" she said. \"You shall not go.\"  \"I will go,\" said Fairy Tenderheart again. With steadfast steps she searched through Fairyland until she found a narrow track that led between the winding mountains and far out across wide, shimmering plains. This track she followed till she came upon the Magic Garden.  The Oldest Fairy of All sat thinking among her flowers, and her eyes were filled with peace. She looked at Fairy Tenderheart standing at the gate. \"Who enters here can never return to Fairyland,\" she said, and her voice was sweeter than the songs of birds.  Fairy Tenderheart pushed open the gate and stepped within the Garden. \"Who enters here finds joy,\" said the Oldest Fairy of All, and a crown of happiness sat on her hair.  "]]]
