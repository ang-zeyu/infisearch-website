For some time he lay there in a state of half-consciousness until his strength began to revive; then he arose, thanking God in an audible voice as he did so, and carried the child to a spot which was sheltered in some degree by a mass of cliff from the blinding spray and furious gale.  Here he laid her with her face downwards on a grassy place, and proceeded to warm his benumbed frame.  Vitality was strong in the sailor.  It needed only a few seconds' working of the human machine to call it into full play.  He squeezed the water out of his jacket and trousers, and then slapped his arms across his chest with extreme violence, stamping his feet the while, so that he was speedily in a sufficiently restored condition to devote his attention with effect to the child, which still lay motionless on the grass.  He wrung the water out of her clothes, and chafed her feet, hands, and limbs, rapidly yet tenderly, but without success.  His anxiety while thus employed was very great; for he did not know the proper method to adopt in the circumstances, and he felt that if the child did not revive within a few minutes, all chance of her recovery would be gone.  The energy of his action and the anxiety of his mind had warmed his own frame into a glow.  It suddenly occurred to him that he might make use of this superabundant heat.  Opening the little frock in front, he placed the child's breast against his own, and held it there, while with his right hand he continued to chafe her limbs.  In a few minutes he felt a flutter of the heart, then a gentle sigh escaped from the blue lips; the eyelids quivered, and finally the child revived.  \"D'ye feel gettin' better, Emmie?\" said the man, in a low, soft voice.  A faint \"yes\" was all the reply.  The seaman continued his efforts to instil warmth into the little frame. Presently the same question was repeated, and the child looking up, said--  \"Is that 'oo, Gaff?\"  \"Ay, dear, 'tis me.\"  \"Where am I--where's mamma?\" inquired Emmie, looking round in some degree of alarm.  \"Hush, dear; don't speak just now.  I've just brought 'ee ashore fro' the wreck, an' am goin' to tak 'ee home.  Try to sleep, dear.\"  Gaff wrapped his jacket round the child, and hurried away in search of the highroad.  He knew the place well.  He had been wrecked on a reef within two miles of his native hamlet, and within three of the town of Wreckumoft.  He soon found the road, and broke from a fast walk into a run.  The child lay quietly in his arms, either being too much exhausted to speak, or having fallen asleep.  The man muttered to himself as if in perplexity--  \"It'll never do to tak 'er home wi' me.  She'd remember us, and that would let the secret out.  No, I'll tak 'er straight there.\"  Gaff reached his native village as he came to this resolve.  It was all astir.  Three ships had been cast on the rocks there within a hundred yards of each other.  The lifeboat was out; the rocket apparatus had that moment arrived from the neighbouring town, and was being dragged on its waggon through the village to the scene of danger.  All the men, and many of the women and children of the place, were on the beach, while eager groups of those who could not face the storm were collected in doorways and sheltered places, awaiting news from the shore.  Many of these had anxious faces, for they knew their kinsmen, the fishermen of the place, to be bold, daring fellows, who would not hesitate to risk life and limb to save a fellow-creature from death.  Stopping a moment at the outskirts of the village, Gaff laid down his burden, and tied a large blue cotton kerchief round his neck, so as to cover his mouth and chin.  By pulling his sou'wester cap well over his eyes, he concealed his face so effectually that little more than the point of his nose was visible.  Not satisfied, however, with his disguise, he climbed a fence and struck into a bypath, which enabled him to avoid the village altogether.  Setting off at a quick pace, he soon regained the highroad beyond the village, and did not pause until he came to a large iron gate which opened into the shrubbery in front of a handsome villa.  He went straight up to the front door and rang the bell.  Of course, at such an hour, the family had retired to rest, and it is probable that in ordinary circumstances Gaff would have had to wait a considerable time before an answer should have been given to his summons.  But on this night, the only son and heir of the family, Kenneth by name, knowing that wrecks were likely to occur on the coast, and being of a bold, romantic, restless disposition, had mounted his horse and ridden away, accompanied by his groom, in search of adventure.  The housekeeper of the family, usually styled Mrs Niven, being devotedly attached to this son and heir, had resolved to sit up all night and await his return.  Mrs Niven had prophesied confidently for the previous ten years, that \"Master Kenneth was certain to be drownded sooner or later, if 'e didn't come to die before;\" and being fully persuaded of the truth of her prophetic powers, she conscientiously waited for and expected the fulfilment of her own prophecy.  At the moment when Gaff rang the bell she was awaiting it in a chair in front of a good fire, with her feet on the fender and sound asleep.  It would be more correct to say that Mrs Niven was in a state of mixed sleep and suffocation, for her head hung over the back of the chair, and, being very stout, there was only just sufficient opening in the wind-pipe to permit of her breath passing stertorously through her wide-open mouth.  The first summons passed unheard; the second caused Mrs Niven to open her eyes and shut her mouth, but she could not rise by reason of a crick in her neck.  An angry shout, however, of \"why don't you answer the bell?\" from the master of the family, caused her to make a violent struggle, plunge her head into her lap, by way of counteracting the crick, rush up-stairs, and fling open the door.  \"I know'd it,\" exclaimed Mrs Niven wildly, on beholding a wet sailor with a bundle in his arms; \"I always said he would be--goodness me! it's only his trunk,\" she added in horror, on observing that the bundle was a rough jacket without head or legs!  \"Clap a stopper on your jaw, woman,\" said Gaff impatiently.  \"Is this Seaside Villa--Mr Stuart's?\"  \"It is,\" replied Mrs Niven, trembling violently.  Gaff quickly removed the jacket, kissed the child's pale cheek, and laid her in Mrs Niven's ready arms.  \"She ain't dead surely, sir?\" inquired the housekeeper.  \"No, bin saved from a wreck an' half drownded!  She'll come to in a bit--tak' care of 'er.\"  Gaff turned on his heel as he hastily uttered these words, ran down the garden walk and disappeared, leaving Mrs Niven standing at the open door in a state of speechless amazement, with the unconscious Emmie in her arms and pressed, by reason of an irresistible impulse of motherly sympathy, to her bosom.    CHAPTER THREE.  THE COTTAGE AT COVE INVADED--DAN HORSEY SPEAKS \"TOORKO\" TO RUSSIANS, AND FAILS TO ENLIGHTEN THEM.  Retracing his steps hastily to the village of Cove, Stephen Gaff sought out his own humble cottage, which, during his absence on his frequent voyages, was left under the charge of his fisherman brother-in-law, John Furby.  Presenting himself at the door, he created the family sensation which has been described at the end of the first chapter.  The first violent demonstrations of surprise and joy over, Mrs Gaff dragged her husband into a small closet, which was regarded by the household in the light of a spare room, and there compelled him to change his garments.  While this change was being made the volatile Bu'ster, indignant at being bolted out, kicked the door with his heel until he became convinced that no good or evil could result from the process.  Then his active mind reverted to the forbidden loaf, and he forthwith drew a chair below the shelf on which it lay.  Upon the chair he placed a three-legged stool, and upon the stool an eight-inch block, which latter being an unstable foundation, caused Billy to lose his balance when he got upon it.  The erection instantly gave way, and fell with a hideous crash.  Tottie, who stood near, gazing at her brother's misdeeds, as was her wont, in awe-stricken admiration, was overwhelmed in the debris.  Nothing daunted, the Bu'ster \"returned to the charge,\" and fell a second time,--with the loaf, however, in his arms.  \"Hah!\" exclaimed Mrs Gaff, issuing from the spare room, and rushing at her offspring with uplifted hand.  \"Stop, lass,\" said Stephen, arresting her, and catching up the boy, whom he placed on his knee as he sat down in a chair beside the fire.  \"How are 'ee, Billy, my lad?\"  Billy, glaring defiance at his mother, who returned the glare with interest in the shape of a united shake of the fist and head, replied that he was \"fuss'rate.\"  Tottie having immediately claimed, and been put in possession of the other knee, divided her father's attention, and while the goodwife busied herself in preparing the supper, which had been originally intended for \"Uncle John,\" a quick fire of question and reply of the most varied and unconnected sort was kept up by the trio at the fire, in tones, and accompanied by hugs and gestures, which proved beyond all doubt that Stephen Gaff was a father of the right kind, and that the little ones hailed him as an inestimable addition to their household joys.  It would be unjust to Mrs Gaff were I to permit the reader to suppose that she was a disagreeable contrast to the father.  She was true-hearted and loving, but she had been born and bred in the midst of a class of people whose manners are as rough as their calling, and was by no means tender or considerate.  A terrific scream, or a knock-down slap, from Mrs Gaff, was regarded both by giver and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21703"],["title","Silver Lake (#1)"],["body","stormy day when the poor Indian's strength finally broke down.  Hitherto he had pushed forward with some degree of hope, but on the morning of this day a broken branch caught his snow-shoe and tripped him.  At any other time the fall would have been a trifle, but in his weak condition it acted like the last straw which breaks the camel's back.  Wapaw rose with difficulty, and brushing the snow from his eyes, looked earnestly at his snow-shoes, well knowing that if they had been broken in the fall his power of advancing would have been taken away and his fate sealed, for he had neither strength nor energy left to repair them.  They were uninjured, however; so he once more attempted to stagger on.  A slight rising ground lay before him.  To ascend this was a labour so great that he almost sank in the midst of it.  He reached the top, however, and gazed eagerly before him.  He had gazed thus at the top of every rising ground that he had reached during the last two days, in the hope of seeing some sign of the Fort.  A deep sigh escaped him as he rested his hands on the muzzle of his gun, and his grave countenance was overspread with a look of profound melancholy.  For the first time in his life, the once stout and active Wapaw had reached the point of giving way to despair.  A wide open plain stretched out before him.  The cold wind was howling wildly across it, driving the keen snow-drift before it in whirling clouds.  Even a strong man might have shrunk from exposing himself on such a plain and to such a blast on that bitter arctic day.  Wapaw felt that, in his case, to cross it would be certain death; so, with the calm philosophy of a Red Indian, he made up his mind to lay him down and die!  His manner of preparing for his end was somewhat singular.  Turning aside into the woods, he set about making an encampment with as much vigour as he could summon up.  Clearing away the snow from the roots of a large spreading pine-tree, he strewed branches on the ground, and thus made a rude couch.  On this he spread his blanket.  Then he cut some firewood with the axe that hung at his side, and soon kindled, by means of flint, steel, and tinder, a good fire.  Seating himself before the warm blaze, the exhausted man rested awhile, with his legs drawn together and his head resting on his knees.  He sat so long thus that he nearly fell asleep.  Presently he roused himself, and proceeded to make a close examination of his wallet and firebag--the latter being a beautifully ornamented pouch, which Indians and fur-traders wear at their belts, for the purpose of containing the materials for producing fire, besides pipes and tobacco.  Poor Wapaw had already searched his wallet and firebag twice, without finding a crumb of food or a morsel of tobacco.  He knew well that they were empty, yet he turned them inside out, and examined the seams and corners with as much earnestness as if he really expected to find relief from his sufferings there.  There was no expression of pain on the red man's face--only a look of profound melancholy.  He laid aside the firebag after a little while, and then quietly drew his knife, and cut a piece of leather from the skirt of his hunting coat.  The leather had been dried and smoked, and contained no substance whatever that could sustain life.  Wapaw was aware of this--nevertheless he singed a portion of it until it was reduced almost to ashes, and mingling a little snow with this, ate it greedily.  Then, raising his eyes to the sky with a long earnest gaze, he sat immovable, until the sinking fire and the increasing cold recalled his wandering faculties.  There was a wild, glassy look about the Indian's eyes now, which probably resulted from exhaustion.  He seemed to struggle several times to rouse himself before he succeeded; shuddering with intense cold, he crept to the little pile of firewood, and placed several billets on the fire, which speedily blazed up again, and the dying man cowered over it, regardless of the smoke which ever and anon wreathed round his drooping head.  In a few minutes Wapaw started up as if new energy had been infused into him.  He placed his gun, axe, firebag, and powder-horn by themselves on the ground; then he wrapped himself in his blanket and lay slowly down beside them with his feet towards the fire.  For a few minutes he lay on his back, gazing earnestly upwards, while his lips moved slowly, but no sound issued from them.  Then he turned wearily on his side, and, covering his head with the blanket and turning his face towards the ground, he resigned himself to death.  But God had ordained that, at that time, the red man should not die.  About the time when he lay down, our hunters emerged upon the plain which had caused the Indian to despair.  \"It's of no use goin' farther,\" observed Robin, as he and his companions stood at the edge of the forest and looked across the plain; \"the wind blows too hard, and the drift is keen; besides there ain't much to be got hereaway, even in seasons of plenty.\"  \"Father! is that smoke risin' over the bluff yonder?\" asked Roy, pointing with his finger as he spoke.  \"No doubt of it, lad.\"  \"Indians, may be,\" said Walter.  Robin shook his head.  \"Don't think so,\" said he, \"for the redskins don't often come to see me at this time o' the year.  But we'll go see; an' look to your primin', lads--if it's a war-party we'll ha' to fight, mayhap, if we don't run.\"  The three hunters crossed the plain in the teeth of the howling drift, and cautiously approached the bluff referred to by Roy, and from behind which the smoke ascended.  \"It's a camp fire,\" whispered Robin, as he glanced back at his companions, \"but I see no one there.  They must have just left the place.\"  There was a shade of anxiety in the hunter's voice as he spoke, for he thought of Fort Enterprise, its defenceless condition, and the possibility of the Indians having gone thither.  \"They can't have gone to the Fort,\" said Walter, \"else we should have seen their tracks on the way hither.\"  \"Come,\" said Robin, stepping forward quickly, \"we can see their tracks now, anyhow, and follow them up, and if they lead to the Fort.\"  The hunter did not finish his sentence, for at that moment he caught sight of the recumbent form of Wapaw in the camp.  \"Hist!  A redskin alone, and asleep!  Well, I never did 'xpect to see that.\"  \"Mayhap, he's a decoy-duck,\" suggested Walter.  \"Better look sharp out.\"  Robin and Roy heeded not the caution.  They at once went forward, and the father lifted the blanket from the Indian's head.  \"Dead!\" exclaimed Roy, in a solemn tone.  \"Not yet, lad! but I do b'lieve the poor critter's a'most gone wi' starvation.  Come, bestir you, boys--rouse up the fire, and boil the kettle.\"  Walter and Roy did not require a second bidding.  The kettle was ere long singing on a blazing fire.  The Indian's limbs were chafed and warmed; a can of hot tea was administered, and Wapaw soon revived sufficiently to look up and thank his deliverers.  \"Now, as good luck has it, I chanced to leave my hand-sled at the Wolf's Glen.  Go, fetch it, Roy,\" said Robin.  The lad set off at once, and, as the glen was not far distant, soon returned with a flat wooden sledge, six feet long by eighteen inches broad, on which trappers are wont to pack their game in winter.  On this sledge Wapaw was firmly tied, and dragged by the hunters to Fort Enterprise.  \"Hast got a deer, father?\" cried little Nelly, as she bounded in advance of her mother to meet the returning party.  \"No, Nelly--'tis dearer game than that.\"  \"What? a redskin!\" exclaimed Dame Gore in surprise; \"is he dead?\"  \"No, nor likely to die,\" said Robin, \"he's in a starvin' state though, an'll be none the worse of a bit of our New Year's dinner.  Here is game enough for one meal an' more; come, lass, get it ready as fast as may be.\"  So saying the bold hunter passed through the Fort gate, dragging the red man behind him.    CHAPTER THREE.  PREPARATIONS FOR A FEAST.  \"Why so grave, Robin?\" inquired Mrs Gore, when her husband returned to the parlour after seeing Wapaw laid in a warm corner of the kitchen, and committed to the care of Larry O'Dowd.  \"Molly, my dear, it's of no use concealin' things from you, 'cause when bad luck falls we must just face it.  This Injun--Wapaw, he calls himself--tells me he has com'd here a-purpose, as fast as he could, to say that his tribe have resolved to attack me, burn the Fort, kill all the men, and carry you off into slavery.\"  \"God help me! can this be true?\"  \"True enough, I don't doubt, 'cause Wapaw has the face of an honest man, and I believe in faces.  He says some of the worst men of his tribe are in power just now; that they want the contents of my store without paying for them; that he tried to get them to give up the notion, but failed.  On seeing that they were bent on it, he said he was going off to hunt, and came straight here to warn me.  He says they talked of starting for the Fort two days after he did, and that he pushed on as fast as he could travel, so it's not likely they'll be here for two or three days yet.  I'll get ready for them, hows'ever, and when the reptiles do come they'll meet with a warm reception, I warrant them; meanwhile, do you go and get dinner ready.  We won't let such varmints interfere with our New Year's feast.\"  While Robin's wife went to her larder, his children were in the kitchen tending the Indian with earnest solicitude, and Larry was preparing a little soup for him.  \"Do you like rabbit soup?\" asked Nelly, kneeling beside the pallet of pine branches on which Wapaw lay.  The Indian smiled, and said something in his native tongue.  \"Sure he don't onderstan' ye,\" exclaimed Larry, as he bustled in an energetic way amongst his pots and pans.  \"Let me try him with Cree,\" said Roy, kneeling beside his sister, \"I know a little--a _very_ little Cree.\"  Roy tried his \"very little Cree,\" but without success.  \"It's o' no use,\" he said, \"father must talk to"]]]
