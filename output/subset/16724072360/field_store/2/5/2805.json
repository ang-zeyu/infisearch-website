There are two characters still undescribed.  Characters of no mean importance were they--the \"guides.\"  They were called respectively, Isaac Bradley and Mark Redwood.  A brace of trappers they were, but as different from each other in personal appearance as two men could well be.  Redwood was a man of large dimensions, and apparently as strong as a buffalo, while his _confrere_ was a thin, wiry, sinewy mortal, with a tough, weasel-like look and gait.  The expression of Redwood's countenance was open and manly, his eyes were grey, his hair light-coloured, and huge brown whiskers covered his cheeks.  Bradley, on the other hand, was dark--his eyes small, black, and piercing--his face as hairless as an Indian's, and bronzed almost to the Indian hue, with the black hair of his head closely cropped around it.  Both these men were dressed in leather from head to foot, yet they were very differently dressed.  Redwood wore the usual buckskin hunting-shirt, leggings, and moccasins, but all of full proportions and well cut, while his large 'coon-skin cap, with the plume-like tail, had an imposing appearance.  Bradley's garments, on the contrary, were tight-fitting and \"skimped.\"  His hunting-shirt was without cape, and adhered so closely to his body that it appeared only an outer skin of the man himself.  His leggings were pinched and tight.  Shirt, leggings, and moccasins were evidently of the oldest kind, and as dirty as a cobbler's apron.  A close-fitting otter cap, with a Mackinaw blanket, completed the wardrobe of Isaac Bradley.  He was equipped with a pouch of greasy leather hanging by an old black strap, a small buffalo-horn suspended by a thong, and a belt of buffalo-leather, in which was stuck a strong blade, with its handle of buckhorn.  His rifle was of the \"tallest\" kind--being full six feet in height--in fact, taller than he was, and at least four fifths of the weapon consisted of barrel.  The straight narrow stock was a piece of manufacture that had proceeded from the hands of the trapper himself.  Redwood's rifle was also a long one, but of more modern build and fashion, and his equipments--pouch, powder-horn and belt--were of a more tasty design and finish.  Such were our guides, Redwood and Bradley.  They were no imaginary characters these.  Mark Redwood was a celebrated \"mountain-man\" at that time, and Isaac Bradley will be recognised by many when I give him the name and title by which he was then known,--viz. \"Old Ike, the wolf-killer.\"  Redwood rode a strong horse of the half-hunter breed, while the \"wolf-killer\" was mounted upon one of the scraggiest looking quadrupeds it would be possible to imagine--an old mare \"mustang.\"    CHAPTER TWO.  THE CAMP AND CAMP-FIRE.  Our route was west by south.  The nearest point with which we expected to fall in with the buffalo was two hundred miles distant.  We might travel three hundred without seeing one, and even much farther at the present day; but a report had reached Saint Louis that the buffalo had been seen that year upon the Osage River, west of the Ozark Hills, and towards that point we steered our course.  We expected in about twenty days to fall in with the game.  Fancy a cavalcade of hunters making a journey of twenty days to get upon the field!  The reader will, no doubt, say we were in earnest.  At the time of which I am writing, a single day's journey from Saint Louis carried the traveller clear of civilised life.  There were settlements beyond; but these were sparse and isolated--a few small towns or plantations upon the main watercourses--and the whole country between them was an uninhabited wilderness.  We had no hope of being sheltered by a roof until our return to the mound city itself, but we had provided ourselves with a couple of tents, part of the freight of our waggon.  There are but few parts of the American wilderness where the traveller can depend upon wild game for a subsistence.  Even the skilled hunter when stationary is sometimes put to his wits' end for \"daily bread.\" Upon the \"route\" no great opportunity is found of killing game, which always requires time to approach it with caution.  Although we passed through what appeared to be excellent cover for various species of wild animals, we reached our first camp without having ruffled either hair or feathers.  In fact, neither bird nor quadruped had been seen, although almost every one of the party had been on the look out for game during most of the journey.  This was rather discouraging, and we reasoned that if such was to be our luck until we got into the buffalo-range we should have a very dull time of it.  We were well provisioned, however, and we regretted the absence of game only on account of the sport.  A large bag of biscuit, and one of flour, several pieces of \"hung bacon,\" some dry ox-tongues, a stock of green coffee, sugar, and salt, were the principal and necessary stores.  There were \"luxuries,\" too, which each had provided according to his fancy, though not much of these, as every one of the party had had some time or other in his life a little experience in the way of \"roughing it.\"  Most of the loading of the waggon consisted of provender for our horses and mules.  We made full thirty miles on the first day.  Our road was a good one. We passed over easy undulations, most of them covered with \"black-jack.\" This is a species of dwarf oak, so called from the very dark colour of its wrinkled bark.  It is almost worthless as a timber, being too small for most purposes.  It is ornamental, however, forming copse-like groves upon the swells of the prairie, while its dark green foliage contrasts pleasantly with the lighter green of the grasses beneath its shade.  The young botanist, Besancon, had least cause to complain.  His time had been sufficiently pleasant during the day.  New foliage fell under his observation--new flowers opened their corollas to his delighted gaze. He was aided in making his collections by the hunter-naturalist, who of course was tolerably well versed in this kindred science.  We encamped by the edge of a small creek of clear water.  Our camp was laid out in due form, and everything arranged in the order we designed habitually to follow.  Every man unsaddled his own horse.  There are no servants in prairie-land.  Even Lanty's services extended not beyond the _cuisine_, and for this department he had had his training as the cook of a New Orleans trading ship.  Jake had enough to do with his mules; and to have asked one of our hunter-guides to perform the task of unsaddling your horse, would have been a hazardous experiment.  Menial service to a free trapper!  There are no servants in prairie-land.  Our horses and mules were picketed on a piece of open ground, each having his \"trail-rope,\" which allowed a circuit of several yards.  The two tents were pitched side by side, facing the stream, and the waggon drawn up some twenty feet in the rear.  In the triangle between the waggon and the tents was kindled a large fire, upon each side of which two stakes, forked at the top, were driven into the ground.  A long sapling resting in the forks traversed the blaze from side to side. This was Lanty's \"crane,\"--the fire was his kitchen.  Let me sketch the camp more minutely, for our first camp was a type of all the others in its general features.  Sometimes indeed the tents did not front the same way, when these openings were set to \"oblige the wind,\" but they were always placed side by side in front of the waggon. They were small tents of the old-fashioned conical kind, requiring only one pole each.  They were of sufficient size for our purpose, as there were only three of us to each--the guides, with Jake and Lanty, finding their lodgment under the tilt of the waggon.  With their graceful shape, and snowy-white colour against the dark green foliage of the trees, they formed an agreeable contrast; and a _coup d'oeil_ of the camp would have been no mean picture to the eye of an artist.  The human figures may be arranged in the following manner.  Supper is getting ready, and Lanty is decidedly at this time the most important personage on the ground.  He is stooping over the fire, with a small but long-handled frying-pan, in which he is parching the coffee. It is already browned, and Lanty stirs it about with an iron spoon.  The crane carries the large coffee-kettle of sheet iron, full of water upon the boil; and a second frying-pan, larger than the first, is filled with sliced ham, ready to be placed upon the hot cinders.  Our English friend Thompson is seated upon a log, with the hat-box before him.  It is open, and he has drawn out from it his stock of combs and brushes.  He has already made his ablutions, and is now giving the finish to his toilet, by putting his hair, whiskers, moustache, teeth, and even his nails, in order.  Your Englishman is the most comfortable traveller in the world.  The Kentuckian is differently engaged.  He is upon his feet; in one hand gleams a knife with ivory handle and long shining blade.  It is a \"bowie,\" of that kind known as an \"Arkansas toothpick.\"  In the other hand you see an object about eight inches in length, of the form of a parallelogram, and of a dark brown colour.  It is a \"plug\" of real \"James's River tobacco.\"  With his knife the Kentuckian cuts off a piece--a \"chunk,\" as he terms it--which is immediately transferred to his mouth, and chewed to a pulp.  This is his occupation for the moment.  The doctor, what of him?  Doctor Jopper may be seen close to the water's edge.  In his hand is a pewter flask, of the kind known as a \"pocket pistol.\"  That pistol is loaded with brandy, and Dr Jopper is just in the act of drawing part of the charge, which, with a slight admixture of cool creek water, is carried aloft and poured into a very droughty vessel."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2350"],["title","His Last Bow: An Epilogue of Sherlock Holmes (#1)"],["body","a man whom I knew so slightly. He opened the door himself, however, and greeted me with a great show of cordiality. I was handed over to the manservant, a melancholy, swarthy individual, who led the way, my bag in his hand, to my bedroom. The whole place was depressing. Our dinner was _tête-à-tête_, and though my host did his best to be entertaining, his thoughts seemed to continually wander, and he talked so vaguely and wildly that I could hardly understand him. He continually drummed his fingers on the table, gnawed his nails, and gave other signs of nervous impatience. The dinner itself was neither well served nor well cooked, and the gloomy presence of the taciturn servant did not help to enliven us. I can assure you that many times in the course of the evening I wished that I could invent some excuse which would take me back to Lee.  “One thing comes back to my memory which may have a bearing upon the business that you two gentlemen are investigating. I thought nothing of it at the time. Near the end of dinner a note was handed in by the servant. I noticed that after my host had read it he seemed even more distrait and strange than before. He gave up all pretence at conversation and sat, smoking endless cigarettes, lost in his own thoughts, but he made no remark as to the contents. About eleven I was glad to go to bed. Some time later Garcia looked in at my door—the room was dark at the time—and asked me if I had rung. I said that I had not. He apologised for having disturbed me so late, saying that it was nearly one o’clock. I dropped off after this and slept soundly all night.  “And now I come to the amazing part of my tale. When I woke it was broad daylight. I glanced at my watch, and the time was nearly nine. I had particularly asked to be called at eight, so I was very much astonished at this forgetfulness. I sprang up and rang for the servant. There was no response. I rang again and again, with the same result. Then I came to the conclusion that the bell was out of order. I huddled on my clothes and hurried downstairs in an exceedingly bad temper to order some hot water. You can imagine my surprise when I found that there was no one there. I shouted in the hall. There was no answer. Then I ran from room to room. All were deserted. My host had shown me which was his bedroom the night before, so I knocked at the door. No reply. I turned the handle and walked in. The room was empty, and the bed had never been slept in. He had gone with the rest. The foreign host, the foreign footman, the foreign cook, all had vanished in the night! That was the end of my visit to Wisteria Lodge.”  Sherlock Holmes was rubbing his hands and chuckling as he added this bizarre incident to his collection of strange episodes.  “Your experience is, so far as I know, perfectly unique,” said he. “May I ask, sir, what you did then?”  “I was furious. My first idea was that I had been the victim of some absurd practical joke. I packed my things, banged the hall door behind me, and set off for Esher, with my bag in my hand. I called at Allan Brothers’, the chief land agents in the village, and found that it was from this firm that the villa had been rented. It struck me that the whole proceeding could hardly be for the purpose of making a fool of me, and that the main object must be to get out of the rent. It is late in March, so quarter-day is at hand. But this theory would not work. The agent was obliged to me for my warning, but told me that the rent had been paid in advance. Then I made my way to town and called at the Spanish embassy. The man was unknown there. After this I went to see Melville, at whose house I had first met Garcia, but I found that he really knew rather less about him than I did. Finally when I got your reply to my wire I came out to you, since I gather that you are a person who gives advice in difficult cases. But now, Mr. Inspector, I understand, from what you said when you entered the room, that you can carry the story on, and that some tragedy had occurred. I can assure you that every word I have said is the truth, and that, outside of what I have told you, I know absolutely nothing about the fate of this man. My only desire is to help the law in every possible way.”  “I am sure of it, Mr. Scott Eccles—I am sure of it,” said Inspector Gregson in a very amiable tone. “I am bound to say that everything which you have said agrees very closely with the facts as they have come to our notice. For example, there was that note which arrived during dinner. Did you chance to observe what became of it?”  “Yes, I did. Garcia rolled it up and threw it into the fire.”  “What do you say to that, Mr. Baynes?”  The country detective was a stout, puffy, red man, whose face was only redeemed from grossness by two extraordinarily bright eyes, almost hidden behind the heavy creases of cheek and brow. With a slow smile he drew a folded and discoloured scrap of paper from his pocket.  “It was a dog-grate, Mr. Holmes, and he overpitched it. I picked this out unburned from the back of it.”  Holmes smiled his appreciation.  “You must have examined the house very carefully to find a single pellet of paper.”  “I did, Mr. Holmes. It’s my way. Shall I read it, Mr. Gregson?”  The Londoner nodded.  “The note is written upon ordinary cream-laid paper without watermark. It is a quarter-sheet. The paper is cut off in two snips with a short-bladed scissors. It has been folded over three times and sealed with purple wax, put on hurriedly and pressed down with some flat oval object. It is addressed to Mr. Garcia, Wisteria Lodge. It says:  “Our own colours, green and white. Green open, white shut. Main stair, first corridor, seventh right, green baize. Godspeed. D.  “It is a woman’s writing, done with a sharp-pointed pen, but the address is either done with another pen or by someone else. It is thicker and bolder, as you see.”  “A very remarkable note,” said Holmes, glancing it over. “I must compliment you, Mr. Baynes, upon your attention to detail in your examination of it. A few trifling points might perhaps be added. The oval seal is undoubtedly a plain sleeve-link—what else is of such a shape? The scissors were bent nail scissors. Short as the two snips are, you can distinctly see the same slight curve in each.”  The country detective chuckled.  “I thought I had squeezed all the juice out of it, but I see there was a little over,” he said. “I’m bound to say that I make nothing of the note except that there was something on hand, and that a woman, as usual was at the bottom of it.”  Mr. Scott Eccles had fidgeted in his seat during this conversation.  “I am glad you found the note, since it corroborates my story,” said he. “But I beg to point out that I have not yet heard what has happened to Mr. Garcia, nor what has become of his household.”  “As to Garcia,” said Gregson, “that is easily answered. He was found dead this morning upon Oxshott Common, nearly a mile from his home. His head had been smashed to pulp by heavy blows of a sandbag or some such instrument, which had crushed rather than wounded. It is a lonely corner, and there is no house within a quarter of a mile of the spot. He had apparently been struck down first from behind, but his assailant had gone on beating him long after he was dead. It was a most furious assault. There are no footsteps nor any clue to the criminals.”  “Robbed?”  “No, there was no attempt at robbery.”  “This is very painful—very painful and terrible,” said Mr. Scott Eccles in a querulous voice, “but it is really uncommonly hard on me. I had nothing to do with my host going off upon a nocturnal excursion and meeting so sad an end. How do I come to be mixed up with the case?”  “Very simply, sir,” Inspector Baynes answered. “The only document found in the pocket of the deceased was a letter from you saying that you would be with him on the night of his death. It was the envelope of this letter which gave us the dead man’s name and address. It was after nine this morning when we reached his house and found neither you nor anyone else inside it. I wired to Mr. Gregson to run you down in London while I examined Wisteria Lodge. Then I came into town, joined Mr. Gregson, and here we are.”  “I think now,” said Gregson, rising, “we had best put this matter into an official shape. You will come round with us to the station, Mr. Scott Eccles, and let us have your statement in writing.”  “Certainly, I will come at once. But I retain your services, Mr. Holmes. I desire you to spare no expense and no pains to get at the truth.”  My friend turned to the country inspector.  “I suppose that you have no objection to my collaborating with you, Mr. Baynes?”  “Highly honoured, sir, I am sure.”  “You appear to have been very prompt and businesslike in all that you have done. Was there any clue, may I ask, as to the exact hour that the man met his death?”  “He had been there since one o’clock. There was rain about that time, and his death had certainly been before the rain.”  “But that is perfectly impossible, Mr. Baynes,” cried our client. “His voice is unmistakable. I could swear to it that it was he who addressed me in my bedroom at that very hour.”  “Remarkable, but by no means impossible,” said Holmes, smiling.  “You have a clue?” asked Gregson.  “On the face of it the case is not a very complex one, though it certainly presents some novel and interesting features. A further knowledge of facts is necessary before I would venture to give a final and definite opinion. By the way, Mr. Baynes, did you find anything remarkable besides this note in your examination of the house?”  The detective looked at my friend in a singular way.  “There were,” said he, “one or two _very_ remarkable things. Perhaps when I have finished at the police-station you would care to come out and give me your opinion of them.”  “I am entirely at your service,” said Sherlock Holmes, ringing the bell. “You will show these gentlemen out, Mrs."]]]
