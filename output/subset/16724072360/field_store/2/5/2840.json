[4] _Halcyon_, or _Kingfisher_. Esteemed the most beautiful of our        native birds; but its form is clumsy, and its bill very        disproportionate to its size. It inhabits the banks of rivers        and streams, where it will sit for hours on a projecting        branch, watching for its prey. The ancients relate many        fabulous stories of this bird, as that of its laying its eggs        in the depth of winter, and that during the time of its        incubation the weather remains perfectly calm, whence the        expression _Halcyon days_.     [5] _Cuculus indicator._ A bird of the Cuckoo kind, found in the        interior parts of Africa; it has a shrill note, which the        natives answer by a soft whistle; and the birds repeating the        note, the natives are thereby conducted to the wild Bee-hives,        which this bird frequents.     [6] _Cassowary._ A large singular bird found in the island of Java,        in Africa, and the southern parts of India. The head of this        bird is armed with a kind of natural helmet, extending from the        base of the bill to near half-way over the head.     [7] _Flamingo._ A bird of the crane kind, but web-footed, whose        plumage is of a bright scarlet: when standing erect, it        measures above six feet, though its body is not larger than        that of a Goose; and is a native of Africa, Persia, and South        America.     [8] _Ptarmigan._ The white grouse, or white game, inhabits the        Highlands of Scotland and the Western Islands; it prefers the        coldest situations on the highest mountains, where it burrows        under the snow. It changes its feathers twice in the year, and        about the end of February puts on its summer dress of dusky        brown, ash, and orange-coloured feathers; which it loses in        winter for a plumage perfectly white, except a black line        between the bill and the eye. The legs and toes are warmly        clothed with a thick long coat of soft white feathers.     [9] _The Chough._ This bird, which is about the size of the Daw,        has a long curved bill, sharp at the point, which, as well as        the legs and feet, is of a bright scarlet, contrasting        beautifully with its black plumage, which varies, as the light        falls on it, to a deep purple violet. Its general haunts are        the crevices of high cliffs in Devonshire and Cornwall.    [10] _The Widow_, or _Widah Bird_, is a species of Bunting, a native        of Angola and other parts of Africa; and is remarkable for the        feathers of its tail. The two middle ones are about four inches        long, and ending in a long thread; the two next are thirteen        inches in length, broad, and narrowing towards the points: from        these proceeds another long thread.    [11] _Yaffil, the Woodpecker._ The name Yaffil is provincial, but is        so very expressive of the noise it continually makes, that I        have preferred it on that account. It is a beautiful bird, and        is sometimes called the English Parrot; the colour of its        plumage, green, yellow, and scarlet, giving it some resemblance        to that bird.    [12] _The Numidian Crane_, or _Demoiselle_, from the elegance of its        appearance, and its singular carriage, is called the        Demoiselle, which means the Young Lady; for this bird walks        very gracefully, and sometimes skips and leaps, as though it        were trying to dance.    [13] _Guillemot._ A sea-bird, of which there are several species        numerously spread over the northern world; from whence they        come towards winter to the British shores, and remain till they        have reared their young. It is sometimes called \"the foolish        Guillemot,\" from its stupidity; for when their companions are        shot one after another, they have so little sense of danger,        that they make a small circuit, and then return and settle in        the same place, to share the same fate.    [14] _Toucan._ A native of America, where it builds in the hollows        of trees, and sits at the entrance, ready to peck at the        monkeys, who often endeavour to destroy and eat the young. It        is about the size of a Magpie, but the head large in        proportion, to enable it to support its immense bill, which is        six inches and one-half in length, but extremely thin. It is a        mild inoffensive bird, and easily tamed, but cannot endure the        cold of our climate. The feathers of the breast are highly        esteemed by the natives.    [15] _Cross-bill._ So called because the two mandibles cross each        other in different directions. They feed chiefly on the seeds        of fir-trees; the singular construction of their bills being        admirably adapted to separate the seeds of the cones. The pips        of apples are also a favourite food, and, to obtain them, they        split the apple with one stroke of their bill; they are        consequently found to be very injurious to orchards. It has        been observed that they have been more frequently seen in        England since the fir-tree has been more generally planted than        formerly.    [16] _Siskin._ A migratory bird, which is seen in the southern parts        of England at the time of the barley harvest, and is sometimes        called the Barley-bird. It has a pleasing note, and is sold as        a singing-bird in the London bird-shops by the name of the        Aberdevine. The accusation of its flirtation with the        Greenfinch is to be understood as pure scandal, the most prying        naturalists never having discovered any particular attachment        between them.    [17] _Razor-bill._ A migratory sea-bird, which visits the northern        shores in spring, and leaves them in winter: they lay a single        egg on the ledges of the rocks without any nest, and on which        it is said to be fixed with a cement.    [18] _Spoon-bill._ So called from the construction of the bill,        which is flat the whole length, but widens towards the end in        the form of a spoon or spatula; and is equally remarkable in        its substance, not being hard like bone, but flexible like        whalebone. They feed on snakes, worms, frogs, and fish, even        on shell-fish, which they first break with their bills.    [19] _The Agami_, or _Trumpeter_. A native of America, remarkable        for a singular noise, resembling the instrument from which it        takes its name.                                 THE                      BUTTERFLY'S BALL,                           AND THE                     GRASSHOPPER'S FEAST.                         By Mr. ROSCOE.       Come, take up your hats, and away let us haste   To the _Butterfly's_ Ball and the _Grasshopper's_ Feast:   The Trumpeter, _Gadfly_, has summon'd the Crew,   And the Revels are now only waiting for you.      So said little Robert, and pacing along,   His merry Companions came forth in a throng,   And on the smooth Grass, by the side of a Wood   Beneath a broad Oak that for ages had stood,   Saw the Children of Earth, and the Tenants of Air,   For an Evening's Amusement together repair.   And there came the _Beetle_, so blind and so black,   Who carried the _Emmet_, his Friend, on his back   And there was the _Gnat_, and the _Dragon-fly_ too,   With all their Relations, Green, Orange, and Blue.   And there came the _Moth_, with his plumage of down,   And the _Hornet_, in Jacket of Yellow and Brown;   Who with him the _Wasp_, his Companion, did bring,   But they promised that Evening to lay by their Sting.   And the sly little _Dormouse_ crept out of his hole,   And brought to the Feast his blind Brother, the _Mole_.   And the _Snail_, with his Horns peeping out of his Shell,   Came from a great distance, the Length of an Ell.   A Mushroom their Table, and on it was laid   A Water-dock Leaf, which a Table-cloth made.   The Viands were various, to each of their taste,   And the _Bee_ brought her Honey to crown the Repast.   Then close on his haunches, so solemn and wise,   The _Frog_ from a corner look'd up to the Skies;   And the _Squirrel_, well pleased such diversions to see,   Mounted high over-head, and look'd down from a Tree.   Then out came the _Spider_, with finger so fine,   To show his dexterity on the tight line.   From one branch to another his Cobwebs he slung,   Then quick as an arrow he darted along;   But just in the middle,--Oh! shocking to tell,   From his rope in an instant poor Harlequin fell.   Yet he touch'd not the ground, but with talons outspread   Hung suspended in air, at the end of a thread.   Then the _Grasshopper_ came with a jerk and a spring;   Very long was his Leg, though but short was his Wing:   He took but three leaps, and was soon out of sight,   Then chirp'd his own praises the rest of the night.   With step so majestic the _Snail_ did advance,   And promised the Gazers a Minuet to dance.   But they all laugh'd so loud that he pull'd in his head,   And went in his own little chamber to bed.   Then, as Evening gave way to the Shadows of Night,   Their Watchman, the _Glowworm_, came out with a light.      Then Home let us hasten, while yet we can see,   For no watchman is waiting for you and for me.   So said little Robert, and pacing along,   His merry Companions return'd in a throng.                                 THE                         FANCY FAIR;                              OR,                           GRAND GALA                            OF THE                     ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS.       Some years are elapsed, and some worthies are gone,   Since _Peacocks_ and _Butterflies_ mimick'd the _ton_,   And gave, in a manner becoming their station,   Their _fêtes_ and their _balls_ to their fellow-creation.   Then "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23665"],["title","The Peacock 'At Home' AND The Butterfly's Ball AND The Fancy Fair (#2)"],["body","and _Dorset_, high-talented elves,   Amused other people and solaced themselves,   In describing the revels, the gibes, and the jokes,   Of the creatures of earth, and the feathery folks;   Of their fashion and fancy, the ebbs and the flows,   And the beauty and wit of their belles and their beaux.   But the world has spun round like a peg top since then,   And imparted more knowledge to brutes and to men;   New lights and perceptions old customs explode,   And what is done now, must be done _à-la-mode_.   Old fashions are fled, and what more can we say   Than that _Dorset_ and _Roscoe_ might do for that day,   But that Poets must deck in more dignified rhymes   The wonderful deeds of these wonderful times?   That _Augusta_ may spread her renown and her glory,   Her famed _Fancy Fairs_ must be studded in story,   And ages unborn learn the elegant Games   Of the _Gardens_ that bloom on the south of the Thames.   Old _Dryden_ the bard was at best but a gander,   In singing the _Feast_ of the great _Alexander_;   For what breast with the fumes of a banquet is fired   Two thousand years after the guests have retired?   Our happier bard takes the season that suits,   At the spur of the moment he puts on his boots,   All hot for _Parnassus_, and cries in a hurry,   \"Prepare me my _Pegasus_! '_Saddle white Surrey!_'\"   It is clear that he feels what his numbers prolong,   That he warms with his subject, and soars in his song.   But whether his lot be unhonour'd and low,   Or the wreath of the _Laureat_ encircles his brow,   With the world to admire him, mysterious elf!   Is a secret of state that he keeps to himself.   But come! _Zoological_ wonders require   The strains of his genius, his force and his fire;   He burns with impatience the scene to display:   Hark away, to the _Gardens of Taste_! Hark away!      The sun, as he rose, was received with a cheer,   From the Herald at Arms, the renown'd _Chanticleer_,   Who proclaim'd, with a feeling of pride in his breast,   That the _Gardens of Surrey_ were fairest and best.   Then at once the shrill tidings were borne on the air,   That the dawn had arrived of the famed _Fancy Fair_,   And that all that was lovely, and beauteous, and bright,   Was summon'd to honour that day of delight.   The sunbeam was clear on that lovely retreat;   The breath of the morning was balmy and sweet;   Fair _flowrets_, that vied with the rainbow, were seen,   And _trees_ in their livery of liveliest green.   The voice of rejoicing, from children of earth,   Was so mingled with cheerfulness, music, and mirth,   That the mind, and the eye, and the ear, and the heart   Were saluted with pleasure from every part.   A thousand gay faces appear'd in the throng,   And crowds of fair creatures came trooping along.   Till the place, all enliven'd with joy and surprise,   Was lit up with sunbeams and Beauty's bright eyes.   The groups of all ages were gather'd so well,   That they threw o'er the poet and painter a spell,   And the flashes of fancy, wit, feeling, and fire,   Resistless compell'd them to pause and admire.      Much pains had been taken to add to the grace,   And preserve from disorder the pride of the place;   To keep the fair flowrets from wandering away,   As well as the things that were fairer than they,   For placards were posted near every spot,   You may stand to \"_admire_\" me, \"_but gather me not_.\"      The _Beasts_ and the _Birds_ were so fresh and so fair,   That they call'd forth the wonder of all who came there,   And the _Boa Constrictors_ so slimy and gay,   That they seem'd to have painted themselves for the day.   The _Green-bonnet Monkey_, with speckles bespread,   Was proud of the verdigris tuft on his head;   For it look'd, as he leap'd in his frolic and joy,   Like the top of the turban of _Rammohun Roy_.   Dame _Tortoise_ roam'd over the green and beyond,   For she pass'd on her pilgrimage right to the pond.   As she gazed on the _Crocodile_ softly she sigh'd,   Though she thought that his mouth was a _little_ too wide.   The _Zebra_ look'd sprightly, as every one saw,   And the _African Sheep_ and white-footed _Nyl Ghau_;   And that leaper of leapers, the strange _Kangaroo_,   That is biped and triped and quadruped too,   Who out-juggles the _Juggler_, by hill and by dale;   For he makes, when he pleases, a leg of his tail.   With a soft, silky, aspect, demure and profound,   A _tabby Cat_ wander'd the _Gardens_ around,   And purr'd her applause with a quiet delight,   As she gazed half-entranced on the heart-cheering sight.   Among the rare wonders that caught every eye,   Demanding a glance from the gay passer-by,   Was the _Alpaca_, _Zebu_ of Indian race,   And the _Camel_, brought up in that beautiful place.   A dome in the centre, deservedly praised,   Transparent as crystal, was artfully raised,   Where African _Lions_, and _Tigers_ untamed,   And _Sloths_ and _Hyænas_, for savageness famed,   And _Leopards_ and _Ladies_, and _Monsters_ and _Men_,   Securely might meet in the very same pen.      The crowd still increased on that magical ground,   And thousands and thousands came trooping around.   The _haut ton_ and _beau monde_ paced about debonair,   Tall and short, _enbonpoint_, slender, sunburnt, and fair,   While Hatred and Anger and Care fled away,   And light hearts and bright eyes were the charm of the day.   Then the painted _balloon_ in its glory was bright,   And it mounted on high till it sail'd out of sight.   The _Juggler_, with tricks and illusions came forth,   And the _Russians_ with _musical horns_ from the North,   Transporting enough to make _Orpheus_ mute:   As loud as the trumpet, as soft as the lute,   They fill'd every bosom, absorbing them quite,   And the _reeds_ seem'd to burden the air with delight.   Such strains have rung round me in seasons gone by,   When escaped from the cloister I mused with a sigh,   And listed awhile to the balm-shedding breeze,   As it fitfully swept through the sedge and the trees,   And plaintively whisper'd with musical power,   O'er the \"soft-flowing Avon,\" at evening hour.      And now the fair parties, with Mirth for their guide,   And light-hearted Laughter, a moment divide,   And gaze on the _Eagles_, the _old ruin'd wall_,   The _Boat-house_, the _Temple_, the _Hermitage_, all;   Reproved, when their pleasure too freely they quaff,   By that _memento mori_, the Afric _Giraffe_.[1]  [Illustration]      Some visit the laughing-bird, called _Cockatoo_,   Who drops them a courtesy, and cries \"How d' ye do?\"   Or Mungo, the _negro_, who quaintly and sly   Takes his tea, Cayenne pepper, and cold apple-pie.   Some gaze on the _Cygnets_ that glide like a dream,   And bend down to admire their fair forms in the stream;   Some laugh at their fancies, or muse on a flower,   And all are delighted, so happy the hour.   Wouldst thou gaze with emotions far purer than mirth   On one of the fairest creations of earth,   Go at even, and breathe the pure breath of the breeze,   From the _seat_ by the _Lake_, 'neath those wild _Willow-trees_.  [Illustration]      New pleasures succeeded; the spell was of power   That Variety threw o'er the varying hour,   And a change of enjoyment was found by the train   In losing and finding each other again.   The _dancing_ commenced, and the Fair, beyond praise,   As light as the gossamer, tripp'd through the maze.   What warm salutations! what laughing aloud!   What sounds of enjoyment were heard in the crowd!   But who were the worthies who moved with a grace   And demeanour, as though they belong'd to the place?   Prince Eglantine _Eagle_, with lightning-like glare,   Threw a glance all around him to see who was there;   To the _Pelican_ Princesses bent his head low,   As they proudly pass'd by with their bosoms of snow.   Duke _Emu_, too, gazed on the heart-cheering sight,   And Earl Hildebrand _Harpy_, so famous in fight;   While the figure that walk'd so erect, I suppose,   Was Sir Peregrine _Penguin_,--I judge by his nose.   Viscount _Stork_, as he strutted about, gave a beck   To Earl _Vulture_, who wears no cravat round his neck;   And the _Bishop_ was there, though he stood rather back,   Array'd in his robes of red, orange, and black,   Sir Archibald _Ostrich_ moved on rather chary,   And lean'd on his cousin the Count _Cassowary_,   Discoursing of _Java_, and far distant lands,   And African _Deserts_, and hot burning sands.   Old warrior _Flamingo_ came limping along,   And with Commodore _Cormorant_ join'd in the throng,   Profoundly debating, with Major _Macaw_,   The merits of martial and maritime law.   Earl _Heron_ walk'd stately with Caroline _Crane_,   And Field-marshal _Falcon_, of valour so vain;   While Captain _Crown Pigeon_, so odd in his tread,   Shook the quaking-grass tuft on his fanciful head.   Lord _Peacock_, from _Asia_, came dress'd very fine--   His musical taste ne'er accorded with mine;   And the learn'd Baron _Buzzard_, who gravely decided,   That game, when once caught, should be fairly divided.   The grenadier, Captain _Curassow_, was drest   In his helmet, and held up his head with the best;   While Fatima _Pheasant_, from China, display'd   Her Pekin pelisse of bright silver brocade.   Count _Turkey_ expanded the finery that bound him,   And gabbled high Dutch to the people around him.   His Honour the _Hawk_ loved a lark and a race,   So he hover'd about near the courts of the place.   Colonel _Kite_ spoke of sporting--of young _Ducks_ and _Widgeons_,   And plann'd a new pent-house for _Ring-doves_ and _Pigeons_.   At the edge of the water, and hard by the sluice,   _Tête-à-tête_ Doctor _Drake_ sat with old Gammer _Goose_.   And Sir Christopher _Crow_ wore a coat on his back,   Of a true Day and Martin-like polish of black.   Mother _Magpie_ and Priscilla _Parrot_, in spite,   Could talk without ceasing from morning to night;   Spread abroad _Entre nous_ and _On dits_ by the score,   All the news they had heard, and a"]]]
