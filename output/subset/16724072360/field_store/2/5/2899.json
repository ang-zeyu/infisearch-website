Looking up, Frank recognized one of those who had saluted Percy and himself on their way to the restaurant.  \"He isn't my uncle,\" he replied, rather resentfully.  \"You never saw him before, did you?\" continued the boy.  \"No, I didn't.\"  \"That's what I thought.\"  There was something significant in the young Arab's tone, which led Frank to inquire, \"Do you know him?\"  \"Yes, he's a dead-beat.\"  \"A what?\"  \"A dead-beat. Don't you understand English?\"  \"He told me that he did business on Wall street.\"  The boot-black shrieked with laughter.  \"He do business on Wall street!\" he repeated. \"You're jolly green, you are!\"  Frank was inclined to be angry, but he had the good sense to see that his new friend was right. So he said good-humoredly, \"I suppose I am. You see I am not used to the city.\"  \"It's just such fellows as you he gets hold of,\" continued the boot-black. \"Didn't he make you treat?\"  \"I may as well confess it,\" thought Frank. \"This boy may help me with advice.\"  \"Yes,\" he said aloud. \"I hadn't but twenty-five cents, and he made me spend it all. I haven't a cent left.\"  \"Whew!\" ejaculated the other boy. \"You're beginnin' business on a small capital.\"  \"That's so,\" said Frank. \"Do you know any way I can earn money?\"  Dick Rafferty was a good-natured boy, although rough, and now that Frank had appealed to him for advice he felt willing to help him, if he could.  \"What can you do?\" he asked, in a business-like tone. \"Have you ever worked?\"  \"Yes,\" answered Frank.  \"What can you do?\"  \"I can milk cows, hoe corn and potatoes, ride horse to plough, and--\"  \"Hold up!\" said Dick. \"All them things aint goin' to do you no good in New York. People don't keep cows as a reg'lar thing here.\"  \"Of course I know that.\"  \"And there aint much room for plantin' corn and potatoes. Maybe you could get a job over in Jersey.\"  \"I'd rather stay in New York. I can do something here.\"  \"Can you black boots, or sell papers?\"  \"I can learn.\"  \"You need money to set up in either of them lines,\" said Dick Rafferty.  \"Would twenty-five cents have been enough?\" asked Frank.  \"You could have bought some evening papers with that.\"  \"I wish somebody would lend me some money,\" said Frank; \"I'd pay it back as soon as I'd sold my papers. I was a fool to let that fellow swindle me.\"  \"That's so,\" assented Dick; \"but it's no good thinkin' of that now. I'd lend you the money myself, if I had it; but I've run out my account at the Park Bank, and can't spare the money just at present.\"  \"How long have you been in business?\" asked Frank.  \"Ever since I was eight years old; and I'm goin' on fifteen now.\"  \"You went to work early.\"  \"Yes, I had to. Father and mother both died, and I was left to take care of myself.\"  \"You took care of yourself when you were only eight years old?\" asked Frank, in surprise.  \"Yes.\"  \"Then I ought to make a living, for I am fifteen,--a year older than you are now.\"  \"Oh, you'll get along when you get started,\" said Dick, encouragingly. \"There's lots of things to do.\"  \"Is there anything to do that doesn't require any capital?\" inquired Frank, anxiously.  \"Yes, you can smash baggage.\"  \"Will people pay for that?\" asked Frank, with a smile.  \"Of course they will. You jest hang round the ferries and steamboat landin's, and when a chap comes by with a valise or carpet-bag, you jest offer to carry it, that's all.\"  \"Is that what you call smashing baggage?\"  \"Of course. What did you think it was?\"  Frank evaded answering, not caring to display his country ignorance.  \"Do you think I can get a chance to do that?\" he asked.  \"You can try it and see.\"  \"I came in by the Hartford boat myself, to-day,\" said Frank. \"If I'd thought of it, I would have begun at once.\"  \"Only you wouldn't have knowed the way anywhere, and if a gentleman asked you to carry his valise to any hotel you'd have had to ask where it was.\"  \"So I should,\" Frank admitted.  \"I'll show you round a little, if you want me to,\" said Dick. \"I shan't have anything to do for an hour or two.\"  \"I wish you would.\"  So the two boys walked about in the lower part of the city, Dick pointing out hotels, public buildings, and prominent streets. Frank had a retentive memory, and stored away the information carefully. Penniless as he was, he was excited and exhilarated by the scene of activity in which he was moving, and was glad he was going to live in it, or to attempt doing so.  \"When I am used to it I shall like it much better than the country,\" he said to Dick. \"Don't you?\"  \"I don't know about that,\" was the reply. \"Sometimes I think I'll go West;--a lot of boys that I know have gone there.\"  \"Won't it take a good deal of money to go?\" asked Frank.  \"Oh, there's a society that pays boys' expenses, and finds 'em nice homes with the farmers. Tom Harrison, one of my friends, went out six weeks ago, and he writes me that it's bully. He's gone to some town in Kansas.\"  \"That's a good way off.\"  \"I wouldn't mind that. I'd like ridin' in the cars.\"  \"It would be something new to you; but I've lived in the country all my life, I'd rather stay here awhile.\"  \"It's just the way a feller feels,\" said Dick philosophically. \"I've bummed around so much I'd like a good, stiddy home, with three square meals a day and a good bed to sleep on.\"  \"Can't you get that here?\" asked Frank.  \"Not stiddy. Sometimes I don't get but one square meal a day.\"  Frank became thoughtful. Life in the city seemed more precarious and less desirable than he anticipated.  \"Well, I must go to work again,\" said Dick, after a while.  \"Where are you going to sleep to-night?\" asked Frank.  \"I don't know whether I'd better sleep at the Astor House or Fifth avenue,\" said Dick.  Frank looked perplexed.  \"You don't mean that, do you?\" he asked.  \"Of course I don't. You're too fresh. Don't get mad,\" he continued good-naturedly, seeing the flush on Frank's cheek. \"You'll know as much about the city as I do before long. I shall go to the Newsboys' Lodgin' House, where I can sleep for six cents.\"  \"I wish I had six cents,\" said Frank. \"If I could only get work I'd soon earn it. You can't think of anything for me to do, can you?\"  Dick's face lighted up.  \"Yes,\" he said, \"I can get you a job, though it aint a very good one. I wonder I didn't think of it before.\"  \"What is it?\" asked Frank, anxiously.  \"It's to go round with a blind man, solicitin' contributions.\"  \"You mean begging?\"  \"Yes; you lead him into stores and countin' rooms, and he asks for money.\"  \"I don't like it much,\" said Frank, slowly, \"but I must do something. After all, it'll be he that's begging, not I.\"  \"I'll take you right round where he lives,\" said Dick. \"Maybe he'll go out this evenin'. His other boy give him the slip, and he hasn' got a new one yet.\"     CHAPTER III.  FRANK FINDS AN EMPLOYER.   A stone's throw from Centre street stands a tall tenement-house, sheltering anywhere from forty to fifty families in squalid wretchedness. The rent which each family pays would procure a neat house in a country town, with perhaps a little land beside; but the city has a mysterious fascination for the poorer classes, and year after year many who might make the change herd together in contracted and noisome quarters, when they might have their share of light and space in country neighborhoods.  It was in front of this tenement-house that Dick halted, and plunged into a dark entrance, admonishing Frank to follow. Up creaking and dilapidated staircases to the fourth floor the boys went.  \"Here we are,\" said Dick, panting a little from the rapidity of his ascent, and began a vigorous tattoo on a door to the left.  \"Is this where the blind gentleman lives?\" asked Frank, looking around him dubiously.  \"He isn't much of a gentleman to look at,\" said Dick, laughing. \"Do you hear him?\"  Frank heard a hoarse growl from the inside, which might have been \"Come in.\" At any rate, Dick chose so to interpret it, and opened the door.  The boys found themselves in a scantily furnished room, with a close, disagreeable smell pervading the atmosphere. In the corner was a low bedstead, on which lay a tall man, with a long, gray beard, and a disagreeable, almost repulsive, countenance. He turned his eyes, which, contrary to Frank's expectations, were wide open, full upon his visitors.  \"What do you want?\" he asked querulously. \"I was asleep, and you have waked me up.\"  \"Sorry to disturb you, Mr. Mills,\" said Dick; \"but I come on business.\"  \"What business can you have with me?\" demanded the blind man. \"Who are you?\"  \"I am Dick Rafferty. I black boots in the Park,\" replied Dick.  \"Well, I haven't got any money to pay for blacking boots.\"  \"I didn't expect you had. I hear your boy has left you.\"  \"Yes, the young rascal! He's given me the slip. I expect he's robbed me too; but I can't tell, for I'm blind.\"  \"Do you want a new boy?\"  \"Yes; but I can't pay much. I'm very poor. I don't think the place will suit you.\"  \"Nor I either,\" said Dick, frankly. \"I'd rather make a living outside. But I've got a boy with me who has just come to the city, and is out of business. I guess he'll engage with you.\"  \"What's his name? Let him speak for himself.\"  \"My name is Frank Kavanagh,\" said our hero, in a clear, distinct voice.  \"How old are you?\"  \"Fifteen.\"  \"Do you know what your duties will be?\"  \"Yes; Dick has told me.\"  \"I told him you'd want him to go round on a collecting tour with you every day,\" said Dick.  \"That isn't all. You'll have to buy my groceries and all I need.\"  \"I can do that,\" said Frank, cheerfully, reflecting that this would be much more agreeable than accompanying the old man round the streets.  \"Are you honest?\" queried the blind man, sharply.  Frank answered, with an indignant flush, \"I never stole a cent in my life.\"  \"I supposed you'd say that,\" retorted the blind man, with a sneer. \"They all do; but a good many will steal for all that.\"  \"If you're afraid I will, you needn't hire me,\" said"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24013"],["title","The Telegraph Boy (#2)"],["body","nk, independently.  \"Of course I needn't,\" said Mills, sharply; \"but I am not afraid. If you take any of my money I shall be sure to find it out, if I am blind.\"  \"Don't mind him, Frank,\" said Dick, in a low voice.  \"What's that?\" asked the blind man, suspiciously. \"What are you two whispering about?\"  \"I told Frank not to mind the way you spoke,\" said Dick.  \"Your friend will lend you some, then.\"  \"Not much,\" answered Dick, laughing. \"I'm dead-broke. Haven't you got any money, Mr. Mills?\"  \"I have a little,\" grumbled the blind man; \"but this boy may take it, and never come back.\"  \"If you think so,\" said Frank, proudly, \"you'd better engage some other boy.\"  \"No use; you're all alike. Wait a minute, and I'll give you some money.\"  He drew from his pocket a roll of scrip, and handed one to Frank.  \"I don't think that will be enough,\" said Frank. \"It's only five cents.\"  \"Are you sure it isn't a quarter?\" grumbled Mills.  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"What do you say,--you, Dick?\"  \"It's only five cents, sir.\"  \"Is that twenty-five?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Then take it, and mind you don't loiter.\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"And be sure to bring back the change.\"  \"Of course I will,\" said Frank indignantly, resenting his employer's suspicion.  \"What do you think of him, Frank?\" asked Dick, as they descended the stairs.  \"I don't like him at all, Dick,\" said Frank, decidedly. \"I wish I could get something else to do.\"  \"You can, after a while. As you have no capital you must take what you can get now.\"  \"So I suppose; but I didn't come to the city for this.\"  \"If you don't like it you can leave in a few days.\"  This Frank fully resolved to do at the first favorable opportunity.  Dick showed him where he could buy the articles he was commissioned to purchase; and Frank, after obtaining them, went back to the tenement-house.  Mills scrupulously demanded the change, and put it back into his pocket. Then he made Frank pour out the ale into a glass. This he drank with apparent zest, but offered none to Frank.  \"Ale isn't good for boys,\" he said. \"You can cut the bread, and eat two slices. Don't cut them too thick.\"  The blind man ate some of the bread himself, and then requested Frank to help him on with his coat and vest.  \"I haven't taken any money to-day,\" he said \"I must try to collect some, or I shall starve. It's a sad thing to be blind,\" he continued, his voice changing to a whine.  \"You don't look blind,\" said Frank, thoughtfully. \"Your eyes are open.\"  \"What if they are?\" said Mills, testily. \"I cannot see. When I go out I close them, because the light hurts them.\"  Led by Frank, the blind man descended the stairs, and emerged into the street.     CHAPTER IV.  \"PITY THE BLIND.\"   \"Where shall I lead you?\" asked Frank.  \"To Broadway first. Do you know Broadway?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Be careful when we cross the street, or you will have me run over.\"  \"All right, sir.\"  \"If any one asks you about me, say I am your uncle.\"  \"But you are not.\"  \"What difference does that make, you little fool?\" said the blind man, roughly. \"Are you ashamed to own me as your uncle?\"  Frank felt obliged, out of politeness, to say \"No;\" but in his own mind he was not quite sure whether he would be willing to acknowledge any relationship to the disagreeable old man whom he was leading.  They reached Broadway, and entered a store devoted to gentlemen's furnishing goods.  \"Charity for a poor blind man!\" whined Mills, in the tone of a professional beggar.  \"Look here, old fellow, you come in here too often,\" said a young salesman. \"I gave you five cents yesterday.\"  \"I didn't know it,\" said Mills. \"I am a poor blind man. All places are alike to me.\"  \"Then your boy should know better. Nothing for you to-day.\"  Frank and his companion left the store.  In the next they were more fortunate. A nickel was bestowed upon the blind mendicant.  \"How much is it?\" asked Mills, when they were on the sidewalk.  \"Five cents, sir.\"  \"That's better than nothing, but we ought to do better. It takes a good many five-cent pieces to make a dollar. When you see a well-dressed lady coming along, tell me.\"  Frank felt almost as much ashamed as if he were himself begging, but he must do what was expected of him. Accordingly he very soon notified the blind man that a lady was close at hand.  \"Lead me up to her, and say, Can you spare something for my poor, blind uncle?\"  Frank complied in part, but instead of \"poor, blind uncle\" he said \"poor, blind man.\" Mills scowled, as he found himself disobeyed.  \"How long has he been blind?\" asked the lady, sympathetically.  \"For many years,\" whined Mills.  \"Is this your boy?\"  \"Yes, ma'am; he is my young nephew, from the country.\"  \"You are fortunate in having him to go about with you.\"  \"Yes, ma'am; I don't know what I should do without him.\"  \"Here is something for you, my good man,\" said the lady, and passed on.  \"Thank you, ma'am. May Heaven bless you!\"  \"How much is it?\" he asked quickly, when the lady was out of hearing.  \"Two cents,\" answered Frank, suppressing with difficulty an inclination to laugh.  \"The mean jade! I should like to wring her neck!\" muttered Mills. \"I thought it was a quarter, at least.\"  In the next store they did not meet a cordial reception.  \"Clear out, you old humbug!\" shouted the proprietor, who was in ill-humor. \"You ought to be put in the penitentiary for begging about the streets.\"  \"I pray to God that you may become blind yourself,\" said Mills, passionately.  \"Out of my store, or I'll have you arrested, both of you!\" said the angry tradesman. \"Here, you boy, don't you bring that old fraud in this store again, if you know what's best for yourself.\"  There was nothing to do but to comply with this peremptory order.  \"He's a beast!\" snarled Mills; \"I'd like to put his eyes out myself.\"  \"You haven't got a very amiable temper,\" thought Frank. \"I wouldn't like to be blind; but even if I were, I would try to be pleasanter.\"  Two young girls, passing by, noticed the blind man. They were soft-hearted, and stopped to inquire how long he had been blind.  \"Before you were born, my pretty maid,\" said Mills, sighing.  \"I have an aunt who is blind,\" said one of the girls; \"but she is not poor, like you.\"  \"I am very poor,\" whined Mills; \"I have not money enough to pay my rent, and I may be turned out into the street.\"  \"How sad!\" said the young girl, in a tone of deep sympathy. \"I have not much money, but I will give you all I have.\"  \"May God bless you, and spare your eyes!\" said Mills, as he closed his hand upon the money.  \"How much is it?\" he asked as before, when they had passed on.  \"Twenty-five cents,\" said Frank.  \"That is better,\" said Mills, in a tone of satisfaction.  For some time afterwards all applications were refused; in some cases, roughly.  \"Why don't you work?\" asked one man, bluntly.  \"What can I do?\" asked Mills.  \"That's your lookout. Some blind men work. I suppose you would rather get your living by begging.\"  \"I would work my fingers to the bone if I could only see,\" whined Mills.  \"So you say; but I don't believe it. At any rate, that boy of yours can see. Why don't you set him to work?\"  \"He has to take care of me.\"  \"I would work if I could get anything to do,\" said Frank.  As he spoke, he felt his hand pressed forcibly by his companion, who did not relish his answer.  \"I cannot spare him,\" he whined. \"He has to do everything for me.\"  When they were again in the street, Mills demanded, roughly, \"What did you mean by saying that?\"  \"What, sir?\"  \"That you wanted to go to work.\"  \"Because it is true.\"  \"You are at work; you are working for me,\" said Mills.  \"I would rather work in a store, or an office, or sell papers.\"  \"That wouldn't do me any good. Don't speak in that way again.\"  The two were out about a couple of hours, and very tiresome Frank found it. Then Mills indicated a desire to go home, and they went back to the room in the old tenement-house. Mills threw himself down on the bed in the corner, and heaved a sigh of relief.  \"Now, boy, count the money we have collected,\" he said.  \"There's ninety-three cents,\" Frank announced.  \"If I had known it was so near a dollar we would have stayed a little longer. Now, get me my pipe.\"  \"Where is it, sir?\"  \"In the cupboard. Fill it with tobacco, and light it.\"  \"Are you not afraid of setting the bedding on fire, sir?\"  \"Mind your own business. If I choose to set it on fire, I will,\" snarled Mills.  \"Very well, sir; I thought I'd mention it.\"  \"You have mentioned it, and you needn't do it again.\"  \"What a sweet temper you've got!\" thought Frank.  He sat down on a broken chair, and, having nothing else to do, watched his employer. \"He looks very much as if he could see,\" thought Frank; for Mills now had his eyes wide open.  \"What are you staring at me for, boy?\" demanded his employer, rather unexpectedly.  \"What makes you think I am staring at you, sir?\" was Frank's natural question. \"I thought you couldn't see.\"  \"No more I can, but I can tell when one is staring at me. It makes me creep all over.\"  \"Then I'll look somewhere else.\"  \"Would you like to do some work, as you said?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Then take twenty-five cents, and buy some evening papers and sell them; but mind you bring the money to me.\"  \"Yes, sir,\" said Frank, with alacrity.  Anything he thought would be better than sitting in that dull room with so disagreeable a companion.  \"Mind you don't run off with the money,\" said the blind man, sharply. \"If you do I'll have you put in the Tombs.\"  \"I don't mean to run away with the money,\" retorted Frank, indignantly.  \"And when you've sold the papers, come home.\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  With a feeling of relief, Frank descended the stairs and directed his steps to the Park, meaning to ask Dick Rafferty's advice about the proper way to start in business as a newsboy.     CHAPTER V.  FRANK THROWS UP HIS SITUATION.   Frank found his friend on Park Row, and made known his errand.  \"So old Mills wants you to sell papers for his benefit, does he?\"  \"Yes, but I'd rather"]]]
