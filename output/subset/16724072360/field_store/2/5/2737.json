When you've lived in a shack all your life and you suddenly acquire a palace, you cease caring very much what the shack looks like.\"  \"Shack!\" Philip was indignant. \"Why, this house is lovely! Practically every house you've shown me is lovely. Old, yes--but oldness is an essential part of the loveliness of houses. If Pfleugersville is on the order of most housing developments I've seen, you and your neighbors are going to be good and sorry one of these fine days!\"  \"But Pfleugersville isn't on the order of most housing developments you've seen. In fact, it's not a housing development at all. But let's not go into that. Anyway, we're concerned with Valleyview, not Pfleugersville.\"  \"Very well,\" Philip said. \"This afternoon should wind things up so far as the appraising goes.\"         *       *       *       *       *  That evening, after a coffee-less supper--both the gas and the water had been turned off that afternoon--he totaled up his figures. They made quite a respectable sum. He looked across the coffee table, which he had commandeered as a desk, to where Judith, with the dubious help of Zarathustra, was sorting out a pile of manila envelopes which she had placed in the middle of the living-room floor. \"I'll do my best to sell everything,\" he said, \"but it's going to be difficult going till we get a few families living here. People are reluctant about moving into empty neighborhoods, and businessmen aren't keen about opening up business places before the customers are available. But I think it'll work out all right. There's a plaza not far from here that will provide a place to shop until the local markets are functioning, and Valleyview is part of a centralized school district.\" He slipped the paper he had been figuring on into his brief case, closed the case and stood up. \"I'll keep in touch with you.\"  Judith shook her head. \"You'll do nothing of the sort. As soon as you leave, I'm moving to Pfleugersville. My business here is finished.\"  \"I'll keep in touch with you there then. All you have to do is give me your address and phone number.\"  She shook her head again. \"I could give you both, but neither would do you any good. But that's beside the point. Valleyview is your responsibility now--not mine.\"  Philip sat back down again. \"You can start explaining any time,\" he said.  \"It's very simple. The property owners of Valleyview signed all of their houses and places of business over to me. I, in turn, have signed all of them over to you--with the qualification, of course, that after selling them you will be entitled to no more than your usual commission.\" She withdrew a paper from one of the manila envelopes. \"After selling them,\" she went on, \"you are to divide the proceeds equally among the four charities specified in this contract.\" She handed him the paper. \"Do you understand now why I tried so hard to find a trustworthy agent?\"  Philip was staring at the paper, unable, in his astonishment, to read the words it contained. \"Suppose,\" he said presently, \"that circumstances should make it impossible for me to carry out my end of the agreement?\"  \"In case of illness, you will already have taken the necessary steps to transfer the property to another agent who, in your opinion, is as completely honest as you are, and in case of death, you will already have taken the necessary steps to bequeath the property to the same agent; and he, in both cases, will already have agreed to the terms laid down in the contract you're holding in your hands. Why don't you read it?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Now that his astonishment had abated somewhat, Philip found that he could do so. \"But this still doesn't make sense,\" he said a short while later. \"Obviously you and the rest of the owners have purchased new houses. Would it be presumptuous of me to ask how you're going to pay for them when you're virtually giving your old houses away?\"  \"I'm afraid it would be, Mr. Myles.\" She withdrew another paper from the envelope and handed it to him. \"This is the other copy. If you'll kindly affix your signature to both, we can bring our business to a close. As you'll notice, I've already signed.\"  \"But if you're going to be incommunicado,\" Philip pointed out, anger building up in him despite all he could do to stop it, \"what good will your copy do you?\"  Judith's countenance took on a glacial quality. So did her voice. \"My copy will go into the hands of a trusted attorney, sealed in an envelope which I have already instructed him not to open till five years from this date. If, at the time it is opened, you have violated the terms of our agreement, he will institute legal proceedings at once. Fortunately, although the Valleyview post office is closed, a mail truck passes through every weekday evening at eight. It's not that I don't trust you, Mr. Myles--but you are a man, you know.\"  Philip was tempted to tear up the two copies then and there, and toss the pieces into the air. But he didn't, for the very good reason that he couldn't afford to. Instead, he bore down viciously on his pen and brought his name to life twice in large and angry letters. He handed Judith one copy, slipped the other into his breast pocket and got to his feet. \"That,\" he said, \"brings our official business to a close. Now I'd like to add an unofficial word of advice. It seems to me that you're exacting an exorbitant price from the world for your husband's having sold you out for a brunette and a redhead and a pint of Scotch. I've been sold out lots of times for less than that, but I found out long ago that the world doesn't pay its bills even when you ask a fair price for the damages done to you. I suggest that you write the matter off as a bad debt and forget about it; then maybe you'll become a human being again.\"  She had risen to her feet and was standing stiffly before him. She put him in mind of an exquisite and fragile statue, and for a moment he had the feeling that if he were to reach out and touch her, she would shatter into a million pieces. She did not move for some time, nor did he; then she bent down, picked up three of the manila envelopes, straightened, and handed them to him. \"Two of these contain the deeds, maps and other records you will need,\" she said in a dead voice. \"The third contains the keys to the houses and business places. Each key is tagged with the correct address. Good-by, Mr. Myles.\"  \"Good-by,\" Philip said.  He looked around the room intending to say good-by to Zarathustra, but Zarathustra was nowhere to be seen. Finally he went into the hall, opened the front door and stepped out into the night. A full moon was rising in the east. He walked down the moonlit walk, climbed into his car and threw his brief case and the manila envelopes into the back seat. Soon, Valleyview was far behind him.  But not as far as it should have been. He couldn't get the green rose out of his mind. He couldn't get Judith Darrow out of his mind either. Nor could he exorcise the summer breeze that kept wafting through the crevices in his common sense.  A green rose and a grass widow and a breeze with a green breath. A whole town taking off for greener pastures....  He reached into his coat pocket and touched the rose. It was no more than a stem and a handful of petals now, but its reality could not be denied. But roses do not bloom in autumn, and green roses do not bloom at all--  \"Ruf!\"  He had turned into the new highway some time ago, and was driving along it at a brisk sixty-five. Now, disbelievingly, he slowed, and pulled over onto the shoulder. Sure enough, he had a stowaway in the back seat--a tawny-haired stowaway with golden eyes, over-sized ears, and a restless, white-tipped tail. \"Zarathustra!\" he gasped. \"How in the dickens did you get in there?\"  \"Ruf,\" Zarathustra replied.  Philip groaned. Now he would have to go all the way back to Valleyview. Now he would have to see Judith Darrow again. Now he would have to--He paused in midthought, astonished at the abrupt acceleration of his heartbeat. \"Well I'll be damned!\" he said, and without further preamble transferred Zarathustra to the front seat, U-turned, and started back.         *       *       *       *       *  The gasoline lantern had been moved out of the living-room window, but a light still showed beyond the panes. He pulled over to the curb and turned off the ignition. He gave one of Zarathustra's over-sized ears a playful tug, absently noting a series of small nodules along its lower extremity. \"Come on, Zarathustra,\" he said. \"I may as well deliver you personally while I'm at it.\"  After locking the car, he started up the walk, Zarathustra at his heels. He knocked on the front door. Presently he knocked again. The door creaked, swung partially open. He frowned. Had she forgotten to latch it? he wondered. Or had she deliberately left it unlatched so that Zarathustra could get in? Zarathustra himself lent plausibility to the latter conjecture by rising up on his hind legs and pushing the door the rest of the way open with his forepaws, after which he trotted into the hall and disappeared.  Philip pounded on the panels. \"Miss Darrow!\" he called. \"Judith!\"  No answer. He called again. Still no answer.  A summer breeze came traipsing out of the house and engulfed him in the scent of roses. What kind of roses? he wondered. Green ones?  He stepped into the hall and closed the door behind him. He made his way into the living room. The two chairs were gone, and so was the coffee table. He walked through the living room and into the library; through the library and into the dining room. The gasoline lantern burned brightly on the dining-room table, its harsh white light bathing bare floors and naked walls.  The breeze was stronger here, the scent of roses almost cloying. He saw then that the double door that had thwarted him that morning was open, and he moved toward it across the room. As he had suspected, it gave access to the "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23245"],["title","Ancient Ballads and Legends of Hindustan (#1)"],["body","at others. On the whole, the attainment of the book was simply astounding. It consisted of a selection of translations from nearly one hundred French poets, chosen by the poetess herself on a principle of her own which gradually dawned upon the careful reader. She eschewed the Classicist writers as though they had never existed. For her André Chenier was the next name in chronological order after Du Bartas. Occasionally she showed a profundity of research that would have done no discredit to Mr. Saintsbury or \"le doux Assellineau.\" She was ready to pronounce an opinion on Napol le Pyrénéan or to detect a plagiarism in Baudelaire. But she thought that Alexander Smith was still alive, and she was curiously vague about the career of Saint Beuve. This inequality of equipment was a thing inevitable to her isolation, and hardly worth recording, except to show how laborious her mind was, and how quick to make the best of small resources.  We have already seen that the \"Sheaf gleaned in French Fields\" attracted the very minimum of attention in England. In France it was talked about a little more. M. Garcin de Tassy, the famous Orientalist, who scarcely survived Toru by twelve months, spoke of it to Mlle. Clarisse Bader, author of a somewhat remarkable book on the position of women in ancient Indian society. Almost simultaneously this volume fell into the hands of Toru, and she was moved to translate it into English, for the use of Hindus less instructed than herself. In January, 1877, she accordingly wrote to Mlle. Bader requesting her authorization, and received a prompt and kind reply. On the 18th of March Toru wrote again to this, her solitary correspondent in the world of European literature, and her letter, which has been preserved, shows that she had already descended into the valley of the shadow of death:--      Ma constitution n'est pas forte; j'ai contracté une toux opiniâtre,     il y a plus de deux ans, qui ne me quitte point. Cependant j'espère     mettre la main à l'[oe]uvre bientôt. Je ne peux dire, mademoiselle,     combien votre affection,--car vous les aimez, votre livre et votre     lettre en témoignent assez,--pour mes compatriotes et mon pays me     touche; et je suis fière de pouvoir le dire que les héroines de nos     grandes épopées sont dignes de tout honneur et de tout amour. Y     a-ti-il d'héroine plus touchante, plus aimable que Sîta? Je ne le     crois pas. _Quand j'entends ma mère chanter, le soir, les vieux     chants de notre pays, je pleure presque toujours._ La plainte de     Sîta, quand, bannie pour la séconde fois, elle erre dans la vaste     forêt, seule, le désespoir et l'effroi dans l'âme, est si pathétique     qu'il n'y a personne, je crois, qui puisse l'entendre sans verser     des larmes. Je vous envois sous ce pli deux petites traductions du     Sanscrit, cette belle langue antique. Malheureusement j'ai été     obligée de faire cesser mes traductions de Sanscrit, il y a six     mois. Ma santé ne me permet pas de les continuer.  These simple and pathetic words, in which the dying poetess pours out her heart to the one friend she had, and that one gained too late, seem as touching and as beautiful as any strain of Marceline Valmore's immortal verse. In English poetry I do not remember anything that exactly parallels their resigned melancholy. Before the month of March was over, Toru had taken to her bed. Unable to write, she continued to read, strewing her sick-room with the latest European books, and entering with interest into the questions raised by the Société Asiatique of Paris in its printed Transactions. On the 30th of July she wrote her last letter to Mlle. Clarisse Bader, and a month later, on the 30th of August, 1877, at the age of twenty-one years, six months, and twenty-six days, she breathed her last in her father's house in Maniktollah Street, Calcutta.  In the first distraction of grief it seemed as though her unequalled promise had been entirely blighted, and as though she would be remembered only by her single book. But as her father examined her papers, one completed work after another revealed itself. First a selection from the sonnets of the Comte de Grammont, translated into English, turned up, and was printed in a Calcutta magazine; then some fragments of an English story, which were printed in another Calcutta magazine. Much more important, however, than any of these was a complete romance, written in French, being the identical story for which her sister Aru had proposed to make the illustrations. In the meantime Toru was no sooner dead than she began to be famous. In May, 1878, there appeared a second edition of the \"Sheaf gleaned in French Fields,\" with a touching sketch of her death, by her father; and in 1879 was published, under the editorial care of Mlle. Clarisse Bader, the romance of \"Le Journal de Mlle. D'Arvers,\" forming a handsome volume of 259 pages. This book, begun, as it appears, before the family returned from Europe, and finished nobody knows when, is an attempt to describe scenes from modern French society, but it is less interesting as an experiment of the fancy, than as a revelation of the mind of a young Hindu woman of genius. The story is simple, clearly told, and interesting; the studies of character have nothing French about them, but they are full of vigour and originality. The description of the hero is most characteristically Indian.--      Il est beau en effet. Sa taille est haute, mais quelques-uns la     trouveraient mince, sa chevelure noire est bouclée et tombe jusqu'à     la nuque; ses yeux noirs sont profonds et bien fendus, le front est     noble; la lèvre supérieure, couverte par une moustache naissante et     noire, est parfaitement modelée; son menton a quelque chose de     sévère; son teint est d'un blanc presque féminin, ce qui dénote sa     haute naissance.  In this description we seem to recognize some Surya or Soma of Hindu mythology, and the final touch, meaningless as applied to an European, reminds us that in India whiteness of skin has always been a sign of aristocratic birth, from the days when it originally distinguished the conquering Aryas from the indigenous race of the Dasyous.  As a literary composition \"Mlle. D'Arvers\" deserves high commendation. It deals with the ungovernable passion of two brothers for one placid and beautiful girl, a passion which leads to fratricide and madness. That it is a very melancholy and tragical story is obvious from this brief sketch of its contents, but it is remarkable for coherence and self-restraint no less than for vigour of treatment. Toru Dutt never sinks to melodrama in the course of her extraordinary tale, and the wonder is that she is not more often fantastic and unreal.  But we believe that the original English poems, which we present to the public for the first time to-day, will be ultimately found to constitute Toru's chief legacy to posterity. These ballads form the last and most matured of her writings, and were left so far fragmentary at her death that the fourth and fifth in her projected series of nine were not to be discovered in any form among her papers. It is probable that she had not even commenced them. Her father, therefore, to give a certain continuity to the series, has filled up these blanks with two stories from the \"Vishnupurana,\" which originally appeared respectively in the \"Calcutta Review\" and in the \"Bengal Magazine.\" These are interesting, but a little rude in form, and they have not the same peculiar value as the rhymed octo-syllabic ballads. In these last we see Toru no longer attempting vainly, though heroically, to compete with European literature on its own ground, but turning to the legends of her own race and country for inspiration. No modern Oriental has given us so strange an insight into the conscience of the Asiatic as is presented in the stories of \"Prehlad\" and of \"Savitri,\" or so quaint a piece of religious fancy as the ballad of \"Jogadhya Uma.\" The poetess seems in these verses to be chanting to herself those songs of her mother's race to which she always turned with tears of pleasure. They breathe a Vedic solemnity and simplicity of temper, and are singularly devoid of that littleness and frivolity which seem, if we may judge by a slight experience, to be the bane of modern India.  As to the merely technical character of these poems, it may be suggested that in spite of much in them that is rough and inchoate, they show that Toru was advancing in her mastery of English verse. Such a stanza as this, selected out of many no less skilful, could hardly be recognized as the work of one by whom the language was a late acquirement:--      What glorious trees! The sombre saul,       On which the eye delights to rest,--     The betel-nut, a pillar tall,       With feathery branches for a crest,--     The light-leaved tamarind spreading wide,--       The pale faint-scented bitter neem,     The seemul, gorgeous as a bride,       With flowers that have the ruby's gleam.  In other passages, of course, the text reads like a translation from some stirring ballad, and we feel that it gives but a faint and discordant echo of the music welling in Toru's brain. For it must frankly be confessed that in the brief May-day of her existence she had not time to master our language as Blanco White did, or as Chamisso mastered German. To the end of her days, fluent and graceful as she was, she was not entirely conversant with English, especially with the colloquial turns of modern speech. Often a very fine thought is spoiled for hypercritical ears by the queer turn of expression which she has innocently given to it. These faults are found to a much smaller degree in her miscellaneous poems. Her sonnets, here printed for the first time, seem to me to be of great beauty, and her longer piece entitled \"Our Casuarina Tree,\" needs no apology for its rich and mellifluous numbers.  It is difficult to exaggerate when we try to estimate what we have "]]]
