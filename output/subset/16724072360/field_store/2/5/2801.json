There's nothin' doin' apparently in this poort.  Annyhow I can't git work, an' I've a wife an' chick at home, who've bin so long used to praties and bacon that their stummicks don't take kindly to fresh air fried in nothin'.  So ye see, sur, findin' it difficult to make a livin' above ground, I'm disposed to try to make it under water.\"  While Rooney Machowl was speaking Baldwin regarded him with a fixed and critical gaze.  What his opinion of the recruit was did not, however, appear on his countenance or in his reply, for he merely said, \"Humph! Well, we'll see.  You'll begin your education in your noo profession by payin' partikler attention to all that is said an' done around you.\"  \"Yis, sur,\" returned Machowl, respectfully touching the peak of his cap and wrinkling his forehead very much, while he looked on at the further proceedings of the divers with that expression of deep earnest sincerity of attention which--whether assumed or genuine--is only possible to the countenance of an Irishman.  During this colloquy the two men standing by the pump-case, and two other men who appeared to be supernumeraries, listened with much interest, but the diver seated on the plank, resting and calmly smoking his pipe, gazed with apparent indifference at the sea, from which he had recently emerged.  This man was a very large fellow, with a dark surly countenance--not exactly bad in expression, but rather ill-tempered-looking.  His diving-dress being necessarily very wide and baggy, made him seem larger than he really was--indeed, quite gigantic.  The dress was made of very thick india-rubber cloth, and all--feet, legs, body, and arms--was of one piece, so perfectly secured at the seams as to be thoroughly impervious to air or water.  To get into it was a matter of some difficulty, the entrance being effected at the neck.  When this neck is properly attached to the helmet, the diver is thoroughly cut off from the external world, except through the air-tube communicating with his helmet and the pump afore mentioned.  \"Have ye got the hole finished, Maxwell?\" said Baldwin, turning to the surly diver.  \"Yes,\" he replied shortly.  \"Well, then, go down and fix the charge.  Here it is,\" said Baldwin, taking from a wooden case an object about eighteen inches long, which resembled a large office-ruler that had been coated thickly with pitch. It was an elongated shell filled to the muzzle with gunpowder.  To one end of it was fastened the end of a coil of wire which was also coated with some protecting substance.  As Baldwin spoke Maxwell slowly puffed the last \"draw\" from his lips and knocked the ashes out of his pipe on the plank, on which he still remained seated while the two supernumeraries busied themselves in completing his toilet for him; one screwing on his helmet, which appeared ridiculously large, the other loading his breast and back with two heavy leaden weights.  When fully equipped, the diver carried on his person a weight fully equal to that of his own bulky person.  \"Now look here, Mister Edgar, an' pay partikler attention, Rooney Machowl.  This here toobe, made of indyrubber, d'ee see?  (`Yis, sur,' from Rooney) I fix on, as you perceive, to the back of Maxwell's helmet. It communicates with that there pump, and when these two men work the pump, air will be forced into the helmet and into the dress down to his very toes.  We could bu'st him, if we were so disposed, if it wasn't for an escape-valve, here close beside the air-toobe, at the back of the helmet, which keeps lettin' off the surplus air.  Moreover, there is another valve, here in front of the breast-plate, which is under the control of the diver, so that he can let air escape by givin' it a half-turn when the men at the pumps are givin' him too much, or he can keep it in when they're givin' him enough.\"  \"An' what does he do,\" asked Rooney, with an anxious expression, \"whin they give him too little?\"  \"He pulls on the air-pipe,--as I'll explain to you in good time--the proper signal for `more air.'\"  \"But what if he forgits, or misremimbers the signal?\" asked the inquisitive recruit.  \"Why then,\" replied Baldwin, \"he suffocates, and we pull him up dead, an' give him decent burial.  Keep yourself easy, my lad, an' you'll know all about it in good time.  I'll soon give 'ee the chance to suffocate or bu'st yourself accordin' to taste.\"  \"Come, cut it short and look alive,\" said Maxwell gruffly, as he stood up to permit of a stout rope being fastened to his waist.  \"You shut up!\" retorted Baldwin.  Having exchanged these little civilities the two divers moved to the side of the barge--Maxwell with a slow ponderous tread.  A short iron ladder dipped from the gunwale of the barge a few feet down into the sea.  The diver stepped upon this, turning with his face inwards, descended knee-deep into the water, and then stopped.  Baldwin handed him the blasting-charge.  At the same moment one of the supernumeraries advanced with the front-glass or bull's-eye in his hand, and the men at the pumps gave a turn or two to see that all was working well.  \"All right?\" demanded the supernumerary.  \"Right,\" responded Maxwell, in a voice which issued sepulchrally from the iron globe.  There are three round windows fitted with thick plate-glass in the helmets to which we refer.  The front one is made to screw off and on, and the fixing of this is always the last operation in completing a diver's toilet.  \"Pump away,\" said the man, holding the round glass in front of Maxwell's nose, and looking over his shoulder to see that the order was obeyed. The glass was screwed on, and the man finished off by gravely patting Maxwell in an affectionate manner on the head.  \"Why does he pat him so?\" asked Edgar, with a laugh at the apparent tenderness of the act.  \"It's a tinder farewell, I suppose,\" murmured Rooney, \"in case he niver comes up again.\"  \"It is to let him know that he may now descend in safety,\" answered Baldwin.  \"The pump there is kep' goin' from a few moments before the front-glass is screwed on till the diver shows his head above water again--which he'll do in quarter of an hour or so, for it don't take long to lay a charge; but our ordinary spell under water, when work is steady, is about four hours--more or less--with perhaps a breath of ten minutes once or twice at the surface when they're working deep.\"  \"But why a breath at the surface?\" asked Edgar.  \"Isn't the air sent down fresh enough?\"  \"Quite fresh enough, Mister Edgar, but the pressure when we go deep--say ten or fifteen fathoms--is severe on a man if long continued, so that he needs a little relief now and then.  Some need more and some less relief, accordin' to their strength.  Maxwell has only gone down fifteen feet, so that he wouldn't need to come up at all durin' a spell of work. We're goin' to blast a big rock that has bin' troublesome to us at low water.  The hole was driven in it last week.  We moored a raft over it and kep' men at work with a long iron jumper that reached from the rock to the surface of the sea.  It was finished last night, and now he's gone to fix the charge.\"  \"But I don't understand about the pressure, sur, at all at all,\" said Machowl, with a complicated look of puzzlement; \"sure whin I putt my hand in wather I don't feel no pressure whatsomediver.\"  \"Of course not,\" responded Baldwin, \"because you don't put it deep enough.  You must know that our atmosphere presses on our bodies with a weight of about 20,000 pounds.  Well, if you go thirty-two feet deep in the sea you get the pressure of exactly another atmosphere, which means that you've got to stand a pressure all over your body of 40,000 when you've got down as deep as thirty-two feet.\"  \"But,\" objected Rooney, \"I don't fed no pressure of the atmosphere on me body at all.\"  \"That's because you're squeezed by the air inside of you, man, as well as by the atmosphere outside, which takes off the _feelin'_ of it, an', moreover, you're used to it.  If the weight of our atmosphere was took off your outside and not took off your inside--your lungs an' the like,--you'd come to feel it pretty strong, for you'd swell like a balloon an' bu'st a'most, if not altogether.\"  Baldwin paused a moment and regarded the puzzled countenance of his pupil with an air of pity.  \"Contrairywise,\" he continued, \"if the air was all took out of your inside an' allowed to remain on your outside, you'd go squash together like a collapsed indyrubber ball.  Well then, if that be so with one atmosphere, what must it be with a pressure equal to two, which you have when you go down to thirty-two feet deep in the sea?  An' if you go down to twenty-five fathoms, or 150 feet, which is often done, what must the pressure be there?\"  \"Tightish, no doubt,\" said Rooney.  \"True, lad,\" continued Joe.  \"Of course, to counteract this we must force more air down to you the deeper you go, so that the pressure inside of you may be a little more than the pressure outside, in order to force the foul air out of the dress through the escape-valve; and what between the one an' the other your sensations are peculiar, you may be sure.--But come, young man, don't be alarmed.  We'll not send you down very deep at first.  If some divers go down as deep as twenty-five fathoms, surely you'll not be frightened to try two and a half.\"  Whatever Rooney's feelings might have been, the judicious allusion to the possibility of his being frightened was sufficient to call forth the emphatic assertion that he was ready to go down two thousand fathoms if they had ropes long enough and weights heavy enough to sink him!  While the recruit is preparing for his subaqueous experiments, you and I, reader, will go see what Maxwell is about at the bottom of the sea.    CHAPTER TWO.  DESCRIBES A FIRST VISIT TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA.  When the diver received the encouraging pat on the head, as already related, he descended the ladder to its "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23494"],["title","Notable Voyagers, From Columbus to Nordenskiold (#1)"],["body","took to be some extreme point of Tartary.  These facts being made known to Columbus, served to strengthen his opinion.  The success indeed of his undertaking depended greatly on two happy errors: the imaginary extent of Asia to the east, and the supposed smallness of the earth.  A deep religious sentiment mingled with his meditations.  He looked upon himself as chosen by Heaven for the accomplishment of its purposes, that the ends of the earth might be brought together, and all nations and tongues united under the banner of the Redeemer.  The enthusiastic nature of his conceptions gave an elevation to his spirit, and dignity and eloquence to his whole demeanour.  He never spoke in doubt or hesitation, but with as much certainty as if his eyes had beheld the promised land.  No trial or disappointment could divert him from the steady pursuit of his object.  That object, it is supposed, he meditated as early as the year 1474, though as yet it lay crude and immatured in his mind. Shortly afterwards, in the year 1477, he made a voyage to the north of Europe, navigating one hundred leagues beyond Thule, when he reached an island as large as England, generally supposed to have been Iceland.  In vain he had applied to Don John the Second, who ascended the throne of Portugal in 1481.  That king was so deeply engaged in sending out expeditions to explore the African coast that his counsellors advised him to confine his efforts in that direction.  He would, however, have given his consent had not Columbus demanded such high and honourable rewards as were considered inadmissible.  To his eternal disgrace the Bishop of Ceuta advised that Columbus should be kept in suspense while a vessel was secretly dispatched in the direction he pointed out, to ascertain if there was any truth in his story.  This was actually done, until the caravel meeting with stormy weather, and an interminable waste of wild tumbling waves, the pilots lost courage and returned.  Columbus, indignant at this attempt to defraud him, his wife having died some time previously, resolved to abandon the country which had acted so treacherously.  He first sent his brother Bartholomew to make proposals to Henry the Seventh, King of England; but that sovereign rejected his offers, and having again made a proposal to Genoa, which, from the reverses she had lately received, she was unable to accept, he turned his eyes to Spain.  The great Spanish Dukes of Medina Sidonia and Medina Coeli, were at first inclined to support him, and the latter spoke of him to Queen Isabella, who giving a favourable reply, Columbus set off for the Spanish Court, then at Cordova.  The sovereigns of Castile and Arragon were, however, so actively engaged in carrying on the fierce war with the Moors of Grenada, that they were unable to give due attention to the scheme of the navigator, while their counsellors generally derided his proposals.  The beautiful and enlightened Isabella treated him from the first with respect, and other friends rose up who were ready to give him support.  Wearied and discouraged by long delays, however, he had again opened up negotiations with the King of Portugal, and had been requested by that monarch to return there.  He had also received a letter from Henry the Seventh of England, inviting him to his Court, and holding out promises of encouragement, when he was again summoned to attend the Castilian Court, and a sum of money was sent him to defray his expenses, King Ferdinand probably fearing that he would carry his proposals to a rival monarch, and wishing to keep the matter in suspense until he had leisure to examine it.  He accordingly repaired to the Court of Seville.  While he was there two monks arrived with a message from the Grand Soldan of Egypt, threatening to put to death all the Christians and to destroy the Holy Sepulchre if the Spanish sovereigns did not desist from war against Grenada.  The menace had no effect in altering their purpose, but it aroused the indignation of the Spanish cavaliers, and still more so that of Columbus, and made them burn with ardent zeal once more to revive the contest of faith on the sacred plains of Palestine.  Columbus had indeed resolved, should his projected enterprise prove successful, to devote the profits from his anticipated discoveries to a crusade for the rescue of the Holy Sepulchre from the power of the infidels.  During the latter part of the year 1490 Ferdinand and Isabella were engaged in celebrating the marriage of their eldest daughter, the Princess Isabella, with Prince Don Alonzo, heir apparent of Portugal. Bearing these long and vexatious delays as he had before done, Columbus supported himself chiefly by making maps and charts, occasionally assisted from the purse of his friend Diego de Deza.  The year was passing on.  Columbus was kept in a state of irritating anxiety at Cordova, when he heard that the sovereigns were about to commence that campaign which ended in the expulsion of the Moors from Spain.  Aware that many months must pass before they would give their minds to the subject if he allowed the present moment to slip by, he pressed for a decisive reply to his proposals with an earnestness that would admit of no evasion.  The learned men of the council were directed to express their opinion of the enterprise.  The report of each was unfavourable, although the worthy friar Diego de Deza, tutor to Prince John, and several others, urged the sovereigns not to lose the opportunity of extending their dominions and adding so greatly to their glory.  Again, however, Columbus was put off.  Having no longer confidence in the vague promises which had hitherto been made, he turned his back on Seville, resolved to offer to the King of France the honour of carrying out his magnificent undertaking.  Leaving Seville, his means exhausted, he travelled on foot, leading his young son Diego by the hand, to the sea-port of Palos de Moguer in Andalusia.  Weary and exhausted, he stopped to ask for bread and water at the gate of the ancient Franciscan convent of Santa Maria de Rabida.  The Prior, Juan Perez de Marchena, happening to come up, and remarking the appearance of the stranger, entered into conversation with him.  The Prior, a man of superior information, was struck with the grandeur of his views, and when he found that the navigator was on the point of abandoning Spain to seek patronage in the Court of France, and that so important an enterprise was about to be lost for ever to the country, his patriotism took the alarm.  He entertained Columbus as his guest, and invited a scientific friend--a physician--Garcia Fernandez, to converse with him.  Fernandez was soon captivated by his conversation.  Frequent conferences took place, at which several of the veteran mariners of Palos were present.  Among these was Martin Alonzo Pinzon, the head of a family of wealthy and experienced navigators.  Facts were related by some of the mariners in support of the theory of Columbus, and so convinced was Pinzon of the feasibility of his project, that he offered to engage in it with purse and person.  The Prior, who had once been confessor to the Queen, was confirmed in his faith by the opinions expressed, and he proposed writing to her immediately, and entreated Columbus to delay his journey until an answer could be received.  It was decided to send Sebastian Rodriguez, a shrewd and clever pilot, to Santa Fe, where the Queen then was.  Isabella had always been favourable to Columbus, and the Prior received a reply desiring that he himself should repair to Court.  He went, and, seconded by the Marchioness of Moya and other old friends, so impressed the Queen with the importance of the undertaking, that she desired Columbus might be sent for, and ordered that seventy-two dollars, equal to two hundred and sixteen of the present day, might be forwarded to him, to bear his travelling expenses.  With his hopes raised to the highest pitch, Columbus again repaired to Court; but so fully occupied was he with the grandeur of his enterprise, that he stipulated that he should be invested with the title and privilege of admiral, and viceroy over the countries he should discover, with one-tenth of all gains, either by trade or conquest.  It must be remembered the pious and patriotic way--according to his notions--in which he intended to expend the wealth he hoped to acquire.  The courtiers were indignant, and sneeringly observed that his arrangement was a secure one, that he was sure of a command, and had nothing to lose.  On this he offered to furnish one-eighth of the cost, on condition of enjoying one-eighth of the profit.  The King looked coldly on the affair, and once more the sovereigns of Spain declined the offer. Columbus was at length again about to set off on his journey to Palos, when the generous spirit of Isabella was kindled by the remarks of the Marchioness of Moya, supported by Louis de Saint Angel, Receiver of the Ecclesiastical Revenues in Arragon.  She exclaimed, \"I undertake the enterprise for my own crown of Castile, and will pledge my jewels to raise the necessary funds!\"  This was the proudest moment in the life of Isabella, as it stamped her as the patroness of the great discovery.  Saint Angel assured her there was no necessity for pledging her jewels, and expressed his readiness to advance seventeen thousand florins.  A messenger was dispatched to bring back the navigator, with the assurance that all he desired would be granted; and so, turning the reins of his mule, he hastened back with joyful alacrity to Santa Fe, confiding in the noble probity of the Queen.  Articles of agreement were drawn up by the royal secretary at once. Columbus was to have for himself during his life, and his heirs and successors for ever, the office of admiral of all lands and continents which he might discover.  Secondly: He was to be viceroy and governor-general over them.  Thirdly: He was to be entitled to receive for"]]]
