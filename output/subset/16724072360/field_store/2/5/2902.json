PERIOD VII  PROBLEMS OF THE NEW CENTURY  1902-1912   CHAPTER I  THE RISE OF THEODORE ROOSEVELT  [1900]  Theodore Roosevelt was born in New York City, October 27, 1858. He was graduated from Harvard in 1880. At the age of twenty-three he entered the New York State Assembly, where he served six years with great credit. Two years he was a \"cowboy\" in Dakota. He was United States Civil Service Commissioner and President of the New York City Police Board. In 1897 he became Assistant Secretary of the Navy, holding this position long enough to indite the despatch which took Dewey to Manila. He then raised the first United States Volunteer Cavalry, commonly spoken of as \"Rough Riders,\" and went to Cuba as their lieutenant-colonel. Gallantry at Las Guasimas made him their colonel, the first colonel, Leonard Wood, having received a brigadier-general's commission. Returning from the war, Colonel Roosevelt found himself, as by a magic metamorphosis, Governor of his State, fighting civic battles against growing corporate abuses. He urged compulsory publicity for the affairs of monopolistic combinations, and was prominently instrumental in the enactment of the New York Franchise Tax Law.  The party managers in the 1900 convention hoped by making him Vice-President to remove him from competition for the presidency in 1904. But the most unexpected of the many swift transitions in his career foiled their calculations and brought him in a moment to the summit of a citizen's ambition.  The new chief magistrate was no less honest, fearless, or public-spirited than the recent one; it only remained to be seen whether he were not less astute and cautious. Coming to the office as he did, he was absolutely unfettered, which, in one of so frank a temperament, might prove a danger. He was more popular with the people than with politicians. Though highly educated and used to the best associations, he was more approachable than any of his predecessors. At a public dinner which he attended, one round of cheers was given him as \"the President of the United States\" another as \"Roosevelt,\" and a third as \"Teddy.\" Had McKinley been in his place a corresponding variation would have been unthinkable.   [Illustration: Portrait.] From a copyrighted photograph by Pach Bros., N. Y. Theodore Roosevelt.   President Roosevelt's temper and method were in pointed contrast to McKinley's. Whereas McKinley seemed simply to hold the tiller, availing himself of currents that to the eye deviously, yet easily and inevitably, bore him to his objective, Roosevelt strenuously plied the oar, recking little of cross currents or head winds, if, indeed, he did not delight in them. Chauncey Depew aptly styled McKinley \"a Western man with Eastern ideas.\" Roosevelt, \"an Eastern man with Western ideas.\" This aspect of the new President's character gave him hold on both West and East. Roosevelt was the first President since William Henry Harrison to bring to his office the vigor and freshness of the frontier, as he was, anomalously, the first city-born or wealthy-born incumbent.   [Illustration: Roosevelt on horseback.] Theodore Roosevelt, as Lieut.-Colonel of the \"Rough Riders.\"   [1901]  The members of President McKinley's cabinet were invited to retain their portfolios, which they agreed to do. At the time, Roosevelt was reputed to be the foremost civil service reformer in the country. Politicians were  soon made aware that the President regarded fitness for office as the first test. Unfortunately during the presidency of McKinley, some 8000 offices had been taken out of the competitive lists. During Roosevelt's first term, however, the list of offices placed under the merit system was greatly extended. Within the twenty-one years from the enactment of the first national civil service reform law wonders had been accomplished in that more than one-half of the 300,000 offices in the executive civil service were placed in the classified competitive service.  President Roosevelt stood for liberal reciprocity with Cuba, urging this, at first, with results disastrous to party harmony. He was vindicated by public opinion, but learned wisdom. Though believed to be favorable to a decided easing of custom-house levies, his administration soon frankly avowed itself unable to proceed further than high- protectionists would follow. The evidence of his tariff convictions won him strong support in the West, which was prepared to go greater lengths than he. In the congressional campaign of 1902, ex-Speaker Henderson, of Iowa, a stanch protectionist, withdrew from public life, as was supposed, rather than misrepresent himself by acceding to tariff reform or his constituents by opposing it.  Mr. Roosevelt signalized his accession by an effort to make the federal anti-trust law something more than a cumberer of the statute-book. His inaugural message and innumerable addresses of his boldly handled the whole trust evil and called for the regulation of capitalistic combinations in the interest of the public.  Appreciation of the President's attitude on these matters may be assisted by some notice of the then threatening vigor and universality of the movement toward industrial combination. Mr. Beck, Assistant Attorney-General of the United States, declared in 1892:  \"Excessive capitalization of corporations, dishonest management by their executive officers, the destruction of the rights of the minority, the theft of public utilities, the subordination of public interests to private gain, the debauchery of our local legislatures and executive officers, and the corruption of the elective franchise, have resulted from the facility afforded by the law to corporations to concentrate the control of colossal wealth in the hands of a few men . . . . The question presses ever more importunately for decision whether these marvellous aggregations of capital can be subordinated to the very laws which created them.\"  Legislation in many States, the enactment of the Sherman anti-trust law by Congress, and the decision of the Supreme Court in the Trans-Missouri case rendered insecure trust agreements of the old type, in which constituent corporations surrendered the control of their affairs to trustees. But the current merely shifted to a different channel, the trust proper giving way to the giant corporation having the same aims, methods, and efficiency, while, as more legal, it was less vulnerable.  In the railway world, \"community of interest\" assumed the place of pooling agreements. The Union Pacific acquired large holdings from Collis P. Huntington's estate and controlled the Southern Pacific. The power behind the Southern Railway got control of nearly all the other Southern railways, including the Atlantic Coast Line, the Plant System, and at last even the Louisville and Nashville. The New York Central dominated the other Vanderbilt roads. The Pennsylvania secured decisive amounts of Baltimore and Ohio stock, as well as weighty interests in the Chesapeake and Ohio and the Norfolk and Western, and so on.  [1902]   [Illustration: Portrait.] Collis P. Huntington.   Great banking establishments, foremost among them the house of J. P. Morgan & Co., took to financing these schemes. Morgan re-organized the Northern Pacific, and it would forthwith have pooled issues with the Great Northern but for opposition by the State of Minnesota. James J. Hill was master of the Great Northern, and confidence existed between him and Morgan.  They wished a secure outlet for the products of the Northwest, also access to Chicago over a line of their own. After a survey of the field the promoters selected as the most available for the latter office the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy. Purchase of shares in this corporation was quietly begun. Soon the Burlington road was apparently in hand. Prices rose.   [Illustration: Portrait.] Copyright. 1902. by Pach Bros., N. Y. James J. Hill.  The Union Pacific control perceived in the aggression of the two northern lines a menace to its northwestern and Pacific coast connections. The Union Pacific leader, E. H. Harriman, resorted to an unexpected coup. He attempted to purchase the Northern Pacific, Burlington and all. A mysterious demand, set Northern Pacific shares soaring. The stock reached $1,000 a share and none was obtainable. Panic arose; bankers and brokers faced ruin.  The two sides now declared a truce. The Northern Securities Company was created, with a capital approaching a billion dollars, to take over the Burlington, Northern Pacific, and Great Northern stocks.   [Illustration: Portrait.] E. H. Harriman.   The States of Minnesota and Washington, unable in their own courts to thwart this plan, sought the intervention of the United States Supreme Court. Their suit was vain till the Administration came to the rescue. At the instance of the Attorney-General, an injunction issued from the high court named forbidding the Securities Company to receive the control of the roads, and the holders of the railroad stocks involved to give it over. It was observed, however, that at the very time of the above proceedings the Southern Railways' "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24025"],["title","The New Girl at St. Chad's: A Story of School Life (#1)"],["body"," dentist says. There only seems to be one in each cubicle, but as I'm the visitor----\"  \"Take care!\" screamed Maisie. \"My clean blouses!\"  \"What am I doing? I declare, I never saw them. There, I'll nurse them for you while I eat this delicious-looking piece of pink rock.\"  The new girl was so utterly different from anybody else who had ever come to St. Chad's that the others waited with curiosity to hear what she would say next.  \"Well?\" she enquired coolly at last. \"I suppose you're thinking me over. I should like to know your opinion of me. They tell me at home that my nose turns up, and my tongue is too long. But I didn't turn up my nose at the Edinburgh rock, did I?--and as for my tongue, it fits my mouth, as a general rule, though it runs away sometimes.\"  \"When did you come?\"  \"What class are you in?\"  \"Have you seen Miss Cavendish yet?\"  \"How old are you?\"  \"Have you been to school before?\"  \"Do you know anyone here?\"  \"Why did you come to St. Chad's?\"  The questions were fired off all together from seven pairs of lips.  \"One at a time, please!\" returned Honor. \"I'm older than I look, and younger than I seem. You mayn't believe me, yet I assure you I've only had three birthdays.\"  \"Rubbish!\" said Chatty Burns.  \"It's a fact, all the same.\"  \"But how could that be?\" demanded Pauline Reynolds incredulously.  \"Because I was born on the twenty-ninth of February, and I can't have a birthday except in a leap year. That accounts for anything odd there is about me; so if you find me queer, you must just say: 'She's a twenty-ninth of February girl', and make excuses for me. As for the other questions, I've never been to school before; I've seen Miss Cavendish, but I haven't heard yet what class I'm to be in; five minutes ago I didn't know anybody here, but now I know--how many are there of you?--one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine!\"  \"Have you unpacked yet?\" asked Maisie, returning to her box, which Lettice had been steadily emptying.  \"Only about half.\"  \"I think we had better come and help you, then.\"  \"Better finish our own first!\" grunted Lettice, for which remark she was promptly snubbed by her elder sister.  \"Miss Maitland will be up at eight o'clock to look at our drawers,\" said Chatty Burns. \"She'll expect you to have everything put away, and your coats and dresses hung in the wardrobe.\"  \"We have to be so fearfully tidy here!\" sighed Adeline Vaughan. \"A warden comes round each morning, and woe betide you if you leave hairs in your brush, or have forgotten to fold your nightdress!\"  \"It's just as bad at St. Hilary's,\" said Madge.  \"And worse at St. Bride's,\" added Ruth Latimer.  \"My father wanted me to be at the School House,\" said Honor, \"but Miss Cavendish wrote that it was full, so I was entered at St. Chad's instead.\"  \"Yes, you generally need to have your name down for two years before you can get a vacancy at the School House,\" said Dorothy Arkwright. \"It's the popular favourite with parents, because Miss Cavendish herself is the Head; but really, St. Chad's is far nicer. We all stand up for our own house, and I know you'll like it.\"  \"There's the tea-bell! Come along! we must go at once,\" interrupted Chatty Burns.  \"Won't they wait for us?\" enquired Honor, beginning to wash her hands with much deliberation.  \"Wait! She asks if they'll wait!\" exclaimed Adeline Vaughan.  \"One can see you've never been to school before!\" commented Maisie Talbot. \"No, you certainly haven't time to comb your hair now. You had better follow the rest of us as fast as you can.\"  St. Chad's could accommodate forty pupils, and Honor found a place assigned to her in the dining-hall near the end of a long table, which looked very attractive with its clean white cloth, its pretty china, and its vases of flowers in the middle. She had a good view of her schoolfellows, more than half of whom seemed of about the same age as herself, though there were tall girls, with their hair already put up, and a few younger ones who had apparently only just entered their teens. Grace was sung, and then the urns began to fill an almost ceaseless stream of cups, while plates of bread and butter circulated with much rapidity.  \"We're late to-day,\" explained Honor's neighbour, \"because the train from the North does not get in until five. Our usual tea-time is four o'clock, after games; then we have supper at half-past seven, when we've finished evening preparation. Did you bring any jam? Your hamper will be unpacked to-morrow, and the pots labelled with your name. I expect you'll find one opposite your plate at breakfast. Jam and marmalade are the only things we're allowed, except plain cakes.\"  Tea on the first afternoon was generally an exciting occasion at St. Chad's. There were so many greetings between old friends, so much news and such various topics to be discussed, that conversation, in a sufficiently subdued undertone, went on very briskly. The girls had enjoyed their Easter holidays, but most of them seemed pleased to return to school, for the summer term was always the favourite at Chessington College.  \"Have you heard who's in the Eleven?\" began Madge Summers. \"They've actually put in Grace Shaw, and she bowls abominably. I think it's rank favouritism on Miss Young's part. She always gives St. Hilary's a turn when she can.\"  \"She was a Hilaryite herself,\" returned Adeline Vaughan. \"That's the worst of having a games mistress who's been educated at the school; she's sure to show partiality for her old house.\"  \"And yet in one way it's better, because she understands all our customs and private rules. It would be almost impossible to explain everything to a new-comer.\"  \"What about the house team?\" asked Ruth Latimer. \"Is anything fixed?\"  \"Not yet. There's to be a practice to-morrow, and it will go by our scores.\"  \"I shall stick to tennis,\" declared Pauline Reynolds. \"One gets a fair chance there, at any rate, and we must keep up the credit of St. Chad's in the courts. I don't know whether we've any chance of winning the shield. I wish we could get a real champion!\"  \"You should see Flossie Taylor play!\" burst out Edith and Claudia Hammond-Smith, who were anxious to bring their cousin forward, and to ensure her popularity among the other girls.  \"I've not heard that she made any record at St. Bride's,\" remarked Dorothy Arkwright, who resented Flossie's removal to St. Chad's.  \"She hasn't had an opportunity. She only came to school last Christmas, and it wasn't the tennis season. Wait till you see her serve!\"  \"Miss Young will have to be judge, not I,\" replied Dorothy coldly.  \"Flossie is in your bedroom, Dorothy,\" announced Claudia. \"She has the cubicle near the fireplace.\"  \"If you're sleeping in the bed next to mine,\" said Flossie, eyeing Dorothy across the table with a rather patronizing air, \"I sincerely hope you don't snore.\"  \"Of course not!\" responded Dorothy, in some indignation.  \"At St. Bride's,\" continued Flossie, \"one of my room-mates snored atrociously. I used to have to get up and shake her, and pull the pillow from under her head, before I could go to sleep.\"  \"You'd better not try that on with me!\"  \"I would, in a minute, if you kept me awake.\"  \"It is a shame she's not in our room,\" interposed Edith. \"We've asked Miss Maitland to let her change with Geraldine Saunders, and I think perhaps she may. We want Flossie all to ourselves; I do hope she'll let us!\"  \"So do I!\" retorted Dorothy feelingly. \"The Hammond-Smiths are welcome to their cousin, so far as I'm concerned,\" she whispered to Chatty Burns; \"I don't like her. She's trying to show off. Edith and Claudia are making far too much fuss over her.\"  \"They always gush,\" commented Chatty. \"Still, I dare say Flossie will need taking down a little.\"  \"It would do her all the good in the world,\" replied Dorothy. Then, turning to the Hammond-Smiths, she remarked aloud: \"There's a new girl here who may be just as good as your cousin, for anything we know. Honor Fitzgerald, do you play tennis?\"  \"I can play, but how you'll like it is another story,\" answered Honor. \"We two,\" nodding at Flossie, \"had better try a set by ourselves, and then you can choose the winner.\"  \"I'm sure I don't care about it, thank you.\" Flossie's tone was supercilious.  \"All right! We don't force ourselves where we're not wanted in my part of the world.\"  \"Is that Ireland? Then I suppose your name is Biddy?\"  \"Certainly not!\"  \"I thought all Irish girls were called Biddy; are you sure you're not?\"  \"My name is Honor Fitzgerald.\"  \"Really! I'm astonished it isn't Mulligan, or O'Grady.\"  The Hammond-Smiths giggled, and poked Effie and Blanche Lawson.  \"Isn't Flossie funny?\" they whispered delightedly.  \"I think she's very rude,\" observed Dorothy Arkwright. \"I call that an extremely cheap form of wit.\"  \"Irish names are often rather peculiar,\" drawled Claudia Hammond-Smith.  \"They're quite as good as English ones, and sometimes a great deal more ancient and aristocratic,\" returned Honor.  \"One for Claudia, and for Flossie Taylor too!\" said Dorothy to Chatty Burns.  \"Paddy, for instance,\" interposed Flossie, who saw that the Lawsons were listening, as well as her cousins. \"St. Patrick and pigs always go together, in my mind. I suppose you keep a pig in Ireland?\"  \"Don't answer her!\" whispered Honor's neighbour. \"They're only teasing you because you're new. They want to see how much you'll stand.\"  But poor Honor was unaccustomed as yet to schoolgirl banter, and could not abstain from replying:  \"Does it matter whether we do or not?\"  She spoke quietly, but there was a gleam in her eye, as if her temper were rising.  \"Not in the least! I only thought all Irish people cultivated pigs.\"  \"It's no worse than keeping a cat, or a dog.\"  \"My dear Paddy, of course not! Still, I shouldn't care to have the creatures in the drawing-room. Take a little more bread and butter. I'm sorry we've no potatoes to offer you.\"  The Hammond-Smiths and the Lawsons tittered, and Dorothy Arkwright was about to "]]]
