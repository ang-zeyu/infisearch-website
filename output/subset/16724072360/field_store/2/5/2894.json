Not only were the standard works       of European literature perused, but two more languages—namely       Italian and Spanish—were added to his original stock: French,       English, Latin and German having been acquired at the Lyceum. To this       happy union of literary research with the study of nature we must       attribute the sudden bound by which he soon afterwards attained the       pinnacle of poetic fame amongst his own countrymen.            In 1824 he once more fell under the imperial displeasure. A letter seized       in the post, and expressive of atheistical sentiments (possibly but a       transient vagary of his youth) was the ostensible cause of his banishment       from Odessa to his paternal estate of Mikhailovskoe in the province of       Pskoff. Some, however, aver that personal pique on the part of Count       Vorontsoff, the Governor of Odessa, played a part in the transaction. Be       this as it may, the consequences were serious for the poet, who was not       only placed under the surveillance of the police, but expelled from the       Foreign Office by express order of the Tsar “for bad conduct.” A letter on       this subject, addressed by Count Vorontsoff to Count Nesselrode, is an       amusing instance of the arrogance with which stolid mediocrity frequently       passes judgment on rising genius. I transcribe a portion thereof:            Odessa, 28_th March_ (7_th April_) 1824            Count—Your Excellency is aware of the reasons for which, some time       ago, young Pushkin was sent with a letter from Count Capo d’Istria to       General Inzoff. I found him already here when I arrived, the General       having placed him at my disposal, though he himself was at Kishineff. I       have no reason to complain about him. On the contrary, he is much steadier       than formerly. But a desire for the welfare of the young man himself, who       is not wanting in ability, and whose faults proceed more from the head       than from the heart, impels me to urge upon you his removal from Odessa.       Pushkin’s chief failing is ambition. He spent the bathing season here, and       has gathered round him a crowd of adulators who praise his genius. This       maintains in him a baneful delusion which seems to turn his head—namely,       that he is a “distinguished writer;” whereas, in reality he is but a       feeble imitator of an author in whose favour very little can be said       (Byron). This it is which keeps him from a serious study of the great       classical poets, which might exercise a beneficial effect upon his talents—which       cannot be denied him—and which might make of him in course of time a       “distinguished writer.”            The best thing that can be done for him is to remove him hence....            The Emperor Nicholas on his accession pardoned Pushkin and received him       once more into favour. During an interview which took place it is said       that the Tsar promised the poet that he alone would in future be the       censor of his productions. Pushkin was restored to his position in the       Foreign Office and received the appointment of Court Historian. In 1828 he       published one of his finest poems, _Poltava_, which is founded on       incidents familiar to English readers in Byron’s _Mazeppa_. In 1829       the hardy poet accompanied the Russian army which under Paskevitch       captured Erzeroum. In 1831 he married a beautiful lady of the Gontchareff       family and settled in the neighbourhood of St. Petersburg, where he       remained for the remainder of his life, only occasionally visiting Moscow       and Mikhailovskoe. During this period his chief occupation consisted in       collecting and investigating materials for a projected history of Peter       the Great, which was undertaken at the express desire of the Emperor. He       likewise completed a history of the revolt of Pougatchoff, which occurred       in the reign of Catherine II. [Note: this individual having personated       Peter III, the deceased husband of the Empress, raised the Orenburg       Cossacks in revolt. This revolt was not suppressed without extensive       destruction of life and property.] In 1833 the poet visited Orenburg, the       scene of the dreadful excesses he recorded; the fruit of his journey being       one of the most charming tales ever written, _The Captain’s Daughter_.       [Note: Translated in _Russian Romance_, by Mrs. Telfer, 1875.]            The remaining years of Pushkin’s life, spent in the midst of domestic       bliss and grateful literary occupation, were what lookers-on style “years       of unclouded happiness.” They were, however, drawing rapidly to a close.       Unrivalled distinction rarely fails to arouse bitter animosity amongst the       envious, and Pushkin’s existence had latterly been embittered by       groundless insinuations against his wife’s reputation in the shape of       anonymous letters addressed to himself and couched in very insulting       language. He fancied he had traced them to one Georges d’Anthés, a       Frenchman in the Cavalier Guard, who had been adopted by the Dutch envoy       Heeckeren. D’Anthés, though he had espoused Madame Pushkin’s sister, had       conducted himself with impropriety towards the former lady. The poet       displayed in this affair a fierce hostility quite characteristic of his       African origin but which drove him to his destruction. D’Anthés, it was       subsequently admitted, was not the author of the anonymous letters; but as       usual when a duel is proposed, an appeal to reason was thought to smack of       cowardice. The encounter took place in February 1837 on one of the islands       of the Neva. The weapons used were pistols, and the combat was of a       determined, nay ferocious character. Pushkin was shot before he had time       to fire, and, in his fall, the barrel of his pistol became clogged with       snow which lay deep upon the ground at the time. Raising himself on his       elbow, the wounded man called for another pistol, crying, “I’ve strength       left to fire my shot!” He fired, and slightly wounded his opponent,       shouting “Bravo!” when he heard him exclaim that he was hit. D’Anthés was,       however, but slightly contused whilst Pushkin was shot through the       abdomen. He was transported to his residence and expired after several       days passed in extreme agony. Thus perished in the thirty-eighth year of       his age this distinguished poet, in a manner and amid surroundings which       make the duel scene in the sixth canto of this poem seem almost prophetic.       His reflections on the premature death of Lenski appear indeed strangely       applicable to his own fate, as generally to the premature extinction of       genius.            Pushkin was endowed with a powerful physical organisation. He was fond of       long walks, unlike the generality of his countrymen, and at one time of       his career used daily to foot it into St. Petersburg and back, from his       residence in the suburbs, to conduct his investigations in the Government       archives when employed on the History of Peter the Great. He was a good       swordsman, rode well, and at one time aspired to enter the cavalry; but       his father not being able to furnish the necessary funds he declined       serving in the less romantic infantry. Latterly he was regular in his       habits; rose early, retired late, and managed to get along with but very       little sleep. On rising he betook himself forthwith to his literary       occupations, which were continued till afternoon, when they gave place to       physical exercise. Strange as it will appear to many, he preferred the       autumn months, especially when rainy, chill and misty, for the production       of his literary compositions, and was proportionally depressed by the       approach of spring. (Cf. Canto VII st. ii.)            “Mournful is thine approach to me,      O Spring, thou chosen time of love,” etc.        He usually left St. Petersburg about the middle of September and remained       in the country till December. In this space of time it was his custom to       develop and perfect the inspirations of the remaining portion of the year.       He was of an impetuous yet affectionate nature and much beloved by a       numerous circle of friends. An attractive feature in his character was his       unalterable attachment to his aged nurse, a sentiment which we find       reflected in the pages of _Eugene Onéguine_ and elsewhere.            The preponderating influence which Byron exercised in the formation of his       genius has already been noticed. It is indeed probable that we owe _Onéguine_       to the combined impressions of _Childe Harold_ and _Don Juan_       upon his mind. Yet the Russian poem excels these masterpieces of Byron in       a single particular—namely, in completeness of narrative, the plots       of the latter being mere vehicles for the development of the poet’s       general reflections. There is ground for believing that Pushkin likewise       made this poem the record of his own experience. This has doubtless been       the practice of many distinguished authors of fiction whose names will       readily occur to the reader. Indeed, as we are never cognizant of the real       motives which actuate others, it follows that nowhere can the secret       springs of human action be studied to such advantage as within our own       breasts. Thus romance is sometimes but the reflection of the writer’s own       individuality, and he adopts the counsel of the American poet:            Look then into thine heart and write!        But a further consideration of this subject would here be out of place.       Perhaps I cannot more suitably conclude this sketch than by quoting"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23997"],["title","Eugene Oneguine [Onegin] (#2)"],["body","       his _Ode to the Sea_ the poet’s tribute of admiration to the genius       of Napoleon and Byron, who of all contemporaries seem the most to have       swayed his imagination.       Farewell, thou pathway of the free,      For the last time thy waves I view      Before me roll disdainfully,      Brilliantly beautiful and blue.       Why vain regret? Wherever now      My heedless course I may pursue      One object on thy desert brow      I everlastingly shall view—       A rock, the sepulchre of Fame!      The poor remains of greatness gone      A cold remembrance there became,      There perished great Napoleon.       In torment dire to sleep he lay;      Then, as a tempest echoing rolls,      Another genius whirled away,      Another sovereign of our souls.       He perished. Freedom wept her child,      He left the world his garland bright.      Wail, Ocean, surge in tumult wild,      To sing of thee was his delight.       Impressed upon him was thy mark,      His genius moulded was by thee;      Like thee, he was unfathomed, dark      And untamed in his majesty.        Note: It may interest some to know that Georges d’Anthés was tried by       court-martial for his participation in the duel in which Pushkin fell,       found guilty, and reduced to the ranks; but, not being a Russian subject,       he was conducted by a gendarme across the frontier and then set at       liberty.           EUGENE ONÉGUINE         Pétri de vanité, il avait encore plus de cette espèce d’orgueil, qui fait       avouer avec la même indifference les bonnes comme les mauvaises actions,       suite d’un sentiment de supériorité, peut-être imaginaire.— _Tiré       d’une lettre particulière_.            [Note: Written in 1823 at Kishineff and Odessa.]         CANTO THE FIRST        ‘The Spleen’       ‘He rushes at life and exhausts the passions.’                                 Prince Viazemski     Canto the First     I     “My uncle’s goodness is extreme,    If seriously he hath disease;    He hath acquired the world’s esteem    And nothing more important sees;    A paragon of virtue he!    But what a nuisance it will be,    Chained to his bedside night and day    Without a chance to slip away.    Ye need dissimulation base    A dying man with art to soothe,    Beneath his head the pillow smooth,    And physic bring with mournful face,    To sigh and meditate alone:    When will the devil take his own!”     II     Thus mused a madcap young, who drove    Through clouds of dust at postal pace,    By the decree of Mighty Jove,    Inheritor of all his race.    Friends of Liudmila and Ruslan,(1)    Let me present ye to the man,    Who without more prevarication    The hero is of my narration!    Onéguine, O my gentle readers,    Was born beside the Neva, where    It may be ye were born, or there    Have shone as one of fashion’s leaders.    I also wandered there of old,    But cannot stand the northern cold.(2)     [Note 1: _Ruslan and Liudmila_, the title of Pushkin’s first    important work, written 1817-20. It is a tale relating the adventures    of the knight-errant Ruslan in search of his fair lady Liudmila, who    has been carried off by a _kaldoon_, or magician.]     [Note 2: Written in Bessarabia.]     III     Having performed his service truly,    Deep into debt his father ran;    Three balls a year he gave ye duly,    At last became a ruined man.    But Eugene was by fate preserved,    For first “madame” his wants observed,    And then “monsieur” supplied her place;(3)    The boy was wild but full of grace.    “Monsieur l’Abbé” a starving Gaul,    Fearing his pupil to annoy,    Instructed jestingly the boy,    Morality taught scarce at all;    Gently for pranks he would reprove    And in the Summer Garden rove.     [Note 3: In Russia foreign tutors and governesses are commonly    styled “monsieur” or “madame.”]     IV     When youth’s rebellious hour drew near    And my Eugene the path must trace—    The path of hope and tender fear—    Monsieur clean out of doors they chase.    Lo! my Onéguine free as air,    Cropped in the latest style his hair,    Dressed like a London dandy he    The giddy world at last shall see.    He wrote and spoke, so all allowed,    In the French language perfectly,    Danced the mazurka gracefully,    Without the least constraint he bowed.    What more’s required? The world replies,    He is a charming youth and wise.     V     We all of us of education    A something somehow have obtained,    Thus, praised be God! a reputation    With us is easily attained.    Onéguine was—so many deemed    [Unerring critics self-esteemed],    Pedantic although scholar like,    In truth he had the happy trick    Without constraint in conversation    Of touching lightly every theme.    Silent, oracular ye’d see him    Amid a serious disputation,    Then suddenly discharge a joke    The ladies’ laughter to provoke.     VI     Latin is just now not in vogue,    But if the truth I must relate,    Onéguine knew enough, the rogue    A mild quotation to translate,    A little Juvenal to spout,    With “vale” finish off a note;    Two verses he could recollect    Of the Æneid, but incorrect.    In history he took no pleasure,    The dusty chronicles of earth    For him were but of little worth,    Yet still of anecdotes a treasure    Within his memory there lay,    From Romulus unto our day.     VII     For empty sound the rascal swore he    Existence would not make a curse,    Knew not an iamb from a choree,    Although we read him heaps of verse.    Homer, Theocritus, he jeered,    But Adam Smith to read appeared,    And at economy was great;    That is, he could elucidate    How empires store of wealth unfold,    How flourish, why and wherefore less    If the raw product they possess    The medium is required of gold.    The father scarcely understands    His son and mortgages his lands.     VIII     But upon all that Eugene knew    I have no leisure here to dwell,    But say he was a genius who    In one thing really did excel.    It occupied him from a boy,    A labour, torment, yet a joy,    It whiled his idle hours away    And wholly occupied his day—    The amatory science warm,    Which Ovid once immortalized,    For which the poet agonized    Laid down his life of sun and storm    On the steppes of Moldavia lone,    Far from his Italy—his own.(4)     [Note 4: Referring to Tomi, the reputed place of exile of Ovid.    Pushkin, then residing in Bessarabia, was in the same predicament    as his predecessor in song, though he certainly did not plead    guilty to the fact, since he remarks in his ode to Ovid:                           To exile _self-consigned_,       With self, society, existence, discontent,       I visit in these days, with melancholy mind,       The country whereunto a mournful age thee sent.     Ovid thus enumerates the causes which brought about his banishment:        “Perdiderint quum me _duo_ crimina, carmen et error,       Alterius facti culpa silenda mihi est.”                         _Ovidii Nasonis Tristium_, lib. ii. 207.]     IX     How soon he learnt deception’s art,    Hope to conceal and jealousy,    False confidence or doubt to impart,    Sombre or glad in turn to be,    Haughty appear, subservient,    Obsequious or indifferent!    What languor would his silence show,    How full of fire his speech would glow!    How artless was the note which spoke    Of love again, and yet again;    How deftly could he transport feign!    How bright and tender was his look,    Modest yet daring! And a tear    Would at the proper time appear.     X     How well he played the greenhorn’s part    To cheat the inexperienced fair,    Sometimes by pleasing flattery’s art,    Sometimes by ready-made despair;    The feeble moment would espy    Of tender years the modesty    Conquer by passion and address,    Await the long-delayed caress.    Avowal then ’twas time to pray,    Attentive to the heart’s first beating,    Follow up love—a secret meeting    Arrange without the least delay—    Then, then—well, in some solitude    Lessons to give he understood!     XI     How soon he learnt to titillate    The heart of the inveterate flirt!    Desirous to annihilate    His own antagonists expert,    How bitterly he would malign,    With many a snare their pathway line!    But ye, O happy husbands, ye    With him were friends eternally:    The crafty spouse caressed him, who    By Faublas in his youth was schooled,(5)    And the suspicious veteran old,    The pompous, swaggering cuckold too,    Who floats contentedly through life,    Proud of his dinners and his wife!     [Note 5: _Les Aventures du Chevalier de Faublas_, a romance of a    loose character by Jean Baptiste Louvet de Couvray, b. 1760,    d. 1797, famous for his bold oration denouncing Robespierre,    Marat and Danton.]     XII     One morn whilst yet in bed he lay,    His valet brings him letters three.    What, invitations? The same day    As many entertainments be!    A ball here, there a children’s treat,    Whither shall my rapscallion flit?    Whither shall he go first? He’ll see,    Perchance he will to all the three.    Meantime in matutinal dress    And hat surnamed a “Bolivar”(6)    He hies unto the “Boulevard,”    To loiter there in idleness    Until the sleepless Bréguet chime(7)    Announcing to him dinner-time.
