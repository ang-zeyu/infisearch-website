But Larry again came to the rescue by saying--  \"Why, Maryann, my dear, ye've bin an' mistook a good deal of what you've heard, intirely.  This Flora Westwood is no cannibal, but wan o' the purtiest bit craturs I iver had the good luck to set eyes on; as white as a lily, wid cheeks like the rose, not to spake of a smile an' a timper of an angel.  She's a parson's daughter, too, an' lives on a coral island in the Pacific Ocean, where the people is cannibals, no doubt, as I've good raison to know, for they ait up a lot o' me shipmates, and it was by good luck they didn't ait up myself and Master Will too--though I do belaive they'd have found me so tough that I'd have blunted their teeth an' soured on their stummicks, bad luck to them.  But it's surprised that I am to hear about this.  Ah, then, Master Will, but ye're a sly dog--more cunnin' than I took ye for.  Ye threw dust in the eyes of Larry O'Hale, anyhow.\"  Poor Maryann appeared much relieved by this explanation, although she felt it to be consistent with her dignity that she should throw considerable doubt on Larry's statement, cross-question him pretty severely, and allow herself to be convinced only after the accumulation of an amount of evidence that could not be resisted.  \"Well, now, that accounts for the way in which his mother received the news,\" said Maryann.  \"It is a strange story,\" remarked Jemima.  \"Uncommon,\" observed Richards.  Bunco said nothing, but he grinned from ear to ear.  At that moment, as if it were aware of the climax at which the party had arrived, the baby, without a single note of warning, set up a hideous howl, in the midst of which the bell rang, and Maryann rose to answer it.  \"Master Will wants to speak to you, Mr Hale, and to Mr Bunco, too,\" she said on returning.  \"Come along, _Mister_ Bunco,\" said Larry, \"that'll be the order to trip our anchors.\"  \"My friends,\" said Will Osten, when the two were seated on the corners of their respective chairs in the drawing-room, \"I sent for you to say that circumstances have occurred which render it necessary that I should visit California.  Do you feel inclined to join me in this trip, or do you prefer to remain in England?\"  \"I'm yer man,\" said Larry.  \"So's me,\" added Bunco.  \"I thought so,\" said Will, smiling; \"we have been comrades together too long to part yet.  But I must start without delay, and mean to go by the plains and across the Rocky Mountains.  Are you ready to set off on short notice?\"  \"In half an hour av ye plaze, sur,\" said Larry.  Bunco grinned and nodded his head.  \"The end of the week will do,\" said Will, laughing; \"so be off and make your preparations for a long and rough trip.\"  In pursuance of this plan, Will Osten and his two staunch followers, soon after the date of the above conversation, crossed the Atlantic, traversed the great Lakes of Canada to the centre of North America, purchased, at the town of Saint Pauls, horses, guns, provisions, powder, shot, etcetera, for a long journey, and found themselves, one beautiful summer evening, galloping gaily over those wide prairies that roll beyond the last of the backwood settlements, away into the wild recesses of the Western Wilderness.    CHAPTER TWO.  DESCRIBES A BURST OVER THE WESTERN PRAIRIE, AND INTRODUCES A NEW CHARACTER, ALSO A HUNT, AND A GREAT FEAST.  Wandering Will and his companions laid the reins on the necks of their half-tamed horses and galloped wildly away over the western prairie. Perhaps it was the feeling of absolute freedom from human restraints that excited them to the galloping and shouting condition of maniacs; perhaps it was the idea of sweeping over unbounded space in these interminable plains, or the influence of the fresh air around, the sunny blue sky overhead, and the flower-speckled sward underfoot--perhaps it was all these put together, but, whatever the cause, our three travellers commenced their journey at a pace that would have rendered them incapable of further progress in a few hours had they kept it up. Their state of mind was aptly expressed, at the end of one of these wild flights, by Larry, who exclaimed, as he reined in--  \"Ah, then, it's flyin' I'll be in a minit.  Sure av I only had a pair o' wings no bigger than a sparrow's, I cud do it aisy.\"  \"Yoo's a goose, Larry,\" observed Bunco.  \"Faix if I was it's mesilf as would fly away an' lave you to waller on the dirty earth ye belongs to,\" retorted the other.  \"Dirty earth!\" echoed Will Osten, gazing round on the plains of bright green grass that waved in the soft air with something like the gentle heavings of the sea.  \"Come, let's have another!\"  They stretched out again at full gallop and swept away like the wind itself.  \"Hooroo!\" shouted Larry O'Hale, wildly throwing out both arms and rising in his stirrups; \"look here, Bunco, I'm goin' to fly, boy!\"  Larry didn't mean to do so, but he _did_ fly!  His horse put its foot in a badger-hole at that moment and fell.  The rider, flying over its head, alighted on his back, and remained in that position quite motionless, while his alarmed comrades reined up hastily and dismounted.  \"Not hurt, I hope,\" said Will, anxiously.  \"Och! ha! gintly, doctor, take me up tinderly,\" gasped the poor man as they raised him to the perpendicular position, in which he stood for nearly a minute making very wry faces and slowly moving his shoulders and limbs to ascertain whether any bones were fractured.  \"I do belave I'm all right,\" he said at length with a sigh of relief; \"have a care, Bunco, kape yer paws off, but take a squint at the nape o' me neck an' see if me back-bone is stickin' up through me shirt-collar.\"  \"Me no can see him,\" said the sympathetic Bunco.  \"That's a blissin' anyhow.  I only wish ye cud _feel_ him, Bunco. Doctor, dear, did ye iver see stars in the day-time?\"  \"No, never.\"  \"Then ye'd better make a scientific note of it in yer book, for I see 'em at this good minit dancin' about like will-o'-the-wisps in a bog of Ould Ireland.  There, help me on to the back o' the baste--bad luck to the badgers, say I.\"  Thus muttering to himself and his comrades, half exasperated by the stunning effects of his fall, yet rather thankful to find that no real damage was done, Larry remounted, and all three continued their journey with not much less enjoyment, but with abated energy.  Thus much for the beginning.  Availing ourselves of an author's privilege to annihilate time and space at pleasure, we change the scene. The three travellers are still riding over the same prairie, but at the distance of a hundred miles or so from the spot where the accident above described took place.  It was evening.  The sun was gradually sinking in the west--far beyond that \"far west\" to which they had penetrated.  The wanderers looked travel-stained, and appeared somewhat fatigued, while their horses advanced with slow steps and drooping heads.  Two pack-horses, which had been procured by them with an additional supply of necessaries at a solitary fort belonging to the fur-traders of that region, were driven by Larry, whose voice and action seemed to indicate that he and they were actuated by different sentiments and desires.  \"Of all the lazy bastes,\" he exclaimed, giving one of the horses a tremendous cut over the flank that startled it into temporary life, \"I iver did see--but, och! what's the use--there's niver a dhrop o' wather in this wilderness.  We may as well lie down an' die at wance.\"  \"Hush, Larry,\" said Will Osten, \"don't talk lightly of dying.\"  \"Lightly is it?  Well, now, there's nothin' light about me from the sole o' me fut to the top o' the tallest hair on me head, an' the heaviest part about me is the heart, which feels like lead intirely.  But cheer up, Larry, yer owld grandmother always said ye was born to be hanged, so of coorse ye can't be starved--that's a comfort, anyhow!\"  \"What think you, Bunco,\" said Will Osten, turning to his dark-skinned companion, \"shall we encamp on this arid part of the plain and go waterless as well as supperless to rest, or shall we push on?  I fear the horses will break down if we try to force them much further.\"  \"Water not be far-off,\" said Bunco curtly.  \"Very well, we shall hold on.\"  In silence they continued to advance until the sun was descending towards the horizon, when there suddenly appeared, on the brow of an eminence, the figure of a solitary horseman.  Sharply defined as he was against the bright sky, this horseman appeared to be of supernaturally huge proportions--insomuch that the three travellers pulled up by tacit consent, and glanced inquiringly at each other.  \"It's a ghost _at last_!\" muttered the superstitious Irishman, whose expression of countenance showed that he was not by any means in a jesting humour.  \"Ghost or not, we must be prepared to meet him,\" said Will, loosening a large hunting-knife in its sheath and examining the priming of his rifle.  The strange horseman had evidently observed the party, for he presently descended the rising ground and rode slowly towards them.  In doing so he passed out of the strong light, and consequently assumed more ordinary proportions, but still when he drew near, it was evident that he was a man of immense size.  He rode a black steed of the largest and most powerful description; was clad in the leathern hunting-shirt, belt, leggings, moccasins, etcetera, peculiar to the western hunter, and carried a short rifle in the hollow of his right arm.  \"Good-evening, strangers,\" he said, in a tone that savoured of the Yankee, but with an easy manner and good-humoured gravity that seemed to indicate English extraction.  \"Goin' far?\"  \"To California,\" said Will, smiling at the abrupt commencement of the conversation.  \"H'm, a longish bit.  Come far?\"  \"From England.\"  \"H'm, a longish bit, too.  Lost and starvin', I see.\"  \"Not exactly, but pretty nearly so,\" said Will.  \"I had entertained the belief,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24088"],["title","Lincoln's Last Hours (#1)"],["body","posture it was evident that Mrs. Lincoln had instantly sprung to his aid after he had been wounded and had kept him from tumbling to the floor. By Mrs. Lincoln's courage, strength and energy the President was maintained in this upright position during all the time that elapsed while Major Rathbone had bravely fought the assassin and removed the obstruction from the door of the box.  I placed my finger on the President's right radial pulse but could perceive no movement of the artery. For the purpose of reviving him, if possible, we removed him from his chair to a recumbent position on the floor of the box, and as I held his head and shoulders while doing this, my hand came in contact with a clot of blood near his left shoulder. Remembering the flashing dagger in the hand of the assassin, and the severely bleeding wound of Major Rathbone, I supposed the President had been stabbed, and while kneeling on the floor over his head, with my eyes continuously watching the President's face, I asked a gentleman to cut the coat and shirt open from the neck to the elbow to enable me, if possible, to check the hemorrhage that I thought might take place from the subclavian artery or some other blood vessel. This was done with a dirk knife, but no wound was found there. I lifted his eyelids and saw evidence of a brain injury. I quickly passed the separated fingers of both hands through his blood matted hair to examine his head, and I discovered his mortal wound. The President had been shot in the back part of the head, behind the left ear. I easily removed the obstructing clot of blood from the wound, and this relieved the pressure on the brain.  The assassin of President Lincoln had evidently carefully planned to shoot to produce instant death, as the wound he made was situated within two inches of the physiological point of selection, when instant death is desired. A Derringer pistol had been used, which had sent a large round ball on its awful mission through one of the thickest, hardest parts of the skull and into the brain. The history of surgery fails to record a recovery from such a fearful wound and I have never seen or heard of any other person with such a wound, and injury to the sinus of the brain and to the brain itself, who lived even for an hour.  As the President did not then revive, I thought of the other mode of death, apnoea, and assumed my preferred position to revive by artificial respiration. I knelt on the floor over the President, with a knee on each side of his pelvis and facing him. I leaned forward, opened his mouth and introduced two extended fingers of my right hand as far back as possible, and by pressing the base of his paralyzed tongue downward and outward, opened his larynx and made a free passage for air to enter the lungs. I placed an assistant at each of his arms to manipulate them in order to expand his thorax, then slowly to press the arms down by the side of the body, while I pressed the diaphragm upward: methods which caused air to be drawn in and forced out of his lungs.  During the intermissions I also with the strong thumb and fingers of my right hand by intermittent sliding pressure under and beneath the ribs, stimulated the apex of the heart, and resorted to several other physiological methods. We repeated these motions a number of times before signs of recovery from the profound shock were attained; then a feeble action of the heart and irregular breathing followed.  The effects of the shock were still manifest by such great prostration, that I was fearful of any extra agitation of the President's body, and became convinced that something more must be done to retain life. I leaned forcibly forward directly over his body, thorax to thorax, face to face, and several times drew in a long breath, then forcibly breathed directly into his mouth and nostrils, which expanded his lungs and improved his respirations. After waiting a moment I placed my ear over his thorax and found the action of the heart improving. I arose to the erect kneeling posture, then watched for a short time, and saw that the President could continue independent breathing and that instant death would not occur.  I then pronounced my diagnosis and prognosis: \"His wound is mortal; it is impossible for him to recover.\" This message was telegraphed all over the country.  When the brandy and water arrived, I very slowly poured a small quantity into the President's mouth, this was swallowed and retained.  Many looked on during these earnest efforts to revive the President, but not once did any one suggest a word or in any way interfere with my actions. Mrs. Lincoln had thrown the burden on me and sat nearby looking on.  In the dimly lighted box of the theatre, so beautifully decorated with American flags, a scene of historic importance was being enacted. On the carpeted floor lay prostrate the President of the United States. His long, outstretched, athletic body of six feet four inches appeared unusually heroic. His bleeding head rested on my white linen handkerchief. His clothing was arranged as nicely as possible. He was irregularly breathing, his heart was feebly beating, his face was pale and in solemn repose, his eyelids were closed, his countenance made him appear to be in prayerful communion with the Universal God he always loved. I looked down upon him and waited for the next inspiration, which soon came: \"Remove to safety.\" From the time Mrs. Lincoln had placed the President in my charge, I had not permitted my attention to be diverted. Again I was asked the nature of his wound and replied in these exact words: \"His wound is mortal; it is impossible for him to recover.\"  While I was kneeling over the President on the floor Dr. Charles S. Taft and Dr. Albert F. A. King had come and offered to render any assistance. I expressed the desire to have the President taken, as soon as he had gained sufficient strength, to the nearest house on the opposite side of the street. I was asked by several if he could not be taken to the White House, but I responded that if that were attempted the President would die long before we reached there. While we were waiting for Mr. Lincoln to gain strength Laura Keene, who had been taking part in the play, appealed to me to allow her to hold the President's head. I granted this request and she sat on the floor of the box and held his head on her lap.  We decided that the President could now be moved from the possibility of danger in the theatre to a house where we might place him on a bed in safety. To assist in this duty I assigned Dr. Taft to carry his right shoulder, Dr. King to carry his left shoulder and detailed a sufficient number of others, whose names I have never discovered, to assist in carrying the body, while I carried his head, going first. We reached the door of the box and saw the long passage leading to the exit crowded with people. I called out twice: \"Guards, clear the passage! Guards, clear the passage!\" A free space was quickly cleared by an officer and protected by a line of soldiers in the position of present arms with swords, pistols and bayonets. When we reached the stairs, I turned so that those holding the President's feet would descend first. At the door of the theatre, I was again asked if the President could be taken to the White House. I answered: \"No, the President would die on the way.\"  The crowd in the street completely obstructed the doorway and a captain, whose services proved invaluable all through the night, came to me, saying: \"Surgeon, give me your commands and I will see that they are obeyed.\" I asked him to clear a passage to the nearest house opposite. He had on side arms and drew his sword. With the sword and word of command he cleared the way. We slowly crossed the street. It was necessary to stop several times to give me the opportunity to remove the clot of blood from the opening to the wound. A barrier of men had been formed to keep back the crowds on each side of an open space leading to the house. Those who went ahead reported that the house directly opposite the theatre was closed. I saw a man standing at the door of Mr. Petersen's house, diagonally opposite, holding a lighted candle in his hand and beckoning us to enter. This we did, not having been interrupted in the slightest by the throngs in the street, but a number of the excited populace followed us into the house.  The great difficulty of retaining life during this brief time occupied in moving the President from the theatre to Mr. Petersen's house, conclusively proved that the President would have died in the street if I had granted the request to take him such a long distance as to the White House. I asked for the best room and we soon had the President placed in bed. He was lifted to the longitudinal center of the bed and placed on his back. While holding his face upward and keeping his head from rolling to either side, I looked at his elevated knees caused by his great height. This uncomfortable position grieved me and I ordered the foot of the bed to be removed. Dr. Taft and Dr. King reported that it was a fixture. Then I requested that it be broken off; as I found this could not satisfactorily be done, I had the President placed diagonally on the bed and called for extra pillows, and with them formed a gentle inclined plane on which to rest his head and shoulders. His position was then one of repose.  The room soon filled with anxious people. I called the officer and asked him to open a window and order all except the medical gentlemen and friends to leave the room. After we had given the President a short rest I decided to make a thorough physical examination, as I wished to see if he had been wounded in any other part of the body. I requested all except the surgeons to leave the room. The Captain reported that my order had been carried out with the exception of Mrs. Lincoln, to whom he said he did not like to speak. I addressed Mrs. Lincoln, explaining my desire,"]]]
