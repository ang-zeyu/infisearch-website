Away at the southern end of the lake were other lights, indicating the location of the little settlement of cottagers. Lake Placid was a popular resort at this season of the year.  Joe, the man of all work, came down to the shore and took care of the boat.  \"Take care of the fish, Joe,\" called Hatch, as he hastened after Merry, who was striding toward the cottage.  The shades were drawn and the place seemed silent enough until Frank opened the door and stepped inside. Then he was surprised and startled to find himself seized by four pairs of hands, which hustled him about amid bursts of laughter and shouts of welcome.  \"Hold on! hold on!\" he gasped, in the greatest astonishment, for he recognized his four assailants as his friends, Bart Hodge, Bruce Browning, Inza Burrage, and Elsie Bellwood. \"Where in the world did you all drop from?\"  \"We have run you down at last,\" said Hodge; \"but you gave us a merry old chase.\"  \"It's been the greatest game of hide and seek I ever played,\" grunted Browning, ceasing from his attack on Frank and dropping lazily on a chair, which creaked beneath his weight. \"Just when we would think we were going to put our hands on you sure you would disappear like a wizard.\"  \"Aren't you glad to see us?\" demanded Inza.  \"If you're not, we'll go right away,\" said Elsie.  \"Glad!\" cried Frank. \"I'm speechless with delight. But I don't understand it yet.\"  Then they explained how they had followed him to Boston and from that city to New York, and how in the latter place, after no end of trouble and detective work, they learned that he was off for Lake Placid, in the Adirondacks. Arriving at Newman late that afternoon, they had driven over to the cottage of Mr. Hatch, which they reached while Frank and his host were still out fishing.  \"Here is Mrs. Medford, Frank,\" said Inza, calling his attention to a smiling, middle-aged lady who sat near the open fireplace.  Mrs. Medford was a relative of Inza's who often accompanied her as companion and chaperon.  \"Mrs. Medford,\" said Merry, hastening to clasp the smiling woman's hand, \"I am delighted to see you again. I'm quite overcome with surprise and pleasure. It's evident I am, for I have forgotten Mr. Hatch.\"  No wonder Mr. Hatch had been overlooked, for he had stepped back and remained quiet during all the chatter and laughter of the meeting between Frank and his friends.  \"I am greatly pleased to meet your friends, Mr. Merriwell,\" he declared, as Frank introduced one after another. \"If the accommodations at my poor cottage----\"  \"Oh, we wouldn't think of putting you to the slightest inconvenience!\" declared Inza. \"We can find accommodations in Newman, Mr. Hatch, and we wouldn't think of----\"  \"Unless it is too uncomfortable here,\" Hatch hastened to say, \"I shall consider it a favor to entertain you as the friends of the cleverest fisherman and finest young man it has been my good fortune to meet in twenty years. Anything and everything here is yours as long as you choose to remain, and you can't remain too long for me.\"  That was quite enough, for they saw he was in earnest. He could thaw out and be genial and pleasant when he chose, and this was an occasion when he had no difficulty in thawing. He called Joe and gave orders about supper, and soon the delightful odor of cooking fish came faintly to their nostrils.  While supper was being prepared Frank related the story of the many adventures which had befallen him since he hastily left Maine in pursuit of the Mexican who had stolen one of his valuable papers.  As she listened Inza flushed and paled by turns. She was elated by his success, and she found it difficult to check a tremor as she realized how many times he had been in deadly danger.  \"Where is O'Toole?\" cried Hodge, as Frank finished. \"I want to congratulate him on his job in ending the career of that snake, Del Norte.\"  O'Toole was aiding Joe in the cook house, and he was finally induced, under protest, to appear in the cottage. He stood before Frank's friends, grinning bashfully and bowing awkwardly.  \"O'Toole,\" said Bart, shaking the Irishman's hand, \"you never did a better bit of work in all your life than when you shot Porfias del Norte.\"  \"It's not so sure Oi am av that,\" declared the man. \"It's nivver a bit will Oi shlape till Oi know fer sure th' baste is dead an' burried six fate under ground.\"  \"Why, Frank said you shot him through the head.\"  \"Oi did thot, but whin we returned to th' hut pwhere he was it's up an' gone he had.\"  \"Frank says the body was carried off by his friends.\"  \"Mebbe it wur, Oi dunno; but whoy th' ould scratch they wur afther takin' all thot throuble an' risk is pwhat bates me. Somehow Oi'm thinkin' th' mon up an' walked away all by hissilf, an' it's cowld chills Oi git from thinkin' he may be lookin' fer me to sittle our account.\"  \"You'll get over that feeling after a while,\" said Hodge. \"Frank knows when a man is dead, and you heard him pronounce Del Norte dead.\"  In Browning's ear Frank whispered:  \"I confess I'd feel better satisfied if I had seen him buried; but I don't intend to tell O'Toole that.\"  In due time supper was cooked and served in the plain but comfortable dining room. The death of Del Norte was forgotten, and it was a jolly crowd that gathered about the large table.  \"Hold me!\" cried Browning, as he drank in the odor of baked potatoes, cooked fish and steaming coffee. \"If you don't look out I'll wade in here and create a famine. I feel as if I might eat everything on this table without half trying.\"  \"There is plenty of everything,\" said Warren Hatch. \"Joe tells me there is more fish. Here he comes with some of his hot biscuits right out of the oven.\"  Joe appeared with a heaping plate of biscuits, and soon all were enjoying the meal.  Inza was unusually vivacious, her cheeks being flushed and her dark eyes sparkling. The pleasure of being with Frank again was enough to put her at her best, and indeed she was a most beautiful girl.  Elsie was quieter, but there was no mistaking the expression of deep satisfaction which hovered on her sweet face. The fact that Inza was happy was enough to give her pleasure.  In the midst of the meal there came a rapping at the door. Mr. Hatch answered the summons and was gone some time. When he returned he explained that there was to be a masquerade dance at a pavilion used for dances and picnics down at the cottage village, and, having learned of the presence of guests at his cottage, invitations had been extended to them all.  \"Perfectly jolly!\" cried Inza. \"But we have no costumes.\"  \"Never mind that,\" said Mr. Hatch. \"Without doubt there will be others in the same predicament. You can easily manufacture some masks, and, being strangers here, no one outside your own party will recognize you. I'm sorry I can't assist you in the matter of dress, but I can help the male members of the party. I have a full Indian rig and a cowboy outfit, which will do for two. The third can dress in old clothes, like a hunter or guide. The whole thing can be arranged somehow if you care to go. Where there's a will there's a way, you know.\"  \"Oh, say,\" grunted Browning, \"count me out. I'm no dancer. Besides that, I'm tired.\"  \"The same old complaint,\" laughed Frank. \"What do you think about it, Elsie?\"  \"If Inza wishes to go, I'm ready,\" answered Elsie. \"We might have a good time.\"  Hodge expressed a willingness to go along, and then Frank cried:  \"It's a go, my children! Let's enter into this thing in earnest and have a high old time. Bruce, you ought to be ashamed of your laziness.\"  \"Don't begin that old song!\" said the big fellow. \"There's not enough laziness in this world. Everybody howls about strenuousness and hustle, and people wear themselves out and die before they should. I'm setting a good example, and I'll continue to set.\"  \"Or sit,\" nodded Merry. \"All right, Lazybones, stay here by your lonesome and content yourself thinking what a fine time we're having.\"  \"Thanks,\" grunted Bruce.     CHAPTER IV.  TWO GHOSTS.   The colony on the south shore of Lake Placid was about to break up. Cold weather was setting in. Already many of those who had spent much of the summer there were gone. Others were going. Soon that region would be left entirely to the hunters and the fishermen.  Before returning to the city the cottagers had planned a last grand time in the form of a masquerade dance. They did not call it a \"ball.\" There was to be nothing formal about it.  Thus it happened that the party at Warren Hatch's cottage received an invitation.  Mrs. Medford was tired; she would not attend the dance; but she offered to assist the girls in getting up their costumes.  \"Costumes!\" cried Inza. \"Where will we find them? We'll have to go without special preparation in that line. Frank and Bart are the lucky ones.\"  \"Come with me,\" smiled Mrs. Medford, after consulting in a low tone with Mr. Hatch, who smiled and nodded. \"Perhaps we can find something.\"  The girls followed her to the upper part of the cottage, leaving Frank and Bart to make up below.  Merry gave Bart his choice of the two rigs, and Hodge took the Indian outfit, leaving the cowboy costume for Frank.  At intervals the sound of laughter came from above, indicating that the girls were making progress.  Mrs. Medford came down first and announced that the girls would follow in two or three minutes.  \"They are putting on the finishing touches,\" she said.  She professed to be alarmed by the fierce appearance of Merriwell, who swaggered toward her in \"chaps,\" woolen shirt, and wide-brimmed hat, a loose belt about his waist, with a pistol peeping from the holster, while his face was hidden by a mask in keeping with the rest of his outfit.  \"It's a whole lot tired we're getting of waiting for them yere gals, madam,\" said Frank. \"I opine they'd better hurry some, for we'll have to hike right lively if we shake a hoof at this dance to-night.\"  Then Hodge danced forward in his Indian rig,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22875"],["title","Circus (#1)"],["body","first intelligent life we've yet encountered anywhere. But when I try to tell your people that I'm a native of another star system, _they won't believe me_!\"  \"Why should they?\" asked Morgan. \"You look like a human being. You talk like one. You eat like one. You act like one. What you're asking them to believe is utterly incredible.\"  \"_But it's true._\"  Morgan shrugged. \"So it's true. I won't argue with you. But as I asked before, even if I _did_ believe you, what do you expect _me_ to do about it? Why pick _me_, of all the people you've seen?\"  There was a desperate light in Parks' eyes. \"I was tired, tired of being laughed at, tired of having people looking at me as though I'd lost my wits when I tried to tell them the truth. You were here, you were alone, so I started talking. And then I found out you wrote stories.\" He looked up eagerly. \"I've got to get back, Morgan, somehow. My life is there, my family. And think what it would mean to both of our worlds--contact with another intelligent race! Combine our knowledges, our technologies, and we could explore the galaxy!\"  He leaned forward, his thin face intense. \"I need money and I need help. I know some of the mathematics of the warp principle, know some of the design, some of the power and wiring principles. You have engineers here, technologists, physicists. They could fill in what I don't know and build a guide beam. But they won't do it if they don't believe me. Your government won't listen to me, they won't appropriate any money.\"  \"Of course they won't. They've got a war or two on their hands, they have public welfare, and atomic bombs, and rockets to the moon to sink their money into.\" Morgan stared at the man. \"But what can _I_ do?\"  \"You can _write_! That's what you can do. You can tell the world about me, you can tell exactly what has happened. I know how public interest can be aroused in my world. It must be the same in yours.\"  Morgan didn't move. He just stared. \"How many people have you talked to?\" he asked.  \"A dozen, a hundred, maybe a thousand.\"  \"And how many believed you?\"  \"None.\"  \"You mean _nobody_ would believe you?\"  \"_Not one soul._ Until I talked to you.\"  And then Morgan was laughing, laughing bitterly, tears rolling down his cheeks. \"And I'm the one man who couldn't help you if my life depended on it,\" he gasped.  \"You believe me?\"  Morgan nodded sadly. \"I believe you. Yes. I think your warp brought you through to a parallel universe of your own planet, not to another star, but I think you're telling the truth.\"  \"Then you _can_ help me.\"  \"I'm afraid not.\"  \"Why not?\"  \"Because I'd be worse than no help at all.\"  Jefferson Parks gripped the table, his knuckles white. \"Why?\" he cried hoarsely. \"If you believe me, why can't you help me?\"  Morgan pointed to the magazine lying on the table. \"I write, yes,\" he said sadly. \"Ever read stories like this before?\"  Parks picked up the magazine, glanced at the bright cover. \"I barely looked at it.\"  \"You should look more closely. I have a story in this issue. The readers thought it was very interesting,\" Morgan grinned. \"Go ahead, look at it.\"  The stranger from the stars leafed through the magazine, stopped at a page that carried Roger Morgan's name. His eyes caught the first paragraph and he turned white. He set the magazine down with a trembling hand. \"I see,\" he said, and the life was gone out of his voice. He spread the pages viciously, read the lines again.  The paragraph said:      \"Just suppose,\" said Martin, \"that I _did_ believe you. Just for     argument.\" He glanced up at the man across the table. \"Where do we     go from here?\""]]]
