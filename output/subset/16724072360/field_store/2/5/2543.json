Each nation, such was                    her inconceivable good fortune, waited till another                    had been conquered, before beginning the attack.\"                    Rome fell as soon as all the nations assailed and                    penetrated on every side.]  Hostilities ended with the abdication of Napoleon. The people of Paris, who had scarcely recovered from the panic with which they were struck by the marauding hordes of Russia, displayed the most extravagant gladness when they thought that they were delivered from the visitation, which again threatened them in the presence of the allies and the imperial army.  The neighbouring departments, which the enemy prepared to invade, rejoiced on being relieved from impending pillage and devastation.  The departments which had been occupied by the enemy were intoxicated with joy, when they anticipated the termination of their sufferings.  Thus almost all the people of France turned away from their discarded sovereign. And they abandoned themselves to joy when they thought that they were delivered from the scourge of war, and that they could hope to enjoy the blessings of peace.  It was in the midst of this pouring out of the spirit of selfishness, that the senate raised the brother of Louis XVI. to the throne. His election was not in conformity to the expectations of the people, and it disappointed the wishes which had been uttered in favour of the Empress and her son; yet the choice of the senate was but slightly opposed, because the recall of Louis seemed to be necessarily the pledge of peace. And peace was more the object of the public wish than any other thing. Besides which, the Bourbons followed the wise counsels which had been given to them. They lost no time in issuing their proclamations, couched in fair language, in order to calm the fears and diminish the antipathies excited by their recall.  \"We will guarantee,\" said they, \"the rank, the honours, and the rewards of the military.  \"The magistracy and all public functionaries shall retain their offices and their pre-eminence.  \"To the people we promise a total oblivion of their political conduct; and we will maintain them in the full enjoyment of their civil rights, their property, and their social institutions.\"  The French nation, whose confidence is so easily abused, considered these promises as sacred and inviolable, and they delighted in repeating the happy reply of the Count of Artois[3], \"Il n'y aura rien de changé en France, il n'y aura que quelques Français de plus.\" They, the men, who had banished the imperial dynasty, laboured to foster the growing confidence of the nation. The press was brought into full play, and the country teemed with publications in which they represented the sovereign whom they had brought in, as invested with those attributes which were calculated to conciliate the nation. The public were carefully informed, that the king \"opened and read all the dispatches himself. It is he who dictates every answer. Where it becomes necessary to meet the ministers of foreign powers, he transacts business with them; he receives the reports of their missions, which he answers either by word of mouth, or in writing. In short, he alone directs all the concerns of the government, both at home and abroad. If his virtues and goodness are such as to cause the French to know that they will now find a kind and affectionate father in their King, they may also look with confidence to the future fate of the nation, relying on his brilliant information, his strength of character, and his aptitude for business[4].\"                     [Footnote 3: He arrived at Paris before his august                    brother, and by these pleasing expressions he                    replied to the addresses of congratulation                    presented to him by the municipality of Paris.]                     [Footnote 4: Extracted from the Journal des Débats.                    The principal proprietor and editor of this paper                    was Monsieur Laborie, one of Talleyrand's                    creatures, and private secretary to the provisional                    government.]  Thus the people congratulated themselves, when they were assured that their Chief Magistrate was an enlightened sovereign, a kind sovereign, an equitable sovereign, and one who was determined not to allow the guiding reins of the state to slip from his paternal hands into those of his ministers. Our lively imagination gave us a present enjoyment of the blessings, which, as we anticipated, would hereafter be diffused over the kingdom by his goodness, his prudence, and his acquirements. If this glowing vision of hope and loyalty was slightly dimmed by a few secret doubts, such misgivings were checked and repelled by the name of our native country; nay, by the name of the Emperor himself. For when Napoleon bade farewell to his trusty soldiers, it was in these words: \"Be faithful to the new sovereign of France; do not rend asunder our beloved and long-suffering land.\"  These circumstances (nor must the charm of novelty be excluded) united in favour of the king, and won every head and every heart. He appeared--he was received with acclamations of love and gladness, which resounded until he entered the palace of his forefathers.  No counter revolution ever effected the change of a royal dynasty, under such favourable auspices.  The French nation felt jaded by civil dissensions, by misfortune--even their victories had weaned them. They longed for the happiness of repose. Memorable were the words of the king's brother; \"let us forget the past, let us look only towards the future, let us all unite in the good work of labouring to heal the wounds of our common country;\" and these honoured precepts had become implanted in every mind. They formed the canon of all our feelings and all our duties.  As long as the machinery of the new government did not begin to work, this loyal harmony subsisted, and no longer. For when it became necessary to settle the organization of the army, the ministry, and the magistracy, then self-love gained an easy victory over patriotism, and the bad passions, pride, ambition, and party-hatred, roused themselves from their slumber.  During a quarter of a century, our emigrants had sojourned in a strange country. Useless and troublesome guests to the strangers by whom they were fed, their lives had been droned away in shameless and cowardly idleness. They could not cheat themselves into a belief that they possessed the talents and experience of the sons of the revolution. But they imagined that nobility, as in the old time, might pass for worth; and that their patents and pedigrees still gave them a right to monopolize all power and all honour.  The citizens, the soldiers, the nation, relied on the lawfulness of their rights no less than on the promises of the king. The members of the old privileged caste, instead of exciting suspicion, were only the objects of harmless mirth. The people laughed at the grotesque appearance of some, and at the decrepit sottishness of others. They never dreamed that these pretended warriors, whose bloodless swords had rusted in their scabbards, would attempt to snatch the staff of command from the veteran generals of France; and that nobles who had grown old in sloth and ignorance would aspire to the direction of public affairs.  But though merit and valour were denied to them, they stood upon a vantage ground, which gave them a direful and incalculable preponderance in the state. They surrounded the throne. Soon did their insolence announce that they had craftily availed themselves of the advantages which they possessed; and we foresaw with affliction that inveterate prejudice, malignant prepossessions, and old habits of familiarity, would, sooner or later, crush the principles of justice and equity, however solemnly proclaimed.  The emigrants, rendered arrogant by the prospects which opened upon them, now treated their rivals with contemptuous disdain. They dared not insult the defenders of our country face to face, because the scars of the warriors scared them. But they were spitefully active in disparaging their birth, their services, and their glory, and these noble retainers of royalty took care to impress the soldiers of Napoleon with a due sense of the width of the gulf which was henceforth to separate a gentleman of good family, from an upstart soldier of the revolution.  The women of the _ancien régime_ did not share in the timidity which, to a certain degree, still restrained their husbands. They threw off all decency and all reserve, and indulged in all the fury of their spite and pride. Without attempting to disguise their sentiments, they openly insulted the titled dames belonging to the new nobility, and such of the latter as were compelled to go to court on account of the situations held by their husbands, never entered the saloon without dread, and never quitted it without being bathed in tears.  Uneasy, harassed, and discontented, the people implored the fulfilment of the king's promises: they prayed with confidence; but the government heard them not, and repulsed them harshly. The Doge of Genoa, speaking of Louis XIV, said, \"his majesty steals our hearts by his amiability, but his ministers give them back again to us.\" The apophthegm of the Doge might have been pertinently applied to Louis XVIII. by the people.  Hitherto the government appeared to adhere to the resolution of dealing out impartial justice to both parties, and of performing the covenant which the new monarch had entered into with the nation. But now he was bound by an influence which he could not withstand. Ensnared by the machinations, the threats, and the fears of his emigrant court, and perhaps believing that the new order of things was incompatible with the stability of the Bourbon dynasty, the maxims of his government underwent a total change."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22346"],["title","Exile (#1)"],["body","sleep, his mouth was thin and hard.  \"Thrown across the controls after his belt broke loose?\" Kinton guessed.  \"I bow to your wisdom, George,\" said the plump Tepoktan doctor who appeared to be in charge.  Kinton could not remember him, but everyone on the planet addressed the Terran by the sound they fondly thought to be his first name.  \"This is Doctor Chuxolkhee,\" murmured Klaft.  Kinton made the accepted gesture of greeting with one hand and said, \"You seem to have treated him very expertly.\"  Chuxolkhee ruffled the scales around his neck with pleasure.  \"I have studied Terran physiology,\" he admitted complacently. \"From your records and drawings, of course, George, for I have not yet had the good fortune to visit you.\"  \"We must arrange a visit soon,\" said Kinton. \"Klaft will--\"  He broke off at the sound from the patient.  \"A Terran!\" mumbled the injured man.  He shook his head dazedly, tried to sit up, and subsided with a groan.  _Why, he looked scared when he saw me_, thought Kinton.  \"You're all right now,\" he said soothingly. \"It's all over and you're in good hands. I gather there were no other survivors of the crash?\"  The man stared curiously. Kinton realized that his own language sputtered clumsily from his lips after ten years. He tried again.  \"My name is George Kinton. I don't blame you if I'm hard to understand. You see, I've been here ten years without ever having another Terran to speak to.\"  The spaceman considered that for a few breaths, then seemed to relax.  \"Al Birken,\" he introduced himself laconically. \"Ten years?\"  \"A little over,\" confirmed Kinton. \"It's extremely unusual that anything gets through to the surface, let alone a spaceship. What happened to you?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Birken's stare was suspicious.  \"Then you ain't heard about the new colonies? Naw--you musta come here when all the planets were open.\"  \"We had a small settlement on the second planet,\" Kinton told him. \"You mean there are new Terran colonies?\"  \"Yeah. Jet-hoppers spreadin' all over the other five. None of the land-hungry poops figured a way to set down here, though, or they'd be creepin' around this planet too.\"  \"How did you happen to do it? Run out of fuel?\"  The other eyed him for a few seconds before dropping his gaze. Kinton was struck with sudden doubt. The outposts of civilization were followed by less desirable developments as a general rule--prisons, for instance. He resolved to be wary of the visitor.  \"Ya might say I was explorin',\" Birken replied at last. \"That's why I come alone. Didn't want nobody else hurt if I didn't make it. Say, how bad am I banged up?\"  Kinton realized guiltily that the man should be resting. He had lost track of the moments he had wasted in talk while the others with him stood attentively about.  He questioned the doctor briefly and relayed the information that Birken's leg was broken but that the other injuries were not serious.  \"They'll fix you up,\" he assured the spaceman. \"They're quite good at it, even if the sight of one does make you think a little of an iguana. Rest up, now; and I'll come back again when you're feeling better.\"  For the next three weeks, Kinton flew back and forth from his own town nearly every day. He felt that he should not neglect the few meetings which were the only way he could repay the Tepoktans for all they did for him. On the other hand, the chance to see and talk with one of his own kind drew him like a magnet to the hospital.  The doctors operated upon Birken's leg, inserting a metal rod inside the bone by a method they had known before Kinton described it. The new arrival expected to be able to walk, with care, almost any day; although the pin would have to be removed after the bone had healed. Meanwhile, Birken seemed eager to learn all Kinton could tell him about the planet, Tepokt.  About himself, he was remarkably reticent. Kinton worried about this.  \"I think we should not expect too much of this Terran,\" he warned Klaft uneasily. \"You, too, have citizens who do not always obey, your laws, who sometimes ... that is--\"  \"Who are born to die under the axe, as we say,\" interrupted Klaft, as if to ease the concern plain on Kinton's face. \"In other words, criminals. You suspect this Albirken is such a one, George?\"  \"It is not impossible,\" admitted Kinton unhappily. \"He will tell me little about himself. It may be that he was caught in Tepokt's gravity while fleeing from justice.\"  To himself, he wished he had not told Birken about the spaceship. He didn't think the man exactly believed his explanation of why there was no use taking off in it.         *       *       *       *       *  Yet he continued to spend as much time as he could visiting the other man. Then, as his helicopter landed at the city airport one gray dawn, the news reached him.  \"The other Terran has gone,\" Klaft reported, turning from the breathless messenger as Kinton followed him from the machine.  \"Gone? Where did they take him?\"  Klaft looked uneasy, embarrassed. Kinton repeated his question, wondering about the group of armed police on hand.  \"In the night,\" Klaft hissed and clucked, \"when none would think to watch him, they tell me ... and quite rightly, I think--\"  \"Get on with it, Klaft! Please!\"  \"In the night, then, Albirken left the chamber in which he lay. He can walk some now, you know, because of Dr. Chuxolkhee's metal pin. He--he stole a ground car and is gone.\"  \"He did?\" Kinton had an empty feeling in the pit of his stomach. \"Is it known where he went? I mean ... he has been curious to see some of Tepokt. Perhaps--\"  He stopped, his own words braying in his ears. Klaft was clicking two claws together, a sign of emphatic disagreement.  \"Albirken,\" he said, \"was soon followed by three police constables in another vehicle. They found him heading in the direction of our town.\"  \"Why did he say he was traveling that way?\" asked Kinton, thinking to himself of the spaceship! Was the man crazy?  \"He did not say,\" answered Klaft expressionlessly. \"Taking them by surprise, he killed two of the constables and injured the third before fleeing with one of their spears.\"  \"_What?_\"  Kinton felt his eyes bulging with dismay.  \"Yes, for they carried only the short spears of their authority, not expecting to need fire weapons.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Kinton looked from him to the messenger, noticing for the first time that the latter was an under-officer of police. He shook his head distractedly. It appeared that his suspicions concerning Birken had been only too accurate.  Why was it one like him who got through? he asked himself in silent anguish. After ten years. The Tepoktans had been thinking well of Terrans, but now--  He did not worry about his own position. That was well enough established, whether or not he could again hold up his head before the purple-scaled people who had been so generous to him.  Even if they had been aroused to a rage by the killing, Kinton told himself, he would not have been concerned about himself. He had reached a fairly ripe age for a spaceman. In fact, he had already enjoyed a decade of borrowed time.  But they were more civilized than that wanton murderer, he realized.  He straightened up, forcing back his early-morning weariness.  \"We must get into the air immediately,\" he told Klaft. \"Perhaps we may see him before he reaches--\"  He broke off at the word \"spaceship\" but he noticed a reserved expression on Klaft's pointed face. His aide had probably reached a conclusion similar to his own.  They climbed back into the cabin and Klaft gave brisk orders to the lean young pilot. A moment later, Kinton saw the ground outside drop away.  Only upon turning around did he realize that two armed Tepoktans had materialized in time to follow Klaft inside.  One was a constable but the other he recognized for an officer of some rank. Both wore slung across their chests weapons resembling long-barreled pistols with large, oddly indented butts to fit Tepoktan claws. The constable, in addition, carried a contraption with a quadruple tube for launching tiny rockets no thicker than Kinton's thumb. These, he knew, were loaded with an explosive worthy of respect on any planet he had heard of.  To protect him, he wondered. Or to get Birken?  The pilot headed the craft back toward Kinton's town in the brightening sky of early day. Long before the buildings of Kinton's institute came into view, they received a radio message about Birken.  \"He has been seen on the road passing the dam,\" Klaft reported soberly after having been called to the pilot's compartment. \"He stopped to demand fuel from some maintenance workers, but they had been warned and fled.\"  \"Couldn't they have seized him?\" demanded Kinton, his tone sharp with the worry he endeavored to control. \"He has that spear, I suppose; but he is only one and injured.\"  Klaft hesitated.  \"Well, couldn't they?\"  The aide looked away, out one of the windows at some sun-dyed clouds ranging from pink to orange. He grimaced and clicked his showy teeth uncomfortably.  \"Perhaps they thought you might be offended, George,\" he answered at last.  Kinton settled back in the seat especially padded to fit the contours of his Terran body, and stared silently at the partition behind the pilot.  In other words, he thought, he was responsible for Birken, who was a Terran, one of his own kind. Maybe they really didn't want to risk hurting his feelings, but that was only part of it. They were leaving it up to him to handle what they considered his private affair.  He wondered what to do. He had no actual faith in the idea that Birken was delirious, or acting under any influence but that of a criminally self-centered nature.  \"I _shouldn't_ have told him about the ship!\" Kinton muttered, gnawing the knuckle of his left thumb. \"He's on the run, all right. Probably scared the colonial authorities will trail him right down through the Dome of Eyes. Wonder what he did?\"  He"]]]
