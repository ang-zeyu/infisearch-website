He is to pay a five-shilling reply.”  We sat for some time in silence after our visitors had left. Holmes smoked hard, with his brows drawn down over his keen eyes, and his head thrust forward in the eager way characteristic of the man.  “Well, Watson,” he asked, turning suddenly upon me, “what do you make of it?”  “I can make nothing of this mystification of Scott Eccles.”  “But the crime?”  “Well, taken with the disappearance of the man’s companions, I should say that they were in some way concerned in the murder and had fled from justice.”  “That is certainly a possible point of view. On the face of it you must admit, however, that it is very strange that his two servants should have been in a conspiracy against him and should have attacked him on the one night when he had a guest. They had him alone at their mercy every other night in the week.”  “Then why did they fly?”  “Quite so. Why did they fly? There is a big fact. Another big fact is the remarkable experience of our client, Scott Eccles. Now, my dear Watson, is it beyond the limits of human ingenuity to furnish an explanation which would cover both of these big facts? If it were one which would also admit of the mysterious note with its very curious phraseology, why, then it would be worth accepting as a temporary hypothesis. If the fresh facts which come to our knowledge all fit themselves into the scheme, then our hypothesis may gradually become a solution.”  “But what is our hypothesis?”  Holmes leaned back in his chair with half-closed eyes.  “You must admit, my dear Watson, that the idea of a joke is impossible. There were grave events afoot, as the sequel showed, and the coaxing of Scott Eccles to Wisteria Lodge had some connection with them.”  “But what possible connection?”  “Let us take it link by link. There is, on the face of it, something unnatural about this strange and sudden friendship between the young Spaniard and Scott Eccles. It was the former who forced the pace. He called upon Eccles at the other end of London on the very day after he first met him, and he kept in close touch with him until he got him down to Esher. Now, what did he want with Eccles? What could Eccles supply? I see no charm in the man. He is not particularly intelligent—not a man likely to be congenial to a quick-witted Latin. Why, then, was he picked out from all the other people whom Garcia met as particularly suited to his purpose? Has he any one outstanding quality? I say that he has. He is the very type of conventional British respectability, and the very man as a witness to impress another Briton. You saw yourself how neither of the inspectors dreamed of questioning his statement, extraordinary as it was.”  “But what was he to witness?”  “Nothing, as things turned out, but everything had they gone another way. That is how I read the matter.”  “I see, he might have proved an alibi.”  “Exactly, my dear Watson; he might have proved an alibi. We will suppose, for argument’s sake, that the household of Wisteria Lodge are confederates in some design. The attempt, whatever it may be, is to come off, we will say, before one o’clock. By some juggling of the clocks it is quite possible that they may have got Scott Eccles to bed earlier than he thought, but in any case it is likely that when Garcia went out of his way to tell him that it was one it was really not more than twelve. If Garcia could do whatever he had to do and be back by the hour mentioned he had evidently a powerful reply to any accusation. Here was this irreproachable Englishman ready to swear in any court of law that the accused was in the house all the time. It was an insurance against the worst.”  “Yes, yes, I see that. But how about the disappearance of the others?”  “I have not all my facts yet, but I do not think there are any insuperable difficulties. Still, it is an error to argue in front of your data. You find yourself insensibly twisting them round to fit your theories.”  “And the message?”  “How did it run? ‘Our own colours, green and white.’ Sounds like racing. ‘Green open, white shut.’ That is clearly a signal. ‘Main stair, first corridor, seventh right, green baize.’ This is an assignation. We may find a jealous husband at the bottom of it all. It was clearly a dangerous quest. She would not have said ‘Godspeed’ had it not been so. ‘D’—that should be a guide.”  “The man was a Spaniard. I suggest that ‘D’ stands for Dolores, a common female name in Spain.”  “Good, Watson, very good—but quite inadmissable. A Spaniard would write to a Spaniard in Spanish. The writer of this note is certainly English. Well, we can only possess our soul in patience until this excellent inspector come back for us. Meanwhile we can thank our lucky fate which has rescued us for a few short hours from the insufferable fatigues of idleness.”  An answer had arrived to Holmes’s telegram before our Surrey officer had returned. Holmes read it and was about to place it in his notebook when he caught a glimpse of my expectant face. He tossed it across with a laugh.  “We are moving in exalted circles,” said he.  The telegram was a list of names and addresses:  Lord Harringby, The Dingle; Sir George Ffolliott, Oxshott Towers; Mr. Hynes Hynes, J.P., Purdley Place; Mr. James Baker Williams, Forton Old Hall; Mr. Henderson, High Gable; Rev. Joshua Stone, Nether Walsling.  “This is a very obvious way of limiting our field of operations,” said Holmes. “No doubt Baynes, with his methodical mind, has already adopted some similar plan.”  “I don’t quite understand.”  “Well, my dear fellow, we have already arrived at the conclusion that the message received by Garcia at dinner was an appointment or an assignation. Now, if the obvious reading of it is correct, and in order to keep the tryst one has to ascend a main stair and seek the seventh door in a corridor, it is perfectly clear that the house is a very large one. It is equally certain that this house cannot be more than a mile or two from Oxshott, since Garcia was walking in that direction and hoped, according to my reading of the facts, to be back in Wisteria Lodge in time to avail himself of an alibi, which would only be valid up to one o’clock. As the number of large houses close to Oxshott must be limited, I adopted the obvious method of sending to the agents mentioned by Scott Eccles and obtaining a list of them. Here they are in this telegram, and the other end of our tangled skein must lie among them.”  It was nearly six o’clock before we found ourselves in the pretty Surrey village of Esher, with Inspector Baynes as our companion.  Holmes and I had taken things for the night, and found comfortable quarters at the Bull. Finally we set out in the company of the detective on our visit to Wisteria Lodge. It was a cold, dark March evening, with a sharp wind and a fine rain beating upon our faces, a fit setting for the wild common over which our road passed and the tragic goal to which it led us.     2. The Tiger of San Pedro   A cold and melancholy walk of a couple of miles brought us to a high wooden gate, which opened into a gloomy avenue of chestnuts. The curved and shadowed drive led us to a low, dark house, pitch-black against a slate-coloured sky. From the front window upon the left of the door there peeped a glimmer of a feeble light.  “There’s a constable in possession,” said Baynes. “I’ll knock at the window.” He stepped across the grass plot and tapped with his hand on the pane. Through the fogged glass I dimly saw a man spring up from a chair beside the fire, and heard a sharp cry from within the room. An instant later a white-faced, hard-breathing policeman had opened the door, the candle wavering in his trembling hand.  “What’s the matter, Walters?” asked Baynes sharply.  The man mopped his forehead with his handkerchief and gave a long sigh of relief.  “I am glad you have come, sir. It has been a long evening, and I don’t think my nerve is as good as it was.”  “Your nerve, Walters? I should not have thought you had a nerve in your body.”  “Well, sir, it’s this lonely, silent house and the queer thing in the kitchen. Then when you tapped at the window I thought it had come again.”  “That what had come again?”  “The devil, sir, for all I know. It was at the window.”  “What was at the window, and when?”  “It was just about two hours ago. The light was just fading. I was sitting reading in the chair. I don’t know what made me look up, but there was a face looking in at me through the lower pane. Lord, sir, what a face it was! I’ll see it in my dreams.”  “Tut, tut, Walters. This is not talk for a police-constable.”  “I know, sir, I know; but it shook me, sir, and there’s no use to deny it. It wasn’t black, sir, nor was it white, nor any colour that I know but a kind of queer shade like clay with a splash of milk in it. Then there was the size of it—it was twice yours, sir. And the look of it—the great staring goggle eyes, and the line of white teeth like a hungry beast. I tell you, sir, I couldn’t move a finger, nor get my breath, till it whisked away and was gone. Out I ran and through the shrubbery, but thank God there was no one there.”  “If I didn’t know you were a good man, Walters, I should put a black mark against you for this. If it were the devil himself a constable on duty should never thank God that he could not lay his hands upon him. I suppose the whole thing is not a vision and a touch of nerves?”  “That, at least, is very easily settled,” said Holmes, lighting his little pocket lantern. “Yes,” he reported, after a short examination of the grass bed, “a number twelve shoe, I should say. If he was all on the same scale as his foot he must certainly have been a giant.”  “What became of him?”  “He seems to have broken through the shrubbery and made for the road.”  “Well,” said the inspector with a grave and thoughtful face, “whoever he may have been, and whatever he may have wanted, he’s gone for the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23505"],["title","Freaks on the Fells: Three Months' Rustication (#1)"],["body","tea-table in his haste; but before he could reach his prostrate son, nurse had him kicking in her arms, and carried him off howling.  \"Darling child!\" said Mrs Sudberry, with her hand on her heart.  \"How you do startle me, John, with your violence!  That is the fifteenth tea-cup this week.\"  The good lady pointed to a shattered member of the set that lay on the tray beside her.  \"I have just ordered a new set, my dear,\" said her husband, in a subdued voice.  \"Our poor dear boy would benefit, I think, by mountain air.  But go on with the _cons_.\"  \"Have I not said enough?\" replied Mrs Sudberry, with an injured look. \"Besides, they have no food in Scotland.\"  This was a somewhat staggering assertion.  The merchant looked astonished.  \"At least,\" pursued his wife, \"they have nothing, I am told, but oatmeal.  Do you imagine that Jacky could live on oatmeal?  Do you suppose that your family would return to London in a condition fit to be looked at, after a summer spent on food such as we give to our horses? No doubt you will tell me they have plenty of milk,--buttermilk, I suppose, which I abhor.  But do you think that I could live with pleasure on sawdust, just because I had milk to take to it?\"  \"But milk implies cream, my dear,\" interposed the merchant, \"and buttermilk implies butter, and both imply cows, which are strong presumptive evidence in favour of beef.  Besides--\"  \"Don't talk to me, Mr Sudberry.  _I_ know better; and Lady Knownothing, who went to Scotland last year, in the most unprejudiced state of mind, came back absolutely horrified by what she had seen.  Why, she actually tells me that the natives still wear the kilt!  The very day she passed through Edinburgh she met five hundred men without trousers!  To be sure, they had guns on their shoulders, and someone told her they were soldiers; but the sight was so appalling that she could not get rid of the impression; she shut her eyes, and ordered the coachman to drive straight through the town, and let her know when she was quite beyond its walls.  She has no doubt whatever that most, if not all, of the other inhabitants of that place were clothed--perhaps I should say unclothed--in the same way.  What surprised poor Lady Knownothing most was, that she did not see nearly so many kilts in the Highlands as she saw on that occasion in Edinburgh, from which she concluded that the natives of Scotland are less barbarous in the north than they are in the south.  But she _did_ see a few.  One man who played those hideous things called the pipes--which, she says, are so very like little pigs being killed--actually came into her presence one day, sat down before her with bare knees, and took a pinch of snuff with a salt-spoon!\"  \"That is a dreadful account, no doubt,\" said Mr Sudberry, \"but you must remember that Lady Knownothing is given to exaggerating, and is therefore not to be depended on.  Have you done with the _cons_?\"  \"Not nearly done, John, but my nervous system cannot stand the sustained contemplation of such things.  I should like to recover breath, and hear what you have to say in favour of this temporary expatriation, I had almost said, of your family.\"  \"Well, then, here goes for the _pros_,\" cried Mr Sudberry, while a gleam of excitement shot from his eyes, and his clinched hand came heavily down on the table.  \"The sixteenth cup--_as near as possible_,\" observed his wife, languidly.  \"Never mind the cups, my dear, but listen to me.  The air of the Highlands is salubrious and bracing--\"  \"And piercingly cold, my dear John,\" interrupted Mrs Sudberry.  \"In summer,\" pursued her husband, regardless of the interruption, \"it is sometimes as clear and warm as it is in Italy--\"  \"And often foggy, my dear.\"  \"The mountain scenery is grand and majestic beyond description--\"  \"Then why attempt to describe it, dear John?\"  \"The hotels in most parts of the Highlands, though rather expensive--\"  \"Ah! think of _that_, my dear.\"  \"Though rather expensive, are excellent; the food is of the best quality, and the wines are passable.  Beds--\"  \"_Have_ they beds, my dear?\"  \"Beds are generally found to be well aired and quite clean, though of course in the poorer and more remote districts they are--\"  \"Hush! pray spare my feelings, my dear John.\"  \"Remote districts, they are not so immaculate as one would wish.  Then there are endless moors covered with game, and splendid lakes and rivers full of fish.  Just think, Mary, what a region for our dear boys to revel in!  Think of the shooting--\"  \"And the dreadful accidents, my dear.\"  \"Think of the fishing--\"  \"And the wet feet, and the colds.  Poor darling Jacky, what a prospect!\"  \"Think of the glorious sunrises seen from the mountain-tops before breakfast--\"  \"And the falling over precipices, and broken necks and limbs, dear John.\"  \"Think of the shaggy ponies for our darling Lucy to ride on--\"  \"Ah! and to fall off.\"  \"And the dew of early morning on the hills, and the mists rolling up from the lakes, and the wild uncultivated beauty of all around us, and the sketching, and walking, and driving--\"  \"Dreadful!\"  \"And bathing and boating--\"  \"And drowning!\"  \"Not to mention the--\"  \"Dear John, have pity on me.  The _pros_ are too much for me.  I cannot stand the thought--\"  \"But, my dear, the _place is taken_.  The thing is _fixed_,\" said Mr Sudberry, with emphasis.  Mrs Sudberry was a wise woman.  When she was told by her husband that a thing was _fixed_, she invariably gave in with a good grace.  Her powers of dissuasion having failed,--as they always did fail,--she arose, kissed Mr Sudberry's forehead, assured him that she would try to make the most of it, since it _was_ fixed, and left the room with the comfortable feeling, of having acted the part of a dutiful wife and a resigned martyr.  It was towards the close of a doubtful summer's evening, several weeks after the conversation just detailed, that a heavy stage-coach, of an old-fashioned description, toiled slowly up the ascent of one of those wild passes, by which access is gained into the highlands of Perthshire.  The course of the vehicle had for some time lain along the banks of a turbulent river, whose waters, when not brawling over a rocky bed in impetuous velocity, or raging down a narrow gorge in misty spray, were curling calmly in deep pools or caldrons, the dark surfaces of which were speckled with foam, and occasionally broken by the leap of a yellow trout or a silver salmon.  To an angler the stream would have been captivating in the extreme, but his ardour would have been somewhat damped by the sight of the dense copsewood which overhung the water, and, while it added to the wild beauty of the scenery, suggested the idea of fishing under difficulties.  When the coach reached the narrowest part of the pass, the driver pulled up, and intimated that, \"she would be obleeged if the leddies and gentlemen would get down and walk up the brae.\"  Hereupon there descended from the top of the vehicle a short, stout, elderly gentleman, in a Glengarry bonnet, green tartan shooting-coat, and shepherd's-plaid vest and pantaloons; two active youths, of the ages of seventeen and fifteen respectively, in precisely similar costume; a man-servant in pepper and salt, and a little thin timid boy in blue, a sort of confidential page without the buttons.  All of them wore drab gaiters and shoes of the thickest conceivable description.  From the inside of the coach there issued a delicate elderly lady, who leaned, in a helpless manner, on the arm of a young, plain, but extremely fresh and sweet-looking girl of about sixteen, whom the elder lady called Lucy, and who was so much engrossed with her mother, that some time elapsed before she could attend to the fervent remarks made by her father and brothers in regard to the scenery.  There also came forth from the interior of the coach a large, red-faced angry woman, who dragged after her a little girl of about eight, who might be described as a modest sunbeam, and a little boy of about five, who resembled nothing short of an imp incarnate.  When they were all out, the entire family and household of Mr Sudberry stood in the centre of that lovely Highland pass, and the coach, which was a special one hired for the occasion, drove slowly up the ascent.  What the various members of the family said in the extravagance of their excited feelings on this occasion we do not intend to reveal.  It has been said that the day was doubtful: in the south the sky was red with the refulgent beams of the setting sun, which gleamed on the mountain peaks and glowed on the purple heather.  Towards the north dark leaden clouds obscured the heavens, and presaged stormy weather.  A few large drops began to fall as they reached the crest of the road, and opened up a view of the enclosed valley or amphitheatre which lay beyond, with a winding river, a dark overshadowed loch, and a noble background of hills.  In the far distance a white house was seen embedded in the blue mountains.  \"Yonder's ta hoose,\" said the driver, as the party overtook the coach, and resumed their places--the males on the top and the females inside.  \"Oh, my dear! look! look!\" cried Mr Sudberry, leaning over the side of the coach; \"there is our house--the white house--our Highland home!\"  At this moment a growl of distant thunder was heard.  It was followed by a scream from Mrs Sudberry, and a cry of--  \"You'd better send Jacky inside, my dear.\"  \"Ah, he may as well remain where he is,\" replied Mr Sudberry, whose imperfect hearing led him to suppose that his spouse had said, \"Jacky's inside, my dear!\" whereas the real truth was that the boy was neither out nor inside.  Master Jacky, be it known, had a remarkably strong will of his own. During the journey he preferred an outside seat in all weathers.  By dint of much coaxing, his mother had induced him to get in beside her for one stage; but he had made himself so insufferably disagreeable, that the good lady was thereafter"]]]
