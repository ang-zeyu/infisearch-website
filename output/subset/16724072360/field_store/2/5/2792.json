His appearance was as ghastly as ever, but all trace of delirium had left him and he spoke in a feeble voice, it is true, but with even more than his usual crispness and lucidity.  \"Well, did you see him, Watson?\"  \"Yes; he is coming.\"  \"Admirable, Watson!  Admirable!  You are the best of messengers.\"  \"He wished to return with me.\"  \"That would never do, Watson.  That would be obviously impossible.  Did he ask what ailed me?\"  \"I told him about the Chinese in the East End.\"  \"Exactly!  Well, Watson, you have done all that a good friend could. You can now disappear from the scene.\"  \"I must wait and hear his opinion, Holmes.\"  \"Of course you must.  But I have reasons to suppose that this opinion would be very much more frank and valuable if he imagines that we are alone.  There is just room behind the head of my bed, Watson.\"  \"My dear Holmes!\"  \"I fear there is no alternative, Watson.  The room does not lend itself to concealment, which is as well, as it is the less likely to arouse suspicion.  But just there, Watson, I fancy that it could be done.\" Suddenly he sat up with a rigid intentness upon his haggard face. \"There are the wheels, Watson.  Quick, man, if you love me!  And don't budge, whatever happens--whatever happens, do you hear?  Don't speak! Don't move!  Just listen with all your ears.\"  Then in an instant his sudden access of strength departed, and his masterful, purposeful talk droned away into the low, vague murmurings of a semi-delirious man.  From the hiding-place into which I had been so swiftly hustled I heard the footfalls upon the stair, with the opening and the closing of the bedroom door.  Then, to my surprise, there came a long silence, broken only by the heavy breathings and gaspings of the sick man.  I could imagine that our visitor was standing by the bedside and looking down at the sufferer.  At last that strange hush was broken.  \"Holmes!\" he cried.  \"Holmes!\" in the insistent tone of one who awakens a sleeper.  \"Can't you hear me, Holmes?\"  There was a rustling, as if he had shaken the sick man roughly by the shoulder.  \"Is that you, Mr. Smith?\"  Holmes whispered.  \"I hardly dared hope that you would come.\"  The other laughed.  \"I should imagine not,\" he said.  \"And yet, you see, I am here. Coals of fire, Holmes--coals of fire!\"  \"It is very good of you--very noble of you.  I appreciate your special knowledge.\"  Our visitor sniggered.  \"You do.  You are, fortunately, the only man in London who does. Do you know what is the matter with you?\"  \"The same,\" said Holmes.  \"Ah!  You recognize the symptoms?\"  \"Only too well.\"  \"Well, I shouldn't be surprised, Holmes.  I shouldn't be surprised if it WERE the same.  A bad lookout for you if it is. Poor Victor was a dead man on the fourth day--a strong, hearty young fellow.  It was certainly, as you said, very surprising that he should have contracted an out-of-the-way Asiatic disease in the heart of London--a disease, too, of which I had made such a very special study.  Singular coincidence, Holmes.  Very smart of you to notice it, but rather uncharitable to suggest that it was cause and effect.\"  \"I knew that you did it.\"  \"Oh, you did, did you?  Well, you couldn't prove it, anyhow.  But what do you think of yourself spreading reports about me like that, and then crawling to me for help the moment you are in trouble?  What sort of a game is that--eh?\"  I heard the rasping, laboured breathing of the sick man.  \"Give me the water!\" he gasped.  \"You're precious near your end, my friend, but I don't want you to go till I have had a word with you.  That's why I give you water.  There, don't slop it about!  That's right.  Can you understand what I say?\"  Holmes groaned.  \"Do what you can for me.  Let bygones be bygones,\" he whispered. \"I'll put the words out of my head--I swear I will.  Only cure me, and I'll forget it.\"  \"Forget what?\"  \"Well, about Victor Savage's death.  You as good as admitted just now that you had done it.  I'll forget it.\"  \"You can forget it or remember it, just as you like.  I don't see you in the witnessbox.  Quite another shaped box, my good Holmes, I assure you.  It matters nothing to me that you should know how my nephew died. It's not him we are talking about.  It's you.\"  \"Yes, yes.\"  \"The fellow who came for me--I've forgotten his name--said that you contracted it down in the East End among the sailors.\"  \"I could only account for it so.\"  \"You are proud of your brains, Holmes, are you not?  Think yourself smart, don't you?  You came across someone who was smarter this time. Now cast your mind back, Holmes.  Can you think of no other way you could have got this thing?\"  \"I can't think.  My mind is gone.  For heaven's sake help me!\"  \"Yes, I will help you.  I'll help you to understand just where you are and how you got there.  I'd like you to know before you die.\"  \"Give me something to ease my pain.\"  \"Painful, is it?  Yes, the coolies used to do some squealing towards the end.  Takes you as cramp, I fancy.\"  \"Yes, yes; it is cramp.\"  \"Well, you can hear what I say, anyhow.  Listen now!  Can you remember any unusual incident in your life just about the time your symptoms began?\"  \"No, no; nothing.\"  \"Think again.\"  \"I'm too ill to think.\"  \"Well, then, I'll help you.  Did anything come by post?\"  \"By post?\"  \"A box by chance?\"  \"I'm fainting--I'm gone!\"  \"Listen, Holmes!\"  There was a sound as if he was shaking the dying man, and it was all that I could do to hold myself quiet in my hiding-place.  \"You must hear me.  You SHALL hear me.  Do you remember a box--an ivory box?  It came on Wednesday.  You opened it--do you remember?\"  \"Yes, yes, I opened it.  There was a sharp spring inside it. Some joke--\"  \"It was no joke, as you will find to your cost.  You fool, you would have it and you have got it.  Who asked you to cross my path?  If you had left me alone I would not have hurt you.\"  \"I remember,\" Holmes gasped.  \"The spring!  It drew blood.  This box--this on the table.\"  \"The very one, by George!  And it may as well leave the room in my pocket.  There goes your last shred of evidence.  But you have the truth now, Holmes, and you can die with the knowledge that I killed you.  You knew too much of the fate of Victor Savage, so I have sent you to share it.  You are very near your end, Holmes. I will sit here and I will watch you die.\"  Holmes's voice had sunk to an almost inaudible whisper.  \"What is that?\" said Smith.  \"Turn up the gas?  Ah, the shadows begin to fall, do they?  Yes, I will turn it up, that I may see you the better.\" He crossed the room and the light suddenly brightened.  \"Is there any other little service that I can do you, my friend?\"  \"A match and a cigarette.\"  I nearly called out in my joy and my amazement.  He was speaking in his natural voice--a little weak, perhaps, but the very voice I knew. There was a long pause, and I felt that Culverton Smith was standing in silent amazement looking down at his companion.  \"What's the meaning of this?\" I heard him say at last in a dry, rasping tone.  \"The best way of successfully acting a part is to be it,\" said Holmes. \"I give you my word that for three days I have tasted neither food nor drink until you were good enough to pour me out that glass of water. But it is the tobacco which I find most irksome.  Ah, here ARE some cigarettes.\"  I heard the striking of a match.  \"That is very much better.  Halloa! halloa!  Do I hear the step of a friend?\"  There were footfalls outside, the door opened, and Inspector Morton appeared.  \"All is in order and this is your man,\" said Holmes.  The officer gave the usual cautions.  \"I arrest you on the charge of the murder of one Victor Savage,\" he concluded.  \"And you might add of the attempted murder of one Sherlock Holmes,\" remarked my friend with a chuckle.  \"To save an invalid trouble, Inspector, Mr. Culverton Smith was good enough to give our signal by turning up the gas.  By the way, the prisoner has a small box in the right-hand pocket of his coat which it would be as well to remove. Thank you.  I would handle it gingerly if I were you.  Put it down here. It may play its part in the trial.\"  There was a sudden rush and a scuffle, followed by the clash of iron and a cry of pain.  \"You'll only get yourself hurt,\" said the inspector.  \"Stand still, will you?\"  There was the click of the closing handcuffs.  \"A nice trap!\" cried the high, snarling voice.  \"It will bring YOU into the dock, Holmes, not me.  He asked me to come here to cure him.  I was sorry for him and I came.  Now he will pretend, no doubt, that I have said anything which he may invent which will corroborate his insane suspicions. You can lie as you like, Holmes.  My word is always as good as yours.\"  \"Good heavens!\" cried Holmes.  \"I had totally forgotten him.  My dear Watson, I owe you a thousand apologies.  To think that I should have overlooked you!  I need not introduce you to Mr. Culverton Smith, since I understand that you met somewhat earlier in the evening. Have you the cab below?  I will follow you when I am dressed, for I may be of some use at the station.  \"I never needed it more,\" said Holmes as he refreshed himself with a glass of claret and some biscuits in the intervals of his toilet. \"However, as you know, my habits are irregular, and such a feat means less to me than to most men.  It was very essential that I should impress Mrs. Hudson with the reality of my condition, since she was to convey it to you, and you in turn to him.  You won't be offended, Watson?  You will realize that among your many talents dissimulation finds no place, and that if you had shared my secret you would never have been able to impress Smith with the urgent necessity of his presence, which was the vital point of the whole scheme.  Knowing his vindictive nature, I was perfectly certain that he would come to look upon his handiwork.\"  \"But your appearance, Holmes--your ghastly face?\"  \"Three days"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23470"],["title","A History of the Four Georges, Volume II (#1)"],["body"," {4} but it was not his humor to spare any man who stood in his way and resisted him.  If he was not magnanimous, at least he did not affect magnanimity.  He did not pretend to regard with contempt or indifference men whom in his heart he believed to be formidable opponents.  It was a tribute to the capacity of a public man to be disliked by Walpole; a still higher tribute to be dreaded by him. One of the men whom the great minister was now beginning to hold in serious dislike and dread was Philip Dormer Stanhope, Earl of Chesterfield.  Born in 1694, Chesterfield was still what would be called in political life a young man; he was not quite forty.  He had led a varied and somewhat eccentric career.  His father, a morose man, had a coldness for him.  Young Stanhope, according to his own account, was an absolute pedant at the university.  \"When I talked my best I quoted Horace; when I aimed at being facetious I quoted Martial; and when I had a mind to be a fine gentleman I talked Ovid.  I was convinced that none but the ancients had common-sense; that the classics contained everything that was either necessary, useful, or ornamental to me; . . . and I was not even without thoughts of wearing the _toga virilis_ of the Romans, instead of the vulgar and illiberal dress of the moderns.\"  Later he had been a devotee of fashion and the gambling-table, was a man of fashion, and a gambler still.  He had travelled; had seen and studied life in many countries and cities and courts; had seen and studied many phases of life.  He professed to be dissipated and even licentious, but he had an ambitious and a daring spirit.  He well knew his own great gifts, and he knew also and frankly recognized the defects of character and temperament which were likely to neutralize their influence.  If he entered the House of Commons before the legal age, if for long he preferred pleasure to politics, he was determined to make a mark in the political world.  We shall see much of Chesterfield in the course of this history; we shall see how utterly unjust and absurd is the common censure which sets him down as a literary and political {5} fribble; we shall see that his speeches were so good that Horace Walpole declares that the finest speech he ever listened to was one of Chesterfield's; we shall see how bold he could be, and what an enlightened judgment he could bring to bear on the most difficult political questions; we shall see how near he went to genuine political greatness.  [Sidenote: 1733--Chesterfield's character]  It is not easy to form a secure opinion as to the real character of Chesterfield.  If one is to believe the accounts of some of the contemporaries who came closest to him and ought to have known him best, Chesterfield had scarcely one great or good quality of heart. His intellect no one disputed, but no one seems to have believed that he had any savor of truth or honor or virtue.  Hervey, who was fond of beating out fancies fine, is at much pains to compare and contrast Chesterfield with Scarborough and Carteret.  Thus, while Lord Scarborough was always searching after truth, loving it, and adhering to it, Chesterfield and Carteret were both of them most abominably given to fable, and both of them often, unnecessarily and consequently indiscreetly so; \"for whoever would lie usefully should lie seldom.\" Lord Scarborough had understanding, with judgment and without wit; Lord Chesterfield a speculative head, with wit and without judgment.  Lord Scarborough had honor and principle, while Chesterfield and Carteret treated all principles of honesty and integrity with such open contempt that they seemed to think the appearance of these qualities would be of as little use to them as the reality.  In short, Lord Scarborough was an honest, prudent man, capable of being a good friend, while Lord Chesterfield and Carteret were dishonest, imprudent creatures, whose principles practically told all their acquaintance, \"If you do not behave to me like knaves, I shall either distrust you as hypocrites or laugh at you as fools.\"  We have said already in this history that a reader, in getting at an estimate of the character of Lord Hervey, will have to strike a sort of balance for himself between {6} the extravagant censure flung at him by his enemies and the extravagant praise blown to him by his friends. But we find no such occasion or opportunity for striking a balance in the case of Lord Chesterfield.  All the testimony goes the one way. What do we hear of him?  That he was dwarfish; that he was hideously ugly; that he was all but deformed; that he was utterly unprincipled, vain, false, treacherous, and cruel; that he had not the slightest faith in the honor of men or the virtue of women; that he was silly enough to believe himself, with all his personal defects, actually irresistible to the most gifted and beautiful woman, and that he was mendacious enough to proclaim himself the successful lover of women who would not have given ear to his love-making for one moment.  Yet we cannot believe that Chesterfield was by any means the monster of ugliness and selfish levity whom his enemies, and some who called themselves his friends, have painted for posterity.  He was, says Hervey, short, disproportioned, thick, and clumsily made; had a broad, rough-featured, ugly face, with black teeth, and a head big enough for a Polyphemus.  \"One Ben Ashurst, who said few good things, though admired for many, told Lord Chesterfield once that he was like a stunted giant, which was a humorous idea and really apposite.\"  His portraits do not by any means bear out the common descriptions of his personal appearance.  Doubtless, Court painters then, as now, flattered or idealized, but one can scarcely believe that any painter coolly converted a hideous face into a rather handsome one and went wholly unreproved by public opinion of his time.  The truth probably is that Chesterfield's bitter, sarcastic, and unsparing tongue made him enemies, who came in the end to see nothing but deformity in his person and perfidy in his heart.  It is easy to say epigrammatically of such a man that his propensity to ridicule, in which he indulged himself with infinite humor and no distinction, and with inexhaustible spirits and no discretion, made him sought and feared, liked and not loved, by most of his acquaintance; it is easy to say that {7} no sex, no relation, no rank, no power, no profession, no friendship, no obligation, was a shield from those pointed, glittering weapons that seemed only to shine to a stander-by, but cut deep in those they touched.  But to say this is not to say all, or to paint a fair picture.  It is evident that he delighted in passing himself off on serious and heavy people as a mere trifler, paradox-maker, and cynic.  He invited them not to take him seriously, and they did take him seriously, but the wrong way.  They believed that he was serious when he professed to have no faith in anything; when he declared that he only lived for pleasure, and did not care by what means he got it; that politics were to him ridiculous, and ambition was the folly of a vulgar mind.  We now know that he had an almost boundless political ambition; and we know, too, that when put under the responsibilities that make or mar statesmen, he showed himself equal to a great task, and proved that he knew how to govern a nation which no English statesman before his time or since was able to rule from Dublin Castle.  If the policy of Chesterfield had been adopted with regard to Ireland, these countries would have been saved more than a century of trouble.  We cannot believe the statesman to have been only superficial and worthless who anticipated in his Irish policy the convictions of Burke and the ideas of Fox.  [Sidenote: 1733--Chesterfield's governing ability]  The time, however, of Chesterfield's Irish administration is yet to come.  At present he is still only a rising man; but every one admits his eloquence and his capacity.  It was he who moved in the House of Lords the \"address of condolence, congratulation, and thanks\" for the speech from the throne on the accession of George the Second.  Since then he had served the King in diplomacy.  He had been Minister to the Hague, and the Hague then was a very different place, in the diplomatist's sense, from what it is now or is ever likely to be again. He had been employed on special missions and had been concerned in the making of important treaties.  He was rewarded for his services with the Garter, and was made Lord Steward {8} of the Household.  He had distinguished himself highly as an orator in the House of Lords; had taken a place among the very foremost parliamentary orators of the day. But he chafed against Walpole's dictatorship, and soon began to show that he was determined not to endure too much of it.  He secretly did all he could to mar Walpole's excise scheme; he encouraged his three brothers to oppose the bill in the House of Commons.  He said witty and sarcastic things about the measure, which of course were duly reported to Walpole's ears.  Perhaps Chesterfield thought he stood too high to be in danger from Walpole's hand.  If he did think so he soon found out his mistake.  Walpole's hand struck him down in the most unsparing and humiliating way.  Public affront was added to political deprivation. Lord Chesterfield was actually going up the great stairs of St. James's Palace, on the day but one after the Excise Bill had been withdrawn, when he was stopped by an official and bidden to go home and bring back the white staff which was the emblem of his office, of all the chief offices of the Household, and surrender it.  Chesterfield took the demand thus ungraciously made with his usual composure and politeness. He wrote a letter to the King, which the King showed to Walpole, but did not think fit to answer.  The letter, Walpole afterwards told Lord Hervey, was \"extremely labored but not well done.\""]]]
