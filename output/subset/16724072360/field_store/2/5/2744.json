But now I'll tell 'ee of this noo situation.\"  Both mother and son looked inquiringly up, but did not speak, being too busy and hungry.  \"Well, this is how it came about.  I met Isaac Dorkin on my way to the docks this mornin', an' he says to me, says he, `John, I met a gentleman who is makin' very partikler inquiries about the Eddystone Rock: his name he says is Rudyerd, and he wants to hire a lot o' first-rate men to begin a new--'\"  \"A noo light'ouse!\" exclaimed Mrs Potter, with sudden energy, bringing her fist down on the table with such force that the dishes rattled again.  \"I know'd it: I did.  I've 'ad a settled conviction that if ever they begun to put up another 'ouse on that there rock, you would 'ave your finger in it!  And now it'll be the old story over again: out in all weathers, gettin' yer limbs bruised, if yer neck ain't broke; comin' 'ome like a drownded rat, no regular hours or meals!  Oh John, John!\"  Mrs Potter stopped at this point to recover breath and make up her mind whether to storm or weep.  Heaving a deep sigh she did neither, but went on with her supper in sad silence.  \"Don't take on like that, duckey,\" said John, stretching his long arm across the table and patting his wife's shoulder.  \"It won't be so bad as that comes to, and it will bring steady work, besides lots o' money.\"  \"Go on with the story, faither,\" said Tommy, through a potato, while his eyes glittered with excitement.  \"It ain't a story, lad.  However, to make it short I may come to the pint at once.  Isaac got engaged himself and mentioned my name to Mr Rudyerd, who took the trouble to ferret me out in the docks and--and in fact engaged me for the work, which is to begin next week.\"  \"Capital!\" exclaimed Tommy.  \"Oh, how I wish I was old enough to go too!\"  \"Time enough, lad: every dog shall have his day, as the proverb says.\"  Mrs Potter said nothing, but sighed, and sought comfort in another cup of tea.  Meanwhile John continued his talk in an easy, off hand sort of way, between bite.  \"This Mr Rudyerd, you must know (pass the loaf, Tommy: thank 'ee), is a Cornish man--and fine, straightforward, go-ahead fellows them Cornish men are, though I'm not one myself.  Ah, you needn't turn up your pretty nose, Mrs Potter; I would rather have bin born in Cornwall than any other county in England, if I'd had my choice.  Howsever, that ain't possible now.  Well, it seems that Mr Rudyerd is a remarkable sort of man.  He came of poor an' dishonest parents, from whom he runned away in his young days, an' got employed by a Plymouth gentleman, who became a true father to him, and got him a good edication in readin', writin', an' mathematics.  Ah, Tommy, my son, many a time have I had cause for to regret that nobody gave me a good edication!\"  \"Fiddlesticks!\" exclaimed Mrs Potter, rousing up at this.  \"You've got edication enough for your station in life, and a deal more than most men in the same trade.  You oughtn't for to undervally yourself, John.  I'd back you against all your acquaintance in the matter of edication, I would, so don't talk any more nonsense like that.\"  Mrs Potter concluded by emphatically stabbing a potato with her fork, and beginning to peel it.  John smiled sadly and shook his head, but he was too wise a man to oppose his wife on such a point.  \"However, Tommy,\" he continued, \"I'll not let _you_ have the same regrets in after life, my son: God helping me, you shall have a good; edication.  Well, as I was sayin', John Rudyerd the runaway boy became Mister Rudyerd the silk-mercer on Ludgate Hill, London, and now he's goin' to build a noo light'ouse on the Eddystun.\"  \"He'd do better to mind his shop,\" said Mrs Potter.  \"He must be a strange man,\" observed Tommy, \"to be both a silk-mercer and an engineer.\"  Tommy was right: Mr Rudyerd was indeed a strange man, for the lighthouse which he ultimately erected on the Eddystone Rock proved that, although not a professional engineer, and although he never attempted any other great work of the kind, he nevertheless possessed engineering talent of the highest order: a fact which must of course have been known to Captain Lovet, the gentleman who selected him for the arduous undertaking.  The corporation of the Trinity House, who managed the lighthouses on the English coast, had let the right to build on the Eddystone, for a period of 99 years, to this Captain Lovet, who appointed Mr Rudyerd to do the work.  It was a clear calm morning in July 1706 when the boat put off for the first time to \"the Rock,\" with the men and materials for commencing the lighthouse.  Our friend John Potter sat at the helm.  Opposite to him sat his testy friend, Isaac Dorkin, pulling the stroke oar.  Mr Rudyerd and his two assistant engineers sat on either hand, conversing on the subject that filled the thoughts of all.  It was a long hard pull, even on a calm day, but stout oars and strong arms soon carried them out to the rock.  Being low water at the time, a good deal of it was visible, besides several jagged peaks of the black forbidding ridge of which the Eddystone forms a part.  But calm though it was, the party could plainly see that the work before them would be both difficult and dangerous.  A slight swell from the open sea caused a long smooth glassy wave to roll solemnly forward every minute or two, and launch itself in thunder on the weather side, sending its spray right over the rock at times, so that a landing on that side would have been impossible.  On the lee side, however, the boat found a sort of temporary harbour.  Here they landed, but not altogether without mishap.  Isaac Dorkin, who had made himself conspicuous, during the row out, for caustic remarks, and a tendency to contradict, slipped his foot on a piece of seaweed and fell into the water, to the great glee of most of his comrades.  \"Ah, then, sarves you right,\" cried Teddy Maroon, a little Irishman, one of the joiners.  The others laughed, and so did John Potter; but he also stretched out a helping hand and pulled Dorkin out of the sea.  This little incident tended to increase the spirits of the party as they commenced preliminary operations.  The form of the little mass of rock on which they had to build was very unfavourable.  Not only was it small--so small that the largest circle which it was possible to draw on it was only twenty-five feet six inches in diameter, but its surface sloped so much as to afford a very insecure foundation for any sort of building, even if the situation had been an unexposed one.  The former builder, Winstanley, had overcome this difficulty by fastening a circle of strong iron posts into the solid rock, but the weight of his building, coupled with the force of the sea, had snapped these, and thus left the structure literally to slide off its foundation.  The ends of these iron posts, and a bit of chain firmly imbedded in a cleft of the rock, were all that the new party of builders found remaining of the old lighthouse.  Rudyerd determined to guard against a similar catastrophe, by cutting the rock into a succession of flat steps or terraces, so that the weight of his structure should rest perpendicularly on its foundation.  Stormy weather interrupted and delayed him, but he returned with his men again and again to the work, and succeeded in advancing it very considerably during the first year--that is to say, during the few weeks of the summer of that year, in which winds and waves permitted the work to go on.  Many adventures, both ludicrous and thrilling, had these enterprising men while they toiled, by snatches as it were, sometimes almost under water, and always under difficulties; but we are constrained to pass these by, in silence, in order to devote our space to the more important and stirring incidents in the history of this the second lighthouse on the Eddystone,--one of which incidents bade fair to check the progress of the building for an indefinite period of time, and well-nigh brought the career of our hero, John Potter, and his mates to an abrupt close.    CHAPTER THREE.  A VIOLENT INTERRUPTION.  The incident referred to in our last chapter occurred on the afternoon of a calm summer day.  Early that morning, shortly after daybreak, Mr Rudyerd, with his engineers and workmen, put off in the boat to resume operations on the rock after a lapse of nearly a week, during which period rough weather had stopped the work.  They landed without difficulty, the calm being so complete that there was only a little sea caused by the heavy swell on the south-west side of the Eddystone Rock, the leeside being as quiet as a pond.  \"It's not often we have weather like this sir,\" observed John Potter to Mr Rudyerd, as the heavily-laden boat approached the landing place.  \"True, John; a few weeks like this would enable us almost to complete the courses,\" replied the engineer.  \"Easy, lads, easy!  If you run her up so fast you'll stave in the planks.  Stand by with the fender, Teddy!\"  \"Ay, ay, sir!\" cried the man, springing up and seizing a stuffed canvas ball, which he swung over the gunwale just in time to prevent the boat's side from grazing the rock.  \"There now: jump out"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23274"],["title","Lost in the Forest: Wandering Will's Adventures in South America (#1)"],["body","most parts of his body, were blistered by the continual washing of the sea over him, and when he was lifted on board his skin was icy cold.  Had he not been a man of iron mould, he must certainly have perished.  The poor fellow was at once taken into the cabin and carefully attended to.  He was first bathed in fresh water, then rolled in blankets, and a tumbler of hot wine and water administered, which greatly revived him, and soon caused him to fall into a sound sleep.  Whether it was that this incident softened the hearts of the seamen for a time, or that their plans were not yet ripe for execution, we cannot tell, but certain it is that nothing whatever occurred to justify Captain Dall's suspicions for several weeks after that.    CHAPTER TWO.  DESCRIBES A MUTINY, AND SHOWS THAT THE BEST OF FRIENDS MAY PART SOONER THAN THEY EXPECT.  \"A wilful man will have his way.\"  That this is a true proverb is almost universally admitted; indeed, there is reason to believe that it is equally true of women as of men; nevertheless, Captain Blathers did not believe it although he was himself a living illustration of its truth. He laughed at Captain Dall when that worthy warned him of the mutinous intentions of his crew, and when several weeks had passed away without any signs of disaffection appearing, he rallied him a good deal about what he styled his suspicious disposition, and refused to take any steps to guard against surprise.  The consequence was, that when the storm did break, he was utterly unprepared to meet it.  Griffin, the second mate, was the leader of the conspiracy, but so ably did he act his villainous part, that no one suspected him.  He was a tall, powerful, swarthy man, with a handsome but forbidding countenance.  One evening a little before sunset, while the captain was sitting at tea with those who usually messed in the cabin, Griffin looked down the skylight and reported \"a sail on the weather bow.\"  The captain immediately rose and went on deck.  The moment he appeared he was seized by Griffin.  Captain Blathers was an active and powerful man, and very passionate.  He clenched his fist and struck the second mate a blow on the chest, which caused him to stagger back, but, before he could repeat it, two sailors seized him from behind and held him fast.  The noise of the scuffle at once brought up the first mate, who was followed by Will Osten, Captain Dall, and others, all of whom were seized by the crew and secured as they successively made their appearance.  Resistance was of course offered by each, but in vain, for the thing was promptly and thoroughly carried out.  Four strong men stood at the head of the companion with ropes ready to secure their prisoners, while the greater part of the crew stood close by, armed with pistols and cutlasses.  \"It is of no use resisting, Captain Blathers,\" said Griffin, when the former was pinioned; \"you see we are quite prepared, and thoroughly in earnest.\"  The captain looked round, and a glance sufficed to convince him that this was true.  Not a friendly eye met his, because those of the crew who were suspected of being favourable to him, or who could not be safely relied on, had been seized by another party of mutineers at the same time that those in the cabin were captured, and among them were three friends of our hero--Mr Cupples the mate, Muggins, and Larry O'Hale, seamen belonging to the lost _Foam_ to which Captain Dall had referred while conversing with Will.  For a few seconds Captain Blathers' face blazed with wrath, and he seemed about to make a desperate attempt to break his bonds, but by a strong effort he restrained himself.  \"What do you intend to do?\" he asked at length, in a deep, husky voice.  \"To take possession of this ship,\" replied the second mate, with a slightly sarcastic smile.  \"These men have taken a fancy to lead a free, roving life, and to make me their captain, and I am inclined to fall in with their fancy, and to relieve you of the command.\"  \"Scoundrel!\" exclaimed the captain, \"say rather that you have misled the men, and that--\"  He checked himself, and then said sternly, \"And pray what do you intend to do with _me_?\"  \"I shall allow you a boat and provisions, Captain Blathers, for the use of yourself and your friends, and then bid you farewell.  You see we are mercifully inclined, and have no desire to shed your blood.  Ho! there-- lower one of the quarter boats.\"  This order was obeyed with promptitude.  Some provisions were thrown into the boat, and the captain was cast loose and ordered to get into it.  He turned to make a last appeal to the crew, but Griffin presented a pistol at his head and ordered him peremptorily to get into the boat. It is probable that he would have made another effort, had not two of the men forced him over the side.  Seeing this, Will Osten was so indignant and so anxious to quit the ship, that he stepped forward with alacrity to follow him.  \"No, no, my fine young fellow,\" said Griffin, thrusting him back, \"we want your help as a doctor a little longer.  It may be that you are not inclined to serve us, but we can find a way of compelling you if you're not.  Come, Mr Dall, be good enough to go next.\"  When Captain Dall's hands were loosed, he shook his fist in the second mate's face, and said, \"Rascal, you'll swing for this yet; mark my words, you'll swing for it.\"  Having relieved his feelings thus, he went over the side.  While this was going on, Larry O'Hale, Muggins, and Mr Cupples, with several others, were brought to the gangway.  Griffin addressed these before ordering them into the boat.  \"My lads,\" he said, \"I have no objection to your remaining aboard, if you choose to take part with us.\"  \"I, for one, will have nothing to do with 'e,\" said Mr Cupples sternly.  \"Then you may go,\" said Griffin, with a sneer.  Muggins, who, to use one of his own phrases, looked \"as sulky as a bear with a broken head,\" made no reply, but Larry O'Hale exclaimed, \"Sure, then, what better can I do than take part with yees?  It's a heavenly raigin o' the arth this, an good company.  Put me down on the books, Capting Griffin, dear.  I'd niver desart ye in your troubles,--be no mains.\"  There was a slight laugh at this, and Larry was graciously cast loose, and permitted to remain.  Both Will Osten and Muggins gazed at him, however, in amazement, for they had supposed that their comrade would rather have taken his chance in the captain's boat.  Suddenly an intelligent gleam shot athwart the rough visage of Muggins, and he said--  \"Of coorse I'll remain too.  It would be madness for an old salt like me to go paddlin' about the ocean in a cockleshell of a boat when he has the chance of sailin' in a good ship.  Put me down too, capting.  I'm game for anything a'most, from pitch an' toss to manslaughter.\"  So Muggins was added to the ship's company, and poor Mr Cupples went over the side with a face almost as long as his thin body, because of what he deemed the depravity and desertion of his old shipmates. Several of the ship's crew, who refused to join, also went into the boat, which was then cast loose, and dropped rapidly astern.  The whole of this exciting scene passed so quickly, that it was only when the boat was far away, like a speck on the sea, that Will Osten realised the fact that he had actually said farewell, perhaps for over, to his late comrades.  But he had not much time given him for reflection, for the new captain, after changing the course of the ship, and making a few arrangements to suit the altered state of affairs, ordered him to go forward and do duty as a common seaman, telling him that he did not intend to have any land-lubbers or idlers aboard, and that he would be called to do doctor's work when his services should be required.  That night our hero contrived to hold a whispering interview, in a dark corner of the forecastle, with his friends Larry O'Hale and Muggins.  He found that the former had resolved to join the crew in order to be near himself; that Muggins had joined, because of his desire to share the fortunes of Larry; and that both had made up their minds to effect their escape on the first favourable opportunity.  \"Now, ye see, boys,\" said Larry, \"this is how it is--\"  \"Don't open your bread-basket hatch so wide,\" growled Muggins, \"else you'll be overheerd--that's wot it is.\"  \"This is how it is,\" repeated Larry, \"not bein' fish, nor gulls, nor say sarpints, we haven't the ghost of a chance of gettin' away from this ship till we're close to land, an' even then we wont have much chance if it's suspected that we want to escape.  What then?--why, let us from this hour agree to give each other the cowld shoulder, and go at our work as if we liked it.\"  \"You're right, Larry,\" said Will.  \"If they see us much together, they'll naturally suspect that we are plotting, so--\"  At this point a voice growled from an adjacent hammock--  \"Avast spinnin' yarns there, will 'e!\"  \"Ay, it's that sea-cook, Larry O'Hale,\" cried Muggins aloud; \"he was always over fond o' talking.\"  Larry, who at the first sound had slipped away to his hammock, shouted from under the blankets, \"Ye spalpeen, it's no more me than yersilf; sure I'd have been draimin' of ould Ireland if ye--hadn't--(snore) me grandmother--(yawn) or the pig--\"  A prolonged snore terminated this sentence, and Muggins turned into his hammock, while Will Osten rose, with a quiet laugh, and went on deck.  One morning, some weeks after the conversation just related, our hero was leaning over the bulwarks near the fore-chains, watching the play of the clear waves as the ship glided quietly but swiftly through them before a light breeze.  Will was in a meditative frame of mind, and had stood there gazing dreamily down for nearly half an hour, when his elbow was touched by the man named Bunco, who had long before recovered from his exposure in the canoe.  Will was a little surprised, for he had not had much intercourse with the man, and could"]]]
