At the period of our story it was a mere cluster of dwellings that were little better than shanties in point of architecture and appearance.  They were, however, somewhat larger than these, and the cleared fields around them, with here and there a little garden railed in, gave them a more homelike aspect than the dwellings of the wood-men.  The valley in which the settlement stood was one of those magnificent stretches of primeval forest which used to be the hunting-grounds of the red man, and from which he had not at that time been thrust by the \"paleface,\" for, here and there, his wigwam might still be seen sending its wreath of blue smoke above the tree-tops.  It was evening--a calm, sunny, glorious, spring evening--when Redding and his man overtopped the heights that enclosed the vale, and paused as well to gaze upon the scene as to recover breath.  Far below them lay the hamlet, a cluster of black dots on a field of pure snow.  Roseate lights on undulations, and cold blue shadows in hollows, were tamed down in effect by the windows of the hamlet which shot forth beams of blazing fire at the setting sun.  Illimitable space seemed to stretch away to the place where the horizon would have been if it had not lost itself in a golden glory, and this vast reach was a varied irregular network of dark pines and fields of snow--the pines tipped everywhere with sparkling snow-wreaths, the fields streaked everywhere with long shadows.  Little winding lines of a grey colour which radiated from the hamlet indicated the tracks where the settlers drove their sleighs and wood-sledges.  Many of these were seen moving along the far-off tracks like insects, while the tinkle of the sleigh-bells floated upwards like fairy music.  \"Yes, I shall take up my abode there,\" murmured Redding, as he gazed in rapt admiration on the beautiful scene.  \"Monsieur?\" said his companion.  \"I say that I should like to dwell there,\" answered Redding.  \"It is a splendid country, and will be better known in days to come.\"  \"Vraiment, truly, a magnifircent kontry,\" returned Le Rue, \"gorgeows, magnifique!  I vould giv moche, ver moche, to have leetil cottage, an vife, an cow, an pigs dere.\"  As Redding had been thinking of something similar, he laughed, and commenced the descent of the zigzag track that led to the hamlet.  They had proceeded only a few yards when, turning round a cluster of pines, they suddenly discovered some travellers in difficulty--a man whose horse had shied or stumbled off the narrow track and was embedded up to the girths in the soft snow, and two females, whose furry garments, all besprinkled with snow, showed that they had just emerged from the sledge, which lay on its side behind the horse.  The driver's chief anxiety seemed to be to quiet and restrain his horse, which being high-spirited, was plunging in vain and frantic efforts to extricate himself, to the great danger of shafts and harness.  To run up and aid the man was of course the instant impulse of our travellers.  \"Ah! good luck to 'ee,\" exclaimed the driver, in tones that were unmistakably Irish, \"here, howld 'is head till I get the sled clear.\"  \"All right,\" cried the Englishman, seizing the reins near the mouth of the terrified animal and holding its head forcibly down, while Le Rue assisted the owner to unharness.  In a few minutes the vehicle was righted, and the horse released.  While the driver was busy readjusting the harness, he accompanied the operation with a running fire of grateful expressions, such as--\"there now, ain't ye in luck, Rooney?  Arrah! gentleman, it's my blissin' I bestow on yez.  Och! but I'd have bin lost intirely widout ye.  Well well, it's always the way.  I'm no sooner in a scrape than I'm sure to get out of it.  It's meself is a favoured man.  Now thin, ladies, git in, for we're late enough on the road.\"  On the two \"ladies\" thus addressed Redding and his man had been gazing in silent surprise, for they were so good-looking and so blooming, that it seemed to the two men, who had been accustomed of late to the sight of none but the brown dames of the red skins, as if a couple of beings from another and a purer world had dropped suddenly upon their path. One of the two was evidently a lady, and was possessed of no common share of beauty.  Her dark hair contrasted powerfully with the fairness of her skin and the whiteness of her teeth.  Her dazzling black eyes almost, and her red lips altogether, laughed as she observed Redding's gaze of astonishment.  Her companion, a very pretty Canadian girl, was evidently her maid.  \"We owe you many thanks, kind sirs,\" said the lady, \"for your opportune assistance.\"  \"Pardon me, madam,\" said Redding, hastening forward in some confusion as he recovered from his rather rude stare of surprise, \"I dwell in the wilderness and have been so unaccustomed of late to the sight of ladies that--that--allow me to assist you into the sleigh!\"  \"Mademoiselle, permettez moi,\" said Le Rue, advancing to the waiting-maid and politely offering his hand.  Another moment and the \"ladies\" were seated in the vehicle and carefully repacked by our travellers, while their Irish driver mounted to his seat in front and gathered up the reins.  \"Thanks, gentlemen, many thanks,\" repeated the ladies, with bewitching smiles.  \"Good luck to 'ee both,\" cried the driver, as he flourished his whip and drove away.  Redding and his man stood silently gazing for several minutes at the turn in the road where the vision had vanished.  \"Heaven for two minits, an' now--gone for evair!\" said Le Rue, with a deep sigh.  Redding echoed the sigh, and then laughed at the lugubrious expression of his man's face.  \"Oh _such_ eyes!\" exclaimed Le Rue.  \"Yes, she's rather good-looking,\" replied Redding, thinking of the lady.  \"Good-looking! non--bootifool--exiquitely bootifool,\" cried Le Rue, thinking of the maid.  Again Redding laughed.  \"Well well, Francois,\" said he, \"whether good-looking or beautiful matters little, for it's not likely that we shall ever see them again, so the less you think about them the better.--Allons! we are late enough and must not loiter.\"  They pushed ahead at once at a rapid pace, but although neither spoke, each thought with somewhat similar feelings of the little incident just described.  Lest the reader should be surprised at so small a matter affecting them so deeply, we must remark that these fur-traders had lived for some years in a region where they saw no females except the brown and rather dirty squaws of the Indians who visited the Cliff Fort with furs.  Their fort was indeed only three days' journey from the little settlement of Partridge Bay, but as the space which lay between was a particularly rugged part of the wilderness, with only a portion of road--unworthy of the name--here and there, and the greater part of the way only passable on foot or by means of dog-sledges, none but an occasional red man or a trapper went to and fro; and as the nature of the fur-trader's business called for very little intercourse with the settlements--their furs being sent by water to Quebec in summer--it followed that the inhabitants of the Cliff Fort rarely visited Partridge Bay.  The sudden vision, therefore, of two pretty females of a higher type had not only the effect on Redding and his man of novelty, but also stirred up old memories and associations.  Such good use did they now make of their time that the settlement of Partridge Bay was reached before dark, and our hero went off immediately in quest of the surveyor.  Mr Gambart was a cheerful, healthy, plump little man, with a plump little wife, and three plump little daughters.  Plumpness was not only a characteristic of the Gambarts, but also of their surroundings, for the cottage in which they dwelt had a certain air of plumpness about it, and the spot on which it stood was a round little knob of a hill.  Here Reginald Redding was hospitably received--we might almost say joyfully, because visitors to the settlement were so rare that whoever made his appearance was sure to be received as a \"welcome guest\" if he only carried the credentials of honesty and ordinary good nature on his countenance.  Redding's impatience, however, to get at the truth of the matter that had brought him there, induced him very soon to forsake the society of the three plump little daughters and retire to the plump little father's work-room.  \"It is my opinion,\" said Mr Gambart, as he carefully unfolded the plan, \"that you may find the McLeods have trespassed somewhat on your reserves, for, if my memory serves me rightly, there is a small islet-- as you see here--just in the centre of the creek, _half_ of which belongs to you.\"  \"I see it,\" said the fur-trader, earnestly gazing on the dot which represented the said island.  \"Well,\" continued the surveyor, \"that islet is a mere rock just above the waterfall, and I am of opinion that it would be almost impossible for any one to erect a mill there without encroaching to some extent on your half of it.\"  \"Good,\" replied the fur-trader, \"can you let me have a copy of the plan to-morrow?\"  \"To-night if you please.  I have one by me.\"  \"Then I'll be off by daybreak the day after to-morrow,\" said Redding, with much decision.  \"Why such haste?\" asked the surveyor, \"the McLeods are not likely to run away from you.  I know them well, for they dwelt long in this settlement, and were ever regarded as men of firm purpose--quite immovable indeed when once they had made up their minds on any point, so you'll be sure to find them at Jenkins Creek carrying out their plans, even though you should delay your return for a month.  Come, make up your mind to stay with us at least a few days.  It will do you as well as me good, and will send you back to banishment in a better frame of mind.\"  Redding, although strongly tempted by the comforts of civilised life and the hospitality of his host--not to mention the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23389"],["title","Handbook to the new Gold-fields (#1)"],["body","the distance from Victoria to the mouth of the river, where gold is at present found inconsiderable quantities, is not so great as the distance from Liverpool to Dublin. Now, as almost all the importance of a mining district depends on easy communication with a provision market--and the very richest will be rendered comparatively insignificant if provisions can only be carried thither at enormous cost and labour--no fact has yet been established of more importance than the easy navigability of the Fraser River. Immediately above Fort Yale, which is twelve miles higher up the river than the point reached by the steamer, a succession of cataracts begin, which, of course, interrupt all navigation, but thence even to \"the Forks,\" or junction between the Fraser and Thompson Rivers, there is certainly not more than one hundred miles of road, which, as we learn from the government map, are mostly practicable for loaded waggons. Hence it is evident that the new gold district will be easily accessible both for English merchandise from England, and for the provision market of Vancouver's Island.  In explanation and refutation of the prejudice which almost universally exists against the climate and soil of North America generally, but especially of the divisions included in the Hudson's Bay Company's Territories, we cannot do better than quote the following just remarks from the Reverend Mr Nicolay's treatise on Oregon.  He says:--  \"A predisposition towards one opinion, or bias to one side of an argument, too often warps both the judgment and the understanding; and one man in consequence sees fertile plains where another could see only arid wastes on which even the lizards appear starving, while the other looks forward to their being covered with countless flocks and herds at no very distant period of time.  Both Cook and Vancouver, having previously made up their minds against the existence of a river near parallel 46 degrees, passed the Columbia without perceiving it, and the former even declared most decidedly that the strait seen by Juan de Fuca had its origin only in the fertility of the pilot's brain.  As they were discovered to be in error, so it is not impossible that others not less positive in their assertions may be convicted of the same carelessness of examination as those navigators, so remarkable in all other respects for their accuracy, and so indefatigable and minute in their researches, that little has been left to their successors but to check their work.  \"With respect, however, to the attributed barrenness of great part of the territory, so peremptorily insisted on by many, there is some excuse for the earlier travellers from whom that opinion is derived.  Ignorant of the best routes, and frequently famishing in the immediate neighbourhood of plenty, they most justly reflect back to others the impressions they received; but in so doing, though they speak truth, they give very erroneous ideas of the country they think themselves to be describing most accurately, and of this very pregnant examples are found in the travels of Lewis and Clarke, and the party who came overland to Astoria: both struck the head waters of the Saptin, both continued its course to its junction with the main stream, both suffered--the latter party intensely; but had they, by the fertile bottoms of Bear and Rosseaux Rivers, found access to the valley between the Cascade and Blue Mountains--or, keeping still further west, crossed the former range into that of the Wallamette, they would have found game, been banished from their pages, and the Oregon would have appeared in her holiday attire--  \"A nymph of healthiest hue--\"  and the depth of ravines and the elevation of rocks and precipices would have been changed into the unerring evidences of fertility and luxuriance of vegetation afforded by the dense forests and gigantic pine-trees of the coast district.  We can scarce estimate the transition of feeling and change which would have been produced in their estimate of the country, if they could have been suddenly transported from their meagre horse-steak--cut from an animal so jaded with travel as to be in all probability only saved from death by starvation and fatigue, by being put to death to save over-wearied men from famine, and this cooked at a fire of _bois de vache_, with only the shelter of an overhanging rock--to the fat venison and savoury wildfowl of the woods and lakes, broiled on the glowing hardwood embers under the comfortable roof of sheltering bark, or the leafy shade of the monarch of the forest; while the cheerful whinny of their well-fed beasts would have given joyful token that nature in her bounty had been forgetful of nothing which her dependent children could desire.  \"While such and so great is the power of circumstances to vary the impressions made upon the senses, some hesitation must be used in their reception until fully confirmed, or they must be limited by other accounts, as unbiassed judgment may direct, especially as the temperament of individuals may serve to heighten the colouring, whether sombre or sunny, in which circumstances may have depicted the landscape. It is not every traveller who can, with Mackenzie, expatiate on the beauty of scenery while in fear of treachery from fickle and bloody savages; or like Fremont, though dripping from the recent flood, and uncertain of the means of existence even for the day, his arms, clothes, provisions, instruments, deep in the whirlpools of the foaming Platte, stop to gaze with admiration on the `fantastic ruins' Nature has `piled' among her mountain fastnesses, while from his bare and bleeding feet he draws the sharp spines of the hostile cacti.  Truth from travellers is consequently for the most part relative.  Abstractedly, with reference to any country, it must be derived from the combined accounts and different phases of truth afforded by many.\"    CHAPTER ONE.  RICHNESS AND EXTENT OF THE GOLD FIELDS.  \"Destiny, which has lately riveted our attention on the burning plains of the extreme East,\" says the _Times_ of 9th July, \"now claims our solicitude for the auriferous mountains and rushing rivers of the Far West and the shores of the remote Pacific.  What most of us know of these ultra-occidental regions may be summed up in a very few words.  We have most of us read Washington Irving's charming narrative of `Astoria,' sympathised with the untimely fate of Captain Thorn and his crew, and read with breathless interest the wanderings of the pilgrims to the head waters of the Columbia.  After thirty years, the curtain rises again on the stormy period of the Ashburton Treaty, when the `patriots' were bent upon `whipping the Britishers' out of every acre of land on the western side of the Rocky Mountains.  And now, for the third time, we are recalled to the same territory, no longer as the goal of the adventurous trader or the battle ground of the political agitator, but as a land of promise--a new El Dorado, to which men are rushing with all the avidity that the presence of the one, thing which all men, in all times and in all places, insatiably desire is sure to create.\"  This El Dorado lies between the Rocky Mountains and the Pacific; it is bounded on the south by the American frontier line, 49 degrees of latitude, and may be considered to extend to the sources of Fraser River, in latitude 55 degrees.  It is, therefore, about 420 miles long in a straight line, its average breadth from 250 to 300 miles.  Taken from corner to corner, its greatest length would be, however, 805 miles,--and its greatest breadth 400 miles, Mr Arrowsmith computes its area of square miles, including Queen Charlotte's Island, at somewhat more than 200,000 miles.  Of its two gold-bearing rivers, one, the Fraser, rises in the northern boundary, and flowing south, falls into the sea at the south-western extremity of the territory, opposite the southern end of Vancouver's Island, and within a few miles of the American boundary; the other, the Thompson River, which rises in the Rocky Mountains, and flowing westward, joins the Fraser about 150 miles from the coast.  It is on these two rivers, and chiefly at their confluence, that the gold discoveries have been made.  Fraser River is about as famous a point as there is today on the earth's surface--as famous as were the Californian diggings in 1848, or the Australian gold mines in 1853.  It is now the centre of attraction for the adventurous of all countries.  The excitement throughout the Canadas and Northern States of America is universal.  In fact, the whole interior of North America is quite in a ferment--the entire floating population being either \"on the move,\" or preparing to start; while traders, cattle-dealers, contractors, and all the enterprising persons in business who can manage to leave, are maturing arrangements to join the general exodus.  Persons travelling in the mining regions reckon that, in three months, 50,000 souls will have left the State of California alone.  The rapidity and extent of this emigration has never been paralleled.  It is now established that the district of British Columbia, holding a relation to Puget's Sound similar to that of Sacramento Valley to the Bay of San Francisco, contains rich and extensive gold beds.  The Fraser River mines have already been mentioned in the British Parliament as not less valuable and important than the gold fields in Australia, Geologists have anticipated such a discovery; and Governor Stevens, in his last message to the Legislative Assembly of Washington Territory, claims that the district south of the international boundary is equally auriferous.  The special correspondent of the _San Francisco Bulletin_, a reliable authority, writes from Fort Langley, twenty-five miles up the Fraser, under date the 25th May, that he had just come down from Fort Yale, where he found sixty men and two hundred Indians, with their squaws, at work on a \"bar\" of about five hundred "]]]
