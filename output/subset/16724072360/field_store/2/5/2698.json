It would be a work worth the historian's labors to mark these various frontiers and in detail compare one with another. Not only would there result a more adequate conception of American development and characteristics, but invaluable additions would be made to the history of society.  Loria,[11:1] the Italian economist, has urged the study of colonial life as an aid in understanding the stages of European development, affirming that colonial settlement is for economic science what the mountain is for geology, bringing to light primitive stratifications. \"America,\" he says, \"has the key to the historical enigma which Europe has sought for centuries in vain, and the land which has no history reveals luminously the course of universal history.\" There is much truth in this. The United States lies like a huge page in the history of society. Line by line as we read this continental page from West to East we find the record of social evolution. It begins with the Indian and the hunter; it goes on to tell of the disintegration of savagery by the entrance of the trader, the pathfinder of civilization; we read the annals of the pastoral stage in ranch life; the exploitation of the soil by the raising of unrotated crops of corn and wheat in sparsely settled farming communities; the intensive culture of the denser farm settlement; and finally the manufacturing organization with city and factory system.[11:2] This page is familiar to the student of census statistics, but how little of it has been used by our historians. Particularly in eastern States this page is a palimpsest. What is now a manufacturing State was in an earlier decade an area of intensive farming. Earlier yet it had been a wheat area, and still earlier the \"range\" had attracted the cattle-herder. Thus Wisconsin, now developing manufacture, is a State with varied agricultural interests. But earlier it was given over to almost exclusive grain-raising, like North Dakota at the present time.  Each of these areas has had an influence in our economic and political history; the evolution of each into a higher stage has worked political transformations. But what constitutional historian has made any adequate attempt to interpret political facts by the light of these social areas and changes?[12:1]  The Atlantic frontier was compounded of fisherman, fur-trader, miner, cattle-raiser, and farmer. Excepting the fisherman, each type of industry was on the march toward the West, impelled by an irresistible attraction. Each passed in successive waves across the continent. Stand at Cumberland Gap and watch the procession of civilization, marching single file--the buffalo following the trail to the salt springs, the Indian, the fur-trader and hunter, the cattle-raiser, the pioneer farmer--and the frontier has passed by. Stand at South Pass in the Rockies a century later and see the same procession with wider intervals between. The unequal rate of advance compels us to distinguish the frontier into the trader's frontier, the rancher's frontier, or the miner's frontier, and the farmer's frontier. When the mines and the cow pens were still near the fall line the traders' pack trains were tinkling across the Alleghanies, and the French on the Great Lakes were fortifying their posts, alarmed by the British trader's birch canoe. When the trappers scaled the Rockies, the farmer was still near the mouth of the Missouri.  Why was it that the Indian trader passed so rapidly across the continent? What effects followed from the trader's frontier? The trade was coeval with American discovery. The Norsemen, Vespuccius, Verrazani, Hudson, John Smith, all trafficked for furs. The Plymouth pilgrims settled in Indian cornfields, and their first return cargo was of beaver and lumber. The records of the various New England colonies show how steadily exploration was carried into the wilderness by this trade. What is true for New England is, as would be expected, even plainer for the rest of the colonies. All along the coast from Maine to Georgia the Indian trade opened up the river courses. Steadily the trader passed westward, utilizing the older lines of French trade. The Ohio, the Great Lakes, the Mississippi, the Missouri, and the Platte, the lines of western advance, were ascended by traders. They found the passes in the Rocky Mountains and guided Lewis and Clark,[13:1] Frémont, and Bidwell. The explanation of the rapidity of this advance is connected with the effects of the trader on the Indian. The trading post left the unarmed tribes at the mercy of those that had purchased fire-arms--a truth which the Iroquois Indians wrote in blood, and so the remote and unvisited tribes gave eager welcome to the trader. \"The savages,\" wrote La Salle, \"take better care of us French than of their own children; from us only can they get guns and goods.\" This accounts for the trader's power and the rapidity of his advance. Thus the disintegrating forces of civilization entered the wilderness. Every river valley and Indian trail became a fissure in Indian society, and so that society became honeycombed. Long before the pioneer farmer appeared on the scene, primitive Indian life had passed away. The farmers met Indians armed with guns. The trading frontier, while steadily undermining Indian power by making the tribes ultimately dependent on the whites, yet, through its sale of guns, gave to the Indian increased power of resistance to the farming frontier. French colonization was dominated by its trading frontier; English colonization by its farming frontier. There was an antagonism between the two frontiers as between the two nations. Said Duquesne to the Iroquois, \"Are you ignorant of the difference between the king of England and the king of France? Go see the forts that our king has established and you will see that you can still hunt under their very walls. They have been placed for your advantage in places which you frequent. The English, on the contrary, are no sooner in possession of a place than the game is driven away. The forest falls before them as they advance, and the soil is laid bare so that you can scarce find the wherewithal to erect a shelter for the night.\"  And yet, in spite of this opposition of the interests of the trader and the farmer, the Indian trade pioneered the way for civilization. The buffalo trail became the Indian trail, and this became the trader's \"trace;\" the trails widened into roads, and the roads into turnpikes, and these in turn were transformed into railroads. The same origin can be shown for the railroads of the South, the Far West, and the Dominion of Canada.[14:1] The trading posts reached by these trails were on the sites of Indian villages which had been placed in positions suggested by nature; and these trading posts, situated so as to command the water systems of the country, have grown into such cities as Albany, Pittsburgh, Detroit, Chicago, St. Louis, Council Bluffs, and Kansas City. Thus civilization in America has followed the arteries made by geology, pouring an ever richer tide through them, until at last the slender paths of aboriginal intercourse have been broadened and interwoven into the complex mazes of modern commercial lines; the wilderness has been interpenetrated by lines of civilization growing ever more numerous. It is like the steady growth of a complex nervous system for the originally simple, inert continent. If one would understand why we are to-day one nation, rather than a collection of isolated states, he must study this economic and social consolidation of the country. In this progress from savage conditions lie topics for the evolutionist.[15:1]  The effect of the Indian frontier as a consolidating agent in our history is important. From the close of the seventeenth century various intercolonial congresses have been called to treat with Indians and establish common measures of defense. Particularism was strongest in colonies with no Indian frontier. This frontier stretched along the western border like a cord of union. The Indian was a common danger, demanding united action. Most celebrated of these conferences was the Albany congress of 1754, called to treat with the Six Nations, and to consider plans of union. Even a cursory reading of the plan proposed by the congress reveals the importance of the frontier. The powers of the general council and the officers were, chiefly, the determination of peace and war with the Indians, the regulation of Indian trade, the purchase of Indian lands, and the creation and government of new settlements as a security against the Indians. It is evident that the unifying tendencies of the Revolutionary period were facilitated by the previous coöperation in the regulation of the frontier. In this connection may be mentioned the importance of the frontier, from that day to this, as a military training school, keeping alive the power of resistance to aggression, and developing the stalwart and rugged qualities of the frontiersman.  It would not be possible in the limits of this paper to trace the other frontiers across the continent. Travelers of the eighteenth century found the \"cowpens\" among the canebrakes and peavine pastures of the South, and the \"cow drivers\" took their droves to Charleston, Philadelphia, and New York.[16:1] Travelers at the close of the War of 1812 met droves of more than a thousand cattle and swine from the interior of Ohio going to Pennsylvania to fatten for the Philadelphia market.[16:2] The ranges of the Great Plains, with ranch and cowboy and nomadic life, are things of yesterday and of to-day. The experience of the Carolina cowpens guided the ranchers of Texas. One element favoring the rapid extension of the rancher's frontier is the fact that in a remote country lacking transportation facilities the product must be in small bulk, or must be able to transport itself, and the cattle raiser could easily drive his product to market.

Spouter Powell was in the lead when the first group of skaters came up to the pine tree. Dan Soppinger was close behind him, with Jack and Randy following. Behind Randy came Walt Baxter, another cadet who skated remarkably well. The others of the first group were gradually dropping back to the second contingent. Spouter Powell touched the tree with his finger tips, and was followed almost immediately by Dan Soppinger. As they turned to go back to the starting point, they were followed by Jack and Randy.  \"Hi, you fellows! what do you mean by skating so quick?\" piped out Andy Rover gaily.  \"We'll leave the tree to you, Andy!\" shouted his twin.  \"I don't think we'll win, but, anyway, we won't be last,\" came from Fred, as he and Andy touched the tree.  \"Well, we can't have everything in this world,\" was the philosophic reply from the other Rover boy.  It could be seen that the race had now narrowed down to the five who were in the lead. Of these, Spouter Powell and Dan Soppinger were less than two feet apart, while only a yard to the rear came Jack, Randy and Walt Baxter.  \"Go it, Randy!\" sang out Andy, as he dropped still further behind. \"Go it! I know you can win!\"  \"Keep it up, Jack!\" yelled Fred, who, being the smallest of the four Rovers, found it impossible to keep up the pace. \"Don't let Spouter and Dan hold you back!\"  There were numerous cries of encouragement for all of the skaters as they swept forward toward the starting point. Here a line had been drawn on the ice, and the cadets stood at either end, some with their watches in their hands to time the winners.  \"I'll bet Dan Soppinger wins!\" cried one of the cadets. \"He's the best skater on the lake.\"  \"Well, Spouter Powell is a good skater, too,\" returned another.  \"Huh! what's the matter with the Rover boys?\" burst out a third cadet, round-faced and remarkably fat--so fat, in fact, that he had not dreamed of participating in the contest.  \"I don't know much about how they can skate,\" was the reply. \"They weren't here last winter, you remember.\"  \"Yes, I know that,\" answered Fatty Hendry.  \"Here they come!\"  By this time the skaters were half way on the return from the blasted pine. Spouter Powell and Dan Soppinger were still in the lead, but Walt Baxter was crawling up steadily, while Jack and Randy were close behind.  \"Say, this is going to be a neck-and-neck race!\" cried one of the cadets, Ned Lowe by name. He had wanted to race himself, but knew that his skates were too dull for that purpose.  \"Stand back! Give them plenty of room!\" exclaimed Professor Brice, and he took measures to clear the cadets away from the finishing line.  Quite a crowd had assembled to witness the contest, not only cadets, but also some folks from the neighboring town of Haven Point, and also a number of young ladies from Clearwater Hall, a seminary located some distance away.  The skaters had still a distance of several hundred yards to cover when it was seen that Spouter Powell was gradually falling behind. Then Jack Rover forged forward, followed by his Cousin Randy.  \"The Rovers are crawling up!\"  \"See, Jack Rover and his Cousin Randy and Dan Soppinger and Walt Baxter are all in a line!\"  \"This certainly is one close race!\"  The excitement increased as the racers drew closer to the finishing line. Walt Baxter was panting painfully, showing that he had used up almost every ounce of his strength.  \"Oh, dear! I do hope the Rovers come in ahead,\" whispered one girl skater to another. She was a tall girl, remarkably good looking and dressed in a suit of brown, with furs.  \"So do I hope the Rover boys win, Ruth,\" answered her girl companion, \"now that my Cousin Dick has fallen behind.\"  \"It's too bad, May, that your Cousin Dick couldn't have kept up,\" answered Ruth Stevenson.  Closer and closer to the finishing line crept the four leading skaters, Jack and Randy in the middle, with Dan Soppinger on their left and Walt Baxter on their right. Now Spouter Powell had fallen back to the second group of racers.  \"Here they come!\"  \"It's Dan Soppinger's race!\"  \"Not much! Here comes Walt Baxter! Gee, see him strike out!\"  \"It's the Rovers who are coming to the front!\" exclaimed Ned Lowe.  \"I knew they couldn't hold those Rover boys back,\" was Frank Newberry's comment. \"Now then, boys, for a final dash!\" he shouted.  All four of the leading contestants were bending forward and striking out as powerfully as possible, their arms swinging from side to side like pendulums and their skates ringing clearly on the smooth ice.  For an instant all were in a line, then, by a tremendous effort, Walter Baxter forged a foot ahead. But almost instantly Dan Soppinger overtook the other cadet. An instant later Randy Rover came up beside the others, followed by his Cousin Jack.  The finishing line was now less than fifty yards away, and the crowd was yelling all sorts of words of encouragement and cheering wildly, even the girls and older folks present being much excited. Then, of a sudden, an exclamation of wonder rent the air.  \"Look at that, will you? Did you ever see such striking out in your life?\"  \"He's coming forward like a cannon ball!\"  These exclamations had been brought forth by the sudden change of tactics on the part of Jack Rover. Coming back from the blasted pine he had managed to hang close to his opponents, but without using up all his reserve force. Now he let out \"for all he was worth,\" as he afterwards declared, and, with strokes that could hardly be seen for their rapidity, he forged in front of Soppinger and Baxter.  \"It's Jack Rover's race!\"  \"Look! Look! Here comes his Cousin Randy!\" yelled Ned Lowe.  \"No use in talking--you can't hold those Rover boys back,\" was Fatty Hendry's comment.  What the cadets had said was true. Following the extraordinary spurt made by Jack, Randy let himself out, and in a twinkling had passed Baxter. Then he found himself neck-and-neck with Dan Soppinger, who was struggling with might and main to catch up to Jack, just two feet ahead.  \"Make room for the winners!\"  \"Jack Rover wins the race!\"  \"Yes, and Randy Rover is second!\"  \"Who takes third place?\"  \"Soppinger, I guess.\"  \"No, I think Walt Baxter was a little ahead of him.\"  \"Nonsense! It was a tie between them.\"  \"Three cheers for the Rover boys!\" shouted Ned Lowe, and many cadets joined in the cheering.  Jack and Randy were quickly surrounded by many of their chums and congratulated on their success.  \"It was a tie race between Soppinger and Baxter,\" announced Professor Brice. \"And that being so, I will give each of them a third prize,\" and with this those two contestants had to be contented.  \"You made that race in record time, Jack,\" announced Gif Garrison. \"It is better time by twelve seconds than was ever made before on this lake.\"  \"Well, where do I come in?\" demanded Randy.  \"You broke the record by ten seconds,\" was the reply. \"And believe me, that's some stunt!\"  \"I guess I was beaten fairly,\" announced Dan Soppinger, a little ruefully; \"so there is no use of complaining.\"  \"Oh, it was a fair and square race sure enough,\" answered Walt Baxter. \"All the same, if my skates had been just a little sharper I think I might have won,\" he added a little wistfully.  \"Well, I am glad the honors stay in our family anyhow,\" announced Fred, as he skated up, followed by Andy.  \"And first and second prizes, too!\" cried his cousin. \"That ought to be enough to hold the other fellows for awhile.\"  Jack and Randy were both panting from their exertions, but their faces showed their satisfaction, and especially did Jack look his pleasure when he happened to glance beyond the crowd of cadets and saw Ruth Stevenson waving her hand toward him. Beside Ruth was May Powell, who waved gaily to all of the Rovers.  \"Fine race, boys! Fine race!\" was Fatty Hendry's comment. \"Just the same, none of you would have been in it for a minute if I had entered,\" and at this joke there was a general laugh.  \"Say, Fatty, you should have gone into it just to lose flesh,\" was Andy's dry comment. \"If you tried real hard, you might lose a pound a mile,\" and at this there was another laugh.  The crowd began to gather around Jack and Randy and the others who had won the race, and many wanted to shake hands with the oldest Rover boy. Even some of the town folks skated up, and they were followed by some of the girls from Clearwater Hall.  \"I say, boys, this may not be safe!\" cried Professor Brice suddenly, when the crowd on the ice had become unusually thick. \"This ice isn't as strong as it might be.\"  \"Yes, and with Fatty in the crowd----\" began Andy Rover. Then, of a sudden, he stopped short because an ominous crack was heard, followed by several other cracks.  \"The ice is breaking!\"  \"Skate away, everybody, or we'll go down!\"  Instantly there was a commotion, and all of the skaters tried to break away from the spot where the crowd had congregated. The confusion was tremendous, and in the mix-up six or eight persons, including Ruth Stevenson and May Powell, were thrown down. Then came another crack, and it looked as if in another instant the ice would give way completely and precipitate the whole crowd into the cold waters of the lake.     CHAPTER II  SOMETHING ABOUT THE ROVER BOYS   It was a time of extreme peril, and it is doubtful if any one realized that more than did Jack Rover. He, too, had been thrown down, and across his legs was sprawled the heavy form of Fatty Hendry. It was the toppling over of the fat youth which had caused one of the cracks which were now so numerous in the ice.  \"Hi! get off of me!\" yelled Jack, and managed to pull one of his legs free; and with this he pushed the fat youth to one side.  \"Help! help! We're going down!\" came in a scream from May Powell.  The ice had become depressed where she and Ruth Stevenson stood, and both were already in a half"]]]
