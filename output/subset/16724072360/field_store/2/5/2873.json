Dar he is, an' dar he'll lay. I'm done sick er war ef you call dis war--you hear me!\"  Harry said nothing, but I knew he was thinking of the fair Katherine, Jack's sister, and wondering if he would ever be to her what she was to him. He had his face in his hands, and appeared ready to give way to grief. General Forrest turned to an orderly: \"Go fetch Grissom here; tell him to come right away.\" The surgeon soon came, General Forrest told Whistling Jim to lead the way, and we were soon riding through the night in the direction of the river.     III   A fine mist was falling, and the night was so dark that we would never have found our way but for a small dog whose inhospitable bark directed us to the cabin. The dog was so disturbed by our approach that a woman opened the door to see what the trouble could be. We found Jack Bledsoe on a pallet, and saw at a glance that the woman had administered such remedies as common-sense and experience had taught her would allay the fever of a wound. He recognized us at once, and Harry could hardly keep back his tears when he saw his college chum lying helpless on the floor. He supported Jack's head while the surgeon was examining the wound.  \"You are here sooner than I thought,\" said Jack, gripping Harry's hand hard, \"but I knew you would--I knew it. And there is Carroll Shannon,\" he went on, holding out a hand to me. \"You never were very fond of me, Carroll, but I always liked you.\"  I hardly knew what to say, and therefore I said nothing. I could only take his hand in mine and give him a grip that would tell him more than words could tell. \"Don't worry, old fellow,\" Jack continued, observing the expression of grief and anxiety in Harry Herndon's countenance. \"It's all owing to the way the cards fall. Some day your turn may come, and then I hope I'll be able to go to you.\" His eyes were unnaturally bright, and his lips trembled with suppressed emotion.  The tension was relieved by the woman, who looked at both the young fellows, and then turned to the surgeon and asked almost unconcernedly, \"Ain't war a hell of a thing?\"  It was the surgeon who responded. \"It would be hard to find a better definition, ma'am.\"  \"I've saw lots wuss'n this,\" she remarked, as if she would thus find excuse for her sudden use of an expression that is rarely heard on the lips of a woman.  \"Why, yes, ma'am--a great deal worse. This is not a bad case at all. No great damage has been done. He will be lame for some weeks--perhaps for a longer time. The ball struck the bone, glanced, and is now close to the surface.\"  In a few moments he had deftly extracted it, and the wounded man seemed to be greatly relieved. Medicine, strange to say, had been declared a contraband of war by the Federals, and the surgeon could spare but a driblet of quinine from his small supply; but he left some, and gave various directions with respect to the possible symptoms that might arise.  Just then the woman's husband entered the door. He was an emaciated, unkempt man, whose movements were in strange contrast with his appearance. He was one of the most trustworthy of General Forrest's scouts, but neither betrayed the fact that he knew the other. On the contrary, the man was both angry and rude. \"What'd I tell you, Rhody?\" he exclaimed, turning to his wife. \"I know'd they'd crowd us out'n house an' home ef they got a chance; I could 'a' took oath to it! Cuss 'em, an' contrive 'em, both sides on 'em, all an' similar! They'd as lief make a hoss-stable out'n the house as not, an' I built it wi' my two han's.\"  \"An' what ef you did?\" inquired the woman with some show of spirit. \"Hit ain't sech a beauty that you kin brag on it. An' who made your two han's? You made 'em, I reckon, an' nobody else could 'a' done it.\"  The man made a gesture as though he could in that way weaken the force of the woman's words, and he evidently knew when to speak, for he said no more. On the contrary, sympathy shone in his eyes when he looked at the wounded man. \"Don't you worry, Bill; ef ther's any worryin' to be done, leave it to me. It takes a 'oman to know how to worry right; an' ever'thing oughter be done right.\"  \"Can you get a boat across the river?\" inquired General Forrest, turning to the man. He was somewhat doubtful until he caught the General's eye, and then he thought that nothing would be easier. \"Well,\" said the General, \"go across and tell the Yankees that there's a wounded officer at your house and that he needs attention. Tell 'em that General Forrest says they can get him whenever they send after him.\"  \"Is this General Forrest?\" inquired Jack Bledsoe. \"General, I hardly know how to thank you. I had just been dreaming of prison.\"  The General made a deprecatory gesture, and was on the point of saying something, when the man of the house spoke up. \"Ef you're Gener'l Forrest,\" he said, \"you'll be more than pleased to know that the Yankees ain't never took time for to cook supper. After they hit the furder bank they jest kep' on a-humpin', an' I don't blame 'em myself, bekaze 'twuz the only way wet men could keep warm.\"  \"It's up to you, Herndon; he's your prisoner. He ought to be in a hospital where he could be looked after, but I reckon he'll have to stay where he is for a while.\"  \"He won't put me out a mite ef he stays,\" said the woman. \"He'll be company fer me when Bill is pirootin' 'roun'.\"  General Forrest gave us permission to remain where we were for the night. \"We move at five,\" said he. \"Bill here will put you across and show you which way to go when he has found your horses for you.\" Just how Bill would do that was a mystery, but we asked no questions.  We called for Whistling Jim when General Forrest had gone, but he was nowhere to be found. He had shown us the way to the cabin and then disappeared. I judged that he was afraid Jack Bledsoe would upbraid him or that Harry would give him a scolding; but, whatever his reasons, he disappeared when we went in the cabin, and we saw him no more till the next morning.  Harry and Jack talked of old times until the woman was compelled to warn the wounded man that it would be worse for him if he excited himself. But he talked away in spite of the warning. He talked of his sister Katherine, much to Harry's delight, and told of his own sweetheart in Missouri. His colonel, he said, was very fond of Katherine, but he declared that Kate still thought of Harry, whereupon the young fellow blushed and looked as silly as a school-girl.  Tom Ryder was the Colonel's name, and he had a sister Lucy. Miss Lucy was Jack's choice out of a thousand, he said. The main trouble with Jack was that his sweetheart's sister, Jane Ryder, didn't like him--and so forth and so on, till I nodded where I sat, and dreamed of Katherine and Jane and Lucy Ryder, until someone took me by the arm and told me that it was time to be up and going.  We delayed our departure on one excuse and another, until finally Bill, who was to be our guide, grew irritable; and even then we made a further delay while Jack pencilled a note to his colonel, which Harry was to take charge of as long as there was danger of his capture by roving bands of Federals, and then it was to be given to the guide, who thought he could insure its delivery.  When we were ready, and could invent no further excuse, Harry turned to Jack. \"The war doesn't touch us, dear boy. Good-by, and don't fail to put in a good word for me when you go home.\"  Jack Bledsoe's face brightened up. \"That's so!\" he exclaimed; \"I can go home now. Well, you may depend on me, Harry; but the two Miss Ryders are all the other way, and I'll be between two fires. Tell Whistling Jim I have no hard feelings. He has really done me a favor, if things turn out no worse than they are.\"  We bade our friend good-by again and went out into the damp morning air, each with his various thoughts. I congratulated myself that mine had little to do with the troublesome sex. The fog, hanging heavily over the river, shut out the sunlight. We had to take the guide's word for that, for we could see no sign of the sun. Indeed, it was so dark that we had considerable difficulty in making our way. But when we were on the other side, and had mounted the somewhat steep bank, the fog disappeared and the sun shone out; and not far away we saw Whistling Jim and the horses.  He hailed our coming with delight, for he had been waiting some time, and he was both cold and frightened. He took off his hat, as he said, to old King Sun, and he seemed to feel all the better for it; and we all felt better when our horses were between our knees. Even the horses felt better, for they whinnied as we mounted, and were for going at a more rapid gait than was necessary.  We entered the scrub timber and went through it for half a mile or more, and then suddenly came out on the public highway. The guide suggested that we smarten up our gait, and we put the horses to a canter. I thought surely that the man would give out, but he merely caught hold of my stirrup to help him along, and when we came to a cross-road, and halted at his suggestion, he showed as little fatigue as the horses--this man who seemed too frail to walk a mile.  Here he gave us such instructions as seemed necessary, and was just about to so-long us, as he said, when he paused with his hand to his ear. \"I'll be whopped,\" he exclaimed, \"ef I don't hear buggy-wheels, an' they're comin' right this way.\" With that he slipped into the bushes, and, though I knew where he was concealed, it was impossible to catch a glimpse of him.  There was a bend in the road about a quarter of a mile ahead of us, and we waited expectantly, while Whistling Jim, with a cunning for which I did not give him credit, pretended to be fixing his saddle-girth. As we waited a top-buggy rounded the bend in the road and came bowling toward us. It was surprising to see a buggy, but I was more"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23874"],["title","No Man's Land (#1)"],["body","The French officer in charge was polite, but firmly non-committal.  \"There is a train which will leave here about midnight, we hope.  If you can get a seat on it--well and good.  If not----\" he shrugged his shoulders superbly, and the conversation closed.  It was a troop train apparently, and in the course of time it would arrive at Marseilles--perhaps.  It would not be comfortable.  \"Mais, que voulez-vous, M'sieur? c'est la guerre.\"  At first he had not been genial; but when he had grasped the fact that mufti invariably cloaked the British officer, _en permission_, he had become more friendly.  He advised dinner; in these days, as he truly remarked, one never knows.  Also, what was England going to do?  \"Fight,\" Draycott answered promptly, with an assurance he did not feel. \"Fight, mon Colonel; ça va sans dire.\"  \"C'est bien,\" he murmured, and stood up.  \"Vive l'Angleterre.\"  Gravely he saluted, and Draycott took off his hat.  \"Mon Colonel, vive la France.\"  They shook hands; and having once again solemnly saluted one another, he took the Frenchman's advice and went in search of dinner.  In the restaurant itself everything seemed normal.  To the close observer there was possibly an undue proportion of women who did not eat, but who watched with hungry, loving eyes the men who were with them.  Now and again one would look round, and in her face was the pitiful look of the hunted animal; then _he_ would speak, and with a smile on her lips and a jest on her tongue she would cover a heart that seemed like to burst with the agony of it.  Inexorably the clock moved on: the finger of fate that was to take him from her.  They had quarrelled, _sans doute_--who has not? there had been days when they had not spoken.  He had not been to her all that he might have been, but . . .  But--he was her man.  And now he was going; in half an hour her Pierre was going to leave her.  For him the bustle and glamour of the unknown; for her--the empty chair, the lonely house, and her thoughts.  Dear God! but war is a bad thing for the women who stop behind. . . .  And on Draycott's brain a tableau is stamped indelibly, just a little tableau he saw that night in the restaurant of the Gare de Lyon.  They came, the three of them, up the flight of steps from the seething station below, into the peace and quiet of the room, and a roar of sound swept in with them as the doors swung open.  Threading their way between the tables, they stopped just opposite to where he sat, and instinctively he turned his head away.  For her the half-hour was over, her Pierre had gone; and it is not given to a man to look on a woman's grief save with a catching in the throat and a pricking in the eyes. It is so utterly terrible in its overwhelming agony at the moment, so absolutely final; one feels so helpless.  The little boy clambered on to a chair and sat watching his mother gravely; a grey-haired woman with anxious eyes held one of her hands clasped tight.  And the girl--she was just a girl, that's all--sat dry-eyed and rigid, staring, staring, while every now and then she seemed to whisper something through lips that hardly moved.  \"Maman,\" a childish voice piped out.  \"Maman.\"  He solemnly extended a small and grubby hand towards her.  Slowly her head came round, her eyes took him in--almost uncomprehendingly; she saw the childish face, the little dirty hand, and suddenly there came to her the great gift of the Healer.  \"Oh! mon bébé, mon pauv' p'tit bébé!\"  She picked him up off the chair and, clutching him in her arms, put her face on his head and sobbed out her heart.  \"Come on.\"  Draycott got up suddenly and turned to the man he was dining with.  \"Let's go.\"  They passed close to the table, and the fat waiter, wiping his eyes on a dinner napkin, and the grey-haired woman leaning gently over her, were talking in low tones.  They seemed satisfied as they watched the sobbing girl; and they were people of understanding.  \"Pauvre petite,\" muttered the waiter as they passed. \"Mon Dieu! quelle vâche de guerre.\"  \"My God!\" said Draycott, as they went down the steps.  \"I didn't realise before what war meant to a woman.  And we shall never realise what it means to our own women.  We only see them before we go.  Never after.\"   IV  Half an hour later he encountered Monsieur le Colonel once again, and suggested that they should split a bottle of wine together if he could spare the time.  It was then nine o'clock, and the three hours till midnight loomed uninviting.  His only hope, as he told him, was that the train at present standing at the platform was not going to be typical of the one he was to embark on.  It seemed to be of endless length, and presented a most enticing spectacle.  Four fortunates in each compartment had got the racks, otherwise the passengers stood: on the footboards, in the corridors, on the seats.  If any one opened a door the pressure was such that at least six people fell on to the platform, and in one carriage a small _poilu_ was being squeezed through the open window.  In the end he went--suddenly like a cork out of a bottle, and the human mass closed up behind him.  Draycott laughed, the Colonel laughed, and went on laughing.  He laughed unrestrainedly, even as a man who enjoys a secret jest.  At last, with some difficulty, he controlled his mirth.  \"Monsieur,\" he remarked gravely, but with twinkling eyes, \"I fear your hopes are ill-founded.  This is the midnight train.\"  \"Under those circumstances,\" Draycott murmured, with a ghastly attempt at mirth, \"the wine is off.  I must go and secure my sleeping-berth.\"  Have you ever seen a fly-paper which has come \"to the end of a perfect day\"?  Lumps of glutinous flies drop off on one's head, and still it seems as full as ever.  It was the same with that train.  Lumps of Frenchmen, permanently welded together, fell out periodically, unstuck themselves, and departed, only to return in a few moments with the long thin loaves of France and bottles of wine.  Sometimes they got in again, sometimes they didn't--but they were happy, those poilus.  What matter anything, bar killing the Boche?  And that was the only thing in the air that night. . . .  In every carriage it was the same, until suddenly there came salvation. A horse-box, with two horses in it and some grooms singing the Marseillaise, loomed out of the darkness, and into it the fed-up wanderer hurled his bag.  Yet again did he embrace every one, including the horses; and then, overcome with his labours, he sank into a corner and laughed.  And it was only when they had been under way for two hours that he remembered his two other bags, sitting alone and forlorn at the Gare de Lyon. . . .  It was a great journey that.  The heat was sweltering, and they stopped at every station between Paris and Marseilles--generally twice, because the train was too long for the platform.  And at every station the same programme was repeated.  Completely regardless of the infuriated whistles and toots of the French conductors, absolutely unmindful of the agonised shouts of \"En voiture, en voiture!  Montez, messieurs, le train part,\" the human freight unloaded itself and made merry.  As far as they were concerned, let the train \"part.\"  It never did, and the immediate necessity was the inner man.  But it was all very nerve-racking.  At times there were forty Frenchmen in the truck, at others none. Whether they fell off or were pushed Draycott knew not: they simply occurred--periodically.  One man disappeared for five hours, and then came back again; possibly he was walking to stretch his legs; there was plenty of time.  But to those who travel in trains de luxe, let me recommend a journey in a cattle-truck, where, if one is lucky, one gets a front seat, and sits on the floor with legs dangling over the side; a bottle of wine in one hand, a loaf of bread in the other, and a song when the spirit is in one.  No breathless rushing through space: just a gentle amble through the ripening corn, with the poppies glinting red and the purple mountains in the distance; with a three days' growth on one's chin and an amalgamation of engine soots and dust on one's face that would give a dust storm off the desert points and a beating.  That is the way to travel, even if the journey lasts from Sunday night to Tuesday evening, and a horse occasionally stamps on your face.  And even so did Clive Draycott, Captain of \"Feet,\" go to the great war. . . .   V  Marseilles has always been a town of mystery--the gateway of the East. Going from it one leaves European civilisation--if such a thing can be said to exist to-day--and steps into the unknown.  Coming to it through that appalling Gulf of Lyons, beside which the dreaded Bay of Biscay seems like the proverbial duck-pond, Notre Dame de la Garde holds out a welcoming hand, and breathes of fast trains and restaurant cars, and London.  It is the town of tongues, the city of nations.  It is not French; it is universal.  And never can Marseilles have been so universal as in the early days of August 1914.  Usually a port of call only, then it was a terminus.  The ships came in, but did not leave: there seemed to be a concensus of opinion amongst skippers that the _Goeben_ was a nasty thing to meet alone on a dark night.  And so the overcrowded docks filled up with waiting vessels, while Lascars and Levantine Greeks, Cingalese and Chinamen, jostled one another in the cafés.  The other jostlers were principally Americans of fabulous wealth: at least as they thronged the shipping offices they said so.  Also they were very angry, which is where they differed from the Cingalese and Chinamen, who liked Marseilles and prayed to remain for ever.  But the Americans desired to return to God's own country--they and their wives and their sons and daughters; moreover, they expressed their desire fluently and frequently.  There is something stupendous about an American magnate insisting on his rights on a hot day, when he can't get them. . . "]]]
