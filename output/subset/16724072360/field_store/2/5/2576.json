Achilles, who looked good-natured, as most big men are, addressed the boys.  \"Well, boys, are you coming to see the show?\"  \"Yes,\" answered both.  \"I used to like to myself when I was a boy. I didn't expect then I should ever travel with one.\"  \"Were you very large as a boy?\" asked Dan, with curiosity.  \"When I was twelve years old I was six feet high, and people generally thought then that I was eighteen. I thought perhaps I shouldn't grow any more, but I kept on. When I was sixteen I was seven feet tall, and by twenty I had reached my present height.\"  \"Are you eight feet three inches tall, Mr. Henderson?\"  \"Is that what the bills say?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Then it must be so,\" he said with a smile.  \"How long have you been traveling with the circus?\"  \"Five years.\"  \"How do you like it?\"  \"It's a good deal easier than working on a farm, especially in Vermont, where I was born and bred.\"  \"But they call you the Scotch giant.\"  \"It sounds well, doesn't it? My father was born in Scotland, but my mother was a Vermont Yankee. You know Americans are more willing to pay for a foreign curiosity than for one home born. That's why my _great_ friend here\"--emphasizing the word great--\"calls herself Madame Celestina Morella.\"  The fat lady smiled.  \"People think I am French or Italian,\" she said, \"but I never was out of the United States in my life.\"  \"Where were you born, Madame Morella?\"  \"In the western part of New York State. I know what you are going to ask me. Was I always fat? No, when I was sixteen I only weighed one hundred and twenty. Then I had a fit of sickness and nearly died. After recovering, I began to gain flesh, till I became a monster, as you see.\"  As she said this, she laughed, and her fat sides shook with merriment. Evidently she did not let her size weigh upon her mind.  \"I suppose your real name isn't Celestina Morella?\" said Kit.  \"My real name is Betsey Hatch. That is what they called me in my girlhood, but I should hardly know who was meant if I was called so now.\"  \"Have you been long in the show business?\"  \"About seven years.\"  \"Do you like it?\"  \"I didn't at first, but now I've got used to moving about. Now when the spring opens I have the regular circus fever. But I have my troubles.\"  \"What are they?\" asked Kit, seeing that the fat woman liked to talk.  \"Well, I find it very difficult to secure at the hotels a bed large enough and strong enough to hold me. I suppose you won't be surprised to hear that.\"  \"Not much.\"  \"At Akron, Ohio, where the hotel was full, I was put in a cot bed, though I protested against it. As soon as I got in, the whole thing collapsed, and I was landed on the floor.\"  She laughed heartily at the remembrance.  \"I remember that very well,\" said the giant, \"for I slept in the room below. Half an hour after getting into bed, I heard a fearful noise in the room above, and thought at first the hotel had been struck by lightning, and a piercing shriek that echoed through the house led me to fear that my esteemed Italian friend was a victim. But my mind was soon relieved when I learned the truth.\"  \"I suppose, major, you never broke down a bed,\" said the giant, turning to the dwarf.  \"No,\" answered the major, in a shrill piping voice, \"I never lie awake thinking of that.\"  \"I believe you served in the civil war, major?\"  \"Yes, I was in the infantry.\"  It was a stale joke, but all four laughed at it.  \"How much do you weigh, major?\" Kit ventured to ask.  \"Twenty-one pounds and a half,\" answered the dwarf. \"I have with me some of my photographs, if you would like to buy,\" and the little man produced half a dozen cards from his tiny pocket.  \"How much are they?\"  \"Ten cents.\"  \"I'll take one,\" said Kit, and he produced the necessary coin.  \"If you go into the tent you can see some of the performers rehearsing,\" suggested Achilles.  \"Let us go in, Dan.\"  The two boys reached the portals and went into the big tent.     CHAPTER III.  KIT ASTONISHES TWO ACROBATS.   The circus tent was nearly ready for the regular performance. Kit and Dan regarded the sawdust arena with the interest which it always inspires in boys of sixteen. Already it was invested with fascination for them. Two acrobats who performed what is called the \"brothers' act\" were rehearsing. They were placarded as the Vincenti brothers, though one was a French Canadian and the other an Irishman, and there was no relationship between them. At the time the boys entered, one had climbed upon the other's shoulders, and was standing erect with folded arms. This was, of course, easy, but the next act was more difficult. By a quick movement he lowered his head, and grasping the uplifted hands of the lower acrobat, raised his feet and poised himself aloft, with his feet up in the air, sustained by the muscular arms of his associate.  \"That must take strength, Kit,\" said Dan.  \"So it does.\"  \"No one but a circus man could do it, I suppose?\"  \"I can do it,\" said Kit quietly.  Dan regarded him with undisguised astonishment.  \"You are joking,\" he said.  \"No, I am not.\"  \"Where did you learn to do such a thing?\" asked Dan, incredulous, though he knew Kit to be a boy of truth.  \"I will tell you. In the town where I attended boarding school there is a large gymnasium, under the superintendence of a man who traveled for years with a circus. He used to give lessons to the boys, but most contented themselves with a few common exercises. I suppose I should also, but there was an English boy in the school, very supple and muscular, who was proud of his strength, and ambitious to make himself a thorough gymnast. He persuaded me to take lessons in the most difficult acrobatic feats with him, as two had to work together.\"  \"Did you pay the professor extra to instruct you?\" asked Dan.  \"He charged nothing. He was only too glad to teach us all he knew. It seems he was at one time connected with Barnum's circus, and prepared performers for the arena. He told us it made him think of his old circus days to teach us. At the close of last term we gave him five dollars apiece as an acknowledgment of his services. He assured us then that we were competent to perform in any circus.\"  \"Could you really do what the Vincenti brothers are doing?\"  \"Yes; and more.\"  \"I wish I could see you do it.\"  The boys were seated near the sawdust arena, and the last part of their conversation had been heard by the acrobats. It was taken as an illustration of boyish braggadocio, and as circus men are always ready for practical jokes, particularly at the expense of greenhorns, they resolved that there was a good chance for a little fun.  One tipped the wink to the other, and turning to Kit, said: \"What's that you're saying, kid?\"  \"How does he know your name?\" said Dan, mistaking kid, the circus name for boy, for his friend's nickname.  \"He said kid, not Kit,\" answered our hero.  \"Do you think you can do our act?\" continued the acrobat.  \"I think I can,\" replied Kit.  This elicited a broad grin from the acrobat.  \"Look here, kid,\" he said, \"do you know how long it took me to learn the business?\"  \"I don't know, but I should like to know.\"  \"Three years.\"  \"No doubt you can do a great deal more than I.\"  \"Oh, no, certainly not!\" said the acrobat, ironically.  \"I see you don't believe me,\" said Kit.  \"I'll tell you what you remind me of, kid. There was a fellow came to our circus last summer, and wanted to get an engagement as rider. He said he'd been a cowboy out in New Mexico, and had been employed to break horses. So we gave the fellow a trial. We brought out a wild mustang, and told him to show what he could do. The mustang let him get on, as was his custom, but after he was fairly on, he gave a jump, and Mr. Cowboy measured his length on the sawdust.\"  Kit and Dan both smiled at this story.  \"I am not a cowboy, and don't profess to ride bucking mustangs,\" he said, \"though my friend Dan may.\"  \"I'd rather be excused,\" put in Dan.  \"I'll tell you what, kid, if you'll go through the performance you've just seen I'll give you five dollars.\"  The fellow expected Kit would make some hasty excuse, but he was mistaken. Our hero rose from his seat, removed his coat and vest, and bounded into the arena.  \"I am ready,\" he said, \"but I am not strong enough to be the under man. I'll do the other.\"  \"All right! Go ahead!\"  The speaker put himself in position. Kit gave a spring, and in an instant was upon his shoulders.  There was an exclamation of surprise from the second acrobat.  \"Christopher!\" he exclaimed. \"The boy's got something in him, after all.\"  \"Now what shall I do?\" asked Kit, as with folded arms he stood on the acrobat's shoulders.  \"Keep your place while I walk round the arena.\"  Kit maintained his position while the acrobat ran round the circle, increasing his pace on purpose to dislodge his young associate. But Kit was too well used to this act to be embarrassed. He held himself erect, and never swerved for an instant.  \"Pretty good, kid!\" said the acrobat. \"Now reverse yourself and stand on my hands with your feet in the air.\"  Kit made the change skillfully, and to the equal surprise of Dan and the other acrobat, both of whom applauded without stint.  \"Can you do anything else?\" asked Alonzo Vincenti.  \"Yes.\"  Kit went through a variety of other feats, and then descending from his elevated perch, was about to resume his coat and vest, when the circus performer asked him, \"Can you tumble?\"  Kit's answer was to roll over the arena in a succession of somersaults and hand springs.  \"Well, I'm beat!\" said the acrobat. \"You're the smartest kid I ever met in my travels. Are you sure you're not a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22521"],["title","The Young Acrobat of the Great North American Circus (#2)"],["body","al?\"  \"Quite sure,\" answered Kit, smiling.  \"You never traveled with a show, then?\"  Kit shook his head.  \"Where on earth did you pick up all these acts?\"  \"I took lessons of Professor Donaldson.\"  \"You did! Well, that explains it. I say, kid, you ought to join a circus. You'd command a fine salary.\"  \"Would I? How much could I get?\" asked Kit, with interest.  \"Ten or twelve dollars a week and all expenses paid. That's pretty good pay for a kid, isn't it?\"  \"It's more than I ever earned yet,\" answered Kit, with a smile.  \"I shouldn't wonder if Mr. Barlow would give you that now. If you ever make up your mind to join a show, come round and see him.\"  \"Thank you,\" said Kit.  Soon after the boys left the circus lot and went home.  \"Would you really join a circus, Kit?\" asked Dan.  \"It isn't the life I would choose,\" answered Kit, seriously, \"but I may have to find some way of earning a living, and that very soon.\"  \"I thought your father left you a fortune.\"  \"So did I; but I hear that I am to be taken from boarding school, and possibly set to work. Ralph has given me a hint of it. I shall soon know, as my uncle intimates that he has a communication to make me.\"  \"I hope it isn't as bad as you think, Kit.\"  \"I hope so too, but I can tell you better to-morrow. We will meet to-night at the show.\"     CHAPTER IV.  A SCENE NOT DOWN ON THE BILLS.   Just before supper Kit was asked to an interview with his uncle.  \"You wish to speak to me, Uncle Stephen?\" he said.  \"Yes; I have decided not to postpone the explanation for which you asked yesterday.\"  \"I shall be glad to hear it, sir.\"  \"Ever since your father's death I have supported you, not because I was morally or legally bound to do so, but because you were my nephew.\"  \"But didn't my father leave any property?\" asked Kit in amazement.  \"He was supposed to have done so.\"  \"This house and grounds are surely worth a good deal of money!\"  \"So they are,\" answered Stephen Watson, dryly, \"but unfortunately they did not belong to your father.\"  \"This is certainly a mistake,\" exclaimed Kit, indignantly.  \"Wait till I have finished. These stood in your father's name, but there was a mortgage of two thousand dollars held by the Smyrna Savings Bank.\"  \"Surely the place is worth far more than two thousand dollars!\"  \"Curb your impatience, and you will soon understand me. The place _is_ worth far more than two thousand dollars. I consider it worth ten thousand.\"  \"Then I don't see----\"  \"Your father left large debts, which of course had to be paid. I was therefore obliged to sell the estate, in order to realize the necessary funds.\"  \"For how much did you sell the place?\"  \"For nine thousand dollars. I regarded that as a good price, considering that it was paid in cash or the equivalent.\"  \"To whom did you sell?\"  \"I bought it in myself; I was not willing that the place which my brother had loved so well, should pass into the hands of strangers.\"  \"May I ask who was my father's principal creditor?\" asked Kit.  \"Ahem! I was,\" answered Stephen Watson, in a tone of slight embarrassment.  \"You!\" exclaimed Kit, in fresh surprise.  \"Yes; your father owed me twelve thousand dollars borrowed at various times.\"  \"How could he have been obliged to borrow so much?\" asked Kit. \"He always seemed comfortably situated. I never once heard him complain of being pressed for money.\"  \"Very likely; he was very reticent about his affairs. I would explain, but the matter is rather a delicate one.\"  \"I think I am entitled to know all about it, Uncle Stephen,\" said Kit, firmly.  \"Be it so! Perhaps you are right. Let me tell you in the briefest terms, then, that in his later years your father speculated in Wall Street--not heavily, for he had not the means, but heavily for one of his property. Of course he lost. Almost every one does, who ventures into the 'street.' His first losses, instead of deterring him from further speculation, led him on to rasher ventures. It was then that he came to me for money.\"  \"Didn't you urge him to give up speculating?\" asked Kit.  \"Yes, but my words availed little. Perhaps you will think I ought to have refused him loans, but he assured me in the strongest terms that unless he obtained money from some source he would be ruined, and I yielded. I might have been weak--it was weak, for I stood a chance of losing all, having merely his notes of hand to show for the money I lent. But it is hard to refuse a brother. I think I should do the same again.\"  Kit was silent. His uncle's words were warm, and indicated strong sympathy for Kit's father, but his tone was cold, and there seemed a lack of earnestness. Kit could not repress a feeling of incredulity. There was another obstacle to his accepting with full credence the tale which his uncle told him. He had always understood from his father that his uncle was a poor and struggling man. How could he have in his possession the sum of twelve thousand dollars to lend his brother? This question was certainly difficult to answer. He paused, then refraining from discussing the subject, said:  \"Why have you not told me this before, Uncle Stephen?\"  \"Would it have made you any happier?\" returned Stephen Watson.  \"No.\"  \"Till you had acquired a fair education, I thought it better to keep the unpleasant truth from you. It would only have annoyed you to feel that you owed everything to my generosity, and were in fact a child of charity.\"  Kit's face flushed deeply as he heard this expression from his uncle's lips.  \"Do you mean that my father left absolutely nothing?\" he asked.  \"Yes, absolutely nothing. Well, no, not quite that. I think there was a balance of a little over a hundred dollars left after paying all debts. That is hardly worth counting.\"  \"Yes, that is hardly worth counting,\" said Kit in a dull, mechanical tone.  \"Still, I determined to educate you, and give you equal advantages with my own son. I have done so up to the present moment. I wish I could continue to do so, but Ralph is getting more expensive as he grows older (and you also), and I cannot afford to keep you both at school. You will therefore stop studying, and I shall secure you some work.\"  \"If things are as you say, I cannot complain of this,\" Kit said in a dull, spiritless tone, \"but it comes upon me like a thunderbolt.\"  \"No doubt, no doubt. I knew it would be a shock, and I have postponed telling you as long as possible.\"  \"I suppose I ought to thank you. Have you anything more to say to me now?\"  \"No.\"  \"Then, sir, I will leave you. I will ask further particulars some other day.\"  \"He takes it hard,\" muttered Stephen Watson, eyeing the retreating form of his nephew thoughtfully. \"I wonder if he will suspect that there is anything wrong. Even if he does, he is only a boy, and can prove nothing.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"What makes you so glum, Kit?\" asked Dan Clark, when they met at seven o'clock, as agreed, to go together to the show.  \"Not much, Dan, only I have learned that I am a pauper.\"  \"But the estate--the house and the grounds?\" said Dan, bewildered.  \"Belong to my uncle.\"  \"Who says so?\"  \"He says so. But I don't want to say any more about it now. Let us start for the circus, and I will try to forget my pauper position, for one evening at least.\"  Before they reached the lot, they heard the circus band discoursing lively music. They were in a crowd, for all Smyrna, men, women and children, were bound for the show. It was a grand gala night. In the city, where there are many amusements, the circus draws well, but in the country everybody goes.  Outside the great tent were the side shows. In one of them Kit found his friends of the morning, the giant, the dwarf, and the fat lady, with other curiosities hereafter to be mentioned. Just inside the tent, in what might be called the ante chamber, was the collection of animals. The elephants were accorded more freedom than the rest, but the lion, tiger, and leopard were shut up in cages. The lion seemed particularly restless. He was pacing his narrow quarters, lashing his tail, and from time to time emitting deep growls, betokening irritation and anger.  \"How would you like to go into the cage?\" asked Dan.  \"I don't care for an interview with his majesty,\" responded Kit.  A stranger was standing near the cage.  \"Don't go too near, boys!\" he said. \"That lion is particularly fierce. He nearly killed a man last season in Pennsylvania.\"  \"How was that?\"  \"The man ventured too near the cage. The lion stretched out his claws, and fastened them in the man's shoulder, lacerating it fearfully before he could be released. He came near dying of blood poisoning.\"  Kit and Dan sheered off. The lion looked wicked enough to kill a dozen men.  At eight o'clock the performance commenced. First there was a procession of elephants and horses, the latter carrying the bareback riders and other members of the circus, with the curiosities and freaks. Then came two bareback riders, who jumped through hoops, and over banners, and performed somersaults, to the wondering delight of the boys. Then came tumblers, and in preparation for another scene a gaudily dressed clown entered the ring. Suddenly there was heard a deep baying sound, which struck terror into every heart. It was the lion; but seemed close at hand. In an instant a dark, cat-like form, rushing down the aisle, sprang into the ring.  The great Numidian lion had broken from his cage, and the life of every one in the audience was in peril. Ladies shrieked, strong men grew pale, and all wildly looked about for some way of escape.  Striking down the clown, and standing with one foot on the prostrate form, the lion's cruel eyes wandered slowly over the vast assemblage.  Only ten feet from him, in front seats, sat Kit and Dan.  Kit rose in his seat pale and excited, but with a resolute fire in his eyes. He had thought of a way to vanquish the lion.     CHAPTER V.  HOW KIT VANQUISHED THE LION.   The danger was imminent.
