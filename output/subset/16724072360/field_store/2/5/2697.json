Harry's hand trembled a trifle in spite of his effort at self-control.  His first effort was unsuccessful.  \"Careful, Harry,\" admonished Ned.  \"Better strike it on your shoe sole. That makes a better match scratcher than your trousers.\"  \"Correct!\" observed Jack.  \"And go easy,\" he added.  \"We have only two, you know.  If anything should happen, you understand--\"  \"Yes, I know,\" answered Harry.  \"That's why I'm trying to be extra careful.  I'm just as anxious for a light as you are.\"  \"The rats are coming closer,\" observed Jack, a slight quaver perceptible in his voice.  \"I don't want them to start anything.\"  \"All right now, Harry; lean on me a bit to balance yourself,\" urged Ned.  \"Make sure this time, and get it in your cupped hands.\"  \"Here goes!\" announced Harry, lifting one foot and striking the match upon the sole of his shoe.  \"Here comes the light!\"  But, contrary to expectations, the light did not come, although the lad tried again and again.  \"Try the other match, Harry; maybe this one got wet somehow and won't work,\" suggested Jack, stepping closer.  \"I have tried them both,\" declared Harry in a faint voice.  \"What's the matter, then?\" demanded Jack excitedly.  \"I guess they are those safety matches that will light only on the box,\" was Harry's explanation.  \"I haven't the box, either,\" he added in a voice scarcely above a whisper.  \"It's no go, boys!\"  \"Look through all your pockets,\" directed Ned, \"and see if there isn't a scrap of box left by oversight.  We must have a light!\"  Frantically the three boys searched their pockets, but could discover no shred or vestige of a box on which to strike the impregnated safety matches held by Harry.  At length they gave up the effort.  \"That's peculiar!\" declared Jack with emphasis.  \"Just think of all the matches used every day in the United States by thousands and thousands of people who never think of saving them.  We have used a whole lot of matches ourselves needlessly, and now we want just one as badly as we ever wanted anything.  It's fierce!\"  \"It surely is fierce,\" agreed Ned, \"but we'll have to make the best of it.  It seems peculiar, too,\" he went on, \"that the rats haven't begun anything.  They seem to be all about us.\"  \"Yes, but they are not moving about very fast,\" observed Harry.  \"Maybe they 're afraid of us yet.  Let's make a noise and scare them.\"  \"How shall we do it?\" asked Jack.  \"What will you make a noise with if you haven't anything to use?  Tell me that!\"  \"Stamp on the floor good and hard; that'll scare them.\"  \"All right; here goes!\" agreed Jack, suiting the action to the word.  All three boys were startled at the result of Jack's stamping.  A crackling sound was heard, followed by a tiny spurt of flame from the floor under his foot.  \"Easy there, easy!\" cried Harry, dropping to his knees.  \"That's just what we wanted.  Don't move now, but give me those shavings!\"  With trembling hands the lad took the shavings from Jack's hand. Carefully shielding the tiny flame from possible draughts of air, the boy held the point of one of the thin pieces of wood over the flare. In a moment it had caught fire.  Licking up the curl, the flame gradually leaped from one piece of wood to another until the entire handful was ablaze.  The dancing light played upon the three faces and sent a glow out into the surrounding blackness.  Harry deposited the burning shavings upon the floor, where the fire was soon transmitted to the larger piece of wood Jack had used in whittling.  As the boys saw that the matter of fire was assured, they glanced first at each other, then let their gaze wander about the apartment.  \"Goodness, the rats don't seem to be much afraid of fire!\" exclaimed Jack, pointing toward a horde of rodents swarming about the place.  \"What's that on them?\" asked Harry wonderingly.  \"I declare it's red!\" exclaimed Ned.  \"It looks like blood!\"  \"Where'd they get blood from, I'd like to know!\" protested Harry.  \"There's only one answer to that just now, with all the dead and wounded soldiers about,\" answered Ned, shaking his head.  \"It's awful!\"  \"Let's get out of here as quick as we can,\" urged Jack.  \"Come on.\"  With one accord the lads turned from the swarm of rats.  \"Where are you going?\" demanded a strange voice from the darkness.  \"Who are you?\" asked Ned, startled by the sudden question.  \"Maybe I'm a friend,\" was the answer.  \"Yes, I guess I am.\"     CHAPTER III  OUT OF THE FLAMES  When the soldier who had been holding his rifle at Jimmie's back lowered the weapon and the ceremony of administering the oath of allegiance to the Kaiser had been completed, the red-headed Boy Scout who had been masquerading under a Cossack uniform breathed a deep sigh of relief that but faintly expressed his sentiments.  In spite of the seriousness of the situation, Jimmie maintained a mental reservation that little less than contradicted his words so recently spoken.  He felt that it would be only policy to obey the orders of those in superior force, since he could see no advantage to be gained by a flat refusal.  His thoughts rapidly compassed the situation, and he recognized the fact that the invading horde of Germans were in no mood to consider dispassionately the matter of a boy more or less who was found under the circumstances in which they had discovered Jimmie.  Reluctantly, therefore, but because he thought it by far the better plan, the lad had submitted to the course insisted upon.  During all the time that he had been repeating the words after the officer the boy had been mentally conjecturing a means of escape whereby he might rejoin his chums and be fairly sure of the escape of the entire party from the hands of the army that had so recently captured Peremysl and who were now engaged in bringing order out of the apparent chaos that reigned.  Not until the searching party returned and reported to the Captain their unsuccessful quest after his three comrades did Jimmie realize that an effort was being made to apprehend them.  Then he began to believe that it was not the intention of the German Captain to allow the boys to leave the country.  The thought was a very disquieting one.  In entertaining it, Jimmie felt himself fully justified in taking any possible course of escape.  \"Well, my lad,\" began the Captain, addressing Jimmie in a not unkindly tone, the while his blue eyes regarded the lad with an amused glance, \"now that you are a full-fledged Uhlan and your comrades are on their way home, you will be fitted out with a new uniform by the proper department.  See that you select a good strong one, for we have plenty of rough work ahead of us.  Yes?\"  \"Very good, sir!\" replied Jimmie with outward politeness, although his heart was filled with rage at the thought of donning the German uniform.  \"I shall try to do well whatever I undertake.\"  \"Spoken like a man!\" declared the officer with a short laugh.  A brief order spoken in the German language to an orderly nearby resulted in that individual signing to Jimmie.  Obediently the lad followed his new guide.  Past groups of soldiers who were, by their fair hair, round cheeks, blue eyes and general stocky build, members of the German army, the boy and his conductor took their way.  Not far down the street they came upon several wagons in charge of a commissioned officer, before whom the guide stopped with a very formal salute.  After receiving a recognition of his salute the guide explained his errand.  A laughing response greeted his explanation of circumstances.  The officer called one of his aides, and the work of outfitting the erstwhile Cossack began.  Jimmie discovered that the wagons were veritable stores on wheels, and was greatly surprised at the neatness and order with which the large assortment of goods were disposed.  No difficulty was experienced in securing clothing of the proper dimensions, and Jimmie soon stood forth to all external appearances as loyal and brave a Uhlan as ever followed the banner of the Emperor or stuck a lance into a dummy at riding exercise.  He could not restrain a laugh at the peculiar round cap that was fitted to his head.  \"Now I'm hungry!\" he declared as he surveyed himself in his new regalia.  \"Where's the eats?\" he asked of the guide.  A stare from a pair of pale blue eyes was the only response.  \"I say,\" began Jimmie in a louder tone, \"I haven't had anything to eat for a long time.  I'm hungry!\" he finished in a shout.  Another stare and a nod of the head greeted this outburst.  \"Aw, come off!\" was Jimmied disgusted sally.  \"Where are your ears? Wake up!  It's six bells and the cook has struck.  Here--\"  Seizing the guide by the sleeve, Jimmie shook his finger under the other's nose for attention.  Then he repeated his old-time universal sign language denoting hunger.  The guide followed with great interest Jimmie's motion of pointing into his open mouth and gazed delightedly at the patting of the stomach. Apparently, however, he could discover nothing amiss with the belt buckle or any of the accoutrements that adorned the person of the new-found recruit.  He shook his head in a negative way.  \"Oh, you mutton-head!\" scorned Jimmie.  Then, recalling the few words of German he had learned in haphazard fashion, he began again, pausing between each word to give emphasis to his request.  \"Ach, Ich say, old scout,\" he stated, \"Ich would like some brodt haben, und sauer kraut, und wiener wurst, and kaffee, and pumpernickel, und kaffekuchen, und Kolbfleisch, und--oh, whatever you have handy.\"  A smile slowly spread over the face of the guide as he began to comprehend Jimmie's meaning.  He nodded vigorously.  \"And I say, dumbhead, Heute Ganse Braten!\" Jimmie added vigorously. \"There!\" he declared in an undertone, \"I know I saw that sign in Dick Stein's restaurant on the north side in Chicago one time when I was there, and I asked the man what it meant.  He said"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22994"],["title","The Frontier in American History (#1)"],["body","origins, too little to the American factors. The frontier is the line of most rapid and effective Americanization. The wilderness masters the colonist. It finds him a European in dress, industries, tools, modes of travel, and thought. It takes him from the railroad car and puts him in the birch canoe. It strips off the garments of civilization and arrays him in the hunting shirt and the moccasin. It puts him in the log cabin of the Cherokee and Iroquois and runs an Indian palisade around him. Before long he has gone to planting Indian corn and plowing with a sharp stick; he shouts the war cry and takes the scalp in orthodox Indian fashion. In short, at the frontier the environment is at first too strong for the man. He must accept the conditions which it furnishes, or perish, and so he fits himself into the Indian clearings and follows the Indian trails. Little by little he transforms the wilderness, but the outcome is not the old Europe, not simply the development of Germanic germs, any more than the first phenomenon was a case of reversion to the Germanic mark. The fact is, that here is a new product that is American. At first, the frontier was the Atlantic coast. It was the frontier of Europe in a very real sense. Moving westward, the frontier became more and more American. As successive terminal moraines result from successive glaciations, so each frontier leaves its traces behind it, and when it becomes a settled area the region still partakes of the frontier characteristics. Thus the advance of the frontier has meant a steady movement away from the influence of Europe, a steady growth of independence on American lines. And to study this advance, the men who grew up under these conditions, and the political, economic, and social results of it, is to study the really American part of our history.  In the course of the seventeenth century the frontier was advanced up the Atlantic river courses, just beyond the \"fall line,\" and the tidewater region became the settled area. In the first half of the eighteenth century another advance occurred. Traders followed the Delaware and Shawnese Indians to the Ohio as early as the end of the first quarter of the century.[5:1] Gov. Spotswood, of Virginia, made an expedition in 1714 across the Blue Ridge. The end of the first quarter of the century saw the advance of the Scotch-Irish and the Palatine Germans up the Shenandoah Valley into the western part of Virginia, and along the Piedmont region of the Carolinas.[5:2] The Germans in New York pushed the frontier of settlement up the Mohawk to German Flats.[5:3] In Pennsylvania the town of Bedford indicates the line of settlement. Settlements soon began on the New River, or the Great Kanawha, and on the sources of the Yadkin and French Broad.[5:4] The King attempted to arrest the advance by his proclamation of 1763,[5:5] forbidding settlements beyond the sources of the rivers flowing into the Atlantic; but in vain. In the period of the Revolution the frontier crossed the Alleghanies into Kentucky and Tennessee, and the upper waters of the Ohio were settled.[5:6] When the first census was taken in 1790, the continuous settled area was bounded by a line which ran near the coast of Maine, and included New England except a portion of Vermont and New Hampshire, New York along the Hudson and up the Mohawk about Schenectady, eastern and southern Pennsylvania, Virginia well across the Shenandoah Valley, and the Carolinas and eastern Georgia.[6:1] Beyond this region of continuous settlement were the small settled areas of Kentucky and Tennessee, and the Ohio, with the mountains intervening between them and the Atlantic area, thus giving a new and important character to the frontier. The isolation of the region increased its peculiarly American tendencies, and the need of transportation facilities to connect it with the East called out important schemes of internal improvement, which will be noted farther on. The \"West,\" as a self-conscious section, began to evolve.  From decade to decade distinct advances of the frontier occurred. By the census of 1820[6:2] the settled area included Ohio, southern Indiana and Illinois, southeastern Missouri, and about one-half of Louisiana. This settled area had surrounded Indian areas, and the management of these tribes became an object of political concern. The frontier region of the time lay along the Great Lakes, where Astor's American Fur Company operated in the Indian trade,[6:3] and beyond the Mississippi, where Indian traders extended their activity even to the Rocky Mountains; Florida also furnished frontier conditions. The Mississippi River region was the scene of typical frontier settlements.[7:1]  The rising steam navigation[7:2] on western waters, the opening of the Erie Canal, and the westward extension of cotton[7:3] culture added five frontier states to the Union in this period. Grund, writing in 1836, declares: \"It appears then that the universal disposition of Americans to emigrate to the western wilderness, in order to enlarge their dominion over inanimate nature, is the actual result of an expansive power which is inherent in them, and which by continually agitating all classes of society is constantly throwing a large portion of the whole population on the extreme confines of the State, in order to gain space for its development. Hardly is a new State or Territory formed before the same principle manifests itself again and gives rise to a further emigration; and so is it destined to go on until a physical barrier must finally obstruct its progress.\"[7:4]  In the middle of this century the line indicated by the present eastern boundary of Indian Territory, Nebraska, and Kansas marked the frontier of the Indian country.[8:1] Minnesota and Wisconsin still exhibited frontier conditions,[8:2] but the distinctive frontier of the period is found in California, where the gold discoveries had sent a sudden tide of adventurous miners, and in Oregon, and the settlements in Utah.[8:3] As the frontier had leaped over the Alleghanies, so now it skipped the Great Plains and the Rocky Mountains; and in the same way that the advance of the frontiersmen beyond the Alleghanies had caused the rise of important questions of transportation and internal improvement, so now the settlers beyond the Rocky Mountains needed means of communication with the East, and in the furnishing of these arose the settlement of the Great Plains and the development of still another kind of frontier life. Railroads, fostered by land grants, sent an increasing tide of immigrants into the Far West. The United States Army fought a series of Indian wars in Minnesota, Dakota, and the Indian Territory.  By 1880 the settled area had been pushed into northern Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota, along Dakota rivers, and in the Black Hills region, and was ascending the rivers of Kansas and Nebraska. The development of mines in Colorado had drawn isolated frontier settlements into that region, and Montana and Idaho were receiving settlers. The frontier was found in these mining camps and the ranches of the Great Plains. The superintendent of the census for 1890 reports, as previously stated, that the settlements of the West lie so scattered over the region that there can no longer be said to be a frontier line.  In these successive frontiers we find natural boundary lines which have served to mark and to affect the characteristics of the frontiers, namely: the \"fall line;\" the Alleghany Mountains; the Mississippi; the Missouri where its direction approximates north and south; the line of the arid lands, approximately the ninety-ninth meridian; and the Rocky Mountains. The fall line marked the frontier of the seventeenth century; the Alleghanies that of the eighteenth; the Mississippi that of the first quarter of the nineteenth; the Missouri that of the middle of this century (omitting the California movement); and the belt of the Rocky Mountains and the arid tract, the present frontier. Each was won by a series of Indian wars.  At the Atlantic frontier one can study the germs of processes repeated at each successive frontier. We have the complex European life sharply precipitated by the wilderness into the simplicity of primitive conditions. The first frontier had to meet its Indian question, its question of the disposition of the public domain, of the means of intercourse with older settlements, of the extension of political organization, of religious and educational activity. And the settlement of these and similar questions for one frontier served as a guide for the next. The American student needs not to go to the \"prim little townships of Sleswick\" for illustrations of the law of continuity and development. For example, he may study the origin of our land policies in the colonial land policy; he may see how the system grew by adapting the statutes to the customs of the successive frontiers.[10:1] He may see how the mining experience in the lead regions of Wisconsin, Illinois, and Iowa was applied to the mining laws of the Sierras,[10:2] and how our Indian policy has been a series of experimentations on successive frontiers. Each tier of new States has found in the older ones material for its constitutions.[10:3] Each frontier has made similar contributions to American character, as will be discussed farther on.  But with all these similarities there are essential differences due to the place element and the time element. It is evident that the farming frontier of the Mississippi Valley presents different conditions from the mining frontier of the Rocky Mountains. The frontier reached by the Pacific Railroad, surveyed into rectangles, guarded by the United States Army, and recruited by the daily immigrant ship, moves forward at a swifter pace and in a different way than the frontier reached by the birch canoe or the pack horse.
