But I should be very glad to hear what you have to say about it.  No doubt you have felt one.\"  \"Felt one!\" cried Jim, screwing up his face and drawing his limbs together, as if he were suffering horrible pain, \"no, I've never felt one.  The man what _feels_ a nip aint likely to live to tell what his feelin's was.  But I've _seed_ one.\"  \"You've seen one, have you?  That must have been interesting.  Where was it?\"  \"Not very far from the Greenland coast,\" said Croft, giving his quid another turn.  \"This was the way of it.  You must know that there was two ships of us in company at the time.  Whalers we was.  We got into the heart of the pack somehow, and we thought we'd never get out of it again.  There was nothin' but ice all round us as far as the eye could see.  The name of our ship was the _Nancy_.  Our comrade was the _Bullfinch_.  One mornin' early we heard a loud noise of ice rubbin' agin the sides o' the ship, so we all jumped up, an' on deck as fast as we could, for there's short time given to save ourselves in them seas sometimes.  The whole pack, we found, was in motion, and a wide lead of water opened up before us, for all the world like a smooth river or canal windin' through the pack.  Into this we warped the ship, and hoistin' sail, steered away cheerily.  We passed close to the _Bullfinch_, which was still hard and fast in the pack, and we saw that her crew were sawin' and cuttin' away at the ice, tryin' to get into the lead that we'd got into.  So we hailed them, and said we would wait for 'em outside the pack, if we got through.  But the words were no sooner spoken, when the wind it died away, and we were becalmed about half a mile from the _Bullfinch_.  \"`You'd better go down to breakfast, boys,' says our captain, says he, `the breeze won't be long o' comin' again.'  \"So down the men went, and soon after that the steward comes on deck, and, says he to the captain, `Breakfast, sir.'  `Very good,' says the captain, and down he went too, leavin' me at the wheel and the mate in charge of the deck.  He'd not been gone three minutes when I noticed that the great field of ice on our right was closin' in on the field on our left, and the channel we was floatin' in was closin' up.  The mate noticed it, too, but he wouldn't call the captain 'cause the ice came so slowly and quietly on that for a few minutes we could hardly believe it was movin' and everything around us looked so calm and peaceful like that it was difficult to believe our danger was so great.  But this was only a momentary feelin', d'ye see.  A minute after that the mate he cries down to the captain:--  \"`Ice closin' up, sir!'  \"And the captain he runs on deck.  By this time there was no mistake about it; the ice was close upon us.  It was clear that we were to have a nip.  So the captain roars down the hatchway, `Tumble up there! tumble up! every man alive! for your lives!'  And sure enough they did tumble up, as I never seed 'em do it before--two or three of 'em was sick; they came up with their clothes in their hands.  The ice was now almost touchin' our sides, and I tell _you_, sir, I never did feel so queerish in all my life before as when I looked over the side at the edge of that great field of ice which rose three foot out o' the water, and was, I suppose, six foot more below the surface.  It came on so slow that we could hardly see the motion.  Inch by inch the water narrowed between it and our sides.  At last it touched on the left side, and that shoved us quicker on to the field on our right.  Every eye was fixed on it--every man held his breath.  You might have heard a pin fall on the deck.  It touched gently at first, then there was a low grindin' and crunchin' sound.  The ship trembled as if it had been a livin' creetur, and the beams began to crack.  Now, you must know, sir, that when a nip o' this sort takes a ship the ice usually eases off, after giving her a good squeeze, or when the pressure is too much for her, the ice slips under her bottom and lifts her right out o' the water.  But our _Nancy_ was what we call wall-sided.  She was never fit to sail in them seas.  The consequence was that the ice crushed her sides in.  The moment the captain heard the beams begin to go he knew it was all up with the ship; so he roared to take to the ice for our lives!  You may be sure we took his advice.  Over the side we went, every man Jack of us, and got on the ice.  We did not take time to save an article belongin' to us; and it was as well we did not, for the ice closed up with a crash, and we heard the beams and timbers rending like a fire of musketry in the hold.  Her bottom must have been cut clean away, for she stood on the ice just as she had floated on the sea.  Then the noise stopped, the ice eased off, and the ship began to settle.  The lead of water opened up again; in ten minutes after that the _Nancy_ went to the bottom and left us standing there on the ice.  \"It was the mercy of God that let it happen so near the _Bullfinch_.  We might have been out o' sight o' that ship at the time, and then every man of us would have bin lost.  As it was, we had a hard scramble over a good deal of loose ice, jumpin' from lump to lump, and some of us fallin' into the water several times, before we got aboard.  Now that was a bad nip, sir, warn't it?\"  \"It certainly was,\" replied Gregory; \"and although I delight in being among the ice, I sincerely hope that our tight little brig may not be tried in the same way.  But she is better able to stand it, I should think.\"  \"That she is, sir,\" replied Croft, with much confidence.  \"I seed her in dock, sir, when they was a-puttin' of extra timbers on the bow, and I do believe she would stand twice as much bad usage as the _Nancy_ got, though she is only half the size.\"  Jim Croft's opinion on this point was well founded, for the _Hope_ had indeed been strengthened and prepared for her ice battles with the greatest care, by men of experience and ability.  As some readers may be interested in this subject, I shall give a brief account of the additions that were made to her hull.  The vessel was nearly two hundred tons burden.  She had originally been built very strongly, and might even have ventured on a voyage to the Polar seas just as she was.  But Captain Harvey resolved to take every precaution to insure the success of his voyage, and the safety and comfort of his men.  He, therefore, had the whole of the ship's bottom sheathed with thick hardwood planking, which was carried up above her water-line, as high as the ordinary floe-ice would be likely to reach. The hull inside was strengthened with stout cross-beams, as well as with beams running along the length of the vessel, and in every part that was likely to be subjected to pressure iron stanchions were fastened.  But the bow of the vessel was the point where the utmost strength was aimed at.  Inside, just behind the cutwater, the whole space was so traversed by cross-beams of oak that it almost became a solid mass, and outside the sharp stem was cased in iron so as to resemble a giant's chisel. The false keel was taken off, the whole vessel, in short, was rendered as strong, outside and in, as wood and iron and skill could make her. It need scarcely be said that all the other arrangements about her were made with the greatest care and without regard to expense, for although the owners of the brig did not wish to waste their money, they set too high a value on human life to risk it for the sake of saving a few pounds.  She was provisioned for a cruise of two years and a half.  But this was in case of accidents, for Captain Harvey did not intend to be absent much longer than one year.  But, to return to our story:  Jim Croft's fear that they would be set fast was realised sooner than he expected.  The floes began to close in, from no cause that could be seen, for the wind was quite still, and in a short time the loose ice pressed against the _Hope_ on all sides.  It seemed to young Gregory as if the story that the seaman had just related was about to be enacted over again; and, being a stranger to ice, he could not help feeling a little uneasy for some time.  But there was in reality little or no danger, for the pressure was light, and the brig had got into a small bay in the edge of an ice-field, which lay in the midst of the smaller masses.  Seeing that there was little prospect of the pack opening up just then, the captain ordered the ice-anchors to be got out and fixed.  The appearance of the sea from the brig's deck was now extremely wintry, but very bright and cheerful.  Not a spot of blue water was to be seen in any direction.  The whole ocean appeared as if it had been frozen over.  It was now past noon, and the sun's rays were warm, although the quantity of ice around rendered the air cold.  As the men were returning from fixing the anchors, the captain looked over the side, and said:  \"It's not likely that we shall move out of this for some hours.  What say you, lads, to a game of football?\"  The proposal was received with a loud cheer.  The ball had been prepared by the sail-maker, in expectation of some such opportunity as this.  It was at once tossed over the side; those men who were not already on the field scrambled out of the brig, and the entire crew went leaping and yelling over the ice with the wild delight of schoolboys let loose for an unexpected holiday.  They were in the middle of the game when a loud shout came from the brig, and the captain's voice was heard singing out:  \"All hands ahoy! come aboard.  Look alive!\"  Instantly the men turned, and there was a general race toward the brig, which lay nearly a quarter of a mile distant from them.  In summer, changes in the motions of the ice take place in the most unexpected manner.  Currents in the ocean are, no doubt, the chief cause of these; the action of winds has also"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23493"],["title","Under the Waves: Diving in Deep Waters (#1)"],["body"," who's got an amazin' conscience, but no nerves whatever to speak of--ah, that's the man to go under water, an' crawl about by the hour among mud and wreckage without gittin' excited or makin' a fuss about it if he should get his life-line or air-toobe entangled among iron bolts, smashed-up timbers, twisted wire-ropes, or such like.\"  \"Scotchmen should feel complimented by your opinion of them,\" said Edgar.  \"So they should, for I mean it,\" replied Baldwin, \"but I hope the Irishman will turn up a trump this time.--May I take the liberty of askin' how you're gittin' on wi' the engineering, Mister Edgar?\"  \"Oh, famously.  That is to say, I've just finished my engagement with the firm of Steel, Bolt, Hardy, and Company, and am now on the point of going to sea.\"  Baldwin looked at his companion in surprise.  \"Going to sea!\" he repeated, \"why, I thought you didn't like the sea?\"  \"You thought right, Baldwin, but men are sometimes under the necessity of submitting to what they don't like.  I have no love for the sea, except, indeed, as a beautiful object to be admired from the shore, but, you see, I want to finish my education by going a voyage as one of the subordinate engineers in an ocean-steamer, so as to get some practical acquaintance with marine engineering.  Besides, I have taken a fancy to see something of foreign parts before settling down vigorously to my profession, and--\"  \"Well?\" said Baldwin, as the youth made rather a long pause.  \"Can you keep a secret, Baldwin, and give advice to a fellow who stands sorely in need of it?\"  The youth said this so earnestly that the huge diver, who was a sympathetic soul, declared with much fervour that he could do both.  \"You must know, then,\" began Edgar with some hesitation, \"the fact is-- you're such an old friend, Baldwin, and took such care of me when I was a boy up to that sad time when I lost my father, and you lost an employer--\"  \"Ay, the best master I ever had,\" interrupted the diver.  \"That--that I think I may trust you; in short, Baldwin, I'm over head and ears with a young girl, and--and--\"  \"An' your love ain't requited--eh?\" said Baldwin interrogatively, while his weatherbeaten face elongated.  \"No, not exactly that,\" rejoined Edgar, with a laugh.  \"Aileen loves me almost, I believe, as well as I love her, but her father is dead against us.  He scorns me because I am not a man of wealth.\"  \"What is _he_?\" demanded Baldwin.  \"A rich China merchant.\"  \"He's more than that,\" said Baldwin.  \"Indeed!\" said Edgar, with a surprised look; \"what more is he?\"  \"He's a goose!\" returned the diver stoutly.  \"Don't be too hard on him, Baldwin.  Remember, I hope some day to call him father-in-law.  But why do you hold so low an opinion of him?\"  \"Why, because he forgets that riches may, and often do, take to themselves wings and fly away, whereas broad shoulders, and deep chest, and sound limbs, and a good brain, usually last the better part of a lifetime; and a brave heart will last for ever.\"  \"I am afraid that I have yet to prove, to myself as well as to the old gentleman, that the brave heart is mine,\" returned Edgar.  \"As to the physique--you may be so far right, but he evidently undervalues that.\"  \"I said nothing about physic,\" returned Baldwin, who still frowned as he thought of the China merchant, \"and the less that you and I have to do wi' that the better.  But what are you goin' to do, sir?\"  \"That is just the point on which I want to have your advice.  What ought I to do?\"  \"Don't run away with her, whatever you do,\" said Baldwin emphatically.  The youth laughed slightly as he explained that there was no chance whatever of his doing that, because Aileen would never consent to run away or to disobey her father.  \"Good--good,\" said the diver, with still greater emphasis than before, \"I like that.  The gal that would sacrifice herself and her lover sooner than disobey her father--even though he is a goose--is made o' the right stuff.  If it's not takin' too great a liberty, Mister Edgar, may I ask what she's like?\"  \"What she's like--eh?\" murmured the other, dropping his head as if in reverie, and stroking the dark shadow on his chin which was beginning to do duty for a beard.  \"Why, she--she's like nothing that I ever saw on earth before.\"  \"No!\" ejaculated Baldwin, elevating his eyebrows a little, as he said gravely, \"what, not even like an angel?\"  \"Well, yes; but even that does not sufficiently describe her.  She's fair,\"--he waxed enthusiastic here,--\"surpassingly fair, with wavy golden tresses and blue eyes, and a bright complexion and a winning voice, and a sylph-like figure and a thinnish but remarkably pretty face--\"  \"Ah!\" interrupted Baldwin, with a sigh, \"I know: just like my missus.\"  \"Why, my good fellow,\" cried Edgar, unable to restrain a fit of laughter, \"I do not wish to deny the good looks of Mrs Baldwin, but you know that she's uncommonly ruddy and fat and heavy, as well as fair.\"  \"Ay, an' forty, if you come to that,\" said the diver.  \"She's fourteen stun if she's an ounce; but let me tell you, Mister Edgar, she wasn't always heavy.  There _was_ a time when my Susan was as trim and taut and clipper-built as any Aileen that ever was born.\"  \"I have no doubt of it whatever,\" returned the youth, \"but I was going to say, when you interrupted me, it is her eyes that are her strong point--her deep, liquid, melting blue eyes, that look at you so earnestly, and seem to pierce--\"  \"Ay, just so,\" interrupted the diver; \"pierce into you like a gimblet, goin' slap agin the retina, turnin' short down the jugular, right into the heart, where they create an agreeable sort o' fermentation.  Oh! Don't I know?--my Susan all over!\"  Edgar's amusement was tinged slightly with disgust at the diver's persistent comparisons.  However, mastering his feelings, he again demanded advice as to what he should do in the circumstances.  \"You han't told me the circumstances yet,\" said the diver quietly.  \"Well, here they are.  Old Mr Hazlit--\"  \"What!  Hazlit?  Miss Hazlit, is _that_ her name?\" cried Baldwin, with a look of pleased surprise.  \"Yes, do you know her?\"  \"Know her?  Of course I do.  Why, she visits the poor in my district o' the old town--you know I'm a local preacher among the Wesleyans--an' she's one o' the best an' sweetest--ha!  Angel indeed!  I'm glad she wasn't made an angel of, for it would have bin the spoilin' of a splendid woman.  Bless her!\"  The diver spoke with much enthusiasm, and the young man smiled as he said, \"Of course I add Amen to your last words.--Well then,\" he continued, \"Aileen's father has refused to allow me to pay my addresses to his daughter.  He has even forbidden me to enter his house, or to hold any intercourse whatever with her.  This unhappy state of things has induced me to hasten my departure from England.  My intention is to go abroad, make a fortune, and then return to claim my bride, for the want of money is all that the old gentleman objects to.  I cannot bear the thought of going away without saying good-bye, but that seems now unavoidable, for he has, as I have said, forbidden me the house.\"  Edgar looked anxiously at his companion's face, but received no encouragement there, for Baldwin kept his eyes on the ground, and shook his head slowly.  \"If the old gentleman has forbid you his house, of course you mustn't go into it.  However, it seems to me that you might cruise about the house and watch till Sus--Aileen, I mean--comes out; but I don't myself quite like the notion of that either, it don't seem fair an' above-board like.\"  \"You are right,\" returned Edgar.  \"I cannot consent to hang about a man's door, like a thief waiting to pounce on his treasure when it opens.  Besides, he has forbidden Aileen to hold any intercourse with me, and I know her dear nature too well to subject it to a useless struggle between duty and inclination.  She is certain to obey her father's orders at any cost.\"  \"Then, sir,\" said Baldwin decidedly, \"you'll just have to go afloat without sayin' good-bye.  There's no help for it, but there's this comfort, that, bein' what she is, she'll like you all the better for it.--Now, here we are at the pier.  Boat a-hoy-oy!\"  In reply to the diver's hail a man in a punt waved his hand, and pulled for the landing-place.  A few strokes of the oar soon placed them on the deck of a large clumsy vessel which lay anchored off the entrance to the harbour.  This was the diver's barge, which exhibited a ponderous crane with a pendulous hook and chain in the place where its fore-mast should have been.  Several men were busied about the deck, one of whom sat clothed in the full dress of a diver, with the exception of the helmet, which was unscrewed and lay on the deck near his heavily-weighted feet.  The dress was wet, and the man was enjoying a quiet pipe, from all which Edgar judged that he was resting after a dive.  Near to the plank on which the diver was seated there stood the chest containing the air-pumps.  It was open, the pumps were in working order, with two men standing by to work them. Coils of india-rubber tubing lay beside it.  Elsewhere were strewn about stones for repairing the pier, and various building tools.  \"Has Machowl come on board yet?\" asked Baldwin, as he stepped on the deck.  \"Ah, I see he has.--Well, Rooney lad, are you prepared to go down?\"  \"Yis, sur, I am.\"  Rooney Machowl, who stepped forward as he spoke, was a fine specimen of a man, and would have done credit to any nationality.  He was about the middle height, very broad and muscular, and apparently twenty-three years of age.  His countenance was open, good-humoured, and good-looking, though by no means classic--the nose being turned-up, the eyes small and twinkling, and the mouth large.  \"Have you ever seen anything of this sort before?\" asked Baldwin, with a motion of his hand towards the diving apparatus scattered on the deck.  \"No sur, nothin'.\"  \"Was you bred to any trade?\"  \"Yis, sur, I'm a ship-carpenter.\"  \"An'"]]]
