And then there are bought men, and spies smuggled in, and--oh, I needn't elaborate. It's enough to say that we've been thoroughly infiltrated, and that most of their agents have absolutely impeccable dossiers. We can't give neoscop to everybody, you know--Security has to rely on spot checks and the testing of key personnel. Only when organizations get as big as they are today, there's apt to be no real key man, and a few spies strategically placed in the lower echelons can pick-up a hell of a lot of information. Then there are the colonists out on the planets--our hold on them has always necessarily been loose, because of transportation and communication difficulties if nothing else. And, as I say, foreign powers. A little country like Switzerland or Denmark or Venezuela can't do much by itself, but an undercover international pooling of resources.... Anyway, we have reason to believe in the existence of a large, well financed, well organized underground, with trained fighting men, big secret weapons dumps, and saboteurs ready for the word 'go'--to say nothing of a restless population and any number of covert sympathizers who'd follow if the initial uprising had good results.\"  \"Or bad, depending on whose viewpoint you take,\" grinned the one-armed man.  Lancaster put his elbows on his knees and rested his forehead on shaking hands. \"What has all this got to do with me?\" he protested. \"I'm not the hero of some cloak-and-dagger spy story. I'm no good at undercover stuff--what do you want of me?\"  \"It's very simple,\" Berg replied quietly. \"The balance of power is still with the government, because it does have more of the really heavy weapons than any other group can possibly muster. Alphabet bombs, artillery, rockets, armor, spaceships and space missiles. You see? Only research has lately suggested that a new era in warfare is developing--a new weapon as decisive as the Macedonian phalanx, gunpowder, and aircraft were in their day.\" As Lancaster raised his eyes, he met an almost febrile glitter in Berg's gaze. \"And _this_ weapon may reverse the trend. It may be the cheap and simple arm that anyone can make and use--the equalizer! So we've got to develop it before the rebels do. They have laboratories of their own, and their skill at stealing our secrets makes it impossible for us to trust the research to a Project in the usual manner. The fewer who knew of this weapon, the better--because in the wrong hands it could mean--Armageddon!\"         *       *       *       *       *  The run from Earth was short, for the space laboratory wasn't far away at the moment as interplanetary distances go. Lancaster wasn't told anything about its orbit, but guessed that it had a path a million miles or so sunward from Earth and highly tilted with respect to the ecliptic. That made for almost perfect concealment, for what spaceship would normally go much north or south of the region containing the planets?  He was too preoccupied during the journey to estimate orbital figures, anyway. He had seen enough pictures of open space, and some of them had been excellent. But the reality towered unbelievably over all representations. There simply is no way of describing that naked grandeur, and when you have once experienced it you don't want to try. His companions--Berg and the one-armed Jessup, who piloted the spaceboat--respected his need for silence.  The station had been painted non-reflecting black, which complicated temperature control but made accidental observation of its existence almost impossible. It loomed against the cold glory of stars like a pit of ultimate darkness, and Jessup had to guide the boat in with radar. When the last lock had clanged shut behind him and he stood in a narrow metal corridor, shut away from the sky, Lancaster felt a sense of unendurable loss.  It faded, and he grew aware of others watching him. There were half a dozen people, a motley group dressed in any shabby garment they happened to fancy, with no sign of the semi-military discipline of a Project crew. A Martian hovered in the background, and Lancaster didn't notice him at first. Berg introduced the humans casually. There was a stocky gray-haired man named Friedrichs, a lanky space-tanned young chap called Isaacson, a middle-aged woman and her husband by the name of Dufrere, a quiet Oriental who answered to Hwang, and a red-haired woman presented as Karen Marek. These, Berg explained, were the technicians who would be helping Lancaster. This end of the space station was devoted to the labs and factories; for security reasons, Lancaster couldn't be permitted to go elsewhere, but it was hoped he would be comfortable here.  \"Ummm--pardon me, aren't you a rather mixed group?\" asked the physicist.  \"Yes, very,\" said Berg cheerfully. \"The Dufreres are French, Hwang is Chinese, and Karen here is Norwegian though her husband was Czech. Not to mention.... There you are, I didn't see you before! Dr. Lancaster, I'd like you to meet Rakkan of Thyle, Mars, a very accomplished labman.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Lancaster gulped, shifting his feet and looking awkwardly at the small gray-feathered body and the beaked owl-face. Rakkan bowed politely, sparing Lancaster the decision of whether or not to shake the clawlike hand. He assumed Rakkan was somebody's slave--but since when did slaves act as social equals?  \"But you said this project was top secret!\" he blurted.  \"Oh, it is,\" smiled Karen Marek. She had a husky, pleasant voice, and while she was a little too thin to be really good-looking, she was cast in a fine mold and her eyes were large and gray and lovely. \"I assure you, non-Americans are perfectly capable of preserving a secret. More so than most Americans, really--we don't have ties on Earth. No one to blab to.\"  \"It's not well known today, but the original Manhattan Project that constructed the first atomic bombs had quite an international character,\" said Berg. \"It even included German, Italian, and Hungarian elements though the United States was at war with those countries.\"  \"Come along and we'll get you settled in your quarters,\" invited Isaacson.  Lancaster followed him down the long hallways, rather dazed with the whole business. He noticed that the space station had a crude, unfinished look, as if it had been hastily thrown together from whatever materials were available. That didn't ring true for a government enterprise, no matter how secret.  Berg seemed to read his thought again. \"We've worked under severe handicaps,\" he said. \"Look, just suppose a lot of valuable material and equipment were ferried into space. If it's an ordinary government deal, you know how many light-years of red tape are involved. Requisitions have to be filled out in triplicate, every last rivet has to be accounted for--there'd simply have been too much chance of a rebel spy getting a lead on us. It was safer all around to use whatever chance materials could be obtained from salvage or through individual purchases on other planets. Ever hear of the _Waikiki_?\"  \"Ummm--seems so--wasn't she the big freighter that disappeared many years ago?\"  \"That's the one. A meteor swarm struck her on the way to Venus. Furthermore, one of them shorted out her engine controls, so that she swooped out of the ecliptic plane and fell into an eccentric skew orbit. When this project was first started, one of our astronomers thought he'd identified the swarm--it has a regular path of its own about the sun, though the orbit is so cockeyed that spaceships hardly ever even see the things. Anyway, knowing the orbit of the meteors and that of the _Waikiki_ at the time, he could calculate where the disaster must have taken place--which gave us a lead in searching for the hulk. We found it after a lot of investigation, moved it here, and built the station up around it. Very handy. And completely secret.\"  Lancaster had always suspected that Security was a little mad. Now he knew it. Oh, well--         *       *       *       *       *  His room was small and austere, but privacy was nice. The lab crew ate in a common refectory. Beyond the edge of their territory, great bulkheads blocked off three-fourths of the space station. Lancaster was sure that many people and several Martians lived there, for in the days that followed he saw any number of strangers appearing and disappearing in the region allowed him. Most of these were workmen of some kind or other, called in to help the lab crew as needed, but all of them were tight-lipped. They must have been cautioned not to speak to the guest more than was strictly necessary.  Living was Spartan in the station. It rotated fast enough to give weight, but even on the outer skin that was only one-half Earth gravity. A couple of silent Martians prepared undistinguished meals and did housework in the quarters. There were no films or other organized recreation, though Lancaster was told that the forbidden sector included a good-sized room for athletics.  But the crew he worked with didn't seem to mind. They had their own large collections of books and music wires, which they borrowed from each other. They played chess and poker with savage skill. Conversation was, at first, somewhat restrained in Lancaster's presence, and most of the humor had so little reference to things he knew that he couldn't follow it, but he became aware that they talked with more animation and intelligence than his friends on Earth. Manners were utterly informal, and it wasn't long before even Lancaster was being addressed by his first name; but cooperation was smooth and there seemed to be none of the intrigue and backbiting of a typical Project crew.  And the work filled their lives. Lancaster was caught up in it the \"day\" after his arrival, realized at once what it meant, and was plunged into the fascination of it. Berg hadn't lied; this was big!  The"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22245"],["title","Steve and the Steam Engine (#1)"],["body","his excitement had cooled into sober second thought, he marveled that he had been led into committing such a monstrous offense. He must have been mad. Often he had begged to do the very thing he had done and his father had always refused to let him, insisting that an expensive touring car was no toy for a boy of his age. Perhaps there had been some truth in the assertion, too, he now admitted. Yet were he to hang for it, he could not see why he had not run the car exactly as his elders were wont to do. Of course he had had a pretty big crowd aboard and the heavy load might have strained the machinery; and possibly--just possibly--he had speeded a bit. He certainly had made phenomenally good time for he did not want the fellows to think he was afraid to let out the engine.  Well, whatever the matter was, the harm was done now and he was in a most unenviable plight. No doubt it would cost a small fortune to get the automobile into shape again, more money than he had in the world; certainly far more than he had in his pocket at the present moment. What was he to do? Even suppose the boys did remember to send back help (they probably wouldn't--but suppose they did) how was he to pay a machinist? As he pictured himself being towed to a garage and the car being left there, he felt an uncomfortable sensation in his throat. He certainly was in for it now.  It would be ignominious to charge the repairs to his father but that would be the only course left him. Fortunately Mr. Tolman, who was a railroad official, was well known in the locality and therefore there would be no trouble about obtaining credit; but to ask his father to pay the bills for this escapade was anything but a manly and honorable way out and Steve wished with all his heart he had never been persuaded into the wretched affair. If there were only some escape possible, some alternative from being obliged to confess his wrong-doing! But to hope to conceal or make good the disaster was futile. And even if he could cover up what had happened, how contemptible it would be! He detested doing anything underhanded. Only sneaks and cowards resorted to subterfuge and although he had been called many names in his life these two had not been among them.  No, he should make a clean breast of what he had done and bear the consequences, and once out of his miserable plight he would take care never again to be a party to such an adventure. He had learned his lesson.  So absorbed was he in framing these worthy resolutions that he did not notice a tiny moving speck that appeared above the crest of the hill and now came whirling toward him. In fact the dusty truck and its yet more dusty driver were beside him before he heeded either one. Then the newcomer came to a stop and he heard a pleasant voice:  \"What's the matter, sonny?\"  Stephen glanced up, trying bravely to return his questioner's smile.  The man who addressed him was white-haired, ruddy, and muscular, and he wore brown denim overalls stained with oil and grease; but although he was middle-aged there was a boyish friendliness in his face and in the frank blue eyes that peered out from under his shaggy brows.  \"What's the trouble with your machine?\" he repeated.  \"I don't know,\" returned Stephen. \"If I did, you bet I wouldn't be sitting here.\"  The workman laughed.  \"Suppose you let me have a look at it,\" said he, climbing off the seat on which he was perched.  \"I wish you would.\"  \"It is a pretty fine car, isn't it?\" observed the man, as he approached it. \"Is it yours?\"  \"My father's.\"  \"He lets you use it, eh?\"  Stephen did not answer.  \"Some fathers ain't that generous,\" went on the man as he began to examine the silent monster. \"If I had an outfit like this, I ain't so sure I'd trust it to a chap of your size. Still, if you have your license, I suppose you must know how to run it.\"  [Illustration: \"You've got your engine nicely warmed up, youngster,\" he observed casually. Page 9.]  A shiver passed through Stephen's body. A license! What if the stranger should ask to see it?  There was a heavy fine, he now remembered, for driving a car unless one were in possession of this precious paper, although what the penalty was he could not at the instant recall; he had entirely forgotten there were any such legal details. Fearfully he eyed the mechanic.  The man, however, did not pursue the subject but instead appeared engrossed in carefully inspecting the automobile inside and out. As he poked about, now here, now there, Stephen watched him with constantly increasing nervousness; and after the investigation had proceeded for some little time and no satisfactory result had been reached, the boy's heart sank. Something very serious must be the matter if the trouble were so hard to locate, he reasoned. In imagination he heard his father's indignant reprimands and saw the Northampton trip shrivel into nothingness.  The workman in the meantime remained silent, offering no comment to relieve his anxiety. What he was thinking under the shabby visor cap pulled so low over his brows it was impossible to fathom. His hand was now unscrewing the top of the gasoline tank.  \"You've got your engine nicely warmed up, youngster,\" observed he casually. \"Maybe 'twas just as well you did come to a stop. You must have covered the ground at a pretty good clip.\"  There certainly was something very disconcerting about the stranger's conversation and again Stephen looked at him with suspicion.  \"Oh, I don't know,\" he mumbled, trying to assume an off-hand air. \"Perhaps we did come along fairly fast.\"  \"You weren't alone then.\"  \"N--o,\" was the uncomfortable reply. \"The fellows who sent you back from the village were with me.\"  For the first time the workman evinced surprise.  \"Nobody sent me,\" he retorted. \"I just thought as I was going by that you looked as if you were up against it, and as I happen to know something about engines I pulled up to give you a helping hand. The fix you are in isn't serious, though.\" He smiled broadly as if something amused him.  \"What is the matter with the car?\" demanded the boy desperately, in a voice that trembled with eagerness and anxiety and defied all efforts to remain under his control.  \"Why, son, nothing is wrong with your car. You've got no gasoline, that's all.\"  \"Gasoline!\" repeated the lad blankly.  \"Sure! You couldn't have had much aboard when you started, I guess. It managed to bring you as far as this, however, and here you came to a stop. The up-grade of the hill tipped the little gas you did have back in the tank so it would not run out, you see. Fill her up again and she'll sprint along as nicely as ever.\"  The relief that came with the information almost bowled Steve over.  For a moment he could not speak; then when he had caught his breath he exclaimed excitedly:  \"How can I get some gasoline?\"  His rescuer laughed at the fevered question.  \"Why, I happen to have a can of it here on my truck,\" he drawled, \"and I can let you have part of it if you are so minded.\"  \"Oh, I don't want to take yours,\" objected the boy.  \"Nonsense! Why not? I am going right past a garage on my way back and can get plenty more. We'll tip enough of mine into your tank to carry you home. It won't take a minute.\"  The suggestion was like water to the thirsty.  \"All right!\" cried Stephen. \"If you will let me pay for it I shall be mightily obliged to you. I'm mightily obliged anyway.\"  \"Pshaw! I've done nothing,\" protested the person in the oily jumper. \"What are we in the world for if not to do one another a good turn when we can?\"  As he spoke he extricated from his conglomerate load of lumber, tools, and boxes a battered can, the contents of which he began to transfer into Stephen's empty tank.  \"There!\" ejaculated he presently, as he screwed the metal top on. \"That isn't all she'll hold, but it will at least get you home. You are going right back, aren't you?\"  The boy glanced quickly at the speaker.  \"Yes.\"  \"That's right. I would if I were in your place,\" urged the man.  Furtively Stephen scrutinized the countenance opposite but although the words had contained a mingled caution and rebuke there was not the slightest trace of interest in the face of the speaker, who was imperturbably wiping off the moist nickel cap with a handful of waste from his pocket.  \"Yes,\" he repeated half-absently, \"I take it that amount of gas will just about carry you back to Coventry; it won't allow for any detours, to be sure, but if you follow the straight road it ought to fetch you up there all right.\"  Stephen started and again an interrogation rose to his lips. Who was this mysterious mechanic and why should he assume with such certainty that Coventry was the abiding place of the car? He longed to ask but a fear of lengthening the interview prevented him from doing so. If he began to ask questions might not the stranger assume the same privilege and wheel upon him with some embarrassing inquiry? No, the sooner he was clear of this wizard in the brown overalls the better. But for the sake of his peace of mind he should like to know whether the man really knew who he was or whether his comments were simply matters of chance. There certainly was something very uncanny and uncomfortable about it all, something that led him to feel that the person in the jumper was fully acquainted with his escapade, disapproved of it, and meant to prevent him from prolonging it. Yet as he took a peep into the kindly blue eyes which he did not trust himself to meet directly he wondered if this assumption were not created by a guilty conscience rather than by fact. Certainly there was nothing accusatory in the other's bearing. His face was frankness itself. In books criminals were always fearing that people suspected them, reflected Steve. The man knew nothing about him at all. It was absurd to think he did.  Nevertheless the boy was eager to be gone from the presence of those searching blue eyes and therefore he climbed into his car, murmuring"]]]
