Miss Cabot left Richard in the carriage,    walked quickly to the door, and sending up her card by the servant,    requested to see Mr. Smith. The............. soon returned and begged    her to come in. As soon as she had done so.

The others    stand behind him and say in unison, \"Alas, alack, he fell on his back,\"    and while they are saying it, one of them hits Jack with a bean bag. If    Jack can see or guess who did it, he may drop down, and the guilty    person takes his place.

The motto of the worker is, \"I owe the world a life,\" and the motto of    the.................. is, \"The.................. owes me a living.\"  22 Caution, when not present in excess, is a desirable trait. Often it    saves one from disappointment or failure. Occasionally, however, one    finds a person so extremely.................. that his will is    paralyzed and he is totally unable to set about any new undertaking.    Too much.................. is indeed often.................. than too    little.  23 A whale is not a fish, even though it does live in water. A fish has no    lungs, is cold-blooded, and absorbs oxygen from the water through its    gills; but a whale is warm-blooded and has a genuine set of lungs. In    consequence, in bodily structure the is.................. like a    shark, which is a true fish, than it is like a horse.  24 The brook on our farm has many whims.

The ambitious person may    think that he merely thirsts to \"do something\" or \"be somebody\" but    really what he craves is to figure potently in the minds of others, to    be greatly loved, admired, or feared. To reap a success which no one    .................. does not satisfy the yearnings of the    .................. individual.  26 Washington was a very silent man. Of no man in the world's history do    we have so few sayings of a personal kind. As for talking about    himself, that was something in which he almost never indulged. Yet it    would be a great error to interpret his.................. as an    indication that he was in any sense cold or unfeeling.  27 As a rule, it is more economical to remember things by associating them    clearly and vigorously than by going through many repetitions of them.    Thus, a clear understanding of the causes for the Democratic victory in    the national election in 1916 will be.................. effective in    remembering the fact than a dozen.................. of the statement    \"Woodrow Wilson was elected in 1916.\"  28 Fundamentally, education depends upon the capacity of a person to    profit by past experiences. Past situations modify present and future    adjustments. Education in its broadest sense means acquiring    experiences that serve to.................. existing inherited or    acquired tendencies of behavior.  29 \"Na√Øve\" and \"unsophisticated\" are frequently confused. The former    suggests a type of behavior which is artless, spontaneous, and free    from the restraints of custom. The latter implies fully as great lack    of knowledge of social usage, and, in addition, conduct which is    primitive and perchance inelegant. Thus, the.................. youth    was the first to enter the car, and his.................. little    sister warmly kissed him in the presence of the king.
