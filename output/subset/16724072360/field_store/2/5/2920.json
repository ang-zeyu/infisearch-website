But in any case, better run the yard pump for an hour or so and get some water up into the tank. I'll be back as soon as I take a ride through the pasture. I want to see how that Angus yearling is coming that I picked out for house beef.\"  A few minutes later, Hetty in the pickup disappeared behind a hot swirl of yellow dust. Barney ambled to the cool pump house beneath the towering windmill. An electric motor, powered either from the REA line or from direct current stored in a bank of wet cell batteries, bulked large in the small shed. To the left, a small, gasoline-driven generator supplied standby power if no wind was blowing to turn the arm-driven generator or if the lines happened to be down, as was often the case in the winter.  Barney threw the switch to start the pump motor. Nothing happened. He reached for the light switch to test the single bulb hanging from a cord to the ceiling. Same nothing. Muttering darkly to himself, he changed the pump engine leads to DC current and closed the switch to the battery bank. The engine squeaked and whined slowly but when Barney threw in the clutch to drive the pump, it stopped and just hummed faintly. Then he opened the AC fuse box.  Johnny had freed the cauldron lid and was knocking out bits of broken glass from the kitchen window frame before putting in the new glass when Barney limped into the room.  \"That pot busted the pump house 'lectric line, Johnny, when it went sailing,\" he said. \"Miz Thompson wants to pump up some water and on top of that, the batteries are down. You got time to fix the line?\"  Johnny paused and surveyed the kitchen. \"I'm going to be working here for another hour anyway so Hetty can clean up when she gets back. Why don't you fire up the gasoline kicker for now and I'll fix the line when I get through here,\" he said.  \"O.K.,\" Barney nodded and turned to leave. \"Oh, forgot to ask you. Miz Thompson tell you about the egg?\"  \"What egg?\" Johnny asked.  \"The gold one.\"  Johnny grinned. \"Sure, and I saw the goose when I came in. And you're Jack and the windmill is your beanstalk. Go climb it, Barney and cut out the fairy tales.\"  \"Naw, Johnny,\" Barney protested, \"I ain't kidding. Miz Thompson got a gold egg from the hens this morning. At least, it looks kinda like gold but she says it ain't. See, here it is.\" He reached into the cupboard where Hetty had placed the odd egg. He walked over and handed it to Johnny who was sitting on the sink drain counter to work on the shattered window.  The younger man turned the egg over in his hand. \"It sure feels funny. Wonder what the inside looks like?\" He banged the egg gently against the edge of the drain board. When it didn't crack, he slammed it harder, but then realizing that if it did break suddenly, it would squish onto the floor, he put the egg on the counter and tapped it with his hammer.  The shell split and a clear liquid poured out on to the drain board, thin and clear, not glutenous like a normal egg white. A small, reddish ball, obviously the yolk, rolled across the board, fell into the sink and broke into powdery fragments. A faint etherlike odor arose from the mess.  \"I guess Miz Thompson was right,\" Barney said. \"She said that hen musta been pecking in the fertilizer chemicals. Never seen no egg like that before.\"  \"Yeh,\" Johnny said puzzledly. \"Well, so much for that.\" He tossed the golden shell to one side and turned back to his glass work. Barney left for the pumphouse.  Inside the pumphouse, Barney opened the gasoline engine tank and poked a stick down to test the fuel level. The stick came out almost dry. With another string of mutterings, he limped across the yard to the tractor shed for a gas can. Back in the pumphouse, he poured the engine tank full, set the gas can aside and then, after priming the carburetor, yanked on the starter pull rope. The engine caught with a spluttering roar and began racing madly. Barney lunged for the throttle and cut it back to idle, but even then, the engine was running at near full speed. Then Barney noticed the white fluid running down the side of the engine tank and dripping from the spout of the gasoline can. He grinned broadly, cut in the pump clutch and hurriedly limped across the yard to the kitchen.  \"Hey, Johnny,\" he called, \"did you put that milk o' Sally's into a gas can?\"  Johnny leaned through the open kitchen window. \"Yeh, why?\"  \"Well, I just filled the kicker with it by accident, and man, you orter hear that engine run,\" Barney exclaimed. \"Come see.\"  Johnny swung his legs through the window and dropped lightly to the yard. The two men were halfway across the yard from the pumphouse when a loud explosion ripped the building. Parts of the pump engine flew through the thin walls like shrapnel. A billowing cloud of purple smoke welled out of the ruptured building as Johnny and Barney flattened themselves against the hot, packed earth. Flames licked up from the pump shed. The men ran for the horse trough and grabbing pails of water, raced for the pumphouse. The fire had just started into the wooden walls of the building and a few splashes of water doused the flames.  They eyed the ruins of the gasoline engine. \"Holy cow,\" Johnny exclaimed, \"that stuff blew the engine right apart.\" He gazed up at the holes in the pumphouse roof. \"Blew the cylinders and head right out the roof. Holy cow!\"  Barney was pawing at the pump and electric motor. \"Didn't seem to hurt the pump none. Guess we better get that 'lectric line fixed though, now that we ain't got no more gas engine.\"  The two men went to work on the pump motor. The broken line outside the building was spliced and twenty minutes later, Johnny threw the AC switch. The big, electric motor spun into action and settled into a workmanlike hum. The overhead light dimmed briefly when the pump load was thrown on and then the slip-slap sound of the pump filled the shed. They watched and listened for a couple of minutes. Assured that the pump was working satisfactorily, they left the wrecked pumphouse.  Johnny was carrying the gasoline can of milk. \"Good thing you set this off to one side where it didn't get hit and go off,\" he said. \"The way this stuff reacts, we'd be without a pump, engine, or windmill if it had.  \"Barney, be a good guy and finish putting in that glass for me will you? I've got the frame all ready to putty. I've got me some fiddlin' and figurin' to do.\"  Johnny angled off to the tractor and tool shed and disappeared inside. Barney limped into the kitchen and went to work on the window glass. From the tractor shed came the sounds of an engine spluttering, racing, backfiring and then, just idling.  When Hetty drove back into the ranch yard an hour or so later, Johnny was rodeoing the farm tractor around the yard like a teen-ager, his face split in a wide grin. She parked the truck under the tree as Johnny drove the tractor alongside and gunned the engine, still grinning.  \"What in tarnation is this all about?\" Hetty asked as she climbed down from the pickup.  \"Know what this tractor's running on?\" Johnny shouted over the noise of the engine.  \"Of course I do, you young idiot,\" she exclaimed. \"It's gasoline.\"  \"Wrong,\" Johnny yelled triumphantly. \"It's running on Sally's milk!\"                       *      *      *      *      *  The next morning, Johnny had mixed up two hundred gallons of Sally's Fuel and had the pickup, tractor, cattle truck and his 1958 Ford and Hetty's '59 Chevrolet station wagon all purring on the mixture.  Mixing it was a simple process after he experimented and found the right proportions. One quart of pure Sally's milk to one hundred gallons of water. He had used the two remaining quarts in the gasoline can to make the mixture but by morning, Sally had graced the ranch with five more gallons of the pure concentrate. Johnny carefully stored the concentrated milk in a scoured fifty-five gallon gasoline drum in the tool shed.  \"We've hit a gold mine,\" he told Hetty exultantly. \"We're never going to have to buy gasoline again. On top of that, at the rate Sally's turning this stuff out, we can start selling it in a couple of weeks and make a fortune.\"  That same morning, Hetty collected three more of the golden eggs.  \"Set 'em on the shelf,\" Johnny said, \"and when we go into town next time I'll have Dale look at them and maybe tell us what those hens have been into. I'll probably go into town again Saturday for the mail.\"  But when Saturday came, Johnny was hobbling around the ranch on a wrenched ankle, suffered when his horse stumbled in a gopher hole and tossed him.  \"You stay off that leg,\" Hetty ordered. \"I'll go into town for the mail. Them girls can just struggle along without your romancing this week.\" Johnny made a wry face but obeyed orders.  \"Barneeey,\" Hetty bawled, \"bring me a quarter of beef outta the cooler.\" Barney stuck his head out of the barn and nodded. \"I been promising some good beef to Judge Hatcher for a month of Sundays now,\" Hetty said to Johnny.  \"If you're going to stop by the courthouse, how about taking those crazy eggs of yours into the county agent's office and leave them there for analysis,\" Johnny suggested. He hobbled into the kitchen to get the golden eggs.  Barney arrived with the chilled quarter of beef wrapped in burlap. He tossed it in the bed of the pickup and threw more sacks over it to keep it cool under the broiling, midmorning sun. Johnny came out with the eggs in a light cardboard box stuffed with crumpled newspapers. He wedged the box against the side of beef in the forward corner of the truck bed. \"One more thing, Hetty,\" he said. \"I've got a half drum of drain oil in the tractor shed that I've been meaning to trade in for some gearbox lube that Willy Simons said he'd let me have.

But it was necessary to have the crew ready to work together, for the seaman who had hauled on the weather-brace in tacking was now an officer, and the stations of many were new and strange to them.  Shuffles in the ship, and Terrill in the consort, proceeded to execute all the manoeuvres required in handling the vessel, from getting under way to coming to anchor again. Nearly all the officers and crew were zealous to perform their several parts correctly; but there were enough of the discontented ones, who shirked as much as possible, to create considerable confusion. The captain of the Young America was not satisfied with the manner in which the various evolutions were performed; so he began at the beginning, and went over all the ground again, to the great disgust of the runaways in his crew, who had been doing this sort of thing for four weeks, while the others were enjoying the beauties of the mountain scenery.  \"What's the matter, Captain Shuffles?\" asked Commodore Kendall, when the commander finished the routine a second time, and was still dissatisfied with the result.  \"It doesn't work well,\" replied Shuffles, biting his lip.  \"A new broom sweeps clean, they say,\" laughed the flag officer. \"Perhaps you are more particular than your predecessors were.\"  \"I think not. The ship would have miss-stayed under such handling as we have to-day, to say nothing of the clumsy look of it,\" continued the new captain. \"I shouldn't wish to be out in a gale with a crew as slack as ours is just now.\"  \"What's the trouble?\" asked the commodore, rather anxiously. \"I saw that things did not work well.\"  \"There is trouble somewhere, and I think I can see where it is.\"  \"What is it?\"  \"Certain parties in this ship don't like me very well, just now.\"  \"You mean the runaways,\" suggested Paul.  \"Of course.\"  \"They are making a mistake if they are slack in their duty,\" added the commodore, rather indignantly. \"They wish to go with us on our next excursion: but I don't think they can win the privilege in this manner.\"  \"Wilton and Howe are doing all they can to make things go wrong,\" said Captain Shuffles, who was more in sorrow than in anger at the conduct of these worthies. \"If they are doing it to spite me, they are only spiting themselves. I am going through these manoeuvres until they are a little more ship-shape, at least.\"  The new captain ordered all hands to take their stations for getting under way, and Commodore Kendall went aft, though he still carefully observed the conduct of the seamen. The clumsiness, and the intentional blunders of certain of the crew seemed to indicate that there was a conspiracy to defeat the purposes of the commander. First, Howe tumbled down while the hands were walking round the capstan; Spencer stumbled over him, and a dozen boys were thrown in a pile upon them. Then Richmond and Merrick dropped their handspikes overboard, through an open port, when the order was given to restore these articles to their proper places.  Little snarled himself up in the gasket on the fore-topsail yard, and dropped off, as though he had fallen, though he clung to the rope, and was brought up with a jerk ten or twelve feet below the spar. Some of his gang, believing he had really fallen, screamed, and the attention of the whole crew was drawn off from their duty. When the fore-topmast staysail and jib were to be set, somebody had fouled the down-hauls, so that they could not be hoisted. There was a kink in the halyards of the main-top gallant-sail, so that it would not run through the block. Clewlines, clew-garnets, leachlines, and buntlines were in a snarl. The zeal of those who were striving to do their duty faithfully seemed to make the matter worse, and the officers found it difficult to determine who really made the mischief; for the malcontents pretended to be as enthusiastic as their shipmates. Strong expressions and hard words were freely used by the vexed seamen, and certainly such a scene of confusion had never before been observed on board of the ship, even when a large proportion of the crew were green hands.  Captain Shuffles was deeply grieved by the misconduct of the crew; for, standing on the quarter-deck, he could not distinguish between the intentional and the unintentional blunders of the crew, and therefore believed that the disaffection was much more extensive than was really the case. The zealous efforts of one portion of the crew to rectify the mistakes of another portion only increased the confusion, and some of those who were actually doing their best appeared to be the real authors of the difficulty. The captain was drilling his crew in simultaneous movements, and it was difficult, if not impossible, to ascertain exactly the source of the unwonted confusion.  While the routine of evolutions was thus bunglingly performed, the principal and the professors, who had been discussing an interesting question of discipline in the main cabin, came on deck. Perhaps the fact that Mr. Lowington was not on deck had encouraged the conspirators in creating the confusion which pervaded the decks and rigging. As he was the last to ascend the companion-way, he paused on the steps, with his head on a level with the deck, to note the precision of the drill. He was not noticed by the conspirators, and, unfortunately for them, they continued in their career of insubordination. The quick eye of the principal readily detected the nature of the mischief, though it was as impossible for him as for the officers immediately to indicate the authors of the confusion which prevailed throughout the ship.  \"This does not look much like going down the Rhine this week,\" said Mr. Lowington to Commodore Kendall, as he stepped upon the quarter-deck.  \"I don't think it does, sir,\" replied Paul, grieved and indignant at the miserable exhibition of seamanship which the crew then presented.  \"This is a strange sight on board of this ship,\" added the principal, biting his lips with vexation, for, as usual, when the young tars displayed their seamanship, there were plenty of spectators on shore, and on board of other vessels in the roadstead.  \"I certainly never saw anything like it since we first began to learn ship's duty in Brockway harbor.\"  \"The crew appear to be hazing the new officers,\" continued Mr. Lowington, who could not fail to perceive that a large portion of the apparent blundering was intentional.  \"Of course there isn't a seaman on board who does not know his duty.\"  \"They are not familiar yet with their new stations, and a little confusion is unavoidable,\" said Mr. Lowington, willing to make all reasonable allowances.  \"But they have already been through the routine two or three times,\" suggested Paul.  \"Are the crew dissatisfied with the election?\" asked the principal.  \"I have not heard any dissatisfaction expressed; but I suppose some of them don't like Shuffles, especially those who went off in the Josephine.\"  \"There are not twenty of them left in the ship; and it seems as though the whole crew were engaged in this frolic.\"  At this moment a gang of the waist men, who were walking away with the main-topsail sheets, were suddenly piled up in a pyramid on deck. The second fellow in the line had fallen down; the next had tripped over him, and those that followed tumbled into the heap. It is more than probable that some, whose estimate of the value of good order was not very high, though they were tolerably good boys in the main, were tempted by their love of fun to take part in what appeared to them only a frolic. A scene of violent confusion ensued in this particular part of the deck. Some, who were near the bottom of the pile, were hurt by those who fell upon them, and the tempers of others were not improved by the mishap. Hard words followed, those at the bottom blaming those at the top, and those at the top growling at those at the bottom. Some were rubbing their elbows, others their shins, and all appeared to be anxious to ascertain who had produced the mischief.  \"Pipe to muster, Captain Shuffles,\" said the principal, stepping up to the bewildered commander. \"We have had about enough of this.\"  Shuffles gave the order to the first lieutenant, and it was duly transmitted to the boatswain, whose shrill pipe soon assembled the whole ship's company in the waist.  \"We shall catch it now,\" said Spencer, one of the runaways, to Howe, as they met near the rail, a little outside of the crowd.  \"No matter; he is only going to preach to us,\" replied Howe through the corner of his mouth, while he tried to look as innocent as one of the chaplain's lambs.  \"We shall not have a chance to go down the Rhine if we do things in this way.\"  \"I don't want to go down the Rhine; at least, not till I have been through Paris and Switzerland.\"  \"But we want to go ashore with the other fellows, or we shall have no chance to go anywhere.\"  \"Shut up! Don't talk about that here. If we don't go, no one will go. This is bully! We shall get things mixed so that the officers won't know a lamb from a goat.\"  \"Bob Shuffles hasn't made much yet as captain,\" laughed Spencer.  \"We'll get even with him yet,\" added Howe, still talking through the corner of his mouth, and looking all the time at the principal, who had taken his place on the hatch.  Mr. Lowington, as the rogue had suggested, only intended to \"preach.\" He had observed the insubordination of the crew, and he regretted it exceedingly, for he was as careful of the reputation of the ship as of his own. There was an evident intention on the part of a large portion of the ship's company to haze the new officers. Such a purpose was unworthy of the character of young gentlemen, and he hoped that such conduct as he had just witnessed would be discontinued. In a day or two he purposed to start for Germany, but he could not leave the ship unless he was satisfied that every one on board knew his duty; for on their return they might be compelled, by some unforeseen event, to go to sea"]]]
