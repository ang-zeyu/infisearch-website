Moreover, as related, the settlements in Mexico offer a haven of retreat should any tempest of prosecution beat upon the Utah polygamists through some slip of policy or accidental Gentile strength.  In Nevada, in Colorado, in Oregon, in Idaho, in every one of those States wherein the Church has planted the standards of Mormonism, the Mormon, as fast as he may, is making himself a power in politics. He is never a Democrat, never a Republican, always a Mormon. What sparks of independent political action broke into brief, albeit fiery, life a few years ago were fairly beaten out when Thatcher and Roberts were punished for daring to act outside the Mormon command.  Now, pretend what they will, assert what lie they choose, the Mormon President holds the Mormon vote, in whatever State it abides, in the hollow of his hand. He can, and does, place it to this or that party's support, according as he makes his bargain. He will use it to elect legislators and Congressmen in those States. He will employ it to select the Senators whom those States send to Washington. And when they are there, as Smoot is there, for the safeguarding of polygamy and what other crimes Mormonism may find it convenient to rest upon from time to time, those Senators and Representatives will act by the Mormon President's orders. \"When the lion's hide is too short,\" said the Greek, \"I piece it out with foxes.\" And the Mormons, in a day when the Danites have gone with those who called them into bloody being, and murder as a Churchly argument is no longer safe, profit by the Grecian's wisdom.  But the darkest side of Mormonism is seen when one considers the stamp of moral and mental degradation it sets upon those men and women who comprise what one might term the peasantry of the Church. Woman is, as the effect of Mormonism, peculiarly made to retrograde. Instead of being uplifted she is beaten down. She must not think; she must not feel; she must not know; she must not love. Her only safety lies in being blind and deaf and dull and senseless to every better sentiment of womanhood. She is to divide a husband with one or two or ten or twenty; she is not to be a wife, but the fraction of a wife. The moment she looks upon herself as anything other than a bearer of children she is lost. Should she rebel - and in her helplessness she does not know how to enter upon practical revolt - she becomes an outcast; a creature of no shelter, no food, no friend, no home. Woman is the basis or, if you will, the source and fountain of a race; woman is a race's inspiration. And what shall a race be, what shall its children be, with so lowered and befouled an origin?  At the hearing before the Senate Committee President Smith, stroking his long white beard in the manner of the patriarchs, made no secret of his five wives, and seemed to court the Gentile condemnation. This hardihood was of deliberate plan on the part of President Smith. He was inviting what he would call \"persecution.\" He did not fear actual prosecution in the Utah courts; as to the Federal forums, those tribunals were powerless against him now that Utah was a State. Being safe in the flesh, President Smith would bring upon himself and Mormonism the whole fury of the press. It would serve to quiet schism and bicker within the Mormon Church. An opposition or a \"persecution\" would act as a pressure to bring Mormons together. That pressure would squeeze out the last drop of political independence among Mormons, which to the extent that it existed might interfere with his disposal of the compact Mormon vote. In short, an attack upon himself and upon Mormonism by the Gentiles would tighten the hold of President Smith, close-herd the Mormons, and leave them ready politically to be driven hither and yon as seemed most profitable for Church purposes.  Gray, wise, crafty, sly, soft, one who carries mendacity to the heights of art, President Smith gives in all he says and does and looks the color of truth to this explanation of his frankness. He would not prodigiously care if Smoot were cast into outer Senate darkness. It would not be an evil past a remedy. He could send Smoot back; and send him back again. Meanwhile, he might lift up the cry of the Church persecuted; that of itself would stiffen the Mormon line of battle and multiply recruits.  President Smith looks forward to a time when one Senate vote will be decisive. He cannot prophesy the day; but by the light of what has been, he knows that it must dawn. About a decade ago the Democrats took the Senate from the Republicans by one vote - Senator Peffer's. In Garfield's day the Senate, before Conkling stepped down and out, was in even balance with a tie. What was, will be; and President Smith intends, when that moment arrives and the Senate is in poise between the parties, to have at least one Utah vote, and as many more as he may, to be a stock in trade wherewith to traffic security for his Church of Mormon and its crimes. Given a balance of power in the Senate - and it might easily come within his hands - President Smith could enforce such liberal terms for Mormonism as to privilege it in its sins and prevent chance of punishment.  There be those who, for a Mormon or a personal political reason, will find fault with this work and its now appearance in print; they will argue that some motive of politics underlies the publication. It is fair to state that in so arguing they will be right. The motive is three-ply - made up of a purpose to withstand the Mormon Church as a political force, limit its spread as a so-called religion, and buckler the mothers and daughters and sisters of the country against an enemy whose advances are aimed peculiarly at them. The morals of a people are in the custody of its women; and, against Mormonism - that sleepless menace to American morality - these confessions of Lee the Danite are set in types to become a weapon in their hands. It was the womanhood of the nation that compelled the present Senate investigation of Smoot and what Mormon influences and conspiracies produced him as their representative; and it is for a defense of womanhood and its purity that this book is made. The battle will not be wholly won with Smoot's eviction from his Senate seat; indeed, the going of Smoot will be only an incident. The war should continue until all of Mormonism and what it stands for is destroyed; for then, and not before, may wifehood or womanhood write itself safe between the oceans. Congress must not alone cleanse itself of Smoot; it must go forward to methods that shall save the politics of the country from a least of Mormon interference, and the aroused womanhood of the land should compel Congress to this work. He who would hold his house above his head must mind repairs, and the word is quite as true when spoken of a country.  Alfred Henry Lewis. New York City,  December 15, 1904.    THE MORMON MENACE OR, THE CONFESSIONS OF JOHN DOYLE LEE    CHAPTER I - THE STORMY YOUTH OF LEE  In justice to myself, my numerous family, and the public in general, I consider it my duty to write a history of my life. I shall content myself with giving facts, and let the readers draw their own conclusion therefrom. By the world at large I am called a criminal, and have been sentenced to be shot for deeds committed by myself and others nearly twenty years ago. I have acted my religion, nothing more. I have obeyed the orders of the Church. I have acted as I was commanded to do by my superiors. My sins, if any, are the result of doing what I was commanded to do by those who were my superiors in authority in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  My birthday was the 6th day of September, A.D. 1812. I was born in the town of Kaskaskia, Randolph County, Illinois. My father, Ralph Lee, was born in the State of Virginia. He was of the family of Lees of Revolutionary fame. He served his time as an apprentice and learned the carpenter's trade in the city of Baltimore. My mother was born in Nashville, Tennessee. She was the daughter of John Doyle, who for many years held the position of Indian Agent over the roving tribes of Indians in southeastern Illinois. He served in the War of the Revolution, and was wounded in one of the many battles in which he took part with the sons of liberty against the English oppressors.  At the time of my birth my father was considered one of the leading men of that section of country; he was a master workman, sober and attentive to business, prompt and punctual to his engagements. He contracted largely and carried on a heavy business; he erected a magnificent mansion, for that age and country, on his land adjoining the town of Kaskaskia.  This tract of land was the property of my mother when she married my father. My grandfather Doyle was a wealthy man. He died in 1809 at Kaskaskia, Illinois, and left his whole fortune to my mother and her sister Charlotte, by will. They being his only children, he divided the property equally between them.  My father and mother were both Catholics, were raised in that faith; I was christened in that Church. When about one year old, my mother being sick, I was sent to a French nurse, a negro woman. At this time my sister Eliza was eleven years old, but young as she was she had to care for my mother and do all the work of the household. To add to the misfortune, my father began to drink heavily and was soon very dissipated; drinking and gambling were his daily occupation. The interest and care of his family were no longer a duty with him; he was seldom present to cheer and comfort his lonely, afflicted wife.  The house was one mile from town, and we had no neighbors nearer than that. The neglect and indifference on the part of my father towards my afflicted mother served to increase her anguish and sorrow, until death came"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23531"],["title","Marjorie's Busy Days (#1)"],["body","\"you needn't. There's a raft,\" pointing to what had been the gangplank. \"Cannot you and your infant daughter manage to get ashore on that? This other lady is an expert swimmer, and I think she can reach land, while Buffalo Bill will, of course, save himself.\"  \"Me save myself!\" exclaimed Rosy Posy, gleefully. She had no objections to swimming on land, and throwing her fat self down flat, kicked vigorously, and assisted Boffin to swim by her side.  Kitty and Arabella arranged themselves on the raft, which Kitty propelled by a series of hitches. The shipwrecked sufferers thus made their way toward the desert island. There were several narrow escapes from drowning, but they generously assisted each other, and once when Kitty fell off her raft, the noble Captain offered to take Arabella on his own broad and stalwart back.  Buffalo Bill frequently forgot she was in the tossing ocean, and walked upright on her own fat legs.  But King said she was only \"treading water,\" go that was all right.  At last they sighted land, and by a mighty effort, and much encouraging of one another, they managed to reach the shore of the island. Exhausted, Marjorie threw herself on the beach, and the half-drowned Captain also dragged himself up on dry land. Kitty skilfully brought her raft ashore, and stepped out, exclaiming: \"Saved! But to what a fate!\"  This was one of their favorite lines, and Marjorie weakly opened her eyes to respond:  \"Methinks I shall not see to-morrow's sun!\"  \"Hist!\" whispered Kingdon, \"say no word, lady. There may be cannibals here!\"  \"Tannibals!\" cried Buffalo Bill. \"I 'ike Tannibals. Where is zey?\"  Somewhat revived, Kingdon began to look round the desert island to see what its nature might be.  \"We have escaped one terrible death!\" he declared, \"only to meet another. We must starve! This is a desert island exactly in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. No steamers pass here; no sailing vessels or ferryboats or,--or anything!\"  \"Oh! What shall we do?\" moaned Kitty, clasping her hands in despair. \"My precious Arabella! Already she is begging for food.\"  \"We must consider,\" said Marjorie, sitting up, and looking about her. \"If there is nothing else, we must kill the bear and eat him.\"  \"No, no!\" screamed Rosy Posy. \"No, no eat my Boffin Bear.\"  \"I will explore,\" said Kingdon. \"Come, Buffalo Bill, we are the men of this party, we will go all over the island and see what may be found in the way of food. Perhaps we will find cocoanuts.\"  \"Ess,\" said Buffalo Bill, slipping her little hand in her brother's, \"an' we'll take Boffin, so he won't get all killded.\"  \"And while you're gone,\" said Marjorie, \"we will dry our dripping garments and mend them.\"  \"Yes,\" said Kitty, \"with needles and thread out of my bag. I brought a big bag of all sorts of things, like Robinson Crusoe.\"  \"That wasn't Robinson Crusoe,\" said King, \"it was Mrs. Swiss Robinson.\"  \"Oh, so it was! Well, it doesn't matter, I brought the bag, anyway.\"  The two brave men went away, and returned in a surprisingly short time with a surprising amount of food.  \"These are cocoanuts,\" announced Kingdon, as he displayed four oranges. \"I had to climb the tall palm trees to reach them. But no hardships or dangers are too great to assist fair ladies.\"  The fair ladies expressed great delight at the gallant Captain's deed, and asked Buffalo Bill what she had secured.  \"Edds,\" said Rosy Posy, triumphantly, and, sure enough, in her tiny skirt, which she held gathered up before her, were three eggs and a cracker.  The eggs were hard-boiled, and were promptly appropriated by the three elder victims of the shipwreck, while the cracker fell to the share of Buffalo Bill, who was not yet of an age to eat hard-boiled eggs.  \"I, too, will make search!\" cried Marjorie. \"Methinks there may yet be food which you overlooked.\"  As Marjorie had brought the food to the desert island only an hour before, it was not impossible that she might find some more, so they let her go to make search. She returned with a paper bag of crackers and another of pears.  \"These are bread fruit,\" she announced, showing the crackers; \"and these are wild pears. This is indeed a fruitful island, and we're lucky to be wrecked on such a good one.\"  \"Lucky, indeed!\" agreed the Captain. \"Why, when I discovered those eggs on a rocky ledge, I knew at once they were gulls' eggs.\"  \"And how fortunate that they're boiled,\" said Kitty. \"I can't bear raw eggs.\"  The shipwrecked sufferers then spread out their food, and sat down to a pleasant meal, for the Maynard children had convenient appetites, and could eat at almost any hour of the day.     CHAPTER II  AN EXASPERATING GUEST   \"Aren't hard-boiled eggs the very best things to eat in all the world?\" said Marjorie, as she looked lovingly at the golden sphere she had just extracted from its ivory setting.  \"They're awful good,\" agreed King, \"but I like oranges better.\"  \"Me eat lollunge,\" piped up Rosy Posy. \"Buffaro Bill would 'ike a lollunge.\"  \"So you shall, Baby. Brother'll fix one for you.\"  And the shipwrecked Captain carefully prepared an orange, and gave it bit by bit into the eager, rosy fingers.  \"Of all things in the world,\" said Kitty, \"I like chocolate creams best.\"  \"Oh, so do I, if I'm not hungry!\" said Marjorie. \"I think I like different things at different times.\"  \"Well, it doesn't matter much what you like now,\" said King, as he gave the last section of orange to Rosy Posy, \"for everything is all eaten up. Where'd you get those eggs, Mops? We never hardly have them except on picnics.\"  \"I saw them in the pantry. Ellen had them for a salad or something. So I just took them, and told her she could boil some more.\"  \"You're a good one, Mopsy,\" said her brother, looking at her in evident admiration. \"The servants never get mad at you. Now if I had hooked those eggs, Ellen would have blown me up sky-high.\"  \"Oh, I just smiled at her,\" said Marjorie, \"and then it was all right. Now, what are we going to do next?\"  \"Hark!\" said Kingdon, who was again the shipwrecked mariner. \"I hear a distant sound as of fierce wild beasts growling and roaring.\"  \"My child, my child!\" shrieked Kitty, snatching up Arabella. \"She will be torn by dreadful lions and tigers!\"  \"We must protect ourselves,\" declared Marjorie. \"Captain, can't you build a barricade? They always do that in books.\"  \"Ay, ay, ma'am. But also we must hoist a flag, a signal of distress. For should a ship come by, they might stop and rescue us.\"  \"But we have no flag. What can we use for one?\"  \"Give me your daughter's petticoat,\" said the Captain to Kitty.  \"Not so!\" said Kitty, who was fond of dramatic phrases. \"Arabella's petticoat is spandy clean, and I won't have it used to make a flag.\"  \"I'll give you a flag,\" said Marjorie. \"Take my hair-ribbon.\" She began to pull off her red ribbon, but Kingdon stopped her.  \"No,\" he said, \"that won't do. We're not playing Pirates. It must be a white flag. It's for a signal of distress.\"  Marjorie thought a moment. There really seemed to be no white flag available.  \"All right!\" she cried, in a moment. \"I'll give you a piece of my petticoat. It's an old one, and the ruffle is torn anyhow.\"  In a flash, impetuous Marjorie had torn a good-sized bit out of her little white petticoat, and the Captain fastened it to a long branch he had broken from the maple tree.  This he managed, with the aid of some stones, to fasten in an upright position, and then they sat down to watch for a passing sail.  \"Buffaro Bill so s'eepy,\" announced that small person, and, with fat old Boffin for a pillow, Rosy Posy calmly dropped off into a morning nap.  But the others suffered various dreadful vicissitudes. They were attacked by wild beasts, which, though entirely imaginary, required almost as much killing as if they had been real.  Kitty shot or lassoed a great many, but she declined to engage in the hand-to-hand encounters with tigers and wolves, such as Marjorie and Kingdon undertook, for fear she'd be thrown down on the ground. And, indeed, her fears were well founded, for the valiant fighters were often thrown by their fierce adversaries, and rolled over and over, only to pick themselves up and renew the fray.  More exciting still was an attack from the natives of the island. They were horrible savages, with tomahawks, and they approached with blood-curdling yells.  Needless to say that, after a fearful battle, the natives were all slain or put to rout, and the conquerors, exhausted but triumphant, sat round their camp-fire and boasted of their valorous deeds.  As noontime drew near, the settlers on the island began to grow hungry again, and, strange to say, the imaginary birds they shot and ate were not entirely satisfying.  Buffalo Bill, too, waked up, and demanded a jink of water.  But none could leave the island and brave the perils of the boundless ocean, unless in a rescuing ship.  For a long time they waited. They waved their white flag, and they even shouted for help.  But the \"island\" was at some distance from the house or street and none came to rescue them.  At last, they saw a huge, white-covered wagon slowly moving along the back drive.  \"A sail! A sail!\" cried the Captain. \"What, ho! Help! Help!\"  The other shipwrecked ones joined the cry, and soon the wagon drew a little nearer, and then stopped.  \"Help! Help!\" cried the children in chorus.  It was the butcher's wagon, and they knew it well, but this season there was a new driver who didn't know the Maynard children.  \"What's the matther?\" he cried, jumping from his seat, and running across the grass to the quartette.  \"We're shipwrecked!\" cried Marjorie. \"We can't get home. Oh, save us from a cruel fate! Carry us back to our far-away fireside!\"  \"Help!\" cried Kitty, faintly. \"My child is ill, and I can no longer survive!\"  Dramatic Kitty sank in a heap on the ground, and the butcher's boy was more bewildered than ever.  \"Save me!\" cried Rosy Posy, toddling straight to him, and putting up her arms. \"Save"]]]
