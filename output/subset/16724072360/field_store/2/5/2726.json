It even breathes--pinholed elastiskin with a static adherence-charge. But Micro Systems had nothing to do with it, thank God. Beauty Trix put it on the market ten days ago and it's already started a teen-age craze. Some boys are wearing them too, and the police are yipping at Trix for encouraging transvestism with psychic repercussions.\"  \"Didn't I hear somewhere that Trix is a secret subsidiary of Micro?\" Gusterson demanded, rearing up from his ancient electric typewriter. \"No, you're not stopping me writing, Fay--it's the gut of evening. If I do any more I won't have any juice to start with tomorrow. I got another of my insanity thrillers moving. A real id-teaser. In this one not only all the characters are crazy but the robot psychiatrist too.\"  \"The vending machines are jumping with insanity novels,\" Fay commented. \"Odd they're so popular.\"  Gusterson chortled. \"The only way you outer-directed moles will accept individuality any more even in a fictional character, without your superegos getting seasick, is for them to be crazy. Hey, Daisy! Lemme see that beauty mask!\"  But his wife, backing out of the room, hugged the package to her bosom and solemnly shook her head.  \"A hell of a thing,\" Gusterson complained, \"not even to be able to see what my stolen ideas look like.\"  \"I got a present for you too,\" Fay said. \"Something you might think of as a royalty on all the inventions someone thought of a little ahead of you. Fifty dollars by your own evaluation.\" He held out the smaller package. \"Your tickler.\"  \"My _what_?\" Gusterson demanded suspiciously.  \"Your tickler. The mech reminder you wanted. It turns out that the file a secretary keeps to remind her boss to do certain things at certain times is called a tickler file. So we named this a tickler. Here.\"  Gusterson still didn't touch the package. \"You mean you actually put your invention team to work on that nonsense?\"  \"Well, what do you think? Don't be scared of it. Here, I'll show you.\"  As he unwrapped the package, Fay said, \"It hasn't been decided yet whether we'll manufacture it commercially. If we do, I'll put through a voucher for you--for 'development consultation' or something like that. Sorry no royalty's possible. Davidson's squad had started to work up the identical idea three years ago, but it got shelved. I found it on a snoop through the closets. There! Looks rich, doesn't it?\"         *       *       *       *       *  On the scarred black tabletop was a dully gleaming silvery object about the size and shape of a cupped hand with fingers merging. A tiny pellet on a short near-invisible wire led off from it. On the back was a punctured area suggesting the face of a microphone; there was also a window with a date and time in hours and minutes showing through and next to that four little buttons in a row. The concave underside of the silvery \"hand\" was smooth except for a central area where what looked like two little rollers came through.  \"It goes on your shoulder under your shirt,\" Fay explained, \"and you tuck the pellet in your ear. We might work up bone conduction on a commercial model. Inside is an ultra-slow fine-wire recorder holding a spool that runs for a week. The clock lets you go to any place on the 7-day wire and record a message. The buttons give you variable speed in going there, so you don't waste too much time making a setting. There's a knack in fingering them efficiently, but it's easily acquired.\"  Fay picked up the tickler. \"For instance, suppose there's a TV show you want to catch tomorrow night at twenty-two hundred.\" He touched the buttons. There was the faintest whirring. The clock face blurred briefly three times before showing the setting he'd mentioned. Then Fay spoke into the punctured area: \"Turn on TV Channel Two, you big dummy!\" He grinned over at Gusterson. \"When you've got all your instructions to yourself loaded in, you synchronize with the present moment and let her roll. Fit it on your shoulder and forget it. Oh, yes, and it literally does tickle you every time it delivers an instruction. That's what the little rollers are for. Believe me, you can't ignore it. Come on, Gussy, take off your shirt and try it out. We'll feed in some instructions for the next ten minutes so you get the feel of how it works.\"  \"I don't want to,\" Gusterson said. \"Not right now. I want to sniff around it first. My God, it's small! Besides everything else it does, does it think?\"  \"Don't pretend to be an idiot, Gussy! You know very well that even with ultra-sub-micro nothing quite this small can possibly have enough elements to do any thinking.\"  Gusterson shrugged. \"I don't know about that. I think bugs think.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Fay groaned faintly. \"Bugs operate by instinct, Gussy,\" he said. \"A patterned routine. They do not scan situations and consequences and then make decisions.\"  \"I don't expect bugs to make decisions,\" Gusterson said. \"For that matter I don't like people who go around alla time making decisions.\"  \"Well, you can take it from me, Gussy, that this tickler is just a miniaturized wire recorder and clock ... and a tickler. It doesn't do anything else.\"  \"Not yet, maybe,\" Gusterson said darkly. \"Not this model. Fay, I'm serious about bugs thinking. Or if they don't exactly think, they feel. They've got an interior drama. An inner glow. They're conscious. For that matter, Fay, I think all your really complex electronic computers are conscious too.\"  \"Quit kidding, Gussy.\"  \"Who's kidding?\"  \"You are. Computers simply aren't alive.\"  \"What's alive? A word. I think computers are conscious, at least while they're operating. They've got that inner glow of awareness. They sort of ... well ... meditate.\"  \"Gussy, computers haven't got any circuits for meditating. They're not programmed for mystical lucubrations. They've just got circuits for solving the problems they're on.\"  \"Okay, you admit they've got problem-solving circuits--like a man has. I say if they've got the equipment for being conscious, they're conscious. What has wings, flies.\"  \"Including stuffed owls and gilt eagles and dodoes--and wood-burning airplanes?\"  \"Maybe, under some circumstances. There _was_ a wood-burning airplane. Fay,\" Gusterson continued, wagging his wrists for emphasis, \"I really think computers are conscious. They just don't have any way of telling us that they are. Or maybe they don't have any _reason_ to tell us, like the little Scotch boy who didn't say a word until he was fifteen and was supposed to be deaf and dumb.\"  \"Why didn't he say a word?\"  \"Because he'd never had anything to say. Or take those Hindu fakirs, Fay, who sit still and don't say a word for thirty years or until their fingernails grow to the next village. If Hindu fakirs can do that, computers can!\"  Looking as if he were masticating a lemon, Fay asked quietly, \"Gussy, did you say you're working on an insanity novel?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Gusterson frowned fiercely. \"Now you're kidding,\" he accused Fay. \"The dirty kind of kidding, too.\"  \"I'm sorry,\" Fay said with light contrition. \"Well, now you've sniffed at it, how about trying on Tickler?\" He picked up the gleaming blunted crescent and jogged it temptingly under Gusterson's chin.  \"Why should I?\" Gusterson asked, stepping back. \"Fay, I'm up to my ears writing a book. The last thing I want is something interrupting me to make me listen to a lot of junk and do a lot of useless things.\"  \"But, dammit, Gussy! It was all your idea in the first place!\" Fay blatted. Then, catching himself, he added, \"I mean, you were one of the first people to think of this particular sort of instrument.\"  \"Maybe so, but I've done some more thinking since then.\" Gusterson's voice grew a trifle solemn. \"Inner-directed worthwhile thinkin'. Fay, when a man forgets to do something, it's because he really doesn't want to do it or because he's all roiled up down in his unconscious. He ought to take it as a danger signal and investigate the roiling, not hire himself a human or mech reminder.\"  \"Bushwa,\" Fay retorted. \"In that case you shouldn't write memorandums or even take notes.\"  \"Maybe I shouldn't,\" Gusterson agreed lamely. \"I'd have to think that over too.\"  \"Ha!\" Fay jeered. \"No, I'll tell you what your trouble is, Gussy. You're simply scared of this contraption. You've loaded your skull with horror-story nonsense about machines sprouting minds and taking over the world--until you're even scared of a simple miniaturized and clocked recorder.\" He thrust it out.  \"Maybe I am,\" Gusterson admitted, controlling a flinch. \"Honestly, Fay, that thing's got a gleam in its eye as if it had ideas of its own. Nasty ideas.\"  \"Gussy, you nut, it hasn't _got_ an eye.\"  \"Not now, no, but it's got the gleam--the eye may come. It's the Cheshire cat in reverse. If you'd step over here and look at yourself holding it, you could see what I mean. But I don't think computers _sprout_ minds, Fay. I just think they've _got_ minds, because they've got the mind elements.\"  \"Ho, ho!\" Fay mocked. \"Everything that has a material side has a mental side,\" he chanted. \"Everything that's a body is also a spirit. Gussy, that dubious old metaphysical dualism went out centuries ago.\"  \"Maybe so,\" Gusterson said, \"but we still haven't anything but that dubious dualism to explain the human mind, have we? It's a jelly of nerve cells and it's a vision of the cosmos. If that isn't dualism, what is?\"  \"I give up. Gussy, are you going to try out this tickler?\"  \"No!\"  "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23164"],["title","The Creature from Cleveland Depths (#2)"],["body","\"But dammit, Gussy, we made it just for you!--practically.\"  \"Sorry, but I'm not coming near the thing.\"  \"Zen come near me,\" a husky voice intoned behind them. \"Tonight I vant a man.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Standing in the door was something slim in a short silver sheath. It had golden bangs and the haughtiest snub-nosed face in the world. It slunk toward them.  \"My God, Vina Vidarsson!\" Gusterson yelled.  \"Daisy, that's terrific,\" Fay applauded, going up to her.  She bumped him aside with a swing of her hips, continuing to advance. \"Not you, Ratty,\" she said throatily. \"I vant a real man.\"  \"Fay, I suggested Vina Vidarsson's face for the beauty mask,\" Gusterson said, walking around his wife and shaking a finger. \"Don't tell me Trix just happened to think of that too.\"  \"What else could they think of?\" Fay laughed. \"This season sex means VV and nobody else.\" An odd little grin flicked his lips, a tic traveled up his face and his body twitched slightly. \"Say, folks, I'm going to have to be leaving. It's exactly fifteen minutes to Second Curfew. Last time I had to run and I got heartburn. When _are_ you people going to move downstairs? I'll leave Tickler, Gussy. Play around with it and get used to it. 'By now.\"  \"Hey, Fay,\" Gusterson called curiously, \"have you developed absolute time sense?\"  Fay grinned a big grin from the doorway--almost too big a grin for so small a man. \"I didn't need to,\" he said softly, patting his right shoulder. \"My tickler told me.\"  He closed the door behind him.  As side-by-side they watched him strut sedately across the murky chilly-looking park, Gusterson mused, \"So the little devil had one of those nonsense-gadgets on all the time and I never noticed. Can you beat that?\" Something drew across the violet-tinged stars a short bright line that quickly faded. \"What's that?\" Gusterson asked gloomily. \"Next to last stage of missile-here?\"  \"Won't you settle for an old-fashioned shooting star?\" Daisy asked softly. The (wettable) velvet lips of the mask made even her natural voice sound different. She reached a hand back of her neck to pull the thing off.  \"Hey, don't do that,\" Gusterson protested in a hurt voice. \"Not for a while anyway.\"  \"Hokay!\" she said harshly, turning on him. \"Zen down on your knees, dog!\"     III   It was a fortnight and Gusterson was loping down the home stretch on his 40,000-word insanity novel before Fay dropped in again, this time promptly at high noon.  Normally Fay cringed his shoulders a trifle and was inclined to slither, but now he strode aggressively, his legs scissoring in a fast, low goosestep. He whipped off the sunglasses that all moles wore topside by day and began to pound Gusterson on the back while calling boisterously, \"How are you, Gussy Old Boy, Old Boy?\"  Daisy came in from the kitchen to see why Gusterson was choking. She was instantly grabbed and violently bussed to the accompaniment of, \"Hiya, Gorgeous! Yum-yum! How about ad-libbing that some weekend?\"  She stared at Fay dazedly, rasping the back of her hand across her mouth, while Gusterson yelled, \"Quit that! What's got into you, Fay? Have they transferred you out of R & D to Company Morale? Do they line up all the secretaries at roll call and make you give them an eight-hour energizing kiss?\"  \"Ha, wouldn't you like to know?\" Fay retorted. He grinned, twitched jumpingly, held still a moment, then hustled over to the far wall. \"Look out there,\" he rapped, pointing through the violet glass at a gap between the two nearest old skyscraper apartments. \"In thirty seconds you'll see them test the new needle bomb at the other end of Lake Erie. It's educational.\" He began to count off seconds, vigorously semaphoring his arm. \"... Two ... three ... Gussy, I've put through a voucher for two yards for you. Budgeting squawked, but I pressured 'em.\"  Daisy squealed, \"Yards!--are those dollar thousands?\" while Gusterson was asking, \"Then you're marketing the tickler?\"  \"Yes. Yes,\" Fay replied to them in turn. \"... Nine ... ten ...\" Again he grinned and twitched. \"Time for noon Com-staff,\" he announced staccato. \"Pardon the hush box.\" He whipped a pancake phone from under his coat, clapped it over his face and spoke fiercely but inaudibly into it, continuing to semaphore. Suddenly he thrust the phone away. \"Twenty-nine ... thirty ... Thar she blows!\"  An incandescent streak shot up the sky from a little above the far horizon and a doubly dazzling point of light appeared just above the top of it, with the effect of God dotting an \"i\".  \"Ha, that'll skewer espionage satellites like swatting flies!\" Fay proclaimed as the portent faded. \"Bracing! Gussy, where's your tickler? I've got a new spool for it that'll razzle-dazzle you.\"  \"I'll bet,\" Gusterson said drily. \"Daisy?\"  \"You gave it to the kids and they got to fooling with it and broke it.\"  \"No matter,\" Fay told them with a large sidewise sweep of his hand. \"Better you wait for the new model. It's a six-way improvement.\"  \"So I gather,\" Gusterson said, eyeing him speculatively. \"Does it automatically inject you with cocaine? A fix every hour on the second?\"  \"Ha-ha, joke. Gussy, it achieves the same effect without using any dope at all. Listen: a tickler reminds you of your duties and opportunities--your chances for happiness and success! What's the obvious next step?\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"Throw it out the window. By the way, how do you do that when you're underground?\"  \"We have hi-speed garbage boosts. The obvious next step is you give the tickler a heart. It not only tells you, it warmly persuades you. It doesn't just say, 'Turn on the TV Channel Two, Joyce program,' it _brills_ at you, 'Kid, Old Kid, race for the TV and flip that Two Switch! There's a great show coming through the pipes this second plus ten--you'll enjoy the hell out of yourself! Grab a ticket to ecstasy!'\"  \"My God,\" Gusterson gasped, \"are those the kind of jolts it's giving you now?\"  \"Don't you get it, Gussy? You never load your tickler except when you're feeling buoyantly enthusiastic. You don't just tell yourself what to do hour by hour next week, you sell yourself on it. That way you not only make doubly sure you'll obey instructions but you constantly reinoculate yourself with your own enthusiasm.\"  \"I can't stand myself when I'm that enthusiastic,\" Gusterson said. \"I feel ashamed for hours afterwards.\"  \"You're warped--all this lonely sky-life. What's more, Gussy, think how still more persuasive some of those instructions would be if they came to a man in his best girl's most bedroomy voice, or his doctor's or psycher's if it's that sort of thing--or Vina Vidarsson's! By the way, Daze, don't wear that beauty mask outside. It's a grand misdemeanor ever since ten thousand teen-agers rioted through Tunnel-Mart wearing them. And VV's sueing Trix.\"  \"No chance of that,\" Daisy said. \"Gusterson got excited and bit off the nose.\" She pinched her own delicately.  \"I'd no more obey my enthusiastic self,\" Gusterson was brooding, \"than I'd obey a Napoleon drunk on his own brandy or a hopped-up St. Francis. Reinoculated with my own enthusiasm? I'd die just like from snake-bite!\"  \"Warped, I said,\" Fay dogmatized, stamping around. \"Gussy, having the instructions persuasive instead of neutral turned out to be only the opening wedge. The next step wasn't so obvious, but I saw it. Using subliminal verbal stimuli in his tickler, a man can be given constant supportive euphoric therapy 24 hours a day! And it makes use of all that empty wire. We've revived the ideas of a pioneer dynamic psycher named Dr. Coué. For instance, right now my tickler is saying to me--in tones too soft to reach my conscious mind, but do they stab into the unconscious!--'Day by day in every way I'm getting sharper and sharper.' It alternates that with 'gutsier and gutsier' and ... well, forget that. Coué mostly used 'better and better' but that seems too general. And every hundredth time it says them out loud and the tickler gives me a brush--just a faint cootch--to make sure I'm keeping in touch.\"  \"That third word-pair,\" Daisy wondered, feeling her mouth reminiscently. \"Could I guess?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Gusterson's eyes had been growing wider and wider. \"Fay,\" he said, \"I could no more use my mind for anything if I knew all that was going on in my inner ear than if I were being brushed down with brooms by three witches. Look here,\" he said with loud authority, \"you got to stop all this--it's crazy. Fay, if Micro'll junk the tickler, I'll think you up something else to invent--something real good.\"  \"Your inventing days are over,\" Fay brilled gleefully. \"I mean, you'll never equal your masterpiece.\"  \"How about,\" Gusterson bellowed, \"an anti-individual guided missile? The physicists have got small-scale antigravity good enough to float and fly something the size of a hand grenade. I can smell that even though it's a back-of-the-safe military secret. Well, how about keying such a missile to a man's finger-prints--or brainwaves, maybe, or his unique smell!--so it can spot and follow him around then target in on him, without harming anyone else? Long-distance assassination--and the stinkingest gets it! Or you could simply load it with some disgusting goo and key it to teen-agers as a group--that'd take care of them. Fay, doesn't it give you a rich warm kick to think of my midget missiles buzzing around in your tunnels, seeking out evil-doers, like a swarm of angry wasps or angelic bumblebees?\"  \"You're not luring me down any side trails,\" Fay said laughingly. He grinned and twitched, then hurried toward the opposite wall, motioning them to follow. Outside, about a hundred yards beyond the purple glass, rose another ancient glass-walled apartment skyscraper. Beyond, Lake Erie rippled glintingly.  \"Another bomb-test?\" Gusterson asked.  Fay pointed at the building. \"Tomorrow,\" he announced, \"a modern factory, devoted solely to the manufacture of"]]]
