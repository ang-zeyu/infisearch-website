Klaft and the police officers peered from their respective windows, in calculated withdrawal. Kinton, disturbed, tried to remember whether he had spoken in Terran or Tepoktan.  Would Birken listen if he tried reasoning, he asked himself. Maybe if he showed the man how they had proved the unpredictability of openings through the shifting Dome of Eyes--  An exclamation from the constable drew his attention. He rose, and room was made for him at the opposite window.         *       *       *       *       *  In the distance, beyond the town landing field they were now approaching, Kinton saw a halted ground car. Across the plain which was colored a yellowish tan by a short, grass-like growth, a lone figure plodded toward the upthrust bulk of the spaceship that had never flown.  \"Never mind landing at the town!\" snapped Kinton. \"Go directly out to the ship!\"  Klaft relayed the command to the pilot. The helicopter swept in a descending curve across the plain toward the gleaming hull.  As they passed the man below, Birken looked up. He continued to limp along at a brisk pace with the aid of what looked like a short spear.  \"Go down!\" Kinton ordered.  The pilot landed about a hundred yards from the spaceship. By the time his passengers had alighted, however, Birken had drawn level with them, about fifty feet away.  \"Birken!\" shouted Kinton. \"Where do you think you're going?\"  Seeing that no one ran after him, Birken slowed his pace, but kept walking toward the ship. He watched them over his shoulder.  \"Sorry, Kinton,\" he shouted with no noticeable tone of regret. \"I figure I better travel on for my health.\"  \"It's not so damn healthy up there!\" called Kinton. \"I told you how there's no clear path--\"  \"Yeah, yeah, you told me. That don't mean I gotta believe it.\"  \"Wait! Don't you think they tried sending unmanned rockets up? Every one was struck and exploded.\"  Birken showed no more change of expression than if the other had commented on the weather.  Kinton had stepped forward six or eight paces, irritated despite his anxiety at the way Birken persisted in drifting before him.  Kinton couldn't just grab him--bad leg or not, he could probably break the older man in two.  He glanced back at the Tepoktans beside the helicopter, Klaft, the pilot, the officer, the constable with the rocket weapon.  They stood quietly, looking back at him.  The call for help that had risen to his lips died there.  \"Not _their_ party,\" he muttered. He turned again to Birken, who still retreated toward the ship. \"But he'll only get himself killed _and_ destroy the ship! Or if some miracle gets him through, that's worse! He's nothing to turn loose on a civilized colony again.\"         *       *       *       *       *  A twinge of shame tugged down the corners of his mouth as he realized that keeping Birken here would also expose a highly cultured people to an unscrupulous criminal who had already committed murder the very first time he had been crossed.  \"Birken!\" he shouted. \"For the last time! Do you want me to send them to drag you back here?\"  Birken stopped at that. He regarded the motionless Tepoktans with a derisive sneer.  \"They don't look too eager to me,\" he taunted.  Kinton growled a Tepoktan expression the meaning of which he had deduced after hearing it used by the dam workers.  He whirled to run toward the helicopter. Hardly had he taken two steps, however, when he saw startled changes in the carefully blank looks of his escort. The constable half raised his heavy weapon, and Klaft sprang forward with a hissing cry.  By the time Kinton's aging muscles obeyed his impulse to sidestep, the spear had already hurtled past. It had missed him by an error of over six feet.  He felt his face flushing with sudden anger. Birken was running as best he could toward the spaceship, and had covered nearly half the distance.  Kinton ran at the Tepoktans, brushing aside the concerned Klaft. He snatched the heavy weapon from the surprised constable.  He turned and raised it to his chest. Because of the shortness of Tepoktan arms, the launcher was constructed so that the butt rested against the chest with the sighting loops before the eyes. The little rocket tubes were above head height, to prevent the handler's catching the blast.  The circles of the sights weaved and danced about the running figure. Kinton realized to his surprise that the effort of seizing the weapon had him panting. Or was it the fright at having a spear thrown at him? He decided that Birken had not come close enough for that, and wondered if he was afraid of his own impending action.  It wasn't fair, he complained to himself. The poor slob only had a spear, and a man couldn't blame him for wanting to get back to his own sort. He was limping ... hurt ... how could they expect him to realize--?  Then, abruptly, his lips tightened to a thin line. The sights steadied on Birken as the latter approached the foot of the ladder leading to the entrance port of the spaceship.  Kinton pressed the firing stud.  Across the hundred-yard space streaked four flaring little projectiles. Kinton, without exactly seeing each, was aware of the general lines of flight diverging gradually to bracket the figure of Birken.  One struck the ground beside the man just as he set one foot on the bottom rung of the ladder, and skittered away past one fin of the ship before exploding. Two others burst against the hull, scattering metal fragments, and another puffed on the upright of the ladder just above Birken's head.         *       *       *       *       *  The spaceman was blown back from the ladder. He balanced on his heels for a moment with outstretched fingers reaching toward the grips from which they had been torn. Then he crumpled into a limp huddle on the yellowing turf.  Kinton sighed.  The constable took the weapon from him, reloaded deftly, and proffered it again. When the Terran did not reach for it, the officer held out a clawed hand to receive it. He gestured silently, and the constable trotted across the intervening ground to bend over Birken.  \"He is dead,\" said Klaft when the constable straightened up with a curt wave.  \"Will ... will you have someone see to him, please?\" Kinton requested, turning toward the helicopter.  \"Yes, George,\" said Klaft. \"George...?\"  \"Well?\"  \"It would be very instructive--that is, I believe Dr. Chuxolkhee would like to--\"  \"All right!\" yielded Kinton, surprised at the harshness of his own voice. \"Just tell him not to bring around any sketches of the various organs for a few months!\"  He climbed into the helicopter and slumped into his seat. Presently, he was aware of Klaft edging into the seat across the aisle. He looked up.  \"The police will stay until cars from town arrive. They are coming now,\" said his aide.         *       *       *       *       *  Kinton stared at his hands, wondering at the fact that they were not shaking. He felt dejected, empty, not like a man who had just been at a high pitch of excitement.  \"Why did you not let him go, George?\"  \"What? Why ... why ... he would have destroyed the ship you worked so hard to build. There is no safe path through the Dome of Eyes.\"  \"No predictable path,\" Klaft corrected. \"But what then? We would have built you another ship, George, for it was you who showed us how.\"  Kinton flexed his fingers slowly.  \"He was just no good. You know the murder he did here; we can only guess what he did among my own ... among Terrans. Should he have a chance to go back and commit more crimes?\"  \"I understand, George, the logic of it,\" said Klaft. \"I meant ... it is not my place to say this ... but you seem unhappy.\"  \"Possibly,\" grunted Kinton wrily.  \"We, too, have criminals,\" said the aide, as gently as was possible in his clicking language. \"We do not think it necessary to grieve for the pain they bring upon themselves.\"  \"No, I suppose not,\" sighed Kinton. \"I ... it's just--\"  He looked up at the pointed visage, at the strange eyes regarding him sympathetically from beneath the sloping, purple-scaled forehead.  \"It's just that now I'm lonely ... again,\" he said.

The twentieth century looms before us big with the fate of many nations. If we stand idly by, if we seek merely swollen, slothful ease and ignoble peace, if we shrink from the hard contests where men must win at hazard of their lives and at the risk of all they hold dear, then the bolder and stronger peoples will pass us by and will win for themselves the domination of the world. Let us therefore boldly face the life of strife, resolute to do our duty well and manfully; resolute to uphold righteousness by deed and by word; resolute to be both honest and brave, to serve high ideals, yet to use practical methods. Above all, let us not shrink from strife, moral or physical, within or without the nation, provided that we are certain that the strife is justified; for it is only through strife, through hard and dangerous endeavor, that we shall ultimately win the goal of true national greatness.\"  These words, taken from President Roosevelt's remarkable speech on \"The Strenuous Life,\" show well the character of the man, his lofty ideals, his sterling courage, his absolute honesty, and unwavering patriotism. He is a typical American in the best sense of the word, and his life is worthy of careful study. From it American boys of to-day, and in generations to come, may gain lessons that will do them much good.  Theodore Roosevelt, the twenty-sixth President of our country, was born in New York City, October 27, 1858. The place of his birth was the old family mansion at 28 East Twentieth Street, in a neighborhood which, at that time, was the abode of wealth and culture. The building is one of a row, of a type to be seen in hundreds of other places, of brick and stone, four stories and a basement high, the upper floor being an attic. A heavy railing runs from in front of the basement up the broad front steps to the doorway. Inside, the rooms are large and comfortably arranged, and there was, in those days, quite a nice garden in the rear.  [Illustration: THEODORE ROOSEVELT'S BIRTHPLACE. 28 E. 20TH STREET, NEW YORK CITY.]  It can truthfully be said that Theodore Roosevelt comes from a race of soldiers and statesmen, and that Dutch, Scotch, French, and Irish blood flows in his veins. This being so, it is no wonder that, when the"]]]
