No, I don't s'pect she'll _ever_ go home,\" said Flaxie, shaking her little head sadly.  \"Well, she's gone now, ain't she, this whole afternoon? And why can't you come up to my house and see me?\"  Flaxie knew why. It was because she ought to help amuse the baby. Dora had been making peach preserves all day, and it was too hard for Grandma Gray to take care of Phil alone. But Flaxie asked all the same, \"May I go?\" and grandma never could say \"no\" when little folks teased, so she answered, \"Yes, and stay till half-past four; no longer.\"  Nothing was said about supper; but the children thought there would be time enough for that, and breakfast too, almost--it seemed so very long till half-past four.  \"Very well,\" said Patty's mother, when they went into the smoky kitchen, where she was holding the baby that had four teeth. \"Very well, you may both run out to play, and when it is time to call you in, I'll ring the bell.\"  There wasn't much to play with, except sand right in the middle of the road; but Flaxie had never been allowed as much dirt as she wanted, and this seemed very pleasant for a change. It would have been pleasanter still if her conscience had felt easy. She was only six years old, but she knew perfectly well when her actions were right and when they were wrong.  \"I never saw such a splendid visit,\" said she, when Mr. Proudfit kindly allowed her and Patty to feed the pigs. \"But _don't_ they have the awfullest-looking smell?\" added she, gazing thoughtfully into the pen, which was dirty, like everything else about the place. Her own nice frock was already soiled, but she tried not to see it, and not to think how Auntie Prim would stare at it through her spectacles.  \"Why, what's that?\" said she.  It was, oh dear! it was the bell; and there was Mrs. Proudfit at the back door ringing it. Grown people are always thinking what time it is; they never forget.  \"I'm sorry you can't stay to tea, Miss Flaxie,\" said Mrs. Proudfit, politely.  \"Oh, I guess I can; I'll go ask grammy,\" replied the little girl, dashing off up the hill, followed by Patty.  \"Oh, grammy, they want me to stay _orf'ly_,\" she cried, out of breath, before they got to the house.  \"Well, stay another hour, then,\" said the dear grandma, though baby was very cross and her arms ached, and Flaxie could have been _such_ a help.  So Flaxie went back and stayed another hour, and _then_ it wasn't tea-time. She could see some blue and white dishes spread on a round table covered with an oil-cloth, and she could smell gingerbread baking in the oven, which made her very hungry; and just as Mrs. Proudfit was opening a can of preserves, with at least six children clinging to her skirts, who should come but Preston, to say it was half-past five and Flaxie was wanted at home.  \"So you can't stay to tea, after all,\" said Mrs. Proudfit, putting a small covered dish on the table. What in the world could be in it?  Flaxie dropped her head and blushed. \"Oh, yes'm, I can stay. I've sent Preston home, and locked the door!\"  Mrs. Proudfit smiled into the oven as she looked at her gingerbread, and thought--of course she did--that Flaxie Frizzle was a very queer child.  It did seem as if that gingerbread never would bake! A cloud came up, the wind blew, the baby cried so Patty couldn't play, the children quarrelled, and the kitten ran round in a fit.  Nothing seemed half as nice as it had seemed an hour ago; and when supper was ready, that gingerbread was burnt, and, as true as you live, the preserves were sour! There was nothing in the little covered dish but cheese, which Flaxie \"despised;\" and she wished she hadn't stayed to tea, for it was a very poor tea indeed.  It began to rain just as hard as it could pour, and Dr. Papa came for her in the carriage, without a single smile on his face.  When she got home there was mamma, looking grieved and surprised,--the dear mamma she hadn't seen for three weeks. And there was \"Ninny,\" her sweet sister Julia, who had come and found out about her actions, and brought her a new doll.  \"Baby has cut a tooth, too,\" said Auntie Prim; \"but he's asleep now, and you can't see it to-night.\"  This was the last drop.  \"I feel as if my heart was breaking,\" sobbed Flaxie, tottering up-stairs behind her mother. \"I don't care if Baby Proudfit _has_ got fo--ur teeth; they're _very_ small!\"  \"I'm afraid you didn't have a good time, dear?\"  \"No'm, for Baby Proudfit's _so_ squirmy and wigglesome! But they wanted me to stay _orf'ly_!\"  \"And oh, mamma,\" burst forth Flaxie, at last, \"if you'll forgive me, I'll never stay _anywhere_ to tea any more, as long as I live!\"  \"We'll talk about it to-morrow,\" said Mrs. Gray.  And then she put poor little Flaxie to bed.     CHAPTER III.  THE LONESOME VISIT.   Flaxie came down to breakfast next morning feeling rather humble, but nobody noticed her, for they were all talking about the cat. The cellar-door had been left unfastened, and Kitty Gray had come up about midnight bringing a nice fat mouse. She mewed a long time, hoping her mistress would get out of bed and stroke her, and say, \"Good pussy, pretty pussy!\" But as Mrs. Gray would not rise, what do you think Kitty Gray did, for this is a true story?  She just walked into the dining-room where the table was always set overnight, jumped up to Mrs. Gray's place by the waiter, and dropped the mouse beside her plate!  \"There,\" thought pussy, \"she'll see it now first thing in the morning, before she turns the coffee; and if she doesn't say 'Good pussy, pretty pussy,' why--I'll eat it!\"  Of course when Mrs. Gray saw such a droll morsel lying on her napkin she laughed, sent for Kitty Gray, stroked her, and called her \"Good pussy, pretty pussy; and the brightest pussy too that I ever saw!\"  Even Mrs. Prim was laughing, and Flaxie began to hope her own behavior of yesterday was forgotten. But no, her mother called her into the nursery after breakfast, and said, as she took her in her lap:  \"I am sorry to hear that my little girl has done so many wrong things since I have been gone.\"  Flaxie dropped her head for shame, but raised it again indignantly.  \"How'd you know that, mamma? Auntie Prim must have gone and told.\"  \"Yes, darling, I asked her to tell. Isn't it right for mamma to know all her child has been doing?\"  \"Yes'm,\" replied Flaxie, watching a fly walk on the ceiling.  \"And I thought perhaps you would like to talk with me about it, dear.\"  \"One, two, three, four, five,\" said Flaxie to herself, counting the rosebuds in the carpet. Strange her mamma should suppose she wanted to talk about it! Why, there wasn't a subject in the world so disagreeable as her own naughtiness!  Mrs. Gray waited patiently till the rosebuds were counted, and then Flaxie spoke.  \"O mamma, you think I was bad yesterday, but do you _s'pose_ I'd have gone off if I'd known my little brother's tooth was a-cutting?\"  Mrs. Gray smiled down at the innocent, upturned face.  \"Well, darling, whether he cut a tooth or not, had you any excuse for staying to tea?\"  \"No'm. They didn't have a bit good supper at Patty's house, and I oughtn't to have stayed.\"  \"Mary,\" said Mrs. Gray,--she thought her little daughter was old enough now to be called by her true name, so she never used the baby name of Flaxie Frizzle,--\"Mary, I do not wish you to play any more with this little girl till I have seen her.\"  \"No'm.\"  \"Have you anything else to tell me?\"  \"I don' know. Well, yes. Well, I--I--I am so sorry I ran away from my party, mamma. Ever so long ago. I s'pect Auntie Prim told of that too?\" said Flaxie, twisting herself into odd shapes, for the thought of that unfortunate affair filled her with shame.  \"Yes, Mary, she did.\"  \"Well, I felt so sorry, mamma. And Milly 'n' I, we didn't get but one tart and one piece o' cake; for auntie had a party with 'em her own self. Do you think 'twas right when she made 'em for Milly and me?\"  Here Flaxie's eyes flashed.  \"My child, we are talking of you now, not Auntie Prim.\"  \"Yes'm, I know it, and I'm real sorry I'm so naughty; but Auntie Prim _makes_ me naughty.\"  \"Mary, Mary, you must not talk so about that good woman!\"  \"Oh, I know she's good, mamma. Why, she is the best woman in this town; she's the best woman in the world! And she _knows_ she's good, and it makes her just as proud!\"  Now Mrs. Prim really was a person who _seemed_ to be proud of her goodness, and Flaxie had described her very well; but Mrs. Gray said again:  \"Mary, we are talking of you now, not of Auntie Prim.\"  \"Oh dear, I don't like to! I s'pect you think I don't try to be good; but, mamma, I do! I try real hard. But,\" said the little girl, patting her chest and her side, \"there's something in me that's naughty clear through.\"  The tears had come now and were dropping over the little fat hands, for in spite of her queer way of talking, Flaxie felt really unhappy about her bad conduct; though perhaps nobody but her mother would have believed it.  These two good friends had a long talk,--the kind mamma and her little daughter who meant to do better,--and when Ninny came to call them to dinner, Flaxie said, joyfully,  \"O Ninny, I'm going to begin new, and you mustn't 'member I ever was naughty.\"  That was the way Mrs. Gray forgave her children; she put their naughtiness far off and never talked of it any more. Is that the way God forgives _his_ children?  After this, Flaxie was one of the most charming little girls you ever saw for two whole months. She said it was because Mrs. Prim was gone; but of course it was simply because she tried harder to be good; that was all. Toward the last of the winter, Uncle Ben Allen, Milly's father, passed through Laurel Grove on business, and spent the night at Dr. Gray's.  \"When I go home to-morrow,\" said he, \"I'd like to take one of these little girls. Have you one to spare?\"  Now he knew very well which he wanted, but it wouldn't have been polite to say so; he wanted Julia.

I looked out of window in the white moonlight,     The trees were like snow in the wood--           'Come away           Child and play,           Light wi' the gnomies;           In a mound,           Green and round,           That's where their home is!           'Honey sweet,           Curds to eat,           Cream and frumènty,           Shells and beads,           Poppy seeds,           You shall have plenty.'      But soon as I stooped in the dim moonlight     To put on my stocking and my shoe,     The sweet, sweet singing died sadly away,     And the light of the morning peep'd through:     Then instead of the gnomies there came a red robin     To sing of the buttercups and dew.         BLUEBELLS       Where the bluebells and the wind are,     Fairies in a ring I spied,     And I heard a little linnet     Singing near beside.      Where the primrose and the dew are,     Soon were sped the fairies all:     Only now the green turf freshens,     And the linnets call.         LOVELOCKS       I watched the Lady Caroline     Bind up her dark and beauteous hair;     Her face was rosy in the glass,     And 'twixt the coils her hands would pass,         White in the candleshine.      Her bottles on the table lay,     Stoppered yet sweet of violet;     Her image in the mirror stooped     To view those locks as lightly looped         As cherry-boughs in May.      The snowy night lay dim without,     I heard the Waits their sweet song sing;     The window smouldered keen with frost;     Yet still she twisted, sleeked and tossed         Her beauteous hair about.         O DEAR ME!       Here are crocuses, white, gold, grey!       'O dear me!' says Marjorie May;     Flat as a platter the blackberry blows:       'O dear me!' says Madeleine Rose;     The leaves are fallen, the swallows flown:       'O dear me!' says Humphrey John;     Snow lies thick where all night it fell:       'O dear me!' says Emmanuel.         TARTARY       If I were Lord of Tartary,       Myself and me alone,     My bed should be of ivory,       Of beaten gold my throne;     And in my court should peacocks flaunt,     And in my forests tigers haunt,     And in my pools great fishes slant       Their fins athwart the sun.      If I were Lord of Tartary,       Trumpeters every day     To all my meals should summon me,       And in my courtyards bray;     And in the evenings lamps should shine,     Yellow as honey, red as wine,     While harp, and flute, and mandoline,       Made music sweet and gay.      If I were Lord of Tartary,       I'd wear a robe of beads,     White, and gold, and green they'd be--       And small, and thick as seeds;     And ere should wane the morning-star,     I'd don my robe and scimitar,     And zebras seven should draw my car       Through Tartary's dark glades.      Lord of the fruits of Tartary,       Her rivers silver-pale!     Lord of the hills of Tartary,       Glen, thicket, wood, and dale!     Her flashing stars, her scented breeze,     Her trembling lakes, like foamless seas,     Her bird-delighting citron-trees       In every purple vale!         THE BUCKLE       I had a silver buckle,     I sewed it on my shoe,     And 'neath a sprig of mistletoe     I danced the evening through!      I had a bunch of cowslips,     I hid 'em in a grot,     In case the elves should come by night     And me remember not.      I had a yellow riband,     I tied it in my hair,     That, walking in the garden,     The birds might see it there.      I had a secret laughter,     I laughed it near the wall:     Only the ivy and the wind     May tell of it at all.         THE HARE       In the black furrow of a field     I saw an old witch-hare this night;     And she cocked her lissome ear,     And she eyed the moon so bright,     And she nibbled o' the green;     And I whispered 'Whsst! witch-hare,'     Away like a ghostie o'er the field     She fled, and left the moonlight there.         BUNCHES OF GRAPES       'Bunches of grapes,' says Timothy;     'Pomegranates pink,' says Elaine;     'A junket of cream and a cranberry tart       For me,' says Jane.      'Love-in-a-mist,' says Timothy;     'Primroses pale,' says Elaine;     'A nosegay of pinks and mignonette       For me,' says Jane.      'Chariots of gold,' says Timothy;     'Silvery wings,' says Elaine;     'A bumpity ride in a wagon of hay       For me,' says Jane.         JOHN MOULDY       I spied John Mouldy in his cellar,     Deep down twenty steps of stone;     In the dusk he sat a-smiling,       Smiling there alone.      He read no book, he snuffed no candle;     The rats ran in, the rats ran out;     And far and near, the drip of water       Went whisp'ring about.      The dusk was still, with dew a-falling,     I saw the Dog-star bleak and grim,     I saw a slim brown rat of Norway       Creep over him.      I spied John Mouldy in his cellar,     Deep down twenty steps of stone;     In the dusk he sat a-smiling,       Smiling there alone.         THE FLY       How large unto the tiny fly       Must little things appear!--     A rosebud like a feather bed,       Its prickle like a spear;      A dewdrop like a looking-glass,       A hair like golden wire;     The smallest grain of mustard-seed       As fierce as coals of fire;      A loaf of bread, a lofty hill;       A wasp, a cruel leopard;     And specks of salt as bright to see       As lambkins to a shepherd.         SONG       O for a moon to light me home!       O for a lanthorn green!     For those sweet stars the Pleiades,     That glitter in the twilight trees;       O for a lovelorn taper! O       For a lanthorn green!      O for a frock of tartan!       O for clear, wild, grey eyes!     For fingers light as violets,     'Neath branches that the blackbird frets;       O for a thistly meadow! O       For clear, wild grey eyes!      O for a heart like almond boughs!       O for sweet thoughts like rain!     O for first-love like fields of grey,     Shut April-buds at break of day!       O for a sleep like music!       For still dreams like rain!         I SAW THREE WITCHES       I saw three witches     That bowed down like barley,     And took to their brooms 'neath a louring sky,     And, mounting a storm-cloud,     Aloft on its margin,     Stood black in the silver as up they did fly.      I saw three witches     That mocked the poor sparrows     They carried in cages of wicker along,     Till a hawk from his eyrie     Swooped down like an arrow,     And smote on the cages, and ended their song.      I saw three witches     That sailed in a shallop,     All turning their heads with a truculent smile,     Till a bank of green osiers     Concealed their grim faces,     Though I heard them lamenting for many a mile.      I saw three witches     Asleep in a valley,     Their heads in a row, like stones in a flood,     Till the moon, creeping upward,     Looked white through the valley,     And turned them to bushes in bright scarlet bud.         THE SILVER PENNY       'Sailorman, I'll give to you       My bright silver penny,     If out to sea you'll sail me       And my dear sister Jenny.'      'Get in, young sir, I'll sail ye       And your dear sister Jenny,     But pay she shall her golden locks       Instead of your penny.'      They sail away, they sail away,       O fierce the winds blew!     The foam flew in clouds,       And dark the night grew!      And all the wild sea-water       Climbed steep into the boat;     Back to the shore again       Sail they will not.      Drowned is the sailorman,       Drowned is sweet Jenny,     And drowned in the deep sea       A bright silver penny.         THE NIGHT-SWANS       'Tis silence on the enchanted lake,     And silence in the air serene,     Save for the beating of her heart,     The lovely-eyed Evangeline.      She sings across the waters clear     And dark with trees and stars between,     The notes her fairy godmother     Taught her, the child Evangeline.      As might the unrippled pool reply,     Faltering an answer far and sweet,     Three swans as white as mountain snow     Swim mantling to her feet.      And still upon the lake they stay,     Their eyes black stars in all their snow,     And softly, in the glassy pool,     Their feet beat darkly to and fro.      She rides upon her little boat,     Her swans swim through the starry sheen,     Rowing her into Fairyland--     The lovely-eyed Evangeline.      'Tis silence on the enchanted lake,     And silence in the air serene;     Voices shall call in vain again     On earth the child Evangeline.      'Evangeline! Evangeline!'     Upstairs, downstairs, all in vain.     Her room is dim; her flowers faded;     She answers not again.         THE FAIRIES DANCING       I heard along the early hills,     Ere yet the lark was risen up,     Ere yet the dawn with firelight fills     The night-dew of the bramble-cup,--     I heard the fairies in a ring     Sing as they tripped a lilting round     Soft as the moon on wavering wing.     The starlight shook as if with sound,     As if with echoing, and the stars     Prankt their bright eyes with trembling gleams;     While red with war the gusty Mars     Rained upon earth his ruddy beams.     He shone alone, adown the West,     While I, behind a hawthorn-bush,     Watched on the fairies flaxen-tressed     The fires of the"]]]
