Literature has no honours which need have been beyond the grasp of a girl who at the age of twenty-one, and in languages separated from her own by so deep a chasm, had produced so much of lasting worth. And her courage and fortitude were worthy of her intelligence. Among \"last words\" of celebrated people, that which her father has recorded, \"It is only the physical pain that makes me cry,\" is not the least remarkable, or the least significant of strong character. It was to a native of our island, and to one ten years senior to Toru, to whom it was said, in words more appropriate, surely, to her than to Oldham,      Thy generous fruits, though gathered ere their prime,     Still showed a quickness, and maturing time     But mellows what we write to the dull sweets of Rime.  That mellow sweetness was all that Toru lacked to perfect her as an English poet, and of no other Oriental who has ever lived can the same be said. When the history of the literature of our country comes to be written, there is sure to be a page in it dedicated to this fragile exotic blossom of song.                                                        EDMUND W. GOSSE.  1881.     ANCIENT BALLADS OF HINDUSTAN.     I.  SAVITRI.   PART I.      Savitri was the only child       Of Madra's wise and mighty king;     Stern warriors, when they saw her, smiled,       As mountains smile to see the spring.     Fair as a lotus when the moon       Kisses its opening petals red,     After sweet showers in sultry June!       With happier heart, and lighter tread,     Chance strangers, having met her, past,       And often would they turn the head     A lingering second look to cast,       And bless the vision ere it fled.      What was her own peculiar charm?       The soft black eyes, the raven hair,     The curving neck, the rounded arm,       All these are common everywhere.     Her charm was this--upon her face       Childlike and innocent and fair,     No man with thought impure or base       Could ever look;--the glory there,     The sweet simplicity and grace,       Abashed the boldest; but the good     God's purity there loved to trace,       Mirrored in dawning womanhood.      In those far-off primeval days       Fair India's daughters were not pent     In closed zenanas. On her ways       Savitri at her pleasure went     Whither she chose,--and hour by hour       With young companions of her age,     She roamed the woods for fruit or flower,       Or loitered in some hermitage,     For to the Munis gray and old       Her presence was as sunshine glad,     They taught her wonders manifold       And gave her of the best they had.      Her father let her have her way       In all things, whether high or low;     He feared no harm; he knew no ill       Could touch a nature pure as snow.     Long childless, as a priceless boon       He had obtained this child at last     By prayers, made morning, night, and noon       With many a vigil, many a fast;     Would Shiva his own gift recall,       Or mar its perfect beauty ever?--     No, he had faith,--he gave her all       She wished, and feared and doubted never.      And so she wandered where she pleased       In boyish freedom. Happy time!     No small vexations ever teased,       Nor crushing sorrows dimmed her prime.     One care alone, her father felt--       Where should he find a fitting mate     For one so pure?--His thoughts long dwelt       On this as with his queen he sate.     \"Ah, whom, dear wife, should we select?\"       \"Leave it to God,\" she answering cried,     \"Savitri, may herself elect       Some day, her future lord and guide.\"      Months passed, and lo, one summer morn       As to the hermitage she went     Through smiling fields of waving corn,       She saw some youths on sport intent,     Sons of the hermits, and their peers,       And one among them tall and lithe     Royal in port,--on whom the years       Consenting, shed a grace so blithe,     So frank and noble, that the eye       Was loth to quit that sun-browned face;     She looked and looked,--then gave a sigh,       And slackened suddenly her pace.      What was the meaning--was it love?       Love at first sight, as poets sing,     Is then no fiction? Heaven above       Is witness, that the heart its king     Finds often like a lightning flash;       We play,--we jest,--we have no care,--     When hark a step,--there comes no crash,--       But life, or silent slow despair.     Their eyes just met,--Savitri past       Into the friendly Muni's hut,     Her heart-rose opened had at last--       Opened no flower can ever shut.      In converse with the gray-haired sage       She learnt the story of the youth,     His name and place and parentage--       Of royal race he was in truth.     Satyavan was he hight,--his sire       Dyoumatsen had been Salva's king,     But old and blind, opponents dire       Had gathered round him in a ring     And snatched the sceptre from his hand;       Now,--with his queen and only son     He lived a hermit in the land,       And gentler hermit was there none.      With many tears was said and heard       The story,--and with praise sincere     Of Prince Satyavan; every word       Sent up a flush on cheek and ear,     Unnoticed. Hark! The bells remind       'Tis time to go,--she went away,     Leaving her virgin heart behind,       And richer for the loss. A ray,     Shot down from heaven, appeared to tinge       All objects with supernal light,     The thatches had a rainbow fringe,       The cornfields looked more green and bright.      Savitri's first care was to tell       Her mother all her feelings new;     The queen her own fears to dispel       To the king's private chamber flew.     \"Now what is it, my gentle queen,       That makes thee hurry in this wise?\"     She told him, smiles and tears between,       All she had heard; the king with sighs     Sadly replied:--\"I fear me much!       Whence is his race and what his creed?     Not knowing aught, can we in such       A matter delicate, proceed?\"      As if the king's doubts to allay,       Came Narad Muni to the place     A few days after. Old and gray,       All loved to see the gossip's face,     Great Brahma's son,--adored of men,       Long absent, doubly welcome he     Unto the monarch, hoping then       By his assistance, clear to see.     No god in heaven, nor king on earth,       But Narad knew his history,--     The sun's, the moon's, the planets' birth       Was not to him a mystery.      \"Now welcome, welcome, dear old friend,       All hail, and welcome once again!\"     The greeting had not reached its end,       When glided like a music-strain     Savitri's presence through the room.--       \"And who is this bright creature, say,     Whose radiance lights the chamber's gloom--       Is she an Apsara or fay?\"     \"No son thy servant hath, alas!       This is my one,--my only child;\"--     \"And married?\"--\"No.\"--\"The seasons pass,       Make haste, O king,\"--he said, and smiled.      \"That is the very theme, O sage,       In which thy wisdom ripe I need;     Seen hath she at the hermitage       A youth to whom in very deed     Her heart inclines.\"--\"And who is he?\"       \"My daughter, tell his name and race,     Speak as to men who best love thee.\"       She turned to them her modest face,     And answered quietly and clear.--       \"Ah, no! ah, no!--It cannot be--     Choose out another husband, dear,\"--       The Muni cried,--\"or woe is me!\"      \"And why should I? When I have given       My heart away, though but in thought,     Can I take back? Forbid it, Heaven!       It were a deadly sin, I wot.     And why should I? I know no crime       In him or his.\"--\"Believe me, child,     My reasons shall be clear in time,       I speak not like a madman wild;     Trust me in this.\"--\"I cannot break       A plighted faith,--I cannot bear     A wounded conscience.\"--\"Oh, forsake       This fancy, hence may spring despair.\"--      \"It may not be.\"--The father heard       By turns the speakers, and in doubt     Thus interposed a gentle word,--       \"Friend should to friend his mind speak out,     Is he not worthy? tell us.\"--\"Nay,       All worthiness is in Satyavan,     And no one can my praise gainsay:       Of solar race--more god than man!     Great Soorasen, his ancestor,       And Dyoumatsen his father blind     Are known to fame: I can aver       No kings have been so good and kind.\"      \"Then where, O Muni, is the bar?       If wealth be gone, and kingdom lost,     His merit still remains a star,       Nor melts his lineage like the frost.     For riches, worldly power, or rank       I care not,--I would have my son     Pure, wise, and brave,--the Fates I thank       I see no hindrance, no, not one.\"     \"Since thou insistest, King, to hear       The fatal truth,--I tell you,--I,     Upon this day as rounds the year       The young Prince Satyavan shall die.\"      This was enough. The monarch knew       The future was no sealèd book     To Brahma's son. A clammy dew       Spread on his brow,--he gently took     Savitri's palm in his, and said:       \"No child can give away her hand,     A pledge is nought unsanctionèd;       And here, if right I understand,     There was no pledge at all,--a thought,       A shadow,--barely crossed the mind--     Unblamed, it may be clean forgot,       Before the gods it cannot bind.      \"And think upon the dreadful curse       Of widowhood; the vigils, fasts,     And penances; no life is worse       Than hopeless life,--the while it lasts.     Day follows day in one long round,       Monotonous and blank and drear;     Less painful were it to be bound       On some bleak rock, for aye to hear--     Without one chance of getting free--       The ocean's melancholy voice!     Mine be the sin,--if sin there be,       But thou must make a different choice.\"      In the meek grace of virginhood       Unblanched her cheek, undimmed her eye,  "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23259"],["title","Home Taxidermy for Pleasure and Profit (#1)"],["body","           204 Skulls--Wolf, Lynx, Otter, Mink                                    207 Flying Duck                                                        212 Timber Wolf Rug, Full Head                                         213 Deer Head Hall Rack                                                214 Foot Muff Trimmed                                                  218 Monkey Card Receiver                                               219 Squirrels--Grey, Red, Flying, Ground                               222 Water Fowl Head                                                    226 Three Piece Mould of Head                                          229 Making Mould for Half Head                                         231 Deer Foot Ink Well and Pen Rack                                    233 Mountain Lion or Puma Hide                                         234 Spring Lamb?

In the study and practice of taxidermy for several years I have failed to find any work written primarily for these every day nature lovers, though they probably handle a greater number of interesting specimens of animal life than all other classes of people.  In view of this fact the following directions and suggestions for preserving various animal forms as objects of use and ornament have been prepared. As a treatise for the scientist or museum preparator it is not intended, there are many books on the art expressly for them, but we hope it may fill a place of its own, acting as a not too dry and technical introduction to the art preservative for those who find life all too short for the many things which are to be done.  Thoroughness, patience, and some love for nature, are qualities highly desirable in this art. Work prepared by one possessing these qualities need not be ashamed and practice will bring skill and perfection of technic.  As a handicraft in which the workman has not been displaced or made secondary by a machine taxidermy is noticeable also, and for many reasons is worthy of its corner in the home work-shop.  In this work also the ladies can take a very effective hand, and numbers have done so; for there is no doubt that a woman's taste and lightness of touch enables her in some branches of taxidermy to far exceed the average man. Especially in the manipulation of frail skins and delicate feathers, in bird taxidermy, is this so.  I have endeavored to give preference to short cuts and time-saving methods where possible in the following matter, and especially hints on saving interesting and valuable specimens temporarily until sufficient leisure is had to do justice to their further preservation. In this connection I have given prominence to the liquid preservative for entire specimens and the methods for preserving skins of birds and animals in a damp and relaxed state ready for mounting at the operator's pleasure.  I would urge the beginner especially, to mount all his specimens as far as possible. Dry scientific skins have their value, perhaps, to the museum or closet naturalist whose chief delight is in multiplying species, but a well mounted skin is a pleasure to all who may see it. Making it a rule to utilize thus all specimens which come to hand would also deter much thoughtless killing in the ranks of the country's already depleted wild life.  Make this a rule and you will avoid friction and show yourself truly a conservationist with the best. In a number of states there are legal restrictions in the way of a license tax imposed on the professional taxidermist. Detailed information of these are found in Game, Fur and Fish Laws of the various states and Canadian provinces. Fur and game animals and birds killed legally during open season may be preserved by the taker for private possession without hindrance anywhere, I think. More explicit details may be had on application to your state fish and game commissioner or warden.  [Signature: Albert B. Farnham.]     Home Taxidermy for Pleasure and Profit  CHAPTER I.  HISTORY.   It is very evident that this art--Taxidermy, preservation or care of skins--had its origin far back before the dawn of written history. There existed then as now the desire to preserve the trophy of the hunter's prowess and skill and the unusual in natural objects.  As far back as five centuries B. C. in the record of the African explorations of Hanno the Carthaginian, an account is given of the discovery of what was evidently the gorilla and the subsequent preservation of their skins, which were, on the return of the voyagers, hung in the temple of Astarte, where they remained until the taking of Carthage in the year 146 B. C.  This, of course, was not the art as we know it now, but shows the beginnings of what might be called the museum idea. The art of embalming as practiced by the ancient Egyptians was, however, effective, not for the purpose of having the specimens look natural, or for exhibition, but to satisfy the superstition of the times, and though a preservative art, hardly to be classed with taxidermy.  In the tombs of that period are found besides the mummies of human beings, countless others of dogs, cats, monkeys, birds, sheep and oxen. There have been a number of efforts made to substitute some form of embalming for present day taxidermy but without much success, for though the body of the specimen may be preserved from decay without removing it from the skin, the subsequent shrinkage and distortion spoil any effect which may have been achieved.  [Illustration: AN EARLY DAY SPECIMEN.]  The first attempt at stuffing and mounting birds was said to have been made in Amsterdam in the beginning of the 16th century. The oldest museum specimen in existence, as far as I know, is a rhinoceros in the Royal Museum of Vertebrates in Florence, Italy, said to have been originally mounted in the 16th century.  Probably on account of the necessary knowledge of preservative chemicals, the art seems to have been in the hands of chemists and astrologers, chiefly, during the middle ages, and stuffed animals such as bats, crocodiles, frogs, snakes, lizards, owls, etc., figure in literary descriptions of their abodes. Then as now also, the dining halls of the nobles and wealthy were decorated with heads and horns procured in the hunt.  The first publications on the art seem to have been made in France, in which country and Germany, many still used methods and formulas originated. Though the first volume of instruction in taxidermy was published in the United States as late as 1865, it has been left for the study and ingenuity of American taxidermists to accomplish what is probably work of as high a standard as any in the world.  The Ward establishment at Rochester has turned out many well trained taxidermists, the large museums of the United States are filled with some of the best work of the kind in existence, besides many persons who have engaged in it for commercial purposes or to gratify private tastes. Many of these have made public their methods and modes in various publications. Among these are the works of Batty, Hornaday, Shofeldt, Davie, Rowley, Maynard, Reed and others, all of which are invaluable books of reference for the home taxidermist.  It is to be regretted that the once flourishing Society of American Taxidermists has not been perpetuated, numbering, as it did, among its membership the best artists in their line in this country.  There is no royal road to success in this, more than any other of the arts and sciences, though I believe the ambitious beginner will find the way smoother; better materials are to be had, more helpful publications to be consulted and the lessening supply of wild life tends to make a more appreciative public than ever before.     CHAPTER II.  OUTFIT--TOOLS AND MATERIALS.   The extent and variety of work undertaken will determine the necessary working space and the assortment of tools needful. Other things being equal, the most complete assortment of tools and supplies makes possible the production of the best work in the minimum time. The equipment of the beginner need be but small and inexpensive, however, increasing the same as he discovers what is most necessary and desirable, in an increasing field of work. Wonderful pieces of taxidermy have been done with a pocket knife, pliers, needle and thread, some wire, tow and arsenic.  If no other room offers, much may be achieved (with the permission of the lady of the house) in a corner of a dining room or kitchen. A room or part of one well lighted, by north window or sky-light preferably, makes the best location for the work table. This table may be of the common unpainted kitchen variety for all small work. It is well to make the top double by hinging on two leaves, which when extended will make it twice its usual width. When so extended and supported by swinging brackets it is specially adapted to sewing on rugs and robes. Such tables usually have one or two shallow drawers which are most useful to hold small tools. A shelf should be fitted between the legs, six or eight inches from the floor, forming a handy place for boxes of materials, books, etc.  [Illustration: WORK TABLE-SUPPLIES ON LOWER SHELF, TOOLS, ETC. ON WALL.]  If large work is in prospect a table should be built of the usual heighth, two or three feet wide, and six long. The legs of stout scantlings should be fitted with casters, making it easy to remove it to the center of the room where it can be approached on all sides, as will often be necessary. The double top, drawers, and shelf should be a part of the larger table also. Usually the table is kept in front of the window with tool racks and shelves for small articles each side of the same where they can easily be"]]]
