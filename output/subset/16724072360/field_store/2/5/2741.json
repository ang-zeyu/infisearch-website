Their chief object, however, was to put as much space as possible between themselves and their late pursuers, and to this end they pushed forward at their best speed, until they reached a small river which appeared to be a tributary to, or a branch of, that which they had seen from the heights earlier in the day.    \"`Come to a ribber--couldn't git across,   Gib a couple o' dollars for an' old blind hoss,'\"  murmured Ebony, quoting an ancient ditty.  \"We shall have to swim it, I fear,\" remarked Breezy, \"for there is no horse here, blind or otherwise.  Perhaps that fallen tree may prove strong enough to serve as a bridge.\"  He pointed to a slender tree which had evidently been placed there, with several others, for the purpose of forming a rough and ready bridge; but its companions had been removed by floods, for they lay tossed on the bank further down among other wreckage.  \"It'll be somethin' like tight-rope dancin',\" said the sailor.  \"We'll have to repair the bridge.\"  \"Nuffin' ob de sort!  Look here.\"  Ebony ran to the tree referred to, and skipped over with admirable agility, though it bent under him not unlike a tight-rope.  \"But _I_ can't do that,\" said Hockins, \"not bein' a black monkey, d'ee see?\"  With a sudden expression of intense pity the negro exclaimed--  \"Oh!  I beg pardin'.  Didn't I forgot; you's on'y a white man.  But stop; I come ober agin an' took you on my back.\"  He pretended to be on the point of recrossing, but the sailor had already got upon the bridge, and, with much balancing and waving of his long arms, passed over in safety.  Mark was about to follow, when Hockins called out, \"Better pitch over the powder-flask in case you fall in.\"  \"That's true, for I mayn't be as good as you or Ebony on the tight-rope. Look out!\"  He pulled the powder-flask out of his pocket and threw it towards his comrades.  Unfortunately the branch of an overhanging bush had touched his hand.  The touch was slight, but it sufficed to divert the flask from its proper course, and sent it into the middle of the stream.  Ebony followed it head first like an otter, but soon reappeared, gasping and unsuccessful.  Again and again he dived, but failed to find the flask, without which, of course, their gun was useless, and at last they were obliged to continue their flight without it.  This was a very serious loss, for they had not an ounce of provisions with them, and were in a land the character and resources of which were utterly unknown at least to two of them, while the youth who had become their leader knew very little more than the fact that it was the island of Madagascar, that it lay about 300 miles off the eastern shores of Africa, and that the tribes by whom they were surrounded were little if at all better than savages.  That day they wandered far into the depths of a dark and tangled forest, intentionally seeking its gloomiest recesses in order to avoid the natives, and at night went supperless to rest among the branches of an umbrageous tree, not knowing what danger from man or beast might assail them if they should venture to sleep on the ground.  Although possessed of flint and steel, as well as tinder, they did not use them for fear of attracting attention.  As they had nothing to cook, the deprivation was not great.  Fortunately the weather at the time was pleasantly warm, so that beyond the discomfort of not being able to stretch out at full length, the occasional poking of awkward knots and branches into their ribs, and the constant necessity of holding on lest they should fall off, their circumstances were not insufferable, and might have been worse.  While they are enjoying their repose, we will tell in a few sentences who they were and how they got there.  When Mark Breezy, in the closing years of his medical-student career, got leave to go on a voyage to China in one of his father's ships, the _Eastern Star_, for the benefit of his health and the enlargement of his understanding, he had no more idea that that voyage would culminate in a bed up a tree in the forests of Madagascar than you, reader, have that you will ultimately become an inhabitant of the moon!  The same remark may with equal truth be made of John Hockins when he joined the _Eastern Star_ as an able seaman, and of James Ginger--alias Ebony--when he shipped as cook.  If the captain of the _Eastern Star_ had introduced those three,--who had never seen each other before--and told them that they would spend many months together among savages in the midst of terrestrial beauty, surrounded by mingled human depravity and goodness, self-denial and cruelty, fun and tragedy such as few men are fated to experience, they would have smiled at each other with good-natured scepticism and regarded their captain as a facetious lunatic.  Yet so it turned out, though the captain prophesied it not--and this was the way of it.  Becalmed off the coast of Madagascar, and having, through leakage in one of the tanks, run short of water, the captain ordered a boat with casks to be got ready to go ashore for water.  The young doctor got leave to land and take his gun for the purpose of procuring specimens--for he was something of a naturalist--and having a ramble.  \"Don't get out of hail, Doctor,\" said the captain, as the boat shoved off.  \"All right, sir, I won't.\"  \"An' take a couple o' the men into the bush with you in case of accidents.\"  \"Ay ay, sir,\" responded Mark, waving his hand in acknowledgment.  And that was the last that Mark Breezy and the captain of the _Eastern Star_ saw of each other for many a day.  \"Who will go with me?\" asked Mark, when the boat touched the shore.  \"Me, massa,\" eagerly answered the negro cook, who had gone ashore in the hope of being able to get some fresh vegetables from the natives if any were to be found living there.  \"Seems to me dere's no black mans here, so may's well try de woods for wild wegibles.\"  \"No no, Ebony,\" said the first mate, who had charge of the boat, \"you'll be sure to desert if we let you go--unless we send Hockins to look after you.  He's the only man that can keep you in order.\"  \"Well, I'll take Hockins also,\" said Mark, \"you heard the captain say I was to have two men.  Will you go, Hockins?\"  \"Ay, ay, sir,\" answered the seaman, sedately, but with a wrinkle or two on his visage which proved that the proposal was quite to his taste.  All the men of the boat's crew were armed either with cutlass or carbine--in some cases with both; for although the natives were understood to be friendly at that part of the coast it was deemed prudent to be prepared for the reverse.  Thus John Hockins carried a cutlass in his belt, but no fire-arm, and the young doctor had his double-barrelled gun, with powder-flask and shot-belt, but Ebony--being a free-and-easy, jovial sort of nigger--went unarmed, saying he \"didn't want to carry no harms, seein' he would need all harms he had to carry back de fresh wegibles wid.\"  Thus those three went into the bush, promising to keep well within ear-shot, and to return instantly at the first summons.  That summons came--not as a shout, as had been expected, but as a shot-- about an hour after the landing.  Our explorers ran to the top of a neighbouring mound in some surprise, not unmixed with anxiety.  Before they reached the summit a volley from the direction of the sea, followed by fierce yells, told that some sort of evil was going on.  Another moment, and they reached the eminence just in time to behold their boat's crew pulling off shore while a band of at least a hundred savages attacked them--some rushing into the water chest-deep in order to seize the boat.  Cutlass and carbine, however, proved more than a match for stone and spear.  The fight had scarce lasted a minute, and our trio were on the point of rushing down to the rescue, when a white cloud burst from the side of the _Eastern Star_, the woods and cliffs echoed with the roar of a big gun, and a shot, plunging into the crowd of natives, cut down many of them and went crashing into the bushes.  It was enough.  The natives turned and fled while the boat pulled to the ship.  Uncertainty as to what should be done kept Mark Breezy and his companions rooted for a few seconds to the spot.  Indecision was banished, however, when they suddenly perceived a band of thirty or forty natives moving stealthily towards them by a circuitous route, evidently with the intention of taking them in rear and preventing them from finding shelter in the woods.  It was the first time that the young student's manhood had been put severely to the test.  There was a rush of hot blood to his forehead, and his heart beat powerfully as he saw and realised the hopelessness of their case with such tremendous odds against them.  \"We can die but once,\" he said with forced calmness, as he cocked his gun and prepared to defend himself.  \"I's not a-goin' to die at all,\" said the negro, hastily tightening his belt, \"I's a-goin' to squatilate.\"  \"And you?\" said Mark, turning to the seaman.  \"Run, says I, of coorse,\" replied Hockins, with something between a grin and a scowl; \"ye know the old song--him wot fights an' runs away, may live to fight another day!\"  \"Come along, then!\" cried Mark, who felt that whether they fought or ran he was bound to retain the leadership of his little party.  As we have seen, they ran to some purpose.  No doubt if they had started on equal terms, the lithe, hardy, and almost naked savages would have soon overtaken them, but fortunately a deep gully lay between them and the party of natives who had first observed them.  Before this was crossed the fugitives were over the second ridge of rolling land that lay between the thick woods and the sea, and when the savages at"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23267"],["title","The Cannibal Islands: Captain Cook's Adventure in the South Seas (#1)"],["body","rines, and nine servants--these, with the officers and the scientific men of the expedition, made up a body of eighty-five persons.  The scientific men above mentioned were, Mr Green, an astronomer; Mr Banks, a naturalist, who afterwards became Sir Joseph Banks and a celebrated man; Doctor Solander, who was also a naturalist; and two draughtsmen, one of whom was skilled in drawing objects of natural history, the other in taking views of scenery.  The _Endeavour_ was victualled for a cruise of eighteen months.  She was a three-masted vessel of the barque rig, and carried twenty-two large guns, besides a store of small arms,--for the region of the world to which they were bound was inhabited by savages, against whom they might find it necessary to defend themselves.  When all was ready, Captain Cook hoisted his flag, and spread his sails, and, on the 26th of August 1768, the voyage began--England soon dropped out of sight astern, and ere long the blue sky above and the blue sea below were all that remained for the eyes of the navigators to rest upon.  It is a wonderful thought, when we come to consider it, the idea of _going to sea_!  To sailors who are used to it, the thought, indeed, may be very commonplace, and to lazy minds that are not much given to think deeply upon any subject, the thought may not appear very wonderful; but it is so, nevertheless, to us, men of the land, when we calmly sit down and ponder the idea of making to ourselves a house of planks and beams of wood, launching it upon the sea, loading it with food and merchandise, setting up tall poles above its roof, spreading great sheets thereon, and then rushing out upon the troubled waters of the great deep, there, for days and nights, for weeks and months, and even years, to brave the fury of the winds and waves, with nothing between us and death except a wooden plank, some two or three inches thick!  It seems a bold thing for man to act in this fashion, even when he is accustomed to it, and when he knows all about the sea which he sails over; but when, like Cook, he knows very little about the far-off ocean to which he is bound, his boldness seems and really is, much greater. It is this very uncertainty, however, that charms the minds of enterprising men, and gives interest to such voyages.  The Bible says, \"They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters; these see the works of the Lord, and His wonders in the deep.\"  Navigators in all ages have borne testimony to the truth of this.  The very first pages in Cook's journal mention some of these wonders.  He says that, while they were off the coast of Spain, Mr Banks and Dr Solander, the naturalists, had an opportunity of observing some very curious marine animals, some of which were like jelly, and so colourless that it was difficult to see them in the water except at night, when they became luminous, and glowed like pale liquid fire. One, that was carefully examined, was about three inches long, and an inch thick, with a hollow passing quite through it, and a brown spot at one end, which was supposed to be its stomach.  Four of these, when first taken up out of the sea in a bucket, were found to be adhering together, and were supposed to be one animal; but on being put into a glass of water they separated and swam briskly about.  Many of them resembled precious stones, and shone in the water with bright and beautiful colours.  One little animal of this kind lived several hours in a glass of salt water, swimming about with great agility, and at every motion displaying a change of colours.  These _Medusae_, as they are called, have been spoken of by many travellers, who tell us that in some parts of the sea they are so numerous that the whole ocean is covered with them, and seems to be composed of liquid fire, usually of a pale blue or green colour.  The appearance is described as being of great splendour.  Even in the seas on our own coasts this beautiful light is often seen.  It is called phosphoric light.  Something of the same kind may be seen in the carcass of a decaying fish if taken into a dark room.  Not long after this, they saw flying-fish.  Cook says that when seen from the cabin windows they were beautiful beyond imagination, their sides having the colour and brightness of burnished silver.  When seen from the deck they did not look so beautiful, because their backs were of a dark colour.  It must not be supposed that these fish could fly about in the air like birds.  They can only fly a few yards at a time. They usually rise suddenly from the waves, fly as if in a great hurry, not more than a yard or two above the surface, and then drop as suddenly back into the sea as they rose out of it.  The two fins near the shoulders of the fish are very long, so that they can be used as wings for these short flights.  When chased by their enemy, the dolphin, flying-fish usually take a flight in order to escape.  They do not, however, appear to be able to use their eyes when out of the water, for they have been seen to fly against ships at sea, get entangled in the rigging, and fall helpless on the deck.  They are not quite so large as a herring, and are considered very good eating.  On drawing near to Cape Horn, on the extreme south of South America, the voyagers began to prepare for bad weather, for this Cape is notorious for its storms.  Few mariners approach the Horn without some preparation, for many a good ship has gone to the bottom in the gales that blow there.  It was here that they first fell in with savages.  The ship having approached close to that part of the land named Tierra del Fuego, natives were observed on shore.  As Mr Banks and Dr Solander were anxious to visit them, a boat was lowered and sent ashore.  They landed near a bay in the lee of some rocks where the water was smooth.  Thirty or forty of the Indians soon made their appearance at the end of a sandy beach on the other side of the bay, but seeing that there were twelve Europeans in the boat they were afraid, and retreated.  Mr Banks and Dr Solander then advanced about one hundred yards, on which two of the Indians returned, and, having advanced some paces, sat down.  As soon as the gentlemen came up the savages rose and each threw away a small stick which he had carried in his hand.  This was intended for a sign of peace.  They then walked briskly towards their companions, who had halted about fifty yards behind them, and beckoned the gentlemen to follow, which they did.  They were received with many uncouth signs of friendship, and, in return, gave the savages some beads and ribbons, which greatly delighted them.  A feeling of good-will having been thus established, the two parties joined and tried to hold converse by means of signs.  Three of the Indians agreed to accompany them back to the ship, and when they got on board one of the wild visitors began to go through some extraordinary antics.  When he was taken to any new part of the ship, or when he was shown any new thing, he shouted with all his force for some minutes, without directing his voice either to the people of the ship or to his companions.  Some beef and bread being given to them, they ate it, but did not seem to relish it much.  Nevertheless, such of it as they did not eat they took away with them.  But they would not swallow a drop either of wine or spirits.  They put the glass to their lips, but, having tasted the liquor, they returned it with looks of disgust.  Cook says he was much surprised at the want of curiosity in these savages of the Cape, and seems to have formed a very low opinion of them.  They were conducted all over the ship, yet, although they saw a vast number of beautiful and curious things that must have been quite new to them, they did not give vent to any expression of wonder or pleasure--for the howling above spoken of did not seem to be either,-- and when they returned to land they did not seem anxious to tell what they had seen, neither did their comrades appear desirous of hearing anything about their visit to the ship.  Altogether, they seemed a much lower race of people than the inhabitants of the South-Sea Islands whom Cook afterwards visited.    CHAPTER THREE.  DESCRIBES AN ADVENTURE IN THE MOUNTAINS, AND TELLS OF TIERRA DEL FUEGO.  One of the main objects that Mr Banks and Dr Solander had in view in going with Captain Cook on this voyage was to collect specimens of plants and insects in the new countries they were about to visit.  The country near Cape Horn was at that time almost unknown: indeed, it is not much known even at the present day.  The two naturalists of the expedition were therefore anxious to land and explore the shore.  Accordingly, early one fine morning a party went ashore to ascend one of the mountains.  It consisted of Mr Banks and Dr Solander with their servants, two of whom were negroes; Mr Buchan, the draughtsman; Mr Monkhouse, the surgeon of the ship; and Mr Green, the astronomer. These set off to push as far as they could into the country, intending to return before night.  They were accompanied by two seamen, who carried their baggage.  The hills, when viewed from a distance, seemed to be partly wooded; above the wood there was a plain, and beyond that bare rocks.  Mr Banks hoped to get through the woods, and made no doubt that beyond it he would find new sorts of plants which no botanists had ever yet heard of. They entered the wood full of hope, and with much of the excitement that men cannot but feel when exploring a country that has never been trodden by the foot of a civilised man since the world began.  It took them, however, much longer to get through the pathless wood than they had expected.  It was afternoon before they reached what they had taken for a plain, but which, to their great disappointment, they found to be a swamp covered with low bushes, which were so stubborn that they could not break through them, and were therefore compelled to step over them, "]]]
