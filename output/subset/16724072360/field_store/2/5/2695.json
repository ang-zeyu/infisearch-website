I'll do a crewman's work for a crewman's wages. I thought I'd wander around a while. It ought to be interesting,\" he said.  \"On a Jek ship.\"  \"Anybody's ship. When I get to their home world, I'll probably ship out with some people from farther on. Why not? It's honest work.\"  MacReidie had no answer to that.  \"But--\" I said.  \"What?\" He looked at me as if he couldn't understand what might be bothering me, but I think perhaps he could.  \"Nothing,\" I said, and that was that, except MacReidie was always a sourer man from that time up to as long as I knew him afterwards. We took off in the morning. The stoker had already left on the Jek ship, and it turned out he'd trained an apprentice boy to take his place.         *       *       *       *       *  It was strange how things became different for us, little by little after that. It was never anything you could put your finger on, but the Jeks began taking more goods, and giving us things we needed when we told them we wanted them. After a while, _Serenus_ was going a little deeper into Jek territory, and when she wore out, the two replacements let us trade with the Lud, too. Then it was the Nosurwey, and other people beyond them, and things just got better for us, somehow.  We heard about our stoker, occasionally. He shipped with the Lud, and the Nosurwey, and some people beyond them, getting along, going to all kinds of places. Pay no attention to the precise red lines you see on the star maps; nobody knows exactly what path he wandered from people to people. Nobody could. He just kept signing on with whatever ship was going deeper into the galaxy, going farther and farther. He messed with green shipmates and blue ones. One and two and three heads, tails, six legs--after all, ships are ships and they've all got to have something to push them along. If a man knows his business, why not? A man can live on all kinds of food, if he wants to get used to it. And any nontoxic atmosphere will do, as long as there's enough oxygen in it.  I don't know what he did, to make things so much better for us. I don't know if he did anything, but stoke their ships and, I suppose, fix them when they were in trouble. I wonder if he sang dirty songs in that bad voice of his, to people who couldn't possibly understand what the songs were about. All I know is, for some reason those people slowly began treating us with respect. We changed, too, I think--I'm not the same man I was ... I think--not altogether the same; I'm a captain now, with master's papers, and you won't find me in my cabin very often ... there's a kind of joy in standing on a bridge, looking out at the stars you're moving toward. I wonder if it mightn't have kept my old captain out of that place he died in, finally, if he'd tried it.  So, I don't know. The older I get, the less I know. The thing people remember the stoker for--the thing that makes him famous, and, I think, annoys him--I'm fairly sure is only incidental to what he really did. If he did anything. If he meant to. I wish I could be sure of the exact answer he found in the bottom of that last glass at the bar before he worked his passage to Mars and the _Serenus_, and began it all.  So, I can't say what he ought to be famous for. But I suppose it's enough to know for sure that he was the first living being ever to travel all the way around the galaxy.

It is thus so easy to make canals in Holland, that the people have been making them for hundreds of years, until now almost the whole country is intersected every where with canals, as other countries are with roads. Almost all the traffic, and, until lately, almost all the travel of the country, has been upon the canals. There are private canals, too, as well as public. A farmer brings home his hay and grain from his fields by water, and when he buys a new piece of land he makes a canal to it, as a Vermont farmer would make a road to a new pasture or wood lot that he had been buying.  Rollo wished very much to see all these things--but there was one question which it puzzled him very much to decide, and that was whether he would rather go to Holland in the summer or in the winter.  \"I am not certain,\" said he to his mother one day, \"whether it would not be better for me to go in the winter.\"  \"It is very cold there in the winter,\" said his mother; \"so I am told.\"  \"That is the very thing,\" said Rollo. \"They have such excellent skating on the canals. I want to see the boats go on the canals, and I want to see the skating, and I don't know which I want to see most.\"  \"Yes,\" said his mother, \"I recollect to have often seen pictures of skating on the Dutch canals.\"  \"And I read, when I was a boy,\" continued Rollo, \"that the women skate to market in Holland.\"  Rollo here observed that his mother was endeavoring to suppress a smile. She seemed to try very hard, but she could not succeed in keeping perfectly sober.  \"What are you laughing at, mother?\" asked Rollo.  Here Mrs. Holiday could no longer restrain herself, but laughed outright.  \"Is it about the Dutch women skating to market?\" asked Rollo.  \"I think they must look quite funny, at any rate,\" said Mrs. Holiday.  What Mrs. Holiday was really laughing at was to hear Rollo talk about \"when he was a boy.\" But the fact was, that Rollo had now travelled about so much, and taken care of himself in so many exigencies, that he began to feel quite like a man. And indeed I do not think it at all surprising that he felt so.  \"Which would you do, mother,\" said Rollo, \"if you were I? Would you rather go in the summer or in the winter?\"  \"I would ask uncle George,\" said Mrs. Holiday.  So Rollo went to find his uncle George.  Rollo was at this time at Morley's Hotel, in London, and he expected to find his uncle George in what is called the coffee room. The coffee room in Morley's Hotel is a very pleasant place. It fronts on one side upon a very busy and brilliant street, and on another upon a large open square, adorned with monuments and fountains. On the side towards the square is a bay window, and near this bay window were two or three small tables, with gentlemen sitting at them, engaged in writing. There were other tables along the sides of the room and at the other windows, where gentlemen were taking breakfast. Mr. George was at one of the tables near the bay window, and was busy writing.  Rollo went to the place, and standing by Mr. George's side, he said in an under tone,--  \"Uncle George.\"  Every body speaks in an under tone in an English coffee room. They do this in order not to interrupt the conversation, or the reading, or the writing of other gentlemen that may be in the room.  \"Wait a moment,\" said Mr. George, \"till I finish this letter.\"  So Rollo turned to the bay window and looked out, in order to amuse himself with what he might observe in the street, till his uncle George should be ready to talk with him.  He saw the fountains in the square, and a great many children playing about the basins. He saw a poor boy at a crossing brushing the pavement industriously with an old broom, and then holding out his hand to the people passing by, in hopes that some of them would give him a halfpenny. He saw a policeman walking slowly up and down on the sidewalk, wearing a glazed hat, and a uniform of blue broadcloth, with his letter and number embroidered on the collar. He saw an elegant carriage drive by, with a postilion riding upon one of the horses, and two footmen in very splendid liveries behind. There was a lady in the carriage, but she appeared old, and though she was splendidly dressed, her face was very plain.  \"I wonder,\" said Rollo to himself, \"how much she would give of her riches and finery if she could be as young and as pretty as my cousin Lucy.\"  \"Now, Rollo,\" said Mr. George, interrupting Rollo's reflections, \"what is the question?\"  \"Why, I want to know,\" said Rollo, \"whether you think we had better go to Holland in the winter or in the summer.\"  \"Is it left to you to decide?\" asked Mr. George.  \"Why, no,\" said Rollo, \"not exactly. But mother asked me to consider which I thought was best, and so I want to know your opinion.\"  \"Very well,\" said Mr. George, \"go on and argue the case. After I have heard it argued I will decide.\"  Rollo then proceeded to explain to his uncle the advantages, respectively, of going in the summer and in the winter. After hearing him, Mr. George thought it would be decidedly better to go in the summer.  \"You see,\" said he, \"that the only advantage of going in the winter is to see the skating. That is very important, I know. I should like to see the Dutch women skating to market myself, very much. But then, in the winter you could see very little of the canals, and the wind mills, and all the other hydraulic operations of the country. Every thing would be frozen up solid.\"  \"Father says that he can't go now very well,\" continued Rollo, \"but that I may go with you if you would like to go.\"  Mr. George was just in the act of sealing his letter as Rollo spoke these words; but he paused in the operation, holding the stick of sealing wax in one hand and the letter in the other, as if he was reflecting on what Rollo had said.  \"If we only had some one else to go with us,\" said Mr. George.  \"Should not we two be enough?\" asked Rollo.  \"Why, you see,\" said Mr. George, \"when we get into Holland we shall not understand one word of the language.\"  \"What language do they speak?\" asked Rollo.  \"Dutch,\" said Mr. George, \"and I do not know any Dutch.\"  \"Not a word?\" asked Rollo.  \"No,\" said Mr. George, \"not a word. Ah, yes! I know one word. I know that _dampschiff_ means steamboat. _Damp_, I suppose, means steam.\"  Then Rollo laughed outright. Dampskiff, he said, was the funniest name for steamboat that he ever heard.  \"Now, when we don't know a word of the language,\" added Mr. George, \"we cannot have any communication with the people of the country, but shall be confined entirely to each other. Now, do you think that you could get along with having nobody but me to talk to you for a whole fortnight?\"  \"Yes, indeed!\" said Rollo. \"But then, uncle George,\" he continued, \"how are you going to get along at the hotels without knowing how to speak to the people at all?\"  \"By signs and gestures,\" said Mr. George, laughing. \"Could not you make a sign for something to eat?\"  \"O, yes,\" said Rollo; and he immediately began to make believe eat, moving his hands as if he had a knife and fork in them.  \"And what sign would you make for going to bed?\" asked Mr. George.  Here Rollo laid his head down to one side, and placed his hand under it, as if it were a pillow, and then shut his eyes.  \"That is the sign for going to bed,\" said Rollo. \"A deaf and dumb boy taught it to me.\"  \"I wish he had taught you some more signs,\" said Mr. George. \"Or I wish we had a deaf and dumb boy here to go with us. Deaf and dumb people can get along excellently well where they do not understand the language, because they know how to make so many signs.\"  \"O, we can make up the signs as we go along,\" said Rollo.  \"Yes,\" said Mr. George. \"I don't think that we shall have any great difficulty about that. But then it would be pleasanter to go in a little larger party. Two people are apt to get tired of each other, when there is nobody else that they can speak a single word to for a whole fortnight. I don't think that I should get tired of you. What I am afraid of is, that you would get tired of me.\"  There was a lurking smile on Mr. George's face as he said this.  \"O, uncle George!\" said Rollo, \"that is only your politeness. But then if you really think that we ought to have some more company, perhaps the Parkmans are going to Holland, and we might go with them.\"  \"I would not make a journey with the Parkmans,\" said Mr. George, \"if they would pay all my expenses, and give me five sovereigns a day.\"  \"Why, uncle George!\" exclaimed Rollo; \"I thought you liked Mr. Parkman very much.\"  \"So I do,\" said Mr. George. \"It is his wife that I would not go with.\"  \"O, uncle George!\" exclaimed Rollo again.  Rollo was very much surprised at hearing this declaration; and it was very natural that he should be surprised, for Mrs. Parkman was a young and beautiful lady, and she was very kindhearted and very amiable in her disposition. Mr. Parkman, too, was very young. He had been one of Mr. George's college classmates. He had been married only a short time before he left America, and he was now making his bridal tour.  Mr. George thought that Mrs. Parkman was very beautiful and very intelligent, but he considered her a very uncomfortable travelling companion. I think he judged her somewhat too harshly. But this was one of Mr. George's faults. He did not like the ladies very much, and the faults which he observed in them, from time to time, he was prone to condemn much too harshly.  [Illustration]     CHAPTER II.  A BAD TRAVELLING COMPANION.   The reason why Mr. George did not like his friend Mr. Parkman's young wife was not because of any want of natural attractiveness in her person, or of amiableness in her disposition,--for she was beautiful, accomplished, and kindhearted. But for all this, from a want of consideration not uncommon among young ladies who are not much experienced in the world, she was a very "]]]
