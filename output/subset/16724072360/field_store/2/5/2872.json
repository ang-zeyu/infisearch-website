He could hear it go rattling from log to log nearly to the bottom. Sweetest Susan gave a little screech. Drusilla sat bolt upright and exclaimed:--  \"You all better come en go see yo' ma. I want ter see 'er myse'f.\"  But there was nothing to be frightened at. The tiny man had brushed the dust and trash from his clothes, and then turned to the children with a good-humored smile. He was not above four inches high. He had on a dress-coat. Drusilla afterward described it as a claw-hammer coat, velveteen knickerbockers, and silver buckles on his shoes. His hat was shaped like a thimble, and he had a tiny feather stuck in the side of it.  \"I'm much obliged to you for getting me out of that scrape,\" he said with a bow to all the children. \"It was a pretty tight place. I stayed out last night just one second and a half too late, and when I went to go home I found the door shut. So I just crawled under the bark there for a nap. The log must have turned in some way, for when I woke up and tried to crawl out I found I couldn't manage it. I wouldn't have minded that so much, but just then I saw one of those terrible flat-headed creatures making his way toward me. Why, his head was a sawmill! He was gnawing the wood out of his way and clearing a road to me. I tried to draw my sword, but I couldn't get it from under me. Then I felt the bark rising. I pushed as hard as I could, and here I am.\"  \"Ax 'im his name,\" said Drusilla in an awe-stricken tone.  \"Ah, I forgot,\" responded the little man. \"I know you, but you don't know me. My name is Mr. Thimblefinger, and I shall be happy to serve you. Whenever you want me just tap three times on the head of your bed.\"  \"Thank goodness! I don't sleep in no bed,\" exclaimed Drusilla.  \"That makes no difference,\" said Mr. Thimblefinger. \"If you sleep on a pallet just tap on the floor.\"  \"Please, Mister, don't talk dat a-way,\" pleaded Drusilla, \"kase I'll be constant a-projeckin' wid dat tappin', an' de fus' time you come I'll holler fire.\"  \"Don't notice her,\" said Buster John, \"she talks to hear herself talk.\"  \"I see,\" replied Mr. Thimblefinger, tapping his forehead significantly and nodding his head.  \"You kin nod,\" said Drusilla defiantly, \"but my head got mo' in it dan you kin comb out.\"  \"I believe you!\" exclaimed Mr. Thimblefinger, \"I believe you!\" He spoke so earnestly that Sweetest Susan and Buster John laughed, and Drusilla laughed with them.  \"You dropped your knife,\" said Mr. Thimblefinger. \"I'm sorry of it. I can't bring it up to you, but I'll see if I can't crawl under and get it out.\"  With that he leaped nimbly from log to log and disappeared under the wood-pile. The children went down to see what he would do. They were so astonished at his droll appearance that they forgot their curiosity.  \"Is that a fairy, brother?\" asked Sweetest Susan in a low voice.  \"No!\" exclaimed Buster John with a lofty air, but not loudly. \"Don't you see he's not a bit like the fairies we read about in books? Why, he was afraid of a wood-sawyer.\"  \"That's so,\" Sweetest Susan rejoined.  \"He's a witch, dat what he is,\" said Drusilla.  \"Shucks!\" whispered Buster John. He heard the voice of Mr. Thimblefinger under the wood-pile.  \"I've found it, I've found it!\" he cried. And presently he made his appearance, dragging the knife after him. He tugged at it until he got it out, and then he sat down on a chip, wiped the perspiration from his eyes, and fanned himself with a thin flake of pine bark no bigger than a bee's wing.  \"Pick me up and let's go on top of the wood-pile,\" said Mr. Thimblefinger after a while. \"It's suffocating down here. Ouch! don't tickle me, if you do I shall have a fit.\" Buster John had lifted him by placing a thumb and forefinger under his arms. \"And don't squeeze me, neither,\" the little man went on. \"I was cramped under that bark until I'm as sore as a boil all over. Goodness! I wish I was at home!\"  \"Where do you live?\" asked Sweetest Susan when they were once more seated on the wood-pile.  \"Not far from here, not very far,\" replied Mr. Thimblefinger, shaking his head sagely, \"but it is a different country--oh, entirely different.\"  Sweetest Susan edged away from the little man at this, and Drusilla stretched her eyes.  \"What is it like?\" asked Buster John boldly.  Mr. Thimblefinger reflected a while, and then shook his head. \"I can show it to you,\" he said, \"but I can't describe it.\"  \"Pick 'im up an' show 'im to your ma!\" exclaimed Drusilla suddenly.  \"No, no, no!\" cried Mr. Thimblefinger, leaping to his feet. \"That would spoil everything. No grown person living in this country has ever seen me. No, no! don't try that. It would spoil your luck. I wouldn't be here now if the Dolls' Grandmother hadn't begged me to come with her last night. But I'll come to see you,\"--he pointed at Drusilla. \"I'll come often.\"  \"I des said dat fer ter see what you'd say,\" protested Drusilla. \"You wan' gwine ter take 'im, wuz you, honey?\" This question was addressed to Buster John, who scorned to answer it.  \"Grown people wouldn't understand me,\" Mr. Thimblefinger explained. \"They know a great deal too much to suit me.\"  \"How do you get to your country?\" inquired Buster John, who was keen for an adventure.  \"The nearest way is by the spring,\" replied Mr. Thimblefinger. \"That is the only way you could go.\"  \"Can I go too?\" asked Sweetest Susan. \"And Drusilla?\"  \"Oh, of course,\" said Mr. Thimblefinger, shrugging his shoulders. \"One can go or all can go.\"  \"Do you go down the spring branch?\" asked Buster John.  [Illustration: FOLLOWING LITTLE MR. THIMBLEFINGER]  \"No, no,\" replied Mr. Thimblefinger. \"Below the spring and below the branch.\"  \"Do you mean under the spring?\" Sweetest Susan inquired, with some hesitation.  \"That's it,\" cried Mr. Thimblefinger. \"Right down through the spring and under it.\"  \"Why, we'd drown,\" said Sweetest Susan. \"The spring is deep.\"  \"Well, you'll ha' ter 'skuze me,\" exclaimed Drusilla. \"Dat water's too wet fer me.\"  Buster John waited for an explanation, but none was forthcoming.  \"We couldn't go through the spring, you know,\" he said presently.  \"How do you know?\" asked Mr. Thimblefinger slyly. \"Did you ever try it?\"  He asked each of the children this, and the reply was that none of them had ever tried it.  \"I put my foot in it once,\" said Buster John, \"and the water was just like other spring water. I know we can't go through it.\"  \"Come now!\" Mr. Thimblefinger suggested, \"don't say you know. Sometimes people live to be very old and don't know the very things they ought to know.\"  \"But I know that,\" replied Buster John confidently.  \"Very well, then,\" said Mr. Thimblefinger, pulling out a tiny watch, \"did you ever feel of the water in the spring at precisely nine minutes and nine seconds after twelve o'clock?\"  \"N-o-o-o,\" replied Buster John, taken by surprise, \"I don't think I ever did.\"  \"Of course not!\" cried Mr. Thimblefinger gayly. \"You had no reason. Well, at nine minutes and nine seconds after twelve o'clock the water in the spring is not wet. It is as dry as the air we breathe. It is now two minutes after twelve o'clock. We'll go to the spring, wait until the time comes, and then you will see for yourselves.\"  As they went toward the spring--Mr. Thimblefinger running on before with wonderful agility--Drusilla touched Sweetest Susan on the arm. \"Honey,\" said she, \"don't let dat creetur pull you in de spring. Goodness knows, ef he puts his han' on me I'm gwine ter squall.\"  \"Will you hush?\" exclaimed Buster John impatiently.  \"Watch out, now,\" said Drusilla defiantly. \"Ef you gits drownded in dar I'll sho' tell yo' ma.\"  Fortunately, there was no one near the spring, so Mr. Thimblefinger advanced boldly, followed closely by the children, though Drusilla seemed to hang back somewhat doubtfully. When they arrived there Mr. Thimblefinger took out his tiny timepiece and held it in his hand. The children watched him with breathless interest, especially Buster John, who was thrilled with the idea of having an adventure entirely different from any that he had read of in the story-books.  As the little man stood there holding his watch and looking at it intently, the dinner-bell rang, first in the hallway and then in the back porch. The children remembered it afterward.  \"You all better go git yo' dinner 'fo' it git col', stidder projeckin' 'roun' here wid you dunner what,\" remarked Drusilla.  \"Now!\" exclaimed Mr. Thimblefinger, \"put your hand in the spring.\"  Buster John did as he was bid, and, to his amazement, he could feel no water. He could see it, but he couldn't feel it. He turned pale with excitement and withdrew his hand. Then he put his other hand in, but the result was the same. He plunged his arm in up to the elbow, but his sleeve remained perfectly dry.  \"Try it, sis,\" he cried.  Sweetest Susan did so, and boldly declared there was no water in the spring. She wanted Drusilla to try to wet her hand, but Drusilla sullenly declined.  Mr. Thimblefinger settled the matter by walking into the spring.  \"Now, then, if you are going, come along,\" he cried. \"You have just seventeen and a half seconds.\" He waved his hand from the bottom of the spring and stood waiting. A spring lizard ran near him, and he drew his sword and chased it into a hole. A crawfish showed its head, and he drove it away. Then he waved his hand again. \"Come on, the coast is clear.\"  Buster John put his hand in the water again, and this seemed to satisfy him. He stepped boldly into the spring, and in a moment he stood by Mr. Thimblefinger, laughing, but still excited by the novelty of his experience. He called to his sister:--  \"Come on, sis. It's splendid down here.\"  \"Is it wet?\" she asked plaintively. \"Is it cold?\"  \"No!\" replied Buster John impatiently. \"Don't be a baby.\"  \"Come on, Drusilla! You've got to come. Mamma said you must go wherever we went,\" cried Sweetest Susan.  \"No, ma'am!\" exclaimed Drusilla, with emphasis. \"She"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23871"],["title","A Little Union Scout (#1)"],["body","tell you precisely what occurred. I could hear cries and curses and the explosion of firearms, but beyond that all was mystery.  I had time during the _mêlée_ to take note of the actions of General Forrest, and I observed that a great change had come over him. His face, which was almost as dark as an Indian's when in perfect repose, was now inflamed with passion and almost purple. The veins on his neck stood out as though they were on the point of bursting, and his blazing eyes were bloodshot. Above the din that was going on all around him his voice could be heard by friend and foe alike. I cannot even describe my own feelings.  A courier rode up. He had lost his hat, and there was a spot of blood on his chin. He reported that the Federals were making a desperate effort on the extreme right. \"He's tryin' to git away!\" yelled Forrest in a voice that could be heard all over the field. \"Tell Freeman to take his guns thar and shove 'em in right on top of 'em. We've got the bulge on 'em here, and we're coming right along.\"  [Illustration: \"He's tryin' to git away!\" yelled Forrest in a voice that could be heard all over the field.]  And, sure enough, we began to find less and less resistance in front of us, and presently I could see them running out into the valley, filling the road by which we had come.     II   No pursuit was made at the time, and the Federals, finding that they were not harried, proceeded in a leisurely way toward the river. We followed slowly and at night went into camp, the men and horses getting a good rest. Scouts were coming in to make reports at all hours of the night, so that it was practically true, as one of the old campaigners remarked, that a horse couldn't whicker in the enemy's camp \"but what the General 'd hear it sooner or later.\"  Early the next morning we were on the road, and I had time for reflecting that, after all, war was not a matter of flags and music. The General was very considerate, however--a fact that was due to a letter that General Maury had intrusted to Harry Herndon's care. We were permitted to ride as temporary additions to General Forrest's escort, and he seemed to single us out from among the rest with various little courtesies, which I imagined was something unusual.  He was somewhat inquisitive about Whistling Jim, Harry's body-servant, who he thought was a little too free and easy with white men. But he seemed satisfied when Harry told him that the negro's forebears for many generations back had belonged to the Herndons. We halted for a light dinner, and when we had finished General Forrest made a careful inspection of his men as they filed into the road.  We had gone but a few miles when we came to a point where the roads forked. On one he sent a regiment, with Freeman's battery, with instructions to reach the river ahead of the Federals and hold the ford at all hazards until the main body could come up. This done, we swung into the road that had been taken by the Federals and went forward at a somewhat brisker pace.  \"I'm going to give your nigger the chance of his life,\" remarked General Forrest somewhat grimly, \"and he'll either fling up his hands and go to the Yankees, or he'll take to the woods.\"  \"He may do one or the other,\" replied Harry; \"but if he does either I'll be very much surprised.\" General Forrest laughed; he was evidently very sure that a negro would never stand up before gun-fire. A scout came up to report that the Federals were moving much more rapidly than they had moved in the morning.  \"I reckon he's got wind of the column on the other road,\" the General commented. \"I allowed he'd hear of it. He's a mighty smart man, and he's got as good men as can be found--Western fellows. If he had known the number of my men in the woods back yander he'd 'a' whipped me out of my boots.\" And then his eye fell again on Whistling Jim, who was laughing and joking with some of the troopers. He called to the negro in stern tones, and ordered him to ride close to his young master. \"We are going to have a little scrimmage purty soon, and a nigger that's any account ought to be right where he can help his master if he gets hurt.\"  Whistling Jim's face, which had grown very serious when he heard his name called by the stern commander, suddenly cleared up and became illuminated by a broad grin. \"You hear dat, Marse Harry!\" he exclaimed. \"I'm gwine in right behime you!\" He reflected a moment, and then uttered an exclamation of \"Well, suh!\"  About four o'clock in the afternoon the troopers under General Forrest came in contact with Federals. This was in the nature of a surprise to the Union commander, for there were persistent reports that Forrest had passed on the other road, with the evident intention of harrying the Federals at a point where they had no intention of crossing. So well assured was he that these reports were trustworthy that he was seriously considering the advisability of detaching a force sufficiently large to capture the Confederate. He therefore paid small attention to the attacks on his rear-guard. But presently the pressure became so serious that he sent a member of his staff to investigate it.  Before the officer could perform this duty the rear-guard was compelled to retreat on the main body in the most precipitate manner. Then the attack ceased as suddenly as it began, and the Federal commander concluded that, under all the circumstances, it would be best to cross the river and get in touch with his base of supplies.  He went forward as rapidly as his troops could march, and he had a feeling of relief when he came in sight of the river. It was higher than it had been when he crossed it three or four days before, but still fordable; but as his advance guard began to cross, Freeman's battery, operated by young Morton, opened on them from the ambuscade in which it had been concealed. The thing to do, of course, was to charge the battery and either capture it or silence it, and the Federal commander gave orders to that effect. But Forrest, looking at the matter from a diametrically opposite point of view, knew that the thing to do was to prevent the capture of the battery, and so he increased the pressure upon the Federal rear to such an extent that his opponent had no time to attend to the Confederate battery.  The Union commander was a very able man and had established a reputation as a good fighter. So now, with perfect coolness, he managed to present a very strong front where the rear had been, and he made desperate efforts to protect his flank. But he was too late. Forrest said afterward that it was as pretty a move as he had ever seen, and that if it had been made five minutes sooner it would probably have saved the day.  Just as the movement was about to be completed it was rendered useless by the charge of Forrest's escort, a picked body of men, led by the General in person. In the circumstances such charges were always irresistible. Before the Federals could recover, the Confederate general, by means of a movement so sudden that no commander could have foreseen it, joined his force with that which was supporting Freeman's battery and charged all along the line, bringing the eight and twelve-pounders right to the front. No men, however brave, could stand before a battery at close range, and the inevitable result ensued--they got out of the way, and stood not on the order of their going. They floundered across the river as best they could, and if they had not been American troops they would have been demoralized and rendered useless for fighting purposes; but, being what they were, they showed their courage on many a hard-fought field as the war went on.  When night fell we retired a mile or two from the river and went into camp. Forrest was in high good-humor. He had accomplished all that he had set out to accomplish, and more. He had emphasized the fact that it was dangerous work for the Federals to raid Northern Alabama while he was in striking distance, and he had captured army stores and secured horses that were comparatively fresh. The most welcome capture was the arms, for many of his men were armed with flintlock muskets.  He was very talkative. \"That nigger of yours done about as well as any of the balance of us,\" he said to Harry Herndon.  \"I didn't see him at all during the fighting,\" replied Harry, \"but I told him you'd have him shot if he ran.\"  \"Well, he went right in,\" remarked the General, \"and I expected him to go over to the Yankees. Maybe he'd 'a' gone if it hadn't been for the water.\"  At that moment we heard Whistling Jim calling, \"Marse Harry! Marse Cally Shannon!\" I answered him so that he could find us, and he came up puffing and blowing. A red handkerchief was tied under his chin and over his head.  \"Marse Harry!\" he exclaimed, \"kin I see you an' Marse Cally Shannon by yo'se'f? I done done sump'n dat you'll sho kill me 'bout.\"  \"Well, don't make any secret of it,\" said I. \"Out with it!\" exclaimed Harry.  \"Marse Harry, I done gone an' shot Marse Jack Bledsoe.\"  \"Good Lord!\" cried Harry.  \"Yasser, I done shot 'im, an' he's bad hurt, too. You know dat las' time we went at um? Well, suh, I wuz shootin' at a man right at me, an' he knock my han' down des ez I pull de trigger, an' de ball cotch him right 'twix de hip an' de knee. He call me by my name, an' den it come over me dat we done got mix' up in de shuffle an' dat I wuz shootin' at you. But 'twuz Marse Jack Bledsoe; I know'd 'im time I look at 'im good.\"  \"Good heavens! Is he dead?\" inquired Harry, his voice shaking a little in spite of himself.  \"He ain't dead yit, suh,\" replied Whistling Jim. \"I got down off'n my hoss an' pick 'im up an' take 'im out er de paff er de rucus, an' den when you-all done des ez much shootin' an' killin' ez you wanter, I went back an' put 'im on my hoss an' tuck 'im ter dat little house by de river.
