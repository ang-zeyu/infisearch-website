Mrs. Fishley wanted me--not her husband. She was always wanting me; and somehow I never happened to be in the right place, or to do anything in the right way.  Mrs. Fishley believed she was one of the most amiable, self-denying, self-sacrificing, benevolent women in the world. Nobody else believed it. She had to endure more trials, bear more crosses, undergo more hardships, than any other housekeeper in town. She had to work harder, to think of more things, stagger under more burdens, than all her female neighbors put together. If she ever confessed that she was sometimes just a little cross, she wanted to know who could wonder at it, when she had so much to do, and so many things to think of. Job could be patient, for he had not her family to look after. The saints and martyrs could bow resignedly at the stake in the midst of the flaming fagots; but none of them had to keep house for a husband and three children, and two of them not her own.  To make a fair and just division of Mrs. Fishley's cares, one tenth of them were real, and nine tenths of them were imaginary; and the imaginary ones were more real to her than the actual ones. They soured her temper,--or, more properly, her temper soured them,--and she groaned, complained, snarled, snapped, and fretted, from very early on Sunday morning to very late on Saturday evening. Nothing ever went right with her; nothing ever suited her. If a thing was one way, that was the especial reason why it ought to have been some other way.  She always wanted her own way; and when she had it--which she generally did--it did not suit her any better. I am inclined to think that Captain Fishley himself, at some remote period, long before I was born, had been a more decent man than he was at the time of which I write. If he ever had been, his degeneracy was easily explained; for it would not have been possible for a human being, in daily contact with such a shrewish spitfire as his wife, to exist untainted in the poison which floated in the atmosphere around her.  This was the woman who inflicted herself upon the world, and upon me, though I was by no means the greatest sufferer. If the mischief had stopped here, I could have borne it, and the world could not have helped itself. To me there was something infinitely worse and more intolerable than my own trials--and they were the trials of my poor, dear, deformed, invalid sister. Tender, loving, and patient as she was under them, her sufferings made my blood boil with indignation. If Mrs. Fishley had treated Flora kindly, she would have been an angel in my sight, however much she snapped and snarled, and \"drove me from pillar to post.\" The shrew did not treat her kindly, and as the poor child was almost always in the house, she was constantly exposed to the obliquities of her temper.  My mother, for several years before her death, had been of feeble constitution, and Flora had the \"rickets\" when she was a babe. She was now twelve years old, but the effects of the disease still lingered in her frame. Her limbs were weak, her breast-bone projected, and she was so drawn up that she looked like a \"humpback.\" But what she lacked in body she more than made up in spirit, in the loveliness of an amiable disposition, in an unselfish devotion to others, in a loving heart, and a quick intelligence. She endured, without complaint, the ill nature of Mrs. Fishley, endeavoring, by every means in her power, to make herself useful in the house, and to lighten the load of cares which bore down so heavily upon her hostess.  Mrs. Fishley called me, and I hastened to attend upon her will and pleasure, in the back room. I knew very well that it would make no difference whether I hurried or not; I should \"have to take it\" the moment she saw me. If I was in the barn, I ought to have been in the shop; if in the shop, then I should have been in the barn--unless she had company; and then she was all sweetness, all gentleness; then she was all merciful and compassionate.  \"What are you doing out there?\" snarled she. \"I've been out in the street and into the store after you, and you always are just where no one can find you when you are wanted.\"  I didn't say anything; it wasn't any use.  \"Take that bucket of swill out, and give it to the pigs; and next time don't leave it till it is running over full,\" she continued, in the same amiable, sweet-tempered tones. \"It's strange you can't do anything till you are told to do it. Don't you know that swill-pail wants emptying, without being told of it?\"  \"I always feed the pigs three times a day whether the pail wants emptying or not,\" I ventured to reply, in defence of the pigs rather than myself.  \"There, carry it along, and don't spill it.\"  The pail was filled even with the brim, and it was simply impossible to avoid spilling it.  \"What a careless fellow you are!\" screamed she, her notes on the second added line above the treble staff. \"You are spilling it all over the floor! I wish you could learn to do anything like folks!\"  I wished I could too; but I did not venture to suggest that if she had not filled the pail so full, and even run it over herself before I touched it, I might have carried it \"like folks.\" It was no use; she always got the better of me in an argument. I fed the pigs, as I always did, before I went after the mail, and carried the pail back to the shed. The door of the kitchen was open, and Mrs. Fishley was returning to her work as I entered.  \"You careless child! What do you mean by letting those cakes burn?\" I heard her cry to poor Flora, who was sitting in her arm-chair by the cooking-stove, whereon Mrs. Fishley was baking flapjacks for supper.  \"I didn't know--\"  \"You didn't know, you careless hussy!\" exclaimed Mrs. Fishley, seizing her by the arm, and lifting her roughly out of her chair.  \"O, don't!\" groaned poor Flora.  I could not stand that. I rushed into the kitchen, seized poor Flora's tyrant by the shoulders, and hurled her half way across the room. My blood was up to the boiling point.     CHAPTER II.  FLORA BRADFORD.   I had never seen Mrs. Fishley use violence upon my poor sister before, though I afterwards learned that this was not the first time. I was a solid-built, stout fellow of sixteen; and when I seized the shrew by the shoulders, I was in real earnest. I had not made up my mind for this occasion to keep cool, and I did not keep so. I was as mad as a bear robbed of her cubs.  The idea of Mrs. Fishley's taking my poor deformed sister by the arm, and shaking her, was too revolting, and even horrible, to be endured. If I could bear everything else, I could not bear that. At the present time, I have this pleasant consciousness, that I did not strike the woman; I only grasped her by the shoulders, and hurled her away from her victim. It was a vigorous movement on my part, and Mrs. Fishley staggered till she saved herself by taking hold of a chair. She gathered herself up, and her eyes flashed fire.  \"You rascal, you! What do you mean?\" gasped she; and at the same instant she rushed towards Flora, who was trembling with terror in her chair.  \"Stop a minute, Mrs. Fishley,\" I added.  \"You rascal, you!\" repeated she, looking first at me, and then at Flora.  \"If you put the weight of your little finger on my sister again, I'll tear you in pieces,\" I continued, with both fists clinched.  \"What do you mean, you serpent, you?\"  \"You touch her again, and you will know what I mean.\"  \"Don't, Buckland, don't,\" pleaded poor Flora, alarmed by the hostile demonstration before her.  \"I should like to know!\" cried Mrs. Fishley.  As she did not tell me what she should like to know, I did not tell her. I stood upon the defensive between the virago and my sister's chair.  [Illustration: SHE RUSHED TOWARDS FLORA.--Page 22.]  \"Did any one ever see such a boy!\" continued the termagant, her tones a whole octave above the treble staff, as it seemed to me. \"How dare you put your hand on me?\"  \"I dare.\"  \"You rascal, you!\"  \"You may snap and snarl at me as much as you like; I don't mind it; but you shall not abuse my sister.\"  \"Abuse your sister, you wretch!\" said she, the words hissing from her mouth. \"I should like to know!\"  \"You will know if you touch Flora again,\" I answered.  Somehow I felt as though Mrs. Fishley was not getting the better of me in this argument; and I soon came to the conclusion that she thought so herself, for she settled into a chair, and began to exhibit some symptoms of hysterics.  \"O, dear me!\" she groaned. \"I don't have to work enough to kill common folks, I don't have more trials than any living being, but something new must come upon me. There, I shall give up!\"  \"You must give up abusing Flora,\" I put in.  \"How dare you tell me I abuse her?\" snapped she. \"Haven't I taken the best of care of her? Haven't I made her clothes for her? Haven't I nursed her when she was sick? Haven't I done for her ever since she came into the house?\"  I don't think she had the least idea that she was not the best friend Flora had in the world, so blind are many people to their own errors and shortcomings.  \"She has had enough to eat, and enough to wear; and my brother has paid for all she has had,\" I added. \"But you are continually scolding at her, browbeating her, and making her as uncomfortable and unhappy as you can.\"  \"Scolding her!\" almost whistled Mrs. Fishley, so high was the key. \"I never scold at any one. I never was a scolding woman.\"  \"Gracious!\" I exclaimed, mentally.  \"When things don't suit me, I'm apt to say so; but I never scold,\" whined the shrew. \"Whatever people may say of me, they can't call me a scolding woman.\"  Was it possible she thought so!  \"I don't want to make any trouble, Mrs. Fishley,\" I replied, when she paused, rather for want of breath than for any other reason.  \"Mercy!

Ain't you ashamed of yourself to treat me as you did? You push me about as though you thought I wasn't anybody.\"  \"Are you not ashamed of yourself for shaking that sick child?\" I retorted.  \"I didn't shake her.\"  \"Then I didn't push you.\"  \"You are getting to be a very bad boy, Buck Bradford; and you haven't heard the last of this,\" she said, rising from her chair, and restoring the griddle to the stove, which Flora had taken off. \"I should like to know! Can't I speak to that girl without being treated in that manner? She would let the cakes all burn up before she would touch them.\"  \"I didn't know they were burning, Mrs. Fishley,\" pleaded Flora. \"You didn't tell me to see to them.\"  \"Suppose I didn't tell you! Didn't you know enough not to let them burn? You are a careless, indifferent girl, and it don't make no difference to you how much trouble you make for a body.\"  \"I would have seen to the cakes, if you had spoken to me.\"  \"I don't care anything about the cakes, anyhow,\" I interposed. \"If you can't help scolding Flora, you must keep your hands off her.\"  \"You don't care anything about the cakes! I should like to know! Well, we'll see about it! I'll know who rules here, I vum! I'll call Mr. Fishley! We'll see if you don't care!\" rattled Mrs. Fishley, as she bolted from the kitchen through the entry into the store.  \"O, Buckland, what will become of us!\" exclaimed Flora, rising with difficulty from her chair, and throwing herself upon my breast.  \"Don't be afraid, Flora,\" I replied, pressing her to my heart, while the tears started in my eyes. \"She shall not abuse you, whatever happens to me. While she did it only with her tongue, I bore it; but when she took hold of you, I couldn't stand that, Flora--no, I could not.\"  \"I can bear it very well, Buckland.\" She never called me \"Buck,\" as everybody else did about the place. \"I only fear what they will do to you.\"  \"I can take care of myself, dearest Flora. I am strong and tough, and I can stand almost anything,\" I answered, pressing her to my heart again, for she seemed to be the only person in the world who loved me.  And how I loved her--poor orphan child, weak, sick, and deformed! It seemed to me it would have been different if she had been well and strong, and able to fight her own battle with the hard and cruel world. She was helpless and dependent, and that which shut her out from the rest of the world endeared her to me, and wound her in with every fibre and tendril of my heart.  Mrs. Fishley did not immediately return; neither did her husband appear upon the battle-field; and I concluded that she could not find him.  While, folded in each other's arms, we waited in almost breathless anxiety for the coming of our tyrants, let me give the reader a few necessary particulars in regard to our antecedents and surroundings.  Torrentville, where the story opens, is situated in the south-western part of Wisconsin, though, for obvious reasons, it will not be found on the map. It was located on a stream, which we called the \"Creek,\" though it has since received a more dignified and specific name, about seven miles from Riverport, on the Wisconsin River. At the time of which I write it contained two thousand inhabitants. Captain Fishley--he had been an officer in the militia in some eastern state, and his title had gone west with him--kept the principal store in the place, and was the postmaster.  My father had moved from the State of New York to Torrentville when I was eight years old, and soon after the death of my mother. He had three children, Clarence, Flora, and myself. He bought a farm just out of the village, employed a housekeeper, and for four years got along very well. But he was too ambitious, and worked too hard for his constitution. After a four years' residence in the west, he died. That was a sad day to us, for he was the kindest of fathers. Poor Flora scarcely ceased to weep, at times, for a year, over the loss of her only parent.  Captain Fishley was appointed administrator of the estate, and when it was settled there was hardly fifteen hundred dollars left. My brother Clarence was just twenty-one when my father died, and he was appointed the guardian of Flora and myself. He was considered a very smart young man, and no one doubted his ability to take care of us. But he was dissatisfied with Torrentville; there was not room enough for a young man of his ability to expand himself. He had no taste for farming, and for two years had been a clerk in Captain Fishley's store. He wanted to go to New Orleans, where he believed he could make his fortune. About a year after the death of his father, he decided to try his luck in the metropolis of the south-west.  Clarence was a good brother, and I am sure he would not have gone, if he had not felt satisfied that Flora and myself were well provided for. I was then a boy of thirteen, handy at almost anything about the farm, the house, and the garden, and Captain Fishley wanted me to come and live with him. Clarence agreed to pay Flora's board, so that she was a boarder at the house of the Fishleys. It was stipulated that I should go to school, and do certain \"chores\" for my board, while Clarence paid for my clothes. My principal work, and all that the captain said I should be required to do, was to take care of the horse, and go after the mail every evening.  Instead of this, I was compelled to be at the beck and call of all upon the place, including Ham, the captain's only son, and miserably spoiled at that. Before I had been a year in my new home, I was dissatisfied, for the cloven heels of the three members of the family had appeared. I was crowded with work, picked upon, insulted, and trodden under foot. Perhaps I could have endured my fate, if poor Flora, upon whom our tyrants had no claims, had fared well.  We heard from Clarence occasionally, and learned in general terms, from his letters, that he was doing very well. I did not like to bother him with complaints, and I did not do so till existence had become almost a burden. I think Clarence wrote back to the captain, and for a time there was some improvement in our condition; but it soon became worse than before. I repeated my complaint. My brother wished us to get along as well as we could till he could spare the time to visit us; but that time had not yet arrived.  A few days before my story opens, early in April, I had a letter from him, saying that he was well established in business for himself, and that he would certainly come to Torrentville in October, as soon as the sickly season was over, and take us to New Orleans. He added that he should be married before that time, and would bring his wife with him. This was joyful news, but it was a dreary while to wait.  The door suddenly opened, and Mrs. Fishley bounced into the kitchen, followed by her husband, both of them apparently wrought up to the highest pitch of anger by my misdeeds.     CHAPTER III.  ON THE DEFENSIVE.   At the approach of Captain Fishley, I felt the shudder that swept through the feeble frame of Flora, as she stood infolded in my arms. I gently placed her in the chair again, and released myself from her clinging embrace; for I realized that, in the brief moment left to me, it was necessary to prepare for war. I knew the temper of Captain Fishley; and, though he had never yet struck me, I believed that it was only because I had been all submission.  I was fully resolved to defend myself, and especially to defend Flora. I picked up the heavy iron poker which lay on the back of the stove, and placed myself in front of my trembling sister. The captain was a brute, and his wife was hardly better than a brute. I feared that she, supported by her husband, would again lay violent hands upon Flora, knowing that such a course would sting me deeper than a blow upon my own head.  I did not flourish the poker, or make any irritating demonstrations with it; on the contrary, I held it behind me, rather for use in an emergency than to provoke my tyrants. I was not disposed to make the affair any worse than the circumstances required, and by this time I was cool and self-possessed. Perhaps my critical reader may wonder that a boy of my age should have set so high a value upon controlling his temper, and preserving the use of his faculties in the time of peril, for it is not exactly natural for boys to do so. Youth is hot-blooded, and age and experience are generally required to cool the impetuous current that courses through its veins.  My father--blessings on his memory--had taught me the lesson. One day, a fire in the long grass of the prairie threatened the destruction of all our buildings. Clarence and myself went into a flurry, and did a great many stupid things, so excited that we did not know what we were about. Father stopped in the midst of the danger to reprove us, and gave us such a solemn and impressive lesson on the necessity of keeping cool, that I never forgot it. Then he told us to harness the horses to the plough. Clarence struck a furrow along the imperilled side of the house; my father mowed a wide swath through the tall grass, and I raked it away. Before the fire reached us, we had made a barrier which it could not pass. We kept cool, and fought the devouring element with entire success.  I do not mean to say that I never got mad; only that, when I had a fair chance to think an instant, I nerved myself to a degree of self-possession which enabled me to avoid doing stupid things. Such was my frame of mind on the present occasion, and I coolly awaited the coming of the tyrants. Both of them were boiling over with wrath when they entered the kitchen, and rushed towards me so fiercely that I thought they intended to overwhelm me at a single blow.  \"What does all this mean, Buck? What have you been doing?\" demanded Captain Fishley, as soon as he had crossed the threshold of the room.  I deemed it advisable to make no answer.  \"I'll teach you to insult"]]]
