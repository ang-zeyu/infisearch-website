When she has you back she'll forgit it all, though. There's eight of us on the \"We're Here\", an' ef we went back naow--it's more'n a thousand mile--we'd lose the season. The men they wouldn't hev it, allowin' I was agreeable.\"  \"But my father would make it all right.\"  \"He'd try. I don't doubt he'd try,\" said Troop; \"but a whole season's catch is eight men's bread; an' you'll be better in your health when you see him in the fall. Go forward an' help Dan. It's ten an' a ha'af a month, ez I said, an', o' course, all f'und, same ez the rest o' us.\"  \"Do you mean I'm to clean pots and pans and things?\" said Harvey.  \"An' other things. You've no call to shout, young feller.\"  \"I won't! My father will give you enough to buy this dirty little fish-kettle\"--Harvey stamped on the deck--\"ten times over, if you take me to New York safe; and--and--you're in a hundred and thirty by me, anyway.\"  \"Ha-ow?\" said Troop, the iron face darkening.  \"How? You know how, well enough. On top of all that, you want me to do menial work\"--Harvey was very proud of that adjective--\"till the Fall. I tell you I will not. You hear?\"  Troop regarded the top of the mainmast with deep interest for a while, as Harvey harangued fiercely all around him.  \"Hsh!\" he said at last. \"I'm figurin' out my responsibilities in my own mind. It's a matter o' jedgment.\"  Dan Stole up and plucked Harvey by the elbow. \"Don't go to tamperin' with dad any more,\" he pleaded. \"You've called him a thief two or three times over, an' he don't take that from any livin' bein'.\"  \"I won't!\" Harvey almost shrieked, disregarding the advice; and still Troop meditated.  \"Seems kinder unneighbourly,\" he said at last, his eye travelling down to Harvey. \"I don't blame you, not a mite, young feller, nor you won't blame me when the bile's out o' your systim. 'Be sure you sense what I say? Ten an' a ha'af fer second boy on the schooner--an' all f'und--fer to teach you an' fer the sake o' your health. Yes or no?\"  \"No!\" said Harvey. \"Take me back to New York or I'll see you--\"  He did not exactly remember what followed. He was lying in the scuppers, holding on to a nose that bled, while Troop looked down on him serenely.  \"Dan,\" he said to his son, \"I was sot ag'in' this young feller when I first saw him, on account o' hasty jedgments. Never you be led astray by hasty jedgments, Dan. Naow I'm sorry for him, because he's clear distracted in his upper works. He ain't responsible fer the names he's give me, nor fer his other statements nor fer jumpin' overboard, which I'm abaout ha'af convinced he did. You be gentle with him, Dan, 'r I'll give you twice what I've give him. Them hemmeridges clears the head. Let him sluice it off!\"  Troop went down solemnly into the cabin, where he and the older men bunked, leaving Dan to comfort the luckless heir to thirty millions.    CHAPTER II  \"I warned ye,\" said Dan, as the drops fell thick and fast on the dark, oiled planking. \"Dad ain't noways hasty, but you fair earned it. Pshaw! there's no sense takin' on so.\" Harvey's shoulders were rising and falling in spasms of dry sobbing. \"I know the feelin'. First time dad laid me out was the last--and that was my first trip. Makes ye feel sickish an' lonesome. I know.\"  \"It does,\" moaned Harvey. \"That man's either crazy or drunk, and--and I can't do anything.\"  \"Don't say that to dad,\" whispered Dan. \"He's set ag'in' all liquor, an'--well, he told me you was the madman. What in creation made you call him a thief? He's my dad.\"  Harvey sat up, mopped his nose, and told the story of the missing wad of bills. \"I'm not crazy,\" he wound up. \"Only--your father has never seen more than a five-dollar bill at a time, and my father could buy up this boat once a week and never miss it.\"  \"You don't know what the \"We're Here's\" worth. Your dad must hey a pile o' money. How did he git it? Dad sez loonies can't shake out a straight yarn. Go ahead.\"  \"In gold-mines and things, West.\"  \"I've read o' that kind o' business. Out West, too? Does he go around with a pistol on a trick-pony, same ez the circus? They call that the Wild West, and I've heard that their spurs an' bridles was solid silver.\"  \"You are a chump!\" said Harvey, amused in spite of himself. \"My father hasn't any use for ponies. When he wants to ride he takes his car.\"  \"Haow? Lobster-car?\"  \"No. His own private car, of course. You've seen a private car some time in your life?\"  \"Slatin Beeman he hez one,\" said Dan, cautiously. \"I saw her at the Union Depot in Boston, with three niggers hoggin' her run.\" (Dan meant cleaning the windows.) \"But Slatin Beeman he owns 'baout every railroad on Long Island, they say; an' they say he's bought 'baout ha'af Noo Hampshire an' run a line-fence around her, an' filled her up with lions an' tigers an' bears an' buffalo an' crocodiles an' such all. Slatin Beeman he's a millionaire. I've seen his car. Yes?\"  \"Well, my father's what they call a multi-millionaire; and he has two private cars. One's named for me, the 'Harvey,' and one for my mother, the 'Constance.'\"  \"Hold on,\" said Dan. \"Dad don't ever let me swear, but I guess you can. 'Fore we go ahead, I want you to say hope you may die if you're lying.\"  \"Of course,\" said Harvey.  \"Thet ain't 'nuff. Say, 'Hope I may die if I ain't speakin' truth.'\"  \"Hope I may die right here,\" said Harvey, \"if every word I've spoken isn't the cold truth.\"  \"Hundred an' thirty-four dollars an' all?\" said Dan. \"I heard ye talkin' to dad, an' I ha'af looked you'd be swallered up, same's Jonah.\"  Harvey protested himself red in the face. Dan was a shrewd young person along his own lines, and ten minutes' questioning convinced him that Harvey was not lying--much. Besides, he had bound himself by the most terrible oath known to boyhood, and yet he sat, alive, with a red-ended nose, in the scuppers, recounting marvels upon marvels.  \"Gosh!\" said Dan at last, from the very bottom of his soul, when Harvey had completed an inventory of the car named in his honour. Then a grin of mischievous delight overspread his broad face. \"I believe you, Harvey. Dad's made a mistake fer once in his life.\"  \"He has, sure,\" said Harvey, who was meditating an early revenge.  \"He'll be mad clear through. Dad jest hates to be mistook in his jedgments.\" Dan lay back and slapped his thigh. \"Oh, Harvey, don't you spile the catch by lettin' on.\"  \"I don't want to be knocked down again. I'll get even with him, though.\"  \"Never heard any man ever got even with dad. But he'd knock ye down again sure. The more he was mistook the more he'd do it. But gold-mines and pistols--\"  \"I never said a word about pistols,\" Harvey cut in, for he was on his oath.  \"Thet's so; no more you did. Two private cars, then, one named fer you an' one fer her; an' two hundred dollars a month pocket-money, all knocked into the scuppers fer not workin' fer ten an' a ha'af a month! It's the top haul o' the season.\" He exploded with noiseless chuckles.  \"Then I was right? \"said Harvey, who thought he had found a sympathiser.  \"You was wrong; the wrongest kind o' wrong! You take right hold an' pitch in 'longside o' me, or you'll catch it, an' I'll catch it fer backin' you up. Dad always gives me double helps 'cause I'm his son, an' he hates favourin' folk. 'Guess you're kinder mad at dad. I've been that way time an' again. But dad's a mighty jest man; all the fleet says so.\"  \"Looks like justice, this, don't it?\" Harvey pointed to his outraged nose.  \"Thet's nothin'. Lets the shore blood outer you. Dad did it for yer health. Say, though, I can't have dealin's with a man that thinks me or dad or any one on the \"We're Here's\" a thief.  We ain't any common wharf-end crowd by any manner o' means. We're fishermen, an' we've shipped together for six years an' more. Don't you make any mistake on that! I told ye dad don't let me swear. He calls 'em vain oaths, and pounds me; but ef I could say what you said 'baout your pap an' his fixin's, I'd say that 'baout your dollars. I dunno what was in your pockets when I dried your kit, fer I didn't look to see; but I'd say, using the very same words ez you used jest now, neither me nor dad--an' we was the only two that teched you after you was brought aboard--knows anythin' 'baout the money. Thet's my say. Naow?\"  The bloodletting had certainly cleared Harvey's brain, and maybe the loneliness of the sea had something to do with it. \"That's all right,\" he said. Then he looked down confusedly. \"'Seems to me that for a fellow just saved from drowning I haven't been over and above grateful, Dan.\"  \"Well, you was shook up and silly,\" said Dan. \"Anyway, there was only dad an' me aboard to see it. The cook he don't count.\"  \"I might have thought about losing the bills that way,\" Harvey said, half to himself, \"instead of calling everybody in sight a thief Where's your father?\"  \"In the cabin What d' you want o' him again?\"  \"You'll see,\" said Harvey, and he stepped, rather groggily, for his head was still singing, to the cabin steps, where the little ship's clock hung in plain sight of the wheel. Troop, in the chocolate-and-yellow painted cabin, was busy with a note-book and an enormous black pencil, which he sucked hard from time to time.  \"I haven't acted quite right,\" said Harvey, surprised at his own meekness.  \"What's wrong naow?\" said the skipper \"Walked into Dan, hev ye?\"  \"No; it's about you.\"  \"I'm here to listen.\"  \"Well, I--I'm here to take things back,\" said Harvey, very quickly. \"When a man's saved from drowning--\" he gulped.  \"Ey? You'll make a man yet ef you go on this way.\"  \"He oughtn't begin by calling people names.\"  \"Jest an' right--right an' jest,\" said Troop, with the ghost of a dry smile.  \"So I'm here to say I'm sorry.\" Another big gulp.  Troop heaved himself slowly off the locker he was sitting on and held out an eleven-inch hand. \"I mistrusted 'twould do you sights o' good; an' this shows I weren't mistook in my jedgments.\" A"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22252"],["title","Rollo on the Atlantic (#1)"],["body","f.\"  \"And of Jane, too?\" asked Mrs. Holiday.  \"Yes,\" replied Mr. Holiday, \"and of Jane, too; that is, with the help of the chambermaids. They have excellent chambermaids on board the Atlantic steamers.\"  So it was concluded to send for Rollo and Jane to embark on board the steamer at New York, and sail for Europe. Mr. Holiday wrote to Rollo's uncle George, requesting him to make the necessary arrangements for the voyage, and then to take the children to New York, and put them on board. He was to commit them, if possible, to the charge of some one of the passengers on board the ship. If, for any reason, he should not succeed in finding any passenger to take care of them, he was to state the case to the captain of the ship, that he might see to them a little from time to time; and, in addition to this, he was to put them under the special charge of one of the chambermaids, promising her that she should be well rewarded for her services, on the arrival of the ship in Liverpool.  The important tidings of the determination which had been made, that Rollo and Jane should actually cross the Atlantic, were first announced to the children one evening near the end of May. They were eating their supper at the time, seated on a stone seat at the bottom of the garden, where there was a brook. Their supper, as it consisted of a bowl of bread and milk for each, was very portable; and they had accordingly gone down to their stone seat to eat it, as they often did on pleasant summer evenings. The stone seat was in such a position that the setting sun shone very cheerily upon it. On this occasion, Rollo had finished his milk, and was just going down to the brook by a little path which led that way, in order to see if there were any fishes in the water; while Jane was giving the last spoonful of her milk to their kitten. On the stone near where Jane was sitting was a small birdcage. This cage was one which Jane used to put her kitten in. The kitten was of a mottled color, which gave to its fur somewhat the appearance of spots; and so Jane called the little puss her _tiger_. As it was obviously proper that a tiger should be kept in a cage, Jane had taken a canary birdcage, which she found one day in the garret, and had used it to put the kitten in. As she took the precaution never to keep the prisoner shut up long at a time, and as she almost always fed it in the cage, the kitten generally made no objections to going in whenever Jane desired it.  \"Here comes uncle George,\" said Rollo.  Jane was so busy pouring the spoonful of milk through the bars of the cage into a little shallow basin, which she kept for the purpose within, that she could not look up.  \"He is coming down through the garden,\" added Rollo; \"and he has got a letter in his hand. It's from mother, I know.\"  So saying, Rollo began to caper about with delight, and then ran off to meet his uncle. Jane finished the work of pouring out the milk as soon as possible, and then followed him. They soon came back again, however, accompanying their uncle, and conducting him to the stone seat, where the children sat down to hear the letter.  \"Rollo,\" said Mr. George, \"how should you like to go to England?\"  \"To go to England?\" said Rollo, in a tone of exultation; \"_very much indeed_.\"  \"Should you dare to go alone?\" said Mr. George; \"that is, with nobody to take care of you?\"  \"Yes, indeed!\" said Rollo, emphatically. \"I should not need any body to take care of me.\"  \"I don't know but you will have to go,\" said Mr. George; \"and not only take care of yourself, but of Jane besides.\"  \"Why, am I to go too?\" asked Jane. As she said this, she began to look quite alarmed.  \"How should you like the plan?\" said Mr. George.  \"O, I should not _dare_ to go,\" said Jane, shaking her head with a very serious air. \"I should not dare to go at all, unless I had somebody to take care of me bigger than Rollo.\"  \"Ha!\" exclaimed Rollo, \"I could take care of you perfectly well. I could buy the tickets and show you down to supper, and help you over the plank at the landings, and every thing else.\"  Rollo's experience of steamer life had been confined to trips on Long Island Sound, or up and down the Hudson River.  \"I suppose you would be dreadfully sick on the way,\" said Mr. George.  \"O, no,\" said Rollo, \"I should not be sick. What's the use of being sick? Besides, I never _am_ sick in a steamboat.\"  \"No,\" said Jane, shaking her head and looking quite anxious; \"I should not dare to go with you at all. I should not _dare_ to go unless my mother were here to go with me; or my father, at least.\"  \"I am afraid you will have to go,\" said Mr. George, \"whether you are afraid to or not.\"  \"That I shall have to go?\" repeated Jane.  \"Yes,\" replied Mr. George. \"Your father has written me that he is not well enough to come home, and I am to send you and Rollo out in the next steamer. So that you see you have nothing to say or to do about it. All you have to do is to submit to destiny.\"  Jane did not know very precisely what was meant by the phrase, _submitting to destiny_; but she understood very well that, in this case, it meant that she must go to England to join her father and mother, whether she liked the plan or not. She was silent a moment, and looked very thoughtful. She then put forth her hand to her kitten, which was just at that moment coming out of the cage, having finished drinking the milk which she had put there for it, and took it into her lap, saying at the same time,--  \"Well, then I will go; only you must let me take my Tiger with me.\"  \"That you can do,\" said Mr. George. \"I am very willing to compromise the matter with you in that way. You can take Tiger with you, if you choose.\"  \"And the cage too?\" said Jane, putting her hand upon the ring at the top of it.  \"Yes,\" said Mr. George, \"and the cage too.\"  \"Well!\" said Jane, speaking in a tone of great satisfaction and joyousness, \"then I will go. Get into the cage, Tiger, and we'll go and get ready.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The steamer was to sail in about a week from this time. So Mr. George proceeded immediately to New York to engage passage. When Rollo's aunt, who had had the care of him and Jane during the absence of Mr. and Mrs. Holiday, heard how soon the steamer would sail, she said that she did not think that that would afford time enough to get the children ready.  \"O, it takes no time,\" said Mr. George, \"to get people ready to go to Europe. Put into a trunk plenty of plain common clothing for the voyage, and the work is done. As for the rest, people can generally find pretty much every thing they want on the other side.\"  Mr. George went to New York to engage the passage for the children. And inasmuch as many of the readers of this book who reside in the country may never have had the opportunity of witnessing the arrangements connected with Atlantic steamers, they may perhaps like to know how this was done. In the first place, it was necessary to get a _permit_ to go on board the ship. The crowds of people in New York, who are always going to and fro, are so great, and the interest felt in these great steamships is so strong, that if every body were allowed free access and egress to them, the decks and cabins of the vessels would be always in confusion. So they build a barricade across the great pier at which the ships lie, with ponderous gates, one large one for carts and carriages, and another smaller one for people on foot, opening through it, and no one is admitted without a ticket. Mr. George went to the office in Wall Street and procured such a ticket, which one of the clerks in attendance there gave him, on his saying that he wished to go on board to select a state room for some passengers.  Provided with this ticket, Mr. George took an omnibus at Wall Street and rode up to Canal Street. At Canal Street he took another omnibus, which carried him nearly to the East River. There he left the omnibus, and proceeded the rest of the way on foot. The crowd of people on the sidewalks going and coming, and of carts, drays, wagons, and coaches in the street, was immense. There was one crossing where, for some time, Mr. George could not get over, so innumerable and closely wedged together were the vehicles of all descriptions that occupied the way. There were many people that were stopped with him on the sidewalk. Among them was a servant girl, with a little boy under her charge, whom she was leading by the hand. The girl looked very anxious, not knowing how to get across the street.  \"Let me carry the child across for you,\" said Mr. George.  So saying he took the child up gently, but quickly, in his arms, and watching a momentary opening in the stream of carriages, he pressed through, the servant girl following him. He set the boy down upon the sidewalk. The girl said that she was very much obliged to him, _indeed_; and then Mr. George went on.  Just then a small and ragged boy held out his hand, and with a most woe-begone expression of countenance and a piteous tone of voice, begged Mr. George to give him a few pennies, to keep him from starving. Mr. George took no notice of him, but passed on. A moment afterward he turned round to look at the boy again. He saw him take a top out of his pocket, and go to spinning it upon the sidewalk, and then, suddenly seeing some other boys, the young rogue caught up his top and ran after them with shouts of great hilarity and glee. He was an impostor; Mr. George knew this when he refused to give him any money.  [Illustration: THE PIER.]  Mr. George then went on again. He came, at length, to the great gates which led to the pier. There was a man just within the gate, walking to and fro, near the door of a sort of office, or lodge, which he kept there. Mr. George attempted to open the gate.  \"Please show your ticket, sir,\" said he.  Mr. George took out his ticket and gave it to the porter, whereupon the porter opened the gate and let him in.  Mr. George found himself under an"]]]
