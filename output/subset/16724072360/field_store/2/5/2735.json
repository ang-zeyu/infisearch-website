Hard radiation?”  No answer.  “It doesn’t really make any difference, of course,” said Orne. “I’m here to help you.”  “I am Tanub, High Path Chief of the Grazzi,” said the native. “I decide who is to help.”  Orne swallowed.  “Where do you go?” demanded Tanub.  “I was hoping to go to your city. Is it permitted?”  A long pause while the vertical-slit pupils of Tanub’s eyes expanded and contracted. “It is permitted.”  Stetson’s voice came through the hidden speaker: _“All bets off. We’re coming in after you. That Mark XX is the final straw. It means they have the_ Delphinus _for sure!”_  Orne touched his throat. _“No! Give me a little more time!”_  _“Why?”_  _“I have a hunch about these creatures.”_  _“What is it?”_  _“No time now. Trust me.”_  Another long pause in which Orne and Tanub continued to study each other. Presently, Stetson said: _“O.K. Go ahead as planned. But find out where the_ Delphinus _is! If we get that back we pull their teeth.”_  “Why do you keep touching your throat?” demanded Tanub.  “I’m nervous,” said Orne. “Guns always make me nervous.”  The muzzle lowered slightly.  “Shall we continue on to your city?” asked Orne. He wet his lips with his tongue. The cab light on Tanub’s face was giving the Gienahn an eerie sinister look.  “We can go soon,” said Tanub.  “Will you join me inside here?” asked Orne. “There’s a passenger seat right behind me.”  Tanub’s eyes moved catlike: right, left. “Yes.” He turned, barked an order into the jungle gloom, then climbed in behind Orne.  “When do we go?” asked Orne.  “The great sun will be down soon,” said Tanub. “We can continue as soon as Chiranachuruso rises.”  “Chiranachuruso?”  “Our satellite ... our moon,” said Tanub.  “It’s a beautiful word,” said Orne. “Chiranachuruso.”  “In our tongue it means: The Limb of Victory,” said Tanub. “By its light we will continue.”  Orne turned, looked back at Tanub. “Do you mean to tell me that you can see by what light gets down here through those trees?”  “Can you not see?” asked Tanub.  “Not without the headlights.”  “Our eyes differ,” said Tanub. He bent toward Orne, peered. The vertical slit pupils of his eyes expanded, contracted. “You are the same as the ... others.”  “Oh, on the _Delphinus_?”  Pause. “Yes.”  Presently, a greater gloom came over the jungle, bringing a sudden stillness to the wild life. There was a chittering commotion from the natives in the trees around the sled. Tanub shifted behind Orne.  “We may go now,” he said. “Slowly ... to stay behind my ... scouts.”  “Right.” Orne eased the sled forward around an obstructing root.         *       *       *       *       *  Silence while they crawled ahead. Around them shapes flung themselves from vine to vine.  “I admired your city from the air,” said Orne. “It is very beautiful.”  “Yes,” said Tanub. “Why did you land so far from it?”  “We didn’t want to come down where we might destroy anything.”  “There is nothing to destroy in the jungle,” said Tanub.  “Why do you have such a big city?” asked Orne.  Silence.  “I said: Why do you—”  “You are ignorant of our ways,” said Tanub. “Therefore, I forgive you. The city is for our race. We must breed and be born in sunlight. Once—long ago—we used crude platforms on the tops of the trees. Now ... only the ... wild ones do this.”  Stetson’s voice hissed in Orne’s ears: _“Easy on the sex line, boy. That’s always touchy. These creatures are oviparous. Sex glands are apparently hidden in that long fur behind where their chins ought to be.”_  “Who controls the breeding sites controls our world,” said Tanub. “Once there was another city. We destroyed it.”  “Are there many ... wild ones?” asked Orne.  “Fewer each year,” said Tanub.  _“There’s how they get their slaves,”_ hissed Stetson.  “You speak excellent Galactese,” said Orne.  “The High Path Chief commanded the best teacher,” said Tanub. “Do you, too, know many things, Orne?”  “That’s why I was sent here,” said Orne.  “Are there many planets to teach?” asked Tanub.  “Very many,” said Orne. “Your city—I saw very tall buildings. Of what do you build them?”  “In your tongue—glass,” said Tanub. “The engineers of the _Delphinus_ said it was impossible. As you saw—they are wrong.”  _“A glass-blowing culture,”_ hissed Stetson. _“That’d explain a lot of things.”_  Slowly, the disguised sled crept through the jungle. Once, a scout swooped down into the headlights, waved. Orne stopped on Tanub’s order, and they waited almost ten minutes before proceeding.  “Wild ones?” asked Orne.  “Perhaps,” said Tanub.  A glowing of many lights grew visible through the giant tree trunks. It grew brighter as the sled crept through the last of the jungle, emerged in cleared land at the edge of the city.  Orne stared upward in awe. The city fluted and spiraled into the moonlit sky. It was a fragile appearing lacery of bridges, winking dots of light. The bridges wove back and forth from building to building until the entire visible network appeared one gigantic dew-glittering web.  “All that with glass,” murmured Orne.  _“What’s happening?”_ hissed Stetson.  Orne touched his throat contact. _“We’re just into the city clearing, proceeding toward the nearest building.”_  “This is far enough,” said Tanub.         *       *       *       *       *  Orne stopped the sled. In the moonlight, he could see armed Gienahns all around. The buttressed pedestal of one of the buildings loomed directly ahead. It looked taller than had the scout cruiser in its jungle landing circle.  Tanub leaned close to Orne’s shoulder. “We have not deceived you, have we, Orne?”  “Huh? What do you mean?”  “You have recognized that we are not mutated members of your race.”  Orne swallowed. Into his ears came Stetson’s voice: _“Better admit it.”_  “That’s true,” said Orne.  “I like you, Orne,” said Tanub. “You shall be one of my slaves. You will teach me many things.”  “How did you capture the _Delphinus_?” asked Orne.  “You know that, too?”  “You have one of their rifles,” said Orne.  “Your race is no match for us, Orne ... in cunning, in strength, in the prowess of the mind. Your ship landed to repair its tubes. Very inferior ceramics in those tubes.”  Orne turned, looked at Tanub in the dim glow of the cab light. “Have you heard about the I-A, Tanub?”  “I-A? What is that?” There was a wary tenseness in the Gienahn’s figure. His mouth opened to reveal the long canines.  “You took the _Delphinus_ by treachery?” asked Orne.  “They were simple fools,” said Tanub. “We are smaller, thus they thought us weaker.” The Mark XX’s muzzle came around to center on Orne’s stomach. “You have not answered my question. What is the I-A?”  “I am of the I-A,” said Orne. “Where’ve you hidden the _Delphinus_?”  “In the place that suits us best,” said Tanub. “In all our history there has never been a better place.”  “What do you plan to do with it?” asked Orne.  “Within a year we will have a copy with our own improvements. After that—”  “You intend to start a war?” asked Orne.  “In the jungle the strong slay the weak until only the strong remain,” said Tanub.  “And then the strong prey upon each other?” asked Orne.  “That is a quibble for women,” said Tanub.  “It’s too bad you feel that way,” said Orne. “When two cultures meet like this they tend to help each other. What have you done with the crew of the _Delphinus_?”  “They are slaves,” said Tanub. “Those who still live. Some resisted. Others objected to teaching us what we want to know.” He waved the gun muzzle. “You will not be that foolish, will you, Orne?”  “No need to be,” said Orne. “I’ve another little lesson to teach you: I already know where you’ve hidden the _Delphinus_.”  _“Go, boy!”_ hissed Stetson. _“Where is it?”_  “Impossible!” barked Tanub.  “It’s on your moon,” said Orne. “Darkside. It’s on a mountain on the darkside of your moon.”  Tanub’s eyes dilated, contracted. “You read minds?”  “The I-A has no need to read minds,” said Orne. “We rely on superior mental prowess.”  _“The marines are on their way,”_ hissed Stetson. _“We’re coming in to get you. I’m going to want to know how you guessed that one.”_  “You are a weak fool like the others,” gritted Tanub.  “It’s too bad you formed your opinion of us by observing only the low grades of the R&R,” said Orne.  _“Easy, boy,”_ hissed Stetson. _“Don’t pick a fight with him now. Remember, his race is arboreal. He’s probably as strong as an ape.”_  “I could kill you where you sit!” grated Tanub.  “You write finish for your entire planet if you do,” said Orne. “I’m not alone. There are others listening to every word we say. There’s a ship overhead that could split open your planet with one bomb—wash it with molten rock. It’d run like the glass you use for your buildings.”  “You are lying!”  “We’ll make you an offer,” said Orne. “We don’t really want to exterminate you. We’ll give you limited membership in the Galactic Federation until you prove you’re no menace to us.”  _“Keep talking,”_ hissed Stetson. _“Keep him interested.”_  “You dare insult me!” growled Tanub.  “You had better believe me,” said Orne. “We—”  Stetson’s voice interrupted him: _“Got it, Orne! They caught the_ Delphinus _on the ground right where you said it’d be! Blew the tubes off it. Marines now mopping up.”_  “It’s like this,” said Orne. “We already have recaptured the _Delphinus_.” Tanub’s eyes went instinctively skyward. “Except for the captured armament you still hold, you obviously don’t have the weapons to meet us,” continued Orne. “Otherwise, you wouldn’t be carrying that rifle off the _Delphinus_.”  “If you speak the truth, then we shall die bravely,” said Tanub.  “No need for you to die,” said Orne.  “Better to die than be slaves,” said Tanub.  “We don’t need slaves,” said Orne. “We—”  “I cannot take the chance that you are lying,” said Tanub. “I must kill you now.”     "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2323"],["title","Recollections and Letters of General Robert E. Lee (#1)"],["body","wonder at me, and seem at a loss to reconcile what they see and what was pictured in their imaginations. I find them, too, much grown, and all well, and I have much cause for thankfulness, and gratitude to that good God who has once more united us.”  My next recollection of my father is in Baltimore, while we were on a visit to his sister, Mrs. Marshall, the wife of Judge Marshall. I remember being down on the wharves, where my father had taken me to see the landing of a mustang pony which he had gotten for me in Mexico, and which had been shipped from Vera Cruz to Baltimore in a sailing vessel. I was all eyes for the pony, and a very miserable, sad-looking object he was. From his long voyage, cramped quarters and unavoidable lack of grooming, he was rather a disappointment to me, but I soon got over all that. As I grew older, and was able to ride and appreciate him, he became the joy and pride of my life. I was taught to ride on him by Jim Connally, the faithful Irish servant of my father, who had been with him in Mexico. Jim used to tell me, in his quizzical way, that he and “Santa Anna” (the pony’s name) were the first men on the walls of Chepultepec. This pony was pure white, five years old and about fourteen hands high. For his inches, he was as good a horse as I ever have seen. While we lived in Baltimore, he and “Grace Darling,” my father’s favourite mare, were members of our family.  Grace Darling was a chestnut of fine size and of great power, which he had bought in Texas on his way out to Mexico, her owner having died on the march out. She was with him during the entire campaign, and was shot seven times; at least, as a little fellow I used to brag about that number of bullets being in her, and since I could point out the scars of each one, I presume it was so. My father was very much attached to her and proud of her, always petting her and talking to her in a loving way, when he rode her or went to see her in her stall. Of her he wrote on his return home:  “I only arrived yesterday, after a long journey up the Mississippi, which route I was induced to take, for the better accommodation of my horse, as I wished to spare her as much annoyance and fatigue as possible, she already having undergone so much suffering in my service. I landed her at Wheeling and left her to come over with Jim.”  Santa Anna was found lying cold and dead in the park at Arlington one morning in the winter of ‘60-’61. Grace Darling was taken in the spring of ‘62 from the White House [My brother’s place on the Pamunkey River, where the mare had been sent for save keeping.”] by some Federal quartermaster, when McClellan occupied that place as his base of supplies during his attack on Richmond. When we lived in Baltimore, I was greatly struck one day by hearing two ladies who were visiting us saying:  “Everybody and everything--his family, his friends, his horse, and his dog--loves Colonel Lee.”  The dog referred to was a black-and-tan terrier named “Spec,” very bright and intelligent and really a member of the family, respected and beloved by ourselves and well known to all who knew us. My father picked up his mother in the “Narrows” while crossing from Fort Hamilton to the fortifications opposite on Staten Island. She had doubtless fallen overboard from some passing vessel and had drifted out of sight before her absence had been discovered. He rescued her and took her home, where she was welcomed by his children an made much of. She was a handsome little thing, with cropped ears and a short tail. My father named her “Dart.” She was a fine ratter, and with the assistance of a Maltese cat, also a member of the family, the many rats which infested the house and stables were driven away or destroyed. She and the cat were fed out of the same plate, but Dart was not allowed to begin the meal until the cat had finished.  Spec was born at Fort Hamilton and was the joy of us children, our pet and companion. My father would not allow his tail and ears to be cropped. When he grew up, he accompanied us everywhere and was in the habit of going into church with the family. As some of the little ones allowed their devotions to be disturbed by Spec’s presence, my father determined to leave him at home on those occasions. So the next Sunday morning, he was sent up to the front room of the second story. After the family had left for church he contented himself for awhile looking out of the window, which was open, it being summer time. Presently impatience overcame his judgement and he jumped to the ground, landed safely notwithstanding the distance, joined the family just as they reached the church, and went in with them as usual, much to the joy of the children. After that he was allowed to go to church whenever he wished. My father was very fond of him, and loved to talk to him and about him as if he were really one of us. In a letter to my mother, dated Fort Hamilton, January 18, 1846, when she and her children were on a visit to Arlington, he thus speaks of him:  “...I am very solitary, and my only company is my dogs and cats. But ‘Spec’ has become so jealous now that he will hardly let me look at the cats. He seems to be afraid that I am going off from him, and never lets me stir without him. Lies down in the office from eight to four without moving, and turns himself before the fire as the side from it becomes cold. I catch him sometimes sitting up looking at me so intently that I am for a moment startled...”  In a letter from Mexico written a year later--December 25, ‘46, to my mother, he says:  “...Can’t you cure poor ‘Spec.’ Cheer him up--take him to walk with you and tell the children to cheer him up...”  In another letter from Mexico to his eldest boy, just after the capture of Vera Cruz, he sends this message to Spec....  “Tell him I wish he was here with me. He would have been of great service in telling me when I was coming upon the Mexicans. When I was reconnoitering around Vera Cruz, their dogs frequently told me by barking when I was approaching them too nearly....”  When he returned to Arlington from Mexico, Spec was the first to recognise him, and the extravagance of his demonstrations of delight left no doubt that he knew at once his kind master and loving friend, though he had been absent three years. Sometime during our residence in Baltimore, Spec disappeared, and we never knew his fate.  From that early time I began to be impressed with my father’s character, as compared with other men. Every member of the household respected, revered and loved him as a matter of course, but it began to dawn on me that every one else with whom I was thrown held him high in their regard. At forty-five years of age he was active, strong, and as handsome as he had ever been. I never remember his being ill. I presume he was indisposed at times; but no impressions of that kind remain. He was always bright and gay with us little folk, romping, playing, and joking with us. With the older children, he was just as companionable, and the have seen him join my elder brothers and their friends when they would try their powers at a high jump put up in our yard. The two younger children he petted a great deal, and our greatest treat was to get into his bed in the morning and lie close to him, listening while he talked to us in his bright, entertaining way. This custom we kept up until I was ten years old and over. Although he was so joyous and familiar with us, he was very firm on all proper occasions, never indulged us in anything that was not good for us, and exacted the most implicit obedience. I always knew that it was impossible to disobey my father. I felt it in me, I never thought why, but was perfectly sure when he gave an order that it had to be obeyed. My mother I could sometimes circumvent, and at times took liberties with her orders, construing them to suit myself; but exact obedience to every mandate of my father was part of my life and being at that time. He was very fond of having his hands tickled, and, what was still more curious, it pleased and delighted him to take off his slippers and place his feet in our laps in order to have them tickled. Often, as little things, after romping all day, the enforced sitting would be too much for us, and our drowsiness would soon show itself in continued nods. Then, to arouse, us, he had a way of stirring us up with his foot--laughing heartily at and with us. He would often tell us the most delightful stories, and then there was no nodding. Sometimes, however, our interest in his wonderful tales became so engrossing that we would forget to do our duty--when he would declare, “No tickling, no story!” When we were a little older, our elder sister told us one winter the ever-delightful “Lady of the Lake.” Of course, she told it in prose and arranged it to suit our mental capacity. Our father was generally in his corner by the fire, most probably with a foot in either the lap of myself or youngest sister--the tickling going on briskly--and would come in at different points of the tale and repeat line after line of the poem--much to our disapproval--but to his great enjoyment.  In January, 1849, Captain Lee was one of a board of army officers appointed to examine the coasts of Florida and its defenses and to recommend locations for new fortifications. In April he was assigned to the duty of the construction of Fort Carroll, in the Patapsco River below Baltimore. He was there, I think, for three years, and lived in a house on Madison Street, three doors above Biddle. I used to go down with him to the Fort quite often. We went to the wharf in a “bus,”  and there we were met by a boat with two oarsmen, who rowed us down to Sollers Point, where I was generally left under the care of the people who lived there, while my father went over to the Fort, a short distance out in the river. These days were happy ones for me. The wharves, the shipping, the river, the boat and oarsmen, and the country dinner we"]]]
