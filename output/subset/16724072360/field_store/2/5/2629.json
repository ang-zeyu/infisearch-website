Who can tell what black spirits settled on the necks of those who bore the wood to make the funeral-pile? How very different was it to-day with our woodman Christopher!  And earlier still, in ancient times, men brought wood to the temple, whereon they offered victims in the honor of God; and, according to their notions, they did a good deed: for when words can no longer suffice to express the fervency of the heart, it gladly offers what it prizes, what it dearly loves, as a proof of its devotion, of the earnestness of its intent.  How differently went Christopher from the Duben Forest upon his way! He knew not whether he were intending to bring a purer offering than men had brought in bygone ages; but his heart grew warm within him.  It was day as he arrived before the gates of Leipzig. Here there met him a funeral-procession; behind the bier the scholars of St. Thomas, in long black cloaks, were chanting. Christopher stopped and raised his hat. Whom were they burying? Supposing it were Gellert. Yes, surely, he thought, it is he: and how gladly, said he to himself, would you now have done him a kindness,--ay, even given him your wood! Yes, indeed you would, and now he is dead, and you cannot give him any help!  As soon as the train had passed, Christopher asked who was being buried. It was a simple burgher, it was not Gellert; and in the deep breath which Christopher drew lay a double signification: on the one hand, was joy that Gellert was not dead; on the other, a still small voice whispered to him that he had now really promised to give him the wood: ah! but whom had he promised?--himself: and it is easy to argue with one's own conscience.  Superstition babbles of conjuring-spells, by which, without the co-operation of the patient, the evil spirit can be summarily ejected. It would be convenient if one had that power, but, in truth, it is not so: it is long ere the evil desire and the evil habit are removed from the soul into which they have nestled; and the will, for a long while in bondage, must co-operate, if a releasing spell from without is to set the prisoner free.  One can only be guided, but himself must move his feet.  As Christopher now looked about him, he found that he had stopped close by an inn; he drove his load a little aside, went into the parlor, and drank a glass of warmed beer. There was already a goodly company, and not far from Christopher sat a husbandman with his son, a student here, who was telling him how there had been lately quite a stir. Professor Gellert had been ill, and riding a well-trained horse had been recommended for his health. Now Prince Henry of Prussia, during the Seven Years' War, at the occupation of Leipzig, had sent him a piebald, that had died a short time ago; and the Elector, hearing of it, had sent Gellert from Dresden another--a chestnut--with golden bridle, blue velvet saddle, and gold-embroidered housings. Half the city had assembled when the groom, a man with iron-gray hair, brought the horse; and for several days it was to be seen at the stable; but Gellert dared not mount it, it was so young and high-spirited. The rustic now asked his son whether the Professor did not make money enough to procure a horse of his own, to which the son answered: “Certainly not. His salary is but one hundred and twenty-five dollars, and his further gains are inconsiderable. His Lectures on Morals he gives publicly, i. e., gratis, and he has hundreds of hearers; and, therefore, at his own lectures, which must be paid for, he has so many the fewer. To be sure, he has now and then presents from grand patrons; but no one gives him, once and for all, enough to live upon, and to have all over with a single acknowledgment.”  Our friend Christopher started as he heard this; he had quite made up his mind to take Gellert the wood: but he had yet to do it. How easy were virtue, if will and deed were the same thing! if performance could immediately succeed to the moment of burning enthusiasm! But one must make way over obstacles; over those that outwardly lie in one's path, and over those that are hidden deep in the heart; and negligence has a thousand very cunning advocates.  How many go forth, prompted by good intentions, but let little hindrances turn them from their way--entirely from their way of life! In front of the house Christopher met other woodmen whom he knew, and-- “You are stirring betimes!” “Prices are good to-day!” “But little comes to the market now!” was the cry from all sides. Christopher wanted to say that all that did n't concern him, but he was ashamed to confess what his design was, and an inward voice told him he must not lie. Without answering he joined the rest, and wended his way to the market; and on the road he thought: “There are Peter, and Godfrey, and John, who have seven times your means, and not one of them, I'm sure, would think of doing anything of this kind; why will you be the kind-hearted fool? Stay! what matters it what others do or leave undone? Every man shall answer for himself. Yes, but go to market--it is better it should be so; yes, certainly, much better: sell your wood--who knows? perhaps he does n't want it--and take him the proceeds, or at least the greater portion. But is the wood still yours? You have, properly speaking, already given it away; it has only not been taken from your keeping....”  There are people who cannot give; they can only let a thing be taken either by the hand of chance, or by urgency and entreaty. Christopher had such fast hold of possession, that it was only after sore wrestling that he let go; and yet his heart was kind, at least to-day it was so disposed, but the tempter whispered: “It is not easy to find so good-natured a fellow as you. How readily would you have given, had the man been in want, and your good intention must go for the deed.” Still, on the other hand, there was something in him which made opposition,--an echo from those hours, when, in the still night, he was driving hither,--and it burned in him like sacred fire, and it said, “You must now accomplish what you intended. Certainly no one knows of it, and you are responsible to no one; but you know of it yourself, and One above you knows, and how shall you be justified?” And he said to himself, “I 'll stand by this: look, it is just nine; if no one ask the price of your wood until ten o'clock, until the stroke of ten,--until it has done striking, I mean; if no one ask, then the wood belongs to Professor Gellert: but if a buyer come, then it is a sign that you need not--should not give it away. There, that's all settled. But how? what means this? Can you make your good deed dependent on such a chance as this? No, no; I don't mean it. But yet--yet--only for a joke, I 'll try it.”  Temptation kept him turning as it were in a circle, and still he stood with an apparently quiet heart by his wagon in the market. The people who heard him muttering in this way to himself looked at him with wonder, and passed by him to another wagon, as though he had not been there. It struck nine. Can you wait patiently another hour? Christopher lighted his pipe, and looked calmly on, while this and that load was driven off. It struck the quarter, half-hour, three-quarters. Christopher now put his pipe in his pocket; it had long been cold, and his hands were almost frozen; all his blood had rushed to his heart. Now it struck the full hour, stroke after stroke. At first he counted; then he fancied he had lost a stroke and miscalculated. Either voluntarily or involuntarily, he said to himself, when it had finished striking, “You 're wrong; it is nine, not ten.” He turned round that he might not see the dial, and thus he stood for some time, with his hands upon the wagon-rack, gazing at the wood. He knew not how long he had been thus standing, when some one tapped him on the shoulder, and said, “How much for the load of wood?”  Christopher turned round: there was an odd look of irresolution in his eyes as he said: “Eh? eh? what time is it?”  “Half-past ten.”  “Then the wood is now no longer mine--at least to sell:” and, collecting himself, he became suddenly warm, and with firm hand turned his horses round, and begged the woodmen who accompanied him to point him out the way to the house with the “Schwarz Brett,” Dr. Junius's. There he delivered a full load: at each log he took out of the wagon he smiled oddly. The wood-measurer measured the wood carefully, turning each log and placing it exactly, that there might not be a crevice anywhere.  “Why are you so over-particular to-day, pray?” asked Christopher, and he received for answer:  “Professor Gellert must have a fair load; every shaving kept back from him were a sin.”  Christopher laughed aloud, and the wood-measurer looked at him with amazement; for such particularity generally provoked a quarrel.  Christopher had still some logs over; these he kept by him on the wagon. At this moment the servant Sauer came up, and asked to whom the wood belonged.  “To Professor Gellert,” answered Christopher.  “The man's mad! it isn't true. Professor Gellert has not bought any wood; it is my business to look after that.”  “He has not bought it, and yet it is his!” cried Christopher.  Sauer was on the point of giving the mad peasant a hearty scolding, raising his voice so much the louder, as it was striking eleven by St. Nicholas. At this moment, however, he became suddenly mute; for yonder from the University there came, with tired gait, a man of a noble countenance: at every step he made, on this side and on that, off came the hats and the caps of the passers-by, and Sauer simply called out, “There comes the Professor himself.”  What a peculiar expression passed over Christopher's face! He looked at the new-comer, and so earnest was his gaze, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22669"],["title","The Young Miner; Or, Tom Nelson in California (#1)"],["body","for her purse-proud, mercenary sire. It will be a happy day when, with my pockets full of gold, I enter his presence and claim his daughter's hand.\"  \"I wish you success, Mr. Peabody,\" said Tom. \"I hope you have no rivals.\"  \"Yes, there is one.\"  \"Are you not afraid of him?\"  \"Oh, no; he is a fellow of no style,\" said Peabody, drawing up his slender form, and looking as stylish as a very dirty shirt, muddy boots, and a soiled suit would allow.  \"I think I shall wait awhile before getting married,\" said Tom. \"I am afraid I wouldn't stand any chance with an heiress, Mr. Peabody. Do you think I can ever be stylish?\"  The Bostonian understood Tom to be in earnest, and told him he thought in time, under proper training, he might become fairly stylish.  The conversation was interrupted by the ringing of a bell from the log-house. Mrs. Fletcher, by an arrangement with the party, prepared their meals, and thus they fared better than most of the early pioneers. Their labor gave them a good appetite, and they were more solicitous about quantity than quality. Slow as he was at his work, there was no one who exhibited greater alacrity at meal-times, than Lawrence Peabody. At such times he was even cheerful.     CHAPTER II.  MISSOURI JACK.   At the end of a month the settlement had considerably increased. A large party from Missouri went to work farther up stream, and a few stray emigrants also added themselves to the miners at River Bend, for this was the name selected by Captain Fletcher for the location. The new arrivals were a rougher and more disorderly class than Fletcher and his companions. Already there was a saloon, devoted to the double purpose of gambling and drinking; and the proprietor, Missouri Jack (no one knew his last name), was doing a thriving business. Indeed his income considerably exceeded that of any one in the settlement.  Neither Tom nor any of his party contributed much to Missouri Jack's profits. In consequence, they had to bear the ill-will and sometimes open abuse of Jack and his friends.  \"Come in and take a drink, stranger,\" called out Jack, the day after the opening of the saloon, to Captain Fletcher.  \"No, thank you.\"  \"It shan't cost you a cent.\"  \"It would cost me my health,\" returned Fletcher.  \"Do you mean to say I sell bad whiskey?\" demanded Jack, angrily, emphasizing the inquiry by an oath.  \"I don't know anything about it.\"  \"Then what _do_ you mean?\"  \"I mean that all whiskey is bad for the health,\" replied Fletcher.  \"Oh, you're a temperance sneak!\" exclaimed Missouri Jack, contemptuously.  \"I am a temperance man; you may leave out the other word,\" calmly answered Fletcher.  \"You're not a man!\" exploded Jack. \"A man that's afraid of whiskey is a--a--isn't half a man. He isn't fit to be a woman.\"  \"Have it as you like,\" said Fletcher, unruffled. \"I shall not drink to please any man. I had a younger brother--a bright, promising young man poor Ben was--who drank himself to death. He'd have been alive now but for whiskey.\"  \"Oh, dry up your pious talk! You make me sick!\" exclaimed Missouri Jack in deep disgust.  Next he accosted John Miles, who curtly declined and received in return a volley of abuse. Now Miles was a powerful man, and not possessed of Fletcher's self-control. He paused, and surveyed Jack with a menacing look.  \"Look here, stranger,\" he said, sharply, \"just have a care how you use that tongue of yours. This is a free country, and if I choose to decline your whiskey, there's no law against it that I know of.\"  \"You're a white-livered sneak!\"  Missouri Jack did not proceed with his remarks, for John Miles, seizing him by the shoulder, tripped him up, and strode away, leaving him prostrate, and pouring out a volley of curses. Being a bully, and cowardly as most bullies are, he did not pursue his broad-shouldered enemy, but vowed vengeance whenever a good opportunity came.  In fact, the only one of the original miners who accepted Jack's invitation was Lawrence Peabody.  \"Step in, stranger, and have a drink!\" said Jack, a little dubiously, having met with such poor luck heretofore.  The young Bostonian paused. He was not a drinker at home, but in his discontent and disappointment he was tempted.  \"My dear sir, you are very polite,\" he said.  \"I hope you ain't one of them temperance sneaks,\" said Jack, his brow clouding in anticipation of a refusal.  \"I assure you I am not,\" Peabody hastened to say. \"I have participated in convivial scenes more than once in Boston.\"  \"I don't understand college talk,\" said Jack; \"but if you want a glass of prime whiskey, just say the word.\"  \"I don't care if I do,\" said Peabody, following his new friend into the saloon.  The draught of prime whiskey scorched his throat as he swallowed it down, but it was followed by a sense of exhilaration, and Peabody's tongue was loosened.  \"You're a gentleman!\" said Missouri Jack. \"You ain't like them fellows you're with. They're sneaks.\"  \"Really, you compliment me, Mr.--, what may I call your name?\"  \"Missouri Jack--that's the peg I hang on to.\"  \"My dear Mr. Jack, I am glad to know you. You are really quite an accession to our settlement.\"  \"Well, if I ain't, my saloon is. How you've managed to live so long without liquor beats me. Why, it ain't civilized.\"  \"It _was_ pretty dull,\" admitted Peabody.  \"No life, no amusement; for all the world like a parcel of Methodists. What luck have you met with, stranger?\"  \"Beastly luck!\" answered Peabody. \"I tell you, Mr. Jack, California's a fraud. Many a time I've regretted leaving Boston, where I lived in style, and moved in the first circles, for such a place as this. Positively, Mr. Jack, I feel like a tramp, and I'm afraid I look like one. If my fashionable friends could see me now, they wouldn't know me.\"  \"I ain't got no fashionable friends, and I don't want any,\" growled Missouri Jack, spitting on the floor. \"What I want is, to meet gentlemen that ain't afraid to drink like gentlemen. I say, stranger, you'd better leave them Methodist fellers, and join our gang.\"  \"Thank you, Mr. Jack, you're very kind, and I'll think of it,\" said Peabody, diplomatically. Though a little exhilarated, he was not quite blind to the character of the man with whom he was fraternizing, and had too much real refinement to enjoy his coarseness.  \"Have another drink!\"  \"Thank you.\"  Peabody drank again, this time with a friend of Jack's, a man of his own stripe, who straggled into the saloon.  \"Do you play euchre?\" asked Jack, producing a dirty pack of cards.  \"I know little of it,\" said Peabody; \"but I'll try a game.\"  \"Then you and me and Bill here will have a game.\"  \"All right,\" said Peabody, glad to while away the time.  \"What'll you put up on your game, stranger?\" asked Bill.  \"You don't mean to play for money, do you?\" asked Peabody, a little startled.  \"Sartain I do. What's the good of playin' for nothing?\"  So the young Bostonian, out of his modest pile was tempted to stake an ounce of gold-dust. Though his head was hardly in a condition to follow the game intelligently, he won, or at least Bill and Jack told him he had, and for the first time Lawrence felt the rapture of the successful gambler, as he gathered in his winnings.  \"He plays a steep game, Bill,\" said Jack.  \"Tip-top--A No. 1.\"  \"I believe I do play a pretty good game,\" said the flattered Peabody. \"My friends in Boston used to say so.\"  \"You're hard to beat, and no mistake,\" said Bill. \"Try another game.\"  \"I'm ready, gentlemen,\" said Peabody, with alacrity.  \"It's a great deal easier earning money this way,\" he reflected, regarding complacently the two ounces of dust which represented his winnings, \"than washing dirt out of the river.\" And the poor dupe congratulated himself that a new way of securing the favors of fortune had been opened to him.  The reader will easily guess that Lawrence Peabody did not win the next game, nor will he be surprised to hear that when he left the saloon his pockets were empty.  \"Better luck next time, stranger,\" said Jack, carelessly. \"Take a drink before you go?\"  Peabody accepted the invitation, and soon after staggered into the tent occupied by Tom and his friend Ferguson.  \"What's the matter, Mr. Peabody?\" asked Tom. \"Are you sick?\"  \"Yes,\" answered Peabody, sinking to the floor. \"Something's the matter with my head. I don't feel well.\"  \"Have you been to the saloon, Mr. Peabody?\" asked Ferguson.  \"Yes,\" answered the Bostonian.  \"And while there you drank some of their vile whiskey, didn't you?\"  \"I'm a free man, Mr. Ferguson. If I choose to drink, what--what business is it--yours?\"  \"None, except as a friend I advise you not to go there again.\"  Further inquiries elicited the facts about the gambling, and Ferguson and Tom seriously remonstrated with Peabody, who, however, insisted that Mr. Jack, as he called him, was a hospitable gentleman.  The dust which Peabody had lost should have been paid to Capt. Fletcher, as his share of the expenses that same evening. Of course this was now impossible. Fletcher warned him that any subsequent failure from the same cause would be followed by an exclusion from his table.     CHAPTER III.  HOW TOM GOT ON.   About this time Tom took account of stock. He had come out to California with the noble and praiseworthy purpose of earning money to help his father pay off the mortgage on his little farm. He was the more anxious to succeed, because two hundred dollars of the amount had been raised to defray his expenses across the continent. The mortgage, amounting now to twenty-two hundred dollars, was held by Squire Hudson, a wealthy resident of the same town, who hoped eventually to find an excuse for fore-closing the mortgage, and ejecting Mr. Nelson's family. He was actuated not alone by mercenary motives, but also to gratify an ancient grudge. In early life Mrs. Nelson, Tom's mother, had rejected the suit of the wealthy squire, and this insult, as he chose to characterize it, he had never forgotten or forgiven.  Had Tom been aware of"]]]
