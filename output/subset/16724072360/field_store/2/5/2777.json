Poor Nancy. Has the family been notified?\"  \"Good gosh, I forgot about it,\" Michaels said. \"But maybe we better wait until you get her--arranged, huh, Doc?\"                     *       *       *       *       *  \"Quite so.\" The old man laid the canvas stretcher out beside the girl on the floor and unrolled it. He flipped the body over expertly like a window demonstrator flipping a pancake over on a griddle.  \"Ed, if you'd just take the front, I'll carry the rear. My vehicle is in the alley.\"  \"Sam, you carry that end for Doc. You're a few years younger.\"  Collins wanted to say that he couldn't, but he didn't have enough yet to argue with. He picked up the stretcher and looked down at the white feet in the Scotch plaid slippers.  Candle opened the door and waited for them to go through.  The girl on the stretcher parted her lips and rolled her head back and forth, a puzzled expression of pain on her face.  Collins nearly dropped the stretcher, but he made himself hold on tight.  \"Ed! Doc! She moved! She's still _alive_.\"  \"Cut that out now, Sam,\" Ed Michaels snapped. \"Just carry your end.\"  \"She's alive,\" Collins insisted. \"She moved again. Just turn around and take a look, Ed. That's all I ask.\"  \"I hefted this thing once, and that's enough. You _move_, Sam. I've got a .38 in my belt, and I went to Rome, Italy, for the Olympics about the time you were getting yourself born, Sam. I ought to be able to hit a target as big as you. Just go ahead and do as you're told.\"  Collins turned desperately towards Candle. Maybe Nancy had been right, maybe he had been imagining things.  \"Doc, you take a look at her,\" Collins begged.  The old man vibrated over to the stretcher and looked down. The girl twisted in pain, throwing her head back, spilling her hair over the head of the stretcher.  \"Rigor mortis,\" Doc Candle diagnosed, with a wink to Collins.  \"No, Doc! She needs a doctor, blood transfusions....\"                     *       *       *       *       *  \"Nonsense,\" Candle snapped. \"I'll take her in my black wagon up to my place, put her in the tiled basement. I'll pump out all her blood and flush it down the commode. Then I'll feed in Formaldi-Forever Number Zero. Formaldi-Forever, for the Blush of Death. 'When you think of a Pretty Girl, think of Formaldi-Forever, the Way to Preserve that Beauty.' Then I'll take a needle and some silk thread and just a few stitches on the eyelids and around the mouth....\"  \"Doc, will you...?\" Michaels said faintly.  \"Of course. I just wanted to show Sam how foolish he was in saying the Beloved was still alive.\"  Nancy kicked one leg off the stretcher and Candle picked it up and tucked it back in.  \"Ed, if you'd just turn around and _look_.\" Collins said.  \"I don't want to have to look at your face, you murdering son. You make me, you say one more word, and I'll turn around and shoot you between the eyes.\"  Doc Candle nodded. Collins knew then that Michaels really would shoot him in the head if he said anything more, so he kept quiet.  Candle held the door. They managed to get the stretcher down the back steps, and right into the black panel truck. They fitted the stretcher into the special sockets for it, and Doc Candle closed the double doors and slapped his dry palm down on the sealing crevice.  Instantly, there was an answering knock from inside the truck, a dull echo.                     *       *       *       *       *  \"Didn't you hear that?\" Collins asked.  \"Hear what?\" Michaels said.  \"What are you hearing now, Sam?\" Candle inquired solicitously.  \"Oh. Sure,\" Michaels said. \"Kind of a _voice_, wasn't it, Sam? Didn't understand what it said. Wasn't listening too close, not like you.\"  _Thud-thud-thump-thud._  \"No voice,\" Collins whispered. \"That infernal sound, don't you hear it, Ed?\"  \"I must hurry along,\" the undertaker said. \"Must get ready to work on Nancy, get her ready for her parents to see.\"  \"All right, Doc. I'll take care of Sam.\"  \"Where you going to jail me, Ed?\" Collins asked, his eyes on the closed truck doors. \"In your storeroom like you did Hank Petrie?\"  Michaels' face suddenly began to work. \"Jail? Jail you? Jail's too good for you. Doc, have you got a tow rope in that truck?\"  Ed Michaels was the best shot in town, probably one of the best marksmen in the world. He had been in the Olympics about thirty years ago. He was Waraxe's one claim to fame. But he wasn't a cowboy. He wasn't a fast draw.  Collins put all of his weight behind his left fist and landed it on the point of Michaels' jaw, just the way he used to do when gangs of boys jumped onto him.  [Illustration]  Michaels sprawled out, spread-eagled.  Then Collins wanted to take the revolver out of Ed's belt, and press it into Ed's hand, curling his fingers around the grip and over the trigger, and then he wanted to shake Ed awake, slap his face and shake him....  Collins spun around, clawed open the door to the truck cab and threw himself behind the steering wheel.  He stopped wanting to make Ed Michaels shoot him.  He flipped the ignition switch, levered the floor shift and drove away.  And he was going to drive on and on and on and on.  And on and on and on.     IV   Collins turned onto the old McHenty blacktop, his foot pressed to the floorboards. Ed Michaels didn't own a car; he would have to borrow one from somebody. That would take time. Maybe Candle would give him his hearse to use to follow the Black Rachel.  Trees, fences, barns whizzed past the windows of the cab and then the steel link-mesh fence took up, the fence surrounding the New Kansas National Spaceport. Behind it, further from town, some of the concrete had been poured and the horizon was a remote, sterile gray sweep.  The McHenty Road would soon be closed to civilian traffic. But right now the government wanted people to drive along and see that the spaceship was nothing terrible, nothing to fear.  The girl, Nancy Comstock, was alive in the back. He knew that. But he couldn't stop to prove it or to help her. Candle would make them lynch him first.  Why hadn't Candle stopped him from getting away?  He had managed to break his control for a second. He had done that before when he deflected Nancy's aim. But he couldn't resist Candle for long. Why hadn't Candle made him turn around and come back?  Candle's control of him had seemed to stop when he got inside the cab of the truck. Could it be that the metal shield of the cab could protect an Earthling from the strange mental powers of the creature from another planet which was inhabiting the body of Doc Candle?  Collins shook his head.  More likely Candle was doing this just to get his hopes up. He probably would seize control of him any time he wanted to. But Collins decided to go on playing it as if he did have some hope, as if a shield of metal could protect him from Candle's control. Otherwise ... there was no otherwise.                     *       *       *       *       *  Collins suddenly saw an opening.  The steel mesh fence was ruptured by a huge semitrailer truck turned on its side. Twenty feet of fence on either side was down. This was restricted government property, but of course spaceships were hardly prime military secrets any longer. Repairs in the fence had not been made instantaneously, and the wreckage was not guarded.  Collins swerved the wheel and drove the old wagon across the waffle-plate obstruction, onto the smooth tarmac beyond.  He raced, raced, raced through the falling night, not sure where he was headed.  Up above he saw the shelter of shadows from a cluster of half-finished buildings. He drove into them and parked.  Collins sat still for a moment, then threw open the door and ran around to the back of the truck, jerking open the handles.  Nancy fell out into his arms.  \"What kind of ambulance is this?\" she demanded. \"It doesn't look like an ambulance. It doesn't smell like an ambulance. It looks like--looks like--\"  Collins said, \"Shut up. Get out of there. We've got to hide.\"  \"Why?\"  \"They think I murdered you.\"  \"Murdered me? But I'm alive. Can't they see I'm alive?\"  Collins shook his head. \"I doubt it. I don't know why, but I don't think it would be that simple. Come with me.\"  The blood on her breast had dried, and he could see it was only a shallow groove dug by the bullet. But she flinched in pain as she began to walk, pulling the muscles.  They stopped and leaned against a half-finished metallic shed.  \"Where are we? Where are you taking me?\"  \"This is the spaceport. Now shut up.\"  \"Let me go.\"  \"No.\"  \"I'm not dead,\" Nancy insisted. \"You know I'm not dead. I won't press charges against you--just let me go free.\"  \"I told you it wasn't that simple. He wants them to think you're dead, and that's what they'll think.\"  Nancy passed fingers across her eyes. \"Who? Who are you talking about?\"  \"Doc Candle. He won't let them know you're alive.\"  Nancy rubbed her forehead with both hands. \"Sam, you don't know what you're doing. You don't--know what you're getting yourself into. Just let me show myself to someone. They'll know I'm not dead. Really they will.\"  \"Okay,\" he said. \"Let's find somebody.\"  He led her toward a more nearly completed building, showing rectangles of light. They looked through the windows to see several men in uniforms bending over blueprints on a desk jury-rigged of sawhorses and planks.  \"Sam,\" Nancy said, \"one of those men is Terry Elston. He's a Waraxe boy. I went to school with him. He'll know me. Let's go in....\"  \"No,\" Collins said. \"We don't go in.\"  \"But--\" Nancy started to protest, but stopped. \"Wait. He's coming out.\"  Collins slid along the wall and stood behind the door. \"Tell him who you are when he comes out. I'll stay here.\"  They waited. After a few seconds, the door opened.  Nancy stepped into the rectangle of light thrown on the concrete from the window.  \"Terry,\" she said. \"Terry, it's me--Nancy"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23427"],["title","Evolution, Old & New (#1)"],["body","Points of Agreement and of Difference between the   Old and New Theories of Evolution                                335  CHAPTER XX.

STATEMENT OF THE QUESTION. CURRENT OPINION ADVERSE TO TELEOLOGY.   Of all the questions now engaging the attention of those whose destiny has commanded them to take more or less exercise of mind, I know of none more interesting than that which deals with what is called teleology--that is to say, with design or purpose, as evidenced by the different parts of animals and plants.  The question may be briefly stated thus:--  Can we or can we not see signs in the structure of animals and plants, of something which carries with it the idea of contrivance so strongly that it is impossible for us to think of the structure, without at the same time thinking of contrivance, or design, in connection with it?  It is my object in the present work to answer this question in the affirmative, and to lead my reader to agree with me, perhaps mainly, by following the history of that opinion which is now supposed to be fatal to a purposive view of animal and vegetable organs. I refer to the theory of evolution or descent with modification.  Let me state the question more at large.  When we see organs, or living tools--for there is no well-developed organ of any living being which is not used by its possessor as an instrument or tool for the effecting of some purpose which he considers or has considered for his advantage--when we see living tools which are as admirably fitted for the work required of them, as is the carpenter's plane for planing, or the blacksmith's hammer and anvil for the hammering of iron, or the tailor's needle for sewing, what conclusion shall we adopt concerning them?  Shall we hold that they must have been designed or contrived, not perhaps by mental processes indistinguishable from those by which the carpenter's saw or the watch has been designed, but still by processes so closely resembling these that no word can be found to express the facts of the case so nearly as the word \"design\"? That is to say, shall we imagine that they were arrived at by a living mind as the result of scheming and contriving, and thinking (not without occasional mistakes) which of the courses open to it seemed best fitted for the occasion, or are we to regard the apparent connection between such an organ, we will say, as the eye, and the sight which is affected by it, as in no way due to the design or plan of a living intelligent being, but as caused simply by the accumulation, one upon another, of an almost infinite series of small pieces of good fortune?  In other words, shall we see something for which, as Professor Mivart has well said, \"to us the word 'mind' is the least inadequate and misleading symbol,\" as having given to the eagle an eyesight which can pierce the sun, but which, in the night is powerless; while to the owl it has given eyes which shun even the full moon, but find a soft brilliancy in darkness? Or shall we deny that there has been any purpose or design in the fashioning of these different kinds of eyes, and see nothing to make us believe that any living being made the eagle's eye out of something which was not an eye nor anything like one, or that this living being implanted this particular eye of all others in the eagle's head, as being most in accordance with the habits of the creature, and as therefore most likely to enable it to live contentedly and leave plenitude of offspring? And shall we then go on to maintain that the eagle's eye was formed little by little by a series of accidental variations, each one of which was thrown for, as it were, with dice?  We shall most of us feel that there must have been a little cheating somewhere with these accidental variations before the eagle could have become so great a winner.  I believe I have now stated the question at issue so plainly that there can be no mistake about its nature, I will therefore proceed to show as briefly as possible what have been the positions taken in regard to it by our forefathers, by the leaders of opinion now living, and what I believe will be the next conclusion that will be adopted for any length of time by any considerable number of people.  In the times of the ancients the preponderance of opinion was in favour of teleology, though impugners were not wanting. Aristotle[1] leant towards a denial of purpose, while Plato[2] was a firm believer in design. From the days of Plato to our own times, there have been but few objectors to the teleological or purposive view of nature. If an animal had an eye, that eye was regarded as something which had been designed in order to enable its owner to see after such fashion as should be most to its advantage.  This, however, is now no longer the prevailing opinion either in this country or in Germany.  Professor Haeckel holds a high place among the leaders of German philosophy at the present day. He declares a belief in evolution and in purposiveness to be incompatible, and denies purpose in language which holds out little prospect of a compromise.  \"As soon, in fact,\" he writes, \"as we acknowledge the exclusive activity of the physico-chemical causes in living (organic) bodies as well as in so-called inanimate (inorganic) nature,\"--and this is what Professor Haeckel holds we are bound to do if we accept the theory of descent with modification--\"we concede exclusive dominion to that view of the universe, which we may designate as _mechanical_, and which is opposed to the teleological conception. If we compare all the ideas of the universe prevalent among different nations at different times, we can divide them all into two sharply contrasted groups--a _causal_ or _mechanical_, and a _teleological_ or _vitalistic_. The latter has prevailed generally in biology until now, and accordingly the animal and vegetable kingdoms have been considered as the products of a creative power, acting for a definite purpose. In the contemplation of every organism, the unavoidable conviction seemed to press itself upon us, that such a wonderful machine, so complicated an apparatus for motion as exists in the organism, could only be produced by a power analogous to, but infinitely more powerful than the power of man in the construction of his machines.\"[3]  A little lower down he continues:--  \"_I maintain with regard to_\" this \"_much talked of 'purpose in nature' that it has no existence but for those persons who observe phenomena in plants and animals in the most superficial manner_. Without going more deeply into the matter, we can see at once that the rudimentary organs are a formidable obstacle to this theory. And, indeed, anyone who makes a really close study of the organization and mode of life of the various animals and plants, ... must necessarily come to the conclusion, that this 'purposiveness' no more exists than the much talked of 'beneficence' of the Creator.\"[4]  Professor Haeckel justly sees no alternative between, upon the one hand, the creation of independent species by a Personal God--by a \"Creator,\" in fact, who \"becomes an organism, who designs a plan, reflects upon and varies this plan, and finally forms creatures according to it, as a human architect would construct his building,\"[5]--and the denial of all plan or purpose whatever. There can be no question but that he is right here. To talk of a \"designer\" who has no tangible existence, no organism with which to think, no bodily mechanism with which to carry his purposes into effect; whose design is not design inasmuch as it has to contend with no impediments from ignorance or impotence, and who thus contrives but by a sort of make-believe in which there is no contrivance; who has a familiar name, but nothing beyond a name which any human sense has ever been able to perceive--this is an abuse of words--an attempt to palm off a shadow upon our understandings as though it were a substance. It is plain therefore that there must either be a designer who \"becomes an organism, designs a plan, &c.,\" or that there can be no designer at all and hence no design.  We have seen which of these alternatives Professor Haeckel has adopted. He holds that those who accept evolution are bound to reject all \"purposiveness.\" And here, as I have intimated, I differ from him, for reasons which will appear presently. I believe in an organic and tangible designer of every complex structure, for so long a time past, as that reasonable people will be incurious about all that occurred at any earlier time.  Professor Clifford, again, is a fair representative of opinions which are finding favour with the majority of our own thinkers. He writes:--  \"There are here some words, however, which require careful definition. And first the word purpose. A thing serves a purpose when it is adapted for some end; thus a corkscrew is adapted to the end of extracting corks from bottles, and our lungs are adapted to the end of respiration. We may say that the extraction of corks is the purpose of the corkscrew, and that respiration is the purpose of the lungs, but here we shall have used the word in two different senses. A man made the corkscrew with a purpose in his mind, and he knew and intended that it should be used for pulling out corks. _But nobody made our lungs with a purpose in his mind and intended"]]]
