Even now she waits her turn for a machine. The tide is low, though rising. I, in one of our town-boats, shall not be suspected. When she comes forth in her bathing-dress into the shallow water from behind the hood of the machine, my boat shall intercept her and prevent her return. Do you the rest.\"  \"Mayor,\" returned Capt. Boldheart, \"thou hast saved thy town.\"  The captain then signalled his boat to take him off, and steering her himself ordered her crew to row towards the bathing-ground, and there to rest upon their oars. All happened as had been arranged. His lovely bride came forth, the Mayor glided in behind her, she became confused and had floated out of her depth, when, with one skilful touch of the rudder and one quivering stroke from the boat's crew, her adoring Boldheart held her in his strong arms. There her shrieks of terror were changed to cries of joy.  Before the Beauty could get under weigh, the hoisting of all the flags in the town and harbour, and the ringing of all the bells, announced to the brave Boldheart that he had nothing to fear. He therefore determined to be married on the spot, and signalled for a clergyman and clerk, who came off promptly in a sailing-boat named the Skylark. Another great entertainment was then given on board the Beauty, in the midst of which the Mayor was called out by a messenger. He returned with the news that Government had sent down to know whether Captain Boldheart, in acknowledgment of the great services he had done his country by being a Pirate, would consent to be made a Lieutenant-Colonel. For himself he would have spurned the worthless boon, but his Bride wished it and he consented.  Only one thing further happened before the good ship Family was dismissed, with rich presents to all on board. It is painful to record (but such is human nature in some cousins) that Captain Boldheart's unmannerly cousin Tom was actually tied up to receive three dozen with a rope's end \"for cheekyness and making games,\" when Captain Boldheart's lady begged for him and he was spared. The Beauty then refitted, and the Captain and his Bride departed for the Indian Ocean to enjoy themselves for evermore.

That's the outskirts of it down below.\"  \"The other trees? That jungle?\"  \"It's more'n a jungle, Sonny. When I landed here, along with the others from the _Arcturan Spark_, the planet looked pretty empty to me, just like it must have to--Watch it, there, Boy! If I didn't twist that branch over in time, you'd be bouncing off my roots right now!\"  \"Th-thanks!\" grunted Kolin, hanging on grimly.  \"Doggone vine!\" commented the windy whisper. \"_He_ ain't one of my crowd. Landed years later in a ship from some star towards the center of the galaxy. You should have seen his looks before the Life got in touch with his mind and set up a mental field to help him change form. He looks twice as good as a vine!\"  \"He's very handy,\" agreed Kolin politely. He groped for a foothold.  \"Well ... matter of fact, I can't get through to him much, even with the Life's mental field helping. Guess he started living with a different way of thinking. It burns me. I thought of being a tree, and then he came along to take advantage of it!\"  Kolin braced himself securely to stretch tiring muscles.  \"Maybe I'd better stay a while,\" he muttered. \"I don't know where I am.\"  \"You're about fifty feet up,\" the sighing voice informed him. \"You ought to let me tell you how the Life helps you change form. You don't _have_ to be a tree.\"  \"No?\"  \"_Uh_-uh! Some of the boys that landed with me wanted to get around and see things. Lots changed to animals or birds. One even stayed a man--on the outside anyway. Most of them have to change as the bodies wear out, which I don't, and some made bad mistakes tryin' to be things they saw on other planets.\"  \"I wouldn't want to do that, Mr. Ashlew.\"  \"There's just one thing. The Life don't like taking chances on word about this place gettin' around. It sorta believes in peace and quiet. You might not get back to your ship in any form that could tell tales.\"  \"Listen!\" Kolin blurted out. \"I wasn't so much enjoying being what I was that getting back matters to me!\"  \"Don't like your home planet, whatever the name was?\"  \"Haurtoz. It's a rotten place. A Planetary State! You have to think and even look the way that's standard thirty hours a day, asleep or awake. You get scared to sleep for fear you might _dream_ treason and they'd find out somehow.\"  \"Whooeee! Heard about them places. Must be tough just to live.\"  Suddenly, Kolin found himself telling the tree about life on Haurtoz, and of the officially announced threats to the Planetary State's planned expansion. He dwelt upon the desperation of having no place to hide in case of trouble with the authorities. A multiple system of such worlds was agonizing to imagine.                     *       *       *       *       *  Somehow, the oddity of talking to a tree wore off. Kolin heard opinions spouting out which he had prudently kept bottled up for years.  The more he talked and stormed and complained, the more relaxed he felt.  \"If there was ever a fellow ready for this planet,\" decided the tree named Ashlew, \"you're it, Sonny! Hang on there while I signal the Life by root!\"  Kolin sensed a lack of direct attention. The rustle about him was natural, caused by an ordinary breeze. He noticed his hands shaking.  \"Don't know what got into me, talking that way to a tree,\" he muttered. \"If Yrtok snapped out of it and heard, I'm as good as re-personalized right now.\"  As he brooded upon the sorry choice of arousing a search by hiding where he was or going back to bluff things out, the tree spoke.  \"Maybe you're all set, Sonny. The Life has been thinkin' of learning about other worlds. If you can think of a safe form to jet off in, you might make yourself a deal. How'd you like to stay here?\"  \"I don't know,\" said Kolin. \"The penalty for desertion--\"  \"Whoosh! Who'd find you? You could be a bird, a tree, even a cloud.\"  Silenced but doubting, Kolin permitted himself to try the dream on for size.  He considered what form might most easily escape the notice of search parties and still be tough enough to live a long time without renewal. Another factor slipped into his musings: mere hope of escape was unsatisfying after the outburst that had defined his fuming hatred for Haurtoz.  _I'd better watch myself!_ he thought. _Don't drop diamonds to grab at stars!_  \"What I wish I could do is not just get away but get even for the way they make us live ... the whole damn set-up. They could just as easy make peace with the Earth colonies. You know why they don't?\"  \"Why?\" wheezed Ashlew.  \"They're scared that without talk of war, and scouting for Earth fleets that never come, people would have time to think about the way they have to live and who's running things in the Planetary State. Then the gravy train would get blown up--and I mean blown up!\"  The tree was silent for a moment. Kolin felt the branches stir meditatively. Then Ashlew offered a suggestion.  \"I could tell the Life your side of it,\" he hissed. \"Once in with us, you can always make thinking connections, no matter how far away. Maybe you could make a deal to kill two birds with one stone, as they used to say on Earth....\"                     *       *       *       *       *  Chief Steward Slichow paced up and down beside the ration crate turned up to serve him as a field desk. He scowled in turn, impartially, at his watch and at the weary stewards of his headquarters detail. The latter stumbled about, stacking and distributing small packets of emergency rations.  The line of crewmen released temporarily from repair work was transient as to individuals but immutable as to length. Slichow muttered something profane about disregard of orders as he glared at the rocky ridges surrounding the landing place.  He was so intent upon planning greetings with which to favor the tardy scouting parties that he failed to notice the loose cloud drifting over the ridge.  It was tenuous, almost a haze. Close examination would have revealed it to be made up of myriads of tiny spores. They resembled those cast forth by one of the bushes Kolin's party had passed. Along the edges, the haze faded raggedly into thin air, but the units evidently formed a cohesive body. They drifted together, approaching the men as if taking intelligent advantage of the breeze.  One of Chief Slichow's staggering flunkies, stealing a few seconds of relaxation on the pretext of dumping an armful of light plastic packing, wandered into the haze.  He froze.  After a few heartbeats, he dropped the trash and stared at ship and men as if he had never seen either. A hail from his master moved him.  \"Coming, Chief!\" he called but, returning at a moderate pace, he murmured, \"My name is Frazer. I'm a second assistant steward. I'll think as Unit One.\"  Throughout the cloud of spores, the mind formerly known as Peter Kolin congratulated itself upon its choice of form.  _Nearer to the original shape of the Life than Ashlew got_, he thought.  He paused to consider the state of the tree named Ashlew, half immortal but rooted to one spot, unable to float on a breeze or through space itself on the pressure of light. Especially, it was unable to insinuate any part of itself into the control center of another form of life, as a second spore was taking charge of the body of Chief Slichow at that very instant.  _There are not enough men_, thought Kolin. _Some of me must drift through the airlock. In space, I can spread through the air system to the command group._  Repairs to the _Peace State_ and the return to Haurtoz passed like weeks to some of the crew but like brief moments in infinity to other units. At last, the ship parted the air above Headquarters City and landed.  The unit known as Captain Theodor Kessel hesitated before descending the ramp. He surveyed the field, the city and the waiting team of inspecting officers.  \"Could hardly be better, could it?\" he chuckled to the companion unit called Security Officer Tarth.  \"Hardly, sir. All ready for the liberation of Haurtoz.\"  \"Reformation of the Planetary State,\" mused the captain, smiling dreamily as he grasped the handrail. \"And then--formation of the Planetary Mind!\"   END     [ Transcriber's Note:     This e-text was produced from Worlds of If January 1962.
