Blude frightened him with false stories, and persuaded him to remove from place to place, until his mind and body were worn out, when, at Blude's suggestion, he determined to surrender himself, and trust to the mercy of Vladimir. That good-natured brother ordered the betrayed and distressed prince to be put to death.  Then Vladimir rewarded Blude. He entertained him in princely fashion, declaring to his followers that he was deeply indebted to this man for his faithful services, and heaping all manner of honors upon him. But at the end of three days he said to Blude: \"I have kept my promise strictly. I have received you with welcome, and heaped unwonted honors upon your head. This I have done as your friend. To-day, as judge, I condemn the traitor and the murderer of his prince.\" He ordered that Blude should suffer instant death, and the sentence was executed.  Now that both Oleg and Yaropolk were dead, Vladimir was Grand Prince of all the Russias, as his father before him had been. He invaded Poland, and made war upon various others of his neighbors, greatly enlarging his dominions and strengthening his rule.  But Vladimir was a very pious prince in his heathen way, and feeling that the gods had greatly favored him, he made rich feasts of thanksgiving in their honor. He ordered splendid memorials to various deities to be erected throughout the country, and he specially honored Perune, the father of the gods, for whom he provided a new pair of golden whiskers--golden whiskers being the special glory of Perune.  Not content with this, Vladimir ordered a human sacrifice to be made, and selected for the victim a Christian youth of the capital. The father of the boy resisted, and both were slain, locked in each other's arms.  Vladimir gave vast sums of money to the religious establishments, and behaved generally like a very devout pagan. His piety and generosity made him so desirable a patron that efforts were made by the priests of other religions to convert him. Jews, Mohammedans, Catholics, and Greeks all sought to win him, and Vladimir began seriously to consider the question of changing his religion. He appointed a commission, consisting of ten boyards, and ordered them to examine into the comparative merits of the different religions, and to report to him. When their report was made, Vladimir weighed the matter carefully.  He began by rejecting Mohammedanism, because it forbids the use of wine, and Vladimir was not at all disposed to become a water-drinker. Judaism, he said, was a homeless religion, its followers being wanderers on the face of the earth, under a curse; so he would have nothing to do with that faith. The Catholic religion would not do at all, because it recognized in the pope a superior to himself, and Vladimir had no mind to acknowledge a superior. The Greek religion was free from these objections, and moreover, by adopting it he would bring himself into friendship with the great Greek or Byzantine Empire, whose capital was at Constantinople, and that was something which he earnestly desired to accomplish.  Accordingly, he determined to become a Christian and a member of the Greek Church; but how? There were serious difficulties in the way. In order to become a Christian he must be baptized, and he was puzzled about how to accomplish that. There were many Greek priests in his capital, any one of whom would have been glad to baptize the heathen monarch, but Vladimir would not let a mere priest convert him into a Christian. Nobody less than an archbishop would do for that, and there was no archbishop in Russia.  It is true that there were plenty of archbishops in the dominions of his Byzantine neighbors, and that the Greek emperors, Basil and Constantine, would have been glad to send him a dozen of them if he had expressed a wish to that effect; but Vladimir was proud, and could not think of asking a favor of anybody, least of all of the Greek emperors. No, he would die a heathen rather than ask for an archbishop to baptize him.  Nevertheless, Vladimir had fully made up his mind to have himself baptized by an archbishop. It was his lifelong habit, when he wanted anything, to take it by force. He had taken two thirds of his dominions in that way, and, as we have seen, it was in that way that he got his wife Rogneda. So now that he wanted an archbishop, he determined to take one. Calling his army together, he declared war on the Greek emperors, and promising his soldiers all the pillage they wanted, he marched away towards Constantinople.  The first serious obstacle he met with was the fortified city of Kherson, situated near the spot where Sebastopol stands in our day. Here the resistance was so obstinate that month after month was consumed in siege operations. At the end of six months Vladimir became seriously alarmed lest the garrison should be succored from without, in which case his hope of getting himself converted into a Christian must be abandoned altogether.  While he was troubled on this score, however, one of his soldiers picked up an arrow that had been shot from the city, and found a letter attached to it. This letter informed the Grand Prince that the water-pipes of the city received their supplies at a point immediately in his rear, and with this news Vladimir's hope of becoming a Christian revived. He found the water-pipes and stopped them up, and the city surrendered.  There were plenty of bishops and archbishops there, of course, and they were perfectly willing--as they had been from the first, for that matter--to baptize the unruly royal convert, but Vladimir was not content now with that. He sent a messenger to Constantinople to tell the emperors there that he wanted their sister, the Princess Anne, for a wife; and that if they refused, he would march against Constantinople itself. The Emperors Basil and Constantine consented, and although Vladimir had five wives already, he married Anne, and was baptized on the same day.  Having now become a Christian, the Grand Prince determined that his Russians should do the same. He publicly stripped the god Perune of his gorgeous golden whiskers, and of his rich vestments, showing the people that Perune was only a log of wood. Then he had the deposed god whipped in public, and thrown into the river, with all the other gods.  He next ordered all the people of his capital city to assemble on the banks of the Dnieper River, and, at a signal, made them all rush into the water, while a priest pronounced the baptismal service over the whole population of the city at once. It was the most wholesale baptism ever performed.  [Illustration: VLADIMIR BESIEGING THE CITY CONTAINING HIS ARCHBISHOP.]  That is the way in which Russia was changed from a pagan to a Christian empire. The story reads like a romance, but it is plain, well-authenticated history. For his military exploits the Russian historians call this prince Vladimir the Great. The people call him St. Vladimir, the Greek Church having enrolled his name among the saints soon after his death. He was undoubtedly a man of rare military skill, and unusual ability in the government of men. Bad as his acts were, he seems to have had a conscience, and to have done his duty so far as he was capable of understanding it.     THE BOY COMMANDER OF THE CAMISARDS.   When Louis XIV. was King of France, that country was generally Catholic, as it is still, but in the rugged mountain region called the Cevennes more than half the people were Protestants. At first the king consented that these Protestant people, who were well behaved both in peace and in war, should live in quiet, and worship as they pleased; but in those days men were not tolerant in matters of religion, as they are now, and so after a while King Louis made up his mind that he would compel all his people to believe alike. The Protestants of the Cevennes were required to give up their religion and to become Catholics. When they refused, soldiers were sent to compel them, and great cruelties were practised upon them. Many of them were killed, many put in prison, and many sent to work in the galleys.  When this persecution had lasted for nearly thirty years, a body of young men who were gathered together in the High Cevennes resolved to defend themselves by force. They secured arms, and although their numbers were very small, they met and fought the troops.  Among these young men was one, a mere boy, named Jean Cavalier. His home was in the Lower Cevennes, but he had fled to the highlands for safety. This boy, without knowing it, had military genius of a very high order, and when it became evident that he and his comrades could not long hold out against the large bodies of regular troops sent against them, he suggested a plan which in the end proved to be so good that for years the poor peasants were able to maintain war against all the armies that King Louis could send against them, although he sent many of his finest generals and as many as sixty thousand men to subdue them.  Cavalier's plan was to collect more men, divide, and make uprisings in several places at once, so that the king's officers could not tell in which way to turn. As he and his comrades knew the country well, and had friends to tell them of the enemy's movements, they could nearly always know when it was safe to attack, and when they must hide in the woods.  Cavalier took thirty men and went into one part of the country, while Captain La Porte, with a like number, went to another, and Captain St. John to still another. They kept each other informed of all movements, and whenever one was pressed by the enemy, the others would begin burning churches or attacking small garrisons. The enemy would thus be compelled to abandon the pursuit of one party in order to go after the others, and it soon became evident that under Cavalier's lead the peasants were too wily and too strong for the soldiers. Sometimes Cavalier would fairly beat detachments of his foes, and give them"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23889"],["title","Charley de Milo (#1)"],["body","and then got himself an act and come with a Carnival. Charley knew the whole story. He didn't want to hear it again.  But the professor said: \"I'm as good as I ever was--better than I ever was, my boy. I've been keeping up, doing experiments. I've been quiet about it.\"  Everybody, Charley thought, knew about Professor Lightning and his experiments. If they kept the old man happy, kept him contented and doing shows, why not? After all, the old guy didn't drink or anything really serious; if he wanted to play around with test tubes and even Bunsen burners, people figured, why, let him.  But Professor Lightning thought nobody knew. Well, he had been a real professor once, which is to say a square. Some people never really adjusted to carny life--where everybody knows everything.  Charley figured maybe it was better to act surprised. \"Really?\" he said. \"Experiments?\"  Professor Lightning looked pleased, which satisfied Charley. \"I've been on the track of something big,\" he said. He seemed to be talking more to himself than to Charley. \"Something new,\" he said. \"And at last ... at last, my boy, I've found it. I'll be famous, Charley, famous--and so will you!\"  \"That's nice,\" Charley said politely. Then he blinked. \"But what do you mean,\" he added, \"me?\"  \"I want you to help me,\" the professor said. He leaned forward, and in the dim light of the tent's single lamp, his eyes glittered. \"I want you to come with me.\"  \"Come with you?\" Charley said, and swallowed hard. He'd never thought, the way some did, that the old man was crazy. But it did look as if he'd slipped a couple of cogs for sure and for real. \"Where?\" Charley said.  \"Washington,\" the professor said instantly. \"New York. London, Paris. Rome. The world, Charley. The world that's going to do us homage.\"  Charley shifted a little in the bed. \"Look, professor,\" he said, \"I've got a job, right here in the carny. I couldn't leave here. So suppose we just--\"  \"Your job?\" the professor said. \"Your job's gone, my boy. Wait. Let me tell you what I've discovered. Let me tell you what has happened--happened to you, my boy. To you, and to me.\"  Charley sat upright, slowly. \"Well,\" he said, \"all right, professor.\"  Professor Lightning beamed, and his eyes glittered brighter and brighter. \"Limb regeneration,\" he said, and his voice was as soft and quiet as if he'd been talking about the most beautiful woman in the world. \"Limb regeneration.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Charley waited a long minute before he admitted to himself that he didn't have the faintest idea what the professor was talking about. \"What?\" he said at last.  Professor Lightning shook his head slightly. \"Charley,\" he said softly, \"you're an Armless Wonder. That's right, isn't it?\"  \"Sure it is, professor,\" Charley said. \"You know that. I was born that way. Made a pretty good thing out of it, too.\"  \"Well,\" Professor Lightning said, \"you don't have to be one. Can you realize that?\"  Charley nodded slowly. \"Sure I don't,\" he said. \"Only it's pretty good money, you know? And there's no sense in sitting around back home and feeling sorry for myself, is there? I mean, this way I can make money and have a job and--\"  \"No,\" Professor Lightning said emphatically.  Charley blinked. \"No?\" he said.  Professor Lightning shook his head, meaningfully. \"Charley, my boy,\" he said, \"I don't mean that you should go home and mope. But think about this: suppose you had your arms? Suppose you had two arms, just like everybody else.\"  \"Why think about anything like that?\" Charley said. \"I mean, I am what I am. That's the way things are. Right?\"  \"Wrong,\" Professor Lightning said. \"I can give you arms, Charley. I can make you normal. Just like everybody else.\"  \"Well,\" Charley said. After a few seconds he said: \"Gee.\" Then he said: \"You're kidding me, professor.\"  \"I'm perfectly serious,\" Professor Lightning said.  \"But--\"  \"Let me show you,\" Professor Lightning said. He stood up and went to the flap of the tent. \"Come with me,\" he said, and Charley got up, dumbly, and followed him out into the cool darkness outside.  Later, Charley couldn't remember all that Professor Lightning had showed him or told him. There were some strange-looking animals called salamanders; Professor Lightning had cut their tails off and they'd grown new tails. That, he said, happened in nature. But he had gone a step farther. He had isolated the particular factor that made such regrowth possible.  Charley remembered something about a molecular lattice, but it didn't make any sense to him, and was only a puzzle. But the professor told him all about the technique, in a very earnest and scientific voice that was convincing to listen to, and showed him mice that he'd cut the tails off of, and the mice had brand-new tails, and even feet in one or two cases. There were a whole lot of small animals in cages, all together in back of the professor's tent, and Charley looked at all of them. The professor had a flashlight, and everything was very clear and bright.  When the demonstration was over, Charley had no doubts at all. It was obvious to him that the professor could do just what he said he could do: grow limbs on things. Charley scratched his head with his left foot, nervously.  \"That's why I came to you,\" the professor said. \"I need a human being--just to show the scientific world that my technique works on human beings. And I've worked with you for a number of years now, Charley.\"  \"Five,\" Charley said. \"Five since you came with Wrout.\"  \"I like you,\" the professor said. \"I want to make you the first, the very first, person to be helped by my technique.\"  Charley shifted his feet. \"You mean you want to give me arms,\" he said.  \"That's right,\" the professor said.  \"No,\" Charley said.         *       *       *       *       *  Professor Lightning nodded. \"Now, then,\" he said. \"We'll get right to work on ... Charley, my boy, what did you say?\"  Charley licked his lips. \"I said no,\" he said.  Professor Lightning waited a long minute. \"You mean you don't believe me,\" he said at last. \"You think I'm some sort of a crackpot.\"  \"Not at all,\" Charley said politely. \"I guess if you say you can do this ... well, I see all the animals, and everything, and I guess you can do it. That's O.K.\"  \"But you're doubtful,\" Professor Lightning said.  Charley shook his head. \"No,\" he said. \"You can do it, all right. I guess I'm sure of that, professor.\"  [Illustration]  \"Then,\" the professor said, in a tenser voice, \"you think it might be dangerous. You think you might be hurt, or that things might not work out right, or--\"  \"Gee,\" Charley said, \"I never thought of anything like that, professor. I know you wouldn't want to hurt me.\"  \"I certainly wouldn't,\" Professor Lightning said. \"I want to help you. I want to make you normal. Like everybody else.\"  \"Sure,\" Charley said uncomfortably.  \"Then you'll do it,\" Professor Lightning said. \"I knew you would, Charley. It's a great opportunity. And I offered it to you because you--\"  \"Gee, I know,\" Charley said, feeling more uncomfortable than ever. \"And don't think I don't appreciate it. But look at it my way, professor.\" He paused. \"Suppose I had two arms--just like everybody else, the way you tell me. What would happen to me?\"  \"Happen?\" Professor Lightning blinked. \"Why, Charley ... why, you could do anything you liked. Anything. You'd have the same opportunities as anybody else. You could be ... well, my boy, you could be anything.\"  \"Could I?\" Charley said. \"Excuse me for talking about this, professor, but I've had a lot of time to think about it. And it's all sort of new to you. I mean, you weren't born the way I was, and so you just don't understand it.\"  Professor Lightning said: \"But, my boy--\"  \"No.\" Charley said. \"Let me explain this. Because it's important.\" He cleared his throat, sat down on the ground and fumbled for a cigarette. He found one in his shirt pocket, carried it to his lips with his right foot, and lit a match with his left. When he was smoking easily, he went on.  \"Professor, do you know how old I am?\" he said. \"I'm forty-two years old. Maybe I don't look it, but that's how old I am. Now, I've spent all my life learning to do one thing, and I do a pretty good job of it. Anyhow, good enough to get me a spot with Wrout's show, and probably with anybody else I wanted to work for.\"  \"But your arms--?\" the professor said.  \"That's what I mean,\" Charley said. \"I don't have any arms. I never had any. Maybe I miss 'em, a little--but everything I do is based on the fact that I don't have 'em. Now, professor, do you know what I am?\"  Professor Lightning frowned. \"What you are?\" he said.  \"I'm an Armless Wonder,\" Charley said. \"That's a pretty good thing to be. In a carny, they look up to an Armless Wonder--he's a freak, a born freak, and that's as high as you can go, in a carny. I get a good salary--I send enough to my mother and my sister, in Chicago, for them to live on. And I have what I need myself. I've got a job, professor, and standing, and respect.\" He paused. \"Now, suppose I had arms. I'd have to start from scratch, all over again. I'd have to start from the bottom up, just learning the basic elements of any job I signed on for. I'd be a forty-two-year-old man doing the work of an eighteen-year-old. And not making much money. And not having much standing, or respect.\"  Charley took the cigarette out of his mouth with his right foot, held it for a second and put it back.  \"I'd be normal,\" he said. \"I'd be just like everybody else, professor. And what do I want anything like _that_ for?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Professor Lightning tried everything, but it wasn't any good. \"Fame,\" he said, and Charley pointed out, calmly and reasonably, that the kind of fame he'd get from being an experimental subject was just like being a freak, all over again--except that it would wear off, and then, he asked, where would he be?
