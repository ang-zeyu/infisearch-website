So I got Jube thar ter crope through, an’ view ef thar war any hoof marks on t’other side whar the cave opens out in Greenbrier Cove.”  “An’ a body would think fur sure ez the armies o’ hell had been spewed out’n that black hole,” said a lean man whom the glance of the blacksmith had indicated as Jube, and who spoke in the intervals of a racking cough that seemed as if it might dislocate his bones in its violence. “Hoof marks hyar--hoof-marks thar--as if they didn’t rightly know which way ter go in the marshy ground ‘bout Sinking Creek. But at last they ‘peared ter git tergether, an’ off they tracked ter the west----” A paroxysm of coughs intervened, and the attention of the group failed to follow the words that they interspersed.  “They tuk a short cut through the Cove--they warn’t in it a haffen hour,” stipulated the prudent miller. “They came an’ went like a flash. Nobody seen ‘em ‘cept the Brusies, kase they went by thar house--an’ ef they hed hed a guide, old Randal Brusie would hev named it.”  “Ackert ‘lows he’ll hang the guide ef he ketches him,” said the blacksmith, in a tone of awe. “Leastwise that’s the word that’s ‘goin’.”  Poor Ethelinda! The clutch of cold horror about her heart seemed to stop its pulsations for a moment. She saw the still mountains whirl about the horizon as if in some weird bewitchment. Her nerveless hands loosened their clasp upon the sley and it fell to the ground, clattering on the protruding roots of the trees. The sound attracted the miller’s attention. He fixed his eyes warily upon her, a sudden thought looking out from their network of wrinkles.  “You didn’t see no guide whenst they slipped past you-uns’ house, did ye?”  Poor, unwilling casuist! She had an instinct for the truth in its purest sense, the innate impulse toward the verities unspoiled by the taint of sophistication. Perhaps in the restricted conditions of her life she had never before had adequate temptation to a subterfuge. Even now, consciously reddening, her eyes drooping before the combined gaze of her little world, she had an inward protest of the literal exactness of her phrase. “Naw sir--I never seen thar guide.”  “Thar now, what did I tell you!” the miller exclaimed, triumphantly.  The blacksmith seemed convinced. “Mought hev hed a map,” he speculated. “Them fellers in the army _do_ hev maps. I fund that out whenst I war in the service.”  The group listened respectfully. The blacksmith’s practical knowledge of the art of war had given him the prestige of a military authority. Doubtless some of the acquiescent wights entertained a vague wonder how the army contrived to fare onward bereft of his advice. And, indeed, despite his maimed estate, his heart was the stoutest that thrilled to the iteration of the trumpet.  Nearer now it was, and once more echoing down the sunset glen.  “Right wheel, trot--_march_,” he muttered, interpreting the sound of the horses’ hoofs. “It’s a critter company, fur sure!”  There was no splendor of pageant in the raid of the guerilla into the Cove. The pines closing above the cleft in the woods masked the entrance of the “critter company.” Once a gleam of scarlet from the guidon flashed on the sight. And again a detached horseman was visible in a barren interval, reining in his steed on the almost vertical slant, looking the centaur in literal presentation. The dull thud of hoofs made itself felt as a continuous undertone to the clatter of stirrup and sabre, and now and again rose the stirring mandate of the trumpet, with that majestic, sweet sweep of sound which so thrills the senses. They were coming indubitably, the troop of the dreaded guerilla--indeed, they were already here. For while the sun still glinted on carbine and sabre among the scarlet and golden tints of the deciduous growths and the sombre green of the pines on the loftier slopes, the vanguard in column of fours were among the gray shadows at the mountains’ base and speeding into the Cove at a hand-gallop, for the roads were fairly good when once the level was reached. Though so military a presentment, for they were all veterans in the service, despite the youth of many, they were not in uniform. Some wore the brown jeans of the region, girt with sword-belt and canteen, with great spurs and cavalry boots, and broad-brimmed hats, which now and again flaunted cords or feathers. Others had attained the Confederate gray, occasionally accented with a glimmer of gold where a shoulder-strap or a chevron graced the garb. And yet there was a certain homogeneity in their aspect, All rode after the manner of the section, with the “long stirrup” at the extreme length of the limb, and the immovable pose in the saddle, the man being absolutely stationary, while the horse bounded at agile speed. There was the similarity of facial expression, in infinite dissimilarity of feature, which marks a common sentiment, origin, and habitat. Then, too, they shared something recklessly haphazard, gay, defiantly dangerous, that, elusive as it might be to describe, was as definitely perceived as the guidon, riding apart at the left, the long lance of his pennant planted on his stirrup, bearing himself with a certain stately pride of port, distinctly official.  The whole effect was concentrated in the face of the leader, obviously the inspiration of the organization, the vital spark by which it lived; a fierce face, intent, commanding. It was burned to a brick-red, and had an aquiline nose and a keen gray-green eagle-like eye; on either side auburn hair, thick and slightly curling, hung, after the fashion of the time, to his coat collar. And this collar and his shoulders were decorated with gold lace and the insignia of rank; the uniform was of fine Confederate gray, which seemed to contradict the general impression that he was but a free-lance or a bushwhacker and operated on his own responsibility. The impression increased the terror his name excited throughout the countryside with his high-handed and eccentric methods of warfare, and perhaps he would not have resented it if he were cognizant of its general acceptance.  It was a look calculated to inspire awe which he flung upon the cowering figures before the door of the forge as he suddenly perceived them; and detaching himself from the advancing troop, he spurred his horse toward them. He came up like a whirlwind.  That impetuous gallop could scarcely have carried his charger over the building itself, yet there is nothing so overwhelming to the nerves as the approaching rush of a speedy horse, and the group flattened themselves against the wall; but he drew rein before he reached the door, and whirling in the saddle, with one hand on the horse’s back, he demanded:  “Where is he? Bring him out!” as if all the world knew the object of his search and the righteous reason of his enmity. “Bring him out! I’ll have a drumhead court martial--and he’ll swing before sunset!”  “Good evenin’, Cap’n,” the old miller sought what influence might appertain to polite address and the social graces.  “Evenin’ be damned!” cried Ackert, angrily. “If you folks in the coves want the immunity of non-combatants, by Gawd! you gotter preserve the neutrality of non-combatants!”  “Yessir--that’s reason--that’s jestice,” said the old squire, hastily, whose capacities of ratiocination had been cultivated by the exercise of the judicial functions of his modest _piepoudre_ court.  Ackert unwillingly cast his eagle eye down upon the cringing old man, as if he would rather welcome contradiction than assent.  “It’s accordin’ to the articles o’ war and the law of nations,” he averred. “People take advantage of age and disability”--he glanced at the blacksmith, whose left hand mechanically grasped the stump of his right arm--“as if that could protect ‘em in acts o’ treason an’ treachery;” then with a blast of impatience, “Where’s the man?”  To remonstrate with a whirlwind, to explain to a flash of lightning, to soothe and propitiate the fury of a conflagration--the task before the primitive and inexpert Cove-dwellers seemed to partake of this nature.  “Cap’n--ef ye’d listen ter what I gotter say,” began the miller.  “I’ll listen arterward!” exclaimed Ackert, in his clarion voice. He had never heard of Jedburgh justice, but he had all the sentiment of that famous tribunal who hanged the prisoners first and tried them afterward.  “Cap’n,” remonstrated the blacksmith, breaking in with hot haste, hurried by the commander’s gusts of impatience, forgetful that he had no need to be precipitate, since he could not produce the recusant if he would. “Cap’n--Cap’n--bear with us--we-uns don’t know!”  Ackert stared in snorting amaze, a flush of anger dyeing his red cheeks a yet deeper red. Of all the subterfuges that he had expected, he had never divined this. He shifted front face in his saddle, placed his gauntleted right hand on his right side, and held his head erect, looking over the wide, rich expanse of the Cove, the corn in the field, and the fodder in the shock set amid the barbaric splendors of the wooded autumn mountains glowing in the sunset above. He seemed scenting his vengeance with some keen sense as he looked, his thin nostrils dilating as sensitively as the nostrils of his high-couraged charger now throwing up his head to sniff the air, now bending it down as he pawed the ground.  “Well, gentlemen, you have got a mighty pretty piece o’ country here, and good crops, too--which is a credit to you, seeing that the conscription has in and about drafted all the able-bodied mountaineers that wouldn’t volunteer--damn ‘em! But I swear by the right hand of Jehovah, I’ll burn every cabin in the Cove an’ every blade o’ forage in the fields if you don’t produce the man who guided Tol-hurst’s cavalry out’n"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23555"],["title","The Lost Guidon (#1)"],["body","oad, for this was near the mountain sandstone formation, fissured, splintered, with the erosions of water and weather; and into one of the cellular, tunnel-like apertures he ran the guidon, lance and all,--lost forever from human sight.  In those days one might speak indeed of the march of events. Each seemed hard on the heels of its precursor. Change ran riot in the ordering of the world, and its aspect was utterly transformed when Casper Girard, no longer bearing the guidon of Dovinger's Rangers, came out of the war with a captain's shoulder-straps, won by personal fitness often proved, the habit of command, and a great and growing opinion of himself. He was a changeling, so to speak. No longer he felt a native of the mountain cove where he had been born and reared. He had had a glimpse of the world from a different standpoint, and it lured him. A dreary, disaffected life he led for a time.  “'Minds me of a wild tur-r-key in a trap,” his mother was wont to comment. “Always stretchin' his neck an' lookin' up an' away--when he mought git out by looking down.” And the simile was so apt that it stayed in his mind--looking up and away!  Of all dull inventions, in his estimation the art of printing exceeded. He had made but indifferent progress in education during his early youth; he was a slow and inexpert reader, and a writer whose chirography shrank from exhibition. Now, however, a book in the hand gave him a cherished sentiment of touch with the larger world beyond those blue ranges that limited his sphere, and he spent much time in sedulously reading certain volumes which he had brought home with him.  “Spent _money_ fur 'em!” his mother would ejaculate, contemplating this extreme audacity of extravagance.  As she often observed, “the plough-handles seemed red-hot,” and as soon as political conditions favored he ran for office. On the strength of his war record, a potent lever in those days, he was elected register of the county. True, there was only a population of about fifty souls in the county town, and the houses were log-cabins, except the temple of justice itself, which was a two-story frame building. But his success was a step on the road to political preferment, and his ambitious eyes were on the future. Into the midst of his quiet incumbency as register came Fate, all intrusive, and found him through the infrequent medium of a weekly mail. It was at the beginning of the retrospective enthusiasm that has served to revive the memories of the War, and he received a letter from an old comrade-in-arms, giving the details of a brigade reunion shortly to be held at no great distance, and, being of the committee, inviting him to be present.  Girard had participated in great military crises; he had marshalled his troop in line of battle; as a mere boy, he had ridden with the guidon lance planted on his stirrup, with the pennant flying above his head, as the marker to lead the fierce and famous Dov-inger Rangers into the thickest of the fight; yet he had never felt such palpitant tremors of excitement as when he stood on the hotel piazza of the New Helvetia Springs, where the banqueters had gathered, and suffered the ordeal of introduction to sundry groups of fashionable ladies. He had earlier seen specimens of the species in the course of military transitions through the cities of the lowlands, and he watched them narrowly to detect if they discerned perchance a difference between him and the men of education and social station with whom his advancement in the army had associated him. He did not reflect that they were too well-bred to reveal any appreciation of such incongruity, but he had never experienced a more ardent glow of gratification than upon overhearing a friend's remark: “Girard is great! Anybody would imagine he was used to all this!”  No strategist was ever more wary. He would not undertake to dance, for he readily perceived that the gyrations in the ball-room were utterly dissimilar to the clumsy capering to which he had been accustomed on the puncheon floor of a mountain cabin. He had the less reason for regret since he was privileged instead to stroll up and down the veranda,--“promenade” was the technical term,--a slender hand, delicately gloved, on the sleeve of his gray uniform, the old regimentals being _de rigueur_ at these reunions. A white ball-gown, such as he had never before seen, fashioned of tissue over lustrous white silk, swayed in diaphanous folds against him, for these were the days of voluminous draperies; a head of auburn hair elaborately dressed gleamed in the moonlight near his shoulder. Miss Alicia Duval thought him tremendously handsome; she adored his record, as she would have said--unaware how little of it she knew--and she did not so much intend to flirt as to draw him out, for there was something about him different from the men of her set, and it stimulated her interest.  “Isn't the moon heavenly!” she observed, gazing at the brilliant orb, now near the full, swinging in the sky, which became a definite blue in its light above the massive dark mountains and the misty valley below; for the building was as near the brink as safety permitted--nearer, the cautious opined.  “Heavenly? Not more'n it's got a right to be. It's a heavenly body, ain't it?” he rejoined.  “Oh, how sarcastic!” she exclaimed. “In what school did you acquire your trenchant style?”  He thought of the tiny district school where he had acquired the very little he knew of aught, and said nothing, laughing constrainedly in lieu of response.  The music of the orchestra came, to them from the ball-room, and the rhythmic beat of dancing feet; the wind lifted her hair gently and brought to them the fragrance of flowering plants and the pungent aroma of mint down in the depths of the ravine hard by, where lurked a chalybeate spring; but for the noisy rout of the dance, and now and again the flimsy chatter of a passing couple on the piazza, promenading like themselves, they might have heard the waters of the fountain rise and bubble and break and sigh as the pulsating impulse beat like heart-throbs, and perchance on its rocky marge an oread a-singing.  “But you don't answer me,” she pouted with an affectation of pettishness. “Do you know that you trouble yourself to talk very little, Captain Girard!”  “I think the more,” he declared.  “Think? Oh, dear me! I didn't know that anybody does anything so unfashionable nowadays as to _think!_ And what do you think about, pray?”  “About you!”  And that began it: he was a gallant man, and he had been a brave one. He was not aware how far he was going on so short an acquaintance, but his temerity was not displeasing to the lady. She liked his manner of storming the citadel, and she did not realize that he merely spoke at random, as best he might. He was in his uniform a splendid and martial presentment of military youth, and indeed he was much the junior of his compeers.  “Who are Captain Girard's people, Papa?” she asked Colonel Duval next morning, as the family party sat at breakfast in quasi seclusion at one of the small round tables in the crowded dining-room, full of the chatter of people and the clatter of dishes.  “Girard?” Colonel Duval repeated thoughtfully. “I really don't know. I have an impression they live somewhere in East Tennessee. I never met him till just about the end of the war.”  “Oh, Papa! How unsatisfactory you are! You never know anything about anybody.”  “I should think his people must be very plain,” said Mrs. Duval. Her social discrimination was extremely acute and in constant practice.  “I don't know why. He is very much of a gentleman,” the Colonel contended. His heart was warm to-day with much fraternizing, and it was not kind to brush the bloom off his peach.  “Oh, trifles suggest the fact. He is not at all _au fait_.”  He was, however, experienced in ways of the world unimagined in her philosophy. The reunion had drawn to a close, ending in a flare of jollity and tender reminiscence and good-fellowship. The old soldiers were all gone save a few regular patrons of the hotel, who with their families were completing their summer sojourn. Captain Girard lingered, too, fascinated by this glimpse of the frivolous world, hitherto unimagined, rather than by the incense to his vanity offered by his facile acceptance as a squire of dames. For the first time in his life he felt the grinding lack of money. Being a man of resource, he set about swiftly supplying this need. In the dull days of inaction, when the armies lay supine and only occasionally the monotony was broken by the engagement of distant skirmishers or a picket line was driven in on the main body, he had learned to play a game at cards much in vogue at that period, though for no greater hazards than grains of corn or Confederate money, almost as worthless. In the realization now that the same principles held good with stakes of value, he seemed to enter upon the possession of a veritable gold mine. The peculiar traits that his one unique experience of the world had developed--his coolness, his courage, his discernment of strategic resources--stood him in good stead, and long after the microcosm of the hotel lay fast asleep the cards were dealt and play ran high in the little building called the casino, ostensibly devoted to the milder delights of billiards and cigars.  Either luck favored him or he had rare discrimination of relative chances in the run of the cards, or the phenomenally bold hand he played disconcerted his adversaries, but his almost invariable winning began to affect injuriously his character. Indeed, he was said to be a rook of unrivalled rapacity. Colonel Duval was in the frame of mind that his wife called “bearish” one morning as his family gathered for breakfast in the limited privacy of their circle about the round table in the dining-room.  “I want you to avoid that fellow, Alicia,” he growled _sotto voce_, as he intercepted a bright matutinal smile that the"]]]
