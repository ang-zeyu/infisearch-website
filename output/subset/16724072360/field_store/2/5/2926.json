She asked many astonishing questions about divine mysteries.\" It is a truly comic anticlimax in her father's stilted letters to her to have him end his pious instructions with this advice: \"And as you love me do not eat green apples.\"  Of the demeanor of children to their parents naught can be said but praise. Respectful in word and deed, every letter, every record shows that the young Puritans truly honored their fathers and mothers. It were well for them to thus obey the law of God, for by the law of the land high-handed disobedience of parents was punishable by death. I do not find this penalty ever was paid, as it was under the sway of grim Calvin, a fact which redounds to the credit both of justice and youth in colonial days.  It was not strange that Judge Sewall, always finding in natural events and appearances symbols of spiritual and religious signification, should find in his children painful types of original sin.       \"Nov. 6, 1692.--Joseph threw a knop of Brass and hit his Sister      Betty on the forehead so as to make it bleed; and upon which, and      for his playing at Prayer-time and eating when Return Thanks, I      whip'd him pretty smartly. When I first went in (call'd by his      Grandmother) he sought to shadow and hide himself from me behind      the head of the Cradle; which gave me the sorrowful remembrance of      Adam's carriage.\"  It was natural, too, that Judge Sewall's children should be timid; they ran in terror to their father's chamber at the approach of a thunderstorm; and, living in mysterious witchcraft days, they fled screaming through the hall, and their mother with them, at the sudden entrance of a neighbor with a rug over her head.  All youthful Puritans were not as godly as the young Sewalls. Nathaniel Mather wrote thus in his diary:       \"When very young I went astray from God and my mind was altogether      taken with vanities and follies: such as the remembrance of them      doth greatly abase my soul within me. Of the manifold sins which      then I was guilty of, none so sticks upon me as that, being very      young, I was _whitling_ on the Sabbath-day; and for fear of being      seen, I did it behind the _door_. A great _reproach_ of God! a      specimen of that _atheism_ I brought into the world with me!\"  It is satisfactory to add that this young prig of a Mather died when nineteen years of age. Except in Jonathan Edwards's \"Narratives of Surprising Conversions,\" no more painful examples of the Puritanical religious teaching of the young can be found than the account given in the _Magnalia_ of various young souls in whom the love of God was remarkably budding, especially this same unwholesome Nathaniel Mather. His diary redounded in dismal groans and self-abasement: he wrote out in detail his covenants with God. He laid out his minute rules and directions in his various religious duties. He lived in prayer thrice a day, and \"did not slubber over his prayers with hasty amputations, but wrestled in them for a good part of an hour.\" He prayed in his sleep. He fasted. He made long lists of sins, long catalogues of things forbidden, \"and then fell a-stoning them.\" He \"chewed much on excellent sermons.\" He not only read the Bible, but \"obliged himself to fetch a note and prayer out of each verse,\" as he read. In spite of all these preparations for a joyous hope and faith, he lived in the deepest despair; was full of blasphemous imaginations, horrible conceptions of God, was dejected, self-loathing, and wretched. Indeed, as Lowell said, soul-saving was to such a Christian the dreariest, not the cheerfullest of businesses.  That the welfare, if not the pleasure, of their children lay very close to the hearts of the Pilgrims, we cannot doubt. Governor Bradford left an account of the motives for the emigration from Holland to the new world, and in a few sentences therein he gives one of the deepest reasons of all--the intense yearning for the true well-being of the children; we can read between the lines the stern and silent love of those noble men, love seldom expressed but ever present, and the rigid sense of duty, duty to be fulfilled as well as exacted. Bradford wrote thus of the Pilgrims:       \"As necessitie was a taskmaster over them, so they were forced to      be such, not only to their servants, but in a sorte, to their      dearest children; the which, as it did not a little wound ye tender      harts of many a loving father and mother, so it produced likewise      sundrie sad and sorrowful effects. For many of their children, that      were of best dispositions and gracious inclinations, haveing lernde      to bear ye yoake in their youth, and willing to bear parte of their      parents burden, were, often times so oppressed with their hevie      labours, that though their minds were free and willing, yet their      bodies bowed under ye weight of ye same, and become decreped in      their early youth; the vigor of nature being consumed in ye very      budd as it were. But that which was more lamentable and of all      sorrowes most heavie to be borne, was, that many of their children,      by these occasions, and ye great licentiousness of youth in ye      countrie, and ye manifold temptations of the place, were drawn away      by evill examples into extravagante and dangerous courses, getting      ye raines off their neks and departing from their parents. Some      became souldiers, others took upon them for viages by sea, and      other some worse courses, tending to disolutenes and the danger of      their soules, to ye great greef of their parents and dishonor of      God. So that they saw their posteritie would be in danger to      degenerate and be corrupted.\"  Though Judge Sewall could control and restrain his children, his power waxed weak over his backsliding and pleasure-seeking grandchildren, and they annoyed him sorely. Sam Hirst, the son of poor timid Betty, lived with his grandfather for a time, and on April 1st, 1719, the Judge wrote:       \"In the morning I dehorted Sam Hirst and Grindall Rawson from      playing Idle tricks because 'twas first of April: They were the      greatest fools that did so. N. E. Men came hither to avoid      anniversary days, the keeping of them such as the 25th of Decr. How      displeasing must it be to God the giver of our Time to keep      anniversary days to play the fool with ourselves and others.\"  Ten years earlier the Judge had written to the Boston schoolmaster, begging him to \"insinuate into the Scholars the Defiling and Provoking nature of such a Foolish Practice\" as playing tricks on April first.  Sam was but a sad losel, and vexed him in other and more serious matters. On March 15th, 1725, the Judge wrote:       \"Sam Hirst got up betime in the morning, and took Ben Swett with      him and went into the Comon to play Wicket. Went before anybody was      up, left the door open: Sam came not to prayer at which I was much      displeased.\"  Two days later he writes thus peremptorily of his grandson:       \"Did the like again, but took not Ben with him. I told him he could      not lodge here practicing thus. So he log'd elsewhere.\"  Though Boston boys played \"wicket\" on Boston Common, I fancy the young Puritans had, as a rule, few games, and were allowed few amusements. They apparently brought over some English pastimes with them, for in 1657 it was found necessary to pass this law in Boston:       \"Forasmuch as sundry complaints are made that several persons have      received hurt by boys and young men playing at football in the      streets, these therefore are to enjoin that none be found at that      game in any of the streets, lanes or enclosures of this town under      the penalty of twenty shillings for every such offence.\"  One needless piece of cruelty which was exercised toward boys by Puritan lawgivers is shown by one of the enjoined duties of the tithingman. He was ordered to keep all boys from swimming in the water. I do not doubt that the boys swam, since each tithingman had ten families under his charge; but of course they could not swim as often nor as long as they wished. From the brother sport of winter, skating, they were not debarred; and they went on thin ice, and fell through and were drowned, just as country boys are nowadays. Judge Sewall wrote on November 30th, 1696:       \"Many scholars go in the afternoon to Scate on Fresh Pond. Wm.      Maxwell and John Eyre fall in, are drowned.\"  In the _New England Weekly Journal_ of January 15th, 1728, we read:       \"On Monday last Two Young Persons who were Brothers, viz Mr. George      and Nathan Howell diverting themselves by Skating at the bottom of      the Common, the Ice breaking under them they were both drowned;\"  and in the same journal of two weeks later date we find record of another death by drowning.       \"A young man, viz, Mr. Comfort Foster, skating on the ice from      Squantum Point to Dorchester, fell into the Water & was drown'd. He      was about 16 or 18 years of age.\"  Advertisements of \"Mens and Boys Scates\" appear in the _Boston Gazette_, of 1749, and the _Boston Evening Post_, of 1758. The February _News Letter_, of 1769, has a notice of the sale of \"Best Holland Scates of Different Sizes.\"  In the list of goods on board a prize taken by a privateersman in 1712 were \"Boxes of Toys.\" Higginson, writing to his brother in 1695, told him that \"toys would sell if in small quantity.\" In exceeding small quantity one would fancy. In 1743 the _Boston News Letter_ advertised \"English and Dutch Toys for Children.\" Not until October, 1771, on the lists of the Boston shop-keepers, who seemed"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24165"],["title","The Development of Embroidery in America (#1)"],["body","Associated Artists, 1885                                140    THREE SCENES FROM THE BAYEUX TAPESTRY                              146     THE DEVELOPMENT OF EMBROIDERY IN AMERICA     INTRODUCTORY -- THE STORY OF THE NEEDLE   The story of embroidery includes in its history all the work of the needle since Eve sewed fig leaves together in the Garden of Eden. We are the inheritors of the knowledge and skill of all the daughters of Eve in all that concerns its use since the beginning of time.  When this small implement came open-eyed into the world it brought with it possibilities of well-being and comfort for races and ages to come. It has been an instrument of beneficence as long ago as \"Dorcas sewed garments and gave them to the poor,\" and has been a creator of beauty since Sisera gave to his mother \"a prey of needlework, 'alike on both sides.'\" This little descriptive phrase--alike on both sides--will at once suggest to all needlewomen a perfection of method almost without parallel. Of course it can be done, but the skill of it must have been rare, even in those far-off days of leisure when duties and pleasures did not crowd out painstaking tasks, and every art was carried as far as human assiduity and invention could carry it.  A history of the needlework of the world would be a history of the domestic accomplishment of the world, that inner story of the existence of man which bears the relation to him of sunlight to the plant. We can deduce from these needle records much of the physical circumstances of woman's long pilgrimage down the ages, of her mental processes, of her growth in thought. We can judge from the character of her art whether she was at peace with herself and the world, and from its status we become aware of its relative importance to the conditions of her life.  There are few written records of its practice and growth, for an art which does not affect the commercial gain of a land or country is not apt to have a written or statistical history, but, fortunately in this case, the curious and valuable specimens which are left to us tell their own story. They reveal the cultivation and amelioration of domestic life. Their contribution to the refinements are their very existence.  A history of any domestic practice which has grown into a habit marks the degree of general civilization, but the practice of needlework does more. To a careful student each small difference in the art tells its own story in its own language. The hammered gold of Eastern embroidery tells not only of the riches of available material, but of the habit of personal preparation, instead of the mechanical. The little Bible description of captured \"needlework alike on both sides\" speaks unmistakably of the method of their stitchery, a cross-stitch of colored threads, which is even now the only method of stitch \"alike on both sides.\"  It is an endless and fascinating story of the leisure of women in all ages and circumstances, written in her own handwriting of painstaking needlework and an estimate of an art to which gold, silver, and precious stones--the treasures of the world--were devoted. More than this, its intimate association with the growth and well-being of family life makes visible the point where savagery is left behind and the decrees of civilization begin.  I knew a dear Bible-nourished lonely little maid who had constructed for herself a drama of Eve in Eden, playing it for the solitary audience of self in a corner of the garden. She had brought all manner of fruits and had tied them to the fence palings under the apple boughs. This little Eve gathered grape leaves and sewed them carefully into an apron, the needle holes pierced with a thorn and held together by fiber stripped from long-stemmed plantain leaves. Here she and her audience of self hid under the apple boughs and waited for the call of the Lord.  The long ministry of the needle to the wants of mankind proves it to have been among the first of man's inventions. When Eve sewed fig leaves she probably improvised some implement for the process, and every daughter of Eve, from Eden to the present time, has been indebted to that little implement for expression of herself in love and duty and art. For this we must thank the man who, the Bible relates, was \"the father of all such as worked in metals, and made needles and gave them to his household.\" He is the first \"handy man\" mentioned in history--blest be his memory!  If the day should ever come, not, let us hope, in our time or that of our children, when the manufacturer shall find that it no longer pays to make needles, what value will attach to individual specimens! If they were only to be found in occasional bric-à-brac shops or in the collections of some far-seeing hoarder of rarities, it would be difficult to overrate the interest which might attach to them. How, from the prodigal disregard of ages and the mysteries of the past, would emerge, one after another, recovered specimens, to be examined and judged and classified and arranged!  Perhaps collections of them will be found in future museums under different headings, such as:  \"Needles of Consolation,\" under which might come those which Mary Stuart and her maids wrought their dismal hours into pathetic bits of embroidery during the long days of captivity, or the daughter of the sorrowful Marie Antoinette mended the dilapidations of the pitiful and ragged Dauphin; or:  \"Needles of Devotion,\" wielded by canonized and uncanonized saints in and out of nunneries; or:  \"Needles of History,\" like those with which Matilda stitched the prowess of William the Conqueror into breadths of woven flax.  Possibly there may arise needle experts who, upon microscopic examination and scientific test, will refer all specimens to positive date and peculiar function, and by so doing let in floods of light upon ancient customs and habits. It is idle to speculate upon a condition which does not yet exist, for, happily, needles for actual hand sewing are yet in sufficient demand to allow us to indulge in their purchase quite ungrudgingly.  I was once shown a needle--it was in Constantinople--which the dark-skinned owner declared had been treasured for three hundred years in his family, and he affirmed it so positively and circumstantially that I accepted the statement as truth. In fact, what did it matter? It was an interesting lie or an interesting truth, whichever one might consider it, and the needle looked quite capable of sustaining another century or so of family use. Its eye was a polished triangular hole made to carry strips of beaten metal, exactly such as we read of in the Bible as beaten and cut into strips for embroidery upon linen, such embroidery, in fact, as has often been burned in order to sift the pure gold from its ashes.  Not only the history, but the poetry and song of all periods are starred with real and ideal embroideries--noble and beautiful ladies, whose chief occupations seem to have been the medicining of wounds received in their honor or defense, or the broidering of scarfs and sleeves with which to bind the helmets of their knights as they went forth to tourney or to battle. In these old chronicles the knights fought or made music with harp or voice, and the women ministered or made embroidery, and so pictured lives which were lived in the days of knights and ladies drifted on. The sword and the needle expressed the duties, the spirit, and the essence of their several lives. The men were militant, the women domestic, and wherever in castle or house or nunnery the lives of women were made safe by the use of the sword the needle was devoting itself to comforts of clothing for the poor and dependent, or luxuries of adornment for the rich and powerful. So the needle lived on through all the civilizations of the old world, in the various forms which they developed, until it was finally inherited by pilgrims to a new world, and was brought with them to the wilderness of America.     CHAPTER I -- BEGINNINGS IN THE NEW WORLD   The history of embroidery in America would naturally begin with the advent of the Pilgrim Mothers, if one ignored the work of native Indians. This, however, would be unfair to a primitive art, which accomplished, with perfect appropriateness to use and remarkable adaptation of circumstance and material, the ornamentation of personal apparel.  The porcupine quill embroidery of American Indian women is unique among the productions of primitive peoples, and some of the dresses, deerskin shirts, and moccasins with borders and flying designs in black, red, blue, and shining white quills, and edged with fringes hung with the teeth and claws of game, or with beautiful small shells, are as truly objects of art as are many things of the same decorative intent produced under the best conditions of civilization.  To create beauty with the very limited resources of skins, hair, teeth, and quills of animals, colored with the expressed juice of plants, was a problem very successfully solved by these dwellers in the wilderness, and the results were practically and æsthetically valuable.  In the Smithsonian Institution at Washington, D. C., there has happily been preserved a most interesting collection of these early efforts. The small deerskin shirts worn as outer garments by the little Sioux were perhaps among the most interesting and elaborate. They are generally embroidered with dyed moose hair and split quills of birds in their natural colors, large split quills or flattened smaller quills used whole. The work has an embossed effect which is very striking. A coat for an adult of Sioux workmanship, made of calfskin thicker and less pliant than the deerskin ordinarily used for garments, carries a broad band of quill embroidery, broken by whorls of the same, the center of each holding a highly decorated tassel made of narrow strips of deerskin, bound at intervals with split porcupine quills. These ornamental tassels carry the idea of"]]]
