There won't be much risk if you're quick.\"  \"Risk!\" exclaimed one of his comrades; \"it will be certain death!\"  But the daring Coastguardsman had already seized the thin line and plunged into the boiling surf.  His anxious comrades knew that delay would only make death more certain, so they hauled on the endless line as quickly as they could.  Of course, being rove through the block before mentioned, the other half of it went out to the wreck with the gallant rescuer holding on.  And what an awful swim that was!  The line pulled him out, indeed, but it could not buoy him up.  Neither could it save him from the jagged rocks that rose out of the sea every now and then, like black teeth which were quickly re-swallowed by each crashing wave.  It was more like a dive than a swim, for the seething foam burst over him continually; but every time he rose above the surface to gasp for breath, he sent up a great shout to God for strength to enable him to save the perishing!  Those loud prayers were drowned by the roaring tempest, but, though unheard by man, they did not fail to enter the ears of Him who rules in earth and Heaven.  Once the hero was thrown headlong on a rock, and so severely bruised that he lost hold of the rope, and when swept off again was left foundering in the foam.  His comrades could barely see that something had happened to him, and a loud cry of consternation arose when they felt the line run light and slack.  But our hero caught it again, and the cry was changed to a cheer as they ran him out to the vessel's side.  He was soon on board, and saw at a glance what was the matter.  The crew of the brig, being benumbed by long exposure, had not strength to tie the heavy cable round the mast.  This the Coastguardsman did for them at once, and, as he did so, observed that there were two little girls among the crew.  Then he gave a well-understood signal with a ship's lantern to the men on shore, who fastened a slung lifebuoy to their whip line, hung it by a block to the thick cable, and ran it quickly out to the wreck.  There was no time to lose now.  Our hero seized the two little girls and put them into the bag which hung from the circular lifebuoy.  \"Take care of my darlings,\" gasped the captain of the brig, who clung to the ship's side almost quite exhausted.  \"Come, get into the buoy, and go ashore with 'em yourself,\" cried our hero.  \"No.  The three of us would be too heavy; send the steward.  He's a light man and brave,\" replied the captain.  The steward was ordered to jump on the buoy and cling to it, so as to guard the little ones and prevent their being thrown out.  A signal having been again given with the lantern, the lifebuoy was drawn swiftly to land.  It was a terrible passage, for the brig had begun to roll on her rocky bed, and at every roll the hawser and the lifebuoy dipped into the sea, or were jerked violently out of it, while the risk of being let drop on the black rocks that came grinning to the surface was very great.  But all went well.  The three were received on the rocks with cheers, and conveyed up the cliffs to the Coastguard-house above, where warm welcome and shelter awaited them.  The cheers were not heard by those in the wreck, but the re-appearance of the lifebuoy proved that the children had been saved, and a deep \"Thanks be to God!\" burst from their father's lips.  Still the captain refused to go, when urged.  \"No,\" he said, \"let the men go first.\"  So, one by one, the men were safely hauled on shore.  \"Now, captain, it's your turn at last,\" said our hero, approaching him.  He still hesitated.  Then the stout Coastguardsman absolutely lifted him into the lifebuoy.  \"No time for ceremony,\" he said, with a smile, giving the signal with his lantern, \"the brig's going fast.  Tell 'em to look sharp on shore, for I'm gettin' used up with all this work.\"  Away went the captain, and in a few minutes back came the lifebuoy.  Not a moment too soon.  Blackbeard sprang in as the mizzen-mast snapped with a report like a cannon, and went over the side.  The next wave broke up the wreck itself.  Before the lifebuoy had gained the shore it was plunged into the sea, out of which it no longer rose, the support of the wreck being gone.  The men on shore now hauled on the rope with desperate energy, for a few minutes more would be sure to settle the question of life or death.  Through the surging breakers and over the rugged rocks the lifebuoy was dragged, and a shout of relief arose when the gallant Coastguardsman was seen clinging to it.  But he was insensible, and it was with difficulty that they loosened the grip of his powerful hands.  Then they bore him up the cliffs and laid him in his own bed, and looked anxiously upon his deadly white face as they covered him with blankets, applied hot bottles to his feet, and chafed his cold, stiff limbs.  At last there came a fluttering sigh, and the eyelids gently opened.  \"Where am I?\" he asked faintly.  A young man having the appearance of a clergyman, laid his hand gently on his shoulder.  \"All right, Tom!\" he said; \"through the goodness of the Lord you're saved, and fourteen souls along with you.\"  \"Thank God!\" said Tom Thorogood fervently, and, as he said so, the tide of life once more coursed strongly through his veins, and brought back the colour to his manly face.    CHAPTER FOUR.  The great city was sound asleep.  It was the deadest hour of the night, if we may apply that term to three o'clock in the morning, the hour at which most people have sought and found their pillows.  Late revellers had ceased to shout and sing, early risers had yet a good hour of rest before them, if not more.  Of course there were many wakeful sick folk-- ah! how many in that mighty hive called London!  But these did not disturb the profound quiet that had descended on the city: only a few weak but steady lights in windows here and there told of their existence.  Among the sleepless, on that calm dark night, there was one man to whom we draw attention.  His bronzed cheeks and tall muscular frame told that he was not one of the wakeful sick, neither was he a sick-nurse, to judge from things around him.  He sat with his elbows on his knees and his hands clasped, gazing into the fire and meditating--perhaps building castles in the flames.  His eyebrows were very bushy and his looks stern, but there was a play of gentle, kindly feeling round his mouth. He was one of a gallant band of picked men whose duty it is to do battle with the flames, a member of the London Fire-brigade.  Two other men like himself lay on two little iron beds sound asleep with their clothes on.  There was this difference between them, however, that the wakeful man wore brass epaulettes on his shoulders.  Brass helmets and axes hung round the room.  A row of boots hung in a rack, a little telegraph instrument stood on a table near a map of London, and a small but sociable clock ticked on the wall.  That clock had quite a lively, cheerful tick.  It seemed to talk to the fireman with the bushy brows until he smiled and looked at it.  \"Tic--tic--tic!\" said the man, \"how low and gentle your voice seems to-night.  Everything is so still and quiet, that you appear to be only whispering the flight of time.\"  \"Tic--tic--tic,\" replied the clock.  But the fireman heard no more, for just then a faint, far-distant sound broke upon his ear.  It drew near, like a rushing wind.  Then like the noise of hurrying feet.  The man rose and nudged one of the sleepers, who sat up and listened, after which he got up quickly, reached down his helmet, and awoke his companion, while the first fireman went to the station door.  Some one ran against it with fearful violence as he laid his hand on the lock, and the alarm-bell rang a tremendous peal as he threw it open.  \"Fire!\" yelled a man who seemed all eyes and hair.  \"Just so; where is it?\" replied the fireman, calmly glancing at the clock.  \"Fire!\" again yelled the man of eyes and hair, who was for the moment mad with excitement.  \"You've said that twice; where _is_ it?\" said the fireman, seizing the man by his arm, while the two men, who had been asleep, slipped out like fleet but quiet ghosts.  One called up the sleeping firemen, the other got out two horses which stood ready harnessed in their stalls.  The fireman's grasp sobered the madman.  A street was named.  The outbreak of the fire was instantly telegraphed to head-quarters, and thence to other stations concerned.  Round came the horses; in flowed the roused firemen, buttoning their garments as they ran each to his own peg for helmet and axe.  At the same time two or three hauled out the steam fire-engine and yoked the horses.  Three minutes from the first shout of fire had barely elapsed when the whip cracked, eight or ten helmeted men sprang to their seats, the steeds bounded away and tore along the no longer quiet streets, leaving a trail of sparks behind them.  Haste! haste! was the one idea.  One minute saved may be a matter of life or death in cases of fire.  Constant training, stern drill, made every man act like a calm, cool, collected thunderbolt.  No fuss, but tremendous energy.  No noise, but now and then a deep bass roar when any vehicle chanced to get in the way, and a quiet smile when the danger was passed.  Thus they rushed along, like a fierce fiery monster, until they reached a square in the great city which was bright as with the sun at noon-day. A mansion was blazing from"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23384"],["title","Gascoyne, the Sandal-Wood Trader (#1)"],["body"," as he was fond of styling himself, said this with a serio-comic air of sarcasm, for he was an exception to the general rule of his fellows.  He had little respect for, and no fear of, his commander.  Indeed, to say truth, (for truth must be told, even though the character of our rugged friend should suffer,) Jo entertained a most profound belief in the immense advantage of muscular strength and vigour in general, and of his own prowess in particular.  Although not quite so gigantic a man as his captain, he was nearly so, and, being a bold self-reliant fellow, he felt persuaded in his own mind that he could thrash him, if need were.  In fact, Jo was convinced that there was no living creature under the sun, human or otherwise, that walked upon two legs, that he could not pommel to death with more or less ease by means of his fists alone.  And in this conviction he was not far wrong.  Yet it must not be supposed that Jo Bumpus was a boastful man or a bully. Far from it.  He was so thoroughly persuaded of his invincibility, that he felt there was no occasion to prove it.  He therefore followed the natural bent of his inclinations, which led him at all times to exhibit a mild, amiable, and gentle aspect--except, of course, when he was roused.  As occasion for being roused was not wanting in the South Seas in those days, Jo's amiability was frequently put to the test.  He sojourned, while there, in a condition of alternate calm and storm; but riotous joviality ran, like a rich vein, through all his chequered life, and lit up its most sombre phases like gleams of light on an April day.  \"You entered my service with your own consent,\" replied the captain to Jo's last remark, \"and you may leave it, with the same consent, whenever you choose; but you will please to remember that I did not engage you to serve on board the schooner.  Back there you do not go either with or without your consent, my fine fellow, and if you are bent on going to sea on your own account--you've got a pair of good arms and legs--you can swim!  Besides,\" continued the captain, dropping the tone of sarcasm in which this was said, and assuming a more careless and good-natured air, \"you were singing something not long since, if I mistake not, about `farewell to the rolling sea,' which leads me to think you will not object to a short cruise on shore for a change, especially on such a beautiful island as this is.\"  \"I'm your man, capting,\" cried the impulsive seaman, at the same time giving his oar a pull that well-nigh spun the boat round.  \"And, to say wots the plain truth, d'ye see, I'm not sorry to ha done with your schooner, for, although she is as tight a little craft as any man could wish for to go to sea in, I can't say much for the crew,--saving your presence, Dick\"--(he added, glancing over his shoulder at the surly-looking man who pulled the bow oar.) \"Of all the rascally set I ever clapped eyes on, they seems to me the worst.  If I didn't know you for a sandal-wood trader, I do believe I'd take ye for a pirate.\"  \"Don't speak ill of your messmates behind their backs, Jo,\" said the captain with a slight frown.  \"No good and true man ever does that.\"  \"No more I do,\" replied John Bumpus; while a deep red colour suffused his bronzed countenance.  \"No more I do; leastwise if they wos here I'd say it to their faces, for they're a set of as ill-tongued villains as I ever had the misfortune to--\"  \"Silence!\" exclaimed the captain, suddenly, in a voice of thunder.  Few men would have ventured to disobey the command given by such a man, but John Bumpus was one of those few.  He did indeed remain silent for two seconds, but it was the silence of astonishment.  \"Capting,\" said he, seriously, \"I don't mean no offence, but I'd have you to know that I engaged to work for you, not to hold my tongue at your bidding, d'ye see.  There aint the man living as'll make Jo Bumpus shut up w'en he's got a mind to--\"  The captain put an abrupt end to the remarks of his refractory seaman by starting up suddenly in fierce anger and seizing the tiller, apparently with the intent to fell him.  He checked himself, however, as suddenly, and, breaking into a loud laugh, cried--\"Come, Jo, you must admit that there is at least one living man who has made you `shut up' before you had finished what you'd got to say.\"  John Bumpus, who had thrown up his left arm to ward off the anticipated blow, and dropped his oar in order to clench his right fist, quietly resumed his oar, and shook his head gravely for nearly a minute, after which he made the following observation:--  \"Capting, I've seed, in my experience o' life, that there are some constitootions as don't agree with jokin'; an' yours is one on 'em. Now, if you'd take the advice of a plain man, you'd never try it on. You're a grave man by natur', and you're so bad at a joke that a feller can't quite tell w'en you're a-doin' of it.  See, now, I do declare I wos as near drivin' you right over the stern o' your own boat as could be, only by good luck I seed the twinkle in your eye in time.\"  \"Pull away, my lad,\" said the captain, in the softest tones of his deep voice, at the same time looking his reprover straight in the face.  There was something in the tone in which that simple command was given, and in the look by which it was accompanied; that effectually quelled John Bumpus in spite of himself.  Violence had no effect on John, because in most cases he was able to meet it with superior violence, and in all cases he was willing to try.  But to be put down in this mild way was perplexing.  The words were familiar, the look straightforward and common enough.  He could not understand it at all, and, being naturally of a philosophical turn of mind, he spent the next three minutes in a futile endeavour to analyse his own feelings.  Before he had come to any satisfactory conclusion on the subject, the boat's keel grated on the white sand of the shore.  Now, while all that we have been describing in the last and present chapters was going on, a very different series of events was taking place on the coral-island, for there, under the pleasant shade of the cocoa-nut palms, a tall, fair, and handsome youth was walking lightly down the green slopes towards the shore in anticipation of the arrival of the schooner, and a naked dark-skinned savage was dogging his steps, winding like a hideous snake among the bushes, and apparently seeking an opportunity to launch the short spear he carried in his hand at his unsuspecting victim.  As the youth and the savage descended the mountain-side together, the former frequently paused when an opening in the rich foliage peculiar to these beautiful isles enabled him to obtain a clear view of the magnificent bay and its fringing coral reef, on which the swell of the great Pacific--so calm and undulating out beyond--fell in tremendous breakers, with a long, low, solemn roar like distant thunder.  As yet no object broke the surface of the mirror-like bay within the reef.  Each time the youth paused the savage stopped also, and more than once he poised his deadly spear, while his glaring eyeballs shone amid the green foliage like those of a tiger.  Yet upon each occasion he exhibited signs of hesitation, and finally lowered the weapon, and crouched into the underwood.  To any one ignorant of the actors in this scene, the indecision, of the savage would have appeared unaccountable; for there could be no doubt of his desire to slay the fair youth--still less doubt of his ability to dart his formidable spear with precision.  Nevertheless, there was good reason for his hesitating, for young Henry Stuart was well known, alike by settlers and savages, as possessing the swiftest foot, the strongest arm, and the boldest heart in the island, and Keona was not celebrated for the possession of these qualities in any degree above the average of his fellows, although he did undoubtedly exceed them in revenge, hatred, and the like.  On one occasion young Stuart had, while defending his mother's house against an attack of the savages, felled Keona with a well-directed blow of his fist.  It was, doubtless, out of revenge for this that the latter now dogged the former through the lonely recesses of the mountain-pass by which he had crossed the island from the little settlement in which was his home, and gained the sequestered bay in which he expected to find the schooner.  Up to this point, however, the savage had not summoned courage to make the attack, although, with the exception of a hunting-knife, his enemy was altogether unarmed, for he knew that in the event of missing his mark the young man's speed of foot would enable him to outstrip him, while his strength of frame would quickly terminate a single combat.  As the youth gained the more open land near the beach, the possibility of making a successful cast of the spear became more and more doubtful. Finally the savage shrunk into the bushes and abandoned the pursuit.  \"Not here yet, Master Gascoyne,\" muttered Henry as he sat down on a rock to rest; for although the six miles of country he had crossed was a trifle, as regarded distance, to a lad of nineteen, the rugged mountain-path by which he had come would have tried the muscles of a Red Indian, and the nerve of a goat.  \"You were wont to keep to time better in days gone by.  Truly it seems to me a strange thing that I should thus be made a sort of walking post between my mother's house and this bay, all for the benefit of a man who seems to me no better than he should be, and whom I don't like, and yet whom I _do_ like in some unaccountable fashion that I don't understand.\"  Whatever the youth's thoughts were after giving vent to the foregoing soliloquy, he kept them to himself.  They did not at first appear to be of an agreeable nature, for he frowned once or twice, and struck his thigh with his clenched hand, but gradually a pleasant expression lit up his manly face as he gazed out upon the sleeping"]]]
