A dam of water reflecting pink cloud-tips lay bright and still as a sheet of steel.  The fields of lucerne, under the morning light, were softly turning from black to emerald, and beyond the aloe hedge a native kraal that was scattered on the side of a hill slowly woke to life.  A dog barked; a wisp of smoke curled between the thatched huts, and one or two blanketed figures crept from the low doors.  The simple yet secret lives of these people intrigued Christine deeply.  She knew little of Kafirs, for she had been in Africa only a few months; but the impassive silence of them behind their watching, alert eyes always fascinated her.  They said so little before their masters, the whites.  Here, for instance, was a little colony of fifty or more people living in a kraal close to their employers.  Some of them were grey-haired and had worked for a quarter of a century on the farm--the men on the land, the women at the house--yet, once their daily tasks were over, none knew what their lives were when they returned to the straggling village of palisades and low-doored huts.  Musing on these things, Christine turned at last and sauntered slowly homeward.  Everything was still very quiet, but smoke was rising from the solid farm chimneys, and, rounding the corners of some large outbuildings, she came suddenly upon more life--feathery, fantastic life of spindlelegs and fluttering wings.  Scores of baby ostriches, just released from their night shelter, were racing into the morning light, pirouetting round each other like crazy, gleesome sprites. Christine stood laughing at their fandangos and the antics of the Kafirs engaged in herding them.  A man standing near, pipe in mouth, and hands in pockets, observing the same scene, was astonished that her sad yet passionate face could so change under the spell of laughter. He had wondered, when he first saw her, why a girl with such ardent eyes should wear such weariness upon her lips and look so disdainfully at life.  Now he saw that it was a mask she wore and forgot when she was alone, and he wondered still more what had brought such a girl to be a governess on a Karoo farm.  But in a moment Christine's face changed, resuming, like a veil over its youth and bloom, the look of world-weariness.  She bowed slightly to him, with a somewhat cool response to his pleasant morning greeting, and made haste to resume her walk homeward.  She knew him to be Richard Saltire, the government forest and land expert, who was engaged in certain experiments on the farm.  He shared a bungalow somewhere on the land with two young Hollanders who were learning ostrich-farming, and came with them to lunch every day at the house.  Already, his bold, careless face, with its sunbitten beauty, had separated itself in her memory from the faces of the other men, for it was a face and personality that could not leave a woman undisturbed. Incidentally, it had disturbed her in connection with an impression not altogether agreeable.  One of the first hints Mrs. van Cannan had given the new governess was that the master of Blue Aloes did not care for any kind of intimacy to exist between the womenfolk of the farm and the men occupied about it. Christine had been long enough in South Africa to recognize that this was an odd departure from the general rule of friendliness and equality; but a hint to the proud has the same efficacy as a word to the wise.  Besides, she had no longing for the society of men, but rather a wish to forget that she had ever known any.  Life had made a hole in her heart which she meant to fill if she could, but only with inanimate things and the love of children.  So that Mr. van Cannan's unsociable restriction, far from being irksome, suited her perfectly.  Mrs. van Cannan apparently did not apply to herself her husband's injunction, for she was charming to everybody, and especially to Mr. Saltire.  It was impossible not to notice this, and also that the fact was not lost upon the gloomy, fanatic glance of the master of the house.  If Mr. Saltire showed bad taste in so openly returning Mrs. van Cannan's interest, it had to be admitted that it was the form of bad taste that is a law unto itself and takes no thought of the opinion of others.  Although Africa had spoiled Saltire's complexion, it was evident that she had never bowed his neck or put humility into his eye or made him desist from looking over his boldly cut nose as though he had bought the world and did not want it.  But to Christine Chaine it seemed that to cause pain to a man racked with neuritis and jealousy for the sake of a mild flirtation with a pretty woman was a cruel as well as a dangerous game.  That was one of the reasons why the friendliness of his morning greeting had been met with such coldness.  She had known heartlessness before in her life, and wished no further acquaintance with it.  That was the resolution with which she hurried back through the straggling garden, the whitewashed porch, and massive front door to the nursery.  The children, full of high spirits and wilfulness, were engaged in their morning romp of trying to evade Meekie, the colored \"nannie,\" whose business it was to bathe them.  They were extraordinarily lovable children, in spite of a certain elf-like disobedience which possessed them like a disease.  It was quite enough to tell them not to do a thing for them to be eaten up with a desire to do it forthwith.  Christine had discovered this, and had learned to manage them in other ways than by direct command.  \"Take Roddy--no; take Coral, she is the dirtiest--no, no--Rita!  Rita is the pig!\" they shrieked, as they pranced from bed to bed.  \"Bathe yourself, old Meekie--you are the blackest of all.\"  Christine had her work cut out with them for the next half-hour, but at last they were marshalled, sweet and shining, to breakfast, where she presided, for their father always took an early breakfast, and Mrs. van Cannan never rose until eleven.  Afterward, according to custom, they paid a visit to the latter's room, to wish her good-morning.  Isabel van Cannan was a big, lazy, laughing woman, with sleepy, golden eyes.  She spent hours in bed, lying, as she did now, amid quantities of pillows, doing absolutely nothing.  She had told Christine that she was of Spanish extraction, yet she was blond as a Swede.  Her hair, which had a sort of lamb's-wool fluffiness, lay upon her pillows in two great ropes, yellow as the pollen of a lily.  She took the children one by one into a sleepy embrace, kissed and patted their cheeks, admonishing them to be good and obey Miss Chaine in everything.  \"Be sure not to go in the sun without your hats,\" she adjured the two small girls.  \"Roddy doesn't matter so much, but little girls' complexions are very important.\"  Rita and Coral stuck out their rose-pink chins and exchanged a sparkling glance.  Christine knew that she would have trouble with them and their hats all day.  \"Good-bye,\" said Mrs. van Cannan, and sank back among her pillows.  As the children scampered out of the room, she called sharply, \"Don't go near the dam, Roddy!\"  Christine had heard her say that before, and always with that sharp inflection.  \"I never let them go near the dam without me,\" she said reassuringly. Mrs. van Cannan did not answer, but a quiver, as if of pain, passed over her closed eyelids.  Outside in the passage, Roderick pressed close to Christine and murmured, with a sort of elfin sadness:  \"Carol was drowned in the dam.\"  The girl was startled.  \"Carol?\" she echoed.  \"Who was Carol?\"  \"My big brother--a year older than me,\" he whispered.  \"He is buried out in the graveyard.  I'll take you to see the place if you like.  Let us go now.\"  Christine collected herself.  \"We must go to lessons now, dear.  Later on, you shall show me anything you like.\"  But from time to time during the morning, sitting in the creeper-trimmed summer-house they used for a school-room, with her charges busy round her, Christine's thoughts returned to the strange little revelation.  Roddy, with his red-gold brush of hair, bent over his slate, was not the first-born, then!  _He_ had been drowned in the dam--that peaceful sheet of walled-in water that reflected the pink tips of dawn and wherein, at eventide, the cattle waded happily to drink.  This old Karoo farmhouse had known tragedy, even as she had sensed.  Small wonder Bernard van Cannan's eyes wore a haunted look! Yet his wife, with her full happy laugh and golden locks, lying among her pillows, seemed curiously untouched by sorrow.  Except for that quiver of the eyelids, Christine had never seen her show anything but a contented face to life.  Well--the history of Blue Aloes was a sealed book when the girl came to it, knowing nothing of its inmates beyond their excellent references as an old Huguenot family.  Now the book, slowly opening page by page, was revealing strange things.  The luncheon-hour always provided fresh material for a reflective mind. The dining-room was large and lofty, and the table must have dated back to the early days at the Cape, when every great family had its scores of retainers and slaves.  It was composed of time-stained teak, and could have seated dozens, being curiously shaped like a capital E with the middle branch of the letter missing.  Only one of the branches was now in use, and at this Christine presided over her small charges, fortunately somewhat aloof from the rest, for they had many odd habits which it was her business to correct without drawing attention.  Coral did not like pumpkin, and would keep dropping it on the floor.  Rita loved to kill flies with a spoon.  Roddy's specialty was sliding bits of meat into the open jaws of a pointer--there were always several under the table--then briskly passing his plate for more.  Once or twice, looking up from correcting these idiosyncrasies, the girl found the blue"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22568"],["title","Blue Aloes: Stories of South Africa (#2)"],["body","of Richard Saltire fixed upon her as if in ironic inquiry, and though she felt the slow colour creep into her face, she returned the glance coldly.  How dare he be curious about her, she thought rather angrily.  Let him confine himself to making the lids of his hostess droop and her cheeks dimple.  Not that Christine believed there to be any harm in their open flirtation--Mrs. van Cannan was plainly devoted to her husband; perhaps it was natural that she should enjoy admiration.  She possessed the kind of beauty only to be achieved by the woman who makes the care of her appearance an art, and spends hours in absolute repose of mind and body.  Her face had not a line in it of strain or sorrow.  Faint pink tinted her cheeks.  Her pink-linen gown, open in a low V, showed the perfect contour and creaminess of her breast.  The restless, adoring eyes of her husband came back to her always with that glance, vigilant and sombre, that was peculiar to them.  With some assumption of state, he always sat in the centre of the body of the table, with his wife beside him.  Saltire sat at her right, and Saxby, the overseer, was placed beside his host.  Opposite them, on the other side of the table, were the two young Hollanders and a cheerful Scotch colonial called McNeil.  These six men were expected to take both luncheon and dinner at the farm, but only the Hollanders turned up in the evening, perhaps because the excellence of the fare was outbalanced by the long prayers and hymns with which the meal was prefaced and ended.  Even at lunch-time, there was a Bible at the host's elbow, from which he read a number of texts before pronouncing a long grace, while the visitors listened with expressions that varied from embarrassment to impatience.  Richard Saltire always looked frankly bored, but sometimes he and Mrs. van Cannan exchanged a smile of sympathy at having to listen to the maledictions of Job while the roast was getting cold.  Hymns for lunch were mercifully omitted.  Bernard van Cannan, though plainly a religious fanatic, was also the owner of one of the wealthiest farms in the colony, and no doubt he realized that the working-hours of his employees might be more profitably engaged than by chanting hymns.  Saxby, the overseer, a dark, burly man of unusual height, was marked by the thick lips and general fulness of countenance that suggests to those who have lived long enough in Africa \"a touch of colour.\"  He had the soft voice, too, and full, deep laugh of those who have a dash of native blood in their veins.  His manner was melancholy, though charming, and he imposed his society upon no man, but attended strictly to his business.  He was the best manager the farm had ever known. After being there for less than a year, he had so improved the stock and the land that Bernard van Cannan looked upon him as a little god, and his word was law on the farm.  His private history, a rather sad one, Christine had already heard from Mrs. van Cannan.  It appeared that his wife had been terribly disfigured in a fire and was not only a semi-invalid but a victim of melancholia.  She lived with him in an isolated bungalow some way off, and he did everything for her with his own hands as she shrank from being seen by any one, and particularly detested natives.  While her husband was away at his duties, she remained locked in the bungalow, inaccessible to any one save Mrs. van Cannan, who sometimes went to sit with her.  \"But I can't bear to go often,\" Isabel van Cannan told Miss Chaine. \"She depresses me so terribly, and what good can I do her, poor soul?\"  Unnecessary for her to add that she hated being depressed.  It was bad for the complexion, she laughed.  Laughter was never far from her lips. But, at the moment, there really seemed some trace of the morning's pain on her as she looked at her husband.  \"Bernard's shoulder is giving him so much trouble,\" she said appealingly to Saltire.  \"He wants to go to East London to see his old specialist, but I don't believe in that man.  I think rest in bed is the cure for all ills.  Don't you agree with me, Mr. Saltire?\"  \"Bed has its uses no doubt,\" laughed Saltire, with the cheerful carelessness of the thoroughly healthy man, \"but a change of scene is better sometimes, for some people.\"  Van Cannan, his shoulder and left eye twitching perpetually, turned a searching gaze upon the deeply tanned face of the forestry expert, as though suspecting some double meaning in the words.  Saltire bore the scrutiny undisturbed.  Immaculate in white linens, his handsome fairish head wearing a perpetually well-groomed look, perhaps by reason of a bullet which, during the Boer War, had skimmed straight through his hair, leaving a perfect parting in the centre, he was a striking contrast to the haggard master of the house, who muttered morosely:  \"There is some Latin saying--isn't there?--about people 'changing their skies but not their dispositions.'\"  \"_In_disposition is a different matter,\" remarked Saxby sagely, \"and with neuritis it is a mistake to let the pain get too near the heart. I think you ought to see a doctor, Mr. van Cannan, but East London is a long way off.  Why not call in the district man?\"  \"He would prescribe a bottle of pink water and charge me a couple of pounds for it.  I need better treatment than that.  I could not even ride this morning--had to leave my horse and walk home.  The pain was vile.\"  Saxby looked at him sympathetically.  \"Well, try a couple of weeks' rest in bed, as Mrs. van Cannan suggests. You know that I can keep things going all right.\"  \"And Mr. Saltire will continue to turn the prickly-pears into ogres and hags,\" said his wife, with her childlike smile.  \"When you get up again, he will have a whole army of shrivelled monsters ready for you.\"  It is true that this was Richard Saltire's business on the farm--to rid the land of that bane and pest of the Karoo, the prickly-pear cactus. The new governmental experiment was the only one, so far, that had shown any good results in getting rid of the pest.  It consisted in inoculating each bush with certain poisons, which, when they entered the sap of the plant, shrivelled and withered it to the core, making its large, pale, flapping hands drop off as though smitten by leprosy, and causing the whole bush to assume a staggering, menacing attitude that was immensely startling and grotesque.  Many of the natives were now afraid to go about on the farm after dusk.  They said the prickly-pears threatened them, even ran after them, intent on revenge.  Christine had heard Mr. van Cannan say that his father knew the man whose grandfather was the first Dutchman to introduce the prickly-pear into the Karoo.  It was a great treasure then, being looked upon as good fodder for beast and ostrich in time of drought, and the boy used to be beaten if he did not properly water the leaves which were being laboriously preserved on the great trek into the desert. Unfortunately, the preservation had been so complete that it was now the ruin of many a fine Karoo estate, springing up everywhere, smothering other growths and destroying, with its tiny multitudinous thorns, the stomachs of the cattle, who love too much its watery leaves.  Mr. van Cannan was one of the farmers rich enough to take drastic steps to save his farm.  Saltire was doing it for him very thoroughly and efficiently.  \"How much longer do you expect to be?\" asked van Cannan.  \"Oh, another three weeks ought to finish the job,\" said Saltire.  \"But, as you know, they are most persistent things.  When you think they are done for, you find them sprouting green again below the wound, and have to give them another dose.\"  \"Three weeks!\" muttered van Cannan, with moody eyes.  He looked to Christine like a man suffering with sickness of the soul.  Everyone supposed the rest-cure definitely settled on, but, with the contrariness of an ailing child, he suddenly announced determinedly, \"I shall leave for East London this afternoon.\"  The children were called to kiss him good-bye, and they clustered round him.  \"Take care of them for me,\" he said, with a piercing wistfulness, to Christine.  \"Take care of my boy.\"  Then he turned brusquely to Saxby, making arrangements for a mule-cart to be ready at two o'clock to drive him into Cradock, the nearest large town, where he would have to spend the night before proceeding farther by rail.  Christine could not but be struck by the words he had used, and mused over them wonderingly while she tucked Rita and Coral under their mosquito-curtains.  It was her habit to spend this hour with Roddy and a story-book.  But today he hovered restlessly, showing no inclination to settle down, and seeming full of some suppressed excitement.  At last, he whispered in her ear:  \"Don't forget where you said you would come with me--to see Carol and the others.\"  Christine wondered if old Sophy was one of the others, and, even in the noontide heat, she felt a chill.  \"All right, Roddy,\" she agreed slowly.  \"Wait till I get a sunshade, though.  It is dreadfully hot.\"  She shaded him as much as herself while they threaded their way through the shrubs that seemed to simmer in the grey-brown heat.  Almost every South African farm has its private cemetery.  It is the custom to bury the dead where they have lived, and often the graveyard is in the shadiest corner of the garden, where the women sit to sew, the men bring their pipes, and children spread their playthings upon the flat, roughly hewn tombstones.  At Blue Aloes, the place of the dead was hidden far from the haunts of the living, but the narrow, uncertain path led to it at last--a bare, sun-bleached spot, secluded but unshaded by a gaudy-blossomed hedge of cactus.  A straight, single line of graves, less than a dozen in number, lay blistering in the sunshine.  Some were marked with slabs of lime-worn [Transcriber's note: time-worn?] stone, upon whose faded lettering little green rock-lizards were disporting "]]]
