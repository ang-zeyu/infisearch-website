See how much of the ground is used for the building. Find the garden. What are in the garden? Which is larger, the garden or the playground? What shape is the playground? How many doors are there to the building? In how many ways can you get into the playground?  Try to draw a plan of your school building and yard, showing the gates, the flagpole, the drinking fountain or pump, and any other parts you think of. Show which door you use most.      _Note to the Teacher._--The pupils should draw the plan upon paper     while the teacher draws it upon the blackboard. Infinite care should     be exercised to invest every line with its full meaning. Upon the     proper interpretation of this first plan will depend much of the     pupil's future ability to correctly read a map as the representation     of a reality.   5  THE INSIDE OF THE SCHOOL  As you walk from the school door to your room what do you see? Tell all that you have noticed in the corridors, on the staircases, in the cloak-rooms and the class-rooms.   6  We will go on a little excursion through the school today, walking along all of the corridors and upon all of the staircases. Look especially to see anything that you never saw before, and notice anything that you forgot to mention in yesterday's description.   7  Answer the following questions:  1. How many stories high is our school?  2. How many class-rooms are on each floor?  3. How many other rooms are on each floor?  4. How many staircases does our school have?  5. What materials have been used in building the staircases?  6. What can be seen in the corridor nearest your room?  7. By how many doorways can the children leave the building?  8. How is your school heated and ventilated?   8  Describe everything that you can see in your class-room.   9  [Illustration: PLAN OF SCHOOL ROOM]  Look at this plan of a school-room. See if you can draw a plan of _your_ school-room.   10  Make a list of all the materials that have been used in building the inside of your school. Remember all of the following parts:    Floors      Windows       Corridor furnishings   Ceilings    Doors         Class-room furnishings   Walls       Staircases  Now write a list of the kinds of workmen who gathered together these materials. Name as many of the kinds of workmen as you can think of who were engaged on the inside work of the building.   11  Write a letter to anyone whom you know who has never seen our school. Tell all about our building and the good workmen by whom it was planned and built.     CHAPTER II  THE STREETS AND ROADS   1  On what street or road does your school stand?  On what street or road do you live?  What streets or roads do you pass on your way home?  What do you think is the finest street or road that you have ever seen anywhere? What makes that so good a street or road?  Name a poor street or road. What could be done to improve it?   2  Why do cities and towns have streets and roads? Where are there no streets?  Look at the country picture shown on page 19. How pretty it is! When would it be pleasant to walk there? When would it not be so pleasant? Why? What must be done to a road to make it into a good street? Tell what you can of the different ways of paving, lighting and draining streets and roads, and of the different kinds of name-signs you have seen.  Now what can be done to make a street or road beautiful and pleasant in warm weather?  How can boys and girls help to keep the streets and roads pleasant?  Here is a plan of some of the streets in a large city.  [Illustration: PLAN OF CITY STREETS.]   3  Draw the shape of the school lot. Now show the street or road that the school stands upon. If you live in a town, draw the streets next to the school. Then draw the next streets, and keep on until you have drawn the street on which your home stands. Place a little cross to show your home. With your pencil start from your house and make a dotted line to show how you come to school.   4  On your plan of the neighborhood place a circle to show the grocery store or bakery that you pass on your way to school. Make a large dot to show the nearest store to school, and with a dotted line explain how you would go there from school if your teacher sent you to buy ink. Make a circle with a cross in it to show where there is a church, a bank, a factory, or any other important building near your school. If there is a railroad near, show it upon your plan.  [Illustration: A COUNTRY HOME.]   5  Many streets and lanes have names of trees. Some have been named after great and good men. There are some streets with only numbers for names. Do you know of any streets having names of these different kinds? Can you think of any street or road that received its name for some other reason?  Get as many pictures as you can of the streets of your town or any other town and paste them in your note-book. Get some pictures of country roads and paste them also in your note-book.  [Illustration: A CITY STREET.   (Copyright, 1911, William H. Rau, Philadelphia.)]   6  In some towns the streets are nearly straight and cross each other like the wires of a window-screen. In other towns the streets run off from the centre of the town like the spokes of a wheel. Some streets and roads are very crooked.  How are the streets in our town arranged? Name some of our best business streets. Which streets have the finest homes in which people live? Name some streets or roads with trolley lines upon them. Are our streets paved?   7  Perhaps you live in the country where there are very few streets or none at all. How different is your walk to school each day from that of the city boy or girl! In town, children walk on paved streets and pass many buildings. What kind of roads do the country children walk upon? What buildings do they pass? A country school.  [Illustration: A MODERN COUNTRY SCHOOL.]  Do you take a pleasant road between broad fields? Do you walk through the cool shady woods? Perhaps you run over a bridge with the clear brook sparkling and babbling beneath. What else do you see or hear in the country which city folks do not know in their built up towns?     CHAPTER III  THE BUILDINGS   1  What kinds of buildings do you pass on your way to school? Write a list of all the kinds that you have ever seen.  Look at the pictures of buildings in this book and see if you know for what each is used. How can you tell?   2  Of all the many kinds of buildings in town or country, the _houses_ are the most important. It is more necessary to have good homes to live in than to have the other buildings large or beautiful. What makes a good residence? There must be enough room for the whole family. It needs plenty of light, air, sunshine and water. It must have a good roof to keep it dry in stormy weather. It should be well heated in the cold winter. Tell of other things that are needed in our homes to keep the family healthy and happy. How can you help to make your home pleasant?   3  Good _schools_, too, are very necessary. The school-house must be built to keep the boys and girls comfortable and healthy while at work. Name some of the things needed for a good school building.  [Illustration: A STREET SCENE IN NEW YORK.]   4  The libraries and museums also teach people. A _library_ is like a home where many friendly teachers live. These friends will talk to you and tell you many useful and wonderful things. Have you ever visited them at the library? Have you ever taken any of them home with you? Is there a library near our school?  The _museums_ are full of many interesting objects. You may see beautiful pictures and statuary. Some have collections of pretty stones and of stuffed animals. Curious clothing, jewelry, toys and musical instruments used by people in distant lands are shown too. In a museum in Portland you may see the dear little clothing worn by the poet Longfellow when he was a tiny baby. Many books that Washington read are kept in a museum near the city of Washington. Have you ever visited a museum in a city? What did you see there?   5  No buildings anywhere are more beautiful than the _churches_. Are there any churches in your neighborhood? Describe the church which you attend.   6  In town and country there are many ill people who cannot be cared for at home. They go to _hospitals_ to be nursed back to health and strength. The good doctors and nurses work day and night to cure the sick people. How can well people help sick people? Where is the nearest hospital to your home? What is it named?  [Illustration: INDEPENDENCE HALL.]   7  Almost every town has a _Town Hall_. Have you ever seen such a building? What is it used for? Here the mayor has his office. Sometimes the Town Hall or Court House has a high tower, or a fine dome, or a cupola. If you have ever seen a Town Hall tell how it looked.   8  Think of the _stores_ that you have seen. How many kinds can you name? What does each sell principally? Where are these things made? Have you ever seen a large _factory_? What does it manufacture?  [Illustration: PITTSBURGH OBSERVATORY.]  It would be fine if all of the buildings in which folks work were sunny, airy and clean. People employed in comfortable stores and factories are happy and feel like working.  Alas! there are many miserable places where the workmen are crowded and uncomfortable. The impure air makes them tired and ill. If you have seen a good store or factory tell what helps to keep the workers comfortable and healthy.   9  Old cities have in them many very old buildings that all Americans love. The magnificent Capitol at Washington was built long ago. It is one of the finest buildings in the world. It is built of white marble. In the first picture in this book notice the beautiful dome and the great high stairs. In Philadelphia is the dear old Independence Hall with the Liberty Bell. Boston has the old Faneuil Hall. Here many great"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22911"],["title","Where We Live (#2)"],["body","of long ago have spoken to the people. Are there any old historic buildings in our neighborhood?  [Illustration: LONGFELLOW'S BIRTHPLACE, PORTLAND, MAINE.]   10  Suppose some friends travel on the railroad to visit us. At what railroad station would the train arrive? Are there any other stations? How are they built? Do you think they give a beautiful, clean, friendly welcome to strangers? All stations should be pleasant and comfortable to cheer the tired travelers that pass through them day and night. At Denver, just outside of the station, there is a great arch stretching across the street. It says, \"Welcome,\" in bright letters at night and in pretty letters in the day. The visitor is glad to see the friendly word after a long trip.  [Illustration: OLD SOUTH CHURCH, BOSTON.]   11  When friends come from another town we like to show them the sights. Plan a nice trip around the town. Write a list of places to which you would take them. You must know where each place is. What could you tell about each place?   12  One day we should visit some park. Is there any near our school? Are there any interesting buildings or statuary in the park? Is there any water near by?  When we visit our town park we should remember that it belongs to us, for a public park belongs to all of the people. Do you not like to have the things that belong to you as good, as useful and as beautiful as possible? Do you want your home to look sweet and clean and comfortable, or dirty, careless and unpleasant? Do you want your clothing to be strong, neat and pretty, or torn and dirty? We should all take pride in having the things we own just as good as possible. When you are in the street, the school, any public building, or in a park, say to yourself, \"This is mine.\" Then look around and see whether you like the way it looks. Think how you can help to keep it looking well or make it look even better.  [Illustration: WINTER SCENE IN FAIRMOUNT PARK.]  How can boys and girls help keep the grass, the paths, the flower-beds, the trees and the buildings beautiful? Where does the money come from to pay the caretakers of the park?  Some people visit the park only in spring, summer or autumn. We all love the park in those seasons. Many do not know how beautiful the bare trees look in winter with their gray or brown branches. There is no more exquisite sight in the world than to see these trees coated with glistening ice out to the tiniest twig, or to see them ridged with pearly white snow. It is a merry sight to see the jolly coasters and skaters.   13  Copy the list of buildings given below and mark each kind that you have seen. Tell where you saw it, of what it was built, or for what it was used.    Residence    School                 Museum   Store        Church                 Car-barn   Bank         Hospital               Library   Factory      Railroad station       Office   Stable       Government building    Garage   Dairy        Barn                   Ice House  What building is shown on the cover of this book?     CHAPTER IV  THE TOWN AS A WHOLE   1  Think of the times when you have walked or ridden about our town.  What rivers did you see?  [Illustration: CAPITOL AT HARRISBURG.]  Which buildings did you think were very beautiful?  What was each used for?  What buildings have we that are very helpful to the people?  What interesting places have you visited in your neighborhood?  What other places would you like to visit?   2  PREPARATION FOR A TRIP TO SOME HILLTOP, OBSERVATORY, TOWER OR ROOF-GARDEN FROM WHICH AN EXTENSIVE VIEW CAN BE HAD  What place shall we visit? Why? Draw a plan to include the school and the place to be visited.  How far must we go? Shall we ride or walk? In what direction shall we go?  When we are up high we can look over the whole neighborhood. First, try to find our school. In what direction shall we need to face? Then let us notice what lies between us and our school. See if you can find any park or large building which you know. Try to find the street or road upon which your home stands. Then look beyond our school for any other familiar building or park, and look for your home if you did not see it before. Notice how far the town stretches and try to see what cuts it off or bounds it.  Next we shall turn and look in the opposite direction. What direction will that be? Find any familiar places. How can you know which are homes, schools, churches or factories? See how far the town extends and what cuts off or bounds it on this side.  In what other directions shall we look? Again we shall notice the familiar and unfamiliar places and the town boundaries.   3  THE TRIP   4  Was the neighborhood view like you expected? What surprised you? What did we see most of? Make a list of all the places you remember seeing. Think of each view separately; north, south, east and west. Tell of anything you saw as you looked in each direction. Why could we see so much? How could we see even farther?   5  Do we live in a large city, a small town or in the country? What is the name of our town or the nearest town? Who first settled in the place which has grown to be a town? It is hard for us to believe that two hundred and fifty years ago there were no houses, churches, schools, streets or roads where we now live. All this land was wild country, mostly woods. The early settlers were strong and brave men. They had to cut down the forests and build their first homes of rough logs. Then they planted fields with corn, wheat and vegetables. They killed the wild animals for food, using the skins for clothing. As soon as possible the settlers tried to build a small plain church and a school-house.  [Illustration: CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS. From a \"Thistle\" Print.   (Copyright, Detroit Publishing Co.)]  [Illustration: COLUMBUS'S SHIP.]  Now we have our fine towns which have grown from the early work of these first sturdy settlers. All of the people should love our dear home town and try to make it beautiful, healthful and comfortable. We should love our neighbors and treat them all like brothers and sisters. If we are true to our village or our dear town we will be kind and fair to all, rich and poor, Americans and foreigners, white and colored people. That is one way of showing our thankfulness for our comfortable homes.     CHAPTER V  THE PEOPLE   1  Think of the many buildings which you see as you look over the landscape. There are people living in nearly all of those houses. Just think of the many, many people who live here. How many are there? How many schools have we in the town? How many people go to your school?  Most of these people look much alike, but some are very different in appearance. Name some of the different kinds of people whom you have seen. How do you distinguish a negro and Chinaman or Mongolian from a white person or Caucasian? Tell about their hair, skin or any other peculiar features.  Each kind of people is called a race. The pictures show some of the races we often see--Caucasian, Mongolian and negro. The Chinese and Japanese are called Mongolians.   2  THE INDIANS  The Indians lived at this place which is now our home long before there were any white people here or any towns at all. Where these many buildings now stand there was wild country, fields and woods. Under the trees stood the Indian wigwams made of skins and branches. The early settlers came to this country from far across the ocean. After William Penn landed with his companions he began at once to make friends with the Indians. As the red men were living upon the land, Penn thought that it was only fair and honest to buy from them the land that the English people wanted for their homes. The Indians could not use money, so he gave them blankets and other presents which pleased them very much. The Indians promised William Penn to live in peace with the white men and they kept their promise for many years.  [Illustration: AN INDIAN FAMILY.]  Most of the white people who came in those early days to other parts of our land did not act in this noble way. When they wanted land on which to build their homes they drove the Indians away, killing many of them. Thus these unjustly treated Indians became the enemies of the white men, and often treated them very cruelly in return. Let us remember that the Indians were the first owners of this land of ours and that they should be treated as William Penn showed us, with kindness and justice.  [Illustration: INDIAN CHIEF.]  Those wild Indians of long ago had many noble traits. They were strong and brave and fearless.      Read in some of your school books about Indians and their homes.   3  THE NEGROES  There were no negroes in this country till many years after Columbus and the other white men began to settle here. Some white men went far across the sea to Africa. They stole the negroes away from their homes, carried them to their ships and sailed back to this country. Then these white men sold the negroes to other men for money. The poor colored men had to work terribly hard as slaves and received no pay for their work. At last they were freed by Abraham Lincoln and others who helped him.  [Illustration: NEGRO.]  The negroes have much that is fine in their character. Even when they were slaves they often grew to love their masters so dearly that they would do anything in the world, even give up their lives, for their masters. We should always remember that God made the negro as well as the white man. Fair-minded people will try to be honest, kind and just to everyone.   4  THE CHINESE  [Illustration: CHINESE MANDARIN AND SERVANT.]  Many Chinamen have come to our country from their distant homes in China. Their country is so crowded, and it is so hard to earn a living there, that most of the people are very poor.  The Chinese living in our country are peaceful and quiet. They work very hard in their laundries and other places of business; yet there are many white people so cruel and thoughtless as to ridicule a"]]]
