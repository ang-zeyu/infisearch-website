Professor Lightning tried friendship, and argument, and even force--but nothing worked. Incredible as it seemed to the professor, Charley was content to remain a freak, an Armless Wonder. More, he seemed to be proud and happy about it.  It was too bad that the professor didn't think of the one argument that might have worked. In the long run, it wouldn't have made any difference, perhaps--but it would have cleared matters up, right there and then. Because the one workable argument had a good chance of succeeding.  But, then, Professor Lightning really didn't understand carny. He never thought of the one good argument, and after a while he gave up, and went away.  Of course, that was several days later. Professor Lightning told Charley that he was leaving for New York, and Charley said: \"What? In the middle of the season?\" Then he told Wrout, and Wrout screamed and ranted and swore that Professor Lightning would never work in carny again. \"I'll have you blacklisted!\" he roared.  And Professor Lightning shrugged and smiled and went away to pack. He took all his notebooks, and all the cages with little animals in them, and he didn't seem at all disturbed. \"I'll find another subject,\" he told Charley, when he left. \"When they find out what I've got, in New York, they'll provide me with subjects by the hundred. I did want to help you ...\"  \"Thanks,\" Charley said honestly.  \"... But that's the way things are, I suppose,\" Professor Lightning said. \"Maybe some day you'll realize.\"  Charley shook his head. \"I'm afraid not, professor,\" he said, and Professor Lightning shook Charley's foot, and left, and Charley went back to work in the freak show, and for a while he didn't even think about Professor Lightning. Then, of course, the news began to show up in the Chicago _American_, which Charley got two or three days late because his mother sent it to him by mail.  At first Charley didn't realize that Dr. Edmund Charles Schinsake was Professor Lightning, but then the _American_ ran his picture; that was the day Professor Lightning was awarded a medal by the AMA, and Charley felt pleased and happy for the old man. It looked as it he'd got what he wanted.  Charley, of course, didn't think much about the professor's \"limb regeneration\"; he didn't need it, he thought, and he didn't want it, and that was that.  And then, one night, he was dropped from the bally, and he asked Dave Lungs about it, and Dave said: \"Well, we want the biggest draw we can get, out there before the show,\" and put Erma, the Fish Girl, out in his place. And Charley started to wonder about that, and after a few days had gone by he found himself talking about it, to Ed Baylis, over in the cooktent while they were having lunch.  Baylis was a little man of sixty or so, with a wrinkled face like a walnut and a powerful set of lungs; he was Wrout's outside talker for the girlie show. \"Because I'm old,\" he said, grinning. \"I don't have trouble with the girls. And if I got to take one off the bally or out of the show there's no personal stuff that would make it tough, see what I mean?\"  \"That's what I'm worried about,\" Charley said.  \"What?\" Ed asked. He speared a group of string beans with his fork and conveyed them to his mouth. Charley, using his right foot, did the same.  \"The bally,\" Charley said. \"The way things are, Dave took me off, and I'm worrying about it.\"  \"Maybe some kind of a change,\" Ed said.  Charley shook his head. \"He said ... he said he wanted the biggest draw out there. Now, you know I'm a big draw, Ed. I always have been.\"  \"Sure,\" Ed said. He chewed another mouthful and swallowed. \"Still, people want a change now and then. Doesn't have to mean anything.\"  \"Maybe not,\" Charley said uncomfortably. But he wasn't convinced.         *       *       *       *       *  The season drew to a close, and Charley went off to the Florida Keys, where he spent a month living with some friends before holing up with his mother and sister for the winter. He was offered a job in New York, at a year-round flea museum in Times Square, but after some thought he decided against it. He'd never had to work winters, and he wasn't going to start.  After all, he was still doing well, wasn't he? He told himself emphatically that he was. He was an Armless Wonder, a born freak, the top of the carny ladder, with a good job wherever he cared to look for one.  He had to tell himself that quite a few times before he began to believe it.  Spring came, and then summer, and Charley kissed his mother and his sister good-by and joined Wrout's Carnival Shows in Summit, Idaho, three days before their opening. He didn't notice much change from previous years, but it took an effort not to notice some things.  Not like the new man who'd taken Professor Lightning's place--a tall thin youngster who had an Electric Chair act. Or like the periodic quarrels between Ned and Ed; it seemed they'd met a girl over the winter season, and disagreed about her. Ed thought she was perfectly wonderful; Ned couldn't see her for beans.  No, things like that were a part of carny; you got used to them, as the show rolled along year after year, and paid no more attention to them than a housewife pays to rather uninteresting back-fence gossip.  It was something else that had changed, something important.  His contract, for instance. It was made out for the same pay as he'd been getting, but the option periods were shortened up; suddenly, Charley was living from season to season, with almost no assurance of continuous, steady work. Old man Wrout had looked a little less than happy when he'd given Charley the contract; he'd almost seemed ashamed, and he hadn't really looked Charley in the eye once. But when Charley asked what was wrong, he got no answer.  Or none that meant anything. \"It's just the way things are,\" Wrout muttered. \"Don't make no difference, kid.\"  But it did make a difference. Charley wasn't out in the bally any more, either; he was backstage among the second-rate acts, the tattooed man and the fire-eater and the rest, while Erma and Ned and Ed and the top-liners took their bows out before the crowd, pulling them in, and got the gasps and the applause.  The crowds in front of his own platform, inside during the show, were smaller, too. At first Charley thought that was due to the bally itself, but as the season began and wore on, the crowds continued to shrink beyond all expectation. Counting as he worked, combing his hair with one foot, drawing little sketches for the customers (\"Take one home for only one extra dime, a treasured souvenir especially personalized for you by Charley de Milo\")--counting the house, he discovered one evening that he was the smallest draw in the tent. The tattooed man did better than Charley de Milo, which was enough of a disgrace; the rest were so far ahead that Charley didn't even want to think about it.  His first idea was that somebody was out to get him. He could feel the muscles of his shoulders and back bunching up when he tried thinking what to do about the sabotage that had struck him; but an Armless Wonder has one very real disadvantage. He can comb his own hair and brush his own teeth; he can feed himself and--with proper clothing--dress himself; he can open doors and shut windows and turn the pages of books. But he can't engage in a free-for-all fight, not without long and careful training in that style of battle known as _savate_, or boxing with the feet. Charley had never learned _savate_; he had never needed it.  For the first time since he could remember, he felt helpless. He wasn't normal; he couldn't do what any normal man could do. He wanted to find the man who was sabotaging his show, and beat him into a confession, and throw him off the lot--  And he couldn't.  The muscles of his back pulled and pulled at him. He clenched his jaw. Then Dave Lungs came over to his platform and he forced himself to relax, sweating. There were four or five people behind Dave, ordinary marks with soft, soft faces and round eyes. While Dave talked Charley went through his act; perhaps ten other marks were scattered in the tent, standing at other platforms, watching other acts even without Dave there to guide them and talk them up.  And when he was through Dave sold exactly one of the sketches Charley had done. One. An old man bought it, a chubby little Santa Claus of a man with eyes that twinkled and a belly that undoubtedly shook like a jelly bowl when it was freed from its expensive orlon confines. Dave went off to the next platform, where Erma stood, and the marks followed him, and more drifted over. Erma had ten customers, Charley noticed, and he grabbed a handkerchief from the platform floor and wiped his damp face with one foot.         *       *       *       *       *  _Something's wrong_, he thought stupidly, and he must have said it aloud because, at his feet, a high, thin old voice said: \"What was that, son? Did you say something?\"  \"Nothing at all,\" Charley mumbled, and looked down. The Santa Claus man was staring up at him. \"Show's over,\" Charley said, more curtly than he meant. He took a deep breath and set his feet more firmly on the platform, but it didn't do any good. He was like a coiled spring, waiting for release.  \"I don't expect any show,\" Santa Claus said. \"Really I don't. But I did want to talk to you for a few minutes, if you don't mind.\"  \"I'm not in a talking mood,\" Charley said. \"Sorry.\" He was ashamed of the words as soon as he brought them out; that was no way to treat any stranger, not even a mark. But it was a long second before he could say anything else. Santa Claus stood watching him patiently, holding Charley's sketch by one corner in his left hand.  \"I'm sorry,\" Charley said at last. \"It ... must be the heat. I'm kind of on edge.\"  \"Of course,\" Santa Claus said. \"I understand. Really I do.\"  There was a little silence. Dave and the crowd trailed away from Erma and headed"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2391"],["title","Bruce (#1)"],["body","in it before you could make a deal. But this is one of Chief's daughters. This is Rothsay Lass. A grand little girl, ain't she? Say,\"--in a confidential whisper,--\"since you've took a fancy for her, maybe I could coax the old man into lettin' you have her at an easy price. He was plannin' to sell her for a hundred or so. But he goes pretty much by what I say. He might let her go for--How much of a check did you say your uncle sent you?\"  \"Twelve dollars,\" answered the boy,--\"one for each year. Because I'm named for him. It's my birthday, you know. But--but a dollar of it went for the chain and the collar. How much do you suppose the gentleman would want for Rothsay Lass?\"  The kennel-man considered for a moment. Then he went back to the house, leaving the lad alone at the gate of the run. Eleven dollars, for a high-pedigreed collie pup, was a joke price. But no one else wanted Lass, and her feed was costing more every day. According to Rothsay standards, the list of brood-females was already complete. Even as a gift, the kennels would be making money by getting rid of the prick-eared \"second.\" Wherefore he went to consult with the foreman.  Left alone with Lass, the boy opened the gate and went into the run. A little to his surprise Lass neither shrank from him nor attacked him. She danced about his legs in delight, varying this by jumping up and trying to lick his excited face. Then she thrust her cold nose into the cup of his hand as a plea to be petted.  When the kennel-man came back, the boy was sitting on the dusty ground of the run, and Lass was curled up rapturously in his lap, learning how to shake hands at his order.  \"You can have her, the boss says,\" vouchsafed the kennel-man. \"Where's the eleven dollars?\"  By this graceless speech Dick Hazen received the key to the Seventh Paradise, and a life-membership in the world-wide Order of Dog-Lovers.  The homeward walk, for Lass and her new master, was no walk at all, but a form of spiritual levitation. The half-mile pilgrimage consumed a full hour of time. Not that Lass hung back or rebelled at her first taste of collar and chain! These petty annoyances went unfelt in the wild joy of a real walk, and in the infinitely deeper happiness of knowing her friendship-famine was appeased at last.  The walk was long for various reasons--partly because, in her frisking gyrations, Lass was forever tangling the new chain around Dick's thin ankles; partly because he stopped, every block or so, to pat her or to give her further lessons in the art of shaking hands. Also there were admiring boy-acquaintances along the way, to whom the wonderful pet must be exhibited.  At last Dick turned in at the gate of a cheap bungalow on a cheap street--a bungalow with a discouraged geranium plot in its pocket-handkerchief front yard, and with a double line of drying clothes in the no larger space behind the house.  As Dick and his chum rounded the house, a woman emerged from between the two lines of flapping sheets, whose hanging she had been superintending. She stopped at sight of her son and the dog.  \"Oh!\" she commented with no enthusiasm at all. \"Well, you did it, hey? I was hoping you'd have better sense, and spend your check on a nice new suit or something. He's kind of pretty, though,\" she went on, the puppy's friendliness and beauty wringing the word of grudging praise from her. \"What kind of a dog is he? And you're sure he isn't savage, aren't you?\"  \"Collie,\" answered Dick proudly. \"Pedigreed collie! You bet she isn't savage, either. Why, she's an angel. She minds me already. See--shake hands, Lass!\" \"Lass!\" ejaculated Mrs. Hazen. \"'SHE!' Dick, you don't mean to tell me you've gone and bought yourself a--a FEMALE dog?\"  The woman spoke in the tone of horrified contempt that might well have been hers had she found a rattlesnake and a brace of toads in her son's pocket. And she lowered her voice, as is the manner of her kind when forced to speak of the unspeakable. She moved back from the puppy's politely out-thrust forepaw as from the passing of a garbage cart.  \"A female dog!\" she reiterated. \"Well, of all the chuckle-heads! A nasty FEMALE dog, with your birthday money!\"  \"She's not one bit nasty!\" flamed Dick, burying the grubby fingers of his right hand protectively in the fluffy mass of the puppy's half-grown ruff. \"She's the dandiest dog ever! She--\"  \"Don't talk back to me!\" snapped Mrs. Hazen. \"Here! Turn right around and take her to the cheats who sold her to you. Tell them to keep her and give you the good money you paid for her. Take her out of my yard this minute! Quick!\"  A hot mist of tears sprang into the boy's eyes. Lass, with the queer intuition that tells a female collie when her master is unhappy, whined softly and licked his clenched hand.  \"I--aw, PLEASE, Ma!\" he begged chokingly. \"PLEASE! It's--it's my birthday, and everything. Please let me keep her. I--I love her better than 'most anything there is. Can't I please keep her? Please!\"  \"You heard what I said,\" returned his mother curtly.  The washerwoman, who one day a week lightened Mrs. Hazen's household labors, waddled into view from behind the billows of wind-swirled clothes. She was an excellent person, and was built for endurance rather than for speed. At sight of Lass she paused in real interest.  \"My!\" she exclaimed with flattering approval. \"So you got your dog, did you? You didn't waste no time. And he's sure a handsome little critter. Whatcher goin' to call him?\"  \"It's not a him, Irene,\" contradicted Mrs. Hazen, with another modest lowering of her strong voice. \"It's a HER. And I'm sending Dick back with her, to where she came from. I've got my opinion of people who will take advantage of a child's ignorance, by palming off a horrid female dog on him, too. Take her away, Dick. I won't have her here another minute. You hear me?\"  \"Please, Ma!\" stammered Dick, battling with his desire to cry. \"Aw, PLEASE! I--I--\"  \"Your ma's right, Dick,\" chimed in the washerwoman, her first interested glance at the puppy changing to one of refined and lofty scorn. \"Take her back. You don't want any female dogs around. No nice folks do.\"  \"Why not?\" demanded the boy in sudden hopeless anger as he pressed lovingly the nose Lass thrust so comfortingly into his hand. \"WHY don't we want a female dog around? Folks have female cats around them, and female women. Why isn't a female dog--\"  \"That will do, Dick!\" broke in his shocked mother. \"Take her away.\"  \"I won't,\" said the boy, speaking very slowly, and with no excitement at all.  A slap on the side of his head, from his mother's punitive palm, made him stagger a little. Her hand was upraised for a second installment of rebellion-quelling--when a slender little body flashed through the air and landed heavily against her chest. A set of white puppy-teeth all but grazed her wrathful red face.  Lass, who never before had known the impulse to attack, had jumped to the rescue of the beaten youngster whom she had adopted as her god. The woman screeched in terror. Dick flung an arm about the furry whirlwind that was seeking to avenge his punishment, and pulled the dog back to his side.  Mrs. Hazen's shriek, and the obbligato accompaniment of the washerwoman, made an approaching man quicken his steps as he strolled around the side of the house. The newcomer was Dick's father, superintendent of the local bottling works. On his way home to lunch, he walked in on a scene of hysteria.  \"Kill her, sir!\" bawled the washerwoman, at sight of him. \"Kill her! She's a mad dog. She just tried to kill Miz' Hazen!\"  \"She didn't do anything of the kind!\" wailed Dick. \"She was pertecting me. Ma hit me; and Lass--\"  \"Ed!\" tearily proclaimed Mrs. Hazen, \"if you don't send for a policeman to shoot that filthy beast, I'll--\"  \"Hold on!\" interrupted the man, at a loss to catch the drift of these appeals, by reason of their all being spoken in a succession so rapid as to make a single blurred sentence. \"Hold on! What's wrong? And where did the pup come from? He's a looker, all right a cute little cuss. What's the row?\"  With the plangently useless iterations of a Greek chorus, the tale was flung at him, piecemeal and in chunks, and in a triple key. When presently he understood, Hazen looked down for a moment at the puppy--which was making sundry advances of a shy but friendly nature toward him. Then he looked at the boy, and noted Dick's hero-effort to choke back the onrush of babyish sobs. And then, with a roughly tolerant gesture, he silenced the two raucous women, who were beginning the tale over again for the third time.  \"I see,\" he said. \"I see. I see how it is. Needn't din it at me any more, folks. And I see Dicky's side of it, too. Yes, and I see the pup's side of it. I know a lot about dogs. That pup isn't vicious. She knows she belongs to Dick. You lammed into him, and she took up and defended him. That's all there is to the 'mad-dog' part of it.\"  \"But Ed--\" sputtered his wife.  \"Now, you let ME do the talking, Sade!\" he insisted, half-grinning, yet more than half grimly. \"I'm the boss here. If I'm not, then it's safe to listen to me till the boss gets here. And we're goin' to do whatever I say we are--without any back-talk or sulks, either. It's this way: Your brother gave the boy a birthday check. We promised he could spend it any way he had a mind to. He said he wanted a dog, didn't he? And I said, 'Go to it!' didn't I? Well, he got the dog. Just because it happens to be a she, that's no reason why he oughtn't to be allowed to keep it. And he can. That goes.\"  \"Oh, Dad!\" squealed Dick in grateful heroworship. \"You're a brick! I'm not ever going to forget this, so long as I live. Say, watch her shake hands, Dad! I've taught her, already, to--\"  \"Ed Hazen!\" loudly protested his wife. \"Of all the softies! You haven't backbone enough for a prune. And if my orders to my own son are going to be--\"  \"That'll be all, Sade!\" interposed the man stiffly--adding: \"By the way, I got a "]]]
