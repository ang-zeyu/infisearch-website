The sea air, sunshine, and patience, Watson--all else will come.  \"Now, let us calmly define our position, Watson,\" he continued as we skirted the cliffs together.  \"Let us get a firm grip of the very little which we DO know, so that when fresh facts arise we may be ready to fit them into their places.  I take it, in the first place, that neither of us is prepared to admit diabolical intrusions into the affairs of men.  Let us begin by ruling that entirely out of our minds. Very good.  There remain three persons who have been grievously stricken by some conscious or unconscious human agency.  That is firm ground.  Now, when did this occur?  Evidently, assuming his narrative to be true, it was immediately after Mr. Mortimer Tregennis had left the room.  That is a very important point.  The presumption is that it was within a few minutes afterwards.  The cards still lay upon the table. It was already past their usual hour for bed.  Yet they had not changed their position or pushed back their chairs.  I repeat, then, that the occurrence was immediately after his departure, and not later than eleven o'clock last night.  \"Our next obvious step is to check, so far as we can, the movements of Mortimer Tregennis after he left the room.  In this there is no difficulty, and they seem to be above suspicion. Knowing my methods as you do, you were, of course, conscious of the somewhat clumsy water-pot expedient by which I obtained a clearer impress of his foot than might otherwise have been possible.  The wet, sandy path took it admirably. Last night was also wet, you will remember, and it was not difficult--having obtained a sample print--to pick out his track among others and to follow his movements.  He appears to have walked away swiftly in the direction of the vicarage.  \"If, then, Mortimer Tregennis disappeared from the scene, and yet some outside person affected the card-players, how can we reconstruct that person, and how was such an impression of horror conveyed?  Mrs. Porter may be eliminated.  She is evidently harmless.  Is there any evidence that someone crept up to the garden window and in some manner produced so terrific an effect that he drove those who saw it out of their senses?  The only suggestion in this direction comes from Mortimer Tregennis himself, who says that his brother spoke about some movement in the garden.  That is certainly remarkable, as the night was rainy, cloudy, and dark.  Anyone who had the design to alarm these people would be compelled to place his very face against the glass before he could be seen.  There is a three-foot flower-border outside this window, but no indication of a footmark.  It is difficult to imagine, then, how an outsider could have made so terrible an impression upon the company, nor have we found any possible motive for so strange and elaborate an attempt.  You perceive our difficulties, Watson?\"  \"They are only too clear,\" I answered with conviction.  \"And yet, with a little more material, we may prove that they are not insurmountable,\" said Holmes.  \"I fancy that among your extensive archives, Watson, you may find some which were nearly as obscure. Meanwhile, we shall put the case aside until more accurate data are available, and devote the rest of our morning to the pursuit of neolithic man.\"  I may have commented upon my friend's power of mental detachment, but never have I wondered at it more than upon that spring morning in Cornwall when for two hours he discoursed upon celts, arrowheads, and shards, as lightly as if no sinister mystery were waiting for his solution.  It was not until we had returned in the afternoon to our cottage that we found a visitor awaiting us, who soon brought our minds back to the matter in hand.  Neither of us needed to be told who that visitor was.  The huge body, the craggy and deeply seamed face with the fierce eyes and hawk-like nose, the grizzled hair which nearly brushed our cottage ceiling, the beard--golden at the fringes and white near the lips, save for the nicotine stain from his perpetual cigar--all these were as well known in London as in Africa, and could only be associated with the tremendous personality of Dr. Leon Sterndale, the great lion-hunter and explorer.  We had heard of his presence in the district and had once or twice caught sight of his tall figure upon the moorland paths. He made no advances to us, however, nor would we have dreamed of doing so to him, as it was well known that it was his love of seclusion which caused him to spend the greater part of the intervals between his journeys in a small bungalow buried in the lonely wood of Beauchamp Arriance.  Here, amid his books and his maps, he lived an absolutely lonely life, attending to his own simple wants and paying little apparent heed to the affairs of his neighbours.  It was a surprise to me, therefore, to hear him asking Holmes in an eager voice whether he had made any advance in his reconstruction of this mysterious episode.  \"The county police are utterly at fault,\" said he, \"but perhaps your wider experience has suggested some conceivable explanation.  My only claim to being taken into your confidence is that during my many residences here I have come to know this family of Tregennis very well--indeed, upon my Cornish mother's side I could call them cousins--and their strange fate has naturally been a great shock to me.  I may tell you that I had got as far as Plymouth upon my way to Africa, but the news reached me this morning, and I came straight back again to help in the inquiry.\"  Holmes raised his eyebrows.  \"Did you lose your boat through it?\"  \"I will take the next.\"  \"Dear me! that is friendship indeed.\"  \"I tell you they were relatives.\"  \"Quite so--cousins of your mother.  Was your baggage aboard the ship?\"  \"Some of it, but the main part at the hotel.\"  \"I see.  But surely this event could not have found its way into the Plymouth morning papers.\"  \"No, sir; I had a telegram.\"  \"Might I ask from whom?\"  A shadow passed over the gaunt face of the explorer.  \"You are very inquisitive, Mr. Holmes.\"  \"It is my business.\"  With an effort Dr. Sterndale recovered his ruffled composure.  \"I have no objection to telling you,\" he said.  \"It was Mr. Roundhay, the vicar, who sent me the telegram which recalled me.\"  \"Thank you,\" said Holmes.  \"I may say in answer to your original question that I have not cleared my mind entirely on the subject of this case, but that I have every hope of reaching some conclusion.  It would be premature to say more.\"  \"Perhaps you would not mind telling me if your suspicions point in any particular direction?\"  \"No, I can hardly answer that.\"  \"Then I have wasted my time and need not prolong my visit.\"  The famous doctor strode out of our cottage in considerable ill-humour, and within five minutes Holmes had followed him.  I saw him no more until the evening, when he returned with a slow step and haggard face which assured me that he had made no great progress with his investigation. He glanced at a telegram which awaited him and threw it into the grate.  \"From the Plymouth hotel, Watson,\" he said.  \"I learned the name of it from the vicar, and I wired to make certain that Dr. Leon Sterndale's account was true.  It appears that he did indeed spend last night there, and that he has actually allowed some of his baggage to go on to Africa, while he returned to be present at this investigation.  What do you make of that, Watson?\"  \"He is deeply interested.\"  \"Deeply interested--yes.  There is a thread here which we had not yet grasped and which might lead us through the tangle.  Cheer up, Watson, for I am very sure that our material has not yet all come to hand. When it does we may soon leave our difficulties behind us.\"  Little did I think how soon the words of Holmes would be realized, or how strange and sinister would be that new development which opened up an entirely fresh line of investigation.  I was shaving at my window in the morning when I heard the rattle of hoofs and, looking up, saw a dog-cart coming at a gallop down the road.  It pulled up at our door, and our friend, the vicar, sprang from it and rushed up our garden path. Holmes was already dressed, and we hastened down to meet him.  Our visitor was so excited that he could hardly articulate, but at last in gasps and bursts his tragic story came out of him.  \"We are devil-ridden, Mr. Holmes!  My poor parish is devil-ridden!\" he cried.  \"Satan himself is loose in it!  We are given over into his hands!\"  He danced about in his agitation, a ludicrous object if it were not for his ashy face and startled eyes.  Finally he shot out his terrible news.  \"Mr. Mortimer Tregennis died during the night, and with exactly the same symptoms as the rest of his family.\"  Holmes sprang to his feet, all energy in an instant.  \"Can you fit us both into your dog-cart?\"  \"Yes, I can.\"  \"Then, Watson, we will postpone our breakfast.  Mr. Roundhay, we are entirely at your disposal.  Hurry--hurry, before things get disarranged.\"  The lodger occupied two rooms at the vicarage, which were in an angle by themselves, the one above the other.  Below was a large sitting-room; above, his bedroom.  They looked out upon a croquet lawn which came up to the windows.  We had arrived before the doctor or the police, so that everything was absolutely undisturbed.  Let me describe exactly the scene as we saw it upon that misty March morning.  It has left an impression which can never be effaced from my mind.  The atmosphere of the room was of a horrible and depressing stuffiness. The servant who had first entered had thrown up the window, or it would have been even more intolerable.  This might partly be due to the fact that a lamp stood flaring and smoking on the centre table.  Beside it sat the dead man, leaning back in his chair, his thin beard projecting, his spectacles pushed up on to his forehead, and his"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23492"],["title","Fast in the Ice: Adventures in the Polar Regions (#1)"],["body","set sail under command of Captain Harvey.  Many days and nights passed, and the _Hope_ kept her course steadily toward the coast of North America.  Greenland was the first land they hoped to see.  Baffin's Bay was the strait through which they hoped to reach the open polar sea.  The _Hope_ left England as a whaler, with all the boats, lances, harpoons, lines, and other apparatus used in the whale fishery.  It was intended that she should do a little business in that way if Captain Harvey thought it advisable, but the discovery of new lands and seas was their chief end and aim.  At first the weather was fine, the wind fair, and the voyage prosperous. But one night there came a deep calm.  Not a breath of air moved over the sea, which was as clear and polished as a looking-glass.  The captain walked the deck with the surgeon of the ship, a nephew of his own, named Gregory.  Tom Gregory was a youth of about nineteen, who had not passed through the whole course of a doctor's education, but who was a clever fellow, and better able to cut and carve and physic poor suffering humanity than many an older man who wrote M.D. after his name.  He was a fine, handsome, strapping fellow, with a determined manner and a kind heart. He was able to pull an oar with the best man aboard, and could even steer the brig in fine weather, if need be.  He was hearty and romantic, and a great favourite with the men.  He, too, was a restless spirit.  He had grown tired of college life, and had made up his mind to take a year's run into the Polar regions, by way of improving his knowledge of the \"outlandish\" parts of the world.  \"I don't like the look of the sky to-day, Tom,\" said the captain, glancing at the horizon and then at the sails.  \"Indeed!\" said Tom, in surprise.  \"It seems to me the most beautiful afternoon we have had since the voyage began.  But I suppose you seamen are learned in signs which we landsmen do not understand.\"  \"Perhaps we are,\" replied the captain; \"but it does not require much knowledge of the weather to say that such a dead calm as this, and such unusual heat, is not likely to end in a gentle breeze.\"  \"You don't object to a stiff breeze, uncle?\" said the youth.  \"No, Tom; but I don't like a storm, because it does us no good, and may do us harm.\"  \"Storms do you no good, uncle!\" cried Tom; \"how can you say so?  Why, what is it that makes our sailors such trumps?  The British tar would not be able to face danger as he does if there were no storms.\"  \"True, Tom, but the British tar would not require to face danger at all if there were no storms.  What says the barometer, Mr Mansell?\" said the captain, looking down the skylight into the cabin, where the first mate--a middle-sized man of thirty-five, or thereabouts--was seated at the table writing up the ship's log-book.  \"The glass has gone down an inch, sir, and is still falling,\" answered the mate.  \"Reef the topsail, Mr Dicey,\" cried the captain, on hearing this.  \"Why such haste?\" inquired Gregory.  \"Because such a sudden fall in the barometer is a sure sign of approaching bad weather,\" answered the captain.  The first man on the shrouds and out upon the main-topsail yard was Sam Baker, whose active movements and hearty manner showed that he had quite recovered his health without the use of physic.  He was quickly followed by some of his shipmates, all of whom were picked men--able in body and ready for anything.  In a few minutes sail was reduced.  Soon after that clouds began to rise on the horizon and spread over the sky.  Before half an hour had passed the breeze came--came far stronger than had been expected--and the order to take in sail had to be repeated.  Baker was first again.  He was closely followed by Joe Davis and Jim Croft, both of them sturdy fellows--good specimens of the British seaman.  Davy Butts, who came next, was not so good a specimen.  He was nearly six feet high, very thin and loosely put together, like a piece of bad furniture.  But his bones were big, and he was stronger than he looked.  He would not have formed one of such a crew had he not been a good man.  The rest of the crew, of whom there were eighteen, not including the officers, were of all shapes, sizes, and complexions.  The sails had scarcely been taken in when the storm burst on the brig in all its fury.  The waves rose like mountains and followed after her, as if they were eager to swallow her up.  The sky grew dark overhead as the night closed in, the wind shrieked through the rigging, and the rag of canvas that they ventured to hoist seemed about to burst away from the yard.  It was an awful night.  Such a night as causes even reckless men to feel how helpless they are--how dependent on the arm of God.  The gale steadily increased until near midnight, when it blew a perfect hurricane.  \"It's a dirty night,\" observed the captain, to the second mate, as the latter came on deck to relieve the watch.  \"It is, sir,\" replied Mr Dicey, as coolly as if he were about to sit down to a good dinner on shore.  Mr Dicey was a remarkably matter-of-fact man.  He looked upon a storm as he looked upon a fit of the toothache--a thing that had to be endured, and was not worth making a fuss about.  \"It won't last long,\" said the captain.  \"No, sir; it won't,\" answered Mr Dicey.  As Mr Dicey did not seem inclined to say more, the captain went below and flung himself on a locker, having given orders that he should be called if any change for the worse took place in the weather.  Soon afterward a tremendous sea rose high over the stern, and part of it fell on the deck with a terrible crash, washing Mr Dicey into the lee-scuppers, and almost sweeping him overboard.  On regaining his feet, and his position beside the wheel, the second mate shook himself and considered whether he ought to call the captain.  Having meditated some time, he concluded that the weather was no worse, although it had treated him very roughly, so he did not disturb the captain's repose.  Thus the storm raged all that night.  It tossed the _Hope_ about like a cork; it well-nigh blew the sails off the masts, and almost blew Mr Dicey's head off his shoulders! then it stopped as it had begun-- suddenly.    CHAPTER THREE.  IN THE ICE--DANGERS OF ARCTIC VOYAGING.  Next morning the _Hope_ was becalmed in the midst of a scene more beautiful than the tongue or the pen of man can describe.  When the sun rose that day, it shone upon what appeared to be a field of glass and a city of crystal.  Every trace of the recent storm was gone except a long swell, which caused the brig to roll considerably, but which did not break the surface of the sea.  Ice was to be seen all round as far as the eye could reach.  Ice in every form and size imaginable.  And the wonderful thing about it was that many of the masses resembled the buildings of a city.  There were houses, and churches, and monuments, and spires, and ruins.  There were also islands and mountains!  Some of the pieces were low and flat, no bigger than a boat; others were tall, with jagged tops; some of the fields, as they are called, were a mile and more in extent, and there were a number of bergs, or ice-mountains, higher than the brig's topmasts.  These last were almost white, but they had, in many places, a greenish-blue colour that was soft and beautiful.  The whole scene shone and sparkled so brilliantly in the morning sun, that one could almost fancy it was one of the regions of fairyland!  When young Gregory came on the quarter-deck, no one was there except Jim Croft, a short, thick-set man, with the legs of a dwarf and the shoulders of a giant.  He stood at the helm, and although no steering was required, as there was no wind, he kept his hands on the spokes of the wheel, and glanced occasionally at the compass.  The first mate, who had the watch on deck, was up at the masthead, observing the state of the ice.  \"How glorious!\" exclaimed the youth, as he swept his sparkling eye round the horizon.  \"Ah, Croft! is not this splendid?\"  \"So it is, sir,\" said the seaman, turning the large quid of tobacco that bulged out his left cheek.  \"It's very beautiful, no doubt, but it's comin' rather thick for my taste.\"  \"How so?\" inquired Gregory.  \"There seems to me plenty of open water to enable us to steer clear of these masses.  Besides, as we have no wind, it matters little, I should think, whether we have room to sail or not.\"  \"You've not seed much o' the ice yet, that's plain,\" said Croft, \"else you'd know that the floes are closin' round us, an' we'll soon be fast in the pack, if a breeze don't spring up to help us.\"  As the reader may not, perhaps, understand the terms used by Arctic voyagers in regard to the ice in its various forms, it may be as well here to explain the meaning of those most commonly used.  When ice is seen floating in small detached pieces and scattered masses, it is called \"floe\" ice, and men speak of getting among the floes.  When these floes close up, so that the whole sea seems to be covered with them, and little water can be seen, it is called \"pack\" ice.  When the pack is squeezed together, so that lumps of it are forced up in the form of rugged mounds, these mounds are called \"hummocks.\"  A large mass of flat ice, varying from one mile to many miles in extent, is called a \"field,\" and a mountain of ice is called a \"berg.\"  All the ice here spoken of, except the berg, is sea-ice; formed by the freezing of the ocean in winter.  The berg is formed in a very different manner.  Of this more shall be said in a future chapter.  \"Well, my lad,\" said Gregory, in reply to Jim Croft's last observation, \"I have not seen much of the ice yet, as you truly remark, so I hope that the wind will not come to help us out of it for some time.  You don't think it dangerous to get into the pack, do you?\"  \"Well, not exactly dangerous, sir,\" replied Croft, \"but I must say that it aint safe, 'specially when there's a swell on like this.  But that'll go down soon.  D'ye "]]]
