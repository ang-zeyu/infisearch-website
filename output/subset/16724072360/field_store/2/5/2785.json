Yet, though he gazed in at the window, he saw Sergeants Hal and Noll out of the corners of his eyes. \"They are young, ambitious; they are enlisted men, therefore poor. Even in this short time these boys must have learned the craving for the things that money alone will buy. No man, in the Orient, can escape that knowledge and that longing for money. That is why it is so easy to buy men's souls here in the East. Shall I go up and speak to them? But no! There they go into a curio store where they will find much that they may wish to buy. I will follow my young _sergentes_ inside in five minutes--or ten. _Then_ they will be ripe for the man who talks money.\"   Hal and Noll had entered one of the most attractive little shops to be found anywhere along the Escolta. This store is kept by a Chinaman, who sells the more costly curios of the Far East. China's choicest silks are here displayed; also her finest teakwoods and curious boxes and cabinets of sandal and other valued woods, inlaid with pearl, or studded with rare jades. Here are wonderful creations carved out of ivory, idols of all kinds and sizes, of the highest grades of artistic workmanship. Here are wonderful beaded portieres and the most costly of curious Chinese garments for women. In a word, the bazaars of China are nobly represented on the Escolta. But there is much more besides. The most attractive curios from India, from Ceylon, the Malay Peninsula and of native Filipino workmanship are all to be found here. It is not the place to enter when one has not much money.  No wonder Sergeant Overton and Sergeant Terry moved from counter to counter, pricing and sighing. Each young Army boy wanted to send home something worth while to his mother. Yet how small a sergeant's pay seems in such a bazaar!  Hal Overton and Noll Terry need no introduction to the reader of the earlier volumes in this series. \"$1,\" as our readers are aware, details how Hal and Noll, reared in love of the Flag and respect for the military, determined, at the age of eighteen, to enlist in the Regular Army. Our readers followed the new recruits to the recruit rendezvous, where the young men received their first drillings in the art of being a soldier. From there they followed Hal and Noll westward, to Fort Clowdry, in the Colorado mountains, where the young soldiers went through their first thrilling experiences of the strenuous side of Army life, proving themselves, whether in barracks, on drill ground or under fire on a lonely sentry post, to be the sort of American youths of whom the best soldiers are made.  Readers of \"$1\" already know how Hal and Noll went several steps further in learning the work of the soldier; of their surprisingly good and highly adventurous work in practical problems of field life. In this volume was described field life and outpost duty, and scouting duty as well, as they are actually taught in the Army. In this volume is told also how Hal and Noll while out with a scouting party supplied their company with unexpected bear meat. Our readers, too, will remember the thrilling work of Hal and Noll, under Lieutenant Prescott, in capturing a desperate character badly wanted by the state authorities. These young soldiers were heroes of other absorbing adventures; their fine work eventually leading to their appointments as corporals.  In \"UNCLE SAM'S BOYS AS SERGEANTS\" our readers will recall a host of happenings that belong to military life, among them the stirring military tournament in which a battalion of \"Ours\" took part at Denver, and the all but tragic results of that tournament; the soldier hunting-party up in the Rockies, in which Hal and Noll thoroughly distinguished themselves both as hunters and as soldiers and commanders.  And now we find the entire Thirty-fourth Infantry in Manila, stationed there briefly pending details at other points in the islands.  As we look in upon Sergeants Overton and Terry to-day we find them two years older than when they first enlisted--but many years older in all the fine qualities that go to make up the best manhood.  Either young sergeant's word was as good as his bond in the Thirty-fourth. Truthful, ambitious, manly, thoroughly trained and capable of commanding; in a word, _men_ in character and abilities, while yet boys in years.  This much had two years of life in the United States Army done for Hal Overton and Noll Terry. Could other training have done more?  And these were the young Americans whom the alert-eyed, trailing Filipino dandy had already singled out and had planned to corrupt to his own purposes.  Yet the astute man of the world knows more than one way of ruining and disgracing simple-hearted, true-souled young fellows. Not even Satan is credited with appearing often in evil guise at first.  Perhaps this Filipino, a wicked fellow of long training, knew how to go about his work.  \"Going to buy anything, Noll?\" asked Hal at last, after the two young sergeants had made the round of the bewildering, attractive store.  \"I would, if I could find anything worth while that didn't take a sergeant's whole year's pay,\" sighed Terry.  \"Things are fearfully dear here, aren't they?\" murmured Overton. \"Yet I want to send something home as a remembrance to mother.\"  \"What do you fancy most?\" asked Noll.  \"If you haven't anything else on your mind, come around and I'll show you,\" Hal proposed.  Nodding, Noll accompanied his chum. Hal stopped to rest one hand lightly on a very wonderful little chest, made out of teak and sandal woods. It was richly, wonderfully carved, the darker teakwood being also inlaid with pearl. Inside were compartments and drawers, including two little secret drawers that the smiling Chinese salesman artfully opened and exposed to view.  \"One all same fo' _dinero_ (money), other fo' plecious stones, jewels, you _sabe_,\" cooed the yellow attendant.  \"It's a beauty and a wonder,\" murmured Hal. \"Mother'd be the proudest woman in town if I could send it home to her. How much did you say it cost?\"  \"Him tloo hundled pesos,\" stated the Chinaman gravely.  A _peso_ is the Spanish name for a Mexican dollar, worth about forty-seven cents; but two _pesos_ and an American dollar are reckoned as of the same value in Manila.  \"A hundred dollars gold! Why, that's the same price you asked me before,\" cried Hal in good-natured protest.  \"Yep, allee same; him plenty cheap.\"  \"It's too much,\" sighed Sergeant Hal. But the Chinaman, as though he had not heard, asked:  \"You likee? You buy?\"  \"I can't afford it at that price.\"  \"All light; come in some other day,\" invited the Chinaman politely, and glided over to where another possible customer was examining some handsome jade jewelry.  \"My _soldado_ (soldier) friend has not been long in Manila?\" inquired a low, pleasant, courteous voice behind the two young soldiers.  Hal wheeled. It was the Filipino dandy whom he confronted. That smiling, prosperous-looking native was employing his left hand to twist one end of the upturned moustache to a finer point.  \"No; we haven't been here long,\" Hal smiled. \"Three days, in fact.\"  \"And you do not yet know how to bargain with these sharp-witted _Chinos_ (Chinese)?\"  \"I'm afraid not,\" said Sergeant Overton.  \"May I ask, señor, what you wished to buy?\"  \"This box,\" Hal answered.  \"And how much did the _Chino_ want for it, if I may make bold enough to ask so much of the señor's business?\"  \"Why, he wants a hundred dollars in gold,\" Hal responded.  The Filipino dandy inspected the box critically.  \"You are right, señor; the price is too high. It is _muy caro_ (very dear), in fact. It could be bought for less, if you knew better how to deal with these smiling yellow heathen.\"  \"I'd be greatly obliged, then, if you would tell me how to put the bargain through.\"  \"You should get this rare and handsome box, señor, for ninety dollars, gold--even, perhaps, for not much more than eighty.\"  \"Even that would be a fearful price for me to pay,\" murmured Hal, shaking his head regretfully. \"I shall have to give up the idea, I guess.\"  \"Ah, but no!\" cried the Filipino, as though struck suddenly by an idea. \"Not if the señor will do me one very great favor!\"  \"What favor can I possibly do you?\" asked Sergeant Hal, regarding the little brown man with considerable astonishment.  \"Why, it is all very simple, señor. Simply let me feel that I have been permitted to do a courtesy to an _Americano_ to one of the race to which I owe so much. In a word, señor, I am not--as you may perhaps guess\"--here the Filipino swelled slightly with a pride that was plain--\"I am not exactly a poor man, not since the _Americanos_ came to these islands and gave us the blessings of liberty and just government. I have many business ventures, and one of them lies in my being a secret--no, what you _Americanos_ call a silent partner of the _Chino_ who conducts this store. Now the favor that I ask--señor, I beg you to let me present you with this handsome little box, that you may send it over the waters to your sweetheart.\"  \"Make me a present of it?\" demanded Sergeant Hal in amazement.  \"Ah, yes, exactly so, señor; and I shall be greatly honored by your very kind acceptance. And your friend--he shall select anything--valuable and handsome--that he would like for his sweetheart.\"  Neither young sergeant had a sweetheart outside of his mother. It was for their mothers that they sought suitable-priced curios. In their amazement, however, neither Hal nor Noll took the trouble to correct this smiling, polite stranger.  \"Thank you,\" said Overton promptly. \"We can't accept, of course, though it is very kind of you to make the offer--so very kind that it almost takes our breath away.\"  \"And why can you not accept?\" insisted the Filipino. He was still smiling, but there was now"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23447"],["title","Uncle Sam's Boys in the Philippines; or, Following the Flag against the Moros (#2)"],["body"," so insistent in his voice that Noll answered quickly:  \"Because we cannot accept gifts from strangers.\"  \"Ah, but you do not yet know the Orient. You must have things here; you must have money to spend, and feel the pleasure of spending it, or you will die.\"  \"Thank you,\" laughed Sergeant Hal, \"but at present my health is excellent. As for dying, that has no terror for the soldier.\"  \"Ah, yes, to die like a soldier!\" protested the Filipino, with a shrug of his shoulders. \"But would you die of sheer weariness and envy? There are pleasures in this country which only money will buy. Without the money, without these pleasures, life soon becomes bitter. You do not know, but I do, for I have watched thousands of your _Americano_ soldiers here. Now, I have money--too much! It is my whim to see that the _soldados_ enjoy themselves. I have begged many a soldier to honor me by letting me purchase him a little pleasure. Come, I will show you now! Wait! I will send for a carriage--not a _quilez,_ but a victoria. Say the word, give the consent, and I will show you at once what is called pleasure here in the East--in Manila.\"  Though he spoke in low tones, the Filipino made almost extravagant gestures. As he kept on he warmed up to his subject.  \"Shall I call a victoria?\" he asked.  \"If you wish,\" replied Sergeant Hal dryly.  \"Ah, that is the way I like to hear you say it!\" cried the little Filipino, and hastened toward the door.  He went away so rapidly, in fact, that he did not have time to note young Sergeant Overton's altered manner. From a feeling of embarrassment over having to repulse a stranger's ill-advised offer of generosity, Hal, his eyes watching the man's face, speedily took a dislike to the Filipino.  \"Come along, Noll,\" Overton whispered. \"We'll get out of this. I don't like the fellow.\"  \"You like him as well as I do,\" muttered Sergeant Terry.  At the door of the store they again caught sight of the dandy, who, with hand extended, was at that moment signaling a _cochero_ to drive his victoria in to the curb.  \"It could not have been better,\" cried the little brown tempter. \"Just as I came out I saw an empty victoria.\"  \"I congratulate you,\" smiled Sergeant Hal.  \"No, but this is the carriage, here,\" cried the Filipino, as Hal and Noll turned to walk down the Escolta.  \"Get in, then, and enjoy yourself,\" called back Hal.  In an instant the Filipino was in front of them, barring their way.  \"But you permitted me to stop a carriage,\" he protested, bewildered.  \"Exactly,\" nodded Hal, \"and we hope you will enjoy yourself. Step aside, please, for we want to pass on.\"  \"But you are not going with me, after----\"  \"Nothing was said about that,\" Hal answered, \"and we have other plans. Good-bye.\"  As the Filipino dandy once more tried to place himself in front of the young sergeant, Hal gently but firmly thrust the insistent fellow aside.  The Filipino stood glaring after them until the two Army boys were out of sight. The glint in his eyes was far from pleasant.  \"Now, what on earth did that fellow want of us?\" demanded Noll wonderingly.  \"Nothing good, anyway,\" returned Hal Overton. \"Intending benefactors don't act in that fashion. He may represent a bad phase of life out here. Let's forget him. Say, here's a store we must have overlooked on our way up here. Let's go in.\"  Half an hour later the Army boys came out of the store, each carrying a small parcel. For his first present home each young soldier had bought for his mother a small assortment of the wonderfully filmy _pina_ lace handkerchiefs made by the native women.  \"No _quilez_ around here for hire,\" said Hal, after looking up and down the Escolta. \"Let's walk across the bridge over the Pasig. We'll be more likely to find an idle _cochero_ on the other side of the river.\"  As they started the sky was darkening, and the lightning beginning to flash, for this was in early July, at the height of the rainy season.  \"I hope we find a _cochero_ soon,\" muttered Noll, looking up at the dark sky. \"I don't fancy the idea of walking all the way out to Malate in a downpour.\"  They were not quite over the bridge when the storm broke in all its force. Tropical thunder crashed with a fury that made artillery fire seem trifling. Great sheets of lightning flashed on all sides.  \"Hustle, before we get drowned,\" laughed Sergeant Hal, breaking into a fast run. \"There's shelter just beyond the end of the bridge.\"  The shelter for which both soldiers headed was a kiosk, barely larger than a sentry-box, that had once been erected for the convenience of the native boys who stood there with relief horses for the service of the old street car line.  The door stood open. Eager to make any port in a storm, Hal and Noll bolted inside just in time to hear an angry voice declare:  \"I had them picked out--two young _sergentes_, mere boys. At first they were very polite--a minute later they made fun of me to my face--me, Vicente Tomba! But I shall know them again, I shall see them, and I shall make them wish they had never been born. I----\"  The Filipino dandy stopped short as the two Army boys stepped briskly inside. He gave a gasp as he recognized them.  \"We meet again,\" remarked Hal dryly.  The dandy's companion, a big, florid-faced man of forty, in the usual immaculate white duck of the white man, eyed the boys keenly.     CHAPTER II  A MEETING AT THE NIPA BARRACKS   It was only for a moment.  Then, without answering Hal's remark, the Filipino clutched at the white man's arm, shoving him out into the rain. The native followed.  Just then a _cochero_ with an empty _quilez_ drove up. With instant presence of mind Vicente Tomba, as the dandy had called himself, held up his hand.  It was all done in an instant, and native and white friend were driving away through the gusts of rain.  \"Wonder who our friends are?\" Noll remarked curiously.  \"We know that one of them calls himself Vicente Tomba,\" replied Sergeant Hal.  \"But he spoke of having us picked out for something, and he seemed almost peevish because we didn't suit him,\" smiled Noll.  \"I can't imagine what it is,\" replied Hal, undisturbed. \"It couldn't be anything in the high treason line, anyway.\"  \"Why not even that?\" demanded Sergeant Noll.  \"Why, look here, old fellow, we're just two plain, kid, doughboy sergeants of the line. If that fellow had wanted anything in the treasonable variety, what sort of goods could we deliver him, anyway? Nothing, much, beyond our own arms and a copy of the company's roll.\"  \"Then what on earth was the fellow up to, anyway?\"  \"I don't know, Noll, and I don't much care. I've heard that there are sharks of all sorts here in Manila, ready to put up all sorts of games to get the easy-mark soldier's pay away from him. Probably Tomba and his friend belong in that class.\"  \"Pooh! Tomba has plenty of money,\" snorted Noll Terry. \"He wouldn't have to be out for a poor, buck-foot soldier's pay.\"  \"Swindlers sometimes do have plenty of money, for a while, until the law rounds them up and puts them where they ought to be,\" observed Sergeant Hal sagely. \"Let's forget the fellow, Noll, unless we see him again. Tomba is evidently up to something crooked, and we're not, so we haven't any real interest in him, have we?\"  \"Except to be on our guard,\" said Noll.  \"You speak as though you had some forebodings regarding Tomba, or Tomba and his friend,\" smiled Hal quizzically.  \"Well, then, I have,\" returned Noll Terry.  \"Not scared, are you?\"  \"That's a fine question to ask a soldier,\" sniffed Noll.  \"Well, I'm not going to waste any more thoughts on Tomba, or on his white-man companion, either. Whee! Look at that rain. It----\"  But a fearfully vivid flash of tropical lightning caused Sergeant Hal Overton to step further back into the little shed and close his eyes for an instant. Right after the flash came a prolonged, heavy roll of thunder that made the earth shake.  \"_Cochero, para!_\" shouted Noll right after that, and a fareless _quilez_ stopped near the door of the shed.  \"_Occupado_ (occupied)?\" called Noll.  \"No, señor.\"  Hal and Noll bolted through the rain, darted into the _quilez_ through the door at the rear, and plumped themselves down on the seats.  \"_Sigue directio, Malate, cuartel nipa,_\" ordered Hal, thus instructing the driver to go straight ahead to Malate and to take them to the nipa barracks.  The Filipino driver himself was drenched. In his thin cotton clothing the little brown man perched on the box outside, shivered until his teeth chattered. He did not propose, however, to let personal discomfort stop him from earning a fare.  Around the Walled City (Old Manila) the _quilez_ carried the young soldiers. These massive walls, centuries old, enclose perhaps a square mile of city. Once past the Walled City the little vehicle glided on through pretty Ermita. Here, passing along Calle Real (Royal Street), the driver turned into the straight stretch for the next suburb, Malate.  For months before sailing for the Philippines both young sergeants had devoted a good deal of their spare time to the study of Spanish. They had, however, learned the best Spanish of old Castile. First Sergeant Gray, who had put in three terms of service in the Philippines, had taken pains to teach them much of the local Spanish dialect as it is spoken in this far-away colony of Uncle Sam's.  To-day the Filipino children speak English rather well and musically, for English is the language of the public schools of the islands. Many of the older natives, however, even those with English-speaking children, know only a few words at most of the tongue of the _Americanos_.  By the time that the little cab turned in at the barracks grounds much of the fury of the storm had passed. The rain, however, continued at a steady downpour, and seemed good for the night.  \"We may have to be campaigning in this kind of weather in another fortnight,\" remarked Hal.  \"Fine business,\" commented Noll dryly.  \"Well, it all goes in the life of a soldier.
