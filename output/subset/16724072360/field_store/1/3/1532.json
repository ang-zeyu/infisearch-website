Wattrelot too had started up from the straw he had been lying on. We both exclaimed in one breath: \"Cannon!\" It was a mere distant growl, hardly audible, and yet it was distinct enough to be a subdued accompaniment to the thousand noises a train makes as it goes along. We could not distinguish the shots, but gradually the dull sound became louder and seemed to be wafted towards us by a gust of air. Then it seemed to be further off again, and almost to die away, and again to get louder. There is no other earthly sound like it. A thunderstorm as it dies away is the only thing that could suggest the impression we felt. It sends a kind of shiver all over the surface of the body. Even our horses felt it. Their three heads were raised uneasily, their eyes shone in the twilight, and they snorted noisily through their dilated nostrils.  Leaning out, I saw the heads of the Territorials thrust out of the windows. They, too, had heard the mysterious and stirring music. No one spoke or joked. Their bodies, stretching out into space, seemed to be asking questions and imploring to know the truth. We came nearer to the sounds of the guns and could now distinguish the shots following one another at short intervals. The air seemed to be shaken, and we might have thought we were but a few paces off.  The train had pulled up sharply in the open country. It was still light enough for us to make out the landscape--meadows covered with long pale grass, bordered by willows and tall poplar trees gently swaying in the evening breeze. In the background a thick wood shut in the view. The railway line curved away to the right and was lost to view in the growing darkness. Now that the train was motionless the impressive voice of the cannon could be heard more distinctly. The long luminous trails of the search-lights passed over the sky at intervals.  Impatient at the delay, I got down and walked along the line to the engine. It had stopped at a level crossing. At the side of the closed barrier, on the doorstep of her hut, with the light shining upon her, sat the wife of the gatekeeper, a child in her arms. She was a young woman, fair and pale. She seemed somewhat uneasy, and yet had no idea of quitting her post. She was talking in a low voice to the engine driver and stoker of our train. I tried to get some information from her. \"_Mon Dieu, monsieur_,\" she said, \"I know nothing, except that the guns have been firing all day long since yesterday, and even at times during the night. The sound comes chiefly from the direction of G. Some soldiers, who went by just now with carts, told me the Prussians got into the town yesterday, but that it was to be retaken to-day; and that there were a great many dead and wounded.\"  My hopes revived a little. I saw at once in my mind the German attack stopped on the river Oise, our armies recovering, drawing together and driving the enemy back across the frontier. Our engine-driver explained to me that we had come quite close to the terminus, but that we should have to wait some time before we could get in. Other trains had to be unloaded and shunted to make room.  I went back to my van. Night had fallen, and it must have been about nine o'clock. The guns had suddenly ceased firing. Our lantern had burnt itself out, and the rest of our wait was made more tedious by darkness. An empty train passed us, and then silence fell once more upon the spot where we waited anxiously to be allowed to go forward towards our brothers-in-arms. Oh! how I longed to join them, even if it were only in the middle of a bloody and difficult retreat; how I longed to be delivered from my solitude!  At last, at about eleven o'clock, the train set off again without whistling, and very slowly. It went along timidly, so to speak, and as though it was afraid of coming into some unknown region which might be full of mysteries and ambuscades. In the distance I saw some signal lamps waved, and suddenly we stopped. What I then saw astounded me. I had thought we should draw up at a large platform where gangs of men would be waiting, in perfect order, to unload the train, sort out the packages, and pile them up in their appointed places for the carts to take them quietly away.  Instead of this the train stopped at some little distance from a small station standing by itself in the open country. I could make out some buildings, badly lighted, and around them a crowd of shadowy forms moving about. And drawn up alongside of our train were countless vehicles of all sorts and kinds in indescribable disorder, made all the more confusing by the darkness. Some of them were drawn up in some sort of a line. Others tried to edge themselves in and get a vacant place among the entanglement of wheels and horses. The drivers were abusing each other in forcible language. Every now and again there was an outburst of laughter interspersed with oaths.  All this time officials were running down the platform with papers in their hands, trying to read what was chalked on the vans. Enquiries and shouts were heard:  \"Where is the bread?\"  \"Over here.\"  \"No, it's not.\"  \"Where is the officer in charge?\"  Matches were struck. The few lighted lanterns there were were snatched from one hand by another. And in spite of all this apparent disorder the work went rapidly forward. Men climbed in through the open doors. Sacks and heavy cases were passed along. Porters, bending under their loads, slipped through the maze of vans and carts to the one they wanted and deposited their burdens.  After giving Wattrelot orders to prevent any one from invading our horse-box I slipped out and went towards the station office to look for the military commissary. I had great difficulty in making my way through the crowd of men who seemed to be rushing to take the train by assault in the darkness. Then I had to avoid breaking my neck in getting across the maze of rails, the signal wires, and the open ditches.  I got to the station. A number of wounded were there lying on the platforms; about a hundred of them, with their clothes torn, and covered with dust. They presented a sad picture. They were, it is true, only slightly wounded; but it cuts one to the heart to see soldiers in that plight, hauled out upon the ground without straw to lie upon or any doctor to attend to them. However, they had all had first-aid dressings. Below the bandages that bound their heads their feverish eyes gleamed in the light of the lanterns. Their bandaged arms were supported by pieces of linen tied behind their necks. Several of them were sitting on baskets, casks and packages of all kinds, and they were talking eagerly. Each man was relating, with plenty of gesticulation, the great deeds he had taken part in or seen. As I passed, I heard scraps of their conversation: \"They were in the first line of houses.... Then, old chap, our lieutenant rushed forward.... You should have seen them scuttle....\"  I was delighted to see that the _moral_ of those fine fellows didn't seem in the least affected. To hear them you would have thought the Germans had been driven back at all points.  I got a porter to tell me where the military commissary was. He pointed out an Artillery lieutenant, in a cap with a white band, talking to a group of officers. I introduced myself, and asked him if he knew anything about the state of affairs. Like everybody else, he could only give me very vague information. \"However,\" he added, \"I can confirm what you have heard about G. The First Corps has just retaken the town, which was defended by the Prussian Guard. It appears that our fellows were wonderful, and that the enemy has suffered enormous losses. However\"--the lieutenant's voice trembled slightly, and the shrug of his shoulders betrayed his despair--\"I have orders to evacuate the station, with all my men and my papers, so soon as the last train has been unloaded. I am to fall back towards L. How is one to understand what all this means?\"  We looked at each other, without a word. Everybody felt dejected and doubtful. Not to understand!... To have to obey without understanding why! It was the first time I had really felt the grandeur of military service. You must have a soul stoutly tempered to carry out an order--no matter what, even if that order seems incomprehensible to you. There must have been in that corner of France, on the edge of that frontier which we had sworn should never be violated--there must have been thousands of officers, thousands of soldiers who would have given their lives rather than yield up one inch of ground. Then why abandon that station? Why say so bluntly, \"To-morrow you will have no need to go so far north to bring supplies. We shall come nearer to you; _we_ shall withdraw ...\"?  There I was again, allowing my mind to wander and to suffer. I tried to learn by what means I could get some information about my regiment.  \"Well, it's very simple,\" said the Artillery lieutenant, very kindly. \"Your commissariat officer will certainly have to come with his convoy to fetch supplies. Try to get hold of him. He will tell you all about it.\"  I grasped his hand and went off, glad indeed at the thought of seeing my regiment's uniform once more. And Providence seemed to guide me, for I thought I saw the very man I was looking for in the little booking office. But I had some difficulty in recognising him. He looked aged and worn. His beard had grown quite grey. Bending over the sill of the ticket office, he was in the act of spreading the contents of a box of sardines upon a slice of bread. Yes, it was he. How tired and disheartened he looked! I pushed the door open and rushed in:  \"_Bonjour! Comment va?_\"  \"Ah!... It's you! What have you come here for, my poor fellow? Ah! Things aren't looking very rosy....\"  I plied him with questions, and he answered in short incoherent sentences:  \"Charleroi? Don't talk of it!... Our men? Grand!... A hecatomb....

He sat down on the edge of his cot and, hurriedly looking through the index, opened the book at page thirty. He was breathing so hard that he almost gulped, and his thin little hands trembled visibly....     CHAPTER III  THE \"ALL BUT\" SCOUT   In that same hour, perhaps a little earlier or later, I cannot say, Tom Slade, having finished his duties for the day, strolled along the lake shore away from camp and struck into the woods which extended northward as far as the Dansville road.  He had no notion of where he was going; he was going nowhere in particular. For aught I know he was going to ponder on the responsibility which had been thrust upon him by the scout powers that be, of judging stalking photographs preliminary to awarding the Audubon prize offered by the historical society in his home town. Perhaps he was under the influence of a little pensive regret that the season was coming to an end and wished to have this lonely parting with his beloved hills and trees. It is of no consequence. About all he actually did was to kick a stick along before him and pause now and again to examine the caked green moss on trees.  When he had reached a little eminence whence the view behind him was unobstructed, he turned and looked down upon the camp. Perhaps in that brief glimpse the whole panorama of his adventurous life spread before him in his mind's eye, and he saw the vicious little hoodlum that he had once been transformed into a scout, pass through the several ranks of scouting, grow up, go to war, and come back to be assistant at the camp where he had spent so many happy hours when he was a young boy.  And now there was not one thing down there, nor shack nor cabin nor shooting range nor boat nor canoe, nor hero's elm (as they called it), nor Gold Cross Rock, which had the same romantic interest as had this young fellow to the scouts who came in droves and watched him and listened to the talk about him and dreamed of being just such a real scout as he. He moved about unconsciously among them, simple, childlike, stolid, but with a kind of assurance and serenity which he may have learned from the woods.  He was singularly oblivious to the superficial appurtenances of scouting. He had passed through that stage. The pomp and vanity of the tenderfoot he knew not. The bespangled dignity of the second-class and first-class scout, these things he had known and outgrown. His medals were home somewhere. And out of all this alluring rigmarole and romantic glory were left the deeper marks of scout training, burned into his soul as the mark is burned into the skin of a broncho. The woods, the trees, were his. That, after all, is the highest award in scouting. It is a medal that one does not lose, and it lasts forever.  As Tom Slade stood there looking down upon the camp, one might have seen in him the last and fullest accomplishment of scouting, stripped of all else. His face was the color of a mulatto. He wore no scout hat, he wore no hat at all. It would have been quite superfluous for him to have worn any of his thirty or forty merit badges of fond memory on his sleeves, for his sleeves were rolled up to his shoulders. He wore a pongee shirt, this being a sort of compromise between a shirt and nothing at all. He wore moccasins, but not Indian moccasins. He was still partial to khaki trousers, and these were worn with a strange contraption for a belt; it was a kind of braided fiber of his own manufacture, the material of which was said to have been taken from a string tree.  As he resumed his way through the woods he presently heard a cheery, but rather exhausted, voice behind him.  \"Have a heart, Slady, and wait a minute, will you?\" Tom's pursuer called. \"I'm nearly dead climbing up through all this jungle after you. Old Mother Nature's got herself into a fine mess of a tangle through here, hey? Don't mind if I come along with you, do you? Look down there, hey? Pavilion looks nice. I've been wondering if I stand any chance of being called up on that platform on Saturday night. Looks swell with all the bunting over it, doesn't it?\"  The speaker, who had been half talking and half shouting, now came stumbling and panting up over the edge of the wooded decline where the thick brush had played havoc with his scout suit but not with his temper.  \"Some climb, hey?\" he breathed, laughing, and affecting the stagger of utter exhaustion. \"I bet you knew an easier way up. The bunch told me not to beard the lion in his den, but I'm not afraid of lions. Here I am and you can't get rid of me now. I'm up against it, Slady, and I want a few tips. They say you're the only real scout since Kit Carson. What I'm hunting for is a wild animal, but I haven't been able to find anything except a cricket, two beetles and a cow that belongs on the Hasbrook farm. Don't mind if I stroll along with you a little way, do you? My name is Willetts--Hervey Willetts. I'm with that troop from Massachusetts. I'm an Eagle Scout--_all but_.\"  \"But's a pretty big word,\" Tom said.  \"You said it,\" Hervey Willetts said, still wrestling with his breath; \"it's the biggest word in the dictionary.\"     CHAPTER IV  HERVEY LEARNS SOMETHING   They strolled on through the woods together, the younger boy's gayety and enthusiasm showing in pleasing contrast to Tom's stolid manner.  He was a wholesome, vivacious boy, this Willetts, with a breeziness which seemed to captivate even his sober companion, and if Tom had felt any slight annoyance at being thus overhauled by a comparative stranger, the feeling quickly passed in the young scout's cheery company.  \"They told me down in camp that if I need a guide, philosopher, and friend, I'd better run you down, or up----\"  \"If you'd gone a little to the left you'd have found it easier,\" Tom said, in his usual matter-of-fact manner.  \"Oh, I suppose you know all the highways and byways and right ways and left ways and every which ways for miles and miles around,\" Hervey Willetts said. \"I guess they were right when they said you'd be a good guide, philosopher, and friend, hey?\"  \"I don't know what a philosopher is,\" Tom said, with characteristic blunt honesty, \"but I know all the trails around here, if that's what you're talking about.\"  \"Oh, you mean about guides?\" Hervey asked, just a trifle puzzled. \"That's an expression, _guide, philosopher, and friend_. It comes from Shakespeare or one of those old ginks; it means a kind of a moral guide, I suppose.\"  \"Oh,\" said Tom.  \"But I need, I need, I need, I need a friend,\" Hervey said.  \"You seem to have lots of friends down there,\" Tom said.  \"A scout is observant, hey?\" Willetts laughed.  \"I mean you always seem to have a lot of fellows with you,\" Tom said, ignoring the compliment. \"Everybody likes your troop, that's sure. And your troop seems to be stuck on _you_.\"  \"_Good night!_\" Hervey laughed. \"They won't be stuck on me after Saturday. That'll be the end of my glorious career.\"  \"What did you do?\" Tom asked, after his customary fashion of construing talk literally.  \"Oh, I didn't exactly commit a murder,\" the other laughed, \"but I fell down, Sla--you don't mind my calling you Slady, do you?\"  \"That's what most everybody calls me,\" Tom said, \"except the troop I was in. They call me Tomasso.\"  \"Sounds like tomato, hey?\" Hervey laughed. \"No, my troubles are about merit badges. I've bungled the whole thing up. When a fellow goes after the Eagle award, he ought to have a manager, that's what I say. He ought to have a manager to plan things out for him. I tried to manage my own campaign and now I'm stuck--with a capital S.\"  \"How many merits have you got?\" Tom asked him.  \"Twenty,\" Hervey said, \"twenty and two-thirds. Just a fraction more and I'd have gone over the top.\"  \"You mean a sub-division?\" Tom asked.  \"That's where the little _but_ comes in,\" Hervey said. \"B-u-t, but. It's a big word, all right, just as you said.\"  \"Is it architecture or cooking or interpreting or one of those?\" Tom asked.  Hervey glanced at Tom in frank surprise.  \"Maybe it's leather work, or machinery, or taxidermy or marksmanship,\" Tom continued, with no thought further from his mind than that of showing off.  \"Guess again,\" Hervey laughed.  \"Then it must be either music or stalking,\" Tom said, dully.  His companion paused in his steps, contemplating Tom with unconcealed amazement. \"Right-o,\" he said; \"it's stalking. What are you? A mind reader?\"  \"Those are the only ones that have three tests,\" Tom said. \"So if you have twenty merits and two-thirds of a merit, why, you must be trying for one of those. Maybe they've changed it since I looked at the handbook.\"  Hervey Willetts stood just where he had stopped, looking at Tom with admiration. In his astonishment he glanced at Tom's arm as if he expected to see upon it the tangible evidences of his companion's feats and accomplishments. But the only signs of scouting which he saw there were the brown skin and the firm muscles.  \"They change that book every now and then,\" Tom said.  Still Hervey continued to look. \"What's that belt made out of?\" he asked.  \"It's fiber from a string tree,\" Tom said; \"they grow in Lorraine in France.\"  \"Were you in France?\"  \"Two years,\" Tom said.  \"How many merit badges have you got, anyway, Mr.--Slady?\"  \"Oh, I don't know,\" Tom said; \"about thirty or thirty-five, I guess.\"  \"You _guess?_ I bet you've got the Gold Cross. Where is it?\" Hervey made a quick inspection of Tom's pongee shirt, but all he saw there was the front with buttons gone and the brown chest showing.  \"I couldn't pin it on there very well, could I?\" Tom said, lured by his companion's eagerness into a little show of amusement.  \"Where is it?\" Hervey demanded.  \"I'm letting a girl wear it,\" Tom said.  \"Oh, what I know about _you!_\" Hervey said, teasingly. \"You can bet if I ever get the Gold Cross or the Eagle Badge (which I won't this trip) no girl will ever wear them.\"  \"You can't be so sure about that,\" "]]]
