As her family grew bigger, Henrietta Hen took them on longer strolls, always casting a careful eye aloft now and then, lest some hawk should swoop down upon her darlings. And though no hawk tried to surprise her, something happened one day that gave Henrietta almost as great a fright as any cruel hawk could have caused her.  They had strayed down by the duck-pond--had Henrietta and her children, stopping here and there to scratch for some tidbit, or to flutter in an inviting dust-heap. Once they had reached the bank of the pond Henrietta began to wish she hadn't brought her family in that direction. For one of the youngsters--the one that never would hurry in out of the rain--insisted on toddling down to the water's edge.  \"Come away this instant!\" Henrietta shrieked, as soon as she noticed where he was. \"You'll get your feet wet the first thing you know.\"  She never said anything truer than that. The words were scarcely out of her bill when the odd member of her family flung himself into the water. Or to be more exact, he flung himself _upon_ it; for he floated on the surface as easily as a chip and began to paddle about as if he had swum all his life.  \"Come back! Come back!\" Henrietta Hen shrieked. \"You'll be drowned--and you'll get your feet wet!\"     IV  A SWIMMER   Henrietta Hen ran as fast as she could down the bank and stood as near the water as she dared, cackling loudly and flapping her wings.  Her child, who was swimming in the duck-pond, seemed to have no intention of minding her. Nor did he seem to have any intention of drowning; and as for getting his feet wet, he acted as if he liked _that_.  \"What shall I do? Oh, what shall I do?\" Henrietta Hen squawked. She made so much noise that some of her neighbors came a-running, to see what was the matter. And as soon as they discovered what had happened they began to laugh.  \"We may as well tell you,\" they said to Henrietta Hen, \"that that chap out there is a duckling. The water won't hurt him.\"  Henrietta Hen gasped and gaped. She was astonished. But she soon pulled herself together. And it was just like her to begin to boast.  \"See!\" she cried to her friends, and waved a wing toward the water with an air of pride. \"There isn't one of you that has a child that can beat him swimming.\"  \"I should hope not!\" said Polly Plymouth Rock with a shrug of her fine shoulders. And all the others agreed that they wanted no swimmers in their families.  Henrietta Hen announced that she was sorry for them. \"Every brood,\" she declared, \"should have at least one swimmer in it.\" She began to strut up and down the edge of the duck-pond, clucking in a most overbearing fashion. Really, she had never felt quite so important before--not even when her first brood pecked their way out of their shells.  \"There's nothing quite like swimming,\" Henrietta Hen remarked with a silly smirk. \"If it weren't for getting my feet wet I'd be tempted to learn myself. No doubt my son could teach me.\"  \"Your son!\" the old white hen sniffed. \"He's not your son, Henrietta Hen. Somebody played a joke on you. Somebody put a duck's egg under you while you were hatching your eggs. And I think I can guess who it was that did it.\"  For just a moment Henrietta Hen stood still. The news almost took her breath away. Her comb trembled on the top of her head. She even stopped clucking. And she looked from one to another of her companions as if in hopes of finding one face, at least, that looked doubtful.... Alas! Everybody appeared to agree with old Whitey.  \"If this is so,\" Henrietta muttered at last, \"it's strange nobody ever noticed before that there was a duckling in my brood.\"  \"We knew from the very first!\" Polly Plymouth Rock told her. \"You were the only one on the farm that didn't see that one of your family was different from the rest.\"  All this time the young duckling was swimming further and further away. He seemed to have forgotten all about his foster mother.  Henrietta Hen took one long last look at him. She guessed that she might have stood there forever cackling for him to come back and he wouldn't have paid the slightest heed to her.  Then she gathered her children--her really own--about her. \"Come!\" she said to them, \"We'll go back home now.\"  \"What about him?\" they demanded, pointing to the truant duckling who was bobbing about on the rippling water. \"Aren't you going to make him come, too?\"  \"No!\" said their mother. \"We're well rid of him. He has been more trouble to me than all the rest of you.... To tell the truth, I never liked him very well.\"     V  CAUGHT BY MR. CROW   It wasn't far to the edge of the cornfield from the farmyard fence. And Henrietta Hen was quick to discover that the freshly ploughed and harrowed field offered a fine place to scratch for all kinds of worms and bugs and grubs.  Not being what you might call a wise bird--like old Mr. Crow--Henrietta didn't know that Farmer Green had carefully planted corn in that field, in long rows. She did exclaim, however, that she was in great luck when now and then she unearthed a few kernels of corn. But she wasn't _looking_ for corn. She merely ate it when she happened to find any.  It is no wonder, then, that she was amazed when a hoarse voice suddenly cried right in her ear, almost, \"You're a thief and you can't deny it!\"  She jumped. How could she have helped it? And the voice exclaimed, \"There! You're guilty or you'd never have jumped like that.\"  Turning, Henrietta saw that a black, beady-eyed gentleman was staring at her sternly.  \"It takes Mr. Crow to catch 'em,\" he croaked. \"He can tell a corn-thief half a mile away.\"  All this time Henrietta Hen hadn't said a word. At first she was too surprised. And afterward she was too angry.  \"Why don't you speak?\" he demanded. He dearly loved a quarrel. And somehow it wasn't much fun quarrelling with anybody when the other party wouldn't say a word.  Still Henrietta Hen didn't open her mouth. She puzzled Mr. Crow. He even forgot his rage (for it always made him angry if anybody but himself scratched up any corn).  \"What's the matter with you?\" he asked. \"What's the reason you don't speak?\"  \"I'm too proud to talk with you,\" said Henrietta Hen. \"I don't care to be seen speaking to you, sir.\"  \"Ha!\" Mr. Crow exploded. \"Don't you think I'm as good as you are?\"  \"No!\" said Henrietta Hen. \"No, I don't!\"  Mr. Crow was all for arguing with her. He began to tell Henrietta many things about himself, how he had spent dozens of summers in Pleasant Valley, what a great traveller he was, how far he could fly in a day. There was no end to his boasting.  Yet Henrietta Hen never looked the least bit interested. Indeed, she began scratching for worms while he was talking. And that made the old fellow angrier than ever.  \"Don't you dare eat another kernel of corn!\" he thundered. \"If you do, I'll have to tell Farmer Green.\"  \"He feeds me corn every day--cracked corn!\" said Henrietta.  \"Well, I never!\" cried Mr. Crow. \"What's he thinking of, wasting good corn like that?\"  \"Really, I mustn't be seen talking with you,\" Henrietta Hen told Mr. Crow. \"If you want to know the answer to your question, come over to the barnyard and ask the Rooster. He'll give you an answer that you won't like.\"  And then she walked away with stately steps.  Mr. Crow watched her with a baleful gleam in his eyes. He knew well enough what Henrietta meant. The Rooster would rather fight him than not. And though Mr. Crow loved a quarrel, he never cared to indulge in anything more dangerous than harsh words.  \"I don't know what the farm's coming to,\" he croaked. \"Here's Farmer Green wasting corn on such as her--and cracking it for her, too!\"  So saying, the old gentleman turned his back on Henrietta Hen, who was already fluttering through the farmyard fence. And thereupon he scratched up enough corn for a hearty meal, grumbling meanwhile because it wasn't cracked for him.  \"Somehow,\" he muttered, \"I can't help wishing I was a speckled hen.\"     VI  HENRIETTA COMPLAINS   There was another member of Farmer Green's flock, besides Henrietta Hen, that was proud. Nobody needed to look twice at the Rooster to tell that he had an excellent opinion of himself. He had a way of walking about the farmyard that said quite plainly that he believed himself to be a person of great importance. And it was true that things went according to his ideas, among the flock.  He was always spoken of as \"the Rooster.\" For although there were other roosters in the flock, they were both younger and smaller than he, and he would never permit anybody to call them--in his hearing--anything but cockerels.  These cockerels usually took great pains to keep out of the Rooster's way. If they were careless, and he caught them napping, he was more than likely to make matters unpleasant for them. He knew how to make their feathers fly.  Now, Henrietta Hen thought that the Rooster behaved in a most silly fashion. She said it pained her to see him prancing about, with his two long, arched tail-feathers nodding as he walked. The truth was, Henrietta could not endure it to have any one more elegantly dressed than she. And there was no denying that the Rooster's finery outshone everybody else's. Why, he wore a comb on his head that was even bigger than Henrietta's! And he had spurs, too, for his legs.  But what Henrietta Hen disliked most about the Rooster was the way he crowed each morning. It wasn't so much the _kind_ of crowing that he indulged in; it was rather the early hour he chose for it that annoyed Henrietta. He always began his _Cockle-doodle-doo_ while it was yet dark. Then everybody in the henhouse had to wake up, whether he wanted to or not. And Henrietta Hen did wish the Rooster would keep still at least till daylight came. She often remarked that it was perfectly ridiculous for any one from a fine family--as she was--to get up at such an unearthly hour. She said it was a "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18652"],["title","The Tale of Henrietta Hen (#2)"],["body","she kept her good looks, just on account of the Rooster's crowing.  \"Why don't you ask him to wait until it's light, before he begins to crow?\" Polly Plymouth Rock asked Henrietta one day.  \"I'll do it!\" cried Henrietta. Right then she called to one of the cockerels, who was near-by. \"Just skip across the yard and ask the Rooster--\" she began.  The cockerel broke right in upon her message.  \"Oh! I can't do that!\" he exclaimed. \"I've never gone up to the Rooster and spoken to him. If I did, he'd be sure to fight me.\"  \"Just tell him that I sent you,\" said Henrietta. And she made the cockerel listen to her message. But he wouldn't be persuaded. He told Henrietta that the Rooster would be sure to jump at him the moment he opened his mouth. \"Besides,\" he added, \"it wouldn't do any good, anyhow. The Rooster can't wait until after daylight, before he begins to crow.\"  \"He can't, eh?\" Henrietta Hen spoke up somewhat sharply. \"I'd like to know the reason why!\" And fixing her gaze sternly upon the Rooster, she marched straight across the farmyard towards him, to find out.     VII  WARNING THE ROOSTER   \"Good Afternoon!\" Henrietta Hen greeted the Rooster. He had not seen her as she walked towards him. And when she spoke he hastily arranged his two long tail-feathers in what he considered a more becoming droop.  \"Good afternoon, madam!\" he answered--for the Rooster prided himself that he was always polite to the ladies. \"Er--there's nothing wrong, I hope,\" he added quickly as he noticed an odd gleam in Henrietta Hen's eye.  \"Yes--there is,\" she said. The cockerels might fear the Rooster, but Henrietta certainly didn't. She considered him a good deal of a braggart. Indeed, she even had an idea that she could have whipped him herself, had she cared to be so unladylike as to fight. \"I've been bothered for a long time because you crow so early in the morning. You make such a racket that you wake me up every day.\"  The Booster hemmed and hawed. Somehow he felt uncomfortable.  \"That's unfortunate,\" he stammered. And then he had a happy thought. \"Anyhow,\" he continued, with a smile at Henrietta, \"you don't look as if you lacked for sleep, madam. You grow more beautiful every day.\"  Henrietta Hen admitted that it was so. \"But,\" she said, \"I believe I'd be even handsomer if I weren't disturbed so early. I don't like to get up while it's dark. So I'm going to ask you to delay your crowing, from now on, until after sunrise.\"  \"Impossible!\" cried the Rooster. \"I'm sorry to disoblige you, madam. But what you ask can't be done.\"  \"That's just what the cockerel said!\" Henrietta Hen exclaimed.  \"The cockerel!\" the Rooster echoed angrily. \"Which one? Has one of those upstarts been talking about me? Point him out to me and I'll soon teach him a lesson.\"  Henrietta Hen said that she hadn't noticed which cockerel it was. Somehow they all looked alike to her.  \"Good!\" the Rooster cried. \"Then I'll have to whip them all, to make sure of punishing the guilty one.\" He looked very fierce.  \"Don't be absurd!\" Henrietta told him. \"I asked one of the cockerels to give you a message about not crowing so early. And he declined. He said it wouldn't do any good.\"  \"It wouldn't have done _him_ any good,\" the Rooster declared, stamping a foot and thrusting his bill far forward, to show Henrietta Hen how brave he was.  \"What's the matter?\" she inquired. \"Have you eaten something that disagrees with you?\"  The Rooster couldn't help looking foolish. Henrietta Hen believed in letting him know that she stood in no awe of him. And while he was feeling ill at ease she hastened to tell him that hereafter he must _hold onto_ his first crow until after sunrise.  \"I can't do that,\" he told her again, unhappily.  \"Don't you dare let go of it!\" she warned him. \"If that first crow gets away from you while it's dark, there'll be so many others to follow it that I shan't be able to close an eye for even a cat-nap.\"     VIII  WHY THE ROOSTER CROWED   Henrietta Hen had commanded the Rooster to wait until daylight before he began to crow.  He saw that she had made up her mind that he must obey her. But he knew he couldn't. And he always took great pains to be polite to the ladies.  It was a wonder the Rooster didn't turn red in the face. He had never found himself in such a corner before.  \"You don't understand,\" he blurted. \"I'd be delighted to oblige you, but if I didn't crow until after the sun rose I'd never crow again.\"  \"We could stand that,\" was Henrietta Hen's grim reply.  \"Perhaps!\" he admitted--for she made him feel strangely humble. \"But could you stand it if the night lasted forever?\"  \"You're talking nonsense now,\" she declared.  \"You don't understand,\" he told her again. \"And I must say I'm surprised, madam, that you didn't know it was I that waked the sun up every morning. _That's_ why I crow so early.\"  Henrietta Hen was so astonished that she didn't know what to say. She thought deeply for a time--or as deeply as she could.  \"Have you not noticed,\" the Rooster inquired, \"that the sun never rises until I've crowed loudly a good many times?\"  \"No! No--I haven't,\" Henrietta murmured. \"But now that you speak of it, I see that it's so.\"  \"Exactly!\" he said. \"And often, madam, I have to crow a long time before he peeps over Blue Mountain. It's lucky I have a good, strong voice,\" the Rooster, added with a smirk, for he was feeling more at his ease. \"If I had a thin, squeaky crow such as those worthless cockerels have, Farmer Green would have had to do many a day's work in the dark.\"  \"Goodness!\" Henrietta Hen gasped. \"Do crow your loudest the moment you wake up, Mr. Rooster! Do make all the noise you can!\" And he promised faithfully that he would.  Henrietta left him then. Somehow she couldn't get their talk out of her mind. And soon she had an unhappy thought. What if anything should happen to the Rooster's voice?  The moment that question popped into her head, Henrietta Hen hurried back to the Rooster.  \"Do be careful!\" she besought him. \"Don't get your feet wet! For if you caught cold you might be so hoarse that you couldn't speak above a whisper.\"  The Rooster thanked her politely for thinking of his health.  \"I always take good care of myself,\" he assured her.  \"It looks like rain this minute,\" she said as she cast an anxious glance at the sky. \"Hadn't you better run into the barn?\"  He thought otherwise--and said as much.  \"You ought to wear rubbers every day,\" she chided him, as she went away again.  Soon Henrietta returned once more to urge the Rooster to carry an umbrella. And it wasn't long after that when she came bustling up to him and informed him that a warm muffler about his throat wouldn't be amiss.  There seemed to be no end to her suggestions. And though at first the Rooster had liked to hear them (without having any idea of following them) after a time Henrietta's attentions began to annoy him.  \"Great cracked corn!\" he exclaimed. \"This Henrietta Hen is getting to be a pest.\"     IX  HAUGHTY HENRIETTA   Feeling as important as she did, Henrietta Hen liked to have her own way. She said that she couldn't be expected to do just as others wished.  \"I'll take orders from nobody,\" she often declared. \"And if I lay eggs for Farmer Green I shall lay them when and where I please.\"  Henrietta took special delight in laying her eggs in out-of-the-way places. She was never content to lay two in the same nest.  \"If they left them for me perhaps I'd feel differently,\" she explained to her neighbors. \"But Johnnie Green gathers every egg that he can find. And if he takes my eggs I'll make him hunt for them, anyhow.\"  The older, more staid hens shook their heads when Henrietta talked like that. They told her she was ungrateful.  \"Farmer Green gives you a snug home and plenty of food,\" they reminded her. \"And the least you can do is to repay him. You ought not to make trouble by hiding your eggs.\"  But Henrietta Hen couldn't--or wouldn't--agree with them.  \"It's all very well for you to talk,\" she retorted. \"If my eggs were undersized I shouldn't mind losing them as fast as I laid them. But I lay the biggest and finest eggs to be had. So it's only natural that I should like to have at least _one_ around to look at--and to show to callers.\"  Now, there were plenty of other hens in the flock that laid eggs exactly as big--or even bigger--than Henrietta Hen's. Some of them told her as much. Yet it did them no good to talk to her. She wouldn't believe that there were any eggs in the world to compare with hers. So her neighbors learned after a while that they might as well let Henrietta Hen manage her affairs as she pleased. They couldn't help hoping, however, that somehow Farmer Green would find a way to outwit her.  \"What can Henrietta Hen be so boastful about now?\" the hens asked one another one day. \"She acts as if she thought more highly of herself than ever.\"  They soon discovered the reason for Henrietta's unusually pompous manner. For she began to make calls on all her friends. And she invited everybody to come to her latest nest high up in the haymow.  \"I've something there to show you,\" she said with an air of mystery. \"You'll be surprised to see it.\"  Most of Henrietta's neighbors did not show any great curiosity to see the surprise. They smiled at one another. \"She's laid another egg--that's all!\" they whispered.  But there are always some that can't rest until they know everybody else's business. And it was lucky that Henrietta Hen hurried home to receive her callers, because she had a good many. They came even earlier in the afternoon than was strictly fashionable. And they came in a crowd, too. That, however, didn't bother Henrietta Hen. Nor could they have arrived too soon to suit her.  \"Look!\" she cried, when they reached her nest high up in the haymow. \"Did you ever see anything to beat that?\"     X  THE BIG, WHITE EGG   When Henrietta Hen's callers crowded about her nest in the haymow they expected to see something wonderful. But when they "]]]
