I just wanted to sound you and find out if you were game or whether you’re just tin horn scouts—parlor scouts.”  “Well, do I sound all right?” I said. “Believe _me_, there are only two things that keep us from hiking around the world, and those are the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean.”  “Think you could climb over the Equator?” he said, laughing all the while. And he gave me another one of those shoves—_you_ know.  Then he said, “Well then, Skeezeks, I’ll tell you what you do. You call a meeting of the Foxes and lay this matter on the table——”  “Why should I lay it on the table?” I said; “you’d think it was a plate of soup. _I’ll stand_ on the table and address them, that’s what I’ll do.”  He said, “All right, you just picture the hardships to them. Tell them that for whole hours at a time, we may have to go without ice cream sodas. Tell them that we’ll have to penetrate a wilderness where there is no peanut brittle. Tell them that we’ll have to enter a jungle where gum drops are unknown. Tell them that we may have to live on grasshoppers. Tell them about the vast morass near Kingston, where you can’t even get a piece of chocolate cake; miles and miles of barren waste where the foot of white man has never trod upon a marshmallow——”  “Sure you can find marshmallows in the marshes,” I said. “We should worry.”  “You ask Willie and Tommy and Dorrie and the others if they are prepared to make the sacrifice—and I’ll do the rest. I’ll speak to Mr. Ellsworth. But remember about the heartless desert with its burning sands just above Newburgh. Now go chase yourself and round them up. I guess you know how to do it.”  So I got all the Silver Foxes into our patrol cabin and gave them a spooch. I guess I might as well tell you who they all are. First there’s me—I mean _I_. Correct, be seated. You learn that in the primary grade. I’m patrol leader and it’s _some_ job. Then comes Westy Martin; he’s my special chum. My sister says he has dandy hair. Then comes Dorry Benton—he’s got a wart on his wrist. Then comes Huntley Manners—Badleigh, that’s his middle name. Sometimes we call him Bad Manners. Then comes Charlie Seabury and then comes Will Dawson and then come Tom Warner and Ralph Warner—they’re twins. They’re both better looking than each other—that’s what Pee-wee Harris said. He’s a scream—he’s in the raving Raven patrol. Thank goodness he isn’t in this story—not much anyway. Ralph says Tom is crazy and Tom says Ralph is crazy and Will Dawson says they’re both right. I guess we’re all crazy. Anyway, Ralph and Tom came from Maine, so they’re both maniacs, hey?  This is the speech I spooched:      Fellow Foxes:      Shut up and give me a chance to talk. Sit down, Bad Manners.     I’ve got something to tell you and don’t all shout at once——  _Good night!_ They all began shouting separately. Then I said:      Harry Donnelle says he’s going to hike it all the way home to     Bridgeboro. He says we can go with him if we want to. Our time     is up Saturday, but we’ll have to start three or four days     sooner.      He said for me to sound you fellows, but believe me, there’s so     much sound that I can’t. I suppose the other patrols will go     back down the Hudson in the house-boat. Every fellow that’s in     favor of hiking it home with Mr. Harry Donnelle, will say     _aye_—but don’t say it yet. He said to tell you that we take     our lives in our hands——  “Why can’t we put them in our duffel bags?” Westy shouted.  “Did you think we’d take them in our feet?” Dorry yelled.  Then they all began shouting, “_Aye, aye, aye!_” even before I told them about the forests and morasses and jungles and deserts and things. Honest, you can’t do anything with that bunch.                                   CHAPTER III                   UNDAUNTED! (THAT’S PEE-WEE’S HEADING)   One thing about Harry Donnelle, he was a dandy fixer. When he fixed the camouflage for us so we could watch a chipmunk, I knew he was a good fixer. He said he learned how in France. He fixed the chimney on the cooking shack, too. That fellow could fix anything.  But a scoutmaster isn’t so easy to fix. Lots of times I tried to fix it with Mr. Ellsworth and I just couldn’t. He’d make me think that I wanted to do his way. He’s awful funny, he can just make you think that there’s more fun doing things his way. And I was trembling in my shoes—I mean I was trembling in my bare feet—for fear Harry Donnelle wouldn’t be able to fix it with him. But that fellow could fix it with the sun to shine—that’s what Mr. Burroughs said.  Pretty soon he came strolling down to the spring-board where a lot of us were having a dip in the lake.  “All right,” he said, “how about you?”  “Did you fix it?” I asked him.  “All cut and dried,” he said; “are you ready for the big adventure?”                   *        *        *        *        *  That afternoon we had a special troop meeting, to find out how the fellows felt about splitting the troop for the journey home. Because you see our three patrols always hung together. Mr. Ellsworth made a speech and said how Harry Donnelle had offered to lead the fierce and fiery Silver Foxes through the perilous wilds of New York State. He said that the journey would be filled with interest and data of scientific value (that’s just the way he talked) and how we hoped to cross the Ashokan Reservoir and visit other wild places. He said that we planned to enter the heart of the Artists Colony at Woodstock and see the artists in their native state and stalk some authors and poets, maybe, and study their habits.  Oh boy, you ought to have seen Harry Donnelle. He just sat there on the edge of Council Rock (that’s where we have important meetings at Temple Camp) and laughed and laughed and laughed.  Mr. Ellsworth said, “It is hoped that these brave scouts may succeed in capturing a poet and bringing him home as a specimen, and that they may find other fossils of interest. Meanwhile, the Ravens and the Elks and myself will drift down in our house-boat and endeavor to find someone to tow us from Poughkeepsie to New York and up our own dear river to Bridgeboro. The Ravens and the Elks wish me to offer the brave explorer, Mr. Harry Donnelle, a vote of thinks for taking the Silver Foxes away. They appreciate that he does this for the sake, not of the Silver Foxes, but as a good turn to the Ravens and the Elks. The Ravens and the Elks hope to have a little peace meanwhile. They thank him. In the familiar words of one of our famous patrol leaders, ‘_we should worry._’ And we wish you all good luck in your daring enterprise.”  I could see that he winked at Harry Donnelle and Harry Donnelle was laughing so hard that he couldn’t make a speech. So I climbed up on Council Rock and shouted, “Hear, hear!” Then I made a speech and this is it, because afterwards I wrote it out in our troop book.      The Silver Foxes thank the Ravens and the Elks for their kind     wishes. I bequeath all my extra helpings of dessert to Pee-wee     Harris of the Ravens—up to three helpings. After that it     reverts to Vic Norris of the Elks. Reverts means _goes to_. Who     ever reaches Bridgeboro, New Jersey, first will send out a     searching part for the others. The searching party will bring     their own eats. If we’re never heard of again, that’s a sign you     won’t hear from us. If we get to Bridgeboro and don’t find you,     that’ll be a sign that you’re not there. If you are there it     won’t be our fault. We should worry. We go forth for the sake of     prosperity—I mean posterity. So please tell posterity in case     we don’t reach home safely. If our friends and parents are     anxious, tell them to wait at Bennett’s on Bridge Street,     because that’ll be the first place we go to.  The next day was Wednesday and we started early in the morning. The others were going to start down in the house-boat on Saturday. I think the Ravens and the Elks must have sat up all night making crazy signs on cardboard just so as to guy us. And Mr. Ellsworth helped them, too. They had the whole camp with them—even Uncle Jeb; he’s manager. He used to be a trapper.  When we got out onto the main road, we saw signs tacked up on all the trees and I guess every scout in camp was there. One of the signs read, _Olive oil, but not good-bye_. Another one read _Day-day to the brave explorers_. Another one read, _Don’t forget to wear rubbers going through the Newburgh morass_. Another one read, _Beware of the treacherous Ashokan Reservoir_. A lot we cared. Didn’t people even make fun of Christopher Columbus?                                    CHAPTER IV                                    GO!   But remember, I told you that the hike didn’t really begin till we got to Catskill. The reason I don’t count the hike from Temple Camp to Catskill is because we were all the time hiking down there. It wasn’t a hike, it was a habit. I wouldn’t be particular about three or four miles. Besides, I wouldn’t ask you to take them, because they’ve been used before. I wouldn’t give you any second hand miles.  When we got to Catskill we bought some egg powder and bacon (gee, I love bacon) and coffee and sugar and camera films and mosquito dope and beans and flour and chocolate. You can make a dandy sandwich putting a slice of bacon between two slabs of chocolate. Mm-um! We had a pretty good bivouac outfit, because the Warner twins have a balloon silk shelter that rolls up so small you can almost put it in a fountain pen—that’s what Harry Donnelle said. Dorry Benton had his aluminum cooking set along, saucepans, cups, dishes, coffee pot—everything fits inside of everything else. One thing, we wouldn’t starve, that was sure, because we had enough stuff to make coffee and flapjacks for more than a week, counting six flapjacks to every fellow and fourteen to Hunt Manners; oh boy,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19815"],["title","Roy Blakeley, Pathfinder (#2)"],["body"," that fellow has some appetite! We had plenty of beans, too. Don’t you worry about our having plenty to eat.  When we got through shopping, we went to Warner’s Drug Store for sodas. Harry Donnelle said he’d treat us all, because maybe, those would be the last sodas that we’d ever have. As we came along we saw Mr. Warner standing in the doorway and he was smiling with a regular scout smile.  “There’s something wrong,” I said; “there’s some reason for him smiling like that.”  “Have a smile for everyone you meet,” Will Dawson began singing.  But, believe me, I know all the different kinds of smiles and there was something funny about Mr. Warner’s smile. When we got inside we saw a big sign hanging on the soda fountain. It read:                              A LAST FAREWELL                        TO THE SILVER PLATED FOXES                       BEFORE THEY ENTER THE JUNGLE  By that I knew that some of the fellows up at camp had been down to Warner’s the night before and put it there, because they knew that would be the last store we’d go to.  Harry Donnelle said, “All right, line up.” So we all sat in a row and some summer people who were in there began to laugh. What did we care? One girl said she wished she was a boy; girls are always saying that. So that proves we have plenty of fun. I could see Harry Donnelle wink at Mr. Warner while the latter (that means Mr. Warner) was getting the sodas ready. Then all of a sudden Harry said:  “_Attention! Present spoons. Go!_”  So then we all started at once and that was the beginning of the big hike. Just as I told you, it started at the top of the glasses in Warner’s and ended in the bottom of the glasses at Bennett’s. When you hear me say _M-mm-that’s good_ in Bennett’s, you’ll know the hike is over.                                    CHAPTER V                             I GO ON AN ERRAND   “Now to skirt the lonesome Catskills,” Harry said.  “Now to what them?” Dorry Benton asked him.  “Skirt them,” he said, “that’s Latin for hiking around the edge of them. We don’t want to be all the time stumbling over mountains.”  “Believe _me_, if I see one in the road, I’ll tell you,” I said.  “And we don’t want to get mixed up with panthers and wild cats either,” Harry said. And he gave me a wink.  “There aren’t any wild animals in the Catskills,” Charlie Seabury said.  “There are wild flowers,” I said, “but they won’t hurt anybody.”  “How about poison ivy?” Westy Martin said.  All the while as we hiked along the road toward Saugerties, we kept joking about the wild animals in the Catskills. Harry Donnelle said there used to be lots of wild cats and foxes, but not any more. He said there were some foxes, though.  Westy said, “I bet there are some bears; once Uncle Jeb saw a bear; he said there weren’t any foxes any more.”  “I guess there are some grey ones and maybe a few silver,” Harry Donnelle said.  “Silver?” I shouted. “Oh boy!” Then I asked him what they fed on mostly.  “Mostly on ice cream sodas,” he said; “they’re very dangerous after a half dozen raspberry sodas.”  We didn’t go near Saugerties, because we wanted to keep in the country, so we hit down southwest along the road that goes to Woodstock. Then we were going to hike it south past West Hurley so we’d bunk our noses right into the Ashokan Reservoir. And the next day we were going to spend trying to keep out of Kingston.  When it got to be about five o’clock in the afternoon, we hit in from the road to find a good place to camp. Maybe you think that’s easy, but you have to find a place where the drainage is good and where there’s good drinking water.  Pretty soon we found a dandy place about a quarter of a mile off the road, and we put up our tent there.  Harry Donnelle said, “There’s one kind of wild animal that I forgot to mention and I guess we’ll be hunting them all right; that’s mosquitoes. I guess one or two of you kids had better hit the trail for the nearest village and complete our shopping before we get any further. What do you say? We’re a little short on mosquito dope and we ought to have some crackers, and let’s see, a little meat would go good. I’m hungry.”  When we turned into the woods from the road, we knew that we were coming to a village and I guess that’s what put the idea into Harry’s head to have somebody go there and get two or three things that we hadn’t been able to get in Catskill. I told him that I’d go, because the rest would be busy getting in fire wood and I said it would be good if two or three of them tried to catch some fish in the brook.  Oh boy, I had hardly said that, when Ralph Warner shouted that he had a perch and that the brook was full of them. Harry Donnelle went over and saw for himself how it was, and then he came back and said to me that as long as there seemed to be plenty of fish I needn’t bother about meat, but that I’d better go and see if I could scare up some more mosquito dope and some sinkers for fishing and a trowel to dig bait with, because if we liked the place we might stay there till noon the next day. That’s the best way on a long hike—take it easy.  “How about Charlie Seabury?” I said; “he doesn’t like fish.”  “All right, get him a couple of chops, then,” Harry said; “now can you remember all the things you’re going to get? Mosquito dope, fishing sinkers, a writing pad and some stamps, and let’s see——”  “Some crackers,” I said.  “Righto,” he shouted after me.                                    CHAPTER VI                           I DISCOVER SOME TRACKS   I went back through the woods and when I got to the road I noticed how it curved, and just then I saw a very narrow path on the opposite side of the road that led into the woods. I decided it must be a short cut to the village. So I started along that path.  Pretty soon the woods grew very thick and it wasn’t so easy to follow the trail, because it was all overgrown with bushes. But I managed to keep hold of it all right, and after about fifteen minutes I came to a little stone house with the windows all boarded up and the door standing a little open. There was a staple on the door with an old padlock hanging on it, but I guess the padlock wasn’t any good. One thing sure, nobody lived there. I went and peeked inside and saw that it wasn’t meant for people at all, because there wasn’t any floor and it was all dark and damp and there were lots of spider webs around. Even there was one across the doorway, so by that I knew that nobody had been there lately.  Right in the middle, inside, were a couple of rocks and water was trickling up from under them. That’s what made me think that the place was just a spring house. Anyway, I didn’t wait because I was in a hurry. When I came out I pushed the door open a little and then I closed it all but about a foot or so. Inside of an hour I was mighty sorry that I hadn’t left it wide open, and you’ll see why.  I guess I had gone about a hundred yards further when I noticed something in the trail that started me guessing. It was the print of an animal; or anyway, if it wasn’t, I didn’t know what else it was. There were six prints, something like a cat’s, only the paw that made them had five toes. The other mark was the paw mark. It was the biggest print that I ever saw.  The first animal I thought about was a wild cat. But of course, I knew there weren’t any wild cats right there. Even if there were any in that part of the country, they wouldn’t be roaming around near villages. Anyway, the five toe prints had me guessing, because a wild cat has only four. I could see that the animal must have been crossing the path, because the print was sideways and the bushes alongside of the path were kind of trampled down.  You can bet I took a good look in those bushes for hairs, but I couldn’t find any and I kept wondering what kind of an animal had a paw as big as a man’s hand and five toes.  After I had gone a little further, I came plunk on a whole line of them along the path. I wasn’t exactly scared, but anyway, they made me feel sort of funny, because they were so big and printed so plain. The animal that made those tracks must have been a pretty big animal, I knew that.  Then, all of a sudden, I discovered something else. Some of the prints had five toe marks and some of them only four. Maybe that means the animal was lame, I said to myself, and doesn’t make a full print with one of its feet. But in a minute I had sense enough to see that wasn’t the way it was, because there were always two of one kind pretty close together and then two of the other kind pretty close together. This is the way it was; there was a five toe print then another one about a foot in back of it, then about three or four feet in back of that a couple more about a foot apart with only four toe marks.  Good night! I They had me all flabbergasted.  Pretty soon they left the path altogether and I looked in the bushes for hairs, but I couldn’t find a single one.  “Anyway,” I said to myself, “one thing sure, that animal has five toes on his front feet and only four on his hind feet and I never saw any tracks like that before or even pictures of them.”  I wasn’t exactly scared, but just the same I was kind of glad when I got to the village.                                   CHAPTER VII                            I MEET THE STRANGER   Anyway, that was the smallest village I ever saw to have such big tracks right near it. All I could see was two houses and the post office, and the post office was so small that you could almost put your arm down the chimney and open the front door. But, one thing sure, you could buy everything you wanted in that post office. You could buy a plough or a lollypop or anything. It smelled kind of like corn inside.  I got some lead sinkers and some crackers and a couple of chops for Charlie Seabury, because it makes him thirsty to eat fish—that’s what he says. The man didn’t have any mosquito dope, but there were some boxes of fly paper on the counter and I just happened to think"]]]
