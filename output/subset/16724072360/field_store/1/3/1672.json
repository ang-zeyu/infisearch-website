It was dark and Rupert himself was but a blur moving across the hall.  \"Do you still have the flash? Might as well descend into the lower regions and put on the lights.\"  They crossed the Long Hall, passing through another large chamber where furniture huddled under dust covers, and then into a small cupboard-lined passage. This gave upon a dark cavern where Val's hand scraped a table top only too painfully as he went. Then Rupert found the door leading to the cellar, and they went down and down into inky blackness upon which their thread of torch-light made little impression.  The damp, unpleasant scent of mold and wet grew stronger as they descended, and their fingers brushed slime-touched walls.  \"Phew! Not very comfy down here,\" Val protested as Rupert threw the torch beam along the nearest wall. With a grunt of relief he stepped forward to pull open the door of a small black box. \"That does it,\" he said as he threw the switch. \"Now for the topside again and some supper.\"  They negotiated the steps and found the button which controlled the kitchen lights. The glare showed them a room on the mammoth scale suggested by the Long Hall. A giant fireplace still equipped with three-legged pots, toasting irons, and spits was at one side, its brick oven beside it. But a very modern range and sink faced it.  In the center of the room was a large table, while along the far wall were closed cupboards. Save for its size and the novelty of the fireplace, it was an ordinary kitchen, complete to red-checked curtains at the windows. Pleasant and homey, Val thought rather wistfully. But that was before the coming of that night when Ricky walked in the garden and he heard something stir in the Long Hall--which should have been empty--  \"Val! Rupert!\" A cry which started valiantly became a wail as it echoed through empty rooms. \"Where are yo-o-ou!\"  \"Here, in the kitchen,\" Val shouted back.  A moment later Ricky stood in the doorway, her face flushed and her usually correct curls all on end.  \"Mean, selfish, utterly selfish pigs!\" she burst out. \"Leaving me all alone in the dark! And it's so dark!\"  \"We just went down to turn on the lights,\" Val began.  \"So I see.\" With a sniff she looked about her. \"It took two of you to do that. But it only required one of me to make three beds. Well, this is a warning to me. Next time--\" she did not finish her threat. \"I suppose you want some supper?\"  Rupert was already at the cupboards. \"That,\" he agreed, \"is the general idea.\"  \"Beans or--\" Ricky's hand closed upon Val's arm with a nipper-like grip. \"What,\" her voice was a thin thread of sound, \"was that?\"  Above the steady beat of the rain they heard a noise which was half scratch, half thud. Under Rupert's hand the latch of the cupboard clicked.  \"Back door,\" he said laconically.  \"Well, why don't you open it?\" Ricky's fingers bit tighter so that Val longed to twist out of her grip.  The key grated in the lock and then Rupert shot back the accompanying bolt.  \"Something's there,\" breathed Ricky.  \"Probably nothing but a branch blown against the door by the wind,\" Val assured her, remembering the tangled state of the garden.  The door came back, letting in a douche of cold rain and a black shadow which leaped for the security of the center of the room.  \"Look!\" Ricky laughed unsteadily and released Val's arm.  In the center of the neat kitchen, spitting angrily at the wet, stood a ruffled and oversized black tom-cat.     CHAPTER II  THE LUCK OF THE LORDS OF LORNE   \"Nice of you to drop in, old man,\" commented Rupert dryly as he shut the door. \"But didn't anyone ever mention to you that gentlemen wipe their feet before entering strange houses?\" He surveyed a line of wet paw prints across the brick floor.  \"Did he get all wet, the poor little--\" Ricky was on her knees, stretching out her hand and positively cooing. The cat put down the paw he had been licking and regarded her calmly out of round, yellow eyes. Then he returned to his washing. Val laughed.  \"Evidently he is used to the strong, silent type of human, Ricky. I wonder where he belongs.\"  \"He belongs to us now. Yes him does, doesn't him?\" She attempted to touch the visitor's head. His ears went back and he showed sharp teeth in no uncertain manner.  \"Better let him alone,\" advised Rupert. \"He doesn't seem to be the kind you can cuddle.\"  \"So I see.\" Ricky arose to her feet with an offended air. \"One would think that I resembled the more repulsive members of my race.\"  \"In the meantime,\" Rupert again sought the cupboard, \"let's eat.\"  Half an hour later, fed and well content (even Satan, as the Ralestones had named their visitor because of his temperament, having condescended to accept some of the better-done bits of bacon), they sat about the table staring at the dishes. Now it is a very well-known fact that dishes do _not_ obligingly leap from a table into a pan of well-soaped water, slosh themselves around a few times, and jump out to do a spot of brisk rubbing down. But how nice it would be if they did, thought Val.  \"The dishes--\" began Ricky in a faint sort of way.  \"Must be done. We gather that. How utterly nasty bacon grease looks when it's congealed.\" Her younger brother surveyed the platter before him with mournful interest.  \"And the question before the house is, I presume, who's going to wash them?\" Rupert grinned. \"This seems to be as good a time as any to put some sort of a working plan in force. There is a certain amount of so-called housework which has to be done. And there are three of us to do it. It's up to us to apportion it fairly. Shall we say, let everyone care for his or her own room--\"  \"There are also the little matters of washing, and ironing, and cleaning,\" Ricky broke in to remind him.  \"And we're down to fifty a month in hard cash. But the tenant farmer on the other side of the bayou is to supply us with fresh fruit and vegetables. And our wardrobes are fairly intact. So I think that we can afford to hire the washing done. We'll take turns cooking--\"  \"Who's elected to do the poisoning first?\" Val inquired with interest. \"I trust we possess a good cook-book?\"  \"Well, I'll take breakfast tomorrow morning,\" Rupert volunteered. \"Anyone can boil coffee and toast bread. As for dishes, we'll all pitch in together. And suppose we start right now.\"  When the dishes were back again in their neat piles on the cupboard shelves, Ricky vanished upstairs, to come trailing down again in a house-coat which she fondly imagined made her look like one of the better-known screen sirens. The family gathered in an aimless way before the empty fireplace of the Long Hall. Rupert was filling a black pipe which allowed him to resemble--in very slight degree, decided Val--an explorer in an English tobacco advertisement. Val himself was stretched full length on the couch with about ten pounds of cat attempting to rest on his center section in spite of his firm refusal to allow the same.  \"Br-r-r!\" Ricky shivered. \"It's cold in here.\"  \"Probably just Uncle Rick passing through--not the weather. No, cat, you may not sit on that stomach. It's just as full of bacon as yours is and it wants a nice long rest.\" Val swept Satan off to the floor and he resignedly went to roost by the boy's feet in spite of the beguiling noises Ricky made to attract his attention.  \"These stone houses are cold.\" Rupert scratched a match on the sole of his shoe. \"We ought to have flooring put down over this stone paving. I saw some wood stacked up in an outhouse when I put the car away. We'll have it in tomorrow and see what we can do about a fire in the evening.\"  \"And I thought the South was always warm.\" Ricky examined her hands. \"Whoever,\" she remarked pleasantly, \"took my hand lotion better return it. The consequences might not be very attractive.\"  \"Are you sure you packed it this morning?\" Val asked.  \"But of--\" Her fingers went to her mouth. \"I wonder if I did? I've just got to have some. We'll drive to town tomorrow and get a bottle.\"  \"Thirty miles or so for a ten-cent bottle of gooey stuff,\" Val protested.  \"Good idea.\" Rupert stood with his back to the fireplace as if there really were a flame or two within its black emptiness. \"I've some papers that LeFleur wants to see. Then there're our boxes at the freight station to arrange transportation for, and we'll have to see about getting a newspaper and--\"  \"Make a list,\" murmured his brother.  Rupert dropped down upon the wide arm of Ricky's chair and with her only too willing aid set to work. Val eyed them drowsily. Rupert and Ricky--or to give her her very formal name in full--Richanda Anne, were \"Red\" Ralestones, possessing the thin, three-cornered faces, the dark mahogany hair, the sharply defined cheek-bones which had been the mark of the family as far back in history as portraits or written descriptions existed. The \"Red\" Ralestones were marked also by height and a suppleness of body and movement. The men had been fine swordsmen, the ladies noted beauties. But they were also cursed, Val remembered vividly, with uncertain tempers.  Rupert had schooled himself to the point where his emotions were mastered by his will. But Val had seen Ricky enjoy full tantrums, and the last occasion was not so long ago that the scene had become misty in his memory. Generous to the point of self-beggary, loyal to a fault, and incurably romantic, that was a \"Red\" Ralestone.  Val himself was a \"Black\" Ralestone, which was a very different thing. They were a new growth on the family tree, a growth which appeared after the Ralestones had been exiled to colonial America. His black hair, his long, dark face of no particular beauty marked with straight, black brows set in a perpetual frown--that was the sign of a \"Black\" Ralestone. They were as strong-willed as the \"Reds,\" but their"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18818"],["title","On the Evolution of Language (#1)"],["body","organization, _i.e._, the degree to which the grammatic processes and methods are specialized, and the parts of speech differentiated; second, sematologic content, that is, the body of thought which the language is competent to convey.  The grammatic processes may be used for three purposes:  First, for _derivation_, where a new word to express a new idea is made by combining two or more old words, or by changing the vowel of one word, or by changing the intonation of one word.  Second, for _modification_, a word may be qualified or defined by the processes of combination, vocalic mutation or intonation.  It should here be noted that the plane between derivation and qualification is not absolute.  Third, for _relation_. When words as signs of ideas are used together to express thought, the relation of the words must be expressed by some means. In English the relation of words is expressed both by placement and combination, _i.e._, inflection for agreement.  It should here be noted that paradigmatic inflections are used for two distinct purposes, qualification and relation. A word is qualified by inflection when the idea expressed by the inflection pertains to the idea expressed by the word inflected; thus a noun is qualified by inflection when its number and gender are expressed. A word is related by inflection when the office of the word in the sentence is pointed out thereby; thus, nouns are related by case inflections; verbs are related by inflections for gender, number, and person. All inflection for agreement is inflection for relation.  In English, three of the grammatic processes are highly specialized.  _Combination_ is used chiefly for derivation, but to some slight extent for qualification and relation in the paradigmatic categories. But its use in this manner as compared with many other languages has almost disappeared.  _Vocalic mutation_ is used to a very limited extent and only by accident, and can scarcely be said to belong to the English language.  _Intonation_ is used as a grammatic process only to a limited extent--simply to assist in forming the interrogative and imperative modes. Its use here is almost rhetorical; in all other cases it is purely rhetorical.  _Placement_ is largely used in the language, and is highly specialized, performing the office of exhibiting the relations of words to each other in the sentence; _i.e._, it is used chiefly for syntactic relation.  Thus one of the four processes does not belong to the English language; the others are highly specialized.  The purposes for which the processes are used are _derivation_, _modification_, and _syntactic relation_.  _Derivation_ is accomplished by combination.  _Modification_ is accomplished by the differentiation of adjectives and adverbs, as words, phrases, and clauses.  _Syntactic relation_ is accomplished by placement. Syntactic relation must not be confounded with the relation expressed by prepositions. Syntactic relation is the relation of the parts of speech to each other as integral parts of a sentence. Prepositions express relations of thought of another order. They relate words to each other as words.  Placement relates words to each other as parts of speech.  In the Indian tongues combination is used for all three purposes, performing the three different functions of derivation, modification, and relation. Placement, also, is used for relation, and for both lands of relation, syntactic and prepositional.  With regard, then, to the processes and purposes for which they are used, we find in the Indian languages a low degree of specialization; processes are used for diverse purposes, and purposes are accomplished by diverse processes.   DIFFERENTIATION OF THE PARTS OF SPEECH.  It is next in order to consider to what degree the parts of speech are differentiated in Indian languages, as compared with English.  Indian nouns are extremely connotive, that is, the name does more than simply denote the thing to which it belongs; in denoting the object it also assigns to it some quality or characteristic. Every object has many qualities and characteristics, and by describing but a part of these the true office of the noun is but imperfectly performed. A strictly denotive name expresses no one quality or character, but embraces all qualities and characters.  In _Ute_ the name for bear is _he seizes_, or _the hugger_. In this case the verb is used for the noun, and in so doing the Indian names the bear by predicating one of his characteristics. Thus noun and verb are undifferentiated. In _Seneca_ the north is _the sun never goes there_, and this sentence may be used as adjective or noun; in such cases noun, adjective, verb, and adverb are found as one vocable or word, and the four parts of speech are undifferentiated. In the _Pavänt_ language a school-house is called _pó-kûnt-în-îñ-yî-kän_. The first part of the word, _pó-kûnt_, signifies _sorcery is practiced_, and is the name given by the Indians to any writing, from the fact that when they first learned of writing they supposed it to be a method of practicing sorcery; _în-îñ-yî_ is the verb signifying _to count_, and the meaning of the word has been extended so as to signify _to read_; _kän_ signifies wigwam, and is derived from the verb _küri_, _to stay_. Thus the name of the school-house literally signifies _a staying place where sorcery is counted_, or where papers are read. The _Pavänt_ in naming a school-house describes the purpose for which it is used. These examples illustrate the general characteristics of Indian nouns; they are excessively connotive; a simply denotive name is rarely found. In general their name-words predicate some attribute of the object named, and thus noun, adjective, and predicant are undifferentiated.  In many Indian languages there is no separate word for _eye_, _hand_, _arm_, or other parts and organs of the body, but the word is found with an incorporated or attached pronoun signifying _my_ hand, _my_ eye; _your_ hand, _your_ eye; _his_ hand, _his_ eye, etc., as the case may be. If the Indian, in naming these parts, refers to his own body, he says _my_; if he refers to the body of the person to whom he is speaking, he says _your_, &c. If an Indian should find a detached foot thrown from the amputating-table of an army field hospital, he would say something like this: I have found somebody _his foot_. The linguistic characteristic is widely spread, though not universal.  Thus the Indian has no command of a fully differentiated noun expressive of _eye_, _hand_, _arm_, or other parts and organs of the body.  In the pronouns we often have the most difficult part of an Indian language. Pronouns are only to a limited extent independent words.  Among the free pronouns the student must early learn to distinguish between the personal and the demonstrative. The demonstrative pronouns are more commonly used. The Indian is more accustomed to say _this_ person or thing, _that_ person or thing, than _he_, _she_, or _it_. Among the free personal pronouns the student may find an equivalent of the pronoun _I_, another signifying _I and you_; perhaps another signifying _I and he_, and one signifying _we, more than two_, including the speaker and those present; and another including the speaker and persons absent. He will also find personal pronouns in the second and third person, perhaps with singular, dual, and plural forms.  To a large extent the pronouns are incorporated in the verbs as prefixes, infixes, or suffixes. In such cases we will call them article pronouns. These article pronouns point out with great particularity the person, number, and gender, both of subject and object, and sometimes of the indirect object. When the article pronouns are used the personal pronouns may or may not be used; but it is believed that the personal pronouns will always be found. Article pronouns may not always be found. In those languages which are characterized by them they are used alike when the subject and object nouns are expressed and when they are not. The student may at first find some difficulty with these article pronouns. Singular, dual, and plural forms will be found. Sometimes distinct incorporated particles will be used for subject and object, but often this will not be the case. If the subject only is expressed, one particle may be used; if the object only is expressed, another particle; but if subject and object are expressed an entirely different particle may stand for both.  But it is in the genders of these article pronouns that the greatest difficulty may be found. The student must entirely free his mind of the idea that gender is simply a distinction of sex. In Indian tongues, genders are usually methods of classification primarily into animate and inanimate. The animate may be again divided into male and female, but this is rarely the case. Often by these genders all objects are classified by characteristics found in their attitudes or supposed constitution. Thus we may have the animate and inanimate, one or both, divided into the _standing_, the _sitting_, and the _lying_; or they may be divided into the _watery_, the _mushy_, the _earthy_, the _stony_, the _woody_, and the _fleshy_. The gender of these article pronouns has rarely been worked out in any language. The extent to which these classifications enter into the article pronouns is not well known. The subject requires more thorough study. These incorporated particles are here called _article_ pronouns. In the conjugation of the verb they take an important part, and have by some writers been called _transitions_. Besides pointing out with particularity the person, number, and gender or the subject and object, they perform the same offices that are usually performed by those inflections of the verb that occur to make them agree in gender, number, and person with the subject. In those Indian languages where the article pronouns are not found, and the personal pronouns only are used, the"]]]
