The Relation of Food to the Body.   In order to understand the relation of food to the sustenance and repairing of the body, it will be necessary to learn, first, of what the body is composed, and the corresponding elements contained in the food required to build and keep the body in a healthy condition. The following table gives the approximate analysis of a man weighing 148 pounds:--      Oxygen                 92.1 pounds.     Hydrogen               14.6    \"     Carbon                 31.6    \"     Nitrogen                4.6    \"     Phosphorus              1.4    \"     Calcium                 2.8    \"     Sulphur                 0.24   \"     Chlorine                0.12   \"     Sodium                  0.12   \"     Iron                    0.02   \"     Potassium               0.34   \"     Magnesium               0.04   \"     Silica                    ?    \"     Fluorine                0.02   \"                           ------     Total                 148.00 pounds.  As food contains all these elements, and as there is constant wearing and repair going on in the body, it will be readily seen how necessary some knowledge of the relation of food to the body is, in order to preserve health.

Otherwise, everybody was in good shape.  \"Wonder we didn't all black out, permanently,\" he said. \"Well, put on the visiscreens, and let's see what's going on outside. Olva, get on the radio and try to see if anybody else got away.\"  \"Set course for Tareesh?\" Glav asked. \"We haven't fuel enough to make it back to Doorsha.\"  \"I was afraid of that,\" Dard nodded. \"Tareesh it is; northern hemisphere, daylight side. Try to get about the edge of the temperate zone, as near water as you can....\"     2   They were flung off their feet again, this time backward along the boat. As they picked themselves up, Seldar Glav was shaking his head, sadly. \"That was the ship going up,\" he said; \"the blast must have caught us dead astern.\"  \"All right.\" Kalvar Dard rubbed a bruised forehead. \"Set course for Tareesh, then cut out the jets till we're ready to land. And get the screens on, somebody; I want to see what's happened.\"  The screens glowed; then full vision came on. The planet on which they would land loomed huge before them, its north pole toward them, and its single satellite on the port side. There was no sign of any rocket-boat in either side screen, and the rear-view screen was a blur of yellow flame from the jets.  \"Cut the jets, Glav,\" Dard repeated. \"Didn't you hear me?\"  \"But I did, sir!\" Seldar Glav indicated the firing-panel. Then he glanced at the rear-view screen. \"The gods help us! It's yellow flame; the jets are burning out!\"  Kalvar Dard had not boasted idly when he had said that his people would not panic. All the girls went white, and one or two gave low cries of consternation, but that was all.  \"What happens next?\" Analea wanted to know. \"Do we blow, too?\"  \"Yes, as soon as the fuel-line burns up to the tanks.\"  \"Can you land on Tareesh before then?\" Dard asked.  \"I can try. How about the satellite? It's closer.\"  \"It's also airless. Look at it and see for yourself,\" Kalvar Dard advised. \"Not enough mass to hold an atmosphere.\"  Glav looked at the army officer with new respect. He had always been inclined to think of the Frontier Guards as a gang of scientifically illiterate dirk-and-pistol bravos. He fiddled for a while with instruments on the panel; an automatic computer figured the distance to the planet, the boat's velocity, and the time needed for a landing.  \"We have a chance, sir,\" he said. \"I think I can set down in about thirty minutes; that should give us about ten minutes to get clear of the boat, before she blows up.\"  \"All right; get busy, girls,\" Kalvar Dard said. \"Grab everything we'll need. Arms and ammunition first; all of them you can find. After that, warm clothing, bedding, tools and food.\"  With that, he jerked open one of the lockers and began pulling out weapons. He buckled on a pistol and dagger, and handed other weapon-belts to the girls behind him. He found two of the heavy big-game rifles, and several bandoliers of ammunition for them. He tossed out carbines, and boxes of carbine and pistol cartridges. He found two bomb-bags, each containing six light anti-personnel grenades and a big demolition-bomb. Glancing, now and then, at the forward screen, he caught glimpses of blue sky and green-tinted plains below.  \"All right!\" the pilot yelled. \"We're coming in for a landing! A couple of you stand by to get the hatch open.\"  There was a jolt, and all sense of movement stopped. A cloud of white smoke drifted past the screens. The girls got the hatch open; snatching up weapons and bedding-wrapped bundles they all scrambled up out of the boat.  There was fire outside. The boat had come down upon a grassy plain; now the grass was burning from the heat of the jets. One by one, they ran forward along the top of the rocket-boat, jumping down to the ground clear of the blaze. Then, with every atom of strength they possessed they ran away from the doomed boat.         *       *       *       *       *  The ground was rough, and the grass high, impeding them. One of the girls tripped and fell; without pausing, two others pulled her to her feet, while another snatched up and slung the carbine she had dropped. Then, ahead, Kalvar Dard saw a deep gully, through which a little stream trickled.  They huddled together at the bottom of it, waiting, for what seemed like a long while. Then a gentle tremor ran through the ground, and swelled to a sickening, heaving shock. A roar of almost palpable sound swept over them, and a flash of blue-white light dimmed the sun above. The sound, the shock, and the searing light did not pass away at once; they continued for seconds that seemed like an eternity. Earth and stones pelted down around them; choking dust rose. Then the thunder and the earth-shock were over; above, incandescent vapors swirled, and darkened into an overhanging pall of smoke and dust.  For a while, they crouched motionless, too stunned to speak. Then shaken nerves steadied and jarred brains cleared. They all rose weakly. Trickles of earth were still coming down from the sides of the gully, and the little stream, which had been clear and sparkling, was roiled with mud. Mechanically, Kalvar Dard brushed the dust from his clothes and looked to his weapons.  \"That was just the fuel-tank of a little Class-3 rocket-boat,\" he said. \"I wonder what the explosion of the ship was like.\" He thought for a moment before continuing. \"Glav, I think I know why our jets burned out. We were stern-on to the ship when she blew; the blast drove our flame right back through the jets.\"  \"Do you think the explosion was observed from Doorsha?\" Dorita inquired, more concerned about the practical aspects of the situation. \"The ship, I mean. After all, we have no means of communication, of our own.\"  \"Oh, I shouldn't doubt it; there were observatories all around the planet watching our ship,\" Kalvar Dard said. \"They probably know all about it, by now. But if any of you are thinking about the chances of rescue, forget it. We're stuck here.\"  \"That's right. There isn't another human being within fifty million miles,\" Seldar Glav said. \"And that was the first and only space-ship ever built. It took fifty years to build her, and even allowing twenty for research that wouldn't have to be duplicated, you can figure when we can expect another one.\"  \"The answer to that one is, never. The ship blew up in space; fifty years' effort and fifteen hundred people gone, like that.\" Kalvar Dard snapped his fingers. \"So now, they'll try to keep Doorsha habitable for a few more thousand years by irrigation, and forget about immigrating to Tareesh.\"  \"Well, maybe, in a hundred thousand years, our descendants will build a ship and go to Doorsha, then,\" Olva considered.  \"Our descendants?\" Eldra looked at her in surprize. \"You mean, then...?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Kyna chuckled. \"Eldra, you are an awful innocent, about anything that doesn't have a breech-action or a recoil-mechanism,\" she said. \"Why do you think the women on this expedition outnumbered the men seven to five, and why do you think there were so many obstetricians and pediatricians in the med. staff? We were sent out to put a human population on Tareesh, weren't we? Well, here we are.\"  \"But.... Aren't we ever going to...?\" Varnis began. \"Won't we ever see anybody else, or do anything but just live here, like animals, without machines or ground-cars or aircraft or houses or anything?\" Then she began to sob bitterly.  Analea, who had been cleaning a carbine that had gotten covered with loose earth during the explosion, laid it down and went to Varnis, putting her arm around the other girl and comforting her. Kalvar Dard picked up the carbine she had laid down.  \"Now, let's see,\" he began. \"We have two heavy rifles, six carbines, and eight pistols, and these two bags of bombs. How much ammunition, counting what's in our belts, do we have?\"  They took stock of their slender resources, even Varnis joining in the task, as he had hoped she would. There were over two thousand rounds for the pistols, better than fifteen hundred for the carbines, and four hundred for the two big-game guns. They had some spare clothing, mostly space-suit undergarments, enough bed-robes, one hand-axe, two flashlights, a first-aid kit, and three atomic lighters. Each one had a combat-dagger. There was enough tinned food for about a week.  \"We'll have to begin looking for game and edible plants, right away,\" Glav considered. \"I suppose there is game, of some sort; but our ammunition won't last forever.\"  \"We'll have to make it last as long as we can; and we'll have to begin improvising weapons,\" Dard told him. \"Throwing-spears, and throwing-axes. If we can find metal, or any recognizable ore that we can smelt, we'll use that; if not, we'll use chipped stone. Also, we can learn to make snares and traps, after we learn the habits of the animals on this planet. By the time the ammunition's gone, we ought to have learned to do without firearms.\"  \"Think we ought to camp here?\"  Kalvar Dard shook his head. \"No wood here for fuel, and the blast will have scared away all the game. We'd better go upstream; if we go down, we'll find the water roiled with mud and unfit to drink. And if the game on this planet behave like the game-herds on the wastelands of Doorsha, they'll run for high ground when frightened.\"  Varnis rose from where she had been sitting. Having mastered her emotions, she was making a deliberate effort to show it.  \"Let's make up packs out of this stuff,\" she suggested. \"We can use the bedding and spare clothing to bundle up the food and ammunition.\"  They made up packs and slung them, then climbed out of the gully. Off to the left, the grass was burning in a wide circle around the crater left by the explosion of the rocket-boat. Kalvar Dard, carrying one of the heavy rifles, took the lead. Beside and a little behind him, Analea walked, her carbine ready. Glav, with the other heavy rifle, brought up in the rear, with Olva covering for him, and between, the"]]]
