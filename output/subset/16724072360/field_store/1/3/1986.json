I don't know what she will say when she sees this.\"  \"Don't let her see it.\"  \"She has the paper downstairs. She's probably reading it now.\"  Ann was glancing through the article.  \"It seems to be much the same sort of thing that they have published before. I can't understand why the _Chronicle_ takes such an interest in Jimmy Crocker.\"  \"Well, you see he used to be a newspaper man, and the _Chronicle_ was the paper he worked for.\"  Ann flushed.  \"I know,\" she said shortly.  Something in her tone arrested Mr. Pett's attention.  \"Yes, yes, of course,\" he said hastily. \"I was forgetting.\"  There was an awkward silence. Mr. Pett coughed. The matter of young Mr. Crocker's erstwhile connection with the New York _Chronicle_ was one which they had tacitly decided to refrain from mentioning.  \"I didn't know he was your nephew, uncle Peter.\"  \"Nephew by marriage,\" corrected Mr. Pett a little hurriedly. \"Nesta's sister Eugenia married his father.\"  \"I suppose that makes me a sort of cousin.\"  \"A distant cousin.\"  \"It can't be too distant for me.\"  There was a sound of hurried footsteps outside the door. Mrs. Pett entered, holding a paper in her hand. She waved it before Mr. Pett's sympathetic face.  \"I know, my dear,\" he said backing. \"Ann and I were just talking about it.\"  The little photograph had not done Mrs. Pett justice. Seen life-size, she was both handsomer and more formidable than she appeared in reproduction. She was a large woman, with a fine figure and bold and compelling eyes, and her personality crashed disturbingly into the quiet atmosphere of the room. She was the type of woman whom small, diffident men seem to marry instinctively, as unable to help themselves as cockleshell boats sucked into a maelstrom.  \"What are you going to do about it?\" she demanded, sinking heavily into the chair which her husband had vacated.  This was an aspect of the matter which had not occurred to Mr. Pett. He had not contemplated the possibility of actually doing anything. Nature had made him out of office hours essentially a passive organism, and it was his tendency, when he found himself in a sea of troubles, to float plaintively, not to take arms against it. To pick up the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune and fling them back was not a habit of his. He scratched his chin and said nothing. He went on saying nothing.  \"If Eugenia had had any sense, she would have foreseen what would happen if she took the boy away from New York where he was working too hard to get into mischief and let him run loose in London with too much money and nothing to do. But, if she had had any sense, she would never have married that impossible Crocker man. As I told her.\"  Mrs. Pett paused, and her eyes glowed with reminiscent fire. She was recalling the scene which had taken place three years ago between her sister and herself, when Eugenia had told her of her intention to marry an obscure and middle-aged actor named Bingley Crocker. Mrs. Pett had never seen Bingley Crocker, but she had condemned the proposed match in terms which had ended definitely and forever her relations with her sister. Eugenia was not a woman who welcomed criticism of her actions. She was cast in the same formidable mould as Mrs. Pett and resembled her strikingly both in appearance and character.  Mrs. Pett returned to the present. The past could look after itself. The present demanded surgery.  \"One would have thought it would have been obvious even to Eugenia that a boy of twenty-one needed regular work.\"  Mr. Pett was glad to come out of his shell here. He was the Apostle of Work, and this sentiment pleased him.  \"That's right,\" he said. \"Every boy ought to have work.\"  \"Look at this young Crocker's record since he went to live in London. He is always doing something to make himself notorious. There was that breach-of-promise case, and that fight at the political meeting, and his escapades at Monte Carlo, and--and everything. And he must be drinking himself to death. I think Eugenia's insane. She seems to have no influence over him at all.\"  Mr. Pett moaned sympathetically.  \"And now the papers have found out that I am his aunt, and I suppose they will print my photograph whenever they publish an article about him.\"  She ceased and sat rigid with just wrath. Mr. Pett, who always felt his responsibilities as chorus keenly during these wifely monologues, surmised that a remark from him was indicated.  \"It's tough,\" he said.  Mrs. Pett turned on him like a wounded tigress.  \"What is the use of saying that? It's no use saying anything.\"  \"No, no,\" said Mr. Pett, prudently refraining from pointing out that she had already said a good deal.  \"You must do something.\"  Ann entered the conversation for the first time. She was not very fond of her aunt, and liked her least when she was bullying Mr. Pett. There was something in Mrs. Pett's character with which the imperiousness which lay beneath Ann's cheerful attitude towards the world was ever at war.  \"What can uncle Peter possibly do?\" she inquired.  \"Why, get the boy back to America and make him work. It's the only possible thing.\"  \"But is it possible?\"  \"Of course it is.\"  \"Assuming that Jimmy Crocker would accept an invitation to come over to America, what sort of work could he do here? He couldn't get his place on the _Chronicle_ back again after dropping out for all these years and making a public pest of himself all that while. And outside of newspaper work what is he fit for?\"  \"My dear child, don't make difficulties.\"  \"I'm not. These are ready-made.\"  Mr. Pett interposed. He was always nervously apprehensive of a clash between these two. Ann had red hair and the nature which generally goes with red hair. She was impulsive and quick of tongue, and--as he remembered her father had always been--a little too ready for combat. She was usually as quickly remorseful as she was quickly pugnacious, like most persons of her colour. Her offer to type the story which now lay on her desk had been the amende honourable following on just such a scene with her aunt as this promised to be. Mr. Pett had no wish to see the truce thus consummated broken almost before it had had time to operate.  \"I could give the boy a job in my office,\" he suggested.  Giving young men jobs in his office was what Mr. Pett liked doing best. There were six brilliant youths living in his house and bursting with his food at that very moment whom he would have been delighted to start addressing envelopes down-town.  Notably his wife's nephew, Willie Partridge, whom he looked on as a specious loafer. He had a stubborn disbelief in the explosive that was to revolutionise war. He knew, as all the world did, that Willie's late father had been a great inventor, but he did not accept the fact that Willie had inherited the dead man's genius. He regarded the experiments on Partridgite, as it was to be called, with the profoundest scepticism, and considered that the only thing Willie had ever invented or was likely to invent was a series of ingenious schemes for living in fatted idleness on other people's money.  \"Exactly,\" said Mrs. Pett, delighted at the suggestion. \"The very thing.\"  \"Will you write and suggest it?\" said Mr. Pett, basking in the sunshine of unwonted commendation.  \"What would be the use of writing? Eugenia would pay no attention. Besides, I could not say all I wished to in a letter. No, the only thing is to go over to England and see her. I shall speak very plainly to her. I shall point out what an advantage it will be to the boy to be in your office and to live here. . . .\"  Ann started.  \"You don't mean live here--in this house?\"  \"Of course. There would be no sense in bringing the boy all the way over from England if he was to be allowed to run loose when he got here.\"  Mr. Pett coughed deprecatingly.  \"I don't think that would be very pleasant for Ann, dear.\"  \"Why in the name of goodness should Ann object?\"  Ann moved towards the door.  \"Thank you for thinking of it, uncle Peter. You're always a dear. But don't worry about me. Do just as you want to. In any case I'm quite certain that you won't be able to get him to come over here. You can see by the paper he's having far too good a time in London. You can call Jimmy Crockers from the vasty deep, but will they come when you call for them?\"  Mrs. Pett looked at the door as it closed behind her, then at her husband.  \"What do you mean, Peter, about Ann? Why wouldn't it be pleasant for her if this Crocker boy came to live with us?\"  Mr. Pett hesitated.  \"Well, it's like this, Nesta. I hope you won't tell her I told you. She's sensitive about it, poor girl. It all happened before you and I were married. Ann was much younger then. You know what schoolgirls are, kind of foolish and sentimental. It was my fault really, I ought to have . . .\"  \"Good Heavens, Peter! What are you trying to tell me?\"  \"She was only a child.\"  Mrs. Pett rose in slow horror.  \"Peter! Tell me! Don't try to break it gently.\"  \"Ann wrote a book of poetry and I had it published for her.\"  Mrs. Pett sank back in her chair.  \"Oh!\" she said--it would have been hard to say whether with relief or disappointment. \"Whatever did you make such a fuss for? Why did you want to be so mysterious?\"  \"It was all my fault, really,\" proceeded Mr. Pett. \"I ought to have known better. All I thought of at the time was that it would please the child to see the poems in print and be able to give the book to her friends. She did give it to her friends,\" he went on ruefully, \"and ever since she's been trying to live it down. I've seen her bite a young fellow's head off when he tried to make a grand-stand play with her by quoting her poems which he'd found in his sister's book-shelf.\"  \"But, in the name of goodness, what has all this to do with young Crocker?\"  \"Why, it was this way. Most of the papers just gave Ann's book a mention among 'Volumes Received,' or a couple of lines that didn't amount to anything, but the _Chronicle_"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20053"],["title","The Rover Boys in the Air; Or, From College Campus to the Clouds (#1)"],["body","\"  \"No, I wasn't,\" returned Tom, and now he got a little red also. \"If I did that, Sam might come along and want to name it the _Grace_. We had better give the girls' names a rest. Let's call her the _Dartaway_, that is, if she really does dart away when she flies.\"  \"All right, Tom; that's a first-class name,\" responded Dick. \"And _Dartaway_ she shall become, if Sam is willing. Now then, we'll fill that gasoline tank and let the engine warm up a bit. Probably it will need some adjusting.\"  \"Can we use the same gasoline as we use in the auto?\"  \"Yes, on ordinary occasions. In a race you can use a higher grade, so that aviator said. But then you'll have to readjust the magneto and carburetor.\"  \"Gracious, Dick! You're not thinking of an air race already, are you!\"  \"Oh, no! But we might get in a race some day,--and such things are good to know,\" answered Dick, as he walked off to the garage, where there was a barrel of gasoline sunk in the ground, with a pipe connection. He got out a five-gallon can and filled it, and then poured the gasoline in the tank of the biplane.  \"She'll hold more than that,\" said Tom, watching him. \"Here, give me the can and I'll fill the tank while we are at it. We'll want plenty of gas when that aviator gets here.\"  In a few minutes more the gasoline tank was full, and then the two lads busied themselves putting the engine in running order, and in filling up the lubricating oil box. They also oiled up the working parts, and oiled the propeller bearings and the steering gear.  \"Now, I guess she is all ready to run,\" remarked Dick, at length. \"My, but isn't she a beauty, Tom! Just think of sailing around in her!\"  \"I'd like to go up right now!\" answered the brother. \"If only I knew more about airships, hang me if I wouldn't try it!\"  \"Don't you dream of it, yet!\" answered Dick. \"We've got to learn the art of it, just like a baby has got to learn to walk. If you went up now you'd come down with a smash sure.\"  \"Maybe I would,\" mused Tom. \"Well, let us try the engine anyhow. And maybe we can try the propellers,\" he added, with a longing glance at the smooth, wooden blades.  \"One thing at a time,\" answered Dick, with a laugh. \"We'll try the engine, but we'll have to tie the biplane fast, or else it may run into something and get smashed.\"  \"Let us run her out into the field first. It's too gloomy in the shed. I'll hammer in some stakes and tie her.\"  The biplane rested on three small rubber-tired wheels, placed in the form of a triangle. Thus it was an easy matter to roll the big machine from the shed to the level field beyond. Then Tom ran back and procured some stakes, several ropes, and a hammer, and soon he had the biplane staked fast to the ground, after the manner of a small circus tent.  \"Now she can't break loose, even if you do start the engine and the propellers,\" said he, as he surveyed his work. \"Go ahead, Dick, and turn on the juice!\" he cried impatiently.  Dick Rover was just as anxious to see the engine work, and after another critical inspection he turned on the battery and then walked to one of the propellers.  \"We'll have to start the engine by turning these,\" he said.  \"All right!\" cried Tom, catching hold of the other wooden blades. \"Now then, all ready? Heave ahoy, my hearty!\" he added, in sailor fashion.  Four times were the wooden blades \"turned over\" and still the engine refused to respond. It was hard work, and both of the lads perspired freely, for it was a hot day in early September.  \"Got that spark connected all right?\" panted Tom, as he stopped to catch his breath.  \"Yes,\" was the reply, after Dick had made an inspection. \"The engine is cold, that's all.\"  \"Humph, well I'm not! But come on, let us give her another twist.\"  The brothers took hold again, and, at a word from Dick, each gave the wooden paddles of the propellers a vigorous turn. There came a sudden hiss, followed by a crack and a bang, and then off the engine started with the loudness of a gattling gun.  \"Hurrah! she's started!\" yelled Tom, triumphantly. \"Say, but she makes some noise, doesn't she?\" he added.  \"I should say yes. That's because airship engines don't have mufflers, like autos,\" yelled back Dick, to make himself heard above the explosions.  \"And see those propellers go around!\" went on Tom, in deep admiration. \"All you can see is a whirr! We sure have a dandy engine in this craft, Dick!\"  \"Looks so, doesn't it?\" returned Dick, also in admiration. \"I reckon the _Dartaway_ will give a good account of herself, when she is properly handled. Now, I had better stop the propellers, I guess,\" he added, moving toward the front of the biplane to do so.  \"Yes! yes! stop em!\" yelled Tom, suddenly. \"Hurry up, Dick! See how she is straining to break the ropes! Say, she wants to go up!\"  Dick was startled and with good reason. Even while his brother was speaking there came a sudden snap, and one of the ropes flew apart. Then up out of the ground came the stake holding another rope. The big biplane, thus released on one side, slewed around, and Tom was knocked flat. Then came another snap and two more ropes flew apart.  \"She's going! stop her!\" screamed Tom, from where he lay, and the next moment he saw Dick struck full in the face by the machine. Down went the youth backwards, and as he fell, with a rush and a roar, the biplane sped over the level ground for a distance of two hundred feet and then went sailing into the air, headed almost point blank for the Rover homestead, less than fifty rods away!     CHAPTER II  SOMETHING ABOUT THE ROVER BOYS   \"Oh, Dick, are you hurt?\"  The cry came from Tom, as he turned over on the ground and struggled to his feet. He had seen his brother hurled backwards, and he saw that Dick made no move to arise. He had been struck in the head, and blood was flowing from a wound over his left ear.  \"Oh, maybe he's killed!\" gasped poor Tom, and then, for the moment he forgot all about the flying machine, that was rushing so madly through the air towards the Rover homestead. He hurried to his brother's side, at the same time calling for others to come to his assistance.  To my old readers the lads already mentioned will need no introduction. For the benefit of others let me state that the Rover boys were three in number, Dick being the oldest, fun-loving Tom coming next, and sturdy Sam being the youngest. They were the sons of Anderson Rover, a widower, and when at home, as at present, lived with their father and their Uncle Randolph and Aunt Martha at a pleasant place known as Valley Brook farm, in New York state.  While their father was in Africa on a mission of importance, the three boys had been sent by their uncle to boarding school, as related in the first volume of this series, entitled, \"The Rover Boys at School.\" The place was Putnam Hall Military Academy, and there the lads had made many friends and also a few enemies.  From school the boys had made a short trip on the ocean, and then another trip into the jungle after their father. Then had followed a trip out West, and another on the Great Lakes. Later the youths had camped out in the mountains during the winter, shooting quite some game. Then they had returned to school, to go into camp during the summer with the other cadets.  The boys by this time thought their adventures at an end, but more were soon to follow. There came a long trip on land and sea, and then a voyage down the Ohio River, and soon after this the Rovers found themselves on the plains, where they had some adventures far out of the ordinary. From the plains they went further south, and in southern waters--the same being the Gulf of Mexico--they solved the mystery of the deserted steam yacht.  \"Now back to the farm for me!\" Sam had said at this time, and all were glad to go back, and also to return to Putnam Hall, from which seat of learning they presently graduated with honors. Then Mr. Anderson Rover got word of a valuable treasure, and he and the boys, with a number of their friends, went to Treasure Isle in search of it. They were followed by some of their enemies and the latter did all in their power to cause trouble.  Although the boys had finished at Putnam Hall, their days of learning were not yet over, and soon they set off for Brill College, a high-grade seat of learning located in one of our middle-western states. They had with them an old school chum named John Powell, usually called \"Songbird,\" because of his habit of making up and reciting so-called poetry, and were presently joined by another old school companion named William Philander Tubbs, a dudish chap who thought more of his dress and the society of ladies than he did of his studies. Tom loved to play jokes on Tubbs, who was generally too dense to see where the fun came in.  From the college the boys had taken another trip, as related in the fifteenth volume of this series, called \"The Rover Boys Down East.\" There was a mystery about that trip, of which the outside world knew little, but as that trip has something to do with the events which are to follow in this story, I will here give such details as seem necessary.  When the Rover Boys went to Putnam Hall they met three girls, Dora Stanhope and her two cousins, Nellie and Grace Laning. Dora's mother was a widow, living not far from the school, and it was not long before a warm friendship sprang up between Dick and Dora,--a friendship that grew more and more intimate as the days went by. Dick thought the world of Dora, and the two were now practically engaged to be married. As for Tom and Sam, they had taken to the two Laning girls from the start, and though Tom was too full of fun to pay much attention to girls, yet whenever Nellie was mentioned, he would grow red in the face; and it was noticed that whenever Grace was present Sam was usually on hand to keep her company.  The treasure unearthed on Treasure Isle had belonged to the Stanhope estate, the bulk of it going to Mrs. Stanhope and Dora and the remainder to the"]]]
