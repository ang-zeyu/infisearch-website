I beg your pardon!\" cried poor Alice again, for this time the mouse was bristling all over, and she felt certain that it was really offended, \"have I offended you?\"  \"Offended indeed!\" cried the mouse, who seemed to be positively trembling with rage, \"our family always hated cats! Nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't talk to me about them any more!\"  \"I won't indeed!\" said Alice, in a great hurry to change the conversation, \"are you--are you--fond of--dogs?\" The mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly: \"there is such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh! such long curly brown hair! And it'll fetch things when you throw them, and it'll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of things--I ca'n't remember half of them--and it belongs to a farmer, and he says it kills all the rats and--oh dear!\" said Alice sadly, \"I'm afraid I've offended it again!\" for the mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went.  So she called softly after it: \"mouse dear! Do come back again, and we won't talk about cats and dogs any more, if you don't like them!\" When the mouse heard this, it turned and swam slowly back to her: its face was quite pale, (with passion, Alice thought,) and it said in a trembling low voice \"let's get to the shore, and then I'll tell you my history, and you'll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.\"  It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite full of birds and animals that had fallen into it. There was a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the shore.  [Illustration]     Chapter II  [Illustration]   They were indeed a curious looking party that assembled on the bank--the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close to them--all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable. The first question of course was, how to get dry: they had a consultation about this, and Alice hardly felt at all surprised at finding herself talking familiarly with the birds, as if she had known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say \"I am older than you, and must know best,\" and this Alice would not admit without knowing how old the Lory was, and as the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was nothing more to be said.  At last the mouse, who seemed to have some authority among them, called out \"sit down, all of you, and attend to me! I'll soon make you dry enough!\" They all sat down at once, shivering, in a large ring, Alice in the middle, with her eyes anxiously fixed on the mouse, for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.  \"Ahem!\" said the mouse, with a self-important air, \"are you all ready? This is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please!  \"William the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria--\"  \"Ugh!\" said the Lory with a shiver.  \"I beg your pardon?\" said the mouse, frowning, but very politely, \"did you speak?\"  \"Not I!\" said the Lory hastily.  \"I thought you did,\" said the mouse, \"I proceed. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him; and even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the crown. William's conduct was at first moderate--how are you getting on now, dear?\" said the mouse, turning to Alice as it spoke.  \"As wet as ever,\" said poor Alice, \"it doesn't seem to dry me at all.\"  \"In that case,\" said the Dodo solemnly, rising to his feet, \"I move that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies--\"  \"Speak English!\" said the Duck, \"I don't know the meaning of half those long words, and what's more, I don't believe you do either!\" And the Duck quacked a comfortable laugh to itself. Some of the other birds tittered audibly.  \"I only meant to say,\" said the Dodo in a rather offended tone, \"that I know of a house near here, where we could get the young lady and the rest of the party dried, and then we could listen comfortably to the story which I think you were good enough to promise to tell us,\" bowing gravely to the mouse.  The mouse made no objection to this, and the whole party moved along the river bank, (for the pool had by this time began to flow out of the hall, and the edge of it was fringed with rushes and forget-me-nots,) in a slow procession, the Dodo leading the way. After a time the Dodo became impatient, and, leaving the Duck to bring up the rest of the party, moved on at a quicker pace with Alice, the Lory, and the Eaglet, and soon brought them to a little cottage, and there they sat snugly by the fire, wrapped up in blankets, until the rest of the party had arrived, and they were all dry again.  Then they all sat down again in a large ring on the bank, and begged the mouse to begin his story.  \"Mine is a long and a sad tale!\" said the mouse, turning to Alice, and sighing.  \"It is a long tail, certainly,\" said Alice, looking down with wonder at the mouse's tail, which was coiled nearly all round the party, \"but why do you call it sad?\" and she went on puzzling about this as the mouse went on speaking, so that her idea of the tale was something like this:  We lived beneath the mat        Warm and snug and fat               But one woe, & that                        Was the cat!

When the        cat's away,      Then    the mice    will      play,        But, alas!          one day, (So they say)               Came the dog and                         cat, Hunting                                 for a                                   rat,                              Crushed                           the mice                       all flat;                       Each                      one                      as                      he                      sat.

[Illustration]  Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet, \"Dinah's our cat. And she's such a capital one for catching mice, you can't think! And oh! I wish you could see her after the birds! Why, she'll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!\"  This answer caused a remarkable sensation among the party: some of the birds hurried off at once; one old magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully, remarking \"I really must be getting home: the night air does not suit my throat,\" and a canary called out in a trembling voice to its children \"come away from her, my dears, she's no fit company for you!\" On various pretexts, they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.  [Illustration]  She sat for some while sorrowful and silent, but she was not long before she recovered her spirits, and began talking to herself again as usual: \"I do wish some of them had stayed a little longer! and I was getting to be such friends with them--really the Lory and I were almost like sisters! and so was that dear little Eaglet! And then the Duck and the Dodo! How nicely the Duck sang to us as we came along through the water: and if the Dodo hadn't known the way to that nice little cottage, I don't know when we should have got dry again--\" and there is no knowing how long she might have prattled on in this way, if she had not suddenly caught the sound of pattering feet.  It was the white rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking anxiously about it as it went, as if it had lost something, and she heard it muttering to itself \"the Marchioness! the Marchioness!"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19004"],["title","The Customs of Old England (#1)"],["body","Law\" is not yet out of date; and Mr. E. F. Henderson's \"Select Documents of the Middle Ages\" and the late Mr. Serjeant Pulling's \"Order of the Coif,\" though widely differing in scope, are both extremely useful publications. Mr. Pollard's introduction to the Clarendon Press selection of miracle plays contains the pith of that interesting subject, and Miss Toulmin Smith's \"York Plays\" and Miss Katherine Bates's \"English Religious Drama\" will be found valuable guides. Perhaps the most realistic description of a miracle play is that presented in a few pages of Morley's \"English Writers,\" where the scene lives before one. For supplementary details in this and other contexts, the writer owes something to the industry of the late Dr. Brushfield, who brought to bear on local documents the illumination of sound and wide learning. A like tribute must be paid to the Rev. Dr. Cox, but having regard to his long and growing list of important works, the statement is a trifle ludicrous.  One of the best essays on mortuary rolls is that of the late Canon Raine in an early Surtees Society volume, but the writer is specially indebted to a contribution of the Rev. J. Hirst to the \"Archæological Journal.\" The late Mr. André's article on vowesses, and Mr. Evelyn-White's exhaustive account of the Boy-Bishop must be mentioned, and--lest I forget--Dr. Cunningham's \"History of English Commerce.\" The late Mr. F. T. Elworthy's paper on Hugh Rhodes directed attention to the Children of the Chapel, and Dom. H. F. Feasey led the way to the Lady Fast. Here and often the writer has supplemented his authorities out of his own knowledge and research. It may be added that, in numerous instances, indebtedness to able students (e.g., Sir George L. Gomme) has been expressed in the text, and need not be repeated. Finally, it would be ungrateful, as well as ungallant, not to acknowledge some debt to the writings of the Hon. Mrs. Brownlow, Miss Ethel Lega-Weekes, and Miss Giberne Sieveking. Ladies are now invading every domain of intellect, but the details as to University costume happened to be furnished by the severe and really intricate studies of Professor E. G. Clark.                                                           F. J. S.    TIVERTON, N.

The custom to which has been assigned the post of honour is of remarkable and various interest. It takes us back to a remote past, when the English, actuated by new-born fervour, sent the torch of faith to their German kinsmen, still plunged in the gloom of traditional paganism; and it was fated to end when the example of those same German kinsmen stimulated our countrymen to throw off a yoke which had long been irksome, and was then in sharp conflict with their patriotic ideals. It is foreign to the aim of these antiquarian studies to sound any note of controversy, but it will be rather surprising if the beauty and pathos of the custom, which is to engage our attention, does not appeal to many who would not have desired its revival in our age and country.[1] Typical of the thoughts and habits of our ancestors, it is no less typical of their place and share of the general system of Western Christendom, and in the heritage of human sentiment, since reverence for the dead is common to all but the most degraded races of mankind. That mutual commemoration of departed, and also of living, worth was not exclusive to this country is brought home to us by the fact that the most learned and comprehensive work on the subject, in its Christian and mediæval aspects, is Ebner's \"Die Klosterlichen Gebets-Verbrüderungen\" (Regensburg and New York, 1890). This circumstance, however, by no means diminishes--it rather heightens-the interest of a custom for centuries embedded in the consciousness and culture of the English people.  First, it may be well to devote a paragraph to the phrases applied to the institution. The title of the chapter is \"Leagues of Prayer,\" but it would have been simple to substitute for it any one of half a dozen others--less definite, it is true--sanctioned by the precedents of ecclesiastical writers. One term is \"friendship\"; and St. Boniface, in his letters referring to the topic, employs indifferently the cognate expressions \"familiarity,\" \"charity\" (or \"love\"). Sometimes he speaks of the \"bond of brotherhood\" and \"fellowship.\" Venerable Bede favours the word \"communion.\" Alcuin, in his epistles, alternates between the more precise description \"pacts of charity\" and the vaguer expressions \"brotherhood\" and \"familiarity.\" The last he employs very commonly. The fame of Cluny as a spiritual centre led to the term \"brotherhood\" being preferred, and from the eleventh century onwards it became general.  The privilege of fraternal alliance with other religious communities was greatly valued, and admission was craved in language at once humble, eloquent, and touchingly sincere. Venerable Bede implores the monks of Lindisfarne to receive him as their \"little household slave\"--he desires that \"my name also\" may be inscribed in the register of the holy flock. Many a time does Alcuin avow his longing to \"merit\" being one of some congregation in communion of love; and, in writing to the Abbeys of Girwy and Wearmouth, he fails not to remind them of the \"brotherhood\" they have granted him.  The term \"brother,\" in some contexts, bore the distinctive meaning of one to whom had been vouchsafed the prayers and spiritual boons of a convent other than that of which he was a member, if, as was not always or necessarily the case, he was incorporated in a religious order. The definition furnished by Ducange, who quotes from the diptych of the Abbey of Bath, proves how wide a field the term covers, even when restricted to confederated prayer:  \"Fratres interdum inde vocantur qui in ejusmodi Fraternitatem sive participationem orationum aliorumque bonorum spiritualium sive monachorum sive aliarum Ecclesiarum et jam Cathedralium admissi errant, sive laici sive ecclesiastici.\"  Thus the secular clergy and the laity were recognized as fully eligible for all the benefits of this high privilege, but it is identified for the most part with the functions of the regular clergy, whose leisured and tranquil existence was more consonant with the punctual observance of the custom, and by whom it was handed down to successive generations as a laudable and edifying practice importing much comfort for the living, and, it might be hoped, true succour for the pious dead.  In so far as the custom was founded on any particular text of Scripture, it may be considered to rest on the exhortation of St. James, which is cited by St. Boniface: \"Pray for one another that ye may be saved, for the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.\" St. Boniface is remembered as the Apostle of Germany, and when, early in the eighth century, he embarked on his perilous mission, he and his company made a compact with the King of the East Angles, whereby the monarch engaged that prayers should be offered on their behalf in all the monasteries in his dominion. On the death of members of the brotherhood, the tidings were to be conveyed to their fellows in England, as opportunity occurred. Not only did Boniface enter into leagues of prayer with Archbishops of Canterbury and the chapters and monks of Winchester, Worcester, York, etc., but he formed similar ties with the Church of Rome and the Abbey of Monte Cassino, binding himself to transmit the names of his defunct brethren for their remembrance and suffrage, and promising prayers and masses for _their_ brethren on receiving notice of their decease. Lullus, who followed St. Boniface as Archbishop of Mayence, and other Anglo-Saxon missionaries extended the scope of the confederacy, linking themselves with English and Continental monasteries--for instance,"]]]
