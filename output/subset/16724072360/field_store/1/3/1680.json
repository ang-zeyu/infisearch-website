The only way we'll find out will be by going there.\"  \"All right,\" agreed Arthur, grinning.  \"I'm wiser than you for once, Paul.  I haven't even tried to find out.  I know I can't guess, so I'm not wasting time trying to.  I think we'll be lucky if we find out when we do get there.\"  \"So do I, come to think of it,\" said Paul.  Somehow he felt better; before he had been inclined to blame himself for being stupid.  \"After all, you know, Arthur, even if they didn't expect anyone like us to get hold of these maps and sketches, that doesn't mean that they would make everything on them so plain that you could guess it at first sight. That sort of mark is awfully easy to understand when you have the key, but it's as bad as a cipher if you haven't.\"  It was quite dark, of course, when they finally set out.  Though it was Saturday night few people were about, and the locality was a lonely one.  Then, too, all of those who could had gone into the town.  It was there that news of what was going on in the great world outside would first be had; it was there that the country people could count upon getting the first hint of the intelligence that was to have so frightful a meaning for them.  The course the two scouts took carried them along the bank of the placid Ourthe, flowing peacefully, calmly along toward its confluence with the more important stream of the Meuse at Liege.  Behind them one strange thing proved that all was not quite normal.  From Fort Boncelles a searchlight began to play.  They had seen that light before, but only when it was being tested or when there were manoeuvres in progress.  Now it seemed to have a sinister meaning.  \"I think that means that there is war,\" said Paul.  \"They are keeping the searchlight going so that they may be sure to escape a surprise.\"  \"I think it's the Germans who will get the surprise,\" said Arthur, confidently.  But most of the time they walked on in silence.  Both were thinking a good deal; thinking of what war might mean, and wondering what part they themselves might play if it came.  Of one thing they were sure. All Belgium would rise to repel the invader, no matter what the pretext for the invasion might be.  \"Here we are,\" said Arthur, suddenly.  \"That's the house, Paul.\"  \"It looks quite dark, Arthur.  But let's go along toward it.  Not by the road--we'll cut through this field here.\"  This they proceeded to do.  But suddenly, as they neared the house, the ground seemed to give way beneath Paul.  He suppressed a cry, and the next moment he was vigorously turning back the treacherous ground with his foot.  Arthur turned on his light.  And there, beneath the soft loam, they saw a plate of shining steel.     CHAPTER III  THE HOUSE OF MYSTERY  Utterly bewildered, they stared down at the steel.  \"Put out your light!\" said Paul, suddenly.  His voice was tense.  \"Keep still a moment!  See if you can hear anyone moving around near us.\"  They were absolutely still for a full minute, but there were only the familiar sounds of the night.  \"All right,\" said Paul.  \"Now you watch and listen while I dig down here and see what this is about.\"  \"Why can't I dig, too?\"  \"Because it's better for you to watch.  Besides, I want to dig so that I can put the earth back in a hurry, and fix this place so that it won't look as if it had been disturbed.\"  Then he fell to, working silently and quickly, like a mole, digging with his hands until his nails were torn and his fingers were raw and bleeding.  But Paul did not mind that.  He had already made a guess, and a shrewd one, as to the meaning of this strange discovery that they had made.  It was not long before he found that the steel plate extended for only a short distance.  Around this, and spreading beneath it, was a bed of cement.  As soon as he had satisfied himself of that, using Arthur's flashlight, Paul stopped digging, and began carefully to replace the earth.  Then, calling on Arthur to help him, he trampled down the earth.  \"There!\" he said.  \"I don't believe anyone would know we had been here, unless they were suspicious already.\"  \"But what is it?\" asked Arthur.  \"Paul, tell me!\"  \"I'm going to, Arthur.  Don't worry.  But come away from here.  We don't want to be caught around here--and, besides, there's still a good deal for us to do.\"  Swiftly they made their way to the road, away from the cottage and the field where they had made their discovery.  \"Now!\" said Arthur, after a little distance had been covered, stopping short.  \"I won't go a step further until you tell me what that place is meant for!\"  \"It's meant for a big gun--that's what it's meant for!\" said Paul, vehemently.  \"Can't you see?  A siege gun can't be fired from a carriage, or even from ordinary ground.  The recoil would bury it in the earth if they tried that.  There's got to be a regular emplacement for it--a firm base of concrete and steel, so that it will withstand the shock of firing!\"  \"You mean they'd mount a gun here?\"  \"I mean just that!  It takes days, almost weeks, to do that.  They have to pour the concrete and let it stand until it's set.  But here they've got everything ready!  They can bring up their guns, place them, and begin firing, all in less than twenty-four hours!  They must have been preparing for this for months--perhaps for years!\"  \"The cowards!  We've never done anything to them!\"  \"No, they're not cowards,\" said Paul, thoughtfully.  \"I suppose they think they're right, and that as long as that is so, they are justified in using any means at all to win.  But I think we can put a spoke in their wheel, just the same.\"  \"I don't see how, Paul.  There aren't enough soldiers in Liege to watch every spot where there's a cross marked on these maps.\"  \"No, but that's not the only way, Arthur.\"  \"It's the only way to stop them from bringing up their siege gun, isn't it?  I know what the plan is in case of an attack.  It is for the forts to hold off the Germans until there's time for the French army to come up and relieve them.  And they're not supposed to be able to stand the fire of heavy guns.  The plan was made for use against an army that wouldn't have time to bring up its siege artillery.\"  \"Yes, that's true enough.  But, just the same, I think we can help. I'm so sure of it that I'm going to take these plans into Liege to-night and try to get them to General Leman.\"  \"I'm with you, Paul!  Are we to go now?\"  \"Not quite yet.  I'm interested in this house, too.  I want to find out whatever we can about it before we go in.  Don't you see what our finding that gun mounting means, Arthur?  Finding it just where we did--in a field that belongs to that house?\"  \"You mean there may be spies there now?\"  \"I don't say that they're there now.  But I think they have been there. And I know I'm going to find out all we can.\"  \"All right.  I think we ought to do that, too.  Let's get along!  It'll be awfully late when we get into Liege, I'm afraid.\"  The house that had suddenly assumed such an air of mystery, so great an importance, was dark as they approached.  Not a light showed from its windows.  But they took no chances, none the less.  They got very close to it without detection; they were able to go up to the windows.  And, listening there, they heard not a sound inside to indicate that anyone was within.  \"I'm going in,\" said Paul, suddenly.  \"Let me have your light, Arthur.\"  \"Can't I come in, too?\"  \"One of us must stay outside and keep watch,\" said Paul.  \"It's the hardest part of the job, Arthur.  If you stay outside, watch carefully, especially near the door.  Hide, so that you won't be seen, but in a place where you can see anyone who comes.  And if anyone is coming, call like a quail.  I'll be listening, and I'll slip out of this back window and get back to you.  But if they catch me, go back and get the plans, and then hurry into Liege.  Tell General Leman, if you can get to him, or a staff officer, if you can't, everything that has happened since we found these papers, whether it seems important to you or not. Something that may not seem to mean anything at all may really be very important.\"  \"But it seems to me you're taking all the risk,\" protested Arthur. \"That isn't fair.\"  \"It's just as risky outside as in,\" said Paul.  \"Here goes!  Off with you, now, and find a good place to hide!  We haven't any time to lose, I can tell you.  If there's no one inside now, they won't leave a place like this deserted very long, I'm sure.\"  Arthur went off reluctantly, but, as usual, he obeyed Paul to the letter.  He found a clump of bushes from which, without being seen himself, he could watch the door of the house, and there he crouched down to wait.  It was dull work, and, after he had once settled himself, he was afraid to move lest unseen eyes be watching somewhere in the neighborhood.  Meanwhile Paul was busy getting into the house.  It was easier than he had thought it likely to be.  The catch on the window was simplicity itself and he forced it with his penknife without any difficulty at all.  \"I feel like a burglar,\" he thought to himself, as he climbed in.  \"But I don't care.  Even if there's nothing wrong in here, I've got the right, in a time like this, to make sure.  Every Belgian has to think of his country first now.\"  And he was pretty sure that there was a decided connection between this cottage, so strangely stout in its construction, and the unquestionably threatening and sinister discovery he and Arthur had made in the field only a stone's throw away.  Inside, he found himself in a large room that took up all save a very small part of the ground floor of the cottage.  To the left there was a wall, and in it an open door--he could see that much through the very faint light that filtered through the windows.  Seemingly, he was in luck.  There was absolutely nothing to make him doubt that he was alone in the house.  Everything was still.

With the Five Families to push and lead, a new civilization developed, and when Survey came to call they were no longer savages. Combine bought the trade rights about seventy-five years ago. Then the Company and the Five Families got together and marketed a luxury item to the galaxy. You know how every super-jet big shot on twenty-five planets wants to say he's hunted on Khatka. And if he can point out a graz head on his wall, or wear a tail bracelet, he's able to strut with the best. To holiday on Khatka is both fabulous and fashionable--and very, very profitable for the natives and for Combine who sells transportation to the travelers.\"  \"I hear they have poachers, too,\" Dane remarked.  \"Yes, that naturally follows. You know what a glam skin brings on the market. Wherever you have a rigidly controlled export you're going to have poachers and smugglers. But the Patrol doesn't go to Khatka. The natives handle their own criminals. Personally, I'd cheerfully take a ninety-nine-year sentence in the Lunar mines in place of what the Khatkans dish out to a poacher they net!\"  \"So that rumor has spread satisfactorily!\"  Coffee slopped over the brim of Tau's mug and Dane dropped the packet of steak concentrate he was about to feed into the cooker. Chief Ranger Asaki loomed in the doorway of the mess as suddenly as if he had been teleported to that point.  The medic arose to his feet and smiled politely at the visitor.  \"Do I detect in that observation, sir, the suggestion that the tales I have heard were deliberately set to blast where they would do the most good as deterrents?\"  A fleeting grin broke the impassive somberness of the black face.  \"I was informed you are a man skilled in 'magic,' Medic. You certainly display the traditional sorcerer's quickness of wit. But this rumor is also truth.\" The quirk of good humor had gone again, and there was an edge in the Chief Ranger's voice which cut. \"Poachers on Khatka would welcome the Patrol in place of the attention they now receive.\"  He came into the mess cabin, Jellico behind him, and Dane pulled down two of the snap seats. He was holding a mug under the spout of the coffee dispenser as the captain made introductions.  \"Thorson--our acting-cargo-master.\"  \"Thorson,\" the Khatkan acknowledged with a grave nod of his head, and then glanced down to floor level with a look of surprise. Weaving a pattern about his legs, purring loudly, Sindbad was offering an unusually fervent welcome of his own. The Ranger went down on one knee, his hand out for Sindbad's inquiring sniff. Then the cat butted that dark palm, batted at it playfully with claw-sheathed paw.  \"A Terran cat! It is of the lion family?\"  \"Far removed,\" Jellico supplied. \"You'd have to add a lot of bulk to Sindbad to promote him to the lion class.\"  \"We have only the old tales.\" Asaki sounded almost wistful as the cat jumped to his knee and clawed for a hold on his chest belts. \"But I do not believe that lions were ever so friendly toward my ancestors.\"  Dane would have removed the cat, but the Khatkan arose with Sindbad, still purring loudly, resting in the crook of his arm. The Ranger was smiling with a gentleness which changed the whole arrogant cast of his countenance.  \"Do not bring this one to Khatka with you, Captain, or you will never take him away again. Those who dwell in the inner courts would not let him vanish from their sight. Ah, so this pleases you, small lion?\" He rubbed Sindbad gently under the throat and the cat stretched his neck, his yellow eyes half closed in bliss.  \"Thorson,\" the Captain turned to Dane, \"that arrival report on my desk was the final one from Combine?\"  \"Yes, sir. There's no hope of the _Rover_ setting down here before that date.\"  Asaki sat down, still holding the cat. \"So you see, Captain, fortune has arranged it all. You have two tens of days. Four days to go in my cruiser, four days for your return here, and the rest to explore the preserve. We could not ask for better luck, for I do not know when our paths may cross again. In the normal course of events I will not have another mission to Xecho for a year, perhaps longer. Also--\" He hesitated and then spoke to Tau. \"Medic, Captain Jellico has informed me that you have made a study of magic on many worlds.\"  \"That is so, sir.\"  \"Do you then believe that it is real force, or that it is only a superstition for child-people who set up demons to howl petitions to when some darkness falls upon them?\"  \"Some of the magic I have seen is trickery, some of it founded upon an inner knowledge of men and their ways which a shrewd witch doctor can use to his advantage. There always remains\"--Tau put down his mug, \"--there always remains a small residue of happenings and results for which we have not yet found any logical explanations--\"  \"And I believe,\" Asaki interrupted, \"it is also true that a race can be conditioned from birth to be sensitive to forms of magic so that men of that blood are particularly susceptible.\" That was more of a statement than a question, but Tau answered it.  \"That is very true. A Lamorian, for example, can be 'sung' to death. I have witnessed such a case. But upon a Terran or another off-world man the same suggestion would have no effect.\"  \"Those who settled Khatka brought such magic with them.\" The Chief Ranger's fingers still moved about Sindbad's jaw and throat soothingly, but his tone was chill, the coldest thing in the cramped space of the mess cabin.  \"Yes, a highly developed form of it,\" Tau agreed.  \"More highly developed perhaps than even you can believe, Medic!\" That came in a hiss of cold rage. \"I think that its present manifestation--death by a beast that is not a beast--could be worth your detailed study.\"  \"Why?\" Tau came bluntly to the point.  \"Because it is a killing magic and it is being carefully used to rid my world of key men, men we need badly. If there is a weak point in this cloudy attack shaping against us, we must learn it, and soon!\"  It was Jellico who added the rest. \"We are invited to visit Khatka and survey a new hunting range as Chief Ranger Asaki's personal term guests.\"  Dane drew a deep breath of wonder. Guest rights on Khatka were jealously guarded--they were too valuable to their owners to waste. Whole families lived on the income from the yearly rental of even half a one. But the Rangers, by right of office, had several which they could grant to visiting scientists or men from other worlds holding positions similar to their own. To have such an opportunity offered to an ordinary Trader was almost incredible.  His wonder was matched by Tau's and must have been plain to read for the Chief Ranger smiled.  \"For a long time Captain Jellico and I have exchanged biological data on alien life-forms--his skill in photographing such, his knowledge as an xenobiologist are widely recognized. And so I have permission for him to visit the new Zoboru preserve, not yet officially opened. And you, Medic Tau, your help, or at least your diagnosis, we need in another direction. So, one expert comes openly, another not so openly. Though, Medic, your task is approved by my superiors. And\"--he glanced at Dane--\"perhaps to muddle the trail for the suspicious, shall we not ask this young man also?\"  Dane's eyes went to the captain. Jellico was always fair and his crew would have snapped into action on his word alone--even if they were fronting a rain of Thorkian death darts and that order was to advance. But, on the other hand, Dane would never have asked a favor, and the best he hoped for was to be able to perform his duties without unfavorable comment upon their commission. He had no reason to believe Jellico was willing to agree to this.  \"You have two weeks' planet-side leave coming, Thorson. If you want to spend it on Khatka....\" Jellico actually grinned then. \"I take it that you do. When do we up-ship, sir?\"  \"You said that you must wait for the return of your other crew members--shall we say mid-afternoon tomorrow?\" The Chief Ranger stood up and put Sindbad down though the cat protested with several sharp meows.  \"Small lion,\" the tall Khatkan spoke to the cat as to an equal, \"this is your jungle, and mine lies elsewhere. But should you ever grow tired of traveling the stars, there is always a home for you in my courts.\"  When the Chief Ranger went out the door, Sindbad did not try to follow, but he uttered one mournful little cry of protest and loss.  \"So he wants a trouble shooter, does he?\" Tau asked. \"All right, I'll try to hunt out his goblins for him; it'll be worth that to visit Khatka!\"  Dane, remembering the hot glare of the Xecho spaceport, the sea one could not swim in, contrasted that with the tri-dees he had seen of the green hunters' paradise on the next planet of the system. \"Yes, sir!\" he echoed and made a haphazard choice for the cooker.  \"Don't be too lighthearted,\" Tau warned. \"I'll say that any stew which was too hot for that Ranger to handle might give us burned fingers--and quick. When we land on Khatka, walk softly and look over your shoulder, and be prepared for the worst.\"     II   Lightning played along the black ridges above them, and below was a sheer drop to a river which was only a silver thread. Under their boots, man-made and yet dominating the wildness of jungle and mountain, was a platform of rock slabs, fused to support a palace of towering yellow-white walls and curved cups of domes, a palace which was also half fortress, half frontier post.  Dane set his hands on the parapet of the river drop, blinked as a lightning bolt crackled in a sky-splitting glare of violet fire. This was about as far from the steaming islands of Xecho as a man could imagine.  \"The demon graz prepare for battle.\" Asaki nodded toward the distant crackling.  Captain Jellico laughed. \"Supposed to be whetting their tusks, eh? I wouldn't care to meet a graz that could produce"]]]
