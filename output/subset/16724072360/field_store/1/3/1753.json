Sergeant Early, Corporal Cutting and Private Muzzi, tho wounded, were still alive.  He lined the prisoners up \"by twos.\"  His own wounded he put at the rear of the column, and forced the Germans to carry those who could not walk. The other Americans he stationed along the column to hold the prisoners in line.  Sergeant Early, shot through the body, was too severely wounded to continue in command. York was a corporal, but there was no question of rank for all turned to him for instructions. The Germans could not take their eyes off of him, and instantly complied with all his orders, given through the major, who spoke English.  Stray bullets kept plugging through the branches of the trees around them. For the first time the Americans realized they were under fire from the Germans on the hill back of them, whom they had seen when they came out of the deserted trench. The Germans stationed there could not visualize the strange fight that was taking place behind a line of German machine guns, and they were withholding their fire to protect their own men. They were plugging into the woods with rifles, hoping to draw a return volley, and thus establish the American's position.  To all who doubted the possibility of carrying so many prisoners through the forest, or spoke of reprisal attacks to release them, York's reply was:  \"Let's get 'em out of here!\"  The German major looking down the long line of Germans, possibly planning some recoup from the shame and ignominy of the surrender of so many of them, stepped up to York and asked:  \"How many men have you got?\"  The big mountaineer wheeled on him:  \"I got a-plenty!\"  And the major seemed convinced that the number of the Americans was immaterial as York thrust his automatic into the major's face and stepped him up to the head of the column.  Among the captives were three officers.  These York placed around him to lead the prisoners--one on either side and the major immediately before him. In York's right hand swung the automatic pistol, with which he had made an impressive demonstration in the fight up the hill. The officers were told that at the first sign of treachery, or for a failure of the men behind to obey a command, the penalty would be their lives; and the major was informed that he would be the first to go.  With this formation no German skulking on the hill or in the bushes could fire upon York without endangering the officers. Similar protection was given all of the Americans acting as escort.  Up the hill York started the column. From the topography of the land he knew there were machine guns over the crest that had had no part in the fight.  Straight to these nests he marched them. As the column approached, the major was forced by York to command the gunners to surrender.  Only one shot was fired after the march began. At one of the nests, a German, seeing so many Germans as prisoners and so few of the enemy to guard them--all of them on the German firing-line with machine gun nests around them--refused to throw down his gun, and showed fight.  York did not hesitate.  The remainder of that gun's crew took their place in line, and the major promised York there would be no more delays in the surrenders if he would kill no more of them.  As a great serpent the column wound among the trees on the hilltop swallowing the crews of German machine guns.  After the ridge had been cleared, four machine gun-nests were found down the hillside.  It took all the woodcraft the young mountaineer knew to get to his own command. They had come back over the hilltop and were on the slope of the valley in which the Eighty-Second Division was fighting. They were now in danger from both German and American guns.  York listened to the firing, and knew the Americans had reached the valley--and that some of them had crossed it. Where their line was running he could not determine.  He knew if the Americans saw his column of German uniforms they were in danger--captors and captives alike--of being annihilated. At any moment the Germans from the two hilltops down the valley--to check the Eighty-Second Division's advance--might lay a belt of bullets across the course they traveled.  Winding around the cleared places and keeping in the thickly timbered section of the hillslope whenever it was possible, Sergeant York worked his way toward the American line.  In the dense woods the German major made suggestions of a path to take. As York was undecided which one to choose, the major's suggestion made him go the other one. Frequently the muzzle of York's automatic dimpled the major's back and he quickened his step, slowed up, or led the column in the direction indicated to him without turning his head and without inquiry as to the motive back of York's commands.  Down near the foot of the hill, near the trench they had traveled a short while before, York answered the challenge to \"Halt!\"  He stepped out so his uniform could be seen, and called to the Americans challenging him, and about to fire on the Germans, that he was \"bringing in prisoners.\"  The American line opened for him to pass, and a wild cheer went up from the Doughboys when they saw the column of prisoners. Some of them \"called to him to know\" if he had the \"whole damned German army.\"  At the foot of the hill in an old dugout an American P. C. had been located, and York turned in his prisoners.  The prisoners were officially counted by Lieut. Joseph A. Woods, Assistant Division Inspector, and there were 132 of them, three of the number were officers and one with the rank of major.  When the Eighty-Second Division passed on, officers of York's regiment visited the scene of the fight and they counted 25 Germans that he had killed and 35 machine guns that York had not only silenced but had unmanned, carrying the men back with him as prisoners.  When York was given \"his receipt for the prisoners,\" an incident happened that shows the true knightliness of character of this untrained mountaineer.  It was but a little after ten o'clock in the morning. The Americans had a hard day's fighting ahead of them. Somewhere out in the forest York's own company--Company G--and his own regiment--the 328th Infantry--were fighting. He made inquiry, but no one could direct him to them. He turned to the nearest American officer, saluted and reported, \"Ready for duty.\"  What he had done was to him but a part of the work to be done that day.  But York was assigned to the command of his prisoners, to carry them back to a detention camp. The officers were held by the P. C.--for an examination and grilling on the plans of the enemy.  Whenever they could the private soldiers among the prisoners gathered close to York, now looking to him for their personal safety.  On the way to the detention camp the column was shelled by German guns from one of the hilltops. York maneuvered them and put them in double quick time until they were out of range.  Late in the afternoon, back of the three hills that face Hill No. 223, the \"All America\" Division \"cut\" the Decauville Railroad that supplied a salient to the north that the Germans were striving desperately to hold. As they swept on to their objective they found the hill to the left of the valley, that turns a shoulder toward No. 223--which the people of France have named \"York's Hill\"--cleared of Germans, and on its crest, silent and unmanned machine guns.  Americans returned and buried on the hillside--beside a thicket, near a shack that had been the German officer's headquarters--six American soldiers. They placed wooden crosses to mark the graves and on the top of the crosses swung the helmets the soldiers had worn.  Out from the forest came the story of what York had done. The men in the trenches along the entire front were told of it. Not only in the United States, but in Great Britain, France and Italy, it electrified the public. From the meager details the press was able to carry, for the entire Entente firing-line was ablaze and a surrender was being forced upon Germany, and York's division was out in the Argonne still fighting its way ahead, the people could but wonder how one man was able to silence a battalion of machine guns and bring in so many prisoners.  Major-General George B. Duncan, commander of the Eighty-Second Division, and officers of York's regiment knew that history had been made upon that hillside. By personal visits of the regiment's officers to the scene, by measurements, by official count of the silent guns and the silent dead, by affidavits from those who were with York, the record of his achievement was verified.  Major-General C. P. Summerall, before the officers of York's regiment, said to him:  \"Your division commander has reported to me your exceedingly gallant conduct during the operations of your division in the Meuse-Argonne Battle. I desire to express to you my pleasure and commendation for the courage, skill, and gallantry which you displayed on that occasion. It is an honor to command such soldiers as you. Your conduct reflects great credit not only upon the American army, but upon the American people. Your deeds will be recorded in the history of this great war and they will live as an inspiration not only to your comrades but to the generations that will come after us.\"  General John J. Pershing in pinning the Congressional Medal of Honor upon him--the highest award for valor the United States Government bestows--called York the greatest civilian soldier of the war.  Marshal Foch, bestowing the Croix de Guerre with Palm upon him, said his feat was the World War's most remarkable individual achievement.  A deed that is done through the natural use of a great talent seems to the doer of the deed the natural thing to have done. A sincere response to appreciation and praise, made by those endowed with real ability, usually comes cloaked in a genuine modesty.  At his home in the \"Valley of the Three Forks o' the Wolf,\" after the war was over, I asked Alvin"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19135"],["title","The Southerner: A Romance of the Real Lincoln (#1)"],["body","er time that there wuz plenty o' work an' real money in it, I'd stick to it jist ter please you, an' be a lost an' ruined soul! Yessir, they'd carve on my headstone jest one line:       \"BORN A MAN--AND DIED A JACKLEG CARPENTER.  \"Wouldn't that be awful?\"  The momentary smile on the woman's sensitive face faded into a look of pain. She tried to make a good-natured reply, but her lips refused to move.  The man pressed on eagerly:  \"O Nancy, why can't ye be happy here? We've a snug little cabin nest, we've enough to eat and enough to wear. The baby's laughin' at yer heels all day and snugglin' in her little bed at night. The birds make music fur ye in the trees. The creek down thar's laughin' an' singing' winter an' summer. The world's too purty an' life's too short ter throw hit away fightin' an' scramblin' fur nothin'.\"  \"For something--Tom--something big----\"  \"Don't keer how big 'tis--what of it? All turns ter ashes in yer hands bye an' bye an' yer life's gone. We can't live these young days over again, can we? Ye know the preacher says: 'What shall hit profit a man ef he gain the whole world an' lose his life?' Let me off'n these lessons, Honey? I'm too old; ye can't larn me new tricks now. Let me off fer good an' all, won't ye?\"  \"No,\" was the firm answer. \"It means too much. I won't give up and let the man I love sign his name forever with a cross mark.\"  \"I ain't goin' ter sign no more papers nohow!\" Tom broke in.  \"I signed our marriage bond with a mark, Tom,\" she went on evenly, \"just because you couldn't write your name. You've got to learn, I won't give up!\"  \"Well, it's too late to-night fur any more lessons, now _ain't_ it?\"  \"Yes, we'll make up for it next time.\"  The tired hunter was soon sound asleep dreaming of the life that was the breath of his nostrils.  Through the still winter's night the young wife lay with wide staring eyes. Over and over again she weighed her chances in the grim struggle begun for the mastery of his mind. The longer she asked herself the question of success or failure the more doubtful seemed the outcome. How still the world!  The new life within her strong young body suddenly stirred, and a feeling of awe thrilled her heart. God had suddenly signalled from the shores of Eternity.  When her husband waked at dawn he stared at her smiling face in surprise.  \"What ye laughin' about, Nancy?\" he cried.  She turned toward him with a startled look:  \"I had a vision, Tom!\"  \"A dream, I reckon.\"  \"God had answered the prayer of my heart,\" she went on breathlessly, \"and sent me a son. I saw him a strong, brave, patient, wise, gentle man. Thousands hung on his words and great men came to do him homage. With bowed head he led me into a beautiful home that had shining white pillars. He bowed low and whispered in my ear: 'This is yours, my angel mother. I bought it for you with my life. All that I am I owe to you.'\"  She paused a moment and whispered:  \"O Tom, man, a new song is singing in my soul!\"   II  The woman rose quietly and went the rounds of her daily work. She made her bed to-day in trance-like silence. It was no gilded couch, but it had been built by the hand of her lover and was sacred. It filled the space in one corner of the cabin farthest from the fire. A single post of straight cedar securely fixed in the ground held the poles in place which formed the side and foot rail. The walls of the cabin formed the other side and head. Across from the pole were fixed the slender hickory sticks that formed the springy hammock on which the first mattress of moss and grass rested. On this was placed a feather bed made from the wild fowl Tom had killed during the past two years. The pillows were of the finest feathers from the breasts of ducks. A single quilt of ample size covered all, and over this was thrown a huge counterpane of bear skins. Two enormous bear rugs almost completely covered the dirt floor, and a carpet of oak leaves filled out the spaces.  The feather bed beaten smooth, the fur covering drawn in place and the pillows set upright against the cabin wall, she turned to the two bunks in the opposite corner and carefully re-arranged them. They might be used soon. This was the corner of her home set aside for guests. Tom had skillfully built two berths boat fashion, one above the other, in this corner, and a curtain drawn over a smooth wooden rod cut this space off from the rest of the room when occupied at night by visitors.  The master of this cabin never allowed a stranger to pass without urging him to stop and in a way that took no denial.  A savory dish of stewed squirrel and corn dumplings served for lunch. The baby's face was one glorious smear of joy and grease at its finish.  The mother took the bucket from its shelf and walked leisurely to the spring, whose limpid waters gushed from a rock at the foot of the hill. The child toddled after her, the little moccasined feet stepping gingerly over the sharp gravel of the rough places.  Before filling the bucket she listened again for the crack of Tom's rifle, and could hear nothing. A death-like stillness brooded over the woods and fields. He was probably watching for muskrat under the bluff of the creek. He had promised to stay within call to-day.  The afternoon dragged wearily. She tried to read the one book she possessed, the Bible. The pages seemed to fade and the eyes refused to see.  \"O Man, Man, why don't you come home!\" she cried at last.  She rose, walked to the door, looked and listened--only the distant rattle of a woodpecker's beak on a dead tree in the woods. The snow began to fall in little fitful dabs. It was two miles to the nearest cabin, and her soul rose in fierce rebellion at her loneliness. It was easy for a man who loved the woods, the fields and running waters, this life, but for the woman who must wait and long and eat her heart out alone--she vowed anew that she would not endure it. By the sheer pull of her will she would lift this man from his drifting life and make him take his place in the real battle of the world. If her new baby were only a boy, he could help her and she would win. Again she stood dreaming of the vision she had seen at dawn.  The dark young face suddenly went white and her hand gripped the facing of the door.  She waited half doubting, half amused at her fears. It was only the twinge of a muscle perhaps. She smiled at her sudden panic. The thought had scarcely formed before she blanched the second time and the firm lips came together with sudden energy as she glanced at the child playing on the rug at her feet.  She seized the horn that hung beside the door and blew the pioneer's long call of danger. Its shrill note rang through the woods against the hills in cadences that seemed half muffled by the falling snow.  Again her anxious eyes looked from the doorway. Would he never come! The trembling slender hand once more lifted the horn, a single wild note rang out and broke suddenly into silence. The horn fell from her limp grasp and she lifted her eyes to the darkening sky in prayer, as Tom's voice from the edge of the woods came strong and full:  \"Yes, Honey, I'm comin'!\"  There was no question of doctor or nurse. The young pioneer mother only asked for her mate.  For two fearful hours she gripped his rough hands until at last her nails brought the blood, but the man didn't know or care. Every smothered cry that came from her lips began to tear the heart out of his body at last. He could hold the long pent agony no longer without words.  \"My God, Nancy, what can I do for ye, Honey?\"  Her breath came in gasps and her eyes were shining with a strange intensity.  \"Nothing, Tom, nothing now--I'm looking Death in the face and I'm not afraid----\"  \"Please lemme give ye some whiskey,\" he pleaded, pressing the glass to her lips.  \"No--no, take it away--I hate it. My baby shall be clean and strong or I want to die.\"  The decision seemed to brace her spirit for the last test when the trembling feet entered the shadows of the dim valley that lies between Life and Death.  The dark, slender figure lay still and white at last. A sharp cry from lusty lungs, and the grey eyes slowly opened, with a timid wondering look.  \"Tom!\" she cried with quick eager tones.  \"Yes, Nancy, yes!\"  \"A boy?\"  \"Of course--and a buster he is, too.\"  \"Give him to me--quick!\"  The stalwart figure bent over the bed and laid the little red bundle in her arms. She pressed him tenderly to her heart, felt his breath on her breast and the joyous tears slowly poured down her cheeks.   III  Before the first year of the boy's life had passed the task of teaching his good-natured, stubborn father became impossible. The best the wife could do was to make him trace his name in sprawling letters that resembled writing and painfully spell his way through the simplest passages in the Bible.  The day she gave up was one of dumb despair. She resolved at last to live in her boy. All she had hoped and dreamed of life should be his and he would be hers. Her hands could make him good or bad, brave or cowardly, noble or ignoble.  He was a remarkable child physically, and grew out of his clothes faster than she could make them. It was easy to see from his second year that he would be a man of extraordinary stature. Both mother and father were above the average height, but he would overtop them both. When he tumbled over the bear rugs on the cabin floor his father would roar with laughter:  \"For the Lord's sake, Nancy, look at them legs! They're windin' blades. Ef he ever gits grown, he won't have ter ax fer a blessin', he kin jest reach up an' hand it down hisself!\"  He was four years old when he got the first vision of his mother that time should never blot out. His father was away on a carpenter job of four days. Sleeping in the lower bunk in the corner, he waked with a start to hear the chickens cackling loudly. His mother was quietly dressing. He leaped to his feet shivering in the dark and whispered:  \"What is it, Ma?\"  \""]]]
