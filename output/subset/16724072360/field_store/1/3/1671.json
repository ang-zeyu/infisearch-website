He returned to his bed, therefore, and slept like a marine till the call bell woke him in the morning.  As he dressed himself he could not help thinking of the mysterious visitation, and he asked himself a great many questions in regard to the object of the intruder, since it did not appear that he had entered the house for the purpose of robbing its occupants. He could not determine whether or not the fellow had actually come into his room; but his porte-monnaie, which contained a considerable sum of money, and his gold repeater, a very valuable watch, were just where he had left them the night before.  In the breast pocket of his uniform coat he found the envelope which contained his commission as a lieutenant, received only two days before his orders, and some other papers. As a precaution against inquisitive persons, if the package should happen to be mislaid in the house, he had applied some mucilage in the library, and resealed the envelope. It had not been tampered with so far as he could discover, and he returned it to the pocket.  The mysterious visitor at the mansion, whoever or whatever he was, could not be regarded as a burglar, or, if he was, he had strangely neglected his opportunities, for he had failed to appropriate at least five hundred dollars worth of watches and money, which he could hardly have helped seeing. His object was not plunder, and there was nothing to indicate the purpose of his visit. In retiring from the house the intruder had left the front door ajar: and Christy thought it would have been the most natural thing in the world to close it, in order to conceal the way by which he had left the mansion. But he might have done this to avoid the noise of shutting it, or had neglected it in his haste to escape.  When he had completed his toilet Christy looked at his watch, and was rather surprised to find that it was a full hour later than usual when the call bell had been rung. He went down-stairs, and found his mother and Florry very busy in the dining-room, setting the table. This was the man's work, and the young officer was astonished to see his mother and sister doing it.  \"What has broken now, mother?\" asked the lieutenant, glancing from one to the other of the busy couple.  \"I don't know that anything has broken,\" replied Mrs. Passford, with a smile, after she had said good-morning to her son.  \"You and Florry are not in the habit of setting the table, mother; and the first bell rang an hour later than usual,\" added Christy.  \"We were all disturbed last night, and I did not wake till the cook knocked at my door. She told me she could not find Walsh, and breakfast had been ready half an hour. That is the reason why everything is late this morning,\" Mrs. Passford explained.  \"But where is Walsh?\" inquired Christy.  \"I am sure I do not know. I called in the coachman, and he has been to his room and looked all over the place without finding him.\"  \"That is very odd,\" mused the officer, wondering whether this sudden disappearance had anything to do with the principal event of the preceding night.  \"Peach says he has taken his valise with him, which indicates that he has gone for good.\"  \"Who is Peach?\" asked Christy, who had been at home so little that he hardly knew the names of the servants.  \"He is the coachman. I am not sorry that Walsh has gone, for he has saved me the trouble of discharging him. Wilder, who had been with us so many years, took it into his head to enlist in the army, and I was not willing to persuade him to shirk his duty. Walsh has not been here quite two weeks. He said he was born in the West Indies; but he was always prying into matters that did not concern him, and I have several times found him standing at the door when we were talking about family matters. I reproved him for it; but it did no good. Your father intended to discharge him as soon as he returned from Washington.\"  Christy went to the library, and busied himself in considering whether or not the sudden departure of Walsh had any connection with the mysterious midnight intruder. The two events had been near together in point of time; but he could establish no other relation between them. Then it flashed upon his mind that the man-servant had been the person who had opened or closed his door, and visited his room; but he was sure he had seen a man near the grand entrance of the estate. He had been all around the house, and Walsh could not have escaped his observation. He had answered the bell, and admitted him after his search. He concluded that the servant was not the person who had disturbed his slumbers.  The morning mail brought a letter from Captain Passford, informing the family that he was detained in Washington, and that he could not be at home to say good-by to his son, who was to leave that day in the store ship Vernon. He wrote a special letter to Christy, containing not only his adieux, but the good advice he would otherwise have given him in person.  The breakfast was rather a sad gathering on account of this parting, for Christy was to leave in another hour. Bertha Pembroke and her father were quite as sad as the mother and sister, and the young officer did his best to cheer up the family and the guests. He tried to make them laugh, but he found it was up-hill work.  \"You will be in command of a steamer, Christy, when you reach the Gulf. I hope you will not be rash, and try to do too much,\" said Mrs. Passford, as they rose from the table.  \"I don't think I am ever rash, mother; and if I have been exceedingly fortunate, it was more because the circumstances favored me than because I ran great risks,\" replied Christy very seriously, for he was sensitive on the point his mother had brought up. \"Father has said a great deal to me on this subject, and I have always done my best to carry out his principles. It is not my fault that I have a friend at court, and have had opportunities that have not been offered to many others. But the tide may turn against me on my next cruise.\"  \"I hope it will not, my son,\" added his mother very earnestly.  \"No one knows what is going to happen, and I may spend the next year or two in a Confederate prison. I don't think my Uncle Homer would cry his eyes out if such should be my fate, for he has lost several vessels and cargoes of cotton on my account,\" returned Christy.  \"But I am sure he has no ill-will against you.\"  \"I don't think he has.\"  \"By the way, Christy, have you heard anything from him or his family lately?\" asked Mrs. Passford.  \"Not a word, and I am not likely to hear from them. Corny Passford was exchanged, and sent back to the South a year ago or more; and I have no idea what has become of him since.\"  After breakfast Christy packed his valise, where he placed the new uniform in which he intended to present himself on the quarter-deck of the Bronx. The carriage was at the door to convey him to the railroad station. The parting was not less tender than it had been on former similar occasions, and Mrs. Passford preferred that it should be in the house rather than at the railroad station, in the presence of curious observers. Many tears were shed after the carriage drove off, for the patriotic young man might find a grave in southern soil, or beneath southern waters.  The young lieutenant choked down his emotions, and tried to think of the future; his case was not different from that of hundreds of thousands of others who had gone forth to fight the battles of their country, many thousands of whom slumber in hallowed graves far away from home and friends. As the train moved on towards the great city, he obtained the command of his emotions, and felt a new inspiration of patriotic ardor.  On his arrival in New York he hastened across the ferry to the navy-yard. As he approached the opposite shore, he discovered a steamer getting under way. He had not seen the vessel on board of which he was ordered to report as a passenger, but when he asked a deck hand what the steamer was, he was informed that it was the Vernon. The ferry-boat had just gone into the slip, and Christy was terribly startled to learn that he was late. He was still two hours ahead of the time indicated in his orders, and the Vernon was actually getting under way.  The young officer was more excited than he had ever been in the face of the enemy, for the present looked like a case in which his honor was at stake. He felt that it would be his ruin if the Vernon sailed without him. There had been some mistake in his orders, or in those of the commander of the store ship, and he was likely to be the sufferer for it. He rushed to the stern end of the ferry-boat in order to obtain a better view of the steamer; and at this moment he discovered a boat, pulled by one man, headed towards the navy-yard.  \"Boat, ahoy!\" shouted Christy, with almost frantic earnestness.  \"On board the ferry-boat!\" replied the man, resting on his oars.  \"Five dollars if you will put me on board of that steamer before she gets off!\" added the officer.  \"I'm the one for your money,\" returned the oarsman, as he headed his boat into the slip.  Without much difficulty Christy dropped his valise into the boat, and then dropped himself in after it. The belated passenger cast an earnest look at the Vernon, which had just begun to move, though at a snail's pace, and he hoped he should be able to get on board of her.  \"Naval officer, sir?\" interrogated the boatman.  \"Yes; but I have no time to spare, and you must not stop to talk,\" replied Christy rather sharply.  \"Time enough, sir, if you are going on board of the Vernon, and I will give you one of my oars if I don't put you on her deck,\" said the boatman very positively. \"I hope you are nimble with your feet and hands,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18817"],["title","Ralestone Luck (#1)"],["body","gland.\"  \"Because it was built by an exile,\" said Rupert softly. \"An exile who loved his home so well that he labored five years in the wilderness to build its duplicate. Those little diamond-paned windows were once protected with shutters an inch thick, and the place was a fort in Indian times. But it is strange to this country. That's why it's one of the show places. LeFleur asked me if we would be willing to keep up the custom of throwing the state rooms open to the public one day a month.\"  \"And shall we?\" asked Ricky.  \"We'll see. Well, don't you want to see the inside as well as the out?\"  \"Of course! Val, you lazy thing, get out!\"  \"Certainly, m'lady.\" He swung open the door and climbed out stiffly. Although he wouldn't have confessed it for any reason, his leg had been aching dully for hours.  \"Do you know,\" Ricky hesitated on the first terrace step, bending down to put aside a trail of morning-glory vine which clutched at her ankle, \"I've just remembered!\"  \"What?\" Rupert looked up from the grid where he was unstrapping their luggage.  \"That we are the very first Ralestones to--to come home since Grandfather Miles rode away in 1867.\"  \"And why the sudden dip into ancient history?\" Val inquired as he limped around to help Rupert.  \"I don't know,\" her eyes were fast upon moss-greened wall and ponderous door hewn of a single slab of oak, \"except--well, we are coming home at last. I wonder if--if they know. All those others. Rick and Miles, the first Rupert and Richard and--\"  \"That spitfire, the Lady Richanda?\" Rupert smiled. \"Perhaps they do. No, leave the bags here, Val. Let's see the house first.\"  Together the Ralestones crossed the terrace and came to stand by the front door which still bore faint scars left by Indian hatchets. But Rupert stooped to insert a very modern key into a very modern lock. There was a click and the door swung inward before his push.  \"The Long Hall!\" They stood in something of a hesitant huddle at the end of a long stone-floored room. Half-way down its length a wooden staircase led up to the second floor, and directly opposite that a great fireplace yawned mightily, black and bare.  A leather-covered lounge was directly before this, flanked by two square chairs. And by the stairs was an oaken marriage chest. Save for two skin rugs, these were all the furnishings.  But Ricky had crossed hesitatingly to that cavernous fireplace and was standing there looking up as her brothers joined her.  \"There's where it was,\" she said softly and pointed to a deep niche cut into the surface of the stone overmantel. That niche was empty and had been so for more than a hundred years--to their hurt. \"That was where the Luck--\"  \"How hold ye Lorne?\" Rupert's softly spoken question brought the well-remembered answer to Val's lips:  \"By the oak leaf, by the sea wave, by the broadsword blade, thus hold we Lorne!\"  \"The oak leaf is dust,\" murmured Ricky, \"the sea wave is gone, the broadsword is rust, how now hold ye Lorne?\"  Her brothers answered her together:  \"By our Luck, thus hold we Lorne!\"  \"And we've got to get it back,\" she said. \"We've just got to! When the Luck hangs there again, we--\"  \"Won't have anything left to worry about,\" Val finished for her. \"But that's a very big order, m'lady. Short of catching Rick's ghost and forcing him to disclose the place where he hid it, I don't see how we're going to do it.\"  \"But we are going to,\" she answered confidently. \"I know we are!\"  \"A good thing,\" Rupert broke in, a hint of soberness beneath the lightness of his tone as he looked about the almost bare room and then at the strained pallor of Val's thin face. \"The Ralestones have been luckless too long. And now suppose we take possession of this commodious mansion. I suggest that we get settled as soon as possible. I don't like the looks of the western sky. We're probably going to have a storm.\"  \"What about the car?\" Val asked as his brother turned to go.  \"Harrison used the old carriage house as a garage. I'll run it in there. You and Ricky better do a spot of exploring and see about beds and food. I don't know how you feel,\" he went on grimly, \"but after last night I want something softer than a dozen rocks to sleep on.\"  \"I told you not to stop at that tourist place,\" began Ricky smugly. \"I said--\"  \"You said that a house painted that shade of green made you slightly ill. But you didn't say anything about beds,\" Val reminded her as he shed his coat and hung it on the newel-post. \"And since the Ralestone family have definitely gone off the gold or any other monetary standard, it's tourist rests or the poorhouse for us.\"  \"Probably the poorhouse.\" Rupert sounded resigned. \"Now upstairs with you and get out some bedding. LeFleur said in his letter that the place was all ready for occupancy. And he stocked up with canned stuff.\"  \"I know--beans! Just too, too divine. Well, let's know the worst.\" Ricky started up the stairs. \"I suppose there are electric lights?\"  \"Got to throw the main switch first, and I haven't time to do that now. Here, Val.\" Rupert tossed him his tiny pocket torch as he turned to go. The door closed behind him and Ricky looked over her shoulder.  \"This--this is rather a darkish place, isn't it?\"  \"Not so bad.\" Val considered the hall below, which seemed suddenly peopled by an overabundance of oddly shaped shadows.  \"No,\" her voice grew stronger, \"not so bad. We're together anyway, Val. Last year I thought I'd die, shut up in that awful school, and then coming home to hear--\"  \"About me making my first and last flight. Yes, not exactly a rest cure for any of us, was it? But it's all over now. The Ralestones may be down but they're not out, yet, in spite of Mosile Oil and those coal-mines. D'you know, we might use some of that nice gilt-edged stock for wall-paper. There's enough to cover a closet at least. Here we are, Rupert from beating about the globe trying to be a newspaper man, you straight from N'York's finest finishing-school, and me--well, out of the plainest hospital bed I ever saw. We've got this house and what Rupert managed to clear from the wreck. Something will turn up. In the meantime--\"  \"Yes?\" she prompted.  \"In the meantime,\" he went on, leaning against the banister for a moment's rest, \"we can be looking for the Luck. As Rupert says, we need it badly enough. Here's the upper hall. Which way now?\"  \"Over to the left wing. These in front are what Rupert refers to as 'state bedrooms.'\"  \"Yes?\" He opened the nearest door and whistled softly. \"Not so bad. About the size of a small union station and provided with all the comforts of a tomb. Decidedly not what we want.\"  \"Wait, here's a plaque set in the wall. Look!\" She ran her finger over a glass-covered square.  \"Regulations for guests, or a floor plan to show how to reach the dining-room in the quickest way,\" her brother suggested.  \"No.\" She read aloud slowly:       \"'This Room Was Occupied by General Andrew Jackson, the Victor      of the Battle of New Orleans, upon the Tenth Day after the      Battle.'\"  \"Whew! 'Old Hickory' here! But I thought that the Ralestones were more or less under a cloud at that time,\" commented Val.  \"History--\"  \"In the making. Quite so. Now may I suggest that we find some slumber rooms slightly more modern? Rupert is apt to become annoyed at undue delay in such matters.\"  They went down the hall and turned into a short cross corridor. From a round window at the far end a ray of sun still swept in, but it was a sickly, faded ray. The storm Rupert had spoken of could not be far off.  \"This is the right way. Mr. Harrison had these little numbers put on the doors for his guests,\" Ricky pointed out. \"I'll take 'three'; that was marked on the plan he sent us as a lady's room. You take that one across the hall and let Rupert have the one next to you.\"  The rooms they explored were not as imposing as the one which had sheltered Andrew Jackson for a night. Furnished with chintz-covered chairs, solid mahogany bedsteads and highboys, they were pleasant enough even if they weren't chambers to make an antique dealer \"Oh!\" and \"Ah!\" Val discovered with approval some stiff prints of mathematically correct clippers hung in exact patterns on his walls, while Ricky's room held one treasure, a dainty dressing-table.  A small door near the end of the hall gave upon a linen closet. And Ricky, throwing her short white jacket and hat upon the chair in her room, set about making beds, having given Val strict orders to return to the lower hall and sort out the luggage before bringing it up.  As he reached the wide landing he stopped a moment. Since that winter night, almost a year in the past, when a passenger plane had decided--in spite of its pilot--to make a landing on a mountainside, he had learned to hobble where he had once run. The accident having made his right leg a rather accurate barometer, that crooked bone was announcing the arrival of the coming storm with a sharp pain or two which shot unexpectedly from knee to ankle. One such caught him as he was about to take a step and threw him suddenly off balance.  He clutched at a dim tapestry which hung across the wall and tumbled through a slit in the fabric--which smelled of dust and moth balls--into a tiny alcove flanking a broad, well-cushioned window-seat under tall windows. Below him in a riot of bushes and hedges run wild, lay the garden. Somewhere beyond must lie Bayou Mercier leading directly to Lake Borgne and so to the sea, the thoroughfare used by their pirate ancestors when they brought home their spoil.  The green of the rank growth below, thought Val, seemed intensified by the strange yellowish light. A moss-grown path led straight into the heart of a jungle where sweet olive, banana trees, and palms grew in a matted mass. Harrison might have done wonders for the house but he had allowed the garden to lapse into a wilderness.  \"Val!\"  \"Coming!\" he shouted and pushed back through the curtain. He could hear Rupert moving about the"]]]
