The fractured leg knit slowly, though the physician was amazed at the speed with which, considering his age, he made recovery, and with his unfailing cheerfulness. He did not know, of course, that he was being assisted by an invisible nurse. For all that, however, the leaves on the oaks around \"Greyrock\" were green again before Colonel Hampton could leave his bed and hobble about the house on a cane.  Arthur, the young Negro who had driven the jeep, had become one of the most solid pillars of the little A.M.E. church beyond the village, as a result. Sergeant Williamson had also become an attendant at church for a while, and then stopped. Without being able to define, or spell, or even pronounce the term, Sergeant Williamson was a strict pragmatist. Most Africans are, even five generations removed from the slave-ship that brought their forefathers from the Dark Continent. And Sergeant Williamson could not find the blessedness at the church. Instead, it seemed to center about the room where his employer and former regiment commander lay. That, to his mind, was quite reasonable. If an Angel of the Lord was going to tarry upon earth, the celestial being would naturally prefer the society of a retired U.S.A. colonel to that of a passel of triflin', no-'counts at an ol' clapboard church house. Be that as it may, he could always find the blessedness in Colonel Hampton's room, and sometimes, when the Colonel would be asleep, the blessedness would follow him out and linger with him for a while.         *       *       *       *       *  Colonel Hampton wondered, anxiously, where Dearest was, now. He had not felt her presence since his nephew had brought his lawyer and the psychiatrist into the house. He wondered if she had voluntarily separated herself from him for fear he might give her some sign of recognition that these harpies would fasten upon as an evidence of unsound mind. He could not believe that she had deserted him entirely, now when he needed her most....  \"Well, what can I do?\" Doctor Vehrner was complaining. \"You bring me here to interview him, and he just sits there and does nothing.... Will you consent to my giving him an injection of sodium pentathol?\"  \"Well, I don't know, now,\" T. Barnwell Powell objected. \"I've heard of that drug--one of the so-called 'truth-serum' drugs. I doubt if testimony taken under its influence would be admissible in a court....\"  \"This is not a court, Mr. Powell,\" the doctor explained patiently. \"And I am not taking testimony; I am making a diagnosis. Pentathol is a recognized diagnostic agent.\"  \"Go ahead,\" Stephen Hampton said. \"Anything to get this over with.... You agree, Myra?\"  Myra said nothing. She simply sat, with staring eyes, and clutched the arms of her chair as though to keep from slipping into some dreadful abyss. Once a low moan escaped from her lips.  \"My wife is naturally overwrought by this painful business,\" Stephen said. \"I trust that you gentlemen will excuse her.... Hadn't you better go and lie down somewhere, Myra?\"  She shook her head violently, moaning again. Both the doctor and the attorney were looking at her curiously.  \"Well, I object to being drugged,\" Colonel Hampton said, rising. \"And what's more, I won't submit to it.\"  \"Albert!\" Doctor Vehrner said sharply, nodding toward the Colonel. The pithecanthropoid attendant in the white jacket hastened forward, pinned his arms behind him and dragged him down into the chair. For an instant, the old man tried to resist, then, realizing the futility and undignity of struggling, subsided. The psychiatrist had taken a leather case from his pocket and was selecting a hypodermic needle.  Then Myra Hampton leaped to her feet, her face working hideously.  \"No! Stop! Stop!\" she cried.  Everybody looked at her in surprise, Colonel Hampton no less than the others. Stephen Hampton called out her name sharply.  \"No! You shan't do this to me! You shan't! You're torturing me! you are all devils!\" she screamed. \"Devils! _Devils!_\"  \"Myra!\" her husband barked, stepping forward.  With a twist, she eluded him, dashing around the desk and pulling open a drawer.  For an instant, she fumbled inside it, and when she brought her hand up, she had Colonel Hampton's .45 automatic in it. She drew back the slide and released it, loading the chamber.  Doctor Vehrner, the hypodermic in his hand, turned. Stephen Hampton sprang at her, dropping his drink. And Albert, the prognathous attendant, released Colonel Hampton and leaped at the woman with the pistol, with the unthinking promptness of a dog whose master is in danger.  Stephen Hampton was the closest to her; she shot him first, point-blank in the chest. The heavy bullet knocked him backward against a small table; he and it fell over together. While he was falling, the woman turned, dipped the muzzle of her pistol slightly and fired again; Doctor Vehrner's leg gave way under him and he went down, the hypodermic flying from his hand and landing at Colonel Hampton's feet. At the same time, the attendant, Albert, was almost upon her. Quickly, she reversed the heavy Colt, pressed the muzzle against her heart, and fired a third shot.  T. Barnwell Powell had let the briefcase slip to the floor; he was staring, slack-jawed, at the tableau of violence which had been enacted before him. The attendant, having reached Myra, was looking down at her stupidly. Then he stooped, and straightened.  \"She's dead!\" he said, unbelievingly.  Colonel Hampton rose, putting his heel on the hypodermic and crushing it.  \"Of course she's dead!\" he barked. \"You have any first-aid training? Then look after these other people. Doctor Vehrner first; the other man's unconscious; he'll wait.\"  \"No; look after the other man first,\" Doctor Vehrner said.  Albert gaped back and forth between them.  \"Goddammit, you heard me!\" Colonel Hampton roared. It was Slaughterhouse Hampton, whose service-ribbons started with the Indian campaigns, speaking; an officer who never for an instant imagined that his orders would not be obeyed. \"Get a tourniquet on that man's leg, you!\" He moderated his voice and manner about half a degree and spoke to Vehrner. \"You are not the doctor, you're the patient, now. You'll do as you're told. Don't you know that a man shot in the leg with a .45 can bleed to death without half trying?\"  \"Yo'-all do like de Cunnel says, 'r foh Gawd, yo'-all gwine wish yo' had,\" Sergeant Williamson said, entering the room. \"Git a move on.\"  He stood just inside the doorway, holding a silver-banded malacca walking-stick that he had taken from the hall-stand. He was grasping it in his left hand, below the band, with the crook out, holding it at his side as though it were a sword in a scabbard, which was exactly what that walking-stick was. Albert looked at him, and then back at Colonel Hampton. Then, whipping off his necktie, he went down on his knees beside Doctor Vehrner, skillfully applying the improvised tourniquet, twisting it tight with an eighteen-inch ruler the Colonel took from the desk and handed to him.  \"Go get the first-aid kit, Sergeant,\" the Colonel said. \"And hurry. Mr. Stephen's been shot, too.\"  \"Yessuh!\" Sergeant Williamson executed an automatic salute and about-face and raced from the room. The Colonel picked up the telephone on the desk.  The County Hospital was three miles from \"Greyrock\"; the State Police substation a good five. He dialed the State Police number first.  \"Sergeant Mallard? Colonel Hampton, at 'Greyrock.' We've had a little trouble here. My nephew's wife just went _juramentado_ with one of my pistols, shot and wounded her husband and another man, and then shot and killed herself.... Yes, indeed it is, Sergeant. I wish you'd send somebody over here, as soon as possible, to take charge.... Oh, you will? That's good.... No, it's all over, and nobody to arrest; just the formalities.... Well, thank you, Sergeant.\"  The old Negro cavalryman re-entered the room, without the sword-cane and carrying a heavy leather box on a strap over his shoulder. He set this on the floor and opened it, then knelt beside Stephen Hampton. The Colonel was calling the hospital.  \"... gunshot wounds,\" he was saying. \"One man in the chest and the other in the leg, both with a .45 pistol. And you'd better send a doctor who's qualified to write a death certificate; there was a woman killed, too.... Yes, certainly; the State Police have been notified.\"  \"Dis ain' so bad, Cunnel,\" Sergeant Williamson raised his head to say. \"Ah's seen men shot wuss'n dis dat was ma'ked 'Duty' inside a month, suh.\"  Colonel Hampton nodded. \"Well, get him fixed up as best you can, till the ambulance gets here. And there's whiskey and glasses on that table, over there. Better give Doctor Vehrner a drink.\" He looked at T. Barnwell Powell, still frozen to his chair, aghast at the carnage around him. \"And give Mr. Powell a drink, too. He needs one.\"  He did, indeed. Colonel Hampton could have used a drink, too; the library looked like beef-day at an Indian agency. But he was still Slaughterhouse Hampton, and consequently could not afford to exhibit queasiness.  It was then, for the first time since the business had started that he felt the presence of Dearest.  \"Oh, Popsy, are you all right?\" the voice inside his head was asking. \"It's all over, now; you won't have anything to worry about, any more. But, oh, I was afraid I wouldn't be able to do it!\"  \"My God, Dearest!\" He almost spoke aloud. \"Did you make her do that?\"  \"Popsy!\" The voice in his mind was grief-stricken. \"You.... You're afraid of me! Never be afraid of Dearest, Popsy! And don't hate me for this. It was the only thing I could do.

Γελῶ δὲ ὁρῶν γῆς περιόδος γράψαντας, πολλοὺς ἤδη καὶ οὐδένα νόον ἔχοντας ἐξηγησάμενον ὃι Ὠκεανόν τε ῥεόντα γράφουσι, πέριξ τήν τε γὴν ἐοῦσαν κυκλοτερέα ὡς ἀπὸ τόρνου.

Such was Saint _Austin_ who censures that relation of the Antipodes to be an incredible fable,[1] and with him agrees the eloquent _Lactantius_,[2]    _quid illi qui esse contrarios vestigiis nostris Antipodes putant?   num aliquid loquuntur? aut est quispiam tam ineptus, qui credat esse   homines, quorum vestigia sunt superiora quàm capita? aut ibi quæ apud   nos jacent inversa pendere? fruges & arbores deorsum versus crescere,   pluvias & nives, & grandinem sursum versus cadere in terram? &   miratur aliquis hortor pensiles inter septem mira narrari, quum   Philosophi, & agros & maria, & urbes & montes pensiles faciunt? &c._    “What (saith he) are they that thinke there are Antipodes, such as   walke with their feet against ours? doe they speake any likelyhood?   or is there any one so foolish as to believe that there are men whose   heeles are higher than their heads? that things which with us doe lie   on the ground doe hang there? that the Plants and Trees grow   downewards, that the haile, and raine, and snow fall upwards to the   earth? and doe wee admire the hanging Orchards amongst the seven   wonders, whereas here the Philosophers have made the Field and Seas,   the Cities and Mountaines hanging.”  What shall wee thinke (saith hee in _Plutarch_) that men doe clyng to that place like wormes, or hang by their clawes as Cats, or if wee suppose a man a little beyond the Center, to bee digging with a spade? is it likely (as it must bee according to this opinion) that the earth which hee loosened, should of it selfe ascend upwards? or else suppose two men with their middles about the center, the feete of the one being placed where the head of the other is, and so two other men crosse them, yet all these men thus situated according to this opinion should stand upright, and many other such grosse consequences would follow (saith hee) which a false imagination is not able to fancy as possible. Upon which considerations, _Bede_[3] also denies the being of any Antipodes,    _Neque enim Antipodarum ullatenus est Fabulis accommodandus assensus_,  “Nor should wee any longer assent to the Fable of Antipodes.” So also _Lucretius_ the Poet speaking of the same subject, sayes:    _Sed vanus stolidis hæc omnia finxerit error._[4]    [Sidenote 1: _De civit. Dei. lib. 16. cap. 9._]    [Sidenote 2: _Institut. l. 3. c. 24._]    [Sidenote 3: _De ratione temporum, Cap. 32._]    [Sidenote 4: _De nat. rerum, lib. 1._]  That some idle fancy faigned these for fooles to believe. Of this opinion was _Procopius Gazæus_,[1] but he was perswaded to it by another kinde of reason; for he thought that all the earth under us was sunke in the water, according to the saying of the Psalmist,[2] Hee hath founded the Earth upon the Seas, and therefore hee accounted it not inhabited by any. Nay _Tostatus_ a man of later yeeres and generall learning doth also confidently deny that there are any such Antipodes, though the reason which hee urges for it bee not so absurde as the former, for the Apostles, saith hee,[3] travelled through the whole habitable world, but they never passed the Equinoctiall; and if you answer that they are said to goe through all the earth, because they went through all the knowne world, hee replies, that this is not sufficient, since Christ would have all men to be saved, and come to the knowledge of his truth,[4] and therefore ’tis requisite that they should have travelled thither also, if there had been any inhabitants, especially since he did expressely command them to goe and teach all nations, and preach the Gospell through the whole world,[5] and therefore he thinkes that as there are no men, so neither are there seas, or rivers, or any other conveniency for habitation: ’tis commonly related of one _Virgilius_, that he was excommunicated and condemned for a Heretique by _Zachary_ Bishop of _Rome_, because hee was not of the same opinion. But _Baronius_ saies,[6] it was because hee thought there was another habitable world within ours. How ever, you may well enough discerne in these examples how confident many of these great Schollars were in so grosse an errour, how unlikely, what an incredible thing it seemed to them, that there should be any Antipodes, and yet now this truth is as certaine and plaine, as sense or demonstration can make it. This then which I now deliver is not to be rejected; though it may seeme to contradict the common opinion.    [Sidenote 1: _Comment. in 1. Cap. Gen._]    [Sidenote 2: _Psal. 24. 2._]    [Sidenote 3: _Comment. in_ 1. Genes.]    [Sidenote 4: 1 Tim. 2. 4.]    [Sidenote 5: Mat. 28. 19]    [Sidenote 6: _Annal. Eccles. A.D. 748._]  2. Grosse absurdities have beene entertained by generall consent. I might instance in many remarkeable examples, but I will onely speake of the supposed labour of the Moone in her eclipses, because this is neerest to the chiefe matter in hand, and was received as a common opinion amongst many of the ancients, and therefore _Plutarch_ speaking of a Lunary eclipse, relates, that at such times ’twas a custome amongst the _Romanes_ (the most civill and learned people in the world) to sound brasse Instruments, and hold great torches toward the heaven. Τῶν δὲ Ρωμαίων (ὥσπερ ἐστω ἐνομισμένον) χαλκοῦ τε πατάγοις ἀνακαλουμένων τὸ φῶς αὐτὸς καὶ πυρὰ πολλὰ δαλοῖς καὶ δασσὶν ἀνεχόντων πρὸς τὸν οὐρανὸν,[1] for by this meanes they supposed the Moone was much eased in her labours, and therfore _Ovid_ calls such loud Instruments the auxiliaries or helpes of the Moone.[2]    _Cum frustra resonant æra auxiliaria Lunæ._  and therefore the Satyrist too describing a loud scold, saies, she was able to make noise enough to deliver the labouring Moone.[3]    _Vna laboranti poterit succurrere Lunæ._    [Sidenote 1: _In vita Paul. Æmil._]    [Sidenote 2: _Metam. l. 4._]    [Sidenote 3: _Iuven. Sat. 6_]  Now the reason of all this their ceremonie, was, because they feared the world would fall asleepe, when one of its eyes began to winke, and therefore they would doe what they could by loud sounds to rouse it from its drowsinesse, and keepe it awake by bright torches, to bestow that light upon it which it began to lose. Some of them thought hereby to keepe the Moone in her orbe, whereas otherwise she would have fallen downe upon the earth, and the world would have lost one of its lights, for the credulous people believed, that Inchanters, and Witches could bring the Moone downe, which made _Virgil_ say,    _Cantus & è cœlo possunt deducere Lunam._  And those Wizards knowing the times of her eclipses, would then threaten to shew their skill, by pulling her out of her orbe. So that when the silly multitude saw that she began to looke red, they presently feared they should lose the benefit of her light, and therefore made a great noise that she might not heare the sound of those Charmes, which would otherwise bring her downe, and this is rendered for a reason of this custome by _Pliny_ and _Propertius_:    _Cantus & è curru lunam deducere tentant,   Et facerent, si non æra repulsa sonent._[1]    [Sidenote 1: _Nat. hist. lib. 2. c. 12._]  _Plutarch_ gives another reason of it, and he sayes, ’tis because they would hasten the Moone out of the darke shade wherein shee was involv’d, that so she might bring away the soules of those Saints that inhabit within her, which cry out by reason they are then deprived of their wonted happinesse, and cannot heare the musicke of the Spheares, but are forced to behold the torments, and wailing of those damned soules which are represented to them as they are tortured in the region of the aire, but whether this or what ever else was the meaning of this superstition, yet certainly ’twas a very ridiculous custome, and bewrayed a great ignorance of those ancient times, especially since it was not onely received by the vulgar, such as were men of lesse note and learning, but believed also, by the more famous and wiser sort, such as were those great Poets, _Stesichorus_ and _Pindar_. And not onely amongst the more sottish heathens, who might account that Planet to be one of their Gods, but the primitive Christians also were in this kinde guilty; which made S. _Ambrose_ so tartly to rebuke those of his time, when he said,    _Tum turbatur carminibus Globus Lunæ, quando calicibus turbantur &   oculi_.  “When your heads are troubled with cups, then you thinke the Moone to be troubled with charmes.”  And for this reason also did _Maximus_ a Bishop,[1] write a Homily against it, wherein hee shewed the absurditie of that foolish superstition. I remember, that _Ludovicus Uives_ relates a more ridiculous story of a people that imprisoned an Asse for drinking up the Moone, whose image appearing in the water was covered with a cloud, as the Asse was drinking, for which the poore beast was afterward brought to the barre to receive a sentence according to his deserts, where the grave Senate being set to examine the matter, one of the Counsell (perhaps wiser than the rest) rises up, and out of his deepe judgement, thinkes it not fit that their Towne should lose its Moone, but that rather the Asse should be cut up, and that taken"]]]
