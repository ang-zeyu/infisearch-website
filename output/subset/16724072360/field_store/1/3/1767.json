Believing that I could thus save some days on the journey, I decided to go to Chungking on foot, and engaged a coolie to accompany me. We were to start on the Thursday afternoon; but about midnight on Wednesday I met Dr. Aldridge, of the Customs, who easily persuaded me that by taking the risk of going in a small boat (a _wupan_), and not in an ordinary passenger junk (a _kwatze_), I might, with luck, reach Chungking as soon by water as I could reach Wanhsien at half the distance by land. The Doctor was a man of surprising energy. He offered to arrange everything for me, and by 6 o'clock in the morning he had engaged a boat, had selected a captain (_laoban_), and a picked crew of four young men, who undertook to land me in Chungking in fifteen days, and had given them all necessary instructions for my journey. All was to be ready for a start the same evening.  During the course of the morning the written agreement was brought me by the laoban, drawn up in Chinese and duly signed, of which a Chinese clerk made me the following translation into English. I transcribe it literally:--  Yang Hsing Chung (the laoban) hereby contracts to convey Dr. M. to Chungking on the following conditions:--       1. The passage-money agreed upon is 28,000 cash (_Â£2 16s._),      which includes all charges.       2. If Chungking is reached in twelve days, Dr. M. will give      the master 32,500 cash instead; if in thirteen days 31,000,      and if in fifteen days 28,000.       3. If all goes well and the master does his duty      satisfactorily, Dr. M. will give him 30,000 cash, even if he      gets to Chungking in fifteen days.       4. The sum of 14,000 cash is to be advanced to the master      before starting; the remainder to be paid on arrival at      Chungking.                 (Signed)     YANG HSING CHUNG.    Dated the 17th day of the 2nd moon,           K, shui 20th year.  The Chinaman who wrote this in English speaks English better than many Englishmen.     CHAPTER II.  FROM ICHANG TO WANHSIEN, WITH SOME ACCOUNT OF CHINESE WOMEN AND THE RAPIDS OF THE YANGTSE KIANG.   The agreement was brought me in the morning; all the afternoon I was busy, and at 8 p.m. I embarked from the Customs pontoon. The boat was a wupan (five boards), 28 feet long and drawing 8 inches. Its sail was like the wing of a butterfly, with transverse ribs of light bamboo; its stern was shaped \"like a swallow's wings at rest.\" An improvised covering of mats amidships was my crib; and with spare mats, slipt during the day over the boat's hood, coverings could be made at night for'ard for my three men and aft for the other two. It seemed a frail little craft to face the dangers of the cataracts, but it was manned by as smart a crew of young Chinese as could be found on the river. It was pitch dark when we paddled into the stream amidst a discharge of crackers. As we passed under the _Kweili_, men were there to wish me _bon voyage_, and a revolver was emptied into the darkness to propitiate the river god.  We paddled up the bank under the sterns of countless junks, past the walled city, and then, crossing to the other bank, we made fast and waited for the morning to begin our journey. The lights of the city were down the river; all was quiet; my men were in good heart, and there was no doubt whatever that they would make every effort to fulfil their contract.  At daylight we were away again and soon entered the first of the great gorges where the river has cleft its way through the mountains.  With a clear and sunny sky, the river flowing smoothly and reflecting deeply the lofty and rugged hills which fall steeply to the water's edge, a light boat, and a model crew, it was a pleasure to lie at ease wrapped in my Chinese pukai and watch the many junks lazily falling down the river, the largest of them \"dwarfed by the colossal dimensions of the surrounding scenery to the size of sampans,\" and the fishing boats, noiseless but for the gentle creaking of the sheers and dip-net, silently working in the still waters under the bank.  At Ping-shan-pa there is an outstation of the Imperial Maritime Customs in charge of a seafaring man who was once a cockatoo farmer in South Australia, and drove the first team of bullocks to the Mount Brown diggings. He lives comfortably in a house-boat moored to the bank. He is one of the few Englishmen in China married in the English way, as distinct from the Chinese, to a Chinese girl. His wife is one of the prettiest girls that ever came out of Nanking, and talks English delightfully with a musical voice that is pleasant to listen to. I confess that I am one of those who agree with the missionary writer in regarding \"the smile of a Chinese woman as inexpressibly charming.\" I have seen girls in China who would be considered beautiful in any capital in Europe. The attractiveness of the Japanese lady has been the theme of many writers, but, speaking as an impartial observer who has been both in Japan and China, I have never been able to come to any other decision than that in every feature the Chinese woman is superior to her Japanese sister. She is head and shoulders above the Japanese; she is more intellectual, or, rather, she is more capable of intellectual development; she is incomparably more chaste and modest. She is prettier, sweeter, and more trustworthy than the misshapen cackling little dot with black teeth that we are asked to admire as a Japanese beauty. The traveller in China is early impressed by the contrast between the almost entire freedom from apparent immorality of the Chinese cities, especially of Western China, and the flaunting indecency of the _Yoshiwaras_ of Japan, with \"their teeming, seething, busy mass of women, whose virtue is industry and whose industry is vice.\"  The small feet of the Chinese women, though admired by the Chinese and poetically referred to by them as \"three-inch gold lilies,\" are in our eyes a very unpleasant deformity--but still, even with this deformity, the walk of the Chinese woman is more comely than the gait of the Japanese woman as she shambles ungracefully along with her little bent legs, scraping her wooden-soled slippers along the pavement with a noise that sets your teeth on edge. \"Girls are like flowers,\" say the Chinese, \"like the willow. It is very important that their feet should be bound short so that they can walk beautifully with mincing steps, swaying gracefully, and thus showing to all that they are persons of respectability.\" Apart from the Manchus, the dominant race, whose women do not bind their feet, all chaste Chinese girls have small feet. Those who have large feet are either, speaking generally, ladies of easy virtue or slave girls. And, of course, no Christian girl is allowed to have her feet bound.  [Illustration: ON A BALCONY IN WESTERN CHINA.]  Leaving Ping-shan-pa with a stiff breeze in our favour we slowly stemmed the current. Look at the current side, and you would think we were doing eight knots an hour or more, but look at the shore side, close to which we kept to escape as far as possible from the current, and you saw how gradually we felt our way along.  At a double row of mat sheds filled with huge coils of bamboo rope of all thicknesses, my laoban went ashore to purchase a towline; he took with him 1000 cash (about two shillings), and returned with a coil 100 yards in length and 600 cash of change. The rope he brought was made of plaited bamboo, was as thick as the middle finger, and as tough as whalebone.  The country was more open and terraced everywhere into gardens. Our progress was most satisfactory. When night came we drew into the bank, and I coiled up in my crib and made myself comfortable. Space was cramped, and I had barely room to stretch my legs. My cabin was 5 feet 6 inches square and 4 feet high, open behind, but with two little doors in front, out of which I could just manage to squeeze myself sideways round the mast. Coir matting was next the floor boards, then a thick Chinese quilt (a _pukai_), then a Scotch plaid made in Geelong. My pillow was Chinese, and the hardest part of the bed; my portmanteau was beside me and served as a desk; a Chinese candle, more wick than wax, stuck into a turnip, gave me light.  This, our first day's journey, brought us to within sound of the worst rapid on the river, the Hsintan, and the roar of the cataract hummed in our ears all night.  Early in the morning we were at the foot of the rapid under the bank on the opposite side of the river from the town of Hsintan. It was an exciting scene. A swirling torrent with a roar like thunder was frothing down the cataract. Above, barriers of rocks athwart the stream stretched like a weir across the river, damming the deep still water behind it. The shore was strewn with boulders. Groups of trackers were on the bank squatting on the rocks to see the foreign devil and his cockleshell. Other Chinese were standing where the side-stream is split by the boulders into narrow races, catching fish with great dexterity, dipping them out of the water with scoop-nets.  We rested in some smooth water under shelter and put out our towline; three of my boys jumped ashore and laid hold of it; another with his bamboo boat-hook stood on the bow; the laoban was at the tiller; and I was cooped up useless in the well under the awning. The men started hauling as we pushed out into the sea of waters. The boat quivered, the water leapt at the bow as if it would engulf us; our three men were obviously too few. The boat danced in the rapid. My men on board shrieked excitedly that the towrope was fouling--it had caught in a rock--but their voices could not be heard; our trackers were brought to with a jerk; the hindmost saw the foul and ran back to free it, but he was too late, for the boat had come beam on to the current.

There ain't another station in the world but this can pick him up!\"  \"NAA--NAA--NAA,\" came the call.  Throwing in his rheostat he sent an \"O.K\" in reply, and waited expectantly, pencil in hand. A moment more and he dropped his pencil in disgust.  \"Just another bug!\" he remarked aloud to the thermometer. \"Ought to be poisoned! What a whale of a wave length, though!\"  For several minutes he listened intently, for the amateur was sending insistently, repeating everything twice as if he meant business.  \"He's a jolly joker all right,\" muttered Hood, this time to the clock. \"Must be pretty hard up for something to do!\"  Then he laughed out loud and took up the pencil again. This amateur, whoever he was, was almost as good as his detective story. The \"bug\" called the Naval Observatory once more and began repeating his entire message for the third time.  \"To all mankind\"--he addressed himself modestly--\"To all mankind--To all mankind--I am the dictator--of human destiny--Through the earth's rotation--I control--day and night--summer and winter--I command the--cessation of hostilities and--the abolition of war upon the globe--I appoint the--United States--as my agent for this purpose--As evidence of my power I shall increase the length of the day--from midnight to midnight--of Thursday, July 22d, by the period of five minutes.--PAX.\"  The jolly joker, having repeated thus his extraordinary message to all mankind, stopped sending.  \"Well, I'll be hanged!\" gasped Bill Hood. Then he wound up his magnetic detector and sent an answering challenge into the ether.  \"Can--the--funny--stuff!\" he snapped. \"And tune out--or--we'll revoke--your license!\"  \"What a gall!\" he grunted, folding up the yellow sheet of pad paper upon which he had taken down the message to all mankind and thrusting it into his book for a marker. \"All the fools aren't dead yet!\"  Then he picked up the _Lincoln_ and got down to real work. The \"bug\" and his message passed from memory.     II   The following Thursday afternoon a perspiring and dusty stranger from St. Louis, who, with the Metropolitan Art Museum as his objective, was trudging wearily through Central Park, New York City, at two o'clock, paused to gaze with some interest at the obelisk known as Cleopatra's Needle. The heat rose in shimmering waves from the asphalt of the roadway, but the stranger was used to heat and he was conscientiously engaged in the duty of seeing New York. Opposite the Museum he seated himself upon a bench in the shade of a faded dogwood and wiped the moisture from his eyes. The glare from the unprotected boulevards was terrific. Under these somewhat unfavourable conditions he was occupied in studying the monument of Egypt's past magnificence when he felt a slight dragging sensation. It was indefinable and had no visual concomitant. But it was as though the brakes were being gently applied to a Pullman train. He was the only human being in the neighbourhood; not even a policeman was visible; and the experience gave him a creepy feeling. Then to his amazement Cleopatra's Needle slowly toppled from its pedestal and fell with a crash across the roadway. At first he thought it an optical illusion and wiped his eyes again, but it was nothing of the kind. The monument, which had a moment before pointed to the zenith, now lay shattered in three pieces upon the softening concrete of the drive. The stranger arose and examined the fragments of the monolith, one of which lay squarely across the road, barring all passage. Round the pedestal were scattered small pieces of broken granite, and from these, after looking about cautiously, he chose one with care and placed it in his pocket.  \"Gosh!\" he whispered to himself as he hurried toward Fifth Avenue. \"That'll just be something to tell 'em at home! Eh, Bill?\"  The dragging sensation experienced by the tourist from St. Louis was felt by many millions of people all over the world, but, as in most countries it occurred coincidently with pronounced earthquake shocks and tremblings, for the most part it passed unnoticed as a specific, individual phenomenon.  Hood, in the wireless room at Georgetown, suddenly heard in his receivers a roar like that of Niagara and quickly removed them from his ears. He had never known such statics. He was familiar with electrical disturbances in the ether, but this was beyond anything in his experience. Moreover, when he next tried to use his instruments he discovered that something had put the whole apparatus out of commission. About an hour later he felt a pronounced pressure in his eardrums, which gradually passed off. The wireless refused to work for nearly eight hours, and it was still recalcitrant when he went off duty at seven o'clock. He had not felt the quivering of the earth round Washington, and being an unimaginative man he accepted the other facts of the situation philosophically. The statics would pass, and then Georgetown would be in communication with the rest of the world again, that was all. At seven o'clock the night shift came in, and Hood borrowed a pipeful of tobacco from him and put on his coat.  \"Say, Bill, did you feel the shock?\" asked the shift, hanging up his hat and taking a match from Hood.  \"No,\" answered the latter, \"but the statics have put the machine on the blink. She'll come round all right in an hour or so. The air's gummy with ions. Shock, did you say?\"  \"Sure. Had 'em all over the country. Say, the boys at the magnetic observatory claim their compass shifted east and west instead of north and south, and stayed that way for five minutes. Didn't you feel the air pressure? I should worry! And say, I just dropped into the Meteorological Department's office and looked at the barometer. She'd jumped up half an inch in about two seconds, wiggled round some, and then come back to normal. You can see the curve yourself if you ask Fraser to show you the self-registering barograph. Some doin's, I tell you!\"  He nodded his head with an air of importance.  \"Take your word for it,\" answered Hood without emotion, save for a slight annoyance at the other's arrogation of superior information. \"'Tain't the first time there's been an earthquake since creation.\" And he strolled out, swinging to the doors behind him.  The night shift settled himself before the instruments with a look of dreary resignation.  \"Say,\" he muttered aloud, \"you couldn't jar that feller with a thirteen-inch bomb! He wouldn't even rub himself!\"  Hood, meantime, bought an evening paper and walked slowly to the district where he lived. It was a fine night and there was no particular excitement in the streets. His wife opened the door.  \"Well,\" she greeted him, \"I'm glad you've come home at last. I was plumb scared something had happened to you. Such a shaking and rumbling and rattling I never did hear! Did you feel it?\"  \"I didn't feel nothin'!\" answered Bill Hood. \"Some one said there was a shock, that was all I heard about it. The machine's out of kilter.\"  \"They won't blame you, will they?\" she asked anxiously.  \"You bet they won't!\" he replied. \"Look here, I'm hungry. Are the waffles ready?\"  \"Have 'em in a jiffy!\" she smiled. \"You go in and read your paper.\"  He did as he was directed, and seated himself in a rocker under the gaslight. After perusing the baseball news he turned back to the front page. The paper was a fairly late edition, containing up-to-the-minute telegraphic notes. In the centre column, alongside the announcement of the annihilation of three entire regiments of Silesians by the explosion of nitroglycerine concealed in dummy gun carriages, was the following:       CLEOPATRA'S NEEDLE FALLS       EARTHQUAKE DESTROYS FAMOUS MONUMENT       SHOCKS FELT HERE AND ALL OVER U. S.       Washington was visited by a succession of earthquake shocks early      this afternoon, which, in varying force, were felt throughout the      United States and Europe. Little damage was done, but those having      offices in tall buildings had an unpleasant experience which they      will not soon forget. A peculiar phenomenon accompanying this      seismic disturbance was the variation of the magnetic needle by over      eighty degrees from north to east and an extraordinary rise and fall      of the barometer. All wireless communication had to be abandoned,      owing to the ionizing of the atmosphere, and up to the time this      edition went to press had not been resumed. Telegrams by way of      Colon report similar disturbances in South America. In New York the      monument in Central Park known as Cleopatra's Needle was thrown from      its pedestal and broken into three pieces. The contract for its      repair and replacement has already been let. The famous monument was      a present from the Khedive of Egypt to the United States, and      formerly stood in Alexandria. The late William H. Vanderbilt      defrayed the expense of transporting it to this country.  Bill Hood read this with scant interest. The Giants had knocked the Braves' pitcher out of the box, and an earthquake seemed a small matter. His mind did not once revert to the mysterious message from Pax the day before. He was thinking of something far more important.  \"Say, Nellie,\" he demanded, tossing aside the paper impatiently, \"ain't those waffles ready yet?\"     III   On that same evening, Thursday, July 22d, two astronomers attached to the Naval Observatory sat in the half darkness of the meridian-circle room watching the firmament sweep slowly across the aperture of the giant lens. The chamber was as quiet as the grave, the two men rarely speaking as they noted their observations. Paris might be taken, Berlin be razed, London put to the torch; a million human beings might be blown into eternity, or the shrieks of mangled creatures lying in heaps before pellet-strewn barbed-wire entanglements "]]]
