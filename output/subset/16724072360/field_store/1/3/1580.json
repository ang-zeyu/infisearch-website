Political parties might provide the lamps, lay the wires and turn the current on to certain machinery, but the churches must be the power stations.  If the generating stations were destroyed, whatever the arrangements and plans of the political parties might be, it would not be long before the light was cut off from the homes of the people.  The doctrines taught by the churches are the _only_ security against the triumph of human selfishness, and human selfishness unchecked will destroy any plans, however perfect, which politicians may devise.  This period of history, to quote Gladstone, is \"an agitated and expectant age.\"  The world is travelling fast into a new era.  The modern social fabric, built on the shifting sands of selfishness and injustice is rocking on its foundations.  Amid accumulated ruins nations are searching for the basic principles of true Reconstruction. This period of unrest is in itself a challenge to Christianity, to the Church.  But the vitalizing force of Christianity can solve these problems of a decrepit civilization just as it solved the problem of tottering Rome.  Problems therefore must be faced and solved.  Every Catholic has his place in this world-wide work.  If our religion does not make its influence felt in every phase of our life's activities, it is--as far as our life and its influence on others is concerned--a gigantic fraud.  Bishop Kettler understood this pressing obligation when, breaking away from a too conservative programme of action, he was the first in the Church to give an impetus to the study of the modern social problem.  His policy and action were said to have prompted the celebrated letter of Leo III, _Rerum Novarum_.  The words of this great democratic Bishop still bear his timely message to Catholics of to-day, \"To save the souls of countless workmen entrusted to her by Christ, the Church must enter the field of Social reform, armed with extraordinary remedies.  She must exert herself to the utmost to rescue the workmen from a situation which constitutes a real proximate occasion of sin for them, a situation which makes it morally impossible for them to fulfill their duties as Christians.\"  \"The Church is bound to interfere '_ex caritate_,'\" as these workmen are in extreme need and cannot help themselves.  Otherwise, the unbelieving workingman will say to her: \"Of what use are your fine teachings to me?  What is the use of your referring me, by way of consolation, to the next world, if in this world you let me and my wife and my children perish with hunger?  You are not seeking my welfare, you are looking for something else.\"  Our fair and broad Dominion has not escaped from that spirit of unrest. Spasmodic eruptions in the East and in the West indicate the same central fires of the universal volcano upon which the world now sleeps uneasily.  Yet, various reasons have urged us to limit our investigation and reflections to Western Canada.  The predominating interests of the West have of late become more and more evident in the economic and political life of our country.  Lord Salisbury, when trouble was brewing on the far-flung border of India, gave to the people the famous warning \"Look at big maps.\"  To get a just appreciation of our mighty West we may well follow that same advice and \"look at big maps.\"  The sudden and rapid growth of our Prairie Provinces particularly, the unlimited and perennial resources of their fertile soil, the progressive spirit of the population have made of the West the land of great possibilities and mighty problems.  The future of our Country, the peace and prosperity of the nation depend to a great extent on the reasonable and just exploitation of these resources and on the adequate solution to these problems.  There is no place in Canada where problems develop more rapidly and meet with more radical solutions than in Western Canada.  This is the case in every young and prosperous country.  No dead are behind the living, to link the past to the future with the steadying influence of tradition.  Who has not heard of \"The Spirit of the West?\"  Broad in its vision, sympathetic and ambitious in its plans, over-confident in its powers and most aggressive in its policies, that spirit grips you as you pass beyond the Great Lakes into the unlimited horizons of the rolling prairies.  Those who have never experienced its secret influence, will never fully understand its tremendous power.  J. W. Dafoe, of the Manitoba Free Press, welcoming to the West the Members of the Imperial Press Conference (1920), assured them that they would observe in the West evidence \"of a newer Canadianism, the Canadianism of to-morrow; not hostile to the East, but, we think, a little better.\"  As the West has forced itself on the attention of our economic and political world, so also have its Religious problems loomed up many and great on the horizon of the Church.  The Catholic Church, there, as in many mission countries, is in process of formation: immense fields await the scythe of belated reapers.  Yet, notwithstanding this state of imperfect organization, the Church stands out as one of the great moral factors which outsiders are the first to respect, and politicians too willing at times to exploit.  Through her teachings and her children, she is bound to make the beneficial influence of her presence felt, even by her enemies.  Her teachings indeed create for her loyal children issues which have to be faced squarely and unflinchingly.  The influence of the Church on Society depends on the manner Catholics understand their social responsibilities and translate into action her doctrine.  We may well apply to the life of the Church in a country this biological truism: \"life consists in adaptation to environment.\" From a Catholic viewpoint Our West will be vitalized only in as much as the Catholics in Western Canada, thoroughly patriotic in their aspirations and thoroughly Catholic in their ideas and feelings, will bring their influence to bear on our national life.  Their example and their influence will lead to the silent and \"pacific penetration\" of the Society in which they live.  And the Catholics throughout Canada cannot stand aloof, disinterested in the upbuilding of the Western Provinces, where the Canada of to-morrow is being created.  There indeed the clash of ideals is more marked, the fermentation of thought is stronger, issues are more vital.  Our national life, to a great extent, will depend on how these conflicting elements are absorbed into the blood and sinews of the Country.  The problems on which we dwell are, in our humble estimation, of paramount importance and should arrest the attention and elicit the co-operation of every Catholic alive to their seriousness.  No doubt we have been sleeping at our posts.  Red lights spot the darkness of the future and speak of danger ahead if the problems upon which we dwell are not pressed home with constancy and energy, if some concerted action is not agreed upon.  Behind these problems lurk mighty issues. They strike at the very foundations of Christianity and Christian civilization, and cannot be disposed of by Parliament-Laws or Orders-in-Council.  We are a minority, some may say, and without influence.  Yes, we are a minority, but were we a militant minority, our ideas would make their way.  \"Small as the Catholic body was in England,\" said H. Belloc, \"it knew what it thought; it had a determined position.  That was of enormous importance.  A minority which was logical, reasonable, and united was a very much stronger thing than its mere numbers would suggest.\"  Did not the ideas of a few Oxford men revolutionize the Church of England and bring on a movement the results of which we still witness throughout the English-speaking world.  The men who see clear and far, who feel keenly and deeply will necessarily be leaders.  The hand that leads is always governed by a warm heart and a clear eye. \"Devotion is the child of conviction,\" said Lord Haldane.  The non-Catholic may be inclined to look upon our exposition of these Western Problems as a merely sectarian viewpoint, and therefore, of no value to him.  He may even look upon our work as an open challenge.  I would answer in Newman's words: \"_Our motive for writing has been the sight of the truth and the desire to show it to others._\"  The serious minded non-Catholic, whose soul has not been wholly warped by prejudice, will at least consider the Catholic Church as one of the great moral factors in the nation.  He will naturally wish to know the mind of the Church and the reasons for its stand in many problems common to all Canadians.  Our candid explanation will help to give him a better understanding of facts and a better appreciation of our position on issues to be faced by us all.  We are prompted by a sincere love for our Country in offering these solutions for the various issues with which we are confronted.  \"Preconceived opinions and inherited prejudices, particularly in religious matters tend to make men either blind or indifferent to the merits of systems other than their own.\" We do not expect our non-Catholic readers to see eye to eye with us in the discussion of the various problems under examination.  Our viewpoint is naturally the Catholic one.  But we do believe that the broad-minded Westerner is open to conviction and willing to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18378"],["title","Catholic Problems in Western Canada (#2)"],["body"," an argument on its face value.  'Give us a hearing' . . . . this is the burden of our message to our non-Catholic countrymen.  This book is not written in a spirit of controversy.  Were some to see it in this light, then I would claim for the author what Birrell said of Newman: \"He contrived to instil into his very controversy more of the spirit of Christ than most men can find room for in their prayers.\"  Moreover; we are persuaded that the great war has mellowed the minds of men and made them more receptive.  The contact with other countries has softened the contours of certain controversies and given to all a broader outlook.  However, should our arguments fail to prove satisfactory or should they give rise to contradiction, we would repeat here what Newman wrote in his Preface to \"Difficulties of Anglicans,\" \"It has not been our practice to engage in controversy with those who felt it their duty to criticise what at any time we have written; but that will not preclude us under present circumstances, from elucidating what is deficient in them by further observations, should questions be asked, which, either from the quarter whence they proceed, or from their intrinsic weight, have, according to our judgment, a claim upon our attention.\"  The problems we touch upon are of a general character.  They are not new, but the war and the loose and hysterical thinking which has accompanied and followed it, have forced them into startling prominence.  We have grouped them under three headings: _religious_, _educational_, and _social_.  We do not pretend to present an exhaustive treatment of the matter.  To do so, would be on our part a stroke of temerity and for the reader, an assured deception.  Human problems are ever the same.  The surface may be somewhat changed, the handling a little different, but the principles upon which depends their solution do not change.  Our effort is to throw a new light on old subjects.  To be of service to the Church, and, through Her to our Country, is the sole ambition we have had before us in gathering together in book-form stray sheaves of thought, published here and there, during the course of the last few years.  We are quite convinced that a clear vision of the problems facing the Church in Western Canada will awaken a sense of the responsibility which they entail for every Catholic in the land.  Our views and suggestions in the matter are but those of a humble soldier who belongs to the rank and file of the great Catholic army. But often a private in the firing line can suggest a plan of action which, when corrected or modified at headquarters, proves to be of some benefit to his battalion.  This explains the dedication of our humble effort to the Hierarchy of Canada.  For in problems which affect the Church, we would not lose sight of this supreme truth: \"The Holy Ghost has placed the Bishops to rule the Church of God, which He has purchased with His own blood.\"--  (Act XX, 28)  ST. PETERS RECTORY,   ST. JOHN, N.B.  On the Feast of the \"Immaculate Conception,\" December 8th, 1920.     PART I  RELIGIOUS PROBLEMS  \"It is surprising how at the bottom of every political problem we always find some theology involved.\"    --(Proudhom)     CHAPTER 1  THE CALL OF THE WEST[1]  _A Call from the West_  Who has not heard the call of the West?  Like the blast of the hunter's horn in the silent forest, its thrilling and inviting sound has awakened the echoes throughout the land.  Springing from the granite heart of our mighty Rockies, that call comes through their valleys, is heard over the \"Great Divide\" and whispers its way to the foothills. Soft as the evening breeze, strong as the howling blizzard, we hear it across the prairie, gathering as it were, on its triumphal march to the East, something of the immensity of the plains and freshness of the lakes.  In the din of our manufacturing cities, in the quietness of our towns and villages, by the rivers and winding bays of our Maritime Provinces, along the peaceful shores of the St. Lawrence, the call of the West has been heard.  Its alluring sound has cast a spell upon our youth, the hope of the country.  Faces flushed with the bright hues of life's dawn, eyes sparkling with the fires of early youth, instinctively turn to the West.  From all points of Eastern Canada young men and young women are leaving for that mysterious land of brilliant promise and great possibilities.  The Call of the West!  All Canada is eager to hear its message.  Has not the merchant his ear to the ground, listening to the throbbing of the growing harvest on our Western prairies?  He knows that in the furrows of that rich loam lie the wealth and prosperity of the country at large.  The Eastern manufacturer anxiously scans the daily paper to be posted on crop conditions in the West.  They regulate to a great extent the activities and output of his plant.  And when college and university days are over, where does the young professional man turn his eyes?  To the West.  Westward, with the sun, he travels; its fiery course is an invitation to and a harbinger of his bright career.  The Call of the West!  Across the ocean it has gone and awakened the dormant energies of old European nations.  Settlers of every race and creed have rushed to our shores, like the waves of \"the heaving and hurrying tide.\"  The attraction of the Canadian West has become general, at home and abroad.  Nothing can stop this onward march to the land of promise.  A new Canada is being created beyond the Great Lakes.  A very small fraction of the Western fertile soil is under cultivation and already the phenomenal yield has prompted the nations at large to call the Prairie Provinces \"the granary of the world.\"  Already in Canada the industrial, commercial, and to a great extent, the political world hinges on the Western crop.  It is the great source of Canada's national wealth.  For, the prodigious resources of our mines and forests, and the annual yield of our harvest are the two poles upon which revolves the credit of our country abroad.  But the growing value of the West to the economic and national life of Canada is a mere shadow of its increasing importance in the religious world.  Above the hum of the binders and loud clatter of the threshing machines, above the sharp voice of the shrieking steel rail, counting, as it were, one by one, the freighted cars on their way to the Eastern ports, above the clamor of commerce and industry, ring out the voices of immortal souls. The West, for the Church of God also is the land of great possibilities and brilliant promise.  The waving sea of its wheat fields calls to mind the words of the Master: \"Lift up your eyes and see the countries ready for the harvest. . . .  The harvest is great indeed but the labourers are few. . . .\"  On his return from a visit to our Canadian West Cardinal Bourne, in the course of conversation, spoke of Canada with almost exclusive reference to the Western Provinces.  Some one remarked to him, \"Your Grace is referring to conditions in the West?\"  \"Yes, the West, the West is Canada!\" he replied.  No one can over-estimate the importance of the West from a Catholic standpoint.  It is a new empire that is being formed beyond the Lakes, an empire with tremendous and perennial resources, with ambitious ideals and progressive policies, with forward-looking people and youthful leaders.  There the ultra-conservatism of the East has been brushed aside and space made for a new democracy.  The question of paramount importance for us is: \"What will be the condition of the Church in that coming part of Canada?  What share will She have in the solving of the social, educational and economic problems of that new domain?\"  Every Catholic should be interested in this vital issue.  The call of the West for a Catholic is the call of the Church, the call of a Mother to a loyal son.  She has a right to a hearty response from every Catholic throughout our broad Dominion.  It is, therefore, a duty of conscience for every son of the Church in Canada to come to the assistance of his mother, to take her honor to heart.  At the present hour this duty is most imperative, this obligation most pressing. There is nothing in the wide sphere of our Catholic social duties so immediate in its urgency or so far reaching in its consequences.  The Church depends on the loyalty of her children.  To bring this call of our Western missions to the attention of every individual Catholic, to make every soul a co-operator in the extension of God's kingdom in Canada, to develop that sense of responsibility which makes one consider the Church's business his own business, to rally our disbanded forces, to unite our sporadic efforts around the great work of the \"Catholic Church Extension Society of Canada\"--such is the object of these few pages.  To place facts before the reader, and suggest remedies; to sound the call of the West, loud and sonorous as the bugle pealing a great \"_reveille_,\" strong and clear as the trumpet blast that stirs the blood; to prompt a timely and generous response in the East, by uniting the Church of Canada in a crusade of prayers and sacrifices for our Western Missions: this is our aim and hopeful ambition.   _The Call of the Catholic Church in the West_  The call of the Church in the West is a cry for help.  Great indeed are the pressing needs of the Western Church, for numerous and various are the difficulties with which Catholics have to contend on the prairie and in the small towns.  The first barrier to surmount is _distance_.  The very layout of the country is to a great extent a hindrance to the efficient working of a parish.  The survey of the land has been made from a strictly economic point of view.  Large farms,--vast wheat fields--were the final object of the survey.  The social, educational, and religious phases of the situation are in the background.  This renders church and school problems particularly difficult to solve, as"]]]
