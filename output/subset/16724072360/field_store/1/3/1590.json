For what we know of the first _formulated_ human prayer and praise we are mostly indebted to the Hebrew race. They seem to have been at least the only ancient nation that had a complete psalter--and their collection is the mother hymn-book of the world.  Probably the first form of hymn-worship was the plain-song--a declamatory unison of assembled singers, every voice on the same pitch, and within the compass of five notes--and so continued, from whatever may have stood for plain-song in Tabernacle and Temple days down to the earliest centuries of the Christian church. It was mere melodic progression and volume of tone, and there were no instruments--after the captivity. Possibly it was the memory of the harps hung silent by the rivers of Babylon that banished the timbrel from the sacred march and the ancient lyre from the post-exilic synagogues. Only the Feast trumpet was left. But the Jews sang. Jesus and his disciples sang. Paul and Silas sang; and so did the post-apostolic Christians; but until towards the close of the 16th century there were no instruments allowed in religious worship.  St. Hilary, Bishop of Poitiers has been called \"the father of Christian hymnology.\" About the middle of the 4th century he regulated the ecclesiastical song-service, wrote chant music (to Scripture words or his own) and prescribed its place and use in his choirs. He died A.D. 368. In the Church calendars, Jan. 13th (following \"Twelfth Night\"), is still kept as \"St. Hilary's Day\" in the Church of England, and Jan. 14th in the Church of Rome.  St. Ambrose, Bishop of Milan, a few years later, improved the work of his predecessor, adding words and music of his own. The \"Ambrosian Chant\" was the antiphonal plain-song arranged and systematized to statelier effect in choral symphony. Ambrose died A.D. 397.  Toward the end of the 6th century Christian music showed a decline in consequence of impatient meddling with the slow canonical psalmody, and \"reformers\" had impaired its solemnity by introducing fanciful embellishments. Gregory the Great (Pope of Rome, 590-604) banished these from the song service, founded a school of sacred melody, composed new chants and established the distinctive character of ecclesiastical hymn worship. The Gregorian chant--on the diatonic eight sounds and seven syllables of equal length--continued, with its majestic choral step, to be the basis of cathedral music for a thousand years. In the meantime (930) Hucbald, the Flanders monk, invented _sight_ music, or written notes--happily called the art of \"hearing with the eyes and seeing with the ears\"; and Guido Arentino (1024) contrived the present scale, or the \"hexachord\" on which the present scale was perfected.  In this long interval, however, the \"established\" system of hymn service did not escape the intrusion of inevitable novelties that crept in with the change of popular taste. Unrhythmical singing could not always hold its own; and when polyphonic music came into public favor, secular airs gradually found their way into the choirs. Legatos, with their pleasing turn and glide, caught the ear of the multitude. Tripping allegrettos sounded sweeter to the vulgar sense than the old largos of Pope Gregory the Great.  The guardians of the ancient order took alarm. One can imagine the pained amazement of conservative souls today on hearing \"Ring the Bells of Heaven\" substituted in church for \"Mear\" or the long-metre Doxology, and can understand the extreme distaste of the ecclesiastical reactionaries for the worldly frivolities of an A.D. 1550 choir. Presumably that modern abomination, the _vibrato_, with its shake of artificial fright, had not been invented then, and sanctuary form was saved one indignity. But the innovations became an abuse so general that the Council of Trent commissioned a select board of cardinals and musicians to arrest the degeneration of church song-worship.  One of the experts consulted in this movement was an eminent Italian composer born twenty miles from Rome. His full name was Giovanni Pietro Aloysio da Palestrina, and at that time he was in the prime of his powers. He was master of polyphonic music as well as plain-song, and he proposed applying it to grace the older mode, preserving the solemn beauty of the chant but adding the charming chords of counterpoint. He wrote three \"masses,\" one of them being his famous \"Requiem.\" These were sung under his direction before the Commission. Their magnificence and purity revealed to the censors the possibilities of contrapuntal music in sanctuary devotion and praise. The sanction of the cardinals was given--and part-song harmony became permanently one of the angel voices of the Christian church.  Palestrina died in 1594, but hymn-tunes adapted from his motets and masses are sung today. He was the father of the choral tune. He lived to see musical instruments and congregational singing introduced[1] in public worship, and to know (possibly with secret pleasure, though he was a Romanist) how richly in popular assemblies, during the Protestant Reformation, the new freedom of his helpful art had multiplied the creation of spiritual hymns.  [Footnote 1: But not fully established in use till about 1625.]  Contemporary in England with Palestrina in Italy was Thomas Tallis who developed the Anglican school of church music, which differed less from the Italian (or Catholic) psalmody than that of the Continental churches, where the revolt of the Reformation extended to the tune-worship as notably as to the sacraments and sermons. This difference created a division of method and practice even in England, and extreme Protestants who repudiated everything artistic or ornate formed the Puritan or Genevan School. Their style is represented among our hymn-tunes by \"Old Hundred,\" while the representative of the Anglican is \"Tallis' Evening Hymn.\" The division was only temporary. The two schools were gradually reconciled, and together made the model after which the best sacred tunes are built. It is Tallis who is called \"The father of English Cathedral music.\"  In Germany, after the invention of harmony, church music was still felt to be too formal for a working force, and there was a reaction against the motets and masses of Palestrina as being too stately and difficult. Lighter airs of the popular sort, such as were sung between the acts of the \"mystery plays,\" were subsidized by Luther, who wrote compositions and translations to their measure. Part-song was simplified, and Johan Walther compiled a hymnal of religious songs in the vernacular for from four to six voices. The reign of rhythmic hymn music soon extended through Europe.  Necessarily--except in ultra-conservative localities like Scotland--the exclusive use of the Psalms (metrical or unmetrical) gave way to religious lyrics inspired by occasion. Clement Marot and Theodore Beza wrote hymns to the music of various composers, and Caesar Malan composed both hymns and their melodies. By the beginning of the 18th century the triumph of the hymn-tune and the hymnal for lay voices was established for all time.         *       *       *       *       *  In the following pages no pretence is made of selecting _all_ the best and most-used hymns, but the purpose has been to notice as many as possible of the standard pieces--and a few others which seem to add or re-shape a useful thought or introduce a new strain.  To present each hymn _with its tune_ appeared the natural and most satisfactory way, as in most cases it is impossible to dissociate the two. The melody is the psychological coëfficient of the metrical text. Without it the verse of a seraph would be smothered praise. Like a flower and its fragrance, hymn and tune are one creature, and stand for a whole value and a full effect. With this normal combination a _complete_ descriptive list of the hymns and tunes would be a historic dictionary. Such a book may one day be made, but the present volume is an attempt to the same end within easier limits.     CHAPTER I.  HYMNS OF PRAISE AND WORSHIP.   \"TE DEUM LAUDAMUS.\"  This famous church confession in song was composed A.D. 387 by Ambrose, Bishop of Milan, probably both words and music.      Te Deum laudamus, Te Dominum confitemur     Te aeternum Patrem omnis terra veneratur     Tibi omnes angeli, tibi coeli et universae potestates,     Tibi cherubim et seraphim inaccessibili voce proclamant     Sanctus, sanctus Dominus Deus Sabaoth.  In the whole hymn there are thirty lines. The saying that the early Roman hymns were echoes of Christian Greece, as the Greek hymns were echoes of Jerusalem, is probably true, but they were only echoes. In A.D. 252, St. Cyprian, writing his consolatory epistle[2] during the plague in Carthage, when hundreds were dying every day, says, \"Ah, perfect and perpetual bliss! [in heaven.] There is the glorious company of the apostles; there is the fellowship of the prophets rejoicing; there is the innumerable multitude of martyrs crowned.\" Which would suggest that lines or fragments of what afterwards crystalized into the formula of the \"Te Deum\" were already familiar in the Christian church. But it is generally believed that the tongue of Ambrose gave the anthem its final form.  [Footnote 2: [Greek: Peri tou thnêtou], \"On the Mortality.\"]  Ambrose was born in Gaul about the middle of the fourth century and raised to his bishopric in A.D. 374. Very early he saw and appreciated the popular effect of musical sounds, and what "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18444"],["title","The Story of the Hymns and Tunes (#2)"],["body","evangelical instrument a chorus of chanting voices could be in preaching the Christian faith; and he introduced the responsive singing of psalms and sacred cantos in the worship of the church. \"A grand thing is that singing, and nothing can stand before it,\" he said, when the critics of his time complained that his innovation was sensational. That such a charge could be made against the Ambrosian mode of music, with its slow movement and unmetrical lines, seems strange to us, but it was _new_--and conservatism is the same in all ages.  The great bishop carried all before him. His school of song-worship prevailed in Christian Europe more than two hundred years. Most of his hymns are lost, (the Benedictine writers credit him with twelve), but, judging by their effect on the powerful mind of Augustine, their influence among the common people must have been profound, and far more lasting than the author's life. \"Their voices sank into mine ears, and their truths distilled into my heart,\" wrote Augustine, long afterwards, of these hymns; \"tears ran down, and I rejoiced in them.\"  Poetic tradition has dramatized the story of the birth of the \"Te Deum,\" dating it on an Easter Sunday, and dividing the honor of its composition between Ambrose and his most eminent convert. It was the day when the bishop baptized Augustine, in the presence of a vast throng that crowded the Basilica of Milan. As if foreseeing with a prophet's eye that his brilliant candidate would become one of the ruling stars of Christendom, Ambrose lifted his hands to heaven and chanted in a holy rapture,--      We praise Thee, O God! We acknowledge Thee to be the Lord;     All the Earth doth worship Thee, the Father Everlasting.  He paused, and from the lips of the baptized disciple came the response,--      To Thee all the angels cry aloud: the heavens and all the powers         therein.     To Thee cherubim and seraphim continually do cry,    \"Holy, holy, holy Lord God of Sabaoth;     Heaven and Earth are full of the majesty of Thy glory!\"  and so, stave by stave, in alternating strains, sprang that day from the inspired lips of Ambrose and Augustine the \"Te Deum Laudamus,\" which has ever since been the standard anthem of Christian praise.  Whatever the foundation of the story, we may at least suppose the first public singing[3] of the great chant to have been associated with that eventful baptism.  [Footnote 3: The \"Te Deum\" was first sung _in English_ by the martyr, Bishop Ridley, at Hearne Church, where he was at one time vicar.]  The various anthems, sentences and motets in all Christian languages bearing the titles \"Trisagion\" or \"Tersanctus,\" and \"Te Deum\" are taken from portions of this royal hymn. The sublime and beautiful \"Holy, Holy, Holy\" of Bishop Heber was suggested by it.   _THE TUNE._  No echo remains, so far as is known, of the responsive chant actually sung by Ambrose, but one of the best modern choral renderings of the \"Te Deum\" is the one by Henry Smart in his _Morning and Evening Service_. In an ordinary church hymnal it occupies seven pages. The staff-directions with the music indicate the part or cue of the antiphonal singers by the words Decani (Dec.) and Cantor (Can.), meaning first the division of the choir on the Dean's side, and second the division on the Cantor's or Precentor's side.  Henry Smart was one of the five great English composers that followed our American Mason. He was born in London, Oct. 25, 1812, and chose music for a profession in preference to an offered commission in the East Indian army. His talent as a composer, especially of sacred music, was marvellous, and, though he became blind, his loss of sight was no more hindrance to his genius than loss of hearing to Beethoven.  No composer of his time equalled Henry Smart as a writer of music for female voices. His cantatas have been greatly admired, and his hymn tunes are unsurpassed for their purity and sweetness, while his anthems, his oratorio of \"Jacob,\" and indeed all that he wrote, show the hand and the inventive gift of a great musical artist.  He died July 10, 1879, universally mourned for his inspired work, and his amiable character.   \"ALL GLORY, LAUD AND HONOR.\" _Gloria, Laus et Honor._  This stately Latin hymn of the early part of the 9th century was composed in A.D. 820, by Theodulph, Bishop of Orleans, while a captive in the cloister of Anjou. King Louis (le Debonnaire) son of Charlemagne, had trouble with his royal relatives, and suspecting Theodulph to be in sympathy with them, shut him up in prison. A pretty story told by Clichtovius, an old church writer of A.D. 1518, relates how on Palm Sunday the king, celebrating the feast with his people, passed in procession before the cloister, where the face of the venerable prisoner at his cell window caused an involuntary halt, and, in the moment of silence, the bishop raised his voice and sang this hymn; and how the delighted king released the singer, and restored him to his bishopric. This tale, told after seven hundred years, is not the only legend that grew around the hymn and its author, but the fact that he composed it in the cloister of Anjou while confined there is not seriously disputed.      Gloria, laus et honor Tibi sit, Rex Christe Redemptor,     Cui puerile decus prompsit Hosanna pium.     Israel Tu Rex, Davidis et inclyta proles,     Nomine qui in Domini Rex benedicte venis                                Gloria, laus et honor.  Theodulph was born in Spain, but of Gothic pedigree, a child of the race of conquerors who, in the 5th century, overran Southern Europe. He died in 821, but whether a free man or still a prisoner at the time of his death is uncertain. Some accounts allege that he was poisoned in the cloister. The Roman church canonized him, and his hymn is still sung as a processional in Protestant as well as Catholic churches. The above Latin lines are the first four of the original seventy-eight. The following is J.M. Neale's translation of the portion now in use:      All glory, laud, and honor,       To Thee, Redeemer, King:     To whom the lips of children       Made sweet Hosannas ring.      Thou are the King of Israel,       Thou David's royal Son,     Who in the Lord's name comest,       The King and Blessed One.    All glory, etc.      The company of angels       Are praising Thee on high;     And mortal men, and all things       Created, make reply.         All glory, etc.      The people of the Hebrews       With palms before Thee went;     Our praise and prayer and anthems       Before Thee we present.      All glory, etc.      To Thee before Thy Passion       They sang their hymns of praise;     To Thee, now high exalted       Our melody we raise.         All glory, etc.      Thou didst accept their praises;       Accept the prayers we bring,     Who in all good delightest,       Thou good and gracious King. All glory, etc.  The translator, Rev. John Mason Neale, D.D., was born in London, Jan. 24, 1818, and graduated at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1840. He was a prolific writer, and after taking holy orders he held the office of Warden of Sackville College, East Grimstead, Sussex. Best known among his published works are _Mediæval Hymns and Sequences_, _Hymns for Children_, _Hymns of the Eastern Church_ and _The Rhythms of Morlaix_. He died Aug. 6, 1866.   _THE TUNE._  There is no certainty as to the original tune of Theodulph's Hymn, or how long it survived, but various modern composers have given it music in more or less keeping with its character, notably Melchior Teschner, whose harmony, \"St. Theodulph,\" appears in the new _Methodist Hymnal_. It well represents the march of the bishop's Latin.  Melchior Teschner, a Prussian musician, was Precentor at Frauenstadt, Silesia, about 1613.   \"ALL PRAISE TO THEE, ETERNAL LORD.\" _Gelobet Seist du Jesu Christ._  This introductory hymn of worship, a favorite Christmas hymn in Germany, is ancient, and appears to be a versification of a Latin prose \"Sequence\" variously ascribed to a 9th century author, and to Gregory the Great in the 6th century. Its German form is still credited to Luther in most hymnals. Julian gives an earlier German form (1370) of the \"Gelobet,\" but attributes all but the first stanza to Luther, as the hymn now stands. The following translation, printed first in the _Sabbath Hymn Book_, Andover, 1858, is the one adopted by Schaff in his _Christ in Song_:      All praise to Thee, eternal Lord,     Clothed in the garb of flesh and blood;     Choosing a manger for Thy throne,     While worlds on worlds are Thine alone!      Once did the skies before Thee bow;     A virgin's arms contain Thee now;     Angels, who did in Thee rejoice,     Now listen for Thine infant voice.      A little child, Thou art our guest,     That weary ones in Thee may rest;     Forlorn and lowly in Thy birth,     That we may rise to heaven from earth.      Thou comest in the darksome night,     To make us children of the light;     To make us, in the realms divine,     Like Thine own angels round Thee shine.      All this for us Thy love hath done:     By this to Thee our love is won;     For this we tune our cheerful lays,     And shout our thanks in endless praise.   _THE TUNE._  The 18th century tune of \"Weimar\" (_Evangelical Hymnal_), by Emanuel Bach, suits the spiritual tone of the hymn, and suggests the Gregorian dignity of its origin.  Karl Philip Emanuel Bach, called \"the Berlin Bach\" to distinguish him from his father, the great Sebastian Bach of Saxe Weimar, was born in Weimar, March 14, 1714. He early devoted himself to music, and coming to Berlin when twenty-four years old was appointed Chamber musician (Kammer Musicus) in the Royal Chapel, where he often accompanied Frederick the Great (who was an accomplished flutist) on the harpsichord. His most numerous compositions were piano music but he wrote a celebrated \"Sanctus,\" and two oratorios, besides a number of chorals, of which \"Weimar\" is one. He died in"]]]
