Mus., Add. mss., 11695). The original, gorgeously   coloured, represents the crudest of Christian and Moslem   notions of the world. Even more crude than in the Turin   map and the Mappe-Monde of St. Sever, both of which offer   some resemblances to this. The earth is represented as of   quadrangular shape, surrounded by the ocean. At the E.   is Paradise with the figures of the Temptation. A part of   the S. is cut off by the Red Sea, which is straight (and   coloured red), just as the straight Mediterranean, with its   quadrangular islands, divides the N.W. quarter, or Europe,   from the S.W. quarter, or Africa. The Ægean Sea joins   the Mediterranean at a right angle, in the centre of the   map. In the ocean, bordering the whole, are square   islands, _e.g._, Tile (Thule), Britania, Scocia,   Fu(o)rtunarum insula. The Turin map occurs in another   copy of the same work--_A Commentary on the Apocalypse_.     THE PSALTER MAP OF THE 13TH CENTURY                      92    (B. Mus., Add. mss., 28, 681). A good illustration of   the circular type of mediæval map, which is sometimes   little better than a panorama of legends and monsters.   Christ at the top; the dragons crushed beneath him at the   bottom; Jerusalem, the navel of the earth, in the middle   as a sort of bull's-eye to a target, all show a \"religious\"   geography. The line of queer figures, on the right side,   figuring the S. coast of Africa, suggests a parallel with the   still more fanciful Mappe-Monde of Hereford. (For copy   see Bevan and Phillott's edition of the Hereford map).     THE S.W., OR AFRICAN SECTION OF THE HEREFORD   MAP _c._ 1275-1300                                 106    (B. Mus., King's Lib., XXIII). The S. coast of Africa,   as in the Psalter map, is fringed with monstrous tribes;   monstrous animals fill up a good deal of the interior; half   of the wheel representing Jerusalem in the middle of the   world appears in the N.E. corner; and the designer's idea   of the Mediterranean and Atlantic islands is specially noteworthy.   The Hereford map is a specimen of the thoroughly   traditional and unpractical school of mediæval geographers   who based their work on books, or fashionable collections   of travellers' tales--such as Pliny, Solinus, or Martianus   Capella--and who are to be distinguished from the scientific   school of the same period, whose best works were the   Portolani, or coast-charts of the early 14th century.     THE WORLD ACCORDING TO MARINO SANUTO. _c._ A.D. 1306   114    (B. Mus., King's Lib., 149 F. 2 p. 282). The shape of   Africa in this map is supposed by some to be valuable in the   history of geographical advance, as suggesting the possibility   of getting round from the Atlantic into the Indian Ocean.     SKETCH MAP OF DULCERT'S PORTOLANO OF 1339               116    (From Nordenskjöld's fac-simile atlas). This illustrates   the accuracy of the 14th century coast-charts, especially in   the Mediterranean.     THE LAURENTIAN PORTOLANO OF 1351                        120    (From the Medicean Lib. at Florence; reproduced in   B. Mus., Map room, shelf 158, 22, 23). This is the most   remarkable of all the Portolani of the 14th century, as   giving a view of the world, and especially Africa, which is   far nearer the actual truth than could be expected. Especially   its outline of S. Africa and of the bend of the Guinea   coast, is surprisingly near the truth, even as a guess, in   a chart made one hundred and thirty-five years before the   Cape of Good Hope was first rounded.     N.W. SECTION OF THE CATALAN MAP OF 1375-6               124    (B. Mus., Map room, 13, 14). This gives the British   Islands, the W. coasts of Europe, N. Africa as far as Cape   Boyador, and the Canaries and other islands in the Atlantic.   The interior of Africa is filled with fantastic pictures of   native tribes; the boat load of men off Cape Boyador in the   extreme S.W. of the map probably represents the Catalan   explorers of the year 1346, whose voyage in search of the   \"River of Gold\" this map commemorates.     CHART OF THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA, BY BARENTSZOON          128    (Engraved in copper 1595. Almost an unaltered copy of   a Portolano from the 14th century. From Nordenskjöld's   fac-simile atlas). This illustrates the remarkable   correctness in the drawing of the Mediterranean basin   and the coasts of W. Europe, reached by the Italian and   Balearic coast-charts, or Portolani, in the 14th century.     THE BORGIAN MAP OF 1450                                 290    (B. Mus., Map room, shelf 2 [6], 13, 14; copy of 1797).   This map was executed just before the fall of Constantinople   (1453), and gives a view of the world as imagined   in the 15th century. It is very fantastic and   unscientific, but remarkable among its kind for its   comparative freedom from ecclesiastical influence.     WESTERN SECTION OF THE MAPPE-MONDE OF FRA   MAURO, 1457-9                                           302    (_Cf._ reproduction in B. Mus., Add. mss., 11267, and   photographic copy in Map room). This map of Fra Mauro   of Murano, (near Venice), is usually understood to be a sort   of picture, not merely of the world as then known, but of   Prince Henry's discoveries in particular on the W. African   coast. From this point of view it is perhaps disappointing;   the inlet of the Rio d'Ouro(?), to the S. of the Sahara,   is exaggerated beyond all recognition; at the S. Cape (of   Good Hope) a great island is depicted, separated from the   mainland by a narrow channel--possibly Madagascar   displaced.     SKETCH-MAP OF FRA MAURO'S MAPPE-MONDE                   304    As reduced and simplified in Lelewel's _Atlas_.   The corners of the table are filled up with four small   circles representing: (1) The Ptolemaic System in the   Spheres. (2) The lunar influences over the tides. (3) The   circles described in the terrestial globe. (4) A picture   of the expulsion from Eden, with the four sacred rivers.     MAP OF 1492                                             322    (B. Mus., Add. mss. 15760). This gives a general view   of the Portuguese discoveries along the whole W. coast of   Africa, and just beyond the Cape of Good Hope, which   was rounded in 1486.  [Footnote 6: **Missing.** Please see the Transcriber's Note at the foot of the text.]     PREFACE   This volume aims at giving an account, based throughout upon original sources, of the progress of geographical knowledge and enterprise in Christendom throughout the Middle Ages, down to the middle or even the end of the fifteenth century, as well as a life of Prince Henry the Navigator, who brought this movement of European Expansion within sight of its greatest successes. That is, as explained in Chapter I., it has been attempted to treat Exploration as one continuous thread in the story of Christian Europe from the time of the conversion of the Empire; and to treat the life of Prince Henry as the turning-point, the central epoch in a development of many centuries: this life, accordingly, has been linked as closely as possible with what went before and prepared for it; one third of the text, at least, has been occupied with the history of the preparation of the earlier time, and the difference between our account of the eleventh-and fifteenth-century Discovery, for instance, will be found to be chiefly one of less and greater detail. This difference depends, of course, on the prominence in the later time of a figure of extraordinary interest and force, who is the true hero in the drama of the Geographical Conquest of the Outer World that starts from Western Christendom. The interest that centres round Henry is somewhat clouded by the dearth of complete knowledge of his life; but enough remains to make something of the picture of a hero, both of science and of action.  Our subject, then, has been strictly historical, but a history in which a certain life, a certain biographical centre, becomes more and more important, till from its completed achievement we get our best outlook upon the past progress of a thousand years, on this side, and upon the future progress of those generations which realised the next great victories of geographical advance.  The series of maps which illustrate this account, give the same continuous view of the geographical development of Europe and Christendom down to the end of Prince Henry's age. These are, it is believed, the first English reproductions in any accessible form of several of the great charts of the Middle Ages, and taken together they will give, it is hoped, the best view of Western or Christian map-making before the time of Columbus that is to be found in any English book, outside the great historical atlases.  In the same way the text of this volume, especially in the earlier chapters, tries to supply a want--which is believed to exist--of a connected account from the originals known to us, of the expansion of Europe through geographical enterprise, from the conversion of the Empire to the period of those discoveries which mark most clearly the transition from the Middle Ages to the Modern World.         *       *       *       *       *  The chief authorities have been:  For the Introductory chapter: (1) Reinaud's account of the Arabic geographers and their theories in connection with the Greek, in his edition of Abulfeda, Paris, 1848; (2) Sprenger's Massoudy, 1841; (3) Edrisi, translated by Amédée Jaubert; (4) Ibn-Batuta (abridgment), translated by S.

The three modern lives of Prince Henry which I have chiefly consulted are:  R.H. Major's _Henry the Navigator_, Wappäus' _Heinrich der Seeffahrer_, and De Weer's _Prinz Heinrich_, with O. Martins' _Lives of the Infants of the House of Aviz_ in his _Sons of Don John I._  The maps and illustrations have been planned in a regular series.  I. As to the former, they are meant to show in an historical succession the course of geographical advance in Christendom down to the death of Prince Henry (1460). Setting aside the Ptolemy, which represents the knowledge of the world at its height in the pre-Christian civilisation, and the Edrisi which represents the Arabic followers of Ptolemy, whose influence upon early Christian geography was very marked, all the maps reproduced belong to the science of the Christian ages and countries. The two Mappe-mondes above referred to are both placed in the introductory chapter, and are treated only as the most important examples of the science which the Græco-Roman Empire bequeathed to Christendom, but which between the seventh and thirteenth centuries was chiefly worked upon by the Arabs. Among early Christian maps, that of St. Sever, possibly of the eighth century, the Anglo-Saxon map of the tenth century, the Turin Map of the eleventh, and the Spanish map of the twelfth (1109), represent very crude and simple types of sketches of the world, in which within a square or oblong surrounded by the ocean a few prominent features only, such as the main divisions of countries, are attempted. The Anglo-Saxon example, though greatly superior to the others given here, essentially belongs to this kind of work, where some little truth is preserved by a happy ignorance of the travellers' tales that came into fashion later, but where there is only the vaguest and most general knowledge of geographical facts.  On the other hand, in the next group, to which the Psalter map is allied, and in which the Hereford map is our best example, mythical learning--drawn from books like Pliny, Solinus, St. Isidore, and Martianus Capella, which collected stories of beasts and monsters, stones and men, divine, human, and natural marvels on the principle _Credo quia impossible_--has overpowered every other consideration, and a map of the world becomes a great picture-book of curious objects, in which the very central and primary interest of geography is lost. But by the side of and almost at the same time as these specimens of geographical mythology, geographical science had taken a new start in the coast charts or portolani of Balearic and Italian seamen, some specimens of which form our next set of maps.  Dulcert's portolano of 1339 and the Laurentian of 1351 are two of the best examples of this kind of work, which gave us our first really accurate map of any part of the globe, but which for some time was entirely confined to coast drawing, and was meant to supply the practical wants of captains, pilots, and seamen. The Catalan atlas of 1375-6 shows the portolano type extended to a real Mappa Mundi; the elaborate carefulness and sumptuousness of this example prepares us for the still higher work of Andrea Bianco and of Benincasa in the fifteenth century. As the Laurentian portolano of 1351 commemorates the voyage of 1341 and marks its discoveries in the Atlantic islands, so the Catalan map of 1375-6 commemorates the Catalan voyage of 1346, and gives the best and most up-to-date picture of the N.W. African coast as it was known before Prince Henry's discoveries.  Last of these groups of maps is that of examples from Henry's own age, such as the Fra Mauro map of 1459 or the maps of Andrea Bianco and Benincasa (_e.g._, 1436, 1448, 1468), among which the first-named is the only one we have been able to give here.  The Borgian map of 1450 is given as an extraordinary specimen of what could be done as late as 1450, not as an example of geographical progress; and the map of 1492, recording Portuguese discoveries down to the rounding of the Cape of Good Hope, is added to illustrate the advance of explorers in the years closely following Henry's death, as it was realised at the time.  The maps have in most cases been set from the modern standpoint, but, as will readily be seen by the position of the names, the normal mediæval setting was quite different, with the S. or E. at the top.  II. The illustrations aim at giving portraits or pictures of the chief persons and places connected with the life of Prince Henry. There are three of the Prince himself; one from the Paris MS. of Azurara, one from the gateway of the great convent church of Belem, one from the recumbent statue over his tomb at Batalha. Two others give: (1) The whole group of the royal tombs of Henry's house,--of his father, mother, and brothers in the aisle at Batalha, and (2) the recumbent statues of his father and mother, John and Philippa, in detail; the exterior and general effect of the same church--Portugal's Westminster, and the mausoleum of the Navigator's own family of Aviz--comes next, in a view of this greatest of Portuguese shrines.  Coimbra University, with which as rector or chancellor or patron Prince Henry was so closely connected, for which he once provided house room, and in which his benefactions earned him the title of \"Protector of the studies of Portugal\" is given to illustrate his life as a student and a man of science; the mother church of the order of Christ at Thomar may remind us of another side of his life--as a military monk, grand master of an order of religious chivalry which at least professed to bind its members to a single life, and which under his lead took an active part in the exploration and settlement of the African coasts and the Atlantic islands.  The portraits of Columbus, Da Gama, and Albuquerque, which conclude this set of illustrations, are given as portraits of three of Prince Henry's more or less conscious disciples and followers, of three men who did most to realise his schemes. The first of these, who owed to Portuguese advance towards the south the suggestion of corresponding success in the west, and who found America by the western route to India,--as Henry had planned nearly a century before to round Africa and reach Malabar by the eastern and southern way,--was the nearest of the Prince's successful imitators in time, the greatest in achievement; he was not a mere follower of the Portuguese initiative, for he struck out a new line or at least a neglected one, made the greatest of all geographical additions to human knowledge, and took the most daring plunge into the unknown that has ever been taken--but Columbus, beside his independent position and interest, was certainly on one side a disciple of Henry the Navigator, and drew much of his inspiration from the impulse that the Prince had started. Da Gama, the first who sailed direct from Lisbon to India round Africa, and Albuquerque, the maker, if not the founder, of"]]]
