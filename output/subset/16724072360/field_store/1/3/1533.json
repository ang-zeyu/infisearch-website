Maybe some girl is wearing your Distinguished Service Cross, for all I know. But we fellows are crazy to have the Eagle award in our troop. I suppose of course you're an Eagle Scout?\"  \"I guess that was about three or four years ago,\" Tom said.  \"Once a scout, always a scout, hey?\"  \"That's it,\" Tom said.  They strolled along in silence for a few minutes, Hervey occasionally stealing a side glimpse at his elder, who ambled on, apparently unconscious of these admiring glances. Now and again Tom paused to examine a patch of moss or some little tell-tale mark upon the ground, as if he had no knowledge of his companion's presence. But Hervey appeared quite satisfied.  \"I'll tell you how it is,\" he finally said, selecting what seemed an appropriate moment to speak; \"I was elected as the one in our troop to go after the Eagle award. We want an Eagle Scout in our troop. We haven't even got one in the city where I live.\"  \"Hear that?\" Tom said. \"That's a thrush.\"  \"A thrush?\"  \"Yop; go on,\" Tom said.  \"So they elected me to win the Eagle award. Some choice, hey? I had seven badges to begin with; maybe that's why they wished it onto me. I had camping, cooking, athletics, pioneering, angling, that's a cinch, that's easy, and, let's see--carpentry and bugling. That's the easiest one of the lot, just blow through the cornet and claim the badge. It's a shame to take it.\"  \"You mean you've won thirteen more since you've been here?\" Tom asked.  \"That's it,\" said Hervey. \"First I got my fists on the eleven that have _got_ to be included in the twenty-one, and then I made up a list of ten others and went to it. I chose easy ones, but some of them didn't turn out to be so easy. Music--oh, boy! And when I started to play the piano, they said I wasn't playing at all, but that I really meant it. Can you beat that?\"  Tom could not help smiling.  \"So you see I've been pretty busy since I've been here, too busy to talk to interviewers, hey? I've piled up thirteen since I've been here; that's a little over six weeks. That isn't so bad, is it?\"  \"It's good,\" Tom said, by no means carried away by enthusiasm.  \"I thought you'd say so. So now I've got twenty and I know them all by heart. Want to hear me stand up in front of the class and say them?\"  \"All right,\" Tom said.  \"No sooner said than stung,\" Hervey flung back at him. \"Well, I've got first aid, physical development, life saving, personal health, public health, cooking, camping, bird study----\"  \"That's a good one,\" Tom said.  \"You said it; and I've got pioneering, pathfinding, athletics, and then come the ten that I selected myself; angling, bugling, carpentry, conservation or whatever you call it, and cycling and firemanship and music hath charms, not, and seamanship and signaling. And two-thirds of the stalking badge. I bet you'll say that's a good one.\"  \"There's one good one that you left out,\" Tom said. \"I thought you'd think of it on account of that last one.\"  \"You mean stalking?\"  \"I mean another that has something to do with that?\"  \"Now you've got me guessing,\" Hervey said.  \"Well, how do you want me to help you?\" Tom asked, thus stifling his companion's inquisitiveness.  \"Well,\" said Hervey, ready, even eager to adapt himself to Tom's mood, \"all I've got to do is to track an animal for a half a mile or so----\"  \"A quarter of a mile,\" Tom said.  \"And then I'm an Eagle Scout,\" Hervey concluded. \"But if I want to be in on the hand-outs Saturday night, I've got to do it between now and Saturday, and that's what has me worried. I want to go home from here an Eagle Scout. Gee, I don't want all my work to go for nothing.\"  \"You want what you want when you want it, don't you?\" Tom said, smiling a little.  \"It's on account of my troop, too,\" Hervey said. \"It isn't just myself that I'm thinking about. Jiminies, maybe I didn't choose the best ones, you know more about the handbook than I do, that's sure, and I suppose that one badge was just as easy as another to _you_. Maybe you think I just chose easy ones, hey?\"  \"Well, what's on your mind?\" Tom said.  \"Do you know where there are any wild animal tracks?\" Hervey blurted out with amusing simplicity. \"I don't mean just exactly where, but do you know a good place to hunt for any? A couple of fellows told me you would know, because you know everything of that sort. So I thought maybe you could give me a tip where to look. I found a horseshoe last night so maybe I'll be lucky. All I want is to get started on a trail.\"  \"Sometimes there are different trails and they take you to the same place,\" Tom said.  No doubt this was one of the sort of remarks that Tom was famous for making which had either no particular meaning or a meaning poorly expressed.  Hervey stared at him for a few seconds, then said, \"I don't care whether it's easy or hard, if that's what you mean. Is it true that there are wild cats up in these mountains?\"  \"Some,\" Tom said.  \"Well, if you were in my place, where would you go to look for a trail? I mean a real trail, not a cow or a horse or Chocolate Drop's kitten. [Chocolate Drop was the negro cook at Temple Camp.] If I can just dig up the trail of a wild animal somewhere, right away quick, the Eagle award is mine--ours. See? Can you give me a tip?\"  Tom's answer was characteristic of him and it was not altogether satisfactory.  \"I'm not so stuck on eagles,\" he said.     CHAPTER V  WHAT'S IN A NAME?   \"_You're not?_\" Hervey asked in puzzled dismay. \"You can bet that every time I look at that little old gold eagle on top of the flag pole I say, 'Me for you, kiddo.'\"  \"I like Star Scout better,\" Tom said, unmoved by his companion's consternation.  \"Why, that means only ten merit badges,\" Hervey said.  \"It's fun studying the stars,\" Tom added.  \"Oh, sure,\" Hervey agreed. \"But star and eagle, they're just names. What's in a name, hey? Is that the badge you meant that I forgot about? The astronomy badge?\"  \"No, it isn't,\" Tom said. \"You're too excitable to study the stars. It's got to be something livelier.\"  \"You've got me down pat, that's sure,\" Hervey laughed.  Tom smiled, too. \"Well, you want the Eagle badge, do you?\" he said.  \"You seem to think it doesn't amount to much,\" Hervey complained.  \"I think it amounts to a whole lot,\" Tom said.  \"When I get my mind on a thing----\" Hervey announced.  \"That's the trouble with you,\" Tom said.  \"There you go,\" Hervey shot back at him; \"you've been through the game and walked away with every honor in the book, and you know the book by heart and you can track with your eyes shut and you've been to France and all that and you think I'm just a kid, but it means something to be an Eagle Scout, I can tell you.\"  Doubtless Tom Slade, scout, was gratified to receive this valuable information. \"And there's just the one way to get there, is that it?\" he answered quietly, but smiling a little. \"I always heard that a scout was resourceful and had two strings to his bow.\"  \"You just give me a tip and I'll do the rest,\" said Hervey.  \"It must be about tracking, hey?\"  \"That's it; test three for the stalking badge. _Track an animal a quarter of a mile._\"  \"Well, let me think a minute, then,\" Tom said.  \"Up on that mountain, maybe, hey?\" Hervey urged.  \"Maybe,\" Tom said.  So they ambled along, the elder quite calm and thoroughly master of himself, the younger, all impulse, eagerness and enthusiasm. His generous admiration of Tom, amounting almost to a spirit of worship, was plainly to be seen. It would have been hard to say how Tom felt or what he thought. At all events he had not been jostled out of his stolid calm.  \"Did you ever hear any one say that there is more than one way to kill a cat?\" he finally inquired, pausing to notice some bird or squirrel among the trees.  \"I don't want to kill a cat,\" Hervey said. \"I want to find some tracks, I----\"  \"You want to be an Eagle Scout,\" Tom concluded; \"and you've got your mind set on it. That it?\"  \"That's it; but it's for the sake of my troop, too.\"  Still again, they strolled on in silence. A little twig cracked under Tom's foot, the crackle sounding clear in the solemn stillness. Some feathered creature chirped complainingly at the rude intrusion of its domain by these strangers. And, almost under their very feet, a tiny snake wriggled across the trail and was gone. The shadows were gathering now, and the fragrance of evening was beginning to permeate the dim woods. And all the respectable home-loving birds were seeking their nests.  And so these two strolled on, and for a few minutes neither spoke.  \"Well then, suppose I give you a tip,\" Tom said. \"Will you promise that you'll make good? You claim to be a scout. You say that when you get your mind set on a thing, nothing can stop you. That the idea?\"  \"That's it,\" Hervey answered.  \"You wouldn't drop a trail after you once picked it up, would you? Some animals take you pretty far.\"  \"You bet nothing would stop _me_ if I once got the tracks,\" Hervey said. \"I wouldn't care if they took me across the Desert of Sahara or over the Rocky Mountains.\"  \"Hang on like a bulldog, hey?\" Tom said.  \"That's me,\" said Hervey.  \"All right, it's a go,\" Tom concluded. \"I'll see if I can give you a pointer or two down near camp in the morning. Ever follow a woodchuck--or a coon? Only I don't want any badge-getter falling down on a trail, if I'm mixed up with it. That's one thing I can't stand--a quitter.\"  \"I wouldn't anyway,\" Hervey said with great fervor; \"but as long as I've got you and what you said to think about, you can bet your sweet life that not even a--a--a jungle would stop me--it wouldn't.\"  \"That's the kind of a fellow they want for an Eagle Scout,\" Tom said; \"do or die.\"  \"That's me,\" said Hervey Willetts.

If it should prove that but a small minority of the carvings can be specifically identified, owing to inaccuracies and to their general resemblance, he may indeed go even further and conclude that they form a very unsafe basis for deductions that owe their very existence to assumed accurate imitation.   MANATEE.  In 1848 Squier and Davis published their great work on the Mounds of the Mississippi Valley. The skill and zeal with which these gentlemen prosecuted their researches in the field, and the ability and fidelity which mark the presentation of their results to the public are sufficiently attested by the fact that this volume has proved alike the mine from which subsequent writers have drawn their most important facts, and the chief inspiration for the vast amount of work in the same direction since undertaken.  On pages 251 and 252 of the above-mentioned work appear figures of an animal which is there called \"Lamantin, Manitus, or Sea Cow,\" concerning which animal it is stated that \"seven sculptured representations have been taken from the mounds.\" When first discovered, the authors continue, \"it was supposed they were monstrous creations of fancy; but subsequent investigations and comparison have shown that they are faithful representations of one of the most singular animal productions of the world.\"  These authors appear to have been the first to note the supposed likeness of certain of the sculptured forms found in the mounds to animals living in remote regions. That they were not slow to perceive the ethnological interest and value of the discovery is shown by the fact that it was immediately adduced by them as affording a clew to the possible origin of the Mound-Builders. The importance they attached to the discovery and their interpretation of its significance will be apparent from the following quotation (p. 242):       Some of these sculptures have a value, so far as ethnological      research is concerned, much higher than they can claim as mere      works of art. This value is derived from the fact that they      faithfully represent animals and birds peculiar to other latitudes,      thus establishing a migration, a very extensive intercommunication      or a contemporaneous existence of the same race over a vast extent      of country.  The idea thus suggested fell on fruitful ground, and each succeeding writer who has attempted to show that the Mound-Builders were of a race different from the North American Indian, or had other than an autochthonous origin, has not failed to lay especial stress upon the presence in the mounds of sculptures of the manatee, as well as of other strange beasts and birds, carved evidently by the same hands that portrayed many of our native fauna.  Except that the theories based upon the sculptures have by recent writers been annunciated more positively and given a wider range, they have been left almost precisely as set forth by the authors of the \"Ancient Monuments,\" while absolutely nothing appears to have been brought to light since their time in the way of additional sculptured evidence of the same character. It is indeed a little curious to note the perfect unanimity with which most writers fall back upon the above authors as at once the source of the data they adduce in support of the several theories, and as their final, nay, their only, authority. Now and then one will be found to dissent from some particular bit of evidence as announced by Squier and Davis, or to give a somewhat different turn to the conclusions derivable from the testimony offered by them. But in the main the theories first announced by the authors of \"Ancient Monuments,\" as the result of their study of the mound sculptures, are those that pass current to-day. Particular attention may be called to the deep and lasting impression made by the statements of these authors as to the great beauty and high standard of excellence exhibited by the mound sculptures. Since their time writers appear to be well satisfied to express their own admiration in the terms made use of by Squier and Davis. One might, indeed, almost suppose that recent writers have not dared to trust to the evidence afforded by the original carvings or their fac-similes, but have preferred to take the word of the authors of the \"Ancient Monuments\" for beauties which were perhaps hidden from their own eyes.  Following the lead of the authors of the \"Ancient Monuments,\" also, with respect to theories of origin, these carvings of supposed foreign animals are offered as affording incontestible evidence that the Mound-Builders must have migrated from or have had intercourse, direct or indirect, with the regions known to harbor these animals. Were it not, indeed, for the evident artistic similarity between these carvings of supposed foreign animals and those of common domestic forms--a similarity which, as Squier and Davis remark, render them \"indistinguishable, so far as material and workmanship are concerned, from an entire class of remains found in the mounds\"--the presence of most of them could readily be accounted for through the agency of trade, the far reaching nature of which, even among the wilder tribes, is well understood. Trade, for instance, in the case of an animal like the manatee, found no more than a thousand miles distant from the point where the sculpture was dug up, would offer a possible if not a probable solution of the matter. But independently of the fact that the practically identical character of all the carvings render the theory of trade quite untenable, the very pertinent question arises, why, if these supposed manatee pipes were derived by trade from other regions, have not similar carvings been found in those regions, as, for instance, in Florida and the Gulf States, a region of which the archæology is fairly well known. Primitive man, as is the case with his civilized brother, trades usually out of his abundance; so that not seven, but many times seven, manatee pipes should be found at the center of trade. As it is, the known home of the manatee has furnished no carvings either of the manatee or of anything suggestive of it.  The possibility of the manatee having in past times possessed a wider range than at present seems to have been overlooked. But as a matter of fact the probability that the manatee ever ranged, in comparatively modern times at least, as far north as Ohio without leaving other traces of its presence than a few sculptured representations at the hands of an ancient people is too small to be entertained.  Nor is the supposition that the Mound-Builders held contemporaneous possession of the country embraced in the range of the animals whose effigies are supposed to have been exhumed from their graves worthy of serious discussion. If true, it would involve the contemporaneous occupancy by the Mound-Builders, not only of the Southern United States but of the region stretching into Southern Mexico, and even, according to the ideas of some authors, into Central and South America, an area which, it is needless to say, no known facts will for a moment justify us in supposing a people of one blood to have occupied contemporaneously.  Assuming, therefore, that the sculptures in question are the work of the Mound-Builders and are not derived from distant parts through the agency of trade, of which there would appear to be little doubt, and, assuming that the sculptures represent the animals they have been supposed to represent--of which something remains to be said--the theory that the acquaintance of the Mound-Builders with these animals was made in a region far distant from the one to which they subsequently migrated would seem to be not unworthy of attention. It is necessary, however, before advancing theories to account for facts to first consider the facts themselves, and in this case to seek an answer to the question how far the identification of these carvings of supposed foreign animals is to be trusted. Before noticing in detail the carvings supposed by Squier and Davis to represent the manatee, it will be well to glance at the carvings of another animal figured by the same authors which, it is believed, has a close connection with them.  [Illustration: Fig. 4.--Otter. From Ancient Monuments.]  Figure 4 is identified by the authors of the \"Ancient Monuments\" (Fig. 156) as an otter, and few naturalists will hesitate in pronouncing it to be a very good likeness of that animal; the short broad ears, broad head and expanded snout, with the short, strong legs, would seem to belong unmistakably to the otter. Added to all these is the indication of its fish-catching habits. Having thus correctly identified this animal, and with it before them, it certainly reflects little credit upon the zoological knowledge of the authors and their powers of discrimination to refer the next figure (Ancient Monuments, Fig. 157) to the same animal.  [Illustration: Fig. 5.--Otter of Squier and Davis.]  Of a totally different shape and physiognomy, if intended as an otter it certainly implies an amazing want of skill in its author. However it is assuredly not an otter, but is doubtless an unfinished or rudely executed ground squirrel, of which animal it conveys in a general way a good idea, the characteristic attitude of this little rodent, sitting up with paws extended in front, being well displayed. Carvings of small rodents in similar attitudes are exhibited in Stevens's \"Flint Chips,\" p. 428, Figs. 61 and 62. Stevens's Fig. 61 evidently represents the same animal as Fig. 157 of Squier and Davis, but is a better executed carving.
