It is doubtful, and by no means a matter of importance; at all events, the author was a Greek, and a compatriot of the Cigale, which must have been perfectly familiar to him. There is not a single peasant in my village so blind as to be unaware of the total absence of Cigales in winter; and every tiller of the soil, every gardener, is familiar with the first phase of the insect, the larva, which his spade is perpetually discovering when he banks up the olives at the approach of the cold weather, and he knows, having seen it a thousand times by the edge of the country paths, how in summer this larva issues from the earth from a little round well of its own making; how it climbs a twig or a stem of grass, turns upon its back, climbs out of its skin, drier now than parchment, and becomes the Cigale; a creature of a fresh grass-green colour which is rapidly replaced by brown.  We cannot suppose that the Greek peasant was so much less intelligent than the Provençal that he can have failed to see what the least observant must have noticed. He knew what my rustic neighbours know so well. The scribe, whoever he may have been, who was responsible for the fable was in the best possible circumstances for correct knowledge of the subject. Whence, then, arose the errors of his tale?  Less excusably than La Fontaine, the Greek fabulist wrote of the Cigale of the books, instead of interrogating the living Cigale, whose cymbals were resounding on every side; careless of the real, he followed tradition. He himself echoed a more ancient narrative; he repeated some legend that had reached him from India, the venerable mother of civilisations. We do not know precisely what story the reed-pen of the Hindoo may have confided to writing, in order to show the perils of a life without foresight; but it is probable that the little animal drama was nearer the truth than the conversation between the Cigale and the Ant. India, the friend of animals, was incapable of such a mistake. Everything seems to suggest that the principal personage of the original fable was not the Cigale of the Midi, but some other creature, an insect if you will, whose manners corresponded to the adopted text.  Imported into Greece, after long centuries during which, on the banks of the Indus, it made the wise reflect and the children laugh, the ancient anecdote, perhaps as old as the first piece of advice that a father of a family ever gave in respect of economy, transmitted more or less faithfully from one memory to another, must have suffered alteration in its details, as is the fate of all such legends, which the passage of time adapts to the circumstance of time and place.  The Greek, not finding in his country the insect of which the Hindoo spoke, introduced the Cigale, as in Paris, the modern Athens, the Cigale has been replaced by the Grasshopper. The mistake was made; henceforth indelible. Entrusted as it is to the memory of childhood, error will prevail against the truth that lies before our eyes.  Let us seek to rehabilitate the songstress so calumniated by the fable. She is, I grant you, an importunate neighbour. Every summer she takes up her station in hundreds before my door, attracted thither by the verdure of two great plane-trees; and there, from sunrise to sunset, she hammers on my brain with her strident symphony. With this deafening concert thought is impossible; the mind is in a whirl, is seized with vertigo, unable to concentrate itself. If I have not profited by the early morning hours the day is lost.  Ah! Creature possessed, the plague of my dwelling, which I hoped would be so peaceful!--the Athenians, they say, used to hang you up in a little cage, the better to enjoy your song. One were well enough, during the drowsiness of digestion; but hundreds, roaring all at once, assaulting the hearing until thought recoils--this indeed is torture! You put forward, as excuse, your rights as the first occupant. Before my arrival the two plane-trees were yours without reserve; it is I who have intruded, have thrust myself into their shade. I confess it: yet muffle your cymbals, moderate your arpeggi, for the sake of your historian! The truth rejects what the fabulist tells us as an absurd invention. That there are sometimes dealings between the Cigale and the Ant is perfectly correct; but these dealings are the reverse of those described in the fable. They depend not upon the initiative of the former; for the Cigale never required the help of others in order to make her living: on the contrary, they are due to the Ant, the greedy exploiter of others, who fills her granaries with every edible she can find. At no time does the Cigale plead starvation at the doors of the ant-hills, faithfully promising a return of principal and interest; the Ant on the contrary, harassed by drought, begs of the songstress. Begs, do I say! Borrowing and repayment are no part of the manners of this land-pirate. She exploits the Cigale; she impudently robs her. Let us consider this theft; a curious point of history as yet unknown.  In July, during the stifling hours of the afternoon, when the insect peoples, frantic with drought, wander hither and thither, vainly seeking to quench their thirst at the faded, exhausted flowers, the Cigale makes light of the general aridity. With her rostrum, a delicate augur, she broaches a cask of her inexhaustible store. Crouching, always singing, on the twig of a suitable shrub or bush, she perforates the firm, glossy rind, distended by the sap which the sun has matured. Plunging her proboscis into the bung-hole, she drinks deliciously, motionless, and wrapt in meditation, abandoned to the charms of syrup and of song.  Let us watch her awhile. Perhaps we shall witness unlooked-for wretchedness and want. For there are many thirsty creatures wandering hither and thither; and at last they discover the Cigale's private well, betrayed by the oozing sap upon the brink. They gather round it, at first with a certain amount of constraint, confining themselves to lapping the extravasated liquor. I have seen, crowding around the honeyed perforation, wasps, flies, earwigs, Sphinx-moths, Pompilidæ, rose-chafers, and, above all, ants.  The smallest, in order to reach the well, slip under the belly of the Cigale, who kindly raises herself on her claws, leaving room for the importunate ones to pass. The larger, stamping with impatience, quickly snatch a mouthful, withdraw, take a turn on the neighbouring twigs, and then return, this time more enterprising. Envy grows keener; those who but now were cautious become turbulent and aggressive, and would willingly drive from the spring the well-sinker who has caused it to flow.  In this crowd of brigands the most aggressive are the ants. I have seen them nibbling the ends of the Cigale's claws; I have caught them tugging the ends of her wings, climbing on her back, tickling her antennæ. One audacious individual so far forgot himself under my eyes as to seize her proboscis, endeavouring to extract it from the well!  Thus hustled by these dwarfs, and at the end of her patience, the giantess finally abandons the well. She flies away, throwing a jet of liquid excrement over her tormentors as she goes. But what cares the Ant for this expression of sovereign contempt? She is left in possession of the spring--only too soon exhausted when the pump is removed that made it flow. There is little left, but that little is sweet. So much to the good; she can wait for another drink, attained in the same manner, as soon as the occasion presents itself.  [Illustration: DURING THE DROUGHTS OF SUMMER THIRSTING INSECTS, AND NOTABLY THE ANT, FLOCK TO THE DRINKING-PLACES OF THE CIGALE.]  As we see, reality completely reverses the action described by the fable. The shameless beggar, who does not hesitate at theft, is the Ant; the industrious worker, willingly sharing her goods with the suffering, is the Cigale. Yet another detail, and the reversal of the fable is further emphasised. After five or six weeks of gaiety, the songstress falls from the tree, exhausted by the fever of life. The sun shrivels her body; the feet of the passers-by crush it. A bandit always in search of booty, the Ant discovers the remains. She divides the rich find, dissects it, and cuts it up into tiny fragments, which go to swell her stock of provisions. It is not uncommon to see a dying Cigale, whose wings are still trembling in the dust, drawn and quartered by a gang of knackers. Her body is black with them. After this instance of cannibalism the truth of the relations between the two insects is obvious.  Antiquity held the Cigale in high esteem. The Greek Béranger, Anacreon, devoted an ode to her, in which his praise of her is singularly exaggerated. \"Thou art almost like unto the Gods,\" he says. The reasons which he has given for this apotheosis are none of the best. They consist in these three privileges: [Greek: gêgenês, apathês, hanaimosarke]; born of the earth, insensible to pain, bloodless. We will not reproach the poet for these mistakes; they were then generally believed, and were perpetuated long afterwards, until the exploring eye of scientific observation was directed upon them. And in minor poetry, whose principal merit lies in rhythm and harmony, we must not look at things too closely.  Even in our days, the Provençal poets, who know the Cigale as Anacreon never did, are scarcely more careful of the truth in celebrating the insect which they have taken for their emblem. A friend of mine, an eager observer and a scrupulous realist, does not deserve this reproach. He gives me permission to take from his pigeon-holes the following Provençal poem, in which the relations between the Cigale and the Ant are expounded with all the rigour of science. I leave to him the responsibility for his poetic images and his moral reflections, blossoms unknown to my naturalist's garden; but I can swear to the truth of all he says, for it corresponds"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18350"],["title","Social Life in the Insect World (#2)"],["body","what I see each summer on the lilac-trees of my garden.

Que n'en pensas, canèu de sort!        --O rammaissaire de dardeno        Det croucu, boumbudo bedeno   Que gouvernas lou mounde emé lou coffre-fort,         Fasès courre lou bru, canaio,        Que l'artisto jamai travaio        E dèu pati, lou bedigas.        Teisas-vous dounc: quand di lambrusco        La Cigalo a cava la rusco,   Raubas soun bèure, e pièi, morto, la rousigas.  So speaks my friend in the expressive Provençal idiom, rehabilitating the creature so libelled by the fabulist.  Translated with a little necessary freedom, the English of it is as follows:--                    I.    Fine weather for the Cigale! God, what heat!      Half drunken with her joy, she feasts   In a hail of fire. Pays for the harvest meet;      A golden sea the reaper breasts,   Loins bent, throat bare; silent, he labours long,   For thirst within his throat has stilled the song.    A blessed time for thee, little Cigale.      Thy little cymbals shake and sound,   Shake, shake thy stomach till thy mirrors fall!      Man meanwhile swings his scythe around;   Continually back and forth it veers,   Flashing its steel amidst the ruddy ears.    Grass-plugged, with water for the grinder full,     A flask is hung upon his hip;   The stone within its wooden trough is cool,     Free all the day to sip and sip;   But man is gasping in the fiery sun,   That makes his very marrow melt and run.    Thou, Cigale, hast a cure for thirst: the bark,     Tender and juicy, of the bough.   Thy beak, a very needle, stabs it. Mark     The narrow passage welling now;   The sugared stream is flowing, thee beside,   Who drinkest of the flood, the honeyed tide.    Not in peace always; nay, for thieves arrive,     Neighbours and wives, or wanderers vile;   They saw thee sink the well, and ill they thrive     Thirsting; they seek to drink awhile;   Beauty, beware! the wallet-snatcher's face,   Humble at first, grows insolent apace.    They seek the merest drop; thy leavings take;     Soon discontent, their heads they toss;   They crave for all, and all will have. They rake     Their claws thy folded wings across;   Thy back a mountain, up and down each goes;   They seize thee by the beak, the horns, the toes.    This way and that they pull. Impatient thou:     Pst! Pst! a jet of nauseous taste   O'er the assembly sprinklest. Leave the bough     And fly the rascals thus disgraced,   Who stole thy well, and with malicious pleasure   Now lick their honey'd lips, and feed at leisure.    See these Bohemians without labour fed!     The ant the worst of all the crew--   Fly, drone, wasp, beetle too with horned head,     All of them sharpers thro' and thro',   Idlers the sun drew to thy well apace--   None more than she was eager for thy place,    More apt thy face to tickle, toe to tread,     Or nose to pinch, and then to run   Under the shade thine ample belly spread;     Or climb thy leg for ladder; sun   Herself audacious on thy wings, and go   Most insolently o'er thee to and fro.                     II.    Now comes a tale that no one should believe.     In other times, the ancients say,   The winter came, and hunger made thee grieve.     Thou didst in secret see one day   The ant below the ground her treasure store away.    The wealthy ant was drying in the sun     Her corn the dew had wet by night,   Ere storing it again; and one by one     She filled her sacks as it dried aright.   Thou camest then, and tears bedimmed thy sight,    Saying: \"'Tis very cold; the bitter bise     Blows me this way and that to-day.   I die of hunger. Of your riches please     Fill me my bag, and I'll repay,   When summer and its melons come this way.    \"Lend me a little corn.\" Go to, go to!     Think you the ant will lend an ear?   You are deceived. Great sacks, but nought for you!     \"Be off, and scrape some barrel clear!   You sing of summer: starve, for winter's here!\"    'Tis thus the ancient fable sings     To teach us all the prudence ripe   Of farthing-snatchers, glad to knot the string     That tie their purses. May the gripe   Of colic twist the guts of all such tripe!    He angers me, this fable-teller does,     Saying in winter thou dost seek   Flies, grubs, corn--thou dost never eat like us!     --Corn! Couldst thou eat it, with thy beak?   Thou hast thy fountain with its honey'd reek.    To thee what matters winter? Underground     Slumber thy children, sheltered; thou   The sleep that knows no waking sleepest sound.     Thy body, fallen from the bough,   Crumbles; the questing ant has found thee now.    The wicked ant of thy poor withered hide     A banquet makes; in little bits   She cuts thee up, and empties thine inside,     And stores thee where in wealth she sits:   Choice diet when the winter numbs the wits.                    III.    Here is the tale related duly,   And little resembling the fable, truly!   Hoarders of farthings, I know, deuce take it.   It isn't the story as you would make it!   Crook-fingers, big-bellies, what do you say,   Who govern the world with the cash-box--hey?    You have spread the story, with shrug and smirk,   That the artist ne'er does a stroke of work;   And so let him suffer, the imbecile!   Be you silent! 'Tis you, I think,   When the Cigale pierces the vine to drink,   Drive her away, her drink to steal;   And when she is dead--you make your meal!     CHAPTER II  THE CIGALE LEAVES ITS BURROW   The first Cigales appear about the summer solstice. Along the beaten paths, calcined by the sun, hardened by the passage of frequent feet, we see little circular orifices almost large enough to admit the thumb. These are the holes by which the larvæ of the Cigale have come up from the depths to undergo metamorphosis. We see them more or less everywhere, except in fields where the soil has been disturbed by ploughing. Their usual position is in the driest and hottest situations,"]]]
