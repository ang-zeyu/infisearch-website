Grey Molly was educated, and Mrs. Pym stood in the doorway with a broad grin of appreciation on her red face, she knew riding when she saw it. Then, out of the full frenzy, the mare lapsed into high-headed, quivering attention, and Gregg cursed her softly, with deep affection. He understood her from her fetlocks to her teeth. She bucked like a fiend of revolt one instant and cantered like an angel of grace the next; in fact she was more or less of an equine counterpart of her rider.  But now he heard shrill voices passing down the street and he knew that school was out and that he must hurry if he wanted to ride home with Betty, so he waved to Mrs. Pym and cantered away. For over two days he had been rushing towards this meeting; all winter he had hungered for it, but now that the moment loomed before him he weakened; he usually did when he came close to the girl. Not that her beauty overwhelmed him, for though she had a portion of energetic good-health and freckled prettiness, he had chosen her as an Indian chooses flint for his steel; one could strike fire from Betty Neal. When he was far away he loved her without doubt or question and his trust ran towards her like a river setting towards the ocean because he knew that her heart was as big and as true as the heart of Grey Molly herself. Only her ways were fickle, and when she came near, she filled him with uneasiness, suspicion.    Chapter III. Battle  On the road he passed Miss Brewster--for the Alder school boasted two teachers!--and under her kindly, rather faded smile he felt a great desire to stop and take her into his confidence; ask her what Betty Neal had been doing all these months. Instead, he touched Grey Molly with the spurs, and she answered like a watch-spring uncurling beneath him. The rush of wind against his face raised his spirits to a singing pitch, and when he flung from the saddle before the school he shouted: “Oh, Betty!”  Up the sharply angling steps in a bound, and at the door: “Oh, Betty!”  His voice filled the room with a thick, dull echo, and there was Betty behind her desk looking up at him agape; and beside her stood Blondy Hansen, big, good looking, and equally startled. Fear made the glance of Vic Gregg swerve--to where little Tommy Aiken scribbled an arithmetic problem on the blackboard--afterschool work for whispering in class, or some equally heinous crime. The tingling voices of the other children on their way home, floated in to Tommy, and the corners of his mouth drooped.  To regain his poise, Vic tugged at his belt and felt the weight of the holster slipping into a more convenient place, then he sauntered up the aisle, sweeping off his sombrero. Every feeling in his body, every nerve, disappeared in a crystalline hardness, for it seemed to him that the air was surcharged by a secret something between Betty and young Hansen. Betty was out from behind her desk and she ran to meet him and took his hand in both of hers. The rush of her coming took his breath, and at her touch something melted in her.  “Oh, Vic, are you all through?”  Gregg stiffened for the benefit of Hansen and Tommy Aiken.  “Pretty near through,” he said carelessly. “Thought I'd drop down to Alder for a day or two and get the kinks out. Hello, Blondy. Hey, Tommy!”  Tommy Aiken flashed a grin at him, but Tommy was not quite sure that the rules permitted speaking, even under such provocation as the return of Vic Gregg, so he maintained a desperate silence. Blondy had picked up his hat as he returned the greeting.  “I guess I'll be going,” he said, and coughed to show that he was perfectly at ease, but it seemed to Vic that it was hard for Blondy to meet his eye when they shook hands. “See you later, Betty.”  “All right.” She smiled at Vic--a flash--and then gathered dignity of both voice and manner. “You may go now, Tommy.”  She lapsed into complete unconsciousness of manner as Tommy swooped on his desk, included hat and book in one grab, and darted towards the door through which Hansen had just disappeared. Here he paused, tilting, and his smile twinkled at them with understanding. “Good-night, Miss Neal. Hope you have a good time, Vic.” His heel clicked twice on the steps outside, and then the patter of his racing feet across the field.  “The little mischief!” said Betty, delightfully flushed. “It beats everything, Vic, how Alder takes things for granted.”  He should have taken her in his arms and kissed her, now that she had cleared the room, he very well knew, but the obvious thing was always last to come in Gregg's repertoire.  “Why not take it for granted? It ain't going to be many days, now.”  He watched her eyes sparkle, but the pleasure of seeing him drowned the gleam almost at once.  “Are you really almost through? Oh, Vic, you've been away so long, and I--” She checked herself. There was no overflow of sentiment in Betty.  “Maybe I was a fool for laying off work this way,” he admitted, “but I sure got terrible lonesome up there.”  Her glance went over him contentedly, from the hard brown hands to the wrinkle which labor had sunk in the exact center of his forehead. He was all man, to Betty.  “Come on along,” he said. He would kiss her by surprise as they reached the door. “Come on along. It's sure enough spring outside. I been eating it up, and--we can do our talking over things at the dance. Let's ride now.”  “Dance?”  “Sure, down to Singer's place.”  “It's going to be kind of hard to get out of going with Blondy. He asked me.”  “And you said you'd go?”  “What are you flarin' up about?”  “Look here, how long have you been traipsin' around with Blondy Hansen?”  She clenched one hand beside her in a way he knew, but it pleased him more than it warned him, just as it pleased him to see the ears of Grey Molly go back.  “What's wrong about Blondy Hansen?”  “What's right about him?” he countered senselessly.  Her voice went a bit shrill. “Blondy is a gentleman, I'll have you know.”  “Is he?”  “Don't you sneer at me, Victor Gregg. I won't have it!”  “You won't, eh?”  He felt that he was pushing her to the danger point, but she was perfectly, satisfyingly beautiful in her anger; he taunted her with the pleasure of an artist painting a picture.  “I won't!” she repeated. Something else came to her lips, but she repressed it, and he could see the pressure from within telling.  “Don't get in a huff over nothing,” he urged, in real alarm. “Only, it made me kind of mad to see Blondy standing there with that calf-look.”  “What calf-look? He's a lot better to look at than you'll ever be.”  A smear of red danced before the vision of Gregg.  “I don't set up for no beauty prize. Tie a pink ribbon in Blondy's hair and take him to a baby show if you want. He's about young enough to enter.”  If she could have found a ready retort her anger might have passed away in words, but no words came, and she turned pale. It was here that Gregg made his crucial mistake, for he thought the pallor came from fear, fear which his sham jealousy had roused in her, perhaps. He should have maintained a discreet silence, but instead, he poured in the gall of complacency upon a raw wound.  “Blondy's all right,” he stated beneficently, “but you just forget about him tonight. You're going to that dance, and you're going with me. If there's any explanations to be made, you leave 'em to me. I'll handle Blondy.”  “You handle Blondy!” she whispered. Her voice came back; it rang: “You couldn't if he had one hand tied behind him.” She measured him for another blow. “I'm going to that dance and I'm going with Mr. Hansen.”  She knew that he would have died for her, and he knew that she would have died for him; accordingly they abandoned themselves to sullen fury.  “You're out of date, Vic,” she ran on. “Men can't drag women around nowadays, and you can't drag me. Not--one--inch.” She put a vicious little interval between each of the last three words.  “I'll be calling for you at seven o'clock.”  “I won't be there.”  “Then I'll call on Blondy.”  “You don't dare to. Don't you try to bluff me. I'm not that kind.”  “Betty, d'you mean that? D'you think that I'm yaller?”  “I don't care what you are.”  “I ask you calm and impersonal, just think that over before you say it.”  “I've already thought it over.”  “Then, by God,” said Gregg, trembling, “I'll never take one step out of my way to see you again.”  He turned, so blind with fury that he shouldered the door on his way out and so, into the saddle, with Grey Molly standing like a figure of rock, as if she sensed his mood. He swung her about on her hind legs with a wrench on the curb and a lift of his spurs, but when she leaped into a gallop he brought her back to the walk with a cruel jerk; she began to sidle across the field with her chin drawn almost back to her breast, prancing. That movement of the horse brought him half way around towards the door and he was tempted mightily to look, for he knew that Betty Neal was standing there, begging him with her eyes. But the great, sullen pain conquered; he straightened out the mare for the gate.  Betty was indeed at the door, leaning against it in a sudden weakness, and even in her pain she felt pride in the grace and skill of Vic's horsemanship. The hearts of both of them were breaking, with this rather typical difference: that Gregg felt her to be entirely at fault, and that she as fully accepted every scruple of the blame. He had come down tired out and nervous from work he had done for her sake, she remembered, and if he would only glance back once--he must know that she was praying for it--she would cry out and run down to him; but he went on, on, through the gate.  A flash of her passion returned to her. “I shall go with Blondy--if it kills me.” And she flung herself into the nearest seat and wept.  So when he reached the road and looked back at last, the doorway yawned black, empty, and he set his teeth with a groan and spurred down the road for Alder. He drew rein at Captain Lorrimer'"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18970"],["title","Caves of Terror (#1)"],["body","ing's specialty is making use of unconsidered trifles and misunderstood babus.         *       *       *       *       *  King was attired as a native, when we sought out Mulji Singh together and found him in a back street with a hundred-yard-long waiting list of low-caste and altogether casteless cripples.  And of course Mulji Singh had all the gossip of the city at his fingers' ends. When he closed his office at last, and we came inside to sit with him, he loosed his tongue and would have told us everything he knew if King had not steered the flow of information between channels.  \"Aye, _sahib_, and this Mahatma, they say, is a very holy fellow, who works miracles. Sometimes he sits under a tree by the burning ghat, but at night he goes to the temple of the Tirthankers, where none dare follow him, although they sit in crowds outside to watch him enter and leave. The common rumor is that at night he leaves his body lifeless in a crypt in that Tirthanker temple and flies to heaven, where he fortifies himself with fresh magic. But I know where he goes by night. There comes to me with boils a one-legged sweeper who cleans a black panther's cage. The panther took his other leg. He sleeps in a cage beside the panther's, and it is a part of his duty to turn the panther loose on intruders. It is necessary that they warn this one-legged fellow whenever a stranger is expected by night, who should not be torn to pieces. Night after night he is warned. Night after night there comes this Mahatma to spend the hours in heaven! There are places less like heaven than _her_ palace.\"  \"Is he your only informant?\" King demanded.  \"Aye, _sahib_, the only one on that count. But there is another, whose foot was caught between stone and stone when they lowered a trap-door once in that Tirthanker temple. He bade the Tirthankers heal his foot, but instead they threw him out for having too much knowledge of matters that they said do not concern him. And he says that the trap-door opens into a passage that leads under the wall into a chamber from which access is obtained by another trap-door to a building inside _her_ palace grounds within a stone-throw of that panther's cage. And he, too, says that the Mahatma goes nightly to _her_ palace.\"  \"Are there any stories of _her_?\" King inquired.  \"Thousands, _sahib_! But no two agree. It is known that she fell foul of the _raj_ in some way, and they made her come to this place. I was here when she came. She has a household of a hundred women--_maunds_ of furniture--_maunds_ of it, _sahib_! She gave orders to her men-servants to be meek and inoffensive, so when they moved in there were not more than ten fights between them and the city-folk who thought they had as much right to the streets. There was a yellow-fanged northern devil who marshaled the serving-men, and it is he who keeps her palace gate. He keeps it well. None trespass.\"  \"What other visitors does she entertain besides the Mahatma?\"  \"Many, _sahib_, though few enter by the front gate. There are tales of men being drawn up by ropes from boats in the river.\"  \"Is there word of why they come?\"  \"_Sahib_, the little naked children weave stories of her doings. Each has a different tale. They call her empress of the hidden arts. They say that she knows all the secrets of the priests, and that there is nothing that she cannot do, because the gods love her and the _Rakshasas_ (male evil spirits) and _Apsaras_ (female evil spirits) do her bidding.\"  \"What about this Tirthanker temple? Who controls it?\"  \"None knows that, _sahib_. It is so richly endowed that its priests despise men's gifts. None is encouraged to worship in that place. When those old Tirthankers stir abroad they have no dealings with folk in this city that any man knows of.\"  \"Are you sure they are Tirthankers?\" asked King.  \"I am sure of nothing, _sahib_. For aught I know they are _devils_!\"  King gave him a small sum of money, and we walked away toward the burning ghat, where there was nothing but a mean smell and a few old men with rakes gathering up ashes. But outside the ghat, where a golden mohur tree cast a wide shadow across the road there was a large crowd sitting and standing in rings around an absolutely naked, ash-smeared religious fanatic.  The fanatic appeared to have the crowd bewildered, for he cursed and blessed on no comprehensible schedule, and gave extraordinary answers to the simplest questions, not acknowledging a question at all unless it suited him.  King and I had not been there a minute before some one asked him about the Princess Yasmini.  \"Aha! Who stares at the fire burns his eyes! A burned eye is of less use than a raw one!\"  Some laughed, but not many. Most of them seemed to think there was deep wisdom in his answer to be dug for meditatively, as no doubt there was. Then a man on the edge of the crowd a long way off from me, who wore the air of a humorist, asked him about me.  \"Does the shadow of this foreigner offend your honor's holiness?\"  None glanced in my direction; that might have given the game away. It is considered an exquisite joke to discuss a white man to his face without his knowing it. The Gray Mahatma did not glance in my direction either.  \"As a bird in the river--as a fish in the air--as a man in trouble is the foreigner in Hind!\" he answered.  Then he suddenly began, declaiming, making his voice ring as if his throat were brass, yet without moving his body or shifting his head by a hair's breadth.  \"The universe was chaos. _He_ said, let order prevail, and order came out of the chaos and prevailed. The universe was in darkness. _He_ said, let there be light and let it prevail over darkness; and light came out of the womb of darkness and prevailed. _He_ ordained the _Kali-Yug_--an age of darkness in which all Hind should lie at the feet of foreigners. And thus ye lie in the dust. But there is an end of night, and so there is an end to _Kali-Yug_. Bide ye the time, and watch!\"  King drew me away, and we returned up-street between old temples and new iron-fronted stores toward Mulji Singh's quarters where he had left the traveling bag that we shared between us.  \"Is that Gray Mahatma linked up with propaganda in the U.S.A?\" I asked, wondering.  \"What's more,\" King answered, \"he's dangerous; he's sincere--the most dangerous type of politician in the world--the honest visionary, in love with an abstract theory, capable of offering himself for martyrdom. Watch him now!\"  The crowd was beginning to close in on the Mahatma, seeking to touch him. Suddenly he flew into a fury, seized a long stick from some one near him and began beating them over the head, using both hands and laying on so savagely that ashes fell from him like pipe-clay from a shaken bag, and several men ran away with the blood pouring down their faces. However, they were reckoned fortunate.  \"Some of those will charge money to let other fools touch them,\" said King. \"Come on. Let's call on _her_ now.\"  So we returned to Mulji Singh's stuffy little office, and King changed into a Major's uniform.  \"It isn't exactly according to Hoyle to wear this,\" he explained. \"However, she doesn't know I've resigned from the army.\"     CHAPTER II  THE PALACE OF YASMINI   Nobody saw us walk up to Yasmini's palace gate and knock; for whoever was abroad in the heat was down by the ghat admiring the Mahatma.  The bearded giant who had admitted us stood staring at King, his long, strong fingers twitching. In his own good time King turned and saw fit to recognize him.  \"Oh, hullo Ismail!\"  He held a hand out, but the savage flung arms about him that were as strong as the iron gate-clamps, and King had to fight to break free from the embrace.  \"Now Allah be praised, he is father of mercies! _She_ warned me!\" he croaked. \"She knows the smell of dawn at midnight! She said, 'He cometh soon!' and none believed her, save only I. This very dawn said she, 'Thou, Ismail,' she said, 'be asleep at the gate when he cometh and thine eyes shall be thrown to the city dogs!' Aye! Oho!\"  King nodded to lead on, and Ismail obeyed with a deal of pantomime intended to convey a sense of partnership with roots in the past and its fruition now.  The way was down a passage between high, carved walls so old that antiquarians burn friendship in disputes not so much about the century as the very era of that quiet art--under dark arches with latticed windows into unexpected gardens fresh with the smell of sprinkled water--by ancient bronze gateways into other passages that opened into stone-paved courts with fountains in the midst--building joining on to building and court meeting court until, where an old black panther snarled at us between iron bars, an arch and a solid bronze door admitted us at last into the woman's pleasance--a wonderland of jasmine, magnolia and pomegranates set about a marble pool and therein mirrored among rainbow-colored fishes.  Beyond the pool a flight of marble steps rose fifty feet until it passed through a many-windowed wall into the _panch mahal_--the quarters of the women. At their foot Ismail halted.  \"Go thou up alone! Leave this elephant with me!\" he said, nudging me and pointing with his thumb toward a shady bower against the garden wall.  Without acknowledging that pleasantry King took my arm and we went straight forward together, our tread resounding strangely on steps that for centuries had felt no sterner shock than that of soft slippers and naked, jeweled feet.  We were taking nobody entirely by surprise; that much was obvious. Before we reached the top step two women opened a door and ran to meet us. One woman threw over King's head such a prodigious garland of jasmine buds that he had to loop it thrice about his shoulders. Then each took a hand of one of us and we entered between doors of many-colored wood, treading on mat-strewn marble, their bare feet pattering beside ours. There were rustlings to right and left, and once I heard laughter, smothered instantly.  At"]]]
