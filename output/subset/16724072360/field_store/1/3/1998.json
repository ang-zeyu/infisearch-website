My companion was livid.  His teeth chattered audibly.  He tried to pull himself together and murmured incoherent syllables.  Personally, I was a bit unnerved, yet somewhat reassured.  If my eyes had not deceived me, the mystery of the _Loup-garou_ was now solved.  And yet I felt quite sure that wild boar were unknown in our region.  At Château-Thierry I made enquiries and from soldiers and foresters learned that heretofore inhabitants of the Ardennes forest, these animals had been driven South when man had chosen to make the firing line of their haunts; and that, prolific breeders, they were now practically a menace to the unarmed civilian.  From these same lovers of nature I gathered that for the first time in their recollection sea-gulls and curlews had likewise been seen on the banks of the Marne.  While the country now abounds in newcomers, many of the old familiar birds and animals are rapidly disappearing.  Larks are rare visitors these days, and the thrush which used to hover over our vineyards in real flocks, have almost entirely vanished.  The swallows, however, are our faithful friends and have never failed to return to us.  Each succeeding Spring their old haunts are in a more or less dilapidated condition according to the number of successful visits the German aviators have chosen to pay us during the Winter, and I fancy that this upsets them a trifle.  For hundreds of generations they have been accustomed to nest in the pinions of certain roofs, to locate in a determined chimney, and it is a most amusing sight to see them cluster about a ruined spot and discuss the matter in strident chirpings.  Last season, after a family consultation, which lasted well nigh all the morning, and during which they made repeated visits of inspection to a certain favourite drain pipe, I suddenly saw them all lift wing and sail away towards the North.  My heart sank.  Something near and dear seemed to be slipping from me, and one has said _au revoir_ so oft in vain.  So they too were going to abandon me!  In one accustomed to daily coping with big human problems, such emotion may seem trivial, but it was perhaps this constant forced endurance that kept one up, made one almost supersensitively sentimental.  Little things grew to count tremendously.  At lunch time I sauntered forth quite sad at heart, when an unexpected familiar twittering greeted my ear, and I turned northward to see my little friends circling about the stables.  Life closer to the front had evidently not offered any particular advantages, and in a few days' time their constant comings and goings from certain specific points told me that they had come back to stay.  But if friend swallow may be praised for his fidelity, unfortunately not so much can be said for another familiar passerby--the wild duck. October had always seen them flocking southward, and some one of our household had invariably heard their familiar call, as at daybreak they would pass over the château on their way from the swamps of the Somme to the Marais de St. Gond.  The moment was almost a solemn one.  It seemed to mark an epoch in the tide of our year.  Claude, Benôit, George and a decrepit gardener would abandon all work and prepare boats, guns and covers on the Marne.  Oh, the wonderful still hours just before dawn!  Ah, that indescribable, intense, yet harmonious silence that preceded the arrival of our prey!  Alas, all is but memory now.  Claude has fallen before Verdun, Benôit was killed on the Oise, and George has long since been reported missing.  Alone, unarmed, the old gardener and I again awaited the cry of our feathered friends, but our waiting, like that of so many others, was in vain.  The wild ducks are a thing of the past.  Where have they gone? No one knows, no one has ever seen them.  And in the tense hush of the Autumn nights, above the distant rumble of the cannon rose only the plaintive cry of stray dogs baying at the moon.  Dogs, _mon Dieu_, I wonder how many of those poor, forgotten, abandoned creatures having strayed into our barnyard were successively washed, combed, fed, cared for and adopted.  Some of them, haunted by the spirit of unrest, remained with us but a moment; others tried us for a day, a week, and still others, appreciative of our pains, refused to leave at all.  Oh, the heart rending, lonesome, appealing look in the eyes of a poor brute that has lost home and master!  It is thus that I came into possession of an ill tempered French poodle called _Crapouillot_, which the patients in our hospital insisted on clipping like a lion with an anklet, a curl over his nose and a puff at the end of his tail.  A most detestable, unfortunate beast, always to be found where not needed, a ribbon in his hair, and despicably bad humoured.  He was succeeded by a Belgian sheep dog, baptised _Namur_, who in time gave place to one of the most hopelessly ugly mongrels I have ever seen.  But the new comer was so full of life and good will, had such a comical way of smiling and showing his gleaming white teeth, that in memory of the joy caused by the Charlie Chaplin films, he was unanimously dubbed _Charlot_.  The mere sound of his name would plunge him into ecstasies of joy, accompanied by the wildest yapping and strange capers, which invariably terminated by a double somersault in the mud so anxious was he to convince us of his gratitude.  Imagine then what might be obtained by a caress, or a bowl of hot soup.  Last in line, but by no means least, was a splendid English pointer, a superb, finely bred animal, who day in, day out would lie by the open fire, lost in a profound revery that terminated in a kind of sob. Poor, melancholy _Mireille_, what master was she mourning?  For what home did she thus pine?  How I respected and appreciated her sadness. How intensely human she became.  Finally when I could resist no longer I would take her long delicate head into my hands and gently stroke it, seeking to impart my sympathy. \"I know that you never can be mine,\" I would murmur, \"that you will ever and eternally belong to him to whom you gave yourself once and entirely.  But these are sad anxious days for us all; we must bear together.  And so as my own dogs have often been my only consolation in like times of misery and despair, oh, how I would love to comfort you--beautiful, faithful, disconsolate Mireille!\"     II  Cities, like people, seem to have souls, deep hidden and rarely ever entirely revealed.  How well must one come to know them, stone by stone, highways, homes and habitants, ere they will disclose their secret.  I have rejoiced too often in the splendid serenity of St. Jean des Vignes, felt too deeply the charm of those ancient streets, hoped and suffered too intensely within its confines that Soissons should not mean more to me than to the average zealous newspaper correspondent, come there but to make note of its wounds, to describe its ruins.  Fair Soissons, what is now your fate?  In what state shall we find you? What ultimate destiny is reserved for your cathedral, your stately mansions, your magnificent gardens?  What has become of those fifteen or sixteen hundred brave souls who loved you so well that they refused to leave you?  _Qui sait_?  One arrived at Soissons in war time by long avenues, shaded on either side by a double row of stately elms, whose centenary branches stretching upward formed an archway overhead.  Then came the last outpost of Army Police, a sentinel stopped you, minutely examined your passports, verified their visés, and finally, all formalities terminated, one entered what might have been the City of Death.  Moss and weeds had sprung up between the cobble stone pavings; as far as eye could see not a human soul was astir, not a familiar noise was to be heard, not a breath of smoke stole heavenwards from those hundreds of idle chimneys: and yet life, tenacious ardent life was wonderfully evident here and there.  A curtain lifted as one passed, a cat on the wall, a low distant whistle, clothes drying at a window, a flowering plant on a balcony, sometimes a door ajar, through which one guessed a store in whose dimly lighted depths shadows seemed to be moving about; all these bore witness to an eager, undaunted existence, hidden for the time being perhaps, but intense and victorious, ready to spring forward and struggle anew in admirable battles of energy and conscience.  The Hotel du Soleil d'Or offered a most hospitable welcome.  It was the only one open or rather, if one would be exact, the only one still extant.  To be sure there were no panes in the windows, and ungainly holes were visible in almost all the ceilings, but the curtains were spotlessly white and the bed linen smelled sweet from having been dried in the open air.  A most appreciable surprise was the excellent _cuisine_, and as ornament to the dining-room table, between a pair of tall preserve dishes, and on either side of the central bouquet, stood an unexploded German shell.  One of them had fallen on to the proprietor's bed, the second landing in the pantry, while twenty or thirty others had worked more efficiently, as could be attested by the ruins of the carriage house, stables, and what had once been a glass covered Winter garden.  On a door leading out of the office, and curiously enough left intact, one might read, _Salon de conversation_.  If you were to attempt to cross the threshold, however, your eye would be instantly greeted by a most abominable heap of plaster and wreckage, and the jovial proprietor seeing your embarrassment, would explain:  \"My wife and the servants are all for cleaning up, but to my mind it's better to leave things just as they are.  Besides if we put all to rights now, when our patrons return they will never credit half we tell them.  Seeing is believing!  At any rate, it's an out of the way place, and isn't bothering people for"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20112"],["title","Lill's Travels in Santa Claus Land (#1)"],["body","to add a few things from his pocket. Then he went to the kitchen, and brought me a lunch of milk and strawberries and cookies, for he said I must be tired after my long walk.  \"After I had rested a little while, he said if I liked I might go with him to the observatory. But just as we were starting a funny little fellow stopped at the door with a wheelbarrow full of boxes of dishes. After Santa Claus had taken the boxes out and put them in the pack he said slowly,--  \"'Let me see!'  \"He laid his finger beside his nose as he said it, and looked at me attentively, as if I were a sum in addition, and he was adding me up. I guess I must have come out right, for he looked satisfied, and said I'd better go to the mine first, and then join him in the observatory. Now I am afraid he was not exactly polite not to go with me himself,\" added Lill, gravely, \"but then he apologized by saying he had some work to do. So I followed the little fellow with the wheelbarrow, and we soon came to what looked like the entrance of a cave, but I suppose it was the mine. I followed my guide to the interior without stopping to look at the boxes and piles of dishes outside. Here I found other funny little people, busily at work with picks and shovels, taking out wooden dishes from the bottom of the cave, and china and glass from the top and sides, for the dishes hung down just like stalactites in Mammoth Cave.\"  Here Lill opened the book she had been reading, and showed Effie a picture of the stalactites.  \"It was so curious and so pretty that I should have remained longer,\" said Lill, \"only I remembered the observatory and Santa Claus.  \"When I went outside I heard his voice calling out, 'Lilian! Lilian!' It sounded a great way off, and yet somehow it seemed to fill the air just as the wind does. I only had to look for a moment, for very near by was a high tower. I wonder I did not see it before; but in these queer countries you are sure to see something new every time you look about. Santa Claus was standing up at a window near the top, and I ran to the entrance and commenced climbing the stairs. It was a long journey, and I was quite out of breath when I came to the end of it. But here there was such a cozy, luxurious little room, full of stuffed chairs and lounges, bird cages and flowers in the windows, and pictures on the wall, that it was delightful to rest. There was a lady sitting by a golden desk, writing in a large book, and Santa Claus was looking through a great telescope, and every once in a while he stopped and put his ear to a large speaking-tube. While I was resting he went on with his observations.  \"Presently he said to the lady, 'Put down a good mark for Sarah Buttermilk. I see she is trying to conquer her quick temper.'  \"'Two bad ones for Isaac Clappertongue; he'll drive his mother to the insane asylum yet.'  \"'Bad ones all around for the Crossley children,--they quarrel too much.'  \"'A good one for Harry and Alice Pleasure, they are quick to mind.'  \"'And give Ruth Olive ten, for she is a peacemaker.'\"  Just then he happened to look at me and saw I was rested, so he politely asked what I thought of the country. I said it was magnificent. He said he was sorry I didn't stop in the green-house, where he had wax dolls and other delicate things growing. I was very sorry about that, and then I said I thought he must be very happy to own so many delightful things.  \"'Of course I'm happy,' said Santa Claus, and then he sighed. 'But it is an awful responsibility to reward so many children according to their deserts. For I take these observations every day, and I know who is good and who is bad.'  \"I was glad he told me about this, and now, if he would only tell me what time of day he took the observations, I would have obtained really valuable information. So I stood up and made my best courtesy and said,--  \"'Please, sir, would you tell me what time of day you usually look?'  \"'O,' he answered, carelessly, 'any time from seven in the morning till ten at night. I am not a bit particular about time. I often go without my own meals in order to make a record of table manners. For instance: last evening I saw you turn your spoon over in your mouth, and that's very unmannerly for a girl nearly fourteen.'  \"'O, I didn't know _you_ were looking,' said I, very much ashamed; 'and I'll never do it again,' I promised.  \"Then he said I might look through the telescope, and I looked right down into our house. There was mother very busy and very tired, and all of the children teasing. It was queer, for I was there, too, and the _bad-est_ of any. Pretty soon I ran to a quiet corner with a book, and in a few minutes mamma had to leave her work and call, 'Lilian, Lilian, it's time for you to practise.'  \"'Yes, mamma,' I answered, 'I'll come right away.'  \"As soon as I said this Santa Claus whistled for 'Comet' and 'Cupid,' and they came tearing up the tower. He put me in a tiny sleigh, and away we went, over great snow-banks of clouds, and before I had time to think I was landed in the big chair, and mamma was calling 'Lilian, Lilian, it's time for you to practise,' just as she is doing now, and I must go.\"  So Lill answered, \"Yes, mamma,\" and ran to the piano.  Effie sank back in the chair to think. She wished Lill had found out how many black marks she had, and whether that lady was Mrs. Santa Claus--and had, in fact, obtained more accurate information about many things.  But when she asked about some of them afterwards, Lill said she didn't know, for the next time she had traveled in that direction she found Santa Claus Land had moved.     WHAT HAPPENED TO KATHIE AND LU.   It was a very great misfortune, and it must have been a sad affliction to the friends of the two children, for both were once pretty and charming.  It came about in this way.  Little Winnie Tennyson--she wasn't the daughter of Mr. Alfred Tennyson, the poet-laureate of England, but _was_ as sweet as any one of that gentleman's poems--had been to the city; and she had brought home so many wondrous improvements that her two little bosom friends, Lu Medway and Kathie Dysart, were almost struck dumb to behold and to hear what Winnie said and what Winnie had.  For one thing, there were some wooden blocks, all fluted and grooved, and Winnie could heat these blocks in the oven, and wet her hair, and lay it between them, and O! how satin-smooth the waves would be,--hair-pin-crimps and braid-crimps were nothing to this new and scientific way.  Winnie also made it a matter of pride to display her overskirts. These were arranged with ever so many tapes on the inside, and would readily tie up into the most ravishing bunches and puffs--how Lu and Kathie, wee-est mites of women though they were, did envy Winnie her tapes! Their mammas didn't know how to loop a dress--witness their little skirts pinned back into what Kathie called a \"wopse.\"  She also had brought some tiny parlor skates, and, withal, many airs and graces which her two young-lady aunties had taught her, among others a funny little new accent on some of her words,--the word \"pretty\" in particular. And, last of all, she had been taught to dance!  \"And I can show _you_,\" Winnie said, eagerly, \"'cause it goes by 'steps,' and uncle says I take them as pr-i-tty as Cousin Lily.\"  Now, in Connaut, little girls don't dance--not _nice_ little girls, nor nice big girls either, for that matter.  The dimpled mouths opened in astonishment. \"That is wicked, Winnie Ten'son, don't you know?\"  \"O, but 'tisn't,\" said Winnie. \"My aunties dance, and their mamma, my grandmamma, was at the party once.\"  \"We shall tell our mothers,\" said Lu. \"I'll bet you've come home a proud, wicked girl, and you want us to be as bad as you are.\"  [Illustration: \"Winnie already had her class before her.\"]  Now Winnie was only six years old, about the same age as her virtuous friends, and she didn't look very wicked. She had pink cheeks, and blue eyes, and dimples. She stood gazing at her accusers, first at one and then at the other.  \"Luie,\" said Kathie, gravely, \"we mustn't call Winnie wicked till we ask our mothers if she is.\"  \"No, I don't think I would,\" said Mrs. Tennyson, looking up from her sewing, her cheek flushing at the sight of tears in her little Winnie's gentle eyes.  On the way home, they chanced to see their own minister walking along. Lu stopped short. \"Kathie,\" said she, \"I know it's awful wicked now, or else we never should have met the minister right here. I'm just going to tell him about Winnie.\"  She went up to him, Kathie following shyly.  \"Mr. Goodhue, Winnie Ten'son is a nawful wicked girl!\"  \"She _is!_\" said Mr. Goodhue, stopping, and looking down into the little eager face.  \"Yes, sir, she is. She wants us to dance!\"  \"She _does!_\"  \"Yes, sir, she does. She wanted us to learn the steps, right down in her garden this afternoon. Would you dance, Mr. Goodhue?\"  \"Would I? Perhaps I might, were I as little and spry as you, and Winnie would teach me steps, and it was down in the garden.\"  The little girls looked up into his face searchingly. He walked on laughing, and they went on homeward, to ask further advice.  At home, too, everyone seemed to think it a matter for smiles, and laughed at the two tender little consciences.  So they both ran back after dinner to Mrs. Tennyson's. But on the way Kathie said, \"They let us, the minister and ev'ry body, but if it is wicked _ever_, how isn't it wicked _now_?\"  \"I s'pose 'cause we're children,\" Lu said wisely.  The logical trouble thus laid, they tripped on.  They were dressed in sweet pink, and their sun-bonnets were as fresh and crisp as only the sun-bonnets of dear little country school-girls ever can be. It was a most merry summer day; all nature moving gladsomely to the full music of life. The leaves were fluttering to each other, the grasses sweeping up and down, the bobolinks hopping by the meadow path.  Their friend Winnie came out to meet them, looking rather astonished.  \"We're"]]]
