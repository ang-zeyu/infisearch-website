I'll ask my cousin, Jasper Jay; for there isn't much that _he_ doesn't know.\"  [Illustration]     [Illustration]  VII  NOISY VISITORS   Of course Jasper Jay knew where Dickie Deer Mouse lived. And he took great pleasure in pointing out the exact spot to his curious cousin, old Mr. Crow.  It was broad daylight when they visited the tree where Dickie's house hung. The two rogues did not know that he was drowsing inside his snug home, because he had been out late the night before.  No one that knew the two cousins would need to be told that they could never talk together quietly. Perched close to Dickie's house, Mr. Crow croaked in a hoarse voice, while Jasper Jay squalled harshly.  \"This is it!\" Jasper had announced, as soon as they arrived. \"This is his house. And isn't it a sight?\"  \"I should say so!\" old Mr. Crow agreed. \"It's got a roof on it--ha! ha!\"  And the two visitors laughed loudly, as if they thought there was a huge joke somewhere.  They made such a noise, from the very first, that Dickie Deer Mouse awoke and heard almost everything they said. But he didn't mind their remarks in the least--until he caught Fatty Coon's name.  It was old Mr. Crow who mentioned it first.  \"I'll have to tell Fatty Coon about this queer house,\" he chuckled. \"It's too good a joke to keep. He'll be over here as soon as he knows where to come, for he'll be glad to see it; and he wants to talk to Dickie Deer Mouse about taking our corn.\"  Dickie had still felt somewhat sleepy during the first part of this talk outside his house. But when Mr. Crow began to speak about Fatty Coon, Dickie became instantly wide awake. He sprang quickly to his feet; and thrusting his head through his doorway, he called in his loudest tone:  \"When do you think Fatty Coon will call on me?\"  The two cousins looked at each other. And then they looked all around.  \"What was that strange squeaking?\" Mr. Crow asked Jasper Jay.  \"To me it sounded a good deal like a rusty hinge on Farmer Green's barn door,\" Jasper Jay answered.  But Mr. Crow shook his head. \"It couldn't have been that,\" he said.  \"Maybe Mrs. Green is rocking on a loose board on the porch,\" Jasper suggested.  Still Mr. Crow couldn't agree with him.  \"Don't be silly!\" he snapped. \"We're half a mile from the farmhouse.\"  \"Well, what do _you_ think the noise was?\" Jasper Jay inquired.  Old Mr. Crow cocked an eye upward into the tree-top above him. \"I'd think it was a Squirrel if it was louder,\" he replied. Jasper Jay laughed in a most disagreeable fashion.  \"I'd think it was thunder if it was loud enough,\" he sneered.  And at that the two cousins began to quarrel violently. To tell the truth, they never could be together long without having a dispute.  For a short time Dickie Deer Mouse listened to their rude remarks, hoping that they would stop wrangling long enough to hear his question about Fatty Coon.  But they talked louder and louder. And since Dickie Deer Mouse never quarreled with anybody, and hated to hear such language as the two cousins used, he slipped out of his house without their seeing him and went over to the cornfield.  For he was hungry.  [Illustration]     [Illustration]  VIII  IN THE CORNFIELD   In one way, especially, Fatty Coon and Dickie Deer Mouse were alike: They were night-prowlers. When they slept it was usually broad daylight outside, and the birds--except for a few odd fellows like Willie Whip-poor-will and Mr. Night Hawk--were abroad, and singing, and twittering. And when most of the birds went to sleep Dickie and Fatty Coon began to feel quite wide awake.  It was not strange, therefore, that Dickie Deer Mouse was surprised when he found himself face to face with Fatty Coon in the cornfield at midday.  Dickie tried to slip out of sight under a pumpkin vine that grew between the rows; but Fatty Coon saw him before he could hide. And Fatty began to make the queerest noise, as if he were almost choking.  Dickie Deer Mouse stopped. And he trembled the least bit; for Fatty looked terribly fierce. Perhaps (Dickie thought) he was choking with rage.  \"Can I help you?\" Dickie asked him. \"Would you like me to thump you on the back?\"  Fatty Coon shook his head. There was nothing the matter with him, except that he had stuffed his mouth so full that he couldn't speak. After swallowing several times he wiped his mouth on the back of his paw--a habit of which his mother had never been able to break him. It was no wonder that dainty Dickie Deer Mouse shuddered again, when Fatty did that.  \"May I go and get you a napkin?\" Dickie asked, as he edged away.  \"No!\" Fatty Coon growled. \"I've been wanting to have a talk with you. And now that I've found you, you needn't run off.\"  Then, to Dickie's horror, Fatty stopped talking and licked both his paws.  \"May I get you a finger bowl?\" Dickie inquired.  Fatty Coon actually didn't know what he meant.  \"Is that something to eat?\" he asked. And he looked much interested, and seemed quite downcast when Dickie said \"No!\"  \"Then you needn't trouble yourself,\" Fatty Coon told him with a sigh.  \"Can't you find corn enough for a good meal?\" Dickie asked him wonderingly.  \"I could,\" said Fatty Coon, \"if other people didn't take so much of it.... Now, there's Mr. Crow,\" he complained. \"I had to get out of bed and come over here to-day, in the sunlight, because I was afraid he wouldn't leave any corn for me.  \"There's no use saying anything to him,\" Fatty continued, \"because he thinks this is _his_ cornfield.... But little chaps like you will have to keep away from this place.... Now I've warned you,\" he added. \"And if I hear of your eating any more corn I'll come straight to your house--when I find out where it is--and I'll----\"  He did not finish his threat. But he looked so darkly at Dickie that what he _didn't_ say made Dickie Deer Mouse shiver all over, though the warm midday sun fell upon the cornfield.  Now, Dickie Deer Mouse hadn't eaten a single kernel of corn all that day. But he suddenly lost his appetite for it; and murmuring a faint good-bye he turned and ran for the woods as fast as he could go.  \"Stop! Stop!\" Fatty Coon called after him. \"There's something more I want to say to you.\"  But whatever it may have been, Dickie Deer Mouse did not wait to hear it.  [Illustration]     [Illustration]  IX  FATTY COON NEEDS HELP   The moment he plunged into the woods beyond the cornfield Dickie Deer Mouse began to feel better. He knew that Fatty Coon would not leave that place of plenty until he had filled himself almost to bursting with tender young corn.  After Dickie had eaten a few seeds that he found under the trees, as well as a plump bug that was hiding beneath a log, he actually told himself that he was glad he had met Fatty Coon in the cornfield.  \"Now that he has talked with me,\" Dickie reasoned, \"he won't trouble himself to come to my house when old Mr. Crow tells him where I live.\"  That thought was a great comfort to him. Ever since he had waked up and heard Mr. Crow and Jasper Jay talking outside his house he had felt most uneasy. If Mr. Crow was going to guide Fatty Coon to his new home, Dickie hardly thought it safe to stay there any longer.  But now he was sure that that danger was past. Fatty had given him his warning. And Dickie had no doubt that so long as he kept away from the corn his greedy neighbor would never bother to disturb him.  So instead of quitting his snug home--as he had feared he must--he went back to it to finish his nap.  Now, Dickie Deer Mouse had lost so much sleep--through being disturbed by Mr. Crow and Jasper Jay--that when night came he kept right on sleeping. Yes! Instead of joining his friends in a mad scamper through the woods in the moonlight, Dickie Deer Mouse slept on and on and on, until--something shook the small tree where he lived and made it sway as if an earthquake had come.  Dickie Deer Mouse roused himself with a start. His sharp ears caught a scratching sound. And sticking his head through his doorway, he looked out.  One quick glance told him what was happening. That pudgy rascal, Fatty Coon, was climbing the tree! And every moment brought him nearer and nearer to Dickie's house.  Dickie's big, black eyes bulged more than ever as he whisked out of his house and scampered to the top of the tree, where the branches were so small that Fatty Coon could never follow him.  \"Stop!\" Fatty Coon cried. \"Mr. Crow told me where I could find you. And I want to have a word with you.\"  \"What sort of word?\" Dickie Deer Mouse inquired.  \"It's about the cornfield,\" Fatty Coon explained.  \"I haven't been near that place since you last saw me there,\" Dickie declared.  \"I know you haven't,\" Fatty told him. \"That's just why I want to have a word with you. I'm in a peck of trouble. And I want you to help me.\"  Dickie Deer Mouse could scarcely believe it. But being a very polite young gentleman, he told Fatty that he would be glad to do anything in his power to assist him--or at least, anything except to come down out of the top of the tree.  [Illustration]     [Illustration]  X  A BIT OF ADVICE   \"It's like this,\" Fatty Coon said, puffing a bit--on account of his climb--as he looked up at Dickie Deer Mouse. \"Old Mr. Crow says that Farmer Green is going to sick old dog Spot on me if I don't keep out of the cornfield.\"  \"Well, I should say it was very kind of Mr. Crow to tell you,\" Dickie remarked.  Fatty Coon was not so sure of that.  \"He'd like to have the cornfield to himself,\" he told Dickie. \"He'd like nothing better than to keep me out of it. And if old dog Spot is coming there after me, I certainly don't want to go near the place again.\"  \"Then I'd stay away, if I were you,\" Dickie Deer Mouse told him.  \"Ah! That's just the trouble!\" Fatty Coon cried. \"I can't! I'm too fond of corn. And that's why I've come here to have a word with you,\" he went on. \"I've noticed that you haven't set foot in the cornfield since I spoke to you over there "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18954"],["title","Tom Slade with the Boys Over There (#1)"],["body","!\"  \"Sh-h-h,\" warned her mother again.  \"Yes, they are murderers,\" said old Pierre, \"but this is a silly child to talk so. We have borne much silently. Can we not be a little patient now?\"  \"I _hate_ them!\" sobbed the girl, abandoning all caution. \"They drove him away and we will see him no more,--my brother--Armand!\"  \"Hush, my daughter,\" her mother pleaded. \"Listen! I heard a footstep. They are spying and have heard.\"  For a moment neither spoke and there was no sound but the girl's quick breaths as she tried to control herself. Then there was a slight rustling in the shrubbery and they waited in breathless suspense.  \"I knew it,\" whispered Madame; \"we are always watched. Now it has come.\"  Still they waited, fearfully. Another sound, and old Pierre rose, pushed his rustic chair from him and stood with a fine, soldierly air, waiting. His wife was trembling pitiably and Florette, her eyes wide with grief and terror, watched the dark bushes like a frightened animal.  Suddenly the leaves parted and they saw a strange disheveled figure. For a moment it paused, uncertain, then looked stealthily about and emerged into the open. The stranger was hatless and barefoot and his whole appearance was that of exhaustion and fright. When he spoke it was in a strange language and spasmodically as if he had been running hard.  \"Leteur?\" he asked, looking from one to the other; \"the name--Leteur? I can't speak French,\" he added, somewhat bewildered and clutching an upright of the arbor.  \"What do you wish here?\" old Pierre demanded in French, never relaxing his military air.  The stranger leaned wearily against the arbor, panting, and even in the dusk they could see that he was young and very ragged, and with the whiteness of fear and apprehension in his face and his staring eyes.  \"You German? French?\" he panted.  \"We are French,\" said Florette, rising. \"I can speak ze Anglaise a leetle.\"  \"You are not German?\" the visitor repeated as if relieved.  \"Only we are Zherman subjects, yess. Our name ees Leteur.\"  \"I am--American. My name--is Tom Slade. I escaped from the prison across there. My--my pal escaped with me----\"  The girl looked pityingly at him and shook her head while her parents listened curiously. \"We are sorry,\" she said, \"so sorry; but you were not wise to escape. We cannot shelter you. We are suspect already.\"  \"I have brought you news of Armand,\" said Tom. \"I can't--can't talk. We ran----Here, take this. He--he gave it to me--on the ship.\"  He handed Florette a little iron button, which she took with a trembling hand, watching him as he clutched the arbor post.  \"From Armand? You know heem?\" she asked, amazed. \"You are American?\"  \"He's American, too,\" said Tom, \"and he's with General Pershing in France. We're goin' to join him if you'll help us.\"  For a moment the girl stared straight at him, then turning to her father she poured out such a volley of French as would have staggered the grim authorities of poor Alsace. What she said the fugitive could not imagine, but presently old Pierre stepped forward and, throwing his one arm about the neck of the young American, kissed him several times with great fervor.  Tom Slade was not used to being kissed by anybody and he was greatly abashed. However, it might have been worse. What would he ever have done if the girl who spoke English in such a hesitating, pretty way had taken it into _her_ head to kiss him?     CHAPTER III  TOM'S STORY   \"You needn't be afraid,\" said Tom; \"we didn't leave any tracks; we came across the fields--all the way from the crossroads down there. We crawled along the fence. There ain't any tracks. I looked out for that.\"  Pausing in suspense, yet encouraged by their expectant silence, he spoke to some one behind him in the bushes and there emerged a young fellow quite as ragged as himself.  \"It's all right,\" said Tom confidently, and apparently in great relief. \"It's them.\"  \"You must come inside ze house,\" whispered Florette fearfully. \"It is not safe to talk here.\"  \"There isn't any one following us,\" said Tom's companion reassuringly. \"If we can just get some old clothes and some grub we'll be all right.\"  \"Zere is much danger,\" said the girl, unconvinced. \"We are always watched. But you are friends to Armand. We must help you.\"  She led the way into the house and into a simply furnished room lighted by a single lamp and as she cautiously shut the heavy wooden blinds and lowered the light, the two fugitives looked eagerly at the first signs of home life which they had seen in many a long day.  It was in vain that the two Americans declined the wine which old Pierre insisted upon their drinking.  \"You will drink zhust a leetle--yess?\" said the girl prettily. \"It is make in our own veenyard.\"  So the boys sipped a little of the wine and found it grateful to their weary bodies and overwrought nerves.  \"Now you can tell us--of Armand,\" she said eagerly.  Often during Tom's simple story she stole to the window and, opening the blind slightly, looked fearfully along the dark, quiet road. The very atmosphere of the room seemed charged with nervous apprehension and every sound of the breeze without startled the tense nerves of the little party.  Old Pierre and his wife, though quite unable to understand, listened keenly to every word uttered by the strangers, interrupting their daughter continually to make her translate this or that sentence.  \"There ain't so much need to worry,\" said Tom, with a kind of dogged self-confidence that relieved Florette not a little. \"I wouldn't of headed for here if I hadn't known I could do it without leaving any trace, 'cause I wouldn't want to get you into trouble.\"  Florette looked intently at the square, dull face before her with its big mouth and its suggestion of a frown. His shock of hair, always rebellious, was now in utter disorder. He was barefoot and his clothes were in that condition which only the neglect and squalor of a German prison camp can produce. But in his gaunt face there shone a look of determination and a something which seemed to encourage the girl to believe in him.  \"Are zey all like you--ze Americans?\" she asked.  \"Some of 'em are taller than me,\" he answered literally, \"but I got a good chest expansion. This feller's name is Archer. He belongs on a farm in New York.\"  She glanced at Archer and saw a round, red, merry face, still wearing that happy-go-lucky look which there is no mistaking. His skin was camouflaged by a generous coat of tan and those two strategic hills, his cheeks, had not been reduced by the assaults of hunger. There was, moreover, a look of mischief in his eyes, bespeaking a jaunty acceptance of whatever peril and adventure might befall and when he spoke he rolled his R's and screwed up his mouth accordingly.  \"Maybe you've heard of the Catskills,\" said Tom. \"That's where _he_ lives.\"  \"My dad's got a big apple orrcharrd therre,\" added Archer.  Florette Leteur had not heard of the Catskills, but she had heard a good deal about the Americans lately and she looked from one to the other of this hapless pair, who seemed almost to have dropped from the clouds.  \"You have been not wise to escape,\" she said sympathetically. \"Ze Prussians, zey are sure to catch you.--Tell me more of my bruzzer.\"  \"The Prussians ain't so smarrt,\" said Archer. \"They're good at some things, but when it comes to tracking and trailing and all that, they're no good. You neverr hearrd of any famous Gerrman scouts. They're clumsy. They couldn't stalk a mud turrtle.\"  \"You are not afraid of zem?\"  \"Surre, we ain't. Didn't we just put one overr on 'em?\"  \"We looped our trail,\" explained Tom to the puzzled girl. \"If they're after us at all they probably went north on a blind trail. We monkeyed the trees all the way through this woods near here.\"  \"He means we didn't touch the ground,\" explained Archer.  \"We made seven footprints getting across the road to the fence and then we washed 'em away by chucking sticks. And, anyway, we crossed the road backwards so they'd think we were going the other way. There ain't much danger--not tonight, anyway.\"  Again the girl looked from one to the other and then explained to her father as best she could.  \"You are wonderful,\" she said simply. \"We shall win ze war now.\"  \"I was working as a mess boy on a transport,\" said Tom; \"we brought over about five thousand soldiers. That's how I got acquainted with Frenchy--I mean Armand----\"  \"Yes!\" she cried, and at the mention of Armand old Pierre could scarcely keep his seat.  \"He came with some soldiers from Illinois. That's out west. He was good-natured and all the soldiers jollied him. But he always said he didn't mind that because they were all going to fight together to get Alsace back. Jollying means making fun of somebody--kind of,\" Tom added.  \"Oh, zat iss what he say?\" Florette cried. \"Zat iss my brother--Armand--yess!\"  She explained to her parents and then advanced upon Tom, who retreated to his second line of defence behind a chair to save himself from the awful peril of a grateful caress.  \"He told me all about how your father fought in the Franco-Prussian War,\" Tom went on, \"and he gave me this button and he said it was made from a cannon they used and----\"  \"Ah, yess, I know!\" Florette exclaimed delightedly.  \"He said if I should ever happen to be in Alsace all I'd have to do would be to show it to any French people and they'd help me. He said it was a kind of--a kind of a vow all the French people had--that the Germans didn't know anything about. And 'specially families that had men in the Franco-Prussian War. He told me how he escaped, too, and got to America, and about how he hit the German soldier that came to arrest you for singing the _Marseillaise_.\"  The girl's face colored with anger, and yet with pride.  \"Mostly what we came here for,\" Tom added in his expressionless way, \"was to get some food and get rested before we start again. We're going through Switzerland to join the Americans--and if you'll"]]]
