And be sure to put the safety back when you're through shooting.\"  \"Did you load the chamber?\" Blake Hartley demanded.  \"Sure. It's on safe, now.\"  \"Let me see.\" His father took the pistol, being careful to keep his finger out of the trigger guard, and looked at it. \"Yes, that's all right.\" He repeated the instructions Allan had given, stressing the importance of putting the safety on after using. \"Understand how it works, now?\" he asked.  \"Yes, I understand how it works. Thank you, Mr. Hartley. Thank you, too, young man.\"  Gutchall put the Luger in his hip pocket, made sure it wouldn't fall out, and took his departure.  \"You shouldn't have loaded it,\" Hartley _p√®re_ reproved, when he was gone.  Allan sighed. This was it; the masquerade was over.  \"I had to, to keep you from fooling with it,\" he said. \"I didn't want you finding out that I'd taken out the firing pin.\"  \"You what?\"  \"Gutchall didn't want that gun to shoot a dog. He has no dog. He meant to shoot his wife with it. He's a religious maniac; sees visions, hears voices, receives revelations, talks with the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost probably put him up to this caper. I'll submit that any man who holds long conversations with the Deity isn't to be trusted with a gun, and neither is any man who lies about why he wants one. And while I was at it, I called the police, on the upstairs phone. I had to use your name; I deepened my voice and talked through a handkerchief.\"  \"You--\" Blake Hartley jumped as though bee-stung. \"Why did you have to do that?\"  \"You know why. I couldn't have told them, 'This is little Allan Hartley, just thirteen years old; please, Mr. Policeman, go and arrest Frank Gutchall before he goes root-toot-toot at his wife with my pappa's Luger.' That would have gone over big, now, wouldn't it?\"  \"And suppose he really wants to shoot a dog; what sort of a mess will I be in?\"  \"No mess at all. If I'm wrong--which I'm not--I'll take the thump for it, myself. It'll pass for a dumb kid trick, and nothing'll be done. But if I'm right, you'll have to front for me. They'll keep your name out of it, but they'd give me a lot of cheap boy-hero publicity, which I don't want.\" He picked up his pencil again. \"We should have the complete returns in about twenty minutes.\"         *       *       *       *       *  That was a ten-minute under-estimate, and it was another quarter-hour before the detective-sergeant who returned the Luger had finished congratulating Blake Hartley and giving him the thanks of the Department. After he had gone, the lawyer picked up the Luger, withdrew the clip, and ejected the round in the chamber.  \"Well,\" he told his son, \"you were right. You saved that woman's life.\" He looked at the automatic, and then handed it across the table. \"Now, let's see you put that firing pin back.\"  Allan Hartley dismantled the weapon, inserted the missing part, and put it together again, then snapped it experimentally and returned it to his father. Blake Hartley looked at it again, and laid it on the table.  \"Now, son, suppose we have a little talk,\" he said softly.  \"But I explained everything.\" Allan objected innocently.  \"You did not,\" his father retorted. \"Yesterday you'd never have thought of a trick like this; why, you wouldn't even have known how to take this pistol apart. And at dinner, I caught you using language and expressing ideas that were entirely outside anything you'd ever known before. Now, I want to know--and I mean this literally.\"  Allan chuckled. \"I hope you're not toying with the rather medieval notion of possession,\" he said.  Blake Hartley started. Something very like that must have been flitting through his mind. He opened his mouth to say something, then closed it abruptly.  \"The trouble is, I'm not sure you aren't right,\" his son continued. \"You say you find me--changed. When did you first notice a difference?\"  \"Last night, you were still my little boy. This morning--\" Blake Hartley was talking more to himself than to Allan. \"I don't know. You were unusually silent at breakfast. And come to think of it, there was something ... something strange ... about you when I saw you in the hall, upstairs.... Allan!\" he burst out, vehemently. \"What has happened to you?\"  Allan Hartley felt a twinge of pain. What his father was going through was almost what he, himself, had endured, in the first few minutes after waking.  \"I wish I could be sure, myself, Dad,\" he said. \"You see, when I woke, this morning, I hadn't the least recollection of anything I'd done yesterday. August 4, 1945, that is,\" he specified. \"I was positively convinced that I was a man of forty-three, and my last memory was of lying on a stretcher, injured by a bomb explosion. And I was equally convinced that this had happened in 1975.\"  \"Huh?\" His father straightened. \"Did you say nineteen _seventy_-five?\" He thought for a moment. \"That's right; in 1975, you will be forty-three. A bomb, you say?\"  Allan nodded. \"During the siege of Buffalo, in the Third World War,\" he said, \"I was a captain in G5--Scientific Warfare, General Staff. There'd been a transpolar air invasion of Canada, and I'd been sent to the front to check on service failures of a new lubricating oil for combat equipment. A week after I got there, Ottawa fell, and the retreat started. We made a stand at Buffalo, and that was where I copped it. I remember being picked up, and getting a narcotic injection. The next thing I knew, I was in bed, upstairs, and it was 1945 again, and I was back in my own little thirteen-year-old body.\"  \"Oh, Allan, you just had a nightmare to end nightmares!\" his father assured him, laughing a trifle too heartily. \"That's all!\"  \"That was one of the first things I thought of. I had to reject it; it just wouldn't fit the facts. Look; a normal dream is part of the dreamer's own physical brain, isn't it? Well, here is a part about two thousand per cent greater than the whole from which it was taken. Which is absurd.\"  \"You mean all this Battle of Buffalo stuff? That's easy. All the radio commentators have been harping on the horrors of World War III, and you couldn't have avoided hearing some of it. You just have an undigested chunk of H. V. Kaltenborn raising hell in your subconscious.\"  \"It wasn't just World War III; it was everything. My four years at high school, and my four years at Penn State, and my seven years as a reporter on the Philadelphia Record. And my novels: '_Children of the Mist_,' '_Rose of Death_,' '_Conqueror's Road_.' They were no kid stuff. Why, yesterday I'd never even have thought of some of the ideas I used in my detective stories, that I published under a _nom-de-plume_. And my hobby, chemistry; I was pretty good at that. Patented a couple of processes that made me as much money as my writing. You think a thirteen-year-old just dreamed all that up? Or, here; you speak French, don't you?\" He switched languages and spoke at some length in good conversational slang-spiced Parisian. \"Too bad you don't speak Spanish, too,\" he added, reverting to English. \"Except for a Mexican accent you could cut with a machete, I'm even better there than in French. And I know some German, and a little Russian.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Blake Hartley was staring at his son, stunned. It was some time before he could make himself speak.  \"I could barely keep up with you, in French,\" he admitted. \"I can swear that in the last thirteen years of your life, you had absolutely no chance to learn it. All right; you lived till 1975, you say. Then, all of a sudden, you found yourself back here, thirteen years old, in 1945. I suppose you remember everything in between?\" he asked. \"Did you ever read James Branch Cabell? Remember Florian de Puysange, in 'The High Place'?\"  \"Yes. You find the same idea in 'Jurgen' too,\" Allan said. \"You know, I'm beginning to wonder if Cabell mightn't have known something he didn't want to write.\"  \"But it's impossible!\" Blake Hartley hit the table with his hand, so hard that the heavy pistol bounced. The loose round he had ejected from the chamber toppled over and started to roll, falling off the edge. He stooped and picked it up. \"How can you go back, against time? And the time you claim you came from doesn't exist, now; it hasn't happened yet.\" He reached for the pistol magazine, to insert the cartridge, and as he did, he saw the books in front of his son. \"Dunne's 'Experiment with Time,'\" he commented. \"And J. N. M. Tyrrell's 'Science and Psychical Phenomena.' Are you trying to work out a theory?\"  \"Yes.\" It encouraged Allan to see that his father had unconsciously adopted an adult-to-adult manner. \"I think I'm getting somewhere, too. You've read these books? Well, look, Dad; what's your attitude on precognition? The ability of the human mind to exhibit real knowledge, apart from logical inference, of future events? You think Dunne is telling the truth about his experiences? Or that the cases in Tyrrell's book are properly verified, and can't be explained away on the basis of chance?\"  Blake Hartley frowned. \"I don't know,\" he confessed. \"The evidence is the sort that any court in the world would accept, if it concerned ordinary, normal events. Especially the cases investigated by the Society for Psychical Research: they _have_ been verified. But how can anybody know of something that hasn't happened yet? If it hasn't happened yet, it doesn't exist, and you can't have real knowledge of something that has no real existence.\"  \"Tyrrell discusses that dilemma, and doesn't dispose of it. I think I can. If somebody has real knowledge of the future, then the future must be available to the present mind. And if any moment other than the bare present exists, then all time must be totally present; every moment must be perpetually coexistent with every other moment,\" Allan said.  [Illustration]  \"Yes. I think I see what you mean. That was Dunne's idea, wasn't it?\"  \"No. Dunne postulated an"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18833"],["title","With Clive in India; Or, The Beginnings of an Empire (#1)"],["body","that you would be able to get on comfortably. Of course it's a long way off, Mother, and I should have liked to stay at home, to be a help to you and the girls; but one can't have all one wishes. As far as I am concerned, myself, I would rather go out as a writer there, where I shall see strange sights and a strange country, than be stuck all my life at a desk in London.  \"What is Uncle like?\"  \"He is a short man, my dear, rather stiff and pompous, with a very stiff cravat. He used to give me his finger to shake, when I was a child, and I was always afraid of him. He married a most disagreeable woman, only a year or two before I married, myself. But I heard she died not very long afterwards;\" and so Mrs. Marryat got talking of her early days and relations, and was quite in good spirits again, by the time her daughters returned from school; and she told them what she was now coming to regard as the good fortune which had befallen their brother.  The girls were greatly affected. They adored their brother, and the thought that he was going away for years was terrible to them. Nothing that could be said pacified them in the slightest degree, and they did nothing but cry, until they retired to bed. Charlie was much affected by their sorrow; but when they had retired, he took his hat and went out to tell the news of his approaching departure to some of his chums.  The next day, Mrs. Marryat wrote thanking her uncle for his kindness, and saying that Charlie would go round to London by the packet which sailed on the following Monday; and would, if the wind were fair and all went well, reach London on the Wednesday.  School was, of course, at once given up, and the girls also had a holiday till their brother's departure. When the necessary clothes were ordered, there was little more to do; and Charlie spent the time, when his boy friends were in school, in walking with the girls along the shore, talking to them of the future, of the presents he would send them home, and of the life he should lead in India; while at other times he went out with his favourite schoolfellows, and joined in one last grand battle with the smack boys.  On Monday morning, after a sad farewell to his family, Charlie embarked on board the Yarmouth Belle, a packet which performed the journey to and from London once a fortnight. She was a roomy lugger, built for stowage rather than speed, and her hold was crammed and her deck piled with packages of salted fish. There were five or six other persons also bound for London, the journey to which was, in those days, regarded as an arduous undertaking.  As soon as the Yarmouth Belle issued from the mouth of the river, she began to pitch heavily; and Charlie, who from frequently going out with his father in the revenue cutter, was a good sailor, busied himself in doing his best for his afflicted fellow passengers. Towards evening the wind got up, and shifting ahead, the captain dropped anchor off Lowestoft. The next morning was finer, and the Yarmouth Belle continued her way. It was not, however, till Thursday afternoon that she dropped anchor in the Pool.  Charlie was soon on shore, and giving his trunk to a porter, desired him to lead the way to Bread Street, in which his uncle resided; for in the last century, such things as country villas were almost unknown, and the merchants of London for the most part resided in the houses where they carried on their business. Keeping close to the porter, to see that he did not make off with his trunk, for Charlie had received many warnings as to the extreme wickedness of London, he followed him through the busy streets, and arrived safely at his uncle's door.  It was now dusk, and Charlie, on giving his name, was shown upstairs to a large room, which was lighted by a fire blazing in the hearth. Standing with his back to this was a gentleman whom he at once recognized, from his mother's description, as her uncle, although he was a good deal more portly than when she had seen him last.  \"So you are my grandnephew,\" he said, holding out what Charlie considered to be a very limp and flabby hand towards him.  \"Yes, Uncle,\" Charlie said cheerfully; \"and we are very much obliged to you, Mamma and I, for your kindness.\"  \"Humph!\" the old gentleman grunted.  \"And how is it,\" he asked severely, \"that you were not here yesterday? My niece's letter led me to expect that you would arrive yesterday.\"  \"We came as fast as we could, Uncle,\" Charlie laughed; \"but of course the time depends upon the wind. The captain tells me that he has been as much as three weeks coming round.\"  Mr. Tufton grunted again as if to signify that such unpunctuality was altogether displeasing to him.  \"You are tall,\" he said, looking up at Charlie, who stood half a head above him, \"and thin, very thin. You have a loose way of standing, which I don't approve of.\"  \"I'm sorry I'm loose, sir,\" Charlie said gravely, \"if you do not approve of it; but you see, running about and playing games make one lissome. I suppose, now that's all over and I am going to spend my time in writing, I shall get stiffer.\"  \"I hope so, I hope so,\" Mr. Tufton said encouragingly, and as if stiffness were one of the most desirable things in life. \"I like to see young men with a sedate bearing.  \"And you left my niece and grandnieces well, I hope?\"  \"Quite well, thank you, sir,\" Charlie said; \"but, of course, a good deal upset with parting from me.\"  \"Yes,\" Mr. Tufton said; \"I suppose so. Women are so emotional. Now there's nothing I object to more than emotion.\"  As Charlie thought that this was probably the case, he was silent, although the idea vaguely occurred to him that he should like to excite a little emotion in his uncle, by the sudden insertion of a pin, or some other such means. The silence continued for some little time, and then Mr. Tufton said:  \"I always dine at two o'clock; but as probably you are hungry--I have observed that boys always are hungry--some food will be served you in the next room. I had already given my housekeeper orders. No doubt you will find it prepared. After that, you may like to take a walk in the streets. I have supper at nine, by which hour you will, of course, have returned.\"  Charlie, as he ate his meal, thought to himself that his uncle was a pompous old gentleman, and that it would be very hard work getting on with him, for the next three weeks. However, he consoled himself by the thought:  \"Kind is as kind does after all, and I expect the old gentleman is not as crusty as he looks.\"  Charlie had handed to Mr. Tufton a letter which his mother had given him, and when he returned from a ramble through the streets, he found that gentleman sitting by the fire, with lights upon a small table beside him. Upon this Mrs. Marryat's letter lay open.  \"So you have soon become tired of the streets of London, Grandnephew!\" he said.  \"There is not much to see, sir. The lamps do not burn very brightly, and the fog is coming on. I thought that, if it grew thicker, I might lose my way, and in that case I might not have been in at the hour you named for supper.\"  \"Humph!\" the other gentleman grunted. \"So your mother has taught you to be punctual to meals. But, no; boys' appetites teach them to be punctual then, if never at any other time.  \"And why, sir?\" he asked severely, \"Did my niece not write to me before?\"  \"I don't know, sir,\" Charlie said. \"I suppose she did not like--that is, she didn't think--that is--\"  \"Think, sir! Like, sir!\" said his uncle. \"What right had she either to think or to like? Her duty clearly was to have made me acquainted, at once, with all the circumstances. I suppose I had a right to say whether I approved of my grandnieces going tramping about the world as governesses, or not. It isn't because a woman chooses, by her folly, to separate herself from her family, that they are to be deprived of their rights in a matter of this kind. Eh, sir, what do you say to that?\" and Mr. Tufton looked very angry, indeed.  \"I don't know, sir,\" Charlie said. \"I have never thought the matter over.\"  \"Why, sir, suppose she had made you a tinker, sir, and you turned out a thief, as likely as not you would have done, and you'd been hung, sir, what then? Am I to have such discredit as this brought upon me, without my having any option in the matter?\"  \"I suppose not, sir,\" Charlie said. \"I hope I shouldn't have turned out a thief, even if I'd been a tinker; but perhaps it was because my mother feared that this might be the case, that she did give you the option.\"  His uncle looked at him keenly; but Charlie, though with some difficulty, maintained the gravest face.  \"It is well she did so,\" Mr. Tufton said; \"very well. If she had not done so, I should have known the reason why. And you, sir, do you like the thought of going to India?\"  \"Yes, Uncle, I like the thought very much, though I would rather, if I may say so, have gone as a cadet.\"  \"I thought so,\" Mr. Tufton said, sarcastically. \"I was sure of it. You wanted to wear a red coat and a sword, and to swagger about the streets of Calcutta, instead of making an honorable living and acquiring a fortune.\"  \"I don't think, sir,\" Charlie said, \"that the idea of the red coat and sword entered into my mind; but it seemed to me the choice of a life of activity and adventure, against one as a mere clerk.\"  \"Had you entered the military service of the Company, even if you didn't get shot, you could only hope to rise to the command of a regiment, ranking with a civilian very low down on the list. The stupidity of boys is unaccountable. It's a splendid career, sir, that I have opened to you; but if I'd known that you had no ambition, I would have put you into my own counting house; though there, that wouldn't have done either, for I know you would have blotted the ledger, and turned all the accounts topsy-turvy.  \"And now, sir, supper is ready;\" and the old gentleman led the way into the next room.
