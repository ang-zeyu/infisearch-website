CLEVER GRETHEL   THERE was once a cook called Grethel, who wore shoes with red heels, and when she went out in them she gave herself great airs, and thought herself very fine indeed. When she came home again, she would take a drink of wine to refresh herself, and as that gave her an appetite, she would take some of the best of whatever she was cooking, until she had had enough;--\"for,\" said she, \"a cook must know how things taste.\"  Now it happened that one day her master said to her,--  \"Grethel, I expect a guest this evening; you must make ready a pair of fowls.\"  \"Certainly, sir, I will,\" answered Grethel. So she killed the fowls, cleaned them, and plucked them, and put them on the spit, and then, as evening drew near, placed them before the fire to roast. And they began to be brown, and were nearly done, but the guest had not come.  \"If he does not make haste,\" cried Grethel to her master, \"I must take them away from the fire; it's a pity and a shame not to eat them now, just when they are done to a turn.\" And the master said he would run himself and fetch the guest. As soon as he had turned his back, Grethel took the fowls from before the fire.  \"Standing so long before the fire,\" said she, \"makes one hot and thirsty,--and who knows when they will come! in the meanwhile I will go to the cellar and have a drink.\" So down she ran, took up a mug, and saying, \"Here's to me!\" took a good draught. \"One good drink deserves another,\" she said \"and it should not be cut short;\" so she took another hearty draught. Then she went and put the fowls down to the fire again, and, basting them with butter, she turned the spit briskly round. And now they began to smell so good that Grethel saying, \"I must find out whether they really are all right,\" licked her fingers, and then cried, \"Well, I never! the fowls are good; it's a sin and a shame that no one is here to eat them!\"  So she ran to the window to see if her master and his guest were coming, but as she could see nobody she went back to her fowls. \"Why, one of the wings is burning!\" she cried presently, \"I had better eat it and get it out of the way.\" So she cut it off and ate it up, and it tasted good, and then she thought,  \"I had better cut off the other too, in case the master should miss anything.\" And when both wings had been disposed of she went and looked for the master, but still he did not come.  \"Who knows,\" said she, \"whether they are coming or not? they may have put up at an inn.\" And after a pause she said again, \"Come, I may as well make myself happy, and first I will make sure of a good drink and then of a good meal, and when all is done I shall be easy; the gifts of the gods are not to be despised.\" So first she ran down into the cellar and had a famous drink, and ate up one of the fowls with great relish. And when that was done, and still the master did not come, Grethel eyed the other fowl, saying, \"What one is the other must be, the two belong to each other, it is only fair that they should be both treated alike; perhaps, when I have had another drink, I shall be able to manage it.\" So she took another hearty drink, and then the second fowl went the way of the first.  Just as she was in the middle of it the master came back. \"Make haste, Grethel,\" cried he, \"the guest is coming directly!\" \"Very well, master,\" she answered, \"it will soon be ready.\" The master went to see that the table was properly laid, and, taking the great carving knife with which he meant to carve the fowls, he sharpened it upon the step. Presently came the guest, knocking very genteelly and softly at the front door. Grethel ran and looked to see who it was, and when she caught sight of the guest she put her finger on her lip saying, \"Hush! make the best haste you can out of this, for if my master catches you, it will be bad for you; he asked you to come to supper, but he really means to cut off your ears! Just listen how he is sharpening his knife!\"  The guest, hearing the noise of the sharpening, made off as fast as he could go. And Grethel ran screaming to her master. \"A pretty guest you have asked to the house!\" cried she.  \"How so, Grethel? what do you mean?\" asked he.  \"What indeed!\" said she; \"why, he has gone and run away with my pair of fowls that I had just dished up.\"  \"That's pretty sort of conduct!\" said the master, feeling very sorry about the fowls; \"he might at least have left me one, that I might have had something to eat.\" And he called out to him to stop, but the guest made as if he did not hear him; then he ran after him, the knife still in his hand, crying out, \"Only one! only one!\" meaning that the guest should let him have one of the fowls and not take both, but the guest thought he meant to have only one of his ears, and he ran so much the faster that he might get home with both of them safe.     The DEATH of the HEN   ONCE on a time the cock and the hen went to the nut mountain, and they agreed beforehand that whichever of them should find a nut was to divide it with the other. Now the hen found a great big nut, but said nothing about it, and was going to eat it all alone, but the kernel was such a fat one that she could not swallow it down, and it stuck in her throat, so that she was afraid she should choke.  \"Cock!\" cried she, \"run as fast as you can and fetch me some water, or I shall choke!\"  So the cock ran as fast as he could to the brook, and said, \"Brook, give me some water, the hen is up yonder choking with a big nut stuck in her throat.\" But the brook answered, \"First run to the bride and ask her for some red silk.\"  So the cock ran to the bride and said,  \"Bride, give me some red silk; the brook wants me to give him some red silk; I want him to give me some water, for the hen lies yonder choking with a big nut stuck in her throat.\"  But the bride answered,  \"First go and fetch me my garland that hangs on a willow.\" And the cock ran to the willow and pulled the garland from the bough and brought it to the bride, and the bride gave him red silk, and he brought it to the brook, and the brook gave him water. So then the cock brought the water to the hen, but alas, it was too late; the hen had choked in the meanwhile, and lay there dead. And the cock was so grieved that he cried aloud, and all the beasts came and lamented for the hen; and six mice built a little waggon, on which to carry the poor hen to her grave, and when it was ready they harnessed themselves to it, and the cock drove. On the way they met the fox.  \"Halloa, cock,\" cried he, \"where are you off to?\"  \"To bury my hen,\" answered the cock.  \"Can I come too?\" said the fox.  \"Yes, if you follow behind,\" said the cock.  So the fox followed behind and he was soon joined by the wolf, the bear, the stag, the lion, and all the beasts in the wood. And the procession went on till they came to a brook.  \"How shall we get over?\" said the cock. Now in the brook there was a straw, and he said,  \"I will lay myself across, so that you may pass over on me.\" But when the six mice had got upon this bridge, the straw slipped and fell into the water and they all tumbled in and were drowned. So they were as badly off as ever, when a coal came up and said he would lay himself across and they might pass over him; but no sooner had he touched the water than he hissed, went out, and was dead. A stone seeing this was touched with pity, and, wishing to help the cock, he laid himself across the stream. And the cock drew the waggon with the dead hen in it safely to the other side, and then began to draw the others who followed behind across too, but it was too much for him, the waggon turned over, and all tumbled into the water one on the top of another, and were drowned.  So the cock was left all alone with the dead hen, and he digged a grave and laid her in it, and he raised a mound above her, and sat himself down and lamented so sore that at last he died. And so they were all dead together.     HANS IN LUCK   HANS had served his master seven years, and at the end of the seventh year he said,  \"Master, my time is up; I want to go home and see my mother, so give me my wages.\"  \"You have served me truly and faithfully,\" said the master; \"as the service is, so must the wages be,\" and he gave him a lump of gold as big as his head. Hans pulled his handkerchief out of his pocket and tied up the lump of gold in it, hoisted it on his shoulder, and set off on his way home. And as he was trudging along, there came in sight a man riding on a spirited horse, and looking very gay and lively. \"Oh!\" cried Hans aloud, \"how splendid riding must be! sitting as much at one's ease as in an arm-chair, stumbling over no stones, saving one's shoes, and getting on one hardly knows how!\"  The horseman heard Hans say this, and called out to him,  \"Well Hans, what are you doing on foot?\"  \"I can't help myself,\" said Hans, \"I have this great lump to carry; to be sure, it is gold, but then I can't hold my head straight for it, and it hurts my shoulder.\"  \"I'll tell you what,\" said the horseman, \"we will change; I will give you my horse, and you shall give me your lump of gold.\"  \"With all my heart,\" said Hans; \"but I warn you, you will find it heavy.\" And the horseman got down, took the gold, and, helping Hans up, he gave the reins into his hand.  \"When you want to go fast,\" said he, \"you must click your tongue and cry 'Gee-up!'\"  And Hans, as he sat upon his horse, was glad at heart, and rode off with merry cheer. After a while he thought he should like to go quicker, so he began to click with his tongue and to cry \"Gee-up!\" And the horse began to trot, and Hans was thrown before he knew what was going to happen, and there he lay in the ditch by the side of the road. The horse would have got away but that he was caught by a peasant who was passing that way and driving a cow before him. And Hans pulled himself together and got"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1907"],["title","Rowdy of the Cross L (#1)"],["body","at the wind. Harry Conroy's sister, was she? And he swore. “I may have met him,” he parried, in a tone you'd never notice as being painstakingly careless. “I think I did, come to think of it.”  Miss Conroy seemed displeased, and presently the cause was forthcoming. “If you'd ever met him,” she said, “you'd hardly forget him.”  (Rowdy mentally agreed profanely.) “He's the best rider in the whole country--and the handsomest. He--he's splendid! And he's the only brother I've got. It's a pity you never got acquainted with him.”  “Yes,” lied Rowdy, and thought a good deal in a very short time. Harry Conroy's sister! Well, she wasn't to blame for that, of course; nor for thinking her brother a white man. “I remember I did see him ride once,”  he observed. “He was a whirlwind, all right--and he sure was handsome, too.”  Miss Conroy turned her face toward him and smiled her pleasure, and Rowdy hovered between heaven and--another place. He was glad she smiled, and he was afraid of what that subject might discover for his straightforward tongue in the way of pitfalls. It would not be nice to let her know what he really thought of her brother.  “This looks to me like a lane,” he said diplomatically. “We must be getting somewhere; don't you recognize any landmarks?”  Miss Conroy leaned forward and peered through the clouds of snow dust. Already the night was creeping down upon the land, stealthily turning the blank white of the blizzard into as blank a gray--which was as near darkness as it could get, because of the snow which fell and fell, and yet seemed never to find an abiding-place, but danced and swirled giddily in the wind as the cold froze it dry. There would be no more damp, clinging masses that night; it was sifting down like flour from a giant sieve; and of the supply there seemed no end.  “I don't know of any lanes around here,” she began dubiously, “unless it's--”  Vaughan looked sharply at her muffled figure and wondered why she broke off so suddenly. She was staring hard at the few, faint traces of landmarks; and, bundled in the red-and-yellow Navajo blanket, with her bright, dark eyes, she might easily have passed for a slim young squaw.  Out ahead, a dog began barking vaguely, and Rowdy turned eagerly to the sound. Dixie, scenting human habitation, stepped out more briskly through the snow, and even Chub lifted an ear briefly to show he heard.  “It may not be any one you know,” Vaughan remarked, and his voice showed his longing; “but it'll be shelter and a warm fire--and supper. Can you appreciate such blessings, Miss Conroy? I can. I've been in the saddle since sunrise; and I was so sure I'd strike the Cross L by dinner-time that I didn't bring a bite to eat. It was a sheep-camp where I stopped, and the grub didn't look good to me, anyway--I've called myself bad names all the afternoon for being more dainty than sensible. But it's all right now, I guess.”    CHAPTER 2. Miss Conroy Refuses Shelter.  The storm lifted suddenly, as storms have a way of doing, and a low, squat ranch-house stood dimly revealed against the bleak expanse of wind-tortured prairie. Rowdy gave an exultant little whoop and made for the gate, leaned and swung it open and rode through, dragging Chub after him by main strength, as usual. When he turned to close the gate after Miss Conroy he found her standing still in the lane.  “Come on in,” he called, with a trace of impatience born of his weariness and hunger.  “Thank you, no.” Miss Conroy's voice was as crisply cold as the wind which fluttered the Navajo blanket around her face. “I much prefer the blizzard.”   For a moment Rowdy found nothing to say; he just stared. Miss Conroy shifted uneasily in the saddle.  “This is old Bill Brown's place,” she explained reluctantly. “He--I'd rather freeze than go in!”  “Well, I guess that won't be hard to do,” he retorted curtly, “if you stay out much longer.”  The dog was growing hysterical over their presence, and Bill Brown himself came out to see what it was all about. He could see two dim figures at the gate.  “Hello!” he shouted. “Why don't yuh come on in? What yuh standing there chewing the rag for?”  Vaughan hesitated, his eyes upon Miss Conroy.  “Go in,” she commanded imperiously, quite as if he were a refractory pupil. “You're tired out, and hungry. I'm neither. Besides, I know where I am now. I can find my way without any trouble. Go in, I tell you!”  But Rowdy stayed where he was, with the gate creaking to and fro between them. Dixie circled till his back was to the wind. “I hope you don't think you're going to mill around out here alone,” Rowdy said tartly.  “I can manage very well. I'm not lost now, I tell you. Rodway's is only three miles from here, and I know the direction.”  Bill Brown waded out to them, wondering what weighty discussion was keeping them there in the cold. Vaughan he passed by with the cursory glance of a disinterested stranger, and went on to where Miss Conroy waited stubbornly in the lane.  “Oh, it's you!” he said grimly. “Well, come in and thaw out; I hope yuh didn't think yuh wouldn't be welcome yuh knew better. You got lost, I reckon. Come on--”  Miss Conroy struck Badger sharply across the flank and disappeared into the night. “When I ask shelter of you,” she flung back, “you'll know it.”  Rowdy started after, and met Bill Brown squarely in the gate. Bill eyed him sharply. “Say, young fellow, how'd you come by that packhorse?” he demanded, as Chub brushed past him.  “None of your damn' business,” snapped Rowdy, and drove the spurs into Dixie's ribs. But Chub was a handicap at any time; now, when he was tired, there was no getting anything like speed out of him; he clung to his shuffling trot, which was really no better than a walk. After five minutes spent alternately in spurring Dixie and yanking at Chub's lead-rope, Rowdy grew frightened and took to shouting. While they were in the lane Miss Conroy must perforce ride straight ahead, but the lane would not last always. As though with malicious intent, the snow swooped down again and the world became an unreal, nightmare world, wherein was nothing save shifting, blinding snowfloury and wind and bitter, numbing cold.  Rowdy stood in his stirrups, cupped his chilled fingers around his numbed lips, and sent a longdrawn “Who-ee!” shrilling weirdly into the night.  It seemed to him, after long listening, that from the right came faint reply, and he turned and rode recklessly, swearing at Chub for his slowness. He called again, and the answer, though faint, was unmistakable. He settled heavily into the saddle--too weak, from sheer relief, to call again. He had not known till then just how frightened he had been, and he was somewhat disconcerted at the discovery. In a minute the reaction passed and he shouted a loud hello.  “Hello?” came the voice of Miss Conroy, tantalizingly calm, and as superior as the greeting of Central. “Were you looking for me, Mr. Vaughan?”  She was close to him--so close that she had not needed to raise her voice perceptibly. Rowdy rode up alongside, remembering uncomfortably his prolonged shouting.  “I sure was,” he admitted. And then: “You rode off with my blanket on.”  He was very proud of his matter-of-fact tone.  “Oh!” Miss Conroy was almost deceived, and a bit disappointed. “I'll give it to you now, and you can go back--if you know the way.”  “No hurry,” said Rowdy politely. “I'll go on and see if you can find a place that looks good to you. You seem pretty particular.”  Miss Conroy may have blushed, in the shelter of the blanket. “I suppose it did look strange to you,” she confessed, but defiantly. “Bill Brown is an enemy to--Harry. He--because he lost a horse or two out of a field, one time, he--he actually accused Harry of taking them! He lied, of course, and nobody believed him; nobody could believe a thing like that about Harry. It was perfectly absurd. But he did his best to hurt Harry's name, and I would rather freeze than ask shelter of him. Wouldn't you--in my place, I mean?”  “I always stand up for my friends,” evaded Rowdy. “And if I had a brother--”  “Of course you'd be loyal,” approved Miss Conroy warmly. “But I didn't want you to come on; it isn't your quarrel. And I know the way now. You needn't have come any farther.”  “You forgot the blanket,” Rowdy reminded wickedly. “I think a lot of that Navajo.”  “You insisted upon my taking it,” she retorted, and took refuge in silence.  For a long hour they plodded blindly. Rowdy beat his hands often about his body to start the blood, and meditated yearnigly upon hot coffee and the things he liked best to eat. Also, a good long pull at a flask wouldn't be had, either, he thought. And he hoped this little schoolma'am knew where she was going--truth to tell, he doubted it.  After a while, it seemed that Miss Conroy doubted it also. She took to leaning forward and straining her eyes to see through the gray wall before.  “There should be a gate here,” she said dubiously, at last.  “It seems to me,” Rowdy ventured mildly, “if there were a gate, it would have some kind of a fence hitched to it; wouldn't it?”  Miss Conroy was in no mood for facetiousness, and refused to answer his question. “I surely can't have made a mistake,” she observed uneasily.  “It would be a wonder if you didn't, such a night as this,” he consoled. “I wouldn't bank on traveling straight myself, even if I knew the country--which I don't. And I've been in more blizzards than I'm years old.”  “Rodway's place can't be far away,” she said, brightening. “It may be farther to the east; shall we try that way--if you know which is east?”  “Sure, we'll try. It's all we can do. My packhorse is about all in, from the way he hangs back; if we don't strike something pretty soon I'll have to turn him loose.”  “Oh, don't do that,” she begged. “It would be too cruel. We're sure to reach Rodway's very soon.”  More plodding through drifts high and drifts low; more leaning from saddles to search anxiously for trace of"]]]
