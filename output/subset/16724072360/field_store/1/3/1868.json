The _note_ (from _nota_--Latin--a mark or sign) consists of either one, two, or three parts, ([Illustration]) these being referred to respectively as head, stem, and hook. The hook is often called _tail_ or cross-stroke. The stem appears on the right side of the head when turned up, but on the left side when turned down.[1] [Illustration] The hook is always on the right side.[2] [Illustration]  [Footnote 1: It should be noted at the outset that this statement regarding the down-turned stem on the left side of the note-head, and also a number of similar principles here cited, refer more specifically to music as it appears on the printed page. In the case of hand-copied music the down-turned stem appears on the right side of the note, thus [note symbol]. This is done because of greater facility in writing, and for the same reason other slight modifications of the notation here recommended may sometimes be encountered. In dealing with children it is best usually to follow as closely as possible the principles according to which _printed_ music is notated, in order to avoid those non-satisfying and often embarrassing explanations of differences which will otherwise be unavoidable.]  [Footnote 2: An exception to this rule occurs in the case of notes of unequal value stroked together, when the hook appears on the left side, thus [Illustration].]       In writing music with pen the head and hook are best made with      a heavy pressure on the pen point, but in writing at the board      they are most easily made by using a piece of chalk about an      inch long, turned on its side.  2. When only one part (or voice) is written on the staff, the following _rules for turning stems_ apply: (1) If the note-head is _below_ the third line, the stem must turn up. (2) If the note-head is _above_ the third line the stem must turn down. (3) If the note-head is _on_ the third line the stem is turned either up or down with due regard to the symmetrical appearance of the measure in which the note occurs. The following examples will illustrate these points.  [Illustration: Fig. 1.]  3. When two parts are written on the same staff, the stems of the upper part all turn up, and those of the lower part turn down, in order that the parts may be clearly distinguished. (Fig. 2.) But in music for piano and other instruments on which complete chords can be sounded by _one_ performer and also in simple, four-part vocal music in which all voices have approximately the same rhythm, several notes often have one stem in common as in Fig. 3.  [Illustration: Fig. 2.]  [Illustration: Fig. 3.]  4. Notes of small denomination (eighths and smaller) are often written in groups of two or more, all stems in the group being then connected by _one cross-stroke_. In such a case all the stems must of course be turned the same way, the direction being determined by the position of the majority of note-heads in the group. Notes thus _stroked_ may be of the same or of different denomination. See Fig. 4.  [Illustration: Fig. 4.]  In vocal music notes are never thus stroked when a syllable is given to each note. (See p. 19, Sec. 55, C.)  5. _Rests_, like notes, are best made with a heavy pen stroke or by using a piece of chalk on its side. (See note under Sec. 1.) The double-whole rest, whole rest, and half rest occupy the third space unless for the sake of clearness in writing two parts on the same staff they are written higher or lower. The rests of smaller denomination may be placed at any point on the staff, the hooks being always placed on the spaces. The hook of the eighth rest is usually placed on the _third_ space. Rests are sometimes dotted, but are never tied.  6. The _G clef_ should be begun at the second line rather than below the staff. Experiments have shown clearly that beginners learn to make it most easily in this way, and the process may be further simplified by dividing it into two parts, thus, [Illustration]. The descending stroke crosses the ascending curve at or near the fourth line. The circular part of the curve occupies approximately the first and second spaces.  7. The _F clef_ is made either thus, [bass clef symbol], or thus, [old bass clef symbol], the dots being placed one on either side of the fourth line of the staff, which is the particular point that the clef marks. The C _clef_ has also two forms, [C clef symbol] and [tenor clef symbol].  8. The _sharp_ is made with two light vertical strokes, and two heavy slanting ones, the slant of the latter being upward from left to right, [sharp]. The sharp should never be made thus, [Illustration].  The _double sharp_ is made either thus [double-sharp symbol] or [old double-sharp symbol], the first form being at present the more common.  9. The _flat_ is best made by a down stroke retraced part way up, the curve being made without lifting pen from paper. The _double flat_ consists of two flats,[3] [flat][flat]. The _natural_ or _cancel_ is made in two strokes, down-right and right-down, thus [Illustration].  [Footnote 3: It is to be hoped that the figure for the double-flat suggested by Mattheson (who also suggested the St. Andrew's cross ([symbol]) for the double-sharp) may some time be readopted. This figure was the Greek letter B, made thus, [Greek: b], and its use would make our notation one degree more uniform than it is at present.]  10. The _tie_ usually connects the _heads_ of notes, thus [tie symbol].  11. The _dot after a note_ always appears on a space, whether the note-head is on a line or space. (See Fig. 5.) In the case of a dot after a note on a line, the dot usually appears on the space _above_ that line if the next note is higher in position and on the space below it if the following note is lower.  [Illustration: Fig. 5.]       _Note._--Correct notation must be made a habit rather than a      theory, and in order to form the habit of writing correctly,      _drill_ is necessary. This may perhaps be best secured by      asking students to write (at the board or on ruled paper) from      verbal dictation, thus: Teacher says,       \"Key of B[flat], three-quarter measure: First measure, DO a      quarter note, RE a quarter, and MI a quarter. Second measure,      SOL a quarter, LA a quarter, and SOL a quarter. Third measure,      LA, TI, DO, RE, MI, eighths, stroked in pairs. Fourth measure,      high DO a dotted half.\" Pupils respond by writing the exercise      dictated, after which mistakes in the turning of stems, etc.,      are corrected. The _pitch names_ may be dictated instead of      the syllables if desired, and still further practice may be      provided by asking that the exercise be transposed to other      keys.     CHAPTER II  SYMBOLS OF MUSIC DEFINED   12. A _staff_ is a collection of parallel lines, together with the spaces belonging to them. The modern staff has five lines and six spaces, these being ordinarily referred to as first line, second line, third line, fourth line, and fifth line (beginning with the lowest); and space below (_i.e._, space below the first line), first space, second space, third space, fourth space, and space above.  The definition and discussion above refer more specifically to one of the portions of the \"great staff,\" the latter term being often applied to the combination of treble and bass staffs (with one "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19499"],["title","Music Notation and Terminology (#2)"],["body","line between) so commonly used in piano music, etc.  13. The _extent of the staff_ may be increased either above or below by the addition of short lines called _leger lines_,[4] and notes may be written on either these lines or on the spaces above and below them.  [Footnote 4: The word _leger_ is derived from the French word _LÉGER_, meaning light, and this use of the word refers to the fact that the leger lines, being added by hand, are lighter--_i.e._, less solid in color--than the printed lines of the staff itself.]  14. The lines and spaces constituting the staff (including leger lines if any) are often referred to as _staff degrees_, _i.e._, each separate line and space is considered to be \"a degree of the staff.\" The tones of a scale are also sometimes referred to as \"degrees of the scale.\"  15. A _clef_[5] is a sign placed on the staff to designate what pitches are to be represented by its lines and spaces. Thus, _e.g._, the G clef shows us not only that the second line of the staff represents G, but that the first line represents E, the first space F, etc. The F clef similarly shows us that the fifth line of the bass staff represents the first A below middle C, the fourth line the first F below middle C, etc.  [Footnote 5: The word _clef_ is derived from _CLAVIS_--a key--the reference being to the fact that the clef unlocks or makes clear the meaning of the staff, as a key to a puzzle enables us to solve the puzzle.]  The student should note that these clefs are merely modified forms of the letters G and F, which (among others) were used to designate the pitches represented by certain lines when staff notation was first inaugurated. For a fuller discussion of this matter see Appendix A, p. 101. [Transcriber's Note: Corrected error \"Appendix I\" in original.]  16. When the G clef is used the staff is usually referred to as the _treble staff_, and when the F clef is used, as the _bass staff_. Such expressions as \"singing from the treble clef,\" or \"singing in the treble clef,\" and \"singing in the bass clef\" are still frequently heard, but are preferably replaced by \"singing from the treble staff,\" and \"singing from the bass staff.\" Fig. 6 shows the permanent names of lines and spaces when the G and F clefs are used.[6]  [Footnote 6: The Germans use the same pitch designations as we do with two exceptions, viz., our B is called by them H, and our B[flat] is called B. The scale of C therefore reads: C, D, E, F, G, A, H, C; the scale of F reads F, G, A, B, C, D, E, F. The signatures are in all cases written exactly as we write them.  In France and Italy where the \"fixed DO\" system is in vogue, pitches are usually referred to by the syllable names; _e.g._, C is referred to as DO (or UT), D as RE, etc.]  [Illustration: Fig. 6.]  17. _The movable C clef_ [C clef symbol] or [tenor clef symbol], formerly in very common use, is now utilized for only two purposes, viz., (1) in music written for certain orchestral instruments (cello, viola, etc.) of extended range, in order to avoid having to use too many leger lines; and (2) for indicating the tenor part in vocal music. This latter usage seems also to be disappearing however, and the tenor part is commonly written on the treble staff, it being understood that the tones are to be sung an octave lower than the notes would indicate.  The C clef as used in its various positions is shown in Figs. 7, 8, and 9. It will be noted that in each case the line on which the clef is placed represents \"middle C.\"  [Illustration: Fig. 7. Soprano clef.]  [Illustration: Fig. 8. Alto clef.]  [Illustration: Fig. 9. Tenor clef.]  18. A _sharp_ is a character which causes the degree of the staff with which it is associated to represent a pitch one half-step higher than it otherwise would.       Thus in Fig. 10 (_a_) the fifth line and first space represent      the pitch F, but in Fig. 10 (_b_) these same staff degrees      represent an entirely different tone--F[sharp]. The student      should note that the sharp does not then _raise_ anything; it      merely causes a staff degree to represent a higher tone than      it otherwise would. There is just as much difference between F      and F[sharp] as between B and C, and yet one would never think      of referring to C as \"B raised\"!  [Illustration: Fig. 10.]  19. A _flat_ is a character that causes the degree of the staff with which it is associated to represent a tone one half-step lower than it otherwise would. (See note under Sec. 18 and apply the same discussion here.)  20. A _double-sharp_ causes the staff degree on which it is placed to represent a pitch one whole-step higher than it would without any sharp. Similarly, a double-flat causes the staff degree on which it is placed to represent a pitch one whole-step lower than it would without any flat.       Double-sharps and double-flats are generally used on staff      degrees that have already been sharped or flatted, therefore      their practical effect is to cause staff degrees to represent      pitches respectively a half-step higher and a half-step lower      than would be represented by those same degrees in their      diatonic condition. Thus in Fig. 10 (_b_) the first space in      its diatonic condition[7] represents F-sharp, and the      double-sharp on this degree would cause it to represent a      pitch one-half step higher than F-sharp, _i.e._,      F-double-sharp.  [Footnote 7: The expression \"diatonic condition\" as here used refers to the staff after the signature has been placed upon it, in other words after the staff has been prepared to represent the pitches of the diatonic scale.]     CHAPTER III  SYMBOLS OF MUSIC DEFINED (_Continued_)   21. The _natural_[8] (sometimes called _cancel_) annuls the effect of previous sharps, flats, double-sharps, and double-flats, within the measure in which it occurs. After a double-sharp or double-flat the combination of a natural with a sharp, or a natural with a flat is often found: in this case only one sharp or flat is annulled. (Sometimes also the single sharp or flat will be found by itself, cancelling the double-sharp or double-flat). The natural is often used when a composition changes key, as in Fig. 11, where a change from E to G is shown.  [Footnote 8: It has already been noted (p. 6, Note) that in the German scale our b-flat is called b, and our b is called H. From this difference in terminology has grown up the custom of using the H (now made [natural]) to show that _any_ staff-degree is in _natural_ condition, _i.e._, not sharped or flatted.]  [Illustration: Fig. 11.]  22. The group of sharps or flats (or absence of them) at the beginning of a staff partially indicates the key in which the composition is written. They are called collectively the _key-signature_.  23. The same key-signature may stand for either one of two keys, the major key, or its relative minor, hence in order to determine in what key a melody is one must note whether the tones are grouped about the major tonic DO or the minor tonic LA. In a harmonized composition it is almost always possible to determine the key by referring to the last bass note; if the final chord is clearly the DO chord the composition is in the major key, but if this final chord is clearly the LA chord then it is almost certain that the entire composition is in the minor key. Thus if a final chord appears as that in Fig. 12 the composition is clearly in G major, while if it appears as in Fig. 13, it is just as surely in E minor.  [Illustration: Fig. 12.]  [Illustration: Fig. 13.]  24. Sharps, flats, naturals, double-sharps and double-flats, occurring in the course of the composition (_i.e._, after the key signature) are called _accidentals_, whether they actually cause a staff degree to represent a different pitch as in Fig. 14 or simply make clear a notation about which there might otherwise be some doubt as in Fig. 15, measure two. The effect of such accidentals terminates at the bar.  [Illustration: Fig. 14.]  [Illustration: Fig. 15.]  25. In the case of a _tie across a bar_ an accidental remains in force until the combined value of the tied notes expires. In Fig. 16 first measure, third beat, an accidental sharp makes the third space represent the pitch C sharp. By virtue of the tie across the bar the third space continues to represent C sharp thru the first beat of the second measure, but for the remainder of the measure the third space will represent C unless the sharp is repeated as in Fig. 17.  [Illustration: Fig. 16.]  [Illustration: Fig. 17.]  26. The following rules for making staff degrees represent pitches different from those of the diatonic scale will be found useful by the beginner in the study of music notation. These rules are quoted from \"The Worcester Musical Manual,\" by Charles I. Rice.       1. To sharp a natural degree, use a sharp. Fig. 18.      2. To sharp a sharped degree, use a double sharp. Fig. 19.      3. To sharp a flatted degree, use a natural. Fig. 20.      4. To flat a natural degree, use a flat. Fig. 21.      5. To flat a flatted degree, use a double flat. Fig. 22.      6. To flat a sharped degree, use a natural. Fig. 23.  [Illustration: Fig. 18.]  [Illustration: Fig. 19.]  [Illustration: Fig. 20.]  [Illustration: Fig. 21.]  [Illustration: Fig. 22.]  [Illustration: Fig. 23.]  27. When two different notations represent the same pitch, the word _enharmonic_ is applied. Thus we may say that F sharp and G flat (on keyboard instruments at least) are enharmonically the same.  This word _enharmonic_ is used in such expressions as enharmonic change, enharmonic keys, enharmonic interval, enharmonic modulation, enharmonic relation, etc., and in all such combinations it has the same meaning, viz.--a change in notation but no change in the pitch represented.  28. A _note_ is a character expressing relative duration, which when placed on a staff indicates that a certain tone is to be sounded for a certain relative length of time. The pitch of"]]]
