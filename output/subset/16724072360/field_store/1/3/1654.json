Said agreement to take effect at once on the signing of this contract,' made in duplicate.  Signed, sealed and delivered the afore-written day, month and year, in the presence of       Witness,             MARY WALTERS, [seal.]             WILLIAM D'AUBREY, [seal.]   We both signed, and then remembered a witness was necessary. 'I will call Thomas,' said Mary. 'He won't know what we have written.' I bowed with a legal stiffness, and waited. She rang--no response.  She rang again. A loud laughter in the kitchen caused her to say, as usual, 'Oh! they cannot hear the bell,' and she tripped off lightly and called 'Susan! Susan! _Susan!_' 'and but the booming roars replied and fast the talk rolled on.' 'Susan,' said she, gently, over the bannisters.  'Susan is out, marm,' said a granite voice from the second story.  'Don't speak so loud, marm. Johnny has just gone to sleep, and I've had such trouble with him all the evening; he must have caught cold going to dancing school. You know, marm I begged you not to send him.  'Mrs. Phillips,' whispered Mary, in a crushed voice, 'where has Susan gone?'  'She went to her sister's, marm. Her child is very ill with the small pox, and she said she knew, if you knew he might die, that you would let her go and sit up with him this last night, poor, dear soul, bless his heart!'  Oh, how I chuckled!  'Why, Mrs. Phillips, just come down stairs, please; I want to speak to you.--Come into the library, only Mr. D'Aubrey is here.'  (Humph! ONLY Mr. D'Aubrey!--'Oh, for to-morrow!')  Enter Mrs. Phillips, one of those fat, pylygastric nurses, who divide the twenty-four hours into four days, so as to have three meals to each of their diurnal revolutions; whose digestive organs, if they could speak, would strike for wages; whose eyes move but never look; their atmosphere--what Germans might call expression--being that of massive rest.  She slides into the room and immediately sits down, moving her eyes up to her mistress with a patient and slightly suffering expression, while the process of deglutition is slowly going on.  I seize a book, pamphlet, anything, hold it in front of my face, and bite my segar in two.  'Did I understand you to say, Mrs. Phillips, that Susan had gone to sit up with a _small pox_ patient?'  'Her nephew, yes marm.'  'Oh, how very wrong in her--how--'  'I don't think so, marm.'  I ground my teeth.  'Why Mrs. Phillips?'  'The boy marm, may not be yours, but it is her _kin_ and she ought to know her duty to a sister's child.'  'Yes, but she might bring the disease to my little children! she'--'That's in the hands of Providence, marm.'  I ram a handkerchief down my mouth and choke--  'Well, as it is not your fault I need not speak to you--but please be so kind as to call Thomas, I only want him for a moment.' The celebrated Mrs. Phillips heaved a sigh, pregnant with bread, butter, cold meat and ale; and slid out of the room, crunching her way down stairs. I peeped at my sister--she looked pale and very anxiously perplexed, I pinched myself and kept silent. In a few minutes a voice was heard singing up the back stairs and--enter Sabina spread out with starch and heavily pomaded hair. 'Mrs. Phillips sent me to tell you marm that she had to make her gruel and the fire was low--and that Thomas had gone home.'  'Why, what time is it, Sabina?'  '_Eight_ o'clock,' I enunciate distinctly. For one moment Mary's eyes lit up with something like heroism, but before she could frame a sentence, the playful want of interest exhibited by Sabina, who leaned against the mantel-piece, straightening her cuffs, did the business, and she collapsed.  'Please tell Thomas, when he comes to-morrow, Sabina, I would rather not have him go home quite as early, because you see,' (oh how I mentally groaned at this humiliating nonsense,) 'I might want him. You won't forget, will you, Sabina?'  'No, marm. Is there anything else?' Having now made herself prim, and taken a quiet survey of the library and viewed me carefully, she was now desirous of retiring.  'One moment, Sabina,' said Mary, beginning to realize her false position before me, 'Who is down stairs?'  'Well, I couldn't tell you, marm.'  'Why not?'  'There are so many.'  'How, do you mean so many?'  'Why, marm, it's the cook's birthday; and she thought you would'nt mind her having a few friends, so she invited her _cousins_,' (looking at me as though she would ask, 'what have you got to say to that, Mr. Man?')  'Well, Sabina,' said Mary, coloring up in confusion, 'just sign your name to this--it is only as a witness.'  'I cannot write, marm,' answered dandy Amazon, very short at being exposed.  'Then send Elizabeth here.'  'She is out too, marm.'  'What? Elizabeth has gone out?'  'Yes marm, you see,' (becoming confidential,) 'the cook and her has quarrelled like--she neglected to ask her to her little party till late this evening, and so she got huffy and put on her things and dashed out of the house,' (at this time I had either an attack of the ague or was laughing so hard internally that it leaked through.)  'Is Dinah in?'  'Yes marm.'  'Ask her, please, to come here.'  Sabina tripped off with a satisfied air, and five--ten--fifteen minutes elapsed and no Ellen. I took out my memorandum and quickly wrote down a few valuable plans on the coming campaign. The clock struck half past eight, and my sister opened the entry door and listened--the kitchen door soon shut and somebody came up stairs slowly, with a waiter full of something.  'Is that you, Dinah?'  'Yes marm.'  'Why didn't you come before?'  'I don't know, mum.'  'Didn't Sabina tell you I wanted you?'  'No, mum. She told me you wanted to know how many were down stairs, and I counted seventeen.'  'Take care Dinah, you're spilling that milk!'  'I can't help it, this pitcher leaks.'  'Where's the children's bowl?'  'I don't know, mum--I think it's broke.'  'Broken! Why, I bought a new one yesterday.'  ''Tain't my fault.'  Hopelessly resigned, my sister Mary politely requested her to put down the waiter, and explained the nature of a witness's duty. We acknowledged our signatures and Dinah wrote out her name in a neat hand, then picked up the waiter and walked out of the room with the air of an injured innocent.  I jumped up, kissed my sister, informed her that for the next three months she was to be a _passive_ observer, asked her to retire, locked up the contract, and gave the bell one pull that brought half the household to the door.     PART II.  _A MAN'S PLAN._   As the servants rushed into the library they found me quietly reading a book and puffing at the pages. I slightly raised my eyes to this back ground of faces on which might be seen, surprise, anger, impertinence, curiosity and excitement. I slowly placed my book half open across my knee, with my hand resting on the cover, and with the other taking my segar out of my mouth, knocked the ashes off into a little glass tub; elevated my eyebrows and asked in perfect astonishment, yet measured tones:  'What-is-the-matter?'  'That's what we want to know sir;' exclaimed the cook, a little let down by my coolness.  'Nothing that I know of,' I replied, except that I took the liberty of ringing my bell,' increasing in volume as I spoke.  'We thought some one was sick, sir,' said Sabina.  'I don't want to know what _you_ thought,' I rolled out in emphatic base, 'I want the WAITER! which is _it_?'--That neuter cut them to the heart.  But they rallied--a revolt was imminent. I had lived in the family one year, with my sister as housekeeper, and had never made a remark to the servants, it being my habit in life to submit to what was not my business, or clear out. But now--_now_, with Imprimatur on my forehead, a clutch in my mental fingers, and a hungry longing to rule free: ha! ha!--Let us see. This was a trying moment--The vessel had been signalled, and my colors were to be shown--so here they go--the flag of the little brig 'one-man-power,' with the motto 'Anvil or hammar answer hammar,' is unfurled.  Hemmed in by swelling indignation, whisperings and sullen looks, I jumped up and yelled in stentorian voice:  'Leave my room! How dare you answer the waiter's bell? Send me the waiter and clear out, every one of you!' and, with a sweeping wave of my hand, I stalked towards the door. Reader, did you ever see the sun chase a big cloud right off a green field, and, with no respite, drive it headlong away over beyond the horizon? Such was the rapid departure of my stupefied retainers. On reaching the door, I slammed it to with a violence that echoed through the hushed and palsied house.  Oh the benefit of a good slam--not a push--nor a quick shut--nor even a bump, all of which show still a want of firmness and decision--but a good old-fashioned 'bang' as though it had got into your throat and you could'nt breathe--that life depended on shutting out a flash of lightning and you hadn't time to wait--that the harder you impelled it against the doorway the sooner would end fast fleeting agony--that the nearer you got to what might be called an _explosive shut_: the more complete would be your safety, that if all your concentrated passion could be, not flung, (that is too weak) but hurled at that one partition a vacuum might be made in your room towards which good impulses might be drawn inversely."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18770"],["title","A Christmas Story (#2)"],["body"," Many a good natured man who has been cornered by injustice has slammed off his anger, and is ready to forgive, but not give up. There is a dignity in this rapid developement of muscular power which admits of no surrender--the gauntlet has been thrown down, the chip has been knocked off the shoulder, the black flag is hoisted and skull and bones stand out in bold relief. There may be a calm, the wind may die out, but the monster waves once lashed up to a Titanic power move on of their own accord, and wash away the very vestige of resistance. Asking to _be_ forgiven after slamming a door is like touching off a Rodman gun, and then calling out to the fort in front to 'look out' 'take care!' 'do get out of the way.' A first class slam is cumulative long after the noise has ceased--the nerves go on slamming--the valves of the heart flap to and from--the tympanum roils a revelrie to all the shattered senses, the offender slammed at, at once subsides from rage to fear; the mental barometer falls--and apprehension--the requiescat--is a don't know what is coming next. A bona fide, abandoned slam is a Domestic Earthquake.  I next sat down on my Mexican chair, and waited for the rapid hatching of the egg. A register led up from the kitchen into my room, and though never used, formed one of those abominable listening tubes that might be truthfully called family tale-bearers. This time, however, I had the pleasure of overhearing the following fragmentary evidence of a reaction:  'He must be crazy.' 'Did he drink much after dinner?' 'I say, you have been here longer than I have, have you ever seen him so before?' Then a giggle, and some one saying: 'Is he married?'  'Sabina, ain't you ashamed to laugh?'--'poor thing--won't stay--gallows'--then silence, and in a few minutes one after another of the visitors passed by under the window on tip-toe, and almost immediately a soft knock and a pause. I thought * * * and acted.  'Come in,' said I, in one of those gentle and subdued voices that no one but a passionate man can possess. The door gradually opened, and there stood Susan, the devoted aunt.  I had placed a volume of engravings before my eyes, and was busily engaged in drawing some plan, on paper, as she entered. I went on for a little while in silence, when she said:  'I understood, sir----'  I said 'wait a minute,' and went on ruling one entire side, with double lines, in perfect forgetfulness of her presence.  When she spoke again, 'Did you send for me, sir?' I would have answered at once, for I felt awfully at appearing such a tyro; but the case was a desperate one of long standing, and required heroic treatment. I kept her waiting, at first as a lesson, that her imagination might take wings and fly to the uttermost realms of unhappiness. The second time, I thought I detected a little impatience in her voice, so I said, taking a pen and dipping it in red ink, 'wait one moment, Susan,' and went on lining and interlining. This was not reading, studying, nor writing; it was what she very well knew I could do any time. So it told on her. Each moment her valor oozed out, and as soon as I felt that the cup of bitterness was pretty well drained, I proceeded to offer up this victim as a sacrifice to peace.  'Susan, how is your sister's child?'  I looked straight into her. There was no sternness or smartness in my expression, but the gaze was mathematical. I was measuring her candor, and analyzing her mind.  She colored up and said, 'he's no better, sir; and they've given him up: but the doctor says good nursing will do wonders.'  'I think so, too. Go back to your sister and stay till he is better; I will supply your place.'  This puzzled her, but she could say nothing. I meant 'go' and she went.--There was no delay--I saw her walk by the window almost at once, and overheard the whisper, 'who next?'  I now rang the bell, and Dinah came to the door, saying, before she knocked, the waiter is out, sir, so I answered your ring.  'Do you know where Thomas lives?'  'Yes sir.'  'Then tell him I want him now--'  'Yes sir,' she disappeared.  Oh the benefit of that _slam_.  In half an hour in walked Thomas.  'Never do you enter my room without knocking. It is a piece of impertinence I will not put up with.'  'I did not mean anything by it, sir.'  'Well, don't do it again, and always take your hat off when you come before a gentleman or lady. Such ignorance might lose you a good place.'  His wages were high I knew. It was also winter, and he gave in. He stood still with his hat in hand and waited.  'Thomas I want you to bring the close carriage to the door with the two bays.'  'Yes sir; but the off horse cast his hind shoe yesterday and I am afraid.'  'You need not be, the ground is covered with snow. I shall want the carriage in fifteen minutes.'  'Yes sir, but--'  'But what?'  'I left the carriage this morning at the blacksmiths to have a new tire put on it, sir.'  'Who told you to?'  'Nobody, sir.'  'Then never do anything of that kind again without first reporting it to me.'  'Yes sir,' moving slightly towards the door as though it was all settled now.  'What other vehicle have you got in the stable?'  'The Phæton, sir; the open box wagon and the carryall.'  'Very well then, bring the nigh horse round in the carryall.'  'He never went in single harness since I drove Mrs. ----'  'Well, then, put the other one in.'  'Nor him neither, sir.'  'Humph!' it looked a little black.  'Well, where is the other horse, the gray, that your mistress always drives when alone?'  'He is at the veterinary surgeons, sir.--I took him there last Monday and he is to be blistered for two weeks off and on, sir.'  'Well, Thomas, as the coachman of the family, I ask you what can be done.  'I _must_ go out to-night. Can you suggest anything?'  'Nothing but to hire a hack, sir.'  'That's a very good idea, how far is the livery stable from here?'  'Just next to where I live, sir. I can get one in a minute, sir.'  Oh! so cheerfully.  'Very well, Thomas, just harness the two bays and ride down there and put them to one. Tell the livery stable keeper that I wish it, and will pay for the use of it.'  'But, sir, it is----'  'Thomas, I would advise you not to be long. You ought to be ashamed to call yourself a coachman, and have what is under your charge in such a condition. The idea of a horse two days without a shoe.'  'It isn't my----'  'Not a word--go and do your duty in future. I shall expect you here in half an hour.'  He backed out of the room, longing to say something (what it was I don't care) but completely at sea. As he passed under my window, (though I have not sworn for many years,) I am pretty sure I heard several full sized oaths. At the appointed time the bell rang and I went out and got into the carriage. The horses looked very warm, and, though the night was cold, one was covered with foam. I said nothing, but told him to drive to Susan's sister's.  On arriving at the door, I heard sounds of very lively music for a dying child, and saw the house all lighted up.  'Oh, I understand, it is one of those Hibernian wakes. Poor thing!' and I began to pardon Susan, feel sorry for the coachman, and made up my mind to give $10 towards the sepulchral expenses. As I entered the house, surcharged with benevolence and overcome by a repentant feeling, I caught sight of Susan and a strapping man whirling round the floor to the tune of the Irish Washwoman. I approached her and said, 'I hope he is better.' She uttered a scream and ran out of the room.  The next morning after having gone over everything in the house, I sent for each servant and told them quietly but firmly that my sister's health was not very good, and that I was housekeeper--that as they had engaged to fill certain positions, I should take it for granted they understood their business; that I had neither the time nor would I take the trouble to overlook their work, but that as soon as I saw anything wrong they would hear from me. If they wanted anything I was the person. My housekeeping hours were from 9 till 10 a. m., no more. If they could not take the trouble to ask for what they wanted at that time, they could go without till the next day. I should not tell them what to do or when to do it, but if it wasn't done, they would certainly leave. That I allowed no company and gave them certain nights to go out, but if anything special and _true_ was the matter I was ready to assist, 'and now,' said I, 'no quarreling down stairs; each one to their work and no complaining.--The moment you are discontented come to me and you can go at once if you choose. I do not want any notice ever, except where a baby is concerned.' This done I then advertised for a cook. The next day my cook, down stair, came up to me quite flushed, and wanted to know if I intended to turn her away. I said no, I had no idea of it, but thought it was a very good plan to have two in the house; that I intended making the new one a waiter, and then if anything happened, such as the sudden departure, 'of my cook,' I said, looking right at her, 'for you know they are quick tempered, why then I have one on hand.' She colored up and retired. After going through a great deal of nonsense about the words 'help' and 'servants,' I at length got what I wanted and all went on smoothly for a time.  My plan for detecting neglect in the cleaning of a room, was to stick half a dozen pins in different places about it--some on the walls, in the window and other places that ought to be wiped. If I found them there after the cleaning, I became suddenly very disagreeable.  During my sister's administration, I had been obliged to wait sometimes three weeks before she could find time, for her servants, to put a button on my waistcoat. Now, when I wanted anything done, the first person that passed my library door was stopped, no matter what her work might be at the time, sent for a clothes brush, needle or hammar, and the thing was done at once. It acted like a"]]]
