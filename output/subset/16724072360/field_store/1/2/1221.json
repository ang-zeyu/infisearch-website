It     blights too many hopes; it carries with it too much of sorrow and     loss. It is a public calamity.     VOICES NOT OUR OWN   Many peculiar circumstances and events connected with my childhood throng the chambers of memory. For some twelve months, when I was about eight years old, I repeatedly heard a voice, calling me distinctly by name, three times, in an ascending scale. I thought this was my mother's voice, and sometimes went to her, beseeching her to tell me what she wanted. Her answer was always, \"Nothing, child! What do you mean?\" Then I would say, \"Mother, who _did_ call me? I heard somebody call _Mary_, three times!\" This continued until I grew discouraged, and my mother was perplexed and anxious.  One day, when my cousin, Mehitable Huntoon, was visiting us, and I sat in a little chair by her side, in the same room with grandmother,--the call again came, so loud that Mehitable heard it, though I had ceased to notice it. Greatly surprised, my cousin turned to me and said, \"Your mother is calling you!\" but I answered not, till again the same call was thrice repeated. Mehitable then said sharply, \"Why don't you go? your mother is calling you!\" I then left the room, went to my mother, and once more asked her if she had summoned me? She answered as always before. Then I earnestly declared my cousin had heard the voice, and said that mother wanted me. Accordingly she returned with me to grandmother's room, and led my cousin into an adjoining apartment. The door was ajar, and I listened with bated breath. Mother told Mehitable all about this mysterious voice, and asked if she really did hear Mary's name pronounced in audible tones. My cousin answered quickly, and emphasized her affirmation.  That night, before going to rest, my mother read to me the Scriptural narrative of little Samuel, and bade me, when the voice called again, to reply as he did, \"Speak, Lord; for Thy servant heareth.\" The voice came; but I was afraid, and did not answer. Afterward I wept, and prayed that God would forgive me, resolving to do, next time, as my mother had bidden me. When the call came again I did answer, in the words of Samuel, but never again to the material senses was that mysterious call repeated.      Is it not much that I may worship Him,       With naught my spirit's breathings to control,     And feel His presence in the vast and dim       And whispering woods, where dying thunders roll     From the far cataracts? Shall I not rejoice     That I have learned at last to know His voice       From man's?--I will rejoice! My soaring soul     Now hath redeemed her birthright of the day,     And won, through clouds, to Him, her own unfettered way!                                               --MRS. HEMANS.     EARLY STUDIES   My father was taught to believe that my brain was too large for my body and so kept me much out of school, but I gained book-knowledge with far less labor than is usually requisite. At ten years of age I was as familiar with Lindley Murray's Grammar as with the Westminster Catechism; and the latter I had to repeat every Sunday. My favorite studies were natural philosophy, logic, and moral science. From my brother Albert I received lessons in the ancient tongues, Hebrew, Greek, and Latin. My brother studied Hebrew during his college vacations. After my discovery of Christian Science, most of the knowledge I had gleaned from schoolbooks vanished like a dream.  Learning was so illumined, that grammar was eclipsed. Etymology was divine history, voicing the idea of God in man's origin and signification. Syntax was spiritual order and unity. Prosody, the song of angels, and no earthly or inglorious theme.     GIRLHOOD COMPOSITION   From childhood I was a verse-maker. Poetry suited my emotions better than prose. The following is one of my girlhood productions.  ALPHABET AND BAYONET      If fancy plumes aerial flight,       Go fix thy restless mind     On learning's lore and wisdom's might,       And live to bless mankind.     The sword is sheathed, 'tis freedom's hour,       No despot bears misrule,     Where knowledge plants the foot of power       In our God-blessed free school.      Forth from this fount the streamlets flow,       That widen in their course.     Hero and sage arise to show       Science the mighty source,     And laud the land whose talents rock       The cradle of her power,     And wreaths are twined round Plymouth Rock,       From erudition's bower.      Farther than feet of chamois fall,       Free as the generous air,     Strains nobler far than clarion call       Wake freedom's welcome, where     Minerva's silver sandals still       Are loosed, and not effete;     Where echoes still my day-dreams thrill,       Woke by her fancied feet.     THEOLOGICAL REMINISCENCE   At the age of twelve[A] I was admitted to the Congregational (Trinitarian) Church, my parents having been members of that body for a half-century. In connection with this event, some circumstances are noteworthy. Before this step was taken, the doctrine of unconditional election, or predestination, greatly troubled me; for I was unwilling to be saved, if my brothers and sisters were to be numbered among those who were doomed to perpetual banishment from God. So perturbed was I by the thoughts aroused by this erroneous doctrine, that the family doctor was summoned, and pronounced me stricken with fever.  My father's relentless theology emphasized belief in a final judgment-day, in the danger of endless punishment, and in a Jehovah merciless towards unbelievers; and of these things he now spoke, hoping to win me from dreaded heresy.  My mother, as she bathed my burning temples, bade me lean on God's love, which would give me rest, if I went to Him in prayer, as I was wont to do, seeking His guidance. I prayed; and a soft glow of ineffable joy came over me. The fever was gone, and I rose and dressed myself, in a normal condition of health. Mother saw this, and was glad. The physician marvelled; and the \"horrible decree\" of predestination--as John Calvin rightly called his own tenet--forever lost its power over me.  When the meeting was held for the examination of candidates for membership, I was of course present. The pastor was an old-school expounder of the strictest Presbyterian doctrines. He was apparently as eager to have unbelievers in these dogmas lost, as he was to have elect believers converted and rescued from perdition; for both salvation and condemnation depended, according to his views, upon the good pleasure of infinite Love. However, I was ready for his doleful questions, which I answered without a tremor, declaring that never could I unite with the church, if assent to this doctrine was essential thereto.  Distinctly do I recall what followed. I stoutly maintained that I was willing to trust God, and take my chance of spiritual safety with my brothers and sisters,--not one of whom had then made any profession of religion,--even if my creedal doubts left me outside the doors. The minister then wished me to tell him when I had experienced a change of heart; but tearfully I had to respond that I could not designate any precise time. Nevertheless he persisted in the assertion that I _had_ been truly regenerated, and asked me to say how I felt when the new light dawned within me. I replied that I could only answer him in the words of the Psalmist: \"Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts: and see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.\"  This was so earnestly said, that even the oldest church-members wept. After the meeting was over they came and kissed me. To the astonishment of many, the good clergyman's heart also melted, and he received me into their communion, and my protest along with me. My connection with this religious body was retained till I founded a church of my own, built on the basis of Christian Science, \"Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner-stone.\"  In confidence of faith, I could say in David's words, \"I will go in the strength of the Lord God: I will make mention of Thy righteousness, even of Thine only. O God, Thou hast taught me from my youth: and hitherto have I declared Thy wondrous works.\" (Psalms lxxi. 16, 17.)  In the year 1878 I was called to preach in Boston at the Baptist Tabernacle of Rev. Daniel C. Eddy, D.D.,--by the pastor of this church. I accepted the invitation and commenced work.  The congregation so increased in number the pews were not sufficient to seat the audience and benches were used in the aisles. At the close of my engagement we parted in Christian fellowship, if not in full unity of doctrine.  Our last vestry meeting was made memorable by eloquent addresses from persons who feelingly testified to having been healed through my preaching. Among other diseases cured they specified cancers. The cases described had been treated and given over by physicians of the popular schools of medicine, but I had not heard of these cases till the persons who divulged their secret joy were healed. A prominent churchman agreeably informed the congregation that many others present had been healed under my preaching, but were too timid to testify in public.  One memorable Sunday afternoon, a soprano,--clear, strong, sympathetic,--floating up from the pews, caught my ear. When the meeting was over, two ladies pushing their way through the crowd reached the platform. With tears of joy flooding her eyes--for she was a mother--one of them said, \"Did you hear my daughter sing? Why, she has not sung before since she left the choir and was in consumption! When she entered this church one hour ago she could not speak a loud word, and now, oh, thank God, she is healed!\"  It was not an uncommon occurrence in my own church for the sick to be healed by my sermon. Many pale cripples went into the church leaning on crutches who went out carrying them on their shoulders. \"And these signs"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16734"],["title","Retrospection and Introspection (#2)"],["body","follow them that believe.\"  The charter for The Mother Church in Boston was obtained June, 1879,[B] and the same month the members, twenty-six in number, extended a call to Mary B.G. Eddy to become their pastor. She accepted the call, and was ordained A.D. 1881.     THE COUNTRY-SEAT  Written in youth, while visiting a family friend in the beautiful suburbs of Boston.       Wild spirit of song,--midst the zephyrs at play     In bowers of beauty,--I bend to thy lay,     And woo, while I worship in deep sylvan spot,     The Muses' soft echoes to kindle the grot.     Wake chords of my lyre, with musical kiss,     To vibrate and tremble with accents of bliss.      Here morning peers out, from her crimson repose,     On proud Prairie Queen and the modest Moss-rose;     And vesper reclines--when the dewdrop is shed     On the heart of the pink--in its odorous bed;     But Flora has stolen the rainbow and sky,     To sprinkle the flowers with exquisite dye.      Here fame-honored hickory rears his bold form,     And bares a brave breast to the lightning and storm,     While palm, bay, and laurel, in classical glee,     Chase tulip, magnolia, and fragrant fringe-tree;     And sturdy horse-chestnut for centuries hath given     Its feathery blossom and branches to heaven.      Here is life! Here is youth! Here the poet's world-wish,--     Cool waters at play with the gold-gleaming fish;     While cactus a mellower glory receives     From light colored softly by blossom and leaves;     And nestling alder is whispering low,     In lap of the pear-tree, with musical flow.[C]      Dark sentinel hedgerow is guarding repose,     Midst grotto and songlet and streamlet that flows     Where beauty and perfume from buds burst away,     And ope their closed cells to the bright, laughing day;     Yet, dwellers in Eden, earth yields you her tear,--     Oft plucked for the banquet, but laid on the bier.      Earth's beauty and glory delude as the shrine     Or fount of real joy and of visions divine;     But hope, as the eaglet that spurneth the sod,     May soar above matter, to fasten on God,     And freely adore all His spirit hath made,     Where rapture and radiance and glory ne'er fade.      Oh, give me the spot where affection may dwell     In sacred communion with home's magic spell!     Where flowers of feeling are fragrant and fair,     And those we most love find a happiness rare;     But clouds are a presage,--they darken my lay:     This life is a shadow, and hastens away.     MARRIAGE AND PARENTAGE   In 1843 I was united to my first husband, Colonel George Washington Glover of Charleston, South Carolina, the ceremony taking place under the paternal roof in Tilton.  After parting with the dear home circle I went with him to the South; but he was spared to me for only one brief year. He was in Wilmington, North Carolina, on business, when the yellow-fever raged in that city, and was suddenly attacked by this insidious disease, which in his case proved fatal.  My husband was a freemason, being a member in Saint Andrew's Lodge, Number 10, and of Union Chapter, Number 3, of Royal Arch masons. He was highly esteemed and sincerely lamented by a large circle of friends and acquaintances, whose kindness and sympathy helped to support me in this terrible bereavement. A month later I returned to New Hampshire, where, at the end of four months, my babe was born.  Colonel Glover's tender devotion to his young bride was remarked by all observers. With his parting breath he gave pathetic directions to his brother masons about accompanying her on her sad journey to the North. Here it is but justice to record, they performed their obligations most faithfully.  After returning to the paternal roof I lost all my husband's property, except what money I had brought with me; and remained with my parents until after my mother's decease.  A few months before my father's second marriage, to Mrs. Elizabeth Patterson Duncan, sister of Lieutenant-Governor George W. Patterson of New York, my little son, about four years of age, was sent away from me, and put under the care of our family nurse, who had married, and resided in the northern part of New Hampshire. I had no training for self-support, and my home I regarded as very precious. The night before my child was taken from me, I knelt by his side throughout the dark hours, hoping for a vision of relief from this trial. The following lines are taken from my poem, \"Mother's Darling,\" written after this separation:--      Thy smile through tears, as sunshine o'er the sea,       Awoke new beauty in the surge's roll!     Oh, life is dead, bereft of all, with thee,--       Star of my earthly hope, babe of my soul.  My second marriage was very unfortunate, and from it I was compelled to ask for a bill of divorce, which was granted me in the city of Salem, Massachusetts.  My dominant thought in marrying again was to get back my child, but after our marriage his stepfather was not willing he should have a home with me. A plot was consummated for keeping us apart. The family to whose care he was committed very soon removed to what was then regarded as the Far West.  After his removal a letter was read to my little son, informing him that his mother was dead and buried. Without my knowledge a guardian was appointed him, and I was then informed that my son was lost. Every means within my power was employed to find him, but without success. We never met again until he had reached the age of thirty-four, had a wife and two children, and by a strange providence had learned that his mother still lived, and came to see me in Massachusetts.  Meanwhile he had served as a volunteer throughout the war for the Union, and at its expiration was appointed United States Marshal of the Territory of Dakota.  It is well to know, dear reader, that our material, mortal history is but the record of dreams, not of man's real existence, and the dream has no place in the Science of being. It is \"as a tale that is told,\" and \"as the shadow when it declineth.\" The heavenly intent of earth's shadows is to chasten the affections, to rebuke human consciousness and turn it gladly from a material, false sense of life and happiness, to spiritual joy and true estimate of being.  The awakening from a false sense of life, substance, and mind in matter, is as yet imperfect; but for those lucid and enduring lessons of Love which tend to this result, I bless God.  Mere historic incidents and personal events are frivolous and of no moment, unless they illustrate the ethics of Truth. To this end, but only to this end, such narrations may be admissible and advisable; but if spiritual conclusions are separated from their premises, the _nexus_ is lost, and the argument, with its rightful conclusions, becomes correspondingly obscure. The human history needs to be revised, and the material record expunged.  The Gospel narratives bear brief testimony even to the life of our great Master. His spiritual noumenon and phenomenon silenced portraiture. Writers less wise than the apostles essayed in the Apocryphal New Testament a legendary and traditional history of the early life of Jesus. But St. Paul summarized the character of Jesus as the model of Christianity, in these words: \"Consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself.\" \"Who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.\"  It may be that the mortal life-battle still wages, and must continue till its involved errors are vanquished by victory-bringing Science; but this triumph will come! God is over all. He alone is our origin, aim, and being. The real man is not of the dust, nor is he ever created through the flesh; for his father and mother are the one Spirit, and his brethren are all the children of one parent, the eternal good.     EMERGENCE INTO LIGHT   The trend of human life was too eventful to leave me undisturbed in the illusion that this so-called life could be a real and abiding rest. All things earthly must ultimately yield to the irony of fate, or else be merged into the one infinite Love.  As these pungent lessons became clearer, they grew sterner. Previously the cloud of mortal mind seemed to have a silver lining; but now it was not even fringed with light. Matter was no longer spanned with its rainbow of promise. The world was dark. The oncoming hours were indicated by no floral dial. The senses could not prophesy sunrise or starlight.  Thus it was when the moment arrived of the heart's bridal to more spiritual existence. When the door opened, I was waiting and watching; and, lo, the bridegroom came! The character of the Christ was illuminated by the midnight torches of Spirit. My heart knew its Redeemer. He whom my affections had diligently sought was as the One \"altogether lovely,\" as \"the chiefest,\" the only, \"among ten thousand.\" Soulless famine had fled. Agnosticism, pantheism, and theosophy were void. Being was beautiful, its substance, cause, and currents were God and His idea. I had touched the hem of Christian Science.     THE GREAT DISCOVERY   It was in Massachusetts, in February, 1866, and after the death of the magnetic doctor, Mr. P.P. Quimby, whom spiritualists would associate therewith, but who was in no wise connected with this event, that I discovered the Science of divine metaphysical healing which I afterwards named Christian Science. The discovery came to pass in this way. During twenty years prior to my discovery I had been trying to trace all physical effects to a mental cause; and in the latter part of 1866 I gained the scientific certainty that all causation was Mind, and every effect a mental phenomenon.  My immediate recovery from the effects of an injury caused by an accident, an injury that neither medicine nor surgery could reach, was the falling apple that led me to the discovery how to be well myself, and how to make others so.
