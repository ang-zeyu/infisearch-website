In short, upon the nature and arrangement and conformation of the scales on the hair-shafts, especially as regards those free upper edges, depends the distinction of the value of many classes of wool and fur. These scales vary both as to nature and arrangement in the case of the hairs of different animals, so that by the aid of the microscope we have often a means of determining from what kind of animal the hair has been derived. It is on the nature of this outside scaly covering of the shaft, and in the manner of attachment of these scaly plates, that the true distinction between wool and hair rests. The principal epidermal characteristic of a true wool is the capacity of its fibres to felt or mat together. This arises from the greater looseness of the scaly covering of the hair, so that when opposing hairs come into contact, the scales interlock (see Fig. 9), and thus the fibres are held together. Just as with hair, the scales of which have their free edges pointing upwards away from the root, and towards the extremity of the hair, so with wool. When the wool is on the back of the sheep, the scales of the woolly hair all point in the same direction, so that while maintained in that attitude the individual hairs slide over one another, and do not tend to felt or mat; if they did, woe betide the animal. The fact of the peculiar serrated, scaly structure of hair and wool is easily proved by working a hair between the fingers. If, for instance, a human hair be placed between finger and thumb, and gently rubbed by the alternate motion of finger and thumb together, it will then invariably move in the direction of the root, quite independently of the will of the person performing the test. A glance at the form of the typical wool fibres shown (see Fig. 10), will show the considerable difference between a wool and a hair fibre. You will observe that the scales of the wool fibre are rather pointed than rounded at their free edges, and that at intervals we have a kind of composite and jagged-edged funnels, fitting into each other, and thus making up the covering of the cylindrical portion of the fibre. The sharpened, jagged edges enable these scales more easily to get under the opposing scales, and to penetrate inwards and downwards according to the pressure exerted. The free edges of the scales of wool are much longer and deeper than in the case of hair. In hair the overlapping scales are attached to the under layer up to the edges of those scales, and at this extremity can only be detached by the use of certain reagents. But this is not so with wool, for here the ends of the scales are, for nearly two-thirds of their length, free, and are, moreover, partially turned outwards. One of the fibres shown in Fig. 10 is that of the merino sheep, and is one of the most valuable and beautiful wools grown. There you have the type of a fibre best suited for textile purposes, and the more closely different hairs approach this, the more suitable and valuable they become for those purposes, and _vice versâ_. With regard to the curly structure of wool, which increases the matting tendency, though the true cause of this curl is not known, there appears to be a close relationship between the tendency to curl, the fineness of the fibre, and the number of scales per linear inch upon the surface. With regard to hair and fur, I have already shown that serrated fibres are not specially peculiar to sheep, but are much more widely diffused. Most of the higher members of the mammalia family possess a hairy covering of some sort, and in by far the larger number is found a tendency to produce an undergrowth of fine woolly fibre, especially in the winter time. The differences of human hair and hairs generally, from the higher to the lower forms of mammalia, consist only in variations of size and arrangement as regards the cells composing the different parts of the fibre, as well as in a greater or less development of the scales on the covering or external hair surface. Thus, under the microscope, the wool and hairs of various animals, as also even hairs from different parts of the same animal, show a great variety of structure, development, and appearance.  [Illustration: FIG. 5.]  [Illustration: FIG. 6.]  [Illustration: FIG. 7.]  [Illustration: FIG. 8.]  [Illustration: FIG. 9.]  [Illustration:      Finest merino wool fibre.     Typical wool fibre.     Fibre of wool from Chinese sheep.  FIG. 10.]  [Illustration: FIG. 11.]  [Illustration: FIG. 12.]  We have already observed that hair, if needed for felting, is all the better--provided, of course, no injury is done to the fibre itself--for some treatment, by which the scales otherwise lying flatter on the hair-shafts than in the case of the hairs of wool, are made to stand up somewhat, extending outwards their free edges. This brings me to the consideration of a practice pursued by furriers for this purpose, and known as the _sécretage_ or \"carrotting\" process; it consists in a treatment with a solution of mercuric nitrate in nitric acid, in order to improve the felting qualities of the fur. This acid mixture is brushed on to the fur, which is cut from the skin by a suitable sharp cutting or shearing machine. A Manchester furrier, who gave me specimens of some fur untreated by the process, and also some of the same fur that had been treated, informed me that others of his line of business use more mercury than he does, _i.e._ leave less free nitric acid in their mixture; but he prefers his own method, and thinks it answers best for the promotion of felting. The treated fur he gave me was turned yellow with the nitric acid, in parts brown, and here and there the hairs were slightly matted with the acid. In my opinion the fur must suffer from such unequal treatment with such strong acid, and in the final process of finishing I should not be surprised if difficulty were found in getting a high degree of lustre and finish upon hairs thus roughened or partially disintegrated. Figs. 11 and 12 respectively illustrate fur fibres from different parts of the same hare before and after the treatment. In examining one of these fibres from the side of a hare, you see what the cause of this roughness is, and what is also the cause of the difficulty in giving a polish or finish. The free edges are partially disintegrated, etched as it were, besides being caused to stand out. A weaker acid ought to be used, or more mercury and less acid. As we shall afterwards see, another dangerous agent, if not carefully used, is bichrome (bichromate of potassium), which is also liable to roughen and injure the fibre, and thus interfere with the final production of a good finish.     LECTURE II  TEXTILE FIBRES, PRINCIPALLY WOOL, FUR, AND HAIR--_Continued_   With regard to the preparation of fur by acid mixtures for felting, mentioned in the last lecture, I will tell you what I think I should recommend. In all wool and fur there is a certain amount of grease, and this may vary in different parts of the material. Where there is most, however, the acid, nitric acid, or nitric acid solution of nitrate of mercury, will wet, and so act on the fur, least. But the action ought to be uniform, and I feel sure it cannot be until the grease is removed. I should therefore first wash the felts on the fur side with a weak alkaline solution, one of carbonate of soda, free from any caustic, to remove all grease, then with water to remove alkali; and my belief is that a weaker and less acid solution of nitric acid and nitrate of mercury, and a smaller quantity of it, would then do the work required, and do it more uniformly.  A question frequently asked is: \"Why will dead wool not felt?\" Answer: If the animal become weak and diseased, the wool suffers degradation; also, with improvement in health follows _pari passu_, improvement in the wool structure, which means increase both in number and vigour of the scales on the wool fibres, increase of the serrated ends of these, and of their regularity. In weakness and disease the number of scales in a given hair-shaft diminishes, and these become finer and less pronounced. The fibres themselves also become attenuated. Hence when disease becomes death, we have considerably degraded fibres. This is seen clearly in the subjoined figures (see Fig. 13), which are of wool fibres from animals that have died of disease. The fibres are attenuated and irregular, the scale markings and edges have almost disappeared in some places, and are generally scanty and meagre in development. It is no wonder that such \"dead wool\" will be badly adapted for felting. \"Dead wool\" is nearly as bad as \"kempy\" wool, in which malformation of fibre has occurred. In such \"kemps,\" as Dr. Bowman has shown, scales have disappeared, and the fibre has become, in part or whole, a dense, non-cellular structure, resisting dye-penetration and felting (see Fig. 14).  [Illustration: FIG. 13.]  [Illustration: FIG. 14.]  One of the physical properties of wool is its hygroscopicity or power of absorbing moisture. As the very structure of wool and fur fibre would lead us to suppose, these substances are able to absorb a very considerable amount of water without appearing damp. If exposed freely to the air in warm and dry weather, wool retains from 8 to 10 per cent., and if in a damp place for some time, it may absorb as much as from 30 to 50 per cent. of water: Wool, fur, or hair that has been washed, absorbs the most moisture; indeed, the amount of water taken up varies inversely with the fatty or oily matter present. Hence the less fat the more moisture. In the washed wool, those fibres in which the cells are more loosely arranged have the greatest absorbing power for water. No doubt the moisture finds its way in between the cells of the wool fibre from which the oil or fat has been removed. But I need hardly remind you that if wool and fur are capable, according to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17742"],["title","Navajo weavers (#1)"],["body","trees, growing at a convenient distance from one another, are made to answer for the posts, _d_ is a horizontal pole, which I call the supplementary yarn-beam, attached to the upper brace, _b_, by means of a rope, _e e_, spirally applied. _f_ is the upper beam of the loom. As it is analogous to the yarn-beam of our looms, I will call it by this name, although once only have I seen the warp wound around it. It lies parallel to the pole _d_, about 2 or 3 inches below it, and is attached to the latter by a number of loops, _g g_. A spiral cord wound around the yarn-beam holds the upper border cord _h h_, which, in turn, secures the upper end of the warp _i i_. The lower beam of the loom is shown at _k_. I will call this the cloth-beam, although the finished web is never wound around it; it is tied firmly to the lower brace, _c_, of the frame, and to it is secured the lower border cord of the blanket. The original distance between the two beams is the length of the blanket. Lying between the threads of the warp is depicted a broad, thin, oaken stick, _l_, which I will call the batten. A set of healds attached to a heald-rod, _m_, are shown above the batten. These healds are made of cord or yarn; they include alternate threads of the warp, and serve when drawn forward to open the lower shed. The upper shed is kept patent by a stout rod, _n_ (having no healds attached), which I name the shed-rod. Their substitute for the reed of our looms is a wooden fork, which will be designated as the reed-fork (Fig. 44, _a_).  [Illustration: FIG. 42.--Ordinary Navajo blanket loom.]  For convenience of description, I am obliged to use the word \"shuttle,\" although, strictly speaking, the Navajo has no shuttle. If the figure to be woven is a long stripe, or one where the weft must be passed through 6 inches or more of the shed at one time, the yarn is wound on a slender twig or splinter, or shoved through on the end of such a piece of wood; but where the pattern is intricate, and the weft passes at each turn through only a few inches of the shed, the yarn is wound into small skeins or balls and shoved through with the finger.  ｧ IV. The warp is thus constructed: A frame of four sticks is made, not unlike the frame of the loom, but lying on or near the ground, instead of standing erect. The two sticks forming the sides of the frame are rough saplings or rails; the two forming the top and bottom are smooth rounded poles--often the poles which afterwards serve as the beams of the loom; these are placed parallel to one another, their distance apart depending on the length of the projected blanket.  On these poles the warp is laid in a continuous string. It is first firmly tied to one of the poles, which I will call No. 1 (Fig. 43); then it is passed over the other pole, No. 2, brought back under No. 2 and over No. 1, forward again under No. 1 and over No. 2, and so on to the end. Thus the first, third, fifth, &c., turns of the cord cross in the middle the second, fourth, sixth, &c., forming a series of elongated figures 8, as shown in the following diagram--  [Illustration: FIG. 43.--Diagram showing formation of warp.]  and making, in the very beginning of the process, the two sheds, which are kept distinct throughout the whole work. When sufficient string has been laid the end is tied to pole No. 2, and a rod is placed in each shed to keep it open, the rods being afterwards tied together at the ends to prevent them from falling out.  This done, the weaver takes three strings (which are afterwards twilled into one, as will appear) and ties them together at one end. She now sits outside one of the poles, looking towards the centre of the frame, and proceeds thus: (1) She secures the triple cord to the pole immediately to the left of the warp; (2) then she takes one of the threads (or strands as they now become) and passes it under the first turn of the warp; (3) next she takes a second strand, and twilling it once or oftener with the other strands, includes with it the second bend of the warp; (4) this done, she takes the third strand and, twilling it as before, passes it under the third bend of the warp, and thus she goes on until the entire warp in one place is secured between the strands of the cord; (5) then she pulls the string to its fullest extent, and in doing so separates the threads of the warp from one another; (6) a similar three stranded cord is applied to the other end of the warp, along the outside of the other pole.  At this stage of the work these stout cords lie along the outer surfaces of the poles, parallel with the axes of the latter, but when the warp is taken off the poles and applied to the beams of the loom by the spiral thread, as above described, and as depicted in Plate XXXVIII and Fig. 42, and all is ready for weaving, the cords appear on the inner sides of the beams, _i.e._, one (Pl. XXXVIII and Fig. 42, _h h_) at the lower side of the yarn-beam, the other at the upper side of the cloth-beam, and when the blanket is finished they form the stout end margins of the web. In the coarser grade of blankets the cords are removed and the ends of the warp tied in pairs and made to form a fringe. (See Figs. 54 and 55.)  When the warp is transferred to the loom the rod which was placed in the upper shed remains there, or another rod, straighter and smoother, is substituted for it; but with the lower shed, healds are applied to the anterior threads and the rod is withdrawn.  ｧ V. The mode of applying the healds is simple: (1) the weaver sits facing the loom in the position for weaving; (2) she lays at the right (her right) side of the loom a ball of string which she knows contains more than sufficient material to make the healds; (3) she takes the end of this string and passes it to the left through the shed, leaving the ball in its original position; (4) she ties a loop at the end of the string large enough to admit the heald-rod; (5) she holds horizontally in her left hand a straightish slender rod, which is to become the heald-rod--its right extremity touching the left edge of the warp--and passes the rod through the loop until the point of the stick is even with the third (second anterior from the left) thread of the warp; (6) she puts her finger through the space between the first and third threads and draws out a fold of the heald-string; (7) she twists this once around, so as to form a loop, and pushes the point of the heald-rod on to the right through this loop; (8) she puts her finger into the next space and forms another loop; (9) and so on she continues to advance her rod and form her loops from left to right until each of the anterior (alternate) warp-threads of the lower shed is included in a loop of the heald; (10) when the last loop is made she ties the string firmly to the rod near its right end.  When the weaving is nearly done and it becomes necessary to remove the healds, the rod is drawn out of the loops, a slight pull is made at the thread, the loops fall in an instant, and the straightened string is drawn out of the shed. Illustrations of the healds may be seen in Plates XXXV and XXXVIII and Figs. 42, 44, and 46, that in Fig. 46 being the most distinct.  ｧ VI. In making a blanket the operator sits on the ground with her legs folded under her. The warp hangs vertically before her, and (excepting in a case to be mentioned) she weaves from below upwards. As she never rises from this squatting posture when at work, it is evident that when she has woven the web to a certain height further work must become inconvenient or impossible unless by some arrangement the finished web is drawn downwards. Her cloth-beam does not revolve as in our looms, so she brings her work within easy reach by the following method: The spiral rope (Plate XXXVIII and Fig. 42) is loosened, the yarn-beam is lowered to the desired distance, a fold is made in the loosened web, and the upper edge of the fold is sewed down tightly to the cloth-beam. In all new blankets over two feet long the marks of this sewing are to be seen, and they often remain until the blanket is worn out. Plate XXXV, representing a blanket nearly finished, illustrates this procedure.  Except in belts, girths, and perhaps occasionally in very narrow blankets, the shuttle is never passed through the whole width of the warp at once, but only through a space which does not exceed the length of the batten; for it is by means of the batten, which is rarely more than 3 feet long, that the shed is opened.  [Illustration: PL. XXXV.--WEAVING OF DIAMOND-SHAPED DIAGONALS.]  Suppose the woman begins by weaving in the lower shed. She draws apportion of the healds towards her, and with them the anterior threads of the shed; by this motion she opens the shed about 1 inch, which is not sufficient for the easy passage of the woof. She inserts her batten edgewise into this opening and then turns it half around on its long axis, so that its broad surfaces lie horizontally; in this way the shed is opened to the extent of the width of the batten--about 3 inches; next the weft is passed through. In fig. 42 the batten is shown lying edgewise (its broad surfaces vertical), as it appears when just inserted into the shed, and the weft, which has been passed through only a portion of the shed, is seen hanging out with its end on the ground. In Plate XXXV the batten is shown in the second position described, with the shed open to the fullest extent necessary, and the weaver is represented in the act of passing the shuttle through. When the weft is in, it is shoved down into its proper position by means of the reed-fork, and then the batten, restored to its first position (edgewise), is brought down with firm blows on the weft. It is by the vigorous use of the batten that the Navajo serapes are rendered water-proof. In Plate XXXVIII the weaver is seen bringing down this instrument \"in the manner and for the purpose described,\" as the letters patent say.  When the lower shed has"]]]
