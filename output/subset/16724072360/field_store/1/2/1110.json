J.A. FULLER-MAITLAND  _June 1907_     THE OPERA     CHAPTER I  THE BEGINNINGS OF OPERA   PERI--MONTEVERDE--CAVALLI--CESTI--CAMBERT--LULLI--PURCELL-- KEISER--SCARLATTI--HANDEL   The early history of many forms of art is wrapped in obscurity. Even in music, the youngest of the arts, the precise origin of many modern developments is largely a matter of conjecture. The history of opera, fortunately for the historian, is an exception to the rule. All the circumstances which combine to produce the idea of opera are known to us, and every detail of its genesis is established beyond the possibility of doubt.  The invention of opera partook largely of the nature of an accident. Late in the sixteenth century a few Florentine amateurs, fired with the enthusiasm for Greek art which was at that time the ruling passion of every cultivated spirit in Italy, set themselves the task of reconstructing the conditions of the Athenian drama. The result of their labours, regarded as an attempted revival of the lost glories of Greek tragedy, was a complete failure; but, unknown to themselves, they produced the germ of that art-form which, as years passed on, was destined, in their own country at least, to reign alone in the affections of the people, and to take the place, so far as the altered conditions permitted, of the national drama which they had fondly hoped to recreate.  The foundations of the new art-form rested upon the theory that the drama of the Greeks was throughout declaimed to a musical accompaniment. The reformers, therefore, dismissed spoken dialogue from their drama, and employed in its place a species of free declamation or recitative, which they called _musica parlante_. The first work in which the new style of composition was used was the 'Dafne' of Jacopo Peri, which was privately performed in 1597. No trace of this work survives, nor of the musical dramas by Emilio del Cavaliere and Vincenzo Galilei to which the closing years of the sixteenth century gave birth. But it is best to regard these privately performed works merely as experiments, and to date the actual foundation of opera from the year 1600, when a public performance of Peri's 'Euridice' was given at Florence in honour of the marriage of Maria de' Medici and Henry IV. of France. A few years later a printed edition of this work was published at Venice, a copy of which is now in the library of the British Museum, and in recent times it has been reprinted, so that those who are curious in these matters can study this protoplasmic opera at their leisure. Expect for a few bars of insignificant chorus, the whole work consists of the accompanied recitative, which was the invention of these Florentine reformers. The voices are accompanied by a violin, _chitarone_ (a large guitar), _lira grande_, _liuto grosso_, and _gravicembalo_ or harpsichord, which filled in the harmonies indicated by the figured bass. The instrumental portions of the work are poor and thin, and the chief beauty lies in the vocal part, which is often really pathetic and expressive. Peri evidently tried to give musical form to the ordinary inflections of the human voice, how successfully may be seen in the Lament of Orpheus which Mr. Morton Latham has reprinted in his 'Renaissance of Music,' The original edition of 'Euridice' contains an interesting preface, in which the composer sets forth the theory upon which he worked, and the aims which he had in view. It is too long to be reprinted here, but should be read by all interested in the early history of opera.  With the production of 'Euridice' the history of opera may be said to begin; but if the new art-form had depended only upon the efforts of Peri and his friends, it must soon have languished and died. With all their enthusiasm, the little band of Florentines had too slight an acquaintance with the science of music to give proper effect to the ideas which they originated. Peri built the ship, but it was reserved for the genius of Claudio Monteverde to launch it upon a wider ocean than his predecessor could have dreamed of. Monteverde had been trained in the polyphonic school of Palestrina, but his genius had never acquiesced in the rules and restrictions in which the older masters delighted. He was a poor contrapuntist, and his madrigals are chiefly interesting as a proof of how ill the novel harmonies of which he was the discoverer accorded with the severe purity of the older school But in the new art he found the field his genius required. What had been weakness and license in the madrigal became strength and beauty in the opera. The new wine was put into new bottles, and both were preserved. Monteverde produced his 'Arianna' in 1607, and his 'Orfeo' in 1608, and with these two works started opera upon the path of development which was to culminate in the works of Wagner. 'Arianna,' which, according to Marco da Gagliano, himself a rival composer of high ability, 'visibly moved all the theatre to tears,' is lost to us save for a few quotations; but 'Orfeo' is in existence, and has recently been reprinted in Germany. A glance at the score shows what a gulf separates this work from Peri's treatment of the same story. Monteverde, with his orchestra of thirty-nine instruments--brass, wood, and strings complete--his rich and brilliant harmonies, sounding so strangely beautiful to ears accustomed only to the severity of the polyphonic school, and his delicious and affecting melodies, sometimes rising almost to the dignity of an aria, must have seemed something more than human to the eager Venetians as they listened for the first time to music as rich in colour as the gleaming marbles of the CÃ  d'Oro or the radiant canvases of Titian and Giorgione.  The success of Monteverde had its natural result. He soon had pupils and imitators by the score. The Venetians speedily discovered that they had an inherent taste for opera, and the musicians of the day delighted to cater for it. Monteverde's most famous pupil was Cavalli, to whom may with some certainty be attributed an innovation which was destined to affect the future of opera very deeply. In his time, to quote Mr. Latham's 'Renaissance of Music,' 'the _musica parlante_ of the earliest days of opera was broken up into recitative, which was less eloquent, and aria, which was more ornamental. The first appearance of this change is to be found in Cavalli's operas, in which certain rhythmical movements called \"arias\" which are quite distinct from the _musica parlante_, make their appearance. The music assigned by Monteverde to Orpheus when he is leading Eurydice back from the Shades is undoubtedly an air, but the situation is one to which an air is appropriate, and _musica parlante_ would be inappropriate. If the drama had been a play to be spoken and not sung, there would not have been any incongruity in allotting a song to Orpheus, to enable Eurydice to trace him through the dark abodes of Hades. But the arias of Cavalli are not confined to such special situations, and recur frequently,' Cavalli had the true Venetian love of colour. In his hands the orchestra began to assume a new importance. His attempts to give musical expression to the sights and sounds of nature--the murmur of the sea, the rippling of the brook and the tempestuous fury of the winds--mark an interesting step in the history of orchestral development. With Marcantonio Cesti appears another innovation of scarcely less importance to the history of opera than the invention of the aria itself--the _da capo_ or the repetition of the first part of the aria in its entirety after the conclusion of the second part. However much the _da capo_ may have contributed to the settlement of form in composition, it must be admitted that it struck at the root of all real dramatic effect, and in process of time degraded opera to the level of a concert. Cesti was a pupil of Carissimi, who is famous chiefly for his sacred works, and from him he learnt to prefer mere musical beauty to dramatic truth. Those of his operas which remain to us show a far greater command of orchestral and vocal resource than Monteverde or Cavalli could boast, but so far as real expression and sincerity are concerned, they are inferior to the less cultured efforts of the earlier musicians. It would be idle to attempt an enumeration of the Venetian composers of the seventeenth century and their works. Some idea of the musical activity which prevailed may be gathered from the fact that while the first public theatre was opened in 1637, before the close of the century there were no less than eleven theatres in the city devoted to the performance of opera alone.  Meanwhile the enthusiasm for the new art-form spread through the cities of Italy. According to an extant letter of Salvator Rosa's, opera was in full swing in Rome during the Carnival of 1652. The first opera of Provenzale, the founder of the Neapolitan school, was produced in 1658. Bologna, Milan, Parma, and other cities soon followed suit. France, too, was not behindhand, but there the development of the art soon deserved the name a new school of opera, distinct in many important particulars from its parent in Italy. The French nobles who saw the performance of Peri's 'Euridice' at the marriage of Henry IV. may have carried back tales of its splendour and beauty to their own country, but Paris was not as yet ripe for opera. Not until 1647 did the French Court make the acquaintance of the new art which was afterwards to win some of its most brilliant triumphs in their city. In that year a performance of Peri's 'Euridice' (which, in spite of newer developments, had not lost its popularity) was given in Paris under the patronage of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16250"],["title","Tristan and Isolda: Opera in Three Acts (#1)"],["body","now hear too whence it has grown.     How scoffingly     they sing about me! Quickly could I requite them!     What of the boat     so bare and frail, that floated by our shore?     What of the broken     stricken man, feebly extended there?     Isolda's art     he gladly owned;     with herbs, simples     and healing salves the wounds from which he suffered she nursed in skilful wise.     Though \"Tantris\" The name that he took unto him,     as \"Tristan\" anon Isolda knew him, when in the sick man's keen blade she perceived a notch had been made,     wherein did fit     a splinter broken in Morold's head, the mangled token sent home in hatred rare: this hand did find it there. I heard a voice from distance dim; with the sword in hand I came to him. Full well I willed to slay him, for Morold's death to pay him. But from his sick bed he looked up not at the sword, not at my arm-- his eyes on mine were fastened, and his feebleness softened my heart: the sword--dropped from my fingers. Though Morold's steel had maimed him to health again I reclaimed him! when he hath homeward wended my emotion then might be ended.  BRANGÃNA. O wondrous! Why could I not see this? The guest I sometime helped to nurse--?  ISOLDA. His praise briskly they sing now:-- \"Bravo, our brave Tristan!\"-- he was that distressful man. A thousand protestations of truth and love he prated. Hear how a knight fealty knows!-- When as Tantris unforbidden he'd left me, as Tristan boldly back he came, in stately ship from which in pride Ireland's heiress in marriage he asked for Mark, the Cornish monarch, his kinsman worn and old. In Morold's lifetime dared any have dreamed to offer us such an insult? For the tax-paying Cornish prince to presume to court Ireland's princess! Ah, woe is me! I it was who for myself did shape this shame! with death-dealing sword should I have stabbed him; weakly it escaped me:-- now serfdom I have shaped me. Curse him, the villain! Curse on his head! Vengeance! Death! Death for me too!  BRANGÃNA (_throwing herself upon_ ISOLDA _with impetuous tenderness_). Isolda! lady! loved one! fairest! sweet perfection! mistress rarest! Hear me! come now, sit thee here.--  (_Gradually draws_ ISOLDA _to the couch_.)  What a whim! what causeless railing! How came you so wrong-minded and by mere fancy blinded? Sir Tristan gives thee Cornwall's kingdom; then, were he erst thy debtor, how could he reward thee better? His noble uncle serves he so: think too what a gift on thee he'd bestow! With honor unequalled all he's heir to at thy feet he seeks to shower, to make thee a queenly dower.  (ISOLDA _turns away_.)  If wife he'd make thee unto King Mark why wert thou in this wise complaining? Is he not worth thy gaining? Of royal race and mild of mood, who passes King Mark in might and power? If a noble knight like Tristan serves him, who would not but feel elated, so fairly to be mated.  ISOLDA (_gazing vacantly before her_). Glorious knight! And I must near him loveless ever languish! How can I support such anguish?  BRANGÃNA. What's this, my lady? loveless thou?  (_Approaching coaxingly and kissing_ ISOLDA.)  Where lives there a man would not love thee? Who could see Isolda And not sink at once into bondage blest? And if e'en it could be any were cold, did any magic draw him from thee, I'd bring the false one back to bondage, And bind him in links of love.--  (_Secretly and confidentially, close to_ ISOLDA.)  Mindest thou not thy mother's arts? Think you that she who'd mastered those would have sent me o'er the sea, without assistance for thee?  ISOLDA (_darkly_). My mother's rede I mind aright, and highly her magic arts I hold:-- Vengeance they wreak for wrongs, rest give to wounded spirits.-- Yon casket hither bear.  BRANGÃNA. It holds a balm for thee.--  (_She brings forward a small golden coffer, opens it, and points to its contents_.)  Thy mother placed inside it her subtle magic potions. There's salve for sickness or for wounds, and antidotes for deadly drugs.--  (_She takes a bottle_.)  The helpfullest draught I hold in here.  ISOLDA. Not so, I know a better. I make a mark to know it again-- This draught 'tis I would drain.  (_Seizes flask and shows it_.)  BRANGÃNA (_recoiling in horror_). The draught of death!  (ISOLDA _has risen from the sofa and now hears with increasing dread the cries of the sailors_.)  VOICES OF THE CREW (_without_). \"Ho! heave ho! hey! Reduce the sail! The mainsail in! Ho! heave ho! hey!\"  ISOLDA. Our journey has been swift. Woe is me! Near to the land!   SCENE IV.  (KURVENAL _boisterously enters through the curtains_.)  KURVENAL. Up, up, ye ladies! Look alert! Straight bestir you! Loiter not,--here is the land!-- To dame Isolda says the servant of Tristan, our hero true:-- Behold our flag is flying! it waveth landwards aloft: in Mark's ancestral castle may our approach be seen. So, dame Isolda, he prays to hasten, for land straight to prepare her, that thither he may bear her.  ISOLDA (_who has at first cowered and shuddered on hearing the message, now speaks calmly and with dignity_). My greeting take unto your lord and tell him what I say now: Should he assist to land me and to King Mark would he hand me, unmeet and unseemly were his act, the while my pardon was not won for trespass black and base: So bid him seek my grace.  (KURVENAL _makes a gesture of defiance_.)  Now mark me well, This message take:-- Nought will I yet prepare me, that he to land may bear me; I will not by him be landed, nor unto King Mark be handed ere granting forgiveness and forgetfulness, which 'tis seemly he should seek:-- for all his trespass base I tender him my grace.  KURVENAL. Be assured, I'll bear your words: we'll see what he will say!  (_He retires quickly_.)   SCENE V.  ISOLDA (_hurries to_ BRANGÃNA _and embraces her vehemently_). Now farewell, BrangÃ¦na! Greet ev'ry one, Greet my father and mother!  BRANGÃNA. What now? what mean'st thou? Wouldst thou flee? And where must I then follow?  ISOLDA (_checking herself suddenly_). Here I remain: heard you not? Tristan will I await.-- I trust in thee to aid in this: prepare the true cup of peace: thou mindest how it is made.  BRANGÃNA. What meanest thou?  ISOLDA (_taking a bottle from the coffer_). This it is! From the flask go pour this philtre out; yon golden goblet 'twill fill.  BRANGÃNA (_filled with terror receiving the flask_). Trust I my wits?  ISOLDA. Wilt thou be true?  BRANGÃNA. The draught--for whom?  ISOLDA. Him who betrayed!  BRANGÃNA. Tristan?  ISOLDA. Truce he'll drink with me.  BRANGÃNA (_throwing herself at_ ISOLDA'S _feet_). O horror! Pity thy handmaid!  ISOLDA. Pity thou me, false-hearted maid! Mindest thou not my mother's arts? Think you that she who'd mastered those would have sent thee o'er the sea without assistance for me? A salve for sickness doth she offer and antidotes for deadly drugs: for deepest grief and woe supreme gave she the draught of death. Let Death now give her thanks!  BRANGÃNA (_scarcely able to control herself_). O deepest grief!  ISOLDA. Now, wilt thou obey?  BRANGÃNA. O woe supreme!  ISOLDA. Wilt thou be true?  BRANGÃNA. The draught?  KURVENAL (_entering_). Sir Tristan!  (BRANGÃNA _rises, terrified and confused_. ISOLDA _strives with immense effort to control herself_.)  ISOLDA (_to Kurvenal_). Sir Tristan may approach!   SCENE VI.  [KURVENAL _retires again_. BRANGÃNA, _almost beside herself, turns up the stage_. ISOLDA, _mustering all her powers of resolution, walks slowly and with dignity towards the sofa, by the head of which she supports herself, turning her eyes firmly towards the entrance_]  (TRISTAN _enters, and pauses respectfully at the entrance_.)  TRISTAN. Demand, lady, what you will.  ISOLDA. While knowing not what my demand is, wert thou afraid still to fulfil it, fleeing my presence thus?  TRISTAN. Honor Held me in awe.  ISOLDA. Scant honor hast thou shown unto me; for, unabashed, withheldest thou obedience unto my call.  TRISTAN. Obedience 'twas forbade me to come.  ISOLDA. But little I owe thy lord, methinks, if he allows ill manners unto his own promised bride.  TRISTAN. In our land it is the law that he who fetches home the bride should stay afar from her.  ISOLDA. On what account?  TRISTAN. 'Tis the custom.  ISOLDA. Being so careful, my lord Tristan, another custom can you not learn? Of enemies friends make: for evil acts amends make.  TRISTAN. Who is my foe?  ISOLDA. Find in thy fears! Blood-guilt gets between us.  TRISTAN. That was absolved.  ISOLDA. Not between us.  TRISTAN. In open field, 'fore all the folk our old feud was abandoned.  ISOLDA. 'Twas not there I held Tantris hid when Tristan was laid low, He stood there brawny, bright and brave; but in his truce I took no part: my tongue its silence had learnt. When in chambered stillness sick he lay with the sword I stood before him, stern; silent--my lips, motionless--my hand. But that which my hand and lips had once vowed, I swore in stealth to adhere to: lo! now my desire I'm near to.  TRISTAN. What hast thou sworn?  ISOLDA (_quickly_). Vengeance for Morold!  TRISTAN (_quietly_). Mindst thou that?  ISOLDA (_animated_). Dare you to flout me?-- Was he not my betrothed, that noble Irish knight? For his sword a blessing I sought; for me only he fought. When he was murdered no honor fell. In that heartfelt misery my vow was framed; if no man remained to right it, I, a maid, must needs requite it.-- Weak and maimed, when might was mine, why at thy death did I pause? Thou shalt know the secret cause.-- Thy hurts I tended that, when sickness ended, thou shouldst fall by some man, as Isolda's revenge should plan. But now attempt thy fate to foretell me? if their friendship all men do sell thee, what foe can seek to fell thee?  TRISTAN (_pale and gloomy, offers her his sword_). If thou so lovedst this lord, then lift once more my sword, nor from thy purpose refrain; let the weapon not fail again.  ISOLDA. Put up thy sword which once I swung, when vengeful rancor my"]]]
