And they sang “Who’s your lady friend?” and when they had sung that, I called out, “Boys, we will have one more. What shall it be?”  “One of yours, sir.”  I had not trusted them in vain.  I said, “Very well, you choose your hymn.”  “When I survey the wondrous Cross”—that was the song they chose.  And they sang it all the better because I had sung their songs with them. Before we had got to the end of the last verse some of those boys were in tears, and it wasn’t hard to pray. It isn’t far from rag-time to “When I survey the wondrous Cross.”  When they had finished the hymn I said, “Boys, I am going to tell you the story of my father’s conversion.” For I had to convince my padre friend that they were not sceptical. I took them to the gipsy tent and told them of my father and five motherless children, and of how Jesus came to that tent, saving the father and the five children and making preachers of them all.  I said, “Did my father make a mistake when he brought Christ to those five motherless children?” And the eight hundred boys shouted, “No, sir.”  “Did he do the right thing?”  “Yes, sir.”  “What ought you to do?”  “The same, sir.”  “Do you want Jesus in your lives?” and every man of the eight hundred jumped to his feet.  You say they are sceptical where Jesus is concerned. I’ll tell you when they are sceptical—when they see the caricature of Jesus in you and me.                  *       *       *       *       *  I was, as I have said, under shell fire for a month in one place—night and day for a month—and never allowed out without a gasbag round my neck. I slept in a cellar there at night when I did sleep—only 700 yards from the Germans—and, as I have said before, it _was_ cold.  When the thaw set in, I put a couple of bricks down and put a box-lid on top, so that I could stand in a dry place. We had two picks and two shovels in that cellar in case anything happened overnight. I have been up against it. Whenever I talked to the boys there they sat with their gas-bags round their necks, and one held mine while I talked. It was quite a common thing to have something fall quite close to us while we were singing.  Imagine singing “Cover my defenceless head,” just as a piece of the roof is falling in. Or—    In death’s dark vale I fear no ill   With Thee, dear Lord, beside me—  then another crash! That makes things real. Every word was accompanied by the roar of guns—the rattle of the machine gun and the crack of the rifle. We never knew what it was to be quiet.  A shell once came and burst just the other side of the wall against which I was standing and blew part of it over my head. I have suffered as your boys have, and I have preached the Gospel to your boys in the front line. I long for the privilege of doing it again.                  *       *       *       *       *  If I had my way I’d take all the best preachers in Britain and I’d put them down in France. And if the church and chapel goers grumbled, I’d say, “You’re overfed. You can do without a preacher for a little.” And if they were to ask, “How do you know?” I should reply, “Because it’s hard work to get you to one meal a week. You only come once on a Sunday and often not that. That’s how I know you are not enjoying your food.”  I love talking to the Scottish boys—the kilties. Oh! they are great boys—the kilties. When the French first saw them they didn’t know what they were, whether they were men or women.  “Don’t you know what they are?” said a bright-faced English boy. “They are what we call the Middlesex.”  You can’t beat a British boy, he’s on the spot all the time—“the Middlesex!” Some of you haven’t seen the joke yet.                  *       *       *       *       *  I once went to a hut just behind the line, within the sound of the guns. Buildings all round us had been blown to pieces. The leader of this hut was a clergyman of the Church of England, but he wasn’t an ecclesiastic there, he was a man amongst men, and we loved him.  “Gipsy Smith,” he said, “I don’t know what you will do; the boys in the billets this week are the Munsters—Irish Roman Catholics. You would have got on all right last week; we had the York and Lancasters.”  “Do you think they will come to the meetings?”  “I don’t know,” he replied; “they come for everything else! They come for their smokes, candles, soap, buttons—bachelor’s buttons—postcards, and everything else they want. But whether they will come for the religious part, I don’t know.”  “Well,” I said, “we can but try.”  It was about midday when we were talking, and the meeting was to be at 6.30.  “Have you got a boy who could write a bill for me?” I asked.  “Yes,” he said, “I’ve got a boy who could do that all right.”  “Print it on green paper,” said I.  Why not? They were the Munsters. Why shouldn’t we use our heads? People think mighty hard in business, why shouldn’t we think in the religious world?  “Just say this and nothing more,” I said.  “‘Gipsy Smith will give a talk in the Hut to-night at 6.30. Subject—Gipsy Life.’”  I knew that would fetch them.  At half-past six the hut was crowded with eight hundred Munsters. If you are an old angler, indeed if you know anything at all about angling, you know that you have got to consider two or three things if you are to stand any chance of a catch. You have got to study your tackle, you have got to study your bait, you have got to study the habits of your fish. When the time came to begin that meeting, one of the workers said,  “Shall I bring the box of hymn-books out?”  “No, no,” I replied; “that’s the wrong bait.”  Those Munster boys knew nothing about hymn-books. We preachers have got to come off our pedestals and not give our hearers what we want, but the thing that will catch them. If a pretty, catchy Sankey hymn will attract a crowd, why shouldn’t we use it instead of an anthem? If a brass band will catch them, why shouldn’t we play it instead of an organ?  “Keep back those hymn-books,” I said. “They know nothing about hymn-books.” I had a pretty good idea of what would have happened if those hymn-books had been produced at the start.  I got on that platform, and I looked at those eight hundred Munsters and said, “Boys, are we down-hearted?”  “_No_,” they shouted.  You can imagine what eight hundred Munsters shouting “No” sounds like. They were all attention instantly. I wonder what would happen if the Vicar went into church next Sunday morning and asked the question, “Are we down-hearted?” I knew it would cause a sensation, but I’d rather have a sensation than a stagnation.  Those boys sat up. I said, “We are going to talk about gipsy life.” I talked to them about the origin of my people. There’s not a man living in the world who knows the origin of my people. I can trace my people back to India, but they didn’t come from India. We are one of the oldest races in the world, so old that nobody knows how old. I talked to them about the origin of the gipsies, and I don’t know it, but I knew more about it than they did. I talked to them about our language, and I gave them specimens of it, and there I was on sure ground. It is a beautiful language, full of poetry and music. Then I talked about the way the gipsies get their living—and other people’s; and for thirty minutes those Munsters hardly knew if they were on the chairs or on the floor—and I purposely made them laugh. They had just come out of the hell of the trenches. They had that haunted, weary, hungry look, and if only I could make them laugh and forget the hell out of which they had just climbed it was religion, and I wasn’t wasting time.  When I had been talking for thirty minutes, I stopped, and said, “Boys, there’s a lot more to this story. Would you like some more?”  “Yes,” they shouted.  “Come back to-morrow,” I said.  I was fishing in unlikely waters, and if you leave off when fish are hungry they will come back for more. For six nights I told those boys gipsy stories. I took them out into the woods. We went out amongst the rabbits. I told the boys the rabbits got very fond of me—so fond that they used to go home with me! I took them through the clover-fields on a June day and made them smell the perfume. I took them among the buttercups. I told them it was the Finger of Love and the Smile of Infinite Wisdom that put the spots upon the pansy and the deep blue in the violet. And then we went out among the birds and we saw God taking songs from the lips of a seraph and wrapping them round with feathers.  And the boys saw Jesus in every buttercup and every primrose, and every little daisy, and in every dewdrop, and heard something of the song of the angels in the notes of the nightingale and the skylark. Oh! Jesus was there, and they felt Him, and they saw Him. I took them amongst the gipsy tents, amongst the woodlands and dells of the old camping-grounds. They walked with Him and they talked with Him. I didn’t use the usual Church language, but I used the language of God in Nature and the boys heard Him.  Towards the end of the week one of those Munster boys came and touched me and said, “Your Riverence! Your Riverence!” he says. “You’re a gentleman.”  I _knew_ I had got that boy.  Now, if you are an old angler you know what happens if you begin to tug at the line the first time you get a bite. When you hook a fish, if he happens to be a Munster, you have got to keep your head and play him, let him have the line, let him go, keep steady, no excitement, give him play. I gave him a bit of line, that young Munster. I thanked him for his compliment and then walked away—with my eyes over my shoulder, for if he hadn’t come after me I should have been after him.  Presently he pulled my tunic and said, “Won’t you give me a minute, sir?”  “What’s the trouble?” I said.  “Sir,” he said, with a little catch in his voice that I can hear now, “you’ve got something I haven’t.”  “How do you know?” I asked.  “It’s like the singing of a little song, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16495"],["title","Your Boys (#2)"],["body","it gets into my heart. I want it. Won’t you tell me how to get it? I want it.”  “Sonny,” I said, “it’s for you. You can have it at the same price I paid for it.”  “Begorra,” says he, “you will tell me to give up my religion, you will!”  I said, “If God has put anything in your life that helps you to be a better and a nobler and a braver man, He doesn’t want you to give it up.”  “He doesn’t?” he asked. “What am I to give up, then?”  And I replied, “Your sin.”  The boy said again, “You’re a gentleman.”  If I had said one word about his religion or his creed, my line would have snapped and I would have lost my fish.  That night, when all the boys had gone, we got into a corner and we knelt down, and when he went he said, “I’ve got it, sir. I’ve got the little song—_and it’s singing_.”                  *       *       *       *       *  At one of my meetings the boys were four thousand strong and the Commandant of the camp was to preside. As they say in the Army, he had got the wind up. He did not know me. When he saw the crowd there he began to wonder what was going to happen. He called one of the officers to him, and said,  “I don’t know what he’s going to do. I hope he’s not going to give us a revival meeting or something of that sort. I hope he knows that one-third of these fellows are Roman Catholics.”  Well, of course I knew, and I was laying my plans accordingly. What right have you or I when we have got a mixed crowd like that to try to cram our preconceived programme down everybody’s throat? The officer, who was one of my friends, said to the Colonel, “I don’t think you need trouble, sir. He’s all right, and knows his job.”  When we were ready, I went to the Colonel, and said, “We are quite ready to begin, sir.”  The Colonel rose and announced, “Officers, non-commissioned officers, and men, I now introduce to you Gipsy Smith, who will perform.”  Now, the first thing I wanted to do was to disarm all prejudice in the mind of both officers and men. So I said, “Are you ready, boys?”  “Yes, sir.”  “Well, we’ll have our opening hymn, ‘Keep the home fires burning.’”  And didn’t those boys sing that! Some of them were smoking, and I wasn’t going to tell them not to smoke. That would have put their backs up. They were British boys and they knew what to do when the right moment came. And so I said, “Boys, you sang that very well, but you were not _all_ singing. Now, if we have another, will you all sing?” And they answered, “Yes.” I knew if they sang they couldn’t smoke. So we had “Pack up your troubles,” and this time every smoke was out and every boy was singing. “We’ll have another,” said I, when they had finished; “we’ll have—    ‘Way down in Tennessee   Just try to think of me   Right on my mother’s knee.’”  I knew if I got them round their mothers’ knees I should be all right.  “Now, boys,” I said, “what am I to talk to you about?” I let them choose their subject very often.  “Tell us the story of the gipsy tent,” they called out.  And there I was at home, and it was all right, and for an hour I told them the story of how grace came to that gipsy tent—the old romance of love.  “Now, boys, I’m through,” I said when I had spoken for an hour—and they gave me an encore. When I had finished my encore, the dear old Colonel got up to thank the “performer”—and he couldn’t do it; there was a lump in his throat and big tears were rolling down his cheeks.  “Boys, I can’t say what I want to, but,” said he, “we have all got to be better men.”  The Gospel was preached in that hut in a different way from what we have it preached at home, but we got it in, and the thing is to get it in.                  *       *       *       *       *  I was talking behind the lines to some of your boys. Every boy in front of me was going up to the trenches that night. There were five or six hundred of them. They had got their equipment—they were going on parade as soon as they left me. It wasn’t easy to talk. All I said was accompanied by the roar of the guns and the crack of rifles and the rattle of the machine guns, and once in a while our faces were lit up by the flashes. It was a weird sight. I looked at those boys. I couldn’t preach to them in the ordinary way. I knew and they knew that for many it was the last service they would attend on earth. I said,  “Boys, you are going up to the trenches. Anything may happen there. I wish I could go with you. God knows I do. I would if they would let me, and if any of you fall I would like to hold your hand and say something to you for mother, for wife, and for lover, and for little child. I’d like to be a link between you and home just for _that_ moment—God’s messenger for you. They won’t let me go, but there is Somebody Who will go with you. You know Who that is.”  You should have heard the boys all over that hut whisper, “Yes, sir—Jesus.”  “Well,” I said, “I want every man that is anxious to take Jesus with him into the trench to stand.”  Instantly and quietly every man in that hut stood up. And we prayed as men can pray only under those conditions. We sang together, “For ever with the Lord.” I shall never sing that hymn again without a lump in my throat. My mind will always go back to those dear boys.  We shook hands and I watched them go, and then on my way to the little cottage where I was billeted I heard feet coming behind me, and presently felt a hand laid upon my shoulder. Two grand handsome fellows stood beside me. One of them said,  “We didn’t manage to get into the hut, but we stood at the window to your right. We heard all you said. We want you to pray for us. We are going into the trenches, too. We can’t go until it is settled.”  We prayed together, and then I shook hands with them and bade them good-bye. They did not come back. Some of their comrades came—those two, with others, were left behind. But they had settled it—_they had settled it_.                  *       *       *       *       *  Two or three days after that I was in a hospital when one was brought in who was at that service. I thought he was unconscious, and I said to the Sister beside me, “Sister, how battered and bruised his poor head is!”  He looked up and said, “Yes, it is battered and bruised; but it will be all right, Gipsy, when I get the crown!”  One night I had got about fifty boys round me in a dug-out, with the walls blown out and bits of the roof off. I had taken some hymn-sheets, for I love to hear them sing. I never choose a hymn for them—I always let them choose their own hymns. There is wisdom in that. If they have asked for something and don’t sing it, I can come down on them. Among the great hymns they choose are these:    “Jesu, Lover of my soul,”  and I have heard them sing,    “Cover my defenceless head,”  with the shells falling close to them. I have heard them sing,    “I fear no foe ...”  with every seat and every bit of building round us rocking with the concussion of things. And then they will choose:    “The King of Love my Shepherd is,”   “The Lord’s my Shepherd, I’ll not want,”   “Abide with me,”   “Rock of ages, cleft for me,”  and the one they love, I think, most of all is,    “When I survey the wondrous Cross.”  Those are the hymns they sing, the great hymns of the Church—the hymns that all Christian people sing, about which there is no quarrelling. It’s beautiful to hear the boys.  That night I said, “I have brought some hymn-sheets. I thought we might have some singing, but I’m afraid it’s too dark.”  Instantly one of the boys brought out of his tunic about two inches of candle and struck a match, and in three minutes we had about twenty pieces of candle burning. It was a weird scene.  After the hymns I began to talk, and the candles burnt lower, and some of them flickered out, and I could see a boy here and there twitch a bit of candle as it was going out.  I said, “Put the candles out, boys. I can talk in the dark.”  It was a wonderful service, and here and there you could hear the boys sighing and crying as they thought of home and father and mother. It isn’t difficult to talk to boys like that.                  *       *       *       *       *  There is no hymn of hate in your boys’ hearts. I have known them take a German prisoner even after he has played the cruel thing; but there! he looked hungry and wretched, and in a few minutes they have shared their rations and cigarettes with him. I call that a bit of religion breaking out in an unlikely place. The leaven’s in the lump, thank God!                  *       *       *       *       *  I was speaking at a convalescent camp. Every one of the boys had been badly mauled and mangled on the Somme. This particular day I had about seven or eight hundred listeners. It was evening, and when I had talked to the boys, I said,  “I wonder if any of you would like to meet me for a little prayer?”  And from all over the camp came the answer, “Yes, sir; yes, sir; yes, sir.”  There was a big room there—we called it a quiet room—and so I asked all the boys who would like to see me, just to leave their seats and go into this room. I went to them and said,  “You have elected to come here to pray, so we will just kneel down at once. I am not going to do anything more than guide you. I want you to tell God what you feel you need in your own language.”  The prayers of those boys would have made a book. There were no old-fashioned phrases. You know what I mean—people begin at a certain place and there is no stopping them till they get to another certain place. One of these boys began, “Please God, You know I’ve been a rotter.” That’s the way to pray. That boy was talking to God and the Lord was very glad to listen.                  *       *       *       *       *  I was talking to one boy—an American; he was a little premature, he was in the fight before his country.  “Sonny,” I said, “you’re an American?”  “Yes, sir. I was born in Michigan.”  “Well, what are you doing, fighting under the British flag?”  “I guess it’s my fight too, sir. "]]]
