A considerable number of girls and boys had now gathered round, for Sergeant Wilks and his show were old, established favourites at Sidmouth, and the news of his arrival had travelled quickly round the place.  Four years before, he had appeared there for the first time, and since then had come every few months. He travelled round the southwestern counties, Dorset and Wilts, Somerset, Devon, and Cornwall, and his cheery good temper made him a general favourite wherever he went.  He was somewhat of a martinet, and would have no crowding and pushing, and always made the boys stand aside till the girls had a good look; but he never hurried them, and allowed each an ample time to see the pictures, which were of a better class than those in most travelling peep shows. There was some murmuring, at first, because the show contained none of the popular murders and blood-curdling scenes to which the people were accustomed.  \"No,\" the sergeant had said firmly, when the omission was suggested to him; \"the young ones see quite enough scenes of drunkenness and fighting. When I was a child, I remember seeing in a peep show the picture of a woman lying with her head nearly cut off, and her husband with a bloody chopper standing beside her; and it spoiled my sleep for weeks. No, none of that sort of thing for Sergeant Wilks. He has fought for his country, and has seen bloodshed enough in his time, and the ground half covered with dead and dying men; but that was duty--this is pleasure. Sergeant Wilks will show the boys and girls, who pay him their pennies, views in all parts of the world, such as would cost them thousands of pounds if they travelled to see them, and all as natural as life. He will show them great battles by land and sea, where the soldiers and sailors shed their blood like water in the service of their country. But cruel murders and notorious crimes he will not show them.\"  It was not the boys and girls, only, who were the sergeant's patrons. Picture books were scarce in those days, and grown-up girls and young men were not ashamed to pay their pennies to peep into the sergeant's box.  There was scarcely a farm house throughout his beat where he was not known and welcomed. His care of the child, who, when he first came round, was but a year old, won the heart of the women; and a bowl of bread and milk for the little one, and a mug of beer and a hunch of bread and bacon for himself, were always at his service, before he opened his box and showed its wonders to the maids and children of the house.  Sidmouth was one of his regular halting places, and, indeed, he visited it more often than any other town on his beat. There was always a room ready for him there, in the house of a fisherman's widow, when he arrived on the Saturday, and he generally stopped till the Monday. Thus he had come to know the names of most of the boys of the place, as well as of many of the elders; for it was his custom, of a Saturday evening, after the little one was in bed, to go and smoke his pipe in the taproom of the \"Anchor,\" where he would sometimes relate tales of his adventures to the assembled fishermen. But, although chatty and cheery with his patrons, Sergeant Wilks was a reticent, rather than a talkative, man. At the \"Anchor\" he was, except when called upon for a story, a listener rather than a talker.  As to his history, or the county to which he belonged, he never alluded to it, although communicative enough as to his military adventures; and any questions which were asked him, he quietly put on one side. He had intimated, indeed, that the father and mother of his grandchild were both dead; but it was not known whether she was the child of his son or daughter; for under his cheerful talk there was something of military strictness and sternness, and he was not a man of whom idle questions would be asked.  \"Now, boys and girls,\" he said, \"step up; the show is ready. Those who have got a penny cannot spend it better. Those who haven't must try and get their father or mother to give them one, and see the show later on. Girls first. Boys should always give way to their sisters. The bravest men are always the most courteous and gentle with women.\"  Four girls, of various ages, paid their pennies and took their places at the glasses, and the sergeant then began to describe the pictures, his descriptions of the wonders within being so exciting, that several boys and girls stole off from the little crowd, and made their way to their homes to coax their parents out of the necessary coin.  James Walsham listened a while, and then walked away to the sea, for there would be several sets of girls before it came to the turn of the boys. He strolled along, and as he came within sight of the beach stopped for a moment suddenly, and then, with a shout, ran forward at the top of his speed.  The little girl, after playing some time with the seaweed, had climbed into a small boat which lay at the edge of the advancing tide, and, leaning over the stern, watched the little waves as they ran up one after another. A few minutes after she had got into it, the rising tide floated the boat, and it drifted out a few yards, as far as its headrope allowed it. Ignorant of what had happened, the child was kneeling up at the stern, leaning over, and dabbling her hands in the water.  No one had noticed her. The boys had all deserted the beach. None of the fishermen were near the spot.  Just before James Walsham came within sight of the sea, the child had overbalanced itself. His eye fell on the water just as two arms and a frightened little face appeared above it. There was a little splash, and a struggle, and the sea was bare again.  At the top of his speed James dashed across the road, sprang down the beach, and, rushing a few yards into the water, dived down. He knew which way the tide was making, and allowed for the set. A few vigorous strokes, and he reached something white on the surface. It was the sunbonnet which had, in the child's struggles, become unfastened. He dived at once, and almost immediately saw a confused mass before him. Another stroke, and he seized the child's clothes, and, grasping her firmly, rose to the surface and swam towards shore.  Although the accident had not been perceived, his shout and sudden rush into the water had called the attention of some of the men, and two or three of them ran into the water, waist deep, to help him out with his little burden.  \"Well done, Master Walsham! The child would have been drowned if you had not seed it. None of us noticed her fall over. She was playing on the beach last time I seed her.\"  \"Is she dead?\" James asked, breathless from his exertions.  \"Not she,\" the fisherman said. \"She could not have been under water a minute. Take her into my cottage, it's one of the nighest. My wife will put her between the blankets, and will soon bring her round.\"  The fisherman's wife met them at the door, and, taking the child from the lad, carried it in, and soon had her wrapped up in blankets. But before this was done she had opened her eyes, for she had scarcely lost consciousness when James had seized her.  The lad stood outside the door, waiting for the news, when the sergeant hurried up, one of the fishermen having gone to tell him what had happened, as soon as the child had been carried into the cottage--assuring him, as he did so, that the little one would speedily come round.  Just as he came up the door of the cottage opened, and one of the women, who had run in to assist the fisherman's wife, put her head out.  \"She has opened her eyes,\" she said. \"The little dear will soon be all right.\"  \"Thank God for His mercies!\" the sergeant said, taking off his hat. \"What should I have done if I had lost her?  \"And I have to thank you, next to God,\" he said, seizing the boy's hand. \"May God bless you, young gentleman! and reward you for having saved my darling. They tell me she must have been drowned, but for you, for no one knew she had fallen in. Had it not been for you, I should come round to look for her, and she would have been gone--gone forever!\" and the showman dashed the tears from his eyes with the back of his hand.  \"I was only just in time,\" the lad said. \"I did not see her fall out of the boat. She was only a few yards away from it when she came up--just as my eyes fell on the spot. I am very glad to have saved her for you; but, of course, it was nothing of a swim. She could not have been many yards out of my depth. Now I will run home and change my things.\"  James Walsham was too much accustomed to be wet through, to care anything about his dripping clothes, but they served him as an excuse to get away, for he felt awkward and embarrassed at the gratitude of the old soldier. He pushed his way through the little crowd, which had now gathered round, and started at a run; for the news had brought almost all those gathered round the peep show to the shore, the excitement of somebody being drowned being superior even to that of the peep show, to the great majority; though a few, who had no hope of obtaining the necessary pennies, had lingered behind, and seized the opportunity for a gratuitous look through the glasses.  James ran upstairs and changed his clothes without seeing his mother, and then, taking down one of his lesson books, set to work, shrinking from the idea of going out again, and being made a hero of.  Half an hour later there was a knock at the front door, and a few minutes after his mother called him down. He ran down to the parlour, and there found the showman.  \"Oh, I say,\" the boy broke out, \"don't say anything more about it! I do hate being thanked, and there was nothing in swimming ten yards in a calm sea. Please don't say anything more about it. I would rather you hit me, ever so much.\"  The sergeant smiled gravely, and Mrs. Walsham exclaimed:  \"Why didn't you come in and tell me about it, Jim? I could not make out at first what Mr.--Mr.--\"  \"Sergeant "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17767"],["title","Pee-wee Harris Adrift (#1)"],["body","I'm not hungry,\" Pee-wee said.  He had been so touched by Warde's thoughtless remark that he held himself aloof from Roy's hospitality. \"I only came up to tell you that the thunderstorm up the river did a lot of damage; a house was struck by lightning in North Bridgeboro and a lot of trees were blown down.\"  This was not what he had come up for, though indeed the news was true, but his pride was touched by that remark of Warde's and he would not now admit that he had tramped up there just to visit them.  \"Gee whiz, do you think I don't know that eight's a company, nine's a crowd with patrols?\" he said.  \"Do you think I don't know that? Anyway, if I wanted to go and hang out with any patrol I'd go with the Ravens, wouldn't I?  I only came up to tell you that, because I thought you'd like to know.  Do you think I'm trying to find out your secrets? Gee whiz!\"  \"Come ahead in, Kid,\" said Roy; \"Warde didn't mean that.\"  \"I will not.\"  \"What's the matter with you anyway?\" Will Dawson asked.  \"I'm not in your patrol,\" Pee-wee said.  \"What's the big idea?\" Westy Martin asked.  \"You weren't in it when you went on the bee-line hike with us either, were you?\"  \"That's different,\" Pee-wee said.  \"Anyway I was a scout then, because I was in the Ravens and anyway I've got to go to the store.\"  Before they realized it he was gone.  \"What the dickens did you want to say that for?\" Roy asked Warde.  \"Oh, it just jumped out of my mouth,\" Warde said; \"I didn't think he'd be so touchy.  Wait, I'll call him back.\"  But the sturdy little figure trudging down the hill paid no attention to Warde's call.  And the Silver Foxes, friendly and sympathetic as they were, were too preoccupied to think much about this trifling affair.  Perhaps they had just a little disinclination to having visitors, even the little mascot, participating in their private councils just then.  The point of the whole matter was that Pee-wee had been unintentionally eliminated; it was a sort of automatic process attributable to the springtime.  And he found himself alone.  He was not out of the troop, but he was not in any of the patrols, and in spite of all his spectacular missionary work he had not been able to form a patrol.  Pee-wee's pride was as great as his voice and his appetite, and he would not sponge on the patrols which had a full membership and were busy with their own concerns.  The rock on which he had stood all winter had split in three and there was no place for him on any of the pieces.  On Saturday morning the Silver Foxes went into the city to buy some camping things and to see a movie show in the afternoon.  The Ravens went off for a hike.  A Saturday spent alone was more than the soul of Pee-wee could endure, so he conquered his foolish pride and went up to Connie Bennett's house to find out what the Elks were going to do.  He would not join in with the Elks, he told himself, but he would pal with any single Elk, or even with two or three.  That would be all right as long as he did not foist himself upon a whole patrol.  \"Eight's a company, nine's a crowd, gee whiz, I have to admit that,\" he said to himself.  \"It's all right for me to go with one feller even if he's a scout but a patrol's different.\"  It was a wistful and rather pathetic little figure that Mrs. Bennett discovered upon the porch.  \"Connie?  Oh gracious, he's been gone an hour, dear,\" she said.  \"They all went away with Mr. Collins in his auto.  I told him he _must_ be back for supper.  How is it you're not with them, Walter?\"  \"I--I ain't in that patrol,\" said Pee-wee; \"it goes by patrols.  Anyway I'm sorry I troubled you.\"  He turned and went down the steps and picking up a stick drew it across the slats of a fence as he went up the street.  The outlandish noise seemed to act as a balm to his disappointment and to keep him company.     CHAPTER III  CASTLES IN THE AIR  The lonesomeness of Robinson Crusoe on his desert island was nothing compared to the lonesomeness of Pee-wee on that Saturday morning.  He might have attached himself to any of the three patrols and had a day's pleasure, but his pride had stood in the way.  He had always been something of a free lance in the troop and been regarded as a troop institution.  But there had always been his official place among the Ravens waiting for him whenever it suited his wanton fancy to return like a prodigal to the fold.  Now, in the pleasant springtime with the troop divided for the summer rivalries, he found himself quite isolated.  No one was to blame for this; a scout must be in one patrol or another, and if all patrols are full then he must make himself the nucleus of a new one.  That is what Mr. Ellsworth had told Pee-wee.  \"Gee whiz, nucleuses aren't so easy to be, that's one thing,\" Pee-wee muttered to himself as he bent his aimless way in the direction of Barrel Alley.  \"Maybe he thinks it's easy to be a nucleus.  Nucleuses are hard to be, I'll tell the world.  Anyway I can be a pioneer scout, that's one thing.  You don't have to be a nucleus or anything to be one of those.  They don't have to bother with patrols, they don't, they're lucky.\"  He ambled along kicking a stone before him in a disconsolate, disgruntled way.  He followed it wherever it went, ever and again kicking it back onto the sidewalk; the simple pastime seemed to afford him infinite relief.  And meanwhile, glowing visions arose in his mind, such visions as no one but a poet or a lonely boy on a Saturday morning in the springtime could possibly have.  No one had injured him in the least, he was liked by all, he was simply the unhappy victim of circumstances.  But in a mood of heroic retaliation against the troop he pictured himself as a pioneer scout residing aloof in a grim tower, surrounded by wireless apparatus and covered with merit badges.  Scouts from all over the world would make pilgrimages to his obscure retreat for a timid glimpse of the mysterious hero.  The glowing vision was somewhat marred by his conception of himself eating a huge sandwich as he looked down from his parapet upon the worshipping throng below.  Roy Blakeley would be down there among the others, his jollying propensity subdued by a feeling of awe as he gazed at the great scout hermit, the famous pioneer scout who sent messages to lesser scouts the world over.  They would whisper, \"he looks just like his pictures in _Boys' Life_,\" and he would smile down on them and . . .  _Plunk_!  The pioneer scout had collided with a man on the sidewalk and he returned to Bridgeboro with a suddenness that surprised even himself.  \"Excuse me,\" he said.  \"Certainly,\" said the man.  Pee-wee recovered his rock and began kicking it along the sidewalk again.  \"I'll show them,\" he said moodily.  He was about to ascend his scout throne again and engage in the gracious pastime of receiving delegations of common, ordinary scouts in his dim, wooded domain when he found himself at the edge of a region which was not in the least like the romantic wilderness of his vision. This was Barrel Alley, the habitat of Jimmy Mattenburg and Sweet Caporal and the McNulty twins.  Barrel Alley was the slum neighborhood of Bridgeboro and it was not very large.  But it was large  enough.  Pee-wee  explored the crooked, muddy, sordid street, gazing wistfully here and there for possible recruits.  But no human material was to be seen.  The older boys were playing craps in Dennahan's lot and the smaller boys were watching them.  One lonely sentinel was perched on the fence scanning the horizon for cops.  For this he received the regular union pay of a stale apple-core.  He was an unkempt urchin with an aggressive and challenging countenance, but he had solved several problems in economy.  One of these was the entire elimination of stockings and garters.  This was accomplished by the use of a pair of trousers with legs of such ample diameter and of such length as to render stockings altogether superfluous.  This released both garters for more important duties, they being tied end to end, thus constituting a sort of single strand suspender which at its junction with his trousers in front was securely held by a large nail.  His hair presented an appearance not unlike the negligent architecture of an eagle's nest, which is of the bungalow type in its loose irregularity.  He had not the slightest reason for supposing that Pee-wee was equipped with commissary stores, but on general principles he said,  \"Give us a hunk of candy, will yer?\"  As luck would have it, this random shot, fired at every strange boy from the upper world, hit the mark, to his unspeakable astonishment. Pulling out of his pocket a licorice jaw-breaker of vast dimensions, Pee-wee sent it shooting in a bee-line at the face of the stranger.  Never before in all his checkered history had Keekie Joe ever received any edible of any character whatever in response to his menacing demands.  He had always assumed that boys who were well dressed had fruit or candy in their pockets.  He had sometimes required them to verify their denials by an exhibition of the interior of these receptacles.  His invariable demand had become a habit with him. Therefore the little sugared black brick which now hit him in the eye came as an unprecedented surprise.  For a moment he did not know whether to construe it as a propitiatory gift or a warlike missile.  \"What's the matter with you, can't you catch?\" Pee-wee demanded.     CHAPTER IV  KEEKIE JOE  It required but a few seconds for Keekie Joe to decide to run true to form.  The situation was an unusual one, the missile was a delicious morsel, and was nothing more nor less than what he had demanded.  But still it had been thrown at him and Keekie Joe elected to consider it as a shot fired by the enemy.  \"Whatcher chuckin' things at me fer?\" he demanded, descending from the fence and approaching Pee-wee with a terrible look of menace.  He had been careful, however, to pick the jawbreaker up and put it in his mouth.  \"Didn't you"]]]
