Then came the baking, which for two days filled the house with spicy, plum-puddingy odors; then the great feat of icing the big square loaves; and then the cutting up, in which all took part. There was much careful measurement that the slices might be an exact fit; and the kitchen rang with bright laughter and chat as Katy and Clover wielded the sharp bread-knives, and the others fitted the portions into their boxes, and tied the ribbons in crisp little bows. Many delicious crumbs and odd corners and fragments fell to the share of the younger workers; and altogether the occasion struck Amy as so enjoyable that she announced--with her mouth full--that she had changed her mind, and that Mabel might get married as often as she pleased, if she would have cake like _that_ every time,--a liberality of permission which Mabel listened to with her invariable waxen smile.  When all was over, and the last ribbons tied, the hundreds of little boxes were stacked in careful piles on a shelf of the inner closet of the doctor's office to wait till they were wanted,--an arrangement which naughty Clover pronounced eminently suitable, since there should always be a doctor close at hand where there was so much wedding-cake. But before all this was accomplished, came what Katy, in imitation of one of Miss Edgeworth's heroines, called \"The Day of Happy Letters.\"     CHAPTER II.  THE DAY OF HAPPY LETTERS.   The arrival of the morning boat with letters and newspapers from the East was the great event of the day in Burnet. It was due at eleven o'clock; and everybody, consciously or unconsciously, was on the lookout for it. The gentlemen were at the office bright and early, and stood chatting with each other, and fingering the keys of their little drawers till the rattle of the shutter announced that the mail was distributed. Their wives and daughters at home, meanwhile, were equally in a state of expectation, and whatever they might be doing kept ears and eyes on the alert for the step on the gravel and the click of the latch which betokened the arrival of the family news-bringer.  Doctors cannot command their time like other people, and Dr. Carr was often detained by his patients, and made late for the mail, so it was all the pleasanter a surprise when on the great day of the cake-baking he came in earlier than usual, with his hands quite full of letters and parcels. All the girls made a rush for him at once; but he fended them off with an elbow, while with teasing slowness he read the addresses on the envelopes.  \"Miss Carr--Miss Carr--Miss Katherine Carr--Miss Carr again; four for you, Katy. Dr. P. Carr,--a bill and a newspaper, I perceive; all that an old country doctor with a daughter about to be married ought to expect, I suppose. Miss Clover E. Carr,--one for the 'Confidante in white linen.' Here, take it, Clovy. Miss Carr again. Katy, you have the lion's share. Miss Joanna Carr,--in the unmistakable handwriting of Miss Inches. Miss Katherine Carr, care Dr. Carr. That looks like a wedding present, Katy. Miss Elsie Carr; Cecy's hand, I should say. Miss Carr once more,--from the conquering hero, judging from the post-mark. Dr. Carr,--another newspaper, and--hollo!--one more for Miss Carr. Well, children, I hope for once you are satisfied with the amount of your correspondence. My arm fairly aches with the weight of it. I hope the letters are not so heavy inside as out.\"  \"I am quite satisfied, Papa, thank you,\" said Katy, looking up with a happy smile from Ned's letter, which she had torn open first of all. \"Are you going, dear?\" She laid her packages down to help him on with his coat. Katy never forgot her father.  \"Yes, I am going. Time and rheumatism wait for no man. You can tell me your news when I come back.\"  It is not fair to peep into love letters, so I will only say of Ned's that it was very long, very entertaining,--Katy thought,--and contained the pleasant information that the \"Natchitoches\" was to sail four days after it was posted, and would reach New York a week sooner than any one had dared to hope. The letter contained several other things as well, which showed Katy how continually she had been in his thoughts,--a painting on rice paper, a dried flower or two, a couple of little pen-and-ink sketches of the harbor of Santa Lucia and the shipping, and a small cravat of an odd convent lace folded very flat and smooth. Altogether it was a delightful letter, and Katy read it, as it were, in leaps, her eyes catching at the salient points, and leaving the details to be dwelt upon when she should be alone.  This done, she thrust the letter into her pocket, and proceeded to examine the others. The first was in Cousin Helen's clear, beautiful handwriting:--      DEAR KATY,--If any one had told us ten years ago that in this     particular year of grace you would be getting ready to be     married, and I preparing to come to your wedding, I think we     should have listened with some incredulity, as to an agreeable     fairy tale which could not possibly come true. We didn't look     much like it, did we,--you in your big chair and I on my sofa?     Yet here we are! When your letter first reached me it seemed a     sort of impossible thing that I should accept your invitation;     but the more I thought about it the more I felt as if I must,     and now things seem to be working round to that end quite     marvellously. I have had a good winter, but the doctor wishes me     to try the experiment of the water cure again which benefited me     so much the summer of your accident. This brings me in your     direction; and I don't see why I might not come a little earlier     than I otherwise should, and have the great pleasure of seeing     you married, and making acquaintance with Lieutenant     Worthington. That is, if you are perfectly sure that to have at     so busy a time a guest who, like the Queen of Spain, has the     disadvantage of being without legs, will not be more care than     enjoyment. Think seriously over this point, and don't send for     me unless you are certain. Meanwhile, I am making ready. Alex     and Emma and little Helen--who is a pretty big Helen now--are to     be my escorts as far as Buffalo on their way to Niagara. After     that is all plain sailing, and Jane Carter and I can manage very     well for ourselves. It seems like a dream to think that I may     see you all so soon; but it is such a pleasant one that I would     not wake up on any account.      I have a little gift which I shall bring you myself, my Katy;     but I have a fancy also that you shall wear some trifling thing     on your wedding-day which comes from me, so for fear of being     forestalled I will say now, please don't buy any stockings for     the occasion, but wear the pair which go with this, for the sake     of your loving       COUSIN HELEN.  \"These must be they,\" cried Elsie, pouncing on one of the little packages. \"May I cut the string, Katy?\"  Permission was granted; and Elsie cut the string. It was indeed a pair of beautiful white silk stockings embroidered in an open pattern, and far finer than anything which Katy would have thought of choosing for herself.  \"Don't they look exactly like Cousin Helen?\" she said, fondling them. \"Her things always are choicer and prettier than anybody's else, somehow. I can't think how she does it, when she never by any chance goes into a shop. Who can this be from, I wonder?\"  \"This\" was the second little package. It proved to contain a small volume bound in white and gold, entitled, \"Advice to Brides.\" On the fly-leaf appeared this inscription:--      To Katherine Carr, on the occasion of her approaching bridal,     from her affectionate teacher,                                       MARIANNE NIPSON.      1 Timothy, ii. 11.  Clover at once ran to fetch her Testament that she might verify the quotation, and announced with a shriek of laughter that it was: \"Let the women learn in silence with all subjection;\" while Katy, much diverted, read extracts casually selected from the work, such as: \"A wife should receive her husband's decree without cavil or question, remembering that the husband is the head of the wife, and that in all matters of dispute his opinion naturally and scripturally outweighs her own.\"  Or: \"'A soft answer turneth away wrath.' If your husband comes home fretted and impatient, do not answer him sharply, but soothe him with gentle words and caresses. Strict attention to the minor details of domestic management will often avail to secure peace.\"  And again: \"Keep in mind the epitaph raised in honor of an exemplary wife of the last century,--'She never banged the door.' Qualify yourself for a similar testimonial.\"  \"Tanta never does bang doors,\" remarked Amy, who had come in as this last \"elegant extract\" was being read.  \"No, that's true; she doesn't,\" said Clover. \"Her prevailing vice is to leave them open. I like that truth about a good dinner 'availing' to secure peace, and the advice to 'caress' your bear when he is at his crossest. Ned never does issue 'decrees,' though, I fancy; and on the whole, Katy, I don't believe Mrs. Nipson's present is going to be any particular comfort in your future trials. Do read something else to take the taste out of our mouths. We will listen in 'all subjection.'\"  Katy was already deep in a long epistle from Rose.  \"This is too delicious,\" she said; \"do listen.\" And she began again at the beginning:--      MY SWEETEST OF ALL OLD SWEETS,--Come to your wedding! Of course     I shall. It would never seem to me to have any legal sanction     whatever if I were not there to add my blessing. Only let me     know which day \"early in June\" it is to be, that I may make     ready.

And finally, _how most effectively to present_ the subject matter selected to make it serve its purpose in stimulating and guiding the spiritual growth and development of children.  The volume is intended as a textbook for teacher-training classes, students of religious education, and for private study by church-school teachers. It is also hoped that ministers may find some help in its pages toward meeting their educational problems.  Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois.     CHAPTER I  THE TEACHER HIMSELF   It is easy enough to secure buildings and classrooms for our schools. The expenditure of so many dollars will bring us the equipment we require. Books and materials may be had almost for the asking. The great problem is to secure _teachers_--real teachers, teachers of power and devotion who are able to leave their impress on young lives. Without such teachers all the rest is but as sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal. And to be a real teacher is a very high achievement.  Bishop Vincent was giving a lecture on \"That Boy.\" He himself was \"that boy,\" and in the course of describing his school days he fell into meditation as follows: \"That old school master of mine!--He is dead now--_and I have forgiven him!_--And I am afraid that was the chronology of the matter; for I never was able to forgive him while he lived.\" I, as one of the listeners, smiled at the bitter wit of the speaker, but was oppressed.  This somber view of the impression sometimes left by teachers on their pupils received an antidote the following day, however, when a venerable old man approached my desk bearing in his hands an ancient and dog-eared copy of a text in grammar. He opened the book and proudly showed me written across the fly leaf \"Grover Cleveland, President.\" Then he told me this story:  \"I have been a teacher. In one of my first schools I had Grover Cleveland as a pupil. He came without a textbook in grammar, and I loaned him mine. Years passed, and Grover Cleveland was President of the United States. One day I was one of many hundreds passing in line at a public reception to grasp the President's hand. I carried this book with me, and when it came my turn to meet the President, I presented the volume and said, 'Mr. President, do you recognize this book, and do you remember me?' In an instant the light of recognition had flashed in Mr. Cleveland's eyes. Calling me by name, he grasped my hand and held it while the crowd waited and while he recalled old times and thanked me for what I had meant to him when I was his teacher. Then he took the old book and autographed it for me.\"  Three types of teachers.--Two types of teachers are remembered: one to be forgiven after years have softened the antagonisms and resentments; the other to be thought of with honor and gratitude as long as memory lasts. Between these two is a third and a larger group: those who are _forgotten_, because they failed to stamp a lasting impression on their pupils. This group represents the _mediocrity_ of the profession, not bad enough to be actively forgiven, not good enough to claim a place in gratitude and remembrance.  To which type would we belong? To which type _can_ we belong? Can we choose? What are the factors that go to determine the place we shall occupy in the scale of teachers?   THE PERSONAL FACTOR  When we revert to our own pupil days we find that the impressions which cling to our memories are not chiefly impressions of facts taught and of lessons learned, but of the _personality_ of the teacher. We may have forgotten many of the truths presented and most of the conclusions drawn, but the warmth and glow of the human touch still remains.  To be a teacher of religion requires a particularly exalted personality. The teacher and the truth taught should always leave the impression of being of the same pattern. \"For their sakes I sanctify myself,\" said the Great Teacher; shall the teachers of his Word dare do less!  The teacher as an interpreter of truth.--This is not to say that the subject matter taught is unimportant, nor that the lessons presented are immaterial. It is only to say that life responds first of all to _life_. Truth never comes to the child disembodied and detached, but always with the slant and quality of the teacher's interpretation of it. It is as if the teacher's mind and spirit were the stained glass through which the sunlight must fall; all that passes through the medium of a living personality takes its tone and quality from this contact. The pupils may or may not grasp the lessons of their books, but their teachers are living epistles, known and read by them all.  For it is the concrete that grips and molds. Our greatest interest and best attention center in persons. The world is neither formed nor reformed by abstract truths nor by general theories. Whatever ideals we would impress upon others we must first have realized in ourselves. What we _are_ often drowns out what we say. Words and maxims may be misunderstood; character seldom is. Precepts may fail to impress; personality never does. God tried through the ages to reveal his purposes to man by means of the law and the prophets, but man refused to heed or understand. It was only when God had made his thought and plan for man concrete in the person of Jesus of Nazareth that man began to understand.  The first and most difficult requirement of the teacher, therefore, is--_himself_, his personality. He must combine in himself the qualities of life and character he seeks to develop in his pupils. He must look to his personality as the source of his influence and the measure of his power. He must be the living embodiment of what he would lead his pupils to become. He must live the religion he would teach them. He must possess the vital religious experience he would have them attain.  The building of personality.--Personality is not born, it is made. A strong, inspiring personality is not a gift of the gods, nor is a weak and ineffective personality a visitation of Providence. Things do not _happen_ in the realm of the spiritual any more than in the realm of nature. Everything is _caused_. Personality grows. It takes its form in the thick of the day's work and its play. It is shaped in the crush and stress of life's problems and its duties. It gains its quality from the character of the thoughts and acts that make up the common round of experience. It bears the marks of whatever spiritual fellowship and communion we keep with the Divine.  Professor Dewey tells us that character is largely dependent on the mode of assembling its parts. A teacher may have a splendid native inheritance, a fine education, and may move in the best social circles, and yet not come to his best in personality. It requires some high and exalted task in order to assemble the powers and organize them to their full efficiency. The urge of a great work is needed to make potential ability actual. Paul did not become the giant of his latter years until he took upon himself the great task of carrying the gospel to the Gentiles.  Our own responsibility.--It follows then that the building of our personalities is largely in our own hands. True, the influence of heredity is not to be overlooked. It is easier for some to develop attractive, compelling qualities than for others. The raw material of our nature comes with us; is what heredity decrees. But the finished product bears the stamp of our training and development. Fate or destiny never takes the reins from our hands. We are free to shape ourselves largely as we will.  Our inner life will daily grow by what it feeds upon. This is the great secret of personality-building. What to-day we build into thought and action to-morrow becomes character and personality. Let us cultivate our interests, think high thoughts, and give ourselves to worthy deeds, and these have soon become a life habit. Let our hearts go out in helpfulness to those about us, and sympathy for human kind becomes a compelling motive in our lives before we are aware. Let us consciously listen to the still small voice speaking to the soul, and we will find our souls expanding to meet the Infinite.  The secret.--He who would develop his personality into the full measure of its strength and power must, then, set his goal at _living constantly in the presence of the_ BEST. This will include the best in thought and memory and anticipation. It will permit none but cheerful moods, nor allow us to dwell with bitterness upon petty wrongs and grievances. It will control the tongue, and check the unkind word or needless criticism. It will cause us to seek for the strong and beautiful qualities in our friends and associates, and not allow us to point out their faults nor magnify their failings. It will cure us of small jealousies and suppress all spirit of revenge. It will save us from idle worry and fruitless rebellion against such ills as cannot be cured. In short, it will free our lives from the crippling influence of negative moods and critical attitudes. It will teach us to _be ruled by our admirations rather than by our aversions_.  Above all, he who would build a personality fitted to serve as the teacher of the child in his religion must constantly live in the presence of _the best he can attain in God_. There is no substitute for this. No fullness of intellectual power and grasp, no richness of knowledge gleaned, and no degree of skill in instruction can take the place of a vibrant, immediate, Spirit-filled consciousness of God in the heart. For religion is _life_, and the best definition of religion we can present to the child is the example and warmth of a life inspired and vivified by contact with the Source of all spiritual being. The authority of the teacher should rest on his own religious experience, rather than on the spiritual"]]]
