Ralph Gardner, in his _England's Grievance Discovered_ (1655), speaks also of two prickers, Thomas Shovel and Cuthbert Nicholson, who, in 1649 and 1650, were sent by the magistrates of Newcastle-on-Tyne, into Scotland, there to confer with another very able man in that line and bring him back to Newcastle. They were to have twenty shillings, but the Scotchman three pounds, per head _of all they could convict_, and a free passage there and back. When these wretches got to any town--for they tried all the chief market-towns in the district--the crier used to go round with his bell, desiring \"all people that would bring in any complaint against any woman for a witch, they should be sent for and tried by the person appointed.\" As many as thirty women were brought at once into the Newcastle town-hall, stripped and pricked, and twenty-seven set aside as guilty. Gardner continues:--       The said witch-finder acquainted Lieutenant-Colonel Hobson      that he knew women whether they were witches or no by their      looks; and when the said person was searching of a      personable and good-like woman, the said colonel replied and      said, 'Surely this woman is none, and need not be tried;'      but the Scotchman said she was, for the town said she was,      and therefore he would try her; and presently, in sight of      all the people, laid her body naked to the waist, with her      clothes over her head, by which fright and shame all her      blood contracted into one part of her body, and then he ran      a pin into her thigh, and then suddenly let her coats fall,      and then demanded whether she had nothing of his in her      body, but did not bleed? But she, being amazed, replied      little. Then he put his hands up her coats and pulled out      the pin, and set her aside as a guilty person and child of      the devil, and fell to try others, whom he made guilty.      Lieutenant-Colonel Hobson, perceiving the alteration of the      aforesaid woman by her blood settling in her right parts,      caused that woman to be brought again, and her clothes      pulled up to her thigh, and required the Scot to run the pin      into the same place, and then it gushed out of blood, and      the said Scot cleared her, and said she was not a child of      the devil.  If this precious wretch had not been stopped he would have declared half the women in the north country to be witches. But the magistrates and the people got tired of him at last, and his imposture being discovered, he was hanged in Scotland. At the gallows he confessed that he had been the death of 220 men and women in England and Scotland, simply for the sake of the twenty shillings which he generally received as blood-money.         *       *       *       *       *  The belief in _Sorcerots_, or witches' spells of a peculiar kind, mentioned in the _Depositions_ (pages 22, 23, &c.) receives curious modern confirmation by a kindred superstition still current among the emancipated negroes of the United States. It was described in a letter on \"Voudouism in Virginia\" which appeared in the _New York Tribune_, dated Richmond, September 17, 1875. Mr. Moncure D. Conway, in quoting this and commenting on it in his _Demonology and Devil-Lore_ (Vol. I. pages 68-69), says that it belongs to a class of superstitions generally kept close from the whites, as he believes, because of their purely African origin. Mr. Conway is, however, probably mistaken about the origin, seeing that the same belief prevailed in Guernsey three centuries ago. The extract from the letter is as follows:--       If an ignorant negro is smitten with a disease which he      cannot comprehend, he often imagines himself the victim of      witchcraft, and having no faith in \"white folks' physic\" for      such ailments, must apply to one of these quacks. A      physician residing near the city [Richmond] was invited by      such a one to witness his mode of procedure with a dropsical      patient for whom the physician in question had occasionally      charitably prescribed. Curiosity led him to attend the      seance, having previously informed the quack that since the      case was in such hands he relinquished all connection with      it. On the coverlet of the bed on which the sick man lay,      was spread a quantity of bones, feathers, and other trash.      The charlatan went through with a series of so-called      conjurations, burned feathers, hair, and tiny fragments of      wood in a charcoal furnace, and mumbled gibberish past the      physician's comprehension. He then proceeded to rip open the      pillows and bolsters, and took from them some queer      conglomerations of feathers. These he said had caused all      the trouble. Sprinkling a whitish powder over them, he burnt      them in his furnace. A black offensive smoke was produced,      and he announced triumphantly that the evil influence was      destroyed, and that the patient would surely get well. He      died not many days later, believing, in common with his      friends and relatives, that the conjurations of the \"trick      doctor\" had failed to save him only because resorted to too      late.  From the above it is evident that the natural tendency of wool and feathers to felt and clog together, has been distorted, by widely different peoples, into an outward and visible sign that occult and malignant influences were at work.         *       *       *       *       *  As to the manner in which wizards and witches were put to the question in Guernsey--that is tortured until they confessed whatever was required of them--Mr. Warburton, a herald and celebrated antiquary who wrote in the reign of Charles II., has given a circumstancial account, the correctness of which may be relied on. His _Treatise on the History, Laws and Customs of the Island of Guernsey_, bears the date of 1682, and at page 126 he says:--       By the law approved (_Terrien_, Lib. xii. cap. 37), torture      is to be used, though not upon slight presumption, yet where      the presumptive proof is strong, and much more when the      proof is positive, and there wants only the confession of      the party accused. Yet this practice of torturing does not      appear to have been used in the island for some ages, except      in the case of witches, when it was too frequently applied,      near a century since. The custom then was, when any person      was supposed guilty of sorcery or witchcraft, they carried      them to a place in the town called _La Tour Beauregard_, and      there, tying their hands behind them by the two thumbs, drew      them to a certain height with an engine made for that      purpose, by which means sometimes their shoulders were      turned round; and sometimes their thumbs torn off; but this      fancy of witches has for some years been laid aside.  It will be noticed in the subsequent _Confessions_ of witches (page 11, &c.), that a number of colons (:) are inserted in the text where they would not be required as ordinary marks of punctuation. These correspond, however, to similar pauses in the original records, and evidently indicate the successive stages by which the story was wrung from the wretched victims. They are thus endowed with a sad and ghastly significance, which must be borne in mind when the confessions are read. It must also be remembered that these confessions were not usually made in the connected form in which they stand recorded, but were rather the result of leading questions put by the inquisitors, such as: How old were you when the Devil first appeared to you? What form did he assume? What parish were you in? What were you doing? &c., &c.  Melancholy and revolting as all this is, yet the tortures made use of in Guernsey were far from possessing those refinements of cruelty and that intensity of brutality which characterised the methods practiced in some other countries. Let us take as a proof of this, the notable case of Dr. Fian and his associates, who were tried at Edinburgh, in the year 1591. The evidence was of the usual ridiculous kind, and a confession--afterwards withdrawn--was extorted by the following blood-curdling barbarities, as is quoted by Mr. C.K. Sharpe, in his _Historical Account of the Belief in Witchcraft in Scotland_:--       The said Doctor was taken and imprisoned, and used with the      accustomed paine provided for those offences inflicted upon      the rest, as is aforesaid. First, by thrawing of his head      with a rope, whereat he would confesse nothing. Secondly, he      was perswaded by faire meanes to confesse his follies; but      that would prevaile as little. Lastly, hee was put to the      most severe and cruell paine in the world, called the      bootes, who, after he had received three strokes, being      inquired if he would confesse his damnable actes and wicked      life, his toong would not serve him to speak; in respect      whereof, the rest of the witches willed to search his toong,      under which was founde two pinnes thrust up into the heade,      whereupon the witches did say, now is the charme stinted,      and shewed that these charmed pins were the cause he could      not confesse any thing; then was he immediately released of      the bootes, brought before the King, his confession was      taken, and his own hand willingly set thereunto.... But this      Doctor, notwithstanding that his owne confession appeareth      remaining in recorde under his owne hande-writing, and the      same thereunto fixed in the presence of the King's majestie,      and sundrie of his councell, yet did he utterly denie the      same. Whereupon the Kinges majestie, perceiving his      stubbourne wilfulnesse, conceived and imagined that in the      time of his absence hee had entered into newe conference and      league with the devill, his master, and that hee had beene      agayne newly marked, for the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17208"],["title","The Tales of Mother Goose (#1)"],["body","ight, and telling her, at the same time, that if she stayed one moment longer, the coach would be a pumpkin again, her horses mice, her coachman a rat, her footmen lizards, and her clothes would become just as they were before.  She promised her godmother she would not fail to leave the ball before midnight. She drove away, scarce able to contain herself for joy. The King's son, who was told that a great princess, whom nobody knew, was come, ran out to receive her. He gave her his hand as she alighted from the coach, and led her into the hall where the company were assembled. There was at once a profound silence; every one left off dancing, and the violins ceased to play, so attracted was every one by the singular beauties of the unknown newcomer. Nothing was then heard but a confused sound of voices saying:--  \"Ha! how beautiful she is! Ha! how beautiful she is!\"  The King himself, old as he was, could not keep his eyes off her, and he told the Queen under his breath that it was a long time since he had seen so beautiful and lovely a creature.  All the ladies were busy studying her clothes and head-dress, so that they might have theirs made next day after the same pattern, provided they could meet with such fine materials and able hands to make them.  The King's son conducted her to the seat of honor, and afterwards took her out to dance with him. She danced so very gracefully that they all admired her more and more. A fine collation was served, but the young Prince ate not a morsel, so intently was he occupied with her.  She went and sat down beside her sisters, showing them a thousand civilities, and giving them among other things part of the oranges and citrons with which the Prince had regaled her. This very much surprised them, for they had not been presented to her.  Cinderella heard the clock strike a quarter to twelve. She at once made her adieus to the company and hastened away as fast as she could.  As soon as she got home, she ran to find her godmother, and, after having thanked her, she said she much wished she might go to the ball the next day, because the King's son had asked her to do so. As she was eagerly telling her godmother all that happened at the ball, her two sisters knocked at the door; Cinderella opened it. \"How long you have stayed!\" said she, yawning, rubbing her eyes, and stretching herself as if she had been just awakened. She had not, however, had any desire to sleep since they went from home.  \"If you had been at the ball,\" said one of her sisters, \"you would not have been tired with it. There came thither the finest princess, the most beautiful ever was seen with mortal eyes. She showed us a thousand civilities, and gave us oranges and citrons.\"  Cinderella did not show any pleasure at this. Indeed, she asked them the name of the princess; but they told her they did not know it, and that the King's son was very much concerned, and would give all the world to know who she was. At this Cinderella, smiling, replied:--  \"Was she then so very beautiful? How fortunate you have been! Could I not see her? Ah! dear Miss Charlotte, do lend me your yellow suit of clothes which you wear every day.\"  \"Ay, to be sure!\" cried Miss Charlotte; \"lend my clothes to such a dirty Cinderwench as thou art! I should be out of my mind to do so.\"  Cinderella, indeed, expected such an answer and was very glad of the refusal; for she would have been sadly troubled if her sister had lent her what she jestingly asked for. The next day the two sisters went to the ball, and so did Cinderella, but dressed more magnificently than before. The King's son was always by her side, and his pretty speeches to her never ceased. These by no means annoyed the young lady. Indeed, she quite forgot her godmother's orders to her, so that she heard the clock begin to strike twelve when she thought it could not be more than eleven. She then rose up and fled, as nimble as a deer. The Prince followed, but could not overtake her. She left behind one of her glass slippers, which the Prince took up most carefully. She got home, but quite out of breath, without her carriage, and in her old clothes, having nothing left her of all her finery but one of the little slippers, fellow to the one she had dropped. The guards at the palace gate were asked if they had not seen a princess go out, and they replied they had seen nobody go out but a young girl, very meanly dressed, and who had more the air of a poor country girl than of a young lady.  When the two sisters returned from the ball, Cinderella asked them if they had had a pleasant time, and if the fine lady had been there. They told her, yes; but that she hurried away the moment it struck twelve, and with so much haste that she dropped one of her little glass slippers, the prettiest in the world, which the King's son had taken up. They said, further, that he had done nothing but look at her all the time, and that most certainly he was very much in love with the beautiful owner of the glass slipper.  What they said was true; for a few days after the King's son caused it to be proclaimed, by sound of trumpet, that he would marry her whose foot this slipper would fit exactly. They began to try it on the princesses, then on the duchesses, and then on all the ladies of the Court; but in vain. It was brought to the two sisters, who did all they possibly could to thrust a foot into the slipper, but they could not succeed. Cinderella, who saw this, and knew her slipper, said to them, laughing:--  \"Let me see if it will not fit me.\"  Her sisters burst out a-laughing, and began to banter her. The gentleman who was sent to try the slipper looked earnestly at Cinderella, and, finding her very handsome, said it was but just that she should try, and that he had orders to let every lady try it on.  He obliged Cinderella to sit down, and, putting the slipper to her little foot, he found it went on very easily, and fitted her as if it had been made of wax. The astonishment of her two sisters was great, but it was still greater when Cinderella pulled out of her pocket the other slipper and put it on her foot. Thereupon, in came her godmother, who, having touched Cinderella's clothes with her wand, made them more magnificent than those she had worn before.  [Illustration: \"IT WENT ON VERY EASILY.\" p. 10.]  And now her two sisters found her to be that beautiful lady they had seen at the ball. They threw themselves at her feet to beg pardon for all their ill treatment of her. Cinderella took them up, and, as she embraced them, said that she forgave them with all her heart, and begged them to love her always.  She was conducted to the young Prince, dressed as she was. He thought her more charming than ever, and, a few days after, married her. Cinderella, who was as good as she was beautiful, gave her two sisters a home in the palace, and that very same day married them to two great lords of the Court.     THE SLEEPING BEAUTY IN THE WOODS.   Once upon a time there was a king and a queen, who were very sorry that they had no children,--so sorry that it cannot be told.  At last, however, the Queen had a daughter. There was a very fine christening; and the Princess had for her godmothers all the fairies they could find in the whole kingdom (there were seven of them), so that every one of them might confer a gift upon her, as was the custom of fairies in those days. By this means the Princess had all the perfections imaginable.  After the christening was over, the company returned to the King's palace, where was prepared a great feast for the fairies. There was placed before every one of them a magnificent cover with a case of massive gold, wherein were a spoon, and a knife and fork, all of pure gold set with diamonds and rubies. But as they were all sitting down at table they saw a very old fairy come into the hall. She had not been invited, because for more than fifty years she had not been out of a certain tower, and she was believed to be either dead or enchanted.  The King ordered her a cover, but he could not give her a case of gold as the others had, because seven only had been made for the seven fairies. The old fairy fancied she was slighted, and muttered threats between her teeth. One of the young fairies who sat near heard her, and, judging that she might give the little Princess some unlucky gift, hid herself behind the curtains as soon as they left the table. She hoped that she might speak last and undo as much as she could the evil which the old fairy might do.  In the meanwhile all the fairies began to give their gifts to the Princess. The youngest gave her for her gift that she should be the most beautiful person in the world; the next, that she should have the wit of an angel; the third, that she should be able to do everything she did gracefully; the fourth, that she should dance perfectly; the fifth, that she should sing like a nightingale; and the sixth, that she should play all kinds of musical instruments to the fullest perfection.  The old fairy's turn coming next, her head shaking more with spite than with age, she said that the Princess should pierce her hand with a spindle and die of the wound. This terrible gift made the whole company tremble, and everybody fell a-crying.  At this very instant the young fairy came from behind the curtains and said these words in a loud voice:--  \"Assure yourselves, O King and Queen, that your daughter shall not die of this disaster. It is true, I have no power to undo entirely what my elder has done. The Princess shall indeed pierce her hand with a spindle; but, instead of dying, she shall only fall into a deep sleep, which shall last a hundred years, at the end of which a king's son shall come and awake her.\"  The King, to avoid the misfortune foretold by the old fairy, issued orders forbidding any one, on pain of death, to spin with a distaff and spindle, or to have a spindle in his house.
