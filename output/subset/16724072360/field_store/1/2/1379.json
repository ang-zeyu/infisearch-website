Aristotle's Physics, Ethics, and Politics were \"tutor's books,\" and those young men who loved to hear themselves talk were left free to discuss, much to Hobbes's disgust, \"the freedom of the will, incorporeal substance, everlasting nows, ubiquities, hypostases, which the people understand not nor will ever care for.\"  In the life of Matthew Robinson,[11:1] who went up to Cambridge a little later than Marvell (June 1645), and was probably a harder reader, we are told that \"the strength of his studies lay in the metaphysics and in those subtle authors for many years which rendered him an irrefragable disputant _de quolibet ente_, and whilst he was but senior freshman he was found in the bachelor schools, disputing ably with the best of the senior sophisters.\" Robinson despised the old-fashioned Ethics and Physics, but with the new Cartesian or Experimental Philosophy he was _inter primos_. History, particularly the Roman, was in great favour at both Universities at this time, and young men were taught, so old Hobbes again grumbles, to despise monarchy \"from Cicero, Seneca, Cato and other politicians of Rome, and Aristotle of Athens, who seldom spake of kings but as of wolves and other ravenous beasts.\"[12:1] The Muses were never neglected at Cambridge, as the University exercises survive to prove, whilst modern languages, Spanish and Italian for example, were greedily acquired by such an eager spirit as Richard Crashaw, the poet, who came into residence at Pembroke in 1631. There were problems to be \"kept\" in the college chapel, lectures to be attended, both public and private, declamations to be delivered, and even in the vacations the scholars were not exempt from \"exercises\" either in hall or in their tutors' rooms. Earnest students read their Greek Testaments, and even their Hebrew Bibles, and filled their note-books, working more hours a day than was good for their health, whilst the idle ones wasted their time as best they could in an unhealthy, over-crowded town, in an age which knew nothing of boating, billiards, or cricket. A tennis-court there was in Marvell's time, for in Dr. Worthington's _Diary_, under date 3rd of April 1637, it stands recorded that on that day and in that place that learned man received \"a dangerous blow on the Eye.\"[12:2]  The only incident we know of Marvell's undergraduate days is remarkable enough, for, boy though he was, he seems, like the Gibbon of a later day, to have suddenly become a Roman Catholic. This occurrence may serve to remind us how, during Marvell's time at Trinity, the University of Cambridge (ever the precursor in thought-movements) had a Catholic revival of her own, akin to that one which two hundred years afterwards happened at Oxford, and has left so much agreeable literature behind it. Fuller in his history of the University of Cambridge tells us a little about this highly interesting and important movement:--     \"Now began the University (1633-4) to be much beautified in    buildings, every college either casting its skin with the snake, or    renewing its bill with the eagle, having their courts or at least    their fronts and Gatehouses repaired and adorned. But the greatest    alteration was in their Chapels, most of them being graced with the    accession of organs. And seeing musick is one of the liberal arts,    how could it be quarrelled at in an University if they sang with    understanding both of the matter and manner thereof. Yet some took    great distaste thereat as attendancie to superstition.\"[13:1]  The chapel at Peterhouse, we read elsewhere, which was built in 1632, and consecrated by Bishop White of Ely, had a beautiful ceiling and a noble east window. \"A grave divine,\" Fuller tells us, \"preaching before the University at St. Mary's, had this smart passage in his Sermon--that as at the Olympian Games he was counted the Conqueror who could drive his chariot wheels nearest the mark yet so as not to hinder his running or to stick thereon, so he who in his Sermons could preach _near Popery_ and yet _no Popery_, _there was your man_. And indeed it now began to be the general complaint of most moderate men that many in the University, both in the schools and pulpits, approached the opinions of the Church of Rome nearer than ever before.\"  Archbishop Laud, unlike the bishops of Dr. Newman's day, favoured the Catholic revival, and when Mr. Bernard, the lecturer of St. Sepulchre's, London, preached a \"No Popery\" sermon at St. Mary's, Cambridge, he was dragged into the High Commission Court, and, as the hateful practice then was, a practice dear to the soul of Laud, was bidden to subscribe a formal recantation. This Mr. Bernard refused to do, though professing his sincere sorrow and penitence for any oversights and hasty expressions in his sermon. Thereupon he was sent back to prison, where he died. \"If,\" adds Fuller, \"he was miserably abused in prison by the keepers (as some have reported) to the shortening of his life, He that maketh inquisition for blood either hath or will be a revenger thereof.\"[14:1]  By the side of this grim story the much-written-about incidents of the Oxford Movement seem trivial enough.  Not a few Cambridge scholars of this period, Richard Crashaw among the number, found permanent refuge in Rome.  The story of Marvell's conversion is emphatic but vague in its details. The \"Jesuits,\" who were well represented in Cambridge at the time, are said to have persuaded him to leave Cambridge secretly, and to take refuge in one of their houses in London. Thither the elder Marvell followed in pursuit, and after search came across his son in a bookseller's shop, where he succeeded both in convincing the boy of his errors and in persuading him to return to Trinity. An odd story, and not, as it stands, very credible; but Mr. Grosart discovered among the Marvell papers at Hull a fragment of a letter without signature, address, or date, which throws some sort of light on the incident. This letter was evidently, as Mr. Grosart surmises, sent to the elder Marvell by some similarly afflicted parent. In its fragmentary state the letter reads as follows:--     \"Worthy S^r,--M^r Breerecliffe being w^th me to-day, I related vnto    him a fearfull passage lately at Cambridg touching a sonne of mine,    Bachelor of Arts in Katherine Hall, w^ch was this. He was lately    inuited to a supper in towne by a gentlewoman, where was one M^r    Nichols a felow of Peterhouse, and another or two masters of arts, I    know not directly whether felowes or not: my sonne hauing noe    p'ferment, but liuing meerely of my penny, they pressed him much to    come to liue at their house, and for chamber and extraordinary bookes    they promised farre: and then earnestly moued him to goe to Somerset    house, where they could doe much for p'ferring him to some eminent    place, and in conclusion to popish arguments to seduce him soe rotten    and vnsauory as being ouerheard it was brought in question before the    heads of the Uniuersity: _Dr. Cosens_, being _Vice Chancelor_ noe    punishment is inioined him: but on Ash-wednesday next a recantation    in regent house of some popish tenets Nicols let fall: I p'ceive by    M^r Breercliffe some such prank vsed towards y^r sonne: I desire to    know what y^u did therin: thinking I cannot doe god better seruice    then bring it vppon the stage either in Parliament if it hold: or    informing some Lords of the Counsail to whom I stand much oblieged if    a bill in Starchamber be meete To terrify others by making these some    publique spectacle: for if such fearfull practises may goe vnpunished    I take care whether I may send a child ... the lord.\"[15:1]  The reference to Dr. Cosens, or Cosin, being Vice-Chancellor gives a clue to the date, for Cosin was chosen Vice-Chancellor on the 4th of November 1639.[15:2]  Though we can know nothing of the elder Marvell's methods of re-conversion, they were more successful than the elder Gibbon's, who, as we know, packed the future historian off to Lausanne and a Swiss pastor's house. What Gibbon became on leaving off his Romanism we can guess for ourselves, whereas Marvell, once out of the hands of these very shadowy \"Jesuits,\" remained the staunchest of Christian Protestants to the end of his days.  This strange incident, and two college exercises or poems, one in Greek, the other in Latin, both having reference to an addition to the Royal Family, and appearing in the _Musa Cantabrigiensis_ for 1637, are all the materials that exist for weaving the story of Marvell, the Cambridge undergraduate. The Latin verses, which are Horatian in style, contain one pretty stanza, composed apparently before the sex of the new-born infant was known at Cambridge.      \"Sive felici Carolum figur√¢     Parvulus princeps imitetur almae     Sive Mariae decoret puellam                       Dulcis imago.\"  After taking his Bachelor's degree in 1639, Marvell, being still a Scholar of the college, must have gone away, for the Conclusion Book of Trinity, under date September 24, 1641, records as follows:--     \"It is agreed by y^e Master and 8 seniors y^t M^r Carter and D^r    Wakefields, D^r Marvell, D^r Waterhouse, and D^r Maye in regard y^t    some of them are reported to be married and y^t others look not after    y^eir days nor Acts shall receave no more benefitt of y^e Coll and    shall be out of y^ier places unless y^ei shew just cause to y^e Coll    for y^e contrary in 3 months.\"  Dr. Lort, in his amiable letter of 1765, already mentioned, points out that this entry contains no reflection on Marvell's morals, but shows that he was given \"notice to quit\" for non-residence, \"then much more strictly enjoined than it is now.\" The days referred to in the entry were, so the master obligingly explains, \"the certain number allowed by statute to absentees,\" whilst the \"acts mean the Exercises"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17396"],["title","The Secret Garden (#1)"],["body","looked down she saw a little snake gliding along and watching her with eyes like jewels. She was not frightened, because he was a harmless little thing who would not hurt her and he seemed in a hurry to get out of the room. He slipped under the door as she watched him.  \"How queer and quiet it is,\" she said. \"It sounds as if there was no one in the bungalow but me and the snake.\"  Almost the next minute she heard footsteps in the compound, and then on the veranda. They were men's footsteps, and the men entered the bungalow and talked in low voices. No one went to meet or speak to them and they seemed to open doors and look into rooms.  \"What desolation!\" she heard one voice say. \"That pretty, pretty woman! I suppose the child, too. I heard there was a child, though no one ever saw her.\"  Mary was standing in the middle of the nursery when they opened the door a few minutes later. She looked an ugly, cross little thing and was frowning because she was beginning to be hungry and feel disgracefully neglected. The first man who came in was a large officer she had once seen talking to her father. He looked tired and troubled, but when he saw her he was so startled that he almost jumped back.  \"Barney!\" he cried out. \"There is a child here! A child alone! In a place like this! Mercy on us, who is she!\"  \"I am Mary Lennox,\" the little girl said, drawing herself up stiffly. She thought the man was very rude to call her father's bungalow \"A place like this!\" \"I fell asleep when every one had the cholera and I have only just wakened up. Why does nobody come?\"  \"It is the child no one ever saw!\" exclaimed the man, turning to his companions. \"She has actually been forgotten!\"  \"Why was I forgotten?\" Mary said, stamping her foot. \"Why does nobody come?\"  The young man whose name was Barney looked at her very sadly. Mary even thought she saw him wink his eyes as if to wink tears away.  \"Poor little kid!\" he said. \"There is nobody left to come.\"  It was in that strange and sudden way that Mary found out that she had neither father nor mother left; that they had died and been carried away in the night, and that the few native servants who had not died also had left the house as quickly as they could get out of it, none of them even remembering that there was a Missie Sahib. That was why the place was so quiet. It was true that there was no one in the bungalow but herself and the little rustling snake.     CHAPTER II  MISTRESS MARY QUITE CONTRARY   Mary had liked to look at her mother from a distance and she had thought her very pretty, but as she knew very little of her she could scarcely have been expected to love her or to miss her very much when she was gone. She did not miss her at all, in fact, and as she was a self-absorbed child she gave her entire thought to herself, as she had always done. If she had been older she would no doubt have been very anxious at being left alone in the world, but she was very young, and as she had always been taken care of, she supposed she always would be. What she thought was that she would like to know if she was going to nice people, who would be polite to her and give her her own way as her Ayah and the other native servants had done.  She knew that she was not going to stay at the English clergyman's house where she was taken at first. She did not want to stay. The English clergyman was poor and he had five children nearly all the same age and they wore shabby clothes and were always quarreling and snatching toys from each other. Mary hated their untidy bungalow and was so disagreeable to them that after the first day or two nobody would play with her. By the second day they had given her a nickname which made her furious.  It was Basil who thought of it first. Basil was a little boy with impudent blue eyes and a turned-up nose and Mary hated him. She was playing by herself under a tree, just as she had been playing the day the cholera broke out. She was making heaps of earth and paths for a garden and Basil came and stood near to watch her. Presently he got rather interested and suddenly made a suggestion.  \"Why don't you put a heap of stones there and pretend it is a rockery?\" he said. \"There in the middle,\" and he leaned over her to point.  \"Go away!\" cried Mary. \"I don't want boys. Go away!\"  For a moment Basil looked angry, and then he began to tease. He was always teasing his sisters. He danced round and round her and made faces and sang and laughed.            \"Mistress Mary, quite contrary,               How does your garden grow?            With silver bells, and cockle shells,               And marigolds all in a row.\"  He sang it until the other children heard and laughed, too; and the crosser Mary got, the more they sang \"Mistress Mary, quite contrary\"; and after that as long as she stayed with them they called her \"Mistress Mary Quite Contrary\" when they spoke of her to each other, and often when they spoke to her.  \"You are going to be sent home,\" Basil said to her, \"at the end of the week. And we're glad of it.\"  \"I am glad of it, too,\" answered Mary. \"Where is home?\"  \"She doesn't know where home is!\" said Basil, with seven-year-old scorn. \"It's England, of course. Our grandmama lives there and our sister Mabel was sent to her last year. You are not going to your grandmama. You have none. You are going to your uncle. His name is Mr. Archibald Craven.\"  \"I don't know anything about him,\" snapped Mary.  \"I know you don't,\" Basil answered. \"You don't know anything. Girls never do. I heard father and mother talking about him. He lives in a great, big, desolate old house in the country and no one goes near him. He's so cross he won't let them, and they wouldn't come if he would let them. He's a hunchback, and he's horrid.\"  \"I don't believe you,\" said Mary; and she turned her back and stuck her fingers in her ears, because she would not listen any more.  But she thought over it a great deal afterward; and when Mrs. Crawford told her that night that she was going to sail away to England in a few days and go to her uncle, Mr. Archibald Craven, who lived at Misselthwaite Manor, she looked so stony and stubbornly uninterested that they did not know what to think about her. They tried to be kind to her, but she only turned her face away when Mrs. Crawford attempted to kiss her, and held herself stiffly when Mr. Crawford patted her shoulder.  \"She is such a plain child,\" Mrs. Crawford said pityingly, afterward. \"And her mother was such a pretty creature. She had a very pretty manner, too, and Mary has the most unattractive ways I ever saw in a child. The children call her 'Mistress Mary Quite Contrary,' and though it's naughty of them, one can't help understanding it.\"  \"Perhaps if her mother had carried her pretty face and her pretty manners oftener into the nursery Mary might have learned some pretty ways too. It is very sad, now the poor beautiful thing is gone, to remember that many people never even knew that she had a child at all.\"  \"I believe she scarcely ever looked at her,\" sighed Mrs. Crawford. \"When her Ayah was dead there was no one to give a thought to the little thing. Think of the servants running away and leaving her all alone in that deserted bungalow. Colonel McGrew said he nearly jumped out of his skin when he opened the door and found her standing by herself in the middle of the room.\"  Mary made the long voyage to England under the care of an officer's wife, who was taking her children to leave them in a boarding-school. She was very much absorbed in her own little boy and girl, and was rather glad to hand the child over to the woman Mr. Archibald Craven sent to meet her, in London. The woman was his housekeeper at Misselthwaite Manor, and her name was Mrs. Medlock. She was a stout woman, with very red cheeks and sharp black eyes. She wore a very purple dress, a black silk mantle with jet fringe on it and a black bonnet with purple velvet flowers which stuck up and trembled when she moved her head. Mary did not like her at all, but as she very seldom liked people there was nothing remarkable in that; besides which it was very evident Mrs. Medlock did not think much of her.  \"My word! she's a plain little piece of goods!\" she said. \"And we'd heard that her mother was a beauty. She hasn't handed much of it down, has she, ma'am?\"  \"Perhaps she will improve as she grows older,\" the officer's wife said good-naturedly. \"If she were not so sallow and had a nicer expression, her features are rather good. Children alter so much.\"  \"She'll have to alter a good deal,\" answered Mrs. Medlock. \"And there's nothing likely to improve children at Misselthwaite--if you ask me!\"  They thought Mary was not listening because she was standing a little apart from them at the window of the private hotel they had gone to. She was watching the passing buses and cabs, and people, but she heard quite well and was made very curious about her uncle and the place he lived in. What sort of a place was it, and what would he be like? What was a hunchback? She had never seen one. Perhaps there were none in India.  Since she had been living in other people's houses and had had no Ayah, she had begun to feel lonely and to think queer thoughts which were new to her. She had begun to wonder why she had never seemed to belong to any one even when her father and mother had been alive. Other children seemed to belong to their fathers and mothers, but she had never seemed to really be any one's little girl. She had had servants, and food and clothes, but no one had taken any notice of her. She did not know that this was because she was a disagreeable child; but then, of course, she did not know she was disagreeable. She often thought that other people were, but she did not know that she was so herself.  She thought Mrs. Medlock the most disagreeable person she had ever seen, with her common, highly colored face and her common fine bonnet. When the next day they set out on their journey to"]]]
