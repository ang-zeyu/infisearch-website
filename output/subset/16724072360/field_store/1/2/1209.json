To those who seek him, he is near;       He looks upon the heart,     And from the humble and sincere       He never will depart.      He sees our thoughts, our wishes knows,       He hears our faintest prayer;     Where'er the faithful Christian goes,       He finds his Father there.      Obedient children need not fear;       God is a faithful friend,     And when no other help is near,       He will deliverance send.      Then fear not hunger, cold, or pain,       But fear to disobey     That power which does your life sustain,       And guards you every day.   \"THY WILL BE DONE.\"      How sweet to be allowed to pray       To God, the Holy One,     With filial love and trust to say,--       \"Father, thy will be done!\"      We in these sacred words can find       A cure for every ill;     They calm and soothe the troubled mind,       And bid all care be still.      O, let that will, which gave me breath       And an immortal soul,     In joy or grief, in life or death,       My every wish control!      O, could my heart thus ever pray,       Thus imitate thy Son!     Teach me, O God, with truth to say,--       \"Thy will, not mine, be done!\"   SABBATH DAY.      How sweet upon this sacred day,       The best of all the seven,     To cast our earthly thoughts away,       And think of God and heaven!      How sweet to be allowed to pray       Our sins may be forgiven;     With filial confidence to say,       \"Father, who art in heaven\"!      With humble hope to bend the knee,       And, free from folly's leaven,     Confess that we have strayed from thee,       Thou righteous Judge in heaven!      And if to make all sin depart       In vain the will has striven,     He who regards the inmost heart       Will send his grace from heaven.      If from the bosom that is dear       By cold unkindness driven,     The heart that knows no refuge here       Shall find a friend in heaven.      Then hail, thou sacred, blessed day,       The best of all the seven,     When hearts unite their vows to pay       Of gratitude to Heaven.   THE GOOD BOY'S HYMN ON GOING TO BED.      How sweet to lay my weary head     Upon my quiet little bed,     And feel assured, that all day long     I have not knowingly done wrong!      How sweet to hear my mother say,     \"You have been very good to-day!\"     How sweet to see my father's joy     When he can say, \"My dear, good boy!\"      How sweet it is my thoughts to send     To many a dear-loved distant friend,     And feel, if they my heart could see,     How very happy they would be!      How sweet to think that He whose love     Made all these shining worlds above     My pure and happy heart can see,     And loves a little boy like me.  [Illustration]   GOD IS GOOD.      Thou art good! Each perfumed flower,       Waving fields, the dark green wood,     The insect fluttering for an hour,--       All things proclaim that God is good.      I hear it in each breath of wind;       The hills that have for ages stood,     And clouds with gold and silver lined,       All still repeat that God is good.      Each little rill, that many a year       Has the same verdant path pursued,     And every bird, in accents clear,       Joins in the song that God is good.      The restless sea, with haughty roar,       Calms each wild wave and billow rude,     Retreats submissive from the shore,       And swells the chorus, \"God is good.\"      The countless hosts of twinkling stars,       That sing his praise with light renewed;     The rising sun each day declares,       In rays of glory, God is good.      The moon, that walks in brightness, says,       That God is good! and man, endued     With power to speak his Maker's praise,       Should still repeat that God is good.   EVENING.      How beautiful the setting sun!       The clouds how bright and gay!     The stars, appearing one by one,       How beautiful are they!      And when the moon climbs up the sky,       And sheds her gentle light,     And hangs her crystal lamp on high,       How beautiful is night!      And can it be I am possessed       Of something brighter far?     Glows there a light within this breast       Outshining every star?      Yes; should the sun and stars turn pale,       The mountains melt away,     This flame within shall never fail,       But live in endless day.      This is the soul that God has given,--       Sin may its lustre dim;     While goodness bears it up to heaven,       And leads it back to him.   ROBINSON CRUSOE'S HYMN.      My Heavenly Father! all I see,       Around me and above,     Sends forth a hymn of praise to thee,       And speaks thy boundless love.      The clear blue sky is full of thee,       The woods so dark and lone;     The soft south-wind, the sounding sea,       Worship the Holy One.      The humming of the insect throng,       The prattling, sparkling rill,     The birds, with their melodious song,       Repeat thy praises still.      And thou dost hear them every one,--       Father, thou hearest me;     I know that I am not alone,       When I but think of thee.   HYMN.      It was my Heavenly Father's love       Brought every being forth;     He made the shining worlds above,       And every thing on earth.      Each lovely flower, the smallest fly,       The sea, the waterfall,     The bright green fields, the clear blue sky,--       'Tis God that made them all.      He gave me all my friends, and taught       My heart to love them well,     And he bestowed the power of thought,       And speech my thoughts to tell.      My father and my mother dear,--       He is their father too;     He bids me all their precepts hear,       And all they teach me, do.      God sees and hears me all the day,       And 'mid the darkest night;     He views me when I disobey,       And when I act aright.      He guards me with a parent's care,       When I am all alone;     My hymn of praise, my humble prayer,       He hears them every one.      God hears what I am saying now,--       O, what a wondrous thought!     My Heavenly Father, teach me how       To love thee as I ought.   ON PRAYER.      As through the pathless fields of air       Wandered forth the timid dove,     So the heart, in humble prayer,       Essays to reach the throne of love.      Like her it may return unblest,       Like her again may soar,     And still return and find no rest,       No peaceful, happy shore.      But now once more she spreads her wings,       And takes a bolder flight,     And see! the olive-branch she brings,       To bless her master's sight.      And thus the heart renews its strength,       Though spent and tempest-driven,     And higher soars, and brings at length       A pledge of peace with Heaven.   \"THE SPIRIT GIVETH LIFE.\"      What was in the viewless wind,       Wild rushing through the oak,     Seemed to my listening, dreaming mind       As though a spirit spoke?      What is it to the murmuring stream       Doth give so sweet a song,     That on its tide my thoughts do seem       To pour themselves along?      What is it on the dizzy height,       What in each glowing star,     That speaks of things beyond the sight,       And questions what they are?      What in the rolling thunder's voice,       What in the ocean's roar,     Hears the grand chorus, \"O, rejoice!\"       Echo from shore to shore?      What in the gentle moon doth see       Pure thoughts and tender love,     And hears delicious melody       Around, below, above?      What bids the savage tempest speak       Of terror and dismay,     And wakes the agonizing shriek       Of guilt that fears to pray?      It is this ever-living mind;       This little throb of life     Hears its own echoes in the wind,       And in the tempest's strife;      To all that's sweet, and bright, and fair,       Its own affections gives;     Sees its own image everywhere,       Through all creation lives.      It bids the everlasting hills       Give back the solemn tone;     This boundless arch of azure fills       With accents all its own.      What is this life-inspiring mind,       This omnipresent thought?     How shall it ever utterance find       For all itself hath taught?      To Him who breathed the heavenly flame,       Its mysteries are known;     It seeks the source from whence it came,       And rests in God alone.   WE NEVER PART FROM THEE.      God, who dwellest everywhere     God, who makest all thy care,     God, who hearest every prayer,         Thou who see'st the heart;      Thou to whom we lift our eyes.     Father, help our souls to rise,     And, beyond these narrow skies,         See thee as thou art!      Let our anxious thoughts be still,     Holy trust adore thy will,     Holy love our bosoms fill,         Let our songs ascend!     Dearest friends may parted be,     All our earthly treasures flee,     Yet we never part from thee,         Our eternal Friend.   \"I WILL ARISE AND GO TO MY FATHER.\"      Help me, O God, to trust in thee,       Thou high and holy One!     And may my troubled spirit flee       For rest to thee alone.      In thee alone the soul can find       Secure and sweet repose;     And thou canst bid the desert mind       To blossom as the rose.      Let not this spirit, formed to rise       Where angels claim their birth,     Forsake its home beyond the skies,       And cling to barren earth.      The bird of passage knows the sign       That warns him to depart;     Shall I not heed the voice divine,       That whispers in my heart,--      \"Up! plume thy wings, soar far away!       No longer idly roam!     Fly to the realms of endless day;       For this is not thy home.\"      This still, small voice, O, may I hear!       Ere clouds and darkness come,     And thunders in my startled ear       Proclaim my final doom.      Father! to thee my spirit cries!       Thy wandering child reclaim.

EVENING HYMN.      Thou, from whom we never part,       Thou, whose love is everywhere,     Thou who seest every heart,       Listen to our evening prayer.      Father! fill our souls with love,       Love unfailing, full, and free,     Love no injury can move,       Love that ever rests on thee.      Heavenly Father! through the night       Keep us safe from every ill;     Cheerful as the morning light,       May we wake to do thy will.   AUTUMN.      Sweet Summer, with her flowers, has past,       I hear her parting knell;     I hear the moaning, fitful blast,       Sighing a sad farewell.      But, while she fades and dies away,       In rainbow hues she glows;     Like the last smile of parting day,       Still brightening as she goes.      The robin whistles clear and shrill;       Sad is the cricket's song;     The wind, wild rushing o'er the hill,       Bears the dead leaf along.      I love this sober, solemn time,       This twilight of the year;     To me, sweet Spring, in all her prime,       Was never half so dear.      While death has set his changing seal       On all that meets the eye,     'Tis rapture, then, within to feel       The soul that cannot die;--      To look far, far beyond this sky,       To Him who changes never.     This earth, these heavens, shall change and die;       God is the same for ever.   THE LORD'S DAY.      This is the day when Jesus woke       From the deep slumbers of the tomb;     This is the day the Saviour broke       The bonds of fear and hopeless gloom.      This is indeed a holy day;       No longer may we dread to die.     Let every fear be cast away,       And tears be wiped from every eye.      Sorrow and pain the Saviour knew;       A dark and thorny path he trod;     But heaven was ever in his view,--       That toilsome path led up to God.      Let every heart rejoice and sing;       Let every sin and sorrow cease;     Let children come this day and bring       Their offering of love and peace.   THE MINISTRY OF PAIN.      Cease, my complaining spirit, cease;       Know 'tis a Father's hand you feel;     It leads you to the realms of peace;       It kindly only wounds to heal.      My Father! what a holy joy       Bursts on the sad, desponding mind,     To say, when fiercest ills annoy,--       \"I know my Father still is kind!\"      This bids each trembling fear be still,       Checks every murmur, every sigh;     Patience then waits his sovereign will,       Rejoiced to live,--resigned to die.      O blessed ministry of pain!       To teach the soul its real worth;     To lead it to that source again,       From whence it first derived its birth.   \"BY FAITH YE ARE SAVED.\"      Christian! when, overwhelmed with grief and care,       Thou prayest for the help that thou dost need,       As shipwrecked mariner for life will plead,     O, then for faith pour forth the fervent prayer!     'Tis faith alone life's heavy ills can bear.       O, mark her calm, far-seeing, quickening eye,       Full of the light of immortality!       It tells of worlds unseen, and calls us there;       That look of hers can save thee from despair.      When sorrow, like thick darkness, gathers round,       And all life's flowers are fading in the dust,     Faith lifts our drooping vision from the ground,--       Says, that the hand that smites us yet is just;     That human agony hath ever found       The mighty God a never-failing trust.   EVENING PRAYER.      Great Source of being,     Father all-seeing!     We bow before thee;     Our souls adore thee;     Help us obey thee;     Guide us aright;     Keep us, we pray thee,     Through the long night.      Thou kind, forgiving     God of all living,     Thy power defend us,     Thy peace attend us,     While we are closing     This day in prayer,     Ever reposing     Under thy care.   EVENING HYMN.      Before I close my eyes to-night,       Let me myself these questions ask:--     Have I endeavoured to do right,       Nor thought my duty was a task?      Have I been gentle, lowly, meek,       And the small voice of conscience heard?     When passion tempted me to speak,       Have I repressed the angry word?      Have I with cheerful zeal obeyed       What my kind parents bid me do,     And not by word or action said       The thing that was not strictly true?      In hard temptation's troubled hour,       Then have I stopped to think and pray,     That God would give my soul the power       To chase the sinful thought away?      O Thou who seest all my heart,       Wilt thou forgive and love me still!     Wilt thou to me new strength impart,       And make me love to do thy will!   LINES WRITTEN AT MIDNIGHT.  TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN OF A.G. EBERHARD.      The sun in smiles doth dress his face,     As evening comes to take his place;     So looks the parting loved-one, when     He means to quickly come again.      With moon and stars all sparkling bright,     Advances now the silent night;     And with the calm and gentle moon,     Sweet peace doth quietly come on.      Who at the moon and stars can gaze     Without a gush of love and praise?     And now it is the midnight hour,     And sleep asserts her soothing power.      But see, the flickering light is gone,     That from my neighbour's window shone;     His simple household prayer is said,     He rests from toil, on his hard bed.      Yet still the watchman wakes, and still     Faithful till morning watch he will;     But vain, O watchman! is thy care,     If God, the Guardian, be not there.      By my dull lamp, whose light's near gone,     In my small room I sit alone,     And, thinking o'er past joys and pain,     A sweet contentment doth remain.      He's still my trust; he, the true Shepherd, never     Will forsake his sheep,--he watcheth ever;     The mother may forget her child, but yet     Thus saith the Lord,--\"Thee I will not forget.\"      I rest in peace, I trust in Thee;     Thy faithful eye still watcheth me;     For He who ever wakes and lives     To loving hearts no night e'er gives.   \"HOPE IN GOD.\"  TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN OF S.A. MAHLMAN.      Hope, my heart, in patience hope,--       Thou at last thy flowers shalt gather;     God is full of tender love,--       Childlike speak thou to thy Father.     From believing, trusting hearts,     The God of mercy ne'er departs.      Clouds may come, and clouds may go,       Rest upon his goodness always;     To those joyful, sunny heights       Lead these rough and gloomy pathways;     Wakes for aye his Eye of Light,--     Tremble not in storm and night.      Anchored on the Eternal Rock,       To the heart of God fast clinging,     Tell him all thy deepest woes,       Before him all thy sorrows bringing;     He is kind, and comfort gives     To every sorrowing heart that lives.      Let true faith strong courage give;       Strength the Helper now is sending;     Soon thou'lt understand His ways,       Soon thou'lt find thy sorrows ending.     God! who life and goodness art!     In patience hope in Him, my heart.   FAILURE AND SUCCESS.      It is in failure, in distress,       When, reft of all, it stands alone,     And not in what men call success,       The noble, valiant soul is known.      He who perfection makes his aim       Shoots at a mark he may not reach;     The world may laugh, the world may blame.       And what it calls _discretion_ preach.      And he will fail to win the goal       Which low ambition makes its own;     But, far beyond, his earnest soul       Stands in the light, though all alone.      It was through insult, pain, and loss       That Jesus won immortal power;     Thus the great failure of the cross       Was his triumphant, glorious hour.      Think not of failure or success;       He fails who has a low desire.     Up to the highest ever press,       Still onward, upward, higher! higher!      Make such thy purpose, such thy aim,       That they who watch thy spirit's flight     Shall look to heaven from whence it came,       And loose thee in celestial light.     SONGS.   THE LITTLE SPRING.      Beneath a green and mossy bank       There flows a clear and fairy stream;     There the pert squirrel oft has drank,       And thought, perhaps, 'twas made for him.      Their pitchers there the laborers fill,       As drop by drop the crystals flow,     Singing their silvery welcome still       To all who to the fountain go.      Then to the river on it glides,       Its tributary drop to bear,     Its modest head a moment hides,       Then rises up and sparkles there.      The touching lesson on my heart       Falls like the gentle dews of heaven,     Bids me with humble love impart       The little treasure God has given.      For from a source as small as this       Full many a cup of joy may flow,     And on the stream of human bliss       Its little ray of gladness throw.   THE LITTLE BOY'S MAY-DAY SONG.      \"The flowers are blooming everywhere,       On every hill and dell,     And O, how beautiful they are!       How sweetly, too, they smell!      \"The little brooks, they dance along,       And look so glad and gay;     I love to hear their pleasant song,       I feel as glad as they.      \"The young lambs bleat and frisk about,       The bees hum round their hive,     The butterflies are coming out,--       'Tis good to be alive.      \"The trees that looked so stiff and gray       With green wreaths now are hung;     O mother! let me laugh and play,       I cannot hold my tongue.      \"See yonder bird spread out his wings,       And mount the clear blue skies;     And hark! how merrily he sings,       As far away he flies.\"      \"Go forth, my child, and laugh and play,       And let your cheerful voice,     With birds, and brooks, and merry May,       Cry loud, Rejoice! rejoice!      \"I would not check your bounding mirth,       My little happy boy,     For He who made this blooming earth       Smiles on an infant's joy.\"   GUESS WHAT I HAVE HEARD.
