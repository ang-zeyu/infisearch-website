Sallie thinks everything is funny--even flunking--and Julia is bored at everything.  She never makes the slightest effort to be amiable.  She believes that if you are a Pendleton, that fact alone admits you to heaven without any further examination.  Julia and I were born to be enemies.  And now I suppose you've been waiting very impatiently to hear what I am learning?  I. Latin:  Second Punic war.  Hannibal and his forces pitched camp at Lake Trasimenus last night.  They prepared an ambuscade for the Romans, and a battle took place at the fourth watch this morning.  Romans in retreat.  II.

It does dreadful things to your liver.                                                    Wednesday  Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,  I've changed my name.  I'm still 'Jerusha' in the catalogue, but I'm 'Judy' everywhere else. It's really too bad, isn't it, to have to give yourself the only pet name you ever had?  I didn't quite make up the Judy though.  That's what Freddy Perkins used to call me before he could talk plainly.  I wish Mrs. Lippett would use a little more ingenuity about choosing babies' names.  She gets the last names out of the telephone book--you'll find Abbott on the first page--and she picks the Christian names up anywhere; she got Jerusha from a tombstone.  I've always hated it; but I rather like Judy.  It's such a silly name.  It belongs to the kind of girl I'm not--a sweet little blue-eyed thing, petted and spoiled by all the family, who romps her way through life without any cares.  Wouldn't it be nice to be like that?  Whatever faults I may have, no one can ever accuse me of having been spoiled by my family! But it's great fun to pretend I've been.  In the future please always address me as Judy.  Do you want to know something?  I have three pairs of kid gloves.  I've had kid mittens before from the Christmas tree, but never real kid gloves with five fingers.  I take them out and try them on every little while.  It's all I can do not to wear them to classes.  (Dinner bell.  Goodbye.)                                                    Friday  What do you think, Daddy?  The English instructor said that my last paper shows an unusual amount of originality.  She did, truly.  Those were her words.  It doesn't seem possible, does it, considering the eighteen years of training that I've had?  The aim of the John Grier Home (as you doubtless know and heartily approve of) is to turn the ninety-seven orphans into ninety-seven twins.  The unusual artistic ability which I exhibit was developed at an early age through drawing chalk pictures of Mrs. Lippett on the woodshed door.  I hope that I don't hurt your feelings when I criticize the home of my youth?  But you have the upper hand, you know, for if I become too impertinent, you can always stop payment of your cheques.  That isn't a very polite thing to say--but you can't expect me to have any manners; a foundling asylum isn't a young ladies' finishing school.  You know, Daddy, it isn't the work that is going to be hard in college. It's the play.  Half the time I don't know what the girls are talking about; their jokes seem to relate to a past that every one but me has shared.  I'm a foreigner in the world and I don't understand the language.  It's a miserable feeling.  I've had it all my life.  At the high school the girls would stand in groups and just look at me.  I was queer and different and everybody knew it.  I could FEEL 'John Grier Home' written on my face.  And then a few charitable ones would make a point of coming up and saying something polite.  I HATED EVERY ONE OF THEM--the charitable ones most of all.  Nobody here knows that I was brought up in an asylum.  I told Sallie McBride that my mother and father were dead, and that a kind old gentleman was sending me to college which is entirely true so far as it goes.  I don't want you to think I am a coward, but I do want to be like the other girls, and that Dreadful Home looming over my childhood is the one great big difference.  If I can turn my back on that and shut out the remembrance, I think, I might be just as desirable as any other girl.  I don't believe there's any real, underneath difference, do you?  Anyway, Sallie McBride likes me!                             Yours ever,                                        Judy Abbott                                            (Nee Jerusha.)                                                Saturday morning  I've just been reading this letter over and it sounds pretty un-cheerful. But can't you guess that I have a special topic due Monday morning and a review in geometry and a very sneezy cold?                                                Sunday  I forgot to post this yesterday, so I will add an indignant postscript. We had a bishop this morning, and WHAT DO YOU THINK HE SAID?  'The most beneficent promise made us in the Bible is this, \"The poor ye have always with you.\"  They were put here in order to keep us charitable.'  The poor, please observe, being a sort of useful domestic animal.  If I hadn't grown into such a perfect lady, I should have gone up after service and told him what I thought.                                                25th October  Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,  I'm in the basket-ball team and you ought to see the bruise on my left shoulder.  It's blue and mahogany with little streaks of orange.  Julia Pendleton tried for the team, but she didn't get in.  Hooray!  You see what a mean disposition I have.  College gets nicer and nicer.  I like the girls and the teachers and the classes and the campus and the things to eat.  We have ice-cream twice a week and we never have corn-meal mush.  You only wanted to hear from me once a month, didn't you?  And I've been peppering you with letters every few days!  But I've been so excited about all these new adventures that I MUST talk to somebody; and you're the only one I know.  Please excuse my exuberance; I'll settle pretty soon.  If my letters bore you, you can always toss them into the wastebasket.  I promise not to write another till the middle of November.                     Yours most loquaciously,                                            Judy Abbott                                             15th November  Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,  Listen to what I've learned to-day.  The area of the convex surface of the frustum of a regular pyramid is half the product of the sum of the perimeters of its bases by the altitude of either of its trapezoids.  It doesn't sound true, but it is--I can prove it!  You've never heard about my clothes, have you, Daddy?  Six dresses, all new and beautiful and bought for me--not handed down from somebody bigger.  Perhaps you don't realize what a climax that marks in the career of an orphan?  You gave them to me, and I am very, very, VERY much obliged.  It's a fine thing to be educated--but nothing compared to the dizzying experience of owning six new dresses.  Miss Pritchard, who is on the visiting committee, picked them out--not Mrs. Lippett, thank goodness.  I have an evening dress, pink mull over silk (I'm perfectly beautiful in that), and a blue church dress, and a dinner dress of red veiling with Oriental trimming (makes me look like a Gipsy), and another of rose-coloured challis, and a grey street suit, and an every-day dress for classes.  That wouldn't be an awfully big wardrobe for Julia Rutledge Pendleton, perhaps, but for Jerusha Abbott--Oh, my!  I suppose you're thinking now what a frivolous, shallow little beast she is, and what a waste of money to educate a girl?  But, Daddy, if you'd been dressed in checked ginghams all your life, you'd appreciate how I feel.  And when I started to the high school, I entered upon another period even worse than the checked ginghams.  The poor box.  You can't know how I dreaded appearing in school in those miserable poor-box dresses.  I was perfectly sure to be put down in class next to the girl who first owned my dress, and she would whisper and giggle and point it out to the others.  The bitterness of wearing your enemies' cast-off clothes eats into your soul.  If I wore silk stockings for the rest of my life, I don't believe I could obliterate the scar.                             LATEST WAR BULLETIN!                        News from the Scene of Action.  At the fourth watch on Thursday the 13th of November, Hannibal routed the advance guard of the Romans and led the Carthaginian forces over the mountains into the plains of Casilinum.  A cohort of light armed Numidians engaged the infantry of Quintus Fabius Maximus.  Two battles and light skirmishing.  Romans repulsed with heavy losses.                             I have the honour of being,                            Your special correspondent from the front,                                                J. Abbott   PS. I know I'm not to expect any letters in return, and I've been warned not to bother you with questions, but tell me, Daddy, just this once--are you awfully old or just a little old?  And are you perfectly bald or just a little bald?  It is very difficult thinking about you in the abstract like a theorem in geometry.  Given a tall rich man who hates girls, but is very generous to one quite impertinent girl, what does he look like?  R.S.V.P.                                                19th December  Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,  You never answered my question and it was very important.                                 ARE YOU BALD?

I hope I shall be thought only to do what is necessary to my justification, thus publicly, solemnly, and heavily censured by those whom I most value and esteem, when I firmly contend that the objections which I, with many others of the friends to the Duke of Portland, have made to Mr. Fox's conduct, are not _calumnies_, but founded on truth,--that they are not _few_, but many,--and that they are not _light and trivial_, but, in a very high degree, serious and important.  That I may avoid the imputation of throwing out, even privately, any loose, random imputations against the public conduct of a gentleman for whom I once entertained a very warm affection, and whose abilities I regard with the greatest admiration, I will put down, distinctly and articulately, some of the matters of objection which I feel to his late doctrines and proceedings, trusting that I shall be able to demonstrate to the friends whose good opinion I would still cultivate, that not levity, nor caprice, nor less defensible motives, but that very grave reasons, influence my judgment. I think that the spirit of his late proceedings is wholly alien to our national policy, and to the peace, to the prosperity, and to the legal liberties of this nation, _according to our ancient domestic and appropriated mode of holding them_.  Viewing things in that light, my confidence in him is not increased, but totally destroyed, by those proceedings. I cannot conceive it a matter of honor or duty (but the direct contrary) in any member of Parliament to continue systematic opposition for the purpose of putting government under difficulties, until Mr. Fox (with all his present ideas) shall have the principal direction of affairs placed in his hands, and until the present body of administration (with their ideas and measures) is of course overturned and dissolved.  To come to particulars.  1. The laws and Constitution of the kingdom intrust the sole and exclusive right of treating with foreign potentates to the king. This is an undisputed part of the legal prerogative of the crown. However, notwithstanding this, Mr. Fox, without the knowledge or participation of any one person in the House of Commons, with whom he was bound by every party principle, in matters of delicacy and importance, confidentially to communicate, thought proper to send Mr. Adair, as his representative, and with his cipher, to St. Petersburg, there to frustrate the objects for which the minister from the crown was authorized to treat. He succeeded in this his design, and did actually frustrate the king's minister in some of the objects of his negotiation.  This proceeding of Mr. Fox does not (as I conceive) amount to absolute high treason,--Russia, though on bad terms, not having been then declaredly at war with this kingdom. But such a proceeding is in law not very remote from that offence, and is undoubtedly a most unconstitutional act, and an high treasonable misdemeanor.  The legitimate and sure mode of communication between this nation and foreign powers is rendered uncertain, precarious, and treacherous, by being divided into two channels,--one with the government, one with the head of a party in opposition to that government; by which means the foreign powers can never be assured of the real authority or validity of any public transaction whatsoever.  On the other hand, the advantage taken of the discontent which at that time prevailed in Parliament and in the nation, to give to an individual an influence directly against the government of his country, in a foreign court, has made a highway into England for the intrigues of foreign courts in our affairs. This is a sore evil,--an evil from which, before this time, England was more free than any other nation. Nothing can preserve us from that evil--which connects cabinet factions abroad with popular factions here--but the keeping sacred the crown as the only channel of communication with every other nation.  This proceeding of Mr. Fox has given a strong countenance and an encouraging example to the doctrines and practices of the Revolution and Constitutional Societies, and of other mischievous societies of that description, who, without any legal authority, and even without any corporate capacity, are in the habit of proposing, and, to the best of their power, of forming, leagues and alliances with France.  This proceeding, which ought to be reprobated on all the general principles of government, is in a more narrow view of things not less reprehensible. It tends to the prejudice of the whole of the Duke of Portland's late party, by discrediting the principles upon which they supported Mr. Fox in the Russian business, as if they of that party also had proceeded in their Parliamentary opposition on the same mischievous principles which actuated Mr. Fox in sending Mr. Adair on his embassy.  2. Very soon after his sending this embassy to Russia, that is, in the spring of 1792, a covenanting club or association was formed in London, calling itself by the ambitious and invidious title of \"_The Friends of the People_.\" It was composed of many of Mr. Fox's own most intimate personal and party friends, joined to a very considerable part of the members of those mischievous associations called the Revolution Society and the Constitutional Society. Mr. Fox must have been well apprised of the progress of that society in every one of its steps, if not of the very origin of it. I certainly was informed of both, who had no connection with the design, directly or indirectly. His influence over the persons who composed the leading part in that association was, and is, unbounded. I hear that he expressed some disapprobation of this club in one case, (that of Mr. St. John,) where his consent was formally asked; yet he never attempted seriously to put a stop to the association, or to disavow it, or to control, check, or modify it in any way whatsoever. If he had pleased, without difficulty, he might have suppressed it in its beginning. However, he did not only not suppress it in its beginning, but encouraged it in every part of its progress, at that particular time when Jacobin clubs (under the very same or similar titles) were making such dreadful havoc in a country not thirty miles from the coast of England, and when every motive of moral prudence called for the discouragement of societies formed for the increase of popular pretensions to power and direction.  3. When the proceedings of this society of the Friends of the People, as well as others acting in the same spirit, had caused a very serious alarm in the mind of the Duke of Portland, and of many good patriots, he publicly, in the House of Commons, treated their apprehensions and conduct with the greatest asperity and ridicule. He condemned and vilified, in the most insulting and outrageous terms, the proclamation issued by government on that occasion,--though he well knew that it had passed through the Duke of Portland's hands, that it had received his fullest approbation, and that it was the result of an actual interview between that noble Duke and Mr. Pitt. During the discussion of its merits in the House of Commons, Mr. Fox countenanced and justified the chief promoters of that association; and he received, in return, a public assurance from them of an inviolable adherence to him singly and personally. On account of this proceeding, a very great number (I presume to say not the least grave and wise part) of the Duke of Portland's friends in Parliament, and many out of Parliament who are of the same description, have become separated from that time to this from Mr. Fox's particular cabal,--very few of which cabal are, or ever have, so much as pretended to be attached to the Duke of Portland, or to pay any respect to him or his opinions.  4. At the beginning of this session, when the sober part of the nation was a second time generally and justly alarmed at the progress of the French arms on the Continent, and at the spreading of their horrid principles and cabals in England, Mr. Fox did not (as had been usual in cases of far less moment) call together any meeting of the Duke of Portland's friends in the House of Commons, for the purpose of taking their opinion on the conduct to be pursued in Parliament at that critical juncture. He concerted his measures (if with any persons at all) with the friends of Lord Lansdowne, and those calling themselves Friends of the People, and others not in the smallest degree attached to the Duke of Portland; by which conduct he wilfully gave up (in my opinion) all pretensions to be considered as of that party, and much more to be considered as the leader and mouth of it in the House of Commons. This could not give much encouragement to those who had been separated from Mr. Fox, on account of his conduct on the first proclamation, to rejoin that party.  5. Not having consulted any of the Duke of Portland's party in the House of Commons,--and not having consulted them, because he had reason to know that the course he had resolved to pursue would be highly disagreeable to them,--he represented the alarm, which was a second time given and taken, in still more invidious colors than those in which he painted the alarms of the former year. He described those alarms in this manner, although the cause of them was then grown far less equivocal and far more urgent. He even went so far as to treat the supposition of the growth of a Jacobin spirit in England as a libel on the nation. As to the danger from _abroad_, on the first day of the session he said little or nothing upon the subject. He contented himself with defending the ruling factions in France, and with accusing the public councils of this kingdom of every sort of evil design on the liberties of the people,--declaring distinctly, strongly, and precisely, that the whole danger of the nation was from the growth of the power of the crown.
