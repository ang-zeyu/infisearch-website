This     was more than sufficient to enflame the lively imagination of Mr. D.     and to decide him to visit, in person, a country already explored by a     great number of his countrymen; but he conceived that his narrative     should embody other topics than those which ordinarily appeared in the     text of his predecessors.      \"His work then is not only a description of castles, towns, churches,     public monuments of every kind:--it is not only a representation of     the general aspect of the country, as to its picturesque     appearances--but it is an extended, minute, though occasionally     inexact, account of public and private libraries; with reflections     upon certain customs of the country, and upon the character of those     who inhabit it. It is in short the personal history of the author,     throughout the whole length of his journey. Not the smallest incident,     however indifferent, but what has a place in the letters of the     Bibliographer. Thus, he mentions every Inn where he stops: recommends     or scolds the landlord--according to his civility or exaction. Has the     author passed a bad night? the reader is sure to know it on the     following morning. On the other hand, has he had a good night's rest     in a comfortable bed? [dans un lit _comfortable_?] We are as sure to     know this also, as soon as he awakes:--and thus far we are relieved     from anxiety about the health of the traveller. Cold and heat--fine     weather and bad weather--every variation of atmosphere is scrupulously     recorded.  What immediately follows, is unworthy of M. Licquet; because it not only implies a charge of a heinous description--accusing me of an insidious intrusion into domestic circles, a violation of confidence, and a systematic derision of persons and things--but because the French translator, exercising that sense and shrewdness which usually distinguish him, MUST have known that such a charge _could_ not have been founded in FACT. He must have known that any gentleman, leaving England with those letters which brought me in contact with some of the first circles on the Continent, MUST have left it without leaving his character _behind_ him; and that such a character could not, in the natural order of things--seen even through the sensitive medium of a French critic--have been guilty of the grossness and improprieties imputed to me by M. Licquet. I treat therefore this \"damnation in wholesale\" with scorn and contempt: and hasten to impress the reader with a more favourable opinion of my Norman translator. He _will_ have it that      \"the English Traveller's imagination is lively and ardent--and his     spirit, that of raillery and lightness. He examines as he runs along;     that is to say, he does not give himself time to examine; he examines     ill; he deceives himself; and he subjects his readers to be deceived     with him. He traverses, at a hard trot, one of the most ancient towns     in France; puts his head out of his carriage window--and boldly     decides that the town is of the time of Francis I.\"![9] p. xviij.  There is pleasantry, and perhaps some little truth, in this vein of observation; and it had been better, perhaps, for the credit of the good taste and gentleman-like feeling of Mons. Licquet, if he had uniformly maintained his character in these respects. I have however, in the subsequent pages,[10] occasionally grappled with my annotator in proving the fallacy, or the want of charity, of many of his animadversions: and the reader probably may not be displeased, if, by way of \"avant propos,\" I indulge him here with a specimen of them--taken from his preface. M. Licquet says, that I \"create scenes; arrange a drama; trace characters; imagine a dialogue, frequently in French--and in what French--gracious God!--in assigning to postilions a ridiculous language, and to men of the world the language of postilions.\" These be sharp words:[11] but what does the Reader imagine may be the probable \"result\" of the English Traveller's inadvertencies?... A result, (\"gracious Heaven!\") very little anticipated by the author. Let him ponder well upon the awful language which ensues. \"What (says M. Licquet) will quickly be the result, with us, of such indiscretions as those of which M. Dibdin is guilty? The necessity of SHUTTING OUR PORTS, or at least of placing a GUARD UPON OUR LIPS!\" There is some consolation however left for me, in balancing this tremendous denunciation by M. Licquet's eulogy of my good qualities--which a natural diffidence impels me to quote in the original words of their author.      \"A Dieu ne plaise, toutefois, que j'accuse ici LE COEUR de M. Dibdin.     Je n'ai jamais eu l'honneur de le voir: je ne le connais que par ses     ecrits; principalement par son _Splendid Tour_, et je ne balance pas à     déclarer que l'auteur doit être doué d'une ame honnête, et de ces     qualités fondamentales qui constituent l'homme de bien. Il préfère sa     croyance; mais il respecte la croyance des autres; son érudition     parait....[12] variée. Son amour pour les antiquités est immense; et     par antiquités j'entends ici tout ce qui est _antique_ ou seulement     _ancien_, quellesque soient d'ailleurs la nature et la forme des     objets.\" Pref. p. xv. xvij.  Once more; and to conclude with M. Licquet. After these general observations upon the _Text_ of the Tour, M. Licquet favours us with the following--upon the _Plates_. \"These plates (says he) are intended to represent some of the principal monuments; the most beautiful landscapes, and the most remarkable persons, comprehending even the servants of an inn. If _talent_ be sought in these Engravings, it will doubtless be found in them; but strangers must not seek for _fidelity_ of representation from what is before their eyes. The greater number of the Designs are, in some sort, ideal compositions, which, by resembling every thing, resemble nothing in particular: and it is worthy of remark that the Artist, in imitation of the Author, seems to have thought that he had only to shew himself _clever_, without troubling himself to be _faithful_.\" To this, I reply in the very words of M. Licquet himself: \"the decision is severe; luckily it is unjust.\" The only portions of the designs of their skilful author, which may be taxed with a tendency to extravagance, are the _groups_: which, when accompanied by views of landscapes, or of monuments, are probably too profusely indulged in; but the _individuals_, constituting those groups, belong precisely to the _country_ in which they are represented. In the first and second volumes they are _French_; in the third they are _Germans_--all over. Will M. Licquet pretend to say that the churches, monasteries, streets, and buildings, with which the previous Edition of this Tour is so elaborately embellished, have the slightest tendency to IMAGINED SCENERY? If he do, his optics must be peculiarly his own. I have, in a subsequent page, (p. 34, note) slightly alluded to the cost and risk attendant on the Plates; but I may confidently affirm, from experience, that two thirds of the expense incurred would have secured the same sale at the same price. However, the die is cast; and the voice of lamentation is fruitless.  I now come to the consideration of M. Licquet's coadjutor, M. CRAPELET. Although the line of conduct pursued by that very singular gentleman be of an infinitely more crooked description than that of his Predecessor, yet, in this place, I shall observe less respecting it; inasmuch as, in the subsequent pages, (pp. 209, 245, 253, 400, &c.) the version and annotations of M. Crapelet have been somewhat minutely discussed. Upon the SPIRIT which could give rise to such a version, and such annotations, I will here only observe, that it very much resembles that of searchers of our street-pavements; who, with long nails, scrape out the dirt from the interstices of the stones, with the hope of making a discovery of some lost treasure which may compensate the toil of perseverance. The love of lucre may, or may not, have influenced my Parisian translator; but the love of discovery of latent error, and of exposure of venial transgression, has undoubtedly, from beginning to end, excited his zeal and perseverance. That carping spirit, which shuts its eyes upon what is liberal and kind, and withholds its assent to what is honourable and just, it is the distinguished lot--and, perhaps, as the translator may imagine, the distinguished felicity--of M. Crapelet to possess. Never was greater reluctance displayed in admitting even the palpable truths of a text, than what is displayed in the notes of M. Crapelet: and whenever a concurring sentiment comes from him, it seems to exude like his heart's life-blood. Having already answered, in detail, his separate publication confined to my 30th Letter[13]--(the 8th of the second volume, in _this_ edition) and having replied to those animadversions which appear in his translation of the whole of the second volume, in this edition--it remains here only to consign the Translator to the careful and impartial consideration of the Reader, who, it is requested, may be umpire between both parties. Not to admit that the text of this Edition is in many places improved, from the suggestions of my Translators, by corrections of \"Names of Persons, Places, and Things,\" would be to betray a stubbornness or obtuseness of feeling which certainly does not enter into the composition of its author.  I now turn, not without some little anxiety, yet not wholly divested of the hope of a favourable issue, to the character and object of the Edition HERE presented to the Public. It will be evident, at first glance, that it is greatly \"shorn of its beams\" in regard to graphic decorations and typographical splendour. Yet its garb, if less costly, is not made of coarse materials: for it has been the wish and aim of the Publishers, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16227"],["title","The Uses of Astronomy (#1)"],["body","England, but who could never lay aside the honors he had earned in the literature and science of geology.  After a few introductory observations, Prof. HITCHCOCK said:--       This, I believe, is the first example in which a State Government      in our country has erected a museum for the exhibition of its      natural resources, its mineral and rock, its plants and animals,      living and fossil. And this seems to me the most appropriate spot      in the country for placing the first geological hall erected by      the Government; for the County of Albany was the district where      the first geological survey was undertaken, on this side of the      Atlantic, and, perhaps, the world. This was in 1820, and ordered      by that eminent philanthropist, Stephen Van Rensselaer, who,      three years later, appointed Prof. Eaton to survey, in like      manner, the whole region traversed by the Erie Canal. This was      the commencement of a work, which, during the last thirty years,      has had a wonderful expansion, reaching a large part of the      States of the Union, as well as Canada, Nova Scotia, and New      Brunswick, and, I might add, several European countries, where      the magnificent surveys now in progress did not commence till      after the survey of Albany and Rensselaer Counties. How glad      are we, therefore, to find on this spot the first Museum of      Economical Geology on this side of the Atlantic! Nay, embracing      as it does all the department of Natural History, I see in it      more than a European Museum of Economical Geology, splendid      though they are. I fancy, rather, that I see here the germ of a      Cis-Atlantic British Museum, or Garden of Plants.       North Carolina was the first State that ordered a geological      survey; and I have the pleasure of seeing before me the gentleman      who executed it, and in 1824-5 published a report of 140 pages.      I refer to Professor Olmstead, who, though he has since won      brighter laurels in another department of science, will always be      honored as the first commissioned State geologist in our land.  Of the New York State Survey he said:--       This survey has developed the older fossiliferous rocks, with a      fullness and distinctness unknown elsewhere. Hence European      savans study the New York Reports with eagerness. In 1850, as I      entered the Woodwardian Museum, in the University of Cambridge,      in England, I found Professor McCoy busy with a collection of      Silurian fossils before him, which he was studying with Hall's      first volume of Paleontology as his guide; and in the splendid      volumes, entitled _British Paleozoric Rocks and Fossils_, which      appeared last year as the result of those researches, I find      Professor Hall denominated the great American Paleontologist. I      tell you, Sir, that this survey has given New York a reputation      throughout the learned world, of which she may well be proud. Am      I told that it will, probably, cost half a million? Very well.      The larger the sum, the higher will be the reputation of New      York for liberality; and what other half million expended in our      country, has developed so many new facts or thrown so much light      upon the history of the globe, or won so world-wide and enviable      a reputation?  And of Geological Surveys in general:--       In regard to this matter of geological surveys, I can hardly      avoid making a suggestion here. So large a portion of our country      has now been examined, more or less thoroughly, by the several      State governments, that it does seem to me the time has come      when the National government should order a survey--geological,      zoological, and botanical--of the whole country, on such a      liberal and thorough plan as the surveys in Great Britain are      now conducted; in the latter country it being understood that at      least thirty years will be occupied in the work. Could not the      distinguished New York statesman who was to have addressed us      to-day be induced, when the present great struggle in which he      is engaged shall have been brought to a close, by a merciful      Providence, to introduce this subject, and urge it upon Congress?      And would it not be appropriate for the American Association      for the Advancement of Science to throw a petition before the      government for such an object? Or might it not, with the consent      of the eminent gentleman who has charge of the Coast Survey, be      connected therewith, as it is with the Ordnance Survey in Great      Britain.  The history of the American Association was then given:--       Prof. Mather, I believe, through Prof. Emmons, first suggested to      the New-York Board of Geologists in November, 1838, in a letter      proposing a number of points for their consideration. I quote      from him the following paragraph relating to the meeting. As to      the credit he has here given me of having personally suggested      the subject, I can say only that I had been in the habit for      several years of making this meeting of scientific men a sort      of hobby in my correspondence with such. Whether others did the      same, I did not then, and do not now know. Were this the proper      place, I could go more into detail on this point; but I will      merely quote Prof. Mather's language to the Board:--         * * * * \"Would it not be well to suggest the propriety of a      meeting of Geologists and other scientific men of our country at      some central point next fall,--say at New-York or Philadelphia?      There are many questions in our Geology that will receive new      light from friendly discussion and the combined observations of      various individuals who have noted them in different parts of our      country. Such a meeting has been suggested by Prof. Hitchcock;      and to me it seems desirable. It would undoubtedly be an      advantage not only to science but to the several surveys that are      now in progress and that may in future be authorized. It would      tend to make known our scientific men to each other personally,      give them more confidence in each other, and cause them to      concentrate their observation on those questions that are of      interest in either a scientific or economical point of view. More      questions may be satisfactorily settled in a day by oral      discussion in such a body, than a year by writing and      publication.\"[A]       [Footnote A: In the letter alluded to, on examination, we      discover another passage bearing on the point, which, owing to      the Professor's modesty we suspect, he did not read. Prof. Mather      adds. \"You, so far as I know, first suggested the matter of such      an Association. I laid the matter before the Board of Geologists      of New-York, specifying some of the advantages that might be      expected to result; and Prof. Vanuxem probably made the motion      before the Board in regard to it.\"]       Though the Board adopted the plan of a meeting, various causes      delayed the first over till April, 1840, when we assembled in      Philadelphia, and spent a week in most profitable and pleasant      discussion, and the presentation of papers. Our number that year      was only 18, because confined almost exclusively to the State      geologists; but the next year, when we met again in Philadelphia,      and a more extended invitation was given, about eighty were      present; and the members have been increasing to the present      time. But, in fact, those first two meetings proved the type, in      all things essential, of all that have followed. The principal      changes have been those of expansion and the consequent      introduction of many other branches of science with their eminent      cultivators. In 1842, we changed the name to that of the      Association of American Geologists and Naturalists; and in 1847,      to that of the American Association for the Advancement of      Science. I trust it has not yet reached its fullest development,      as our country and its scientific men multiply, and new fields of      discovery open.  Prof. H. said of this particular occasion:--       We may be quite sure that this Hall will be a center of deep      interest to coming generations. Long after we shall have passed      away will the men of New-York, as they survey these monuments,      feel stimulated to engage in other noble enterprises by this      work of their progenitors, and from many a distant part of the      civilized world will men come here to solve their scientific      questions, and to bring far-off regions into comparison with      this. New-York, then, by her liberal patronage, has not only      acquired an honorable name among those living in all civilized      lands, but has secured the voice of History to transmit her fame      to far-off generations.                 SIR WILLIAM LOGAN ASKS \"THE WAY TO ALBANY.\"  Sir WILLIAM E. LOGAN, of Canada, in a brief speech acknowledged the services rendered by the New-York Survey to Canada. He should manifest ingratitude if he declined to unite in the joyful occasion of inaugurating the Museum which was to hold forever the evidence of the truth of its published results. The Survey of Canada had been ordered, and the Commission of five years twice renewed; and the last time, the provision for it was more than doubled. It happened to him, as Mr. Agassiz had said: after crossing the ocean first, the first thing he asked was, \"Which is the way to Albany?\" and when he arrived here, he found that with the aid of Prof. Hall's discoveries, he had only to take up the different formations as he had left them on the boundary line, and follow them into Canada. It was both a convenience and a necessity to adopt the New-York nomenclature, which was thus extended over an area six times as large as New-York. In Paris he heard De Vernier using"]]]
