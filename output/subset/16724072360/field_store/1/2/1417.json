Then silence and utter stillness only, and the cold, calm moon staring down over all.  Gulo picked himself up after a bit, and slouched round the tree to investigate.  He found tracks there, and blood; and the tracks were the biggest footprints of a bear--a brown bear--that he had ever come across, and I suppose that he must have sniffed at a few in his time.  Presumably the man had fired at the bear when the startled horse shied. Presumably, too, the bear was hit.  He had gone straight away in the track of horse and man, anyway, and--he had saved the wolverine's life, after, with paw and teeth, doing his best to end it.  Possibly he had been disturbed in the process of making his winter home.  Gulo lay low, or hunted very furtively, after that for some time, until it was little less dark in the east than it had been, and the gaunt tree-trunks were standing out a fraction from the general gloom.  The moon had apparently nearly burnt itself out.  Still, it yet appeared to be night.  Gulo was a long way out of his own hunting-district, and guessed that it was about time for him to get himself out of sight.  He had a passionate hatred of the day, by the way, even beyond most night hunters.  On the way he smelt out and dug up a grouse beneath the snow.  Dawn found him, or, rather, failed to find him, hidden under a tangled mass that was part windfall, part brush-wood, and part snow.  The place had belonged to a fox the night before, and that red worthy returned soon after dawn.  He thrust an inquiring sharp muzzle inside, took one sniff, and, with every hair alift, retired in haste, without waiting to hear the villainous growl that followed him.  The smell was enough for him--a most calamitous stink.  It snowed all that day, and things grew quieter and quieter, except in the tree-tops, where the wind spoke viciously between its teeth.  When Gulo came out that evening, he had to dig part of the way, and he viewed a still and silent, white world, under a sky like the lid of a lead box, very low down.  He stood higher against the tree-trunks than he had done the night before, and, though he did not know it, was safe from any horse, for the snow was quite deep.  The cold was awful, but it did not seem to trouble him, as he slouched slowly southward.  There appeared to be nothing alive at all throughout this white land, but you must never trust to that in the wild.  Things there are very rarely what they seem.  For instance, Gulo came into a clearing, dim under the night sky, though it would never be dark that night.  To the ear and the eye that clearing was as empty as a swept room.  To Gulo's nose it was not, and he was just about to crouch and execute a stalk, when half the snow seemed to get up and run away.  The runners were wood-hares.  They had \"frozen\" stiff on the alarm from their sentries. But it was not Gulo who had caused them to depart.  Him, behind a tree, they had not spotted.  Something remained--something that moved.  And Gulo saw it when it moved--not before.  It was an ermine, a stoat in winter dress, white as driven snow.  Then it caught sight of Gulo, or, more likely, the gleam of his eyes, and departed also.  Gulo slouched on, head down, back humped, tail low, a most dejected-looking, out-at-heels tramp of the wilderness.  Once he came upon a wild cat laying scientific siege to a party of grouse.  The grouse were nowhere to be seen; nor was the wild cat, after Gulo announced his intention to break his neutrality.  Gulo knew where the grouse were.  He dug down into the snow, and came upon a tunnel.  He dug farther, and came upon other tunnels, round and clean, in the snow.  All the tunnels smelt of grouse, but devil a grouse could he find.  He had come a bit early.  It was as yet barely night, and he should have waited till later, when they would be more asleep. However, he dug on along the tunnels, driving the grouse before him. And then a strange thing happened.  About three yards ahead of him the snow burst--burst, I say, like a six-inch shell, upwards.  There was a terrific commotion, a wild, whirring, whirling smother, a cloud of white, and away went five birds, upon heavily beating wings, into the gathering gloom.  Gulo went away, too, growling deep down inside of, and to, himself.  He was hungry, was Gulo.  Indeed, there did not seem to be many times when he was not hungry.  Also, being angry--not even a wild animal likes failure--he was seeking a sacrifice; but he had crossed the plain, which the night before had been as a nightmare desert to him, and the moon was up before his chance came.  He crossed the trail of the reindeer.  He did not know anything about those reindeer, mark you, whether they were wild or semi-tame; and _I_ do not know, though _he_ may have done, how old the trail was.  It was sufficient for him that they _were_ reindeer, and that they had traveled in the general direction that he wanted to go.  For the rest--he had the patience, perhaps more than the patience, of a cat, the determination of a bulldog, and the nose of a bloodhound.  He trailed those reindeer the better part of that night, and most of the time it snowed, and part of the time it snowed hard.  By the time a pale, frozen dawn crept weakly over the forest tree-tops Gulo must have been well up on the trail of that herd, and he had certainly traveled an astonishing way.  He had dug up one lemming--a sort of square-ended relation of the rat, with an abbreviated tail--and pounced upon one pigmy owl, scarce as large as a thrush, which he did not seem to relish much--perhaps owl is an acquired taste--before he turned a wild cat out of its lair--to the accompaniment of a whole young riot of spitting and swearing--and curled up for the day.  He was hungry when he went to sleep.  Also, it was snowing then.  When he woke up it was almost dark, and snowing worse than ever.  If it could have been colder, it was.  While he cleaned himself Gulo took stock of the outside prospect, so far as the white curtain allowed to sight, and by scent a good deal that it did not.  This without appearing outside the den, you understand.  And if there had been any enemy in hiding, waiting for him outside, he would have discovered the fact then.  He had many enemies, and no friends, had Gulo.  All that he received from all whom he met was hate, but he gave back more than he got.  In the lucid terms of the vernacular, he \"was a hard un, if you like.\"  Nothing and nobody saw the wolverine leave that lair that was not his. He must have chosen one blinding squall of snow for the purpose, and was half a mile away, still on the track of the reindeer, before he showed himself--shuffling along as usual, a ragged, hard-bitten ruffian.  And three hours later he came up with his prey.  Gulo knew it, but nobody else could have done.  There were just the straight trees ahead, and all around the eternal white, frozen silence, and the snow falling softly over everything; but Gulo was as certain that there was the herd close ahead as he was that he was ravenous. And thereafter Gulo got to work, the peculiar work, a special devilish genius for which appears to be given to the wolverine.  He ceased to exist.  At least, nothing of him was seen, not a tail, not an eye-gleam.  Yet during the next two hours he learnt everything, private and public, there was to be learnt.  Also, he had been over the surroundings almost to a yard.  Nothing could have escaped him.  No detail of risk and danger, of the chance of being seen even, had been overlooked; for he was a master at his craft, the greatest master in the wild, perhaps.  The wolf?  My dear sirs, the wolf was an innocent suckling cub beside Gulo, look you, and his brain and his cunning were not the brain and the cunning of a beast at all, but of a devil.  When, after a very long time, he reappeared upon his original track, it was as a dark blotch, indistinguishable from a dozen other dark blots of moon-shadow, creeping forward belly-flat in the snow.  This belly-creep, hugging always every available inch of cover, he kept up till he came to a big clearing, and--there were the reindeer.  At least, there was one reindeer, a doe, standing with her back towards him--a quite young doe.  The rest were half-hidden in the snow, which they had trampled into a maze of paths in and out about the clearing, which was, in fact, what is called their \"yard.\"  A minute of tense silence followed after Gulo had got as close as he could without being seen.  Then he rushed.  The reindeer swung half-round, gave one snort, and a great bound.  But Gulo had covered half the intervening space before she knew, and when she bounded it was with him hanging on to her.  Followed instantly a wild upspringing of snorting beasts, and a mad, senseless stampede of floundering deer all round and about the clearing--a fearful mix-up, somewhere in the midst of which, half-hidden by flying, finely powdered snow, Gulo did his prey horribly to death.  There was something ghastly about this murder, for the deer was so big, and Gulo comparatively small.  The fearful work of his jaws and his immense strength seemed wrong somehow, and out of all proportion to his size.  This remarkable power of his jaws had that sinister disproportion only paralleled by the power of the jaws of a hyena; indeed, his teeth very much resembled a hyena's teeth.  With the deer rushing all around him, Gulo fed, ravenously and horribly, but not for long.  A new light smoldered in his eyes now as he lifted his carmine snout, and one saw that, for the moment, the beast was mad, crazed with the lust of killing, seeing red, and blinded by blood.  Then the massacre began.

In connection with the harmony lessons, we use as a text-book \"Clarke's Harmony,\"[A] and the student is required to master the first two chapters and prepare manuscripts upon each of the lessons. Below is a number of the most important questions selected from those lessons upon which manuscripts have been written:       1. Every white key on the piano represents an \"absolute pitch.\"      By what names are these pitches known? How are the black keys      named?       2. How many tones constitute the diatonic scale? Give numerical      names.       3. Intervals are measured by steps and half-steps. How many steps      from 1 to 3 in the diatonic scale? 1 to 4? 1 to 5? 3 to 5? 5 to      8? 1 to 8?       4. Why is there no black key between E and F, and between B and      C?       5. From 1 to 3 is called an interval of a third; from 3 to 5,      also a third; from 1 to 5, a fifth: they are so called because      they include, respectively, three and five members of the      diatonic scale. What is the interval 3 to 6? 2 to 5? 5 to 8? 2 to      6? 1 to 8?       6. Thirds are of two kinds: major (larger) thirds embrace two      whole-steps; minor (smaller) thirds embrace a step and a half.      What kind of a third is 1-3 in the diatonic scale? 2-4? 3-5? 6-8?       7. What do we mean by the term, Fundamental of a chord? What is      added to it to complete the common chord?       8. What absolute pitches comprise the common chord of C? What      kind of interval between the first two members? What between the      first and last? What between the second and last?       9. What tones would you use if told to strike the common chord of      C in four-part, close harmony, using the fundamental for the      highest tone?       10. How many keys (white and black) are there between the      fundamental and the third? How many between the third and the      fifth? How many between the fundamental and the fifth when the      fifth is played above the fundamental?       11. How many keys (white and black) are there between two keys      comprising a perfect fourth?       12. (Most important of all.) What keys of the piano keyboard      comprise the common chord founded upon G as the fundamental? Upon      F? Upon F♯? Upon G♯? Upon B♭? Upon D♭? Upon E♭? Upon D? Upon E?      Upon A? Upon B?

LESSON II.  ~GENERAL CONSTRUCTION OF THE PIANO; SOMETHING OF ITS EVOLUTION AND HISTORY.~   The piano of today is, unquestionably, the most perfect, and consequently the most popular and beloved of all musical instruments.      That enchanting Queen of the home,       Whose place in the hearts of the family     Is as dear as though it could speak       In words of joy and sorrow,     Sadness or consolation;       Soothing, animating, enrapturing,     Charming away the soul       From its worldly weight of cares,     And wafting it softly       Into the realm of celestial dreams.  The untiring efforts of genius for over a century have succeeded in producing a musical instrument that falls little short of perfection. Yet other inventions and improvements are sure to come, for we are never content with \"good enough.\"  The student of these lessons may, in his practice, discover defective mechanical action and by his ingenuity be able to improve it; he may likewise see where an improvement can be made in acoustic construction; where a better scale can be drawn; or where different and perhaps new materials may be used for the component parts of the instrument. The possibilities are numerous along these lines, and in addition to bestowing a favor upon the general public, the man who has the originality to produce something new, places himself beyond want.  The inevitable inference is that the piano is an evolution of the harp principle. This instrument was known centuries previous to the Christian era. From the best history obtainable, we learn that about three hundred years ago, the first effort was made to interpose a mechanical contrivance between the performer and the strings whereby it would only be necessary to strike the keys to produce tone from the strings, thereby decreasing the difficulty in finding the strings and picking them with the fingers, and greatly increasing the possibilities in musical rendition.  History gives credit to Italy for the first productions of this kind, about 1600 A.D., when the faculty of music was beginning to manifest itself more boldly. Scientists saw that wonderful developments were possible, and we have reason to believe that experiments were made in England, France, Germany and all civilized countries about this time, for the production of the instrument which we call, in this day, a Pianoforte. (_Piano e forte_: soft and loud.)  At this time communication between the different countries was, of course, slow and uncertain, and experiments of this kind were probably unknown outside of the immediate neighborhood in which they were tried; therefore, much valuable and interesting history has not come to light. However, from the specimens which we have had the pleasure of seeing, and some of which we have had the opportunity to work on, we infer that about the same line of difficulties presented themselves to all of these early experimenters, most of which were not efficiently overcome until in the last century, and the most important of which it fell to the lot of American inventors to overcome.  Some of these early instruments were not even provided with dampers for stopping the tone when the key was released; consequently, when a number of keys were struck in succession, the tone continued from all, so long as the strings would vibrate. The strings and sound-board being very light, the sustaining qualities were meager compared to those of the modern piano; consequently the dampers were not so much missed as they would be if removed from a modern upright or grand, which would surely render them unfit for use.  In the first attempts at piano building, the difficulties to be overcome may be enumerated as follows: The frames were not strong enough to resist the tension of the strings; they were made almost entirely of wood which yields to the pull of the strings and is subject to climatic changes; the scale was very imperfect, that is, the length, tension and weight of the strings were not properly proportioned, the result being a different quality of tone from different portions of the keyboard; the actions were either heavy and imperfect, or too light to produce sufficient vibration; the proper point upon the strings for the hammers to strike and for the dampers to bear had not yet been ascertained; the preparation and seasoning of the wood for the different parts of the instrument had not received sufficient attention.  One cannot conceive how difficult it is to produce something that has never existed, until he tries. The requirements necessary to such results as are obtainable from the modern piano are numerous and rigid and the result of many costly experiments.  Probably the most important essential in piano building is the production of a frame of such strength and stability that the enormous tension of the strings is completely resisted in all parts of the scale. In many of the cheaper pianos of this day, the lack of this essential manifests itself in an annoying degree to the piano tuner. In tuning, the workman \"brings up\" his temperament in the middle of the instrument; in most cases the temperament stands all right. He next tunes the treble, then the bass; after doing his work perfectly he will often find that the treble fell somewhat while he was bringing up the bass; or, in a few cases, he may find that the treble sharpened, thus showing that there was yielding of the frame. Of course, this defect might be overcome by using an extremely heavy metal plate and wooden frame; but the commercial side of the question, in this day, calls for lightness in the instrument as a check to the expense of production, and, consequently, pianos that are \"made to sell\" are often much too light to fulfil this requirement.  In the upright piano, the back frame of wood is first made; at the top of this is the pin-block, sometimes called the wrest-plank. This is composed of several layers of wood firmly glued together with the grain running in different directions to prevent splitting and warping. Into this plank the tuning pins are driven. The sound-board is fitted firmly into this frame of wood below the pin-block.  Next, the strong metal plate is secured to the frame by large bolts and screws. Openings are left in the plate for the bridges, which project from the sound-board beyond the metal plate; also for the tuning pins, action bracket bolts, etc.  At the lower end of the plate, and just below the bridges,[B] the hitchpins are driven firmly into holes drilled to receive them. Their purpose is to support the lower ends of the strings. The bass strings are separate, and each has a loop with which to fasten it to the hitchpin. In the treble, one piece of wire forms two strings; the two ends are secured to the tuning pins above, and the string is simply brought around the hitchpin. The bridges communicating with the sound-board are at the lower end of the sound-board. Notice, there is a portion of the length of each string between the bridge and the hitchpin.      [B] There are two sections of the lower bridge, one for the treble     and one for the overstrung bass.  [Illustration]  At the upper end of the strings, a \"bearing-bar,\" situated between the tuning pins and upper bridge, is attached to the pin-block by screws which draw it inward; its function is"]]]
