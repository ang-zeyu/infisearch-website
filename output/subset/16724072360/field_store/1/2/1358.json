In spite of all this, some head-strong native princes never relinquished the hope of freedom, and no sooner had they made good the breaches in their walls as far as they were able, than they entered once more on this unequal contest, though at the risk of bringing irreparable disaster on their country. The majority of them, after one such struggle, resigned themselves to the inevitable, and fulfilled their feudal obligations regularly. They paid their fixed contribution, furnished rations and stores to the army when passing through their territory, and informed the ministers at Thebes of any intrigues among their neighbours.* Years elapsed before they could so far forget the failure of their first attempt to regain independence, as to venture to make a second, and expose themselves to fresh reverses.  The administration of so vast an empire entailed but a small expenditure on the Egyptians, and required the offices of merely a few functionaries.** The garrisons which they kept up in foreign provinces lived on the country, and were composed mainly of light troops, archers, a certain proportion of heavy infantry, and a few minor detachments of chariotry dispersed among the principal fortresses.***       * We find in the _Annals_, in addition to the enumeration of      the tributes, the mention of the foraging arrangements which      the chiefs were compelled to make for the army on its      passage. We find among the tablets letters from Aziru      denouncing the intrigues of the Khâti; letters also of      Ribaddu pointing out the misdeeds of Abdashirti, and other      communications of the same nature, which demonstrate the      supervision exercised by the petty Syrian princes over each      other.       ** Under Thûtmosis III. we have among others Mir, or Nasi      sîtû mihâtîtû, governors of the northern countries, the      Thûtîi who became afterwards a hero of romance. The      individuals who bore this title held a middle rank in the      Egyptian hierarchy.       *** The archers--_pidâtid, pidâti, pidâte_--and the      chariotry quartered in Syria are often mentioned in the Tel      el-Amarna correspondence. Steindorff has recognised the term      -ddû aûîtû, meaning infantry, in the word ûeû, ûiû, of the      Tel el-Amarna tablets.  The officers in command had orders to interfere as little as possible in local affairs, and to leave the natives to dispute or even to fight among themselves unhindered, so long as their quarrels did not threaten the security of the Pharaoh.* It was never part of the policy of Egypt to insist on her foreign subjects keeping an unbroken peace among themselves. If, theoretically, she did not recognise the right of private warfare, she at all events tolerated its practice. It mattered little to her whether some particular province passed out of the possession of a certain Eibaddû into that of a certain Azîru, or _vice versa_, so long as both Eibaddû and Azîru remained her faithful slaves. She never sought to repress their incessant quarrelling until such time as it threatened to take the form of an insurrection against her own power. Then alone did she throw off her neutrality; taking the side of one or other of the dissentients, she would grant him, as a pledge of help, ten, twenty, thirty, or even more archers.**       * A half at least of the Tel el-Amarna correspondence treats      of provincial wars between the kings of towns and countries      subject to Egypt--wars of Abdashirti and his son Azîru      against the cities of the Phoenician coast, wars of      Abdikhiba, or Abdi-Tabba, King of Jerusalem, against the      chiefs of the neighbouring cities.       ** Abimilki (Abisharri) demands on one occasion from the      King of Egypt ten men to defend Tyre, on another occasion      twenty; the town of Gula requisitioned thirty or forty to      guard it. Delattre thinks that these are rhetorical      expressions answering to a general word, just as if we      should say a handful of men; the difference of value in      the figures is to me a proof of their reality.  No doubt the discipline and personal courage of these veterans exercised a certain influence on the turn of events, but they were after all a mere handful of men, and their individual action in the combat would scarcely ever have been sufficient to decide the result; the actual importance of their support, in spite of their numerical inferiority, lay in the moral weight they brought to the side on which they fought, since they represented the whole army of the Pharaoh which lay behind them, and their presence in a camp always ensured final success. The vanquished party had the right of appeal to the sovereign, through whom he might obtain a mitigation of the lot which his successful adversary had prepared for him; it was to the interest of Egypt to keep the balance of power as evenly as possible between the various states which looked to her, and when she prevented one or other of the princes from completely crushing his rivals, she was minimising the danger which might soon arise from the vassal whom she had allowed to extend his territory at the expense of others.  These relations gave rise to a perpetual exchange of letters and petitions between the court of Thebes and the northern and southern provinces, in which all the petty kings of Africa and Asia, of whatever colour or race, set forth, either openly or covertly, their ambitions and their fears, imploring a favour or begging for a subsidy, revealing the real or suspected intrigues of their fellow-chiefs, and while loudly proclaiming their own loyalty, denouncing the perfidy and the secret projects of their neighbours. As the Ethiopian peoples did not, apparently, possess an alphabet of their own, half of the correspondence which concerned them was carried on in Egyptian, and written on papyrus. In Syria, however, where Babylonian civilization maintained itself in spite of its conquest by Thûtmosis, cuneiform writing was still employed, and tablets of dried clay.* It had, therefore, been found necessary to establish in the Pharaohs palace a department for this service, in which the scribes should be competent to decipher the Chaldæan character. Dictionaries and easy mythological texts had been procured for their instruction, by means of which they had learned the meaning of words and the construction of sentences. Having once mastered the mechanism of the syllabary, they set to work to translate the despatches, marking on the back of each the date and the place from whence it came, and if necessary making a draft of the reply.** In these the Pharaoh does not appear, as a rule, to have insisted on the endless titles which we find so lavishly used in his inscriptions, but the shortened protocol employed shows that the theory of his divinity was as fully acknowledged by strangers as it was by his own subjects. They greet him as their sun, the god before whom they prostrate themselves seven times seven, while they are his slaves, his dogs, and the dust beneath his feet.***       * A discovery made by the fellahîn, in 1887, at Tel el-      Arnarna, in the rums of the palace of Khûniaton, brought to      light a portion of the correspondence between Asiatic      monarchs, whether vassals or independent of Egypt, with the      officers of Amenôthes III. and IV., and with these Pharaohs      themselves.       ** Several of these registrations are still to be read on      the backs of the tablets at Berlin, London, and Gîzeh.       ***The protocols of the letters of Abdashirti may be taken      as an example, or those of Abimilki to Pharaoh, sometimes      there is a development of the protocol which assumes      panegyrical features similar to those met with in Egypt.  The runners to whom these documents were entrusted, and who delivered them with their own hand, were not, as a rule, persons of any consideration; but for missions of grave importance the kings messengers were employed, whose functions in time became extended to a remarkable degree. Those who were restricted to a limited sphere of activity were called the kings messengers for the regions of the south, or the kings messengers for the regions of the north,  according to their proficiency in the idiom and customs of Africa or of Asia. Others were deemed capable of undertaking missions wherever they might be required, and were, therefore, designated by the bold title of the kings messengers for all lands. In this case extended powers were conferred upon them, and they were permitted to cut short the disputes between two cities in some province they had to inspect, to excuse from tribute, to receive presents and hostages, and even princesses destined for the harem of the Pharaoh, and also to grant the support of troops to such as could give adequate reason for seeking it.* Their tasks were always of a delicate and not infrequently of a perilous nature, and constantly exposed them to the danger of being robbed by highwaymen or maltreated by some insubordinate vassal, at times even running the risk of mutilation or assassination by the way.**       * The Tel el-Amarna correspondence shows the messengers in      the time of Amenôthes III. and IV. as receiving tribute, as      bringing an army to the succour of a chief in difficulties,      as threatening with the anger of the Pharaoh the princes o£      doubtful loyalty, as giving to a faithful vassal compliments      and honours from his suzerain, as charged with the      conveyance of a gift of slaves, or of escorting a princess      to the harem of the Pharaoh.       ** A letter of Ribaddu, in the time of Amenôthes III.,      represents a royal messenger as blockaded in By bios by the      rebels.  They were obliged to brave the dangers of the forests of Lebanon and of the Taurus, the solitudes of Mesopotamia, the marshes of Chaldoa, the voyages to Pûanît and Asia Minor."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17326"],["title","History of Egypt, Chaldæa, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 6 (of 12) (#1)"],["body","in more bands, the whole being finally covered with a shroud of coarse canvas and a red linen winding-sheet, sewn together at the back, and kept in place by transverse bands disposed at intervals from head to foot. The son of the deceased and a man of the roll were present at this lugubrious toilet, and recited at the application of each piece a prayer, in which its object was defined and its duration secured. Every Egyptian was supposed to be acquainted with the formulas, from having learned them during his lifetime, by which he was to have restored to him the use of his limbs, and be protected from the dangers of the world beyond. These were repeated to the dead person, however, for greater security, during the process of embalming, and the son of the deceased, or the master of the ceremonies, took care to whisper to the mummy the most mysterious parts, which no living ear might hear with impunity. The wrappings having been completed, the deceased person became aware of his equipment, and enjoyed all the privileges of the instructed and fortified Manes. He felt himself, both mummy and double, now ready for the tomb.  Egyptian funerals were not like those to which we are accustomed--mute ceremonies, in which sorrow is barely expressed by a furtive tear: noise, sobbings, and wild gestures were their necessary concomitants. Not only was it customary to hire weeping women, who tore their hair, filled the air with their lamentations, and simulated by skilful actions the depths of despair, but the relatives and friends themselves did not shrink from making an outward show of their grief, nor from disturbing the equanimity of the passers-by by the immoderate expressions of their sorrow. One after another they raised their voices, and uttered some expression appropriate to the occasion: To the West, the dwelling of Osiris, to the West, thou who wast the best of men, and who always hated guile. And the hired weepers answered in chorus: O chief,* as thou goest to the West, the gods themselves lament. The funeral _cortege_ started in the morning from the house of mourning, and proceeded at a slow pace to the Nile, amid the clamours of the mourners.       * The chief is one of the names of Osiris, and is applied      naturally to the dead person, who has become an Osiris by      virtue of the embalming.  The route was cleared by a number of slaves and retainers. First came those who carried cakes and flowers in their hands, followed by others bearing jars full of water, bottles of liqueurs, and phials of perfumes; then came those who carried painted boxes intended for the provisions of the dead man, and for containing the Ushabtiu, or Respondents. The succeeding group bore the usual furniture required by the deceased to set up house again, coffers for linen, folding and arm chairs, state-beds, and sometimes even a caparisoned chariot with its quivers. Then came a groom conducting two of his late masters favourite horses, who, having accompanied the funeral to the tomb, were brought back to their stable. Another detachment, more numerous than the others combined, now filed past, bearing the effects of the mummy; first the vessels for the libations, then the cases for the Canopic jars, then the Canopic jars themselves, the mask of the deceased, coloured half in gold and half in blue, arms, sceptres, military batons, necklaces, scarabs, vultures with encircling wings worn on the breast at festival-times, chains, Respondents, and the human-headed sparrow-hawk, the emblem of the soul. Many of these objects were of wood plated with gold, others of the same material simply gilt, and others of solid gold, and thus calculated to excite the cupidity of the crowd. Offerings came next, then a noisy company of female weepers; then a slave, who sprinkled at every instant some milk upon the ground as if to lay the dust; then a master of the ceremonies, who, the panther skin upon his shoulder, asperged the crowd with perfumed water; and behind him comes the hearse.

The latter, according to custom, was made in the form of a boat--representing the bark of Osiris, with his ark, and two guardians, Isis and Nephthys--and was placed upon a sledge, which was drawn by a team of oxen and a relay of fellahîn. The sides of the ark were, as a rule, formed of movable wooden panels, decorated with pictures and inscriptions; sometimes, however, but more rarely, the panels were replaced by a covering of embroidered stuff or of soft leather. In the latter case the decoration was singularly rich, the figures and hieroglyphs being cut out with a knife, and the spaces thus left filled in with pieces of coloured leather, which gave the whole an appearance of brilliant mosaic-work.*       * One of these coverings was found in the hiding-place at      Deîr el-Baharî; it had belonged to the Princess Isîmkhobiû,      whose mummy is now at Gîzeh.  [Illustration: 013.jpg THE FUNERAL OF HABMHABÎ]       Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from the coloured print in      Wilkinson. The left side of this design fits on to the right      of the preceding cut.  In place of a boat, a shrine of painted wood, also mounted upon a sledge, was frequently used. When the ceremony was over, this was left, together with the coffin, in the tomb.*       * I found in the tomb of Sonnozmû two of these sledges with      the superstructure in the form of a temple. They are now in      the Gîzeh Museum.  The wife and children walked as close to the bier as possible, and were followed by the friends of the deceased, dressed in long linen garments,* each of them bearing a wand. The ox-driver, while goading his beasts, cried out to them: To the West, ye oxen who draw the hearse, to the West! Your master comes behind you! To the West, the friends repeated; the excellent man lives no longer who loved truth so dearly and hated lying!**       ** The whole of this description is taken from the pictures      representing the interment of a certain Harmhabî, who died      at Thebes in the time of Thfitmosis IV.       * These expressions are taken from the inscriptions on the      tomb of Rai  [Illustration: 014.jpg THE BOAT CARRYING THE MUMMY]       Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from pictures in the tomb of      Nofirhotpû at Thebes.  This lamentation is neither remarkable for its originality nor for its depth of feeling. Sorrow was expressed on such occasions in prescribed formulas of always the same import, custom soon enabling each individual to compose for himself a repertory of monotonous exclamations of condolence, of which the prayer, To the West! formed the basis, relieved at intervals by some fresh epithet. The nearest relatives of the deceased, however, would find some more sincere expressions of grief, and some more touching appeals with which to break in upon the commonplaces of the conventional theme. On reaching the bank of the Nile the funeral cortege proceeded to embark.*       * The description of this second part of the funeral      arrangements is taken from the tomb of Harmhabî, and      especially from that of Nofirhotpû.

They blended with their inarticulate cries, and the usual protestations and formulas, an eulogy upon the deceased and his virtues, allusions to his disposition and deeds, mention of the offices and honours he had obtained, and reflections on the uncertainty of human life--the whole forming the melancholy dirge which each generation intoned over its predecessor, while waiting itself for the same office to be said over it in its turn.  The bearers of offerings, friends, and slaves passed over on hired barges, whose cabins, covered externally with embroidered stuffs of several colours, or with _applique_ leather, looked like the pedestals of a monument: crammed together on the boats, they stood upright with their faces turned towards the funeral bark. The latter was supposed to represent the Noshemît, the mysterious skiff of Abydos, which had been used in the obsequies of Osiris of yore.  [Illustration: 016.jpg THE BOATS CONTAINING THE FRIENDS AND THE FUNERARY FURNITURE]       Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from paintings on the tomb of      Nofirhotpû at Thebes.  It was elegant, light, and slender in shape, and ornamented at bow and stern with a lotus-flower of metal, which bent back its head gracefully, as if bowed down by its own weight. A temple-shaped shrine stood in the middle of the boat, adorned with bouquets of flowers and with green palm-branches. The female members of the family of the deceased, crouched beside the shrine, poured forth lamentations, while two priestesses, representing respectively Isis and Nephthys, took up positions behind to protect the body. The boat containing the female mourners having taken the funeral barge in tow, the entire flotilla pushed out into the stream. This was the solemn moment of the ceremony--the moment in which the deceased, torn away from his earthly city, was about to set out upon that voyage from which there is no return. The crowds assembled on the banks of the river hailed the dead with their parting prayers: Mayest thou reach in peace the West from Thebes! In peace, in peace towards Abydos, mayest thou descend in peace towards Abydos, towards the sea of the West!  [Illustration: 017.jpg A CORNER OF THE THEBAN NECROPOLIS]       Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a stele in the Gîzeh Museum.  This crossing of the Nile was of special significance in regard to the future of the soul of the deceased: it represented his pilgrimage towards Abydos, to the Mouth of the Cleft which gave him access to the other world, and it was for this reason that the name "]]]
