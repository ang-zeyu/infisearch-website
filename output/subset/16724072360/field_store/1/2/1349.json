The very people who put it    down have become, as Karl Marx used to say, its testamentary    executors.  Louis Napoleon had to create an independent and united    Italy, Bismarck had to revolutionise Germany and to restore Hungarian    independence, and the English manufacturers had to enact the People's    Charter.     \"For England, the effects of this domination of the manufacturing    capitalists were at first startling.  Trade revived and extended to a    degree unheard of even in this cradle of modern industry; the previous    astounding creations of steam and machinery dwindled into nothing    compared with the immense mass of productions of the twenty years from    1850 to 1870, with the overwhelming figures of exports and imports, of    wealth accumulated in the hands of capitalists and of human working    power concentrated in the large towns.  The progress was indeed    interrupted, as before, by a crisis every ten years, in 1857 as well    as in 1866; but these revulsions were now considered as natural,    inevitable events, which must be fatalistically submitted to, and    which always set themselves right in the end.     \"And the condition of the working-class during this period?  There was    temporary improvement even for the great mass.  But this improvement    always was reduced to the old level by the influx of the great body of    the unemployed reserve, by the constant superseding of bands by new    machinery, by the immigration of the agricultural population, now,    too, more and more superseded by machines.     \"A permanent improvement can be recognised for two 'protected'    sections only of the working-class.  Firstly, the factory hands.  The    fixing by Act of Parliament of their working-day within relatively    rational limits has restored their physical constitution and endowed    them with a moral superiority, enhanced by their local concentration.    They are undoubtedly better off than before 1848.  The best proof is    that, out of ten strikes they make, nine are provoked by the    manufacturers in their own interests, as the only means of securing a    reduced production.  You can never get the masters to agree to work    'short time,' let manufactured goods be ever so unsaleable; but get    the workpeople to strike, and the masters shut their factories to a    man.     \"Secondly, the great Trades' Unions.  They are the organisations of    those trades in which the labour of _grown-up men_ predominates, or is    alone applicable.  Here the competition neither of women and children    nor of machinery has so far weakened their organised strength.  The    engineers, the carpenters, and joiners, the bricklayers, are each of    them a power, to that extent that, as in the case of the bricklayers    and bricklayers' labourers, they can even successfully resist the    introduction of machinery.  That their condition has remarkably    improved since 1848 there can be no doubt, and the best proof of this    is in the fact, that for more than fifteen years not only have their    employers been with them, but they with their employers, upon    exceedingly good terms.  They form an aristocracy among the working-    class; they have succeeded in enforcing for themselves a relatively    comfortable position, and they accept it as final.  They are the model    working-men of Messrs. Leone Levi & Giffen, and they are very nice    people indeed nowadays to deal with, for any sensible capitalist in    particular and for the whole capitalist class in general.     \"But as to the great mass of working-people, the state of misery and    insecurity in which they live now is as low as ever, if not lower.  The    East End of London is an everspreading pool of stagnant misery and    desolation, of starvation when out of work, and degradation, physical    and moral, when in work.  And so in all other large towns--abstraction    made of the privileged minority of the workers; and so in the smaller    towns and in the agricultural districts.  The law which reduces the    _value_ of labour-power to the value of the necessary means of    subsistence, and the other law which reduces its _average price_, as a    rule, to the minimum of those means of subsistence, these laws act    upon them with the irresistible force of an automatic engine, which    crushes them between its wheels.     \"This, then, was the position created by the Free Trade policy of    1847, and by twenty years of the rule of the manufacturing    capitalists.  But, then, a change came.  The crash of 1866 was,    indeed, followed by a slight and short revival about 1873; but that    did not last.  We did not, indeed, pass through the full crisis at the    time it was due, in 1877 or 1878; but we have had, ever since 1876, a    chronic state of stagnation in all dominant branches of industry.    Neither will the full crash come; nor will the period of longed-for    prosperity to which we used to be entitled before and after it.  A    dull depression, a chronic glut of all markets for all trades, that is    what we have been living in for nearly ten years.  How is this?     \"The Free Trade theory was based upon one assumption: that England was    to be the one great manufacturing centre of an agricultural world.  And    the actual fact is that this assumption has turned out to be a pure    delusion.  The conditions of modern industry, steam-power and    machinery, can be established wherever there is fuel, especially    coals.  And other countries beside England,--France, Belgium, Germany,    America, even Russia,--have coals.  And the people over there did not    see the advantage of being turned into Irish pauper farmers merely for    the greater wealth and glory of English capitalists.  They set    resolutely about manufacturing, not only for themselves, but for the    rest of the world; and the consequence is, that the manufacturing    monopoly enjoyed by England for nearly a century is irretrievably    broken up.     \"But the manufacturing monopoly of England is the pivot of the present    social system of England.  Even while that monopoly lasted, the    markets could not keep pace with the increasing productivity of    English manufacturers; the decennial crises were the consequence.  And    new markets are getting scarcer every day, so much so that even the    negroes of the Congo are now to be forced into the civilisation    attendant upon Manchester calicos, Staffordshire pottery, and    Birmingham hardware.  How will it be when Continental, and especially    American, goods flow in in ever-increasing quantities--when the    predominating share, still held by British manufacturers, will become    reduced from year to year?  Answer, Free Trade, thou universal    panacea.     \"I am not the first to point this out.  Already, in 1883, at the    Southport meeting of the British Association, Mr. Inglis Palgrave, the    President of the Economic section, stated plainly that 'the days of    great trade profits in England were over, and there was a pause in the    progress of several great branches of industrial labour.  _The country    might almost be said to be entering the non-progressive state_.'     \"But what is to be the consequence?  Capitalist production _cannot_    stop.  It must go on increasing and expanding, or it must die.  Even    now, the mere reduction of England's lion's share in the supply of the    world's markets means stagnation, distress, excess of capital here,    excess of unemployed workpeople there.  What will it be when the    increase of yearly production is brought to a complete stop?     \"Here is the vulnerable place, the heel of Achilles, for capitalistic    production.  Its very basis is the necessity of constant expansion,    and this constant expansion now becomes impossible.  It ends in a    deadlock.  Every year England is brought nearer face to face with the    question: either the country must go to pieces, or capitalist    production must.  Which is it to be?     \"And the working-class?  If even under the unparalleled commercial and    industrial expansion, from 1848 to 1866, they have had to undergo such    misery; if even then the great bulk of them experienced at best but a    temporary improvement of their condition, while only a small,    privileged, 'protected' minority was permanently benefited, what will    it be when this dazzling period is brought finally to a close; when    the present dreary stagnation shall not only become intensified, but    this, its intensified condition, shall become the permanent and normal    state of English trade?     \"The truth is this: during the period of England's industrial monopoly    the English working-class have, to a certain extent, shared in the    benefits of the monopoly.  These benefits were very unequally    parcelled out amongst them; the privileged minority pocketed most, but    even the great mass had, at least, a temporary share now and then.  And    that is the reason why, since the dying-out of Owenism, there has been    no Socialism in England.  With the breakdown of that monopoly, the    English working-class will lose that privileged position; it will find    itself generally--the privileged and leading minority not excepted--on    a level with its fellow-workers abroad.  And that is the reason why    there will be Socialism again in England.\"  To this statement of the case, as that case appeared to me in"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17309"],["title","The Summons of the Lord of Hosts (#1)"],["body","West by Shoghi Effendi.

Glorified is He Who sendeth down His verses to those who perceive. Glorified is He Who guideth whomsoever He pleaseth unto His path. Say: I, verily, am the Path of God unto all who are in the heavens and all who are on the earth; well is it with them that hasten thereunto!  2 Glorified is He Who sendeth down His verses to those who comprehend. Glorified is He Who speaketh forth from the Kingdom of His Revelation, and Who remaineth unknown to all save His honoured servants. Glorified is He Who quickeneth whomsoever He willeth by virtue of His word “Be”, and it is! Glorified is He Who causeth whomsoever He willeth to ascend unto the heaven of grace, and sendeth down therefrom whatsoever He desireth according to a prescribed measure.  3 Blessed is He Who doeth as He willeth by a word of His command. He, verily, is the True One, the Knower of things unseen. Blessed is He Who inspireth whomsoever He willeth with whatsoever He desireth, through His irresistible and inscrutable command. Blessed is He Who aideth whomsoever He desireth with the hosts of the unseen. His might is, in truth, equal to His purpose, and He, verily, is the All-Glorious, the Self-Subsisting. Blessed is He Who exalteth whomsoever He willeth by the power of His sovereign might, and confirmeth whomsoever He chooseth in accordance with His good pleasure; well is it with them that understand!  4 Blessed is He Who, in a well-guarded Tablet, hath prescribed a fixed measure unto all things. Blessed is He Who hath revealed unto His Servant that which shall illumine the hearts and minds of men. Blessed is He Who hath sent down upon His Servant such tribulations as have melted the hearts of them that dwell within the Tabernacle of eternity and the souls of those who have drawn nigh unto their Lord. Blessed is He Who hath showered upon His Servant, from the clouds of His decree, the darts of affliction, and Who beholdeth Me enduring them with patience and fortitude. Blessed is He Who hath ordained for His Servant that which He hath destined for no other soul. He, verily, is the One, the Incomparable, the Self-Subsisting.  5 Blessed is He Who hath caused to rain down upon His Servant from the clouds of enmity, and at the hands of the people of denial, the shafts of tribulation and trial; and yet seeth Our heart filled with gratitude. Blessed is He Who hath laid upon the shoulders of His Servant the burden of the heavens and of the earth—a burden for which We yield Him every praise, though none may grasp this save them that are endued with understanding. Glorified is He Who hath surrendered the embodiment of His Beauty to the clutches of the envious and the wicked—a fate unto which We are fully resigned, though none may perceive this save those who are endued with insight. Glorified is He Who hath left Ḥusayn to make His dwelling amidst the hosts of His enemies, and exposed His body with every breath to the spears of hatred and anger; yet do We yield Him thanks for all that He hath destined to befall His Servant Who repaireth unto Him in His affliction and grief.  6 While engulfed in tribulations I heard a most wondrous, a most sweet voice, calling above My head. Turning My face, I beheld a Maiden—the embodiment of the remembrance of the name of My Lord—suspended in the air before Me. So rejoiced was she in her very soul that her countenance shone with the ornament of the good pleasure of God, and her cheeks glowed with the brightness of the All-Merciful. Betwixt earth and heaven she was raising a call which captivated the hearts and minds of men. She was imparting to both My inward and outer being tidings which rejoiced My soul, and the souls of God’s honoured servants.  7 Pointing with her finger unto My head, she addressed all who are in heaven and all who are on earth, saying: By God! This is the Best-Beloved of the worlds, and yet ye comprehend not. This is the Beauty of God amongst you, and the power of His sovereignty within you, could ye but understand. This is the Mystery of God and His Treasure, the Cause of God and His glory unto all who are in the kingdoms of Revelation and of creation, if ye be of them that perceive. This is He Whose Presence is the ardent desire of the denizens of the Realm of eternity, and of them that dwell within the Tabernacle of glory, and yet from His Beauty do ye turn aside.  8 O people of the Bayán! If ye aid Him not, God will assuredly assist Him with the powers of earth and heaven, and sustain Him with the hosts of the unseen through His command “Be”, and it is! The day is approaching when God will have, by an act of His Will, raised up a race of men the nature of which is inscrutable to all save God, the All-Powerful, the Self-Subsisting. He shall purify them from the defilement of idle fancies and corrupt desires, shall lift them up to the heights of holiness, and shall cause them to manifest the signs of His sovereignty and might upon earth. Thus hath it been ordained by God, the All-Glorious, the All-Loving.  9 O people of the Bayán! Would ye deny Him Whose presence is the very object of your creation, while ye rejoice idly upon your couches? Would ye laugh to scorn and contend with Him, a single hair of Whose head excelleth, in the sight of God, all that are in the heavens and all that are on the earth? O people of the Bayán! Produce, then, that which ye possess, that I may know by what proof ye believed aforetime in the Manifestations of His Cause, and by what reason ye now wax so disdainful!  10 I swear by Him Who hath fashioned Me from the light of His own Beauty! None have I ever seen that surpasseth you in heedlessness or exceedeth you in ignorance. Ye seek to prove your faith in God through such holy Tablets as ye possess, yet when the verses of God were revealed and His Lamp was lighted, ye disbelieved in Him Whose very Pen hath fixed the destinies of all things in the Preserved Tablet. Ye recite the sacred verses and yet repudiate Him Who is their Source and Revealer. Thus hath God blinded your eyes in requital for your deeds, would ye but understand. Day and night ye transcribe the verses of God, and yet ye remain shut out, as by a veil, from Him Who hath revealed them.  11 In this Day the Concourse on high beholdeth you in your evil doings and shunneth your company, and yet ye perceive it not. They ask of one another: “What words do these fools utter, and in what valley are they wont to graze? Do they deny that whereunto their very souls testify, and shut their eyes to that which they plainly behold?” I swear by God, O people! They that inhabit the Cities of the Names of God are bewildered at your actions, while ye roam, aimless and unconscious, in a parched and barren land.  12 O Pen of the Most High! Hearken unto the Call of Thy Lord, raised from the Divine Lote-Tree in the holy and luminous Spot, that the sweet accents of Thy Lord, the All-Merciful, may fill Thy soul with joy and fervour, and that the breezes that waft from My name, the Ever-Forgiving, may dispel Thy cares and sorrows. Raise up, then, from this Temple, the temples of the Oneness of God, that they may tell out, in the kingdom of creation, the tidings of their Lord, the Most Exalted, the All-Glorious, and be of them that are illumined by His light.  13 We, verily, have ordained this Temple to be the source of all existence in the new creation, that all may know of a certainty My power to accomplish that which I have purposed through My word “Be”, and it is! Beneath the shadow of every letter of this Temple We shall raise up a people whose number none can reckon save God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. Erelong shall God bring forth from His Temple such souls as will remain unswayed by the insinuations of the rebellious, and who will quaff at all times of the cup that is life indeed. These, truly, are of the blissful.  14 These are servants who abide beneath the shelter of the tender mercy of their Lord, and who remain undeterred by those who seek to obstruct their path. Upon their faces may be seen the brightness of the light of the All-Merciful, and from their hearts may be heard the remembrance of Mine all-glorious and inaccessible Name. Were they to unloose their tongues to extol their Lord, the denizens of earth and heaven would join in their anthems of praise—yet how few are they who hear! And were they to glorify their Lord, all created things would join in their hymns of glory. Thus hath God exalted them above the rest of His creation, and yet the people remain unaware!  15 These are they who circle round the Cause of God even as the shadow doth revolve around the sun. Open, then, your eyes, O people of the Bayán, that haply ye may behold them! It is by virtue of their movement that all things are set in motion, and by reason of their stillness all things are brought to rest, would that ye might be assured thereof! Through them the believers in the Divine Unity have turned towards Him Who is the Object of the adoration of the entire creation, and by them the hearts of the righteous have found rest and composure, could ye but know it! Through them the earth hath been established, the clouds have rained down their bounty, and the bread of knowledge hath descended from the heaven of grace, could ye but perceive it!  16 These souls are the protectors of"]]]
