Our great poet, Mr. Browning, author of 'Paracelsus,' &c., is enthusiastic in his admiration of the rhythm.\" Mr. Ingram, after referring to \"Lady Geraldine,\" cleverly points out another source from which Poe may have caught an impulse. In 1843, Albert Pike, the half-Greek, half-frontiersman, poet of Arkansas, had printed in \"The New Mirror,\" for which Poe then was writing, some verses entitled \"Isadore,\" but since revised by the author and called \"The Widowed Heart.\" I select from Mr. Pike's revision the following stanza, of which the main features correspond with the original version:      \"Restless I pace our lonely rooms, I play our songs no more,     The garish sun shines flauntingly upon the unswept floor;     The mocking-bird still sits and sings, O melancholy strain!     For my heart is like an autumn-cloud that overflows with rain;                             Thou art lost to me forever, Isadore!\"  Here we have a prolonged measure, a similarity of refrain, and the introduction of a bird whose song enhances sorrow. There are other trails which may be followed by the curious; notably, a passage which Mr. Ingram selects from Poe's final review of \"Barnaby Rudge\":       \"The raven, too, * * * might have been made, more than we now see      it, a portion of the conception of the fantastic Barnaby. * * * Its      character might have performed, in regard to that of the idiot,      much the same part as does, in music, the accompaniment in respect      to the air.\"  Nevertheless, after pointing out these germs and resemblances, the value of this poem still is found in its originality. The progressive music, the scenic detail and contrasted light and shade,--above all, the spiritual passion of the nocturn, make it the work of an informing genius. As for the gruesome bird, he is unlike all the other ravens of his clan, from the \"twa corbies\" and \"three ravens\" of the balladists to Barnaby's rumpled \"Grip.\" Here is no semblance of the cawing rook that haunts ancestral turrets and treads the field of heraldry; no boding phantom of which Tickell sang that, when,              \"shrieking at her window thrice,         The raven flap'd his wing,     Too well the love-lorn maiden knew         The solemn boding sound.\"  Poe's raven is a distinct conception; the incarnation of a mourner's agony and hopelessness; a sable embodied Memory, the abiding chronicler of doom, a type of the Irreparable. Escaped across the Styx, from \"the Night's Plutonian shore,\" he seems the imaged soul of the questioner himself,--of him who can not, will not, quaff the kind nepenthe, because the memory of Lenore is all that is left him, and with the surcease of his sorrow even that would be put aside.  _The Raven_ also may be taken as a representative poem of its author, for its exemplification of all his notions of what a poem should be. These are found in his essays on \"The Poetic Principle,\" \"The Rationale of Verse,\" and \"The Philosophy of Composition.\" Poe declared that \"in Music, perhaps, the soul most nearly attains the great end for which, when inspired by the Poetic Sentiment, it struggles--the creation of supernal Beauty.... Verse cannot be better designated than as an inferior or less capable music\"; but again, verse which is really the \"Poetry of Words\" is \"The Rhythmical Creation of Beauty,\"--this and nothing more. The _tone_ of the highest Beauty is one of Sadness. The most melancholy of topics is Death. This must be allied to Beauty. \"The death, then, of a beautiful woman is, unquestionably, the most poetical topic in the world,--and equally is it beyond doubt that the lips best suited for such a topic are those of a bereaved lover.\" These last expressions are quoted from Poe's whimsical analysis of this very poem, but they indicate precisely the general range of his verse. The climax of \"The Bells\" is the muffled monotone of ghouls, who glory in weighing down the human heart. \"Lenore,\" _The Raven_, \"The Sleeper,\" \"To One in Paradise,\" and \"Ulalume\" form a tenebrose symphony,--and \"Annabel Lee,\" written last of all, shows that one theme possessed him to the end. Again, these are all nothing if not musical, and some are touched with that quality of the Fantastic which awakes the sense of awe, and adds a new fear to agony itself. Through all is dimly outlined, beneath a shadowy pall, the poet's ideal love,--so often half-portrayed elsewhere,--the entombed wife of Usher, the Lady Ligeia, in truth the counterpart of his own nature. I suppose that an artist's love for one \"in the form\" never can wholly rival his devotion to some ideal. The woman near him must exercise her spells, be all by turns and nothing long, charm him with infinite variety, or be content to forego a share of his allegiance. He must be lured by the Unattainable, and this is ever just beyond him in his passion for creative art.  Poe, like Hawthorne, came in with the decline of the Romantic school, and none delighted more than he to laugh at its calamity. Yet his heart was with the romancers and their Oriental or Gothic effects. His invention, so rich in the prose tales, seemed to desert him when he wrote verse; and his judgment told him that long romantic poems depend more upon incident than inspiration,--and that, to utter the poetry of romance, lyrics would suffice. Hence his theory, clearly fitted to his own limitations, that \"a 'long poem' is a flat contradiction in terms.\" The components of _The Raven_ are few and simple: a man, a bird, and the phantasmal memory at a woman. But the piece affords a fine display of romantic material. What have we? The midnight; the shadowy chamber with its tomes of forgotten lore; the student,--a modern Hieronymus; the raven's tap on the casement; the wintry night and dying fire; the silken wind-swept hangings; the dreams and vague mistrust of the echoing darkness; the black, uncanny bird upon the pallid bust; the accessories of violet velvet and the gloating lamp. All this stage effect of situation, light, color, sound, is purely romantic, and even melodramatic, but of a poetic quality that melodrama rarely exhibits, and thoroughly reflective of the poet's \"eternal passion, eternal pain.\"  The rhythmical structure of _The Raven_ was sure to make an impression. Rhyme, alliteration, the burden, the stanzaic form, were devised with singular adroitness. Doubtless the poet was struck with the aptness of Miss Barrett's musical trochaics, in \"eights,\" and especially by the arrangement adopted near the close of \"Lady Geraldine\":      \"'Eyes,' he said, 'now throbbing through me! Are ye eyes that did undo me?     Shining eyes, like antique jewels set in Parian statue-stone!     Underneath that calm white forehead, are ye ever burning torrid     O'er the desolate sand-desert of my heart and life undone?'\"  His artistic introduction of a third rhyme in both the second and fourth lines, and the addition of a fifth line and a final refrain, made the stanza of _The Raven_. The persistent alliteration seems to come without effort, and often the rhymes within lines are seductive; while the refrain or burden dominates the whole work. Here also he had profited by Miss Barrett's study of ballads and romaunts in her own and other tongues. A \"refrain\" is the lure wherewith a poet or a musician holds the wandering ear,--the recurrent longing of Nature for the initial strain. I have always admired the beautiful refrains of the English songstress,--\"The Nightingales, the Nightingales,\" \"Margret, Margret,\" \"My Heart and I,\" \"Toll slowly,\" \"The River floweth on,\" \"Pan, Pan is dead,\" etc. She also employed what I term the Repetend, in the use of which Poe has excelled all poets since Coleridge thus revived it:      \"O happy living things! no tongue     Their beauty might declare:     A spring of love gushed from my heart,     And I blessed them unaware:     Sure my kind saint took pity on me,     And I blessed them unaware.\"  Poe created the fifth line of his stanza for the magic of the repetend. He relied upon it to the uttermost in a few later poems,--\"Lenore,\" \"Annabel Lee,\" \"Ulalume,\" and \"For Annie.\" It gained a wild and melancholy music, I have thought, from the \"sweet influences,\" of the Afric burdens and repetends that were sung to him in childhood, attuning with their native melody the voice of our Southern poet.  \"The Philosophy of Composition,\" his analysis of _The Raven_, is a technical dissection of its method and structure. Neither his avowal of cold-blooded artifice, nor his subsequent avowal to friends that an exposure of this artifice was only another of his intellectual hoaxes, need be wholly credited. If he had designed the complete work in advance, he scarcely would have made so harsh a prelude of rattle-pan rhymes to the delicious melody of the second stanza,--not even upon his theory of the fantastic. Of course an artist, having perfected a work, sees, like the first Artist, that it is good, and sees why it is good. A subsequent analysis, coupled with a disavowal of any sacred fire, readily enough may be made. My belief is that the first conception and rough draft of this poem came as inspiration always comes; that its author then saw how it might be perfected, giving it the final touches described in his chapter on Composition, and that the latter, therefore, is neither wholly false nor wholly true. The harm of such analysis is that it tempts a novice to fancy that artificial processes can supersede imagination. The impulse of genius is to guard the secrets of its creative hour. Glimpses obtained of the toil, the baffled experiments, which precede a triumph, as in the sketch-work of Hawthorne recently brought to light, afford priceless instruction and encouragement to the sincere artist. But one who voluntarily exposes his Muse to the gaze of all comers should recall the fate of King Candaules.  The world still thinks of Poe as a \"lu"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/172"],["title","The Haunted Bookshop (#1)"],["body","customer.  The hunger for good books is more general and more insistent than you would dream.  But it is still in a way subconscious.  People need books, but they don't know they need them.  Generally they are not aware that the books they need are in existence.\"  \"Why wouldn't advertising be the way to let them know?\" asked the young man, rather acutely.  \"My dear chap, I understand the value of advertising.  But in my own case it would be futile.  I am not a dealer in merchandise but a specialist in adjusting the book to the human need.  Between ourselves, there is no such thing, abstractly, as a 'good' book.  A book is 'good' only when it meets some human hunger or refutes some human error.  A book that is good for me would very likely be punk for you.  My pleasure is to prescribe books for such patients as drop in here and are willing to tell me their symptoms.  Some people have let their reading faculties decay so that all I can do is hold a post mortem on them.  But most are still open to treatment.  There is no one so grateful as the man to whom you have given just the book his soul needed and he never knew it.  No advertisement on earth is as potent as a grateful customer.  \"I will tell you another reason why I don't advertise,\" he continued. \"In these days when everyone keeps his trademark before the public, as you call it, not to advertise is the most original and startling thing one can do to attract attention.  It was the fact that I do NOT advertise that drew you here.  And everyone who comes here thinks he has discovered the place himself.  He goes and tells his friends about the book asylum run by a crank and a lunatic, and they come here in turn to see what it is like.\"  \"I should like to come here again myself and browse about,\" said the advertising agent.  \"I should like to have you prescribe for me.\"  \"The first thing needed is to acquire a sense of pity.  The world has been printing books for 450 years, and yet gunpowder still has a wider circulation.  Never mind!  Printer's ink is the greater explosive: it will win.  Yes, I have a few of the good books here.  There are only about 30,000 really important books in the world.  I suppose about 5,000 of them were written in the English language, and 5,000 more have been translated.\"  \"You are open in the evenings?\"  \"Until ten o'clock.  A great many of my best customers are those who are at work all day and can only visit bookshops at night.  The real book-lovers, you know, are generally among the humbler classes.  A man who is impassioned with books has little time or patience to grow rich by concocting schemes for cozening his fellows.\"  The little bookseller's bald pate shone in the light of the bulb hanging over the wrapping table.  His eyes were bright and earnest, his short red beard bristled like wire.  He wore a ragged brown Norfolk jacket from which two buttons were missing.  A bit of a fanatic himself, thought the customer, but a very entertaining one.  \"Well, sir,\" he said, \"I am ever so grateful to you. I'll come again.  Good-night.\"  And he started down the aisle for the door.  As he neared the front of the shop, Mr. Mifflin switched on a cluster of lights that hung high up, and the young man found himself beside a large bulletin board covered with clippings, announcements, circulars, and little notices written on cards in a small neat script.  The following caught his eye:   RX  If your mind needs phosphorus, try \"Trivia,\" by Logan Pearsall Smith.  If your mind needs a whiff of strong air, blue and cleansing, from hilltops and primrose valleys, try \"The Story of My Heart,\" by Richard Jefferies.  If your mind needs a tonic of iron and wine, and a thorough rough-and-tumbling, try Samuel Butler's \"Notebooks\" or \"The Man Who Was Thursday,\" by Chesterton.  If you need \"all manner of Irish,\" and a relapse into irresponsible freakishness, try \"The Demi-Gods,\" by James Stephens.  It is a better book than one deserves or expects.  It's a good thing to turn your mind upside down now and then, like an hour-glass, to let the particles run the other way.  One who loves the English tongue can have a lot of fun with a Latin dictionary.                                             ROGER MIFFLIN.   Human beings pay very little attention to what is told them unless they know something about it already.  The young man had heard of none of these books prescribed by the practitioner of bibliotherapy.  He was about to open the door when Mifflin appeared at his side.  \"Look here,\" he said, with a quaint touch of embarrassment.  \"I was very much interested by our talk.  I'm all alone this evening--my wife is away on a holiday.  Won't you stay and have supper with me?  I was just looking up some new recipes when you came in.\"  The other was equally surprised and pleased by this unusual invitation.  \"Why--that's very good of you,\" he said.  \"Are you sure I won't be intruding?\"  \"Not at all!\" cried the bookseller.  \"I detest eating alone: I was hoping someone would drop in.  I always try to have a guest for supper when my wife is away.  I have to stay at home, you see, to keep an eye on the shop.  We have no servant, and I do the cooking myself.  It's great fun.  Now you light your pipe and make yourself comfortable for a few minutes while I get things ready.  Suppose you come back to my den.\"  On a table of books at the front of the shop Mifflin laid a large card lettered:        PROPRIETOR AT SUPPER      IF YOU WANT ANYTHING      RING THIS BELL   Beside the card he placed a large old-fashioned dinner bell, and then led the way to the rear of the shop.  Behind the little office in which this unusual merchant had been studying his cook-book a narrow stairway rose on each side, running up to the gallery.  Behind these stairs a short flight of steps led to the domestic recesses.  The visitor found himself ushered into a small room on the left, where a grate of coals glowed under a dingy mantelpiece of yellowish marble.  On the mantel stood a row of blackened corn-cob pipes and a canister of tobacco.  Above was a startling canvas in emphatic oils, representing a large blue wagon drawn by a stout white animal--evidently a horse.  A background of lush scenery enhanced the forceful technique of the limner.  The walls were stuffed with books. Two shabby, comfortable chairs were drawn up to the iron fender, and a mustard-coloured terrier was lying so close to the glow that a smell of singed hair was sensible.  \"There,\" said the host; \"this is my cabinet, my chapel of ease.  Take off your coat and sit down.\"  \"Really,\" began Gilbert, \"I'm afraid this is----\"  \"Nonsense!  Now you sit down and commend your soul to Providence and the kitchen stove.  I'll bustle round and get supper.\" Gilbert pulled out his pipe, and with a sense of elation prepared to enjoy an unusual evening.  He was a young man of agreeable parts, amiable and sensitive. He knew his disadvantages in literary conversation, for he had gone to an excellent college where glee clubs and theatricals had left him little time for reading.  But still he was a lover of good books, though he knew them chiefly by hearsay.  He was twenty-five years old, employed as a copywriter by the Grey-Matter Advertising Agency.  The little room in which he found himself was plainly the bookseller's sanctum, and contained his own private library.  Gilbert browsed along the shelves curiously.  The volumes were mostly shabby and bruised; they had evidently been picked up one by one in the humble mangers of the second-hand vendor.  They all showed marks of use and meditation.  Mr. Gilbert had the earnest mania for self-improvement which has blighted the lives of so many young men--a passion which, however, is commendable in those who feel themselves handicapped by a college career and a jewelled fraternity emblem.  It suddenly struck him that it would be valuable to make a list of some of the titles in Mifflin's collection, as a suggestion for his own reading.  He took out a memorandum book and began jotting down the books that intrigued him:         The Works of Francis Thompson (3 vols.)      Social History of Smoking:  Apperson      The Path to Rome:  Hilaire Belloc      The Book of Tea:  Kakuzo      Happy Thoughts:  F. C. Burnand      Dr. Johnson's Prayers and Meditations      Margaret Ogilvy:  J. M. Barrie      Confessions of a Thug:  Taylor      General Catalogue of the Oxford University Press      The Morning's War:  C. E. Montague      The Spirit of Man:  edited by Robert Bridges      The Romany Rye:  Borrow      Poems:  Emily Dickinson      Poems:  George Herbert      The House of Cobwebs:  George Gissing   So far had he got, and was beginning to say to himself that in the interests of Advertising (who is a jealous mistress) he had best call a halt, when his host entered the room, his small face eager, his eyes blue points of light.  \"Come, Mr. Aubrey Gilbert!\" he cried.  \"The meal is set.  You want to wash your hands?  Make haste then, this way: the eggs are hot and waiting.\"  The dining-room into which the guest was conducted betrayed a feminine touch not visible in the smoke-dimmed quarters of shop and cabinet.  At the windows were curtains of laughing chintz and pots of pink geranium. The table, under a drop-light in a flame-coloured silk screen, was brightly set with silver and blue china.  In a cut-glass decanter sparkled a ruddy brown wine.  The edged tool of Advertising felt his spirits undergo an unmistakable upward pressure.  \"Sit down, sir,\" said Mifflin, lifting the roof of a platter.  \"These are eggs Samuel Butler, an invention of my own, the apotheosis of hen fruit.\"  Gilbert greeted the invention with applause.  An Egg Samuel Butler, for the notebook of housewives, may be summarized as a pyramid, based upon toast, whereof the chief masonries are a flake of bacon, an egg poached to firmness, a wreath of mushrooms, a cap-sheaf of red peppers; the whole dribbled with a warm pink sauce of which the"]]]
