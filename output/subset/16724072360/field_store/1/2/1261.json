We offered him assistance, but he was progressing quite well alone. Later on another officer related to me his experience when his car broke down at midnight some 20 km. from a village. The chauffeur was making slow headway with the repairs. The officer inquired whether he really understood the job, and received the reply, \"Yes, mon lieutenant, I think I do; but I am rather a novice, as before the war I was a lion-tamer!\" Apparently the gallant son of Gaul found it easier to tame lions than to repair motors.  We left Vitry-le-François at 6 o'clock next morning, and started \"the hunt for generals.\" It is by no means easy to discover where the actual Q.G. (Headquarters) of the General of any particular secteur is situated.  We were not yet really on the \"White Road\" to Verdun, and there was still much to be seen that delighted the eyes. In one yellow cornfield there appeared to be enormous poppies. On approaching we discovered a detachment of Tirailleurs from Algiers, sitting in groups, and the \"poppies\" were the red fezes of the men--a gorgeous blending of crimson and gold. We threw a large box of cigarettes to them, and were greeted with shouts of joy and thanks. The Tirailleurs are the \"enfants terribles\" of the French Army. One noble son of Africa who was being treated in one of the hospitals once presented me with an aluminium ring made from a piece of German shell. I asked him to make one for one of my comrades who was working at home, and he informed me that nothing would have given him greater pleasure, but unfortunately he had no more aluminium. Later in the day, passing through the ward, I saw him surrounded by five or six Parisian ladies who were showering sweets, cigarettes, and flowers on him, whilst he was responding by presenting each of them with an aluminium ring. When they had left I went to him and told him, \"Mahmud, that was not kind. I asked you for a ring and you said you had not got any more aluminium.\" He smiled, and his nurse, who was passing, added, \"No, he had not _got_ any more aluminium, but when he is better he will _get_ forty-eight hours' punishment; he had been into the kitchen, stolen one of our best aluminium saucepans, and has been making souvenirs for the ladies.\" He made no attempt to justify his action beyond stating: \"Moi, pas si mauvais; toi, pas faux souvenir\" (\"I am not so bad; I did not attempt to give you a fake souvenir\").  Another of our chocolate-coloured patients found in the grounds of the hospital an old umbrella. Its ribs stuck out and it was full of holes, but it gave him the idea of royalty, and daily he sat up in bed in the ward with the umbrella unfurled whilst he laid down the law to his comrades. The nurses endeavoured to persuade him to hand it over at night. He obstinately refused, insisting that \"he knew his comrades,\" and he feared that one of them would certainly steal the treasure, so he preferred to keep it in the bed with him.  At Villers-le-Sec we came upon the headquarters of the cooks for that section of the front. The cook is one of the most important men in a French regiment; he serves many ends. When carrying the food through the communicating trenches to the front-line trenches, he is always supposed to bring to the men the latest news, the latest tale which is going the round of the camp, and anything that may happen to interest them. If he has not got any news he must manufacture and produce some kind of story. It is really necessary for him to be not only a cook but also an author.  There is a tale going the round of the French Army how one section of the cooks, although unarmed, managed to take some twenty German prisoners. As they went on their way, they saw the Germans in the distance approaching them; the head cook quietly drew the field-kitchens behind a clump of trees and bushes, placed his men in a row, each with a cooking utensil in his hand, and as the Germans passed shouted to them to surrender. The sun fell on the handles of the saucepans, causing them to shine like bayonets, and the Germans, taken unawares, laid down their arms. The head cook then stepped out and one by one took the rifles from the enemy and handed them to his men. It was only when he had disarmed the Germans and armed his comrades that he gave the signal for them to step out, and the Germans saw that they had been taken by a ruse. One can imagine the joy of the French troops in the next village, when, with a soup-ladle in his hand, his assistants armed with German rifles, followed by the soup-kitchen and twenty prisoners, he marched in to report.  It is curious to note how near humour is to tragedy in war, and how quick-wittedness may serve a useful purpose and even save life. A young French medical student told me that he owed his life to the quick wit of the women of a village and the sense of humour of a Saxon officer. Whilst passing from one hospital to another, he was captured by a small German patrol, and in spite of his papers, proving that he was attached to the Red Cross Service, he was tried as a spy and condemned to be shot. At the opening of his trial the women had been interested spectators; towards the end all of them had vanished. He was placed against a barn door, the firing squad lined up, when from behind the hedge bordering a wood the women began to bombard the soldiers with eggs. The aim was excellent--not one man escaped; the German officer laughed at the plight of his men and, in the brief respite accorded, the young man dashed towards the hedge and vanished in the undergrowth. The Germans fired a few shots, but there was no organised attempt to follow him, probably because their own position was not too secure. He was loath to leave the women to face the music, but they insisted that it was \"Pour la Patrie,\" and that they were quite capable of taking care of themselves. Later he again visited the village, and the women told him that beyond obliging them to clean the soldiers' clothes thoroughly, the German officer had inflicted no other punishment upon them.  A certain number of inhabitants are still living in the village of Revigny. You see everywhere placards announcing \"Caves pour 25,\" \"Caves pour 100,\" and each person knows to which cellar he is to go if a Taube should start bombing the village. I saw one cellar marked \"120 persons, specially safe, reserved for the children.\" Children are one of the most valuable assets of France, and a good old Territorial _Pè-père_ (Daddy), as they are nicknamed, told me that it was his special but difficult duty to muster the children directly a Taube was signalled, and chase them down into the cellar. Mopping his brow, he assured me that it was not easy to catch the little beggars, who hid in the ruins, behind the army wagons, anywhere to escape the \"parental\" eye. It is needless to add they consider it a grave infringement of their personal liberty and think that they should be allowed to remain in the open and see all that goes on, just as the little Londoners beg and coax to be allowed to stay up \"to see the Zepps.\"  Passing the railway-station, we stopped to make some inquiries, and promptly ascertained all we wished to know from the chef de gare.  In the days of peace there is in France no one more officious than the station-master of a small but prosperous village. Now he is the meekest of men. Braided cap in hand, he goes along the train from carriage door to carriage door, humbly requesting newspapers for the wounded in the local hospitals. \"Nous avons 125 blessés ici, cela les fait tant de plaisir d'avoir des nouvelles\" (\"We have 125 wounded here, and oh! how they love to have the latest news\").  In addition to levying a toll on printed matter, he casts a covetous and meaning glance on any fruit or chocolate that may be visible. Before the train is out of the station, you can see the once-busy and in his own opinion all-important railway official vanishing down the road to carry his spoils to his suffering comrades. Railway travelling is indeed expensive in France. No matter what time of day or night, wet or fine, the trains are met at each station by devoted women who extract contributions for the Red Cross funds from the pockets of willing givers. It is only fair to state, however, that in most instances the station-master gets there first.  From the time we left Revigny until we had passed into the Champagne country, upon the return journey from Verdun, we no longer saw a green tree or a blade of green grass; we were now indeed upon the \"White Road which leads into Verdun.\" Owing to an exceptionally trying and dry summer the roads are thick with white dust. The continual passing of the _camions_, the splendid transport-wagons of the French Army, carrying either food, munitions, or troops, has stirred up the dust and coated the fields, trees, and hedges with a thick layer of white. It is almost as painful to the eyes as the snow-fields of the Alps.  I saw one horse that looked exactly like a plaster statuette. His master had scrubbed him down, but before he dried the white dust had settled on him everywhere. Naturally \"humans\" do not escape.

Saádí is said to have lived upwards of a hundred years, thirty of which were passed in the acquisition of knowledge, thirty more in travelling through different countries, and the rest of his life he spent in retirement and acts of devotion. He died, in his native city, about the year 1291.      [1] One reason, doubtless, for Persian and Turkish poets         adopting a _takhallus_ is the custom of the poet         introducing his name into every ghazal he composes,         generally towards the end; and as his proper name would         seldom or never accommodate itself to purposes of verse         he selects a more suitable one.  At one period of his life Saádí took part in the wars of the Saracens against the Crusaders in Palestine, and also in the wars for the faith in India. In the course of his wanderings he had the misfortune to be taken prisoner by the Franks, in Syria, and was ransomed by a friend, but only to fall into worse thraldom by marrying a shrewish wife. He has thus related the circumstances:  \"Weary of the society of my friends at Damascus, I fled to the barren wastes of Jerusalem, and associated with brutes, until I was made captive by the Franks, and forced to dig clay along with Jews in the fortress of Tripoli. One of the nobles of Aleppo, mine ancient friend, happened to pass that way and recollected me. He said: 'What a state is this to be in! How farest thou?' I answered: 'Seeing that I could place confidence in God alone, I retired to the mountains and wilds, to avoid the society of man; but judge what must be my situation, to be confined in a stall, in company with wretches who deserve not the name of men. \"To be confined by the feet with friends is better than to walk in a garden with strangers.\"' He took compassion on my forlorn condition, ransomed me from the Franks for ten dínars,[2] and took me with him to Aleppo.      [2] A dínar is a gold coin, worth about ten shillings of our         money.  \"My friend had a daughter, to whom he married me, and he presented me with a hundred dínars as her dower. After some time my wife unveiled her disposition, which was ill-tempered, quarrelsome, obstinate, and abusive; so that the happiness of my life vanished. It has been well said: 'A bad woman in the house of a virtuous man is hell even in this world.' Take care how you connect yourself with a bad woman. Save us, O Lord, from the fiery trial! Once she reproached me, saying: 'Art thou not the creature whom my father ransomed from captivity amongst the Franks for ten dínars?' 'Yes,' I answered; 'he redeemed me for ten dínars, and enslaved me to thee for a hundred.'  \"I heard that a man once rescued a sheep from the mouth of a wolf, but at night drew his knife across its throat. The expiring sheep thus complained: 'You delivered me from the jaws of a wolf, but in the end I perceive you have yourself become a wolf to me.'\"  Sir Gore Ouseley, in his _Biographical Notices of Persian Poets_, states that Saádí in the latter part of his life retired to a cell near Shíráz, where he remained buried in contemplation of the Deity, except when visited, as was often the case, by princes, nobles, and learned men. It was the custom of his illustrious visitors to take with them all kinds of meats, of which, when Saádí and his company had partaken, the shaykh always put what remained in a basket suspended from his window, that the poor wood-cutters of Shíráz, who daily passed by his cell, might occasionally satisfy their hunger.         *       *       *       *       *  The writings of Saádí, in prose as well as verse, are numerous; his best known works being the _Gulistán_, or Rose-Garden, and the _Bustán_, or Garden of Odours. Among his other compositions are: an essay on Reason and Love; Advice to Kings; Arabian and Persian idylls, and a book of elegies, besides a large collection of odes and sonnets. Saádí was an accomplished linguist, and composed several poems in the languages of many of the countries through which he travelled. \"I have wandered to various regions of the world,\" he tells us, \"and everywhere have I mixed freely with the inhabitants. I have gathered something in each corner; I have gleaned an ear from every harvest.\" A deep insight into the secret springs of human actions; an extensive knowledge of mankind; fervent piety, without a taint of bigotry; a poet's keen appreciation of the beauties of nature; together with a ready wit and a lively sense of humour, are among the characteristics of Saádí's masterly compositions. No writer, ancient or modern, European or Asiatic, has excelled, and few have equalled, Saádí in that rare faculty for condensing profound moral truths into short, pithy sentences. For example:  \"The remedy against want is to moderate your desires.\"  \"There is a difference between him who claspeth his mistress in his arms, and him whose eyes are fixed on the door expecting her.\"  \"Whoever recounts to you the faults of your neighbour will doubtless expose your defects to others.\"  His humorous comparisons flash upon the reader's mind with curious effect, occurring, as they often do, in the midst of a grave discourse. Thus he says of a poor minstrel: \"You would say that the sound of his bow would burst the arteries, and that his voice was more discordant than the lamentations of a man for the death of his father;\" and of another bad singer: \"No one with a mattock can so effectually scrape clay from the face of a hard stone as his discordant voice harrows up the soul.\"  Talking of music reminds me of a remark of the learned Gentius, in one of his notes on the _Gulistán_ of Saádí, that music was formerly in such consideration in Persia that it was a maxim of their sages that when a king was about to die, if he left for his successor a very young son, his aptitude for reigning should be proved by some agreeable songs; and if the child was pleasurably affected, then it was a sign of his capacity and genius, but if the contrary, he should be declared unfit.--It would appear that the old Persian musicians, like Timotheus, knew the secret art of swaying the passions. The celebrated philosopher Al-Farabí (who died about the middle of the tenth century), among his accomplishments, excelled in music, in proof of which a curious anecdote is told. Returning from the pilgrimage to Mecca, he introduced himself, though a stranger, at the court of Sayfú 'd-Dawla, sultan of Syria, when a party of musicians chanced to be performing, and he joined them. The prince admired his skill, and, desiring to hear something of his own, Al-Farabí unfolded a composition, and distributed the parts amongst the band. The first movement threw the prince and his courtiers into violent laughter, the next melted all into tears, and the last lulled even the performers to sleep. At the retaking of Baghdád by the Turks in 1638, when the springing of a mine, whereby eight hundred jannisaries perished, was the signal for a general massacre, and thirty thousand Persians were put to the sword, a Persian musician named Sháh-Kúlí, who was brought before the sultan Murád, played and sang so sweetly, first a song of triumph, and then a dirge, that the sultan, moved to pity by the music, gave order to stop the slaughter.  To resume, after this anecdotical digression. Saádí gives this whimsical piece of advice to a pugnacious fellow: \"Be sure, either that thou art stronger than thine enemy, or that thou hast a swifter pair of heels.\" And he relates a droll story in illustration of the use and abuse of the phrase, \"For the sake of God,\" which is so frequently in the mouths of Muslims: A harsh-voiced man was reading the Kurán in a loud tone. A pious man passed by him and said: \"What is thy monthly salary?\" The other replied: \"Nothing.\" \"Why, then, dost thou give thyself this trouble?\" \"I read for the sake of God,\" he rejoined. \"Then,\" said the pious man, \"_for God's sake don't read_.\"  The most esteemed of Saádí's numerous and diversified works is the _Gulistán_, or Rose-Garden. The first English translation of this work was made by Francis Gladwin, and published in 1808, and it is a very scarce book. Other translations have since been issued, but they are rather costly and the editions limited. It is strange that in these days of cheap reprints of rare and excellent works of genius no enterprising publisher should have thought it worth reproduction in a popular form. It is not one of those ponderous tomes of useless learning which not even an Act of Parliament could cause to be generally read, and which no publisher would be so blind to his own interests as to reprint. As regards its size, the _Gulistán_ is but a small book, but intrinsically it is indeed a very great book, such as could only be produced by a great mind, and it comprises more wisdom and wit than a score of old English folios could together yield to the most devoted reader. Some querulous persons there are who affect to consider the present as a shallow age, because, forsooth, huge volumes of learning--each the labour of a lifetime--are not now produced. But the flood-gates of knowledge are now wide open, and, no longer confined within the old, narrow, if deep, channels, learning has spread abroad, like the Nile during the season of its over-flow. Shallow, it may be, but more widely beneficial, since its life-giving waters are within the reach of all.  Unlike most of our learned old English authors, Saádí did not cast upon the world all that came from the rich mine of his genius, dross as well as fine gold, clay as well as gems. It is because they have done so that many ponderous tomes of learning and industry stand neglected on the shelves of great libraries. Time is too precious now-a-days, whatever may have been the case of our forefathers, for it to be dissipated by diving into the muddy waters of voluminous authors in hopes of finding an occasional pearl of wisdom.
