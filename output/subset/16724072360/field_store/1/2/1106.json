You are in the vestibule or ante-chamber, to which the spacious entrance of the Cave, and the narrow passage that succeeds it, should be considered the mere gate-way and covered approach. It is a basilica of an oval figure--two-hundred feet in length by one-hundred and fifty wide, with a roof which is as flat and level as if finished by the trowel of the plasterer, of fifty or sixty or even more feet in height. Two passages, each a hundred feet in width, open into it at its opposite extremities, but at right angles to each other; and as they preserve a straight course for five or six-hundred feet, with the same flat roof common to each, the appearance to the eye, is that of a vast hall in the shape of the letter L expanded at the angle, both branches being five-hundred feet long by one-hundred wide. The passage to the right hand is the \"Great Bat Room;\" (Audubon Avenue.) That in the front, the beginning of the Grand Gallery, or the Main Cavern itself. The whole of this prodigious space is covered by a single rock, in which the eye can detect no break or interruption, save at its borders, where is a broad, sweeping cornice, traced in horizontal panel-work, exceedingly noble and regular; and not a single pier or pillar of any kind contributes to support it. It needs no support. It is like the arched and ponderous roof of the poet's mausoleum:      \"By its own weight made stedfast and immoveable.\"  The floor is very irregularly broken, consisting of vast heaps of the nitrous earth, and of the ruins of the hoppers or vats, composed of heavy planking, in which the miners were accustomed to leach it. The hall was, in fact, one of their chief factory rooms. Before their day, it was a cemetery; and here they disinterred many a mouldering skeleton, belonging it seems, to that gigantic eight or nine feet race of men of past days, whose jaw-bones so many vivacious persons have clapped over their own, like horse-collars, without laying by a single one to convince the soul of scepticism.  Such is the vestibule of the Mammoth Cave,--a hall which hundreds of visitors have passed through without being conscious of its existence. The path, leading into the Grand Gallery, hugs the wall on the left hand; and is, besides, in a hollow, flanked on the right hand by lofty mounds of earth, which the visitor, if he looks at them at all, which he will scarcely do, at so early a period after entering, will readily suppose to be the opposite walls. Those who enter the Great Bat Room, (Audubon Avenue,) into which flying visitors are seldom conducted, will indeed have some faint suspicion, for a moment, that they are passing through infinite space; but the walls of the Cave being so dark as to reflect not one single ray of light from the dim torches, and a greater number of them being necessary to disperse the gloom than are usually employed, they will still remain in ignorance of the grandeur around them.  Such is the vestibule of the Mammoth Cave, as described by the ingenious author of \"Calavar,\" \"Peter Pilgrim,\" &c.  From the vestibule we entered Audubon Avenue, which is more than a mile long, fifty or sixty feet wide and as many high. The roof or ceiling exhibits, as you walk along, the appearance of floating clouds--and such is observable in many other parts of the Cave. Near the termination of this avenue, a natural well, twenty-five feet deep, and containing the purest water, has been recently discovered; it is surrounded by stalagmite columns, extending from the floor to the roof, upon the incrustations of which, when lights are suspended, the reflection from the water below and the various objects above and around, gives to the whole scene an appearance equally rare and picturesque. This spot, however, being difficult of access, is but seldom visited.  The Little Bat Room Cave--a branch of Audubon Avenue,--is on the left as you advance, and not more than three-hundred yards from the great vestibule. It is but little more than a quarter of a mile in length, and is remarkable for its pit of two-hundred and eighty feet in depth; and as being the hibernal resort of bats. Tens of thousands of them are seen hanging from the walls, in apparently a torpid state, during the winter, but no sooner does the spring open, than they disappear.  Returning from the Little Bat Room and Audubon Avenue, we pass again through the vestibule, and enter the Main Cave or Grand Gallery. This is a vast tunnel extending for miles, averaging throughout, fifty feet in width by as many in height It is truly a noble subterranean avenue; the largest of which man has any knowledge, and replete with interest, from its varied characteristics and majestic grandeur.  Proceeding down the main Cave about a quarter of a mile, we came to the Kentucky Cliffs, so called from the fancied resemblance to the cliffs on the Kentucky River, and descending gradually about twenty feet entered the church, when our guide was discovered in the _pulpit_ fifteen feet above us, having reached there by a gallery which leads from the cliffs. The ceiling here is sixty three feet high, and the church itself, including the recess, cannot be less than one hundred feet in diameter. Eight or ten feet above and immediately behind the pulpit, is the organ loft, which is sufficiently capacious for an. organ and choir of the largest size. There would appear to be something like design in all this;--here is a church large enough to accomodate thousands, a solid projection of the wall of the Cave to serve as a pulpit, and a few feet back a place for an organ and choir. In this great temple of nature, religious service has been frequently held, and it requires but a slight effort on the part of a speaker, to make himself distinctly heard by the largest congregation.  Sometimes the guides climb up the high and ragged sides, and suspend lamps in the crevices and on the projections of the rock, thus lighting up a scene of wild grandeur and sublimity.  Concerts too have been held here, and the melody of song has been heard, such as would delight the ear of a Catalini or a Malibran.  Leaving the church you will observe, on ascending, a large embankment of lixiviated earth thrown out by the miners more than thirty years ago, the print of wagon wheels and the tracks of oxen, as distinctly defined as though they were made but yesterday; and continuing on for a short distance, you arrive at the Second Hoppers. Here are seen the ruins of the old nitre works, leaching vats, pump frames and two lines of wooden pipes; one to lead fresh water from the dripping spring to the vats filled with the nitrous earth, and the other to convey the lye drawn from the large reservoir, back to the furnace at the mouth of the Cave.  The quantity of nitrous earth contained in the Cave is \"sufficient to supply the whole population of the globe with saltpetre.\"  \"The dirt gives from three to five pounds of nitrate of lime to the bushel, requiring a large proportion of fixed alkali to produce the required crystalization, and when left in the Cave become re-impregnated in three years. When saltpetre bore a high price, immense quantities were manufactured at the Mammoth Cave, but the return of peace brought the saltpetre from the East Indies in competition with the American, and drove that of the produce of our country entirely from the market. An idea may be formed of the extent of the manufacture of saltpetre at this Cave, from the fact that the contract for the supply of the fixed alkali alone for the Cave, for the year 1814, was twenty thousand dollars.\"  \"The price of the article was so high, and the profits of the manufacturer so great, as to set half the western world gadding after nitre caves--the gold mines of the day. Cave hunting in fact became a kind of mania, beginning with speculators, and ending with hair brained young men, who dared for the love of adventure the risk which others ran for profit.\" Every hole, remarked an old miner, the size of a man's body, has been penetrated for miles around the Mammoth Cave, but although we found \"_petre earth_,\" we never could find a cave worth having.     CHAPTER II.  Gothic Gallery--Gothic Avenue--Good Road--Mummies--Interesting Account of Them--Gothic Avenue once called Haunted Chamber--Why so Named-- Adventure of a Miner in Former Days.   In looking from the ruins of the nitre works, to the left and some thirty feet above, you will see a large cave, connected with which is a narrow gallery sweeping across the Main Cave and losing itself in a cave, which is seen above to your right This latter cave is the Gothic Avenue, which no doubt was at one time connected with the cave opposite and on the same level, forming a complete bridge over the main avenue, but afterwards broken down and separated by some great convulsion.  The cave on the left, which is filled with sand, has been penetrated but a short distance; still from its great size at its entrance, it is more than probable, that, were all obstructions removed, it might be found to extend for miles.  [Illustration: ENTRANCE TO THE GOTHIC AVENUE. On Stone by T. Campbell Bauer & Teschemacher's Lith.]  While examining the old saltpetre works, the guide left us without our being aware of it, but casting our eyes around we perceived him standing some forty feet above, on the projection of a huge rock, or tower, which commands a view of the grand gallery to a great extent both up and down.  Leaving the Main Cave and ascending a flight of stairs twenty or thirty feet, we entered the Gothic Avenue, so named from the Gothic appearance of some of its compartments. This avenue is about forty feet wide, fifteen feet high and two miles long. The ceiling looks in many places as smooth and white as though it had been under the trowel of the most skilful plasterer.

Like his predecessor, he printed but a limited number; and as I have more particularly remarked upon the spirit of that version by way of \"Introduction\" to the original letter, in vol. ii. 209, &c. I shall not waste the time of the Reader by any notice of it in the present place. These two partial translators united their forces, about two years afterwards, and published the whole of the Tour, as it related to FRANCE, in four octavo volumes, in 1825. The ordinary copies were sold for 48 francs, the large paper for 112 francs per copy. The wood-cuts only were republished by them. Of this conjoint, and more enlarged production, presently.  Encouraged by the examples of Messrs. Licquet and Crapelet, a Bookbinder of the name of LESNÉ (whose poem upon his \"Craft,\" published in 1820, had been copiously quoted and _commended_ by me in the previous edition) chose to plant his foot within this arena of controversy; and to address a letter to me; to which his model, M. Crapelet, was too happy to give circulation through the medium of his press.[3] To that letter the following metrical lines are prefixed; which the Reader would scarcely forgive me if I failed to amuse him by their introduction in this place. \"_Lesné, Relieur Français, à Mons. T.F. Dibdin, Ministre de la Religion, &c._\"    Avec un ris moqueur, je crois vous voir d'ici,   Dédaigneusement dire: Eh, que veut celui-ci?   Qu'ai-je donc de commun avec un vil artiste?   Un ouvrier français, un _Bibliopégiste_?   Ose-t-on ravaler un Ministre à ce point?   Que me veut ce _Lesné_? Je ne le connais point.     Je crois me souvenir qu'à mon voyage en France,   Avec ses pauvres vers je nouai connaissance.   Mais c'est si peu de chose un poète à Paris!     Savez-vous bien, Monsieur, pourquoi je vous écris?   C'est que je crois avoir le droit de vous écrire.   Fussiez-vous cent fois plus qu'on ne saurait le dire,   Je vois dans un Ministre un homme tel que moi;   Devant Dieu je crois même être l'égal d'un roi.  The Letter however is in prose, with some very few exceptions; and it is just possible that the indulgent Reader may endure a specimen or two of the prose of M. Lesné, as readily as he has that of his poetry. These specimens are equally delectable, of their kind. Immediately after the preceding poetical burst, the French Bibliopegist continues thus:      D'après cet exorde, vous pensez sans doute que, bien convaincu de ma     dignité d'homme, je me crois en droit de vous dire franchement ma     façon de penser; je vous la dirai, Monsieur. Si vous dirigiez un     journal bibliographique; que vous fissiez, en un mot, le métier de     journaliste, je serai peu surpris de voir dans votre Trentième Lettre,     une foule de choses hasardées, de mauvais calembourgs, de     grossièretés, que nous ne rencontrons même pas chez nos journalistes     du dernier ordre, en ce qu'ils savent mieux leur monde, et que s'ils     lancent une epigramme, fût-elle fausse, elle est au moins finement     tournée. Mais vous êtes ANGLAIS, et par cela seul dispensé sans doute     de cette politesse qui distingue si heureusement notre nation de la     vôtre, et que vos compatriotes n'acquièrent pour la plupart qu'après     un long séjour en France.\" p. 6.  Towards the latter part of this most formidable \"Tentamen Criticum,\" the irritable author breaks out thus--\"C'est une maladie Française de vouloir toujours imiter les Anglais; ceux-ci, à leur tour, commencent à en être atteints.\" p. 19. A little farther it is thus: \"Enfin c'est _en imitant_ qu'on reussit presque toujours mal; vous en êtes encore, une preuve évidente. J'ai vu en beaucoup d'endroits de votre Lettre, que vous avez voulu imiter _Sterne_;[4] qu'est-il arrivé? Vous êtes resté au-dessous de lui, comme tous les Imitateurs de nôtre bon La Fontaine sont restés en deçà de l'immortel Fabuliste.\" p. 20. But most especially does the sensitive M. Lesné betray his surprise and apprehension, on a gratuitous supposition--thrown out by me, by way of pleasantry--that \"Mr. Charles Lewis was going over to Paris, to establish there a modern School of Bookbinding.\" M. Lesné thus wrathfully dilates upon this supposition:      \"Je me garderai bien de passer sous silence la dernière partie de     votre Lettre; _un bruit assez étrange est venu jusqu'à vous_; et     Charles Lewis doit vous quitter pour quelque temps pour établir en     France une école de reliure d'apres les principes du gôut anglais;     mais vous croyez, dites-vous, que ce projet est sûrement chimérique,     ou que, si on le tentait, il serait de courte durée.      Pour cette fois, Monsieur, votre pronostic serait très juste; cette     demarche serait une folie: il faudrait s'abuser sur l'engouement des     amateurs français, et ceux qui sont atteints de cette maladie ne sont     pas en assez grand nombre pour soutenir un pareil établissement. Oui,     l'on aime votre genre de reliure; mais on aime les reliures, façon     anglaise, faites par les Français. Pensez-vous done, ou Charles Lewis     pense-t-il, qu'il n'y ait plus d'esprit national en France?        Allez, le sang Française coule encore dans nos veines;       Nous pourrons éprouver des malheurs et des peines,       Que nous devrons peut être à vous autres Anglais;       Mais nous voulons rester, nous resterons, Français!      Ainsi, que Charles Lewis ne se dérange pas; qu'il cesse, s'il les a     commencés, les préparatifs de sa descente; qu'il ne prive pas ses     compatriotes d'un artiste soi-disant inimitable. Nous en avons ici qui     le valent, et qui se feront un plaisir de perpéteur parmi nous le bon     gôut, l'élégance, et la noble simplicité. p. 25.[5]  So much for M. Lesne. I have briefly noticed M. Peignot, the Bibliographer of Dijon. That worthy wight has made the versions of my Ninth and Thirtieth Letters (First Edition) by M.M. Licquet and Crapelet, the substratum of his first brochure entitled _Variétés, Notices et Raretés Bibliographiques_, _Paris_, 1822: it being a supplement to his previous Work of _Curiosités Bibliographiques_.\"[6] It is not always agreeable for an Author to have his Works reflected through the medium of a translation; especially where the Translator suffers a portion, however small, of his _own_ atrabiliousness, to be mixed up with the work translated: nor is it always safe for a third person to judge of the merits of the original through such a medium. Much allowance must therefore be made for M. Peignot; who, to say the truth, at the conclusion of his labours, seems to think that he has waded through a great deal of _dirt_ of some kind or other, which might have been better avoided; and that, in consequence, some general declaration, by way of _wiping, off_ a portion of the adhering mud, is due to the original Author. Accordingly, at the end of his analysis of M. Licquet's version, (which forms the second Letter in the brochure) he does me the honour to devote seven pages to the notice of my humble lucubrations:--and he prefaces this \"_Notice des Ouvrages de M. Dibdin\"_, by the following very handsome tribute to their worth:      Si, dans les deux Lettres où nous avons rendu compte des traductions     partielles du voyage de M.D., nous avons partagé l'opinion des deux     estimable traducteurs, sur quelques erreurs et quelques inconvenances     échappées a l'auteur anglais, nous sommes bien éloigné d'envelopper     dans le même blame, tout ce qui est sorté de sa plume; car il y auroit     injustice a lui refuser des connaissances très étendues en histoire     littéraire, et en bibliographie: nous le disons franchement, il     faudroit fermer les yeux à la lumière, ou être d'une partialité     revoltante, pour ne pas convenir que, juste appréciateur de tous les     trésors bibliographiques qu'il a le bonheur d'avoir sous la main, M.     Dibdin en a fait connoitre en détail toute la richesse dans de     nombreux d'ouvrages, ou très souvent le luxe d'érudition se trouve en     harmonie avec le luxe typographique qu'il y a étalé.  At the risk of incurring the imputation of vanity, I annex the preceding extract; because I am persuaded that the candid Reader will appreciate it in its proper light. I might, had I chosen to do so, have lengthened the extract by a yet more complimentary passage: but enough of M. Peignot--who, so far from suffering ill will or acerbity to predominate over a kind disposition, hath been pleased, since his publication, to write to me a very courteous Letter,[7] and to solicit a \"continuance of my favours.\"  Agreeably to the intimation expressed in a preceding page, I am now, in due order, to notice the labours of my translators M.M. LICQUET and CRAPELET. Their united version appeared in 1825, in four octavo volumes, of which the small paper was but indifferently well printed.[8] The preface to the first two volumes is by M. Licquet: and it is not divested of point and merit. It begins by attacking the _Quarterly Review_, (June 1821, p. 147.) for its severity of animadversion on the supposed listlessness and want of curiosity of the French in exploring the architectural antiquities of their country; and that, in consequence of such supineness, the English, considering them as their own property, have described them accordingly. \"The decision (says the French translator) is severe; happily it is without foundation.\" After having devoted several pages to observations by way of reply to that critical Journal, M. Licquet continues thus:--unless I have unintentionally misrepresented him.      The Englishman who travels in Normandy, meets, at every step, with     reminiscences of his kings, his ancestors, his institutions, and his     customs. Churches yet standing, after the lapse of seven centuries;     majestic ruins; tombs--even to the very sound of the clock--all unite     in affecting, here, the heart of a British subject: every thing seems     to tell him that, in former times, HERE was his country; here the"]]]
