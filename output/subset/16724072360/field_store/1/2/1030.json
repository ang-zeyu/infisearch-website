The two dogs of Billi and the two greyhounds leapt and barked and snapped at the belligerents until Wellington, taking an off-chance, suddenly turned and bit one of them clean through the shoulder; whereupon it yelped and howled and fled, whilst shouts of \"_Ma sha-Allah_\" and much clapping came from the upper windows.  Damaris ran straight towards the man, who, slipping the bridle, put both arms round her to draw her to safety; then, suddenly realising the beauty, the youth and the pure whiteness of her, as suddenly let her go.  \"Shall I separate them?\" he asked simply.  \"No!  Not even if you could.  Once my dog's blood is up, nothing but death will satisfy him.\"  She stood quite still, as white as a sheet, with both hands on his arm, whilst the great dog hurled himself at the spitting brute, only to meet the teeth and claws which drew blood at every attempt, until the ground was crimson where they fought.  And then, with tears streaming down her cheeks, Damaris looked up into the man's face; then buried her face on his shoulder.  And the seed of love which is in the heart of every human burst through, the clogging mould of custom and convention and, taking root, put forth shoots and sprang in one moment into the great tree of love of which the fruits, being those of purity, honour and sacrifice, are golden.  Yet he did not touch her, having learned his lesson; instead, he raised his right hand above his head.  \"Allah!\" he said, in praise of that which had come unto him, \"Allah, there is no God but Thee,\" just as, with a sudden swish, a flock of startled pigeons flashing like jewels in the setting sun new low down across his head, bringing an end to the battle.  For one half-second the jaguar's green eyes shifted, and the dog was at its throat.  There was a mighty, convulsive effort of the hind-legs which ripped the bulldog's sides, a click, a shiver, and the black brute fell dead, as the dog, a mass of blood, foam and pride, hurled himself onto the skirt of his beloved mistress, whilst the enraptured spectators, yelling with excitement, rushed out into the square with shouts of \"_Ma sha-Allah_,\" which means, \"Well done, well done!\"  \"Keep quite still,\" said Hugh Carden Ali, gently, as Damaris made an effort to turn; then, speaking quickly to the beaming, salaaming spectators, who had had the time of their lives gambling on the chances of either animal, ordered them to remove the dead beast and to strew the place with sand.  And \"_Irja Sooltan_,\" he called to the stallion, which, terrified at the sounds and sight and smell of battle, had bolted up a side street, where he stood fretting and fidgeting himself into a fine sweat, until he heard the clear call which could always bring him back to the man he loved.  He stood for one second, then flung up his heels to the devastation of a stall of earthenware, and raced back to the square at a most unseemly pace, causing the spectators once more to fly in all directions with cries of \"U'a u'a,\" which means, \"Look out, look out!\"  He pushed his soft nose with determination against the woman who stood so close to his master, so that she looked up, and then smiled and stretched out her arms.  \"You beauty!\" she cried.  \"Oh, you _beauty_!\"  \"You ride?\"  Damaris, thinking of the hack, the only thing with the shape of a horse she had been able to get so far, and upon the back of which she loathed to be seen, made a grimace.  \"I go out on horseback,\" she said.  \"I have not ridden since I left home.\"  The man's reply, whatever it might have been, was interrupted by Abdul, who, all smiles, stood before them, with the white pigeon in the left hand and the _shahin_ upon his right fist.  The native had no intention of causing the white woman pain; in fact, wishing to find favour in the eyes of the nobles, he only wanted to give them a chance of witnessing a little of, to him, the finest sport in the world.  \"Look, lady!\" he cried.  He tossed the pigeon high into the air, allowed her a little distance, then threw the hawk.  \"No!  Oh, no! don't!\" cried Damaris, as the hawk rose, \"stooped\" and missed the pigeon by a hair's-breadth as it \"put in\", which means that it flew straight into a small niche of a minaret for cover.  \"Ah!\" cried Damaris, and \"_Bi-sma-llah_!\" ejaculated Abdul, as he threw the lure of a dead plover and called his hawk with the luring Eastern call.  \"Coo-coo,\" he called; \"coo-coo,\" to which the hawk responded as a well-trained _shahin_ should.  Hugh Carden Ali stood with his hand on the stallion's mane, looking up at the sky, in which shone a great star.  \"The hawk of Egypt failed,\" he said to himself.  \"Flown at a white bird, it failed.  The House of Allah, who is God, gave sanctuary to the little white bird.  Praise be to Allah who is God.\"  He looked down at the girl, who was kneeling, consoling the dog, who, reft 'tween pride and pain, showed a lamentable countenance.  Suddenly she looked up and rose, and stood silently.  \"Come,\" he said simply, while he longed to pick her up and ride with her to his home in the Oasis.  \"I will take you to your hotel.\"  \"My car is waiting for me in the Sikket el-Gedideh,\" she replied.       *     *     *     *     *  Later, a vision of loveliness, she walked down the dining-room behind the Duchess of Longacres, whilst continuous lamentations were wafted through the spring-doors from the spot where sat a dog with sticking-plaster across his nose and middle girt with a cummerbund of pink boracic lint.  Beside the girl's place lay a huge bunch of crimson roses tied with golden tassels; there was no card, name nor message.  She asked no question, neither did her godmother.  To what purpose should they?  The one _knew_; the other firmly believed in allowing the young to work out the salvation of their own souls; which did not, however, mean that she would not keep a sharp look-out in the future over the troubled sea of Life.  \"I knew something would happen,\" thought the wise old lady, as she passed a biscuit up to the parrot on her shoulder.  \"_Kathir Khairak_,\" it said delightedly.  It merely means \"thank you,\" but had taken weeks of teaching and repeating to master.     CHAPTER III    \"Lor! but women's rum cattle to deal with, the     first man found that to his cost;   And I reckon it's just through a woman, that the     last man on earth'll be lost.\"            G. R. SIMS.   Damaris was the only daughter of Squire Hethencourt.  Her mother was an Italian from the Udino, where the hair of the women is genuine Titian-red and the eyes are blue; which perhaps accounted for her colouring and some part of her temperament.  Her type of beauty was certainly remarkable--given, it must be confessed, to a certain amount of fluctuation--and she danced divinely, which gift must not be counted as a parlour-trick; she was slow in her movements and quiet in her manner until she talked of horses or anybody she loved; then her great eyes would flash and her laugh ring out, also she would gesticulate as her mother had been wont to do, until the climate, maybe, of a northern country had served to repress the spontaneity of her Latin mannerisms.  She was simple and unsophisticated and would have made a splendid little chum, if only one out of every three men who met her had not been consumed with a desire to annex her for life by means of a gold ring.  \"Dads,\" she exclaimed, two months before the beginning of this story, having enticed him to her bedroom one night and offered him cream chocolates as he eat at the foot of her bed, facing her.  \"Dads, what am I to do?  Guy Danvers says he is coming to see you to-morrow, and I--I am sure it will only turn out to be--well--you, know.\"  \"But, Golliwog dear, I'm the one to be pitied.  This makes the--how many is it?\"  \"I don't know, Dads, and it isn't the number; it's the awful _habit_ they've got into--and I don't understand anything and I don't encourage them, do I?  Do lend me a hankie--this chocolate has burst--and what am I to do?\"  \"Turn a deaf ear, or a cold shoulder, or put a brave face on, until------\" said Dads, retrieving his handkerchief.  \"Until what?\"  \"Until the right man comes along, darling, as he surely will.\"  The girl's lids suddenly dropped until the lashes lay like a fringe upon the white cheek over which very slowly but very surely crept the faintest of rose-colours.  \"Hum!\" said Dads to himself, as he made great use of the hankie.  \"Do smoke, dearest!\"  \"No, thank you, pet; I couldn't here.\"  The man who worshipped his wife and adored his little daughter looked round the white and somewhat austere room, and ran his eye over the bookstand at his elbow.  Books on horses, a treatise on bulldogs, the New Testament, essays in French and in German, the History of Egypt in Arabic, Budge's \"Book of the Dead,\" and \"King Solomon's Mines.\"  \"But what am I do _meanwhile_, Dads?\" and the girl threw out her hands imploringly.  \"Be cold, deaf or brave, Golliwog, as I have suggested.\"  \"But I've been all that, and it's quite useless.  Do you think it would help if I let my hair grow and did it up in a tight knob?\"  \"I think it would help a lot if you shaved your head entirely, kiddie.\" And the man leant forward and ran his hand through the red curls.  Once upon a time Damaris had read the advertisement of a certain powder guaranteed to darken hair of any colour, and life having been one long torment owing to her violent colouring, she had, greatly daring, acquired a packet; had followed the directions by mixing the powder with water and covering her head with the muddy result, and, \"to make assurance doubly sure,\" had sat with her clay pate for an hour instead of ten minutes near a fire; had cracked the clay, washed her head, and found her hair grass-green.  She had chopped the verdant masses off without a thought, and had ever after refused to allow it to grow to hairpin length, and to her father only had granted the privilege of calling her by the pet name of Golliwog.  \"Would you like"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15723"],["title","The Rover Boys on Treasure Isle; Or, The Strange Cruise of the Steam Yacht (#1)"],["body","er. \"He vould peen afraid to stay py der United States in, yah!\" And the German boy shook his head wisely.  \"Personally I never want to set eyes on Sobber again,\" said Dick, with a shrug of his broad shoulders. \"The idea of introducing that deadly snake into the school was the limit. Why, half a dozen of us might have been bitten instead of only poor Pell.\"  \"Maybe he did it only for a joke,\" said Larry Colby, another of the cadets.  \"If he did, it was carrying a joke altogether too far--endangering one or more human lives. I don't believe in that sort of fun.\"  \"Nor do I,\" came from several.  \"If he is in Europe with his uncle perhaps I'll meet him there,\" said Larry Colby. \"I am going to France and Italy with my uncle and cousin. Wish some of you fellows were going along,\" he added, wistfully.  \"I am going to the Maine woods,\" said a lad named George Granberry. \"You can never guess who is going there, too.\"  \"Who?\"  \"William Philander Tubbs and Mr. Strong.\"  \"What, our own dude going to camp in the wilderness,\" cried Tom. \"Oh, if I was only along wouldn't I give him some surprises!\"  \"I'll have some fun don't forget that!\" replied George, with a grin. \"But as Mr. Strong is going to be along, of course I'll have to be a little careful.\"  \"Dear Mr. Strong!\" murmured Sam, with a sigh. \"What a fine teacher he is, and how I hate to give him up!\"  \"I envy your having him along,\" said Dick.  At that moment the train rolled into a station and Larry and some of the others got off.  \"We leave you at the next station,\" said Songbird, to the Rovers. \"When you find out what you are going to do this summer, write and let me know.\"  \"I certainly shall,\" answered Dick.  The three Rover boys soon after found themselves alone. They had to make a change of cars, and some time later rolled into the station at Oak Run.  \"Home again!\" shouted Tom, as he alighted on the depot platform.  \"Yes, and there is Uncle Randolph waiting for us,\" added Dick, as he hurried forward to meet his relative. \"How do you do, Uncle!\" he cried.  \"I am well, Richard,\" answered Randolph Rover, and then he shook hands with all three boys. \"Your--er--your father--\" he began and hesitated.  \"Father? What of him?\" asked Tom, in quick alarm, for he saw that his uncle was much disturbed.  \"Isn't he with you?\"  \"Why, no!\" answered the three, in a chorus.  \"He started for home last night,\" added Dick.  \"Took the train after the one you and Aunt Martha took.\"  \"But he didn't come home,\" said Randolph Rover.  \"Didn't come home?\"  \"No.\"  \"Didn't he send any word?\" questioned Sam.  \"None that I received.\"  \"He said he was going straight home would telephone from Lockville for the carriage to meet the last train,\" said Tom. \"This is mighty queer.\"  It was queer and for the moment the Rover boys and their uncle stared blankly at one another.  \"Something is wrong,\" declared Dick, presently. \"And I am going to make it my business to find out at once what it is.\"     CHAPTER II  AN IMPORTANT TELEGRAM   Dick Rover would not have been so much disturbed by his father's disappearance had it not been for one thing, which was that Mr. Rover, on leaving the closing exercises at Putnam Hall, had declared that he would take the last train home that night. This train got into Oak Run at one o'clock in the morning, when the station was closed and the platform usually deserted.  \"Let us ask around and see if anybody was here when the train came in,\" suggested Tom.  They first appealed to Mr. Ricks, the station master, an old and crabbed individual, who disliked the boys for the jokes they had played on him in times past. He shook his head at once.  \"Don't keep the station open that long,\" he grunted. \"I was home an' in bed, an' I don't know anything about your father.\"  \"Was anybody around the station, that you know of?\" went on Dick.  \"No.\"  \"Did any telegram come in for our family?\"  \"If it did I reckon Jackson would send it over, or telephone.\"  \"Let us ask Jackson and make sure,\" said Sam, and led the way to the telegraph office. The telegraph receiver was ticking away at a lively rate, and Jackson, who had charge of the office, was taking down a message on a blank.  \"Hullo!\" cried the telegrapher, as he finished and looked up. \"Here is a message for Mr. Randolph Rover hot off the wire. It won't take long to deliver it,\" and he handed it over. \"It's paid for,\" he added. \"But you'll have to sign for it,\" and Mr. Rover did so.  Eagerly all the Rovers read the communication, which ran as follows:  \"Am following man I want to catch if possible. May be away from home several days or a week. Very important to see man--trip this summer depends upon it.  \"ANDERSON ROVER.\"  \"Wonder who the man can be?\" mused Dick, after reading the message twice.  \"He has something to do with this matter father was going to tell us about,\" returned Sam. \"It's certainly a mystery.\"  \"Well, this relieves our anxiety,\" said Randolph Rover. \"So long as I know nothing has happened, your father can stay away as long as, he pleases.\"  \"But I am dying to know what it is all about,\" burst out Tom, who was always impatient to get at the bottom of things. \"Uncle Randolph, do you know what father has in mind to do this summer?\"  \"He talks about taking a sea trip, but where to I don't know.\"  \"And he wants us to go along?\" queried the youngest Rover.  \"I believe so, Samuel.\"  \"Hurrah! I'd like a sea trip first rate.\"  \"Yes, but--\" Mr. Rover lowered his voice. \"He doesn't want anybody to know where to. It's some kind of a secret--very important, I imagine --something to do with a gold mine, or something of the sort. He did not give me any particulars.\"  \"He said he was going to let us know about it when we got home from the Hall,\" said Dick. \"I hope he catches his man.\"  \"Wonder who it can be?\" came from Tom.  Nobody could answer that question, and in a thoughtful mood the three Rover boys followed their uncle to the carriage and got in. Then the team was touched up and away they whirled, out of the village, across Swift River, and in the direction of Valley Brook farm.  It was a beautiful day in June and never had the country looked finer. As they swept along the well kept road Dick drew a deep breath of satisfaction.  \"This air makes a fellow feel new all over!\" he declared.  \"I suppose you are going to plant and grow some wonderful things this summer, Uncle Randolph,\" said Tom. His uncle had studied scientific farming for years, but had never made any tremendous success of it in fact his experiments usually cost him considerably more than they brought in.  \"Well--er--I am trying my hand this year on some Mexican melons said to be very fine, Thomas,\" was the reply.  \"Mexican melons?\" said the fun-loving Tom, innocently. \"That puts me in mind when I was over to Albany last I saw a pumpkin in a restaurant window eight feet high and at least ten feet across.\"  \"Is it possible!\" ejaculated Randolph Rover, gazing at his nephew incredulously.  \"Sure thing. The pumpkin looked to be good, too. They had a lot of pumpkin pies set around it, just for an advertisement.\"  \"Thomas, did you measure that pumpkin?\"  \"No; why should I?\"  \"Then how do you know it was eight feet high and ten feet across?\"  \"Why, Uncle Randolph, I didn't say the pumpkin was eight feet high and ten feet across. I said I saw it in a restaurant window eight feet high and ten feet across,\" and Tom drew down the corners of his mouth soberly.  \"Tom, that's the worst ever!\" cried Sam.  \"You ought to be made to walk home for that,\" added Dick.  \"Thomas! Thomas! you are as bad as ever!\" said Mr. Rover, with a sigh. \"But I might have been on my guard. I know there are no pumpkins of that size.\"  \"Uncle Randolph, you'll have to forgive me,\" said Tom, putting his hand affectionately on his relative's shoulder. \"I really couldn't help it--I am just bubbling over to think that school days are over and I won't have to do any studying for several months to come.\"  \"I fancy we'll have to tie you down to keep you out of mischief.\"  \"You won't have to tie me down if I go on a sea trip with dad.\"  \"Haven't you had sea trips enough with being cast away in the middle of the Pacific, and being wrecked in the Gulf of Mexico? It seems to me every time you and the others leave home something serious happens to you.\"  \"True but we always come back right side up with care and all charges paid,\" answered the fun-loving Rover airily.  They soon made a turn in the road which brought them in sight of the big farmhouse, nestling comfortably in a group of stately trees. As they turned into the lane their Aunt Martha came to the front piazza and waved her hand. Down in the roadway stood Jack Ness; the hired man, grinning broadly, and behind Mrs. Rover stood Alexander Pop, the colored helper, his mouth open from ear to ear. At once Tom began to sing:  \"Home again! home again! Safe from Putnam Hall.\"  And then he made a flying leap from the carriage, rushed up the steps and gave his aunt such a hug as made her gasp for breath.  \"Oh, Tom, you bear! Do let up!\" she cried. \"Now, there's a kiss for you, and there's another! How do you do, Sam, and how are you, Dick?\" And she kissed them also. \"I am glad you are back at last.\" She turned to her husband \"What of Anderson, did you hear anything?\"  \"Yes, he will be back in a few days.\"  \"I'se jess too pleased fo' anything to see yo' boys back heah!\" came from Aleck Pop. \"It's dun been mighty lonely since yo' went away.\"  \"Don't worry, Aleck, we'll cheer you up,\" answered Tom.  \"Oh, I know dat, Massa Tom yo'll turn dis place upside down in two days suah!\"  \"Why, Aleck, you know I'd never do anything so rash,\" answered Tom, meekly.  \"Going to uncover some more freight thieves?\" asked Jack Ness, as he took charge of the team and started for the barn.  \"I think dem boys had bettah cotch some of dem chicken thieves,\" put in Aleck Pop. \"Yo' don't seem to git holt ob dem nohow.\"  \"Oh, never you mind about the chicken thieves,\" grumbled Jack Ness.  \"Ha"]]]
