After these girders \"C\" were in place it was necessary to remove the temporary shoring girders before the bents could be erected on girders \"C\" to support girders \"B,\" being in the same plane; and provision had to be made to support the structure while this was being done. Therefore, double bents were erected directly beneath the columns, as shown by Figs. 2, 4, and 5, and by Fig. 3, Plate XLVII. These were built with their sills resting on the girders \"C,\" and blocking was put in between the sills and the rock to carry the full weight of the structure. Later, when the weight of the structure was carried on the permanent bents, this blocking was knocked out, but the bents were left in to carry the weight of the column itself, which was swinging more or less from the structure above. The weight of the structure was placed on these bents directly beneath the columns by jacking up the temporary girders again, putting blocking between the bents and the base of the columns, and taking out the blocking which had been put in previously under the temporary shoring girders. The 24-in. water main was carried over the excavation on cables from the temporary shoring girders, except when they were being jacked up, at which time posts were placed beneath it.  Anchor-bolts were put in place between the column bases and the bents directly beneath, in order to increase the lateral stiffness, and raker braces were also used. This having been done, the temporary shoring girders were moved south to the next column, where the process was repeated. The timber bents, shown in detail by Fig. 2, were then put in place as shown by Figs. 4 and 5, and by Fig. 3, Plate XLVII. These bents were framed as tightly as possible, using generally a 20-ton jack, and they were erected simultaneously at each pair of columns. The weight was taken on these columns by jacking up directly beneath the column base and taking out the blocking between this base and the bent directly beneath the column. On releasing the jack the weight was transferred to the permanent timber bents, and the east and west columns of each pair were transferred on the same day. One 80-ton jack was used on the easterly columns and two were necessary on the westerly columns, one on each side of the 24-in. water main. The raker braces of these permanent bents were not framed as tightly as the main posts, in order that the main post should carry the entire weight and the raker braces merely steady the structure.  Timber bents were erected on girders \"C\" to carry the I-beams under the surface railway structure, as shown on Fig. 3, and all temporary posts under these I-beams were removed. The bents were framed with a jack, as tightly as possible, and very little settlement of the track occurred.  A cradle was then built under the 24-in. water main and placed on girders \"C,\" and, as a temporary footwalk had been constructed on the west side of the avenue, it will be seen that all structures were thus carried on girders \"C.\"  All structures were put on the girders \"C\" before continuing the excavation on the sides of the avenue because, in case of a slide of rock, there would be less danger than to individual structures. The outside piers, on which the girders \"C\" rested, might even be lost, without affecting the stability of the structure, and posting could readily be done beneath these girders in case of necessity.  A very careful record of levels, taken on the elevated railway columns, was kept, observations being made during each jacking up and at least twice a week during the progress of the work. The columns were usually kept about 1/2 in. high so as to allow for compression in the timber bents.  As a rule, no jacking of the elevated railway structure was done while trains were passing over, and trains were flagged during the operation. There was generally very little delay, as all jacking was done between 10.30 A.M. and 2.30 P.M., when the traffic was lightest, and frequently the jacking was done between trains, causing no delay whatever. Steel clamps were placed, three on the top and three on the bottom of each set of the girders \"C,\" to bind them together and cause them to act as a unit.  All structures then being supported on girders \"C,\" which were carried on four concrete piers resting on the central rock core, the excavation on the sides of the avenue was continued down to sub-grade and the east and west portions of the concrete north abutment were constructed. The central rock core was about 36 ft. wide on the top and 45 ft. wide on the bottom, and at the center of 32d Street it was about 42 ft. high.  It was the original intention to excavate a sufficient width of the sides of the avenue to erect six rows of the permanent steel viaduct, 5 ft. from center to center, and this was done on the south portion of the work. On the north portion, however, the rock was of poor quality, and it was thought best to excavate for only five rows at first, to erect the five rows of permanent steel and put the timber bents in place under the ends of the girders \"C,\" in order to give them some support while the outside concrete piers were being removed and the excavation was being widened out to permit the erection of the sixth row. Additional raker braces were put in these bents temporarily, and were removed when the sixth row of steel had been erected. This is shown on Figs. 4 and 5.

Fig. 1, Plate XLVIII, shows also the easterly portion of the concrete north abutment. Fig. 2, Plate XLVIII, shows five rows of the permanent viaduct girders erected on the east side of the work.  The excavation of the sides of the avenue having been completed, and six rows of permanent viaduct girders erected on both sides, timber bents, as shown on Figs. 2, 4, 5, and 6, were erected on this steel to support the ends of the girders \"C\" and carry the structure while the rock core was being excavated. Fig. 3, Plate XLVIII, shows the method of taking the weight on these bents. Four 80-ton jacks were used, and oak blocks were placed on the top of each jack to transmit pressure to a temporary oak cap under the girders \"C\" independent of the bents; all four of these jacks were operated simultaneously, and the girders \"C\" were lifted off the bents and clear of the concrete piers. Oak filling pieces were then inserted between the bents and the girders \"C,\" so that when the jacks were released the girders \"C\" were clear of the concrete piers. Fig. 3, Plate XLVIII, shows that the girders have been lifted off the piers. Elevations were taken on each set of girders during each operation, and careful observations were made on the elevated railway columns. Where the rock was very close to these bents, the open space between the posts was filled with blocking so that there would be less danger of the bent shifting if struck by blasted materials. Fig. 3, Plate XLVIII, shows one of these bents filled with blocking.  All structures being carried on girders \"C,\" which, in turn, were carried on the sides of the permanent viaduct, the central core was excavated. Fig. 4, Plate XLVIII, and Figs. 1, 2, 3, and 4, Plate XLIX, show various views of the work at this stage.  The central portion of the viaduct was then erected, and, using concrete piers and timber bents, all structures were placed on its deck. Fig. 3, Plate XLIX, shows the piers under the elevated railway columns prior to the removal of girders \"C.\"  [Illustration: FIG. 6. (Full page image)  GENERAL ARRANGEMENT OF TEMPORARY AND PERMANENT STRUCTURES]  During the latter part of 1908 a 48-in. cast-iron water main was laid by the city on a cradle built by the Railroad Company on girders \"C\" on the east side of the avenue. This is part of the high-pressure system, and the location and elevation of this water main were taken into consideration when the underpinning was designed. This main, and the 48-in. cast-iron sewer bracketed to girders \"C,\" are shown on Fig. 4, Plate XLVIII.  Elevations had been taken on marks on the elevated railway columns between 30th and 34th Streets at the time the original surveys were made, in 1902, and these marks were used to test the level of the structure during the progress of the excavation.  At the extreme south end of the work the procedure was changed. The east side was excavated down to sub-grade, the east portion of the south abutment was constructed, and six rows of the permanent steel viaduct were erected. Very little excavation had been done on the west side of the avenue at the south end of the work, and it would have delayed the completion of the work to have waited for the excavation for and the construction of the west portion of the south abutment and the erection of the steel; therefore, instead of supporting the girders \"C\" on the central rock core, the east ends were taken up on the permanent viaduct girders, and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17306"],["title","The Condition of the Working-Class in England in 1844 (#1)"],["body"," the workers.  When I received, in 1886, the American papers with accounts of the great strike of 12,000 Pennsylvanian coal-miners in the Connellsville district, I seemed but to read my own description of the North of England colliers' strike of 1844.  The same cheating of the workpeople by false measure; the same truck-system; the same attempt to break the miners' resistance by the capitalists' last, but crushing, resource,--the eviction of the men out of their dwellings, the cottages owned by the companies.  I have not attempted, in this translation, to bring the book up to date, or to point out in detail all the changes that have taken place since 1844.  And for two reasons: Firstly, to do this properly, the size of the book must be about doubled; and, secondly, the first volume of \"Das Kapital,\" by Karl Marx, an English translation of which is before the public, contains a very ample description of the state of the British working-class, as it was about 1865, that is to say, at the time when British industrial prosperity reached its culminating point.  I should, then, have been obliged again to go over the ground already covered by Marx's celebrated work.  It will be hardly necessary to point out that the general theoretical standpoint of this book--philosophical, economical, political--does not exactly coincide with my standpoint of to-day.  Modern international Socialism, since fully developed as a science, chiefly and almost exclusively through the efforts of Marx, did not as yet exist in 1844.  My book represents one of the phases of its embryonic development; and as the human embryo, in its early stages, still reproduces the gill-arches of our fish-ancestors, so this book exhibits everywhere the traces of the descent of modern Socialism from one of its ancestors,--German philosophy.  Thus great stress is laid on the dictum that Communism is not a mere party doctrine of the working-class, but a theory compassing the emancipation of society at large, including the capitalist class, from its present narrow conditions.  This is true enough in the abstract, but absolutely useless, and sometimes worse, in practice.  So long as the wealthy classes not only do not feel the want of any emancipation, but strenuously oppose the self-emancipation of the working-class, so long the social revolution will have to be prepared and fought out by the working-class alone.  The French bourgeois of 1789, too, declared the emancipation of the bourgeoisie to be the emancipation of the whole human race; but the nobility and clergy would not see it; the proposition--though for the time being, with respect to feudalism, an abstract historical truth--soon became a mere sentimentalism, and disappeared from view altogether in the fire of the revolutionary struggle.  And to-day, the very people who, from the \"impartiality\" of their superior standpoint, preach to the workers a Socialism soaring high above their class interests and class struggles, and tending to reconcile in a higher humanity the interests of both the contending classes--these people are either neophytes, who have still to learn a great deal, or they are the worst enemies of the workers,--wolves in sheeps' clothing.  The recurring period of the great industrial crisis is stated in the text as five years.  This was the period apparently indicated by the course of events from 1825 to 1842.  But the industrial history from 1842 to 1868 has shown that the real period is one of ten years; that the intermediate revulsions were secondary, and tended more and more to disappear.  Since 1868 the state of things has changed again, of which more anon.  I have taken care not to strike out of the text the many prophecies, amongst others that of an imminent social revolution in England, which my youthful ardour induced me to venture upon.  The wonder is, not that a good many of them proved wrong, but that so many of them have proved right, and that the critical state of English trade, to be brought on by Continental and especially American competition, which I then foresaw--though in too short a period--has now actually come to pass.  In this respect I can, and am bound to, bring the book up to date, by placing here an article which I published in the _London Commonweal_ of March 1, 1885, under the heading: \"England in 1845 and in 1885.\"  It gives at the same time a short outline of the history of the English working-class during these forty years, and is as follows:     \"Forty years ago England stood face to face with a crisis, solvable to    all appearances by force only.  The immense and rapid development of    manufactures had outstripped the extension of foreign markets and the    increase of demand.  Every ten years the march of industry was    violently interrupted by a general commercial crash, followed, after a    long period of chronic depression, by a few short years of prosperity,    and always ending in feverish over-production and consequent renewed    collapse.  The capitalist class clamoured for Free Trade in corn, and    threatened to enforce it by sending the starving population of the    towns back to the country districts whence they came, to invade them,    as John Bright said, not as paupers begging for bread, but as an army    quartered upon the enemy.  The working masses of the towns demanded    their share of political power--the People's Charter; they were    supported by the majority of the small trading class, and the only    difference between the two was whether the Charter should be carried    by physical or by moral force.  Then came the commercial crash of 1847    and the Irish famine, and with both the prospect of revolution     \"The French Revolution of 1848 saved the English middle-class.  The    Socialistic pronunciamentos of the victorious French workmen    frightened the small middle-class of England and disorganised the    narrower, but more matter-of-fact movement of the English    working-class.  At the very moment when Chartism was bound to assert    itself in its full strength, it collapsed internally, before even it    collapsed externally on the 10th of April, 1848.  The action of the    working-class was thrust into the background.  The capitalist class    triumphed along the whole line.     \"The Reform Bill of 1831 had been the victory of the whole capitalist    class over the landed aristocracy.  The repeal of the Corn Laws was    the victory of the manufacturing capitalist not only over the landed    aristocracy, but over those sections of capitalists, too, whose    interests were more or less bound up with the landed    interest,--bankers, stock-jobbers, fund-holders, etc.  Free Trade    meant the re-adjustment of the whole home and foreign, commercial and    financial policy of England in accordance with the interests of the    manufacturing capitalists--the class which now represented the nation.    And they set about this task with a will.  Every obstacle to    industrial production was mercilessly removed.  The tariff and the    whole system of taxation were revolutionised.  Everything was made    subordinate to one end, but that end of the utmost importance to the    manufacturing capitalist: the cheapening of all raw produce, and    especially of the means of living of the working-class; the reduction    of the cost of raw material, and the keeping down--if not as yet the    _bringing down_--of wages.  England was to become the 'workshop of the    world;' all other countries were to become for England what Ireland    already was,--markets for her manufactured goods, supplying her in    return with raw materials and food.  England the great manufacturing    centre of an agricultural world, with an ever-increasing number of    corn and cotton-growing Irelands revolving around her, the industrial    sun.  What a glorious prospect!     \"The manufacturing capitalists set about the realisation of this their    great object with that strong common sense and that contempt for    traditional principles which has ever distinguished them from their    more narrow-minded compeers on the Continent.  Chartism was dying out.    The revival of commercial prosperity, natural after the revulsion of    1847 had spent itself, was put down altogether to the credit of Free    Trade.  Both these circumstances had turned the English working-class,    politically, into the tail of the 'great Liberal party,' the party led    by the manufacturers.  This advantage, once gained, had to be    perpetuated.  And the manufacturing capitalists, from the Chartist    opposition, not to Free Trade, but to the transformation of Free Trade    into the one vital national question, had learnt, and were learning    more and more, that the middle-class can never obtain full social and    political power over the nation except by the help of the    working-class.  Thus a gradual change came over the relations between    both classes.  The Factory Acts, once the bugbear of all    manufacturers, were not only willingly submitted to, but their    expansion into acts regulating almost all trades, was tolerated.    Trades' Unions, hitherto considered inventions of the devil himself,    were now petted and patronised as perfectly legitimate institutions,    and as useful means of spreading sound economical doctrines amongst    the workers.  Even strikes, than which nothing had been more nefarious    up to 1848, were now gradually found out to be occasionally very    useful, especially when provoked by the masters themselves, at their    own time.  Of the legal enactments, placing the workman at a lower    level or at a disadvantage with regard to the master, at least the    most revolting were repealed.  And, practically, that horrid 'People's    Charter' actually became the political programme of the very    manufacturers who had opposed it to the last.  'The Abolition of the    Property Qualification' and 'Vote by Ballot' are now the law of the    land.  The Reform Acts "]]]
