Ned listened in silence and unbelief, while the gloom outside deepened, and night presently came over Anahuac. But he had formed his resolution. He owed much to Mr. Austin. He had come a vast distance to be at his side, and to serve him in prison, but he felt now that he could be of more use elsewhere. Moreover, he must carry a message, a warning to those who needed it sorely. One of the windows opened upon the north, and he looked intently through it trying to pierce, with the mind's eye at least, the thousand miles that lay between him and those whom he would reach with the word.  Mr. Austin had lighted a candle. Noticing the boy's gloomy face, he patted him on the head with a benignant hand and said:  \"Don't be down of heart, Edward, my lad. We'll soon be on our way to Texas.\"  \"But this is Mexico, and it is Santa Anna who holds us.\"  \"That is true, and it is Santa Anna who is our best friend.\"  Ned did not dispute the sanguine saying. He saw that Mr. Austin had his opinion, and he had his. The door was opened again in a half hour and a soldier brought them their supper. Young de Zavala, who was their immediate guardian, also entered and stood by while they ate. They had never received poor food, and to-night Mexican hospitality exerted itself--at the insistence of Santa Anna, Ned surmised. In addition to the regular supper there was an ice and a bottle of Spanish wine.  \"The President has just given an order that the greatest courtesy be shown to you at all times,\" said de Zavala, \"and I am very glad. I, too, have people in that territory of ours from which you come--Texas.\"  He spoke with undeniable sympathy, and Ned felt his heart warm toward him, but he decided to say nothing. He feared that he might betray by some chance word the plan that he had in mind. But Mr. Austin, believing in others because he was so truthful and honest himself, talked freely.  \"All our troubles will soon be over,\" he said to de Zavala.  \"I hope so, Señor,\" said the young man earnestly.  By and by, when de Zavala and the soldier were gone, Ned went again to the window, stood there a few moments to harden his resolution, and then came back to the man.  \"Mr. Austin,\" he said, \"I am going to ask your consent to something.\"  The Texan looked up in surprise.  \"Why, Edward, my lad,\" he said kindly, \"you don't have to ask my consent to anything, after the way in which you have already sacrificed yourself for me.\"  \"But I am not going to stay with you any longer, Mr. Austin--that is, if I can help it. I am going back to Texas.\"  Mr. Austin laughed. It was a mellow and satisfied laugh.  \"So you are, Edward,\" he said, \"and I am going with you. You will help me to bear a message of peace and safety to the Texans.\"  Ned paused a moment, irresolute. There was no change in his determination. He was merely uncertain about the words to use.  \"There may be delays,\" he said at last, \"and--Mr. Austin, I have decided to go alone--and within the next day or two if I can.\"  The Texan's face clouded.  \"I cannot understand you,\" he said. \"Why this hurry? It would in reality be a breach of faith to our great friend, Santa Anna--that is, if you could go. I don't believe you can.\"  Ned was troubled. He was tempted to tell what was in his mind, but he knew that he would not be believed, so he fell back again upon his infinite capacity for silence. Mr. Austin read resolution in the closed lips and rigid figure.  \"Do you really mean that you will attempt to steal away?\" he asked.  \"As soon as I can.\"  The man shook his head.  \"It would be better not to do so,\" he said, \"but you are your own master, and I see I cannot dissuade you from the attempt. But, boy, you will promise me not to take any unnecessary or foolish risks?\"  \"I promise gladly, and, Mr. Austin, I hate to leave you here.\"  Their quarters were commodious and Ned slept alone in a small room to the left of the main apartment. It was a bare place with only a bed and a chair, but it was lighted by a fairly large window. Ned examined this window critically. It had a horizontal iron bar across the middle, and it was about thirty feet from the ground. He pulled at the iron bar with both hands but, although rusty with time, it would not move in its socket. Then he measured the two spaces between the bar and the wall.  Hope sprang up in the boy's heart. Then he did a strange thing. He removed nearly all his clothing and tried to press his head and shoulders between the bar and the wall. His head, which was of the long narrow type, so common in the scholar, would have gone through the aperture, had it not been for his hair which was long, and which grew uncommonly thick. His shoulders were very thick and broad and they, too, halted him. He drew back and felt a keen thrill of disappointment.  But he was a boy who usually clung tenaciously to an idea, and, sitting down, he concentrated his mind upon the plan that he had formed. By and by a possible way out came to him. Then he lay down upon the bed, drew a blanket over him because the night was chill in the City of Mexico, and calmly sought sleep.     CHAPTER II  A HAIR-CUT   The optimism of Mr. Austin endured the next morning, but Ned was gloomy. Since it was his habit to be silent, the man did not notice it at first. The breakfast was good, with tortillas, frijoles, other Mexican dishes and coffee, but the boy had no appetite. He merely picked at his food, made a faint effort or two to drink his coffee and finally put the cup back almost full in the saucer. Then Mr. Austin began to observe.  \"Are you ill, Ned?\" he asked. \"Is this imprisonment beginning to tell upon you? I had thought that you were standing it well. Can't you eat?\"  \"I don't believe I'm hungry,\" replied the boy, \"but there is nothing else the matter with me. I'll be all right, Uncle Steve. Don't you bother about me.\"  He ate a little breakfast, about one half of the usual amount, and then, asking to be excused, went to the window, where he again stared out at the tiled roofs, the green foliage in the valley of Mexico and the ranges and peaks beyond. He was taking his resolution, and he was carrying it out, but it was hard, very hard. He foresaw that he would have to strengthen his will many, many times. Mr. Austin took no further worry on Ned's account, thinking that he would be all right again in a day or two.  But at the dinner which was brought to them in the middle of the day Ned showed a marked failure of appetite, and Mr. Austin felt real concern. The boy, however, was sure that he would be all right before the day was over.  \"It must be the lack of fresh air and exercise,\" said Mr. Austin. \"You can really take exercise in here, Ned. Besides, you said that you were going to escape. If you fall ill you will have no chance at all.\"  He spoke half in jest, but Ned took him seriously.  \"I am not ill, Uncle Steve,\" he said. \"I really feel very well, but I have lost my appetite. Maybe I am getting tired of these Mexican dishes.\"  \"Take exercise! take exercise!\" said Mr. Austin with emphasis.  \"I think I will,\" said Ned.  Physical exercise, after all, fitted in with his ideas, and that afternoon he worked hard at all the gymnastic feats possible within the three rooms to which they were confined. De Zavala came in and expressed his astonishment at the athletic feats, which Ned continued with unabated zeal despite his presence.  \"Why do you do these things?\" he asked in wonder.  \"To keep myself strong and healthy. I ought to have begun them sooner. The Mexican air is depressing, and I find that I am losing my appetite.\"  De Zavala's eyes opened wide while Ned deftly turned a handspring. Then the young American sat down panting, his face flushed with as healthy a color as one could find anywhere.  \"You'll have an appetite to-night,\" said Mr. Austin. But to his great amazement Ned again played with his food, eating only half the usual amount.  \"You're surely ill,\" said Mr. Austin. \"I've no doubt de Zavala would allow us to have a physician, and I shall ask him for one.\"  \"Don't do it, Uncle Steve,\" begged Ned. \"There's nothing at all the matter with me, and anyhow I wouldn't want a Mexican doctor fussing over me. I've probably been eating too much.\"  Mr. Austin was forced to accede. The boy certainly did not look ill, and his appetite was bound to become normal again in a few days. But it did not. As far as Mr. Austin could measure it, Ned was eating less and less. It was obvious that he was thinner. He was also growing much paler, except for a red flush on the cheek bones. Mr. Austin became alarmed, but Ned obstinately refused any help, always asserting with emphasis that he had no ailment of any kind. But the man could see that he had become much lighter, and he wondered at the boy's physical failure. De Zavala, also, expressed his sorrow in sonorous Spanish, but Ned, while thanking them, steadily disclaimed any need of sympathy.  The boy found the days hard, but the nights were harder. For the first time in his life he could not sleep well. He would lie for hours so wide awake that his eyes grew used to the dark, and he could see everything in his room. He was troubled, too, by bad dreams and in many of these dreams he was a living skeleton, wandering about and condemned to live forever without food. More than once he bitterly regretted the resolution he had taken, but having taken it, he would never alter it. His silent, concentrated nature would not let him. Yet he endured undoubted torture day by day. Torture was the only name for it.  \"I shall send an application to President Santa Anna to have you allowed a measure of liberty,\" said Mr. Austin finally. \"You are simply pining away here, Edward, my lad. You cannot eat, that is, you eat only a little. I have passed the most tempting and delicate things to you and you always refuse. No boy of your age would do so unless"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15861"],["title","The Things Which Remain (#1)"],["body","with this power, said: \"There is an impassable gulf between anthropomorphism, however refined and the passionless impersonality underlying the thin veil of phenomena. I can not see one tittle of evidence that the great unknown stands to us in the light of a Father.\" Nor could he. Religious truth is conditioned in a way in which the apprehension of physical truth is not. There must be a certain condition of the heart, conscience, and will to see the truth of the Godhead of Christ. One may resist this evidence.[2] Only a living Christian is competent to look at the subject--\"unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God.\" In physics \"nothing is needed but open eyes and a sound understanding.\"[3] Moral character has nothing to do with it, except as vice may affect vision and deteriorate the judgment. But in a soul's relation to the Christian religion, the ethical element is that which is fundamental. \"The pure in heart shall see God.\" The foul soul has no vision for the eternal purities. In the days of idolatry \"there was no open vision.\" So in the heart of sin there is no light of spiritual truth. The higher verities appear fully founded to the Christian consciousness only.  [Footnote 2: Cf. Denney.]  [Footnote 3: Cf. Denney.]  [Sidenote: Natural Ethical Canon.]  Yet, let us remember that below this Christian consciousness lie the substrata of reason and ethical canon common to all men. Religious truth rests on these in its first revelations. Above the first and simplest revelation, truth rests on Christian experience as to those matters for which reason and natural ethical canon are insufficient.  [Sidenote: General Calm of Methodist Episcopal Church.]  [Sidenote: Wesley's Advanced Views.]  This having been the teaching of the Methodist Episcopal Church from the beginning, she has been little disturbed by the critical school. While holding that the Bible is the sole rule of faith, she has not committed herself to any one theory of inspiration. She has not believed the Scriptures because they are written, but, being written, she has found them true. She has believed in the supernatural power of the Gospel because in her sight its leaven has wrought in the individual and in society what it claims for itself. John Wesley believed that there were God-breathed teachings outside of the Bible. He believed this because of his feeling that the Divine Fatherhood must have spoken to other than His Jewish children. Inheriting from our founder these thoughts, we have kept a high degree of calm in these later days of inquiry and doubt.  [Sidenote: Wide Range of Unbelief.]  [Sidenote: Natural Immortality.]  [Sidenote: Reward and Punishments.]  We have already admitted that the present tendency to unbelief has wider range and fresher foundations than our fathers knew. The belief in the natural immortality of the human soul whether of Platonic or Christian origin is shaken to an extent not known in a century. The doubts of Huxley, the denials of Hæckel had a purely scientific basis. The suspension of consciousness by sleep, by accident, by drugs, the decay of mind by old age and by disease are freely put forth as proofs that mind can not exist without the mechanism which supports and manifests it. If this last be true a doctrine fundamental to Christianity must be abandoned. The doctrine of immortality through Christ does not meet the new objections. The scheme of redemption and the doctrine of future rewards and punishments are involved in the fate of the doctrine of natural immortality. We have thus shadows of doubt thrown upon two great doctrines, the virgin birth of Christ and natural immortality. The miracles, Resurrection, and Ascension must be added to the shadowed list.  [Sidenote: Some Influential Facts.]  [Sidenote: A Great Mistake.]  [Sidenote: Doctored Heathenism.]  Whatever relation the fact may have as a cause, it is noteworthy that as to time, this new era of doubt largely coincides as to its beginning with the movement to revise the New Testament. The variations of the manuscripts, the interpretations, the comparatively late date of the oldest manuscripts were before this in possession of scholars only. The daily press have made them the possession of the Christian world. The shock to traditional confidence through this was very great. The Congress of Religions at Chicago had a similar effect. The mistaken liberality which permitted Christianity to appear on the same platform with the ethnic and imperfect religions contributed largely to doctrinal indifference. The taking and uncandid misrepresentations of these religions convinced many that there was at least no better foundation for Christianity and no better content therein than for and in the false and imperfect faiths. Many of these were defended by men who had had an English education and had come into contact with Christian vocabulary and civilization. They did not hesitate to read into these religions ideas wholly Christian and wholly foreign to the original teachings.  [Sidenote: What Remains?]  These and other considerations lead me to ask what remains that we may and do believe? While far from admitting as finally proved the radical conclusions reached by some as to authorship and inspiration of the Bible and Divine authority for doctrines deduced therefrom, it must be profitable for us to ask, \"What remains if some of these conclusions stand?\"  Recall that I do not admit all these for a moment, or any of them as final. Some are probably true. But taking the worst and most iconoclastic as true, are we compelled even then to surrender our Christian faith?  [Sidenote: The Apostles' Creed.]  Let us take the separate articles of the Apostles' Creed and see how they stand affected:  [Sidenote: The Fatherhood of God.]  \"I believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth.\"  [Sidenote: A Christian God.]  Surely this remains untouched and in full force. Huxley, to requote what has before been quoted, says: \"I can not see one tittle of evidence that the great unknown stands to us in the light of a Father.\" What a contradiction is here! He knows that the great unknown can not be proved to be our Father. Then he must know of the great unknown the negative aspects so minutely as to be sure that no Fatherhood is in the great unknown. Then he knows the great unknown much better than he is willing to admit, better than an agnostic ought.  [Sidenote: An All Pervasive Spirit.]  [Sidenote: His Commandments.]  [Sidenote: The Divine Ideal.]  Yet that the idea of God may remain in power and not as a \"passionless impersonality,\" it must be less interpreted by the teachings of Moses and more by the teachings of Christ. Human tempers and passions must be eliminated from our Divine Ideal. He must not be made an angry and jealous God as men count these. He must not be thought of as a vindictive personality, never so well pleased as when scaring His children into panic. In the thought of the Church He will be an all-pervasive Spirit whose nature is unfolded by the universe He has made. In that universe He will be felt to be immanent as the power of development, order, and destiny. All ages show Him to be \"the power which makes for righteousness.\" The commandments are not only His because they are found in the Bible, but because they are perceived to be necessary laws of conduct proceeding from such a Being as we know God to be for such beings as we know men to be. Thus we perceive them to be the Divinely authorized bond of society and the guarantee and obligation of the Divine Ideal of humanity. All nature and all history are scrutinized for traces of the Supreme. These being found to coincide with the Christian Revelation of Him, men will read with new reverence those wonderful books which make up the Book, and which beyond all others anticipate the latest results of scientific inquiry and natural ethical canon.  [Sidenote: Advantage of Newer View.]  Out of this will come such a sense of the Divine Presence as the Church and the individual Christian have not hitherto known. Moral distance from God will be the only distance. \"In Him we live and move and have our being\" comes to full interpretation through this thought of God. Humanity is immersed in Him.  [Sidenote: Transcendent.]  [Sidenote: Huxley Against Hume.]  But this immanent God is also seen to be transcendent. He is in nature and far beyond it. Vast as nature is, it is limited. God is the unlimited. Within this region of transcendence is room for all His gracious activities as distinguished from His natural activities; room for marvel and miracle if He will and we need. When Huxley abandons Hume's _a priori_ argument against miracles it is not worth while for others to use it. Fewer doubt the existence of a God, I believe, than at any time since men sought to prove that He does not exist. The Fatherly in God is proved both by His work in nature and by those works of grace which the student of nature alone can not see. God is a spirit. The human spirit refined, purified, sees Him in proportion to its purification.  [Sidenote: Modern Christology.]  [Sidenote: Former Limitations.]  [Sidenote: Ritual Statement.]  [Sidenote: Aim of Christianity.]  [Sidenote: Likeness to God.]  In respect of \"Jesus Christ, His only Son our Lord,\" it may, it must, be said He remains in full and glorious vigor as the Redeemer of mankind. The marked difference between our time and a half-century ago with respect to Christ is in the extension, rather than the diminution of His relation to salvation and the extension of the idea of salvation itself. In the former days men's eyes were almost wholly fixed on His death and its relation to salvation in the future life. Seldom indeed was the value of the following text taken into consideration: \"For if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of His Son, much more being reconciled we shall be saved by His life.\" There is less disposition to"]]]
