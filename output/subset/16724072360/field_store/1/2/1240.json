His aim was to give the act the appearance of a strategic movement, as it may be called.  It was not that he was afraid of the natives, but he was seeking a better place from which to open hostilities against them.  This was the impression which he sought to give the fierce savages, and whether he succeeded, or not was certain to become apparent within the following five minutes.  He himself believed, the chances were against the success of his plan.     CHAPTER III.  LIVELY WORK.  Now took place an unprecedented incident.  The air of comity, or at least neutrality, which brooded over the two parties had given way to that of silent but intense hostility.  The prowling movement of the native with the spear as he slipped into the wood, the sudden advance of Jared Long, whose face became like a thunder-cloud, when every hope of a friendly termination vanished, and the abrupt halt of the bowman, showed that all parties had thrown off the cloak of good will and become deadly enemies.  The third savage kept his place farther down the stream, his black eyes fixed on the archer in front, while he doubtless was waiting for some action on the part of his comrade who had stolen into the wood.  As has been stated, he was nigh enough to hurl his javelin, so that both the white men were too wise to eliminate him from the curiously involved problem that confronted them.  The bowman having halted, stood a moment with his piercing black eyes fixed on the nearest white man, as if seeking to read in his face the meaning of his action or rather abrupt cessation of action.  \"Professor,\" called Jared, \"I'll attend to the one in front of you; but look out for the scamp among the trees.\"  Grimcke was relieved to hear this, and had there been only the two natives to confront, he would have been disturbed by no misgiving, but there were signs that the third one down the stream was preparing to do his part in the treacherous business.  He too began advancing, but instead of doing so with the quick, angry stride of the New Englander, he stepped slowly and softly, as if seeking to conceal his movement.  Grimcke would have been glad to turn the archer over to the care of Long, but he was so frightfully close, that he did not dare do so.  A moment's delay on the part of his friend would be fatal.  At the same time, it was not to be forgotten that the most stealthy foe of all was prowling among the trees on the right.  The Professor's hope, as has been explained, was that his own retrogression had disconcerted the plans of this special miscreant for whom, however, he kept a keen watch.  The archer still held his bow, with the arrow in place grasped by his right hand, the long weapon resting against his hip.  Provided he was right-handed, the bow would have to be shifted to his left hand, the arrow drawn back with the right and the missile then launched at his foe.  This, it would seem, involved enough action to give both Grimcke and Long abundance of time in which to anticipate him.  But there remained the possibility that the savage was left-handed, in which event, the necessary action on his part would be much less, though sufficiently complicated to afford the white men abundance of time to anticipate him.  The native _was_ left-handed, with a quickness that surpassed all expectation, the bow was suddenly raised, the end of the arrow drawn back and the missile driven directly at the breast of Grimcke.  At precisely the same instant, the latter's strained ear caught the crackling of a twig, above the din of the rapids (which was much less there than below), and something was discerned moving among the trees on his right.  His frightened glance in that direction gave him a glimpse of a dusky figure in the act of hurling his javelin.  Thus it was that the spearman and archer let fly at precisely the same instant, and Jared Long, who was so anxious to help his friend, saw only the deft movements of the archer.  Grimcke could not fire at both in time to save himself, but he instinctively did the very best and indeed the only thing that could be done.  Without moving his feet, he dropped to a sitting posture, instantly popping up again like a jack-in-the-box.  The movement took place at precisely the right instant, and both the javelin and arrow whizzed over his head, without grazing him, but the arrow shot by Long's temple so close that he blinked and for an instant believed he had been hit.  But, like the hunter when bitten by a rattlesnake, he determined to crush his assailant and to attend to his hurt afterwards.  The sharp crack of the Winchester, the shriek of the smitten savage and his frenzied leap in the air, followed in such instant succession that they seemed simultaneous.  When the wretch went back on the ground he was as dead as Julius Caesar.  A man can fire with amazing rapidity, when using a Winchester repeater, but some persons are like cats in their own movements.  The New Englander leveled his weapon as quickly as he could bring it to his shoulder, but the native along the side of the Xingu had vanished as though he never existed.  Whether he knew anything about fire-arms or not, he was quick to understand that some kind of weapon in the hands of the white men had knocked the bowman out of time, and he bounded among the trees at his side, as though he, too, was discharged from the bow.  He was just quick enough to escape the bullet that would have been after him an instant later.  The moment Grimcke knew that he was safe from the javelin, which sped over his head, he straightened up, and, still maintaining his removable posture, discharged his gun at the point whence came the well-nigh fatal missile.  But the shot was a blind one, for he did not see the native at the instant of firing.  Nothing could have surpassed the alertness of these strange savages.  The one with the javelin disappeared with the same suddenness as did his brother down the bank, and, had the archer but comprehended his danger he, too, would have escaped.  The affray roused the wrath of both Long and Grimcke.  They had offered the hand of friendship, only to be answered with an attempt upon their lives.  One of their assailants had eluded them, and the other would have been an assailant had the opportunity been given.  \"Let's shoot him too!\"  He alluded to the man who hurled the javelin and who, so far as they could see, was left without any weapon with which to defend himself. In their natural excitement over their victory, the friends forgot themselves for the moment.  Heedless of consequences, they dashed among the trees, in pursuit of the savage who had flung his spear with well-nigh fatal effect.  The undergrowth was frightfully tangled, and, as the first plunge, the Professor went forward on his hands and knees.  The wonder was how Long kept his feet; but it will be remembered that he was much more attenuated than his companion, and seemed to have picked up a skill elsewhere which now stood him well.  The moon was shining and despite the dense vegetation around him, enough rays found their way to the ground to give him a partial view for few paces in front.  He had not gone far when he caught a glimpse of the dusky figure slipping through the undergrowth ahead, and at no great distance.  Strange as it may seem, the impetuosity of the American caused him to gain upon the terrified native, who, having flung his poisoned weapon, was without the means of defending himself.  It was not in the nature of things, however, that Long should overtake the fugitive, who was more accustomed to making his way through such obstructions.  The first burst of pursuit caused the white man to believe he would win in the strange race, but the next minute he saw he was losing ground.  Determined that the wretch should not escape, he checked his pursuit for an instant, and, bringing his Winchester to his shoulder, let fly.  But brief as was his halt, it give the savage time to make one terrific bound which shut him almost from sight, and rendered the hasty aim of Long so faulty that his intended victim was not so much as scratched.  Had the savage dashed deeper into the forest, he would have passed beyond all peril at this moment, but he was seeking to do that which Long did not discover until after discharging his gun.  He headed toward the river, where he was first seen.  It must have been that he was actuated by a desire to go to the help of his comrade, or more likely he was anxious to recover his javelin, in which he placed unbounded faith, and believed he could do it without undue risk.  Whatever his purpose, he quickly burst from the forest, while Long, who was pushing furiously after him, discovered from the increasing light in front, that he was close to the Xingu again.  Suspecting his purpose, the white man tore forward at the most reckless speed, and, before the native could recover his weapon and dart back to cover, he himself had dashed into the moonlight.  \"Now, we've got him!\" he shouted; \"there's no getting away _this_ time!\"  This exultant exclamation was uttered to a form which appeared on his right, and who he was certain was the Professor; but to his consternation, as he turned his head, he saw that it was the other native, javelin in hand!     CHAPTER IV.  HOW IT ENDED.  It will be recalled that the Professor started in pursuit of the flying native with as much ardor as his friend, but, less skilful than he, he had taken but a step or two, when an obstruction flung him to the ground with discouraging emphasis.  Concluding that he had undertaken a "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16856"],["title","Sermons at Rugby (#1)"],["body",": I have finished the work Thou gavest Me to do.  I have manifested Thy name unto the men whom Thou gavest me out of the world.\" . . . \"And for their sakes I sanctify Myself, that they also may be sanctified.  Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on Me through their word.\"  The only change we see as we step from the Psalms to the Gospel, from the Jewish pilgrim to the Saviour whom we worship, is that religious patriotism has expanded into the love of souls, the love of Him who laid down His life to save us from the power of sin and death.  It was for you and me that Christ was praying; and His prayer for us will be answered so soon as it inspires us to follow in His footsteps, so that we too, as we kneel before God each morning, each night, and think of our duty to those around us, may be able to say, in these words of His, which are at once a prayer and a consecrating vow--\"For their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also may be sanctified.'\"      II.  THE CHILD IN THE MIDST.      \"And He took a child and set Him in the midst of them: and when He had    taken him in His arms, He said unto them, Whosoever shall receive one    of such children in My name, receiveth Me: and whosoever shall receive    Me, receiveth not Me, but Him that sent Me.\"--ST. MARK ix. 36, 37.  It is one of the characteristics of our time, one of its most hopeful and most encouraging signs, that men are awaking to higher and purer conceptions of the Christian life and what it is that constitutes such a life.  We are beginning to feel, as it was not felt by former generations, that the only true religion, the only Christianity worthy of the name, is that which aims at embodying and reproducing the spirit, the thought, the ideas of the Saviour.  Through and underneath all ecclesiastical and mediaeval revivals, and all vagaries of church tradition or of ritual, this feeling seems to be growing with a steady growth, that the real test of a man's religion is the evidence which his life affords of the Christ-like spirit.  And this growing feeling gives an ever-fresh interest to the words and the judgment of the Lord on all matters of individual conduct and daily intercourse; so that if we are possessed at all by it, the Saviour is becoming more of a living person to us, and we ask ourselves more frequently, more earnestly, with more of reality and more of practical meaning in the question, how He would judge this or that side of our life, whether our conduct is in harmony with His spirit, and whether the standards of our life fit at all with His teaching and injunctions.  And how full of new meaning every familiar chapter of the Gospel becomes to you, if you are once roused to this kind of feeling; if you are feeling all the time, here is the spirit which should be dominating my own life and determining it, here are the thoughts, ideas, and views of conduct which should be mine also.  How does my common life fit with all this?  And it is with something like this feeling in your minds that I would ask you to consider the text I have just read to you.  \"Jesus took a child and set him in the midst of them.  He took him up in His arms and said, Whosoever shall receive one of such children in My name, receiveth Me.\"  And while we are considering it, let us notice also that in St. Matthew's narrative there are two other very emphatic expressions. \"Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven\"; and \"Whoso shall offend one of these little ones that believe in Me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were drowned in the depth of the sea. . . . Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of My Father which is in heaven.\"  Here, then, is the child taken up by Jesus and set in the midst; we know nothing more of him but this one thing, that he represents to us our Lord's Divine love of little children, and His high estimate of childhood, as the mysterious embodiment of that character and those qualities which bring us close to the Divine life.  But this is quite enough to make us listen to the lessons of thought and warning and hope, which Jesus expounds to us as He stands with the child in His arms.  His words may very well set every one of us thinking about our own life and conduct.  We look at this scene--the disciples standing round, their hearts occupied, as ours are apt to be, with their own ambitions, rivalries, and jealousies, and Jesus in the midst with the little child; and we cannot mistake or misinterpret the lessons He teaches us, the lessons which welled up in His heart whenever He saw, or met, or took up in His arms, and blessed a little child.  \"Let every child you meet,\" he clearly says to us, \"remind you that if you desire to be My disciple and to win a place in My kingdom, you must fling off selfishness, and put in its place the spirit of service and tenderness.\"  \"He that would be first must be servant of all.\"  \"You must humble yourself as this little child.\"  And then He adds the blessing and the warning:--\"Whoso shall receive one such child in My name receiveth Me; but whosoever shall offend one of these little ones, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea.\"  We may pause for a moment to consider what it is in childhood, what are the gifts, qualities, characteristics of the child, that drew from our Lord this special love and care and these injunctions to His followers. We do well to bear them in mind, because He has declared with such emphasis that we have no part in His kingdom unless we retain or recover these gifts.  And we should bear them in mind, because of the blessing promised to those who help to preserve these qualities in others. Receive, help, cherish, or protect a child, make the way of goodness easy to him, and shield him from evil, and Christ declares that inasmuch as you have done it to the least of all His little ones, you have done it unto Him.  On the other hand, offend any such child, that is to say, hinder, or mislead, spoil or degrade him in any way; do anything to rob a child of any of these Divine gifts, rob him of his innocence, or trustfulness, or his guileless heart, and sow the seeds of evil habits or tastes in their place, and you know the denunciation or curse which the Divine voice has laid upon you for your evil deed.  A child, then, is, as it were, a living symbol of that which draws to us the love of Christ, and we cannot doubt that he is so by virtue of his innocence, his obedient spirit, his guilelessness, or simplicity of character, his trustfulness, and by all the untarnished and unspoilt possibilities of goodness in him.  It is in the blessed endowment of such gifts as these that the little child looks in the face of Christ, and is embraced in the arms of His love.   And these are, or they once were, your gifts.  As you love the better life, and hope for good days, hold them fast and cherish them, or if any of them be unhappily lost, let it be your endeavour to recover it.  As we contemplate such a scene as this in our Lord's life with the little child in the midst, and listen to the Saviour's words, all the commands and injunctions to keep innocency, to keep the spirit of obedience, to keep a guileless and trusting and loving heart, gain a new force.  They seem to speak to us with new voices; for if the true life, the life that has in it the hope of union with Christ, must be a life endowed with these gifts, whether in youth or age, what a blessed thing it will be for you if you have never lost or squandered them.  We cannot too soon learn this lesson; for if under the influence of any wrong motives, or following any wrong ideals, or misled by any bad example, you go astray and rob your young life of these divine gifts, no man knows how, or when, or where you will recover them, and become again as a little child.  And if we turn our thoughts from our own separate personal life, and look for a moment at our duty as members of a society, how this picture of Christ embracing the little child, and blessing those who receive or help one such, should stir us to new and keener interest in social duty!  Does it not carry in it, this example and teaching of the Lord, does it not carry in it the condemnation of a great many of our traditional notions about our duty to the young?  We see the Lord's tenderness and love and care for the little child; we see how He values the childlike qualities; and how He enjoins the nursing and the cherishing of these.  If, then, we have really learnt the lesson which He thus presses upon us, we shall feel something like reverence for every young life, as it begins its perilous and uncertain course on the sea of man's experiences; and with this feeling we shall be eager to help and protect such lives whenever we have the chance of doing it, and we shall be very careful to do them no wrong.  But when we turn from the Gospel and these thoughts which it stirs in us to our common life of every day, does it not rather seem sometimes as if this teaching of the Lord were all a dream and had no reality?  And yet there is hardly one of us but would confess that, having once seen this revelation of the Lord, we are put to shame if, as happens sometimes, a young soul comes amongst us endowed with these very gifts of innocence, and high purpose, and trust, and promise of all goodness, which so won the Saviour's heart, and is met, when he comes, in school or house, not by care, or sympathy, or guidance, or protection, as of an elder brother's love, but by experiences of a very different sort.  You would agree that it is a shame to us if such an one comes only to find the misleading influence of some thoughtless or bad companion, or to have held up before him some bad tradition as the law which should rule his life"]]]
