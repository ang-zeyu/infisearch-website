At some of the villages they cheered, at others they looked at us glumly. But the back streets of Dublin were patriotic enough, and at the docks, which we reached just after dark, a small, tremendously enthusiastic crowd was gathered to see us off.  They sang songs and cheered, and cheered and sang songs. \"I can generally bear the separation, but I don't like the leave-taking.\" The boat would not go off. The crowd on the boat and the crowd on the wharf made patriotic noises until they were hoarse. At midnight our supporters had nearly all gone away. We who had seen our motor-cycles carefully hoisted on board ate the buns and apples provided by \"Friends in Dublin\" and chatted. A young gunner told me of all his amours, and they were very numerous. Still--       For my uncle _Toby's_ amours running all the way in my head,      they had the same effect upon me as if they had been my      own--I was in the most perfect state of bounty and  goodwill--  So I set about finding a place for sleep.  The whole of the Divisional Headquarters Staff, with all their horses, were on the _Archimedes_, and we were so packed that when I tried to find a place to sleep I discovered there was not an inch of space left on the deck, so I passed an uncomfortable night on top of some excruciatingly hard ropes.  We cast off about one in the morning. The night was horribly cold, and a slow dawn was never more welcomed. But day brought a new horror. The sun poured down on us, and the smell from the horses packed closely below was almost unbearable; while, worst of all, we had to go below to wash and to draw our rations.  Then I was first introduced to bully. The first tin tastes delicious and fills you rapidly. You never actually grow to dislike it, and many times when extra hungry I have longed for an extra tin. But when you have lived on bully for three months (we have not been served out with fresh meat more than a dozen times altogether),[2] how you long for any little luxuries to vary the monotony of your food!  On the morning of the third day we passed a French destroyer with a small prize in tow, and rejoiced greatly, and towards evening we dropped anchor off Havre. On either side of the narrow entrance to the docks there were cheering crowds, and we cheered back, thrilled, occasionally breaking into the soldier's anthem, \"It's a long, long way to Tipperary.\"[3]  We disembarked at a secluded wharf, and after waiting about for a couple of hours or so--we had not then learned to wait--we were marched off to a huge dim warehouse, where we were given gallons of the most delicious hot coffee, and bought scrumptious little cakes.  It was now quite dark, and, for what seemed whole nights, we sat wearily waiting while the horses were taken off the transport. We made one vain dash for our quarters, but found only another enormous warehouse, strangely lit, full of clattering waggons and restive horses. We watched with wonder a battery clank out into the night, and then returned sleepily to the wharf-side. Very late we found where we were to sleep, a gigantic series of wool warehouses. The warehouses were full of wool and the wool was full of fleas. We were very miserable, and a little bread and wine we managed to get hold of hardly cheered us at all. I feared the fleas, and spread a waterproof sheet on the bare stones outside. I thought I should not get a wink of sleep on such a Jacobean resting-place, but, as a matter of fact, I slept like a top, and woke in the morning without even an ache. But those who had risked the wool----!  We breakfasted off the strong, sweet tea that I have grown to like so much, and some bread, butter, and chocolate we bought off a smiling old woman at the warehouse gates. Later in the morning we were allowed into the town. First, a couple of us went into a café to have a drink, and when we came out we found our motor-cycles garlanded with flowers by two admiring flappers. Everywhere we went we were the gods of a very proper worship, though the shopkeepers in their admiration did not forget to charge. We spent a long, lazy day in lounging through the town, eating a lot of little meals and in visiting the public baths--the last bath I was to have, if I had only known it, for a month. A cheery, little, bustling town Havre seemed to us, basking in a bright sunshine, and the hopes of our early overwhelming victory. We all stalked about, prospective conquerors, and talked fluently of the many defects of the German army.  Orders came in the afternoon that we were to move that night. I sat up until twelve, and gained as my reward some excellent hot tea and a bit of rather tough steak. At twelve everybody was woken up and the company got ready to move. We motor-cyclists were sent off to the station. Foolishly I went by myself. Just outside what I thought was the station I ran out of petrol. I walked to the station and waited for the others. They did not come. I searched the station, but found nothing except a cavalry brigade entraining. I rushed about feverishly. There was no one I knew, no one who had heard anything of my company. Then I grew horribly frightened that I should be left behind. I pelted back to the old warehouses, but found everybody had left two hours ago. I thought the company must surely have gone by now, and started in my desperation asking everybody I knew if they had seen anything of the company. Luckily I came across an entraining officer, who told me that the company were entraining at \"Point Six-Hangar de Laine,\"--three miles away. I simply ran there, asking my way of surly, sleepy sentries, tripping over ropes, nearly falling into docks.  I found the Signal Company. There was not a sign of our train. So Johnson took me on his carrier back to the station I had searched in such fear. We found the motor-cycle, Johnson gave me some petrol, and we returned to Point Six. It was dawn when the old train at last rumbled and squeaked into the siding.  I do not know how long we took to entrain, I was so sleepy. But the sun was just rising when the little trumpet shrilled, the long train creaked over the points, and we woke for a moment to murmur--By Jove, we're off now,--and I whispered thankfully to myself--Thank heaven I found them at last.  We were lucky enough to be only six in our compartment, but, as you know, in a French IIIme there is very little room, while the seats are fiercely hard. And we had not yet been served out with blankets. Still, we had to stick it for twenty-four hours. Luckily the train stopped at every station of any importance, so, taking the law into our own hands, we got out and stretched our legs at every opportunity.  We travelled _viâ_ Rouen and Amiens to Landrecies. The Signal Company had a train to itself. Gradually we woke up to find ourselves travelling through extraordinarily pretty country and cheering crowds. At each level-crossing the curé was there to bless us. If we did not stop the people threw in fruit, which we vainly endeavoured to catch. A halt, and they were round us, beseeching us for souvenirs, loading us with fruit, and making us feel that it was a fine thing to fight in a friendly country.  At Rouen we drew up at a siding, and sent porters scurrying for bread and butter and beer, while we loaded up from women who came down to the train with all sorts of delicious little cakes and sweets. We stopped, and then rumbled slowly towards Amiens. At St Roche we first saw wounded, and heard, I do not know with what truth, that four aviators had been killed, and that our General, Grierson, had died of heart failure. At Ham they measured me against a lamp-post, and ceremoniously marked the place. The next time I passed through Ham I had no time to look for the mark! It began to grow dark, and the trees standing out against the sunset reminded me of our two lines of trees at home. We went slowly over bridges, and looked fearfully from our windows for bursting shells. Soon we fell asleep, and were wakened about midnight by shouted orders. We had arrived at Landrecies, near enough the Frontier to excite us.  I wonder if you realise at home what the Frontier meant to us at first? We conceived it as a thing guarded everywhere by intermittent patrols of men staring carefully towards Germany and Belgium in the darkness, a thing to be defended at all costs, at all times, to be crossed with triumph and recrossed with shame. We did not understand what an enormous, incredible thing modern war was--how it cared nothing for frontiers, or nations, or people.  Very wearily we unloaded our motor bicycles and walked to the barracks, where we put down our kit and literally feel asleep, to be wakened for fatigue work.  We rose at dawn, and had some coffee at a little _estaminet_,[4] where a middle-aged dame, horribly arch, cleaned my canteen for me, \"pour l'amour de toi.\" We managed an excellent breakfast of bacon and eggs before establishing the Signal Office at the barracks. A few of us rode off to keep touch with the various brigades that were billeted round. The rest of us spent the morning across the road at an inn drinking much wine-and-water and planning out the war on a forty-year-old map.  In the afternoon I went out with two others to prospect some roads, very importantly. We were rather annoyed to lose our way out of the town, and were very short with some inquisitive small boys who stood looking over our shoulders as we squatted on the grass by the wayside studying our maps.  We had some tea at a mad village called Hecq. All the inhabitants were old, ugly, smelly, and dirty; and they crowded round us as we devoured a magnificent omelette, endeavouring to incite us to do all sorts of things to the German women if ever we reached Germany. We returned home in the late afternoon to hear rumours of an advance next day.  Three of us wandered into the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16869"],["title","Oonomoo the Huron (#1)"],["body","ce, totally forgetful of his first love, which had been the beautiful inmate of the Hunter's Cabin.  Hans Vanderbum sat and gazed at his wife with an admiring eye, as she busied herself with the preparations of the morning meal.  Hoping to mollify her, he commenced flattering her, speaking in a low tone as if it were not his wish that she should hear him, but taking good care, at the same time, that nothing should escape her ears.  \"Shplendid figger, Keewaygooshturkumkankangewock has got.  No wonder all te braves of te Shawnee tribe should love her, and dat Hans Vanderbum gots her at last.  Jis' look at _dat_ foot! long and flat like a board, and she's de same shape all de way down from her head to her heels.  Ishn't dat breakfast ready, my dear wife?\"  The wife gave a spiteful nod, and Hans Vanderbum shambled up beside her, where the food, consisting of meat and a few simple vegetables, was spread upon a rude table which had no legs.  Quanonshet and Madokawandock were not behind-hand in their movements, and the whole four fell to with such voracity, that, in a very short time, their hunger was satisfied.  \"Now, you two fellers come out doors and learn your lessons,\" said the father, lighting his pipe, and putting on a very stern and dignified look.  The boys tumbled over each other in their eagerness to get into the open air.  Hans followed them, while Keewaygooshturkumkankangewock busied herself about her household duties.  Quanonshet and Madokawandock rollicked and frisked awhile before they were \"called to order.\"  After repeated commands, they approached their father, and standing side by side, awaited his instructions.  Hans Vanderbum had provided himself with a long pole, and stood by a sandy portion of ground, upon which he had no difficulty in tracing what letters and characters he wished.  With due preparation and importance he marked out the first letter of the German alphabet, and then, straightening himself up, demanded in a thundering tone \"vot dat was.\"  His two sons looked mute and dumbfounded.  They had not the remotest idea in the world of its name and significance.  For over three months the patient father had instructed them daily in regard to this character, and the two together must have repeated it several thousand times.  But, it mattered not; neither had any conception now of it, and their looks showed such unmistakably to their instructor.  \"Dunder and blixen, vot Dutch Indians!\" he exclaimed, impatiently. Repeating its name, he again demanded \"vot dat was.\"  This time they answered readily, and his eyes sparkled with pleasure.  \"Shmart boys,\" said he, approvingly.  \"You learns well, now.  One dese days--\"  Hans Vanderbum's words were cut short by the sudden sharp explosion of his pipe, the bowl being shattered in a hundred pieces, while nothing but the stem remained in his mouth.  \"Where's mine pipe?\" he asked, looking around in the vain hope of descrying it somewhere upon the ground.  Quanonshet and Madokawandock indulged in one short scream of laughter, then instantly straightened their faces and looked as meek and innocent as lambs.  Gradually the truth began to work its way into the head of Hans.  Looking sternly at the two, he asked, in a threatening voice:  \"Which of you put dat powder in mine meerschaum, eh? which of you done dat, eh?\"  Neither answered, except by hanging their heads and looking at their bare feet.  \"I axes you once more, and dis is de last time.\"  Each now protested that it was not himself but the other, so that if there really were but one culprit, Hans had no means of determining. Under the circumstances, he concluded the safest plan was to believe both guilty.  Accordingly he made a sudden dash and commenced whacking them soundly with the stick he held in his hand.  They yelled, kicked, and screamed; and squirming themselves loose, scampered quickly away from their irate instructor.  \"Dat meerschaum can't be fixed,\" he soliloquized, taking the bare stem out of his mouth and looking sorrowfully at it.  \"'Cause dere ishn't anything to fix it mit.  It ish wonderful what mischief gets into dem boys; dere ain't no time when dey ain't doin' notting what dey hadn't not ought to--all de times just de same way, while I toils myself to death to educate dem and bring 'em up in de way apout which dey ought to go.\"  Keewaygooshturkumkankangewock being in the habit of frequently indulging in the use of tobacco, her husband was not deprived entirely of his solace.  Going into the wigwam, he unbosomed his griefs to her, and she kindly loaned him her own pipe.  \"I hopes dere ain't no powder in dat,\" he remarked, glancing uneasily into the bowl.  \"Nothing but tobac,\" replied his spouse, in her native tongue, \"unless you've put the powder in yourself.\"  \"Dunderation, I don't does dat, and blow mine eyes out my head.  Dem little Dutchmen is up to all kinds of such tricks, and some dese days dey will blow deir poor fader's brains out of his head, and den what will become of dem?\" feelingly inquired Hans Vanderbum.  \"What will become of them?\" repeated Keewaygooshturkumkankangewock, her voice rising higher and higher at each word.  \"Who is it that supports them now and takes care of them?  Who is it that does that?  Who is it--\"  \"It's you--it's you,\" replied her husband, seeing the mistake he had made.  \"I doesn't do nottings--I doesn't do nottings; it's my wife, my good Keewaygooshturkumkankangewock, dat does it all.  She's a very nice squaw, de same shape all de way down.\"  These concessions and compliments greatly soothed the feelings of the incensed spouse.  She scolded her husband no more.  \"What you going to do, my dear frau?\" he asked, in a voice as cooing and winning as a dove's.  \"Going to work, to plant the corn, to get food for you and Quanonshet and Madokawandock when the snow falls.\"  \"Very kind, clever woman; good frau is mine Keewaygooshturkumkankangewock.\"  \"What are _you_ going to do?\" asked the wife, as the two passed out the wigwam.  \"Going to shmoke and _meditate_--meditate _hard_,\" replied Hans Vanderbum, impressively.  \"Can't you think as well while you're _fishing_?\"  \"I shpose I can; if my Keewaygooshturkumkankangewock t'inks so, I can.\"  \"Well, she thinks so.\"  The fact that his wife \"thought so\" was equivalent to a command with Hans.  He manifested no unwillingness or reluctance in obeying. Accordingly, he furnished himself with a hook, line and bait, and set out for the river.  It was now getting well along in the forenoon, the sun being above the tree-tops.  The Shawnee Indians had left their wigwams to engage in their daily avocations.  The women were mostly toiling in the field, their pappooses hanging from the trees or leaning against their trunks. The older children were frolicking through the woods, or fishing or hunting.  A few warriors and old men still lounged about the wigwams, but the majority either were engaged in the hunt, or were upon the war-trail.  Stolid and indifferent as was the nature of Hans, it struck him that there was something unusual in the appearance and actions of the Indians.  It seemed as though some startling event had occurred from which they had not fully recovered.  They were uneasy and restless in their movements, constantly passing to and from the river.  Upon reaching the banks of the latter, the Dutchman found a considerable number already there.  They were not engaged in fishing, but lay close to the edge of the water, as if they expected the appearance of something upon its surface.  Had he been a little more observant, there was something else which would have attracted his attention, on his passage through the woods.  Fully a dozen times a peculiar sound, like the whistle of a bird, reached his ears, and he supposed it to be nothing more, although it did seem odd to him that the bird should follow him almost to the river bank.  Besides this, he caught a flitting glimpse of an Indian now and then, some distance in the woods, that appeared to be watching him; but Hans did not care, even if such were the case, and he paid no further heed to him.  Reaching the river, he made his preparations with great care and elaboration.  He had several hooks pendent from his line, upon each of which he shoved the wriggling worms, spitting upon them during the operation, as if to make them more tractable.  To the line also was fastened a pebble, to make it sink.  Swinging this several times around his head, he let go, when it spun far out in the river, and he commenced cautiously following it by means of a projecting tree-trunk. This latter extended a dozen feet out over the surface of the water, and had been used as a seat a great many times by him.  Passing out to the extremity, he was afforded a comfortable resting-place where he could sit hour after hour smoking his pipe and engage in fishing.  Had he noticed the large branch of the tree upon which he seated himself, he would have hesitated before trusting the weight of his body upon it, but his nature was too unsuspicious to be attracted by anything trivial in its appearance, and he made his way out upon it, as he had done scores of times before.  Ensconcing himself in his seat, he gave his whole attention to his line and his pipe, not noticing the interested glances which the Shawnees along the bank bestowed upon his operations.  After the space of a few minutes, he felt something pull at his line, and doing the same, he hauled a fine plump fish out of the water, casting it upon the land.  \"Dat is purty goot,\" he mused, \"and I will soon got a lot more, and my Keewaygooshturkumkankangewock will feel goot too, when I takes 'em home.  She won't--  Dunder and Blixen!\"  The limb upon which he was seated suddenly broke short off, and Hans dropped into the river out of sight.  But such a ponderous body as his could not sink, and upon coming to the surface, he paddled hurriedly to the shore.  \"Dem little Dutchmen, Quanonshet and Madokawandock, will be de death of deir old"]]]
