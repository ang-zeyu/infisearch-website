II  IN AND ABOUT LONDON   London occurs to the average tourist as the center from which his travels in the Kingdom will radiate, and this idea, from many points of view, is logically correct. Around the city cluster innumerable literary and historic associations, and the points of special interest lying within easy reach will outnumber those in any section of similar extent in the entire country. If one purposes to make the tour by rail, London is pre-eminently the center from which to start and to which one will return at various times in his travels. All the principal railways lead to the metropolis. The number of trains arriving and departing each day greatly exceeds that of any other city in the world, and the longest through journey in the island may be compassed between sunrise and sunset.  The motorist, however, finds a different problem confronting him in making London his center. I had in mind the plan of visiting the famous places of the city and immediate suburbs with the aid of my car, but it was speedily abandoned when I found myself confronted by the actual conditions. One attempt at carrying out this plan settled the matter for me. The trip which I undertook would probably be one of the first to occur to almost anybody--the drive to Hampton Court Palace, about twelve or fifteen miles from the central part of the city. It looked easy to start about two or three o'clock, spend a couple of hours at Hampton Court and get back to our hotel by six. After trying out my car--which had reached London some time ahead of me--a few times in localities where traffic was not the heaviest, I essayed the trip without any further knowledge of the streets than I had gained from the maps. I was accompanied by a nervous friend from Iowa who confessed that he had been in an automobile but once before. He had ridden with a relative through a retired section of his native state, traversed for the first time by an automobile, and he had quit trying to remember how many run-aways and smash-ups were caused by the fractious horses they met on the short journey. Visions of damage suits haunted him for months thereafter. In our meanderings through the London streets, the fears for the other fellow which had harassed him during his former experience, were speedily transferred to himself. To his excited imagination, we time and again escaped complete wreck and annihilation by a mere hair's breadth. The route which we had taken, I learned afterwards, was one of the worst for motoring in all London. The streets were narrow and crooked and were packed with traffic of all kinds. Tram cars often ran along the middle of the street, with barely room for a vehicle to pass on either side. The huge motor busses came tearing towards us in a manner most trying to novices, and it seemed, time after time, that the dexterity of the drivers of these big machines was all that saved our car from being wrecked. We obtained only the merest glimpse of Hampton Palace, and the time which we had consumed made it apparent that if we expected to reach our hotel that night, we must immediately retrace our way through the wild confusion we had just passed. It began to rain, and added to the numerous other dangers that seemed to confront us was that of \"skidding\" on the slippery streets. When we finally reached our garage, I found that in covering less than twenty-five miles, we had consumed about four hours and we had been moving all the time. The nervous strain was a severe one and I forthwith abandoned any plan that I had of attempting to do London by motor car. With more knowledge and experience I would have done better, but a local motorist, thoroughly acquainted with London, told me that he wouldn't care to undertake the Hampton Court trip by the route which we had traveled.  On Saturday afternoons and Sundays, the motorist may practically have freedom of the city. He will find the streets deserted everywhere. The heavy traffic has all ceased and the number of cabs and motor busses is only a fraction of what it would be on business days. He will meet comparatively few motors in the city on Sunday, even though the day be fine, such as would throng the streets of Chicago or New York with cars. The Englishman who goes for a drive is attracted from the city by the many fine roads which lead in every direction to pleasure resorts. One of the most popular runs with Londoners is the fifty miles to Brighton, directly southward, and the number of motors passing over this highway on fine Sundays is astonishing. I noted a report in the papers that on a certain Sunday afternoon no less than two hundred cars passed a police trap, and of these, thirty-five were summoned before the magistrates for breaking the speed limit. To the average American, this run to Brighton would not be at all attractive compared with many other roads leading out of London, on which one would scarcely meet a motor car during the day and would be in no danger from the machinations of the police. Of course the places frequented by tourists are often closed on Sunday--or at least partially so, as in the case of Windsor Castle, where one is admitted to the grounds and court, but the state apartments, etc., are not shown. Even the churches are closed to Sunday visitors except during the regular services.  Within a radius of thirty miles of London, and outside its immediate boundaries, there are numerous places well worth a visit, most of them open either daily or at stated times. A few of such places are Harrow on the Hill, with its famous school; Keston, with Holwood House, the home of William Pitt; Chigwell, the scene of Dickens' \"Barnaby Rudge;\" Waltham Abbey Church, founded in 1060; the home of Charles Darwin at Downe; Epping Forest; Hampton Court; Rye House at Broxborne; Hatfield House, the estate of the Marquis of Salisbury; Runnymede, where the Magna Charta was signed; St. Albans, with its ancient cathedral church; Stoke Poges Church of Gray's \"Elegy\" fame; Windsor Castle; Knole House, with its magnificent galleries and furniture; Penshurst Place, the home of the Sidneys; John Milton's cottage at Chalfont St. Giles; the ancient town of Guildford in Surrey; Gad's Hill, Dickens' home, near Rochester; the vicarage where Thackeray's grandfather lived and the old church where he preached at Monken Hadley; and Whitchurch, with Handel's original organ, is also near the last-named village. These are only a few of the places that no one should miss. The motor car affords an unequalled means of reaching these and other points in this vicinity; since many are at some distance from railway stations, to go by train would consume more time than the average tourist has at his disposal. While we visited all the places which I have just mentioned and many others close to London, we made only three or four short trips out of the city returning the same or the following day. We managed to reach the majority of such points by going and returning over different highways on our longer tours. In this way we avoided the difficulty we should have experienced in making many daily trips from London, since a large part of each day would have been consumed merely in getting in and out of the city.  [Illustration: HARVESTING IN HERTFORDSHIRE.  From Painting by Alfred Elias. Exhibited in 1906 Royal Academy.]  Our first trip into the country was made on the Sunday after our arrival. Although we started out at random, our route proved a fortunate one, and gave us every reason to believe that our tour of the Kingdom would be all we had anticipated. During the summer we had occasion to travel three times over this same route, and we are still of the opinion that there are few more delightful bits of road in England. We left London by the main highway, running for several miles through Epping Forest, which is really a great suburban park. It was a good day for cyclists, for the main road to the town of Epping was crowded with thousands of them. So great was the number and so completely did they occupy the highway, that it was necessary to drive slowly and with the greatest care. Even then, we narrowly avoided a serious accident. One of the cyclists, evidently to show his dexterity, undertook to cut around us by running across the tramway tracks. These were wet and slippery, and the wheel shot from under the rider, pitching him headlong to the ground not two feet in front of our car, which was then going at a pretty good rate. If the cyclist did not exhibit skill in managing his wheel, he certainly gave a wonderful display of agility in getting out of our way. He did not seem to touch the ground at all, and by turning two or three handsprings, he avoided being run over by the narrowest margin. His wheel was considerably damaged and his impedimenta scattered over the road. It was with rather a crestfallen air that he gathered up his belongings, and we went on, shuddering to think how close we had come to a serious accident at the very beginning of our pilgrimage. A policeman witnessed the accident, but he clearly placed the blame on the careless wheelman.  Passing through the forest, we came to Epping, and from there into a stretch of open country that gave little suggestion of proximity to the world's metropolis. Several miles through a narrow but beautifully kept byway brought us to the village of Chipping-Ongar, a place of considerable antiquity, and judging from the extensive site of its ancient castle, at one time of some military importance.  At Ongar we began our return trip to London over the road which we agreed was the most beautiful leading out of the city, for the suburbs do not extend far in this direction and one is comparatively soon in the country.

In drawing and painting, though I had a certain natural aptitude for both, I never attained much proficiency in either, partly for lack of instruction, partly from want of application, but more especially, I believe, because another, more alluring, more mentally exciting occupation beguiled me.  It was not music, though to music close allied. This new-found joy I long pursued in secret, afraid lest it should be discovered and despised as a folly.  It was not until I lived in Scotland, where poetical taste and business talent thrive side by side, and where, as Mr. Spurgeon said, \"no country in the world produced so many poets,\" that I became courageous, and ventured to avow my dear delight.  It was there that I sought, with some success, publication in various papers and magazines of my attempts at versification, for versification it was that so possessed my fancy.  Of the spacious times of great Elizabeth it has been written, \"the power of action and the gift of song did not exclude each other,\" but in England, in mid-Victorian days, it was looked upon differently, or so at least I believed.  After a time I had the distinction of being included in a new edition of _Recent and Living Scottish Poets_, by Alexander Murdoch, published in 1883.  My inclusion was explained on the ground that, \"His muse first awoke to conscious effort on Scottish soil,\" which, though not quite in accordance with fact, was not so wide of the mark that I felt in the least concerned to criticise the statement.  I was too much enamoured of the honour to question the foundation on which it rested.  Perhaps it was as well deserved as are some others of this world's distinctions!  At any rate it was neither begged nor bought, but came \"Like Dian's kiss, unasked, unsought.\"  In the same year (1883) I also appeared in _Edwards_' Sixth Series of _Modern Scottish Poets_; and in 1885, more legitimately, in William Andrews' book on _Modern Yorkshire Poets_.  My claim for this latter distinction was not, however, any greater, if as great, as my right to inclusion in the collection of _Scottish Poets_.  If I \"lisped in numbers,\" it was not in Yorkshire, for Yorkshire I left for ever before even the first babblings of babyhood began.  However, \"kissing goes by favour,\" and I was happy in the favour I enjoyed.  I may as well say it here: with my poetical productions I was never satisfied any more than with my attempts at drawing.  My verses seemed mere farthing dips compared with the resplendent poetry of our country which I read and loved, but my efforts employed and brightened many an hour in my youth that otherwise would have been tedious and dreary.  Ours was a large family, nine children in all; nothing unusual in those days.  \"A quiver full\" was then a matter of parental pride.  Woman was more satisfied with home life then than now.  The pursuit of pleasure was not so keen.  Our parents and our grandparents were simpler in their tastes, more easily amused, more readily impressed with the wonderful and the strange.  Things that would leave us unmoved were to them matters of moment.  Railways were new and railway travelling was, to most people, an event.  Our fathers talked of their last journey to London, their visit to the Tower, to Westminster Abbey, the Monument, Madame Tussauds; how they mistook the waxwork policeman for a real member of the force; how they shuddered in the _Chamber of Horrors_; how they travelled on the new Underground Railway; and saw the wonders of the Crystal Palace, especially on fireworks night.  They told us of their visit to the _Great Eastern_, what a gigantic ship it was, what a marvel, and described its every feature.  They talked of General Tom Thumb, of Blondin, of Pepper's Ghost, of the Christy Minstrels.  Nowadays, a father will return from London and not even mention the Tubes to his children.  Why should he? They know all about them and are surprised at nothing.  The picture books and the cinemas have familiarised them with every aspect of modern life.  In those days our pleasures and our amusements were fewer, but impressed us more.  I remember how eagerly the coloured pictures of the Christmas numbers of the pictorial papers were looked forward to, talked of, criticised, admired, framed and hung up.  I remember too, the excitements of Saint Valentine's Day, Shrove Tuesday, April Fool's Day, May Day and the Morris (Molly) dancers; and the Fifth of November, Guy Fawkes Day.  I remember also the peripatetic knife grinder and his trundling machine, the muffin man, the pedlar and his wares, the furmity wheat vendor, who trudged along with his welcome cry of \"Frummitty!\" from door to door. Those were pleasant and innocent excitements.  We have other things to engage us now, but I sometimes think all is not _gain_ that the march of progress brings.  Young people then had fewer books to read, but read them thoroughly.  What excitement and discussion attended the monthly instalments of Dickens' novels in _All the Year Round_; how eagerly they were looked for.  Lucky he or she who had heard the great _master_ read himself in public.  His books were read in our homes, often aloud to the family circle by paterfamilias, and moved us to laughter or tears.  I never now see our young people, or their elders either, affected by an author as we were then by the power of Dickens.  He was a new force and his pages kindled in our hearts a vivid feeling for the poor and their wrongs.  Scott's _Waverley Novels_, too, aroused our enthusiasm.  In the early sixties a cheap edition appeared, and cheap editions were rare things then.  It was published, if I remember aright, at two shillings per volume; an event that stirred the country.  My father brought each volume home as it came out.  I remember it well; a pale, creamy-coloured paper cover, good type, good paper.  What treasures they were, and only two shillings!  I was a little child when an important movement for the cheapening of books began.  In 1852 Charles Dickens presided at a meeting of authors and others against the coercive regulations of the Booksellers' Association which maintained their excessive profits. Herbert Spencer and Miss Evans (George Eliot) took a prominent part in this meeting and drafted the resolutions which were passed.  The ultimate effect of this meeting was that the question between the authors and the booksellers was referred to Lord Campbell as arbitrator.  He gave a decision against the booksellers; and there were consequently abolished such of the trade regulations as had interdicted the sale of books at lower rates of profit than those authorised by the Booksellers' Association.  Practically all my school days were spent at Derby.  As I have said, ours was a large family.  I have referred to an only sister, but I had step- sisters and step-brothers too.  My father married twice and the second family was numerous.  His salary was never more than 300 pounds a year, and though a prudent enough man, he was not of the frugal economical sort who makes the most of every shilling.  It may be imagined, then, that all the income was needed for a family that, parents included, but excluding the one servant, numbered eleven.  The consequence was that the education I received could not be described as liberal.  I attended a day school at Derby, connected with the Wesleyans; why I do not know, as we belonged to the Anglican Church; but I believe it was because the school, while cheap as to fees, had the reputation of giving a good, plain education suitable for boys destined for railway work.  It was a good sized school of about a hundred boys.  Not long ago I met one day in London a business man who, it turned out, was at this school with me.  We had not met for fifty years.  \"Well,\" said he, \"I think old Jessie, if he did not teach us a great variety of things, what he did he taught well.\"  My new-found old schoolmate had become the financial manager of a great business house having ramifications throughout the world.  He had attained to position and wealth and, which successful men sometimes are not, was quite unspoiled.  We revived our schooldays with mutual pleasure, and lunched together as befitted the occasion.  \"Jessie\" was the name by which our old schoolmaster was endeared to his boys; a kindly, simple-minded, worthy man, teaching, as well as scholastic subjects, behaviour, morals, truth, loyalty; and these as much by example as by precept, impressing ever upon us the virtue of thoroughness in all we did and of truth in all we said.  Since those days I have seen many youths, educated at much finer and more pretentious schools, who have benefited by modern educational methods, and on whose education much money has been expended, and who, when candidates for clerkships, have, in the simple matters of reading, writing, arithmetic, composition and spelling, shown up very poorly compared to what almost any boy from \"old Jessie's\" unambitious establishment would have done. But, plain and substantial as my schooling was, I have ever felt that I was defrauded of the better part of education--the classics, languages, literature and modern science, which furnish the mind and extend the boundaries of thought.  \"Jessie\" continued his interest in his boys long after they left school. He was proud of those who made their way.  I remember well the warmth of his greeting and the kind look of his mild blue eyes when, after I had gone out into the world, I sometimes revisited him.  But my school life was not all happiness.  In the school there was an almost brutal element of roughness, and fights were frequent; not only in our own, but between ours and neighbouring schools.  Regular pitched battles were fought with sticks and staves and stones.  I shrunk from fighting but could not escape it."]]]
