To this the bookseller chef added fried potatoes from another dish, and poured for his guest a glass of wine.  \"This is California catawba,\" said Mifflin, \"in which the grape and the sunshine very pleasantly (and cheaply) fulfil their allotted destiny. I pledge you prosperity to the black art of Advertising!\"  The psychology of the art and mystery of Advertising rests upon tact, an instinctive perception of the tone and accent which will be en rapport with the mood of the hearer.  Mr. Gilbert was aware of this, and felt that quite possibly his host was prouder of his whimsical avocation as gourmet than of his sacred profession as a bookman.  \"Is it possible, sir,\" he began, in lucid Johnsonian, \"that you can concoct so delicious an entree in so few minutes?  You are not hoaxing me?  There is no secret passage between Gissing Street and the laboratories of the Ritz?\"  \"Ah, you should taste Mrs. Mifflin's cooking!\" said the bookseller.  \"I am only an amateur, who dabbles in the craft during her absence.  She is on a visit to her cousin in Boston.  She becomes, quite justifiably, weary of the tobacco of this establishment, and once or twice a year it does her good to breathe the pure serene of Beacon Hill.  During her absence it is my privilege to inquire into the ritual of housekeeping. I find it very sedative after the incessant excitement and speculation of the shop.\"  \"I should have thought,\" said Gilbert, \"that life in a bookshop would be delightfully tranquil.\"  \"Far from it.  Living in a bookshop is like living in a warehouse of explosives.  Those shelves are ranked with the most furious combustibles in the world--the brains of men.  I can spend a rainy afternoon reading, and my mind works itself up to such a passion and anxiety over mortal problems as almost unmans me.  It is terribly nerve-racking.  Surround a man with Carlyle, Emerson, Thoreau, Chesterton, Shaw, Nietzsche, and George Ade--would you wonder at his getting excited?  What would happen to a cat if she had to live in a room tapestried with catnip?  She would go crazy!\"  \"Truly, I had never thought of that phase of bookselling,\" said the young man.  \"How is it, though, that libraries are shrines of such austere calm?  If books are as provocative as you suggest, one would expect every librarian to utter the shrill screams of a hierophant, to clash ecstatic castanets in his silent alcoves!\"  \"Ah, my boy, you forget the card index!  Librarians invented that soothing device for the febrifuge of their souls, just as I fall back upon the rites of the kitchen.  Librarians would all go mad, those capable of concentrated thought, if they did not have the cool and healing card index as medicament!  Some more of the eggs?\"  \"Thank you,\" said Gilbert.  \"Who was the butler whose name was associated with the dish?\"  \"What?\" cried Mifflin, in agitation, \"you have not heard of Samuel Butler, the author of The Way of All Flesh?  My dear young man, whoever permits himself to die before he has read that book, and also Erewhon, has deliberately forfeited his chances of paradise.  For paradise in the world to come is uncertain, but there is indeed a heaven on this earth, a heaven which we inhabit when we read a good book.  Pour yourself another glass of wine, and permit me----\"  (Here followed an enthusiastic development of the perverse philosophy of Samuel Butler, which, in deference to my readers, I omit.  Mr. Gilbert took notes of the conversation in his pocketbook, and I am pleased to say that his heart was moved to a realization of his iniquity, for he was observed at the Public Library a few days later asking for a copy of The Way of All Flesh.  After inquiring at four libraries, and finding all copies of the book in circulation, he was compelled to buy one.  He never regretted doing so.)  \"But I am forgetting my duties as host,\" said Mifflin.  \"Our dessert consists of apple sauce, gingerbread, and coffee.\" He rapidly cleared the empty dishes from the table and brought on the second course.  \"I have been noticing the warning over the sideboard,\" said Gilbert. \"I hope you will let me help you this evening?\"  He pointed to a card hanging near the kitchen door.  It read:        ALWAYS WASH DISHES      IMMEDIATELY AFTER MEALS      IT SAVES TROUBLE   \"I'm afraid I don't always obey that precept,\" said the bookseller as he poured the coffee.  \"Mrs. Mifflin hangs it there whenever she goes away, to remind me.  But, as our friend Samuel Butler says, he that is stupid in little will also be stupid in much.  I have a different theory about dish-washing, and I please myself by indulging it.  \"I used to regard dish-washing merely as an ignoble chore, a kind of hateful discipline which had to be undergone with knitted brow and brazen fortitude.  When my wife went away the first time, I erected a reading stand and an electric light over the sink, and used to read while my hands went automatically through base gestures of purification.  I made the great spirits of literature partners of my sorrow, and learned by heart a good deal of Paradise Lost and of Walt Mason, while I soused and wallowed among pots and pans.  I used to comfort myself with two lines of Keats:        'The moving waters at their priest-like task      Of pure ablution round earth's human shores----'   Then a new conception of the matter struck me.  It is intolerable for a human being to go on doing any task as a penance, under duress.  No matter what the work is, one must spiritualize it in some way, shatter the old idea of it into bits and rebuild it nearer to the heart's desire.  How was I to do this with dish-washing?  \"I broke a good many plates while I was pondering over the matter. Then it occurred to me that here was just the relaxation I needed.  I had been worrying over the mental strain of being surrounded all day long by vociferous books, crying out at me their conflicting views as to the glories and agonies of life.  Why not make dish-washing my balm and poultice?  \"When one views a stubborn fact from a new angle, it is amazing how all its contours and edges change shape!  Immediately my dishpan began to glow with a kind of philosophic halo!  The warm, soapy water became a sovereign medicine to retract hot blood from the head; the homely act of washing and drying cups and saucers became a symbol of the order and cleanliness that man imposes on the unruly world about him.  I tore down my book rack and reading lamp from over the sink.  \"Mr. Gilbert,\" he went on, \"do not laugh at me when I tell you that I have evolved a whole kitchen philosophy of my own.  I find the kitchen the shrine of our civilization, the focus of all that is comely in life.  The ruddy shine of the stove is as beautiful as any sunset.  A well-polished jug or spoon is as fair, as complete and beautiful, as any sonnet.  The dish mop, properly rinsed and wrung and hung outside the back door to dry, is a whole sermon in itself.  The stars never look so bright as they do from the kitchen door after the ice-box pan is emptied and the whole place is 'redd up,' as the Scotch say.\"  \"A very delightful philosophy indeed,\" said Gilbert.  \"And now that we have finished our meal, I insist upon your letting me give you a hand with the washing up.  I am eager to test this dish-pantheism of yours!\"  \"My dear fellow,\" said Mifflin, laying a restraining hand on his impetuous guest, \"it is a poor philosophy that will not abide denial now and then.  No, no--I did not ask you to spend the evening with me to wash dishes.\"  And he led the way back to his sitting room.  \"When I saw you come in,\" said Mifflin, \"I was afraid you might be a newspaper man, looking for an interview.  A young journalist came to see us once, with very unhappy results.  He wheedled himself into Mrs. Mifflin's good graces, and ended by putting us both into a book, called Parnassus on Wheels, which has been rather a trial to me.  In that book he attributes to me a number of shallow and sugary observations upon bookselling that have been an annoyance to the trade.  I am happy to say, though, that his book had only a trifling sale.\"  \"I have never heard of it,\" said Gilbert.  \"If you are really interested in bookselling you should come here some evening to a meeting of the Corn Cob Club.  Once a month a number of booksellers gather here and we discuss matters of bookish concern over corn-cobs and cider.  We have all sorts and conditions of booksellers: one is a fanatic on the subject of libraries.  He thinks that every public library should be dynamited.  Another thinks that moving pictures will destroy the book trade.  What rot!  Surely everything that arouses people's minds, that makes them alert and questioning, increases their appetite for books.\"  \"The life of a bookseller is very demoralizing to the intellect,\" he went on after a pause.  \"He is surrounded by innumerable books; he cannot possibly read them all; he dips into one and picks up a scrap from another.  His mind gradually fills itself with miscellaneous flotsam, with superficial opinions, with a thousand half-knowledges. Almost unconsciously he begins to rate literature according to what people ask for.  He begins to wonder whether Ralph Waldo Trine isn't really greater than Ralph Waldo Emerson, whether J. M. Chapple isn't as big a man as J. M. Barrie.  That way lies intellectual suicide.  \"One thing, however, you must grant the good bookseller.  He is tolerant.  He is patient of all ideas and theories.  Surrounded, engulfed by the torrent of men's words, he is willing to listen to them all.  Even to the publisher's salesman he turns an indulgent ear.  He is willing to be humbugged for the weal of humanity.  He hopes unceasingly for good books to be born.  \"My business, you see, is different from most.  I only deal in second-hand books; I only buy books that I consider have some honest reason for existence.  In so far as human judgment can discern, I try to keep trash out of my shelves."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17203"],["title","Witchcraft and Devil Lore in the Channel Islands (#1)"],["body","W. House, one of the by-standers. Upon the noise of      this strange incident, the cruel bailiff returned command      that the poor infant must be cast again into the flames,      which was accordingly performed; and so that pretty babe was      born a martyr, and added to the number of the holy      innocents.  Parsons, the English Jesuit, has asserted that the women were felons and were executed for theft, while other apologists have described them as prostitutes and generally infamous in character. The original sentences, however, which still exist at the Guernsey _Greffe_, and which I have examined, conclusively settle the question. Both the ecclesiastical sentence, which is in Latin, and the civil sentence, which is in French, distinctly describe the charge as one of _heresy_, and make no mention whatever of any other crime as having aught to do with the condemnation.  It has been questioned too whether a child could be born alive under such circumstances. Mr. F.B. Tupper, in his _History of Guernsey_ (page 151), says: \"We are assured by competent surgical authority that the case is very possible\"; and he further mentions that in a volume entitled _Three Visits to Madagascar_, by the Rev. Wm. Ellis, published in London, in 1858, a precisely similar case is stated to have occurred in that island. A native woman was burnt for becoming a convert to Christianity, and her infant, born in the flames, was thrust into them again, and burnt also.  Lord Tennyson refers to this Guernsey martyrdom in his historical drama of _Queen Mary_ (Act v. Scene iv.). It is night-time in London; a light is burning in the Royal Palace; and he makes two \"Voices of the Night\" say:--  _First_:--There's the Queen's light. I hear she cannot live.  _Second_:--God curse her and her Legate! Gardiner burns Already; but to pay them full in kind, The hottest hold in all the devil's den Were but a sort of winter; Sir, in Guernsey, I watch'd a woman burn; and in her agony The mother came upon her--a child was born-- And, Sir, they hurl'd it back into the fire, That, being thus baptised in fire, the babe Might be in fire for ever. Ah, good neighbour, There should be something fierier than fire To yield them their deserts.  With regard to Witchcraft in Jersey, I have not had an opportunity of personally examining the official records there. I find, however, some information on the subject, given by M. De La Croix, in his _Ville de St. Hélier_, and _Les Etats de Jersey_, upon which I have drawn. In the way of legislation, the Guernsey Court does not appear to have promulgated any penal statutes on the subject, being content to treat the crime as one against the common law of the Island. In Jersey on the contrary, Witchcraft was specially legislated against at least on one occasion, for we find that on December 23rd, 1591, the Royal Court of that island passed an Ordinance, of which the following is the purport:--       Forasmuch as many persons have hitherto committed and      perpetrated great and grievous faults, as well against the      honour and express commandment of God as to the great      scandal of the Christian faith, and of those who are charged      with the administration of justice, by seeking assistance      from Witches and Diviners in their ills and afflictions; and      seeing that ignorance is no excuse for sin, and that no one      can tell what vice and danger may ensue from such practices:      This Act declares that for the time to come everyone shall      turn away from such iniquitous and diabolical practices,      against which the law of God decrees the same punishments as      against Witches and Enchanters themselves; and also in      order that the Divine Vengeance may be averted, which on      account of the impunity with which these crimes have been      committed, now threatens those who have the repression of      them in their hands. It is, therefore, strictly forbidden to      all the inhabitants of this island to receive any counsel or      assistance in their adversities from any Witches or      Diviners, or anyone suspected of practicing Sorcery, under      pain of one month's imprisonment in the Castle, on bread and      water; and on their liberation they shall declare to the      Court the cause of such presumption, and according as this      shall appear reasonable, shall be dealt with as the law of      God directs.  In 1562 two women were executed in Jersey for witchcraft. One of them named _Anne_, a native of St. Brelade's, was burnt at St. Helier's; and the other, _Michelle La Blanche_, expiated her crime at the gibbet of the Hurets, in the parish of St. Ouen, because criminals dwelling on the Fief Haubert de St. Ouen, were, in accordance with custom, required to be executed within the boundaries of the said Fief--seeing that it possessed a gallows-right--and their goods and lands became forfeited to the Seigneur.  In 1583 a rather curious point of law was raised in connection with a pending witch-trial at St. Helier's. On the 15th of February in that year, a suspected witch named _Marion Corbel_, who had been imprisoned in the Castle awaiting her trial, suddenly died. Whereupon her relatives came forward and claimed to be heirs to her goods and chattles, seeing that she had not been convicted of the imputed crime, and urging that her death put an end to further criminal proceedings. The Queen's Procureur, however--it was in the reign of Elizabeth--contended that death was no bar to the completion of the indictment, although it had effectually removed the criminal from the jurisdiction of the Court, as far as punishment was concerned. The very reasonable claim of the deceased woman's relatives was therefore set aside, and the defunct of course being found guilty, her possessions reverted to the crown.  Again, forty years later, in 1623, an old woman of sixty, named _Marie Filleul_, daughter of _Thomas Filleul_, of the parish of St. Clement's, was tried before a jury of twenty-four of her countrymen, and found guilty of the diabolical crime of Sorcery. She was therefore hanged and burnt as a witch, and her goods were confiscated to the King [James I.], and to the Seigneurs to whom they belonged.  It may be interesting to note here the opinion of Mr. Philippe Le Geyt, the famous commentator on the constitution and laws of Jersey, and one of the most enlightened men of his time, who for many years was Lieutenant-Bailiff of that island. He was born in 1635 and died in 1715, in his eighty-first year. In Vol. I., page 42, of his works, there occurs a passage of which the following is a translation:--       As Holy Scripture forbids us to allow witches to live, many      persons have made it a matter of conscience and of religion      to be severe in respect to such a crime. This principle has      without doubt made many persons credulous. How often have      purely accidental associations been taken as convincing      proofs? How many innocent people have perished in the flames      on the asserted testimony of supernatural circumstances? I      will not say that there are no witches; but ever since the      difficulty of convicting them has been recognized in the      island, they all seem to have disappeared, as though the      evidence of the times gone by had been but an illusion. This      shows the instability of all things here below.  Coming down now to within a century ago, we find an article in the _Gazette de Jersey_, of Saturday, March 10th, 1787, complaining of the great increase of wizards and witches in the island, as well as of their supposed victims. The writer says that the scenes then taking place were truly ridiculous, and he details a case that had just occurred at St. Brelade's as corroborative of his assertion. It appears that a worthy householder there, had dreamed that a certain wizard appeared to him and ordered him to poison himself at a date which was specified, enjoining him above all things not to mention the incident to anyone. The poor silly fellow was dreadfully distressed, for he felt convinced that he would have to carry out the disagreeable command. At the same time he was quite unable to keep so momentous a secret to himself, and so he divulged the approaching tragedy to his wife. The good woman's despair was fully equal to his own, and after much anxious domestic counsel they determined to seek the good offices of a White Witch (_une Quéraude_), with the hope that her incantations might overcome the evil spells of the Black Witch who was causing all the mischief. This White Witch prescribed lengthened fasting and other preparations for the great ordeal, and on a given night she and the bewitched householder, together with his wife and four or five trusty friends with drawn swords, shut themselves up in a room, and commenced their mysterious ceremonial. There was the boiling of occult herbs; the roasting of a beeve's heart stuck full of nails and pins; the reading of certain passages from the family Bible; a mighty gesticulating with the swords, which were first thrust up the chimney to prevent the Black Witch from coming down, and anon were pointed earthward to hinder him from rising up; and so the ridiculous game went on. The only person who benefited was of course the imposter, who was paid for her services; while we may perhaps charitably hope that her dupes also were afterwards easier in their minds. The writer adds that many other persons besides this man at St. Brelade's, had latterly believed themselves bewitched, and had consulted wizards, who were thus driving a profitable trade.         *       *       *       *       *  Among the indications and symptoms of a witch, are reckoned various bodily marks and spots, said to be insensible to pain (page 20), inability to shed tears, &c. The pricking of witches was at one time a lucrative profession both in England and Scotland, one of the most noted prickers being a wretched imposter named Matthew Hopkins "]]]
