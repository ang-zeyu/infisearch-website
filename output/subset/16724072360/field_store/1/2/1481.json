To indulge this fondness for Oriental scenery poets do not hesitate to violate historical truth. Thus Charlemagne and his paladins are sent to the Holy Land in the \"Pèlerinage de Charlesmagne\"[27] and in the poem called the \"Karl Meinet,\" a German compilation of various legends about the Frankish hero.[28] Purely Germanic legends like those of Ortnit-Wolfdietrich and King Rother were orientalized in much the same manner.[29] As might be expected, it is in the court-epic and minstrel-poetry (_Spielmannsdichtung_) where this Oriental tendency manifests itself most markedly. A typical poem of this kind is \"Herzog Ernst.\" The hero, a purely German character, is made to go through a series of marvelous adventures in the East some of which bear a striking resemblance to those of Sindbad.[30] The later strophic version (14th century) and the prose-version of the _Volksbuch_ (probably 15th century) localize some of these adventures definitely in the _fernen India_.[31] Probably under the influence of this story the author of the incompleted \"Reinfrit von Braunschweig\" (about 1300) was induced to send his hero into Persia, to meet with somewhat similar experiences.[32] Heinrich von Neustadt likewise lays the scene of Apollonius' adventures in the golden valley Crysia bordering on India.[33] In the continuation of the Parzifal-story entitled \"Der Jüngere Titurel,\" which was written by Albrecht von Scharffenberg (about 1280), the Holy Grail is to be removed from a sinful world and to be carried to the East to be given to Feirefiz, half brother to Parzifal.[34] The meeting of Feirefiz with the knights furnishes the poet an opportunity of bringing in a learned disquisition on Prester John and his _drī India die wīten_, and finally this mythical monarch offers his crown to Parzifal, who henceforth is called _Priester Johanni_. In the poem of \"Lohengrin\", of unknown authorship, the knight when about to depart declares he has come from India where there is a house fairer than that at Montsalvatsch.[35]  Princes and princesses from India or Persia abound in the poems of the court-writers and minstrels. Thus in \"Solomon und Morolf\" Salme is the daughter of the King of _Endian_;[36] in Wolfram's \"Willehalm\" King Alofel of Persia and King Gorhant from the _Ganjes_ figure in the battle of Alischanz.[37] In Konrad von Würzburg's \"Trojanischer Krieg\" the kings Panfilias of Persia and Achalmus of India are on the Trojan side.[38] In the same poet's \"Partenopier\" the Sultan of Persia is the hero's chief rival.[39] In \"Der Jüngere Titurel\" Gatschiloe, a princess from India, becomes bearer of the Grail; similarly in a poem by Der Pleiaere, Flordibel, who comes to the Knights of the Round Table to learn courtly manners, reveals herself as a princess from India.[40] According to a poem of the fourteenth century the father of St. Christopher is king of Arabia and Persia.[41] Even the folk-epic \"Kudrun\" knows of Hilde of India, Hagen's wife.[42]  Again, wonderful things from India are abundant in this class of poetry. The magic lance which Wigalois receives, when he is about to do battle with a fire-spitting dragon, is from that land.[43] So also is the magic ring given to Reinfrit when he sets out on his crusade.[44] Wigamur's bride Dulceflur wears woven gold from the castle Gramrimort in India,[45] and in the \"Nibelungen\" Hagen and Dancwart, when going to the Isenstein, wear precious stones from that land.[46]  To some poets India and Persia are a sort of Ultima Thule to denote the furthest limits of the earth, as for instance, when in the \"Rolandslied\" Ganelun complains that for the ambition of Roland even Persia is not too far,[47] or, when in the \"Willehalm\" King Tybalt, whose daughter has been carried off, lets his complaint ring out as far as India.[48]  Examples might be multiplied. But they would all prove the same thing. India and Persia were magic names to conjure with; their languages and literatures were a book with seven seals to mediæval Europe.

FROM THE PORTUGUESE DISCOVERIES TO THE TIME OF SIR WILLIAM JONES.        Travels to India and Persia--Olearius and his Work--Progress       of Persian Studies--Roger--India's Language and Literature remain       unknown--Oriental Influence in German Literature.   Little can be said of Oriental influence on German poetry during the next three centuries after the Great Age of Discovery, and in an investigation like the one in hand, which confines itself to poetry only, this chapter might perhaps be omitted. Nevertheless a brief consideration of this influence on German literature in general during this period forms an appropriate transition to the time when the Oriental movement in Germany really began.  After the Portuguese had sailed around Africa, direct and uninterrupted communication with the far East was established. Portuguese, Dutch, French and English merchants appeared successively on the scene to get their share of the rich India commerce. German merchants also made a transitory effort. The firm of the Welsers in Augsburg sent two representatives who accompanied the expedition of Francisco d' Almeida in 1505 and that of Tristão da Cunha in the following year. But conditions were not favorable and the attempt was not renewed.[49]  Travels to India and Persia now multiplied rapidly, and accounts of such travels became very common; so common, in fact, that already in the sixteenth century collections of them were made, the best known being the _Novus Orbis_ of Grynaeus, and the works of Ramusio and Hakluyt.

The man wiped his forehead.  \"Sure not,\" he said nervously. \"I was goin' to say look around your chicken yard and see the chickens. I can't buy chickens without I see them, can I? Some folks might, but I can't with the kind of customers I've got. I've got mighty particular customers, and I pay extra prices so as to get the best for them, and when I go out and look around the chicken yard--\"  \"How much you pay for such nice, big, fat chickens, mebby?\" asked Mrs. Gratz.  \"Well, I'll tell you,\" said the man. \"Seven cents a pound is regular, ain't it? Well, I pay twelve. I'll give you twelve cents, and pay you right now, and take all the chickens you've got. That's my rule. But, if you want to let me go out and see the chickens first, and pick out the kind my regular customers like, I pay twenty cents a pound. But I won't pay twenty cents without I can see the chickens first.\"  \"Sure,\" said Mrs. Gratz. \"I wouldn't do it, too. Mebby I go out and bring in a couple such chickens for you to look at? Yes?\"  \"No, don't!\" said the man impulsively. \"Don't do it! It wouldn't be no good. I've got to see the chickens on the hoof, as I might say.\"  \"On the hoofs?\" said Mrs. Gratz. \"Such poultry don't have no hoofs.\"  \"Runnin' around,\" explained the visitor. \"Runnin' around in the coop. I can tell if a chicken has got any disease that my trade wouldn't like, if I see it runnin' around in the coop. There's a lot in the way a chicken runs. In the way it h'ists up its leg, for instance. That's what the trade calls 'on the hoof.' So I'll just go out and have a look around the coop--\"  \"For twenty cents a pound anybody could let buyers see their chickens on the hoof, I guess,\" said Mrs. Gratz.  \"Now, that's the way to talk!\" exclaimed the man.  \"Only but I ain't got any such chickens,\" said Mrs. Gratz. \"So it ain't of use to look how they walk. So good-bye.\"  \"Now, say--\" said the man, but Mrs. Gratz closed the door in his face.  \"I guess such a Santy Claus came back yet,\" said Mrs. Gratz when she went into the room where Mrs. Flannery was sitting. \"But it ain't any use. He don't leave many more such presents.\"  \"Th' impidince of him!\" exclaimed Mrs. Flannery.  \"For nine hundred dollars I could be impudent, too,\" said Mrs. Gratz calmly. \"But I don't like such nowadays Santy Clauses, coming back all the time. Once, when I believes in Santy Clauses, they don't come back so much.\"  The thin Santa Claus had not gone far. He had crossed the street and stood gazing at Mrs. Gratz's door, and now he crossed again and knocked. Mrs. Gratz arose and went to the door.  \"I believe he comes back once yet,\" she said to Mrs. Flannery, and opened the door. He had, indeed, come back.  \"Now see here,\" he said briskly, \"ain't your name Mrs. Gratz? Well, I knowed it was, and I knowed you was a widow lady, and that's why I said I was a chicken buyer. I didn't want to frighten you. But I ain't no chicken buyer.\"  \"No?\" asked Mrs. Gratz.  \"No, I ain't. I just said that so I could get a look at your chicken yard. I've got to see it. What I am is chicken-house inspector for the Ninth Ward, and the Mayor sent me up here to inspect your chicken house, and I've got to do it before I go away, or lose my job. I'll go right out now, and it'll be all over in a minute--\"  \"I guess it ain't some use,\" said Mrs. Gratz. \"I guess I don't keep any more chickens. They go too easy. Yesterday I have plenty, and to-day I haven't any.\"  \"That's it!\" said the thin Santa Claus. \"That's just it! That's the way toober-chlosis bugs act--quick like that. They're a bad epidemic--toober-chlosis bugs is. You see how they act--yesterday you have chickens, and last night the toober-chlosis bugs gets at them, and this morning they've eat them all up.\"  \"Goodness!\" exclaimed Mrs. Gratz without emotion. \"With the fedders and the bones, too?\"  \"Sure,\" said the thin Santa Claus. \"Why, them toober-chlosis bugs is perfectly ravenous. Once they git started they eat feathers and bones and feet and all--a chicken hasn't no chance at all. That's why the Mayor sent me up here. He heard all your chickens was gone, and gone quick, and he says to me, 'Toober-chlosis bugs!' That's what he says, and he says, 'You ain't doing your duty. You ain't inspected Mrs. Gratz's chicken coop. You go and do it, or you're fired, see?' He says that, and he says, 'You inspect Mrs. Gratz's coop, and you kill off them bugs before they git into her house and eat her all up--bones and all.'\"  \"And fedders?\" asked Mrs. Gratz calmly.  \"No, he didn't say feathers. This ain't nothing to fool about. It's serious. So I'll go right out and have a look--\"  \"I guess such bugs ain't been in _my_ coop last night,\" said Mrs. Gratz carelessly. \"I aint afraid of such bugs in winter time.\"  \"Well, that's where you make your mistake,\" said the thin Santa Claus. \"Winter is just the bad time for them bugs. The more a toober-chlosis bug freezes up the more dangerous it is. In summer they ain't so bad--they're soft like and squash up when a chicken gits them, but in winter they freeze up hard and git brittle. Then a chicken comes along and grabs one, and it busts into a thousand pieces, and each piece turns into a new toober-chlosis bug and busts into a thousand pieces, and so on, and the chicken gits all filled full of toober-chlosis bugs before it knows it. When a chicken snaps up one toober-chlosis bug it has a million in it inside of half an hour and that chicken don't last long, and when the bugs make for the house--What's that on your dress there now?\"  Mrs. Gratz looked at her arm indifferently.  \"Nothing,\" she said.  \"I thought mebby it was a toober-chlosis bug had got on you already,\" said the thin Santa Claus. \"If it was you would be all eat up inside of half an hour. Them bugs is awful rapacious.\"  \"Yes?\" inquired Mrs. Gratz with interest. \"Such strong bugs, too, is it not?\"  \"You bet they are strong--\" began the stranger.  \"I should think so,\" interrupted Mrs. Gratz, \"to smash up padlocks on such chicken houses. You make me afraid of such bugs. I don't dare let you go out there to get your bones and feet all eat up by them. I guess not!\"  \"Well, you see--you see--\" said the thin Santa Claus, puzzled, and then he cheered up. \"You see, I ain't afraid of them. I've been fumigated against them. Fumigated and antiskep--antiskepticized. I've been vaccinated against them by the Board of Health. I'll show you the mark on my arm, if you want to see it.\"  \"No, don't,\" said Mrs. Gratz. \"I let you go and look in that chicken coop if you want to, but it ain't no use. There ain't nothing there.\"  The thin Santa Claus paused and looked at Mrs. Gratz with suspicion.  \"Why? Did you find it?\" he asked.  \"Find what?\" asked Mrs. Gratz innocently, and the thin Santa Claus sighed and walked around to the back of the house. Mrs. Gratz went with him.  As Mrs. Gratz watched the thin man search the chicken yard for toober-chlosis bugs all doubt that he was her Santa Claus left her mind. He made a most minute investigation, but he did it more as a man might search for a lost purse than as a health officer would search for germs. He even got down on his hands and knees and poked under the chicken house with a stick, and, when he had combed the chicken yard thoroughly and had looked all through the chicken house, he even searched the denuded vegetable garden in the back yard, and looked over the fence into Mrs. Flannery's yard. Evidently he was not pleased with his investigation, for he did not even say good-bye to Mrs. Gratz, but went away looking mad and cross.  When Mrs. Gratz went into her house she took her seat in her rocking-chair and began rocking herself calmly and slowly.  \"'T was him done it, sure,\" said Mrs. Flannery.  \"I don't like such come-agains, much,\" said Mrs. Gratz placidly. \"I try me to believe in such a Santy Claus, but I like not such come-agains. In Germany did not Santy Claus come back so much. I don't like a Santy Claus should be so anxious. Still I believes in him, but, if he has too many such come-agains, I don't believe in him much.\"  \"I would be settin' th' police on him, Santy Claus or no Santy Claus,\" said Mrs. Flannery vindictively; \"th' mean chicken thief!\"  \"Oh,\" said Mrs. Gratz easily, \"I guess I don't care much should a nine-hundred-dollar Santy Claus steal some chickens. I ain't mad.\"  But she was a little provoked when another knock came at the door a few minutes later, and when, on opening it, she saw the thin Santa Claus before her again.  \"So!\" she said, \"Santy Claus is back yet once!\"  \"What's that?\" asked the man suspiciously.  \"I say, what it is you want?\" said Mrs. Gratz.  \"Oh!\" said the man. \"Well, I ain't a-goin' to fool with you no longer, Mrs. Gratz. I'm a-goin' to tell you right out what I am and who I am. I'm a detective of the police, and I'm looking up a mighty bad character.\"  \"I guess I know right where you find one,\" said Mrs. Gratz politely.  \"Now, don't be funny,\" said the thin Santa Claus peevishly. \"Mebby you noticed I didn't say nothing when you spoke about that padlock being busted? Mebby you noticed how careful I looked over your chicken coop, and how I looked over the fence into the next yard? Well, I won't fool you. I ain't no chicken-yard inspector, and I ain't no chicken buyer--them was just my detective disguises. I'm out detecting a chicken thief--just a plain, ordinary chicken thief--and what I come for is clues.\"  \"Yes?\" said Mrs. Gratz. \"And what is it, such cloos? I haven't any clooses.\"  The thin Santa Claus seemed provoked.  \"Now, look here!\" he said. \"You may think this is funny, but it isn't. I have got to catch that chicken thief or I'll lose my job, and I can't catch him unless I have some clues to catch him with. Now, didn't you have some chickens stolen last night?\"  \"Chickens?\" asked"]]]
