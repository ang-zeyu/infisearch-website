This silence on the part of Galen in regard to Sextus increases the doubt, caused by Sextus' own criticism of the Empirical School of medicine, as to his having been an Empiricist. The question is made more complicated, as it is difficult to fix the identity of the Herodotus so often referred to by Galen.[3] As Galen died about 200 A.D. at the age of seventy,[4] we should fix the date of Sextus early in the third century, and that of Diogenes perhaps a little later than the middle, were it not that early in the third century the Stoics began to decline in influence, and could hardly have excited the warmth of animosity displayed by Sextus. We must then suppose that Sextus wrote at the very latter part of the second century, and either that Galen did not know him, or that Galen's books were published before Sextus became prominent either as a physician or as a Sceptic. The fact that he may have been better known as the latter than as the former does not sufficiently account for Galen's silence, as other Sceptics are mentioned by him of less importance than Sextus, and the latter, even if not as great a physician as Pseudo-Galen asserts, was certainly both a Sceptic and a physician, and must have belonged to one of the two medical schools so thoroughly discussed by Galen--either the Empirical or the Methodical. Therefore, if Sextus were a contemporary of Galen, he was so far removed from the circle of Galen's acquaintances as to have made no impression upon him, either as a Sceptic or a physician, a supposition that is very improbable. We must then fix the date of Sextus late in the second century, and conclude that the climax of his public career was reached after Galen had finished those of his writings which are still extant.

Sextus has a Latin name, but he was a Greek; we know this from his own statement.[1] We also know that he must have been a Greek from the beauty and facility of his style, and from his acquaintance with Greek dialects. The place of his birth can only, however, be conjectured, from arguments indirectly derived from his writings. His constant references throughout his works to the minute customs of different nations ought to give us a clue to the solution of this question, but strange to say they do not give us a decided one. Of these references a large number, however, relate to the customs of Libya, showing a minute knowledge in regard to the political and religious customs of this land that he displays in regard to no other country except Egypt.[2] Fabricius thinks Libya was not his birth place because of a reference which he makes to it in the _Hypotyposes_--[Greek: Thrakôn de kai Gaitoulôn (Libyôn de ethnos touto)].[3] This conclusion is, however, entirely unfounded, as the explanation of Sextus simply shows that the people whom he was then addressing were not familiar with the nations of Libya. Suidas speaks of two men called Sextus, one from Chæronea and one from Libya, both of whom he calls Sceptics, and to one of whom he attributes Sextus' books. All authorities agree in asserting that great confusion exists in the works of Suidas; and Fabricius, Zeller, and Pappenheim place no weight upon this testimony of Suidas.[4] Haas, however, contends[5] that it is unreasonable to suppose that this confusion could go as far as to attribute the writings of Sextus Empiricus to Sextus of Chæronea, and also make the latter a Sceptic, and he considers it far more reasonable to accept the testimony of Suidas, as it coincides so well with the internal evidence of Sextus' writings in regard to his native land. It is nevertheless evident, from his familiarity with the customs, language, and laws of Athens, Alexandria and Rome, that he must have resided at some time in each of these cities.      [1] _Adv. Math._ A. 246; _Hyp._ I. 152; _Hyp._ III. 211,         214.      [2] Haas _Op. cit._ p. 10.      [3] _Hyp._ III. 213.      [4] Pappenheim _Lebens. Ver. Sex.

Of all the problems connected with the historical details of the life of Sextus, the one that is the most difficult of solution, and also the most important for our present purpose of making a critical study of his teaching, is to fix the seat of the Sceptical School during the time that he was in charge of it. The _Hypotyposes_ are lectures delivered in public in that period of his life. Where then were they delivered? We know that the Sceptical School must have had a long continued existence as a definite philosophical movement, although some have contended otherwise. The fact of its existence as an organized direction of thought, is demonstrated by its formulated teachings, and the list given by Diogenes Laertius of its principal leaders,[1] and by references from the writings of Sextus. In the first book of _Hypotyposes_ he refers to Scepticism as a distinct system of philosophy, [Greek: kai taen diakrisin taes skepseos apo ton parakeimenon autae philosophion].[2] He speaks also of the older Sceptics,[3] and the later Sceptics.[4]  Pyrrho, the founder of the school, taught in Elis, his native village; but even as early as the time of Timon, his immediate follower, his teachings were somewhat known in Alexandria, where Timon for a while resided.[5] The immediate disciples of Timon, as given by Diogenes, were not men known in Greece or mentioned in Greek writings. Then we have the well-known testimony of Aristocles the Peripatetic in regard to Aenesidemus, that he taught Pyrrhonism in Alexandria[6]--[Greek: echthes kai proaen en Alexandreia tae kat' Aigypton Ainaesidaemos tis anazopyrein aerxato ton huthlon touton].      [1] Diog. XI. 12, 115, 116.      [2] _Hyp_. I. 5.      [3] _Hyp_. I. 36.      [4] _Hyp_. I. 164.      [5] Chaignet _Op. cit._ 45.      [6] Aristocles of Euseb. _Praep. Ev._ XIV. E. 446.  This was after the dogmatic tendency of the Academy under Antiochus and his followers had driven Pyrrhonism from the partial union with the Academy, which it had experienced after the breaking up of the school under the immediate successors of Timon. Aenesidemus taught about the time of our era in Alexandria, and established the school there anew; and his followers are spoken of in a way that presupposes their continuing in the same place. There is every reason to think that the connection of Sextus with Alexandria was an intimate one, not only because Alexandria had been for so long a time the seat of Pyrrhonism, but also from internal evidence from his writings and their subsequent historical influence; and yet the _Hypotyposes_ could not have been delivered in Alexandria, as he often refers to that place in comparison with the place where he was then speaking. He says, furthermore, that he teaches in the same place where his master taught.[1] [Greek: Blepon te hoti entha ho huphaegaetaes ho emos dielegeto, entautha ego nun dialegomai]. Therefore the school must have been removed from Alexandria, in or before the time of the teacher of Sextus, to some other centre. The _Hypotyposes_ are from beginning to end a direct attack on the Dogmatics; therefore Sextus must have taught either in some city where the dogmatic philosophy was strong, or in some rival philosophical centre. The _Hypotyposes_ show also that the writer had access to some large library. Alexandria, Rome and Athens are the three places the most probable for selection for such a purpose. For whatever reason the seat of the school was removed from Alexandria by the master of Sextus, or by himself, from the place where it had so long been united with the Empirical School of medicine, Athens would seem the most suitable city for its recontinuance, in the land where Pyrrhonism first had its birth. Sextus, however, in one instance, in referring to things invisible because of their outward relations, says in illustration, \"as the city of Athens is invisible to us at present.\"[2] In other places also he contrasts the Athenians with the people whom he is addressing, equally with the Alexandrians, thus putting Athens as well as Alexandria out of the question.      [1] _Hyp._ III. 120.      [2] _Hyp._ II. 98.  Of the different writers on Sextus Empiricus, those who have treated this part of the subject most critically are Haas and Pappenheim. We will therefore consider, somewhat at length, the results presented by these two authors. Haas thinks that the _Hypotyposes_ were delivered in Rome for the following reasons. Sextus' lectures must have been given in some centre of philosophical schools and of learning. He never opposes Roman relations to those of the place where he is speaking, as he does in regard to Athens and Alexandria. He uses the name \"Romans\" only three times,[1] once comparing them to the Rhodians, once to the Persians, and once in general to other nations.[2] In the first two of these references, the expression \"among the Romans\" in the first part of the antithesis is followed by the expression, \"among us,\" in the second part, which Haas understands to be synonymous. The third reference is in regard to a Roman law, and the use of the word 'Roman' does not at all show that Sextus was not then in Rome. The character of the laws referred to by Sextus as [Greek: par' haemin] shows that they were always Roman laws, and his definition of law[3] is especially a definition of Roman law. This argument might, it would seem, apply to any part of the Roman Empire, but Haas claims that the whole relation of law to custom as treated of by Sextus, and all his statements of customs forbidden at that time by law, point to Rome as the place of his residence. Further, Haas considers the Herodotus mentioned by Galen[4] as a prominent physician in Rome, to have been the predecessor and master of Sextus, in whose place Sextus says "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17567"],["title","The Way of the Wild (#1)"],["body","was sitting up, almost bolt-upright, and he was shading his eyes with his forepaws. A man could not have done more.  And, in fact, he did not look like an animal at all, but like some diabolically uncouth dwarf of the woods.  A squirrel was telling him, from a branch near by, just what everybody thought of his disgraceful appearance; and two willow-grouse were clucking at him from some hazel-tops; whilst a raven, black as coal against the white of the woods, jabbed in gruff and very rude remarks from time to time.  But Gulo was taking no notice of them.  He was used to attentions of that kind; it was a little compliment--of hate--they all paid him.  He was looking persistently down the ranked, narrowing perspective of the buttressed forest glade to where it faded in the blue-gray mist, southward, as if he expected something to come from there.  Something was coming from there now; and there had been a faint, uneasy sort of whisper in that direction for some time.  Now it was unmistakable.  A cow-elk, first of the wary ones to move on alarm, came trotting by, her Roman nose held well out; a red-deer hind, galloping lightly like some gigantic hare, her big ears turned astern; a wolf, head up, hackles alift, alternately loping and pivoting, to listen and look back, a wild reindeer, trotting heavily, but far more quickly than he seemed to be--all these passed, now on one side, now on the other, often only glimpses between the tree-boles, while the wolverine sat up and shaded his eyes with his paws.  Something was moving those beasts, those haunters of the forest, and no little thing either.  Something? What?    Very softly down the glade runs a waiting, watching shade,     And the whisper spreads and widens far and near;   And the sweat is on thy brow, for he passes even now--     He is Fear, O Little Hunter, he is Fear.   Down came Gulo in that grim silence which was, except for his domestic arguments, characteristic of the beast, and trotted to a pool hard by. The pool was spring-fed, and covered, as to every dead leaf and stone, with fine green moss of incomparable softness.  He drank swiftly and long, then flung about with a half-insolent, half-aggressive wave of his tail, and set off at a rolling, clumsy, shuffling shamble.  At ordinary times that deceiving gait would have left nearly everything behind, but this afternoon it was different.  Gulo had barely shed the shelter of the dotted thickets before he realized, and one saw, the fact.  He broke his trot.  He began to plunge.  Nevertheless, he got along.  There was pace, of a sort.  Certainly there was much effort. He would have outdistanced you or me easily in no time, but it was not you or I that came, and who could tell how fast that something might travel?  The trouble was the snow--that was the rub, and a very big and serious rub, too, for him.  Now, if the snow had been a little less it would not have mattered--a little more, and he could have run easily along the hard crust of it; but it was as it was, only about two feet, just enough to retard him, and no more.  And it is then, when the snow is like that, just above a couple of feet deep, that man can overtake friend wolverine--if he knows the way.  Most men don't.  On that he trusted.  At any other time--but this was not any other time.  Sound carries a long way in those still parts, and as he hurried Gulo heard, far, far behind in the forest, the faint, distant whir of a cock-capercailzie--the feathered giant of the woods--rising.  It was only a whisper, almost indistinguishable to our ears, but enough, quite enough, for him.  Taken in conjunction with the mysterious shifting of the elk and the red deer and the reindeer and the wolf, it was more than enough.  He increased his pace, and for the first time fear shone in his eyes--it was for the first time, too, in his life, I think.  A lynx passed him, bounding along on enormous, furry legs.  It looked all legs, and as it turned its grinning countenance to look at him he cursed it fluently, with a sudden savage growl, envious, perhaps, of its long, springing hindlegs.  Something, too--the same something--must have moved the lynx, and Gulo shifted the faster for the knowledge.  Half-an-hour passed, an hour slid by, and all the time Gulo kicked the miles behind him, with that dogged persistency that was part of his character.  Nothing had passed him for quite a while, and he was all alone in the utterly still, silent forest and the snow, pad-pad-padding along like a moving, squat machine rather than a beast.  At last he stopped, and, spinning round, sat up.  A gray-blue haze, like the color on a wood-pigeon, was creeping over everything, except in the west, where the sky held a faint, luminous, pinky tinge that foretold frost.  It was very cold, and the snow, which had never quite left off, was falling now only in single, big, wandering flakes.  The silence was almost terrifying.  Then, as Gulo sat up, from far away, but not quite so far away, his rounded ears, almost buried in fur, caught faintly--very, very faintly--a sound that brought him down on all fours, and sent him away again at a gallop with a strange new light burning in his little, wide-set eyes.  It was the unmistakable sound of a horse sneezing--once.  Gulo did not wait to hear if it sneezed twice.  He was gone in an instant.  Man, it seemed, had not been long in answering that challenge of the _cache_ escapade.  After that there was no such thing as time at all, only an everlasting succession of iron-hard tree-trunks sliding by, and shadows--they ran when they saw him, some of them, or gathered to stare with eyes that glinted--dancing past.  The moon came and hung itself up in the heavens, mocking him with a pitiless, stark glare.  (He would have given his right forepaw for a black night and a blinding snowstorm.) It almost seemed as if they were all laughing at him, Gulo the dreaded, the hated hater, because it was his turn at last, who had so freely dealt in it, to know fear.  Hours passed certainly, hours upon hours, and still, his breath coming quickly and less easily now with every mile, Gulo stuck to the job of putting the landscape behind him with that grim pertinacity of his that was almost fine.  At last the trees stopped abruptly, and he was heading, straighter than crows fly, across a plain.  The plain undulated a little, like a sea, a dead sea, of spotless white, with nothing alive upon it--only his hunched, slouching, untidy, squat form and his shadow, \"pacing\" him. At the top of the highest undulation he stopped, and glowered back along the trail.  Ahead, the forest, starting again, showed as a black band a quarter of an inch high.  Behind, the forest he had already left lay dwarfed in a ruled, serried line.  But that was not all.  Something was moving out upon the spotless plain of snow, something which appeared to be no more than crawling, ant-like, but was really traveling very fast.  It looked like a smudged dot, nothing more; but it was a horse, really, galloping hard, with a light sleigh, and a man in it, behind.  The horse had no bells, and it was not a reindeer as usual.  Pace was wanted here, and the snow was not deep enough to impede the horse, who possessed the required speed under such conditions.  The horse had been trotting along the trail, till it came to the place where Gulo had looked back and heard the sneeze, and knew he was being followed.  Then it had started to gallop, and, with ears back and teeth showing, had never ceased to gallop.  This, apparently, was not the first wolverine that horse had trailed.  It seemed to have a personal grudge against the whole fell clan of wolverine, and to be bent upon trampling Gulo to death.  Gulo watched it for about one quarter of a second.  Then he quitted, and the speed he had put up previously was nothing to that which he showed now--uselessly.  And, far behind him, the man in the sleigh drew out his rifle from under the fur rugs.  He judged that the time had about come.  The end was very near.  But he judged wrong.  Gulo made the wood at length.  With eyes of dull red, and breath coming in short, rending sobs, he got in among the trees.  He did it, though the feat seemed impossible, for the trees had been so very far away.  Got in among the trees--yes, but dead-beat, and--to what end?  To be \"treed\" ignominiously and calmly shot down, picked off like a squirrel on a larch-pole.  That was all.  And that was the orthodox end, the end the man took for granted.  In a few minutes the horse was in the forest too, was close behind Gulo.  In spite of the muffling effect of snow, his expectant ears could hear the quadruple thud of the galloping hoofs, and--  Hup!  Whuff!  Biff-biff!  Grrrrrr!  Grr-ur-ururrh!  Grrrr-urr!  It had all happened quick as a flash of light.  A huge, furry, reeking mass rising right in the wolverine's path from behind a tree, towering over him, almost mountainous to his eyes, like the very shape of doom! Himself hurling sideways, and rolling over and over, snarling, to prevent the crowning disaster of collision with this terrible portent! A blow, two blows, with enormous paws whose claws gleamed like skewers, whistling half-an-inch above his ducked head!  Jaws, monstrous and wet, grabbing at him in enraged confusion, and rumblings deep down in the inside of the thing that ran cold lightning-sparks all up his spine. That was what Gulo saw and heard.  The wolverine rolled, clawing and biting, three times, and without a pause sprang to his feet again, and leapt madly clear, stumbled on a hidden tree-root, rolled over again twice, and up, and hurled, literally with his last gasp and effort, headlong through the air behind a tree-bole, where he remained all asprawl and motionless, except for his heaving sides, too utterly done at last for _any_ terror to move him.  There followed instantly a horse's wild snort; another; a shout; the crack of a rifle cutting the silence as a knife cuts a taut"]]]
