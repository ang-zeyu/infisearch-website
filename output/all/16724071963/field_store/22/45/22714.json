It will unite our divided tribes into one great nation, and be the ruin of the tyrants.\"  \"I cannot argue with you, for I am no longer acquainted with the state of things in your native country, and besides, I believe you to be a wise man--not one who would plunge a nation into ruin merely for the gratification of his own ambition.  It is a fearful thing that entire nations should have to suffer for the guilt of one man, if that man be one who wears a crown.  And now, if my opinion is of any importance to you, tell me what the deed was which has roused your desire of vengeance.\"  \"Listen then, and never try again to turn me from my purpose.  You know the heir to the Egyptian throne, and you know Rhodopis too.  The former was, for many reasons, my mortal enemy, the latter the friend of every Greek, but mine especially.  When I was obliged to leave Egypt, Psamtik threatened me with his vengeance; your son Gyges saved my life.  A few weeks later my two children came to Naukratis, in order to follow me out to Sigeum.  Rhodopis took them kindly under her protection, but some wretch had discovered the secret and betrayed it to the prince.  The very next night her house was surrounded and searched,--my children found and taken captive.  Amasis had meanwhile become blind, and allowed his miserable son to do what he liked; the wretch dared to .  .  .\"  \"Kill your only son?\"  \"You have said it.\"  \"And your other child?\"  \"The girl is still in their hands.\"  \"They will do her an injury when they hear .  .  .\"  \"Let her die.  Better go to one's grave childless, than unrevenged.\"  \"I understand.  I cannot blame you any longer.  The boy's blood must be revenged.\"  And so saying, the old man pressed the Athenian's right hand.  The latter dried his tears, mastered his emotion, and cried: \"Let us go to the council of war now.  No one can be so thankful for Psamtik's infamous deeds as Cambyses.  That man with his hasty passions was never made to be a prince of peace.\"  \"And yet it seems to me the highest duty of a king is to work for the inner welfare of his kingdom.  But human beings are strange creatures; they praise their butchers more than their benefactors.  How many poems have been written on Achilles!  but did any one ever dream of writing songs on the wise government of Pittakus?\"  \"More courage is required to shed blood, than to plant trees.\"  \"But much more kindness and wisdom to heal wounds, than to make them.-- I have still one question which I should very much like to ask you, before we go into the hall.  Will Bartja be able to stay at Naukratis when Amasis is aware of the king's intentions?\"  \"Certainly not.  I have prepared him for this, and advised his assuming a disguise and a false name.\"  \"Did he agree?\"  \"He seemed willing to follow my advice.\"  \"But at all events it would be well to send a messenger to put him on his guard.\"  \"We will ask the king's permission.\"  \"Now we must go.  I see the wagons containing the viands of the royal household just driving away from the kitchen.\"  \"How many people are maintained from the king's table daily?\"  \"About fifteen thousand.\"  \"Then the Persians may thank the gods, that their king only takes one meal a day.\"       [This immense royal household is said to have cost 400 talents, that      is (L90,000.) daily.  Athenaus, Deipn.  p. 607.]     CHAPTER IX.  Six weeks after these events a little troop of horsemen might have been seen riding towards the gates of Sardis.  The horses and their riders were covered with sweat and dust.  The former knew that they were drawing near a town, where there would be stables and mangers, and exerted all their remaining powers; but yet their pace did not seem nearly fast enough to satisfy the impatience of two men, dressed in Persian costume, who rode at the head of the troop.  The well-kept royal road ran through fields of good black, arable land, planted with trees of many different kinds.  It crossed the outlying spurs of the Tmolus range of mountains.  At their foot stretched rows of olive, citron and plane-trees, plantations of mulberries and vines; at a higher level grew firs, cypresses and nut-tree copses.  Fig-trees and date-palms, covered with fruit, stood sprinkled over the fields; and the woods and meadows were carpeted with brightly-colored and sweetly-scented flowers.  The road led over ravines and brooks, now half dried up by the heat of summer, and here and there the traveller came upon a well at the side of the road, carefully enclosed, with seats for the weary, and sheltering shrubs.  Oleanders bloomed in the more damp and shady places; slender palms waved wherever the sun was hottest.  Over this rich landscape hung a deep blue, perfectly cloudless sky, bounded on its southern horizon by the snowy peaks of the Tmolus mountains, and on the west by the Sipylus range of hills, which gave a bluish shimmer in the distance.  The road went down into the valley, passing through a little wood of birches, the stems of which, up to the very tree-top, were twined with vines covered with bunches of grapes.  The horsemen stopped at a bend in the road, for there, before them, in the celebrated valley of the Hermus, lay the golden Sardis, formerly the capital of the Lydian kingdom and residence of its king, Croesus.  Above the reed-thatched roofs of its numerous houses rose a black, steep rock; the white marble buildings on its summit could be seen from a great distance.  These buildings formed the citadel, round the threefold walls of which, many centuries before, King Meles had carried a lion in order to render them impregnable.  On its southern side the citadel-rock was not so steep, and houses had been built upon it.  Croesus' former palace lay to the north, on the golden-sanded Pactolus.  This reddish-colored river flowed above the market-place, (which, to our admiring travellers, looked like a barren spot in the midst of a blooming meadow), ran on in a westerly direction, and then entered a narrow mountain valley, where it washed the walls of the temple of Cybele.  Large gardens stretched away towards the east, and in the midst of them lay the lake Gygaeus, covered with gay boats and snowy swans, and sparkling like a mirror.  A short distance from the lake were a great number of artificial mounds, three of which were especially noticeable from their size and height.       [See also Hamilton's Asia Minor, I.  P. 145. Herodotus (I. 93.)      calls the tombs of the Lydian kings the largest works of human      hands, next to the Egyptian and Babylonian.  These cone-shaped hills      can be seen to this day, standing near the ruins of Sardis, not far      from the lake of Gygaea.  Hamilton (Asia Minor, I.  p. i) counted      some sixty of them, and could not ride round the hill of Alayattes      in less than ten minutes.  Prokesch saw l00 such tumuli. The      largest, tomb of Alyattes, still measures 3400 feet in      circumference, and the length of its slope is 650 feet.  According      to Prokesch, gigantic Phallus columns lie on some of these graves.]  \"What can those strange-looking earth-heaps mean?\"  said Darius, the leader of the troop, to Prexaspes, Cambyses' envoy, who rode at his side.  \"They are the graves of former Lydian kings,\" was the answer.  \"The middle one is in memory of the princely pair Panthea and Abradatas, and the largest, that one to the left, was erected to the father of Croesus, Alyattes.  It was raised by the tradesmen, mechanics, and girls, to their late king, and on the five columns, which stand on its summit, you can read how much each of these classes contributed to the work.  The girls were the most industrious.  Gyges' grandfather is said to have been their especial friend.\"  \"Then the grandson must have degenerated very much from the old stock.\"  \"Yes, and that seems the more remarkable, because Croesus himself in his youth was by no means averse to women, and the Lydians generally are devoted to such pleasures.  You see the white walls of that temple yonder in the midst of its sacred grove.  That is the temple of the goddess of Sardis, Cybele or Ma, as they call her.  In that grove there is many a sheltered spot where the young people of Sardis meet, as they say, in honor of their goddess.\"  \"Just as in Babylon, at the festival of Mylitta.\"  \"There is the same custom too on the coast of Cyprus.  When I landed there on the way back from Egypt, I was met by a troop of lovely girls, who, with songs, dances, and the clang of cymbals, conducted me to the sacred grove of their goddess.\"  \"Well, Zopyrus will not grumble at Bartja's illness.\"  \"He will spend more of his time in the grove of Cybele, than at his patient's bedside.  How glad I shall be to see that jolly fellow again!\"  \"Yes, he'll keep you from falling into those melancholy fits that you have been so subject to lately.\"  \"You are quite right to blame me for those fits, and I must not yield to them, but they are not without ground.  Croesus says we only get low-spirited, when we are either too lazy or too weak to struggle against annoyances, and I believe he is right.  But no one shall dare to accuse Darius of weakness or idleness. If I can't rule the world, at least I will be my own master.\"  And as he said these words, the handsome youth drew himself up, and sat erect in his saddle.  His companion gazed in wonder at him.  \"Really, you son of Hystaspes,\" he said, \"I believe you must be meant for something great.  It was not by chance that, when you were still a mere child, the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5457"],["title","An Egyptian Princess — Volume 08 (#5)"],["body"," sent their favorite Cyrus that dream which induced him to order you into safe keeping.\"  \"And yet my wings have never appeared.\"  \"No bodily ones, certainly; but mental ones, likely enough.  Young man, young man, you're on a dangerous road.\"  \"Have winged creatures any need to be afraid of precipices?\"  \"Certainly; when their strength fails them.\"  \"But I am strong.\"  \"Stronger creatures than you will try to break your pinions.\"  \"Let them.  I want nothing but what is right, and shall trust to my star.\"  \"Do you know its name?\"  \"It ruled in the hour of my birth, and its name is Anahita.\"  \"I think I know better.  A burning ambition is the sun, whose rays guide all your actions.  Take care; I tried that way myself once; it leads to fame or to disgrace, but very seldom to happiness.  Fame to the ambitious is like salt water to the thirsty; the more he gets, the more he wants. I was once only a poor soldier, and am now Cambyses' ambassador.  But you, what can you have to strive for?  There is no man in the kingdom greater than yourself, after the sons of Cyrus .  .  .  Do my eyes deceive me?  Surely those two men riding to meet us with a troop of horsemen must be Gyges and Zopyrus.  The Angare, who left the inn before us, must have told them of our coming.\"  \"To be sure.  Look at that fellow Zopyrus, how he's waving and beckoning with that palm-leaf.\"  \"Here, you fellows, cut us a few twigs from those bushes-quick.  We'll answer his green palm-leaf with a purple pomegranate-branch.\"  In a few minutes the friends had embraced one another, and the two bands were riding together into the populous town, through the gardens surrounding the lake Gygaeus, the Sardians' place of recreation.  It was now near sunset, a cooler breeze was beginning to blow, and the citizens were pouring through the gates to enjoy themselves in the open air. Lydian and Persian warriors, the former wearing richly-ornamented helmets, the latter tiaras in the form of a cylinder, were following girls who were painted and wreathed.  Children were being led to the lake by their nurses, to see the swans fed.  An old blind man was seated under a plane-tree, singing sad ditties to a listening crowd and accompanying them on the Magadis, the twenty-stringed Lydian lute.  Youths were enjoying themselves at games of ball, ninepins, and dice, and half-grown girls screaming with fright, when the ball hit one of their group or nearly fell into the water.  The travellers scarcely noticed this gay scene, though at another time it would have delighted them.  They were too much interested in enquiring particulars of Bartja's illness and recovery.  At the brazen gates of the palace which had formerly belonged to Croesus, they were met by Oroetes, the satrap of Sardis, in a magnificent court- dress overloaded with ornaments.  He was a stately man, whose small penetrating black eyes looked sharply out from beneath a bushy mass of eyebrow.  His satrapy was one of the most important and profitable in the entire kingdom, and his household could bear a comparison with that of Cambyses in richness and splendor.  Though he possessed fewer wives and attendants than the king, it was no inconsiderable troop of guards, slaves, eunuchs and gorgeously-dressed officials, which appeared at the palace-gates to receive the travellers.  The vice-regal palace, which was still kept up with great magnificence, had been, in the days when Croesus occupied it, the most splendid of royal residences; after the taking of Sardis, however, the greater part of the dethroned king's treasures and works of art had been sent to Cyrus's treasure-house in Pasargadae.  When that time of terror had passed, the Lydians brought many a hidden treasure into the light of day once more, and, by their industry and skill in art during the peaceful years which they enjoyed under Cyrus and Cambyses, recovered their old position so far, that Sardis was again looked upon as one of the wealthiest cities of Asia Minor, and therefore, of the world.  Accustomed as Darius and Prexaspes were to royal splendor, they were still astonished at the beauty and brilliancy of the satrap's palace. The marble work, especially, made a great impression on them, as nothing of the kind was to be found in Babylon, Susa or Ecbatane, where burnt brick and cedar-wood supply the place of the polished marble.       [The palace of Persepolis did not exist at the date of our story.      It was built partly of black stone from Mount Rachmed, and partly of      white marble; it was probably begun by Darius.  The palace of Susa      was built of brick, (Strabo p. 728) that of Ecbatana of wood      overlaid with plates of gold of immense value, and roofed with tiles      made of the precious metals.]  They found Bartja lying on a couch in the great hall; he looked very pale, and stretched out his arms towards them.  The friends supped together at the satrap's table and then retired to Bartja's private room, in order to enjoy an undisturbed conversation.  \"Well, Bartja, how did you come by this dangerous illness?\"  was Darius' first question after they were seated.  \"I was thoroughly well, as you know,\" said Bartja, \"when we left Babylon, and we reached Germa, a little town on the Sangarius, without the slightest hindrance.  The ride was long and we were very tired, burnt too by the scorching May sun, and covered with dust; the river flows by the station, and its waves looked so clear and bright--so inviting for a bathe--that in a minute Zopyrus and I were off our horses, undressed, and in the water.  Gyges told us we were very imprudent, but we felt confident that we were too much inured to such things to get any harm, and very much enjoyed our swim in the cool, green water.  Gyges, perfectly calm as usual, let us have our own way, waited till our bath was over, and then plunged in himself.  \"In two hours we were in our saddles again, pushing on as if for our very lives, changing horses at every station, and turning night into day.  \"We were near Ipsus, when I began to feel violent pains in the head and limbs.  I was ashamed to say anything about it and kept upright on my saddle, until we had to take fresh horses at Bagis.  Just as I was in the very act of mounting, I lost my senses and strength, and fell down on the ground in a dead faint.\"  \"Yes, a pretty fright you gave us,\"  interrupted Zopyrus, \"by dropping down in that fashion.  It was fortunate that Gyges was there, for I lost my wits entirely; he, of course, kept his presence of mind, and after relieving his feelings in words not exactly flattering to us two, he behaved like a circumspect general.--A fool of a doctor came running up and protested that it was all over with poor Bart, for which I gave him a good thrashing.\"  \"Which he didn't particularly object to,\" said the satrap, laughing, \"seeing that you told them to lay a gold stater on every stripe.\"  \"Yes, yes, my pugnacity costs me very dear sometimes.  But to our story. As soon as Bartja had opened his eyes, Gyges sent me off to Sardis to fetch a good physician and an easy travelling-carriage.  That ride won't so soon be imitated.  An hour before I reached the gates my third horse knocked up under me, so I had to trust to my own legs, and began running as fast as I could.  The people must all have thought me mad.  At last I saw a man on horseback--a merchant from Kelaenze--dragged him from his horse, jumped into the saddle, and, before the next morning dawned, I was back again with our invalid, bringing the best physician in Sardis, and Oroetes' most commodious travelling-carriage.  We brought him to this house at a slow footpace, and here a violent fever came on, he became delirious, talked all the nonsense that could possibly come into a human brain, and made us so awfully anxious, that the mere remembrance of that time brings the big drops of perspiration to my forehead.\"  Bartja took his friend's hand: \"I owe my life to him and Gyges,\" said he, turning to Darius.  \"Till to-day, when they set out to meet you, they have never left me for a minute; a mother could not have nursed her sick child more carefully.  And Oroetes, I am much obliged to you too; doubly so because your kindness subjected you to annoyance.\"  \"How could that be?\"  asked Darius.  \"That Polykrates of Samos, whose name we heard so often in Egypt, has the best physician that Greece has ever produced.  While I was lying here ill, Oroetes wrote to this Democedes, making him immense promises, if he would only come to Sardis directly.  The Sainian pirates, who infest the whole Ionian coast, took the messenger captive and brought Oroetes' letter to their master Polykrates.  He opened it, and sent the messenger back with the answer, that Democedes was in his pay, and that if Oroetes needed his advice he must apply to Polykrates himself.  Our generous friend submitted for my sake, and asked the Samian to send his physician to Sardis.\"  \"Well,\" said Prexaspes, \"and what followed?\"  The proud island-prince sent him at once.  He cured me, as you see, and left us a few days ago loaded with presents.\"  \"Well,\" interrupted Zopyrus, \"I can quite understand, that Polykrates likes to keep his physician near him.  I assure you, Darius, it would not be easy to find his equal.  He's as handsome as Minutscher, as clever as Piran Wisa, as strong as Rustem, and as benevolent and helpful as the god Soma. I wish you could have seen how well he threw those round metal plates he calls discs.  I am no weakling, but when we wrestled he soon threw me.  And then he could tell such famous stories--stories that made a man's heart dance within him.\"       [This very Oroetes afterwards succeeded in enticing Polykrates to      Sardis and there crucified him.  Herod. III. 120-125.  Valerius      Maximus VI.  9. 5.]  \"We know just such a fellow too,\" said Darius, smiling at his friend's enthusiasm.  \"That Athenian Phanes, who came to prove our innocence.\"  \"The physician Democedes is from"]]]
