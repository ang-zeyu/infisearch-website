Ameni was everywhere: now with the singers, now with the magicians, who were to effect wonderful transformations before the astonished multitude; now with the workmen, who were erecting thrones for the Regent, the emissaries from other collegiate foundations--even from so far as the Delta--and the prophets from Thebes; now with the priests, who were preparing the incense, now with the servants, who were trimming the thousand lamps for the illumination at night--in short everywhere; here inciting, there praising.  When he had convinced himself that all was going on well he desired one of the priests to call Pentaur.  After the departure of the exiled prince Rameri, the young priest had gone to the work-room of his friend Nebsecht.  The leech went uneasily from his phials to his cages, and from his cages back to his flasks.  While he told Pentaur of the state he had found his room in on his return home, he wandered about in feverish excitement, unable to keep still, now kicking over a bundle of plants, now thumping down his fist on the table; his favorite birds were starved to death, his snakes had escaped, and his ape had followed their example, apparently in his fear of them.  \"The brute, the monster!\"  cried Nebsecht in a rage.  He has thrown over the jars with the beetles in them, opened the chest of meal that I feed the birds and insects upon, and rolled about in it; he has thrown my knives, prickers, and forceps, my pins, compasses, and reed pens all out of window; and when I came in he was sitting on the cupboard up there, looking just like a black slave that works night and day in a corn-mill; he had got hold of the roll which contained all my observations on the structure of animals--the result of years of study-and was looking at it gravely with his head on one side.  I wanted to take the book from him, but he fled with the roll, sprang out of window, let himself down to the edge of the well, and tore and rubbed the manuscript to pieces in a rage. I leaped out after him, but he jumped into the bucket, took hold of the chain, and let himself down, grinning at me in mockery, and when I drew him up again he jumped into the water with the remains of the book.\"  \"And the poor wretch is drowned?\"  asked Pentaur.  \"I fished him up with the bucket, and laid him to dry in the sun; but he had been tasting all sorts of medicines, and he died at noon.  My observations are gone!  Some of them certainly are still left; however, I must begin again at the beginning.  You see apes object as much to my labors as sages; there lies the beast on the shelf.\"  Pentaur had laughed at his friend's story, and then lamented his loss; but now he said anxiously:  \"He is lying there on the shelf?  But you forget that he ought to have been kept in the little oratory of Toth near the library.  He belongs to the sacred dogfaced apes,       [The dog faced baboon, Kynokephalos, was sacred to Toth as the      Moongod.  Mummies of these apes have been found at Thebes and      Hermopolis, and they are often represented as reading with much      gravity.  Statues of them have been found to great quantities, and      there is a particularly life-like picture of a Kynokephalos in      relief on the left wall of the library of the temple of Isis at      Philoe.]  and all the sacred marks were found upon him.  The librarian gave him into your charge to have his bad eye cured.\"  \"That was quite well,\" answered Nebsecht carelessly.  \"But they will require the uninjured corpse of you, to embalm it,\" said Pentaur.  \"Will they?\"  muttered Nebsecht; and he looked at his friend like a boy who is asked for an apple that has long been eaten.  \"And you have already been doing something with it,\" said Pentaur, in a tone of friendly vexation.  The leech nodded.  \"I have opened him, and examined his heart.'  \"You are as much set on hearts as a coquette!\"  said Pentaur.  \"What is become of the human heart that the old paraschites was to get for you?\"  Nebsecht related without reserve what the old man had done for him, and said that he had investigated the human heart, and had found nothing in it different from what he had discovered in the heart of beasts.  \"But I must see it in connection with the other organs of the human body,\" cried he; \"and my decision is made.  I shall leave the House of Seti, and ask the kolchytes to take me into their guild.  If it is necessary I will first perform the duties of the lowest paraschites.\"  Pentaur pointed out to the leech what a bad exchange he would be making, and at last exclaimed, when Nebsecht eagerly contradicted him, \"This dissecting of the heart does not please me.  You say yourself that you learned nothing by it.  Do you still think it a right thing, a fine thing--or even useful?\"  \"I do not trouble myself about it,\" replied Nebsecht.  \"Whether my observations seem good or evil, right or heinous, useful or useless, I want to know how things are, nothing more.\"  \"And so for mere curiosity,\" cried Pentaur, \"you would endanger the blissful future of thousands of your fellow-men, take upon yourself the most abject duties, and leave this noble scene of your labors, where we all strive for enlightenment, for inward knowledge and truth.\"  The naturalist laughed scornfully; the veins swelled angrily in Pentaur's forehead, and his voice took a threatening tone as he asked:  \"And do you believe that your finger and your eyes have lighted on the truth, when the noblest souls have striven in vain for thousands of years to find it out?  You descend beneath the level of human understanding by madly wallowing in the mire; and the more clearly you are convinced that you have seized the truth, the more utterly you are involved in the toils of a miserable delusion.\"  \"If I believed I knew the truth should I so eagerly seek it?\"  asked Nebsecht.  \"The more I observe and learn, the more deeply I feel my want of knowledge and power.\"  \"That sounds modest enough,\" said the poet, \"but I know the arrogance to which your labors are leading you.  Everything that you see with your own eyes and touch with your own hand, you think infallible, and everything that escapes your observation you secretly regard as untrue, and pass by with a smile of superiority.  But you cannot carry your experiments beyond the external world, and you forget that there are things which lie in a different realm.\"  \"I know nothing of those things,\" answered Nebsecht quietly.  \"But we--the Initiated,\" cried Pentaur, \"turn our attention to them also. Thoughts--traditions--as to their conditions and agency have existed among us for a thousand years; hundreds of generations of men have examined these traditions, have approved them, and have handed them down to us.  All our knowledge, it is true, is defective, and yet prophets have been favored with the gift of looking into the future, magic powers have been vouchsafed to mortals.  All this is contrary to the laws of the external world, which are all that you recognize, and yet it can easily be explained if we accept the idea of a higher order of things.  The spirit of the Divinity dwells in each of us, as in nature.  The natural man can only attain to such knowledge as is common to all; but it is the divine capacity for serene discernment--which is omniscience--that works in the seer; it is the divine and unlimited power--which is omnipotence --that from time to time enables the magician to produce supernatural effects!\"  \"Away with prophets and marvels!\"  cried Nebsecht.  \"I should have thought,\" said Pentaur, \"that even the laws of nature which you recognize presented the greatest marvels daily to your eyes; nay the Supreme One does not disdain sometimes to break through the common order of things, in order to reveal to that portion of Himself which we call our soul, the sublime Whole of which we form part--Himself. Only today you have seen how the heart of the sacred ram--\"  \"Man, man!\"  Nebsecht interrupted, \"the sacred heart is the heart of a hapless sheep that a sot of a soldier sold for a trifle to a haggling grazier, and that was slaughtered in a common herd.  A proscribed paraschites put it into the body of Rui, and--and--\" he opened the cupboard, threw the carcase of the ape and some clothes on to the floor, and took out an alabaster bowl which he held before the poet--\"the muscles you see here in brine, this machine, once beat in the breast of the prophet Rui.  My sheep's heart wilt be carried to-morrow in the procession!  I would have told you all about it if I had not promised the old man to hold my tongue, and then--But what ails you, man?\"  Pentaur had turned away from his friend, and covered his face with his hands, and he groaned as if he were suffering some frightful physical pain. Nebsecht divined what was passing in the mind of his friend.  Like a child that has to ask forgiveness of its mother for some misdeed, he went close up to Pentaur, but stood trembling behind him not daring to speak to him.  Several minutes passed.  Suddenly Pentaur raised his head, lifted his hands to heaven, and cried:  \"O Thou! the One!--though stars may fall from the heavens in summer nights, still Thy eternal and immutable laws guide the never-resting planets in their paths.  Thou pure and all-prevading Spirit, that dwellest in me, as I know by my horror of a lie, manifest Thyself in me-- as light when I think, as mercy when I act, and when I speak, as truth-- always as truth!\"  The poet spoke these words with absorbed fervor, and Nebsecht heard them as if they were speech from some distant and beautiful world.  He went affectionately up to his friend, and eagerly held out his hand.  Pentaur grasped it, pressed it warmly, and said:  \"That was a fearful moment!  You do not know what Ameni has been to me, and now, now!\"  He hardly had ceased speaking when steps were heard approaching the physician's room, and a young priest requested the friends to appear at once in the meeting-room "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5444"],["title","Uarda : a Romance of Ancient Egypt — Volume 06 (#5)"],["body","the Initiated.  In a few moments they both entered the great hall, which was brilliantly lighted.  Not one of the chiefs of the House of Seti was absent.  Ameni sat on a raised seat at a long table; on his right hand was old Gagabu, on his left the third Prophet of the temple.  The principals of the different orders of priests had also found places at the table, and among them the chief of the haruspices, while the rest of the priests, all in snow-white linen robes, sat, with much dignity, in a large semicircle, two rows deep.  In the midst stood a statue of the Goddess of truth and justice.  Behind Ameni's throne was the many-colored image of the ibis-headed Toth, who presided over the measure and method of things, who counselled the Gods as well as men, and presided over learning and the arts.  In a niche at the farther end of the hall were painted the divine Triad of Thebes, with Rameses I. and his son Seti, who approached them with offerings. The priests were placed with strict regard to their rank, and the order of initiation.  Pentaur's was the lowest place of all.  No discussion of any importance had as yet taken place, for Ameni was making enquiries, receiving information, and giving orders with reference to the next day's festival.  All seemed to be well arranged, and promised a magnificent solemnity; although the scribes complained of the scarce influx of beasts from the peasants, who were so heavily taxed for the war, and although that feature would be wanting in the procession which was wont to give it the greatest splendor--the presence of the king and the royal family.  This circumstance aroused the disapprobation of some of the priests, who were of opinion that it would be hazardous to exclude the two children of Rameses, who remained in Thebes, from any share in the solemnities of the feast.  Ameni then rose.  \"We have sent the boy Rameri,\" he said, \"away from this house.  Bent-Anat must be purged of her uncleanness, and if the weak superior of the temple of Anion absolves her, she may pass for purified over there, where they live for this world only, but not here, where it is our duty to prepare the soul for death.  The Regent, a descendant of the great deposed race of kings, will appear in the procession with all the splendor of his rank.  I see you are surprised, my friends.  Only he!  Aye!  Great things are stirring, and it may happen that soon the mild sun of peace may rise upon our war-ridden people.\"  \"Miracles are happening,\" he continued, \"and in a dream I saw a gentle and pious man on the throne of the earthly vicar of Ra.  He listened to our counsel, he gave us our due, and led back to our fields our serfs that had been sent to the war; he overthrew the altars of the strange gods, and drove the unclean stranger out from this holy land.\"  \"The Regent Ani!\"  exclaimed Septah.  An eager movement stirred the assembly, but Ameni went on:  \"Perhaps it was not unlike him, but he certainly was the One; he had the features of the true and legitimate descendants of Ra, to whom Rui was faithful, in whose breast the heart of the sacred ram found a refuge. To-morrow this pledge of the divine grace shall be shown to the people, and another mercy will also be announced to them.  Hear and praise the dispensations of the Most High!  An hour ago I received the news that a new Apis, with all the sacred marks upon him, has been found in the herds of Ani at Hermonthis.\"  Fresh excitement was shown by the listening conclave.  Ameni let their astonishment express itself freely, but at last he exclaimed:  \"And now to settle the last question.  The priest Pentaur, who is now present, has been appointed speaker at the festival to-morrow.  He has erred greatly, yet I think we need not judge him till after the holy day, and, in consideration of his former innocence, need not deprive him of the honorable office.  Do you share my wishes?  Is there no dissentient voice?  Then come forward, you, the youngest of us all, who are so highly trusted by this holy assembly.\"  Pentaur rose and placed himself opposite to Ameni, in order to give, as he was required to do, a broad outline of the speech he proposed to deliver next day to the nobles and the people.  The whole assembly, even his opponents, listened to him with approbation. Ameni, too, praised him, but added:  \"I miss only one thing on which you must dwell at greater length, and treat with warmer feeling--I mean the miracle which has stirred our souls to-day.  We must show that the Gods brought the sacred heart--\"  \"Allow me,\" said Pentaur, interrupting the high-priest, and looking earnestly into those eyes which long since he had sung of--\"Allow me to entreat you not to select me to declare this new marvel to the people.\"  Astonishment was stamped on the face of every member of the assembly. Each looked at his neighbor, then at Pentaur, and at last enquiringly at Ameni.  The superior knew Pentaur, and saw that no mere whimsical fancy, but some serious motive had given rise to this refusal.  Horror, almost aversion, had rung in his tone as he said the words 'new marvel.' He doubted the genuineness of this divine manifestation!  Ameni gazed long and enquiringly into Pentaur's eyes, and then said: \"You are right, my friend.  Before judgment has been passed on you, before you are reinstated in your old position, your lips are not worthy to announce this divine wonder to the multitude.  Look into your own soul, and teach the devout a horror of sin, and show them the way, which you must now tread, of purification of the heart.  I myself will announce the miracle.\"  The white-robed audience hailed this decision of their master with satisfaction.  Ameni enjoined this thing on one, on another, that; and on all, perfect silence as to the dream which he had related to them, and then he dissolved the meeting.  He begged only Gagabu and Pentaur to remain.  As soon as they were alone Ameni asked the poet \"Why did you refuse to announce to the people the miracle, which has filled all the priests of the Necropolis with joy?\"  \"Because thou hast taught me,\" replied Pentaur, \"that truth is the highest aim we can have, and that there is nothing higher.\"  \"I tell you so again now,\" said Ameni.  \"And as you recognize this doctrine, I ask you, in the name of the fair daughter of Ra.  Do you doubt the genuineness of the miracle that took place under our very eyes?\"  \"I doubt it,\" replied Pentaur.  \"Remain on the high stand-point of veracity,\" continued Ameni, \"and tell us further, that we may learn, what are the scruples that shake thy faith?\"  \"I know,\" replied the poet with a dark expression, \"that the heart which the crowd will approach and bow to, before which even the Initiated prostrate themselves as if it had been the incarnation of Ra, was torn from the bleeding carcass of a common sheep, and smuggled into the kanopus which contained the entrails of Rui.\"  Ameni drew back a step, and Gagabu cried out \"Who says so?  Who can prove it?  As I grow older I hear more and more frightful things!\"  \"I know it,\" said Pentaur decidedly.  \"But I can, not reveal the name of him from whom I learned it.\"  \"Then we may believe that you are mistaken, and that some impostor is fooling you.  We will enquire who has devised such a trick, and he shall be punished!  To scorn the voice of the Divinity is a sin, and he who lends his ear to a lie is far from the truth.  Sacred and thrice sacred is the heart, blind fool, that I purpose to-morrow to show to the people, and before which you yourself--if not with good will, then by compulsion --shall fall, prostrate in the dust.  \"Go now, and reflect on the words with which you will stir the souls of the people to-morrow morning; but know one thing--Truth has many forms, and her aspects are as manifold as those of the Godhead.  As the sun does not travel over a level plain or by a straight path--as the stars follow a circuitous course, which we compare with the windings of the snake Mehen,--so the elect, who look out over time and space, and on whom the conduct of human life devolves, are not only permitted, but commanded, to follow indirect ways in order to reach the highest aims, ways that you do not understand, and which you may fancy deviate widely from the path of truth.  You look only at to-day, we look forward to the morrow, and what we announce as truth you must needs believe.  And mark my words: A lie stains the soul, but doubt eats into it.\"  Ameni had spoken with strong excitement; when Pentaur had left the room, and he was alone with Gagabu, he exclaimed:  \"What things are these?  Who is ruining the innocent child-like spirit of this highly favored youth?\"  \"He is ruining it himself,\" replied Gagabu.  \"He is putting aside the old law, for he feels a new one growing up in his own breast.\"  \"But the laws,\" exclaimed Ameni, \"grow and spread like shadowy woods; they are made by no one.  I loved the poet, yet I must restrain him, else he will break down all barriers, like the Nile when it swells too high. And what he says of the miracle--\"  \"Did you devise it?\"  \"By the Holy One--no!\"  cried Ameni.  And yet Pentaur is sincere, and inclined to faith,\" said the old man doubtfully.  \"I know it,\" returned Ameni.  \"It happened as he said.  But who did it, and who told him of the shameful deed?\"  Both the priests stood thoughtfully gazing at the floor.  Ameni first broke the silence.  \"Pentaur came in with Nebsecht,\" he exclaimed, \"and they are intimate friends.  Where was the leech while I was staying in Thebes?\"  \"He was taking care of the child hurt by Bent-Anat--the child of the paraschites Pinem, and he stayed there three days,\" replied Gagabu.  \"And it was Pinem,\" said Ameni, \"that opened the body of Rui!  Now I know who has dimmed Pentaur's faith.  It was that inquisitive stutterer, and he shall be made to repent of it.  For the present let us think of to-morrow's feast, but the day after I will examine that nice couple, and will act with"]]]
