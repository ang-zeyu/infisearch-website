But this fuming and groaning are just as unavailing as my raging and cursing by the death-bed of my mother, who was dead all the same and never got up again.  \"If this Publius were a Greek, a Syrian, an Egyptian--nay, were he my own brother--I tell you, Eulaeus, he should not long stand in my way; but he is plenipotentiary from Rome, and Rome is Fate--Rome is Fate.\"  The king flung himself back on to his cushions with a deep sigh, and as if crushed with despair, hiding his face in the soft pillows; but Eulaeus crept noiselessly up to the young giant, and whispered in his ear with solemn deliberateness:  \"Rome is Fate, but even Rome can do nothing against Fate.  Publius Scipio must die because he is ruining your mother's daughter, and stands in the way of your saving Egypt.  The Senate would take a terrible revenge if he were murdered, but what can they do if wild beasts fall on their plenipotentiary, and tear him to pieces?\"  \"Grand! splendid!\"  cried Euergetes, springing again to his feet, and opening his large eyes with radiant surprise and delight, as if heaven itself had opened before them, revealing the sublime host of the gods feasting at golden tables.  \"You are a great man, Eulaeus, and I shall know how to reward you; but do you know of such wild beasts as we require, and do they know how to conduct themselves so that no one shall dare to harbor even the shadow of a suspicion that the wounds torn by their teeth and claws were inflicted by daggers, pikes or spearheads?\"  \"Be perfectly easy,\" replied Eulaeus.  \"These beasts of prey have already had work to do here in Memphis, and are in the service of the king--\"  \"Aha! of my gentle brother!\"  laughed Euergetes.  \"And he boasts of never having killed any one excepting in battle--and now--\"  \"But Philometor has a wife,\" interposed Eulaeus; and Euergetes went on.  \"Aye, woman, woman! what is there that a man may not learn from a woman?\"  Then he added in a lower tone: \"When can your wild beasts do their work?\"  \"The sun has long since risen; before it sets I will have made my preparations, and by about midnight, I should think, the deed may be done.  We will promise the Roman a secret meeting, lure him out to the temple of Serapis, and on his way home through the desert--\"  \"Aye, then,--\" cried the king, making a thrust at his own breast as though his hand held a dagger, and he added in warning: \"But your beasts must be as powerful as lions, and as cautious-as cautious, as cats.  If you want gold apply to Komanus, or, better still, take this purse.  Is it enough?  Still I must ask you; have you any personal ground of hatred against the Roman?\"  \"Yes,\" answered Eulaeus decisively.  \"He guesses that I know all about him and his doings, and he has attacked me with false accusations which may bring me into peril this very day.  If you should hear that the queen has decided on throwing me into prison, take immediate steps for my liberation.\"  \"No one shall touch a hair of your head; depend upon that.  I see that it is to your interest to play my game, and I am heartily glad of it, for a man works with all his might for no one but himself.  And now for the last thing:  When will you fetch my little Hebe?\"  \"In an hour's time I am going to Asclepiodorus; but we must not demand the girl till to-morrow, for today she must remain in the temple as a decoy-bird for Publius Scipio.\"  \"I will take patience; still I have yet another charge to give you. Represent the matter to the high-priest in such a way that he shall think my brother wishes to gratify one of my fancies by demanding--absolutely demanding--the water-bearer on my behalf.  Provoke the man as far as is possible without exciting suspicion, and if I know him rightly, he will stand upon his rights, and refuse you persistently.  Then, after you, will come Komanus from me with greetings and gifts and promises.  \"To-morrow, when we have done what must be done to the Roman, you shall fetch the girl in my brother's name either by cunning or by force; and the day after, if the gods graciously lend me their aid in uniting the two realms of Egypt under my own hand, I will explain to Asclepiodorus that I have punished Philometor for his sacrilege against his temple, and have deposed him from the throne.  Serapis shall see which of us is his friend.  \"If all goes well, as I mean that it shall, I will appoint you Epitropon of the re-united kingdom--that I swear to you by the souls of my deceased ancestors.  I will speak with you to-day at any hour you may demand it.\"  Eulaeus departed with a step as light as if his interview with the king had restored him to youth.  When Hierax, Komanus, and the other officers returned to the room, Euergetes gave orders that his four finest horses from Cyrene should be led before noonday to his friend Publius Cornelius Scipio, in token of his affection and respect.  Then he suffered himself to be dressed, and went to Aristarchus with whom he sat down to work at his studies.     CHAPTER XIV.  The temple of Serapis lay in restful silence, enveloped in darkness, which so far hid its four wings from sight as to give it the aspect of a single rock-like mass wrapped in purple mist.  Outside the temple precincts too all had been still; but just now a clatter of hoofs and rumble of wheels was audible through the silence, otherwise so profound that it seemed increased by every sound.  Before the vehicle which occasioned this disturbance had reached the temple, it stopped, just outside the sacred acacia-grove, for the neighing of a horse was now audible in that direction.  It was one of the king's horses that neighed; Lysias, the Greek, tied him up to a tree by the road at the edge of the grove, flung his mantle over the loins of the smoking beast; and feeling his way from tree to tree soon found himself by the Well of the Sun where he sat down on the margin.  Presently from the east came a keen, cold breeze, the harbinger of sunrise; the gray gloaming began by degrees to pierce and part the tops of the tall trees, which, in the darkness, had seemed a compact black roof.  The crowing of cocks rang out from the court-yard of the temple, and, as the Corinthian rose with a shiver to warm himself by a rapid walk backwards and forwards, he heard a door creak near the outer wall of the temple, of which the outline now grew sharper and clearer every instant in the growing light.  He now gazed with eager observation down the path which, as the day approached, stood out with increasing clearness from the surrounding shades, and his heart began to beat faster as he perceived a figure approaching the well, with rapid steps.  It was a human form that advanced towards him--only one--no second figure accompanied it; but it was not a man--no, a woman in a long robe.  Still, she for whom he waited was surely smaller than the woman, who now came near to him.  Was it the elder and not the younger sister, whom alone he was anxious to speak with, who came to the well this morning?  He could now distinguish her light foot-fall--now she was divided from him by a young acacia-shrub which hid her from his gaze-now she set down two water-jars on the ground--now she briskly lifted the bucket and filled the vessel she held in her left hand--now she looked towards the eastern horizon, where the dim light of dawn grew broader and brighter, and Lysias thought he recognized Irene--and now--Praised be the gods!  he was sure; before him stood the younger and not the elder sister; the very maiden whom he sought.  Still half concealed by the acacia-shrub, and in a soft voice so as not to alarm her, he called Irene's name, and the poor child's blood froze with terror, for never before had she been startled by a man here, and at this hour.  She stood as if rooted to the spot, and, trembling with fright, she pressed the cold, wet, golden jar, sacred to the god, closely to her bosom.  Lysias repeated her name, a little louder than before, and went on, but in a subdued voice:  \"Do not be frightened, Irene; I am Lysias, the Corinthian--your friend, whose pomegranate-blossom you wore yesterday, and who spoke to you after the procession.  Let me bid you good morning!\"  At these words the girl let her hand fall by her side, still holding the jar, and pressing her right hand to her heart, she exclaimed, drawing a deep breath:  \"How dreadfully you frightened me!  I thought some wandering soul was calling me that had not yet returned to the nether world, for it is not till the sun rises that spirits are scared away.\"  \"But it cannot scare men of flesh and blood whose purpose is good. I, you may believe me, would willingly stay with you, till Helios departs again, if you would permit me.\"  \"I can neither permit nor forbid you anything,\" answered Irene.  \"But, how came you here at this hour?\"  \"In a chariot,\" replied Lysias smiling.  \"That is nonsense--I want to know what you came to the Well of the Sun for at such an hour.\"  \"I What but for you yourself?  You told me yesterday that you were glad to sleep, and so am I; still, to see you once more, I have been only to glad to shorten my night's rest considerably.\"  \"But, how did you know?\"  \"You yourself told me yesterday at what time you were allowed to leave the temple.\"  \"Did I tell you?  Great Serapis!  how light it is already.  I shall be punished if the water-jar is not standing on the altar by sunrise, and there is Klea's too to be filled.\"  \"I will fill it for you directly--there--that is done; and now I will carry them both for you to the end of the grove, if you will promise me to "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5463"],["title","The Sisters — Volume 3 (#5)"],["body","soon, for I have many things to ask you.\"  \"Go on--only go on,\" said the girl; \"I know very little; but ask away, though you will not find much to be made of any answers that I can give.\"  \"Oh! yes, indeed, I shall--for instance, if I asked you to tell me all about your parents.  My friend Publius, whom you know, and I also have heard how cruelly and unjustly they were punished, and we would gladly do much to procure their release.\"  \"I will come--I will be sure to come,\" cried Irene loudly and eagerly, \"and shall I bring Klea with me?  She was called up in the middle of the night by the gatekeeper, whose child is very ill.  My sister is very fond of it, and Philo will only take his medicine from her.  The little one had gone to sleep in her lap, and his mother came and begged me to fetch the water for us both.  Now give me the jars, for none but we may enter the temple.\"  \"There they are.  Do not disturb your sister on my account in her care of the poor little boy, for I might indeed have one or two things to say to you which she need not hear, and which might give you pleasure.  Now, I am going back to the well, so farewell!  But do not let me have to wait very long for you.\"  He spoke in a tender tone of entreaty, and the girl answered low and rapidly as she hurried away from him:  \"I will come when the sun is up.\"  The Corinthian looked after her till she had vanished within the temple, and his heart was stirred--stirred as it had not been for many years.  He could not help recalling the time when he would teaze his younger sister, then still quite a child, putting her to the test by asking her, with a perfectly grave face, to give him her cake or her apple which he did not really want at all.  The little one had almost always put the thing he asked for to his mouth with her tiny hands, and then he had often felt exactly as he felt now.  Irene too was still but a child, and no less guileless than his darling in his own home; and just as his sister had trusted him--offering him the best she had to give--so this simple child trusted him; him, the profligate Lysias, before whom all the modest women of Corinth cast down their eyes, while fathers warned their growing-up sons against him; trusted him with her virgin self--nay, as he thought, her sacred person.  \"I will do thee no harm, sweet child!\"  he murmured to himself, as he presently turned on his heel to return to the well.  He went forward quickly at first, but after a few steps he paused before the marvellous and glorious picture that met his gaze.  Was Memphis in flames?  Had fire fallen to burn up the shroud of mist which had veiled his way to the temple?  The trunks of the acacia-trees stood up like the blackened pillars of a burning city, and behind them the glow of a conflagration blazed high up to the heavens.  Beams of violet and gold slipped and sparkled between the boughs, and danced among the thorny twigs, the white racemes of flowers, and the tufts of leaves with their feathery leaflets; the clouds above were fired with tints more pure and tender than those of the roses with which Cleopatra had decked herself for the banquet.  Not like this did the sun rise in his own country!  Or, was it perhaps only that in Corinth or in Athens at break of day, as he staggered home drunk from some feast, he had looked more at the earth than at the heavens?  His horses began now to neigh loudly as if to greet the steeds of the coming Sun-god.  Lysias hurried to them through the grove, patted their shining necks with soothing words, and stood looking down at the vast city at his feet, over which hung a film of violet mist--at the solemn Pyramids, over which the morning glow flung a gay robe of rose-color--on the huge temple of Ptah, with the great colossi in front of its pylons-- on the Nile, mirroring the glory of the sky, and on the limestone hills behind the villages of Babylon and Troy, about which he had, only yesterday, heard a Jew at the king's table relating a legend current among his countrymen to the effect that these hills had been obliged to give up all their verdure to grace the mounts of the sacred city Hierosolyma.  The rocky cliffs of this barren range glowed at this moment like the fire in the heart of the great ruby which had clasped the festal robe of King Euergetes across his bull-neck, as it reflected the shimmer of the tapers: and Lysias saw the day-star rising behind the range with blinding radiance, shooting forth rays like myriads of golden arrows, to rout and destroy his foe, the darkness of night.  Eos, Helios, Phoebus Apollo--these had long been to him no more than names, with which he associated certain phenomena, certain processes and ideas; for he when he was not luxuriating in the bath, amusing himself in the gymnasium, at cock or quail-fights, in the theatre or at Dionysiac processions--was wont to exercise his wits in the schools of the philosophers, so as to be able to shine in bandying words at entertainments; but to-day, and face to face with this sunrise, he believed as in the days of his childhood--he saw in his mind's eye the god riding in his golden chariot, and curbing his foaming steeds, his shining train floating lightly round him, bearing torches or scattering flowers--he threw up his arms with an impulse of devotion, praying aloud:  \"To-day I am happy and light of heart.  To thy presence do I owe this, O! Phoebus Apollo, for thou art light itself.  Oh! let thy favors continue--\"  But he here broke off in his invocation, and dropped his arms, for he heard approaching footsteps.  Smiling at his childish weakness--for such he deemed it that he should have prayed--and yet content from his pious impulse, he turned his back on the sun, now quite risen, and stood face to face with Irene who called out to him:  \"I was beginning to think that you had got out of patience and had gone away, when I found you no longer by the well.  That distressed me--but you were only watching Helios rise.  I see it every day, and yet it always grieves me to see it as red as it was to-day, for our Egyptian nurse used to tell me that when the east was very red in the morning it was because the Sun-god had slain his enemies, and it was their blood that colored the heavens, and the clouds and the hills.\"  \"But you are a Greek,\" said Lysias, \"and you must know that it is Eos that causes these tints when she touches the horizon with her rosy fingers before Helios appears.  Now to-day you are, to me, the rosy dawn presaging a fine day.\"  \"Such a ruddy glow as this,\" said Irene, \"forebodes great heat, storms, and perhaps heavy rain, so the gatekeeper says; and he is always with the astrologers who observe the stars and the signs in the heavens from the towers near the temple-gates.  He is poor little Philo's father. I wanted to bring Klea with me, for she knows more about our parents than I do; but he begged me not to call her away, for the child's throat is almost closed up, and if it cries much the physician says it will choke, and yet it is never quiet but when it is lying in Klea's arms.  She is so good--and she never thinks of herself; she has been ever since midnight till now rocking that heavy child on her lap.\"  \"We will talk with her presently,\" said the Corinthian.  \"But to-day it was for your sake that I came; you have such merry eyes, and your little mouth looks as if it were made for laughing, and not to sing lamentations.  How can you bear being always in that shut up dungeon with all those solemn men in their black and white robes?\"  There are some very good and kind ones among them.  I am most fond of old Krates, he looks gloomy enough at every one else; but with me only he jokes and talks, and he often shows me such pretty and elegantly wrought things.\"  \"Ah! I told you just now you are like the rosy dawn before whom all darkness must vanish.\"  \"If only you could know how thoughtless I can be, and how often I give trouble to Klea, who never scolds me for it, you would be far from comparing me with a goddess.  Little old Krates, too, often compares me to all sorts of pretty things, but that always sounds so comical that I cannot help laughing.  I had much rather listen to you when you flatter me.\"  \"Because I am young and youth suits with youth.  Your sister is older, and so much graver than you are.  Have you never had a companion of your own age whom you could play with, and to whom you could tell everything?\"  \"Oh!  yes when I was still very young; but since my parents fell into trouble, and we have lived here in the temple, I have always been alone with Klea.  What do you want to know about my father?\"  \"That I will ask you by-and-by.  Now only tell me, have you never played at hide and seek with other girls?  May you never look on at the merry doings in the streets at the Dionysiac festivals?  Have you ever ridden in a chariot?\"  \"I dare say I have, long ago--but I have forgotten it.  How should I have any chance of such things here in the temple?  Klea says it is no good even to think of them.  She tells me a great deal about our parents--how my mother took care of us, and what my father used to say.  Has anything happened that may turn out favorably for him?  Is it possible that the king should have learned the truth?  Make haste and ask your questions at once, for I have already been too long out here.\"  The impatient steeds neighed again as she spoke, and Lysias, to whom this chat with Irene was perfectly enchanting, but who nevertheless had not for a moment lost sight of his object, hastily pointed to the spot where his horses were standing, and said:  \"Did you hear the neighing of those mettlesome horses?  They brought me hither, and I can guide them well; nay, at the last Isthmian games I won the crown with my own quadriga.  You said you had never ridden standing in a chariot.  How would you like to try for once how it feels?  I will drive you with pleasure up and down behind the grove for a little while.\""]]]
