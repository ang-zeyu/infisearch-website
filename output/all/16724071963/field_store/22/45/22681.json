You knew him, you can understand what I mean. Now, mention your wish; my heart is as calmly quiet as the Nile waters which are flowing by so quietly, and I am ready to hear it, be it good or evil.\"  \"I am glad to see you thus,\" said the Athenian.  \"If you had remembered the noble friend of wisdom, as Pythagoras was wont to call himself a little sooner, your soul would have regained its balance yesterday.  The master enjoins us to look back every evening on the events, feelings and actions of the day just past.  \"Now had you done this, you would have felt that the unfeigned admiration of all your guests, among whom were men of distinguished merit, outweighed a thousandfold the injurious words of a drunken libertine; you would have felt too that you were a friend of the gods, for was it not in your house that the immortals gave that noble old man at last, after his long years of misfortune, the greatest joy that can fall to the lot of any human being? and did they not take from you one friend only in order to replace him in the same moment, by another and a better?  Come, I will hear no contradiction.  Now for my request.  \"You know that people sometimes call me an Athenian, sometimes a Halikarnassian.  Now, as the Ionian, AEolian and Dorian mercenaries have never been on good terms with the Karians, my almost triple descent (if I may call it so) has proved very useful to me as commander of both these divisions.  Well qualified as Aristomachus may be for the command, yet in this one point Amasis will miss me; for I found it an easy matter to settle the differences among the troops and keep them at peace, while he, as a Spartan, will find it very difficult to keep right with the Karian soldiers.  \"This double nationality of mine arises from the fact that my father married a Halikarnassian wife out of a noble Dorian family, and, at the time of my birth, was staying with her in Halikarnassus, having come thither in order to take possession of her parental inheritance.  So, though I was taken back to Athens before I was three months old, I must still be called a Karian, as a man's native land is decided by his birthplace.  \"In Athens, as a young nobleman, belonging to that most aristocratic and ancient family, the Philaidae, I was reared and educated in all the pride of an Attic noble.  Pisistratus, brave and clever, and though of equal, yet by no means of higher birth, than ourselves, for there exists no family more aristocratic than my father's, gained possession of the supreme authority.  Twice, the nobles, by uniting all their strength, succeeded in overthrowing him, and when, the third time, assisted by Lygdamis of Naxos, the Argives and Eretrians, he attempted to return, we opposed him again.  We had encamped by the temple of Minerva at Pallene, and were engaged in sacrificing to the goddess, early, before our first meal, when we were suddenly surprised by the clever tyrant, who gained an easy, bloodless victory over our unarmed troops.  As half of the entire army opposed to the tyrant was under my command, I determined rather to die than yield, fought with my whole strength, implored the soldiers to remain steadfast, resisted without yielding a point, but fell at last with a spear in my shoulder.  \"The Pisistratidae became lords of Athens.  I fled to Halikarnassus, my second home, accompanied by my wife and children.  There, my name being known through some daring military exploits, and, through my having once conquered in the Pythian games, I was appointed to a command in the mercenary troops of the King of Egypt; accompanied the expedition to Cyprus, shared with Aristomachus the renown of having conquered the birthplace of Aphrodite for Amasis, and finally was named commander-in- chief of all the mercenaries in Egypt.  \"Last summer my wife died; our children, a boy of eleven and a girl of ten years, remained with an aunt in Halikarnassus.  But she too has followed to the inexorable Hades, and so, only a few days ago I sent for the little ones here.  They cannot, however, possibly reach Naukratis in less than three weeks, and yet they will already have set out on their journey before a letter to countermand my first order could reach them.  \"I must leave Egypt in fourteen days, and cannot therefore receive them myself.  \"My own intentions are to go to the Thracian Chersonese, where my uncle, as you know, has been called to fill a high office among the Dolonki. The children shall follow me thither; my faithful old slave Korax will remain in Naukratis on purpose to bring them to me.  \"Now, if you will show to me that you are in deed and truth my friend, will you receive the little ones and take care of them till the next ship sails for Thrace?  But above all, will you carefully conceal them from the eyes of the crown-prince's spies?  You know that Psamtik hates me mortally, and he could easily revenge himself on the father through the children.  I ask you for this great favor, first, because I know your kindness by experience; and secondly, because your house has been made secure by the king's letter of guarantee, and they will therefore be safe here from the inquiries of the police; notwithstanding that, by the laws of this most formal country, all strangers, children not excepted, must give up their names to the officer of the district.  \"You can now judge of the depth of my esteem, Rhodopis; I am committing into your hands all that makes life precious to me; for even my native land has ceased to be dear while she submits so ignominiously to her tyrants.  Will you then restore tranquillity to an anxious father's heart, will you--?\"  \"I will, Phanes, I will!\"  cried the aged woman in undisguised delight. \"You are not asking me for any thing, you are presenting me with a gift. Oh, how I look forward already to their arrival!  And how glad Sappho will be, when the little creatures come and enliven her solitude!  But this I can assure you, Phanes, I shall not let my little guests depart with the first Thracian ship.  You can surely afford to be separated from them one short half-year longer, and I promise you they shall receive the best lessons, and be guided to all that is good and beautiful.\"  \"On that head I have no fear,\" answered Phanes, with a thankful smile. \"But still you must send off the two little plagues by the first ship; my anxiety as to Psamtik's revenge is only too well grounded.  Take my most heartfelt thanks beforehand for all the love and kindness which you will show to my children.  I too hope and believe, that the merry little creatures will be an amusement and pleasure to Sappho in her lonely life.\"  \"And more,\" interrupted Rhodopis looking down; \"this proof of confidence repays a thousand-fold the disgrace inflicted on me last night in a moment of intoxication.--But here comes Sappho!\"     CHAPTER IV.  Five days after the evening we have just described at Rhodopis' house, an immense multitude was to be seen assembled at the harbor of Sais.  Egyptians of both sexes, and of every age and class were thronging to the water's edge.  Soldiers and merchants, whose various ranks in society were betokened by the length of their white garments, bordered with colored fringes, were interspersed among the crowd of half-naked, sinewy men, whose only clothing consisted of an apron, the costume of the lower classes.  Naked children crowded, pushed and fought to get the best places.  Mothers in short cloaks were holding their little ones up to see the sight, which by this means they entirely lost themselves; and a troop of dogs and cats were playing and fighting at the feet of these eager sight-seers, who took the greatest pains not to tread on, or in any way injure the sacred animals.       [According to various pictures on the Egyptian monuments.  The      mothers are from Wilkinson III.  363.  Isis and Hathor, with the      child Horus in her lap or at her breast, are found in a thousand      representations, dating both from more modern times and in the Greek      style.  The latter seem to have served as a model for the earliest      pictures of the Madonna holding the infant Christ.]  The police kept order among this huge crowd with long staves, on the metal heads of which the king's name was inscribed.  Their care was especially needed to prevent any of the people from being pushed into the swollen Nile, an arm of which, in the season of the inundations, washes the walls of Sais.  On the broad flight of steps which led between two rows of sphinxes down to the landing-place of the royal boats, was a very different kind of assembly.  The priests of the highest rank were seated there on stone benches.  Many wore long, white robes, others were clad in aprons, broad jewelled collars, and garments of panther skins.  Some had fillets adorned with plumes that waved around brows, temples, and the stiff structures of false curls that floated over their shoulders; others displayed the glistening bareness of their smoothly-shaven skulls.  The supreme judge was distinguished by the possession of the longest and handsomest plume in his head-dress, and a costly sapphire amulet, which, suspended by a gold chain, hung on his breast.  The highest officers of the Egyptian army wore uniforms of gay colors,97 and carried short swords in their girdles.  On the right side of the steps a division of the body-guard was stationed, armed with battleaxes, daggers, bows, and large shields; on the left, were the Greek mercenaries, armed in Ionian fashion.  Their new leader, our friend Aristomachus, stood with a few of his own officers apart from the Egyptians, by the colossal statues of Psamtik I., which had been erected on the space above the steps, their faces towards the river.  In front of these statues, on a silver chair, sat Psamtik, the heir to the throne: He wore a close-fitting garment of many colors, interwoven with gold, and was surrounded by the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5451"],["title","An Egyptian Princess — Volume 02 (#2)"],["body"," distinguished among the king's courtiers, chamberlains, counsellors, and friends, all bearing staves with ostrich feathers and lotus-flowers.  The multitude gave vent to their impatience by shouting, singing, and quarrelling; but the priests and magnates on the steps preserved a dignified and solemn silence.  Each, with his steady, unmoved gaze, his stiffly-curled false wig and beard, and his solemn, deliberate manner, resembled the two huge statues, which, the one precisely similar to the other, stood also motionless in their respective places, gazing calmly into the stream.  At last silken sails, chequered with purple and blue, appeared in sight.  The crowd shouted with delight.  Cries of, \"They are coming!  Here they are!\"  \"Take care, or you'll tread on that kitten,\"  \"Nurse, hold the child higher that she may see something of the sight.\"  \"You are pushing me into the water, Sebak!\"  \"Have a care Phoenician, the boys are throwing burs into your long beard.\"  \"Now, now, you Greek fellow, don't fancy that all Egypt belongs to you, because Amasis allows you to live on the shores of the sacred river!\"  \"Shameless set, these Greeks, down with them!\" shouted a priest, and the cry was at once echoed from many mouths. \"Down with the eaters of swine's flesh and despisers of the gods!\"       [The Egyptians, like the Jews, were forbidden to eat swine's flesh.      This prohibition is mentioned in the Ritual of the Dead, found in a      grave in Abd-el-Qurnah, and also in other places.  Porphyr. de      Abstin. IV.  The swine was considered an especially unclean animal      pertaining to Typhon (Egyptian, Set) as the boar to Ares, and      swineherds were an especially despised race.  Animals with bristles      were only sacrificed at the feasts of Osiris and Eileithyia.  Herod.      I. 2. 47.  It is probable that Moses borrowed his prohibition of      swine's flesh from the Egyptian laws with regard to unclean      animals.]  From words they were proceeding to deeds, but the police were not to be trifled with, and by a vigorous use of their staves, the tumult was soon stilled.  The large, gay sails, easily to be distinguished among the brown, white and blue ones of the smaller Nile-boats which swarmed around them, came nearer and nearer to the expectant throng.  Then at last the crown-prince and the dignitaries arose from their seats.  The royal band of trumpeters blew a shrill and piercing blast of welcome, and the first of the expected boats stopped at the landing-place.  It was a rather long, richly-gilded vessel, and bore a silver sparrow- hawk as figure-head.  In its midst rose a golden canopy with a purple covering, beneath which cushions were conveniently arranged.  On each deck in the forepart of the ship sat twelve rowers, their aprons attached by costly fastenings.       [Splendid Nile-boats were possessed, in greater or less numbers, by      all the men of high rank.  Even in the tomb of Ti at Sakkara, which      dates from the time of the Pyramids, we meet with a chief overseer      of the vessels belonging to a wealthy Egyptian.]  Beneath the canopy lay six fine-looking men in glorious apparel; and before the ship had touched the shore the youngest of these, a beautiful fair-haired youth, sprang on to the steps.  Many an Egyptian girl's mouth uttered a lengthened \"Ah\" at this glorious sight, and even the grave faces of some of the dignitaries brightened into a friendly smile.  The name of this much-admired youth was Bartja.       [This Bartja is better known under the name of Smerdis, but on what      account the Greeks gave him this name is not clear.  In the      cuneiform inscriptions of Bisitun or Behistun, he is called Bartja,      or, according to Spiegel, Bardiya.  We have chosen, for the sake of      the easy pronunciation, the former, which is Rawlinson's simplified      reading of the name.]  He was the son of the late, and brother of the reigning king of Persia, and had been endowed by nature with every gift that a youth of twenty years could desire for himself.  Around his tiara was wound a blue and white turban, beneath which hung fair, golden curls of beautiful, abundant hair; his blue eyes sparkled with life and joy, kindness and high spirits, almost with sauciness; his noble features, around which the down of a manly beard was already visible, were worthy of a Grecian sculptor's chisel, and his slender but muscular figure told of strength and activity.  The splendor of his apparel was proportioned to his personal beauty.  A brilliant star of diamonds and turquoises glittered in the front of his tiara.  An upper garment of rich white and gold brocade reaching just below the knees, was fastened round the waist with a girdle of blue and white, the royal colors of Persia.  In this girdle gleamed a short, golden sword, its hilt and scabbard thickly studded with opals and sky-blue turquoises.  The trousers were of the same rich material as the robe, fitting closely at the ankle, and ending within a pair of short boots of light-blue leather.  The long, wide sleeves of his robe displayed a pair of vigorous arms, adorned with many costly bracelets of gold and jewels; round his slender neck and on his broad chest lay a golden chain.  Such was the youth who first sprang on shore.  He was followed by Darius, the son of Hystaspes, a young Persian of the blood royal, similar in person to Bartja, and scarcely less gorgeously apparelled than he.  The third to disembark was an aged man with snow-white hair, in whose face the gentle and kind expression of childhood was united, with the intellect of a man, and the experience of old age.  His dress consisted of a long purple robe with sleeves, and the yellow boots worn by the Lydians;--his whole appearance produced an impression of the greatest modesty and a total absence of pretension.       [On account of these boots, which are constantly mentioned, Croesus      was named by the oracle \"soft-footed.\"]  Yet this simple old man had been, but a few years before, the most envied of his race and age; and even in our day at two thousand years' interval, his name is used as a synonyme for the highest point of worldly riches attainable by mankind.  The old man to whom we are now introduced is no other than Croesus, the dethroned king of Lydia, who was then living at the court of Cambyses, as his friend and counsellor, and had accompanied the young Bartja to Egypt, in the capacity of Mentor.  Croesus was followed by Prexaspes, the king's Ambassador, Zopyrus, the son of Megabyzus, a Persian noble, the friend of Bartja and Darius; and, lastly, by his own son, the slender, pale Gyges, who after having become dumb in his fourth year through the fearful anguish he had suffered on his father's account at the taking of Sardis, had now recovered the power of speech.  Psamtik descended the steps to welcome the strangers.  His austere, sallow face endeavored to assume a smile.  The high officials in his train bowed down nearly to the ground, allowing their arms to hang loosely at their sides.  The Persians, crossing their hands on their breasts, cast themselves on the earth before the heir to the Egyptian throne.  When the first formalities were over, Bartja, according to the custom of his native country, but greatly to the astonishment of the populace, who were totally unaccustomed to such a sight, kissed the sallow cheek of the Egyptian prince; who shuddered at the touch of a stranger's unclean lips, then took his way to the litters waiting to convey him and his escort to the dwelling designed for them by the king, in the palace at Sais.  A portion of the crowd streamed after the strangers, but the larger number remained at their places, knowing that many a new and wonderful sight yet awaited them.  \"Are you going to run after those dressed-up monkeys and children of Typhon, too?\"  asked an angry priest of his neighbor, a respectable tailor of Sais.  \"I tell you, Puhor, and the high-priest says so too, that these strangers can bring no good to the black land!  I am for the good old times, when no one who cared for his life dared set foot on Egyptian soil.  Now our streets are literally swarming with cheating Hebrews, and above all with those insolent Greeks whom may the gods destroy!       [The Jews were called Hebrews (Apuriu) by the Egyptians; as brought      to light by Chabas.  See Ebers, Aegypten I.  p. 316.  H. Brugsch      opposes this opinion.]  \"Only look, there is the third boat full of strangers!  And do you know what kind of people these Persians are?  The high-priest says that in the whole of their kingdom, which is as large as half the world, there is not a single temple to the gods; and that instead of giving decent burial to the dead, they leave them to be torn in pieces by dogs and vultures.\"       [These statements are correct, as the Persians, at the time of the      dynasty of the Achaemenidae, had no temples, but used fire-altars      and exposed their dead to the dogs and vultures.  An impure corpse      was not permitted to defile the pure earth by its decay; nor might      it be committed to the fire or water for destruction, as their      purity would be equally polluted by such an act.  But as it was      impossible to cause the dead bodies to vanish, Dakhmas or burying-      places were laid out, which had to be covered with pavement and      cement not less than four inches thick, and surrounded by cords to      denote that the whole structure was as it were suspended in the air,      and did not come in contact with the pure earth.  Spiegel, Avesta      II.]  \"The tailor's indignation at hearing this was even greater than his astonishment, and pointing to the landing-steps, he cried:  \"It is really too bad; see, there is the sixth boat full of these foreigners!\"  \"Yes, it is hard indeed!\"  sighed the priest, \"one might fancy a whole army arriving.  Amasis will go on in this manner until the strangers drive him from his throne and country,"]]]
