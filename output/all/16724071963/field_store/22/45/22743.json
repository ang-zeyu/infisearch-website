Oh! impossible!  Where are your horses standing?\"  In this instant she had forgotten Klea, the duty which called her back to the temple, even her parents, and she followed the Corinthian with winged steps, sprang into the two-wheeled chariot, and clung fast to the breastwork, as Lysias took his place by her side, seized the reins, and with a strong and practised hand curbed the mettle of his spirited steeds.  She stood perfectly guileless and undoubting by his side, and wholly at his mercy as the chariot rattled off; but, unknown to herself, beneficent powers were shielding her with buckler and armor--her childlike innocence, and that memory of her parents which her tempter himself had revived in her mind, and which soon came back in vivid strength.  Breathing deep with excitement, and filled with such rapture as a bird may feel when it first soars from its narrow nest high up into the ether she cried out again and again:  \"Oh, this is delightful! this is splendid!\" and then:  \"How we rush through the air as if we were swallows!  Faster, Lysias, faster!  No, no--that is too fast; wait a little that I may not fall! Oh, I am not frightened; it is too delightful to cut through the air just as a Nile boat cuts through the stream in a storm, and to feel it on my face and neck.\"  Lysias was very close to her; when, at her desire, he urged his horses to their utmost pace, and saw her sway, he involuntarily put out his hand to hold her by the girdle; but Irene avoided his grasp, pressing close against the side of the chariot next her, and every time he touched her she drew her arm close up to her body, shrinking together like the fragile leaf of a sensitive plant when it is touched by some foreign object.  She now begged the Corinthian to allow her to hold the reins for a little while, and he immediately acceded to her request, giving them into her hand, though, stepping behind her, he carefully kept the ends of them in his own.  He could now see her shining hair, the graceful oval of her head, and her white throat eagerly bent forward; an indescribable longing came over him to press a kiss on her head; but he forbore, for he remembered his friend's words that he would fulfil the part of a guardian to these girls.  He too would be a protector to her, aye and more than that, he would care for her as a father might.  Still, as often as the chariot jolted over a stone, and he touched her to support her, the suppressed wish revived, and once when her hair was blown quite close to his lips he did indeed kiss it--but only as a friend or a brother might. Still, she must have felt the breath from his lips, for she turned round hastily, and gave him back the reins; then, pressing her hand to her brow, she said in a quite altered voice--not unmixed with a faint tone of regret:  \"This is not right--please now to turn the horses round.\"  Lysias, instead of obeying her, pulled at the reins to urge the horses to a swifter pace, and before he could find a suitable answer, she had glanced up at the sun, and pointing to the east she exclaimed:  \"How late it is already!  what shall I say if I have been looked for, and they ask me where I have been so long?  Why don't you turn round--nor ask me anything about my parents?\"  The last words broke from her with vehemence, and as Lysias did not immediately reply nor make any attempt to check the pace of the horses, she herself seized the reins exclaiming:  \"Will you turn round or no?\"  \"No!\" said the Greek with decision.  \"But--\"  \"And this is what you intended!\" shrieked the girl, beside herself. \"You meant to carry me off by stratagem--but wait, only wait--\"  And before Lysias could prevent her she had turned round, and was preparing to spring from the chariot as it rushed onwards; but her companion was quicker than she; he clutched first at her robe and then her girdle, put his arm round her waist, and in spite of her resistance pulled her back into the chariot.  Trembling, stamping her little feet and with tears in her eyes, she strove to free her girdle from his grasp; he, now bringing his horses to a stand-still, said kindly but earnestly:  \"What I have done is the best that could happen to you, and I will even turn the horses back again if you command it, but not till you have heard me; for when I got you into the chariot by stratagem it was because I was afraid that you would refuse to accompany me, and yet I knew that every delay would expose you to the most hideous peril.  I did not indeed take a base advantage of your father's name, for my friend Publius Scipio, who is very influential, intends to do everything in his power to procure his freedom and to reunite you to him.  But, Irene, that could never have happened if I had left you where you have hitherto lived.\"  During this discourse the girl had looked at Lysias in bewilderment, and she interrupted him with the exclamation:  \"But I have never done any one an injury!  Who can gain any benefit by persecuting a poor creature like me:  \"Your father was the most righteous of men,\" replied Lysias, \"and nevertheless he was carried off into torments like a criminal.  It is not only the unrighteous and the wicked that are persecuted.  Have you ever heard of King Euergetes, who, at his birth, was named the 'well-doer,' and who has earned that of the 'evil doer' by his crimes?  He has heard that you are fair, and he is about to demand of the high-priest that he should surrender you to him.  If Asclepiodorus agrees--and what can he do against the might of a king--you will be made the companion of flute- playing girls and painted women, who riot with drunken men at his wild carousals and orgies, and if your parents found you thus, better would it be for them--\"  \"Is it true, all  you are  telling me?\"  asked Irene with flaming cheeks.  \"Yes,\" answered Lysias firmly.  \"Listen Irene--I have a father and a dear mother and a sister, who is like you, and I swear to you by their heads-- by those whose names never passed my lips in the presence of any other woman I ever sued to--that I am speaking the simple truth; that I seek nothing but only to save you; that if you desire it, as soon as I have hidden you I will never see you again, terribly hard as that would be to me--for I love you so dearly, so deeply--poor sweet little Irene--as you can never imagine.\"  Lysias took the girl's hand, but she withdrew it hastily, and raising her eyes, full of tears, to meet his she said clearly and firmly:  \"I believe you, for no man could speak like that and betray another. But how do you know all this?  Where are you taking me?  Will Klea follow me?\"  \"At first you shall be concealed with the family of a worthy sculptor. We will let Klea know this very day of all that has happened to you, and when we have obtained the release of your parents then--but--Help us, protecting Zeus!  Do you see the chariot yonder?  I believe those are the white horses of the Eunuch Eulaeus, and if he were to see us here, all would be lost!  Hold tight, we must go as fast as in a chariot race. There, now the hill hides us, and down there, by the little temple of Isis, the wife of your future host is already waiting for you; she is no doubt sitting in the closed chariot near the palm-trees.  \"Yes, certainly, certainly, Klea shall hear all, so that she may not be uneasy about you!  I must say farewell to you directly and then, afterwards, sweet Irene, will you sometimes think of the unhappy Lysias; or did Aurora, who greeted him this morning, so bright and full of happy promise, usher in a day not of joy but of sorrow and regret?\"  The Greek drew in rein as he spoke, bringing his horses to a sober pace, and looked tenderly in Irene's eyes.  She returned his gaze with heart-felt emotion, but her gunny glance was dimmed with tears.  \"Say something,\" entreated the Greek.  \"Will you not forget me?  And may I soon visit you in your new retreat?\"  Irene would so gladly have said yes--and yes again, a thousand times yes; and yet she, who was so easily carried away by every little emotion of her heart, in this supreme moment found strength enough to snatch her hand from that of the Greek, who had again taken it, and to answer firmly:  \"I will remember you for ever and ever, but you must not come to see me till I am once more united to my Klea.\"  \"But Irene, consider, if now--\" cried Lysias much agitated.  \"You swore to me by the heads of your nearest kin to obey my wishes,\" interrupted the girl.  \"Certainly I trust you, and all the more readily because you are so good to me, but I shall not do so any more if you do not keep your word.  Look, here comes a lady to meet us who looks like a friend.  She is already waving her hand to me.  Yes, I will go with her gladly, and yet I am so anxious--so troubled, I cannot tell you--but I am so thankful too!  Think of me sometimes, Lysias, and of our journey here, and of our talk, and of my parents:  I entreat you, do for them all you possibly can.  I wish I could help crying--but I cannot!\"     CHAPTER XV.  Lysias eyes had not deceived him.  The chariot with white horses which he had evaded during his flight with Irene belonged to Eulaeus.  The morning being cool--and also because Cleopatra's lady-in-waiting was with him--he had come out in a closed chariot, in which he sat on soft cushions side by side with the Macedonian lady, endeavoring to win her good graces by a conversation, witty enough in its way.  \"On the way there,\" thought he, \"I will make her quite favorable to me, and on the way back I will talk to her of my own affairs.\"  The drive passed quickly and pleasantly for both, and they neither of them paid any heed to the sound of the hoofs of the horses that were bearing away Irene.  Eulaeus dismounted behind the acacia-grove, and expressed a hope that Zoe would not find the time very long while"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5463"],["title","The Sisters â€” Volume 3 (#7)"],["body"," was engaged with the high- priest; perhaps indeed, he remarked, she might even make some use of the time by making advances to the representative of Hebe.  But Irene had been long since warmly welcomed in the house of Apollodorus, the sculptor, by the time they once more found themselves together in the chariot; Eulaeus feigning, and Zoe in reality feeling, extreme dissatisfaction at all that had taken place in the temple. The high-priest had rejected Philometor's demand that he should send the water-bearer to the palace on King Euergetes' birthday, with a decisiveness which Eulaeus would never have given him credit for, for he had on former occasions shown a disposition to measures of compromise; while Zoe had not even seen the waterbearer.  \"I fancy,\" said the queen's shrewd friend, \"that I followed you somewhat too late, and that when I entered the temple about half an hour after you--having been detained first by Imhotep, the old physician, and then by an assistant of Apollodorus, the sculptor, with some new busts of the philosophers--the high-priest had already given orders that the girl should be kept concealed; for when I asked to see her, I was conducted first to her miserable room, which seemed more fit for peasants or goats than for a Hebe, even for a sham one--but I found it perfectly deserted.  \"Then I was shown into the temple of Serapis, where a priest was instructing some girls in singing, and then sent hither and thither, till at last, finding no trace whatever of the famous Irene, I came to the dwelling-house of the gate-keeper of the temple.  \"An ungainly woman opened the door, and said that Irene had been gone from thence for some long time, but that her elder sister was there, so I desired she might be fetched to speak with me.  And what, if you please, was the answer I received?  The goddess Klea--I call her so as being sister to a Hebe--had to nurse a sick child, and if I wanted to see her I might go in and find her.  \"The tone of the message quite conveyed that the distance from her down to me was as great as in fact it is the other way.  However, I thought it worth the trouble to see this supercilious water-bearing girl, and I went into a low room--it makes me sick now to remember how it smelt of poverty--and there she sat with an idiotic child, dying on her lap. Everything that surrounded me was so revolting and dismal that it will haunt my dreams with terror for weeks to come and spoil all my cheerful hours.  \"I did not remain long with these wretched creatures, but I must confess that if Irene is as like to Hebe as her elder sister is to Hera, Euergetes has good grounds for being angry if Asclepiodorus keeps the girl from him.  \"Many a queen--and not least the one whom you and I know so intimately- would willingly give half of her kingdom to possess such a figure and such a mien as this serving-girl.  And then her eyes, as she looked at me when she rose with that little gasping corpse in her arms, and asked me what I wanted with her sister!  \"There was an impressive and lurid glow in those solemn eyes, which looked as if they had been taken out of some Medusa's head to be set in her beautiful face.  And there was a sinister threat in them too which seemed to say: 'Require nothing of her that I do not approve of, or you will be turned into stone on the spot.'  She did not answer twenty words to my questions, and when I once more tasted the fresh air outside, which never seemed to me so pleasant as by contrast with that horrible hole, I had learnt no more than that no one knew--or chose to know--in what corner the fair Irene was hidden, and that I should do well to make no further enquiries.  \"And now, what will Philometor do?  What will you advise him to do?\"  \"What cannot be got at by soft words may sometimes be obtained by a sufficiently large present,\" replied Eulaeus.  \"You know very well that of all words none is less familiar to these gentry than the little word 'enough'; but who indeed is really ready to say it?  \"You speak of the haughtiness and the stern repellent demeanor of our Hebe's sister.  I have seen her too, and I think that her image might be set up in the Stoa as a happy impersonation of the severest virtue: and yet children generally resemble their parents, and her father was the veriest peculator and the most cunning rascal that ever came in my way, and was sent off to the gold-mines for very sufficient reasons.  And for the sake of the daughter of a convicted criminal you have been driven through the dust and the scorching heat, and have had to submit to her scorn and contemptuous airs, while I am threatened with grave peril on her account, for you know that Cleopatra's latest whim is to do honor to the Roman, Publius Scipio; he, on the other hand, is running after our Hebe, and, having promised her that he will obtain an unqualified pardon for her father, he will do his utmost to throw the odium of his robbery upon me.  \"The queen is to give him audience this very day, and you cannot know how many enemies a man makes who, like me, has for many years been one of the leading men of a great state.  The king acknowledges, and with gratitude, all that I have done for him and for his mother; but if, at the moment when Publius Scipio accuses me, he is more in favor with her than ever, I am a lost man.  \"You are always with the queen; do you tell her who these girls are, and what motives the Roman has for loading me with their father's crimes; and some opportunity must offer for doing you and your belongings some friendly office or another.\"  \"What a shameless crew!\"  exclaimed Zoe.  \"Depend upon it I will not be silent, for I always do what is just.  I cannot bear seeing others suffering an injustice, and least of all that a man of your merit and distinction should be wounded in his honor, because a haughty foreigner takes a fancy to a pretty little face and a conceited doll of a girl.\"  Zoe was in the right when she found the air stifling in the gate-keeper's house, for poor Irene, unaccustomed to such an atmosphere, could no more endure it than the pretentious maid of honor.  It cost even Klea an effort to remain in the wretched room, which served as the dwelling-place of the whole family; where the cooking was carried on at a smoky hearth, while, at night, it also sheltered a goat and a few fowls; but she had endured even severer trials than this for the sake of what she deemed right, and she was so fond of little Philo--her anxious care in arousing by degrees his slumbering intelligence had brought her so much soothing satisfaction, and the child's innocent gratitude had been so tender a reward--that she wholly forgot the repulsive surroundings as soon as she felt that her presence and care were indispensable to the suffering little one.  Imhotep, the most famous of the priest-physicians of the temple of Asclepius--a man who was as learned in Greek as in Egyptian medical lore, and who had been known by the name of \"the modern Herophilus\" since King Philometor had summoned him from Alexandria to Memphis--had long since been watchful of the gradual development of the dormant intelligence of the gate-keeper's child, whom he saw every day in his visits to the temple.  Now, not long after Zoe had quitted the house, he came in to see the sick child for the third time.  Klea was still holding the boy on her lap when he entered.  On a wooden stool in front of her stood a brazier of charcoal, and on it a small copper kettle the physician had brought with him; to this a long tube was attached.  The tube was in two parts, joined together by a leather joint, also tubular, in such a way that the upper portion could be turned in any direction.  Klea from time to time applied it to the breast of the child, and, in obedience to Imhotep's instructions, made the little one inhale the steam that poured out of it.  \"Has it had the soothing effect it ought to have?\"  asked the physician.  \"Yes, indeed, I think so,\" replied Klea,  \"There is not so much noise in the chest when the poor little fellow draws his breath.\"  The old man put his ear to the child's mouth, laid his hand on his brow, and said:  \"If the fever abates I hope for the best.  This inhaling of steam is an excellent remedy for these severe catarrhs, and a venerable one besides; for in the oldest writings of Hermes we find it prescribed as an application in such cases.  But now he has had enough of it.  \"Ah! this steam--this steam!  Do you know that it is stronger than horses or oxen, or the united strength of a whole army of giants?  That diligent enquirer Hero of Alexandria discovered this lately.  \"But our little invalid has had enough of it, we must not overheat him. Now, take a linen cloth--that one will do though it is not very fine. Fold it together, wet it nicely with cold water--there is some in that miserable potsherd there--and now I will show you how to lay it on the child's throat.  \"You need not assure me that you understand me, Klea, for you have hands --neat hands--and patience without end!  Sixty-five years have I lived, and have always had good health, but I could almost wish to be ill for once, in order to be nursed by you.  That poor child is well off better than many a king's child when it is sick; for him hireling nurses, no doubt, fetch and do all that is necessary, but one thing they cannot give, for they have it not; I mean the loving and indefatigable patience by which you have worked a miracle on this child's mind, and are now working another on his body.  Aye, aye, my girl; it is to you and not me that this woman will owe her child if it is preserved to her.  Do you hear me, woman? and tell your husband so too; and if you do not reverence Klea as a goddess, and do not lay your hands beneath her feet, may you be--no--I will wish you no ill, for you have not too much of the good things of life as it is!\"  As he spoke the gate-keeper's wife came timidly up to the physician and the sick child,"]]]
