The architect, who usually devoted his whole attention to the single object that claimed his notice, now permitted himself the pleasure of enjoying the entire picture in whose finishing touches he had himself borne a part; and, as his practised eye perceived in every temple and colonnade the studied and finished harmony of form, and the admirable grouping of the various buildings and statues, he said to himself, with a sigh of satisfaction, that his own art was the noblest and building the highest of royal pleasures.  No doubt this belief was shared by the princes who, three centuries before, had endeavoured to obtain an environment for their palaces which should correspond with their vast power and overflowing wealth, and at the same time give tangible expression to their reverence for the gods and their delight in art and beauty.  No royal race in the universe could boast of a more magnificent abode.  These thoughts passed through Gorgias's mind as the deep azure hue of sea and sky blended with the sunlight to bring into the strongest relief all that the skill and brains of man, aided by exhaustless resources, had here created.  Waiting, usually a hard task for the busy architect, became a pleasure in this spot; for the rays streaming lavishly in all directions from the diadem of the sovereign sun flooded with dazzling radiance the thousands of white marble statues on the temples and colonnades, and were reflected from the surfaces of the polished granite of the obelisks and the equally smooth walls of the white, yellow, and green marble, the syenite, and the brown, speckled porphyry of sanctuaries and palaces.  They seemed to be striving to melt the bright mosaic pictures which covered every foot Of the ground, where no highway intersected and no tree shaded it, and flashed back again from the glimmering metal or the smooth glaze in the gay tiles on the roofs of the temples and houses.  Here they glittered on the metal ornaments, yonder they seemed to be trying to rival the brilliancy of the gilded domes, to lend to the superb green of the tarnished bronze surfaces the sparkling lustre of the emerald, or to transform the blue and red lines of the white marble temples into lapis- lazuli and coral and their gilded decorations into topaz.  The pictures in the mosaic pavement of the squares, and on the inner walls of the colonnades, were doubly effective against the light masses of marble surrounding them, which in their turn were indebted to the pictures for affording the eye an attractive variety instead of dazzling monotony.  Here the light of the weltering sun enhanced the brilliancy of colour in the flags and streamers which fluttered beside the obelisks and Egyptian pylons, over the triumphal arches and the gates of the temples and palaces.  Yet even the exquisite purplish blue of the banner waving above the palace on the peninsula of Lochias, now occupied by Cleopatra's children, was surpassed by the hue of the sea, whose deep azure near the shore merged far away into bands of lighter and darker blue, blending with dull or whitish green.  Gorgias was accustomed to grasp fully whatever he permitted to influence him, and though still loyal to his custom of associating with his art every remarkable work of the gods or man, he had not forgotten in his enjoyment of the familiar scene the purpose of his presence in this spot.  No, the garden of Didymus was not the proper place for his friend's last work.  While gazing at the lofty plane, sycamore, and mimosa trees which surrounded the old scholar's home, the quiet square below him suddenly became astir with noisy life, for all classes of the populace were gathering in front of the sequestered house, as if some unusual spectacle attracted them.  What could they want of the secluded philosopher?  Gorgias gazed earnestly at them, but soon turned away again; a gay voice from below called his name.  A singular procession had approached the temple--a small body of armed men, led by a short, stout fellow, whose big head, covered with bushy curls, was crowned with a laurel wreath.  He was talking eagerly to a younger man, but had paused with the others in front of the sanctuary to greet the architect.  The latter shouted a few pleasant words in reply. The laurel-crowned figure made a movement as if he intended to join him, but his companion checked him, and, after a short parley, the older man gave the younger one his hand, flung his heavy head back, and strutted onward like a peacock, followed by his whole train.  The other looked after him, shrugging his shoulders; then called to Gorgias, asking what boon he desired from the goddess.  \"Your presence,\" replied the architect blithely.  \"Then Isis will show herself gracious to you,\" was the answer, and the next instant the two young men cordially grasped each other's hands.  Both were equally tall and well formed; the features bore witness to their Greek origin; nay, they might have been taken for brothers, had not the architect's whole appearance seemed sturdie and plainer than that of his companion, whom he called \"Dion\" and friend.  As the latter heaped merry sarcasms upon the figure wearing the laurel wreath who had just left him, Anaxenor, the famous zither-player, on whom Antony had bestowed the revenues of four cities and permission to keep body-guard, and Gorgias's deeper voice sometime assented, sometimes opposed with sensible objections, the difference between these two men of the same age and race became clearly apparent.  Both showed a degree of self-reliance unusual, at their age; but the architect's was the assurance which a man gains by toil and his own merit, Dion's that which is bestowed by large possession and a high position in society.  Those who were ignorant that the weight of Dion's carefully prepared speech had more than once turned the scale in the city councils would probably have been disposed to take him for one of the careless worldlings who had no lack of representatives among the gilded youth of Alexandria; while the architect's whole exterior, from his keen eye to the stouter leather of his sandals, revealed earnest purpose and unassuming ability.  Their friendship had commenced when Gorgias built a new palace for Dion. During long business association people become well acquainted, even though their conversations relate solely to direction and execution. But in this case, he who gave the orders had been only the inspirer and adviser, the architect the warm-hearted friend, eager to do his utmost to realize what hovered before the other's mind as the highest attainable excellence.  So the two young men became first dear, and finally almost indispensable to each other.  As the architect discovered in the wealthy man of the world many qualities whose existence he had not suspected, the latter was agreeably surprised to find in the artist, associated with his solidity of character, a jovial companion, who--this first made him really beloved by his friend--had no lack of weaknesses.  When the palace was completed to Dion's satisfaction and became one of the most lauded ornaments of the city, the young men's friendship assumed a new form, and it would have been difficult to say which received the most benefit.  Dion had just been stopped by the zither-player to ask for confirmation of the tidings that the united forces of Antony and Cleopatra had gained a great victory on sea and land.  In the eating-house at Kanopus, where he had breakfasted, everyone was full of the joyful news, and rivers of wine had been drunk to the health of the victors and the destruction of the malicious foe.  \"In these days,\" cried Dion, \"not only weak-brained fellows, like the zither- player, believe me omniscient, but many sensible men also.  And why? Because, forsooth, I am the nephew of Zeno, the Keeper of the Seal, who is on the brink of despair because he himself knows nothing, not even the veriest trifle.\"  \"Yet he stands nearest to the Regent,\" observed Gorgias, \"and must learn, if any one does, how the fleet fares.\"  \"You too!\" sighed his friend.  \"Had I been standing so far above the ground as you, the architect--by the dog, I should not have failed to note the quarter whence the wind blew!  It has been southerly a whole fortnight, and keeps back the galleys coming from the north.  The Regent knows nothing, absolutely nothing, and my uncle, of course, no more.  But if they do learn anything they will be shrewd enough not to enrich me with it.\"  \"True, there are other rumours afloat,\" said the architect thoughtfully. \"If I were in Mardion's place--\"  \"Thank the Olympians that you are not,\" laughed his companion.  \"He has as many cares as a fish has scales.  And one, the greatest.  That pert young Antyllus was over-ready with his tongue yesterday at Barine's. Poor fellow!  He'll have to answer for it to his tutor at home.\"  \"You mean the remark about the Queen's accompanying the fleet?\"  \"St!\" said Dion, putting his finger on his lips, for many men and women were now ascending the temple steps.  Several carried flowers and cakes, and the features of most expressed joyful emotion.  The news of the victory had reached their ears, and they wanted to offer sacrifices to the goddess whom Cleopatra, \"the new Isis,\" preferred to all others.  The first court-yard of the sanctuary was astir with life.  They could hear the ringing of the sistrum bells and the murmuring chant of the priests.  The quiet fore-court of the little temple of the goddess, which here, in the Greek quarter of palaces, had as few visitors as the great Temple of Isis in the Rhakotis was overcrowded, had now become the worst"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5473"],["title","Cleopatra â€” Volume 01 (#2)"],["body","rendezvous for men who stood so near the rulers of the government.  The remark made about the Queen the evening before by Antyllus, Antony's nineteen-year-old son, at the house of Barine, a beautiful young woman who attracted all the prominent men in Alexandria, was the more imprudent because it coincided with the opinion of all the wisest heads.  The reckless youth enthusiastically reverenced his father, but Cleopatra, the object of Antony's love, and--in the Egyptians' eyes-- his wife, was not Antyllus's mother.  He was the son of Fulvia, his father's first wife, and feeling himself a Roman, would have preferred a thousand times to live on the banks of the Tiber.  Besides, it was certain--Antony's stanchest friends made no attempt to conceal the fact-- that the Queen's presence with the army exerted a disturbing influence, and could not fail to curb the daring courage of the brave general. Antyllus, with the reckless frankness inherited from his father, had expressed this view in the presence of all Barine's guests, and in a form which would be only too quickly spread throughout Alexandria, whose inhabitants relished such speeches.  These remarks would be slow in reaching the plain people who were attracted to the temple by the news of the victory, yet many doubtless knew Caesarion, whom the architect was awaiting here.  It would be wiser to meet the prince at the foot of the steps.  Both men, therefore, went down to the square, though the crowds seeking the temple and thronging the space before Didymus's house made it more and more difficult to pace to and fro.  They were anxious to learn whether the rumour that Didymus's garden was to be taken for the twin statues had already spread abroad, and their first questions revealed that this was the case.  It was even stated that the old sage's house was to be torn down, and within a few hours.  This was vehemently contradicted; but a tall, scrawny man seemed to have undertaken to defend the ruler's violence.  The friends knew him well.  It was the Syrian Philostratus, a clever extempore speaker and agitator of the people, who placed his clever tongue at the disposal of the highest bidder.  \"The rascal is probably now in my uncle's employ,\" said Dion.  \"The idea of putting the piece of sculpture there originated with him, and it is difficult to turn him from such plans.  There is some secret object to be gained here.  That is why they have brought Philostratus.  I wonder if the conspiracy is connected in any way with Barine, whose husband-- unfortunately for her--he was before he cast her off.\"  \"Cast her off!\" exclaimed Gorgias wrathfully.  \"How that sounds!  True, he did it, but to persuade him the poor woman sacrificed half the fortune her father had earned by his brush.  You know as well as I that life with that scoundrel would be unbearable.\"  \"Very true,\" replied Dion quietly.  \"But as all Alexandria melted into admiration after her singing of the 'yalemos' at the Adonis festival, she no longer needed her contemptible consort.\"  \"How can you take pleasure, whenever it is possible, in casting such slurs upon a woman, whom but yesterday you called blameless, charming, peerless?\"  \"That the light she sheds may not dazzle your eyes.  I know how sensitive they are.\"  \"Then spare, instead of irritating them.  Besides, your suggestion gives food for thought Barine is the granddaughter of the man whose garden they want, and the advocate would probably be glad to injure both.  But I'll spoil his game.  It is my business to choose the site for the statues.\"  \"Yours?\" replied Dion.  \"Unless some on who is more powerful opposes you. I would try to win my uncle, but there are others superior to him.  The Queen has gone, it is true; but Iras, whose commands do not die away in empty air, told me this morning that she had her own ideas about the errection of the statue.\"  \"Then you bring Philostratus here!\" cried the architect.  \"I?\" asked the other in amazement.  \"Ay, you,\" asserted Gorgias.  \"Did not you say that Iras, with whom you played when a boy is now becoming troublesome by watching your every step?  And then--you visit Barine constantly and she so evidently prefers you, that the fact might easily reach the ears of Iras.\"  \"As Argus has a hundred, jealousy has a thousand eyes,\" interrupted Dion, \"yet I seek nothing from Barine, save two pleasant hours when the day is drawing towards its close.  No matter; Iras, I suppose, heard that I was favoured by this much-admired woman.  Iras herself has some little regard for me, so she bought Philostratus.  She is willing to pay something for the sake of injuring the woman who stands between us, or the old man who has the good or evil fortune of being her rival's grandfather.  No, no; that would be too base!  And believe me, if Iras desired to ruin Barine, she need not make so long a circuit.  Besides, she is not really a wicked woman.  Or is she?  All I know is that where any advantage is to be gained for the Queen, she does not shrink even from doubtful means, and also that the hours speed swiftly for any one in her society.  Yes, Iras, Iras--I like to utter the name.  Yet I do not love her, and she--loves only herself, and--a thing few can say--another still more.  What is the world, what am I to her, compared with the Queen, the idol of her heart? Since Cleopatra's departure, Iras seems like the forsaken Ariadne, or a young roe which has strayed from its mother.  But stop; she may have a hand in the game: the Queen trusted her as if she were her sister, her daughter.  No one knows what she and Charmian are to her.  They are called waiting-women, but are their sovereign's dearest friends.  When, on the departure of the fleet, Cleopatra was compelled to leave Iras here--she was ill with a fever--she gave her the charge of her children, even those whose beards were beginning to grow, the 'King of kings' Caesarion, whose tutor punishes him for every act of disobedience; and the unruly lad Antyllus, who has forced his way the last few evenings into our friend's house.\"  \"Antony, his own father, introduced him to her.\"  \"Very true, and Antyllus took Caesarion there.  This vexed Iras, like everything which may disturb the Queen.  Barine is troublesome on account of Cleopatra, whom she wishes to spare every, annoyance, and perhaps she dislikes her a little for my sake.  Now she wants to inflict on the old man, Barine's grandfather, whom she loves, some injury which the spoiled, imprudent woman will scarcely accept quietly, and which will rouse her to commit some folly that can be used against her.  Iras will hardly seek her life, but she may have in mind exile or something of that kind.  She knows people as well as I know her, my neighbour and playmate, whom many a time I was obliged to lift down from some tree into which the child had climbed as nimbly as a kitten.\"  \"I myself suggested this conjecture, yet I cannot credit her with such unworthy intrigues,\" cried Gorgias.  \"Credit her?\" repeated Dion, shrugging his shoulders.  \"I only transport myself in imagination to the court and to the soul of the woman who helps make rain and sunshine there.  You have columns rounded and beams hewed that they may afterwards support the roof to which in due time you wish to direct attention.  She and all who have a voice in the management of court affairs look first at the roof and then seek anything to raise and support it, though it should be corpses, ruined lives, and broken hearts. The point is that the roof shall stand until the architect, the Queen, sees and approves it.  As to the rest--But there is the carriage--It doubtless brings--You were--\"  He paused, laid his hand on his friend's arm, and whispered hastily: \"Iras is undoubtedly at the bottom of this, and it is not Antyllus, but yonder dreaming lad, for whom she is moving.  When she spoke of the statues just now, she asked in the same breath where I had seen him on the evening of the day before yesterday, and that was the very time he called on Barine.  The plot was made by her, and Iras is doing all the work.  The mouse is not caught while the trap is closed, and she is just raising her little hand to open it.\"  \"If only she does not use some man's hand,\" replied the architect wrathfully, and then turned towards the carriage and the elderly man who had just left it, and was now approaching the two friends.     CHAPTER II.  When Caesarion's companion reached Dion and Gorgias, the former modestly made a movement to retire.  But Archibius was acquainted with both, and begged him to remain.  There was an air of precision and clearness in the voice and quiet movements of this big, broad-shouldered man, with his robust frame and well-developed limbs.  Though only a few years beyond forty, not merely his grey hair but the calm, impressive dignity of his whole manner indicated a more advanced age.  \"The young King yonder,\" he began in a deep, musical voice, motioning towards the equipage, \"wished to speak to you here in person, Gorgias, but by my advice he refrained from mingling with the crowd.  I have brought him hither in a closed carriage.  If the plan suits you, enter it and talk with him while I keep watch here.  Strange things seem to be occurring, and yonder--or am I mistaken?  Has the monster dragged along there any connection with the twin statues of the Queen and her friend? Was it you who selected that place for them?\"  \"No,\" replied the architect.  \"The order was issued over my head and against my will.\"  \"I thought so,\" replied the other.  \"This is the very matter of which Caesarion wishes to speak.  If you can prevent the erection of the statues on Didymus's land, so much the better.  I will do everything in my power to aid you, but in the Queen's absence that is little.\"  \"Then what can be said of my influence?\"  asked the architect.  \"Who, in these days, knows whether the sky will be blue or grey to-morrow?  I can guarantee one thing only: I will do my best to"]]]
