D.W.]      CLEOPATRA  By Georg Ebers  Volume 6.   CHAPTER XIII.  During these hours of rest Iras and Charmian had watched in turn beside Cleopatra.  When she rose, the younger attendant rendered her the necessary services.  She was to devote herself to her mistress until the evening; for her companion, who now stood in her way, was not to return earlier.  Before Charmian left, she had seen that her apartments--in which Barine, since the Queen had placed her in her charge, had been a welcome guest--were carefully watched.  The commander of the Macedonian guard, who years before had vainly sought her favour, and finally had become the most loyal of her friends, had promised to keep them closely.  Yet Iras knew how to profit by her mistress's sleep and the absence of her aunt.  She had learned that she would be shut out of her apartments, and therefore from Barine also.  Ere any step could be taken against the prisoner, she must first arrange the necessary preliminaries with Alexas. The failure of her expectation of seeing her rival trampled in the dust had transformed her jealous resentment into hatred, and though she was her niece, she even transferred a portion of it to Charmian, who had placed herself between her and her victim.  She had sent for the Syrian, but he, too, had gone to rest at a late hour and kept her waiting a long time.  The reception which the impatient girl bestowed was therefore by no means cordial, but her manner soon grew more friendly.  First Alexas boasted of having induced the Queen to commit Barine's fate to him.  If he should try her at noon and find her guilty, there was nothing to prevent him from compelling her to drink the poisoned cup or having her strangled before evening.  But the matter would be dangerous, because the singer's friends were numerous and by no means powerless. Yet, in the depths of her heart, Cleopatra desired nothing more ardently than to rid herself of her dangerous rival.  But he knew the great ones of the earth.  If he acted energetically and brought matters to a speedy close, the Queen, to avoid evil gossip, would burden him with her own act.  Antony's mood could not be predicted, and the Syrian's weal or woe depended on his favour.  Besides, the execution of the singer at the last Adonis festival might have a dangerous effect upon the people of Alexandria.  They were already greatly excited, and his brother, who knew them, said that some were overwhelmed with sorrow, and others ready, in their fury, to rise in a bloody rebellion.  Everything was to be feared from this rabble, but Philostratus understood how to persuade them to many things, and Alexas had just secured his aid.  Alexas had really succeeded in the work of reconciliation.  During the orator's married life with Barine she had forbidden her brother-in-law the house, and her husband had quarrelled with the brother who sought his wife.  But after the latter had risen to a high place in Antony's favour, and been loaded with gold by his lavish hand, Philostratus had again approached him to claim his share of the new wealth.  And the source from which Alexas drew flowed so abundantly that his favourite did not find it difficult to give.  Both men were as unprincipled as they were lavish, and experience taught them that base natures always have at their disposal a plank with which to bridge chasms.  If it is of gold, it will be crossed the more speedily.  Such was the case here, and of late it had become specially firm; for each needed the other's aid.  Alexas loved Barine, while Philostratus no longer cared for her.  On the other hand, he hated Dion with so ardent a thirst for revenge that, to obtain it, he would have resigned even the hope of fresh gains.  The humiliation inflicted upon him by the arrogant Macedonian noble, and the derision which through his efforts had been heaped upon him, haunted him like importunate pursuers; and he felt that he could only rid himself of them with the source of his disgrace.  Without his brother's aid, he would have been content to assail Dion with his slandering tongue; with his powerful assistance he could inflict a heavier injury upon him, perhaps even rob him of liberty and life.  They had just made an agreement by which Philostratus pledged himself to reconcile the populace to any punishment that might be inflicted upon Barine, and Alexas promised to help his brother take a bloody vengeance upon Dion the Macedonian.  Barine's death could be of no service to Alexas.  The sight of her beauty had fired his heart a second time, and he was resolved to make her his own.  In the dungeon, perhaps by torture, she should be forced to grasp his helping hand.  All this would permit no delay.  Everything must be done before the return of Antony, who was daily expected.  Alexas's lavish patron had made him so rich that he could bear to lose his favour for the sake of this object.  Even without it, he could maintain a household with royal magnificence in some city of his Syrian home.  On receiving the favourite's assurance that he would remove Barine from Charmian's protection on the morrow, Iras became more gracious.  She could make no serious objection to his statement that the new trial might not, it is true, end in a sentence of death, but the verdict would probably be transportation to the mines, or something of the sort.  Then Alexas cautiously tested Iras's feelings towards his brother's mortal foe.  They were hostile; yet when the favourite intimated that he, too, ought to be given up to justice, she showed so much hesitation, that Alexas stopped abruptly and turned the conversation upon Barine.  Here she promised assistance with her former eager zeal, and it was settled that the arrest should be made the following morning during the hours of Charmian's attendance upon the Queen.  Iras had valuable counsel to offer.  She was familiar with one of the prisons, whose doors she had opened to many a hapless mortal whose disappearance, in her opinion, might be of service to the Queen.  She had deemed it a duty, aided by the Keeper of the Seal, to anticipate her mistress in cases where her kind heart would have found it difficult to pronounce a severe sentence, and Cleopatra had permitted it, though without commendation or praise.  What happened within its walls--thanks to the silence of the warder--never passed beyond the portals.  If Barine cursed her life there, she would still fare better than she, Iras, who during the past few nights had been on the brink of despair whenever she thought of the man who had disdained her love and abandoned her for another.  As the Syrian held out his hand to take leave, she asked bluntly  \"And Dion?\"  \"He cannot be set free,\" was the reply, \"for he loves Barine; nay, the fool was on the eve of leading her home to his beautiful palace as its mistress.\"  \"Is that true, really true?\" asked Iras, whose cheeks and lips lost every tinge of colour, though she succeeded in maintaining her composure.  \"He confessed it yesterday in a letter to his uncle, the Keeper of the Seal, in which he entreated him to do his utmost for his chosen bride, whom he would never resign.  But Zeno has no liking for this niece.  Do you wish to see the letter?\"  \"Then, of course, he cannot be set at liberty,\" replied Iras, and there was additional shrillness in her voice.  \"He will do everything in his power for the woman he loves, and that is much--far more than you, who are half a stranger here, suspect.  The Macedonian families stand by each other.  He is a member of the council.  The bands of the Ephebi will support him to a man.  And the populace?--He lately spoiled the game of your brother, who was acting for me, in a way.  He was finally dragged out of the basin of the fountain, dripping with water and overwhelmed with shame.\"  \"For that very reason his mouth must be closed.\"  Iras nodded assent, but after a short pause she exclaimed angrily: \"I will help you to silence him, but not forever.  Do you hear? Theodotus's saying about the dead dogs which do not bite brought no blessing to any one who followed it.  There are other ways of getting rid of this man.\"  \"A bird sang that you were not unfriendly to him.\"  \"A bird?  Then it was probably an owl, which cannot see in the daylight. His worst enemy, your brother, would probably sacrifice himself for his welfare sooner than I.\"  \"Then I shall begin to feel sympathy for this Dion.\"  \"I saw recently that your  compassion  surpassed mine.  Death is not the hardest punishment.\"  \"Is that the cause of this gracious respite?\"  \"Perhaps so.  But there are other matters to be considered here.  First, the condition of the times.  Everything is tottering, even the royal power, which a short time ago was a wall which concealed many things and afforded shelter from every assault.  Then Dion himself.  I have already numbered those who will support him.  Since the defeat at Actium, the Queen can no longer exclaim to that many-headed monster, the people, 'You must,' but 'I entreat.'  The others--\"  \"The first considerations are enough; but may I be permitted to know what my wise friend has awarded to the hapless wight from whom she withdrew her favour?\"  \"First, imprisonment here at Lochias.  He has stained his hands with the blood of Caesarion, the King of kings.  That is high treason, even in the eyes of the people.  Try to obtain the order for the arrest this very day.\"  \"Whenever I can disturb the Queen with such matters.\"  \"Not for nay sake, but to save her from injury.  Away with everything which can cloud her intellect in these decisive days!  First, away with Barine, who spoiled her return home; and then let us take care of the man who would be capable, for this woman's sake, of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5478"],["title","Cleopatra — Volume 06 (#1)"],["body","an insurrection in Alexandria.  The great cares associated with the state and the throne are hers; for the minor ones of the toilet and the heart I will provide.\"  Here she was interrupted by one of Cleopatra's waiting-maids.  The Queen had awakened, and Iras hastened to her post.  As she passed Charmian's apartments and saw two handsome soldiers, belonging to the Macedonian body-guard, pacing to and fro on duty before them, her face darkened.  It was against her alone that Charmian was protecting Barine.  She had been harshly reproved by the older woman on account of the artist's daughter, who had been the source of so many incidents which had caused her pain, and Iras regretted that she had ever confided to her aunt her love for Dion.  But, no matter what might happen, the upas-tree whence emanated all these tortures, anxieties, and vexations, must be rooted out--stricken from the ranks of the living.  Ere she entered the Queen's anteroom she had mentally pronounced sentence of death on her enemy.  Her inventive brain was now busy in devising means to induce the Syrian to undertake its execution.  If this stone of offence was removed it would again be possible to live in harmony with Charmian.  Dion would be free, and then, much as he had wounded her, she would defend him from the hatred of Philostratus and his brother.  She entered the Queen's presence with a lighter heart.  The death of a condemned person had long since ceased to move her deeply.  While rendering the first services to her mistress, who had been much refreshed by her sleep, her face grew brighter and brighter; for Cleopatra voluntarily told her that she was glad to have her attendance, and not be constantly annoyed by the same disagreeable matter, which must soon be settled.  In fact, Charmian, conscious that no one else at court would have ventured to do so, had never grown weary, spite of many a rebuff, of pleading Barine's cause until, the day before, Cleopatra, in a sudden fit of anger, had commanded her not to mention the mischief-maker again.  When Charmian soon after requested permission to let Iras take her place the following day, the Queen already regretted the harsh reproof she had given her friend, and, while cordially granting the desired leave, begged her to attribute her angry impatience to the cares which burdened her. \"And when you show me your kind, faithful face again,\" she concluded, \"you will have remembered that a true friend withholds from an unhappy woman whom she loves whatever will shadow more deeply her already clouded life.  This Barine's very name sounds like a jeer at the composure I maintain with so much difficulty.  I do not wish to hear it again.\"  The words were uttered in a tone so affectionate and winning, that Charmian's vexation melted like ice in the sun.  Yet she left the Queen's presence anxious and troubled; for ere she quitted the room Cleopatra remarked that she had committed the singer's affairs to Alexas.  She was now doubly eager to obtain a day's freedom, for she knew the unprincipled favourite's feelings towards the young beauty, and longed to discuss with Archibius the best means of guarding her from the worst perils.  When at a late hour she went to rest, she was served by the Nubian maid, who had accompanied her to the court from her parents' home.  She came from the Cataract, where she had been bought when the family of Alypius accompanied the child Cleopatra to the island of Philae.  Anukis was given to Charmian, who at the time was just entering womanhood, as the first servant who was her sole property, and she had proved so clever, skilful, apt to learn, and faithful, that her mistress took her, as her personal attendant, to the palace.  Charmian's warm, unselfish love for the Queen was equalled by Anukis's devotion to the mistress who had long since made her free, and had become so strongly attached to her that the Nubian's interests were little less regarded than her own.  Her sound, keen judgment and natural wit had gained a certain renown in the palace, and as Cleopatra often condescended to rouse her to an apt answer, Antony had done so, too; and since the slight crook in the back, which she had from childhood, had grown into a hump, he gave her the name of Aisopion--the female AEsop.  All the Queen's attendants now used it, and though others of lower rank did the same, she permitted it, though her ready wit would have supplied her tongue with a retort sharp enough to respond to any word which displeased her.  But she knew the life and fables of AEsop, who had also once been a slave, and deemed it an honour to be compared with him.  When Charmian had left Cleopatra and sought her chamber, she found Barine sound asleep, but Anukis was awaiting her, and her mistress told her with what deep anxiety for Barine she had quitted the presence of the Queen.  She knew that the Nubian was fond of the young matron, whom in her childhood she had carried in her arms, and whose father, Leonax, had often jested with her.  The maid had watched her career with much interest, and while Barine had been her mistress's guest her efforts to amuse and soothe her were unceasing.  She had gone every morning to Berenike to ask tidings of Dion's health, and always brought favourable news.  Anukis knew Philostratus and his brother, too, and as she liked Antony, who jested with her so kindly, she grieved to see an unprincipled fellow like Alexas his chief confidant. She knew the plots with which the Syrian had persecuted Barine, and when Charmian told her that the Queen had committed the young beauty's fate to this man's keeping her dark face grew fairly livid; but she forced herself to conceal the terror which the news inspired.  Her mistress was also aware what this choice meant to Barine.  But Anukis would have thought it wrong to disturb Charmian's sleep by revealing her own distress.  It was fortunate that she was going early the next morning to seek the aid of Archibius, whom Anukis believed to be the wisest of men; but this by no means soothed her.  She knew the fable of the lion and the mouse, which had been told in her home long before the time of the author for whom she was nicknamed, and already more than once she had been in a position to render far greater and more powerful persons an important service.  To soothe Charmian to sleep and turn her thoughts in another direction, she told her about Dion, whom she had found much better that day, how tenderly he seemed to love Barine, and how touchingly patient and worthy of her father the daughter of Leonax had been.  After her mistress had fallen asleep she went to the hall where, spite of the late hour, she expected to meet some of the servants--sure of being greeted as a welcome guest.  When, a short time later, Alexas's body- slave appeared, she filled his wire cup, sat down by his side, and tried with all the powers at her command to win his confidence.  And so well did the elderly Nubian succeed that Marsyas, a handsome young Ligurian, after she had gone, declared that Aisopion's jokes and stories were enough to bring the dead to life, and it was as pleasant to talk seriously with the brown-skinned monster as to dally with a fair-haired sweetheart.  After Charmian had left the palace the following morning, Anukis again sought Marsyas and learned from him for what purpose and at what hour Iras had summoned Alexas.  His master was continually whispering with the languishing Macedonian.  When Anukis returned, Barine seemed troubled because she brought no tidings from her mother and Dion; but the Nubian entreated her to have patience, and gave her some books and a spindle, that she might have occupation in her solitude.  She, Anukis, must go to the kitchen, because she had heard yesterday that the cook had bought some mushrooms, which might be poisonous; she knew the fungi and wanted to see them.  Then, passing into Charmian's chamber, she glided through the corridor which connected the apartments of Cleopatra's confidential attendants, and slipped into Iras's room.  When Alexas entered she was concealed behind one of the hangings which covered the walls of the reception-room.  After the Syrian had retired and Iras had been called away, Anukis returned to Barine and said that the mushrooms had really been poisonous, and of the deadliest species.  They had been cooked, and she must go out to seek an antidote.  Since a precious human life might be at stake, Barine would not wish to keep her.  \"Go,\" said the latter, kindly.  \"But if you are the old obliging Aisopion, you won't object to going a little farther.\"  \"And inquiring at the house near the Paneum garden,\" added Anukis. \"That was already settled.  Longing is also a poison for a loving heart, and its antidote is good news.\"  With these laughing words she left her favourite; but as soon as she was out of doors her black brow became lined with earnest thought, and she stood pondering a long time.  At last she went to the Bruchium to hire a donkey to ride to Kanopus, where she hoped to find Archibius.  It was difficult to reach the nearest stand; for a great crowd had assembled on the quay between the Lochias and the Corner of the Muses, and groups of the common people, sailors, and slaves were constantly flocking hither. But she at last forced her way to the spot and, while the driver was helping her to mount the animal she had chosen, she asked what had attracted the throng, and he answered:  \"They are tearing down the house of the old Museum fungus, Didymus.\"  \"How can that be?\" cried the startled woman.  \"The good old man!\"  \"Good?\"  repeated the driver, scornfully.  \"He's a traitor, who has caused all the trouble.  Philostratus, the brother of the great Alexas, a friend of Mark Antony, told us so.  He wanted to prove it, so it must be true.  Hear the shouts, and how the stones are flying!  Yes, yes.
