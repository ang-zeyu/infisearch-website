How must this last banquet, which began so mournfully and continued with such reckless mirth, affect her?  At last, the second hour after midnight, Cleopatra appeared.  Charmian believed that she must be the sport of some delusion, for the Queen's eyes which, when she had left her, were full of tears, now sparkled with the radiant light of joy and, as her friend took the crown from her head, she exclaimed:  \"Why did you depart from the banquet so early?  Perhaps it was the last, but I remember no festival more brilliant.  It was like the springtime of my love.  Mark Antony would have touched the heart of a stone statue by that blending of manly daring and humble devotion which no woman can resist.  As in former days, hours shrivelled into moments.  We were again young, once more united.  We were together here at Lochias to-night, and yet in distant years and other places.  The notes of the singers, the melodies of the musicians, the figures executed by the dancers, were lost upon us.  We soared back, hand in hand, to a magic world, and the fairy drama in the realms of the blessed, which passed before us in dazzling splendour and blissful joy, was the dream which I loved best when a child, and at the same time the happiest portion of the life of the Queen of Egypt.  \"It began before the gate of the garden of Epicurus, and continued on the river Cydnus.  I again beheld myself on the golden barge, garlanded with wreaths of flowers, reclining on the purple couch with roses strewn around me and beneath my jewelled sandals.  A gentle breeze swelled the silken sails; my female companions raised their clear voices in song to the accompaniment of lutes; the perfumes floating around us were borne by the wind to the shore, conveying the tidings that the bliss believed by mortals to be reserved for the gods alone was drawing near.  And even as his heart and his enraptured senses yielded to my sway, his mind, as he himself confessed, was under the thrall of mine.  We both felt happy, united by ties which nothing, not even misfortune, could sever.  He, the ruler of the world, was conquered, and delighted to obey the behests of the victor, because he felt that she before whom he bowed was his own obedient slave.  And no magic goblet effected all this.  I breathed more freely, as if relieved from the oppressive delusion--the fire had consumed it also--which had burdened my soul until a few hours ago.  No magic spell, only the gifts of mind and soul which the vanquished victor, the woman Cleopatra, owed to the favour of the immortals, had compelled his lofty manhood to yield.  \"From the Cydnus he brought me hither to the blissful days which we were permitted to pass in my city of Alexandria.  A thousand sunny hours, musical, echoing surges which long since dashed down the stream of Time, he recalled to life, and I--I did the same, and our memories blended into one.  What never-to-be-forgotten moments we experienced when, with reckless mirth, we mingled unrecognized among the joyous throng!  What Olympic delight elated our hearts when the plaudits of thousands greeted us!  What joys satiated our minds and senses in our own apartments!  What pure, unalloyed nectar of the soul was bestowed upon us by our children-- bliss which we shared with and imparted to each other until neither knew which was the giver and which the receiver!  Everything sad and painful seemed to be effaced from the book of memory; and the child's dream, the fairy-tale woven by the power of imagination, stood before my soul as a reality--the same reality, I repeat, which I call my past life.  \"And, Charmian, if death comes to-morrow, should I say that he appeared too early--summoned me ere he permitted life to bestow all its best gifts upon me?  No, no, and again no!  Whoever, in the last hour of existence, can say that the fairest dreams of childhood were surpassed by a long portion of actual life, may consider himself happy, even in the deepest need and on the verge of the grave.  \"The aspiration to be first and highest among the women of her own time, which had already thrilled the young girl's heart, was fulfilled.  The ardent longing for love which, even at that period, pervaded my whole being, was satisfied when I became a loving wife, mother, and Queen, and friendship, through the favour of Destiny, also bestowed upon me its greatest blessings by the hands of Archibius, Charmian, and Iras.  \"Now I care not what may happen.  This evening taught me that life had fulfilled its pledges.  But others, too, must be enabled to remember the most brilliant of queens, who was also the most fervently beloved of women.  For this I will provide: the mausoleum which Gorgias is erecting for me will stand like an indestructible wall between the Cleopatra who to-day still proudly wears the crown and her approaching humiliation and disgrace.  \"Now I will go to sleep.  If my awakening brings defeat, sorrow, and death, I have no reason to accuse my fate.  It denied me one thing only the painless peace which the child and the young girl recognized as the chief good; yet Cleopatra will possess that also.  The domain of death, which, as the Egyptians say, loves silence, is opening its doors to me. The most absolute peace begins upon its threshold--who knows where it ends?  The vision of the intellect does not extend far enough to discover the boundary where, at the end of eternity--which in truth is endless-- it is replaced by something else.\"  While speaking, the Queen had motioned to her friend to accompany her into her chamber, from which a door led into the children's room.  An irresistible impulse constrained her to open it and gaze into the dark, empty apartment.  She felt an icy chill run through her veins.  Taking a light from the hand of one of the maids who attended her, she went to little Alexander's couch.  Like the others, it was empty, deserted.  Her head sank on her breast, the courageous calmness with which she had surveyed her whole past life failed and, like the luxuriant riot in the sky of the most brilliant hues, ere the glow of sunset suddenly yields to darkness, Cleopatra's soul, after the lofty elation of the last few hours, underwent a sudden transition and, overwhelmed by deep, sorrowful depression, she threw herself down before the twins' bed, where she lay weeping softly until Charmian, as day began to dawn, urged her to retire to rest.  Cleopatra slowly rose, dried her eyes, and said: \"My past life seemed to me just now like a magnificent garden, but how many serpents suddenly stretched out their flat heads with glittering eyes and forked tongues!  Who tore away the flowers beneath which they lay concealed? I think, Charmian, it was a mysterious power which here, in the children's apartment, rules so strongly the most trivial as well as the strongest emotions, it was--when did I last hear that ominous word?--it was conscience.  Here, in this abode of innocence and purity, whatever resembles a spot stands forth distinctly before the eyes.  Here, O Charmian!--if the children were but here!  If I could only--yet, no, no!  It is fortunate, very fortunate that they have gone.  I must be strong; and their sweet grace would rob me of my energy.  But the light grows brighter and brighter.  Dress me for the day.  It would be easier for me to sleep in a falling house than with such a tumult in my heart.\"  While she was being attired in the dark robes she had ordered, loud shouts arose from the royal harbour below, blended with the blasts of the tuba and other signals directing the movements of the fleet and the army, a large body of troops having been marched during the night to the neighbouring hills overlooking the sea.  The notes sounded bold and warlike.  The well-armed galleys presented a stately appearance.  How often Cleopatra had seen unexpected events occur, apparent impossibilities become possible!  Had not the victory of Octavianus at Actium been a miracle?  What if Fate, like a capricious ruler, now changed from frowns to smiles?  What if Antony proved himself the hero of yesterday, the general he had been in days of yore?  She had refused to see him again before the battle, that she might not divert his thoughts from the great task approaching.  But now, as she beheld him, clad in glittering armour like the god of war himself, ride before the troops on his fiery Barbary charger, greeting them with the gay salutation whose warmth sprung from the heart and which had so often kindled the warriors to glowing enthusiasm, she was forced to do violence to her own feelings to avoid calling him and saying that her thoughts would follow his course.  But she refrained, and when his purple cloak vanished from her sight her head drooped again.  How different in former days were the cheers of the troops when he showed himself to them!  This lukewarm response to his gay, glad greeting was no omen of victory.     CHAPTER XXII.  Dion, too, witnessed the departure of the troops.  Gorgias, whom he had found among the Ephebi, accompanied him and, like the Queen, they saw, in the cautious manner with which the army greeted the general, a bad omen for the result of the battle.  The architect had presented Dion to the youths as the ghost of a dead man, who, as soon as he was asked whence he came or whither he was going, would be compelled to vanish in the form of a fly.  He could venture to do this; he knew the Ephebi-- there was no traitor in their ranks.  Dion, the former head of the society, had been welcomed like a beloved brother risen from the dead, and he had the gratification, after so long a time, of turning the scale as speaker in a debate.  True, he had encountered very little opposition, for the resolve to hold aloof from the battle against the Romans had been urged upon the Ephebi by the Queen herself through Antyllus, who, however, had already left the meeting when Dion joined it.  It had seemed to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/54803"],["title","Playing Santa Claus, and Other Christmas Tales (#0)"],["body","(http://www.pgdp.net) from page images generously made available by Internet Archive (https://archive.org)    Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this       file which includes the original illustration.

A merry Christmas and a happy New Year to you, dear children! This little volume comes to you as a holiday gift, and in its pages we have endeavored to show you that true and lasting happiness can be found only in doing good to others. Let the lesson sink deep into your hearts. Even the least among you can do much good. Look around you. Do not wait for some great opportunity to offer, but with willing hearts and busy hands perform the most trifling acts of usefulness to others. Continue to do this throughout the year, and we will promise you that when another New Year dawns upon the earth, you will look back with rejoicing, giving thanks to your Heavenly Father that you have found that true happiness which can never be taken from you.                               PLAYING SANTA CLAUS.   “Wake up, wake up, Emma!” said little Caroline Meredith, as she gently shook her sister very early one winter’s morning; “I have something very pleasant to tell you.”  “What is it, Carrie?” answered the sleepy little girl, as she rubbed her eyes, and tried to comply with her sister’s request to “wake up.”  “Do you remember what day it is, Emma? To-morrow will be Christmas; and this evening will be Christmas Eve.”  “O Carrie, so it will!” exclaimed Emma, now fully awake; “and we shall hang up our stockings; and, oh, what beautiful things Santa Claus will bring us!”  “And what fine times we shall have to-morrow!” continued Caroline. “Aunt Margaret and all our cousins are coming to dine with us.”  “Oh, it will be delightful!” replied Emma. “We can show them our presents, and perhaps they will bring theirs to show to us; and we shall play so happily together!”  “And, you know, I have made a needle-book to give Aunt Margaret; and you have a work-bag for her,” added Caroline. “I am sure she will be pleased.”  “I know she will,” said Emma; “and father and mother will be pleased with the little presents we have got for them. I like to give things away; don’t you, Carrie?”  “Yes, very much,” replied Carrie. “I should like to be Santa Claus.”  “O Carrie! what a funny Santa Claus you would make!” exclaimed Emma; and both of the little girls laughed heartily at the idea.  “How I would come tumbling down the chimney, with my bag full of toys!” continued Caroline. “I would fill your stocking just as full as it could be, Emma.”  Emma laughed again; and then she was silent for a few moments, and looked very thoughtful.  “Do you think Santa Claus fills the poor children’s stockings, Carrie?” she asked.  Carrie looked grave also, as she replied,—  “I don’t know, Emma. _I_ would fill their stockings if _I_ were Santa Claus. But, Emma,” she continued, after a short pause, “you know there is not really any such person as Santa Claus. It is our father and mother, and other kind friends, who fill our stockings.”  “I know that, Carrie; and this makes me afraid that the _poor_ children do not have their stockings filled; because, you know, their friends have no money to spend for toys and pretty presents. Don’t you think it would be a good plan for every rich child to be a Santa Claus to some poor child?”  “O, yes, Emma!” exclaimed Carrie; “I think it would be a _beautiful_ plan. How came you to think of it?”  “I do not know, Carrie; but I suppose the good angels whispered it to me. You know mother says that all our good thoughts are from the angels.”  “Well, that is a good thought, I am sure,” replied Carrie; “and I am very glad that our father is rich, so that we can play Santa Claus. And then it is very pleasant to live in such a handsome house, and have such nice clothes and playthings; don’t you think so, Emma?”  “Yes, I do,” answered Emma; “and I always feel sorry for poor little children, who have none of these good things. You know little Mary and Ellen Drayton? Their mother is very poor.”  “I know she is, Emma; but she always seems cheerful, and the little girls look very happy. How neat and clean they always look!”  “Yes, Carrie: but their clothes are very old and patched; and they have very few books, and no playthings but one rag baby. When mother sent me there, the other day, to ask Mrs. Drayton about doing some work for her, I stopped a few moments to talk to the little girls.”  “Let us be their Santa Claus, if mamma is willing,” said Carrie. “I have got two little gold dollars that I will spend for them.”  “And I have two more,” added Emma. “I meant to have bought a large doll; but I would rather give the money to Mary and Ellen.”  The little girls now hastened to dress themselves, that they might go to their mother, and tell her of their plan, and ask her consent to spend their money in the way that they proposed.  Mrs. Meredith was quite willing, and, indeed, she was much pleased that her little daughters had thought of a way in which they might do good and give pleasure to others; and she said that she would add two more gold dollars to theirs, and would go with them to buy the gifts for Mary and Ellen.  After breakfast was over, she talked a little more with them on the subject, and told them that it would not be best to spend all the money for books and toys, because the little girls were much in need of warm clothing, and it would be doing them more good to buy some things of that kind.  Caroline and Emma were willing to do as their mother thought best; but they begged her to buy a _few_ books and toys, because they thought it would make the little girls so happy. They felt very happy to find that six dollars would buy so many things. There was not only a pretty dress for each little girl, and some warm stockings and shoes, but also a dress for Mrs. Drayton; and there was still money enough left for two pretty books, two dolls, and some other toys. To these, Mrs. Meredith proposed that Caroline and Emma should add some of their own books and playthings, which they could well spare; and she said that she had several articles, which would be useful to Mrs. Drayton, which she would put with those they had bought.  The little girls could hardly contain their delight when they saw all these nice presents packed in one large basket, and another one filled with tea, sugar, pies, cakes, a roasted chicken, and some other articles of food, that Mrs. Drayton and her children might have a good Christmas-dinner.  Carrie and Emma were so happy that they could hardly wait for evening, that they might play “Santa Claus,” as they called it; and they quite forgot to think about the pretty presents which they hoped to receive themselves, because they were so busy in thinking of the joy that Mary and Ellen would feel when the baskets should be unpacked.  “Let us try to be patient, and wait until the girls have gone to bed,” said Carrie. “Mrs. Drayton sits up very late to sew; and, if mother will let John carry the baskets for us, we will go and knock softly at the door, and give her the things, and ask her to put some of the toys into Mary’s and Ellen’s stockings. How surprised they will be in the morning!”  Emma readily agreed to this plan; and, as the house was very near, Mrs. Meredith was quite willing that they should do so.  We will now leave them to pass a happy afternoon in assisting their mother in some preparations which she wished to make for the entertainment of the young friends whom they expected to spend Christmas with them, while we take a peep into Mrs. Drayton’s neat but humble dwelling.  Mary and Ellen were seated close by the side of their mother, who was sewing busily on a pair of coarse overalls,—the last of a dozen pairs which she had engaged to make. Mary had learned to sew neatly enough to be of some assistance, and her mother had just given her leave to hem the bottom of one of the legs of the overalls; while little Ellen was reading aloud from a story-book, which had been given to her at school as a reward for her good behavior. The story which she was reading was a Christmas-tale; and it told of a happy family of children who gathered around the beautiful Christmas-tree.  When Ellen had finished her story, she laid down the book, and seemed very thoughtful for a few minutes. Presently she looked up in her mother’s face, and said, very gently,—  “Will you please to let us"]]]
