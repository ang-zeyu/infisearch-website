I felt a strong desire to see these ancient relics and told him I would be much pleased to have him inform me where they were to be found. He stated that they had long since been taken away. He further said that he knew \"Joe\" Smith as a \"money digger\" and a \"visionary man\" and Martin Harris as an honest reliable farmer. Joseph in his history says that he worked in a mine for Mr. Stowel, hunting for hidden treasures, at fourteen dollars per month, hence his name as a money-digger. I then inquired if he ever knew Joseph Smith to be convicted of crime. He replied that he had not known him as having been convicted. The surrounding scenery, which embraced a young grove of beech, sugar maple, hickory, oak, bass-wood, etc., covering about five acres of ground, was very beautiful. The grove is about 200 yards southwest of where the plates were found. There was a fine, well-cultivated field of grain on the hillside. My loquacious guide showed me another and much deeper cavity made on the east side of the hill by the above-named Rochester treasure seekers, a company of prospectors. They said that science aided by mineral rods did not lie and that most assuredly there were rich treasures concealed in the hill, and they were determined to have them. But with all their science and laborious excavations they failed to get a glimpse of the coveted treasures and returned to their homes if not richer, at least it is to be hoped wiser men, for the only results of their efforts were the holes they left on the hillside. Notwithstanding this, there are strong and feasible reasons for believing that there is abundance of treasure hid up in Cumorah, but it is guarded by the hand of the Lord and none shall ever possess it until made known in the due time of the Lord. The great and mighty nation of the Jaredites, having departed from God and shed the blood of the prophets, became divided into bloodthirsty factions, who waged relentless and merciless wars against each other for many years; finally, after millions were slain, they arrayed themselves into two mighty opposing armies and mutually agreed to give each other four years in which to gather their entire forces of men, women and children around Ramah, and there make one last appalling death struggle for victory, but so well were these colossal armies matched in numbers, valor, fury and hatred that they continued to fight day after day till both sides were completely destroyed from the face of the land. One man of all these great and mighty armies alone remained alive. Ere they begin the dreadful carnage, they made excavations and hid up in Ramah their immense treasures.  The Lord again peopled the land and they too became haughty and lifted up in the pride of their hearts, renounced God and slew his prophets, and division, war and bloodshed again filled the land with horror. Once more were immense hosts arrayed into two great armies, the one called the Nephites, the other the Lamanites, and strange to say they also marshalled their forces, and undertook to make one last death struggle for victory or death. The battle ceased when the Nephites were destroyed, and again millions lay dead upon the fatal ground. The Jaredites' Ramah was the Nephites' Cumorah, and their ashes commingle and repose in death. Ere this last horrid conflict commenced, they, too, hid their untold treasures in this HIll Cumorah, and it was said by President Young at Farmington, Davis Co., Utah, June 17, 1877, just two months and twelve days before his death:  \"There were a great many treasures hid up by the Nephites. * * * I lived right in the country where the plates were found from which the Book of Mormon was translated, and I know a great many things pertaining to that country. I believe I will take the liberty to tell you of another circumstance that will be as marvelous as anything can be. This is an incident in the life of Oliver Cowdery, but he did not take the liberty of telling such things in meeting as I take. I tell these things to you, and I have a motive for doing so. I want to carry them to the ears of my brethren and sisters, and the children also, that they may grow to an understanding of some things that seem to be entirely hidden from the human family. Oliver Cowdery went with the Prophet Joseph when he deposited these plates. Joseph did not translate all of the plates: there was a portion of these sealed which you can learn from the Book of Doctrine and Covenants. When Joseph got the plates, the angel instructed him to carry them back to the Hill Cumorah, which he did. Oliver says that when Joseph and Oliver went there, the hill opened, and they walked into a cave, in which there was a large and spacious room. * * * They laid the plates on a table; it was a large table that stood in the room. Under this table there was a pile of plates as much as two feet high, and there were altogether in this room more plates than probably many wagon loads; they were piled up in the corners and along the walls. * * * I tell you this as coming not only from Oliver Cowdery, but others who were familiar with it. * * * I relate this to you, and I want you to understand it. I take this liberty of referring to these things so that they will not be forgotten and lost.  \"Carlos Smith was a young man of as much veracity as any young man we had, and he was a witness to these things. Samuel Smith saw some things, Hyrum saw a good many things, but Joseph was the leader. Now, you may think I am unwise in publicly telling these things, thinking perhaps I should preserve them in my own breast; but such is not my mind. I would like the people called Latter-day Saints to understand some little things with regard to the workings and dealings of the Lord with his people here upon the earth.\"_--Journal of Discourses, Vol. 19, p. 36._  It was likewise stated to me by David Whitmer in the year 1877 that Oliver Cowdery told him that the Prophet Joseph and himself had seen this room and that it was filled with treasure, and on a table therein were the breastplate and the sword of Laban, as well as the portion of gold plates not yet translated, and that these plates were bound by three small gold rings, and would also be translated, as was the first portion in the days of Joseph. When they are translated much useful information will be brought to light. But till that day arrives, no Rochester adventurers shall ever see them or the treasures, although science and mineral rods testify that they are there. At the proper time when greed, selfishness and corruption shall cease to reign in the hearts of the people, these vast hoards of hidden treasure shall be brought forth to be used for the cause and kingdom of Jesus Christ.  Changing the scene once more another prophet, whose name was Mormon, stood on the summit of this hill. At that time a great and fierce battle was fought. After the conclusion of the battle, which occurred about 1472 years ago, Mormon's grief was expressed on this heart-rending and doleful scene as found on page 560 of their history in the Book of Mormon. We will here again refer to the great battle of the Lamanites and Nephites:   \"And when they had gone through and hewn down all my people save it  were twenty and four of us, (among whom was my son Moroni) and we  having survived the dead of our people, did behold on the morrow, * * *  from the top of the hill Cumorah, the ten thousand of my people who  were hewn down, being led in the front by me. And we also beheld the  ten thousand of my people who were led by my son Moroni.\" (Mormon  6:11-12)  And other generals are named who led each their ten thousand until we reach the enormous number of two hundred and thirty thousand men, with their wives and children, who were strewn around this most marvelous hill:   \"And their flesh, and bones, and blood lay upon the face of the earth,  * * * to moulder upon the land, and to crumble and to return to their  mother earth. And my soul was rent with anguish, because of the slain  of my people, and I cried: O ye fair ones, how could ye have departed  from the ways of the Lord! O ye fair ones, how could ye have rejected  that _Jesus,_ who stood with open arms to receive you! Behold, if  ye had not done this, ye would not have fallen. But behold, ye are  fallen, and I mourn your loss. O ye fair sons and daughters, ye  fathers and mothers, ye husbands and wives, ye fair ones, how is it  that ye could have fallen! But behold, ye are gone, and my sorrows  cannot bring your return. And the day soon cometh that your mortal  must put on immortality, and these bodies which are now mouldering in  corruption must soon become incorruptible bodies; and then ye must  stand before the judgment seat of Christ, to be judged according to  your works; and if it so be that ye are righteous, then are ye blessed  with your fathers who have gone before you. O that ye had repented  before this great destruction had come upon you. But behold, ye are  gone, and the Father of heaven knoweth your state, and He doeth with  you according to His justice and mercy.\"   Before leaving the prophet Mormon standing on the hill in his  lamentation, let us still extend the vision over the great  battlefield, calling to mind that the 230,000 men were all soldiers,  then were their wives, mothers, fathers, brothers and sisters, which  we will multiply by five, making 1,150,000 souls; then extend the  vision over and around the enemy's camp, and at least double the  number of slain, increasing the sad scene to the enormous total of  2,300,000 souls. Only for a moment imagine that we see the camp just  before that great battle: twenty-three camps each of 10,000, with a  general at their head, would be required for the 230,000 soldiers.   While I was standing upon this same spot of ground about three years  ago, my mind contrasted the various changes of the present with the  past and I fancied that I could review, as did Mormon, the sad and "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/54337"],["title","Reminiscences of Joseph, the Prophet, and the Coming Forth of the Book of Mormon (#4)"],["body"," gloomy picture of his time, 1472 years ago.   The fathers of those who fell around this historic hill came from  Jerusalem 600 years B.C. They were warned of God to flee from the  land, because of the terrible calamities that were about to befall the  inhabitants of that once Holy City, for killing the prophets of God  and for their wickedness.   The decrees of God were fulfilled in the destruction of the  inhabitants of Jerusalem, after they crucified the Saviour and his  disciples, and became fully ripe in iniquity. But 600 years before  these disasters, the colony, who were directed by revelation, crossed  the sea, landing in South America, building up cities, migrating  northward, and leaving in their tracks northward many cities, temples,  massive walls, and fortifications, some of which have been discovered  by Catherwood and Stevens, as well as by many other historians; and  new discoveries are still being brought to light. Among the many  remarkable ruined aboriginal cities of the continent of America,  Palenque is one of the most noted. It is situated on the Rio Chacamas,  a branch of the great river Usumasinta, on the borders of Yucatan. It  is in latitude 17 degrees 30 minutes north, longitude 92 degrees 25  minutes west. In this old city of ruins is a temple--no doubt one of  the Nephite temples. The picture shows it as restored from the relics  that are left. It is built of stone and is at the base 310 feet long,  180 feet deep, and 25 feet high. Ranges of stone steps 30 feet broad  lead up to it, flanked with gigantic statues nine feet high, carved  in stone. There are numerous hieroglyphics engraven but considerably  defaced.   [Image: Palenque Restored.]   The Book of Mormon speaks of many temples and cities which were built  by the people of this time, and no doubt this is one of them in  ruins. But who is there that is able to tell the story of those mound  builders, excepting their own revealed history?   It must be remembered that this last nation, called Nephites, became  a very numerous people, and their history, which they were commanded  of the Lord to keep on thin plates of gold, informs us that while  they lived lives of purity, serving God prayerfully, they prospered  exceedingly.   The precious metals abounded on this new and promised land, so  beautifully described by the ancient prophet Moses. This man of God,  just before his death, blessed the children of Israel, and of Joseph,  he said:   \"Blessed of the Lord be this land, for the precious things of heaven,  for the dew, and for the deep that coucheth beneath, and for the  precious fruits brought forth by the sun, and for the precious things  put forth by the moon, and for the chief things of the ancient  mountains, and for the precious things of the lasting hills, and for  the precious things of the earth and fulness thereof, and for the good  will of him that dwelt in the bush let the blessing come upon the head  of Joseph, and upon the top of the head of him that was separated  from his brethren. His glory is like the firstling of his bullock,  and his horns are like the horns of unicorns: with them he shall push  the people together to the ends of the earth: and they are the ten  thousands of Ephraim, and the thousands of Manasseh.\"  Now, if we can successfully establish this continent of America as being the land spoken of by Moses--which is verily true--then we shall find not only those lost nations but the present generation dwelling on this land abounding in the good things found even in the lasting hills, and a choice land above all others.  As evidence I will introduce the words of our famed patriarch, Father Jacob:   \"Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well; whose  branches [children] run over the wall [the ocean]. The archers have  sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him, but his bow abode  in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands  of the mighty God of Jacob; from thence is the Shepherd, the stone of  Israel. Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; and by  the Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above,  blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the breasts,  and of the womb: The blessings of thy father have prevailed above  the blessings of my progenitors [Abraham and Isaac, whose land was  Jerusalem] unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills [Rocky  Mountains;] they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of  the head of him that was separate from his brethren [which was Joseph,  sold by his brethren into Egypt].\"  Father Lehi and his son Nephi and others, just before crossing the sea, or wall of waters, to this choice land of Jacob, searched the records which were brought from Jerusalem and these are the words which they found recorded:   \"And my father Lehi also found upon the plates of brass, a genealogy  of his fathers; wherefore he knew that he was a descendant of Joseph,  yea, even that Joseph who was the son of Jacob, who was sold into  Egypt, and who was preserved by the hand of the Lord, that he might  preserve his father, Jacob, and all his household from perishing with  famine. And they were also led out of captivity and out of the land of  Egypt, by that same God who had preserved them. And thus my Father,  Lehi, did discover the genealogy of his fathers.\"  While Father Lehi and those who were with him encamped on the borders of the Red Sea, by a command of the Lord the sons of Lehi returned to Jerusalem and succeeded in bringing Ishmael (a righteous Israelite of the \"tribe of Ephraim\") with his five marriageable daughters, to join the colony. They finally emigrated to America, literally fulfilling the words of Jacob with regard to Joseph's promised inheritance of the choice land that was to reach to the everlasting hills. By this new acquisition, the sons of Lehi were provided with wives, and that, too, of Ephraimitish blood, making the remnants of their line, who were discovered in the year 1492 by Christopher Columbus, of the lineage of Ephraim and Manassah, whose descendants are the American Indians. Thus are we provided with a history which every one should read and become acquainted with the origin of the natives of America, and find an explanation of the ruins found in North, South and Central America. Their history, translated from the gold plates, is now called the Book of Mormon. This book also gives a brief account of a previous nation, which left the Tower of Babel 2,000 years B. C., landing near the Gulf of California. They were 344 days in crossing the ocean. In process of time, they emigrated northward and finally became a great nation and people.  Here follows a few words as recorded in their history on page 571, chapter first, thirty-third verse:   \"Jared came forth with his brother and their families, with some  others and their families, from the great Tower, at the time the Lord  confounded the language of the people and swore in his wrath that they  should be scattered upon all the face of the earth.\"  In addition to these words we will add the seventh and eighth verses of the eleventh chapter of Genesis:   \"Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they  may not understand one another's speech. So the Lord scattered them  abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth.\"  I think America is a pretty large portion of the earth, and comes in for its share of people. According to the word of the Lord the people _were_ scattered. Those who wish to follow this colony closely can read their history as found in the Book of Mormon until they had built up cities, etc., which have been and are being constantly discovered. In process of time they numbered about 15,000,000 people and became rich, wicked and ripe for destruction.  At one time a fierce battle was fought near where Buffalo, N. Y., now stands, wherein two million were lying strewn upon the earth, slain in battle and no one to bury them, till the stench drove them southward to the Hill Ramah, which was called Cumorah by the Nephite race. A contract was entered into between Kings Coriantumr and Shiz, giving Coriantumr four years to gather together all who were on the side of Coriantumr, and all for King Shiz were gathered together unto his camp. Ether has recorded in the Book of Mormon that:   \"The army of Coriantumr did pitch their tents by the hill Ramah. And  it was that same hill where my Father Mormon did hide up the records  unto the Lord, which were sacred. * * * When they were all gathered  together, every one to the army which he would, with their wives and  their children, both men, women and children being armed with weapons  of war, having shields, and breast-plates, and head-plates, and being  clothed after the manner of war, they did march forth one against the  other to battle; and they fought all that day, and conquered not, and  when it was night they were weary, and retired to their camps; and  after they had retired to their camps, they took up a howling and a  lamentation for the loss of their people who were slain; their howling  and lamentation did rend the air exceedingly.\"  A continuation of this lamentable slaughter, with weeping and howling, was kept up for six successive days, till only thirty-two of the people of Shiz and twenty-seven of Coriantumr's were left, and on the seventh day Coriantumr with his twenty-seven retreated, which gave the opposing King Shiz fresh courage. He said, \"I will slay Coriantumr or perish by the sword,\" and indeed his words were fulfilled after a severe battle, in which all were slain, excepting King Shiz, who had fallen faint and weak, and Coriantumr, who leaned upon his sword to rest, after which he smote off the head of Shiz and fell to the ground as if he was dead. Here the history leaves this, the only survivor of those two mighty armies, around this historic Hill Cumorah, thus bringing to pass the words of the prophet Ether, who"]]]
