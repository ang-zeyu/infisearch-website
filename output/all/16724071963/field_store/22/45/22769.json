Then a train of male and female slaves appeared, among them two fat eunuchs.  \"I can still see the angry look with which my father surveyed all these people.  He drove at once to the city, and on his return his clear eyes were as untroubled as ever.  A court official accompanied him, and only that portion of the useless amount of luggage and number of persons that my father desired remained.  \"The princesses were to come the next morning--it was at the end of February--flowers were blooming in the grass and on the bushes, while the foliage of the trees glittered with the fresh green which the rising sap gives to the young leaves.  I was sitting on a strong bough of a sycamore-tree, which grew opposite to the house, watching for them. Their arrival was delayed and, as I gazed meanwhile over the garden, I thought it must surely please them, for not a palace in the city had one so beautiful.  \"At last the litters appeared; they had neither runners nor attendants, as my father had requested, and when the princesses alighted--both at the same moment--I knew not which way to turn my eyes first, for the creature that fluttered like a dragon-fly rather than stepped from the first litter, was not a girl like other mortals--she seemed like a wish, a hope.  When the dainty, beautiful creature turned her head hither and thither, and at last gazed questioningly, as if beseeching help, into the faces of my father and mother, who stood at the gate to receive her, it seemed to me that such must have been the aspect of Psyche when she stood pleading for mercy at the throne of Zeus.  \"But it was worth while to look at the other also.  Was that Cleopatra? She might have been the elder, for she was as tall as her sister, but how utterly unlike!  From the waving hair to every movement of the hands and body the former--it was Cleopatra--had seemed to me as if she were flying.  Everything about the second figure, on the contrary, was solid, nay, even seemed to offer positive resistance.  She sprang from the litter and alighted on the ground with both feet at once, clung firmly to the door, and haughtily flung back her head, crowned with a wealth of dark locks.  Her complexion was pink and white, and her blue eyes sparkled brightly enough; but the expression with which she gazed at my parents was defiant rather than questioning, and as she glanced around her red lips curled scornfully as though she deemed her surroundings despicable and unworthy of her royal birth.  \"This irritated me against the seven-year-old child, yet I said to myself that, though it was very beautiful here--thanks to my father's care-- perhaps it appeared plain and simple when compared with the marble, gold, and purple of the royal palace whence she came.  Her features, too, were regular and beautiful, and she would have attracted attention by her loveliness among a multitude.  When I soon heard her issue imperious commands and defiantly insist upon the fulfilment of every wish, I thought, in my boyish ignorance, that Arsinoe must be the elder; for she was better suited to wield a sceptre than her sister.  I said so to my brother and Charmian; but we all soon saw which really possessed queenly majesty; for Arsinoe, if her will were crossed, wept, screamed, and raged like a lunatic, or, if that proved useless, begged and teased; while if Cleopatra wanted anything she obtained it in a different way.  Even at that time she knew what weapons would give her victory and, while using them, she still remained the child of a king.  \"No artisan's daughter could have been further removed from airs of majestic pathos than this embodiment of the most charming childlike grace; but if anything for which her passionate nature ardently longed was positively refused, she understood how to attain it by the melody of her voice, the spell of her eyes, and in extreme cases by a silent tear. When to such tears were added uplifted hands and a few sweet words, such as, 'It would make me happy,' or, 'Don't you see how it hurts me?' resistance was impossible; and in after-years also her silent tears and the marvellous music of her voice won her a victory in the decisive questions of life.  \"We children were soon playmates and friends, for my parents did not wish the princesses to begin their studies until after they felt at home with us.  This pleased Arsinoe, although she could already read and write; but Cleopatra more than once asked to hear something from my father's store of wisdom, of which she had been told.  \"The King and her former teacher had cherished the highest expectations from the brilliant intellect of this remarkable child, and Olympus once laid his hand on my curls and bade me take care that the princess did not outstrip the philosopher's son.  I had always occupied one of the foremost places, and laughingly escaped, assuring him that there was no danger.  \"But I soon learned that this warning was not groundless.  You will think that the old fool's heart has played him a trick, and in the magic garden of childish memories the gifted young girl was transformed into a goddess.  That she certainly was not; for the immortals are free from the faults and weaknesses of humanity.\"  \"And what robbed Cleopatra of the renown of resembling the gods?\" asked Barine eagerly.  A subtle smile, not wholly free from reproach, accompanied Archibius's reply: \"Had I spoken of her virtues, you would hardly have thought of asking further details.  But why should I try to conceal what she has displayed to the world openly enough throughout her whole life? Falsehood and hypocrisy were as unfamiliar to her as fishing is to the sons of the desert.  The fundamental principles which have dominated this rare creature's life and character to the present day are two ceaseless desires: first, to surpass every one, even in the most difficult achievements; and, secondly, to love and to be loved in return.  From them emanated what raised her above all other women.  Ambition and love will also sustain her like two mighty wings on the proud height to which they have borne her, so long as they dwell harmoniously in her fiery soul.  Hitherto a rare favour of destiny has permitted this, and may the Olympians grant that thus it may ever be!\"  Here Archibius paused, wiped the perspiration from his brow, asked if the messenger had arrived, and ordered him to be admitted as soon as he appeared.  Then he went on as calmly as before:  \"The princesses were members of our household, and in the course of time they seemed like sisters.  During the first winter the King allowed them to spend only the most inclement months at Philae, for he was unwilling to live without them.  True, he saw them rarely enough; weeks often elapsed without a visit; but, on the other hand, he often came day after day to our garden, clad in plain garments, and borne in an unpretending litter, for these visits were kept secret from every one save the leech Olympus.  \"I often saw the tall, strong man, with red, bloated face, playing with his children like a mechanic who had just returned from work.  But he usually remained only a short time, seeming to be satisfied with having seen them again.  Perhaps he merely wished to assure himself that they were comfortable with us.  At any rate, no one was permitted to go near the group of plane-trees where he talked with them.  \"But it is easy to hide amid the dense foliage of these trees, so my knowledge that he questioned them is not solely hearsay.  \"Cleopatra was happy with us from the beginning; Arsinoe needed a longer time; but the King valued only the opinion of his older child, his darling, on whom he feasted his eyes and ears like a lover.  He often shook his heavy head at the sight of her, and when she gave him one of her apt replies, he laughed so loudly that the sound of his deep, resonant voice was heard as far as the house.  \"Once I saw tear after tear course down his flushed cheeks, and yet his visit was shorter than usual.  The closed 'harmamaxa' in which he came bore him from our house directly to the vessel which was to convey him to Cyprus and Rome.  The Alexandrians, headed by the Queen, had forced him to leave the city and the country.  \"He was indeed unworthy of the crown, but he loved his little daughter like a true father.  Still, it was terrible, monstrous for him to invoke curses upon the mother and sister of the children, in their presence, and in the same breath command them to hate and execrate them, but to love and never forget him.  \"I was then seventeen and Cleopatra ten years old.  I, who loved my parents better than my life, felt an icy chill run through my veins and then a touch upon my heart like balsam, as I heard little Arsinoe, after her father had gone, whisper to her sister, 'We will hate them--may the gods destroy them!' and when Cleopatra answered with tearful eyes, 'Let us rather be better than they, very good indeed, Arsinoe, that the immortals may love us and bring our father back.'  \"'Because then he will make you Queen,' replied Arsinoe sneeringly, still trembling with angry excitement.  \"Cleopatra gazed at her with a troubled look.  \"Her tense features showed that she was weighing the meaning of the words, and I can still see her as she suddenly drew up her small figure, and said proudly, 'Yes, I will be Queen!'  \"Then her manner changed, and in the sweetest tones of her soft voice, she said beseechingly, 'You won't say such naughty things again, will you?'  \"This was at the time that my father's instruction began to take possession of her mind.  The prediction of Olympus was fulfilled.  True, I attended the school of oratory, but when my father set the royal maiden a lesson, I was permitted to repeat mine on the same subject, and frequently I could not help admitting that Cleopatra had succeeded better than I.  \"Soon there were difficult problems to master, for the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5474"],["title","Cleopatra â€” Volume 02 (#5)"],["body"," of this wonderful child demanded stronger food, and she was introduced into philosophy.  My father himself belonged to the school of Epicurus, and succeeded far beyond his expectations in rousing Cleopatra's interest in his master's teachings.  She had been made acquainted with the other great philosophers also, but always returned to Epicurus, and induced the rest of us to live with her as a true disciple of the noble Samian.  \"Your father and brother have doubtless made you familiar with the precepts of the Stoa; yet you have certainly heard that Epicurus spent the latter part of his life with his friends and pupils in quiet meditation and instructive conversation in his garden at Athens.  We, too--according to Cleopatra's wish--were to live thus and call ourselves 'disciples of Epicurus.'  \"With the exception of Arsinoe, who preferred gayer pastimes, into which she drew my brother Straton--at that time a giant in strength--we all liked the plan.  I was chosen master, but I perceived that Cleopatra desired the position, so she took my place.  \"During our next leisure afternoon we paced up and down the garden, and the conversation about the chief good was so eager, Cleopatra directed it with so much skill, and decided doubtful questions so happily, that we reluctantly obeyed the brazen gong which summoned us to the house, and spent the whole evening in anticipating the next afternoon.  \"The following morning my father saw several country people assembled before the secluded garden; but he did not have time to inquire what they wanted; for Timagenes, who shared the instruction in history--you know he was afterwards taken to Rome as a prisoner of war--rushed up to him, holding out a tablet which bore the inscription Epicurus had written on the gate of his garden: 'Stranger, here you will be happy; here is the chief good, pleasure.'  \"Cleopatra had written this notice in large letters on the top of a small table before sunrise, and a slave had secretly fastened it on the gate for her.  \"This prank might have easily proved fatal to our beautiful companionship, but it had been done merely to make our game exactly like the model.  \"My father did not forbid our continuing this pastime, but strictly prohibited our calling ourselves 'Epicureans' outside of the garden, for this noble name had since gained among the people a significance wholly alien.  Epicurus says that true pleasure is to be found only in peace of mind and absence of pain.\"  \"But every one,\" interrupted Barine, \"believes that people like the wealthy Isidorus, whose object in life is to take every pleasure which his wealth can procure, are the real Epicureans.  My mother would not have confided me long to a teacher by whose associates 'pleasure' was deemed the chief good.\"  \"The daughter of a philosopher,\" replied Archibius, gently shaking his head, \"ought to understand what pleasure means in the sense of Epicurus, and no doubt you do.  True, those who are further removed from these things cannot know that the master forbids yearning for individual pleasure.  Have you an idea of his teachings?  No definite one?  Then permit me a few words of explanation.  It happens only too often that Epicurus is confounded with Aristippus, who places sensual pleasure above intellectual enjoyment, as he holds that bodily pain is harder to endure than mental anguish.  Epicurus, on the contrary, considers intellectual pleasure to be the higher one; for sensual enjoyment, which he believes free to every one, can be experienced only in the present, while intellectual delight extends to both the past and the future.  To the Epicureans the goal of life, as has already been mentioned, is to attain the chief blessings, peace of mind, and freedom from pain.  He is to practise virtue only because it brings him pleasure; for who could remain virtuous without being wise, noble, and just?--and whoever is all these cannot have his peace of mind disturbed, and must be really happy in the exact meaning of the master.  I perceived long since the peril lurking in this system of instruction, which takes no account of moral excellence; but at that time it seemed to me also the chief good.  \"How all this charmed the mind of the thoughtful child, still untouched by passion!  It was difficult to supply her wonderfully vigorous intellect with sufficient sustenance, and she really felt that to enrich it was the highest pleasure.  And to her, who could scarcely endure to have a rude hand touch her, though a small grief or trivial disappointment could not be averted, the freedom from pain which the master had named as the first condition for the existence of every pleasure, and termed the chief good, seemed indeed the first condition of a happy life.  \"Yet this child, whom my father once compared to a thinking flower, bore without complaint her sad destiny--her father's banishment, her mother's death, her sister Berenike's profligacy.  Even to me, in whom she found a second brother and fully trusted, she spoke of these sorrowful things only in guarded allusions.  I know that she understood what was passing fully and perfectly, and how deeply she felt it; but pain placed itself between her and the 'chief good,' and she mastered it.  And when she sat at work, with what tenacious power the delicate creature struggled until she had conquered the hardest task and outstripped Charmian and even me!  \"In those days I understood why, among the gods, a maiden rules over learning, and why she is armed with the weapons of war.  You have heard how many languages Cleopatra speaks.  A remark of Timagenes had fallen into her soul like a seed.  'With every language you learn,' he had said, 'you will gain a nation.'  But there were many peoples in her father's kingdom, and when she was Queen they must all love her.  True, she began with the tongue of the conquerors, not the conquered.  So it happened that we first learned Lucretius, who reproduces in verse the doctrines of Epicurus.  My father was our teacher, and the second year she read Lucretius as if it were a Greek book.  She had only half known Egyptian; now she speedily acquired it.  During our stay at Philae she found a troglodyte who was induced to teach her his language.  There were Jews enough here in Alexandria to instruct her in theirs, and she also learned its kindred tongue, Arabic.  \"When, many years later, she visited Antony at Tarsus, the warriors imagined that some piece of Egyptian magic was at work, for she addressed each commander in his own tongue, and talked with him as if she were a native of the same country.  \"It was the same with everything.  She outstripped us in every branch of study.  To her burning ambition it would have been unbearable to lag behind.  \"The Roman Lucretius became her favourite poet, although she was no more friendly to his nation than I, but the self-conscious power of the foe pleased her, and once I heard her exclaim 'Ah! if the Egyptians were Romans, I would give up our garden for Berenike's throne.'  \"Lucretius constantly led her back to Epicurus, and awakened a severe conflict in her unresting mind.  You probably know that he teaches that life in itself is not so great a blessing that it must be deemed a misfortune not to live.  It is only spoiled by having death appear to us as the greatest of misfortunes.  Only the soul which ceases to regard death as a misfortune finds peace.  Whoever knows that thought and feeling end with life will not fear death; for, no matter how many dear and precious things the dead have left here below, their yearning for them has ceased with life.  He declares that providing for the body is the greatest folly, while the Egyptian religion, in which Anubis strove to strengthen her faith, maintained precisely the opposite.  \"To a certain degree he succeeded, for his personality exerted a powerful influence over her; and besides, she naturally took great pleasure in mystical, supernatural things, as my brother Straton did in physical strength, and you, Barine, enjoy the gift of song.  You know Anubis by sight.  What Alexandrian has not seen this remarkable man? and whoever has once met his eyes does not easily forget him.  He does indeed rule over mysterious powers, and he used them in his intercourse with the young princess.  It is his work if she cleaves to the religious belief of her people, if she who is a Hellene to the last drop of blood loves Egypt, and is ready to make any sacrifice for her independence and grandeur.  She is called 'the new Isis,' but Isis presides over the magic arts of the Egyptians, and Anubis initiated Cleopatra into this secret science, and even persuaded her to enter the observatory and the laboratory--  \"But all these things had their origin in our garden of Epicurus, and my father did not venture to forbid it; for the King had sent a message from Rome to say that he was glad to have Cleopatra find pleasure in her own people and their secret knowledge.  \"The flute-player, during his stay on the Tiber, had given his gold to the right men or bound them as creditors to his interest.  After Pompey, Caesar, and Crassus had concluded their alliance, they consented at Lucca to the restoration of the Ptolemy.  Millions upon millions would not have seemed to him too large a price for this object.  Pompey would rather have gone to Egypt himself, but the jealousy of the others would not permit it.  Gabinius, the Governor of Syria, received the commission.  \"But the occupants of the Egyptian throne were not disposed to resign it without a struggle.  You know that meanwhile Queen Berenike, Cleopatra's sister, had been twice married.  She had her miserable first husband strangled--a more manly spouse had been chosen by the Alexandrians for her second consort.  He bravely defended his rights, and lost his life on the field of battle.  \"The senate learned speedily enough that Gabinius had brought the Ptolemy back to his country; the news reached us more slowly.
