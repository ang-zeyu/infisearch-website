All this, he thought, he could now repay, for certainly his old patron was poor enough, and he intended honestly to share with his former benefactor the profits he expected to realize with so fair a prodigy as Dada.  No harm could come to the girl, and gold-- said he to himself--glitters as brightly and is just as serviceable, even when it has been earned for us against our will.  Medius, being a cautious man, made the girl bring her new dress away with her, and the girdle and jewels belonging to it, and his neat hands packed everything into the smallest compass.  He filled up the basket which he took for the purpose with sweetmeats, oranges and pomegranates \"for the children at home,\" and easily consoled Dada for the loss of her shoes. He would lead the ass and she should ride.  She covered her face with a veil, and her little feet could be hidden under her dress.  When they reached his house he would at once have \"a sweet little pair of sandals\" made for her by the shoemaker who worked for the wife of the Comes and the daughters of the Alabarch--[The chief of the Jewish colony in Alexandria.]--These preparations and the start only took a few minutes; and their rapid search and broken conversation caused so much absurd confusion that Dada had quite recovered her spirits and laughed merrily as she tripped bare-foot across the strand.  She sprang gaily on to the little donkey and as they made their way along the road, the basket containing her small wardrobe placed in front of her on the ass's shoulders, she remarked that she should be mistaken for the young wife of a shabby old husband, returning from market with a load of provisions.  She was delighted to think of what Herse's face would be when, on her return home, she should discover that the prisoner could make her escape even without shoes.  \"Let her have a good hunt for me!\"  she cried quite enchanted.  \"Why should I always be supposed to be ready for folly and wickedness!  But one thing I warn you: If I am not comfortable and happy with you, and if I do not like the parts you want me to fill, we part as quickly as we have come together.--Why are you taking me through all these dirty alleys?  I want to ride through the main streets and see what is going on.\"  But Medius would not agree to this, for in the great arteries of the town there were excitement and tumult, and they might think themselves fortunate if they reached his house unmolested.  He lived in a little square, between the Greek quarter and Rhacotis where the Egyptians lived, and his house, which was exactly opposite the church of St. Marcus, accommodated Medius himself, his wife, his widowed daughter and her five children, besides being crammed from top to bottom with all sorts of strange properties, standing or hanging in every available space.  Dada's curiosity had no rest, and by the time she had spent a few hours in the house her host's pretty little grandchildren were clinging to her with devoted affection.  Agne had not been so fortunate as to find a refuge so easily.  With no escort, unveiled, and left entirely to her own guidance, leading the little boy, she hurried forward, not knowing whither.  All she thought was to get away--far away from these men who were trying to imperil her immortal soul.  She knew that Karnis had actually bought her, and that she was, therefore, his property and chattel.  Even Christian doctrine taught her that the slave must obey his master; but she could not feel like a slave, and if indeed she were one her owner might destroy and kill her body, but not her soul.  The law, however, was on the side of Karnis, and it allowed him to pursue her and cast her into prison.  This idea haunted her, and for fear of being caught she avoided all the chief thoroughfares and kept close to the houses as she stole through the side streets and alleys.  Once, in Antioch, she had seen a runaway slave, who, having succeeded in reaching a statue of the Emperor and laying his hand on it, was by that act safe from his pursuers.  There must surely be such a statue somewhere in Alexandria--but where?  A woman, of whom she enquired, directed her down a wider street that would take her into the Canopic Way.  If she crossed that and went down the first turning to the left she would reach a large open square in the Bruchium, and there, in front of the Prefect's residence and by the side of the Bishop's house, stood the new statue of Theodosius.  This information, and the mention of the Bishop, gave a new course to her proceedings.  It was wrong to defy and desert her master, but to obey him would be deadly sin.  Which must she choose and which avoid?  Only one person could advise in such a case--only one could relieve her mind of its difficulties and terrors: The Shepherd of souls in the city--the Bishop himself.  She too was a lamb of his flock; to him and to no one else could she turn.  This thought fell on her heart like a ray of light dispersing the clouds of uncertainty and alarm.  With a deep breath of relief she took the child in her arms and told him--for he was whimpering to know where she was taking him, and why he might not go back to Dada--that they were going to see a good, kind man who would tell them the way home to their father and mother.  Papias, however, still wailed to go to Dada and not to the man.  Half insisting and half coaxing him with promises, she dragged him along as far as the main street.  This was full of an excited throng; soldiers on foot and on horseback were doing what they could to keep the peace, and the bustle amused the little boy's curiosity so that he soon forgot his homesickness.  When, at length, Ague found the street that led to the Prefect's house she was fairly carried along by the surging, rushing mob. To turn was quite impossible; the utmost she could do was to keep her wits about her, and concentrate her strength so as not to be parted from the child.  Pushed, pulled, squeezed, scolded, and abused by other women for her folly in bringing a child out into such a crowd, she at last found herself in the great square.  A hideous hubbub of coarse, loud voices pierced her unaccustomed ears; she could have sunk on the earth and cried; but she kept up her courage and collected all her energies, for she saw in the distance a large gilt cross over a lofty doorway.  It was like a greeting and welcome home.  Under its protection she would certainly, find rest, consolation and safety.  But how was she to reach it?  The space before her was packed with men as a quiver is packed with arrows; there was not room for a pin between. The only chance of getting forward was by forcing her way, and nine- tenths of the crowd were men--angry and storming men, whose wild and strange demeanor filled her with terror and disgust.  Most of them were monks who had flocked in at the Bishop's appeal from the monasteries of the desert, or from the Lauras and hermitages of Kolzum by the Red Sea, or even from Tabenna in Upper Egypt, and whose hoarse voices rent the air with vehement cries of: \"Down with the idols!  Down with Serapis!  Death to the heathen!\"  This army of the Saviour whose very essence was gentleness and whose spirit was love, seemed indeed to have deserted from his standard of light and grace to the blood-stained banner of murderous hatred.  Their matted locks and beards fringed savage faces with glowing eyes; their haggard or paunchy nakedness was scarcely covered by undressed hides of sheep and goats; their parched skins were scarred and striped by the use of the scourges that hung at their girdles.  One--a \"crown bearer\"--had a face streaming with blood, from the crown of thorns which he had vowed to wear day and night in memory and imitation of the Redeemer's sufferings, and which on this great occasion he pressed hard into the flesh with ostentatious martyrdom.  One, who, in his monastery, had earned the name of the \"oil-jar,\" supported himself on his neighbors' arms, for his emaciated legs could hardly carry his dropsical carcass which, for the last ten years, he had fed exclusively on gourds, snails, locusts and Nile water.  Another was chained inseparably to a comrade, and the couple dwelt together in a cave in the limestone hills near Lycopolis.  These two had vowed never to let each other sleep, that so their time for repentance might be doubled, and their bliss in the next world enhanced in proportion to their mortifications in this.  One and all, they were allies in a great fight, and the same hopes, ideas, and wishes fired them all.  The Abominable Thing--which imperilled hundreds of thousands of souls, which invited Satan to assert his dominion in this world--should fall this day and be annihilated forever! To them the whole heathen world was the \"great whore;\" and though the gems she wore were beautiful to see and rejoiced the mind and heart of fools, they must be snatched from her painted brow; they would scourge her from off the face of the redeemed earth and destroy the seducer of souls forever.  \"Down with the idols!  Down with Serapis!  Down with the heathen!\"  Their shouts thundered and bellowed all about Agne; but, just as the uproar and crush were at the worst, a tall and majestic figure appeared on a balcony above the cross and extended his hand in calm and dignified benediction towards the seething mass of humanity.  As he raised it all present, including Ague, bowed and bent the knee.  Agne felt, knew, that this stately man was the Bishop whom she sought, but she did not point him out to her little brother, for his aspect was that of some proud sovereign rather than of \"the good, kind man\" of whom she had dreamed.  She could never dare to force her way into the presence of this great lord!  How should the ruler over a million souls find time or patience for her and her trivial griefs?  However, there must be within his"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5503"],["title","Serapis — Volume 03 (#5)"],["body","sundry presbyters and deacons, and she would address herself to one of them, as soon as the crowd had dispersed enough for her to make her way to the door beneath the cross. Twenty times at least did she renew her efforts, but she made very small progress; most of the monks, as she tried to squeeze past them, roughly pushed her back; one, on whose arm she ventured to lay her hand, begging him to make way for her, broke out into shrieks as though a serpent had stung him, and when the crush brought her into contact with the crown- bearer he  thrust  her  away  exclaiming:  \"Away woman!  Do not touch me, spawn of Satan tool of the evil one! or I will tread you under foot!\"  Retreat had been as impossible as progress, and long hours went by which to her seemed like days; still she felt no fatigue, only alarm and disgust, and, more than anything else, an ardent desire to reach the Bishop's palace and take counsel of a priest.  It was long past noon when a diversion took place which served at any rate to interest and amuse the crying child.  On the platform above the doorway Cynegius came forth--Cynegius, the Emperor's delegate; a stout man of middle height, with a shrewd round head and a lawyer's face.  State dignitaries, Consuls and Prefects had, at this date, ceased to wear the costume that had marked the patricians of old Rome--a woollen toga that fell in broad and dignified folds from the shoulders; a long, close-fitting robe had taken its place, of purple silk brocade with gold flowers.  On the envoy's shoulder blazed the badge of the highest officials, a cruciform ornament of a peculiarly thick and costly tissue.  He greeted the crowd with a condescending bow, a herald blew three blasts on the tuba, and then Cynegius, with a wave of his hand introduced his private secretary who stood by his side, and who at once opened a roll he held and shouted at the top of a ringing voice:  \"Silence in Caesar's name!\"  The trumpet then sounded for the fourth time, and silence so complete fell on the crowded square that the horses of the mounted guard in front of the Prefect's house could be heard snorting and champing.  \"In Caesar's name,\" repeated the official, who had been selected for the duty of reading the Imperial message.  Cynegius himself bent his head, again waved his hand towards his secretary, and then towards the statues of the Emperor and Empress which, mounted on gilt standards, were displayed to the populace on each side of the balcony; then the reading began:  \"Theodosius Caesar greets the inhabitants of the great and noble city of Alexandria, by Cynegius, his faithful ambassador and servant.  He knows that its true and honest citizens confess the Holy Faith in all piety and steadfastness, as delivered to believers in the beginning by Peter, the prince of the Apostles; he knows that they hold the true Christian faith, and abide by the doctrine delivered by the Holy Ghost to the Fathers of the Church in council at Nicaea.  \"Theodosius Caesar who, in all humility and pride, claims to be the sword and shield, the champion and the rampart of the one true faith, congratulates his subjects of the great and noble city of Alexandria inasmuch as that most of them have turned from the devilish heresy of Arius, and have confessed the true Nicaean creed; and he announces to them, by his faithful and noble servant Cynegius, that this faith and no other shall be recognized in Alexandria, as throughout his dominions.  \"In Egypt, as in all his lands and provinces, every doctrine opposed to this precious creed shall be persecuted, and all who confess, preach or diffuse any other doctrine shall be considered heretics and treated as such.\"  The secretary paused, for loud and repeated shouts of joy broke from the multitude.  Not a dissentient word was heard-indeed, the man who should have dared to utter one would certainly not have escaped unpunished.  It was not till the herald had several times blown a warning blast that the reader could proceed, as follows:  \"It has come to the ears of your Caesar, to the deep grieving of his Christian soul, that the ancient idolatry, which so long smote mankind with blindness and kept them wandering far from the gates of Paradise, still, through the power of the devil, has some temples and altars in your great and noble city.  But because it is grievous to the Christian and clement heart of the Emperor to avenge the persecutions and death which so many holy martyrs have endured at the hands of the bloodthirsty and cruel heathen on their posterity, or on the miscreant and-- misbelieving enemies of our holy faith--and because the Lord hath said 'vengeance is mine'--Theodosius Caesar only decrees that the temples of the heathen idols in this great and noble city of Alexandria shall be closed, their images destroyed and their altars overthrown.  Whosoever shall defile himself with blood, or slay an innocent beast for sacrifice, or enter a heathen temple, or perform any religious ceremony therein, or worship any image of a god made by hands-nay, or pray in any temple in the country or in the city, shall be at once required to pay a fine of fifteen pounds of gold; and whosoever shall know of such a crime being committed without giving information of it, shall be fined to the same amount.\"--[Codex Theodosianus XVI, 10, 10.]  The last words were spoken to the winds, for a shout of triumph, louder and wilder than had ever before been heard even on this favorite meeting- place of the populace, rent the very skies.  Nor did it cease, nor yield to any trumpet-blast, but rolled on in spreading waves down every street and alley; it reached the ships in the port, and rang through the halls of the rich and the hovels of the poor; it even found a dull echo in the light-house at the point of Pharos, where the watchman was trimming the lamp for the night; and in an incredibly short time all Alexandria knew that Caesar had dealt a death-blow to the worship of the heathen gods.  The great and fateful rumor was heard, too, in the Museum and the Serapeum; once more the youth who had grown up in the high schools of the city, studying the wisdom of the heathen, gathered together; men who had refined and purified their intellect at the spring of Greek philosophy and fired their spirit with enthusiasm for all that was good and lovely in the teaching of ancient Greece--these obeyed the summons of their master, Olympius, or flew to arms under the leadership of Orestes, the Governor, for the High-Priest himself had to see to the defences of the Serapeum.--Olympius had weapons ready in abundance, and the youths rapidly collected round the standards he had prepared, and rushed into the square before the Prefect's house to drive away the monks and to insist that Cynegius should return forthwith to Rome with the Emperor's edict.  Young and noble lads were they who marched forth to the struggle, equipped like the Helleman soldiers of the palmy days of Athens; and as they went they sang a battle-song of Callinus which some one--who, no one could tell--had slightly altered for the occasion:                \"Come, rouse ye Greeks; what, sleeping still!                Is courage dead, is shame unknown?                Start up, rush forth with zealous will,                And smite the mocking Christians down!\"  Everything that opposed their progress was overthrown.  Two maniples of foot-soldiers who held the high-road across the Bruchium attempted to turn them, but the advance of the inflamed young warriors was irresistible and they reached the street of the Caesareum and the square in front of the Prefect's residence.  Here they paused to sing the last lines of their battlesong:                \"Fate seeks the coward out at home,                He dies unwept, unknown to fame,                While by the hero's honored tomb                Our grandsons' grandsons sliall proclaim:               'In the great conflict's fiercest hour                He stood unmoved, our shield and tower.'\"  It was here, at the wide opening into the square, that the collision took place: on one side the handsome youths, crowned with garlands, with their noble Greek type of heads, thoughtful brows, perfumed curls, and anointed limbs exercised in the gymnasium--on the other the sinister fanatics in sheep-skin, ascetic visionaries grown grey in fasting, scourging, and self-denial.  The monks now prepared to meet the onset of the young enthusiasts who were fighting for freedom of thought and enquiry, for Art and Beauty. Each side was defending what it felt to be the highest Good, each was equally in earnest as to its convictions, both fought for something dearer and more precious than this earthly span of existence.  But the philosophers' party had swords; the monks' sole weapon was the scourge, and they were accustomed to ply that, not on each other but on their own rebellious flesh.  A wild and disorderly struggle began with swingeing blows on both sides; prayers and psalms mingling with the battle-song of the heathen.  Here a monk fell wounded, there one lay dead, there again lay a fine and delicate-looking youth, felled by the heavy fist of a recluse.  A hermit wrestled hand to hand with a young philosopher who, only yesterday had delivered his first lecture on the Neo-Platonism of Plotinus to an interested audience.  And in the midst of this mad struggle stood Agne with her little brother, who clung closely to her skirts and was too terrified to shed a tear or utter a cry.  The girl was resolutely calm, but she was too utterly terror-stricken even to pray.  Fear, absorbing fear had stunned her thoughts; it overmastered her like some acute physical pain which began in her heart and penetrated every fibre of her frame.  Even while the Imperial message was being read she had been too frightened to take it all in; and now she simply shut her eyes tight and hardly understood what was going on around her, till a new and different noise sounded"]]]
