It cannot be so much amiss after all that you should cling to the creed of your parents. What is your name?\"  \"Agne.\"  \"Agne, or the lamb.  A pretty, good name!  It is a name I love, as I, too, am a shepherd, though but a very humble one, so trust yourself to me, little lamb.  Tell me, why are you crying?  And whom do you seek here?  And how is it that you do not know where to find a home?\"  Eusebius spoke with such homely kindness, and his voice was so full of fatherly sympathy that hope revived in Agne's breast, and she told him with frank confidence all he wanted to know.  The old man listened with many a \"Hum\" and \"Ha\"--then he bid her accompany him to his own house, where his wife would find a corner that she might fill.  She gladly agreed, and thanked him eagerly when he also told the doorkeeper to bring Papias after them if he should be found.  Relieved of the worst of her griefs, Agne followed her new friend through the streets and lanes, till they paused at the gate of a small garden and he said: \"Here we are.  What we have we give gladly, but it is little, very little.  Indeed, who can bear to live in luxury when so many are perishing in want and misery?\"  As they went across the plot, between the little flower-beds, the deacon pointed to a tree and said with some pride: \"Last year that tree bore me three hundred and seven peaches, and it is still healthy and productive.\"  A hospitable light twinkled in the little house at the end of the garden, and as they entered a queer-looking dog came out to meet his master, barking his welcome.  He jumped with considerable agility on his fore- legs, but his hind legs were paralyzed and his body sloped away and stuck up in the air as though it were attached to an invisible board.  \"This is my good friend Lazarus,\" said the old man cheerfully. \"I found the poor beggar in the road one day, and as he was one of God's creatures, although he is a cripple, I comfort myself with the verse from the Psalms: 'The Lord has no joy in the strength of a horse, neither taketh he pleasure in any man's legs.'\"  He was so evidently content and merry that Agne could not help laughing too, and when, in a few minutes, the deacon's wife gave her a warm and motherly reception she would have been happier than she had been for a long time past, if only her little brother had not been a weight on her mind and if she had not longed so sadly to have him safe by her side. But even that anxiety presently found relief, for she was so weary and exhausted that, after eating a few mouthfuls, she was thankful to lie down in the clean bed that Elizabeth had prepared for her, and she instantly fell asleep.  She was in the old deacon's bed, and he made ready to pass the night on the couch in his little sitting-room.  As soon as the old couple were alone Eusebius told his wife how and where he had met the girl and ended by saying:  \"It is a puzzling question as to these Arians and other Christian heretics.  I cannot be hard on them so long as they cling faithfully to the One Lord who is necessary to all.  If we are in the right--and I firmly believe that we are--and the Son is of one substance of the Father, he is without spot or blemish; and what can be more divine than to overlook the error of another if it concerns ourselves, or what more meanly human than to take such an error amiss and indulge in a cruel or sanguinary revenge on the erring soul?  Do not misunderstand me. I, unfortunately--or rather, I say, thank God!--I have done nothing great here on earth, and have never risen to be anything more than a deacon. But if a boy comes up to me and mistakes me for an acolyte or something of that kind, is that a reason why I should flout or punish him?  Not a bit of it.  \"And to my belief our Saviour is too purely divine to hate those who regard Him as only 'God-like.'  He is Love.  And when Arius goes to Heaven and sees Jesus Christ in all His divine glory, and falls down before Him in an ecstasy of joy and repentance, the worst the Lord will do to him will be to take him by the ear and say: 'Thou fool!  Now thou seest what I really am; but thine errors be forgiven!'\"  Elizabeth nodded assent.  \"Amen,\" she said, \"so be it.--And so, no doubt, it will be.  Did the Lord cast out the woman taken in adultery?  Did he not give us the parable of the Samaritan?--Poor little girl!  We have often wished for a daughter and now we have found one; a pretty creature she is too.  God grants us all our wishes!  But you must be tired, old man; go to rest now.\"  \"Directly, directly,\" said Eusebius; but then, striking his forehead with his hand, he went on in much annoyance: \"And with all this tumult and worry I had quite forgotten the most important thing of all: Marcus!  He is like a possessed creature, and if I do not make a successful appeal to his conscience before he sleeps this night mischief will come of it. Yes, I am very tired; but duty before rest.  It is of no use to contradict me, Mother.  Get me my cloak; I must go to the lad.\"  And a few minutes later the old man was making his way to the house in the Canopic street.     CHAPTER XV.  Dread and anxiety had taken possession of the merchant's household after Constantine had left them.  Messengers came hurrying in, one after another, to request the presence of Olympius.  A heathen secretary of Evagrius the Governor, had revealed what was astir, and the philosopher had at once prepared to return to the Serapeum.  Porphyrius himself ordered his closed harmamaxa to be brought out, and undertook to fetch weapons and standards to the temple from a storehouse where they were laid by.  This building stood on a plot of ground belonging to him in Rhacotis, behind a timber-yard which was accessible from the streets in front and behind, but sheltered from the public gaze by sheds and wood- stacks.  The old aqueduct, which supplied the courts of sacrifice and the Subterranean crypts of the temple where the mysteries of Serapis were celebrated, passed close by the back-wall of this warehouse.  Since the destruction of the watercourse, under the Emperor Julian, the underground conduit had been dry and empty, and a man by slightly stooping could readily pass through it unseen into the Serapeum.  This mysterious passage had lately been secretly cleared out, and it was now to be used for the transport of the arms to the temple precincts.  Damia had been present at the brief but vehement interview between her son and Olympius, and had thrown in a word now and again: \"It is serious, very serious!\" or, \"Fight it out--no quarter!\"  The parting was evidently a very painful one to Olympius; when the merchant held out both his hands the older man clasped them in his and held them to his breast, saying: \"Thanks, my friend; thanks for all you have done.  We have lived--and if now we perish it is for the future happiness of our grandchildren.  What would life be to you and me if it were marred by scourgings and questionings?--The omens read ill, and if I am not completely deceived we are at the beginning of the end.  What lies beyond...!  we as philosophers must meet it calmly.  The supreme Mind that governs us has planned the universe so well, that it is not likely that those things of which we now have no knowledge should not also be ordered for the best.  The pinions of my soul beat indeed more freely and lightly as I foresee the moment when it shall be released from the burden of this flesh!\"  The High-Priest raised his arms as though indeed he were prepared to soar and uttered a fervent and inspired prayer in which he rehearsed to the gods all that he and his had done in their honor and vowed to offer them fresh sacrifices.  His expressions were so lofty, and his flow of language so beautiful and free, that Porphyrius did not dare to interrupt him, though this long delay on the part of the leader of the cause made him intolerably anxious.  When the old man--who was as emotional as a boy--ceased speaking, his white beard was wet with tears, and seeing that even Damia's and Gorgo's eyes were moist, he was preparing to address them again; but Porphyrius interposed.  He gave him time only to press his lips to Datnia's hand and to bid Gorgo farewell.  \"You were born into stirring times,\" he said to her, \"but under a good sign.  Two worlds are in collision; which shall survive?--For you, my darling, I have but one wish: May you be happy!\"  He left the room and the merchant paced up and down lost in gloomy thoughts.  Presently, as he caught his mother's eye fixed uneasily upon him, he murmured, less to her than to himself: \"If he can think thus of what the end will be, who can still dare to hope?\"  Damia drew herself up in her chair.  \"I,\" she exclaimed passionately, \"I--I dare, and I do hope and trust in the future.  Is everything to perish which our forefathers planned and founded?  Is this dismal superstition to overwhelm and bury the world and all that is bright and beautiful, as the lava stream rolled over the cities of Vesuvius?  No, a thousand times no!  Our retrograde and cowardly generation, which has lost all heart to enjoy life in sheer dread of future annihilation, may perhaps be doomed by the gods, as was that of Deucalion's day.  Well--if so, what must be must!  But such a world as they dream of never can, never will last.  Let them succeed in their monstrous scheme! if the Temple of temples, the House of Serapis, were to be in ashes and the image of the mighty god to be dashed to pieces, what then...  I say what then?  Then indeed everything will be at an end--we, everybody; but they too, they, too, will perish.\"  She clenched her fist with hatred and revenge and went on: \"I know what I know--there are legible and infallible signs, and it is given to me to interpret them, and I tell you: It is true, unerringly true, as every Alexandrian"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5504"],["title","Serapis — Volume 04 (#0)"],["body","eBook was produced by David Widger <widger@cecomet.net>    [NOTE: There is a short list of bookmarks, or pointers, at the end of the file for those who may wish to sample the author's ideas before making an entire meal of them.  D.W.]      SERAPIS  By Georg Ebers  Volume 4.    CHAPTER XVI.  The day had flown swiftly for Dada under the roof of Medius; there were costumes and scenery in wonderful variety for her to look over; the children were bright and friendly, and she had enjoyed playing with them, for all her little tricks and rhymes, which Papias was familiar with by this time, were to them new and delightful.  It amused her, too, to see what the domestic difficulties were of which the singer had described himself as being a victim.  Medius was one of those men who buy everything that strikes them as cheap--for instance, that very morning, at Kibotus he had stood to watch a fish auction and had bought a whole tub-full of pickled fish for \"a mere trifle;\" but when, presently, the cargo was delivered, his wife flew into a great rage, which she vented first on the innocent lad who brought the fish, and then on the less innocent purchaser.  They would not get to the bottom of the barrel and eat the last herring, she asserted, till they were a century old.  Medius, while he disputed so monstrous a statement, vehemently declared that such wholesome and nutritious food as those fish was undoubtedly calculated to prolong the lives of the whole family to an exceptionally great age.  This discussion, which was not at all by way of a jest, amused Dada far more than the tablets, cylinders and cones covered with numbers and cabalistic signs, to which Medius tried to direct her attention. She darted off in the midst of his eager explanations to show his grandchildren how a rabbit sniffs and moves his ears when he is offered a cabbage-leaf.  The report, which reached them in the afternoon, of the proceedings in the square by the Prefect's house, disturbed Medius greatly, and he set off at once for the scene of action.  He did not return till evening, and then he looked like an altered man. He must have witnessed something very terrible, for his face was as pale as death, and his usually confident and swaggering manner had given place to a stricken and care-worn air.  He walked up and down the room, groaning as he went; he flung himself on the divan and stared fixedly at the ground; he wandered into the atrium and gazed cautiously out on the street.  Dada's presence seemed suddenly to be the source of much anxiety to him, and the girl, painfully conscious of this, hastened to tell him that she would prefer to return home at once to her uncle and aunt.  \"You can please yourself,\" was all he said, with a shrug and a sigh. \"You may stay for aught I care.  It is all the same now!\"  So far his wife had left him to himself, for she was used to his violent and eccentric behavior whenever anything had crossed him; but now she peremptorily desired to be informed what had happened to him and he at once acceded.  He had been unwilling to frighten them sooner than was needful, but they must learn it sooner or later: Cynegius had arrived to overthrow the image of Serapis, and what must ensue they knew only too well.  \"To-day,\" he cried, \"we will live; but by to-morrow--a thousand to one-by to-morrow there will be an end of all our joys and the earth will swallow up the old home and us with it!\"  His words fell on prepared ground; his wife and daughter were appalled, and as Medius went on to paint the imminent catastrophe in more vivid colors, his energy growing in proportion to its effect on them, they began at first to sob and whimper and then to wail loudly.  When the children, who by this time were in bed, heard the lamentations of their elders, they, too, set up a howl, and even Dada caught the infection. As for Medius himself, he had talked himself into such a state of terror by his own descriptions of the approaching destruction of the world that he abandoned all claim to his proud reputation as a strong-minded man, and quite forgot his favorite theory that everything that went by the name of God was a mere invention of priests and rulers to delude and oppress the ignorant; at last he even went so far as to mutter a, prayer, and when his wife begged to be allowed to join a family of neighbors in sacrificing a black lamb at daybreak, he recklessly gave her a handful of money.  None of the party closed an eye that night.  Dada could not bear to remain in the house.  Perhaps all these horrors existed only in Medius' fancy; but if destruction were indeed impending, she would a thousand times rattier perish with her own relations than with these people, in whom there was something--she did not know what--for which she felt a deep aversion.  This she explained to her host early in the day and he was ready to set out at once and restore her to the care of Karnis.  In fact, the purpose for which he had needed her must certainly come to nothing.  He himself was attached to the service of Posidonius, a great magician and wizard, to whom half Alexandria flocked--Christians, Jews, and heathens--in order to communicate with the dead, with gods and with demons, to obtain spells and charms by which to attract lovers or injure foes, to learn the art of becoming invisible, or to gain a glimpse into the future.  In the performance which was being planned Dada was to have appeared to a bereaved mother as the glorified presence of her lost daughter; but the disturbance in the city had driven the matron, who was rich, to take refuge in the country the previous afternoon.  Nor was it likely that the sorcerer's other clients--even if all turned out better than could be hoped--would venture into the streets by night.  Rich people were timid and suspicious; and as the Emperor had lately promulgated fresh and more stringent edicts against the magic arts, Posidonius had thought it prudent to postpone the meeting.  Hence Medius had at present no use for the girl; but he affected to agree so readily to her wishes merely out of anxiety to relieve Isarnis as soon as possible of his uneasiness as to her fate.  The morning was bright and hot, and the town was swarming with an excited mob soon after sunrise.  Terror, curiosity and defiance were painted on every face; however, Medius and his young companion made their way unhindered as far as the temple of Isis by the lake.  The doors of the sanctuary were closed, and guarded by soldiers; but the southern and western walls were surrounded by thousands and thousands of heathen. Some hundreds, indeed, had passed the night there in prayer, or in sheer terror of the catastrophe which could not fail to ensue, and they were kneeling in groups, groaning, weeping, and cursing, or squatting in stolid resignation, weary, crushed and hopeless.  It was a heart-rending sight, and neither Dada--who till this moment had been dreading Dame Herse's scolding tongue far more than the destruction of the world--nor her companion could forbear joining in the wail that rose from this vast multitude.  Medius fell on his knees groaning aloud and pulled the girl down beside him; for, upon the wall that enclosed the temple precincts, they now saw a priest who, after holding the sacred Sistrum up to view and muttering some unintelligible prayers and invocations, proceeded to address the people.  He was a short stout man, and the sweat streamed down his face as he stood under the blazing sun to sketch a fearful picture of the monstrous doom which was hanging over the city and its inhabitants.  He spoke with pompous exaggeration, in a shrill, harsh voice, wiping his face meanwhile with his white linen robe or gasping for air, when breath failed him, like a fish stranded on the beach.  All this, however, did not trouble his audience, for the hatred that inspired his language, and the terror of the immediate future which betrayed itself in every word exactly reflected their feelings.  Dada alone was moved to mirth; the longer she looked at him the more she felt inclined to laugh; besides, the day was so bright--a pigeon on the wall pattered round his mate, nodding and wriggling after the funny manner of pigeons in love--and, above all, her heart beat so high and she had such a happy instinctive feeling that all was ordered for the best, that the world seemed to her a beautiful and fairly secure dwelling-place, in spite of the dark forebodings of the zealous preacher.  On the eve of destruction the earth must surely look differently from this; and it struck her as highly improbable that the gods should have revealed their purpose to such a queer old driveller as this priest, and have hidden it from other men.  The very fact that this burly personage should prophesy evil with such conviction made her doubt it; and presently, when the plumes of three or four helmets became visible behind the speaker, and a pair of strong hands grasped his thick ancles and suddenly dragged him down from his eminence and back into the temple, she could hardly keep herself from laughing outright.  Now, however, there was more real cause for alarm a trumpet-blast was heard, and a maniple of the twenty-second legion marched down in close order on the crowd who fled before them.  Medius was one of the first to make off; Dada kept close to his side, and when, in his alarm, he fairly took to his heels, she did the same; for, in spite of the reception she apprehended, she felt that the sooner she could rejoin her own people the better.  Never till now had she known how dear they were to her.  Herse might scold; but her sharpest words were truer and better than the smooth flattery of Medius.  It was a joy to think of seeing them again--Agne, too, and little Papias--and she felt as though she were about to meet them after years of separation.  By this time they were at the ship-yard, which was divided only by a lane from the Temple-grove; there lay the barge.  Dada"]]]
