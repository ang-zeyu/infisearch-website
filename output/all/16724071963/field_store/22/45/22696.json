Still, take this ring.  It has never left my finger since I quitted Egypt, and it has a significance far beyond its outward worth. Pythagoras, the noblest of the Greeks, gave it to my mother, when he was tarrying in Egypt to learn the wisdom of our priests, and it was her parting gift to me.  The number seven is engraved upon the simple stone. This indivisible number represents perfect health, both to soul and body for health is likewise one and indivisible.       [Seven, the \"motherless\" number, which has no factor below ten.]  The sickness of one member is the sickness of all; one evil thought, allowed to take up its abode within our heart, destroys the entire harmony of the soul.  When you see this seven therefore, let it recall my heart's wish that you may ever enjoy undisturbed bodily health, and long retain that loving gentleness which has made you the most virtuous, and therefore the healthiest of men.  No thanks, my father, for even if I could restore to Croesus all the treasures that he once possessed, I should still retrain his debtor.  Gyges, to you I give this Lydian lyre; let its tones recall the giver to your memory.  For you, Zopyrus, I have a golden chain; I have witnessed that you are the most faithful of friends; and we Egyptians are accustomed to place cords and bands in the hands of our lovely Hathor, the goddess of love and friendship, as symbols of her captivating and enchaining attributes.  As Darius has studied the wisdom of Egypt and the signs of the starry heavens, I beg him to take this circlet of gold, on which a skilful hand has traced the signs of the Zodiac.       [Diodorus (I. 49.) tells, that in the tomb of Osymandyas (palace of      Rameses II. at Thebes) there lay a circle of gold, one ell thick and      365 ells in circumference, containing a complete astronomical      calendar.  The circle of the zodiac from Dendera, which is now in      Paris,--an astronomical ceiling painting, which was believed at the      time of its discovery to be of great age, is not nearly so ancient      as was supposed, dating only from the end of the Ptolemaic dynasty.      Letronne was the first to estimate it correctly.  See Lepsius,      Chron.  p.63. and Lauth, 'les zodiaques de Dendera'.  Munich 1865.]  And lastly, to my dear brother-in-law Bartja I commit the most precious jewel in my possession--this amulet of blue stone.  My sister Tachot hung it round my neck as I kissed her on the last night before we parted; she told me it could bring to its wearer the sweet bliss of love.  And then, Bartja, she wept!  I do not know of whom she was thinking in that moment, but I hope I am acting according to her wishes in giving you her precious jewel.  Take it as a gift from Tachot, and sometimes call to mind our games in the Sais gardens.\"  Thus far she had been speaking Greek, but now, addressing the attendants who remained standing in an attitude of deep reverence, she began in broken Persian:  \"Accept my thanks also.  In Babylon you shall receive a thousand gold staters.\"  Then turning to Boges, she added: \"Let this sum be distributed among the attendants at latest by the day after to-morrow. Take me to my carriage, Croesus.\"  The old king hastened to do her bidding, and as he was leading her thither she pressed his arm and whispered gently, \"Are you pleased with me, my father?\"  \"I tell you, girl,\" the old man answered, \"that no one but the king's mother can ever be your equal at this court, for a true and queenly pride reigns on your brow, and you have the power of using small means to effect great ends.  Believe me, the smallest gift, chosen and bestowed as you can choose and bestow, gives more pleasure to a noble mind than heaps of treasure merely cast down at his feet.  The Persians are accustomed to present and receive costly gifts.  They understand already how to enrich their friends, but you can teach them to impart a joy with every gift. How beautiful you are to-day!  Are your cushions to your mind, or would you like a higher seat?  But what is that?  There are clouds of dust in the direction of the city.  Cambyses is surely coming to meet you! Courage, my daughter.  Above all try to meet his gaze and respond to it. Very few can bear the lightning glance of those eyes, but, if you can return it freely and fearlessly, you have conquered.  Fear nothing, my child, and may Aphrodite adorn you with her most glorious beauty!  My friends, we must start, I think the king himself is coming.\"  Nitetis sat erect in her splendid, gilded carriage; her hands were pressed on her throbbing heart.  The clouds of dust came nearer and nearer, her eye caught the flash of weapons like lightning across a stormy sky.  The clouds parted, she could see single figures for a moment, but soon lost them as the road wound behind some thickets and shrubs.  Suddenly the troop of horsemen appeared in full gallop only a hundred paces before her, and distinctly visible.  Her first impression was of a motley mass of steeds and men, glittering in purple, gold, silver and jewels.  It consisted in reality of a troop of more than two hundred horsemen mounted on pure white Nicaean horses, whose bridles and saddle-cloths were covered with bells and bosses, feathers, fringes, and embroidery.  Their leader rode a powerful coal- black charger, which even the strong will and hand of his rider could not always curb, though in the end his enormous strength proved him the man to tame even this fiery animal.  This rider, beneath whose weight the powerful steed trembled and panted, wore a vesture of scarlet and white, thickly embroidered with eagles and falcons in silver.       [Curtius III. 3.  Xenoph.  Cyrap, VIII. 3. 7.  Aeschylus, Persians      835. 836.  The king's dress and ornaments were worth 12,000 talents,      or L2,250,000 (estimate of 1880) according to Plutarch, Artaxerxes      24.]  The lower part of his dress was purple, and his boots of yellow leather. He wore a golden girdle; in this hung a short dagger-like sword, the hilt and scabbard of which were thickly studded with jewels.  The remaining ornaments of his dress resembled those we have described as worn by Bartja, and the blue and white fillet of the Achaemenidae was bound around the tiara, which surmounted a mass of thick curls, black as ebony. The lower part of his face was concealed by an immense beard.  His features were pale and immovable, but the eyes, (more intensely black, if possible, than either hair or beard), glowed with a fire that was rather scorching than warming.  A deep, fiery-red scar, given by the sword of a Massagetan warrior, crossed his high forehead, arched nose and thin upper lip.  His whole demeanor expressed great power and unbounded pride.  Nitetis' gaze was at once riveted by this man.  She had never seen any one like him before, and he exercised a strange fascination over her. The expression of indomitable pride, worn by his features, seemed to her to represent a manly nature which the whole world, but she herself above all others, was created to serve.  She felt afraid, and yet her true woman's heart longed to lean upon his strength as the vine upon the elm. She could not be quite sure whether she had thus pictured to herself the father of all evil, the fearful Seth, or the great god Ammon, the giver of light.  The deepest pallor and the brightest color flitted by turns across her lovely face, like the light and shadow when clouds pass swiftly over a sunny noonday sky.  She had quite forgotten the advice of her fatherly old friend, and yet, when Cambyses brought his unruly, chafing steed to a stand by the side of her carriage, she gazed breathless into the fiery eyes of this man and felt at once that he was the king, though no one had told her so.  The stern face of this ruler of half the known world relaxed, as Nitetis, moved by an unaccountable impulse, continued to bear his piercing gaze. At last he waved his hand to her in token of welcome, and then rode on to her escort, who had alighted from their horses and were awaiting him, some having cast themselves down in the dust, and others, after the Persian manner, standing in an attitude of deep reverence, their hands concealed in the wide sleeves of their robes.  He sprang from his horse, an example which was followed at once by his entire suite.  The attendants, with the speed of thought, spread a rich purple carpet on the highway, lest the foot of the king should come in contact with the dust of the earth, and then Cambyses proceeded to salute his friends and relations by offering them his mouth to kiss.  He shook Croesus by the right hand, commanding him to remount and accompany him to the carriage, as interpreter between himself and Nitetis.  In an instant his highest office-bearers were at hand to lift the king once more on to his horse, and at a single nod from their lord, the train was again in motion.  Cambyses and Croesus rode by the side of the carriage.  \"She is beautiful, and pleases me well,\" began the king.  \"Interpret faithfully all her answers, for I understand only the Persian, Assyrian and Median tongues.\"  Nitetis caught and understood these words.  A feeling of intense joy stole into her heart, and before Croesus could answer, she began softly in broken Persian and blushing deeply: \"Blessed be the gods, who have caused me to find favor in thine eyes.  I am not ignorant of the speech of my lord, for the noble Croesus has instructed me in the Persian language during our long journey.  Forgive, if my sentences be broken and imperfect; the time was short, and my capacity only that of a poor and simple maiden.\"       [Diodorus tells us that Themistocles learnt the Persian language      during the journey to Susa.  We are not, therefore, requiring an      impossibility of "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5453"],["title","An Egyptian Princess — Volume 04 (#5)"],["body","Nitetis.]  A smile passed over the usually serious mouth of Cambyses.  His vanity was flattered by Nitetis' desire to win his approbation, and, accustomed as he was to see women grow up in idleness and ignorance, thinking of nothing but finery and intrigue, her persevering industry seemed to him both wonderful and praise worthy.  So he answered with evident satisfaction: \"I rejoice that we can speak without an interpreter. Persevere in learning the beautiful language of my forefathers.  Croesus, who sits at my table, shall still remain your instructor.\"  \"Your command confers happiness!\"  exclaimed the old man.  \"No more eager or thankful pupil could be found, than the daughter of Amasis.\"  \"She justifies the ancient report of the wisdom of Egypt,\" answered the king, \"and I can believe that she will quickly understand and receive into her soul the religious instructions of our Magi.\"  Nitetis dropped her earnest gaze.  Her fears were being realized.  She would be compelled to serve strange gods.  But her emotion passed unnoticed by Cambyses, who went on speaking: \"My mother Kassandane will tell you the duties expected from my wives.  To- morrow I myself will lead you to her.  The words, which you innocently chanced to hear, I now repeat; you please me well.  Do nothing to alienate my affection.  We will try to make our country agreeable, and, as your friend, I counsel you to treat Boges whom I sent as my forerunner, in a kind and friendly manner.  As head over the house of the women, you will have to conform to his will in many things.\"  \"Though he be head over the house of the women,\" answered Nitetis, \"surely your wife is bound to obey no other earthly will than yours. Your slightest look shall be for me a command; but remember that I am a king's daughter, that in my native land the weaker and the stronger sex have equal rights, and that the same pride reigns in my breast, which I see kindling in your eyes, my lord and king!  My obedience to you, my husband and my ruler, shall be that of a slave, but I can never stoop to sue for the favor, or obey the orders of a venal servant, the most unmanly of his kind!\"  Cambyses' wonder and satisfaction increased.  He had never heard any woman speak in this way before, except his mother; the clever way in which Nitetis acknowledged, and laid stress on, his right to command her every act, was very flattering to his self-love, and her pride found an echo in his own haughty disposition.  He nodded approvingly and answered: \"You have spoken well.  A separate dwelling shall be appointed you. I, and no one else, will prescribe your rules of life and conduct.  This day the pleasant palace on the hanging-gardens shall be prepared for your reception.\"  \"A thousand, thousand thanks,\" cried Nitetis.  \"You little know the blessing you are bestowing in this permission.  Again and again I have begged your brother Bartja to repeat the story of these gardens, and the love of the king who raised that verdant and blooming hill, pleased us better than all the other glories of your vast domains.\"  \"To-morrow,\" answered the king, \"you can enter your new abode.  But tell me now how my messengers pleased you and your countrymen.\"  \"How can you ask?  Who could know the noble Croesus without loving him? Who could fail to admire the beauty of the young heroes, your friends? They have all become dear to us, but your handsome brother Bartja especially, won all hearts.  The Egyptians have no love for strangers, and yet the gaping crowd would burst into a murmur of admiration, when his beautiful face appeared among them.\"  At these words the king's brow darkened; he struck his horse so sharply that the creature reared, and then turning it quickly round he gallopped to the front and soon reached the walls of Babylon.                      ...........................  Though Nitetis had been brought up among the huge temples and palaces of Egypt, she was still astonished at the size and grandeur of this gigantic city.  Its walls seemed impregnable; they measured more than seventy-five feet --[Fifty ells.  The Greek ell is equal to one foot and a half English.]-- in height and their breadth was so great, that two chariots could conveniently drive abreast upon them.  These mighty defences were crowned and strengthened by two hundred and fifty high towers, and even these would have been insufficient, if Babylon had not been protected on one side by impassable morasses.  The gigantic city lay on both shores of the Euphrates.  It was more than forty miles in circumference, and its walls enclosed buildings surpassing in size and grandeur even the Pyramids and the temples of Thebes.       [These numbers and measurements are taken partly from Herodotus,      partly from Diodorus, Strabo and Arrian.  And even the ruins of this      giant city, writes Lavard, are such as to allow a very fair      conclusion of its enormous size.  Aristotle (Polit. III.  I.) says      Babylon's dimensions were not those of a city, but of a nation.]  The mighty gates of brass, through which the royal train entered the city, had opened wide to receive this noble company.  This entrance was defended on each side by a strong tower, and before each of these towers lay, as warder, a gigantic winged bull carved in stone, with a human head, bearded and solemn.  Nitetis gazed at these gates in astonishment, and then a joyful smile lighted up her face, as she looked up the long broad street so brightly and beautifully decorated to welcome her.  The moment they beheld the king and the gilded carriage, the multitude burst into loud shouts of joy, but when Bartja, the people's darling, came in sight, the shouts rose to thunder-peals and shrieks of delight, which seemed as if they would never end.  It was long since the populace had seen Cambyses, for in accordance with Median customs the king seldom appeared in public.  Like the Deity, he was to govern invisibly, and his occasional appearance before the nation to be looked upon as a festival and occasion of rejoicing.  Thus all Babylon had come out to-day to look upon their awful ruler and to welcome their favorite Bartja on his return.  The windows were crowded with eager, curious women, who threw flowers before the approaching train, or poured sweet perfumes from above as they passed by.  The pavement was thickly strewn with myrtle and palm branches, trees of different kinds had been placed before the house- doors, carpets and gay cloths hung from the windows, garlands of flowers were wreathed from house to house, fragrant odors of incense and sandal- wood perfumed the air, and the way was lined with thousands of gaping Babylonians dressed in white linen shirts, gaily-colored woollen petticoats and short cloaks, and carrying long staves headed with pomegranates, birds, or roses, of gold or silver.  The streets through which the procession moved were broad and straight, the houses on either side, built of brick, tall and handsome.  Towering above every thing else, and visible from all points, rose the gigantic temple of Bel.  Its colossal staircase, like a huge serpent, wound round and round the ever-diminishing series of stories composing the tower, until it reached the summit crowned by the sanctuary itself.       [This temple of Bel, which many consider may have been the tower of      Babel of Genesis XI., is mentioned by Herodotus I.  181. 182. 183.      Diodorus II. 8. 9.  (Ktesias), Strabo 738 and many other ancient      writers.  The people living in its neighborhood now call the ruins      Birs Nimrod, the castle of Nimrod.  In the text we have      reconstructed it as far as possible from the accounts of classical      writers.  The first story, which is still standing, in the midst of      a heap of ruins, is 260 feet high.  The walls surrounding the tower      are said to be still clearly recognizable, and were 4000 feet long      and 3000 broad. ]  The procession approached the royal palace.  This corresponded in its enormous size to the rest of the vast city.  The walls surrounding it were covered with gaily-colored and glazed representations of strange figures made up of human beings, birds, quadrupeds and fishes; hunting- scenes, battles and solemn processions.  By the side of the river towards the north, rose the hanging-gardens, and the smaller palace lay toward the east on the other bank of the Euphrates, connected with the larger one by the wondrous erection, a firm bridge of stone.  Our train passed on through the brazen gates of three of the walls surrounding the palace, and then halted.  Nitetis was lifted from her carriage by bearers; she was at last in her new home, and soon after in the apartments of the women's house assigned to her temporary use.  Cambyses, Bartja and their friends already known to us, were still standing in the gaily-carpeted court of the palace, surrounded by at least a hundred splendid dignitaries in magnificent dresses, when suddenly a sound of loud female voices was heard, and a lovely Persian girl richly dressed, her thick fair hair profusely wreathed with pearls, rushed into the court, pursued by several women older than herself.  She ran up to the group of men; Cambyses with a smile placed himself in her path, but the impetuous girl slipped adroitly past him, and in another moment was hanging on Bartja's neck, crying and laughing by turns.  The attendants in pursuit prostrated themselves at a respectful distance, but Cambyses, on seeing the caresses lavished by the young girl on her newly-returned brother, cried: \"For shame, Atossa!  remember that since you began to wear ear-rings you have ceased to be a child!       [Ear-rings were given to the Persian girls in their fifteenth year,      the marriageable age.  Vendid.  Farlard XIV. 66.  At this age too      boys as well as girls were obliged to wear the sacred cord, Kuctl or      Kosti as a girdle; and were only allowed to unloose it in the night.      The making of this cord is"]]]
