Virginia's eyes rested on Margaret Brice, who was seated at the head of the bed, smoothing the pillows The strength of Stephen's features were in hers, but not the ruggedness. Her features were large, indeed, yet stanch and softened. The widow, as if feeling Virginia's look upon her, glanced up from the Judge's face and smiled at her. The girl colored with pleasure, and again at the thought which she had had of the likeness between mother and son.  Still the Judge slept on, while they watched. And at length the thought of Clarence crossed Virginia's mind.  Why had he not returned? Perhaps he was in the office without. Whispering to her father, she stole out on tiptoe. The office was empty. Descending to the street, she was unable to gain any news of Clarence from Ned, who was becoming alarmed likewise.  Perplexed and troubled, she climbed the stairs again. No sound came from the Judge's room Perhaps Clarence would be back at any moment. Perhaps her father was in danger. She sat down to think,--her elbows on the desk in front of her, her chin in her hand, her eyes at the level of a line of books which stood on end.--Chitty's Pleadings, Blackstone, Greenleaf on Evidence. Absently; as a person whose mind is in trouble, she reached out and took one of them down and opened it. Across the flyleaf, in a high and bold hand, was written the name, Stephen Atterbury Brice.  It was his desk! She was sitting in his chair!  She dropped the book, and, rising abruptly, crossed quickly to the other side of the room. Then she turned, hesitatingly, and went back. This was his desk--his chair, in which he had worked so faithfully for the man who lay dying beyond the door. For him whom they all loved--whose last hours they were were to soothe. Wars and schisms may part our bodies, but stronger ties unite our souls. Through Silas Whipple, through his mother, Virginia knew that she was woven of one piece with Stephen Brice. In a thousand ways she was reminded, lest she drive it from her belief. She might marry another, and that would not matter.  She sank again into his chair, and gave herself over to the thoughts crowding in her heart. How the threads of his life ran next to hers, and crossed and recrossed them. The slave auction, her dance with him, the Fair, the meeting at Mr. Brinsmade's gate,--she knew them all. Her love and admiration for his mother. Her dreams of him--for she did dream of him. And now he had saved Clarence's life that she might marry her cousin. Was it true that she would marry Clarence? That seemed to her only a dream. It had never seemed real. Again she glanced at the signature in the book, as if fascinated by the very strength of it. She turned over a few pages of the book, \"Supposing the defendant's counsel essays to prove by means of--\" that was his writing again, a marginal, note. There were marginal notes on every page--even the last was covered with them, And then at the end, \"First reading, February, 1858. Second reading, July, 1858. Bought with some of money obtained by first article for M. D.\" That capacity for work, incomparable gift, was what she had always coveted the most. Again she rested her elbows on the desk and her chin on her hands, and sighed unconsciously.  She had not heard the step on the stair. She had not seen the door open. She did not know that any one wage in the room until she heard his voice, and then she thought that she was dreaming.  \"Miss Carvel!\"  \"Yes?\" Her head did not move. He took a step toward her.  \"Miss Carvel!\"  Slowly she raised her face to his, unbelief and wonder in her eyes, --unbelief and wonder and fright. No; it could not be he. But when she met the quality of his look, the grave tenderness of it, she trembled, and our rendered her own to the page where his handwriting quivered and became a blur.  He never knew the effort it cost her to rise and confront him. She herself had not measured or fathomed the power which his very person exhaled. It seemed to have come upon him suddenly. He needed not to have spoken for her to have felt that. What it was she could not tell. She knew alone that it was nigh irresistible, and she grasped the back of the chair as though material support might sustain her.  \"Is he--dead?\"  She was breathing hard.  \"No,\" she said. \"Not--not yet, They are waiting for the end.\"  \"And you?\" he asked in grave surprise, glancing at the door of the Judge's room.  Then she remembered Clarence.  \"I am waiting for my cousin,\" she said.  Even as she spoke she was with this man again at the Brinsmade gate. Those had been her very words! Intuition told her that he, too, was thinking of that time. Now he had found her at his desk, and, as if that were not humiliation enough, with one of his books taken down and laid open at his signature. Suffused, she groped for words to carry her on.  \"I am waiting for Clarence, Mr. Brice. He was here, and is gone somewhere.\"  He did not seem to take account of the speech. And his silence--goad to indiscretion--pressed her to add:-- \"You saved him, Mr. Brice. I--we all --thank you so much. And that is not all I want to say. It is a poor enough acknowledgment of what you did,--for we have not always treated you well.\" Her voice faltered almost to faintness, as he raised his hand in pained protest. But she continued: \"I shall regard it as a debt I can never repay. It is not likely that in my life to come I can ever help you, but I shall pray for that opportunity.\"  He interrupted her.  \"I did nothing, Miss Carvel, nothing that the most unfeeling man in our army would not do. Nothing that I would not have done for the merest stranger.\"  \"You saved him for me,\" she said.  O fateful words that spoke of themselves! She turned away from him for very shame, and yet she heard him saying:-- \"Yes, I saved him for you.\"  His voice was in the very note of the sadness which has the strength to suffer, to put aside the thought of self. A note to which her soul responded with anguish when she turned to him with the natural cry of woman.  \"Oh, you ought not to have come here to-night. Why did you come? The Doctor forbade it. The consequences may kill you.\"  \"It does not matter much,\" he answered. \"The Judge was dying.\"  \"How did you know?\"  \"I guessed it,--because my mother had left me.\"  \"Oh, you ought not to have come!\" she said again.  \"The Judge has been my benefactor,\" he answered quietly. I could walk, and it was my duty to come.\"  \"You did not walk!\" she gasped.  He smiled, \"I had no carriage,\" he said.  With the instinct of her sex she seized the chair and placed it under him. \"You must sit down at once,\" she cried.  \"But I am not tired,\" he replied.  \"Oh, you must sit down, you must, Captain Brice.\" He started at the title, which came so prettily from her lips, \"Won't you please!\" she said pleadingly.  He sat down. And, as the sun peeps out of a troubled sky, she smiled.  \"It is your chair,\" she said.  He glanced at the book, and the bit of sky was crimson. But still he said nothing.  \"It is your book,\" she stammered. \"I did not know that it was yours when I took it down. I--I was looking at it while I was waiting for Clarence.\"  \"It is dry reading,\" he remarked, which was not what he wished to say.  \"And yet--\"  \"Yes?\"  \"And yet you have read it twice.\" The confession had slipped to her lips.  She was sitting on the edge of his desk, looking down at him. Still he did not look at her. All the will that was left him averted his head. And the seal of honor was upon his speech. And he wondered if man were ever more tempted.  Then the evil spread its wings, and soared away into the night. And the moment was past. Peace seemed to come upon them both, quieting the tumult in their hearts, and giving them back their reason. Respect like wise came to the girl,--respect that was akin to awe. It was he who spoke first.  \"My mother has me how faithfully you nursed the Judge, Miss Carvel. It was a very noble thing to do.\"  \"Not noble at all,\" she replied hastily, \"your mother did the most of it, And he is an old friend of my father--\"  \"It was none the less noble,\" said Stephen, warmly, \"And he quarrelled with Colonel Carvel.\"  \"My father quarrelled with him,\" she corrected. \"It was well that I should make some atonement. And yet mine was no atonement, I love Judge Whipple. It was a--a privilege to see your mother every day--oh, how he would talk of you! I think he loves you better than any one on this earth.\"  \"Tell me about him,\" said Stephen, gently.  Virginia told him, and into the narrative she threw the whole of her pent-up self. How patient the Judge had been, and the joy he had derived from Stephen's letters. \"You were very good to write to him so often,\" she said. It seemed like a dream to Stephen, like one of the many dreams of her, the mystery of which was of the inner life beyond our ken. He could not recall a time when she had not been rebellious, antagonistic. And now--as he listened to her voice, with its exquisite low tones and modulations, as he sat there in this sacred intimacy, perchance to be the last in his life, he became dazed. His eyes, softened, with supreme eloquence cried out that she, was his, forever and forever. The magnetic force which God uses to tie the worlds together was pulling him to her. And yet the Puritan resisted.  Then the door swung open, and Clarence Colfax, out of breath, ran into the room. He stopped short when he saw them, his hand fell to his sides, and his words died on his lips. Virginia did not stir.  It was Stephen who rose to meet him, and with her eyes the girl followed his motions. The broad and loosely built frame of the Northerner, his shoulders slightly stooping, contrasted with Clarence's slighter figure, erect, compact, springy. The Southerner's eye, for that moment, was flint struck with the spark from the steel. Stephen's face, thinned by illness, was grave. The eyes kindly, yet penetrating. For an instant they stood thus regarding each other,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5395"],["title","The Crisis — Volume 08 (#0)"],["body","CRISIS  By Winston Churchill   Volume 8.    CHAPTER XII  THE LAST CARD  Mr. Brinsmade and the Doctor were the first to leave the little room where Silas Whipple had lived and worked and died, Mr. Brinsmade bent upon one of those errands which claimed him at all times. He took Shadrach with him. Virginia sat on, a vague fear haunting her,--a fear for her father's safety. Where was Clarence? What had he seen? Was the place watched? These questions, at first intruding upon her sorrow, remained to torture her.  Softly she stirred from the chair where she had sat before the piano, and opened the door of the outer office. A clock in a steeple near by was striking twelve. The Colonel did not raise his head. Only Stephen saw her go; she felt his eyes following her, and as she slipped out lifted hers to meet them for a brief instant through the opening of the door. Then it closed behind her.  First of all she knew that the light in the outer office was burning dimly, and the discovery gave her a shock. Who had turned it down? Had Clarence? Was he here? Fearfully searching the room for him, her gaze was held by a figure in the recess of the window at the back of the room. A solid, bulky figure it was, and, though uncertainly outlined in the semi-darkness, she knew it. She took a step nearer, and a cry escaped her.  The man was Eliphalet Hopper. He got down from the sill with a motion at once sheepish and stealthy. Her breath caught, and instinctively she gave back toward the door, as if to open it again.  \"Hold on!\" he said. \"I've got something I want to say to you, Miss Virginia.\"  His tones seemed strangely natural. They were not brutal. But she shivered and paused, horrified at the thought of what she was about to do. Her father was in that room--and Stephen. She must keep them there, and get this man away. She must not show fright before him, and yet she could not trust her voice to speak just then. She must not let him know that she was afraid of him--this she kept repeating to herself. But how to act? Suddenly an idea flashed upon her.  Virginia never knew how she gathered the courage to pass him, even swiftly, and turn up the gas. He started back, blinking as the jet flared. For a moment she stood beside it, with her head high; confronting him and striving to steady herself for speech.  \"Why have you come here?\" she said. \"Judge Whipple--died--to-night.\"  The dominating note in his answer was a whine, as if, in spite of himself, he were awed.  \"I ain't here to see the Judge.\"  She was pale, and quite motionless. And she faltered now. She felt her lips moving, but knew not whether the words had come.  \"What do you mean?\"  He gained confidence. The look in his little eyes was the filmy look of those of an animal feasting.  \"I came here to see you,\" he said, \"--you.\" She was staring at him now, in horror. \"And if you don't give me what I want, I cal'late to see some one else--in there,\" said Mr. Hopper.  He smiled, for she was swaying, her lids half closed. By a supreme effort she conquered her terror and looked at him. The look was in his eyes still, intensified now.  \"How dare you speak to me after what has happened! she said. If Colonel Carvel were here, he would--kill you.\"  He flinched at the name and the word, involuntarily. He wiped his forehead, hot at the very thought.  \"I want to know!\" he exclaimed, in faint-hearted irony. Then, remembering his advantage, he stepped close to her.  \"He is here,\" he said, intense now. \"He is here, in that there room.\" He seized her wrists. Virginia struggled, and yet she refrained from crying out. \"He never leaves this city without I choose. I can have him hung if I choose,\" he whispered, next to her.  \"Oh!\" she cried; \"oh, if you choose!\"  Still his body crept closer, and his face closer. And her strength was going.  \"There's but one price to pay,\" he said hoarsely, \"there's but one price to pay, and that's you--you. I cal'late you'll marry me now.\"  Delirious at the touch of her, he did not hear the door open. Her senses were strained for that very sound. She heard it close again, and a footstep across the room. She knew the step--she knew the voice, and her heart leaped at the sound of it in anger. An arm in a blue sleeve came between them, and Eliphalet Hopper staggered and fell across the books on the table, his hand to his face. Above him towered Stephen Brice. Towered was the impression that came to Virginia then, and so she thought of the scene ever afterward. Small bits, like points of tempered steel, glittered in Stephen's eyes, and his hands following up the mastery he had given them clutched Mr. Hopper's shoulders. Twice Stephen shook him so that his head beat upon the table.  \"You--you beast!\" he cried, but he kept his voice low. And then, as if he expected Hopper to reply: \"Shall I kill you?\"  Again he shook him violently. He felt Virginia's touch on his arm.  \"Stephen!\" she cried, \"your wounds! Be careful! Oh, do be careful!\"  She had called him Stephen. He turned slowly, and his hands fell from Mr. Hopper's cowering form as his eyes met hers. Even he could not fathom the appeal, the yearning, in their dark blue depths. And yet what he saw there made him tremble. She turned away, trembling too.  \"Please sit down,\" she entreated. \"He--he won't touch me again while you are here.\"  Eliphalet Hopper raised himself from the desk, and one of the big books fell with a crash to the floor. Then they saw him shrink, his eyes fixed upon some one behind them. Before the Judge's door stood Colonel Carvel, in calm, familiar posture, his feet apart, and his head bent forward as he pulled at his goatee.  \"What is this man doing here, Virginia?\" he asked. She did not answer him, nor did speech seem to come easily to Mr. Hopper in that instant. Perhaps the sight of Colonel Carvel had brought before him too, vividly the memory of that afternoon at Glencoe.  All at once Virginia grasped the fulness of the power in this man's hands. At a word from him her father would be shot as a spy--and Stephen Brice, perhaps, as a traitor. But if Colonel Carvel should learn that he had seized her,--here was the terrible danger of the situation. Well she knew what the Colonel would do. Would. Stephen tell him? She trusted in his coolness that he would not.  Before a word of reply came from any of the three, a noise was heard on the stairway. Some one was coming up. There followed four seconds of suspense, and then Clarence came in. She saw that his face wore a worried, dejected look. It changed instantly when he glanced about him, and an oath broke from his lips as he singled out Eliphalet Hopper standing in sullen aggressiveness, beside the table.  \"So you're the spy, are you?\" he said in disgust. Then he turned his back and faced his uncle. \"I saw, him in Williams's entry as we drove up. He got away from me.\"  A thought seemed to strike him. He strode to the open window at the back of the office, and looked out, There was a roof under it.  \"The sneak got in here,\" he said. \"He knew I was waiting for him in the street. So you're the spy, are you?\"  Mr. Hopper passed a heavy hand across the cheek where Stephen had struck him.  \"No, I ain't the spy,\" he said, with a meaning glance at the Colonel.  \"Then what are you doing here?\" demanded Clarence, fiercely.  \"I cal'late that he knows,\" Eliphalet replied, jerking his head toward Colonel Carvel. \"Where's his Confederate uniform? What's to prevent my calling up the provost's guard below?\" he continued, with a smile that was hideous on his swelling face.  It was the Colonel who answered him, very quickly and very clearly.  \"Nothing whatever, Mr. Hopper,\" he said. \"This is the way out.\" He pointed at the door. Stephen, who was watching him, could not tell whether it were a grim smile that creased the corners of the Colonel's mouth as he added. \"You might prefer the window.\"  Mr. Hopper did not move, but his eyes shifted to Virginia's form. Stephen deliberately thrust himself between them that he might not see her.  \"What are you waiting for?\" said the Colonel, in the mild voice that should have been an ominous warning. Still Mr. Hopper did not move. It was clear that he had not reckoned upon all of this; that he had waited in the window to deal with Virginia alone. But now the very force of a desire which had gathered strength in many years made him reckless. His voice took on the oily quality in which he was wont to bargain.  \"Let's be calm about this business, Colonel,\" he said. \"We won't say anything about the past. But I ain't set on having you shot. There's a consideration that would stop me, and I cal'late you know what it is.\"  Then the Colonel made a motion. But before he had taken a step Virginia had crossed the room swiftly, and flung herself upon him.  \"Oh, don't, Pa!\" she cried. \"Don't! Tell him that I will agree to it. Yes, I will. I can't have you--shot.\" The last word came falteringly, faintly.  \"Let me go,--honey,\" whispered the Colonel, gently. His eyes did not leave Eliphalet. He tried to disengage himself, but her fingers were clasped about his neck in a passion of fear and love. And then, while she clung to him, her head was raised to listen. The sound of Stephen Brice's voice held her as in a spell. His words were coming coldly, deliberately, and yet so sharply that each seemed to fall like a lash.  \"Mr. Hopper, if ever I hear of your repeating what you have seen or heard in this room, I will make this city and this state too hot for you to live in. I know you. I know how you hide in areas, how you talk sedition in private, how you have made money out of other men's misery. And, what is more, I can prove that you have had traitorous dealings with the Confederacy. General Sherman has been good enough to call himself a friend of mine, and if he prosecutes you for your dealings in Memphis, you will get a term in a Government prison, You ought to be hung. Colonel Carvel has shown you the door. Now go.\"  And Mr, Hopper went.    "]]]
