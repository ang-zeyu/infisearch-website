You look enquiringly at me--aye, boy! life will teach you too the lesson that the worst hate that can be turned against you often entails less harm upon you than blind tenderness which knows no reason.  I learned to read and write, and all that is usually taught to the priests' sons, but never to accommodate myself to my lot, and I never shall.--Well, when my beard grew I succeeded in escaping and I lived for a time in the world.  I have been even to Rome, to Carthage, and in Syria; but at last I longed to drink Nile-water once more and I returned to Egypt.  Why?  Because, fool that I was, I fancied that bread and water with captivity tasted better in my own country than cakes and wine with freedom in the land of the stranger.  \"In my father's house I found only my mother still living, for my father had died of grief.  Before my flight she had been a tall, fine woman, when I came home I found her faded and dying.  Anxiety for me, a miserable wretch, had consumed her, said the physician--that was the hardest thing to bear.  When at last the poor, good little woman, who could so fondly persuade me--a wild scamp--implored me on her death-bed to return to my retreat, I yielded, and swore to her that I would stay in my prison patiently to the end, for I am as water is in northern countries, a child may turn me with its little hand or else I am as hard and as cold as crystal.  My old mother died soon after I had taken this oath.  I kept my word as you see--and you have seen too how I endure my fate.\"  \"Patiently enough,\" replied Publius, \"I should writhe in my chains far more rebelliously than you, and I fancy it must do you good to rage and storm sometimes as you did just now.\"  \"As much good as sweet wine from Chios!\"  exclaimed the anchorite, smacking his lips as if he tasted the noble juice of the grape, and stretching his matted head as far as possible out of the window.  Thus it happened that he saw Irene, and called out to her in a cheery voice:  \"What are you doing there, child?  You are standing as if you were waiting to say good-morning to good fortune.\"  The girl hastily took up the trencher, smoothed down her hair with her other hand, and as she approached the men, coloring slightly, Publius feasted his eyes on her in surprise and admiration.  But Serapion's words had been heard by another person, who now emerged from the acacia-grove and joined the young Roman, exclaiming before he came up with them:  \"Waiting for good fortune! does the old man say?  And you can hear it said, Publius, and not reply that she herself must bring good fortune wherever she appears.\"  The speaker was a young Greek, dressed with extreme care, and he now stuck the pomegranate-blossom he carried in his hand behind his ear, so as to shake hands with his friend Publius; then he turned his fair, saucy, almost girlish face with its finely-cut features up to the recluse, wishing to attract his attention to himself by his next speech.  \"With Plato's greeting 'to deal fairly and honestly' do I approach you!\" he cried; and then he went on more quietly: \"But indeed you can hardly need such a warning, for you belong to those who know how to conquer true--that is the inner--freedom; for who can be freer than he who needs nothing?  And as none can be nobler than the freest of the free, accept the tribute of my respect, and scorn not the greeting of Lysias of Corinth, who, like Alexander, would fain exchange lots with you, the Diogenes of Egypt, if it were vouchsafed to him always to see out the window of your mansion--otherwise not very desirable--the charming form of this damsel--\"  \"That is enough, young man,\" said Serapion, interrupting the Greek's flow of words.  \"This young girl belongs to the temple, and any one who is tempted to speak to her as if she were a flute-player will have to deal with me, her protector.  Yes, with me; and your friend here will bear me witness that it may not be altogether to your advantage to have a quarrel with such as I.  Now, step back, young gentlemen, and let the girl tell me what she needs.\"  When Irene stood face to face with the anchorite, and had told him quickly and in a low voice what she had done, and that her sister Klea was even now waiting for her return, Serapion laughed aloud, and then said in a low tone, but gaily, as a father teases his daughter:  \"She has eaten enough for two, and here she stands, on her tiptoes, reaching up to my window, as if it were not an over-fed girl that stood in her garments, but some airy sprite.  We may laugh, but Klea, poor thing, she must be hungry?\"  Irene made no reply, but she stood taller on tiptoe than ever, put her face up to Serapion, nodding her pretty head at him again and again, and as she looked roguishly and yet imploringly into his eyes Serapion went on:  \"And so I am to give my breakfast to Klea, that is what you want; but unfortunately that breakfast is a thing of the past and beyond recall; nothing is left of it but the date-stones.  But there, on the trencher in your hand, is a nice little meal.\"  \"That is the offering to Serapis sent by old Phibis,\" answered the girl.  \"Hm, hm--oh! of course!\"  muttered the old man.  \"So long as it is for a god--surely he might do without it better than a poor famishing girl.\"  Then he went on, gravely and emphatically, as a teacher who has made an incautious speech before his pupils endeavors to rectify it by another of more solemn import.  \"Certainly, things given into our charge should never be touched; besides, the gods first and man afterwards.  Now if only I knew what to do.  But, by the soul of my father!  Serapis himself sends us what we need.  Step close up to me, noble Scipio--or Publius, if I may so call you--and look out towards the acacias.  Do you see my favorite, your cicerone, and the bread and roast fowls that your slave has brought him in that leathern wallet?  And now he is setting a wine-jar on the carpet he has spread at the big feet of Eulaeus--they will be calling you to share the meal in a minute, but I know of a pretty child who is very hungry--for a little white cat stole away her breakfast this morning. Bring me half a loaf and the wing of a fowl, and a few pomegranates if you like, or one of the peaches Eulaeus is so judiciously fingering. Nay--you may bring two of them, I have a use for both.\"  \"Serapion!\"  exclaimed Irene in mild reproof and looking down at the ground; but the Greek answered with prompt zeal, \"More, much more than that I can bring you.  I hasten--\"  \"Stay here,\" interrupted Publius with decision, holding him back by the shoulder.  \"Serapion's request was addressed to me, and I prefer to do my friend's pleasure in my own person.\"  \"Go then,\" cried the Greek after Publius as he hurried away.  \"You will not allow me even thanks from the sweetest lips in Memphis.  Only look, Serapion, what a hurry he is in.  And now poor Eulaeus has to get up; a hippopotamus might learn from him how to do so with due awkwardness. Well! I call that making short work of it--a Roman never asks before he takes; he has got all he wants and Eulaeus looks after him like a cow whose calf has been stolen from her; to be sure I myself would rather eat peaches than see them carried away!  Oh if only the people in the Forum could see him now!  Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica, own grandson to the great Africanus, serving like a slave at a feast with a dish in each hand!  Well Publius, what has Rome the all conquering brought home this time in token of victory?\"  \"Sweet peaches and a roast pheasant,\" said Cornelius laughing, and he handed two dishes into the anchorite's window; \"there is enough left still for the old man.\"  \"Thanks, many thanks!\"  cried Serapion, beckoning to Irene, and he gave her a golden-yellow cake of wheaten bread, half of the roast bird, already divided by Eulaeus, and two peaches, and whispered to her: \"Klea may come for the rest herself when these men are gone.  Now thank this kind gentleman and go.\"  For an instant the girl stood transfixed, her face crimson with confusion and her glistening white teeth set in her nether lip, speechless, face to face with the young Roman and avoiding the earnest gaze of his black eyes.  Then she collected herself and said:  \"You are very kind.  I cannot make any pretty speeches, but I thank you most kindly.\"  \"And your very kind thanks,\" replied Publius, \"add to the delights of this delightful morning.  I should very much like to possess one of the violets out of your hair in remembrance of this day--and of you.\"  \"Take them all,\" exclaimed Irene, hastily taking the bunch from her hair and holding them out to the Roman; but before he could take them she drew back her hand and said with an air of importance:  \"The queen has had them in her hand.  My sister Klea got them yesterday in the procession.\"  Scipio's face grew grave at these words, and he asked with commanding brevity and sharpness:  \"Has your sister black hair and is she taller than you are, and did she wear a golden fillet in the procession?  Did she give you these flowers? Yes--do you say?  Well then, she had the bunch from me, but although she accepted them she seems to have taken very little pleasure in them, for what we value we do not give away--so there they may go, far enough!\"  With these words he flung the flowers over the house and then he went on:  \"But you, child, you shall be held guiltless of their loss.  Give me your pomegranate-flower, Lysias!\"  \"Certainly not,\" replied the Greek.  \"You chose to do pleasure to your friend Serapion in your own person when you kept me from going to fetch the peaches, and now I desire to offer this flower to the fair Irene with my own hand.\"  \"Take this flower,\" said Publius, turning his back abruptly on the girl, while Lysias laid the blossom on the trencher in the maiden's hand; she felt the rough manners of the young Roman as if she had been touched by a hard hand; she bowed silently and timidly and then"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5461"],["title","The Sisters — Volume 1 (#5)"],["body","ran home.  Publius looked thoughtfully after her till Lysias called out to him:  \"What has come over me?  Has saucy Eros perchance wandered by mistake into the temple of gloomy Serapis this morning?\"  \"That would not be wise,\" interrupted the recluse, \"for Cerberus, who lies at the foot of our God, would soon pluck the fluttering wings of the airy youngster,\" and as he spoke he looked significantly at the Greek.  \"Aye! if he let himself be caught by the three-headed monster,\" laughed Lysias.  \"But come away now, Publius; Eulaeus has waited long enough.\"  \"You go to him then,\" answered the Roman, \"I will follow soon; but first I have a word to say to Serapion.\"  Since Irene's disappearance, the old man had turned his attention to the acacia-grove where Eulaeus was still feasting.  When the Roman addressed him he said, shaking his great head with dissatisfaction:  \"Your eyes of course are no worse than mine.  Only look at that man munching and moving his jaws and smacking his lips.  By Serapis!  you can tell the nature of a man by watching him eat.  You know I sit in my cage unwillingly enough, but I am thankful for one thing about it, and that is that it keeps me far from all that such a creature as Eulaeus calls enjoyment--for such enjoyment, I tell you, degrades a man.\"  \"Then you are more of a philosopher than you wish to seem,\" replied Publius.  \"I wish to seem nothing,\" answered the anchorite.  \"For it is all the same to me what others think of me.  But if a man who has nothing to do and whose quiet is rarely disturbed, and who thinks his own thoughts about many things is a philosopher, you may call me one if you like.  If at any time you should need advice you may come here again, for I like you, and you might be able to do me an important service.\"  \"Only speak,\" interrupted the Roman, \"I should be glad from my heart to be of any use to you.\"  \"Not now,\" said Serapion softly.  \"But come again when you have time-- without your companions there, of course--at any rate without Eulaeus, who of all the scoundrels I ever came across is the very worst.  It may be as well to tell you at once that what I might require of you would concern not myself but the weal or woe of the water-bearers, the two maidens you have seen and who much need protection.\"  \"I came here for my parents' sake and for Klea's, and not on your account,\" said Publius frankly.  \"There is something in her mien and in her eyes which perhaps may repel others but which attracts me.  How came so admirable a creature in your temple?\"  \"When you come again,\" replied the recluse, \"I will tell you the history of the sisters and what they owe to Eulaeus.  Now go, and understand me when I say the girls are well guarded.  This observation is for the benefit of the Greek who is but a heedless fellow; but you, when you know who the girls are, will help me to protect them.\"  \"That I would do as it is, with real pleasure,\" replied Publius; he took leave of the recluse and called out to Eulaeus.  \"What a delightful morning it has been!\"  \"It would have been pleasanter for me,\" replied Eulaeus, \"if you had not deprived me of your company for such a long time.\"  \"That is to say,\" answered the Roman, \"that I have stayed away longer than I ought.\"  \"You behave after the fashion of your race,\" said the other bowing low. \"They have kept even kings waiting in their ante-chambers.\"  \"But you do not wear a crown,\" said Publius evasively.  \"And if any one should know how to wait it is an old courtier, who--\"  \"When it is at the command of his sovereign,\" interrupted Eulaeus, the old courtier may submit, even when youngsters choose to treat him with contempt.\"  \"That hits us both,\" said Publius, turning to Lysias.  \"Now you may answer him, I have heard and said enough.\"     CHAPTER III.  Irene's foot was not more susceptible to the chafing of a strap than her spirit to a rough or an unkind word; the Roman's words and manner had hurt her feelings.  She went towards home with a drooping head and almost crying, but before she had reached it her eyes fell on the peaches and the roast bird she was carrying.  Her thoughts flew to her sister and how much the famishing girl would relish so savory a meal; she smiled again, her eyes shone with pleasure, and she went on her way with a quickened step.  It never once occurred to her that Klea would ask for the violets, or that the young Roman could be anything more to her sister than any other stranger.  She had never had any other companion than Klea, and after work, when other girls commonly discussed their longings and their agitations and the pleasures and the torments of love, these two used to get home so utterly wearied that they wanted nothing but peace and sleep.  If they had sometimes an hour for idle chat Klea ever and again would tell some story of their old home, and Irene, who even within the solemn walls of the temple of Serapis sought and found many innocent pleasures, would listen to her willingly, and interrupt her with questions and with anecdotes of small events or details which she fancied she remembered of her early childhood, but which in fact she had first learnt from her sister, though the force of a lively imagination had made them seem a part and parcel of her own experience.  Klea had not observed Irene's long absence since, as we know, shortly after her sister had set out, overpowered by hunger and fatigue she had fallen asleep.  Before her nodding head had finally sunk and her drooping eyelids had closed, her lips now and then puckered and twitched as if with grief; then her features grew tranquil, her lips parted softly and a smile gently lighted up her blushing cheeks, as the breath of spring softly thaws a frozen blossom.  This sleeper was certainly not born for loneliness and privation, but to enjoy and to keep love and happiness.  It was warm and still, very still in the sisters' little room.  The buzz of a fly was audible now and again, as it flew round the little oil-cup Irene had left empty, and now and again the breathing of the sleeper, coming more and more rapidly.  Every trace of fatigue had vanished from Klea's countenance, her lips parted and pouted as if for a kiss, her cheeks glowed, and at last she raised both hands as if to defend herself and stammered out in her dream, \"No, no, certainly not--pray, do not! my love--\"  Then her arm fell again by her side, and dropping on the chest on which she was sitting, the blow woke her.  She slowly opened her eyes with a happy smile; then she raised her long silken lashes till her eyes were open, and she gazed fixedly on vacancy as though something strange had met her gaze.  Thus she sat for some time without moving; then she started up, pressed her hand on her brow and eyes, and shuddering as if she had seen something horrible or were shivering with ague, she murmured in gasps, while she clenched her teeth:  \"What does this mean?  How come I by such thoughts?  What demons are these that make us do and feel things in our dreams which when we are waking we should drive far, far from our thoughts?  I could hate myself, despise and hate myself for the sake of those dreams since, wretch that I am! I let him put his arm round me--and no bitter rage--ah! no--something quite different, something exquisitely sweet, thrilled through my soul.\"  As she spoke, she clenched her fists and pressed them against her temples; then again her arms dropped languidly into her lap, and shaking her head she went on in an altered and softened voice:  \"Still-it was only in a dream and--Oh! ye eternal gods--when we are asleep--well! and what then?  Has it come to this; to impure thoughts I am adding self-deception!  No, this dream was sent by no demon, it was only a distorted reflection of what I felt yesterday and the day before, and before that even, when the tall stranger looked straight into my eyes--four times he has done so now--and then--how many hours ago, gave me the violets.  Did I even turn away my face or punish his boldness with an angry look?  Is it not sometimes possible to drive away an enemy with a glance?  I have often succeeded when a man has looked after us; but yesterday I could not, and I was as wide awake then as I am at this moment.  What does the stranger want with me?  What is it he asks with his penetrating glance, which for days has followed me wherever I turn, and robs me of peace even in my sleep?  Why should I open my eyes--the gates of the heart--to him?  And now the poison poured in through them is seething there; but I will tear it out, and when Irene comes home I will tread the violets into the dust, or leave them with her; she will soon pull them to pieces or leave them to wither miserably--for I will remain pure-minded, even in my dreams--what have I besides in the world?\"  At these words she broke off her soliloquy, for she heard Irene's voice, a sound that must have had a favorable effect on her spirit, for she paused, and the bitter expression her beautiful features had but just now worn disappeared as she murmured, drawing a deep breath:  \"I am not utterly bereft and wretched so long as I have her, and can hear her voice.\"  Irene, on her road home, had given the modest offerings of the anchorite Phibis into the charge of one of the temple-servants to lay before the altar of Serapis, and now as she came into the room she hid the platter with the Roman's donation behind her, and while still in the doorway, called out to her sister:  \"Guess now, what have I here?\"  \"Bread and dates from Serapion,\" replied Klea.  \"Oh, dear no!\"  cried the other, holding out the plate to her sister, \"the very nicest dainties, fit for gods and kings.  Only feel this peach, does not it feel as soft as one of little Philo's cheeks?  If I could always provide such a substitute you would wish I might eat up your breakfast every day.  And now do you know who gave you all this?  No, that you will never guess!  The tall Roman gave them me, the same you had"]]]
