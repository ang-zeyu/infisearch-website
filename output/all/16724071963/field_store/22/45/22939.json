He knew that she had played the listener, and when, and where!  The shock it gave her, and the almost unendurable pang of feeling herself lowered in his eyes, quite dazed her.  She felt bewildered, offended, menaced; however, she retained enough presence of mind to reply in a moment to her antagonist:  \"Do not be alarmed!  I will come no more.  I should not have come at all, if I could have foreseen. . .\"  \"That you would meet me?\"  \"Perhaps.--But do not flatter yourself too much on that account!--As to my listening...  Well, yes; I was standing at the window.  Inside the room I could only half hear, and who does not want to hear what great men have to say to each other?  And, excepting your father, I have met none such in Memphis since Memnon left the city.  We women have inherited some curiosity from our mother Eve; but we rarely indulge it so far as to hunt for a necklace in our neighbor's trunk!  I have no luck as a criminal, my dear Orion.  Twice have I deserved the name.  Thanks to the generous and liberal use you made of my inexperience I sinned--sinned so deeply that it has ruined my whole life; and now, again, in a more venial way; but I was caught out, you see, in both cases.\"  \"Your taunts are merited,\" said Orion sadly.  \"And yet, Child, we may both thank Providence, which did not leave us to wander long on the wrong road.  Once already I have besought your forgiveness, and I do so now again.  That does not satisfy you I see--and I can hardly blame you. Perhaps you will be better pleased, when I assure you once more that no sin was ever more bitterly or cruelly punished than mine has been.\"  \"Indeed!\"  said Katharina with a drawl; then, with a flutter of her fan, she went on airily: \"And yet you look anything rather than crushed; and have even succeeded in winning 'the other'--Paula, if I am not mistaken.\"  \"That will do!\"  said Orion decisively, and he raised the key to the lock.  Katharina, however, placed herself in his way, raised a threatening finger, and exclaimed:  \"So I should think!--Now I am certain.  However, you are right with your insolent 'That will do!'  I do not care a rush for your love affairs; still, there is one thing I should like to know, which concerns myself alone; how could you see over our garden hedge?  Anubis is scarcely a head shorter than you are. . . .\"  \"And you made him try?\"  interrupted Orion, who could not forbear smiling, perceiving that his honestly meant gravity was thrown away on Katharina.  \"Notwithstanding such a praiseworthy experiment, I may beg you to note for future cases that what is true of him is not true of every one, and that, besides foot-passengers, a tall man sometimes mounts a tall horse?\"  \"It was you, then, who rode by last night?\"  \"And who could not resist glancing up at your window.\"  At these words she drew back in surprise, and her eyes lighted up, but only for an instant; then, clenching the feathers of her fan in both hands, she sharply asked:  \"Is that in mockery?\"  \"Certainly not,\" said Orion coolly; \"for though you have reason enough to be angry with me......\"  \"I, at any rate, have, so far given you none,\" she petulantly broke in. \"No, I have not.  It is I, and I alone, who have been insulted and ill- used; you must confess that you owe me some amends, and that I have a right to ask them.\"  \"Do so,\" replied he.  \"I am yours to command.\"  She looked him straight in the face.  \"First of all,\" she began, \"have you told any one else that I was. . .\"  \"That you were listening?  No--not a living soul.\"  \"And will you promise never to betray me?\"  \"Willingly.  Now, what is the 'secondly' to this 'first of all?'\"  But there was no immediate answer; the water-wagtail evidently found it difficult.  However, she presently said, with downcast eyes:  \"I want....  You will think me a greater fool than I am.... nevertheless, yes, I will ask you, though it will involve me in fresh humiliation.--I want to know the truth; and if there is anything you hold sacred, before I ask, you must swear by what is holiest to answer me, not as if I were a silly girl, but as if I were the Supreme judge at the last day.--Do you hear?\"  \"This is very solemn,\" said Orion.  \"And you must allow me to observe that there are some questions which do not concern us alone, and if yours is such......\"  \"No, no,\" replied Katharina, \"what I mean concerns you and me alone.\"  \"Then I see no reason for refusing,\" he said.  \"Still, I may ask you a favor in return.  It seems to me no less important than it did to you, to know what a great man like the patriarch finds to talk about, and since I place myself at your commands....\"  \"I thought,\" said the girl with a smile, \"that your first object would be to discharge some small portion of your debt to me; however, I expect no excessive magnanimity, and the little I heard is soon told.  It cannot matter much to you either--so I will agree to your wishes, and you, in return, must promise.  .  .  .\"  \"To speak the whole truth.\"  \"As truly as you hope for forgiveness of your sins?\"  \"As truly as that.\"  \"That is well.\"  \"And what is it that you want to know?\"  At this she shook her head, exclaiming uneasily:  \"Nay, nay, not yet.  It cannot be done so lightly.  First let me speak; and then open the door, and if I want to fly let me go without saying or asking me another word.--Give me that chair; I must sit down.\"  And in fact she seemed to need it; for some minutes she had looked very pale and exhausted, and her hands trembled as she drew her handkerchief across her face.  When she was seated she began her story; and while her words flowed on quickly but without expression, as though she spoke mechanically, Orion listened with eager interest, for what she had to tell struck him as highly significant and important.  He had been watched by the patriarch's orders.  By midnight Benjamin had already been informed of Orion's visit to Fostat, and to the Arab general.  Nothing, however, had been said about it beyond a fear lest he had gone thither with a view to abjuring the faith of his fathers and going over to the Infidels.  Far more important were the facts Orion gathered as to the prelate's negotiations with the Khaliff's representative.  Amru had urged a reduction of the number of convents and of the monks and nuns who lived on the bequests and gifts of the pious, busied in all kinds of handiwork according to the rule of Pachomius, and enabled, by the fact of their living at free quarters, to produce almost all the necessaries of life, from the mats on the floors to the shoes worn by the citizens, at a much lower price than the independent artisans, whether in town or country.  The great majority of these poor creatures were already ruined by such competition, and Amru, seeing the Arab leather-workers, weavers, ropemakers, and the rest, threatened with the same fate, had determined to set himself firmly to restrict all this monastic work.  The patriarch had resisted stoutly and held out long, but at last he had been forced to sacrifice almost half the convents for monks and nuns.  But nothing had been conceded without an equivalent; for Benjamin was well aware of the immense difficulties which he, as chief of the Church, could put in the way of the new government of the country.  So it was left to him to designate which convents should be suppressed, and he had, of course, begun by laying hands on the few remaining Melchite retreats, among them the Convent of St. Cecilia, next to the house of Rufinus. This establishment was now to be closed within three days and to become the property of the Jacobite Church; but it was to be done quite quietly, for there was no small fear that now, when the delayed rising of the river was causing a fever of anxiety in all minds, the impoverished populace of the town might rise in defence of the wealthy sisterhood to whom they were beholden for much benevolence and kind care.  Opposition from the town-senate was also to be looked for, since the deceased Mukaukas had pronounced this measure unjust and detrimental to the common welfare.  The evicted orthodox nuns were to be taken into various Jacobite convents as lay sisters similar cases had already been known; but the abbess, whose superior intellect, high rank, and far- reaching influence might, if she were left free to act, easily rouse the prelates of the East to oppose Benjamin, was to be conveyed to a remote convent in Ethiopia, whence no flight or return was possible.  Katharina's report took but few minutes, and she gave it with apparent indifference; what could the suppression of an orthodox cloister, and the dispersion of its heretic sisterhood, matter to her, or to Orion, whose brothers had fallen victims to Melchite fanaticism?  Orion did not betray his deep interest in all he heard, and when at length Katharina rose and pointed feebly to the door, all she said, as though she were vexed at having wasted so much time, was: \"That, on the whole, is all.\"  \"All?\" asked Orion unlocking the door.  \"Certainly, all,\" she repeated uneasily.  \"What I meant to ask--whether I ever know it or not--it does not matter.--It would be better perhaps-yes, that is all.--Let me go.\"  But he did not obey her.  \"Ask,\" he said kindly.  \"I will  answer you gladly.\"  \"Gladly?\"  she retorted, with an incredulous shrug.  \"In point of fact you ought to feel uncomfortable whenever you see me; but things do not always turn out as they ought, in Memphis or in the world; for what do you men care what becomes of a poor girl like me?  Do not imagine that I mean to reproach you; God forbid!  I do not even owe you a grudge. If anyone can live such a thing down I can.  Do not you think so? Everything is admirably arranged for me; I cannot fail to do well. I am very rich, and not ugly, and I shall have a hundred suitors yet. Oh, I am a most enviable creature!  I have had one lover already, and the next will be more faithful, at any rate, and not"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5523"],["title","The Bride of the Nile — Volume 07 (#7)"],["body","me over so ruthlessly as the first.--Do not you think so?\"  \"I hope so,\" said Oriole gravely.  \"Bitter as the cup is that you offer me to drink.  .  .\"  \"Well?\"  \"I can only repeat that I must even drink it, since the fault was mine. Nothing would so truly gladden me as to be able to atone in some degree for my sin against you.\"  \"Oh dear no!\" she scornfully threw in.  \"Our hopes shall not be fixed so high as that!  All is at an end between us, and if you ever were anything to me, you are nothing to me now--absolutely nothing.  One hour in the past we had in common; it was short indeed, but to me--would you believe it?--a very great matter.  It aged the young creature, whom you, but yesterday, still regarded as a mere child--that much I know--with amazing rapidity; aye, and made a worse woman of her than you can fancy.\"  \"That indeed would grieve me to the bottom of my soul,\" replied Orion. \"There is, I know, no excuse for my conduct.  Still, as you yourself know, our mothers' wish in the first instance. . .\"  \"Destined us for each other, you would say.  Quite true!--And it was all to please Dame Neforis that you put your arms round me, under the acacias, and called me your own, your all, your darling, your rose-bud? Was that--and this is exactly what I want to ask you, what I insist on knowing--was that all a lie--or did you, at any rate, in that brief moment, under the trees, love me with all your heart--love me as now you love--I cannot name her--that other?--The truth, Orion, the whole truth, on your oath!\"  She had raised her voice and her eyes glowed with the excitement of passion; and now, when she ceased speaking, their sparkling, glistening enquiry plainly and unreservedly confessed that her heart still was his, that she counted on his high-mindedness and expected him to say \"yes.\" Her round arm lay closely pressed to her bosom, as though to keep its wild heaving within bounds.  Her delicate face had lost its pallor and seemed bathed in a glow, now tender and now crimson.  Her little mouth, which but now had uttered such bitter words, was parted in a smile as if ready to bestow a sweet reward for the consoling, saving answer, for which her whole being yearned, and her eager eyes, shining through tears, did not cease to entreat him so pathetically, so passionately!  How bewitching an image of helpless, love-sick, beseeching youth and grace.  \"As you love that other,--on your oath.\"--The words still rang in the young man's ear.  All that was soft in his soul urged him to make good the evil he had brought upon this fair, hapless young creature; but those very words gave him strength to remain steadfast; and though he felt himself appealed to for comfort and compassion, he could only stretch out imploring hands, as though praying for help, and say:  \"Ah Katharina, and you are as lovely, as charming now, as you were then; but--much as you attracted me, the great love that fills a life can come but once...  Forget what happened afterwards...  Put your question in another form, alter it a little, and ask me again--or let me assure you.\"  But he had no time to say more; for, before he could atop her, she had slipped past him and flown away like some swift wild thing into the road and down to the fishing cove.     CHAPTER IV.  Orion stood alone gazing sadly after her.  Was this his father's curse-- that all who loved him must reap pain and grief in return?  He shivered; still, his youthful energy and powers of resistance were strong enough to give him speedy mastery over these torturing reflections.  What opportunities lay before him of proving his prowess! Even while Katharina was telling her story, the brave and strenuous youth had set himself the problem of rescuing the cloistered sisters.  The greater the danger its solution might involve him in, the more impossible it seemed at first sight, the more gladly, in his present mood, would he undertake it.  He stepped out into the road and closed the door behind him with a feeling of combative energy.  It was growing dusk.  Philippus must now be with Mary and, with the leech's aid, he was resolved to get the child away from his mother's house.  Not till he felt that she was safe with Paula in Rufinus' house, could he be free to attempt the enterprise which floated before his eyes. On the stairs he shouted to a slave:  \"My chariot with the Persian trotting horse!\"  and a few minutes after he entered the little girl's room at the same time with a slave girl who carried in a lamp.  Neither Mary nor the physician observed him at first, and he heard her say to Philippus, who sat holding her wrist between his fingers.  \"What is the matter with you this evening?  Good heavens, how pale and melancholy you look!\"  The lamplight fell full on his face.  \"Look here, I have just made such a smart little man out of wax. . .\"  She hoped to amuse the friend who was always so kind to her with this comical work of art; but, as she leaned forward to reach it, she caught sight of her uncle and exclaimed: \"Philippus comes here to cure me, but he looks as if he wanted a draught himself.  Take care, or you will have to drink that bitter brown stuff you sent yesterday; then you will know for once how nasty it can be.\"  Though the child's exclamation was well- meant, neither of the men took any notice of it.  They stood face to face in utter silence and with only a formal greeting; for Orion, without Mary's remark, had been struck by the change that had come over the physician since yesterday.  Ignoring Orion's presence, he asked the child a few brief questions, begged Eudoxia to persevere in the same course of treatment, and then hastily bid a general farewell to all present; Orion, however, did not respond, but said, with an affectionate glance at the little patient:  \"One word with you presently.\"  This made Philippus turn to look at Mary and, as the eyes of the rivals met, they knew that on one subject at any rate they thought and felt alike.  The leech already knew how tenderly the young man had taken to Mary, and he followed him into the room which Orion now occupied, and which, as Philippus was aware, had formerly been Paula's.  \"In the cause of duty,\" he said to himself again and again, to keep himself calm and enable him to gather at least the general sense of what the handsome young fellow opposite to him was saying in his rich, pleasant voice, and urging as a request with more warmth than the leech had given him credit for.  Philippus, of course, had heard of the grandmother's lamentable revulsion of feeling against her grandchild, and he thought Orion's wish to remove the little girl fully justified. But, on learning that she was to be placed under Paula's care, he seemed startled, and gazed at the floor in such sullen gloom that the other easily guessed what was going on in his mind.  In fact, the physician suspected that the child was to serve merely as an excuse for the more frequent meetings of the lovers.  Unable to bury this apprehension in his own breast he started to his feet, and was about to put it into words, when Orion took the words out of his mouth, saying modestly but frankly, with downcast eyes:  \"I speak only for the child's--for Mary's sake.  By my father's soul....\"  But Philippus shook his head dismally, went up to his rival, and murmured dully:  \"For the sake of that child I am capable of doing or enduring a great deal.  She could not be better cared for than with Rufinus and Paula; but if I could suppose,\" and he raised his voice, while his eyes took a sinister and threatening expression, \"if I could suppose that her sacred and suffering innocence were merely an excuse.  .  .  .\"  \"No, no,\" said Orion urgently.  \"Again, on my sacred word, I assure you that I have no aim in view but the child's safety; and, as we have said so much, I will not stick at a word more or less!  \"Rufinus' house is open to you day and night, and I, if all turns out as I expect, shall ere long be far from hence--from Memphis--from Paula.  There is mischief brewing--I dare say no more--an act of treachery; and I will try to prevent it at the risk of my life.  You, every one, shall no longer have a right to think me capable of things which are as repulsive to my nature as to yours.  You and I, if I mistake not, strive for the same prize, and so far are rivals; but why should the child therefor suffer?  Forget it in her presence, and that forgetting will, as you well know, enhance your merit in her--her eyes.\"  \"My merit?\"  retorted the other scornfully.  \"Merit is not in the balance; nothing but the gifts of blind Fortune--a nose, a chin, an eye, anything in short--a crime as much as a deed of heroism--that happens to make a deep impression on the wax of a girl's soft heart.  But curse me,\" and he shouted the words at Orion as if he were beside himself, \"if I know how we came to talk of such things!  Has my folly gone running through the streets, bare-bosomed, to display itself to the world at large?  How do you know what my feelings are?  She, perhaps, has laughed with you at her ridiculous lover?--Well, no matter.  You know already, or will know by to-morrow, which of us has won the cock-fight.  You have only to look at me!  What woman ever broke her heart for such a Thersites-face.  Good-luck to the winner, and the other one--well, since it must be so, farewell till to-morrow.\"  He hastily made his way towards the door; Orion, however, detained him, imploring him to set aside his ill-feeling--at any rate for the present; assured him that Paula had not betrayed what his feelings were; that, on the contrary, he himself, seeing him with her so late on the previous night, had been consumed by jealousy, and entreated him to vent his wrath on him in abusive words, if that could ease his heart, only, by all that was good, not to withdraw his succor from that poor, innocent child.  The physician's humane heart was not proof against his prayer; and when at length he prepared to"]]]
