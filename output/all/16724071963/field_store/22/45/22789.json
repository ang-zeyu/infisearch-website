While she was still gazing after him, a second figure of equal size approached her and, hastily begging her permission, lifted her in his arms like a child, and as she inhaled the cool night air and felt the water through which her bearer waded splash up and wet her feet, her eyes sought her new-made husband--but in vain; the night was very dark, and the lights on the shore did not reach this spot so far below the walls of the quay.  Barine was frightened; but a few minutes after the outlines of a large fishing boat loomed through the darkness, dimly illumined by the harbour lights, and the next instant the giant who carried her placed her on the deck, and a deep voice whispered: \"All's well.  I'll bring some wine at once.\"  Then Barine saw her husband lying motionless on a couch which had been prepared for him in the prow of the boat.  Bending over him, she perceived that he had fainted, and while rubbing his forehead with the wine, raising his head on her lap, cheering him, and afterwards by the light of a small lantern carefully renewing the bandage on his shoulder, she did not notice that the vessel was moving through the water until the boatman set the triangular sail.  She had not been told where the boat was bearing her, and she did not ask.  Any spot that she could share with Dion was welcome.  The more lonely the place, the more she could be to him.  How her heart swelled with gratitude and love!  When she bent over him, kissed his forehead, and felt how feverishly it burned, she thought, \"I will nurse you back to health,\" and raised her eyes and soul to her favourite god, to whom she owed the gift of song, and who understood everything beautiful and pure, to thank Phoebus Apollo and beseech him to pour his rays the next morning on a convalescent man.  While she was still engaged in prayer the boat touched the shore.  Again strong arms bore her and Dion to the land, and when her foot touched the solid earth, her rescuer, the freedman Pyrrhus, broke the silence, saying: \"Welcome, wife of Dion, to our island!  True, you must be satisfied to take us as we are.  But if you are as content with us as we are glad to serve you and your lord, who is ours also, the hour of leave-taking will be far distant.\"  Then, leading the way to the house, he showed her as her future apartments two large whitewashed rooms, whose sole ornament was their exquisite neatness.  On the threshold stood Pyrrhus's grey-haired wife, a young woman, and a girl scarcely beyond childhood; but the older one modestly welcomed Barine, and also begged her to accept their hospitality.  Recovery was rapid in the pure air of the Serpent Isle. She herself, and--she pointed to the others--her oldest son's wife, and her own daughter, Dione, would be ready to render her any service.     CHAPTER XVI.  Brothers and sisters are rarely talkative when they are together.  As Charmian went to Lochias with Archibius, it was difficult for her to find words, the events of the past few hours had agitated her so deeply. Archibius, too, could not succeed in turning his thoughts in any other direction, though important and far more momentous things claimed his attention.  They walked on silently side by side.  In reply to his sister's inquiry where the newly wedded pair were to be concealed, he had answered that, spite of her trustworthiness, this must remain a secret.  To her second query, how had it been possible to use the interior of the Temple of Isis without interruption, he also made a guarded reply.  In fact, it was the control of the subterranean corridors of the sanctuary which had suggested to Gorgias the idea of carrying Dion through them to Pyrrhus's fishing-boat.  To accomplish this it was only necessary to have the Temple of Isis, which usually remained open day and night, left to the fugitive's friends for a short time; and this was successfully managed.  The historian Timagenes, who had come from Rome as ambassador and claimed the hospitality of his former pupil Archibius, had been empowered to offer Cleopatra recognition of her own and her children's right to the throne, and a full pardon, if she would deliver Mark Antony into the hands of Octavianus, or have him put to death.  The Alexandrian Timagenes considered this demand both just and desirable, because it promised to deliver his native city from the man whose despotic arrogance menaced its freedom, and whose lavish generosity and boundless love of splendour diminished its wealth.  To Rome, as whose representative the historian appeared, this man's mere existence meant constant turmoil and civil war.  At the restoration of the flute-player by Gabinius and Mark Antony, Timagenes had been carried into slavery. Later, when, after his freedom had been purchased by the son of Sulla, he succeeded in attaining great influence in Rome, he still remained hostile to Mark Antony, and it had been a welcome charge to work against him in Alexandria.  He hoped to find an ally in Archibius, whose loyal devotion to the Queen he knew.  Arius, Barine's uncle and Octavianus's former tutor, would also aid him.  The most powerful support of his mission, however, could be rendered by the venerable chief priest, the head of the whole Egyptian hierarchy.  He had shown the latter that Antony, in any case, was a lost man, and Egypt was in the act of dropping like a ripe fruit into the lap of Octavianus.  It would soon be in his power to give the country whatever degree of liberty and independence he might choose. The Caesar had the sole disposal of the Queen's fate also, and whoever desired to see her remain on the throne must strive to gain the good-will of Octavianus.  The wise Anubis had considered all these things, but he owed to Timagenes the hint that Arius was the man whom Octavianus most trusted.  So the august prelate secretly entered into communication with Barine's uncle. But the dignity of his high office, and the feebleness of extreme age, forbade Anubis to seek the man who was suspected of friendship for the Romans.  He had therefore sent his trusted secretary, the young Serapion, to make a compact as his representative with the friend of Octavianus, whose severe injuries prevented his leaving the house to go to the chief priest.  During Timagenes's negotiations with the secretary and Arius, Archibius came to entreat Barine's uncle to do everything in his power to save his niece; and, as all the Queen's friends were anxious to prevent an act which, in these times of excitement, could not fail, on account of its connection with Dion, a member of the Council, to rouse a large number of the citizens against her, Serapion, as soon as he was made aware of the matter, eagerly protested his readiness to do his best to save the imperilled lovers.  He cared nothing for Barine or Dion as individuals, but he doubtless would have been ready to make a still greater sacrifice to win the influential Archibius, and especially Arius, who would have great power through Octavianus, the rising sun.  The men had just begun to discuss plans for saving Barine, when the Nubian appeared and told Archibius what had been arranged beside Dion's sick-bed by the freedman and Gorgias.  The escape of the fugitives depended solely upon their reaching the boat unseen, and the surest way to accomplish this was to use the subterranean passage which the architect had again opened.  Archibius, to whom the representative of the chief priest had offered his aid, now took the others into his confidence, and Arius proposed that Barine should marry Dion in the Temple of Isis, and the couple should afterwards be guided through the secret passage to the boat.  This proposal was approved, and Serapion promised to reserve the sanctuary for the wedding of the fugitives for a short time after the departure of the procession, which was to take place at sunset.  In return for this service another might perhaps soon be requested from the friend of Octavianus, who greeted his promise with grateful warmth.  \"The priesthood,\" said Serapion, \"takes sides with all who are unjustly persecuted, and in this case bestows aid the more willingly on account of its great anxiety to guard the Queen from an act which would be difficult to approve.\"  As for the fugitives, so far as he could see, only two possibilities were open to them: Cleopatra would cleave to Mark Antony and go--would that the immortals might avert it!--to ruin, or she would sacrifice him and save her throne and life.  In both cases the endangered lovers could soon return uninjured--the Queen had a merciful heart, and never retained anger long if no guilt existed.  The details of the plan were then settled by Archibius, Anukis, and Berenike, who was with the family of Arius, and the decision was communicated to the architect.  Archibius had maintained the same silence concerning the destination of the fugitives towards the men composing the council and Barine's mother as to his sister.  With regard to the mission of Timagenes and the political questions which occupied his mind, he gave Charmian only the degree of information necessary to explain the plan she so lovingly promoted; but she had no desire to know more.  On the way home her mind was wholly absorbed by the fear that Cleopatra had missed her services and discovered Barine's flight.  True, she mentioned the Queen's desire to place her children in Archibius's charge, but she could not give him full particulars until she reached her own apartments.  Her absence had not been noticed.  The Regent Mardion had received the procession in the Queen's name, for Cleopatra had driven into the city, no one knew where.  Charmian entered her apartments with a lighter heart.  Anukis opened the door to them.  She had remained undisturbed, and it was a pleasure to Archibius to give the faithful, clever freedwoman an account of the matter with his own lips.  He could have bestowed no richer reward upon the modest servant, who listened to his "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5479"],["title","Cleopatra — Volume 07 (#4)"],["body","as if they were a revelation.  When she disclaimed the thanks with which he concluded, protesting that she was the person under obligation, the expression was sincere.  Her keen intellect instantly recognized the aristocrat's manner of addressing an equal or an inferior; and he who, in her eyes, was the first of men, had described the course of events as though she had stood on the same level.  The Queen herself might have been satisfied with the report.  When she left Charmian's rooms to join the other servants, she told herself that she was an especially favoured mortal; and when a young cook teased her about her head being sunk between her shoulders, she answered, laughing--\"My shoulders have grown so high because I shrug them so often at the fools who jeer at me and yet are not half so happy and grateful.\"  Charmian, sorely wearied, had flung herself into an arm-chair, and Archibius took his place opposite to her.  They were happy in each other's society, even when silent; but to-day the hearts of both were so full that they fared like those who are so worn out by fatigue that they cannot sleep.  How much they had to tell each other!--yet it was long ere Charmian broke the silence and returned to the subject of the Queen's wish, describing to her brother Cleopatra's visit to the house which the children had built, how kind and cordial she had been; yet, a few minutes later, incensed by the mere mention of Barine's name, she had dismissed her so ungraciously.  \"I do not know what you intend,\" she said in conclusion, \"but, notwithstanding my love for her, I must perhaps decide in favour of what is most difficult, for--when she learns that it was I who withdrew the daughter of Leonax from her and the base Alexas--what treatment can I expect, especially as Iras no longer gives me the same affection, and shows that she has forgotten my love and care?  This will increase, and the worst of the matter is, that if the Queen begins to favour her, I cannot justly reproach her, for Iras is keener-witted, and has a more active brain.  Statecraft was always odious to me.  Iras, on the contrary, is delighted with the opportunity to speak on subjects connected with the government of the country, and especially the ceaseless, momentous game with Rome and the men who guide her destiny.\"  \"That game is lost,\" Archibius broke in with so much earnestness that Charmian started, repeating in a low, timid tone:  \"Lost?\"  \"Forever,\" said Archibius, \"unless--  \"The Olympians be praised--that there is still a doubt.\"  \"Unless Cleopatra can decide to commit an act which will force her to be faithless to herself, and destroy her noble image through all future generations.\"  \"How?\"  \"Whenever you learn it, will be too soon.\"  \"And suppose she should do it, Archibius?  You are her most trusted confidant.  She will place in your charge what she loves more than she does herself.\"  \"More?  You mean, I suppose, the children?\"  \"The children!  Yes, a hundred times yes.  She loves them better than aught else on earth.  For them, believe me, she would be ready to go to her death.\"  \"Let us hope so.\"  \"And you--were she to commit the horrible deed--I can only suspect what it is.  But should she descend from the height which she has hitherto occupied--would you still be ready--\"  \"With me,\" he interrupted quietly, \"what she does or does not do matters nothing.  She is unhappy and will be plunged deeper and deeper into misery.  I know this, and it constrains me to exert my utmost powers in her service.  I am hers as the hermit consecrated to Serapis belongs to the god.  His every thought must be devoted to him.  To the deity who created him he dedicates body and soul until the death to which he dooms him.  The bonds which unite me to this woman--you know their origin--are not less indestructible.  Whatever she desires whose fulfilment will not force me to despise myself is granted in advance.\"  \"She will never require such things from the friend of her childhood,\" cried Charmian.  Then, approaching him with both arms extended joyfully, she exclaimed: \"Thus you ought to speak and feel, and therein is the answer to the question which has agitated my soul since yesterday. Barine's flight, the favour and disfavour of Cleopatra, Iras, my poor head, which abhors politics, while at this time the Queen needs keen- sighted confidants--\"  \"By no means,\" her brother interrupted.  \"It is for men alone to give counsel in these matters.  Accursed be women's gossip over their toilet tables.  It has already scattered to the four winds many a well- considered plan of the wisest heads, and an Iras could never be more fatal to statecraft than just at the present moment, had not Fate already uttered the final verdict.\"  \"Then hence with these scruples,\" cried Charmian eagerly; \"my doubts are at an end!  As usual, you point out the right path.  I had thought of returning to the country estate we call Irenia--the abode of peace--or to our beloved little palace at Kanopus, to spend the years which may still be allotted to me, and return to everything that made my childhood beautiful.  The philosophers, the flowers in the garden, the poets-- even the new Roman ones, of whose works Timagenes sent us such charming specimens--would enliven the solitude.  The child, the daughter of the man whose love I renounced, and afterwards perhaps her sons and daughters, would fill the place of my own.  As they would have been dear to Leonax, I, too, would have loved them!  This is the guise in which the future has appeared to me in many a quiet hour.  But shall Charmian--who, when her heart throbbed still more warmly and life lay fair before her, laid her first love upon the altar of sacrifice for her royal playfellow --abandon Cleopatra in misfortune from mere selfish scruples?  No, no!-- Like you, I too belong--come what may--to the Queen.\"  She gazed into her brother's face, sure of his approval but, waving his uplifted hand, he answered gravely: \"No, Charmian!  What I, a man, can assume, might be fatal to you, a woman.  The present is not sweet enough for me to embitter it with wormwood from the future.  And yet you must cast one glance into its gloomy domain, in order to understand me.  You can be silent, and what you now learn will be a secret between us.  Only one thing\"--here he lowered the loud tones of his deep voice--\"only one thing can save her: the murder of Antony, or an act of shameless treachery which would deliver him into Octavianus's power.  This is the proposal Timagenes brought.\"  \"This?\" she asked in a hollow tone, her grey head drooping.  \"This,\" he repeated firmly.  \"And if she succumbs to the temptation, she will be faithless to the love which has coursed through her whole life as the Nile flows through the land of her ancestors.  Then, Charmian, stay, stay under any circumstances, cling to her more firmly than ever, for then, then, my sister, she will be more wretched--ten, a hundred fold more wretched than if Octavianus deprives her of everything, perhaps even life itself.\"  \"Nor will I leave her, come what may.  I will remain at her side until the end,\" cried Charmian eagerly.  But Archibius, without noticing the enthusiastic ardor, so unusual to his sister's quiet nature, calmly continued: \"She won your heart also, and it seems impossible for you to desert her.  Many have shared our feelings; and it is no disgrace to any one.  Misfortune is a weapon which cleaves base natures like a sword, yet like a hammer welds noble ones more closely.  To you, therefore, it now seems doubly difficult to leave her, but you need love.  The right to live and guard yourself from the most pitiable retrogression is your due, as much as that of the rare woman on the throne.  So long as you are sure of her love, remain with her, and show your devotion in every situation until the end.  But the motives which were drawing you away to books, flowers, and children, weigh heavily in the balance, and if you lack the anchor of her favour and love, I shall see you perish miserably.  The frost emanating from Cleopatra, if her heart grew cold to you, the pin- pricks with which Iras would assail you, were you defenceless, would kill you.  This must not be, sister; we will guard against it  Do not interrupt me.  The counsel I advise you to follow has been duly weighed. If you see that the Queen still loves you as in former days, cling to her; but should you learn the contrary, bid her farewell to-morrow.  My Irenia is yours--\"  \"But she does love me, and even should she no longer--\"  \"The test is at hand.  We will leave the decision to her.  You shall confess that you were the culprit who aided Barine to escape her power to punish.\"  \"Archibius!\"  \"If you did not, a series of falsehoods must ensue.  Try whether the petty qualities in her nature, which urged her to commit the fate of Leonax's daughter to unworthy hands, are more powerful than the nobler ones.  Try whether she is worthy of the self-sacrificing fidelity which you have given her all your life.  If she remains the same as before, spite of this admission--\"  Here he was interrupted by Anukis, who asked if her mistress would see Iras at this late hour.  \"Admit her,\" replied Archibius, after hastily exchanging glances with his sister, whose face had paled at his demand. He perceived it and, as the servant withdrew, he clasped her hand, saying with earnest affection: \"I gave you my opinion, but at our age we must take counsel with ourselves, and you will find the right path.\"  \"I have already found it,\" she answered softly with downcast eyes.  \"This visitor brought a speedy decision.  I must not feel ashamed in Iras's presence.\"  She had scarcely finished speaking when the Queen's younger confidante entered.  She was excited and, after casting a searching glance around the familiar room, she asked, after a curt greeting:  \"No one knows where the Queen has gone.  Mardion received the procession in her place.  Did she take"]]]
