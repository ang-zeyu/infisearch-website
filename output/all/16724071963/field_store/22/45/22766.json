Why am I using it here till it is weary and almost paralyzed?  In honour of Cleopatra, our illustrious Queen, and her generous friend, to whom we all owe a debt of gratitude.  Let all who love her and the divine Antony, the new Herakles and Dionysus--both will soon make their entry among us crowned with the laurels of victory--join the Regent and every well-disposed person in seizing yonder bit of land so meanly withheld by base avarice and a sentiment--a sentiment, do you hear?--which I do not name more plainly, simply because wickedness is repulsive to me, and I do not stand here as an accuser.  Whoever upholds the word-monger who spouts forth books as the dolphin at my side does water, may do so.  I shall not envy him.  But first look at Didymus's ally and panegyrist.  There he stands opposite to me.  It would have been better for him had the dolphin at his feet taught him silence.  Then he might have remained in the obscurity which befits him.  \"But whether willing or not, I must drag him forth, and I will show you Dion, fellow-citizens, though I would far rather have you see things which arouse less ire.  The dim light prevents your distinguishing the colour of his robe, but I know it, for I saw it in the glare of day.  It is hyacinthine purple.  You know what that costs.  It would support the wives and children of many among you for ten long years.  'How heavy must be the purse which can expose such a treasure to sun and rain!' is the thought of every one who sees him strutting about as proudly as a peacock.  And his purse is loaded with many talents.  Only it is a pity that, day after day, most of you must give your children a little less bread and deprive yourselves of many a draught of wine to deck him out so bravely.  His father, Eumenes, was a tax-collector, and what the leech extorted from you and your children, the son now uses to drive, clad in hyacinthine purple, a four-horse chariot, which splashes the mire from the street into your faces as it rolls onward.  By the dog! the gentleman does  not weigh  so  very much, yet he needs four horses to drag him. And, fellow-citizens, do you know why?  I'll tell you.  He's afraid of sticking fast everywhere, even in his speech.\"  Here Philostratus lowered his voice, for the phrase \"sticking fast\" had drawn a laugh from some of his hearers; but Dion, whose father had really amassed, in the high position of a receiver of taxes, the handsome fortune which his son possessed, did not delay his reply.  \"Yes, yes,\" he retorted scornfully, \"yonder Syrian babbler hit the mark this time.  He stands before me, and who does not easily stick fast when marsh and mire are so near?  As for the hyacinthine purple cloak, I wear it because I like it.  His crocus-yellow one is less to my taste, though he certainly looks fine enough in it in the sunlight.  It shines like a buttercup in the grass.  You know the plant.  When it fades--and I ask whether you think Philostratus looks like a bud--when it fades, it leaves a hollow spiral ball which a child's breath could blow away.  Suppose in future we should call the round buttercup seed-vessels 'Philostratus heads'?  You like the suggestion?  I am glad, fellow-citizens, and I thank you.  It proves your good taste.  Then we will stick to the comparison.  Every head contains a tongue, and Philostratus says that his is the tool which supports him.\"  \"Hear the money-bag, the despiser of the people!\"  interrupted Philostratus furiously.  \"The honest toil by which a citizen earns a livelihood is a disgrace in his eyes.\"  \"Honest toil, my good friend,\" replied Dion, \"is scarcely in question here.  I spoke only of your tongue.--You understand me, fellow-citizens. Or, if any of you are not yet acquainted with this worthy man, I will show him to you, for I know him well.  He is my foe, yet I can sincerely recommend him to many of you.  If any one has a very bad, shamefully corrupt cause to bring before the courts, I most earnestly counsel him to apply to the buttercup man perched on yonder fountain.  He will thank me for it.  Believe me, Didymus's cause is just, precisely because this advocate so eagerly assails it.  I told you just now the matter under discussion.  Which of you who owns a garden can say in future, 'It is mine,' if, during the absence of the Queen, it is allowable to take it away to be used for any other purpose?  But this is what threatens Didymus.  If this is to be the custom here, let every one beware of sowing a radish or planting a bush or a tree, for should the wife of some great noble desire to dry her linen there, he may be deprived of it ere the former can ripen or the latter give shade.\"  Loud applause followed this sentence, but Philostratus shouted in a voice that echoed far and wide: \"Hear me, fellow-citizens; do not allow your selves to be deceived!  No one is to be robbed here.  The project is to purchase, at a high price, the spot which the city needs for her adornment, and to honour and please the Queen.  Are the Regent and the citizens to lose this opportunity of expressing the gratitude of years, and the rejoicing over the greatest of victories, of which we shall soon hear, because an evil-disposed person--the word must be uttered--a foe to his country, opposes it?\"  \"Now the mire is coming too near me,\" Dion angrily responded, \"and I might really stick fast, as I was warned; for I do not envy the ready presence of mind of any person whose tongue would not falter when the basest slander scattered its venom over him.  You all know, fellow- citizens, through how many generations the Didymus family has lived to the honour of this city, doing praiseworthy work in yonder house.  You know that the good old man who dwells there was one of the teachers of the royal children.\"  \"And yet,\" cried Philostratus, \"only the day before yesterday he walked arm in arm in the Paneum garden with Arius, the tutor of Octavianus, our own and our Queen's most hated foe.  In my presence, and before I know not how many others, Didymus distinguished this Arius as his most beloved pupil.\"  \"To give you that title,\" retorted Dion, \"would certainly fill any teacher with shame and anger, no matter how far you had surpassed him in wisdom and knowledge.  Nay, had you been committed to the care of the herring dealers, instead of the rhetoricians, every honest man among them would disown you, for they sell only good wares for good money, while you give the poorest in exchange for glittering gold.  This time you trample under foot the fair name of an honourable man.  But I will not suffer it; and you hear, fellow-citizens, I now challenge this Syrian to prove that Didymus ever betrayed his native land, or I will brand him in your presence a base slanderer, an infamous, venal destroyer of character!\"  \"An insult from such lips is easily borne,\" replied Philostratus in a tone of scornful superiority; but there was a pause ere he again turned to the listening throng, and with all the warmth he could throw into his voice continued: \"What do I desire, then, fellow-citizens?  What is the sole object of my words?  I stand here with clean hands, impelled solely by the impulse of my heart, to plead for the Queen.  In order to secure the only suitable site for the statues to be erected to Cleopatra's honour and fame, I enter into judgment with her foes, expose myself to the insult with which boastful insolence is permitted to vent its wrath upon me.  But I am not dismayed, though, in pursuing this course, I am acting against the law of Nature; for the infamous man against whom I raise my voice was my teacher, too, and ere he turned from the path of right and virtue--under influences which I will not mention here--he numbered me also, in the presence of many witnesses, among his best pupils.  I was certainly one of the most grateful--I chose his granddaughter--the truth must be spoken--for my wife.  The possession--\"  \"Possession!\" interrupted Dion in a loud, excited tone.  \"The corpse cast ashore by the waves might as well boast possession of the sea!\"  The dim torchlight was sufficient to reveal Philostratus's pallor to the bystanders.  For a moment the orator seemed to lose his self-control, but he quickly recovered himself, and shouted: \"Fellow-citizens, dear friends!  I was about to make you witnesses of the misery which a woman, whose wickedness is even greater than her beauty, brought upon an inexperienced--\"  But he went no further; for his hearers--many of whom knew the brilliant, generous Dion, and Barine, the fair singer at the last Adonis festival-- gave the orator tokens of their indignation, which were all the more pitiless because of the pleasure they felt in seeing an expert vanquished by an untrained foe.  The wordy war would not have ended so quickly, however, had not restlessness and alarm taken possession of the crowd. The shout, \"Back! disperse!\" ran through the multitude, and directly after the trampling of hoofs and the commands of the leader of a troop of Libyan cavalry were heard.  The matter at stake was not sufficiently important to induce the populace to offer an armed force resistance which might have entailed serious danger.  Besides, the blustering war of tongues had reached a merry close, and loud laughter blended with the shouts of fear and warning; for the surging throng had swept with unexpected speed towards the fountain and plunged Philostratus into the basin.  Whether this was due to the wrath of some enemy, or to mere accident, could not be learned; the vain efforts of the luckless man to crawl out of the water up the smooth marble were so comical, and his gestures, after helping hands had dragged him dripping upon the pavement of the square, were so irresistibly funny, that more laughing than angry voices were "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5473"],["title","Cleopatra — Volume 01 (#8)"],["body","heard, especially when some one cried, \"His hands were soiled by blackening Didymus, so the washing will do him good.\"  \"Some wise physicians flung him into the water,\" retorted an other;  \"he needed the cold application after the blows Dion dealt him.\"  The Regent, who had sent the troop of horsemen to drive the crowd away from Didymus's house, might well be pleased that the violent measure encountered so little resistance.  The throng quickly scattered, and was speedily attracted by something new at the Theatre of Dionysus--the zither-player Anaxenor had just announced from its steps that Cleopatra and Antony had won the most brilliant victory, and had sung to the accompaniment of his lute a hymn which had deeply stirred all hearts.  He had composed it long before, and seized the first opportunity--the report had reached his ears while breakfasting in Kanopus--to try its effect.  As soon as the square began to empty, Barine left her post of observation.  It was long since her heart had throbbed so violently. Not one of the many suitors for her favour had been so dear to her as Dion; but she now felt that she loved him.  What he had just done for her and her grandfather was worthy of the deepest gratitude; it proved that he did not come to her house, like most of her guests, merely to while away the evening hours.  It had been no small matter for the young aristocrat, in the presence of the whole multitude, to enter into a debate with the infamous Philostratus, and how well he had succeeded in silencing the dreaded orator!  Besides, Dion had even taken her part against his own powerful uncle, and perhaps by his deed drawn upon himself the hostility of his enemy's brother, Alexas, Antony's powerful favourite.  Barine might assure herself that he, who was the peer of any Macedonian noble in the city, would have done this for no one else.  She felt as if the act had ransomed her.  When, after an unhappy marriage and many desolate days, she had regained her former bright cheerfulness and saw her house become the centre of the intellectual life of the city, she had striven until now to extend the same welcome to all her guests.  She had perceived that she ought not to give any one the power over her which is possessed by the man who knows that he is beloved, and even to Dion she had granted little more than to the others.  But now she saw plainly that she would resign the pleasure of being a universally admired woman, whose modest home attracted the most distinguished men in the city, for the far greater happiness which would be hers as Dion's beloved wife.  With him, cherished by his love, she believed that she could find far greater joy in solitude than in the gay course of her present life.  She knew now what she must do if Dion sought her, and the architect, for the first time, found her a silent companion.  He had willingly accompanied her back to her grandfather's house, where he had again met her sister Helena, while she had quitted it disappointed, because her brave defender had not returned there.  After the interruption of the debate Dion had been in a very cheerful mood.  The pleasant sensation of having championed a good cause, and the delightful consciousness of success were not new to him, but he had rarely felt so uplifted as now.  He most ardently longed for his next meeting with Barine, and imagined how he would describe what had happened and claim her gratitude for his friendly service.  The scene had risen clearly before his mind, but scarcely had the radiant vision of the future faded when the unusually bright expression of his manly face was clouded by a grave and troubled one.  The darkness of the night, illumined only by the flare of the pitch-pans, had surrounded him, yet it had seemed as if he were standing with Barine in the full light of noon in the blossoming garden of his own palace, and, after asking a reward for his sturdy championship, she had clung to him with deep emotion, and he had passionately kissed her tearful face.  The face had quickly vanished, yet it had been as distinct as the most vivid picture in a dream.  Was Barine more to him than he supposed?  Had he not been drawn to her, during the past few months, by the mere charm of her pliant intellect and her bright beauty?  Had a new, strong passion awakened within him?  Was he in danger of seeing the will which urged him to preserve his freedom conquered?  Had he cause to fear that some day, constrained by a mysterious, invincible power, in defiance of the opposition of calm reason, he might perhaps bind himself for life to this Barine, the woman who had once been the wife of a Philostratus, and who bestowed her smiles on all who found admittance to her house seeking a feast for the eye, a banquet for the ear, a pleasant entertainment?  Though her honor was as stainless as the breast of a swan--and he had no reason to doubt it--she would still be classed with Aspasia and other women whose guests sought more than songs and agreeable conversations. The gifts with which the gods had so lavishly endowed her had already been shared with too many to permit him, the last scion of a noble Macedonian house, to think of leading her, as mistress, to the palace whose erection he had so carefully and successfully planned with Gorgias.  Surely it lacked nothing save the gracious rule of a mistress.  But if she should consent to become his without the blessing of Hymen? No.  He could not thus dishonor the granddaughter of Didymus, the man who had been his father's revered teacher, a woman whom he had always rejoiced that, spite of the gay freedom with which she received so many admirers, he could still esteem.  He would not do so, though his friends would have greeted such scruples with a smile of superiority.  Who revered the sacredness of marriage in a city whose queen was openly living for the second time with the husband of another?  Dion himself had formed many a brief connection, but for that very reason he could not place a woman like Barine on the same footing with those whose love he had perhaps owed solely to his wealth.  He had never lacked courage and resolution, but he felt that this time he would have to resist a power with which he had never coped.  That accursed face!  Again and again it rose before his mental vision, smiling and beckoning so sweetly that the day must come when the yearning to realize the dream would conquer all opposition.  If he remained near her he would inevitably do what he might afterwards regret, and therefore he would fain have offered a sacrifice to Peitho to induce her to enhance Archibius's powers of persuasion and induce Barine to leave Alexandria. It would be hard for him to part from her, yet much would be gained if she went into the country.  Between the present and the distant period of a second meeting lay respite from peril, and perhaps the possibility of victory.  Dion did not recognize himself.  He seemed as unstable as a swaying reed, because he had conquered his wish to re-enter old Didymus's house and encourage him, and passed on to his own home.  But he would probably have found Barine still with her grandfather, and he would not meet her, though every fibre of his being longed for her face, her voice, and a word of gratitude from her beloved lips.  Instead of joy, he was filled with the sense of dissatisfaction which overpowers a man standing at a crossing in the roads, who sees before him three goals, yet can be fully content with neither.  The Street of the King, along which he suffered himself to be carried by the excited throng, ran between the sea and the Theatre of Dionysus.  The thought darted through his mind that his friend the architect desired to erect the luckless statues of the royal lovers in front of this stately building.  He would divert his thoughts by examining the site which Gorgias had chosen.  The zither-player finished his hymn just as Dion approached the theatre, and the crowd began to disperse.  Every one was full of the joyful tidings of victory, and one shouted to another what Anaxenor, the favourite of the great Antony, who must surely know, had just recited in thrilling verse.  Many a joyous Io and loud Evoe to Cleopatra, the new Isis, and Antony, the new Dionysus, resounded through the air, while bearded and smooth, delicate Greek and thick Egyptian lips joined in the shout, \"To the Sebasteum!\"  This was the royal palace, which faced the government building containing the Regent's residence.  The populace desired to have the delightful news confirmed, and to express, by a public demonstration, the grateful joy which filled every heart.  Dion, too, was eager to obtain certainty, and, though usually averse to mingling with the populace during such noisy outbursts of feeling, he was preparing to follow the crowd thronging towards the Sebasteum, when the shouts of runners clearing a passage for a closed litter fell upon his ear.  It was occupied by Iras, the Queen's trusted attendant.  If any one could give accurate information, it was she; yet it would hardly be possible to gain an opportunity of conversing with her in this throng.  But Iras must have had a different opinion; she had seen Dion, and now called him to her side.  There were hoarse tones in her voice, usually so clear and musical, which betrayed the emotion raging in her breast as she assailed the young Macedonian noble with a flood of questions.  Without giving him the usual greeting, she hastily desired to know what was exciting the people, who had brought the tidings of victory, and whither the multitude was flocking?  Dion had found it difficult not to be forced from the litter while answering.  Iris perceived this, and as they were just passing the Maeander, the labyrinth, which was closed after sunset, she ordered her bearers to carry the litter to the entrance, made herself known to the watchman, ordered the outer court to be opened, the litter to be placed there, and the bearers"]]]
