It was fortunate that he had borrowed his grandfather’s long stocking for the occasion; for his own little sock could never have contained the beautiful, large humming-top, and the pretty Noah’s ark, which now met his eyes. And then the large, soft ball, just right for playing in the house in stormy weather; and the nice transparent slate, with which Willie could amuse himself when the older folks wished him to be quiet. All these things, and many more, were safely packed away in grandpa’s great stocking. Papers of candy, stores of nuts and almonds, and pretty little lady-apples, came to light as Willie continued his search; and last of all, in a tiny wooden box, was found a bright gold dollar.  “I am sure grandpa must have put that in himself,” said Willie; “for I saw a gold dollar in his desk-drawer yesterday. But oh, mother! did you ever see so many pretty things? Am I not very happy?”  “I hope so, indeed, my dear boy,” answered Mrs. Duncan, smiling; “but pretty things do not always make us happy.”  “Not unless we are good, you mean, mother. But I will try to be good. Only look at this humming-top!”  “It is a fine one, Willie. Here is a cord. Try if you can spin it.”  The top was soon whirling merrily upon the floor, and humming so loudly that Willie had to clap his hands once more; and even baby, who was pillowed up in his crib, unpacking his own wee little stocking, dropped the china pussy-cat, which he had just taken out, and stretched his little hands toward the top, crowing with delight.  But now mother said that both Willie and baby must put by their toys, and be dressed for breakfast; and she gave Willie a basket to put all his new treasures into, that he might carry them down stairs easily, and exhibit them to his father.  “And what will you buy with the gold dollar, Willie?” asked Mr. Duncan, after he had examined and admired all the pretty gifts.  Willie looked very thoughtful as he replied, “I should like to do some good with it, father. I think I ought to,—do not you?”  “We ought always to try to do good, Willie; but I am not sure that I quite understand what you mean.”  “I heard you say the other day, father, that we should love to share with others the blessings which the Lord gives to us.”  “That is right, my son: I did say something of the kind.”  “Well, father, I have a great many blessings this morning,—all these pretty toys; and so I think I ought to spend the gold dollar for other people.”  “I am glad you think so, Willie. And who would you like to spend it for?”  “If you are willing, father, I should like to give it to lame Georgie to buy a book. He told me, a few days ago, that he wanted very much to buy a book called ‘Rollo at Work,’ because there is a story in it about a lame boy named Georgie, just like him. You know Georgie’s father is poor; and I do not think he can spare the money to buy a book. May I give him my dollar, father?”  “Certainly, Willie: you may take it to him as soon as you have eaten your breakfast.”  Willie’s eyes sparkled with delight. His breakfast was quickly eaten, and his warm comforter and mittens put on.  “May I go to the bookstore and buy the book for Georgie, if he wishes me to, mother?” he asked; “and may I stay with him a little while?”  Mrs. Duncan readily granted her permission; for although Georgie’s father and mother were poor, yet they were very worthy people, and had taught him to be an obedient, good boy, so that Willie’s parents were quite willing that he should sometimes go to play with him.  Willie found Georgie sitting in his usual seat by the fireside, with a small stand placed near him, on which were a little box and a new gimlet.  “O Willie,” he exclaimed joyfully, as Willie entered, “I am so glad you have come! Only see what nice Christmas-gifts I have got! Father bought me this new gimlet; and a kind lady, who comes to see my mother sometimes, sent me this pretty dissected map. I have been playing with it all the morning.”  As Georgie spoke, he opened the box which stood upon the stand, and showed Willie that it contained a map of the world, cut into small pieces, which could all be neatly fitted together. Willie had several maps of this kind at home; and he was just going to say that he did not think this was much of a present, and to tell Georgie how many pretty toys he had received, when he remembered that it would not be kind to do so; and he said, pleasantly,—  “It is a very pretty map, Georgie: I am glad the lady gave it to you. And what a nice gimlet! You can bore large holes with this.”  “Yes,” replied Georgie: “you know I have a small one; and I have wanted a large one for a long time. But tell me about your presents, Willie; for I am sure you have had a great many.”  “Yes, I have had a good many,” answered Willie; “and I have brought one of them to you.”  So saying, Willie took out the little box, which contained the gold dollar, and handed it to Georgie.  “What a pretty little box!” said Georgie: “I never saw so small a one in my life. Thank you, Willie!”  “Open it, Georgie!” exclaimed Willie, laughing: “it has got your new book in it.”  “My new book!” said Georgie: “it must be a very small one, then. O Willie, what a beautiful gold dollar!” he exclaimed, as he took off the cover. “Do you mean to give all this to me?”  “Yes, Georgie: it is to buy the book that you want so much.”  “You are _very_ kind, Willie! I shall be so happy to have that book! I wish I could walk to the bookstore, and I would go for it this minute.”  “I can go,” replied Willie. “Mother gave me leave; and, when I come back, we will read the book, Georgie, and I will tell you all about my presents; for I can stay with you a while.”  Georgie was very glad to hear this; and Willie took the gold dollar, and ran joyfully away.  He very soon returned, with the much-wished-for book in his hand.  “Here it is, Georgie,” he said; “and here is a half-dollar in change: that is enough to buy another book, if you wish.“  “But I think you ought to keep the half-dollar, Willie. This book is enough for you to give me. I am sure I am very much obliged to you.”  “Oh, no, Georgie! I meant to give you the whole dollar. Shall I run back to the bookstore, and buy another Rollo book? There are a great many different kinds.”  Georgie thought for a moment; and then he said,—  “No, Willie: I think it would not be right. I have my new map, my gimlet, and this pretty book: I am very happy to have such beautiful presents. And now, if you are so kind as to give me this half-dollar, I should like to buy something to give to some one who is not so happy as I am.”  “That is right, Georgie,” said Willie. “Father says we should always be willing to share our blessings with others. But what will you buy, Georgie?”  “There is a little girl in the other part of this house,” replied Georgie, “who has been ill for a long time. Her mother is poor, and cannot buy her many nice things, such as sick people need. I think I should like to buy some nice grapes with the half-dollar, and give them to her for Christmas.”  “Oh, yes, Georgie!” exclaimed Willie. “She will like them, I am sure: for once, when I was ill, my mother bought a bunch of grapes for me; and they tasted so good!”  Georgie’s mother now came into the room; and Georgie showed her the book, and asked her if he could buy grapes for the sick girl with the half-dollar. She was quite willing, and said that she was going out for a little while, and would take the money, and buy the grapes.  “And please come home before Willie goes away, mother,” said Georgie; “for I want him to go with me to give Mary the grapes.”  Georgie’s mother said she would not stay long; and then she put on her bonnet and shawl, and went away, while the two little boys amused themselves very pleasantly with the new book and the map. Willie also told Georgie about his Christmas-gifts, and promised to bring the humming-top to show him the next time that he came.  Very soon Georgie’s mother came, with a paper containing some beautiful bunches of white grapes; and Georgie took his crutches, which he was obliged to use in walking, and, asking Willie to bring the grapes, he led the way to the part of the house where little Mary and her mother lived.  They found the little sick girl lying upon a small cot-bed. Every thing was very neat and clean about her; and although she looked very pale and sick, yet her countenance was cheerful and pleasant; and she smiled sweetly when she saw the little boys.  “I wish you a merry Christmas, Georgie,” she said; “and I am very glad you have come to see me; for I have something so beautiful to show you! Please, mother, bring it to me.”  Her mother brought a tumbler containing a pretty little bunch of flowers, and held it close to Mary.  “Only look, Georgie!” continued the little girl, as she stretched out her small, white hand, and gently touched the flowers; “are they not beautiful? The kind doctor who comes to see me sometimes sent them to me for Christmas. They smell _so_ sweet!”  “They are beautiful, Mary,” said Georgie. “I am very glad that you have got them; and Willie and I have brought you something for Christmas, too.”  As he spoke, he took the paper of grapes from Willie’s hands, and gave it to Mary’s mother, saying,—  “Will you please to put a bunch upon a plate, and give them to Mary?”  “O Mary! this is just what I have wanted to give you when your mouth is so hot and parched,” exclaimed her mother. “I am sure we thank you very much, Georgie.”  “Willie gave me the money,” replied Georgie. “He gave me a gold dollar to buy a book: but it cost only half a dollar; and so we could buy grapes for Mary.”  “They are _very_ nice,” said the little girl, as her mother carefully removed the skin from one of the grapes, and placed it in her mouth. “I thank you, Georgie; and I thank Willie, too: I am glad he"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/54803"],["title","Playing Santa Claus, and Other Christmas Tales (#4)"],["body"," to see me.”  “I will come again, Mary,” said Willie, going up to the bedside: “and I will bring you one of my boxes of guava jelly; for I had two in my Christmas stocking. Sick people can eat guava jelly; and you will like it, I am sure.”  Mary’s mother did not like to have the little girl talk long at one time: so Georgie and Willie bade her good-by, and went away; and very soon it was time for Willie to go home.  His mother was much pleased to hear about his visit; and she said, “Your gold dollar has made several people happy,—has it not Willie?”  “Yes, mother. It made grandpa happy to give it to me; and it made me happy to give it to Georgie; and then Georgie was happy to give the grapes to the little girl; and she and her mother were both happy to have them. I am glad that my gold dollar has given so many people pleasure, mother.”  “And I am glad also, Willie. It is good to love to share with others the blessings which the Lord gives to us.”                             THE THANKSGIVING PARTY.   “Oh, mother, mother!” exclaimed Lucy Welford, as she bounded into her mother’s room, one bright, frosty morning in November, “Uncle John is in the parlor, and he has come to ask you if he may take Mary and me home with him to pass Thanksgiving. O, please, mother, let us go. Thanksgiving in the country is so delightful, much more so than in the city. Such fine sleigh-rides, and such grand slides on the pond.”  “And the delicious pumpkin pies, and the roast turkeys, and the bowls of sweet milk and cream,” continued Mary, who had followed her sister to hear their mother’s decision. “Oh, it will be so pleasant. And only think, mother, Uncle John is going to have a large party—a regular feast—he says; and Aunt Clara thinks that Lucy and I can assist her very much if you will be so kind as to let us go.”  “Very well,” replied their mother, smiling; “we will go and talk with Uncle John about it, and see if father thinks he can spare both of his girls for a few days.”  To the great joy of Mary and Lucy, father and mother at length gave their consent; and, warmly wrapped in hoods and cloaks, with a large carpet-bag to contain such articles as would be necessary for them during their stay, they sprang lightly into Uncle John’s comfortable sleigh, and with many a kind good-by to the dear ones at home, were soon riding swiftly away, leaving far behind the various sights and sounds of the busy city.  A pleasant ride of fifteen miles brought them to the old-fashioned farm house, where the sound of the merry bells soon called Aunt Clara to the door, and with a most affectionate welcome, she embraced her young nieces, and expressed her joy that their parents had consented to spare them to her for a short time.  The ride in the fresh air had given the girls fine rosy cheeks and excellent appetites, and they were quite ready to accept Aunt Clara’s invitation to take a luncheon of bread and milk, and some of her nice doughnuts.  “And now, dear aunt, do tell us all about the party,” exclaimed Lucy. “Will there be any young folks, or is it only for grown up people like you and Uncle John? We tried to make him tell us about it as we rode along; but he only laughed, and said we should find out when the day came.”  “There will be both young and old,” replied their aunt, smiling, “about fifty in all; so you see I shall be much in need of your assistance in entertaining so large a company.”  “We will do everything we can to help you,” said Mary, “and we have brought our new winter frocks to wear, and new ribbons for our hair; and mother said, if anything else was needed, we could send her word to-morrow, as Uncle John said he should be obliged to go into town.”  “Oh, your dress will do very well, I have no doubt,” replied her aunt. “Our friends are not very showy people, and will come in plain attire. But I must leave you and Lucy to entertain yourselves for a short time, as a part of my morning work is unfinished. I suppose you will not be at a loss for amusement.”  “Not at all,” answered both of the girls. “We will go to the barn, and find Uncle John, and see if our old pets among the sheep and the cows have forgotten us.”  The remainder of the day passed pleasantly away, and the girls were so much fatigued with the unusual exercise they had taken in running about the farm, that they were quite glad when bed-time came, and slept soundly until the bright rays of the morning sun were beaming in at their window.  “To-morrow will be the day for the party,” exclaimed Lucy, as she and her sister hastened to dress for breakfast, fearful that they had already kept their aunt waiting. “I expect to enjoy it so much.”  “So do I,” replied Mary. “I am very glad that there are young people coming. There are some sweet little girls in the neighborhood. I hope Aunt Clara has invited Mrs. Carlton’s family. They live in the great white house on the hill, and are very genteel, pleasant people.”  “No doubt they will be here,” returned Lucy, “and the Wilsons and Smiths, and, perhaps, Mr. Marion’s family. There must be many others coming whom we do not know, for aunt said there would be about fifty guests. O, I am sure it will be delightful!”  Breakfast over, Aunt Clara soon found abundance of work for her two young assistants. There were nutmegs to grate, eggs to beat, apples to pare, meat to mince, and various other employments, which the girls found very interesting. The tables were soon loaded with pies, cakes, warm bread, and every variety of eatables, while turkeys and chickens by the dozen were in a state of preparation, and the large pots over the fire were filled with the nice hams which Uncle John had provided for the occasion. Everything showed that there was to be a bountiful feast, and our young friends danced for joy, as they thought of the pleasure in store for them.  The much wished for day came at length, and a bright and beautiful day it was. The guests were expected to assemble about noon, and by eleven o’clock, Lucy and Mary, having assisted their aunt in preparing the long table in the dining-room, hastened to their own apartment to dress, that they might be in readiness to receive them.  The great double sleigh with the pretty gray ponies was already harnessed, for some of the visitors, as Uncle John observed, lived at quite a distance from the farm, and he had promised to send for them at the proper time.  “Very kind in Uncle John,” observed Mary to her sister, “but I should think they would prefer coming in their own carriages.”  “But it is so pleasant to load up that old double sleigh,” returned Lucy. “The younger part of the company will enjoy the arrangement exceedingly. Just tie this bow for me, Mary, and then, I believe, we are all ready. Let us go down at once. I have no doubt that a part of the company have arrived.”  But the parlors were still empty. Even Aunt Clara had not yet appeared, and after surveying themselves with much satisfaction in the large mirror, and impatiently walking up and down the room for a short time, the girls resolved to seek her, and inquire if the appointed dinner hour had not nearly arrived. To their surprise, they found the table already loaded with the smoking plum puddings, and nicely roasted turkeys and chickens, which Uncle John and Aunt Clara were carrying with all possible despatch.  “But no one has come yet, Uncle John,” exclaimed both Lucy and Mary in a breath. “Will not the dinner be cold?”  “Our friends have all arrived,” was their uncle’s quiet reply; and as he spoke, the door leading from the great kitchen was thrown open, and a crowd of persons, young and old, appeared.  There was the honest laborer, who had toiled hard through the year for the support of his large family. There, too, was the cheerful wife and the joyful little ones, and, perhaps, the aged grand-parents, whose feeble steps were supported by their children, as they took their seats at the bountifully spread table. In short, most of the worthy poor in the immediate vicinity of the farm were there assembled, and some few from a greater distance.  Mary and Lucy had not time to recover from their surprise, before all the guests were seated at the table, and Uncle John, rising from his chair, bade them all a kindly welcome, and after explaining in a few words the origin of Thanksgiving Day, asked them all to unite with him in a prayer of thankfulness to the Lord, from whom every mercy is received.  Each guest was then plentifully supplied with the good things upon the table, and Aunt Clara requested her nieces to attend particularly to the little children, and see that all their wants were cared for.  A happier party was seldom seen. After dinner, presents of food and clothing were distributed among them, and Mary and Lucy found great satisfaction in dressing the children in new clothes, and seeing the gratitude and joy in their smiling little faces.  After an hour or two spent in this manner, the great sleigh and the gray horses came merrily jingling to the door, and the old people and the children were safely conveyed to their homes, and the rest of the party, with many thanks and blessings to their kind entertainers, took their leave.  “Well, girls, how did you enjoy my party?” exclaimed Uncle John, as he reëntered the parlor, after bidding farewell to the last of his guests.  “O, very much indeed,” was the reply. “It was very different from what we expected, but still we enjoyed it very much. It is so pleasant to make others happy.”  “It is, indeed, my children,” returned Uncle John, “and it appears to me that on a day like this, it is the duty of all those whom the Lord has blessed with abundance, to seek out the needy and afflicted, and endeavor to relieve their wants.”  When the harvest is gathered in, and the farmer beholds his table loaded with the rich fruits of the year, he should call upon the aged, the poor, and the helpless to come in with him and share his feast.                                A CHRISTMAS STORY."]]]
