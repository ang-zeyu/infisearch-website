CHAPTER I  THE WATERBURY WATCH   One Saturday afternoon in January a lively and animated group of boys were gathered on the western side of a large pond in the village of Groveton. Prominent among them was a tall, pleasant-looking young man of twenty-two, the teacher of the Center Grammar School, Frederic Hooper, A. B., a recent graduate of Yale College. Evidently there was something of importance on foot. What it was may be learned from the words of the teacher.  \"Now, boys,\" he said, holding in his hand a Waterbury watch, of neat pattern, \"I offer this watch as a prize to the boy who will skate across the pond and back in the least time. You will all start together, at a given signal, and make your way to the mark which I have placed at the western end of the lake, skate around it, and return to this point. Do you fully understand?\"  \"Yes, sir!\" exclaimed the boys, unanimously.  Before proceeding, it may be well to refer more particularly to some of the boys who were to engage in the contest.  First, in his own estimation, came Randolph Duncan, son of Prince Duncan, president of the Groveton Bank, and a prominent town official. Prince Duncan was supposed to be a rich man, and lived in a style quite beyond that of his neighbors. Randolph was his only son, a boy of sixteen, and felt that in social position and blue blood he was without a peer in the village. He was a tall, athletic boy, and disposed to act the part of boss among the Groveton boys.  Next came a boy similar in age and physical strength, but in other respects very different from the young aristocrat. This was Luke Larkin, the son of a carpenter's widow, living on narrow means, and so compelled to exercise the strictest economy. Luke worked where he could, helping the farmers in hay-time, and ready to do odd jobs for any one in the village who desired his services. He filled the position of janitor at the school which he attended, sweeping out twice a week and making the fires. He had a pleasant expression, and a bright, resolute look, a warm heart, and a clear intellect, and was probably, in spite of his poverty, the most popular boy in Groveton. In this respect he was the opposite of Randolph Duncan, whose assumption of superiority and desire to \"boss\" the other boys prevented him from having any real friends. He had two or three companions, who flattered him and submitted to his caprices because they thought it looked well to be on good terms with the young aristocrat.  These two boys were looked upon as the chief contestants for the prize offered by their teacher. Opinions differed as to which would win.  \"I think Luke will get the watch,\" said Fred Acken, a younger boy.  \"I don't know about that,\" said Tom Harper. \"Randolph skates just as well, and he has a pair of club skates. His father sent to New York for them last week. They're beauties, I tell you. Randolph says they cost ten dollars.\"  \"Of course that gives him the advantage,\" said Percy Hall. \"Look at Luke's old-fashioned wooden skates! They would be dear at fifty cents!\"  \"It's a pity Luke hasn't a better pair,\" said Harry Wright. \"I don't think the contest is a fair one. Luke ought to have an allowance of twenty rods, to make up for the difference in skates.\"  \"He wouldn't accept it,\" said Linton Tomkins, the son of a manufacturer in Groveton, who was an intimate friend of Luke, and preferred to associate with him, though Randolph had made advances toward intimacy, Linton being the only boy in the village whom he regarded as his social equal. \"I offered him my club skates, but he said he would take the chances with his own.\"  Linton was the only boy who had a pair of skates equal to Randolph's. He, too, was a contestant, but, being three years younger than Luke and Randolph, had no expectation of rivaling them.  Randolph had his friends near him, administering the adulation he so much enjoyed.  \"I have no doubt you'll get the watch, Randolph,\" said Sam Noble. \"You're a better skater any day than Luke Larkin.\"  \"Of course you are!\" chimed in Tom Harper.  \"The young janitor doesn't think so,\" said Randolph, his lips curling.  \"Oh, he's conceited enough to think he can beat you, I make no doubt,\" said Sam.  \"On those old skates, too! They look as if Adam might have used them when he was a boy!\"  This sally of Tom's created a laugh.  \"His skates are old ones, to be sure,\" said Randolph, who was quick-sighted enough to understand that any remark of this kind might dim the luster of his expected victory. \"His skates are old enough, but they are just as good for skating as mine.\"  \"They won't win him the watch, though,\" said Sam.  \"I don't care for the watch myself,\" said Randolph, loftily. \"I've got a silver one now, and am to have a gold one when I'm eighteen. But I want to show that I am the best skater. Besides, father has promised me ten dollars if I win.\"  \"I wish I had ten dollars,\" said Sam, enviously.  He was the son of the storekeeper, and his father allowed him only ten cents a week pocket-money, so that ten dollars in his eyes was a colossal fortune.  \"I have no doubt you would, Sam,\" said Tom, joyously; \"but you couldn't be trusted with so much money. You'd go down to New York and try to buy out A. T. Stewart.\"  \"Are you ready, boys?\" asked Mr. Hooper.  Most of the boys responded promptly in the affirmative; but Luke, who had been tightening his straps, said quickly: \"I am not ready, Mr. Hooper. My strap has broken!\"  \"Indeed, Luke, I am sorry to hear it,\" said the teacher, approaching and examining the fracture. \"As matters stand, you can't skate.\"  Randolph's eyes brightened. Confident as he professed to feel, he knew that his chances of success would be greatly increased by Luke's withdrawal from the list.  \"The prize is yours now,\" whispered Tom.  \"It was before,\" answered Randolph, conceitedly.  Poor Luke looked disappointed. He knew that he had at least an even chance of winning, and he wanted the watch. Several of his friends of his own age had watches, either silver or Waterbury, and this seemed, in his circumstances, the only chance of securing one. Now he was apparently barred out.  \"It's a pity you shouldn't skate, Luke,\" said Mr. Hooper, in a tone of sympathy. \"You are one of the best skaters, and had an excellent chance of winning the prize. Is there any boy willing to lend Luke his skates?\"  \"I will,\" said Frank Acken.  \"My dear boy,\" said the teacher, \"you forget that your feet are several sizes smaller than Luke's.\"  \"I didn't think of that,\" replied Frank, who was only twelve years old.  \"You may use my skates, Luke,\" said Linton Tomkins. \"I think they will fit you.\"  Linton was only thirteen, but he was unusually large for his age.  \"You are very kind, Linton,\" said Luke, \"but that will keep you out of the race.\"  \"I stand no chance of winning,\" said Linton, \"and I will do my skating afterward.\"  \"I don't think that fair,\" said Randolph, with a frown. \"Each boy ought to use his own skates.\"  \"There is nothing unfair about it,\" said the teacher, \"except that Luke is placed at disadvantage in using a pair of skates he is unaccustomed to.\"  Randolph did not dare gainsay the teacher, but he looked sullen.  \"Mr. Hooper is always favoring that beggar!\" he said in a low voice, to Tom Harper.  \"Of course he is!\" chimed in the toady.  \"You are very kind, Linny,\" said Luke, regarding his friend affectionately. \"I won't soon forget it.\"  \"Oh, it's all right, Luke,\" said Linton. \"Now go in and win!\"    CHAPTER II  TOM HARPER'S ACCIDENT   Tom Harper and Sam Noble were not wholly disinterested in their championship of Randolph. They were very ordinary skaters, and stood no chance of winning the match themselves. They wished Randolph to win, for each hoped, as he had a silver watch himself already, he might give the Waterbury to his faithful friend and follower. Nothing in Randolph's character granted such a hope, for he was by no means generous or open-handed, but each thought that he might open his heart on this occasion. Indeed, Tom ventured to hint as much.  \"I suppose, Randolph,\" he said, \"if you win the watch you will give it to me?\"  \"Why should I?\" asked Randolph, surveying Tom with a cold glance.  \"You've got a nice silver watch yourself, you know.\"  \"I might like to have two watches.\"  \"You'll have the ten dollars your father promised you.\"  \"What if I have? What claim have you on me?\"  Tom drew near and whispered something in Randolph's ear.  \"I'll see about it,\" said Randolph, nodding.  \"Are you ready?\" asked the teacher, once more.  \"Aye, aye!\" responded the boys.  \"One--two--three--go!\"  The boys darted off like arrows from a bow. Luke made a late start, but before they were half across the pond he was even with Randolph, and both were leading. Randolph looked sidewise, and shut his mouth tight as he saw his hated rival on equal terms with him and threatening to pass him. It would be humiliating in the extreme, he thought, to be beaten by such a boy.  But beaten he seemed likely to be, for Luke was soon a rod in advance and slowly gaining. Slowly, for Randolph was really a fine skater and had no rival except Luke. But Luke was his superior, as seemed likely to be proved.  Though only these two stood any chance of final success, all the boys kept up the contest.  A branch of a tree had been placed at the western end of the pond, and this was the mark around which the boys were to skate. Luke made the circuit first, Randolph being about half a dozen rods behind. After him came the rest of the boys in procession, with one exception. This exception was Tom Harper, who apparently gave up the contest when half-way across, and began skating about, here and there, apparently waiting for his companions to return.  \"Tom Harper has given up his chance,\" said Linton to the teacher.  \"So it seems,\" replied"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5417"],["title","Struggling Upward, or Luke Larkin's Luck (#1)"],["body",". Hooper, \"but he probably had no expectation of succeeding.\"  \"I should think he would have kept on with the rest. I would have done so, though my chance would have been no better than his.\"  Indeed, it seemed strange that Tom should have given up so quickly. It soon appeared that it was not caprice, but that he had an object in view, and that a very discreditable one.  He waited till the boys were on their way back. By this time Luke was some eight rods in advance of his leading competitor. Then Tom began to be on the alert. As Luke came swinging on to victory he suddenly placed himself in his way. Luke's speed was so great that he could not check himself. He came into collision with Tom, and in an instant both were prostrate. Tom, however, got the worst of it. He was thrown violently backward, falling on the back of his head, and lay stunned and motionless on the ice. Luke fell over him, but was scarcely hurt at all. He was up again in an instant, and might still have kept the lead, but instead he got down on his knees beside Tom and asked anxiously: \"Are you much hurt, Tom?\"  Tom didn't immediately answer, but lay breathing heavily, with his eyes still closed.  Meanwhile, Randolph, with a smile of triumph, swept on to his now assured victory. Most of the boys, however, stopped and gathered round Luke and Tom.  This accident had been watched with interest and surprise from the starting-point.  \"Tom must be a good deal hurt,\" said Linton. \"What could possibly have made him get in Luke's way?\"  \"I don't know,\" said the teacher, slowly; \"it looks strange.\"  \"It almost seemed as if he got in the way on purpose,\" Linton continued.  \"He is a friend of Randolph Duncan, is he not?\" asked the teacher, abruptly.  \"They are together about all the time.\"  \"Ha!\" commented the teacher, as if struck by an idea. He didn't, however, give expression to the thought in his mind.  A minute more, and Randolph swept into the presence of the teacher.  \"I believe I have won?\" he said, with a smile of gratification on his countenance.  \"You have come in first,\" said the teacher coldly.  \"Luke was considerably ahead when he ran into Tom,\" suggested Linton.  \"That's not my lookout,\" said Randolph, shrugging his shoulders. \"The point is that I have come in first.\"  \"Tom Harper is a friend of yours, is he not?\" asked the teacher.  \"Oh, yes!\" answered Randolph, indifferently.  \"He seems to be a good deal hurt. It was very strange that he got in Luke's way.\"  \"So it was,\" said Randolph, without betraying much interest.  \"Will you lend me your skates, Randolph?\" asked Linton. \"I should like to go out and see if I can help Tom in any way.\"  If any other boy than Linton had made the request, Randolph would have declined, but he wished, if possible, to add Linton to his list of friends, and graciously consented.  Before Linton could reach the spot, Tom had been assisted to his feet, and, with a dazed expression, assisted on either side by Luke and Edmund Blake, was on his way back to the starting-point.  \"What made you get in my way, Tom?\" asked Luke, puzzled.  \"I don't know,\" answered Tom, sullenly.  \"Are you much hurt?\"  \"I think my skull must be fractured,\" moaned Tom.  \"Oh, not so bad as that,\" said Luke, cheerfully. \"I've fallen on my head myself, but I got over it.\"  \"You didn't fall as hard as I did,\" groaned Tom.  \"No, I presume not; but heads are hard, and I guess you'll be all right in a few days.\"  Tom had certainly been severely hurt. There was a swelling on the back of his head almost as large as a hen's egg.  \"You've lost the watch, Luke,\" said Frank Acken. \"Randolph has got in first.\"  \"Yes, I supposed he would,\" answered Luke, quietly.  \"And there is Linton Tomkins coming to meet us on Randolph's skates.\"  \"Randolph is sitting down on a log taking it easy. What is your loss, Luke, is his gain.\"  \"Yes.\"  \"I think he might have come back to inquire after you, Tom, as you are a friend of his.\"  Tom looked resentfully at Randolph, and marked his complacent look, and it occurred to him also that the friend he had risked so much to serve was very ungrateful. But he hoped now, at any rate, to get the watch, and thought it prudent to say nothing.  The boys had now reached the shore.  \"Hope you're not much hurt, Tom?\" said Randolph, in a tone of mild interest.  \"I don't know but my skull is fractured,\" responded Tom, bitterly.  \"Oh, I guess not. It's the fortune of war. Well, I got in first.\"  Randolph waited for congratulations, but none came. All the boys looked serious, and more than one suspected that there had been foul play. They waited for the teacher to speak.    CHAPTER III  RANDOLPH GETS THE WATCH   \"It is true,\" said the teacher, slowly. \"Randolph has won the race.\"  Randolph's face lighted up with exultation.  \"But it is also evident,\" continued Mr. Hooper, \"that he would not have succeeded but for the unfortunate collision between Luke Larkin and Tom Harper.\"  Here some of Luke's friends brightened up.  \"I don't know about that,\" said Randolph. \"At any rate, I came in first.\"  \"I watched the race closely,\" said the teacher, \"and I have no doubt on the subject. Luke had so great a lead that he would surely have won the race.\"  \"But he didn't,\" persisted Randolph, doggedly.  \"He did not, as we all know. It is also clear that had he not stopped to ascertain the extent of Tom's injuries he still might have won.\"  \"That's so!\" said half a dozen boys.  \"Therefore I cannot accept the result as indicating the superiority of the successful contestant.\"  \"I think I am entitled to the prize,\" said Randolph.  \"I concede that; but, under the circumstances, I suggest to you that it would be graceful and proper to waive your claim and try the race over again.\"  The boys applauded, with one or two exceptions.  \"I won't consent to that, Mr. Hooper,\" said Randolph, frowning. \"I've won the prize fairly and I want it.\"  \"I am quite willing Randolph should have it, sir,\" said Luke. \"I think I should have won it if I had not stopped with Tom, but that doesn't affect the matter one way or the other. Randolph came in first, as he says, and I think he is entitled to the watch.\"  \"Then,\" said Mr. Hooper, gravely, \"there is nothing more to be said. Randolph, come forward and receive the prize.\"  Randolph obeyed with alacrity, and received the Waterbury watch from the hands of Mr. Hooper. The boys stood in silence and offered no congratulations.  \"Now, let me say,\" said the teacher, \"that I cannot understand why there was any collision at all. Tom Harper, why did you get in Luke's way?\"  \"Because I was a fool, sir,\" answered Tom, smarting from his injuries, and the evident indifference of Randolph, in whose cause he had incurred them.  \"That doesn't answer my question. Why did you act like a fool, as you expressed it?\"  \"I thought I could get out of the way in time,\" stammered Tom, who did not dare to tell the truth.  \"You had no other reason?\" asked the teacher, searchingly.  \"No, sir. What other reason could I have?\" said Tom, but his manner betrayed confusion.  \"Indeed, I don't know,\" returned the teacher, quietly. \"Your action, however, spoiled Luke's chances and insured the success of Randolph.\"  \"And got me a broken head,\" muttered Tom, placing his hand upon the swelling at the back of his head.  \"Yes, you got the worst of it. I advise you to go home and apply cold water or any other remedy your mother may suggest.\"  Randolph had already turned away, meaning to return home. Tom joined him. Randolph would gladly have dispensed with his company, but had no decent excuse, as Tom's home lay in the same direction as his.  \"Well, Randolph, you've won the watch,\" said Tom, when they were out of hearing of the other boys.  \"Yes,\" answered Randolph, indifferently. \"I don't care so much for that as for the ten dollars my father is going to give me.\"  \"That's what I thought. You've got another watch, you know--more valuable.\"  \"Well, what of it?\" said Randolph, suspiciously.  \"I think you might give me the Waterbury. I haven't got any.\"  \"Why should I give it to you?\" answered Randolph, coldly.  \"Because but for me you wouldn't have won it, nor the ten dollars, neither.\"  \"How do you make that out?\"  \"The teacher said so himself.\"  \"I don't agree to it.\"  \"You can't deny it. Luke was seven or eight rods ahead when I got in his way.\"  \"Then it was lucky for me.\"  \"It isn't lucky for me. My head hurts awfully.\"  \"I'm very sorry, of course.\"  \"That won't do me any good. Come, Randolph, give me the watch, like a good fellow.\"  \"Well, you've got cheek, I must say. I want the watch myself.\"  \"And is that all the satisfaction I am to get for my broken head?\" exclaimed Tom, indignantly.  Randolph was a thoroughly mean boy, who, if he had had a dozen watches, would have wished to keep them all for himself.  \"I've a great mind to tell Luke and the teacher of the arrangement between us.\"  \"There wasn't any arrangement,\" said Randolph, sharply. \"However, as I'm really sorry for you, I am willing to give you a quarter. There, now, don't let me hear any more about the matter.\"  He drew a silver quarter from his vest pocket and tendered it to Tom.  Tom Harper was not a sensitive boy, but his face flushed with indignation and shame, and he made no offer to take the money.  \"Keep your quarter, Randolph Duncan,\" he said scornfully. \"I think you're the meanest specimen of a boy that I ever came across. Any boy is a fool to be your friend. I don't care to keep company with you any longer.\"  \"This to me!\" exclaimed Randolph, angrily. \"This is the pay I get for condescending to let you go with me.\"  \"You needn't condescend any longer,\" said Tom, curtly, and he crossed to the other side of the street.  Randolph looked after him rather uneasily. After all, he was sorry to lose his humble follower.  \"He'll be coming round in a day or two to ask me to take him back,\" he reflected. \"I would be willing to give him ten cents more, but as for giving him the watch, he must think me a "]]]
