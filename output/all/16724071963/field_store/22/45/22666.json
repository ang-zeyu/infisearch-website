You are still too rash, but that is a fault which time will amend in a youth of your heroic temper.  Listen to me now, and you too, noble Pharaoh, permit me these few words; let us betroth these two, and may their union be the bond of ours, but first grant me for a year to take my long-lost child home with me that she may rejoice my old heart, and that I may hear from her lips the accents of her mother, whom you took from me.  They are both young; according to the usages of our country, where both men and women ripen later than in your country, they are almost too young for the solemn tie of marriage.  But one thing above all will determine you to favor my wishes; this daughter of a royal house has grown up amid the humblest surroundings; here she has no home, no family- ties.  The prince has wooed her, so to speak, on the highway, but if she now comes with me he can enter the palace of kings as suitor to a princess, and the marriage feast I will provide shall be a right royal one.\"  \"What you demand is just and wise,\" replied Rameses.  \"Take your grand- child with you as my son's betrothed bride--my future daughter.  Give me your hands, my children.  The delay will teach you patience, for Rameri must remain a full year from to-day in Egypt, and it will be to your profit, sweet child, for the obedience which he will learn through his training in the army will temper the nature of your future husband.  You, Rameri, shall in a year from to-day--and I think you will not forget the date--find at your service a ship in the harbor of Pelusium, fitted and manned with Phoenicians, to convey you to your wedding.\"  \"So be it!\"  exclaimed the old man.   \"And by Zeus who hears me swear--I will not withhold Xanthe's daughter from your son when he comes to claim her!\"  When Rameri returned to the princes' tent he threw himself on their necks in turn, and when he found himself alone with their surly old house- steward, he snatched his wig from his head, flung it in the air, and then coaxingly stroked the worthy officer's cheeks as he set it on his head again.     CHAPTER XLVI.  Uarda accompanied her grandfather and Praxilla to their tent on the farther side of the Nile, but she was to return next morning to the Egyptian camp to take leave of all her friends, and to provide for her father's internment.  Nor did she delay attending to the last wishes of old Hekt, and Bent-Anat easily persuaded her father, when he learnt how greatly he had been indebted to her, to have her embalmed like a lady of rank.  Before Uarda left the Egyptian camp, Pentaur came to entreat her to afford her dying preserver Nebsecht the last happiness of seeing her once more; Uarda acceded with a blush, and the poet, who had watched all night by his friend, went forward to prepare him for her visit.  Nebsecht's burns and a severe wound on his head caused him great suffering; his cheeks glowed with fever, and the physicians told Pentaur that he probably could not live more than a few hours.  The poet laid his cool hand on his friend's brow, and spoke to him encouragingly; but Nebsecht smiled at his words with the peculiar expression of a man who knows that his end is near, and said in a low voice and with a visible effort:  \"A few breaths more and here, and here, will be peace.\"  He laid his hand on his head and on his heart.  \"We all attain to peace,\" said Pentaur.  \"But perhaps only to labor more earnestly and unweariedly in the land beyond the grave.  If the Gods reward any thing it is the honest struggle, the earnest seeking after truth; if any spirit can be made one with the great Soul of the world it will be yours, and if any eye may see the Godhead through the veil which here shrouds the mystery of His existence yours will have earned the privilege.\"  \"I have pushed and pulled,\" sighed Nebsecht, \"with all my might, and now when I thought I had caught a glimpse of the truth the heavy fist of death comes down upon me and shuts my eyes.  What good will it do me to see with the eye of the Divinity or to share in his omniscience?  It is not seeing, it is seeking that is delightful--so delightful that I would willingly set my life there against another life here for the sake of it.\"  He was silent, for his strength failed, and Pentaur begged him to keep quiet, and to occupy his mind in recalling all the hours of joy which life had given him.  \"They have been few,\" said the leech.  \"When my mother kissed me and gave me dates, when I could work and observe in peace, when you opened my eyes to the beautiful world of poetry--that was good!\"  And you have soothed the sufferings of many men, added Pentaur, \"and never caused pain to any one.\"  Nebsecht shook his head.  \"I drove the old paraschites,\" he muttered, \"to madness and to death.\"  He was silent for a long time, then he looked up eagerly and said: \"But not intentionally--and not in vain!  In Syria, at Megiddo I could work undisturbed; now I know what the organ is that thinks.  The heart!  What is the heart?  A ram's heart or a man's heart, they serve the same end; they turn the wheel of animal life, they both beat quicker in terror or in joy, for we feel fear or pleasure just as animals do.  But Thought, the divine power that flies to the infinite, and enables us to form and prove our opinions, has its seat here--Here in the brain, behind the brow.\"  He paused exhausted and overcome with pain.  Pentaur thought he was wandering in his fever, and offered him a cooling drink while two physicians walked round his bed singing litanies; then, as Nebsecht raised himself in bed with renewed energy, the poet said to him:  \"The fairest memory of your life must surely be that of the sweet child whose face, as you once confessed to me, first opened your soul to the sense of beauty, and whom with your own hands you snatched from death at the cost of your own life.  You know Uarda has found her own relatives and is happy, and she is very grateful to her preserver, and would like to see him once more before she goes far away with her grandfather.\"  The sick man hesitated before he answered softly:  \"Let her come--but I will look at her from a distance.\"  Pentaur went out and soon returned with Uarda, who remained standing with glowing cheeks and tears in her eyes at the door of the tent.  The leech looked at her a long time with an imploring and tender expression, then he said:  \"Accept my thanks--and be happy.\"  The girl would have gone up to him to take his hand, but he waved her off with his right hand enveloped in wrappings.  \"Come no nearer,\" he said, \"but stay a moment longer.  You have tears in your eyes; are they for me or only for my pain?\"  \"For you, good noble man! my friend and my preserver!\"  said Uarda.  \"For you dear, poor Nebsecht!\"  The leech closed his eyes as she spoke these words with earnest feeling, but he looked up once more as she ceased speaking, and gazed at her with tender admiration; then he said softly:  \"It is enough--now I can die.\"  Uarda left the tent, Pentaur remained with him listening to his hoarse and difficult breathing; suddenly:  Nebsecht raised himself, and said: \"Farewell, my friend,--my journey is beginning, who knows whither?\"  \"Only not into vacancy, not to end in nothingness!\" cried Pentaur warmly.  The leech shook his head.  \"I have been something,\" he said, \"and being something I cannot become nothing.  Nature is a good economist, and utilizes the smallest trifle; she will use me too according to her need. She brings everything to its end and purpose in obedience to some rule and measure, and will so deal with me after I am dead; there is no waste. Each thing results in being that which it is its function to become; our wish or will is not asked--my head! when the pain is in my head I cannot think--if only I could prove--could prove----\"  The last words were less and less audible, his breath was choked, and in a few seconds Pentaur with deep regret closed his eyes.   Pentaur, as he quitted the tent where the dead man lay, met the high- priest Ameni, who had gone to seek him by his friend's bed-side, and they returned together to gaze on the dead.  Ameni, with much emotion, put up a few earnest prayers for the salvation of his soul, and then requested Pentaur to follow him without delay to his tent.  On the way he prepared the poet, with the polite delicacy which was peculiar to him, for a meeting which might be more painful than joyful to him, and must in any case bring him many hours of anxiety and agitation.  The judges in Thebes, who had been compelled to sentence the lady Setchem, as the mother of a traitor, to banishment to the mines had, without any demand on her part, granted leave to the noble and most respectable matron to go under an escort of guards to meet the king on his return into Egypt, in order to petition for mercy for herself, but not, as it was expressly added--for Paaker; and she had set out, but with the secret resolution to obtain the king's grace not for herself but for her son.       [Agatharchides, in Diodorus III. 12, says that in many cases not      only the criminal but his relations also were condemned to labor in      the mines.  In the convention signed between Rameses and the Cheta      king it is expressly provided that the deserter restored to Egypt      shall go unpunished, that no injury shall be done \"to his house, his      wife or his children, nor shall his mother be put to death.\"]  Ameni had already left Thebes for the north when this sentence was pronounced, or he would have reversed it by declaring the true origin of Paaker; for after he had given up his participation in the Regent's conspiracy, he no longer had any motive for keeping old Hekt's secret.  Setchem's journey was lengthened by a storm which wrecked the ship in which she was descending the Nile, and she did not reach Pelusium till after the king.  The canal which formed the mouth of the Nile close to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5448"],["title","Uarda : a Romance of Ancient Egypt â€” Volume 10 (#8)"],["body","fortress and joined the river to the Mediterranean, was so over- crowded with the boats of the Regent and his followers, of the ambassadors, nobles, citizens, and troops which had met from all parts of the country, that the lady's boat could find anchorage only at a great distance from the city, and accompanied by her faithful steward she had succeeded only a few hours before in speaking to the high-priest.  Setchem was terribly changed; her eyes, which only a few months since had kept an efficient watch over the wealthy Theban household, were now dim and weary, and although her figure had not grown thin it had lost its dignity and energy, and seemed inert and feeble.  Her lips, so ready for a wise or sprightly saying, were closely shut, and moved only in silent prayer or when some friend spoke to her of her unhappy son.  His deed she well knew was that of a reprobate, and she sought no excuse or defence; her mother's heart forgave it without any.  Whenever she thought of him-- and she thought of him incessantly all through the day and through her sleepless nights-her eyes overflowed with tears.  Her boat had reached Pelusium just as the flames were breaking out in the palace; the broad flare of light and the cries from the various vessels in the harbor brought her on deck.  She heard that the burning house was the pavilion erected by Ani for the king's residence; Rameses she was told was in the utmost danger, and the fire had beyond a doubt been laid by traitors.  As day broke and further news reached her, the names of her son and of her sister came to her ear; she asked no questions--she would not hear the truth--but she knew it all the same; as often as the word \"traitor\" caught her ear in her cabin, to which she had retreated, she felt as if some keen pain shot through her bewildered brain, and shuddered as if from a cold chill.  All through that day she could neither eat nor drink, but lay with closed eyes on her couch, while her steward--who had soon learnt what a terrible share his former master had taken in the incendiarism, and who now gave up his lady's cause for lost--sought every where for the high-priest Ameni; but as he was among the persons nearest to the king it was impossible to see him that day, and it was not till the next morning that he was able to speak with him.  Ameni inspired the anxious and sorrowful old retainer with, fresh courage, returned with him in his own chariot to the harbor, and accompanied him to Setchem's boat to prepare her for the happiness which awaited her after her terrible troubles.  But he came too late, the spirit of the poor lady was quite clouded, and she listened to him without any interest while he strove to restore her to courage and to recall her wandering mind.  She only interrupted him over and over again with the questions: \"Did he do it?\" or \"Is he alive?\"  At last Ameni succeeded in persuading her to accompany him in her litter to his tent, where she would find her son.  Pentaur was wonderfully like her lost husband, and the priest, experienced in humanity, thought that the sight of him would rouse the dormant powers of her mind.  When she had arrived at his tent, he told her with kind precaution the whole history of the exchange of Paaker for Pentaur, and she followed the story with attention but with indifference, as if she were hearing of the adventures of others who did not concern her.  When Ameni enlarged on the genius of the poet and on his perfect resemblance to his dead father she muttered:  \"I know--I know.  You mean the speaker at the Feast of the Valley,\" and then although she had been told several times that Paaker had been killed, she asked again if her son was alive.  Ameni decided at last to fetch Pentaur himself,  When he came back with him, fully prepared to meet his heavily-stricken mother, the tent was empty.  The high-priest's servants told him that Setchem had persuaded the easily-moved old prophet Gagabu to conduct her to the place where the body of Paaker lay.  Ameni was very much vexed, for he feared that Setchem was now lost indeed, and he desired the poet to follow him at once.  The mortal remains of the pioneer had been laid in a tent not far from the scene of the fire; his body was covered with a cloth, but his pale face, which had not been injured in his fall, remained uncovered; by his side knelt the unhappy mother.  She paid no heed to Ameni when he spoke to her, and he laid his hand on her shoulder and said as he pointed to the body:  \"This was the son of a gardener.  You brought him up faithfully as if he were your own; but your noble husband's true heir, the son you bore him, is Pentaur, to whom the Gods have given not only the form and features but the noble qualities of his father.  The dead man may be forgiven--for the sake of your virtues; but your love is due to this nobler soul--the real son of your husband, the poet of Egypt, the preserver of the king's life.\"  Setchem rose and went up to Pentaur, she smiled at him and stroked his face and breast.  \"It is he,\" she said.  \"May the Immortals bless him!\"  Pentaur would have clasped her in his arms, but she pushed him away as if she feared to commit some breach of faith, and turning hastily to the bier she said softly:  Poor Paaker--poor, poor Paaker!\"  \"Mother, mother, do you not know your son?\"  cried Pentaur deeply moved.  She turned to him again: \"It is his voice,\" she said.  \"It is he.\"  She went up to Pentaur, clung to him, clasped her arm around his neck as he bent over her, then kissing him fondly:  \"The Gods will bless you!\" she said once more.  She tore herself from him and threw herself down by the body of Paaker, as if she had done him some injustice and robbed him of his rights.  Thus she remained, speechless and motionless, till they carried her back to her boat, there she lay down, and refused to take any nourishment; from time to time she whispered \"Poor Paaker!\"  She no longer repelled Pentaur, for she did not again recognize him, and before he left her she had followed the rough-natured son of her adoption to the other world.     CHAPTER XLVII.  The king had left the camp, and had settled in the neighboring city of Rameses' Tanis, with the greater part of his army.  The Hebrews, who were settled in immense numbers in the province of Goshen, and whom Ani had attached to his cause by remitting their task-work, were now driven to labor at the palaces and fortifications which Rameses had begun to build.  At Tanis, too, the treaty of peace was signed and was presented to Rameses inscribed on a silver tablet by Tarthisebu, the representative of the Cheta king, in the name of his lord and master.  Pentaur followed the king as soon as he had closed his mother's eyes, and accompanied her body to Heliopolis, there to have it embalmed; from thence the mummy was to be sent to Thebes, and solemnly placed in the grave of her ancestors.  This duty of children towards their parents, and indeed all care for the dead, was regarded as so sacred by the Egyptians, that neither Pentaur nor Bent-Anat would have thought of being united before it was accomplished.  On the 21st day of the month Tybi, of the 21st year of the reign of Rameses, the day on which the peace was signed, the poet returned to Tanis, sad at heart, for the old gardener, whom he had regarded and loved as his father, had died before his return home; the good old man had not long survived the false intelligence of the death of the poet, whom he had not only loved but reverenced as a superior being bestowed upon his house as a special grace from the Gods.  It was not till seven months after the fire at Pelusium that Pentaur's marriage with Bent-Anat was solemnized in the palace of the Pharaohs at Thebes; but time and the sorrows he had suffered had only united their hearts more closely.  She felt that though he was the stronger she was the giver and the helper, and realized with delight that like the sun, which when it rises invites a thousand flowers to open and unfold, the glow of her presence raised the poet's oppressed soul to fresh life and beauty.  They had given each other up for lost through strife and suffering, and now had found each other again; each knew how precious the other was.  To make each other happy, and prove their affection, was now the aim of their lives, and as they each had proved that they prized honor and right-doing above happiness their union was a true marriage, ennobling and purifying their souls.  She could share his deepest thoughts and his most difficult undertakings, and if their house were filled with children she would know how to give him the fullest enjoyment of those small blessings which at the same time are the greatest joys of life.  Pentaur finding himself endowed by the king with superabundant wealth, gave up the inheritance of his fathers to his brother Horus, who was raised to the rank of chief pioneer as a reward for his interposition at the battle of Kadesh; Horus replaced the fallen cedar-trees which had stood at the door of his house by masts of more moderate dimensions.  The hapless Huni, under whose name Pentaur had been transferred to the mines of Sinai, was released from the quarries of Chennu, and restored to his children enriched by gifts from the poet.  The Pharaoh fully recognized the splendid talents of his daughter's husband; she to his latest days remained his favorite child, even after he had consolidated the peace by marrying the daughter of the Cheta king, and Pentaur became his most trusted adviser, and responsible for the weightiest affairs in the state.  Rameses learned from the papers found in Ani's tent, and from other evidence which was only too abundant, that the superior of the House of Seti, and with him the greater part of the priesthood, had for a long time been making common cause with the traitor; in the first instance he determined on the severest, nay bloodiest punishment, but he was persuaded by Pentaur and by his son"]]]
