The boy was about five years old, with legs so feeble that they could scarcely support the weight of his body, but he had a particularly sweet little face; certainly it was quite without expression, and it was only when he saw Klea coming that tiny Philo's eyes had lighted up with pleasure.  \"Drink this milk,\" said the child's mother, offering the young girl an earthen bowl.  \"There is not much and I could not spare it if Philo would eat like other children, but it seems as if it hurt him to swallow.  He drinks two or three drops and eats a mouthful, and then will take no more even if he is beaten.\"  \"You have not been beating him again?\"  said Klea reproachfully, and drawing the child closer to her.  \"My husband--\" said the woman, pulling at her dress in some confusion.  \"The child was born on a good day and in a lucky hour, and yet he is so puny and weak and will not learn to speak, and that provokes Pianchi.\"  \"He will spoil everything again!\"  exclaimed Klea annoyed.  \"Where is he?\"  \"He was wanted in the temple.\"  \"And is he not pleased that Philo calls him 'father,' and you 'mother,' and me by my name, and that he learns to distinguish many things?\"  asked the girl.  \"Oh, yes of course,\" said the woman.  \"He says you are teaching him to speak just as if he were a starling, and we are very much obliged to you.\"  \"That is not what I want,\" interrupted Klea.  \"What I wish is that you should not punish and scold the boy, and that you should be as glad as I am when you see his poor little dormant soul slowly waking up.  If he goes on like this, the poor little fellow will be quite sharp and intelligent.  What is my name, my little one?\"  \"Ke-ea,\" stammered the child, smiling at his friend.  \"And now taste this that I have in my hand; what is it?--I see you know.  It is called-- whisper in my ear.  That's right, mil--mil-milk! to be sure, my tiny, it is milk.  Now open your little mouth and say it prettily after me-- once more--and again--say it twelve times quite right and I will give you a kiss--Now you have earned a pretty kiss--will you have it here or here? Well, and what is this?  your ea-?  Yes, your ear.  And this?--your nose, that is right.\"  The child's eyes brightened more and more under this gentle teaching, and neither Klea nor her pupil were weary till, about an hour later, the re-echoing sound of a brass gong called her away.  As she turned to go the little one ran after her crying; she took him in her arms and carried him back to his mother, and then went on to her own room to dress herself and her sister for the procession.  On the way to the Pastophorium she recalled once more her expedition to the temple and her prayer there.  \"Even before the sanctuary,\" said she to herself, \"I could not succeed in releasing my soul from its burden--it was not till I set to work to loosen the tongue of the poor little child.  Every pure spot, it seems to me, may be the chosen sanctuary of some divinity, and is not an infant's soul purer than the altar where truth is mocked at?\"  In their room she found Irene; she had dressed her hair carefully and stuck the pomegranate-flower in it, and she asked Klea if she thought she looked well.  \"You look like Aphrodite herself,\" replied Klea kissing her forehead. Then she arranged the folds of her sister's dress, fastened on the ornaments, and proceeded to dress herself.  While she was fastening her sandals Irene asked her, \"Why do you sigh so bitterly?\"  and Klea replied, \"I feel as if I had lost my parents a second time.\"     CHAPTER V.  The procession was over.  At the great service which had been performed before him in the Greek Serapeum, Ptolemy Philometor had endowed the priests not with the whole but with a considerable portion of the land concerning which they had approached him with many petitions.  After the court had once more quitted Memphis and the procession was broken up, the sisters returned to their room, Irene with crimson cheeks and a smile on her lips, Klea with a gloomy and almost threatening light in her eyes.  As the two were going to their room in silence a temple-servant called to Klea, desiring her to go with him to the high-priest, who wished to speak to her.  Klea, without speaking, gave her water-jar to Irene and was conducted into a chamber of the temple, which was used for keeping the sacred vessels in.  There she sat down on a bench to wait.  The two men who in the morning had visited the Pastophorium had also followed in the procession with the royal family.  At the close of the solemnities Publius had parted from his companion without taking leave, and without looking to the right or to the left, he had hastened back to the Pastophorium and to the cell of Serapion, the recluse.  The old man heard from afar the younger man's footstep, which fell on the earth with a firmer and more decided tread than that of the softly- stepping priests of Serapis, and he greeted him warmly with signs and words.  Publius thanked him coolly and gravely, and said, dryly enough and with incisive brevity:  \"My time is limited.  I propose shortly to quit Memphis, but I promised you to hear your request, and in order to keep my word I have come to see you; still--as I have said--only to keep my word.  The water-bearers of whom you desired to speak to me do not interest me--I care no more about them than about the swallows flying over the house yonder.\"  \"And yet this morning you took a long walk for Klea's sake,\" returned Serapion.  \"I have often taken a much longer one to shoot a hare,\" answered the Roman.  \"We men do not pursue our game because the possession of it is any temptation, but because we love the sport, and there are sporting natures even among women.  Instead of spears or arrows they shoot with flashing glances, and when they think they have hit their game they turn their back upon it.  Your Klea is one of this sort, while the pretty little one I saw this morning looks as if she were very ready to be hunted, I however, no more wish to be the hunter of a young girl than to be her game.  I have still three days to spend in Memphis, and then I shall turn my back forever on this stupid country.\"  \"This morning,\" said Serapion, who began to suspect what the grievance might be which had excited the discontent implied in the Roman's speech, \"This morning you appeared to be in less hurry to set out than now, so to me you seem to be in the plight of game trying to escape; however, I know Klea better than you do.  Shooting is no sport of hers, nor will she let herself be hunted, for she has a characteristic which you, my friend Publius Scipio, ought to recognize and value above all others--she is proud, very proud; aye, and so she may be, scornful as you look--as if you would like to say 'how came a water-carrier of Serapis by her pride, a poor creature who is ill-fed and always engaged in service, pride which is the prescriptive right only of those, whom privilege raises above the common herd around them?--But this girl, you may take my word for it, has ample reason to hold her head high, not only because she is the daughter of free and noble parents and is distinguished by rare beauty, not because while she was still a child she undertook, with the devotion and constancy of the best of mothers, the care of another child--her own sister, but for a reason which, if I judge you rightly, you will understand better than many another young man; because she must uphold her pride in order that among the lower servants with whom unfortunately she is forced to work, she may never forget that she is a free and noble lady.  You can set your pride aside and yet remain what you are, but if she were to do so and to learn to feel as a servant, she would presently become in fact what by nature she is not and by circumstances is compelled to be.  A fine horse made to carry burdens becomes a mere cart- horse as soon as it ceases to hold up its head and lift its feet freely. Klea is proud because she must be proud; and if you are just you will not contemn the girl, who perhaps has cast a kindly glance at you--since the gods have so made you that you cannot fail to please any woman--and yet who must repel your approaches because she feels herself above being trifled with, even by one of the Cornelia gens, and yet too lowly to dare to hope that a man like you should ever stoop from your height to desire her for a wife.  She has vexed you, of that there can be no doubt; how, I can only guess.  If, however, it has been through her repellent pride, that ought not to hurt you, for a woman is like a soldier, who only puts on his armor when he is threatened by an opponent whose weapons he fears.\"  The recluse had rather whispered than spoken these words, remembering that he had neighbors; and as he ceased the drops stood on his brow, for whenever any thing disturbed him he was accustomed to allow his powerful voice to be heard pretty loudly, and it cost him no small effort to moderate it for so long.  Publius had at first looked him in the face, and then had gazed at the ground, and he had heard Serapion to the end without interrupting him; but the color had flamed in his cheeks as in those of a schoolboy, and yet he was an independent and resolute youth who knew how to conduct himself in difficult straits as well as a man in the prime of life. In all his proceedings he was wont to know very well, exactly what he wanted, and to do without any fuss or comment whatever he thought right and fitting.  During the anchorite's speech the question had occurred to him, what did he in fact expect or wish of the water-bearer; but the answer was wanting, he felt somewhat uncertain of himself, and his uncertainty and dissatisfaction with himself increased as all that he heard struck him more and more.

D.W.]      THE SISTERS  By Georg Ebers  Volume 2.    CHAPTER VII.  In the very midst of the white wall with its bastions and ramparts, which formed the fortifications of Memphis, stood the old palace of the kings, a stately structure built of bricks, recently plastered, and with courts, corridors, chambers and halls without number, and veranda-like out- buildings of gayly-painted wood, and a magnificent pillared banqueting- hall in the Greek style.  It was surrounded by verdurous gardens, and a whole host of laborers tended the flower-beds and shady alleys, the shrubs and the trees; kept the tanks clean and fed the fish in them; guarded the beast-garden, in which quadrupeds of every kind, from the heavy-treading elephant to the light-footed antelope, were to be seen, associated with birds innumerable of every country and climate.  A light white vapor rose from the splendidly fitted bath-house, loud barkings resounded from the dog-kennels, and from the long array of open stables came the neighing of horses with the clatter and stamp of hoofs, and the rattle of harness and chains.  A semicircular building of new construction adjoining the old palace was the theatre, and many large tents for the bodyguard, for ambassadors and scribes, as well as others, serving as banqueting-halls for the various court-officials, stood both within the garden and outside its enclosing walls.  A large space leading from the city itself to the royal citadel was given up to the soldiers, and there, by the side of the shady court-yards, were the houses of the police-guard and the prisons.  Other soldiers were quartered in tents close to the walls of the palace itself.  The clatter of their arms and the words of command, given in Greek, by their captain, sounded out at this particular instant, and up into the part of the buildings occupied by the queen; and her apartments were high up, for in summer time Cleopatra preferred to live in airy tents, which stood among the broad- leaved trees of the south and whole groves of flowering shrubs, on the level roof of the palace, which was also lavishly decorated with marble statues.  There was only one way of access to this retreat, which was fitted up with regal splendor; day and night it was fanned by currents of soft air, and no one could penetrate uninvited to disturb the queen's retirement, for veteran guards watched at the foot of the broad stair that led to the roof, chosen from the Macedonian \"Garde noble,\" and owing as implicit obedience to Cleopatra as to the king himself.  This select corps was now, at sunset, relieving guard, and the queen could hear the words spoken by the officers in command and the clatter of the shields against the swords as they rattled on the pavement, for she had come out of her tent into the open air, and stood gazing towards the west, where the glorious hues of the sinking sun flooded the bare, yellow limestone range of the Libyan hills, with their innumerable tombs and the separate groups of pyramids; while the wonderful coloring gradually tinged with rose-color the light silvery clouds that hovered in the clear sky over the valley of Memphis, and edged them as with a rile of living gold.  The queen stepped out of her tent, accompanied by a young Greek girl--the fair Zoe, daughter of her master of the hunt Zenodotus, and Cleopatra's favorite lady-in-waiting--but though she looked towards the west, she stood unmoved by the magic of the glorious scene before her; she screened her eyes with her hand to shade them from the blinding rays, and said:  \"Where can Cornelius be staying!  When we mounted our chariots before the temple he had vanished, and as far as I can see the road in the quarters of Sokari and Serapis I cannot discover his vehicle, nor that of Eulaeus who was to accompany him.  It is not very polite of him to go off in this way without taking leave; nay, I could call it ungrateful, since I had proposed to tell him on our way home all about my brother Euergetes, who has arrived to-day with his friends.  They are not yet acquainted, for Euergetes was living in Cyrene when Publius Cornelius Scipio landed in Alexandria.  Stay! do you see a black shadow out there by the vineyard at Kakem; That is very likely he; but no--you are right, it is only some birds, flying in a close mass above the road.  Can you see nothing more? No!--and yet we both have sharp young eyes.  I am very curious to know whether Publius Scipio will like Euergetes.  There can hardly be two beings more unlike, and yet they have some very essential points in common.\"  \"They are both men,\" interrupted Zoe, looking at the queen as if she expected cordial assent to this proposition.  \"So they are,\" said Cleopatra proudly.  \"My brother is still so young that, if he were not a king's son, he would hardly have outgrown the stage of boyhood, and would be a lad among other Epheboi,--[Youths above 18 were so called]--and yet among the oldest there is hardly a man who is his superior in strength of will and determined energy.  Already, before I married Philometor, he had clutched Alexandria and Cyrene, which by right should belong to my husband, who is the eldest of us three, and that was not very brotherly conduct--and indeed we had other grounds for being angry with him; but when I saw him again for the first time after nine months of separation I was obliged to forget them all, and welcome him as though he had done nothing but good to me and his brother--who is my husband, as is the custom of the families of Pharaohs and the usage of our race.  He is a young Titan, and no one would be astonished if he one day succeeded in piling Pelion upon Ossa.  I know well enough how wild he can often be, how unbridled and recalcitrant beyond all bounds; but I can easily pardon him, for the same bold blood flows in my own veins, and at the root of all his excesses lies power, genuine and vigorous power.  And this innate pith and power are just the very thing we most admire in men, for it is the one gift which the gods have dealt out to us with a less liberal hand than to men.  Life indeed generally dams its overflowing current, but I doubt whether this will be the case with the stormy torrent of his energy; at any rate men such as he is rush swiftly onwards, and are strong to the end, which sooner or later is sure to overtake them; and I infinitely prefer such a wild torrent to a shallow brook flowing over a plain, which hurts no one, and which in order to prolong its life loses itself in a misty bog.  He, if any one, may be forgiven for his tumultuous career; for when he pleases my brother's great qualities charm old and young alike, and are as conspicuous and as remarkable as his faults--nay, I will frankly say his crimes.  And who in Greece or Egypt surpasses him in grasp and elevation of mind?\"  You may well be proud of him,\" replied Zoe.  Not even Publius Scipio himself can soar to the height reached by Euergetes.\"  \"But, on the other hand, Euergetes is not gifted with the steady, calm self-reliance of Cornelius.  The man who should unite in one person the good qualities of those two, need yield the palm, as it seems to me, not even to a god!\"  \"Among us imperfect mortals he would indeed be the only perfect one,\" replied Zoe.  \"But the gods could not endure the existence of a perfect man, for then they would have to undertake the undignified task of competing with one of their own creatures.\"  \"Here, however, comes one whom no one can accuse!\"  cried the young queen, as she hastened to meet a richly dressed woman, older than herself, who came towards her leading her son, a pale child of two years old.  She bent down to the little one, tenderly but with impetuous eagerness, and was about to clasp him in her arms, but the fragile child, which at first had smiled at her, was startled; he turned away from her and tried to hide his little face in the dress of his nurse--a lady of rank-to whom he clung with both hands.  The queen threw herself on her knees before him, took hold of his shoulder, and partly by coaxing and partly by insistence strove to induce him to quit the sheltering gown and to turn to her; but although the lady, his wet-nurse, seconded her with kind words of encouragement, the terrified child began to cry, and resisted his mother's caresses with more and more vehemence the more passionately she tried to attract and conciliate him.  At last the nurse lifted him up, and was about to hand him to his mother, but the wilful little boy cried more than before, and throwing his arms convulsively round his nurse's neck he broke into loud cries.  In the midst of this rather unbecoming struggle of the mother against the child's obstinacy, the clatter of wheels and of horses' hoofs rang through the court-yard of the palace, and hardly had the sound reached the queen's ears than she turned away from the screaming child, hurried to the parapet of the roof, and called out to Zoe:  \"Publius Scipio is here; it is high time that I should dress for the banquet.  Will that naughty child not listen to me at all?  Take him away, Praxinoa, and understand distinctly that I am much dissatisfied with you.  You estrange my own child from me to curry favor with the future king.  That is base, or else it proves that you have no tact, and are incompetent for the office entrusted to you.  The office of wet-nurse you duly fulfilled, but I shall now look out for another attendant for the boy.  Do not answer me! no tears!  I have had enough of that with the child's screaming.\"  With these words, spoken loudly and passionately, she turned her back on Praxinoa--the wife of a distinguished Macedonian noble, who stood as if petrified--and retired into her tent, where branched lamps had just"]]]
