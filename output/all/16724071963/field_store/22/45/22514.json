Richter was now a captain. The good German's eyes were filled as he said good-by.  \"You will come, too, my friend, when the country needs you,\" he said. \"Now\" (and he shrugged his shoulders), \"now have we many with no cares to go. I have not even a father--\" And he turned to Judge Whipple, who was standing by, holding out a bony hand.  \"God bless you, Carl,\" said the Judge And Carl could scarce believe his ears. He got aboard the boat, her decks already blue with troops, and as she backed out with her whistle screaming, the last objects he saw were the gaunt old man and the broad-shouldered young man side by side on the edge of the landing.  Stephen's chest heaved, and as he walked back to the office with the Judge, he could not trust himself to speak. Back to the silent office where the shelves mocked them. The Judge closed the ground-glass door behind him, and Stephen sat until five o'clock over a book. No, it was not Whittlesey, but Hardee's \"Tactics.\" He shut it with a slam, and went to Verandah Hall to drill recruits on a dusty floor,--narrow-chested citizens in suspenders, who knew not the first motion in right about face. For Stephen was an adjutant in the Home Guards--what was left of them.  One we know of regarded the going of the troops and the coming of the wounded with an equanimity truly philosophical. When the regiments passed Carvel & Company on their way riverward to embark, Mr. Hopper did not often take the trouble to rise from his chair, nor was he ever known to go to the door to bid them Godspeed. This was all very well, because they were Union regiments. But Mr. Hopper did not contribute a horse, nor even a saddle-blanket, to the young men who went away secretly in the night, without fathers or mothers or sisters to wave at them. Mr. Hopper had better use for his money.  One scorching afternoon in July Colonel Carvel came into the office, too hurried to remark the pain in honest Ephum's face as he watched his master. The sure signs of a harassed man were on the Colonel. Since May he had neglected his business affairs for others which he deemed public, and which were so mysterious that even Mr. Hopper could not get wind of them. These matters had taken the Colonel out of town. But now the necessity of a pass made that awkward, and he went no farther than Glencoe, where he spent an occasional Sunday. Today Mr. Hopper rose from his chair when Mr. Carvel entered,--a most unprecedented action. The Colonel cleared his throat. Sitting down at his desk, he drummed upon it uneasily.  \"Mr. Hopper!\" he said at length.  Eliphalet crossed the room quickly, and something that was very near a smile was on his face. He sat down close to Mr. Carvel's chair with a semi-confidential air,--one wholly new, had the Colonel given it a thought. He did not, but began to finger some printed slips of paper which had indorsements on their backs. His fine lips were tightly closed, as if in pain.  \"Mr. Hopper,\" he said, \"these Eastern notes are due this week, are they not?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  The Colonel glanced up swiftly.  \"There is no use mincing matters, Hopper. You know as well as I that there is no money to pay them,\" said he, with a certain pompous attempt at severity which characterized his kind nature. \"You have served me well. You have brought this business up to a modern footing, and made it as prosperous as any in the town. I am sorry, sir, that those contemptible Yankees should have forced us to the use of arms, and cut short many promising business careers such as yours, sir. But we have to face the music. We have to suffer for our principles.  \"These notes cannot be met, Mr. Hopper.\" And the good gentleman looked out of the window. He was thinking of a day, before the Mexican War, when his young wife had sat in the very chair filled by Mr. Hopper now. \"These notes cannot be met,\" he repeated, and his voice was near to breaking.  The flies droning in the hot office made the only sound. Outside the partition, among the bales, was silence.  \"Colonel,\" said Mr. Hopper, with a remarkable ease, \"I cal'late these notes can be met.\"  The Colonel jumped as if he had heard a shot, and one of the notes fell to the floor. Eliphalet picked it up tenderly, and held it.  \"What do you mean, sir?\" Mr. Carvel cried. \"There isn't a bank in town that will lend me money. I--I haven't a friend--a friend I may ask who can spare it, sir.\"  Mr. Hopper lifted up his hand. It was a fat hand. Suavity was come upon it like a new glove and changed the man. He was no longer cringing. Now he had poise, such poise as we in these days are accustomed to see in leather and mahogany offices. The Colonel glared at him uncomfortably.  \"I will take up those notes myself, sir.\"  \"You!\" cried the Colonel, incredulously, \"You?\"  We must do Eliphalet justice. There was not a deal of hypocrisy in his nature, and now he did not attempt the part of Samaritan. He did not beam upon the Colonel and remind him of the day on which, homeless and friendless, he had been frightened into his store by a drove of mules. No. But his day,--the day toward which he had striven unknown and unnoticed for so many years--the day when he would laugh at the pride of those who had ignored and insulted him, was dawning at last. When we are thoughtless of our words, we do not reckon with that spark in little bosoms that may burst into flame and burn us. Not that Colonel Carvel had ever been aught but courteous and kind to all. His station in life had been his offence to Eliphalet, who strove now to hide an exultation that made him tremble.  \"What do you mean, sir?\" demanded the Colonel, again.  \"I cal'late that I can gather together enough to meet the notes, Colonel. Just a little friendly transaction.\" Here followed an interval of sheer astonishment to Mr. Carvel.  \"You have this money?\" he said at length. Mr. Hopper nodded.  \"And you will take my note for the amount?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  The Colonel pulled his goatee, and sat back in his chair, trying to face the new light in which he saw his manager. He knew well enough that the man was not doing this out of charity, or even gratitude. He reviewed his whole career, from that first morning when he had carried bales to the shipping room, to his replacement of Mr. Hood, and there was nothing with which to accuse him. He remembered the warnings of Captain Lige and Virginia. He could not in honor ask a cent from the Captain now. He would not ask his sister-in-law, Mrs. Colfax, to let him touch the money he had so ably invested for her; that little which Virginia's mother had left the girl was sacred.  Night after night Mr. Carvel had lain awake with the agony of those Eastern debts. Not to pay was to tarnish the name of a Southern gentleman. He could not sell the business. His house would bring nothing in these times. He rose and began to pace the floor, tugging at his chin. Twice he paused to stare at Mr. Hopper, who sat calmly on, and the third time stopped abruptly before him.  \"See here,\" he cried. \"Where the devil did you get this money, sir?\"  Mr. Hopper did not rise.  \"I haven't been extravagant, Colonel, since I've worked for you,\" he said. \"It don't cost me much to live. I've been fortunate in investments.\"  The furrows in the Colonel's brow deepened.  \"You offer to lend me five times more than I have ever paid you, Mr. Hopper. Tell me how you have made this money before I accept it.\"  Eliphalet had never been able to meet that eye since he had known it. He did not meet it now. But he went to his desk, and drew a long sheet of paper from a pigeonhole.  \"These be some of my investments,\" he answered, with just a tinge of surliness. \"I cal'late they'll stand inspection. I ain't forcing you to take the money, sir,\" he flared up, all at once. \"I'd like to save the business.\"  Mr. Carvel was disarmed. He went unsteadily to his desk, and none save God knew the shock that his pride received that day. To rescue a name which had stood untarnished since he had brought it into the world, he drew forth some blank notes, and filled them out. But before he signed them he spoke:  \"You are a business man, Mr. Hopper,\" said he, \"And as a business man you must know that these notes will not legally hold. It is martial law. The courts are abolished, and all transactions here in St. Louis are invalid.\"  Eliphalet was about to speak.  \"One moment, sir,\" cried the Colonel, standing up and towering to his full height. \"Law or no law, you shall have the money and interest, or your security, which is this business. I need not tell you, sir, that my word is sacred, and binding forever upon me and mine.\"  \"I'm not afraid, Colonel,\" answered Mr. Hopper, with a feeble attempt at geniality. He was, in truth, awed at last.  \"You need not be, sir!\" said the Colonel, with equal force. \"If you were --this instant you should leave this place.\" He sat down, and continued more calmly: \"It will not be long before a Southern Army marches into St. Louis, and the Yankee Government submits.\" He leaned forward. \"Do you reckon we can hold the business together until then, Mr. Hopper?\"  God forbid that we should smile at the Colonel's simple faith. And if Eliphalet Hopper had done so, his history would have ended here.  \"Leave that to me, Colonel,\" he said soberly.  Then came the reaction. The good Colonel sighed as he signed, away that business which had been an honor to the, city where it was founded, I thank heaven that we are not concerned with the details of their talk that day. Why should we wish to know the rate of interest on those notes, or the time? It was war-time.  Mr. Hopper filled out his check, and presently departed. It was the signal for the little force which remained to leave. Outside, in the store; Ephum paced uneasily, wondering why his master did not come out. Presently he crept to the door of the office, pushed it open, and beheld Mr. Carvel with"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5393"],["title","The Crisis â€” Volume 06 (#2)"],["body","head bowed, down in his hands.  \"Marse Comyn!\" he cried, \"Marse Comyn!\"  The Colonel looked up. His face was haggard.  \"Marse Comyn, you know what I done promise young MISS long time ago, befo'--befo' she done left us?\"  \"Yes, Ephum.\"  He saw the faithful old negro but dimly. Faintly he heard the pleading voice.  \"Marse Comyn, won' you give Ephum a pass down, river, ter fotch Cap'n Lige?\"  \"Ephum,\" said the Colonel, sadly, \"I had a letter from the Captain yesterday. He is at Cairo. His boat is a Federal transport, and he is in Yankee pay.\"  Ephum took a step forward, appealingly, \"But de Cap'n's yo' friend, Marse Comyn. He ain't never fo'get what you done fo' him, Marse Comyn. He ain't in de army, suh.\"  \"And I am the Captain's friend, Ephum,\" answered the Colonel, quietly. \"But I will not ask aid from any man employed by the Yankee Government. No--not from my own brother, who is in a Pennsylvania regiments.\"  Ephum shuffled out, and his heart was lead as he closed the store that night.  Mr. Hopper has boarded a Fifth Street car, which jangles on with many halts until it comes to Bremen, a German settlement in the north of the city. At Bremen great droves of mules fill the street, and crowd the entrances of the sale stables there. Whips are cracking like pistol shots, Gentlemen with the yellow cavalry stripe of the United States Army are pushing to and fro among the drivers and the owners, and fingering the frightened animals. A herd breaks from the confusion and is driven like a whirlwind down the street, dividing at the Market House. They are going to board the Government transport--to die on the battlefields of Kentucky and Missouri.  Mr. Hopper alights from the car with complacency. He stands for a while on a corner, against the hot building, surveying the busy scene, unnoticed. Mules! Was it not a prophecy,--that drove which sent him into Mr. Carvel's store?  Presently a man with a gnawed yellow mustache and a shifty eye walks out of one of the offices, and perceives our friend.  \"Howdy, Mr. Hopper?\" says he.  Eliphalet extends a hand to be squeezed and returned. \"Got them vouchers?\" he asks. He is less careful of his English here.  \"Wal, I jest reckon,\" is the answer: The fellow was interrupted by the appearance of a smart young man in a smart uniform, who wore an air of genteel importance. He could not have been more than two and twenty, and his face and manners were those of a clerk. The tan of field service was lacking on his cheek, and he was black under the eyes.  \"Hullo, Ford,\" he said, jocularly.  \"Howdy, Cap,\" retorted the other. \"Wal, suh, that last lot was an extry, fo' sure. As clean a lot as ever I seed. Not a lump on 'em. Gov'ment ain't cheated much on them there at one-eighty a head, I reckon.\"  Mr. Ford said this with such an air of conviction and such a sober face that the Captain smiled. And at the same time he glanced down nervously at the new line of buttons on his chest.  \"I guess I know a mule from a Newfoundland dog by this time,\" said he.  \"Wal, I jest reckon,\" asserted Mr. Ford, with a loud laugh. \"Cap'n Wentworth, allow me to make you acquainted with Mr. Hopper. Mr. Hopper, Cap'n Wentworth.\"  The Captain squeezed Mr. Hoppers hand with fervor. \"You interested in mules, Mr. Hopper?\" asked the military man.  \"I don't cal'late to be,\" said. Mr. Hopper. Let us hope that our worthy has not been presented as being wholly without a sense of humor. He grinned as he looked upon this lamb in the uniform of Mars, and added, \"I'm just naturally patriotic, I guess. Cap'n, 'll you have a drink?\"  \"And a segar,\" added Mr. Ford.  \"Just one,\" says the Captain. \"It's d--d tiresome lookin' at mules all day in the sun.\"  Well for Mr. Davitt that his mission work does not extend to Bremen, that the good man's charity keeps him at the improvised hospital down town. Mr. Hopper has resigned the superintendency of his Sunday School, it is true, but he is still a pillar of the church.  The young officer leans against the bar, and listens to stories by Mr. Ford, which it behooves no church members to hear. He smokes Mr. Hopper's cigar and drinks his whiskey. And Eliphalet understands that the good Lord put some fools into the world in order to give the smart people a chance to practise their talents. Mr. Hopper neither drinks nor smokes, but he uses the spittoon with more freedom in this atmosphere.  When at length the Captain has marched out, with a conscious but manly air, Mr. Hopper turns to Ford-- \"Don't lose no time in presenting them vouchers at headquarters,\" says he. \"Money is worth something now. And there's grumbling about this Department in the Eastern papers, If we have an investigation, we'll whistle. How much to-day?\"  \"Three thousand,\" says Mr. Ford. He tosses off a pony of Bourbon, but his face is not a delight to look upon, \"Hopper, you'll be a d--d rich man some day.\"  \"I cal'late to.\"  \"I do the dirty work. And because I ain't got no capital, I only get four per cent.\"  \"Don't one-twenty a day suit you?\"  \"You get blasted near a thousand. And you've got horse contracts, and blanket contracts besides. I know you. What's to prevent my goin' south when the vouchers is cashed?\" he cried. \"Ain't it possible?\"  \"I presume likely,\" said Mr. Hopper, quietly. \"Then your mother'll have to move out of her little place.\"     CHAPTER II  NEWS FROM CLARENCE  The epithet aristocrat may become odious and fatal on the banks of the Mississippi as it was on the banks of the Seine. Let no man deceive himself! These are fearful times. Thousands of our population, by the sudden stoppage of business, are thrown out of employment. When gaunt famine intrudes upon their household, it is but natural that they should inquire the cause. Hunger began the French Revolution.  Virginia did not read this editorial, because it appeared in that abhorred organ of the Mudsills, the 'Missouri Democrat.' The wheels of fortune were turning rapidly that first hot summer of the war time. Let us be thankful that our flesh and blood are incapable of the fury of the guillotine. But when we think calmly of those days, can we escape without a little pity for the aristocrats? Do you think that many of them did not know hunger and want long before that cruel war was over?  How bravely they met the grim spectre which crept so insidiously into their homes!  \"Virginia, child.\" said Mrs. Colfax, peevishly, one morning as they sat at breakfast, \"why do you persist it wearing that old gown? It has gotten on my nerves, my dear. You really must have something new made, even if there are no men here to dress for.\"  \"Aunt Lillian, you must not say such things. I do not think that I ever dressed to please men.\"  \"Tut, tut; my dear, we all do. I did, even after married your uncle. It is natural. We must not go shabby in such times as these, or be out of fashion, Did you know that Prince Napoleon was actually coming here for a visit this autumn? We must be ready for him. I am having a fitting at Miss Elder's to-day.\"  Virginia was learning patience. She did not reply as she poured out her aunt's coffee.  \"Jinny,\" said that lady, \"come with me to Elder's, and I will give you some gowns. If Comyn had been as careful of his own money as of mine, you could dress decently.\"  \"I think I do dress decently, Aunt Lillian,\" answered the girl. \"I do not need the gowns. Give me the money you intend to pay for them, and I can use it for a better purpose.\"  Mrs. Colfax arranged her lace pettishly.  \"I am sick and tired of this superiority, Jinny.\" And in the same breath. \"What would you do with it?\"  Virginia lowered her voice. \"Hodges goes through the lines to-morrow night. I should send it to Clarence.\" \"But you have no idea where Clarence is.\"  \"Hodges can find him.\"  \"Pshaw!\" exclaimed her aunt, \"I would not trust him. How do you know that he will get through the Dutch pickets to Price's army? Wasn't Souther captured last week, and that rash letter of Puss Russell's to Jack Brinsmade published in the Democrat?\" She laughed at the recollection, and Virginia was fain to laugh too. \"Puss hasn't been around much since. I hope that will cure her of saying what she thinks of people.\"  \"It won't,\" said Virginia.  \"I'll save my money until Price drives the Yankees from the state, and Clarence marches into the city at the head of a regiment,\" Mrs. Colfax went on, \"It won't be long now.\"  Virginia's eyes flashed.  \"Oh, you can't have read the papers. And don't you remember the letter Maude had from George? They need the bare necessities of life, Aunt Lillian. And half of Price's men have no arms at all.\"  \"Jackson,\" said Mrs. Colfax, \"bring me a newspaper. Is there any news to-day?\"  \"No,\" answered Virginia, quickly. \"All we know is that Lyon has left Springfield to meet our troops, and that a great battle is coming, Perhaps--perhaps it is being fought to-day.\"  Mrs. Colfax burst into tears, \"Oh, Jinny,\" she cried, \"how can you be so cruel!\"  That very evening a man, tall and lean, but with the shrewd and kindly eye of a scout, came into the sitting-room with the Colonel and handed a letter to Mrs. Colfax. In the hall he slipped into Virginia's hand another, in a \"Jefferson Davis\" envelope, and she thrust it in her gown --the girl was on fire as he whispered in her ear that he had seen Clarence, and that he was well. In two days an answer might be left at Mr. Russell's house. But she must be careful what she wrote, as the Yankee scouts were active.  Clarence, indeed, had proven himself a man. Glory and uniform became him well, but danger and deprivation better. The words he had written, careless and frank and boyish, made Virginia's heart leap with pride. Mrs. Colfax's letter began with the adventure below the Arsenal, when the frail skiff had sunk near the island, He told how he had heard the captain of his escort sing out to him in the darkness, and how he had floated down the current instead, until, chilled and weary, he had contrived to seize the branches of a"]]]
